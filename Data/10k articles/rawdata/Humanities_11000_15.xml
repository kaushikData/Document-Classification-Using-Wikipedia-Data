The Egyptian journal al-Katib al-misri ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: الكاتب المصري; [[Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft|DMG]]: al-Kātib al-miṣrī; [[English language|English]]: "The Egyptian Writer") was published in Cairo monthly from 1945-1948. It was founded originally by the Egyptian Press and Publishing House owned by the Jewish al-Harari family who entrusted [[Taha Hussein]] (1889-1973) with the management.&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed El-Bendary (2010): The Egyptian Press and Coverage of Local and International Events. US Lexington Books, Lanham, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was published in total in 32 issues and was available in numerous Arab metropolises.&lt;ref&gt;May Hawas (2018): Taha Hussein and the Case for World Literature. In: Comparative Literature Studies. Vol. 55, Issue 1, p. 66–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus of the journal was the publication of international literature and literary criticism, which were translated into Arabic and so helped to reach a broader readership. Both Arabic and non-Arabic art, literature and science were encouraged and a dialogue between Arabic and other languages should be established.&lt;ref&gt;May Hawas (2018): Taha Hussein and the Case for World Literature. In: Comparative Literature Studies. Vol. 55, Issue 1, p. 66–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the first post-war magazines, al-Kātib al-miṣrī also aimed to make its vision of the enlightenment accessible to all and to promote mutual cultural exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Jens Hanssen and Max Weiss (2018): Arabic Thought against the Authoritarian Age: Towards an Intellectual History of the Present. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; "Literature should be lifted above all conflicts existing world-wide."&lt;ref&gt;al-Kātib al-Miṣrī (1945), Vol. 1, Issue 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic translations among others, of works by [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]] or [[Jean-Paul Satre]],&lt;ref&gt;Jens Hanssen and Max Weiss (2018): Arabic Thought against the Authoritarian Age: Towards an Intellectual History of the Present. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; were published, texts of promising new Arab authors&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Dwight Micklethwait (2010): Faits Divers: National Culture and Modernism in Third World Literary Magazines.

'''''Angela's Ashes: A Memoir''''' is a 1996 [[memoir]] by the Irish-American author Frank McCourt, with various anecdotes and stories of his childhood. It details his very early childhood in [[Brooklyn, New York]], but focuses primarily on his life in [[Limerick, Ireland]]. It also includes his struggles with poverty and his father's [[alcoholism]].

The book was published in 1996 and won the 1997 [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography]]. A sequel, ''[['Tis]]'', was published in 1999, followed by ''[[Teacher Man]]'' in 2005.

==Synopsis==
Born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], on 19 August 1930, Frank (Francis) McCourt is the oldest son of Malachy McCourt and Angela Sheehan McCourt. Both of his parents emigrated from Ireland and married in a shotgun wedding over Angela's pregnancy with Frankie. Angela is originally from Limerick, Ireland, and is fond of music, singing, and dancing. Malachy, from Northern Ireland, is an alcoholic known for his "odd manner" and for telling fantastical stories about Irish heroes. Frankie is often said to closely resemble his father, having a hang-dog face and the same "odd manner." The narrative is told from the point of view of Frankie as a child.

In America, the McCourts live in modern tenement housing next to a park and share a floor, and a communal lavatory, with other immigrant families from Ireland, Italy, and the Jewish communities.

Frankie has four younger siblings: [[Malachy McCourt|Malachy]], born in 1931, who is often favored over Frankie for being an attractive, open child; blond twins Oliver and Eugene, born in 1932; and an infant sister, Margaret, in 1935.

The family often struggles with poverty as Malachy Sr. engages in an endless struggle to find work and alcohol. The family's prospects, and Angela's spirits, lift whenever he finds a new job and brings home his first week's wages, but eventually he finds himself spending all of his pay in pubs, despite Angela's many schemes to prevent him from doing so, and losing his job after a few weeks.

Margaret's birth seems to instill new life into the family: the whole family falls in love with her, Malachy Sr most of all. He gives up drinking and finds steady work to support the family. However, due to her parents' ignorance of children's disease, Margaret lives for only seven weeks. With her death, Malachy Sr abandons his family for days to indulge in an alcoholic binge, while Angela falls into a severe, debilitating depression. Frank, age six, is forced to feed and care for his younger siblings, often with the kind intervention of the neighbors. The neighbors soon realize the family's dire straits and intervene, contacting Angela's cousins, who in turn recommend the family return to Ireland with Angela's family in [[Limerick, Ireland|Limerick]].

Angela is pregnant with a new baby, as they return to Ireland from America, and lose the child, shortly after moving to Limerick.

The [[Great Depression]] has struck Ireland, particularly Limerick, even harder than it did the United States. There is little work, and conditions for poor families are miserable. Malachy Sr finds it even more difficult to find work because of his Northern Ireland accent and mannerisms, the children are mocked for their American accents, and many neighbors, as well as Angela's family, look down on the McCourts for their return from America.

The family is forced to rely on [[Welfare|the dole]] and charity from the local [[Society of Saint Vincent de Paul]], which requires extensive, and humiliating application processes. Angela and Malachy Sr often argue about this as Malachy drinks the welfare money meant to feed the family, and views Angela's asking for charity as begging and degrading. For many years, the family subsists on little more than bread and tea.

Within a year of the family's arrival, Oliver and Eugene also die—Oliver of what is implied to be [[scarlet fever]] and Eugene, a few months later, from grieving the loss of his twin and malnutrition. After each death, Angela sinks into depression, and the family moves because she cannot bear being in the same house. Each move results in the McCourts sliding down into worse and worse circumstances. Eventually, they end up living in a slum house. The entire ground floor floods for half a year, requiring the family to live in an upstairs room together. Their house is located next to the only lavatory on the whole street. There is a constant traffic of families dumping chamber pots in the filthy lavatory, which often backs up and smells. Two additional baby brothers, Michael (born 1936), and [[Alphie McCourt|Alphie]] (Alphonsus, b.&amp;nbsp;1940), are born in Limerick.

Frankie grows up in Limerick as a sensitive and intelligent child. He often makes unique observations from those around him and has an emotional need to help. His strict Catholic upbringing preys on his imaginative nature and thoughts on whether he will be going to hell plague on his mind. Frankie must balance his Catholic beliefs against a church which frequently rejects him due to his poverty and family, his Irish upbringing against his desire to return to America once he's grown, and his desire for his father's attention against his loyalty to his mother. Strangers often prefer his more attractive and outgoing siblings, but Frankie wins over a few champions, mainly in the form of his school teachers and the various adults who hire him for odd jobs.

Frank develops [[typhoid fever]] and is taken to a Catholic hospital, where for the first time he has adequate food, warmth, and access to limitless books, and the time to read them, giving birth to his lifelong love of literature. Frankie additionally contracts chronic [[conjunctivitis]], which does little to improve his looks or perceived, sarcastic demeanor.

At the outbreak of [[World War II]], many Limerick men find work at a defence plant in [[Coventry, England]], leaving their families behind and sending back money to support them. These good-paying jobs lift many of the McCourts' neighbors out of poverty. Malachy Sr leaves the family behind and secures a defence job. For several weeks, the payments allow the family to enjoy small luxuries such as candy and visits to the movies. But soon, the money stops coming and Malachy Sr abandons his family for good.

Frank and his brothers begin to scavenge the streets for [[coal]] or [[peat]] turf for fuel. They also steal leftover food from restaurants at the end of the day and grocery deliveries from doorsteps.

Eventually, the family is evicted and homeless. With few options, Angela and her children move in with her bachelor cousin, Laman Griffin. Laman is a petty tyrant who resents the presence of the children and enjoys degrading them and Angela. A preteen Frankie resents this treatment, but puts up with it for his mother and younger brothers. Upon discovering that part of Laman's deal for providing housing is a sexual relationship with Angela, Frankie has a fight with Laman and is thrown out of the house. Shortly after, Malachy Jr leaves Laman Griffin's to join the military as a bugle boy.

Frankie moves in with his maternal uncle, who was dropped on his head as a child and now lives in the house left to him by his deceased mother. Frank gets a job as a telegram delivery boy on his 14th birthday and begins to support himself while saving for his passage to America. The interesting people and situations Frankie meets on his deliveries cause him to grow as a person.

Frankie supports his youngest brothers by providing food and respite from Laman Griffin when they come to visit him. Eventually, his brothers ask if they can move in with him, which he allows, and they are shortly followed by Angela. Frankie must now turn over the majority of his wages to his mother as the bread winner of the family, though he still takes on various odd jobs to earn extra for his ticket to America, such as writing threatening collection letters on behalf of a local [[moneylender]].

On his sixteenth birthday, Frank's uncle takes him to the pub to buy him his first beer. Frank gets drunk and returns home, singing like his father used to. When his mother shames him for drinking the way his father did, Frank hits her, accusing her of being a whore for Laman Griffin, and is immediately ashamed of himself.

One day Frank returns to the moneylender's home to find she has died. Liberated, Frank takes money from her purse and throws her ledger of debtors into the river to free the neighborhood of their debts. The contents of the moneylender's purse give him enough money to return to America at the age of nineteen. Frank arrives in [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]], ready to begin a new life in the country of his birth.

==Background==
After traveling to America (where the book ends), Frank ended up working at the Biltmore Hotel in New York City, where he remained until 1951. Frank was drafted during the [[Korean war]] to be stationed in [[Bavaria]], Germany. After being discharged, Frank returned to New York and dabbled with several different jobs until he was accepted into [[NYU]]. After graduating in 1957 with a bachelor's degree in English, McCourt turned to teaching in New York schools. He then obtained his master's degree and traveled to Dublin in pursuit of his PhD, which he never completed.

==Awards==
''Angela's Ashes'' won several awards, including the 1997 [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/1997-Biography-or-Autobiography|title=The 1997 Pulitzer Prize Winners: Biography or Autobiography|work=[[Pulitzer Prize|The Pulitzer Prizes]]|accessdate=December 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1996 [[National Book Critics Circle]] Award (Biography),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bookcritics.org/awards/past_awards/#1997|title=National Book Critics Circle: Awards|work=[[National Book Critics Circle]]|accessdate=December 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1997 [[Exclusive Books Boeke Prize|Boeke Prize]].

He was elected Irish American of the Year in 1998.

==Criticism==
McCourt was accused of greatly exaggerating his family's impoverished upbringing by many Limerick natives, including [[Richard Harris]].&lt;ref Name="Obit"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/5867097/Frank-McCourt.html ''Telegraph''] "Frank McCourt " obituary. 20 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news| last=Grimes| first=William| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/books/20mccourt.html| title=Frank McCourt, Whose Irish Childhood Illuminated His Prose, Is Dead at 78| work=[[The New York Times]]| quote = | date=2009-07-19| accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/incoming/incoming_dailyfeed/bitter-feud-between-fellow-limerick-men-over-destiny-of-angelas-ashes-26805353.html| title=Bitter feud between fellow Limerick men over destiny of 'Angela's Ashes'| publisher=Irish Independent| author=John McEntee| date=December 25, 2011| accessdate=December 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCourt's own mother had denied the accuracy of his stories shortly before her death in 1981, shouting from the audience during a stage performance of his and his brother [[Malachy McCourt|Malachy]]'s recollections that it was "all a pack of lies."&lt;ref Name="Obit"/&gt;

==Film==
In 1999&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145653/&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Angela's Ashes (film)|film]] version was released. It was co-written and directed by [[Alan Parker]] starring Joe Breen, [[Ciaran Owens]], and [[Michael Legge (actor)|Michael Legge]], as the Young, Middle and Older [[Frank McCourt]] respectively and [[Emily Watson]] as McCourt's mother Angela, Robert Carlyle as the father.

The film begins when the McCourt family move back to Ireland after experiencing hardship in America. Many of the Street scenes were filmed in [[Cork (city)|Cork, Ireland]]. The film soundtrack was composed and conducted by [[John Williams]], and features songs by [[Billie Holiday]] and [[Sinéad O'Connor]].

==Musical==

A [[stage musical]] written by Paul Hurt, with music and lyrics by Adam Howell based on the book premiered in the [[Lime Tree Theatre]], Limerick on July 6, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The reviews are in, here’s what everybody thinks of Angela's Ashes the Musical|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/entertainment/the-reviews-are-in-heres-what-everybody-thinks-of-angelas-ashes-the-musical-797906.html|accessdate=25 September 2017|work=[[Irish Examiner]]|date=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''August Schleicher''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|l|aɪ|k|ər}}; {{IPA-de|ˈʔaʊɡʊst ˈʃlaɪçɐ|lang}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://de.langenscheidt.com/deutsch-franzoesisch/august|title=August - Französisch-Übersetzung - Langenscheidt Deutsch-Französisch Wörterbuch|publisher=[[Langenscheidt]]|accessdate=20 October 2018|language=de, fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wells|first=John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|isbn=9781405881180}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19 February 1821 – 6 December 1868) was a [[Germany|German]] [[linguistics|linguist]]. His great work was ''A Compendium of the Comparative [[Grammar]] of the [[Indo-European Languages]]'', in which he attempted to reconstruct the [[Proto-Indo-European language]]. To show how Indo-European might have looked, he created a short tale, [[Schleicher's fable]], to exemplify the reconstructed vocabulary and aspects of Indo-European society inferred from it.

== Life ==
Schleicher was born in [[Meiningen]], in the [[Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen]], southwest of [[Weimar]] in the [[Thuringian Forest]].

He died from [[tuberculosis]] at the age of 47 in [[Jena]], in the [[Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]], in present-day [[Thuringia]].

== Career ==
Schleicher was educated at the [[University of Tübingen]] and [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] and taught at the [[Charles University in Prague]] and the [[University of Jena]]. He began his career studying theology and [[Oriental languages]], especially [[Arabic]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Sanskrit]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. Influenced by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], he formed the theory that a [[language]] is an [[organism]], with periods of development, maturity and decline. In 1850, Schleicher completed a monograph systematically describing [[European languages]], ''Die Sprachen Europas in systematischer Uebersicht&lt;!--[sic; see 'Talk:Gottlob Frege#Ueber']--&gt; (The Languages of Europe in Systematic Perspective)''. He explicitly represented languages as perfectly natural organisms that could most conveniently be described using terms drawn from [[biology]]: [[genus]], [[species]], and [[variety (biology)|variety]].

Schleicher claimed that he himself had been convinced of the natural descent and competition of languages before he had read [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] ''Origin of Species''. He invented a system of language classification that resembled a [[botany|botanical]] taxonomy, tracing groups of [[language families and languages|related languages]] and arranging them in a genealogical tree.
[[File:Schleicher Tree.jpg|thumb|right|Schleicher's tree model]]

His model, the [[Tree model|''Stammbaumtheorie'' (family-tree theory)]], was a major development in the study of Indo-European languages. He first introduced a graphic representation of a ''[[Evolutionary tree|Stammbaum]]'' in an article published in 1853 entitled ''Die ersten Spaltungen des indogermanischen Urvolkes''. By the time of the publication of his ''Deutsche Sprache ([[German language]])'' (1860) he had begun to use trees to illustrate language descent. Schleicher is commonly recognized as the first linguist to portray [[language development]] using the figure of a ''tree''. Largely in reaction to this, [[Johannes Schmidt (linguist)|Johannes Schmidt]] later proposed his 'Wave Theory' as an alternative model.

For the most part, however, Darwin's ideas simply overlaid the fundamental features of Schleicher's prior [[Evolutionary linguistics|evolutionary project]], which derived from the work of those individuals immersed in [[German romanticism]] and [[German idealism|idealism]], especially [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] and Hegel.

Schleicher believed that languages pass through a life cycle, similar to that of living beings. They start simpler than they will become. This state of primitive simplicity was followed by a period of growth, which eventually slowed, and then gave way to a period of decay (1874:4):

: As man has developed, so also has his language (...): even the simplest language is the product of a gradual growth: all higher forms of language have come out of simpler ones.... Language declines both in sound and in form.... The transition from the first to the second period is one of slower progress.

Schleicher was an advocate of the [[Polygenesis (linguistics)|polygenesis]] of languages. He reasoned as follows (1876:2):

: To assume one original universal language is impossible; there are rather many original languages: this is a certain result obtained by the comparative treatment of the languages of the world which have lived till now. Since languages are continually dying out, whilst no new ones practically arise, there must have been originally many more languages than at present. The number of original languages was therefore certainly far larger than has been supposed from the still-existing languages.

Schleicher's ideas on polygenesis had long-lasting influence, both directly and via their adoption by the biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]]. Ernst Haeckel was a German evolutionist and zoologist known for proposing the [[Urmetazoan#Gastraea hypothesis|gastraea hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ernst-Haeckel|title=Ernst Haeckel {{!}} German embryologist|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-04-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, [[August Leskien]], a pioneer of research into [[Sound change|sound laws]], began studying comparative linguistics under August Schleicher at the University of Jena.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1942">The '''Belgrade Competition in Oratory''' is an annual academic event at the [[University of Belgrade]]'s [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law|Law School]], which has gained significant popularity of the general public all over [[Serbia]]. In this competition students deliver their speeches on both free-choice and given topics. The event represents an opportunity for students to express their critical opinions in front of government officials sitting in the front rows of the audience, when the largest lecture hall at the [[law school]] is filled to capacity. The competition is broadcast live on the national television program.

This event is traditionally organized by university professors [[Obrad Stanojević]] and [[Sima Avramović]], the founders of the Center for Oratory ''Institutio oratoria'', which gathers the University of Belgrade's Law School students interested in developing [[public speaking]] skills and prepares them for competitions. These scholars hold an optional course on [[rhetoric]] at the Law School and both are authors of textbooks on rhetoric.

Following the example of the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law|Belgrade Law School]], several educational institutions in the region organize their own similar events. The winners of local competitions throughout Serbia take part in the Serbian universities wide finals.

'''Campus Watch''' is a web-based project of the [[Middle East Forum]], a [[think tank]] with its headquarters in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. According to its website, Campus Watch "reviews and critiques [[Middle Eastern studies|Middle East studies]] in [[North America]] with an aim to improving them."&lt;ref name=aboutCW&gt;
[http://www.campus-watch.org/about.php About Campus Watch, Campus Watch website.] Accessed 2010-12-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of Campus Watch say that it is a pro-[[Israel]] lobbyist organization involved in harassing, blacklisting, or intimidating scholars critical of Israel.&lt;ref name=NYROB2007&gt;

== Dossiers ==
Campus Watch encourages students to submit reports about college professors.&lt;ref name=NYROB2007 /&gt; In 2002, Campus Watch created a controversy when it compiled these reports into 'dossiers' critical of various professors at institutes of higher learning in the United States, in which it detailed their supposedly "anti-Israeli statements".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/rights/14227/a_spy_in_the_ivory_tower/ Langeland, Terje, "A Spy in the Ivory Tower," ''Colorado Springs Independent,'' Oct. 3, 2002, reprinted on alternet.org.] Accessed Dec. 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the posting of the dossiers on its website, many individuals sent harassing emails and phone calls to the profiled professors, and the website was widely condemned in the media for supposedly engaging in "[[McCarthyism|McCarthyesque]]" intimidation.&lt;ref name=SFC020908&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The response of [[Judith Butler]], a comparative literature professor at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], was circulated on the Internet:

:I have recently learned that your organization is compiling dossiers on professors at U.S. academic institutions who oppose the Israeli occupation and its brutality, actively support Palestinian rights of self-determination as well as a more informed and intelligent view of Islam than is currently represented in the U.S. media. I would be enormously honored to be counted among those who actively hold these positions and would like to be included in the list of those who are struggling for justice.&lt;ref name=NYT020927 /&gt;

[[Rashid Khalidi]], a professor at [[Columbia University]] who was the subject of a critical dossier on the website, suggested that the Campus Watch campaign was an attempt to silence legitimate criticism, "by tarring it with the brush of [[anti-Semitism]] and [[anti-Americanism]], truly loathsome charges."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adc.org/index.php?id=1142 |title=ADC Denounces New Efforts to Chill Academic Freedom |work=Press Release |publisher=[[American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee]] |date=September 26, 2002 |accessdate=2008-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khalidi taped an anonymous phone call he received, subsequent to the Campus Watch dossier publication, that says: "Khalidi, Columbia alumni love Campus Watch because they keep an eye on thugs like you.

== Criticism ==
An article in ''[[The Nation]]'' suggests that Daniel Pipes is "an anti-Arab propagandist", and his Campus Watch project aims to "smear" academics critical of the [[Israeli occupation]] or of [[American foreign policy]].&lt;ref name=TN021111/&gt; Campus Watch's project was identified, in ''The Nation'' and elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. E. Marmura. ''Hegemony in the digital age: the Arab/Israeli conflict online''. Lexington Books, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-7391-1772-9}}. Page 33&lt;/ref&gt; as resembling a decades-old AIPAC project:
:In 1979 the [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]] (AIPAC) formed its Political Leadership Development Program, which "educates and trains young leaders in pro-Israel political advocacy," enlisting hundreds of college students to collect information on pro-Palestinian professors and student organizations. By 1983 the program had attracted more than 5,000 students on 350 campuses in all fifty states. The next year the findings were published as The AIPAC College Guide: Exposing the Anti-Israel Campaign on Campus, which surveyed 100 campuses and instructed students on how best to counter a "steady diet of anti-Israel vituperation." Around the same time, the Anti-Defamation League covertly distributed a twenty-one-page booklet containing "background information on pro-Arab sympathizers active on college campuses" who "use their anti-Zionism as merely a guise for their deeply felt anti-Semitism."

[[Joel Beinin]], who has often been criticized by Campus Watch, has accused Daniel Pipes of being "beholden to Israeli right wing politics."&lt;ref name=bein&gt;
{{cite web

 |title=Who's Watching the Watchers?
 |first=Joel |last=Beinin |authorlink=Joel Beinin
 |publisher=[[History News Network]] |date=September 30, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Beinin, "After failing in his own pursuit of an academic career, Pipes has evidently decided to take revenge on the scholarly community that rejected him", in the form of the Campus Watch website.&lt;ref name=bein /&gt; Pipes strongly denied Beinin's charges, writing that he was "offered a tenure-track position and turned it down, preferring to write than teach".&lt;ref name=PipesPiping&gt;
[http://www.danielpipes.org/blog/2004/01/department-of-corrections-of-others-factual#KDaniel Pipes, Daniel, "Department of Corrections (of Others' Factual Mistakes about Me): Joel Beinin lies about me," danielpipes.org, October 1, 2004.] Accessed December 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; while simultaneously attacking Beinin "of credentialitis, the disease that places more emphasis on qualifications than achievements"&lt;ref name=PipesPiping/&gt; and the fact that "Harvard's doctoral program in history turned him down but awarded me a Ph.D.."&lt;ref name=PipesPiping/&gt; Beinin has also alleged that Campus Watch "makes comments" about the ethnic and cultural background of scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/33228631/CURRICULAR-ACTIVISM-AND-ACADEMIC-FREEDOM-REPRESENTATIONS-OF-ARABS-AND-MUSLIMS-IN-PRINT-AND-INTERNET-MEDIA] Salaita, Steven, "Curricular Activism and Academic Freedom," ''Arab Studies Quarterly,'' 2008, reprinted in britannica.com.] Accessed Dec. 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their paper "[[The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy]]", [[John Mearsheimer]] and [[Stephen Walt]] wrote that
:The Lobby also monitors what professors write and teach. In September 2002, for example, Martin Kramer and Daniel Pipes, two passionately pro-Israel neoconservatives, established a website (Campus Watch) that posted dossiers on suspect academics and encouraged students to report remarks or behavior that might be considered hostile to Israel. This transparent attempt to blacklist and intimidate scholars prompted a harsh reaction, and Pipes and Kramer later removed the dossiers, but the website still invites students to report "anti-Israel" activity.&lt;ref name=M-W-2006&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mearsheimer, John J. |authorlink=John Mearsheimer |author2=Walt, Stephen M. |authorlink2=Stephen Walt |title=The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy |url=http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/Research/wpaper.nsf/rwp/RWP06-011/$File/rwp_06_011_walt.pdf |format=PDF |date=March 13, 2006 |accessdate=2008-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308211346/http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/Research/wpaper.nsf/rwp/RWP06-011/%24File/rwp_06_011_walt.pdf |archivedate=March 8, 2008 |df= }} See also ''[[The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Pipes responded to part of the Mearsheimer and Walt allegations, writing
:This account is inaccurate in several ways (e.g. Martin Kramer had no role in founding Campus Watch), but I write specifically to state that no 'Lobby' told me to start Campus Watch. Neither the Middle East Forum nor myself has ever taken orders from some mythical 'Lobby', and specifically I decided to establish Campus Watch on my own, without direction from any outside source. I challenge Mearsheimer and Walt to provide their information that connects this 'Lobby' to my decision to establish Campus Watch.&lt;ref name=Pipes060512&gt;

 |title=Is Campus Watch Part of a Conspiracy? (On Mearsheimer-Walt and The "Israeli Lobby")
 |date=May 12, 2006}}
Originally published in [[FrontPage Magazine]].&lt;/ref&gt;
Later he wrote that "Mearsheimer and Walt unconditionally concede they have no information about the alleged “lobby” giving me orders concerning Campus Watch, confirming the falsehood of their initial claim"&lt;ref name=Pipes060512/&gt; and furthermore added
:Campus Watch is to Middle East studies as political analysis to politics, film criticism to movies, and consumer reports to manufacturing; we provide assessments for the public. Unlike politicians, actors, and business executives, who accept criticism with good grace, academics howl with umbrage at being judged.&lt;ref name=Pipes060512/&gt;

=== Response ===
According to Campus Watch,  it "critiques Middle East studies in North America regardless of whether they address Israel."&lt;ref name=MyersC27/&gt; In response to what it refers to as "a campaign of vilification and distortion" by critics, Campus Watch states:
:* Campus Watch supports the unencumbered freedom of speech of all scholars, regardless of their views.
:* Campus Watch takes no position on individual academic appointments.
:* Academic freedom does not mean freedom from criticism; to the contrary, no one enjoys privileges in the free marketplace of ideas.
:* The charge of "McCarthyism" has come up so often that we address this in a separate study which demonstrates why the charge is ignorant, intolerant, and ultimately self-serving.
:* We challenge scholars of Middle Eastern studies to abandon the crude resort to insults and engage Campus Watch on the substance of our analysis.&lt;ref name=aboutCW /&gt;

The '''Carrizo Christ''' is an 11th-century [[ivory carving]] and is conserved in the Museo de León, [[León (Spain)|León]] (Spain). The figure is {{convert|13|in|cm}} high. The piece came from the [[Cistercian]] monastery of Santa María de Carrizo located some 16 miles west of León.

The figure of Christ is impressive due to the size of the head and his largue eyes wide open. Hands and feet as well are conceived out of proportion to the rest of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|VV.AA.|1993|p= 114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Categorization''' is the process in which ideas and objects are recognized, differentiated, and understood.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, H., &amp; Lefebvre, C. (Eds.). (2005).[https://books.google.com/books?id=5WDfl14RgKMC ''Handbook of Categorization in Cognitive Science'']. Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; Categorization implies that objects are grouped into categories, usually for some specific purpose. Ideally, a category illuminates a [[Binary relation|relationship]] between the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]s and [[object (philosophy)|object]]s of knowledge. Categorization is fundamental in language, prediction, [[inference]], decision making and in all kinds of environmental interaction. It is indicated that categorization plays a major role in [[computer programming]].&lt;ref&gt;Frey, T., Gelhausen, M., &amp; Saake (2011).[http://ecs.victoria.ac.nz/twiki/pub/Events/PLATEAU/Program/plateau2011-frey.pdf '' Categorization of Concerns – A Categorical Program Comprehension Model. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Evaluation and Usability of Programming Languages and Tools (PLATEAU) at the ACM Onward! and SPLASH Conferences. October, 2011. Portland, Oregon, USA''].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many categorization theories and techniques. In a broader historical view, however, three general approaches to categorization may be identified:
* Classical categorization
* Conceptual clustering
* Prototype theory

==The classical view==
{{main|Categories (Aristotle)}}
'''Classical categorization''' first appears in the context of [[Western Philosophy]] in the work of [[Plato]], who, in his [[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]] dialogue, introduces the approach of grouping objects based on their similar [[Property (philosophy)|properties]]. This approach was further explored and systematized by [[Aristotle]] in his [[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]] treatise, where he analyzes the differences between [[Class (philosophy)|class]]es and [[Object (philosophy)|object]]s. Aristotle also applied intensively the classical categorization scheme in his approach to the classification of living beings (which uses the technique of applying successive narrowing questions such as "Is it an animal or vegetable?", "How many feet does it have?", "Does it have fur or feathers?", "Can it fly?"...), establishing this way the basis for [[natural kind|natural]] [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]].

The classical [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] view claims that categories are discrete entities characterized by a set of properties which are shared by their members. In [[analytic philosophy]], these properties are assumed to establish the conditions which are both [[necessary and sufficient condition]]s to capture meaning.

According to the classical view, categories should be clearly defined, mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. This way, any entity of the given classification universe belongs unequivocally to one, and only one, of the proposed categories.

==Conceptual clustering==
{{main|Conceptual clustering}}
'''Conceptual clustering''' is a modern variation of the classical approach, and derives from attempts to explain how knowledge is represented. In this approach, [[Class (philosophy)|class]]es (clusters or entities) are generated by first formulating their conceptual descriptions and then classifying the entities according to the descriptions.

Conceptual clustering developed mainly during the 1980s, as a [[machine learning|machine]] paradigm for [[unsupervised learning]]. It is distinguished from ordinary [[Cluster analysis|data clustering]] by generating a concept description for each generated category.

Categorization tasks in which category labels are provided to the learner for certain objects are referred to as supervised classification, [[supervised learning]], or [[concept learning]]. Categorization tasks in which no labels are supplied are referred to as unsupervised classification, [[unsupervised learning]], or [[Cluster analysis|data clustering]]. The task of supervised classification involves extracting information from the labeled examples that allows accurate prediction of class labels of future examples. This may involve the [[abstraction]] of a rule or concept relating observed object features to category labels, or it may not involve abstraction (e.g., [[Exemplar theory|exemplar model]]s). The task of clustering involves recognizing inherent structure in a data set and grouping objects together by similarity into classes. It is thus a process of ''generating'' a classification structure.

Conceptual clustering is closely related to [[fuzzy set]] theory, in which objects may belong to one or more groups, in varying degrees of fitness.

==Prototype theory==
{{main|Prototype theory}}
Since the research by [[Eleanor Rosch]] and [[George Lakoff]] in the 1970s, categorization can also be viewed as the process of grouping things based on [[prototype]]s—the idea of necessary and sufficient conditions is almost never met in categories of naturally occurring things. It has also been suggested that categorization based on prototypes is the basis for human development, and that this learning relies on learning about the world via [[embodied cognition|embodiment]].

A [[cognition|cognitive]] approach accepts that natural categories are graded (they tend to be [[fuzzy concept|fuzzy]] at their boundaries) and inconsistent in the status of their constituent members.

Systems of categories are not objectively "out there" in the world but are rooted in people's experience. Conceptual categories are not identical for different cultures, or indeed, for every individual in the same culture.

Categories form part of a hierarchical structure when applied to such subjects as [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] in [[biological classification]]: higher level: life-form level, middle level: generic or [[genus]] level, and lower level: the [[species]] level. These can be distinguished by certain traits that put an item in its distinctive category. But even these can be arbitrary and are subject to revision.

Categories at the middle level are perceptually and conceptually the more salient. The generic level of a category tends to elicit the most responses and richest images and seems to be the psychologically basic level. Typical taxonomies in zoology for example exhibit categorization at the [[embodied cognition|embodied]] level, with similarities leading to formulation of "higher" categories, and differences leading to differentiation within categories.

== Miscategorization ==
{{main|Category mistake}}
{{unref-sect|date=November 2017}}
Miscategorization can be a [[Fallacy|logical fallacy]] in which diverse and dissimilar objects, concepts, entities, etc. are grouped together based upon illogical common denominators, or common denominators that virtually any concept, object or entity have in common. A common way miscategorization occurs is through an over-categorization of concepts, objects or entities, and then miscategorization based upon characters that virtually all things have in common.

The '''Coat of Arms of Greater Manchester''' was granted to the [[Greater Manchester County Council]] upon its formation in 1974 by the [[College of Arms]]. The county council was abolished as a consequence of the [[Local Government Act 1985]] which rendered the arms as being no longer officially in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/31/newsid_2530000/2530803.stm |title=31 March: 1986: Greater London Council abolished |publisher=BBC |accessdate=8 November 2014 |year=2008 |work=On this day 1950–2005}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The [[blazon]] of the arms is described as follows:&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book | title= Tradition in action: the historical evolution of the Greater Manchester County |last=Frangopulo|first=Nicholas Joseph | year= 1977 | publisher=EP Publishing |ref=harv| isbn= 0-7158-1203-3|chapter=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Shield''': The shield bears ten turrets in gold, representing the ten districts of the County, on a red ground.
*'''Supporters''': The shield is supported on each side by a lion rampant in gold. Each lion bears on its shoulder a badge in red, the lion on the right of the shield bearing a badge with a French horn, representing music and culture, and the lion on the left of the shield bearing a badge with an open book, representing learning and academic life of the County.
*'''Crest''': The helm is surmounted by a demi-lion carrying a banner bearing ten small turrets in gold on a red ground.
*'''Motto''': ''"Ever Vigilant"''.

==Today==

[[File:County Flag of Greater Manchester.png |thumb|right|[[Flag of Greater Manchester|County Flag of Greater Manchester]]]]
Although the coat of arms is no longer in use by authorities, variant segments of the arms are still used today, such as the badge of the [[Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service]] whose arms bear a defaced version of the shield without the gold [[Battlement|crenellations]] trim, and the crest which is also used by the [[Greater Manchester Army Cadet Force]], a demi-lion carrying the banner. A version of the shield was also used as the flag which is still used to represent the county.

&lt;!--With the planned appointment of a directly elected [[Mayor of Greater Manchester]] in the future, alongside the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, it is unknown if the coat of arms or flag will be transferred and officially re-adopted as a form of authority identification.--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3035">The '''Columbus Invitational Arts Competition''' is a competitive arts event held annually in [[Columbus, Ohio]] since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/life_and_entertainment/2012/06/17/performance-music-and-more-to-be-showcased.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The event brings together organizations selected for inclusion due to a combination of "artistic excellence and exceptional community involvement."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/life_and_entertainment/2013/08/22/event-gives-range-of-talent-an-opportunity-to-perform.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In its first year the event drew participation from twenty-five local groups representing over three hundred individual artists, across four categories, Performing Arts, Visual Arts, Studio Recordings and Literary Arts.  Literary Arts was eliminated in the second year&lt;ref&gt;http://www.columbusalive.com/content/stories/2013/08/08/arts-preview-columbus-invitational-arts-competition-visual-arts-exhibition.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the divisions were further reduced to Performing Arts and Visual Arts for the third year, which was billed as a "regional" competition, and which drew participation from all five states surrounding Ohio (Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and West Virginia).  Organizers plan to hold the event at a national level by year six, and an international level by year ten.&lt;ref&gt;http://invitationalarts.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judging==
All divisions are judged by a panel including one (and only one) juror from each participating organization in that division.  Each piece, regardless of division or genre, is evaluated independently by each juror according to a [[Rubric (academic)|scoring rubric]] on a scale from 1 to 10 in each of three areas, ''[[creativity]]'', ''[[craft]]'' and ''depth''.  Scores for each piece are averaged by area, refactored to prevent juror bias and then multiplied to produce a final score between 1 and 1000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/life_and_entertainment/2012/09/16/invitational-showcases-appealing-area-works.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23756">[[File:Archeological excavations.jpg|thumb|Archeological excavation]]
The '''conservation and restoration of archaeological sites''' is the process of professionally protecting an archaeological site from further damage and restore it to a previous state. 
Archaeological sites require an extra level of care in regards to their conservation and restoration. Archaeology, even with through documentation, is a destructive force. This is because once a site has been even partially excavated, it cannot be put back the way it was, so in order to continue getting information from the site, it must be conserved to the current best standards.

==Life of a site==
According to Ashurst and Shalom, archaeological sites have several phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashurst|first1=John|last2=Shalom|first2=Asi|title=Reading 38: Short Story: The Demise, Discovery, Destruction and Salvation of a Ruin (2007) in "Archaeological Sites: Conservation and Management"|date=2012|publisher=The Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|page=353-364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''Creation of the Site:''' During this phase, the site is in use and has been established.
#'''Deterioration:''' After the site has been abandoned, natural forces take hold of the area and begin to weaken any structures that have been built. Animals also will burrow through the remnants, destroying floors, walls, and moving objects around. As walls and structures fall, they settle in different patterns and wind and water fill in the openings with dirt and dust.
#'''Identification:''' The site might be identified by archaeologists, or it might be identified by locals or other non-professionals. 
#'''Excavation:''' There are many ways that an excavation can take place. One is that locals or other interested people decide that they want to investigate themselves. Whether this is simply for pot hunting (illegal digging and collecting of artifacts) or as more of an actual attempt at amateur excavation, it can easily damage the site and regularly makes interpretation more difficult. Even when excavated by professionals, sometimes improper techniques or documentation can actually lead to further damage. If done properly, archaeological excavations will reveal many aspects, while still protecting others and detailed documentation takes place to allow the site to be virtually reconstructed as best as possible.
#'''Further Deterioration:''' If the site is then left open, there is a renewal of deterioration since areas are now re-exposed to the weather. 
#'''Ignorant Repair:''' There are many instances where people, with good intentions, attempt to conserve and repair a site. However, it results in more damage than assistance. Some ways that this happens is the use of inappropriate materials, inappropriate uses, as well as the lack of understanding of the original condition of the site (example: construction techniques, last used layout, et cetera). 
#'''Correct Conservation:''' In this instance, correct conservation materials and techniques are used in order to preserve the condition the site was found in, and in rare cases rebuild where things have fallen over. The basic goal, however, is simply to preserve how it was found.
#'''Reburial:''' In the case that the site cannot be properly preserved while in the open (due to funding or other reasons), one of the better conservation techniques is simply to rebury the site in order to protect it from further deterioration.&lt;ref name="Reburial"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Demas|first1=Martha|title="Site unseen": The Case for Reburial of Archaeological Sites|journal=Conservation and Management of Archaeological Sites|volume=6|issue=3-4|pages=137-154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these phases can be repeated and happen in a variety of orders.

==Dangers==
===Weathering===
The source of most damage is weather. Erosion through wind, rain, freeze-thaw, and evaporation are extremely common and other than covering the site entirely cannot be prevented. However, more dramatic factors are natural disasters: floods, fires, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, et cetera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meier|first1=Hans-Rudolf|last2=Petzet|first2=Michael|last3=Will|first3=Thomas|title=Cultural Heritage and Natural Disasters| date=2008|publisher=TUDpress|location=Germany|url=http://www.international.icomos.org/risk/2007/natural_disasters/HR_Special_2007_Disasters_ebook_20091116.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best way to protect archaeological sites from these larger events is to formulate a [[risk management]] plan. The basics of this are to first identify what threatens the site the most and then determine its susceptibility to it. This plan will be much like that for any structure or area, the only difference is that there are no codes that must be upheld.

An example of how some locations are dealing with this is in Florida, where they have faced many floods as well as soil erosion. A technique they have been putting into effect is easements in order to protect the archaeological sites from this risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation Easements|url=http://dos.myflorida.com/historical/archaeology/cultural-resource-protection/conservation-easements/|website=Florida Division of Historical Resources|publisher=Florida Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
[[File:Phoenix-Pueblo Grande Ruin-Hohokam Village-2.JPG|thumb|Pueblo Grande Ruin-Hohokam Village. Note the buildings in the background; this is in downtown Phoenix, Arizona.]]
An unfortunate risk to archaeological sites is development itself. As the world continues to develop and build new buildings and roadways, many times archaeological sites are damaged. An example of this is in Arizona. There was an Ancient Puebloan site that dates to A.D. 900-1350 was damaged by construction activities while putting in a new road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeMar|first1=David|title=The Result of a Damage Assessment and Limited Data Recovery Conducted at Site AZ-P-43-22 Located Near Pine Springs Wide Ruins Chapter, Fort Defiance Agency, Apache County, Arizona|date=May 15, 1996|publisher=San Juan County Museum Association|location=Farmington, NM}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the damage was assessed, it was determined that the site is not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. However, this determination was made because there is not enough remaining for it to be of any "information important in prehistory or history."

While development cannot be discontinued simply to protect archaeological sites, having a basic understanding of what might be impacted before development takes place could help protect sites and at least the information they can provide. The Arizona Antiquities Act of 1960 is an example of some ways in which archaeological sites can be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haury|first1=Emil|title=The Arizona Antiquities Act of 1960|journal=Kiva|volume=26|issue=1|pages=19-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vandalism===
Vandalism is also a prominent force of damage to archaeological sites. A range of actions can be considered, including graffiti, carving, deconstruction, and burning. These can be intentional or unintentional. Intentional vandalism is when visitors know that there is an archaeological site and yet still chose to harm it in some way. Unintentional vandalism happens when the visitor vandalizes while not realizing they are at an archaeological site.

An example of an unintentional vandalism is if someone is hunting small game and they see several rock around and decide to pile them up into a berm to shoot from behind. Unbeknownst to them, those rocks were not just naturally placed but actually a collapsed wall of an ancient building, with the majority of it underground. An example of intentional vandalism is graffiti. This can be considered intentional even if the visitors are unaware of the location being an archaeological site, because there is purposeful destruction even of a natural location. [[Tumamoc Hill]] in Tucson, Arizona has been subjected to this form of vandalism for centuries. Tumamoc Hill has a site on its top and has rock art all along the sides. It appears as though visitors throughout history have decided to join in on this tradition by adding their own initials and artwork.&lt;ref name="Tumamoc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartmann|first1=Gayle|last2=Boyle|first2=Peter|title=New Perspectives on the Rock Art and Prehistoric Settlement Organization of Tumamoc Hill, Tucson, Arizona|date=2013|publisher=Arizona State Museum, The University of Arizona|location=Tucson|isbn=978-1-889747-93-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to protect an archaeological site from vandalism, a combination of techniques needs to be used. The most important is education of the public. This isn't just in terms of explaining that vandalism is bad, but rather to also educate them on the importance of these sites and what can be lost if they do chose to vandalize the site. This can be as easily done as adding signage. Another strategy is to discourage the activity through adding barriers, patrols, or even full-time observation. Another vital way to help is to routinely survey the area in order to track changes. This technique can also assist in terms of weathering damage.&lt;ref name="Tumamoc" /&gt;

===War===
[[File:Taller Buddha of Bamiyan before and after destruction.jpg|thumb|Taller Buddha of Bamiyan before and after destruction ]]
Throughout history, war has also caused much destruction of archaeological and historical sites. The Nazis during World War II destroyed many buildings during the [[planned destruction of Warsaw]], including several palaces and other buildings dating back to before the 13th century. In more recent times, the Taliban destroyed the sacred Buddha statue in Afghanistan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rashid|first1=Ahmed|title=After 1,700 Years, Buddhas fall to Taliban dynamite|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/1326063/After-1700-years-Buddhas-fall-to-Taliban-dynamite.html|website=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ISIS YouTube videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perez|first1=Chris|title=ISIS ransacks museum, destroys 2,000-year-old artifacts|url=https://nypost.com/2015/02/26/isis-destroys-ancient-iraqi-artifacts/|website=New York Post|publisher=NYP Holdings, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevention of this is virtually impossible without large-scale efforts such as those done by the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]] that has become popularized by the 2014 movie ''[[The Monuments Men]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==People involved==
===Archaeologists===
The goal of archaeologists as well as other archaeological site conservators is "To preserve the physical remains of our past and to employ them in perpetuating our historical heritage."&lt;ref name="Arch" &gt;{{cite book|last1=South|first1=Stanley|title=The Role of the Archaeologist in the Conservation-Preservation Process in "Preservation and Conservation: Principles and Practices"|date=1976|publisher=The Preservation Press|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=35-43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way an archaeologist can assist in this is to be as thorough in their documentation as possible. This way, even if the site is physically destroyed, there are existing records of how it once was. It is also important that archaeologists use excavation techniques that impact the site as little as possible and saves features. A current technique used is that the entire site is not actually excavated, only parts that are viewed as being able to answer research questions the best.&lt;ref name="Arch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marshall|first1=John|title=Reading 9: Conservation Manual (1923) in "Archaeological Sites: Conservation and Management"|date=2012|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|pages=47-49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A previous technique used was to reconstruct walls and other features of the site in order to make it look more like it did when in use, however that has been mostly going out of style and instead the preservation of how the site was found is growing greater and greater in importance.

===Visitors===
Visitors hold a large responsibility in regards to archaeological site preservation. This goes beyond just vandalism. Even just their presence can be harmful for a site. An example of this happened at [[Recapture Canyon]] in Utah. In 2007, the United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) had to close access to the canyon to off-road vehicles due to the damage it was causing local archaeological sites.&lt;ref name="BLM"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crandall|first1=Megan|title=BLM Statement Regarding Proposed Illegal ATV Ride in Recapture Canyon|url=http://www.blm.gov/ut/st/en/info/newsroom/2014/may/blm_statement_regarding.html|website=BLM}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several visitors did not listen to this and actually created a wider trail through the canyon. Also, in May 2014 a large protest was held. This protest consisted of hundreds of protesters riding off-road vehicles through the canyon itself.&lt;ref name="BLM" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kuzmanic|first1=Joyce|title=Blanding: OHV riders, militia protest BLM ride through Recapture Canyon|url=http://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2014/05/10/jek-ohv-riders-militia-gather-protest-blm/#.VTFlM5MtwjU|publisher=St. George News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the large amount of people going through in such a short amount of time, it is very possible that the protest itself caused further damage.

In order to combat further damage, archaeological sites that are open to the public are given trails that do not actually impact the site while still giving visitors a good view of it. It is important for visitors to understand their own impact on archaeological sites they visit. If there is a designated path, they should remain on it. If they see artifacts, they can point to them and take pictures but not pick them up and move them.

===Conservators===
Conservators are the leaders in going the extra mile for archaeological site conservation. It is these specialists that need to formulate the largest and longest-lasting plan. Martha Demas has created a great outline that conservators can rely on in order to create the most impactful plan.&lt;ref name="Reburial" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Demas|first1=Martha|title=Reading 64: Planning of Conservation and Management of Archaeological Sites: A Values-Based Approach (2000) in "Archaeological Sites: Conservation and Management"|date=2012|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|pages=653-675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Periodic Review and Revision

==Techniques==
The purpose of any technique used on an archaeological site is to strengthen its ability to resist damage and/or reinstate its cultural significance and ability to teach about its history.

===Restoration===
Restoration is the "returning of the existing fabric of a place to a known earlier state by removing accretions or by reassembling existing components without the introduction of new material."&lt;ref name="Rest"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolfitt|first1=Catherine|title=Reading 51: Preventive Conservation of Ruins: Reconstruction, Reburial and Enclosure (2007) in "Archaeological Sites: Conservation and Management"|date=2012|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|pages=503-513}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest difficulty in this technique is the lack of introducing new material. Ideally, this is the primary technique to be used in order to strengthen the site from further damage.

===Reconstruction===
[[File:Pucllana Archaeological site - restoration.jpg|thumb|[[Huaca Pucllana]] Reconstruction Effort]]
Reconstruction is "returning a place to a known earlier state; distinguished from restoration by the introduction of new material into the fabric."&lt;ref name="Rest" /&gt; The aim of restoration is to "preserve and reveal the aesthetic and historic value of the monument and is based on respect for original material and authentic documents."&lt;ref name="ICOMOS"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Petzet|first1=Michael|title=International Charters for Conservation and Restoration|date=2004|publisher=ICOMOS|location=Germany|edition=2|url=http://openarchive.icomos.org/431/1/Monuments_and_Sites_1_Charters.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also debate on whether this is considered conservation work or not, due to potential miss use of that fact in order to over-reconstruct.&lt;ref name="Rest" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rest2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Price|first1=Nicholas|title=Reading 52: The Reconstruction of Ruins: Principles and Practices (2009) in "Archaeological Sites: Conservation and Management"|date=2012|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|pages=514-527}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appropriateness of this technique is highly dependent upon the region, the amount of known knowledge of the site itself, as well as the actual condition of the site. The older a site, the more difficult it is to be confident in the reconstruction. Reconstruction should also be identifiable upon inspection as well as reversible.&lt;ref name="Rest2" /&gt; A common form of reconstruction is the re-plastering of floors and walls. Due to weathering, the plaster that originally protected surfaces has eroded away and left the surfaces vulnerable. The re-plastering then adds that layer of protection back and in many cases was at least the same technique as originally even if it isn't exactly the same material.

===Recreation/renovation===
Recreation/renovation is the "speculative creation of a presumed earlier state on the basis of surviving evidence from that place to other sites, and on deductions drawn from that evidence using new materials."&lt;ref name="Rest" /&gt; This is the least favorable option as it is less likely to reinstate the originality of the site and many times includes the destruction of existing authentic materials in order to add new materials. It is deemed justifiable if it is the only form of effective conservation available. 
or if conservation measures prove to be unfeasible.&lt;ref name="ICOMOS" /&gt;

===Relocation===
[[File:Abusimbel.jpg|thumb|Mid-move of the Abu Simbel Temples]]
Relocation is a dramatic form of conservation which involves the physical movement of the site or part of the site itself.&lt;ref name="ICOMOS" /&gt; This should only take place if the site would be heavily damaged or even eliminated if it were to not be moved. A famous example of this is the move of the [[Abu Simbel temples]]. The movement of these temples was expensive as well as challenging, but if the move did not take place they would be completely underwater due to the construction of the [[Aswan High Dam]].

==Laws and policies==

'''Constitutionality''' is the condition of acting in accordance with an applicable [[constitution]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constitutionality |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425031213/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constitutionality |archivedate=2009-04-25 |df= }} "Webster On Line"&lt;/ref&gt; the status of a law, a procedure, or an act's accordance with the laws or guidelines set forth in the applicable constitution. When one of these (laws, procedures, or acts) directly violates the constitution, it is unconstitutional. All the rest are considered constitutional until challenged and declared otherwise.

== Applicability ==

An act (or ''[[statute]]'') enacted as [[law]] either by a national [[legislature]] or by the legislature of a subordinate level of government (such as a [[state (administrative division)|state]] or [[province]]) may be declared '''unconstitutional'''. 

However, governments do not just create laws.  Governments also enforce the laws set forth in the document defining the government—in the Constitution.  In the United States, the failure to seat duly elected representatives of the people following a proper election, or the failure to provide for such elections would be unconstitutional even in the absence of any legislated laws whatsoever.

When the proper court determines that a legislative act (a law) conflicts with the constitution, it finds that law unconstitutional and declares it void in whole or in part. This is called [[judicial review]]. The portion of the law declared void is considered ''struck down'', or the entire statute is considered struck from the statute books.

Depending on the type of legal system, a statute may be declared unconstitutional by any court, or only by special [[Constitution#Constitutional courts|Constitutional courts]] with authority to rule on the validity of a statute.
In some countries, the legislature may create any law for any purpose, and there is no provision for courts to declare a law unconstitutional. This can occur either because the country has no [[Codification (law)|codified]] constitution that laws must conform to (e.g., the [[United Kingdom]] and [[New Zealand]]) or because the constitution is codified but no court has the authority to strike down laws on the basis of it (e.g., the [[Netherlands]] and [[Switzerland]]).

In many jurisdictions the [[supreme court]] or [[Constitutional Court|constitutional court]] is the final legal arbiter that renders an opinion on whether a law or an action of a government official is constitutional.
Most constitutions define the powers of government.  Thus, national constitutions typically apply only to government actions.  This means that only governments can violate the nation's constitution, but there are exceptions.

A ''constitutional violation'' is thus somewhat different from the breaking of a normal [[law]], both in terms of seriousness and punishment.  Declaring a law unconstitutional does not result in the punishment of those who passed it down.

The legal encyclopedia ''[[American Jurisprudence]]'' says the following in regard to constitutionality:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The general rule is that an unconstitutional statute, though having the form and the name of law, is in reality no law, but is wholly void and ineffective for any purpose since unconstitutionality dates from the time of its enactment and not merely from the date of the decision so branding it; an unconstitutional law, in legal contemplation, is as inoperative as if it had never been passed ... An unconstitutional law is void. (16 Am. Jur. 2d, Sec. 178)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A law in violation of an existing statute can be described as unstatutable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/unstatutable|title=Unstatutable {{!}} Definition, meaning &amp; more {{!}} Collins Dictionary|website=[[CollinsDictionary.com]]|access-date=2016-08-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921063607/http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/unstatutable|archivedate=2016-09-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of unconstitutional actions ==
&lt;!--[[Unconstitutional]] and [[Unconstitutionality]] redirect here. If you rename or delete the section, please also update the redirects. --&gt;
An action that breaks any part of the constitution could range from minor to major. In the United Kingdom, this is more ambiguous because such breach covers those that violate principles, procedures or rights, making it difficult to establish what is unconstitutional from the constitutional. It is clearer in the case of the United States, which considers an act an infringement if it violates the spirit or the letter of the written constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding A/S Level Government Politics|last=Wilson|first=Christopher|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2003|isbn=0719060818|location=Manchester|pages=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some examples of unconstitutional actions can be:

* Actions by politician outside the powers of his constitutionally-established office;
* Actions on behalf of the government that prevent an individual from exercising constitutionally protected individual rights (such as the right to vote or to practice religion).  ''See [[McDonald v. City of Chicago]]''
* The suspension of habeas corpus, except in a state of emergency&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unconstitutional laws in the United States==
Much debate often surrounds controversial laws enacted by [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] and the [[United States Congress]] regarding the laws' constitutionality. Some of the controversialists against particular acts in the 19th century proposed protecting the people by applying the [[Principles of '98]]. [[Judicial review in the United States]], however, became the usual way to resolve such controversies.  Few people in the U.S. question the validity of this power and as a leading legal expert stated, "it is as clear as such matters can be that the Framers of the Constitution specifically, if tacitly, expected that the federal courts would assume a power... to pass on the constitutionality of actions of the Congress and the President."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Constitutional Law National Power and Federalism: Examples and Explanations|last=May|first=Christopher|last2=Ides|first2=Allan|last3=Grossi|first3=Simona|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|year=2007|isbn=0735562113|location=Austin|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judicial review also covers the evaluation of the constitutionality of the states' actions. It is even recognized that federal judges in the U.S. are elected for life to ensure their ability to engage in judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;May, Ides &amp; Grossi, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of laws that were declared unconstitutional in the United States include [[Roe v. Wade|Roe vs. Wade (1973)]], which declared the abortion laws in fifty U.S. states unconstitutional and the [[Brown v. Board of Education|Brown v. Board of Education (1954)]], which nullified racial segregation in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Judicial Politics in the United States|last=Miller|first=Mark|publisher=Westview Press|year=2015|isbn=9780813346809|location=Philadelphia|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different forms of constitutions. The United States Constitution is a "[[Rigid Constitution]]". Rigid constitutions cannot be modified in their express terms, except through such processes the constitution itself ordains.

The '''Faculty of Theology and Religion, University of Oxford''', co-ordinates the teaching of [[theology]] at the [[University of Oxford]], England. It is part of Oxford's [[Humanities Division, University of Oxford|Humanities Division]].

The Theology Faculty Centre was at 34 [[St Giles', Oxford|St Giles']] in central [[Oxford]]. It is now on the second floor of the Gibson Building in the [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] on [[Woodstock Road, Oxford|Woodstock Road]].

== History ==
One of the first series of lectures delivered at [[Oxford University]] was on theology.  As early as 1193, [[Alexander Neckam]] from [[St Albans]] gave biblical and moral lectures on the [[Psalms of David]] and the [[Wisdom of Solomon]]. One of the first university buildings was the [[Divinity School, Oxford|Divinity School]], begun in 1423 specifically for theology lectures.

The modern theological faculty emerges during the reform of the University of Oxford in the nineteenth century. The Final Honour School of Theology -  as a route to the Bachelor of Arts degree - was introduced in 1869. Up until then, theological study was the reserve of graduates and those seeking ordination in the [[Church of England]], who would attend a short series of lectures by the Regius Professors on basic divinity; its focus was on the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]], [[Joseph Butler]]'s ''Analogy of Religion'' and a knowledge of the [[Textus Receptus|Greek New Testament]]. Although an honour school in theology was recommended from as early as 1853, it was not until the late 1860s, amidst concerns about the declining influence of the Established Church in the university, that [[Edward Pusey]] and [[Henry Parry Liddon]] began to advocate the introduction of a separate School of Theology responsible for the training of Anglican ordinands. Its curriculum was biblical and historical in its focus, with its first examinations requiring knowledge of scripture, ecclesiastical history and patristics, dogmatic and symbolic theology, apologetics, liturgy and sacred criticism.

The faculty remained as a stronghold of the Church of England well into the 20th century, with denominatinal restrictions on the higher theological degrees (the Bachelor of Divinity and the Doctor of Divinity) and examiners in the Final Honour School of Theology only being abolished in 1920 and 1922 respectively. Still, three of the regius professorships are tied to canonries at [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford|Christ Church Cathedral]], requiring their holders to be in ordained in the Church of England or in a church in communion with the Church of England. A  significant proportion of the faculty's students are preparing for ordination, either as candidates for the B.A. or the B.Th.

Despite the faculty's historic obligations to the Church of England, the foundation of Nonconformist and Roman Catholic institutions in Oxford from the late 19th century onwards, alongside changing academic and ecclesiastical attitudes towards theological study, resulted in the gradual transformation of theology from a purely professional discipline into an aspect of humanistic study.

During the 20th century, Oxford established itself as an internationally significant centre of theological study with important contributions from [[S. R. Driver]], [[William Sanday (theologian)|William Sanday]], [[C. H. Turner]], [[Burnett Hillman Streeter|B. H. Streeter]], [[Norman Powell Williams|N.&amp;nbsp;P. Williams]], [[R. H. Lightfoot]], [[G. R. Driver]], [[Austin Farrer]], [[Maurice Wiles]], [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]], [[James Barr (biblical scholar)|James Barr]] and [[Arthur Peacocke]]. Although the department has, more recently, introduced examination papers in modern systematic theology, world religions and even separate postgraduate master's degrees in the study of religion, the Final Honour School of Theology remains primarily focused on biblical and historical study. Each undergraduate devotes at least half of his or her degree to the study of the Old Testament, New Testament, the development of Christian doctrine to AD 451 and modern Christian doctrine. Candidates can then choose four further papers from a wide selection of topics in biblical studies, history, doctrine and world religions.

==Professors==
===Statutory professorships===

The following statutory professorships are held in conjunction with a canonry of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]: the professor must be ordained in priest’s orders in the [[Church of England]] or in an [[Anglican church]] in communion with the Church of England, or eligible for and prepared to accept ordination.

{{Feminism sidebar}}

'''Feminist views on sexuality''' widely vary. Many feminists, particularly [[Radical feminism|radical feminists]], are highly critical of what they see as [[sexual objectification]] and [[sexual exploitation]] in the media and society. Radical feminists are often opposed to the [[sex industry]], including opposition to [[Feminist views on prostitution|prostitution]] and [[Feminist views on pornography|pornography]]. Other feminists define themselves as [[Sex-positive feminism|sex-positive feminists]] and believe that a wide variety of expressions of female sexuality can be [[Empowerment|empowering]] to women when they are [[Free will|freely chosen]]. Some feminists support efforts to reform the sex industry to become less [[Sexism|sexist]], such as the [[feminist pornography]] movement.

==Feminist sex wars==
{{Main|Feminist sex wars}}

The '''feminist sex wars''' and '''lesbian sex wars''', or simply the '''sex wars''' or '''porn wars''', were acrimonious debates amongst [[feminism|feminists]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The sides were characterized by anti-porn and pro-sex groups with disagreements regarding [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], sexual representation, [[pornography]], [[sadomasochism]], the role of [[trans woman|trans women]] in the lesbian community, and other sexual issues. The debate pitted [[Feminist views on pornography#Anti-pornography feminism|anti-pornography feminism]] against [[sex-positive feminism]], and the feminist movement was deeply divided as a result.&lt;ref name=Duggan&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Duggan, Lisa |author2=Hunter, Nan D. | title=Sex wars: sexual dissent and political culture | year=1995 | publisher=Routledge | location=New York  | isbn=0-415-91036-6 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{Cite book | author=Hansen, Karen Tranberg |author2=Philipson, Ilene J. | title=Women, class, and the feminist imagination: a socialist-feminist reader | year=1990 | publisher=Temple University Press | location=Philadelphia  | isbn=0-87722-630-X | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerhard&gt;{{Cite book | author=Gerhard, Jane F. | title=Desiring revolution: second-wave feminism and the rewriting of American sexual thought, 1920 to 1982 | year=2001 | publisher=Columbia University Press | location=New York  | isbn=0-231-11204-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leidholdt&gt;{{Cite book | author=Leidholdt, Dorchen | authorlink= Dorchen Leidholdt |author2=Raymond, Janice G | title=The Sexual liberals and the attack on feminism | year=1990 | publisher=Pergamon Press | location=New York  | isbn=0-08-037457-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vance&gt;{{Cite book | author=Vance, Carole S | title=Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality | publisher=Thorsons Publishers| isbn=0-04-440593-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feminist sex wars are sometimes viewed as part of the division that led to the end of the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist]] era and the beginning of [[third-wave feminism]].

The two sides included anti-pornography feminists and sex-positive feminists. One of the more significant clashes between the pro-sex and anti-pornography feminists occurred at the [[1982 Barnard Conference on Sexuality]]. Anti-pornography feminists were excluded from the events' planning committee, so they staged rallies outside the conference to show their disdain.&lt;ref name="McBride"&gt;{{cite web|last=McBride|first=Andrew|title=Lesbian History|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/lesbian.history/the_sex_wars}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminist criticism of sexual exploitation and the sex industry===
Many feminists denounce industries such as the sex industry as examples of misogynistic [[sexual exploitation|exploitation]]. Important anti-sex industry feminists included [[Andrea Dworkin]] and [[Catharine MacKinnon]]. The pair wanted civil laws restricting pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lesbian Sex Wars|url=http://glbt.com/social-sciences/lesbian_sex_wars.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; They viewed male sexual dominance as the root of all female oppression, and thus condemned pornography, prostitution, and other manifestations of male sexual power.&lt;ref name="McBride"/&gt; The anti-pornography movement gained ground with the creation of [[Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media]]. During the time of the sex wars, it organized marches against the creators and distributors of pornography in [[San Francisco]] and led to [[Women Against Pornography]], [[Feminists Fighting Pornography]], and similarly-oriented organizations and efforts across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McBride|first=Andrew|title=The Sex Wars, 1970s to 1980s|url=http://www.outhistory.org/wiki/The_Sex_Wars,_1970s_to_1980s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex-positive feminism===
{{Main|Sex-positive feminism}}
The response by "sex-positive feminists" was one that promoted sex as an avenue of pleasure for women.  [[Gayle Rubin]] and [[Patrick Califia]] were influential in this part of the movement.&lt;ref name="McBride"/&gt; Other feminists who identify as "sex-positive" include [[Ellen Willis]], [[Kathy Acker]], [[Susie Bright]], [[Carol Queen]], [[Annie Sprinkle]], [[Avedon Carol]], [[Tristan Taormino]], [[Rachel Kramer Bussel]], [[Nina Hartley]], and [[Betty Dodson]].

===Feminism and pornography===
{{Main|Feminist views on pornography}}
Feminist views of pornography range from condemnation of [[pornography]] as a form of [[violence against women]], to an embracing of some forms of pornography as a medium of feminist expression. Feminist debate on this issue reflects larger concerns surrounding feminist views on sexuality, and is closely related to [[feminist views on prostitution|feminist debates on prostitution]], [[Feminist views on BDSM|BDSM]], and other issues. Pornography has been one of the most divisive issues in [[feminism]], particularly among feminists in Anglophone countries.

====Anti-pornography feminism====
Radical feminist opponents of pornography—such as [[Andrea Dworkin]], [[Catharine MacKinnon]], [[Robin Morgan]], [[Diana E. H. Russell|Diana Russell]], [[Alice Schwarzer]], [[Gail Dines]], and [[Robert W. Jensen|Robert Jensen]]—argue that pornography is harmful to women, and constitutes strong causality or facilitation of violence against women. Anti-pornography feminists, notably MacKinnon, charge that the production of pornography entails physical, psychological, and/or economic [[coercion]] of the women who perform and model in it. This is said to be true even when the women are being presented as enjoying themselves.&lt;ref name="stanford-shrage"&gt;Shrage, Laurie. (2007-07-13). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-sex-markets/#Por "Feminist Perspectives on Sex Markets: Pornography"].

''Toward a Feminist Theory of the State'' Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-89645-9}} (1st ed), {{ISBN|0-674-89646-7}} (2nd ed). "Sex forced on real women so that it can be sold at a profit to be forced on other real women; women's bodies trussed and maimed and raped and made into things to be hurt and obtained and accessed, and this presented as the nature of women; the coercion that is visible and the coercion that has become invisible—this and more grounds the feminist concern with pornography"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{Cite episode| title = A Conversation With Catharine MacKinnon (transcript)| series = [[Think Tank]]|network= PBS| accessdate = 2009-09-01| year = 1995| url = https://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript215.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that much of what is shown in pornography is abusive by its very nature. [[Gail Dines]] holds that pornography, exemplified by [[Point of view pornography|gonzo pornography]], is becoming increasingly violent and that women who perform in pornography are brutalized in the process of its production.&lt;ref&gt;Dines, Gail.

Even porn industry people commented in a recent article in Adult Video News, that gonzo porn is taking its toll on the women, and the turnover is high because they can't stand the brutal acts on the body for very long."&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-pornography feminists hold the view that pornography contributes to [[sexism]], arguing that in pornographic performances the actresses are reduced to mere receptacles—objects—for sexual use and abuse by men. They argue that the narrative is usually formed around men's pleasure as the only goal of sexual activity, and that the women are shown in a subordinate role. Some opponents believe pornographic films tend to show women as being extremely passive, or that the acts which are performed on the women are typically abusive and solely for the pleasure of their sex partner.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} On-face ejaculation and anal rape are increasingly popular among men, following trends in porn.&lt;ref name="GailDines-JulieBindel-PornIndustry"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/02/gail-dines-pornography Bindel, Julie, ''The Truth About the Porn Industry: Gail Dines, the Author of an Explosive New Book About the Sex Industry, on Why Pornography Has Never Been a Greater Threat to Our Relationships'', in ''The'' (U.K.) ''Guardian'', Jul. 2, 2010, section ''Life &amp; Style'', subsection ''Women''], as accessed Jul. 17, 2010 (Wikipedia has an article about [[Julie Bindel]]).&lt;/ref&gt; MacKinnon and Dworkin defined pornography as "the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures or words".&lt;ref name="mackinnon-fu"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harvard University Press.

====Anti-censorship and pro-pornography feminists====
Pornography is seen as being a medium for women's sexual expression in this view. Sex-positive feminists view many [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]] views on sexuality, including views on pornography, as being as oppressive as those of [[patriarchal]] religions and ideologies, and argue that anti-pornography feminist discourse ignores and trivializes women's sexual agency. [[Ellen Willis]] (who coined the term "pro-sex feminism") states "As we saw it, the claim that 'pornography is violence against women' was code for the neo-Victorian idea that men want sex and women endure it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| edition = 50th Anniversary special| last = Willis| first = Ellen.| title = Lust Horizons: The 'Voice' and the women's movement| work = [[Village Voice]]| accessdate = 2009-09-02| date = 2005-10-18| url = http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-10-18/specials/lust-horizons/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex-positive feminists take a variety of views towards existing pornography. Many sex-positive feminists see pornography as subverting many traditional ideas about women that they oppose, such as ideas that women do not like sex generally, only enjoy sex in a relational context, or that women only enjoy [[vanilla sex]]. They also argue that pornography sometimes shows women in sexually dominant roles and presents women with a greater variety of body types than are typical of mainstream entertainment and fashion.

Many feminists regardless of their views on pornography are opposed on principle to censorship. Even many feminists who see pornography as a sexist institution, also see censorship (including MacKinnon's civil law approach) as an evil. In its mission statement, [[Feminists for Free Expression]] argues that censorship has never reduced violence, but historically been used to silence women and stifle efforts for social change. They point to the birth control literature of [[Margaret Sanger]], the feminist plays of [[Holly Hughes (performance artist)|Holly Hughes]], and works like ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]'' and ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'' as examples of feminist sexual speech which has been the target of censorship. FFE further argues that the attempt to fix social problems through censorship, "divert[s] attention from the substantive causes of social ills and offer a cosmetic, dangerous 'quick fix.'" They argue that instead a free and vigorous [[marketplace of ideas]] is the best assurance for achieving feminist goals in a democratic society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Feminists For Free Expression: Mission |accessdate=2009-09-02 |url=http://www.ffeusa.org/html/mission/index.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026144507/http://www.ffeusa.org/html/mission/index.php |archivedate=2013-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, some feminists such as [[Wendy Kaminer]], while opposed to pornography are also opposed to legal efforts to censor or ban pornography. In the late 1970s, Kaminer worked with [[Women Against Pornography]], where she advocated in favor of private [[consciousness raising]] efforts and against legal efforts to censor [[pornography]]. She contributed a chapter to the anti-pornography anthology, ''Take Back the Night'', wherein she defended [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] freedoms and explained the dangers of seeking legal solutions to the perceived problem of pornography. She opposed efforts by [[Catharine MacKinnon]] and [[Andrea Dworkin]] to define pornography as a civil rights violation, and she critiqued the pro-censorship movement in a 1992 article in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' entitled "Feminists Against the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]."&lt;ref&gt;Kaminer, Wendy [https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199211/feminism-censorship Feminists Against the First Amendment], ''[[The Atlantic]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Feminist pornography=====
{{Main|Feminist pornography}}
Feminist pornography is [[pornography]] that is produced by and with feminist women. It is a small but growing segment of the [[pornography industry]]. According to [[Tristan Taormino]], "Feminist porn both responds to dominant images with alternative ones and creates its own iconography."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Vogels| first = Josey.| title = Female-friendly porn| work = Metro| accessdate = 2012-07-14| date = 2009-04-21| url = http://metronews.ca/news/159072/female-friendly-porn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They defend their decision to perform in pornography as freely chosen, and argue that much of what they do on camera is an expression of their sexuality. It has also been pointed out that in pornography, women generally earn more than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Faludi|Faludi, Susan]]. (2000).

The Swedish director and feminist Suzanne Osten voiced scepticism that "feminist pornography" actually exists, referring to her belief that pornography is inherently objectifying and that feminist pornography would therefore constitute an [[oxymoron]].&lt;ref&gt;Curman, Sofia, ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'', "[http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/film-tv/porr-for-feminister-1.940378 Porr för feminister?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326202518/http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/film-tv/porr-for-feminister-1.940378 |date=2010-03-26 }}".

===Feminism and prostitution===
{{Main|Feminist views on prostitution}}
As with many issues within the feminist movement, there exists a diversity of opinions regarding [[prostitution]]. Many of these positions can be loosely arranged into an overarching standpoint that is generally either critical or supportive  of prostitution and [[sex work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Neill |first=Maggie |year=2001 |title=Prostitution and Feminism |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge |pages=14–16 |isbn=0-7456-1204-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-prostitution feminists hold that prostitution is a form of exploitation of women and male dominance over women, and a practice which is the result of the existing patriarchal societal order. These feminists argue that prostitution has a very negative effect, both on the prostitutes themselves and on society as a whole, as it reinforces stereotypical views about women, who are seen as sex objects which can be used and abused by men. Other feminists hold that prostitution and other forms of [[sex work]] can be valid choices for women and men who choose to engage in it. In this view, prostitution must be differentiated from forced prostitution, and feminists should support [[sex workers' rights|sex worker activism]] against abuses by both the sex industry and the legal system. The disagreement between these two feminist stances has proven particularly contentious, and may be comparable to the [[feminist sex wars]] of the late twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alexander |first=Priscilla |year=1997 |chapter=Feminism, Sex Workers and Human Rights |editor-last=Nagle |editor-first=Jill |title=Whores and Other Feminists |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |pages=83–90 |isbn=0-415-91821-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anti-prostitution feminism====
A proportion of feminists are strongly opposed to prostitution,  as they see the practice as a form of violence against women, which should not be tolerated by society. Feminists who hold such views on prostitution include [[Kathleen Barry]], [[Melissa Farley]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/faq/000008.html Prostitution: Factsheet on Human Rights Violations].

These feminists argue that, in most cases, prostitution is not a conscious and calculated choice. They say that most women who become prostitutes do so because they were forced or coerced by a pimp or by human trafficking, or, when it is an independent decision, it is generally the result of extreme poverty and lack of opportunity, or of serious underlying problems, such as drug addiction, past trauma (such as child sexual abuse) and other unfortunate circumstances. These feminists point out that women from the lowest socioeconomic classes—impoverished women, women with a low level of education, women from the most disadvantaged racial and ethnic minorities—are overrepresented in prostitution all over the world. "If prostitution is a free choice, why are the women with the fewest choices the ones most often found doing it?" (MacKinnon, 1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Catharine MacKinnon argues that "In prostitution, women have sex with men they would never otherwise have sex with. The money thus acts as a form of force, not as a measure of consent. It acts like physical force does in rape." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpbn.org/program/intelligence-squared/episode/its-wrong-pay-sex |title=It's Wrong to Pay for Sex |date=5 August 2009 |work= |publisher=Connecticut Public Radio |accessdate=8 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625230257/http://www.cpbn.org/program/intelligence-squared/episode/its-wrong-pay-sex |archivedate=25 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some anti-prostitution scholars hold that true consent in prostitution is not possible. Barbara Sullivan says, ''"In the academic literature on prostitution there are very few authors who argue that valid consent to prostitution is possible. Most suggest that consent to prostitution is impossible or at least unlikely''.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/sullivan.rtf |title=Rethinking Prostitution and 'Consent' |author=SULLIVAN, Barbara |publisher= |accessdate=2010-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914105702/http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/sullivan.rtf |archivedate=2009-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "''(...) most authors suggest that consent to prostitution is deeply problematic if not impossible (...) most authors have argued that consent to prostitution is impossible. For radical feminists this is because prostitution is always a coercive sexual practice. Others simply suggest that economic coercion makes the sexual consent of sex workers highly problematic if not impossible...''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FSjEnDrb8QcC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=%22consent+to+prostitution%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JsROF3MzX_&amp;sig=T13jLDZ1GwVtVZ6Ynrgxwhk0YoY&amp;hl=ro&amp;ei=GVxLSrr8OMyOsAbnpai6BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22consent%20to%20prostitution%22&amp;f=false |title=Making sense of sexual consent |first1=De Mark |last1=Cowling |first2=Paul |last2=Reynolds |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, abolitionists believe no person can be said to truly consent to their own oppression and no people should have the right to consent to the oppression of others.  In the words of [[Kathleen Barry]], consent is not a "good divining rod as to the existence of oppression, and consent to violation is a fact of oppression.  Oppression cannot effectively be gauged according to the degree of "consent," since even in slavery there was some consent, if consent is defined as inability to see, or feel any alternative." &lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;Barry, K "The Prostitution of Sexuality: The Global Exploitation of Women" New York: NYU Press 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pro-sex work and pro-sex worker's rights feminists====
Unlike those feminists critical of prostitution, pro-sex work perspectives do not concede that prostitution sexual acts have an inherent element of coercion, exploitation, and domination. As such, pro-sex feminists instead assert that sex-work can be a positive experience for women who have employed their autonomy to make an informed decision to engage in prostitution.

Many feminists, particularly those associated with the [[sex workers' rights]] movement or [[sex-positive feminism]], argue that the act of selling sex need not inherently be exploitative; but that attempts to abolish prostitution, and the attitudes that lead to such attempts, lead to an abusive climate for sex workers that must be changed. In this view, prostitution, along with other forms of [[sex work]], can be valid choices for the women and men who engage in it. This perspective has led to the rise since the 1970s of an international sex workers' rights movement, comprising organizations such as [[COYOTE]], the [[International Prostitutes Collective]], the [[Sex Workers Outreach Project]], and other [[:Category:Sex worker organizations|sex worker rights groups]].

An important argument advanced by pro-sex work feminists such as Carol Queen highlights that all too often feminists who are critical of prostitution have failed to adequately consider the viewpoints of women who are themselves engaged in sex work, choosing instead to base their arguments in theory and outdated experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Nagle, Jill [ed.] (2001) ''Whores and Other Feminists''. Routledge: New York pg. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists who do not support the radical anti-prostitution view, argue that there are serious problems with the anti-prostitution position, one of which is that, according to Sarah Bromberg, "it evolves from a political theory that is over-verbalized, generalized, and too often uses stereotypical notions of what a prostitute is. The radical [anti-prostitution] feminist views are ... not always delineated sufficiently to support a credible theory that prostitution degrades all women".&lt;ref&gt;Feminist Issues In Prostitution. Sarah Bromberg. http://www.feministissues.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Pro-sex work feminists say that the sex industry is not a "monolith", that it is large and varied, that people are sex workers for many different reasons, and that it is unproductive to target prostitution as an institution. Instead, they believe things should be done to improve the lives of the people within the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=7 Key American Sex Worker Activist Projects. | author=Audacia Ray in Feministe. | url=http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2009/07/29/7-key-american-sex-worker-activist-projects/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminism and stripping===

[[Image:Lusty Lady marquee.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Marquee of the now defunct Seattle Lusty Lady, [[Thanksgiving]] 2005]]

Others feminists believe that stripping can be sexually empowering and feminist.

==Feminism and BDSM==
{{Main|Feminist views on BDSM}}
'''Feminist Views on BDSM''' vary widely from rejection to acceptance and all points in between.  As an example, the two polarizing frameworks are being compared here. The history between feminists and [[BDSM]] practitioners has been controversial.  The two most extreme positions are those who believe that feminism and BDSM are mutually exclusive beliefs, and those who believe that BDSM practices are an expression of sexual freedom.

===Feminist opposition to BDSM and sadomasochism===
A number of radical feminists, such as [[Andrea Dworkin]] and [[Susan Griffin]], regard [[BDSM]] as a form of [[violence against women|woman-hating violence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffen|first=Susan|title="Sadomasochism and the Erosion of Self:A Critical Reading of Story of O" in [[Against Sadomasochism: A Radical Feminist Analysis]]|year=1982|location=East Palo Alto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dworkin|first=Andrew|title=Woman Hating|year=1974|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''[[Against Sadomasochism: A Radical Feminist Analysis]]'' includes essays and interviews from numerous feminists who criticize sadomasochism, including [[Alice Walker]], [[Robin Morgan]], [[Kathleen Barry]], [[Diana E. H. Russell]], [[Susan Star]], [[Ti-Grace Atkinson]], [[John Stoltenberg]], [[Sarah Hoagland]], [[Susan Griffin]], [[Cerridwen Fallingstar]], [[Audre Lorde]], and [[Judith Butler]]. Feminist organizations that publicly opposed S/M/ include [[Lavender Menace]], the [[New York Radical Feminists]] (NYRF), [[Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media]]. In 1982, a leaflet was produced by the "Coalition for a Feminist Sexuality and Against Sadomasochism", an ad-hoc coalition put together by [[Women Against Pornography]] to protest the [[Feminist Sex Wars|Barnard Conference]]. The NYRF's NYRF was listed among the signatories to the leaflet.&lt;ref&gt;Abelove H, et al. (1983). "The Barnard Conference". ''Feminist Studies'' 9(1):177–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro-BDSM and BDSM-practicing feminists===
While many radical feminists are opposed to BDSM, other feminists view S/M as an ideal feminist expression of [[sexual freedom]] while other feminists say that BDSM, and more particularly SM, reinforce patriarchy and that these practices are contradictory to feminism. Additionally, some feminists are open about practicing BDSM.

==Feminism and celibacy==

The feminist group [[Cell 16]], founded in 1968 by [[Roxanne Dunbar]], was known for its program of [[celibacy]] and separation from men, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;Bevacqua, Maria.

''Feminist Theories and Social Work: Approaches and Applications'' (1996) {{ISBN|1-56024-945-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''No More Fun and Games'', the organization's radical feminist periodical, Cell Members Roxanne Dunbar and Lisa Leghorn advised women to "separate from men who are not consciously working for female liberation", but advised periods of celibacy, rather than lesbian relationships, which they considered to be "nothing more than a personal solution."&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, Leghorn. ''The Man's Problem'', from ''No More Fun and Games'', November 1969, quoted in Echols, 165&lt;/ref&gt; The periodical also published Dana Densmore's article "On Celibacy" (October 1968), which stated in part, "One hangup to liberation is a supposed 'need' for sex. It is something that must be refuted, coped with, demythified, or the cause of female liberation is doomed. Already we see girls, thoroughly liberated in their own heads, understanding their oppression with terrible clarity trying, deliberately and a trace hysterically, to make themselves attractive to men, men for whom they have no respect, men they may even hate, because of 'a basic sexual-emotional need.' Sex is not essential to life, as eating is. Some people go through their whole lives without engaging in it at all, including fine, warm, happy people. It is a myth that this makes one bitter, shriveled up, twisted. The big stigma of life-long virginity is on women anyway, created by men because woman's purpose in life is biological and if she doesn't fulfill that she's warped and unnatural and 'must be all cobwebs inside.'" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/scriptorium/wlm/fun-games1/#celibacy|title=No More Fun and Games: a Journal of Female Liberation (v. 1, no. 1)|work=Duke Digital Collections|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Feminists]], also known as Feminists—A Political Organization to Annihilate Sex Roles, was a radical feminist group active in New York City from 1968 to 1973; it at first advocated that women practice celibacy, and later came to advocate [[political lesbianism]]. [[Political lesbianism]] embraces the theory that [[sexual orientation]] is a choice, and advocates [[lesbian]]ism as a positive alternative to [[heterosexuality]] for women.&lt;ref name="Location, location, orientation"&gt;Julie Bindel, [https://www.theguardian.com/weekend/story/0,3605,1177708,00.html Location, location, orientation], ''[[The Guardian]]'',  March 27, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheila Jeffreys]] helped develop the concept by co-writing with other members of the [[Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group]] a pamphlet titled ''Love Your Enemy?: The Debate Between Heterosexual Feminism and Political Lesbianism'', which stated, "We do think... that all feminists can and should be lesbians. Our definition of a political lesbian is a woman-identified woman who does not fuck men. It does not mean compulsory sexual activity with women."&lt;ref name="docs.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3dD4VR6trTUMzYzZTExNmMtY2FlMC00MjlhLTg1ZjItYjFhNGMzMWNlMGIx/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CN6ixb8C&amp;pli=1 |title=Love Your Enemy? The Debate Between Heterosexual Feminism and Political Lesbianism |publisher=Onlywomen Press: [[Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group]] |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, some political lesbians chose to be celibate or identified as [[asexuality|asexual]].

In April 1987 the manifesto of the Southern Women's Writing Collective, titled ''[http://sisyphe.org/imprimer.php3?id_article=4127 Sex resistance in heterosexual arrangements: Manifesto of the Southern Women's Writing Collective]'' was read in New York City at a conference called "The Sexual Liberals and the Attack on Feminism".&lt;ref name="Sisyphe http://sisyphe.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sisyphe.org/imprimer.php3?id_article=4127|title=Sisyphe|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This manifesto stated in part, "In contrast to the pro-sex movement, we are calling ourselves Women Against Sex (WAS)...The sex resister understands her act as a political one: her goal is not only personal integrity for herself but political freedom for all women. She resists on three fronts: she resists all male-constructed sexual needs, she resists the misnaming of her act as prudery and she especially resists the patriarchy's attempt to make its work of subordinating women easier by consensually constructing her desire in its own oppressive image." &lt;ref name="Sisyphe http://sisyphe.org"/&gt;
   
In 1991 feminist activist [[Sonia Johnson]] wrote in her book ''The Ship That Sailed into the Living Room: Sex and Intimacy Reconsidered'', "Nearly four years after I began my rebellion against relation/sex/slave Ships, experience and my Wise Old Woman are telling me that sex as we know it is a patriarchal construct and ''has'' no rightful, natural place in our lives, no authentic function or ways. Synonymous with hierarchy/control, sex is engineered as part of the siege against our wholeness and power." &lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Sonia.

==Feminism and sexual orientation==
{{Main|Feminist views on sexual orientation}}
{{See also|Gender roles in non-heterosexual communities#Feminism}}
Feminist approaches to the issue of [[sexual orientation]] widely vary. Feminist views on sexual orientation are often influenced by the personal experiences of feminists, as expressed in the feminist slogan "[[Carol Hanisch|the personal is political]]." Because of this, many feminists view sexual orientation is a political issue and not merely a matter of individual sexual choice or preference.

===Feminism and asexuality===
A 1977 paper titled ''[[Asexuality|Asexual]] and Autoerotic Women: Two Invisible Groups'', by Myra T. Johnson, may be the first paper explicitly devoted to asexuality in humans. In it Johnson portrays asexual women as invisible, "oppressed by a consensus that they are nonexistent," and left behind by both the [[sexual revolution]] and the feminist movement.&lt;ref&gt;"Asexual and Autoerotic Women: Two Invisible Groups" found in ed. Gochros, H.L.; J.S. Gochros (1977). ''The Sexually Oppressed. Associated Press.'' {{ISBN|978-0-8096-1915-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 paper written by [[Karli June Cerankowski]] and Megan Milks, titled ''New Orientations: Asexuality and Its Implications for Theory and Practice'', states that society has deemed "[LGBT and] female sexuality as empowered or repressed. The asexual movement challenges that assumption by challenging many of the basic tenets of [[pro-sex feminism]] [in which it is] already defined as repressive or anti-sex sexualities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Myers|first=David G.|title=Psychology|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4292-1597-8|page=474|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[political lesbianism|political lesbians]] identify as asexual. Political lesbianism embraces the theory that sexual orientation is a choice, and advocates [[lesbian]]ism as a positive alternative to [[heterosexuality]] for women.&lt;ref name="Location, location, orientation"/&gt; [[Sheila Jeffreys]] helped develop the concept by co-writing with other members of the [[Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group]] a pamphlet titled ''Love Your Enemy?: The Debate Between Heterosexual Feminism and Political Lesbianism'' which stated, "We do think... that all feminists can and should be lesbians. Our definition of a political lesbian is a woman-identified woman who does not fuck men. It does not mean compulsory sexual activity with women."&lt;ref name="docs.google.com"/&gt;

===Feminism and bisexuality===
The lesbian quarterly ''[[Common Lives/Lesbian Lives]]'' had a policy that all work published in CL/LL was produced by self-defined lesbians, and all of the project's volunteers were lesbians. Due to this policy, a complaint was filed with the [[University of Iowa]] [[Human Rights Commission]] by a bisexual woman whose submission to the magazine was not published.&lt;ref name="sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/iwa/findingaids/html/CommonlIves.html |title=Common Lives/Lesbian Lives Records, Iowa Women's Archives, University of Iowa Libraries, Iowa City, Iowa |publisher= |accessdate=29 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821003341/http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/iwa/findingaids/html/CommonLives.html |archivedate=21 August 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of women who were at one time involved in lesbian-feminist activism have since [[Coming out|come out]] as bisexual after realizing their attractions to men. A widely studied example of lesbian-bisexual conflict within feminism was the Northampton Pride March during the years between 1989 and 1993, where many feminists involved debated over whether bisexuals should be included and whether or not bisexuality was compatible with feminism. Common lesbian-feminist critiques leveled at bisexuality were that bisexuality was [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]], that bisexuality was a form of [[false consciousness]], and that bisexual women who pursue relationships with men were "deluded and desperate." However, tensions between bisexual feminists and lesbian feminists have eased since the 1990s, as bisexual women have become more accepted within the feminist community.&lt;ref name="Gerstner 2006"&gt;{{cite book |title= Routledge International Encyclopedia of Queer Culture|last= Gerstner|first= David A.|year= 2006|publisher= [[Routledge]]|location= United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-415-30651-5|page= |pages= 82–3|accessdate=October 3, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XS_SnVPixE8C&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=%22bisexual+feminism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n32nIC-3XC&amp;sig=h7jkH9Tq2dtkR0gs9Q7hmvNMzZ4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zrdsUIKQLeWC0QHKqYHwAQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, some lesbian feminists such as [[Julie Bindel]] are still critical of bisexuality. Bindel has described female bisexuality as a "fashionable trend" being promoted due to "sexual hedonism" and broached the question of whether bisexuality even exists.&lt;ref name="Bindel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julie-bindel/where-is-the-politics-in-_b_1589435.html |title=Where's the Politics in Sex? |publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]'' |accessdate=2012-10-03 |first=Julie |last=Bindel |date=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also made [[tongue-in-cheek]] comparisons of bisexuals to [[Animal fancy|cat fanciers]] and [[Satanism|devil worshippers]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/08/lesbianism |title=It's not me.

===Feminism and gay men===
In her 2003 book ''Unpacking Queer Politics: A Lesbian Feminist Perspective'', Australian radical lesbian feminist [[Sheila Jeffreys]] advances the position that [[lesbian]] culture has been negatively affected by emulating the [[sexism|sexist]] influence of the gay male subculture of [[BDSM|dominant/submissive]] sexuality. While she stresses that many gay men who were members of the [[gay liberation]] movement repudiated [[sadomasochism]], she writes that the dominant gay male perspective has promoted sadomasochistic sexuality to the detriment of lesbians and feminist women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Unpacking Queer Politics: A Lesbian Feminist Perspective|last= Jeffreys|first= Sheila|year= 2003|publisher= [[Polity (publisher)|Polity]]|location= Cambridge, England|isbn= 0-7456-2838-9|page= |pages= |url=}}&lt;!--|accessdate=October 3, 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some gay men such as [[Andrea Dworkin]]'s husband [[John Stoltenberg]] are also critical of [[sadomasochism]] and [[pornography]] and agree with the radical feminist and lesbian feminist criticisms of these practices. Stoltenberg wrote that sadomasochism eroticizes both violence and powerlessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Stoltenberg|first1= John|authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= Robin Ruth|editor1-last= Linden|editor1-link= |others= |title= [[Against Sadomasochism: A Radical Feminist Analysis]]|trans-title=|url= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |year= 1982|origyear= |publisher= Frog in the Well|location= East Palo Alto, Calif|isbn= 0-9603628-3-5|oclc= 7877113|doi= |id= |page= |pages= 124–30|at= |trans-chapter=|chapter= Sadomasochism: Eroticized Violence, Eroticized Powerlessness|chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |author-mask= |author-name-separator= |author-separator= |display-authors= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gay [[Pro-feminism|pro-feminist]] author Christopher N.

===Feminism and heterosexuality===
Some heterosexual feminists believe that they have been unfairly excluded from lesbian feminist organizations. The lesbian quarterly ''[[Common Lives/Lesbian Lives]]'' had a policy that all work published in CL/LL was produced by self-defined lesbians, and all of the project's volunteers were lesbians. Due to this policy, a complaint was filed with the [[University of Iowa]] [[Human Rights Commission]] by a heterosexual woman who believed she was discriminated against when not hired to be an intern. A complaint was also lodged with the collective by a bisexual woman whose submission to the magazine was not published.&lt;ref name="sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu"/&gt;

Lesbians have been active in the mainstream American feminist movement. The first time lesbian concerns were introduced into the [[National Organization for Women]] came in 1969, when [[Ivy Bottini]], an open lesbian who was then president of the New York chapter of the [[National Organization for Women]], held a public forum titled "Is Lesbianism a Feminist Issue?".&lt;ref name="bare_url_d"&gt;[[Barbara Love|Love, Barbara J.]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=kpNarH7t9CkC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=1968+lesbian+ivy+bottini&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4P7QT4ToGcXZ0QHIpdDqDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CFoQ6wEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=1968%20lesbian%20ivy%20bottini&amp;f=false Feminists Who Changed America, 1963–1975]&lt;/ref&gt; However, National Organization for Women president [[Betty Friedan]] was against lesbian participation in the movement. In 1969 she referred to growing lesbian visibility as a "lavender menace" and fired openly lesbian newsletter editor [[Rita Mae Brown]], and in 1970 she engineered the expulsion of lesbians, including [[Ivy Bottini]], from NOW's New York chapter.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Bonnie Zimmerman [https://books.google.com/books?id=0EUoCrFolGcC&amp;pg=PA134 Lesbian histories and cultures: an encyclopedia], Garland Pub., 2000 {{ISBN|0-8153-1920-7}} p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vicki Lynn Eaklor p. 145"&gt;Vicki Lynn Eaklor [https://books.google.com/books?id=qJZdHuZ0aM0C&amp;pg=PA145 Queer America: a GLBT history of the 20th century], ABC-CLIO, 2008 {{ISBN|0-313-33749-7}} p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction, at the 1970 Congress to Unite Women, on the first evening when all four hundred feminists were assembled in the auditorium, twenty women wearing T-shirts that read "Lavender Menace" came to the front of the room and faced the audience.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;Flora Davis [https://books.google.com/books?id=ioM-8naFn60C&amp;pg=PA264 Moving the mountain: the women's movement in America since 1960], University of Illinois Press, 1999 {{ISBN|0-252-06782-7}} p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; One of the women then read their group's paper "The Woman-Identified Woman", which was the first major lesbian feminist statement.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheshire Calhoun p. 27"&gt;Cheshire Calhoun [https://books.google.com/books?id=7V73W75tGssC&amp;pg=PA27 Feminism, the Family, and the Politics of the Closet: Lesbian and Gay Displacement], Oxford University Press, 2003 {{ISBN|0-19-925766-3}} p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The group, who later named themselves "Radicalesbians", were among the first to challenge the heterosexism of heterosexual feminists and to describe lesbian experience in positive terms.&lt;ref name="Carolyn Zerbe Enns p. 105"&gt;Carolyn Zerbe Enns [https://books.google.com/books?id=bIe7ZtOubc8C&amp;pg=PA105 Feminist theories and feminist psychotherapies: origins, themes, and diversity], Routledge, 2004 {{ISBN|0-7890-1808-X}} p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971 NOW passed a resolution declaring "that a woman's right to her own person includes the right to define and express her own sexuality and to choose her own lifestyle," as well as a conference resolution stating that forcing lesbian mothers to stay in marriages or to live a secret existence in an effort to keep their children was unjust.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://now.org/resource/now-leading-the-fight/ Leading the Fight | National Organization for Women].

State legislatures should reform their penal codes or repeal State laws that restrict private sexual behavior between consenting adults. State legislatures should enact legislation that would prohibit consideration of sexual or affectional orientation as a factor in any judicial determination of child custody or visitation rights. Rather, child custody cases should be evaluated solely on the merits of which party is the better parent, without regard to that person's sexual and affectional orientation." &lt;ref name="Plan of Action"&gt;[http://www.lindagriffith.com/IWY%20PlanofAction.html Plan of Action].

[[Del Martin]] was the first open lesbian elected to NOW, and [[Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon]] were the first lesbian couple to join NOW.&lt;ref name="ABOUTMARTIN"&gt;{{cite news |last=Belge |first=Kathy |url=http://lesbianlife.about.com/cs/herstory/p/DelMartin.htm |title=Del Martin |publisher=About |date= |accessdate=2007-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213073920/http://lesbianlife.about.com/cs/herstory/p/DelMartin.htm |archivedate=2007-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lesbian feminism]] is a cultural movement and political perspective, most influential in the 1970s and early 1980s (primarily in North America and Western Europe), that encourages women to direct their energies toward other women rather than men, and often advocates lesbianism as the logical result of feminism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrienne Rich|Rich, A]]. (1980). ''[[Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence]]''. Signs, 5, 631–660.&lt;/ref&gt; Some key thinkers and activists are [[Charlotte Bunch]], [[Rita Mae Brown]], [[Adrienne Rich]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Marilyn Frye]], [[Mary Daly]], [[Sheila Jeffreys]] and [[Monique Wittig]] (although the latter is more commonly associated with the emergence of [[queer theory]]). Lesbian feminism came together in the early 1970s out of dissatisfaction with [[second-wave feminism]] and the [[gay liberation movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Faderman, Lillian: "Surpassing the Love of Men," p. 17. Quill/William Morrow, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/modern/Old_and_New_Wave-Feminism.html Lesbianism and Feminism]. Accessed May 28th 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of radical lesbian feminist [[Sheila Jeffreys]], "Lesbian feminism emerged as a result of two developments: lesbians within the WLM [Women's Liberation Movement] began to create a new, distinctively feminist lesbian politics, and lesbians in the GLF ([[Gay Liberation Front]]) left to join up with their sisters".&lt;ref name="Jeffreys, Sheila p. 19"&gt;Jeffreys, Sheila: "Unpacking Queer Politics," p. 19. Polity, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Judy Rebick]], a leading Canadian journalist and political activist for feminism, lesbians were and always have been at the heart of the [[women's movement]], while their issues were invisible in the same movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.activism.uts.edu.au/conferences/rebick/discussion.html Research on International Activism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323092851/http://www.international.activism.uts.edu.au/conferences/rebick/discussion.html |date=2012-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lesbian separatism====
{{Main|Lesbian separatism}}
[[Lesbian separatism]] is a form of separatist feminism specific to lesbians. Separatism has been considered by lesbians as both a temporary strategy, and as a lifelong practice but mostly the latter.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Lesbian separatism became popular in the 1970s as some lesbians doubted whether mainstream society or even the LGBT movement had anything to offer them.

====Political lesbianism====
{{Main|Political lesbianism}}
Political lesbianism is a phenomenon within [[lesbian feminism]] and [[radical feminism]], primarily [[second-wave feminism]]. Political lesbianism embraces the theory that [[sexual orientation]] is a choice, and advocates [[lesbian]]ism as a positive alternative to [[heterosexuality]] for women.&lt;ref name="Location, location, orientation"/&gt;

Lesbian women who have identified themselves as "political lesbians" include [[Ti-Grace Atkinson]], [[Julie Bindel]], [[Charlotte Bunch]], [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Sheila Jeffreys]]. Jeffreys helped develop the concept by co-writing with other members of the [[Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group]] a pamphlet titled ''Love Your Enemy?: The Debate Between Heterosexual Feminism and Political Lesbianism'' which argued that women should abandon [[heterosexuality]] and choose to become lesbians as a feminist act. The pamphlet stated, "We do think... that all feminists can and should be lesbians. Our definition of a political lesbian is a woman-identified woman who does not fuck men. It does not mean compulsory sexual activity with women."&lt;ref name="docs.google.com"/&gt; Thus, some political lesbians choose to be celibate or identify as [[asexuality|asexual]].

===Biphobia and lesbophobia in feminism===
Common lesbian-feminist critiques leveled at bisexuality were that bisexuality was [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]], that bisexuality was a form of [[false consciousness]], and that bisexual women who pursue relationships with men were "deluded and desperate." However, tensions between bisexual feminists and lesbian feminists have eased since the 1990s, as bisexual women have become more accepted within the feminist community.&lt;ref name="Gerstner 2006"/&gt; Nevertheless, some lesbian feminists such as [[Julie Bindel]] are still critical of bisexuality. Bindel has described female bisexuality as a "fashionable trend" being promoted due to "sexual hedonism" and broached the question of whether bisexuality even exists.&lt;ref name="Bindel"/&gt; She has also made [[tongue-in-cheek]] comparisons of bisexuals to [[Animal fancy|cat fanciers]] and [[Satanism|devil worshippers]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;

Lesbian feminists initially faced discrimination in the [[National Organization for Women]]. Some heterosexual feminists such as [[Betty Friedan]] downplayed lesbian issues as not being central to feminist activism. In 1969 Friedan referred to growing lesbian visibility as a "lavender menace" and fired openly lesbian newsletter editor [[Rita Mae Brown]], and in 1970 she engineered the expulsion of lesbians, including [[Ivy Bottini]], from NOW's New York chapter.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vicki Lynn Eaklor p. 145"/&gt; In reaction, at the 1970 Congress to Unite Women, on the first evening when all four hundred feminists were assembled in the auditorium, twenty women wearing T-shirts that read "Lavender Menace" came to the front of the room and faced the audience.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; One of the women then read their group's paper "[[The Woman-Identified Woman]]", which was the first major lesbian feminist statement.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheshire Calhoun p. 27"/&gt; The group, who later named themselves "Radicalesbians", were among the first to challenge the heterosexism of heterosexual feminists and to describe lesbian experience in positive terms.&lt;ref name="Carolyn Zerbe Enns p. 105"/&gt; In 1971 NOW passed a resolution declaring "that a woman's right to her own person includes the right to define and express her own sexuality and to choose her own lifestyle," as well as a conference resolution stating that forcing lesbian mothers to stay in marriages or to live a secret existence in an effort to keep their children was unjust.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; That year NOW also committed to offering legal and moral support in a test case involving child custody rights of lesbian mothers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; In 1973 the NOW Task Force on Sexuality and Lesbianism was established.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; In November 1977 the [[National Women's Conference]] issued the [http://www.lindagriffith.com/IWY%20PlanofAction.html National Plan of Action], which stated in part, "Congress, State, and local legislatures should enact legislation to eliminate discrimination on the basis of sexual and affectional preference in areas including, but not limited to, employment, housing, public accommodations, credit, public facilities, government funding, and the military. State legislatures should reform their penal codes or repeal State laws that restrict private sexual behavior between consenting adults. State legislatures should enact legislation that would prohibit consideration of sexual or affectional orientation as a factor in any judicial determination of child custody or visitation rights. Rather, child custody cases should be evaluated solely on the merits of which party is the better parent, without regard to that person's sexual and affectional orientation." &lt;ref name="Plan of Action"/&gt;

Friedan eventually admitted that "the whole idea of homosexuality made me profoundly uneasy." &lt;ref name="LifeSoFar-pbk-1-1-p221"&gt;Friedan, Betty. ''Life So Far: A Memoir''. N.Y.: Simon &amp; Schuster (Touchstone Book), &amp;copy; 2000, pbk., 1st Touchstone ed. ({{ISBN|0-7432-0024-1}}) [1st printing?] 2001. Page 221.&lt;/ref&gt; and acknowledged that she had been very square and was uncomfortable about lesbianism. "The women's movement was not about sex, but about [[Equal Opportunity Employment|equal opportunity in jobs]] and all the rest of it. Yes, I suppose you have to say that [[Human female sexuality#Feminist concepts|freedom of sexual choice]] is part of that, but it shouldn't be the main issue ...."&lt;ref name="LifeSoFar-pbk-1-1-p223"&gt;Friedan, Betty. ''Life So Far'', op. cit. Page 223.&lt;/ref&gt; She ignored lesbians in the National Organization for Women initially and objected to what she saw as demands for equal time.&lt;ref name="LifeSoFar-pbk-1-1-p221" /&gt; "'Homosexuality ... is not, in my opinion, what the women's movement is all about.'"&lt;ref name="LifeSoFar-pbk-1-1-p222"&gt;Friedan, Betty. ''Life So Far'', op. cit. Page 222.&lt;/ref&gt; While opposing all repression, she wrote, she refused to wear a purple armband or self-identify as a lesbian (although [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]]) as an act of political solidarity, considering it not part of the mainstream issues of [[abortion]] and [[Childcare|child care]].&lt;ref name="LifeSoFar-pbk-1-1-p248-249"&gt;Friedan, Betty. ''Life So Far'', op. cit. Pp. 248&amp;ndash;249.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, at the National Women's Conference, she seconded the lesbian rights resolution "which everyone thought I would oppose" in order to "preempt any debate" and move on to other issues she believed were more important and less divisive in the effort to add the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] ([[Equal Rights Amendment|ERA]]) to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref name="LifeSoFar-pbk-1-1-p295"&gt;Friedan, Betty. ''Life So Far'', op. cit. Page 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American radical feminist group [[Redstockings]] were strongly opposed to [[lesbian separatism]], seeing interpersonal relationships with men as an important arena of feminist struggle, and hence seeing separatism as [[Escapism|escapist]]. Like many radical feminists of the time, Redstockings saw lesbianism primarily as a political identity rather than a fundamental part of personal identity, and therefore analyzed it primarily in political terms. Redstockings were also opposed to [[Gay|male homosexuality]], which they saw as a deeply [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] rejection of women. Redstockings' line on gay men and lesbians is often criticized as [[Homophobia|homophobic]].&lt;ref&gt;Echols, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminism and queer theory===
{{See also|Queer theory}}
Queer theory' is a field of [[post-structuralist]] [[critical theory]] that emerged in the early 1990s out of the fields of [[queer studies]] and [[women's studies]]. Queer theory has been heavily influenced by the work of feminists such as [[Gloria Anzaldúa]], [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]], and [[Judith Butler]]. Queer theory builds both upon [[feminist]] challenges to the idea that [[gender]] is part of the [[Essentialism|essential]] self and upon gay/lesbian studies' close examination of the [[Social construction|socially constructed]] nature of sexual [[Human sexual activity|acts]] and [[Sexual identity|identities]].

====Feminist application of queer theory====
Queer theory has been greatly influenced by [[feminist theory]] and women's studies. Many works have been written on the [[Intersectionality|intersection]] of feminism and queer theory and how both feminist persepectives can enrich [[LGBT]]Q theory and [[Queer studies|studies]] and how queer perspectives can enrich feminism. Books such as ''Feminism is Queer: The Intimate Connection Between Queer and Feminist Theory'' detail the intersections between queer and feminist theory and argue that feminism itself could be construed as a "[[queer]]" movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Feminism is Queer: The Intimate Connection Between Queer and Feminist Theory|last= Marinucci|first= Mimi|year= 2011|publisher= [[Zed Books]]|location= London, England|isbn= 1-84813-475-4|page= |pages= |url=}}&lt;!--|accessdate=September 28, 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Feminist criticism of queer theory====
Many feminists have critiqued queer theory as either a diversion from feminism issues or as a male-dominated backlash to feminism. Lesbian feminists and radical feminists have been the most prominent critics of queer theory and queer politics. [[Sheila Jeffreys]]' ''Unpacking Queer Politics: A Lesbian Feminist Perspective'' harshly criticizes queer theory as the product of "a powerful gay male culture" which "celebrated masculine privilege" and "enshrined a cult of masculinity." She repudiates queer theory as anti-lesbian, anti-feminist, and anti-women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Unpacking Queer Politics: A Lesbian Feminist Perspective|last= Jeffreys|first= Sheila|year= 2003|publisher= [[Polity (publisher)|Polity]]|location= Cambridge, England|isbn= 0-7456-2838-9|page= |pages=1–2 |url=}}&lt;!--|accessdate=October 3, 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist sexology==
{{Main|Feminist sexology}}
Feminist sexology is an offshoot of traditional studies of [[sexology]] that focuses on the [[intersectionality]] of [[sex]] and [[gender]] in relation to the [[sexual lives]] of [[women]]. [[Feminist]] sexology shares many principles with the overarching field of sexology; in particular, it does not try to prescribe a certain path or "normality" for women's sexuality, but only observe and note the different and varied ways in which women express their sexuality. It is a young field, but one that is growing rapidly. Notable feminist sexologists include [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]] and [[Gayle Rubin]].

A notable radical feminist work on women's sexuality is Anne Koedt's [[The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm]], which advances the claim that [[vaginal orgasm]] is a patriarchal myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/vaginalmyth.html |title=The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm |publisher=[[Chicago Women's Liberation Union|CWLU Herstory Archive]] |accessdate=2012-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106211856/http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/vaginalmyth.html |archivedate=2013-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminism and sexual violence==
{{See also|Rape culture}}
Rape culture is a [[culture]] in which [[rape]] and [[sexual violence]] are common and in which prevalent [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[norm (sociology)|norms]], practices, and [[mass media|media]] [[normalization (sociology)|normalize]], excuse, tolerate, or even condone sexual violence. Examples of behaviors commonly associated with rape culture include [[victim blaming]], [[slut-shaming]], [[sexual objectification]], and trivializing rape.  Rape culture has been used to model behaviour within social groups, including prison systems where [[prison rape]] is common and conflict areas where [[war rape]] is used as psychological warfare. Entire countries have also been alleged to be rape cultures.&lt;ref name="leaderu"&gt;Sommers, Dr. Christina Hoff.

Although the concept of rape culture is a generally accepted theory in feminist academia, disagreement still exists over what defines a rape culture and to what degree a given society meets the criteria to be considered a rape culture.

Rape culture has been observed to correlate with other social factors and behaviours. Research identifies correlation between [[rape myth]]s, [[victim blaming]] and trivialisation of rape with increased incidence of racism, homophobia, ageism, classism, religious intolerance and other forms of discrimination.&lt;ref name=AOSVOD001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aosved|first=Allison C.|author2=Long, Patricia J.|title=Co-occurrence of Rape Myth Acceptance, Sexism, Racism, Homophobia, Ageism, Classism, and Religious Intolerance|journal=Sex Roles|date=28 November 2006|volume=55|issue=7–8|pages=481–492|doi=10.1007/s11199-006-9101-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suarez|first=E.|author2=Gadalla, T.

==Feminism and sexual harassment==
{{See also|Sexual harassment}}
Feminists have been crucial to the development of the notion of [[sexual harassment]] and the codification of laws against sexual harassment. [[Catharine MacKinnon]] was among the first to write on the topic of sexual harassment. MacKinnon's book ''Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination'' is the eighth most-cited American legal book published since 1978, according to a study published by Fred Shapiro in January 2000.

Some [[Liberal feminism|liberal feminists]] and [[Individualist feminism|individualist feminists]] have criticized the notion of sexual harassment. [[Camille Paglia]] says that young girls can end up acting in such ways as to make sexual harassment easier, such that for example, by acting "nice" they can become a target. Paglia commented in an interview with [[Playboy]], "Realize the degree to which your niceness may invoke people to say lewd and pornographic things to you—sometimes to violate your niceness. The more you blush, the more people want to do it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://privat.ub.uib.no/bubsy/playboy.htm Playboy interview, Camille Paglia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622065038/http://privat.ub.uib.no/bubsy/playboy.htm |date=June 22, 2006 }} May 1995&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jane Gallop]] believes that sexual harassment laws have been abused by what she calls "[[victim feminist]]s", as opposed to "[[power feminist]]s" as she calls herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= When Women Kill: Questions of Agency and Subjectivity|last= Morrissey|first= Belinda|year= 2003|publisher= [[Routledge]]|location= 2003|isbn= 0-203-42283-X|page=135 |pages= |accessdate=October 3, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fewUIbJHyy0C&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=Jane+Gallop+%22victim+feminism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kvzR4-xVsf&amp;sig=POczS8Svc2YEQDuEwV1gEiF5sGM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pshsUPiuKOHM0AG5roGoCw&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminism and sexual objectification==
{{See also|Sexual objectification}}
The concept of sexual objectification and, in particular, the objectification of [[women]], is an important idea in feminist theory and psychological theories derived from feminism.&lt;ref name=BarryK&gt;Barry, Kathleen, ''Female Sexual Slavery'' (NYU Press, 1994), {{ISBN|978-0-8147-1069-2}}, p.247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldenberg&gt;Goldenberg, Jamie L., and Tomi-Ann Roberts, 'The Beast within the Beauty: An Existential Perspective on the Objectification and Condemnation of Women' in Jeff Greenberg, Sander Leon Koole, Thomas A.

===The male gaze===
{{Main|Male gaze}}
The "male gaze" is feminist theory that was first developed by [[Laura Mulvey]] in 1975. The male gaze occurs when the audience, or viewer, is put into the perspective of a heterosexual male. Mulvey stressed that the dominant male gaze in mainstream [[Hollywood films]] reflects and satisfies the male unconscious: most filmmakers are male, thus the voyeuristic gaze of the camera is male; male characters in the [[Fictional film|film's narratives]] make women the objects of their gaze; and inevitably, the spectator's gaze reflects the voyeuristic male gazes of the camera and the male actors.&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Brenda|title='Click Flicks' as Feminist Texts:The Appropriation of the Male Gaze in Thelma &amp; Louise|journal=[[Women's Studies in Communication]]|year=2000|volume=23|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When [[feminism]] characterizes the "male gaze" certain themes appear such as, [[voyeurism]], [[objectification]], [[fetishism]], [[scopophilia]], and women as the object of male pleasure.&lt;ref name="Theorizing the Male Gaze"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Snow|first=Edward|title=Theorizing the Male Gaze: Some Problems|journal=Representations|year=1989|issue=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mary Ann Doane|Mary Anne Doane]] gives an example of how [[voyeurism]] can be seen in the male gaze. "The early silent cinema, through its insistent inscription of scenarios of voyeurism, conceives of its spectator's viewing pleasure in terms of the peeping tom, behind the screen, reduplicating the spectator's position in relation to the woman on the screen."&lt;ref name=Doane&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doane|first=Mary Ann|title=Film and the Masquerade: Theorising the Female Spectator|journal=Screen|date=September 1982|volume=23|issue=3/4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus''''' is a [[novel]] written by English author [[Mary Shelley]] (1797–1851) that tells the story of [[Victor Frankenstein]], a young scientist who creates a hideous, [[Sapience|sapient]] [[Frankenstein's monster|creature]] in an unorthodox scientific experiment. Shelley started writing the story when she was 18, and the first edition of the novel was published anonymously in London on 1 January 1818, when she was 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff writer |date=1 January 1818 |title=Books Published This Day |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/32751068 |newspaper=The Times |location=London, England |issue=10342 |page=4 |quote=This day is published, in 3 vols., price 16s. 6d., a Work of Imagination, to be entitled Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus. |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her name first appeared on the second edition, published in 1823.

Shelley travelled through Europe in 1814, journeying along the river [[Rhine]] in Germany with a stop in [[Gernsheim]], which is {{convert|17|km}} away from [[Frankenstein Castle]], where, two centuries before, an [[alchemist]] was engaged in experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbler, Dorthy and Thomas. ''The Monsters: Mary Shelley and the Curse of Frankenstein''. Back Bay Books; 20 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, Martin. ''Mary Shelley''. Oxford University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seymour, Miranda. ''Mary Shelley''. Atlanta, GA: Grove Press, 2002. pg 110-111&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she travelled in the region of [[Geneva]] (Switzerland)—where much of the story takes place—and the topic of [[galvanism]] and [[occult]] ideas were themes of conversation among her companions, particularly her lover and future husband, [[Percy Shelley]]. Mary, Percy and [[Lord Byron]] decided to have a competition to see who could write the best [[Horror fiction|horror]] story. After thinking for days, Shelley dreamt about a scientist who created life and was horrified by what he had made; her dream later evolved into the novel's story.

''Frankenstein'' is infused with elements of the [[Gothic fiction|Gothic novel]] and the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement. At the same time, it is an early example of [[science fiction]]. [[Brian Aldiss]] has argued that it should be considered the first true science fiction story because, in contrast to previous stories with fantastical elements resembling those of later science fiction, the central character "makes a deliberate decision" and "turns to modern experiments in the laboratory" to achieve fantastic results.&lt;ref&gt;''The Detached Retina: Aspects of SF and Fantasy'' by Brian Aldiss (1995), [https://books.google.com/books?id=N1WWSRVeOC8C&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage page 78].&lt;/ref&gt; It has had a considerable influence in literature and popular culture and spawned a complete genre of [[horror fiction|horror]] stories, films and plays.

Since the novel's publication, the name "Frankenstein" has often been used to refer to the monster itself. This usage is sometimes considered erroneous, but usage commentators regard it as well-established and acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Bergen Evans, ''Comfortable Words'', New York: Random House, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Garner, ''A Dictionary of Modern American Usage'', New York, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of American English'', Merriam-Webster: 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In the novel, the monster is identified by words such as "creature", "monster", "demon", "wretch", "abortion", "fiend" and "it". Speaking to Victor Frankenstein, the monster says "I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel" (which ties to [[Lucifer]] in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', which the monster reads, and which relates to the disobedience of [[Prometheus]] in the book's subtitle).

==Summary==

''Frankenstein'' is written in the form of a [[frame story]] that starts with Captain Robert Walton writing letters to his sister. It takes place at an unspecified time in the 18th century, as the letters' dates are given as "17—". In the story following the letters by Walton, the readers find that Victor Frankenstein creates a monster that brings tragedy to his life.

===Captain Walton's introductory frame narrative===
The novel ''Frankenstein'' is written in [[Epistolary novel|epistolary form]], documenting a fictional correspondence between Captain Robert Walton and his sister, Margaret Walton Saville. Walton is a failed writer and captain who sets out to explore the [[North Pole]] and expand his scientific knowledge in hopes of achieving fame. During the voyage, the crew spots a dog sled driven by a gigantic figure. A few hours later, the crew rescues a nearly frozen and emaciated man named [[Victor Frankenstein]]. Frankenstein has been in pursuit of the gigantic man observed by Walton's crew. Frankenstein starts to recover from his exertion; he sees in Walton the same obsession that has destroyed him, and recounts a story of his life's miseries to Walton as a warning. The recounted story serves as the frame for Frankenstein's narrative.

===Victor Frankenstein's narrative===

Victor begins by telling of his childhood. Born in [[Naples]], Italy, into a wealthy [[Geneva]]n family, Victor and his brothers, Ernest and William, all three being sons of Alphonse Frankenstein by the former Caroline Beaufort, are encouraged to seek a greater understanding of the world through chemistry. As a young boy, Victor is obsessed with studying outdated theories that focus on simulating natural wonders. When Victor is five years old, his parents adopt [[Elizabeth Lavenza]], the orphaned daughter of an expropriated Italian nobleman, with whom Victor (allegedly) later falls in love. During this period, Victor's parents, Alphonse and Caroline, take in yet another orphan, Justine Moritz, who becomes William's nanny.

Weeks before he leaves for the [[University of Ingolstadt]] in Germany, his mother dies of [[scarlet fever]]; Victor buries himself in his experiments to deal with the grief. At the university, he excels at chemistry and other sciences, soon developing a secret technique to impart life to non-living matter. Eventually, he undertakes the creation of a humanoid, but due to the difficulty in replicating the minute parts of the human body, Victor makes the Creature tall, about {{convert|8|ft}} in height and proportionally large. Despite Victor selecting its features as beautiful, upon animation the creature is instead hideous, with watery white eyes and yellow skin that barely conceals the muscles and blood vessels underneath. Repulsed by his work, Victor flees when it awakens. While wandering the streets, he meets his childhood friend, Henry Clerval, and takes Henry back to his apartment, fearful of Henry's reaction if he sees the monster. However, the Creature has escaped.

Victor falls ill from the experience and is nursed back to health by Henry. After a four-month recovery, he returns home when he learns of the murder of his brother William. Upon arriving in Geneva, Victor sees the Creature near the crime scene and climbing a mountain, leading him to believe his creation is responsible. Justine Moritz, William's nanny, is convicted of the crime after William's locket, which had contained a miniature portrait of Caroline, is found in her pocket. Victor is helpless to stop her from being hanged, as he knows no one would believe his story.

Ravaged by grief and guilt, Victor retreats into the mountains. The Creature finds him and pleads for Victor to hear his tale.

=== The Creature's narrative ===
Intelligent and articulate, [[Frankenstein's monster|the Creature]] relates his first days of life, living alone in the wilderness and finding that people were afraid of and hated him due to his appearance, which led him to fear and hide from them. While living in an abandoned structure connected to a cottage, he grew fond of the poor family living there, and discreetly collected firewood for them. Secretly living among the family for months, the Creature learned to speak by listening to them and he taught himself to read after discovering a lost satchel of books in the woods. When he saw his reflection in a pool, he realized his physical appearance was hideous, and it terrified him as it terrifies normal humans. Nevertheless, he approached the family in hopes of becoming their friend. Initially he was able to befriend the blind father figure of the family, but the rest of them were frightened and they all fled their home, resulting in the Creature leaving, disappointed. He traveled to Victor's family estate using details from Victor's journal, murdered William, and framed Justine.

The Creature demands that Victor create a female companion like himself. He argues that as a living being, he has a right to happiness. The Creature promises that he and his mate will vanish into the South American wilderness, never to reappear, if Victor grants his request. Should Victor refuse his request, The Creature also threatens to kill Victor's remaining friends and loved ones and not stop until he completely ruins him.

Fearing for his family, Victor reluctantly agrees. The Creature says he will watch over Victor's progress.

=== Victor Frankenstein's narrative resumes ===
Clerval accompanies him to [[England]], but they separate at Victor's insistence at [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], [[Scotland]]. Victor suspects that the Creature is following him. Working on the female creature on the [[Orkney|Orkney Islands]], he is plagued by premonitions of disaster, such as the female hating the Creature or becoming more evil than him, but more particularly the two creatures might lead to the breeding of a race that could plague mankind. He tears apart the unfinished female creature after he sees the Creature, who had indeed followed Victor, watching through a window. The Creature later confronts and tries to threaten Victor into working again, but Victor is convinced that the Creature is evil and that its mate would be evil as well, and the pair would threaten all humanity. Victor destroys his work and the Creature vows that he will "be with [him] on [his] wedding night". Victor interprets this as a threat upon his life, believing that the Creature will kill him after he finally becomes happy. When Victor lands in [[Ireland]], he is soon imprisoned for Clerval's murder, as the Creature had strangled Clerval to death and left the corpse to be found where his creator had arrived, causing the latter to suffer another mental breakdown in prison. After being acquitted, Victor returns home with his father, who has restored to Elizabeth some of her father's fortune.

In Geneva, Victor is about to marry Elizabeth and prepares to fight the Creature to the death, arming himself with pistols and a dagger. The night following their wedding, Victor asks Elizabeth to stay in her room while he looks for "the fiend". While Victor searches the house and grounds, the Creature strangles Elizabeth to death. From the window, Victor sees the Creature, who tauntingly points at Elizabeth's corpse; Victor tries to shoot him, but the Creature escapes. After Victor gets back to Geneva, Victor's father, weakened by age and by the death of his precious Elizabeth, dies a few days later. Seeking revenge, Victor pursues the Creature to the [[North Pole]], but collapses from exhaustion and [[hypothermia]] before he can find his quarry.

===Captain Walton's conclusion===
At the end of Victor's narrative, Captain Walton resumes the telling of the story, closing the frame around Victor's recounting. A few days after the Creature vanished, the ship becomes trapped in [[pack ice]] and multiple crewmen die in the cold, before the rest of Walton's crew insists on returning south once it is freed. Upon hearing the crew's pleas to their captain, Victor, angered, lectures them with a powerful speech: it is hardship, not comfort and easiness, that defines a glorious undertaking such as theirs; he urges them to be men, not cowards. The ship is freed and Walton, owing it to the will of his men, albeit regretfully, decides to return South. Victor, even though in very weak condition, states that he will go on by himself.

Victor dies shortly thereafter, telling Walton, with his last words, to seek "happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition". Walton discovers the Creature on his ship, mourning over Victor's body. The Creature tells Walton that Victor's death has not brought him peace; rather, his crimes have left him completely alone. The Creature vows to kill himself so that no others will ever know of his existence. Walton watches as the Creature drifts away on an ice raft that is soon "lost in darkness and distance", never to be seen again.

== Background ==
The author, [[Mary Shelley]], had a tragic life from the beginning. Shelley's mother, [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], died shortly after giving birth to her. Since Shelley did not know her mother it made her have a close attachment to her father. Shelley's father, [[William Godwin]], hired a nurse to care for her and her half sister but she left and her father ended up remarrying. Shelley's stepmother did not like the close bond Shelley had with her father. This caused Godwin to favor his other two daughters and sons. However, none of the neglect stopped Shelley from becoming the great female author she was.

Her father was a famous author himself and her education was of great importance. Shelley grew up surrounded by many different writers and persons of political importance because of her father. This inspired her authorship at an early age. Shelley met [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], who later became her husband, at the age of sixteen while he was visiting with her father at their home. Her father did not agree with their relationship so they fled to France along with her sister, Jane.  Later, she gave birth to their first child and soon after lost the child.

Both Mary and Percy went away with Jane to visit her lover [[Lord Byron]], in [[Geneva]] during the summer. Percy and Mary became good friends with Byron and used their time with him to discuss literature, politics, and science. One evening after being trapped in the house because of storms Byron suggested they all have a competition of writing the best ghost story. This is how Frankenstein was brought to life. Mary was eighteen years old when she wrote this novel. Shelley won the contest by her creation of the novel, Frankenstein. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/frankenstein/exhibition1.html|title=Frankenstein: Penetrating the Secrets of Nature: The Birth of Frankenstein|website=www.nlm.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Badalamenti|first=Anthony|date=Fall 2006|title=Why did Mary Shelley Write Frankenstein|jstor=27512949|journal=Journal of Religion and Health|volume=45|pages=419–439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literary Influences ===
[[File:House of Lord Byron in Geneva.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:House%20of%20Lord%20Byron%20in%20Geneva.jpg|alt=Home of Lord Byron where Frankenstein was created|thumb|Lord Bryon's Home in Geneva.]]
Shelley was heavily influenced by both of her parents works. Her father was famous for [[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice]] and her mother famous for [[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]. Her father's novels also influenced her writing of ''Frankenstein''. These novels included [[Things as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams]], ''St. Leon,'' and ''Fleetwood''. All of these books were set in Switzerland, similar to the setting in Frankenstein. Some major themes of social affections and the renewal of life that appear in Shelley's novel stem from these works she had in her possession. Other literary influences that appear in ''Frankenstein'' are [[Pygmalion (play)]] and  [[Ovid]]  with the use of an individual lacking intelligence and those individuals identifying the problems with society. Ovid also inspires the use of [[Prometheus]] in Shelley's title.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pollin|first=Burton|date=Spring 1965|title=Philisophical and Literary Sources of Frankenstein|journal=Comparative Literature|volume=17|pages=97–108|jstor=1769997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her time spent with Lord Byron, Percy Shelley, her baby, and her sister Jane influenced her creation of Frankenstein as well. Percy and Bryon's discussion on life and death surrounded many scientific geniuses of the time. They discussed ideas from [[Charles Darwin]] and the experiments from [[Luigi Galvani]]. Mary listened intently to these conversations and the ideas of Darwin and Galvani were both present in her novel. The horrors of not being able to write a story for the contest and her hard life also influenced the themes within ''Frankenstein.'' The themes of loss , guilt, and the consequences of defying nature present in the novel all developed from Mary Shelley's own life. The loss of her mother, the relationship with her father, and the death of her first child created the monster and his separation from parental guidance. Guilt stemmed from her not feeling good enough for Percy because of the loss of their child.   &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{quote|How I, then a young girl, came to think of, and to dilate upon, so very hideous an idea?|Mary Shelley&lt;ref&gt;"Preface", 1831 edition of ''Frankenstein''&lt;/ref&gt;}}During the rainy summer of 1816, the "[[Year Without a Summer]]", the world was locked in a long cold [[volcanic winter]] caused by the eruption of [[Mount Tambora]] in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, 118.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Shelley]], aged 18, and her lover (and later husband) [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] visited [[Lord Byron]] at the [[Villa Diodati]] by [[Lake Geneva]] in Switzerland. The weather was consistently too cold and dreary that summer to enjoy the outdoor holiday activities they had planned, so the group retired indoors until dawn.

Sitting around a log fire at Byron's villa, the company amused themselves by reading German ghost stories translated into French from the book ''[[Fantasmagoriana]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Dr. John Polidori, "The Vampyre" 1819, The New Monthly Magazine and Universal Register; London: H. Colburn, 1814–1820. Vol. 1, No. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; then Byron proposed that they "each write a ghost story".&lt;ref&gt;paragraph 7, Introduction, Frankenstein 1831 edition&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to think of a story, young Mary became anxious: "''Have you thought of a story?'' I was asked each morning, and each morning I was forced to reply with a mortifying negative."&lt;ref&gt;paragraph 8, Introduction, Frankenstein 1831 edition&lt;/ref&gt; During one evening in the middle of summer, the discussions turned to the nature of the principle of life. "Perhaps a corpse would be re-animated", Mary noted, "[[galvanism]] had given token of such things".&lt;ref&gt;paragraph 10, Introduction, Frankenstein 1831 edition&lt;/ref&gt; It was after midnight before they retired, and unable to sleep, she became possessed by her imagination as she beheld the "grim terrors" of her "waking dream".&lt;ref&gt;Shelley, Mary.

{{Quote|I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life, and stir with an uneasy, half vital motion. Frightful must it be; for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Spark, 157, from Mary Shelley's introduction to the 1831 edition of ''Frankenstein''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In September 2011, astronomer Donald Olson, after a visit to the Lake Geneva villa the previous year and inspecting data about the motion of the moon and stars, concluded that her "waking dream" took place "between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m." on 16 June 1816, several days after the initial idea by Lord Byron that they each write a ghost story.&lt;ref name="astro"&gt;Radford, Tim, ''[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/26/frankenstein-hour-creation-identified-astronomers Frankenstein's hour of creation identified by astronomers]'', The Guardian, Sunday 25 September 2011 (retrieved 5 January 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

She began writing what she assumed would be a short story. With Percy Shelley's encouragement, she expanded the tale into a full-fledged novel.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''An Introduction'', 30–31; Sunstein, 124.&lt;/ref&gt; She later described that summer in Switzerland as the moment "when I first stepped out from childhood into life".&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley wrote the first four chapters in the weeks following the suicide of her half-sister Fanny.&lt;ref&gt;Hay, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of many personal tragedies that impacted Shelley's work. Shelley's first child died in infancy, and when she began composing ''Frankenstein'' in 1816, she was likely nursing her second child, who would also be dead at ''Frankenstein''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lepore|first=Jill|date=February 5, 2018|title=The Strange and Twisted Life of 'Frankenstein'|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/the-strange-and-twisted-life-of-frankenstein|journal=The New Yorker|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byron managed to write just a fragment based on the [[vampire]] legends he heard while travelling the [[Balkans]], and from this [[John Polidori]] created ''[[The Vampyre]]'' (1819), the progenitor of the romantic vampire literary genre. Thus two seminal horror tales originated from the conclave.

The group talked about [[Enlightenment (philosophy)|Enlightenment]] and [[Counter-Enlightenment]] ideas as well. Shelley believed the Enlightenment idea that society could progress and grow if political leaders used their powers responsibly; however, she also believed the Romantic ideal that misused power could destroy society (Bennett 36–42).&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Betty T. Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley: An Introduction. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shelly wrote much of the book while residing in a lodging house in the centre of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kennedy| first = Mave|title='A 200-year-old secret': plaque to mark Bath's hidden role in Frankenstein|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/26/a-200-year-old-secret-plaque-to-mark-baths-hidden-role-in-frankenstein|publisher=theguardian.com |date=26 February 2018|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shelley's manuscripts for the first three-volume edition in 1818 (written 1816–1817), as well as the [[fair copy]] for her publisher, are now housed in the [[Bodleian Library]] in [[Oxford]].

[[File:Editions of Frankenstein.jpg|thumb|A variety of different editions]]

The second edition of ''Frankenstein'' was published on 11 August 1823 in two volumes (by G. and W. B. Whittaker) following the success of the stage play ''Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein'' by [[Richard Brinsley Peake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qykBJvG0iJQC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3#v=onepage|first= Mary |last=Wollstonecraft Shelley|authorlink=Mary Shelley|title= Frankenstein|publisher= Bedford Publishing |year=2000|page= 3|isbn= 9780312227623 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This edition credited Mary Shelley as the book's author on its title page.

On 31 October 1831, the first "popular" edition in one-volume appeared, published by [[Henry Colburn]] &amp; Richard Bentley.&lt;ref&gt;See forward to ''Barnes and Noble'' classic edition.&lt;/ref&gt; This edition was heavily revised by Mary Shelley, partially to make the story less radical. It included a lengthy new preface by the author, presenting a somewhat embellished version of the genesis of the story. This edition is the one most widely published and read now, although a few editions follow the 1818 text.&lt;ref&gt;The edition published by ''Forgotten Books'' is the original text, as is the "Ignatius Critical Edition". ''Vintage Books'' has an edition presenting both versions.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars prefer the original version, arguing that it preserves the spirit of Mary Shelley's vision (see Anne K. Mellor's "Choosing a Text of ''Frankenstein'' to Teach" in the [[W. W. Norton]] Critical edition).

In 2008, a new edition of the novel, titled ''The Original Frankenstein'', edited by Charles E. Robinson, was published.

==Frankenstein and the Monster==

===The Creature===
{{Main|Frankenstein's monster}}
[[File:Punch Anti-Irish propaganda (1882) Irish Frankenstein.jpg|thumb|upright|An English editorial cartoonist conceives the Irish [[Fenian|Fenian movement]] as akin to Frankenstein's creature, in the wake of the [[Phoenix Park murders]] in an 1882 issue of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/frankenstein/escaping.html Frankenstein:Celluloid Monster] at the National Library of Medicine website of the (U.S.) National Institutes of Health&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Part of Frankenstein's rejection of his creation is the fact that he does not give it a name, which causes a lack of identity. Instead it is referred to by words such as "wretch", "monster", "creature", "demon", "devil", "fiend", and "it". When Frankenstein converses with the creature in Chapter 10, he addresses it as "vile insect", "abhorred monster", "fiend", "wretched devil", and "abhorred devil".

During a telling of ''Frankenstein'', Shelley referred to the creature as "[[Adam]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/ppo/currentprograms/frankenstein/exhibittext.pdf |title=Frankenstein: Penetrating the Secrets of Nature / Exhibit Text |publisher=[[National Library of Medicine]] and ALA Public Programs Office |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |accessdate=31 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061204162542/http://www.ala.org/ala/ppo/currentprograms/frankenstein/exhibittext.pdf |archivedate=4 December 2006 |df=dmy }} from the traveling exhibition [http://www.ala.org/ala/ppo/currentprograms/frankenstein/frankensteinpenetrating.cfm Frankenstein: Penetrating the Secrets of Nature] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109215920/http://www.ala.org/ala/ppo/currentprograms/frankenstein/frankensteinpenetrating.cfm |date=9 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2017}} Shelley was referring to the [[List of first men or women in mythology and religion|first man]] in the [[Garden of Eden]], as in her epigraph:

:Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay
:To mould Me man? Did I solicit thee
:From darkness to promote me?
::[[John Milton]], ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (X. 743–5)

Although the creature would be described in later works as a composite of whole body parts grafted together from cadavers and [[reanimation (science fiction)|reanimated]] by the use of [[electricity]], this description is not consistent with Shelley's work; both the use of electricity and the cobbled-together image of Frankenstein's monster were more the result of [[James Whale]]'s popular 1931 [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|film adaptation of the story]], and other early motion-picture works based upon the creature. In Shelley's original work, Dr. Frankenstein discovers a previously unknown but elemental principle of life, and that insight allows him to develop a method to imbue vitality into inanimate matter, though the exact nature of the process is left largely ambiguous. After a great deal of hesitation in exercising this power, Frankenstein spends two years painstakingly constructing the creature's proportionally large body (one anatomical feature at a time, from raw materials supplied by "the dissecting room and the slaughter-house"), which he then brings to life using his unspecified process.

The creature has often been mistakenly called "Frankenstein". In 1908 one author said "It is strange to note how well-nigh universally the term "Frankenstein" is misused, even by intelligent people, as describing some hideous monster".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rBoOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA238 ''Author's Digest: The World's Great Stories in Brief''], by Rossiter Johnson, 1908&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edith Wharton]]'s ''[[The Reef (novel)|The Reef]]'' (1916) describes an unruly child as an "infant Frankenstein."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Reef (novel)|The Reef]]'', page 96.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Lindsay (novelist)|David Lindsay]]'s "The Bridal Ornament", published in ''The Rover'', 12 June 1844, mentioned "the maker of poor Frankenstein." After the release of Whale's cinematic ''Frankenstein'', the public at large began speaking of the creature itself as "Frankenstein". This also occurs in Frankenstein films, including ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935) and several subsequent films, as well as in film titles such as ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]''. Furthermore, the 1939 film ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' introduced an evil laboratory assistant, Ygor ([[Bela Lugosi]]), who never existed in the original narrative.

===Victor Frankenstein's name===
Mary Shelley maintained that she derived the name ''Frankenstein'' from a dream-vision. Despite her public claims of originality, however, a number of other sources have been suggested as Shelley's actual inspiration. The German name ''Frankenstein'' means "stone of the [[Franks]]", and it is associated with various places in Germany, including [[Frankenstein Castle]] (''Burg Frankenstein'') in [[Darmstadt]], [[Hesse]], and Frankenstein Castle in [[Frankenstein, Rhineland-Palatinate|Frankenstein]], a town in the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]]. There is also a castle called Frankenstein in [[Bad Salzungen]], Thuringia, and a municipality called [[Frankenstein, Saxony|Frankenstein]] in Saxony. Until 1945, [[Ząbkowice Śląskie]], now a city in [[Lower Silesian Voivodeship]], [[Poland]], was mainly populated by [[Germans]] and named ''Frankenstein'' in German, and was the site of a [[:pl:Afera grabarzy z Frankenstein|scandal involving gravediggers]] in 1606, which has been suggested as an inspiration to the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://historiamniejznanaizapomniana.wordpress.com/2016/01/24/afera-grabarzy-z-frankenstein/|title=Afera grabarzy z Frankenstein|first=Historia|last=zapomniana|date=24 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the name is borne by the aristocratic [[House of Franckenstein]] from [[Franconia]].

[[Radu Florescu]] argues that Mary and Percy Shelley visited Frankenstein Castle near Darmstadt in 1814 during their return to England from their elopement to Switzerland. It was at this castle that a notorious alchemist, [[Johann Conrad Dippel|Conrad Dippel]], had experimented with human bodies, and Florescu reasons that Mary suppressed mention of her visit in order to maintain her public claim of originality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Florescu|1996|pp=48–92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A literary essay by A.&amp;nbsp;J.

According to Jörg Heléne, the 'lost journals', as well as Florescu's claims, cannot be verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://darmundestat.wordpress.com/sonstiges/mary-shelleys-frankenstein-castle-frankenstein-and-the-alchemist-johann-conrad-dippel |title=Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Castle Frankenstein and the alchemist Johann Conrad Dippel |last=Heléne |first=Jörg|date=12 September 2016 |website=Darmstadt |publisher= |access-date=2017-06-23 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A possible interpretation of the name Victor is derived from ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' by [[John Milton]], a great influence on Shelley (a quotation from ''Paradise Lost'' is on the opening page of ''Frankenstein'' and Shelley even has the monster himself read it).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.upenn.edu/Projects/knarf/Articles/wade.html Wade, Phillip. "Shelley and the Miltonic Element in Mary Shelley's ''Frankenstein''."'' Milton and the Romantics'', 2 (December, 1976), 23–25.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|1952|pp=496–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Milton frequently refers to God as "the Victor" in ''Paradise Lost'', and Shelley sees Victor as playing God by creating life. In addition, Shelley's portrayal of the monster owes much to the character of [[Satan]] in ''Paradise Lost''; indeed, the monster says, after reading the epic poem, that he empathizes with Satan's role in the story.

There are many similarities between Victor and Percy Shelley, Mary's husband. Victor was a pen name of Percy Shelley's, as in the collection of poetry he wrote with his sister Elizabeth, ''[[Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Sandy | first =Mark | title =Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire | work =[[The Literary Encyclopedia]]| publisher =The Literary Dictionary Company | date =20 September 2002 | url =http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=3010 | accessdate = 2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is speculation that one of Mary Shelley's models for Victor Frankenstein was Percy, who at Eton had "experimented with electricity and magnetism as well as with gunpowder and numerous chemical reactions", and whose rooms at Oxford were filled with scientific equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792–1822) | publisher =Department of English, [[Dickinson College]] | work=Romantic Natural History | url =http://www.dickinson.edu/~nicholsa/Romnat/pbshelley.htm | accessdate = 2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Percy Shelley was the first-born son of a wealthy country squire with strong political connections and a descendant of Sir [[Bysshe Shelley]], 1st Baronet of [[Castle Goring]], and Richard Fitzalan, 10th [[Earl of Arundel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Percy Shelley#Ancestry]]&lt;/ref&gt; Victor's family is one of the most distinguished of that republic and his ancestors were counselors and [[syndic]]s. Percy had a sister named Elizabeth; Victor had an adopted sister named Elizabeth.

On 22 February 1815, Mary Shelley gave birth to a baby two months prematurely, and the baby died two weeks later. Percy did not care about the condition of this premature infant and left with Claire, Mary's stepsister, for a lurid affair.&lt;ref&gt;"''Journal 6 December''—Very Unwell. Shelley &amp; Clary walk out, as usual, to heaps of places ... A letter from Hookham to say that Harriet has been brought to bed of a son and heir. Shelley writes a number of circular letters on this event, which ought to be ushered in with ringing of bells, etc., for it is the son of his ''wife''." Quoted in Spark, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; When Victor saw the creature come to life he fled the apartment, though the newborn creature approached him, as a child would a parent. The question of Victor's responsibility to the creature is one of the main themes of the book.

===Modern Prometheus===
''The Modern Prometheus'' is the novel's subtitle (though some modern editions now drop the subtitle, mentioning it only in an introduction).&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Longman study edition published in India in 2007 by Pearson Education&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prometheus]], in later versions of Greek mythology, was the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] who created mankind at the behest of [[Zeus]]. He made a being in the image of the gods that could have a spirit breathed into it.&lt;ref&gt;In the best-known versions of the Prometheus story, by Hesiod and Aeschylus, Prometheus merely brings fire to mankind. But in other versions, such as several of Aesop's fables (See in particular Fable 516), Sappho (Fragment 207), and Ovid's Metamorphoses, Prometheus is the actual creator of humanity.&lt;/ref&gt; Prometheus taught man to hunt, read, and heal their sick, but after he tricked Zeus into accepting poor-quality offerings from humans, Zeus kept fire from mankind. Prometheus, being the creator, took back the fire from Zeus to give to man. When Zeus discovered this, he sentenced Prometheus to be eternally punished by fixing him to a rock of [[Caucasus]], where each day an eagle would peck out his liver, only for the liver to regrow the next day because of his immortality as a god. He was intended to suffer alone for eternity, but eventually [[Heracles]] ([[Hercules]]) released him.

Prometheus was also a myth told in Latin, but was a very different story. In this version Prometheus makes man from clay and water, again a very relevant theme to ''Frankenstein'', as Victor rebels against the laws of nature (how life is naturally made) and as a result is punished by his creation.

[[File:Frankenstein1910.jpg|thumb|In 1910, [[Edison Studios]] released the [[Frankenstein (1910 film)|first motion-picture adaptation]] of Shelley's story.]]

The Titan in the Greek mythology of Prometheus parallels Victor Frankenstein. Victor's work by creating man by new means reflects the same innovative work of the Titan in creating humans.

Some have argued that Mary Shelley saw Prometheus not as a hero but rather as something of a devil, and blamed him for bringing fire to man and thereby seducing the human race to the vice of eating meat (fire brought cooking which brought hunting and killing).&lt;ref&gt;(Leonard Wolf, p. 20).&lt;/ref&gt;

Byron was particularly attached to the play ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' by [[Aeschylus]], and Percy Shelley would soon write his own ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]]'' (1820). The term "Modern Prometheus" was actually coined by [[Immanuel Kant]] in reference to [[Benjamin Franklin]] and his experiments with electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://royalsociety.org/exhibitions/2006/benjamin-franklin/ RoyalSoc.ac.uk] "Benjamin Franklin in London." The Royal Society. Retrieved 8 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shelley's sources==
Shelley incorporated a number of different sources into her work, one of which was the [[Prometheus|Promethean]] myth from [[Ovid]]. The influence of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'', are also clearly evident within the novel. Mary is likely to have acquired some ideas for Frankenstein's character from [[Humphry Davy]]'s book ''Elements of Chemical Philosophy'', in which he had written that "science has ... bestowed upon man powers which may be called creative; which have enabled him to change and modify the beings around him ...". References to the [[French Revolution]] run through the novel; a possible source may lie in {{ill|François-Félix Nogaret|fr}}'s ''Le Miroir des événemens actuels, ou la Belle au plus offrant'' (1790): a political parable about scientific progress featuring an inventor named Frankésteïn who creates a life-sized automaton.&lt;ref&gt;Douthwaite, "The Frankenstein of the French Revolution" chapter 2 of The Frankenstein of 1790 and other Lost Chapters from Revolutionary France ([http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo13265096.html Frankenstein of 1790 and other Lost Chapters from Revolutionary France], 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Percy Bysshe Shelley's 1816 poem "[[Mutability (poem)|Mutability]]" is also quoted and its theme of the role of the subconscious is discussed in prose. The Creature also quotes a passage of the poem. His name has never appeared as the author of the poem although other poets are cited by name in the novel, implying that Mary wrote the poem and developed the psychological ideas. Another potential reason is to conceal his contributions to the novel.

Within the past thirty years or so, many writers and historians have attempted to associate several then popular natural philosophers (now called physical scientists) with Shelley's work on account of several notable similarities. Two of the most notable natural philosophers among Shelley's contemporaries were [[Giovanni Aldini]], who made many public attempts at human reanimation through bio-electric Galvanism in London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ruston |first1=Sharon |title=The Science of Life and Death in Mary Shelley's ''Frankenstein'' |journal=[[The Public Domain Review]] |date=25 November 2015 |url=http://publicdomainreview.org/2015/11/25/the-science-of-life-and-death-in-mary-shelleys-frankenstein/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Johann Konrad Dippel]], who was supposed to have developed chemical means to extend the life span of humans. While Shelley was obviously aware of both these men and their activities, she makes no mention of or reference to them or their experiments in any of her published or released notes.

== Reception ==
[[File:Frontispiece to Frankenstein 1831.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration by [[Theodor von Holst]] from the frontispiece of the 1831 edition&lt;ref&gt;This illustration is reprinted in the frontispiece to the [https://www.amazon.com/dp/098092104X 2008 edition of ''Frankenstein'']&lt;/ref&gt;]]

''Frankenstein'' has been both well received and disregarded since its anonymous publication in 1818. Critical reviews of that time demonstrate these two views, along with confused speculation as to the identity of the author. The ''[[La Belle Assemblée|Belle Assemblée]]'' described the novel as "very bold fiction" (139). The ''Quarterly Review'' stated that "the author has the power of both conception and language" (185). [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]], writing in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine|Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine]]'', congratulated "the author's original genius and happy power of expression" (620), although he is less convinced about the way in which the monster gains knowledge about the world and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crossref-it.info/textguide/Frankenstein/7/400 |title=Crossref-it.info |publisher=Crossref-it.info |date= |accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Edinburgh Magazine'' and ''Literary Miscellany'' hoped to see "more productions from this author" (253). On the other hand, the ''[[Quarterly Review]]'' described it "a tissue of horrible and disgusting absurdity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus''|journal=The Quarterly Review|date=January 1818|volume=18|pages=379–385|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044092624956;view=1up;seq=389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In two other reviews where the author is known as the daughter of William Godwin, the criticism of the novel makes reference to the feminine nature of Mary Shelley. The ''[[British Critic]]'' attacks the novel's flaws as the fault of the author: "The writer of it is, we understand, a female; this is an aggravation of that which is the prevailing fault of the novel; but if our authoress can forget the gentleness of her sex, it is no reason why we should; and we shall therefore dismiss the novel without further comment" (438). ''The Literary Panorama and National Register'' attacks the novel as a "feeble imitation of Mr. Godwin's novels" produced by the "daughter of a celebrated living novelist" (414). Despite the reviews, ''Frankenstein'' achieved an almost immediate popular success. It became widely known especially through melodramatic theatrical adaptations—Mary Shelley saw a production of ''Presumption; or The Fate of Frankenstein'', a play by [[Richard Brinsley Peake]], in 1823. A [[French translation]] appeared as early as 1821 (''Frankenstein: ou le Prométhée Moderne'', translated by Jules Saladin).

Critical reception of ''Frankenstein'' has been largely positive since the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/nineteenth-century-criticism/frankenstein-modern-prometheus-mary-wollstonecraft |title=Enotes.com |publisher=Enotes.com |date= |accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major critics such as M. A. Goldberg and [[Harold Bloom]] have praised the "aesthetic and moral" relevance of the novel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.octc.kctcs.edu/crunyon/CE/Frankenstein/Bloom/4-7_BloomIntro.htm |title=KCTCS.edu |publisher=Octc.kctcs.edu |date= |accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are also critics such as [[Germaine Greer]], who criticized the novel as terrible due to technical and narrative defects (such as it featuring three narrators that speak in the same way).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/09/gender.books | title=Yes, Frankenstein really was written by Mary Shelley. It's obvious - because the book is so bad | work=The Guardian | author=Germaine Greer | date=2007-04-09 | accessdate=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent years the novel has become a popular subject for psychoanalytic and feminist criticism: Lawrence Lipking states: "[E]ven the [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]] subgroup of psychoanalytic criticism, for instance, has produced at least half a dozen discrete readings of the novel".&lt;ref&gt;L. Lipking. Frankenstein the True Story; or [[Rousseau]] Judges Jean-Jacques. (Published in the [[W. W.

Retrieved 27 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Film director [[Guillermo del Toro]] describes ''Frankenstein'' as "the quintessential teenage book", adding "You don't belong. You were brought to this world by people that don't care for you and you are thrown into a world of pain and suffering, and tears and hunger. It's an amazing book written by a teenage girl. It's mind-blowing."&lt;ref name="BBC 2018"/&gt; Professor of philosophy [[Patricia MacCormack]] says the creature, brought to life by Victor Frankenstein, addresses the most fundamental human questions: "It's the idea of asking your maker what your purpose is.

'''Gabès''' ({{lang-ar|قابس}} ''{{audio|help=no|Gabes.wav|Gābis}})'', also spelled ''Cabès'', ''Cabes'', ''Kabes'', ''Gabbs'' and ''Gaps'', is the capital city of the [[Gabès Governorate]] in [[Tunisia]]. It is located on the coast of the [[Gulf of Gabès]]. With a population of 152,921, Gabès is the [[Tunisia#Major cities|6th largest Tunisian city]].&lt;ref name="Gabesmun"/&gt;

==History==

===Etymology===
Takapes, the ancient name of Gabès, is a [[Numidian language|Numidian]] ([[Berber languages|Berber]]) toponym. Later, the prefix "Ta" (meaning "to" in Berber) was dropped, and the place became known as Kapes. As in [[Arabic]] the sound /p/ is unknown, Kapes became known as Kabes, and later known as Gabès.

=== Roman period ===
Gabès is the ancient ''Tacapae''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YnYjGTh88ZQC&amp;pg=PA123 D. L. Bomgardner, ''Story of the Roman Amphitheatre''] (Routledge 2013 {{ISBN|978-1-13470739-3}}), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rH26vL2CWbkC&amp;pg=PA15 Paul Lachlan MacKendrick, ''The North African Stones Speak''] (UNC Press 2000 {{ISBN|978-0-80784942-2}}), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Tacape'' (Τακάπη in [[Ancient greek]])  or ''Tacapes''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trismegistos.org/place/17132 Trismegistos, "Tacapae"]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Roman province]] of [[Tripolitania]].

[[Strabo]] refers to this city as an important entrepot of the [[Lesser Syrtis]]. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (18.22) remarks that the waters of a copious fountain at Tacape were divided among the cultivators according to a system where each had the use of the water during a certain interval of time.

The ''[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]'' shows Tacape between [[Marcomades]]  and [[Sabratha]].

=== Bishopric ===
Tacapae became a Christian [[bishopric]] that, no longer being a residential see, is included in the [[Catholic Church]]'s list of [[titular see]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 980&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of its bishops are known:&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Antonio Morcelli, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dO4-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA295 ''Africa christiana''], Volume I, Brescia 1816, p.&amp;nbsp;295&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dulcitius, [[Papal legate|legate]] of the bishops of Tripolitana to the [[Council of Carthage (403)]] and present at the [[Conference of Carthage (411)]]; 
*Servilius, exiled by [[Huneric]] in 484; 
*Caius or Gallus, legate of the bishops of his province to the [[Council of Carthage (525)]].

=== After the Roman and Christian period ===
[[File:Plan Gabes 1928.jpg|thumb|right|1928 map of Gabès under the French.]]

*7th century: The [[Umayyad Caliphate]] conquest. [[Sahabah|Muhammed's companion]] Sidi Abou Loobaba Al'Ansarey settles in Gabès.
*1574: Gabès becomes part of the [[Eyalet of Tunis]] after the Ottoman conquest.
*1881: Gabès comes under a French [[protectorate]].
*1940: Following the [[Fall of France]], Gabès comes under German control.
*1943: Gabès returns to French control with the help of the British (in the [[Mareth Line]]). The operation results in serious damage to the city infrastructure and in the defeat of Hitler for the first time in history.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mareth Line]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*1945: The rebuilding of Gabès starts.
*1956: Gabès reverts to [[Tunisia]]n control with the independence of Tunisia from the French.

== Education ==
* [[University of Gabès]] (science university, engineering school...)

== Economy ==
Gabès is one of the biggest industrial cities in [[Tunisia]]. Most industries are chemical oriented, this is why the city offers one of the best chemistry degrees in Africa from the [[University of Gabès]]. The main industries are:
* Cement
* Chemical products
* Brick Factories
* Oil refinery

The fast-growing numbers of factories has resulted in fairly serious pollution of the area and of the [[Gulf of Gabès]].  In recent years the government is working on new programs and laws to decrease the amount of pollution.

== Transport ==
[[Gabès – Matmata International Airport]] is in the city.

Gabès will soon be upgraded with one light rail system under the number 7 that will run from the railway station to the port of Gabès. Featuring rolling stock made by Alstom, Gabès will receive 15 new train sets.

===Railways===
Gabès is terminus of a narrow gauge {{RailGauge|1000mm}} branch railway from the capital, and is the nearest railway station to the [[Transport in Libya|Libyan]] border at [[Ras Ajdir]].
Gabès has also one of the biggest ports in Tunisia; it is used usually to ship the mineral products from the city of Gafsa.

====Roads====
Gabès will be linked soon with the national motorway A1 (Tunis – Ras Ajdir)

== Climate ==
Gabès has a semi-arid climate, characterized by a hot and dry season and a cool and arid season.

===Climate===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4900">A '''geological period''' is one of several subdivisions of [[geologic time]] enabling cross-referencing of rocks and geologic events from place to place.

These periods form elements of a hierarchy of divisions into which [[geologist]]s have split the [[geologic time scale|Earth's history]].

[[Eon (geology)|Eons]] and [[Era (geology)|eras]] are larger subdivisions than periods while periods themselves may be divided into [[Epoch (geology)|epochs]] and [[Age (geology)|ages]].

The rocks formed during a period belong to a [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] unit called a [[System (stratigraphy)|system]].

== Structure ==
The twelve currently recognised periods of the present eon – the [[Phanerozoic]] – are defined by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] (ICS) by reference to the [[stratigraphy]] at particular locations around the world.

In 2004 the [[Ediacaran]] Period of the latest [[Precambrian]] was defined in similar fashion, and was the first such newly designated period in 130 years; but earlier periods are simply defined by age.

A consequence of this approach to the Phanerozoic periods is that the ages of their beginnings and ends can change from time to time as the absolute age of the chosen rock sequences, which define them, is more precisely determined.

The set of rocks ([[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]], [[igneous rock|igneous]] or [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]]) that formed during a geological period is known as a system, so for example the 'Jurassic System' of rocks was formed during the 'Jurassic Period' (between 201 and 145 million years ago).

The following table includes all currently recognized periods.  The table omits the time before 2500 million years ago, which is not divided into periods.

== Correlation issues ==
In a steady effort ongoing since 1974, the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] has been working to correlate the world's local [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic record]] into one uniform planet-wide benchmarked system.

American geologists have long considered the [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]] and [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] to be periods in their own right though the ICS now recognises them both as 'subperiods' of the [[Carboniferous]] Period recognised by European geologists. Cases like this in China, Russia and even [[New Zealand]] with other geological eras has slowed down the uniform organization of the stratigraphic record.

Notable changes
* Changes in recent years have included the abandonment of the former [[Tertiary]] Period in favour of the [[Paleogene]] and succeeding [[Neogene]] periods.
* The abandonment of the [[Quaternary]] period was also considered but it has been retained for continuity reasons.
* Even earlier in the history of the science, the Tertiary was considered to be an 'era' and its subdivisions ([[Paleocene]], [[Eocene]], [[Oligocene]], [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]]) were themselves referred to as 'periods' but they now enjoy the status of 'epochs' within the more recently delineated [[Paleogene]] and [[Neogene]] periods.

'''George Yurii Shevelov''' ('''Schneider''') ({{lang-ru|Юрий Владимирович Шевелёв}}, {{lang-ua|Юрій Володимирович Шевельов}}) (pseud: Yurii Sherekh, Hryhory Shevchuk, Šerech, Sherekh, Sher; Гр. Ш., Ю. Ш. and others) (December 17, 1908 – April 12, 2002) was a Ukrainian-American professor, linguist, philologist, essayist, literary historian, and literary critic. A longtime professor of Slavic [[philology]] at [[Columbia University]], he challenged the prevailing notion of a unified East Slavic language from which Ukrainian, Belarusian and Russian later developed, instead proposing that these languages emerged independently from one another.

==Biography==

===Early life===

George Yurii Shevelov was born Yurii Shneider in [[Kharkiv]], [[Ukraine]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]] in 1908. Some sources however, indicate [[Kharkiv]] as his place of birth (his mother incorrectly stated his birthplace in order to escape persecution).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maidan.org.ua/history/kharkiv/yuri_sheveliov/Rieger_Hnatiuk.htm text Пам’яті Юрія Шевельова (Шереха)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maidan.org.ua/history/kharkiv/yuri_sheveliov/Rieger_Hnatiuk.htm Rieger J.,  Hnatiuk A. Jurij Szewelow (George Y. Shevelov, Jurij Szerech) 1908–2002 // Slavia Orientalis. – 2002. – T. LI. – Nr. 3. – S. 351–360.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/pages/S/H/ShevelovGeorgeYurii.htm|title=Shevelov, George Yurii|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His family moved to Kharkiv in 1910. His father, Vladimir Karlovich Shnaider (Schneider) was a high ranking [[Russian Imperial Army]] officer who held the rank of major-general. His father and mother (Varvara Meder, who originally was of noble birth from an established Moscow family) were both ethnic [[Germans]]. When Russia declared war on the German Empire in 1914, his father – a fervent Russian monarchist – decided to russify the family name. Shnaider choose the Russian equivalent of his surname = Shevelov, and also changed the patronymic “Karlovich” to “Yuryevich”. Such changes required a personal petition to the Tsar, and in his case it was personally granted by [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nikolai II]] in 1916. During the [[World War I]], Yurii and his mother moved to Kharkiv. At the beginning of 1918, Shevelov’s father was [[missing in action]] and was presumed killed.

In Kharkiv, Yurii initially attended the E.Druzhkova Private School, then at 3rd State Boy's Gymnasium, and then continued his education at the Technical School #7 ({{lang-ua|7-а трудовa школa}}).

===In Soviet Ukraine===

In 1925 Shevelov graduated from the First Kharkiv Trade and Industry Union school  ({{lang-ua|Перша харківська торговельна промислова профспілкова школа}}). From 1925 till 1927 he worked as a statistician and archive keeper for South Chemical Trust. In 1927–1931 he attended classes at the literary-linguistic branch of the Kharkiv People's Education Institute. From August 1931 he was employed as a Ukrainian language school teacher. From 1932 till 1938 he was employed as a Ukrainian language teacher at the Ukrainian Communist Newspaper Technical School ({{lang-ua|Український комуністичноий газетний технікум}}). From 1933 till 1939 he also taught Ukrainian language at the Ukrainian Communist Institute for Journalism. From September 1936 he was a postgraduate student under the guidance of [[Leonid Bulakhovsky]].  In 1939 he taught the history of the Ukrainian language and literature. From November 1939 he became the assistant professor and deputy chair of the philology department of the Kharkiv Pedagogical Institute. In 1941 he became a research fellow at the Linguistic Institute of the [[Ukrainian Academy of Science|Academy of Science of the Ukrainian SSR]]. In that same year he was pressured to become an [[NKVD]] informer.&lt;ref&gt;Шевельов (Шерех), Ю.В. “Я – мене – мені…(і довкруги)”: Спогади. – Х.; Нью-Йорк: Вид-во М.П.Коць, 2001. – Т.1. p 8- 290&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Боґуміла Бердиховська. Україна: люди і книжки . КІС, 2009. p 167-169&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 Shevelov was the co-author of a Grammar of the Ukrainian language in two volumes. This text was reprinted in 1935 and 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://izbornyk.org.ua/ukrmova/um144.htm|title=Юрій Шевельов. Українська мова. Енциклопедія.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===During WWII===

Shevelov was able to avoid induction into the [[Red Army]] and remained in Kharkiv following the Soviet evacuation, and after the [[Wehrmacht]] troops entered Kharkiv on 25 October 1941. He joined the “New Ukraine” in December 1941, a Ukrainian language newspaper partially controlled by [[OUN]].&lt;ref&gt;А. В. Скоробогатов Харків у часи німецької окупації (1941—1943). — Харків: Прапор, 2006.  — {{ISBN|966-7880-79-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Shevelov also worked at the  “Ukrainian Sowing” newspaper ({{lang-ua|»Український засів»}}}.  From April 1942 Shevelov worked for the city administration and collaborated with the educational organization [[Prosvita]]. In his memoirs, one of his former students [[Oles Honchar]] claimed that when as a Soviet POW he was detained in a Nazi Camp in Kharkiv, Shevelov refused his pleas for assistance &lt;ref&gt;Гончар Олесь. Катарсис. — К.: Український світ, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2010}}. Shevelov answered the allegation in an interview stating that he never received the letter "...А потім у нас відбулася ще одна зустріч віч-на-віч. Гончар почав на мене нападати – ідеологічно, згадувати якісь факти, про які я нічого не знаю. Ніби-то коли в роки війни він потрапив до харківської в"язниці, то передав мені лист, в якому просив посприяти його визволенню, а я міг, та не захотів. Можливо, такий лист і справді був, але до мене він ніколи не потрапляв.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/4b1a989a8479a/|title=Юрій Шевельов: "Я хотів сказати до побачення всім, кого знав і любив..."|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Honchar escaped death to become a renowned and influential Ukrainian writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrposhta.com/www/bulletin.nsf/0/C91830429EF355D3C22574280042C01B?OpenDocument|title=Server Login|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shevelov has been critical of Soviet novels including Honchar's major work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dt.ua/3000/3680/34539/ End of a Century].by Svitlana Matvienko.  ''Mirror Weekly''. 20–26 April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shevelov and his mother fled the returning Red Army's advance on Kharkiv in February 1943. He resided for a brief period of time in [[Lviv]] where he continued his work in the study of Ukrainian language, including the creation of a new Ukrainian grammar until the Spring of 1944, when the Soviets continued their drive Westwards. Shevelov with the assistance of the [[Ukrainian Central Committee]] moved to Poland (Krynica) and then to Slovakia, then Austria and finally to [[Saxony]].

===In Europe===

After the fall of Nazi Germany, Shevelov worked for the Ukrainian émigré newspaper “Chas” (“Time”). In 1946 he enrolled in the [[Ukrainian Free University]] in Munich and defended his doctorate dissertation in philology in 1947, continuing on his pre-war research and work "До генези називного речення" (1941) {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}. He was also vice-president of the MUR ({{lang-ua|Мистецький український рух}}), a Ukrainian literary association (1945–49). In order to avoid repatriation to Soviet Union from Germany, he moved to neutral Sweden, where he worked in 1950–52 as Russian language lecturer at [[Lund University]].

===In the USA===

In 1952, together with mother, he emigrated to the USA.  After settling in the United States he worked as a lecturer in Russian and Ukrainian at [[Harvard University]] (1952-4), associate professor (1954-8) and professor of Slavic philology at [[Columbia University]] (1958–77). He was one of the founders and president of the émigré scholarly organization “Ukrainian Free Academy of Sciences” (1959–61, 1981–86) and received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Alberta]] (1983) and [[Lund University]] (1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/Senate/honorarydegreeslist.cfm|title=University of Alberta|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527195725/http://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/senate/honorarydegreeslist.cfm|archivedate=2011-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ht.lu.se/forskning/hedersdoktorer/hedersdoktorer-vid-humanistiska-fakulteten|title=Hedersdoktorer vid humanistiska fakulteten - Humanistiska och teologiska fakulteterna, Lunds universitet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a founding member of the [[Slovo Association of Ukrainian Writers in Exile]] and was published in numerous émigré bulletins and magazines.

===Return to Ukraine===

Shevelov was almost unknown to Ukrainian academic circles after 1943. In 1990, after an extended absence, he visited Ukraine where he was elected an international member of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]]. In 1999 he received an honorary doctorate from the [[Kharkiv University]] and from the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.gov.ua/Person/sh/Pages/ShevelovG.aspx|title=Шевельов Юрій (Shevelov George) (довідка)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukma.kiev.ua/ua/general/pochesni/index.php Почесні професори НаУКМА]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 he published 2 volumes of his memoirs “Я – мене – мені…(і довкруги).”: Спогади.

He died in 2002 in New York.

* [[Antonovych prize]] (1988)

==Intellectual Contributions==

Shevelov prepared and published more than 600 scholarly texts concerning different aspects of the philology of the Ukrainian and other Slavic languages. From 1943 he developed the concept of the distinct establishment and development of Ukrainian and, later, Belarusian languages.  Shevelov argued against the commonly held view of an original, unified East Slavic language from which Ukrainian, Belarusian and Russian languages diverged and instead proposed the existence of several dialectical groups (Kieven-Pollisyan, Galician-Podolian, Polotsk-Smolensk, Novgorodian-Tversk, Murom-Ryazansk) that had been distinct from the beginning and which later formed into separate Ukrainian, Russian and Belarusian languages. According to Shevelov, the beginnings of a separate Ukrainian language could be traced to the 7th century while the language formed in approximately the 16th century &lt;ref name = "Zorivchak"&gt;[http://kameniar.franko.lviv.ua/cms/?Kamenyar:No1-2%2C_sichenmz-lyutii_2009_r.:Velikii_ukrayinsmzkii_filolog Great Ukrainian Philologist] On the 100 year Anniversary of the Birth of Yuri Shevelov by Roxolana Zorivchak, professor of the University of Lviv&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Ghent}}
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2013}}
[[File:Ghent, Ferraris Map, 1775.jpg|thumbnail|right|Ghent in 1775]]
Archaeological evidence shows human presence in the region of the confluence of Scheldt and Leie going back as far as the [[Stone Age]] and the [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref name="gent.be-history"&gt;{{cite web
|title=History of Gent
|url=http://www.gent.be/gent/english/history/gesch01.htm
|accessdate=5 May 2006

|archivedate=18 August 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most historians believe that the older name for Ghent, 'Ganda', is derived from the [[Celts|Celtic]] word ''ganda'' which means [[confluence]].&lt;ref name="gent.be-history"/&gt; Other sources connect its name with an obscure deity named [[Gontia (deity)|Gontia]].&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Room, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Placenames_of_the_World.html?id=EdmNngEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Placenames of the World: Origins and Meanings of the Names for 6,600 Countries, Cities, Territories, Natural Features, and Historic Sites''], McFarland, 2006, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no written records of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period, but archaeological research confirms that the region of Ghent was further inhabited.

When the [[Franks]] invaded the Roman territories from the end of the 4th century and well into the 5th century, they brought their language with them and Celtic and Latin were replaced by [[Old Dutch]].

===Middle Ages===
Around 650, [[Saint Amand]] founded two [[abbey]]s in Ghent: [[St. Peter's Abbey, Ghent|St. Peter's]] ([[Blandijnberg|Blandinium]]) and [[Saint Bavo's Abbey]]. The city grew from several nuclei, the abbeys and a commercial centre. Around 800, [[Louis the Pious]], son of [[Charlemagne]], appointed [[Einhard]], the biographer of Charlemagne, as abbot of both abbeys. In 851 and 879, the city was however attacked and plundered twice by the [[Viking]]s.
[[File:Engelbert Van Siclers - De Kouter in Ghent in 1763.jpg|277px|thumb|''De Kouter in Ghent in 1763'' by [[Engelbert van Siclers]]]]

Within the protection of the [[County of Flanders]], the city recovered and flourished from the 11th century, growing to become a small [[city-state]]. By the 13th century, Ghent was the biggest city in Europe north of the Alps after [[Paris]]; it was bigger than [[Cologne]] or [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicholas|first=David|title=The Domestic Life of a Medieval City: Women, Children and the Family in Fourteenth Century Ghent|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the city walls lived up to 65,000 people. The [[Belfry of Ghent|belfry]] and the towers of the [[Saint Bavo Cathedral]] and [[Saint Nicholas' Church, Ghent|Saint Nicholas' Church]] are just a few examples of the skyline of the period.

The rivers flowed in an area where much land was periodically flooded. These rich grass 'meersen' ("[[water-meadows]]": a word related to the English '[[marsh]]') were ideally suited for herding sheep, the wool of which was used for making cloth. During the Middle Ages Ghent was the leading city for [[cloth]].

The [[Wool#History|wool industry]], originally established at [[Bruges]], created the first European industrialized zone in Ghent in the High [[Middle Ages]]. The mercantile zone was so highly developed that wool had to be imported from [[Scotland]] and England. This was one of the reasons for Flanders' good relationship with [[Scotland#Medieval period|Scotland]] and [[History of England#England under the Plantagenets|England]]. Ghent was the birthplace of [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]], Duke of [[Duchy of Lancaster|Lancaster]]. Trade with England (but not Scotland) suffered significantly during the [[Hundred Years' War]].

===Early modern period===
The city recovered in the 15th century, when Flanders was united with neighbouring provinces under the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Dukes of Burgundy]]. High taxes [[Revolt of Ghent (1449–1453)|led to a rebellion]] and eventually the [[Battle of Gavere]] in 1453, in which Ghent suffered a terrible defeat at the hands of [[Philip the Good]]. Around this time the centre of political and social importance in the Low Countries started to shift from Flanders (Bruges–Ghent) to [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] ([[Antwerp]]–[[Brussels]]), although Ghent continued to play an important role. With Bruges, the city led two [[Flemish revolts against Maximilian of Austria|revolts against Maximilian of Austria]], the first monarch of the [[House of Habsburg]] to rule [[Flanders]].

[[File:Flickr - …trialsanderrors - Justitiepaleis, Ghent, Belgium, ca. 1895.jpg|left|thumb|The Palace of Justice in Ghent, c. 1895]]

In 1500, [[Juana of Castile]] gave birth to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who became [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and King of [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]]. Although native to Ghent, he punished the city after the 1539 [[Revolt of Ghent (1539)|Revolt of Ghent]] and obliged the city's nobles to walk in front of the Emperor barefoot with a noose (Dutch: ''"strop"'') around the neck; since this incident, the people of Ghent have been called "''Stroppendragers''" (noose bearers). Saint Bavo Abbey (not to be confused with the nearby Saint Bavo Cathedral) was abolished, torn down, and replaced with a fortress for [[Kingdom of Spain|Royal Spanish]] troops. Only a small portion of the abbey was spared demolition.

The late 16th and the 17th centuries brought devastation because of the [[Eighty Years' War]]. The war ended the role of Ghent as a centre of international importance. In 1745, the city [[Fall of Ghent|was captured]] by French forces during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] before being returned to the [[Austria|Empire of Austria]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; under the [[Habsburgs|House of Habsburg]] following the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1748, when this part of [[Flanders]] became known as the [[Austrian Netherlands]] until 1815, the exile of the French Emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon I]], the end of the French Revolutionary and later [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the peace treaties arrived at by the [[Congress of Vienna]].

===19th century===
In the 18th and 19th centuries, the textile industry flourished again in Ghent. [[Lieven Bauwens]], having smuggled the [[industrial revolution|industrial]] and factory machine plans out of [[England]], introduced the first mechanical [[Weaving machines|weaving machine]] on the [[European continent]] in 1800.

The [[Treaty of Ghent]], negotiated here and adopted on Christmas Eve 1814, formally ended the [[War of 1812]] between [[Great Britain]] and the [[United States]] (the North American phase of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]). After the [[Battle of Waterloo]], Ghent and [[Flanders]], previously ruled from the [[Habsburgs|House of Habsburg]] in [[Vienna]] as the [[Austrian Netherlands]], became a part of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] with the northern Dutch for 15 years. In this period, Ghent established its own [[Ghent University|university]] (1816)&lt;ref name="visit.gent.be"&gt;[https://visit.gent.be/en/good-know/practical-information/why-ghent/ghent-over-centuries Ghent over the centuries: Concise history of a stubborn city]&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Ghent–Terneuzen Canal|new connection to the sea]] (1824–27).

After the [[Belgian Revolution]], with the loss of port access to the sea for more than a decade, the local economy collapsed and the first Belgian trade union originated in Ghent. In 1913 there was a [[Exposition universelle et internationale (1913)|world exhibition in Ghent]].&lt;ref name="visit.gent.be"/&gt; As a preparation for these festivities, the [[Sint-Pieters railway station]] was completed in 1912.

===20th century===
Ghent was occupied by the Germans in both World Wars but escaped severe destruction. The life of the people and the German invaders in Ghent during [[World War I]] is described by H. Wandt in "etappenleven te Gent"{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. In [[World War II]] the city was liberated by the British [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th "Desert Rats" Armoured Division]] and local Belgian fighters on 6 September 1944.

==Tourism==
{{wide image|Gent.graslei.jpg|700px|The [[Graslei]] is one of the most scenic places in Ghent's old city centre}}

===Architecture===
[[File:Gent Gravensteen R01.jpg|thumb|The [[Gravensteen castle|Gravensteen]]]]
[[File:Ghent3.JPG|thumb|right|Historical centre of Ghent – from left to right: Old post office, [[Saint Nicholas' Church, Ghent|Saint-Nicholas Church]], [[Belfry of Ghent|Belfry]], and [[Saint Bavo Cathedral]].]]
[[File:Ghent canal, night.jpg|thumb|Ghent at Night]]
[[File:Riverside at Ghent at noon.jpg|thumb|Riverside in Ghent]]
[[File:Sunset over a canal in Ghent, Belgium.jpg|thumb|Sunset over the river [[Leie]] in Ghent]] &lt;!-- from the Koning Albertbrug, looking west --&gt;
Much of the city's [[medieval]] architecture remains intact and is remarkably well preserved and restored. Its centre is a [[Pedestrian zone|carfree area]]. Highlights are the [[Saint Bavo Cathedral]] with the ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', the [[belfry of Ghent|belfry]], the [[Gravensteen castle]], and the splendid architecture along the old [[Graslei]] harbour. Ghent has established a blend between comfort of living and history; it is not a city-museum. The city of Ghent also houses three [[béguinage]]s and numerous churches including Saint-Jacob's church, [[Saint Nicholas' Church, Ghent|Saint-Nicolas' church]], [[Saint Michael's church (Ghent)|Saint Michael's church]] and [[St. Stefanus, Ghent|St. Stefanus]].
[[File:Lamgods open.jpg|thumb|The well-known ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', a 15th century painting by Hubert and Jan Van Eyck in [[Saint Bavo Cathedral]].]] 
In the 19th century Ghent's most famous architect, [[Louis Roelandt]], built the university hall Aula, the opera house and the main courthouse. Highlights of modern architecture are the university buildings (the ''[[Boekentoren]]'' or Book Tower) by [[Henry Van de Velde]]. There are also a few theatres from diverse periods.

The beguinages, as well as the belfry and adjacent cloth hall, were recognized by [[UNESCO]] as [[World Heritage Sites]] in 1998 and 1999.

The [[Zebrastraat]], a social experiment in which an entirely renovated site unites living, economy and culture, can also be found in Ghent.

[[Campo Santo, Ghent|Campo Santo]] is a famous Catholic burial site of the nobility and artists.

===Museums===
Important museums in Ghent are the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent|Museum voor Schone Kunsten]] (Museum of Fine Arts), with paintings by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], and many Flemish masters; the [[Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst|SMAK]] or Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst (City Museum for Contemporary Art), with works of the 20th century, including [[Joseph Beuys]] and [[Andy Warhol]]; and the [[Design Museum Gent]] with masterpieces of [[Victor Horta]] and [[Le Corbusier]]. The [[Huis van Alijn]] (House of the Alijn family) was originally a [[beguinage]] and is now a museum for folk art where theatre and puppet shows for children are presented. The ''Museum voor Industriële Archeologie en Textiel'' or MIAT displays the industrial strength of Ghent with recreations of workshops and stores from the 1800s and original spinning and weaving machines that remain from the time when the building was a weaving mill. The [[Ghent City Museum]] (Stadsmuseum, abbreviated STAM), is committed to recording and explaining the city's past and its inhabitants, and to preserving the present for future generations.

===Restaurants and culinary traditions===
In Ghent and other regions of [[East-Flanders]], bakeries sell a donut-shaped bun called a "mastel" (plural "mastellen"), which is basically a bagel. "Mastellen" are also called "[[Saint Hubert]] bread", because on the Saint's feast day, which is 3 November, the bakers bring their batches to the early Mass to be blessed. Traditionally, it was thought that blessed mastellen immunized against [[rabies]].

Other local delicacies are the praline chocolates from local producers such as [[Leonidas (chocolate)|Leonidas]], the [[cuberdon]]s or 'neuzekes' ('noses'), cone-shaped purple jelly-filled candies, 'babelutten' ('babblers'), hard butterscotch-like candy, and of course, on the more fiery side, the famous 'Tierenteyn', a hot but refined mustard that has some affinity to French 'Dijon' mustard.

[[Carbonade flamande|Stoverij]] is a classic Flemish meat stew, preferably made with a generous addition of brown [[Trappist beer|'Trappist']] (strong abbey beer) and served with French fries. '[[Waterzooi]]' is a local stew originally made from freshwater fish caught in the rivers and creeks of Ghent, but nowadays often made with chicken instead of fish. It is usually served nouvelle-cuisine-style, and will be supplemented by a large pot on the side.

The city promotes a meat-free day on Thursdays called ''Donderdag Veggiedag''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vegetarisme.be/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=767 "Ghent's veggie day: for English speaking visitors"] on Vegetarisme.be&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8046970.stm "Belgian city plans 'veggie' days"] on [[BBC News]] (12 May 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; with [[vegetarian]] food being promoted in public canteens for civil servants and elected councillors, in all city funded schools, and promotion of vegetarian eating options in town (through the distribution of "veggie street maps"). This campaign is linked to the recognition of the [[Environmental effects of meat production#Fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions|detrimental environmental effects of meat production]], which the [[United Nations]]' [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] has established to represent nearly one-fifth of global [[greenhouse gas emissions]].

Ghent has the world's largest number of vegetarian restaurants per capita.&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-2508846/Belgium-breaks-The-best-way-glorious-Ghent-On-wheels-.html |title=Belgium breaks: The best way to see glorious Ghent? On two wheels...|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional confectionery is the [https://visit.gent.be/en/cuberdons cuberdon] (also known as neuzekes or little noses). These are conical sweets with a soft centre, usually raspberry but other flavours can be found on the many street stalls around the city. Between 2011 and 2015 a feud between two local vendors made international news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theculturetrip.com/europe/belgium/articles/a-tale-of-two-cuberdon-vendors-the-story-behind-ghents-little-nose-war/|title=A Tale of Two Cuberdon Vendors: The Story Behind Ghent’s 'Little Nose War'|first=Nana|last=Van De Poel|date=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Festivities===
The city is host to some big cultural events such as the [[Gentse Feesten]], [[I Love Techno]] in [[Flanders Expo]], the "10 Days Off" musical festival, the [[Flanders International Film Festival Ghent|International Film Festival of Ghent]] (with the [[World Soundtrack Awards]]) and the {{Interlanguage link multi|Gent Festival van Vlaanderen|nl}}. Also, every five years, an extensive botanical exhibition (''Gentse Floraliën'') takes place in [[Flanders Expo]] in Ghent, attracting numerous visitors to the city.

The [[Festival of Flanders]] had its 50th celebration in 2008. In Ghent it opens with the OdeGand City festivities that takes place on the second Saturday of September. Some 50 concerts take place in diverse locations throughout the medieval [[inner city]] and some 250 international artists perform. Other major Flemish cities hold similar events, all of which form part of the Festival of Flanders (Antwerp with ''[[Laus Polyphoniae]]''; Bruges with ''[[MAfestival Brugge|MAfestival]]''; Brussels with ''KlaraFestival''; Limburg with ''Basilica'', Mechelen and Brabant with ''Novecento'' and ''Transit'').

The city of Ghent will co-host the 2020 [[World Choir Games]] together with the city of [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.interkultur.com/newsroom/choir-games/details/news/double-gold-for-next-host-country-of-the-world-choir-games-2020/|title=Double gold for next host country of the World Choir Games 2020/|website=INTERKULTUR|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organised by the [[Interkultur Foundation]], the World Choir Games is the biggest choral competition and festival in the world.

===Nature===
The numerous parks in the city can also be considered tourist attractions. Most notably, Ghent boasts a [[nature reserve]] ([[Bourgoyen-Ossemeersen]], 230 hectare&lt;ref name="nature reserve"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitgent.be/en/natuur-en-milieucentrum-de-bourgoyen |title=Nature Domain De Bourgoyen &amp;#124; Visit Gent |publisher=visitgent.be|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and a recreation park (Blaarmeersen, 87 hectares).&lt;ref name="inyourpocket"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inyourpocket.com/Belgium/Ghent/Sightseeing/Parks-and-Gardens/Blaarmeersen-Sport-and-Recreation-Park_102502v |title=Blaarmeersen Sport and Recreation Park - Sightseeing in Ghent |website=inyourpocket.com |accessdate=18 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520042928/http://www.inyourpocket.com/Belgium/Ghent/Sightseeing/Parks-and-Gardens/Blaarmeersen-Sport-and-Recreation-Park_102502v |archivedate=20 May 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
The [[port of Ghent]], in the north of the city, is the third largest port of Belgium. It is accessed by the [[Ghent–Terneuzen Canal]], which ends near the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] port of [[Terneuzen]] on the [[Western Scheldt]]. The port houses, among others, large companies like [[ArcelorMittal]], [[Volvo Cars]], [[Volvo Trucks]], [[Volvo Parts]], [[Honda]], and [[Stora Enso]].

The [[Ghent University]] and a number of research oriented companies, such as Ablynx, Innogenetics, Cropdesign and Bayer Cropscience, are situated in the central and southern part of the city.

As the largest city in East Flanders, Ghent has many hospitals, schools and shopping streets. [[Flanders Expo]], the biggest event hall in Flanders and the second biggest in Belgium, is also located in Ghent. Tourism is becoming a major employer in the local area. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Recently a local business man donated a substantial amount of money to have all the kerbs lowered by two inches in the city

'''''Hack Attack: How the Truth Caught Up with Rupert Murdoch''''' is a 2014 book about the [[News International phone hacking scandal]] by the British investigative journalist [[Nick Davies]].&lt;ref name="Davies2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Davies|title=Hack Attack: How the truth caught up with Rupert Murdoch|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LVjyAQAAQBAJ|date=31 July 2014|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4481-1434-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hack Attack'' was published by [[Random House]]'s imprint [[Chatto and Windus]] in the United Kingdom, by [[House of Anansi Press]] (Canada) and by [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]]'s imprint Faber and Faber Inc, in the USA.&lt;ref name=Bookseller&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/phone-hacking-truth-revealed-nick-davies-book.html|title=Phone hacking 'truth' revealed in Nick Davies book|publisher=[[The Bookseller]]|date=26 June 2014|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://houseofanansi.com/products/hack-attack-digital&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
''Hack Attack'' is Davies's first book since his 2008 work on the British press, ''Flat Earth News''. Davies began work on ''Hack Attack'' in July 2011 at the same time that parliamentarian [[Tom Watson (Labour politician)|Tom Watson]] began work on his work on the phone hacking scandal, ''[[Dial M for Murdoch]]''.&lt;ref name=GuardJul11&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2011/jul/26/phone-hacking-rupert-murdoch|title=Hack Attack review – Nick Davies's gripping account of the hacking affair|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|author=[[Roy Greenslade]]|date=26 July 2011|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davies and Watson subsequently met and discussed their respective projects.&lt;ref name=GuardJul11/&gt;

==Structure==
The book contains sixteen chapters divided into three sections; 'Crime and Concealment', 'The Power Game' and 'Truth'. The book is prefaced by a 'Who's Who' of people mentioned in the book and an author's note. An epilogue ends the book, followed by an appendix that lists 41 [[private investigator]]s that were used by British newspapers; many of whom have been convicted of various crimes.&lt;ref name="Davies, 2014, 409" &gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2014|p=409}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extensive bibliography with links to the media and sources used in the book and exhibits are at [http://vintagehackattack.wordpress.com/ the book's webpages].

==Reception==
[[Henry Porter (journalist)|Henry Porter]] positively reviewed ''Hack Attack'' in ''[[The Guardian]]'', calling it a "gripping account".&lt;ref name=GuardAug314&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/hack-attack-nick-davies-review-gripping-account-hacking-affair|title=Hack Attack review – Nick Davies's gripping account of the hacking affair|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|author=[[Henry Porter (journalist)|Henry Porter]]|date=3 August 2014|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porter wrote that "This book is important, not simply because it is written by a superb reporter who took on a seemingly invulnerable criminal conspiracy, or because it is, even after Leveson and the months of evidence in court, the best account we have of the phone-hacking scandal and the attendant police corruption and cover-ups. It is, as well, the story of modern Britain and how its standards and politics have been degraded by one man's ruthless acquisition of power...Davies has laid it all bare in an exciting, clear and honest narrative..."&lt;ref name=GuardAug314/&gt; Porter concluded by describing the book as deserving "a lot of praise and success. It is a masterly summary of the hacking affair, as well as the ingenuity and persistence that lead to great journalism."&lt;ref name=GuardAug314/&gt; Porter reserved his sole criticism for the book's [[subtitle (titiling)|subtitle]], as he felt that the truth "hasn't yet" caught up with [[Rupert Murdoch]]; the subsequent reorganization of [[News Corporation]] in the wake of the scandal left the company and the Murdoch family substantially enriched.&lt;ref name=GuardAug314/&gt; [[Peter Wilby]] also positively reviewed ''Hack Attack'' in ''The Guardian''.&lt;ref name=GuardAug2114&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/21/hack-attack-truth-rupert-murdoch-nick-davies-review|title=Hack Attack: How the Truth Caught Up With Rupert Murdoch by Nick Davies – review|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|author=[[Peter Wilby]]|date=21 August 2014|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Lloyd gave a largely positive review in the ''[[Financial Times]]'', writing that "What is revealed here, in painful, careful detail, is a journalism that held power in contempt – and, together with power, held in contempt people both famed and obscure, dominant and meek," and that Davies in "his exhumation of this trove of journalistic ordure, done a colossal service to Britain’s democracy."&lt;ref name=FTAug114&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/01d98bb4-18b9-11e4-933e-00144feabdc0.html|title='Hack Attack: How the Truth Caught Up with Rupert Murdoch', by Nick Davies|author=John Lloyd|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=2 August 2014|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd ends his review by describing ''Hack Attack'' as "the book of a very bold reporter about a passage of arms that he won, to our great benefit."&lt;ref name=FTAug114/&gt;

[[David Carr (journalist)|David Carr]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote that Davies was "...just the kind of person you don't want to have on your tail...He wages a ground war to get at the truth, which comes less in one single “aha” moment than as a slow drip of facts penetrating a tissue of lies. Evidence is destroyed just before he gets his hands on it, the police redact documents so as to denude them of value. Then, just in the nick of time, a confidential source or secret document arrives. In that sense, the book moves right along, from cliffhanger to cliffhanger."&lt;ref name=NYTAug214&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/31/books/review/hack-attack-about-a-rupert-murdoch-papers-trials-by-nick-davies.html|title=Notes on a Scandal|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|author=[[David Carr (journalist)|David Carr]]|date=2 August 2014|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr wrote that "There is so much excess and human pathology on display here, it makes ''Bonfire of the Vanities'' seem restrained."&lt;ref name=NYTAug214/&gt; Carr also criticized the book's subtitle, writing that "...the truth never catches up with Murdoch. True enough, he loves newspapering and has been known to become deeply involved in editorial matters, but no real case is made that he knew the specifics of how his papers were coming up with very private facts about public figures."&lt;ref name=NYTAug214/&gt; Carr concludes by opining that "It is, in the best way, an old story. A lone gunslinger takes on a dishonest town, and in the end the bad guys flee. It is both more complicated and a bit less satisfying in reality, but that would be another book, and probably a less enjoyable one."&lt;ref name=NYTAug214/&gt;

In ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' [[Peter Oborne]] described Davies as "Britain’s greatest investigative journalist" in his five star review of the book, adding that it was "as exciting as a thriller but far more important because it provides such a horrifying portrait of the media/political class that has governed Britain in recent years...This book should be compulsory reading in journalism schools and must be read by anyone who wishes to understand how British politics actually works."&lt;ref name=Teleg1Aug4&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/11002795/Hack-Attack-How-the-Truth-Caught-Up-with-Rupert-Murdoch-by-Nick-Davies-review-exciting-and-important.html|title=Hack Attack: How the Truth Caught Up with Rupert Murdoch by Nick Davies, review: 'exciting and important'|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=1 August 2014|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more critical review came from Will Gore in ''The Independent'' who wrote that Davies 'knows how to weave a compelling tale', and that his 'account of how Murdoch and his dysfunctional lieutenants ensnared, enslaved, and frightened generations of politicians is blistering. His unpicking of Scotland Yard’s early failure properly to investigate phone-hacking is terrific – and depressing.'&lt;ref name=IndAug14&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/hack-attack-by-nick-davies--book-review-9642724.html|title=Hack Attack by Nick Davies - book review|publisher=[[The Independent]]|author=Will Gore|date=3 August 2014|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gore concluded by with the belief that while ''Hack Attack'' is a 'great read' its outlook 'sometimes feels a little too black and white: you are either with us or against us.'&lt;ref name=IndAug14/&gt;

Two reviewers critiqued Davies's epilogue to ''Hack Attack'' that was critical of [[neo-liberalism]]. Gore wrote that "Davies may be on the side of the just. But he is as ideologically driven as those he despises. In the end, his real target is neo-liberalism, which “has reversed hundreds of years of struggle” and undermined the protection offered by democratic governments to ordinary working people"&lt;ref name=IndAug14/&gt; Lloyd wrote that Davies made a mistake by ending the book "with a rant on neoliberalism. It’s a subject too important for an epilogue of a few pages; it hasn’t featured much in the preceding narrative; and it’s hard to agree that it is triumphing in a country, the UK, with a mixed and quite regulated economy whose most popular institutions are the thoroughly socialised NHS and the publicly owned BBC – which, to be sure, the Murdoch papers paint as monsters."&lt;ref name=FTAug114/&gt;

Positive reviews of ''Hack Attack'' were also written by Martin Hickman in ''[[The Independent]]'',&lt;ref name=IndJul14&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/hack-attack-by-nick-davies-book-review-9639659.html|title=Hack Attack by Nick Davies, book review: A panoramic account of the hacking scandal|publisher=[[The Independent]]|author=Martin Hickman|date=19 July 2014|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik Wemple]] in the ''[[Washington Post]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/book-review-hack-attack-on-rupert-murdoch-by-nick-davies/2014/08/07/de18f6de-1be6-11e4-ae54-0cfe1f974f8a_story.html|title=Book review: ‘Hack Attack,’ on Rupert Murdoch, by Nick Davies|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|author=[[Erik Wemple]]|date=8 August 2014|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Kennedy in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'',&lt;ref name=BGAug14&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2014/08/09/review-hack-attack-the-inside-story-how-truth-caught-with-rupert-murdoch-nick-davies/1yooE4CYCpWPlNT52BnDBP/story.html|title='Hack Attack' by Nick Davies|publisher=[[The Boston Globe]]|author=Dan Kennedy|date=9 August 2014|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kirkus Reviews]],&lt;ref name=Kirkus&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/nick-davies/hack-attack/|title=Hack Attack|publisher=[[Kirkus Reviews]]|date=15 August 2014|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ryan Chittum in the [[Columbia Journalism Review]].&lt;ref name=CJR&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/a_lonely_fight.php?page=all|title=Guardian reporter battles the British power elite|author=Ryan Chittum|publisher=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|date=7 August 2014|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1171">The '''Hart–Dworkin debate''' is a debate in [[legal philosophy]] between [[H. L. A. Hart]] and [[Ronald Dworkin]]. At the heart of the debate lies a Dworkinian critique of Hartian [[legal positivism]], specifically, the theory presented in Hart's book ''[[The Concept of Law]]''.

While Hart insists that judges are within bounds to legislate on the basis of rules of law, Dworkin strives to show that in these cases, judges work from a set of 'principles' which they use to formulate judgements, and that these principles either form the basis, or can be extrapolated from the present rules.

'''''How It Should Have Ended''''' ('''HISHE''') is an [[Animation|animated]] webseries that parodies popular films by creating alternate endings and pointing out various flaws. Endings for many major movies have been presented, using the tagline ‘sometimes movies don't finish the way we'd like’.

== History ==

''How It Should Have Ended'' began after Daniel Baxter and Tommy Watson started discussing alternate endings for a movie they had watched. In 2005 their first animation ''How Matrix Revolutions Should Have Ended'' was completed and soon after in July 2005 the website was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.howitshouldhaveended.com/about-hishe|title = About How It Should Have Ended|date = |accessdate = October 30, 2015|website = www.howitshouldhaveended.com|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130724055833/http://www.howitshouldhaveended.com/about-hishe|archivedate = July 24, 2013|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christina "Tina" Alexander,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Howitshouldhaveended.com Whois Lookup - Who.is - Who.is|url = http://who.is/whois/www.howitshouldhaveended.com|website = who.is|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has previously worked with Daniel, joined the team shortly thereafter.

=== HISHE Features ===

On May 12, 2015 HISHE launched a series named 'HISHE Features'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLimhOT0Avg-Tn_GnqJ94tDhr0RdoRBOLC&amp;ab_channel=HowItShouldHaveEnded|title=HISHE Features: _______ - YouTube|work=youtube.com|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This series aims to put the spotlight on lesser known YouTube animators or movie related channels. It is also used to bridge the gap between HISHE's own videos.

The series has been a success, both in terms of views and features, which include Ricepirate, OnlyLeigh, BrotherhoodWorkshop as well as Hank and Jed. The series has however received some criticism from fans who believe the content is not up to par with HISHE's own and could therefore damage their reputation. HISHE has responded by refuting these claims stating that it is beneficial to all parties involved.

=== HISHE Kids ===
HISHE launched an additional channel called HISHE Kids, with the show ''Fixed Fairy Tales''.

== Super Cafe / Villain's Pub ==
The ''Super Cafe / Villain's Pub'' is a segment that debuted at the end of ''How Superman Should Have Ended'' which featured [[Superman]] discussing the alternate events of the 1978 ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' film in a cafe with [[Batman]], which began the trend of the ''Super Cafe''. Though it is thought to be based on ''[[Seinfeld]]'', the clips are actually based on the final scene of Daniel Baxter's favorite film, ''[[Swingers (1996 film)|Swingers]]'', with Superman standing in for Trent and Batman standing in for Mike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=56sEJKjD95M|title=Super Cafe: Swingers Tribute|first=|last=How It Should Have Ended|date=11 April 2013|publisher=|accessdate=22 February 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In various superhero episodes of ''How it Should have Ended'', altered or added scenes are shown from the superhero film, followed by the superheroes that appear in the movie interacting with Batman and Superman (both voiced by Daniel Baxter) in the Super Cafe; it also always appears at the end of each episode. The Super Cafe segment is featured in every superhero film the series has covered so far. Superman and Batman also make a brief appearance in a cafe in the ''How [[Pulp Fiction]] Should Have Ended''. The segment was also used in the [[Nostalgia Critic]]'s review of ''Man of Steel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic/41449-man-of-steel|title= Man of Steel|date= November 2, 2013|website= That Guy With the Glasses|publisher= [[Nostalgia Critic]]|accessdate= December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A companion segment called the "Villain Pub" which features many popular villains like [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]], [[Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] and many more began with ''How [[Thor: The Dark World]] Should Have Ended''. In those segments, [[Emperor Palpatine]] is the bartender and [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] is the bouncer (bownser). 

There are numerous running gags in the Super Cafe segments, the most notable being in which Batman always explains his various accomplishments and abilities or finds some kind of excuse to say his catchphrase ''"Because I'm Batman!"'', much to Superman’s irritation. In the ''Suicide Squad'' HISHE, Batman discovers the Villain Pub and in the Villain Pub episode "Boss Battle", goes to confront the villains congregating there, nearly successfully, only to be tempted by Emperor Palpatine by his weakness – the ladies. It is then that Harley Quinn, who had used her vexing charms to be allowed back into the pub, knocks out Batman from behind. Batman is then taken into the cellar to be fed to shark Jaws who is comically depicted as talking in a high-pitched voice, chained up and stripped of his equipment. He barely escapes after being rescued by Dr. Strange, a fact that is reiterated in the ''Doctor Strange'' HISHE (which also cryptically contained a spoiler for the ''Avengers: Infinity War'' trailer). Later, in the ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'' HISHE, things begin to take a turn for the dire when Ayesha, disgusted by heroes congregating in a cafe to meet, decides to punish heroes whom she blames for her failure by destroying their cafe and unleashes her superweapon Martha (a parody of Adam from the actual end-credits scene of ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'' and choosing the name to taunt both Batman and Superman for their mothers having the same name). The arrival of Martha to decimate the cafe is foreshadowed in further videos like the ''Wonder Woman'' and ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' HISHE videos. At last, in the ''Justice League'' HISHE video, Martha (voiced by James Rallison) arrives and succeeds in his primary objective of destroying the cafe but upon facing the Justice League, joined by Green Lantern, who comically resembles [[Steve Trevor]], gets his neck snapped by Superman, much to the irritation of Batman, who had wanted to take down Martha through his own plan. The cafe is later rebuilt by Black Panther in the ''Black Panther'' HISHE video.

[[File:Huldah Gates3344.JPG|thumb|Reconstruction of the Hulda Gates.]]
The '''Huldah Gates''' ({{lang-he|שערי חולדה}}, ''Sha'arei Hulda'') are the two sets of now-blocked gates in the [[Southern Wall]] of the [[Temple Mount]], situated in [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Jerusalem's Old City]]. The western set is a double arched gate (the '''Double Gate'''), and the eastern is a triple arched gate (the '''Triple Gate'''). Each arch of the double gate led into an aisle of a passageway leading from the gate into the Mount, and to steps leading to the Mount's surface; when the [[al-Aqsa Mosque]] was built, the old steps were blocked, and the eastern aisle lengthened so that new steps from its end would exit north of the Mosque. The triple gate is similar, though the longer aisle is to the west, and its third aisle, on the east, forms the western boundary of the vaulted area known as ''[[Solomon's Stables]]''.

==Etymology==
The name "Huldah gates" is taken from the description of the Temple Mount in the [[Mishnah]] (Tractate of Midot 1:3).&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Judaica (ed. 1972), vol. 15, pp. 963-4&lt;/ref&gt; Accepted opinion amongst scholars is that the Mishna's description refers to the sanctified area of the Temple Mount in the [[Hasmonean]] period. Therefore, calling the gates found in the current southern wall "Huldah" would be an [[anachronism]], as the base of that wall is part of [[Herod the Great|Herod]]'s post-Hasmonean extension of the Temple Mount.

Two possible etymologies are given for the name: "Huldah" means "mole" or "mouse" in Hebrew, and the tunnels leading up from these gates called to mind the holes or tunnels used by these animals. Alternatively, in a possible folk etymology, the [[First Temple]] prophetess [[Huldah]]&lt;ref&gt;2 Kgs 22:14-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Judaica (ed. 1972), vol. 8, p. 1063&lt;/ref&gt; was said to have held court in this area and, indeed, her tomb&lt;ref&gt;(Tos. Neg. 6:2)Encyclopædia Judaica (ed. 1972), vol. 9, p. 1553&lt;/ref&gt; was placed here by some as well.

==Archaeology==
The 19th century excavations of the area by [[Charles Warren]]&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Judaica (ed. 1972), vol. 9, p. 1525&lt;/ref&gt; discovered an erratic series of passageways under the triple gate, some leading below the wall and beyond the Mount's southern edge. The purpose and age of these passages are unknown, and more recent archaeologists have not been allowed to investigate due to the political volatility of the site. The passageways from both gates are now used by the [[waqf]] as [[mosque]]s.

In 1996, Wurmser participated in a study that led to the report, ''[[A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm]]'', a paper prepared for the [[Likud]] party leader and then incoming [[Israel]]i Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], and suggested a new approach to solving Israel's security problems in the Middle East with an emphasis on "Western values" and the abandonment of traditional "[[land for peace]]" negotiations with the [[Palestinians]].&lt;ref&gt;Daily Telegraph, London, 5 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Other study participants included such notable [[neoconservative]]s as [[Richard Perle]], [[David Wurmser]], and [[Douglas Feith]].

In 2008, Wurmser was listed as a member of the board of advisors of the [[Endowment for Middle East Truth]], a group which was involved in the distribution of 28 million DVDs of the film [[Obsession: Radical Islam's War Against the West]] in [[swing state]]s prior to the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 US Presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=43983 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015014835/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=43983 |archivedate=2008-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style and genre ==
At the start of Zālīte’s career, during the time of her first significant publication of poem “Balādīte” in the magazine “Karogs” in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://literatura.lv/darbs/Baladite/414948|title=Balādīte|website=literatura.lv|language=lv|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the main ideas in her poetry were about life and youth in the 1970s — looking for the meaning of life, development of personality, values, and overcoming the problems of life.

Alongside with poetry, Zālīte has written drama. In the 1980s, the writer focused more on the philosophical and emotional motifs combining history and modern times as well as referencing ongoing social and political issues, often associated with Latvian culture and mythology. The tragic Latvian fate and nation’s longing for freedom is best depicted in the poetry collection “Debesis, debesis” (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marazalite.lv/2011/02/21/debesis-debesis/|title=Debesis, debesis : Māra Zālīte|website=www.marazalite.lv|language=lv-LV|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, her playwriting developed as a continuation of her poetry. She has written a handful of plays and librettos combining strong individual characters with topics of history, myths and national identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=300 Baltic Writers: Estonia Latvia Lithuania.

At the end of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, Zālīte’s 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; poetry collection “Apkārtne” (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marazalite.lv/2011/02/18/apkartne-2/|title=Apkārtne : Māra Zālīte|website=www.marazalite.lv|language=lv-LV|access-date=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; pictured a person aware of his surroundings and the problems he faces – freedom, chaos, hope, loss and depression. 

In all of the author's literary career her works have been strongly influenced by her childhood&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=SatoriSarunas|title=Māra Zālīte sarunā ar Satori|date=2014-04-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhxlNFmoDG0|accessdate=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is best depicted in her first prose works – the [[Autobiographical novel|autobiographical novels]] “Five fingers” (2013) and “Paradīzes putni”(2018) that talk about occupation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://okupacijasmuzejs.lv/lv/latvijas-okupacijas-vesture/neatkariga-latvija/deportaciju-atceres-tradicija-latvija|title=Neatkarīgā Latvija - Latvijas Okupācijas muzejs|last=muzejs|first=Latvijas Okupācijas|website=Latvijas Okupācijas muzejs|language=lv-LV|access-date=2018-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and childhood spent in the Soviet Union’s regime.

A '''notary in the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]]''' of the [[Catholic Church]] ([[ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]]: ''notarius'') is a person appointed by competent authority to draw up official or authentic documents. These documents are issued chiefly from the official administrative bureaux, the chanceries; secondly, from tribunals; lastly, others are drawn up at the request of individuals to authenticate their contracts or other acts. The public officials appointed to draw up these three classes of papers have been usually called notaries.

==Etymology==
Etymologically, a notary is one who takes notes. Notes are signs or cursory abbreviations to record the words uttered, so that they may be reproduced later in ordinary writing. Notaries were at first private secretaries, attached to the service of persons in positions of importance. It was natural for the science of notes to be in high esteem among those employed in recording the transactions of public boards, and for the name notary to be applied to these officials; so that before long the word was used to signify their occupation.

==History==
{{see also|Legal history of the Catholic Church}}
The title and office existed at the Imperial Court (cf. Cod. Theod., VI, 16, "De primicerio et notariis"), whence they passed into all the royal chanceries, though in the course of time the term notary ceased to be used. This was the case also with the chanceries of the pope, the great episcopal sees, and even every bishopric.

There are grounds for doubting whether the seven regional notaries of the Roman Church, one for each ecclesiastical district of the Holy City, were instituted by St. Clement and appointed by him to record the Acts of the martyrs, as is said in the "Liber Pontificalis";&lt;ref&gt;"Vita Clementis", ed. Duchesne, I, 123&lt;/ref&gt; they date back, however, to an early age.

==''Primicerius'' and ''secundicerius''==
Not only were there notaries as soon as a bureau for ecclesiastical documents was established, but in very ancient days we find these notaries forming a kind of college presided over by a ''primicerius''; the notice of [[Pope Julius I]] in the "Liber Pontificalis" relates that this pope ordered an account of the property of the Church, intended as an authentic document, to be drawn up before the ''primicerius'' of the notaries.

The notaries were in the ranks of the clergy and must have received one of the minor orders; for the notariate is an office and not an order. At intervals the popes entrusted the notaries of their ''curia'' with various missions. Their chief, the ''primicerius'', with whom a ''secundicerius'' is sometimes found later, was a very important personage, in fact, the head of the [[Apostolic Chancery|pontifical chancery]]; during the vacancy of the papal chair, he formed part of the interim Government, and a letter in 640 (Jaffé, "Regesta", n. 2040) is signed (the pope being elected but not yet consecrated) by one "Joannes primicerius et servans locum s. sedis apostolicae".

==Protonotary Apostolic==
{{main|Protonotary Apostolic}}
There were of course many notaries in the service of the pontifical chancery; the seven regional notaries preserved a certain pre-eminence over the others and became the protonotary (also spelled "prothonotaries"), whose name and office continued. The ordinary notaries of the chancery, however, were gradually known by other names, according to their various functions, so that the term ceased to be employed in the pontifical and other chanceries. The prothonotaries were and still are a college of prelates, enjoying numerous privileges; they are known as "participants", but outside of Rome there are many purely honorary prothonotaries. The official duties had insensibly almost ceased; but Pius X in his reorganization of the Roman Curia has appointed participant prothonotaries to the chancery (Const. "Sapienti", 29 June 1908). A corresponding change occurred in the bureaux of the episcopal churches, abbeys, etc.; the officials attached to the chancery have ceased to be known as notaries and are called chancellor, secretary, etc. Lastly, mention must be made of the notaries of the synodal or conciliar assemblies, whose duties are limited to the duration of the assembly.

==Notaries of canonical tribunals==
Society in former times did not recognize the separation of powers; so, too, in the Church the judicial authority was vested in the same prelates as the administrative. Soon, however, contentious matters were tried separately before a specially appointed body.

The courts required a staff to record the transactions; these clerks were likewise notaries. In most civil courts they are, however, called registrars, clerks of the court, etc., but in the ecclesiastical tribunals they retain the name notary, though they are also called '''"actuaries"'''.

Thus the special law of the higher [[ecclesiastical tribunals]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;can. v and xxxv&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Tribunal of the Roman Rota]] and the [[Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura]], reorganized by [[Pope Pius X|St. Pius X]], provides for the appointment of notaries for these two tribunals. The reason why the head official charged with drawing up the documents of the [[Holy Office]] is called the notary, as were the clerks who in former times drew up the records of the [[Inquisition]], is, doubtless, that of all the [[Roman Congregations]] the [[Holy Office]] is the only real judicial tribunal.

The notaries of ecclesiastical tribunals are usually clerics; the duties may however be confided to laymen, except in criminal cases against a cleric.

==Public notaries==
Finally, there is the class of persons to whom the term notary is restricted in common parlance, to wit, those who are appointed by the proper authorities to witness the documentary proceedings between private persons and to impress them with legal authenticity. They are not engaged in the chanceries, in order that they may be within easy reach of private individuals; they have a public character, so that their records, drawn up according to rule, are received as authentic accounts of the particular transaction, especially agreements, contracts, testaments, and wills.

Consequently, public notaries may be appointed only by those authorities who possess jurisdiction ''in foro externo'', and have a chancery, e.g. popes, bishops, emperors, reigning princes, and of course only within the limits of their jurisdiction; moreover, the territory within which a notary can lawfully exercise his functions is expressly determined. There were formerly Apostolic notaries and even episcopal notaries, duly commissioned by papal or episcopal letters, whose duty it was to receive documents relating to ecclesiastical or mixed affairs, especially in connection with benefices, foundations, and donations in favor of churches, wills of clerics, etc. They no longer exist; the only ecclesiastical notaries at present are the officials of the Roman and episcopal ''curiae''. Moreover, these notaries were layman, and [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] forbids clerics to acts as scriveners.&lt;ref group=note&gt;c. viii, "Ne clerici vel monachi", 1. III, tit. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''object language''' is a [[language]] which is the "object" of study in various fields including [[logic]], [[linguistics]], [[mathematics]], and [[theoretical computer science]].  The language being used to talk about an object language is called a [[metalanguage]].  An object language may be a [[formal language|formal]] or [[natural language|natural]] language.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

== Forms of object language ==
=== Formal languages ===

[[Mathematical logic]] and [[linguistics]] make use of metalanguages, which are languages for describing the nature of other languages. In mathematical logic, the object language is usually a [[formal language]]. The language which a metalanguage is used to describe is the object language. It is called that because that language is the object under discussion using the metalanguage.

For instance, someone who says "In French, you say ''Bonjour'' to greet someone" uses [[English language|English]] as a metalanguage to describe the object language [[French language|French]].

=== Computer languages ===

There are two ways the term ''object language'' can be used in computing: a language which is the object of formal specification, and a language which is the object (goal) of a compiler or interpreter.

==== Formal specification ====

{{Main|Specification language}}

Computer languages are object languages of the metalanguage in which their [[specification]] is written. In computer science this is referred to as the [[specification language]]. [[Backus–Naur form]] was one of the earliest used specification languages.

When [[compiler]]s are written using systems like [[lex (software)|lex]] and [[yacc]], the rules the programmer writes look much like a formal specification, but it is considered an [[implementation]] instead. Many [[programming language implementation]]s are not strictly the same as their specifications, adding features or making implementation-dependent design decisions.

==== Object Code ====

{{Main|Object file}}

At their basic level, computers act on what is given to them through a limited set of instructions which are understood by their [[CPU]]s. In the earliest computers, that meant programmers sometimes composed actual 1's and 0's to program. Since this requires considerable programmer training (and patience) to create instructions, later computer languages have gone to great lengths to simplify the programmer's task. For example, a high level programming language may allow a programmer to assign a value to a variable without specifying a memory location or a CPU instruction.

In this context, the high level programming language is the ''source language'', which is then translated by a [[compiler]] into [[object code]] that the CPU can read directly. This object code is the ''object language'', and varies depending on what CPU is being given the instructions.

''Object language'' in this context means something akin to "the object of what the programmer is trying to achieve". If the source language and object languages are viewed as formal (logical) languages, what the compiler does is ''interpret'' the source into the target language (this is different from the computer science use of ''[[interpreted language]]'' meaning one which is ''not'' compiled).

''Object language'' in this context is synonymous with ''target language''.  The object language of a translation most often is a [[machine language]], but can be some other kind of language, such as [[assembly language]].

Because the object language of compilation has usually been machine language, the term ''[[object file]]'' has come to mean a file containing machine instructions, and sometimes the translated program itself is simply called an ''object''.

''Object language'' should also not be confused with ''[[object-oriented language]]'', which is a type of computer [[programming language]] which changes the programmer's environment into convenient objects which can be used in something similar to a drag-and-drop fashion.

== Expressions in an object language ==
=== Symbols ===
{{Main|Symbol (formal)}}

A ''symbol'' is an [[idea]], [[abstraction]] or [[concept]], [[type-token distinction|token]]s of which may be marks or a configuration of marks which form a particular pattern. Although the term "symbol" in common use refers at some times to the idea being symbolized, and at other times to the marks on a piece of paper or chalkboard which are being used to express that idea; in the [[formal language]]s studied in [[mathematics]] and [[logic]], the term "symbol" refers to the idea, and the marks are considered to be a [[type-token distinction|token]] instance of the symbol.

=== Formulas ===
{{Main|Well-formed formula}}

In the formal languages used in mathematical logic and computer science, a ''well-formed formula'' or simply ''formula'' is an [[idea]], [[abstraction]] or [[concept]] which is expressed using the [[symbol (formal)|symbol]]s and [[formation rule]]s (also called the [[formal grammar]]) of a particular formal language. To say that a [[string (computer science)|string]] of symbols &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a well-formed formula with respect to a given formal grammar &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to saying that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the language generated by &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Formal systems ===
{{Main|Formal system}}

A ''formal system'' is a [[formal language]] together with a [[deductive system]] which consists of a set of [[inference rule]]s and/or [[axiom]]s. A formal system is used to [[formal proof|derive]] one expression from one or more other expressions previously expressed in the system. These expressions are called [[axiom]]s, in the case of those previously supposed to be true, or [[theorem]]s, in the case of those derived. A formal system may be formulated and studied for its intrinsic properties, or it may be intended as a description (i.e. a [[Interpretation (logic)|model]]) of external phenomena.

=== Theorems ===
{{Main|Theorem}}

A ''theorem'' is a [[symbol (formal)|symbol]] or string of symbols which is [[formal proof|derived]] by using a [[formal system]]. The string of symbols is a [[logical consequence]] of the [[axiom]]s and [[rule of inference|rules]] of the system.

=== Formal proofs ===
{{Main|Formal proof}}

A ''formal proof'' or ''derivation'' is a finite sequence of [[proposition]]s (called [[well-formed formula]]s in the case of a [[formal language]]) each of which is an [[axiom]] or follows from the preceding sentences in the sequence by a [[rule of inference]]. The last sentence in the sequence is a [[theorem]] of a [[formal system]]. The concept of [[natural deduction]] is a [[generalization]] of the concept of proof.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]], ''deduction''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theories ===
{{Main|Theory (mathematical logic)}}

A ''theory'' is a set of [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]]s in a [[formal language]].

'''Sir Olaf Kirkpatrick Kruuse Caroe''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|KCSI|KCIE}} (15 November 1892 – 23 November 1981) was an administrator in [[British India]], working for the [[Indian Civil Service]] and the [[Indian Political Service]].  He served as the Governor of the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North-West Frontier Province]]. He was a strategist of the [[Great Game]] and the [[Cold War]] on the southern periphery of the Soviet Union. His ideas are believed to have been highly influential in shaping the post-War policies of Britain and the United States.

== Early life ==
Olaf Caroe was the son of architect [[William Douglas Caroe]] and Grace Desborough Rendall. He was educated at [[Winchester College]] and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Personal recollections of Sir Olaf Caroe |url=http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb206-liddlecollectionind08 |publisher=university of Leeds Special Collections |accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he read classics. He served in the army in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in [[World War I]], and joined the [[Indian Civil Service]] in 1919.{{sfn|Brobst, The Future of the Great Game|2005|p=xvi}}

==Career==
Caroe subsequently move to the [[Indian Political Service]], where he was influential in foreign policy. He served as the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India through the [[World War II]]. After the war, he was appointed as the Governor of the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North-West Frontier Province]] (NWFP), on the northwest border of the Indian subcontinent, adjoining Afghanistan and Russia.{{sfn|Brobst, Kashmir 1947|1998|p=93}}

Caroe served as the Governor of the NWFP from 1946 to just before the [[Partition of India]] in 1947. Subject to accusations that he was too close to the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Facts are sacred |chapter=Chapter 18: Mountbatten Gets to Work |first=Khan Abdul |last=Wali Khan |publisher=Awami National Party |chapter-url=http://www.anp.org.pk/factsAreSacredchapter18.htm  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040718075021/http://www.anp.org.pk/factsAreSacredchapter18.htm |archive-date=18 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; he encountered opposition from [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]] politicians,&lt;ref&gt;Parshotam Mehra, [http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20011202/spectrum/book4.htm The force Badshah Khan built (review of ''The Pathan Unarmed: Opposition &amp; Memory in the North West Frontier'' by Mukulika Banerjee)],  Tribune India 2 December 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced in mid-1947 by [[Rob Lockhart]] as governor.

== Strategist ==
After returning from India in 1947, he wrote extensively. His strategic ideas proved influential:

{{cquote|At about this time there were those in Washington, looking for ways to secure the oil resources and practice containment in the middle east. The formulations of Sir Olaf Caroe attracted attention and soon found favour in official circles. His article in the March 1949 number of ''Round Table'' and his 1951 book, ''Wells of Power'', led to invitations from the state and defence departments to visit Washington.&lt;ref&gt;

He served as a [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionary]] for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in [[Brazil]] and graduated from [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) and the [[University of Utah]]; he also spent a year in a Ph.D. program at the [[University of Notre Dame]].

For part of the 1970s Card worked as an associate editor of the ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', an official magazine of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/ensign/1977/04/neighborliness-daines-style?lang=eng Ensign reference to Card as Associate Editor]&lt;/ref&gt; Influences on his fiction include [[Robert A.

Card lives in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]],&lt;ref name="About OSC"/&gt; a place that has played a significant role in ''[[Ender's Game]]'' and many of his other works.

==Fiction==
{{See also|List of works by Orson Scott Card}}
Card began his writing career primarily as a poet, studying with Clinton F. Larson at BYU. During his studies as a theater major, he began "doctoring" scripts, adapting fiction for readers theater production, and finally writing his own one-act and full-length plays, several of which were produced by faculty directors at BYU. He also explored fiction writing, beginning with stories that eventually evolved into ''[[The Worthing Saga]]''.

After returning to [[Provo, Utah]] from his [[Missionary (LDS Church)|Church of Jesus Christ mission]] in Brazil, Card started the Utah Valley Repertory Theatre Company, which for two summers produced plays at "the Castle", a [[Great Depression|Depression-era]] outdoor amphitheater behind the state psychiatric hospital in Provo; his company's were the first plays ever produced at the Castle. Meanwhile, he took part-time employment as a proofreader at [[BYU Press]], then made the jump to full-time employment as a copy editor. In 1976, in the midst of a paid role performing in the church's musical celebrating [[United States Bicentennial|America's Bicentennial]], he secured employment as an assistant editor at the ''Ensign'', and moved to [[Salt Lake City]]. It was while working at ''Ensign'' that Card published his first piece of fiction. His short story "[[Gert Fram]]" appeared in the July 1977 fine arts issue of that magazine under the pseudonym [[Pseudonyms used by Orson Scott Card#Byron Walley|Byron Walley]].

===Science fiction===
He wrote the short story "[[Ender's Game (short story)|Ender's Game]]" while working at the BYU press, and submitted it to several publications. The idea for the later novel of the same title came from the short story about a school where boys can fight in space. It was eventually purchased by [[Ben Bova]] at ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]]'' and published in the August 1977 issue. Meanwhile, he started writing half-hour audioplays on [[History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church history]], the [[New Testament]], and other subjects for [[Living Scriptures, Inc|Living Scriptures]] in Ogden, Utah; on the basis of that continuing contract, some freelance editing work, and a novel contract for ''[[Hot Sleep]]'' and ''[[A Planet Called Treason]]'', he left ''Ensign'' and began supporting his family as a freelancer.

He completed his [[master's degree]] in English at the University of Utah in 1981 and began a doctoral program at the University of Notre Dame, but the recession of the early 1980s caused the flow of new book contracts to temporarily dry up. He returned to full-time employment as the book editor for ''[[Compute!]]'' magazine in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1983. In October of that year, a new contract for the Alvin Maker "trilogy" (now up to six books) allowed him to return to freelancing.

''[[Ender's Game]]'' and its sequel ''[[Speaker for the Dead]]'' were both awarded the [[Hugo Award]] and the [[Nebula Award]], making Card the only author ({{as of|2018|lc=y}}) to win both of science fiction's top prizes in consecutive years. Card continued the series with ''[[Xenocide]]'', ''[[Children of the Mind]]'', ''[[Ender's Shadow]]'', ''[[Shadow of the Hegemon]]'', ''[[Shadow Puppets]]'', "[[First Meetings in the Enderverse]]", ''[[Shadow of the Giant]]'', ''[[A War of Gifts: An Ender Story|A War of Gifts]]'', and ''[[Ender in Exile]]'', a book that takes place after ''Ender's Game'' and before ''Speaker for the Dead''. Card has also announced his plan to write ''[[Shadows Alive]]'', a book that connects the "Shadow" series and "Speaker" series together. ''[[Shadows in Flight]]'' serves as a bridge towards this final book. He also co-wrote the formic war novels: [[Earth Unaware]], [[Earth Afire]], [[Earth Awakens]] and [[The Swarm (Card and Johnston novel)|The Swarm]] as prequels to the Ender novels, with two more novels in the pipeline, which will result in two prequel formic war trilogies. These trilogies relay, among other things, the history of Mazer Rackham. [[Children of the Fleet]] is the first novel in a new sequel series, called ''Fleet School''. In 2008 Card announced that ''Ender's Game'' would be made into a movie, but that he did not have a director lined up ([[Wolfgang Petersen]] had previously been scheduled to direct the movie but subsequently moved on to other projects.) It was to be produced by Chartoff Productions, and Card was writing the screenplay himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://endersgamemovie.blogspot.com/2008/04/enders-game-movie-searching-for-new.html|title=Ender's Game Movie Searching for New Director|access-date=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was made several years later, and released in 2013, with [[Asa Butterfield]] in the title role and [[Gavin Hood]] directing.

Other works include the alternative histories ''[[The Tales of Alvin Maker]]'', ''[[Pastwatch: The Redemption of Christopher Columbus]]'', [[Homecoming Saga|The Homecoming Saga]], and ''[[Hidden Empire]]'', a story about a near-future [[civil war]] in the United States, based on the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] video game ''[[Shadow Complex]]''. He collaborated with ''Star Wars'' artist [[Doug Chiang]] on ''[[Robota]]'' and with [[Kathryn H. Kidd]] on ''[[Lovelock (novel)|Lovelock]]''.

In 2017, he co-created a TV series ''[[Extinct (2017 TV series)|Extinct]]''.

===Other genres===
He has since branched out into other areas of fiction with novels such as ''[[Lost Boys (novel)|Lost Boys]]'', ''[[Treasure Box]]'' and ''[[Enchantment (novel)|Enchantment]]''. Other works include the novelization of the [[James Cameron]] film ''[[The Abyss]]'', and the comic book ''[[Ultimate Iron Man]]'' for Marvel Comics' Ultimate Marvel Universe series. Outside the world of published fiction, Card contributed dialog to at least three video games: ''[[Loom (video game)|Loom]]'', ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island]]'' and ''[[The Dig]]'' in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.filefront.com/gaming-todays-exclusive-interview-with-author-orson-scott-card/|title=Interview with Author Orson Scott Card|access-date=2007-06-18|publisher=Gaming Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 Card published the novel ''[[Saints (novel)|Saints]]'', a historical fiction based loosely on one of his ancestors and her experiences coming into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints during the early portion of its movement. It continues through her eyes into subsequent events up until the granting of Statehood to Utah.

In 1988, Card wrote the script for an updated [[Hill Cumorah Pageant]].&lt;ref name=maxwelli&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gates |first1=Crawford|title=The Delights of Making Cumorah's Music |url=http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/pdf.php?filename=OTk5Njc3NDEzLTEzLTEucGRm&amp;type=amJtcw== |website=Maxwell Institute |publisher=Journal of Book of Mormon Studies |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407090052/http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/pdf.php?filename=OTk5Njc3NDEzLTEzLTEucGRm&amp;type=amJtcw== |archivedate=7 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Card published the first novel in [[The Women of Genesis series|''The Women of Genesis'' series]]. This series explores the lives of the principal women mentioned in the first book of the Bible and includes ''[[Sarah (Women of Genesis series)|Sarah]]'' (2000), ''[[Rebekah (Women of Genesis series)|Rebekah]]'' (2002), and ''[[Rachel and Leah (Women of Genesis series)|Rachel and Leah]]'' (2004).

In the fall of 2005, Card launched ''Orson Scott Card's [[InterGalactic Medicine Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscigms.com|title=Orson Scott Card's Intergalactic Medicine Show|access-date=2006-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He edited the first two issues, but found that the demands of teaching, writing, and directing plays for his local church theater group made it impossible to respond to writers' submissions in a timely manner; former Card student and experienced freelance writer and editor [[Edmund R. Schubert]] took over as editor on June 1, 2006.

The dialog and screenplay (but not the story) for the Xbox video game ''[[Advent Rising]]'' was written by Card and Cameron Dayton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hatrack.com/ubb/main/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=003303;p=1#000001 Card's comments on working on ''Advent Rising''] from his official website&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Card's novella ''[[Hamlet's Father]]'', a retelling of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'', was published in the anthology ''The Ghost Quartet'' ([[Tor Books]]). The work re-interpreted all of the characters' personalities and motivations.

===Pseudonyms===
Over the years Orson Scott Card has used at least seven [[pseudonym]]s.

He used the names Frederick Bliss and P.Q. Gump when he was asked to write an overview of Mormon playwrights "Mormon Shakespeares: A Study of Contemporary Mormon Theatre" for Spring 1976 issue of ''[[Sunstone Magazine|Sunstone]]'' magazine. According to Card he used these pseudonyms because the article included a brief reference to himself and his play "Stone Tables".&lt;ref name="OSC Answers Questions1"&gt;[http://www.hatrack.com/research/questions/q0081.shtml Pseudonyms] "Orson Scott Card's website The Hatrack".&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Byron Walley was used by Card on his first published piece of fiction "Gert Fram" which appeared in the July 1977 fine arts issue of ''Ensign'' magazine. According to Card he used this name because he had a non-fiction article, "Family Art", a poem, "Looking West", and a short play, "The Rag Mission", appearing in the same issue.&lt;ref name="OSC Answers Questions1"/&gt; Card also used the name Byron Walley in stories he published in ''[[The Friend (LDS magazine)|Friend]]'' magazine, ''[[New Era (magazine)|New Era]]'' magazine and in the anthology ''[[Dragons of Darkness]]''. Stories by Byron Walley include: "[[Gert Fram]]", ''Ensign'' magazine, July 1977; "[[Bicicleta (short story)|Bicicleta]]", ''Friend'' magazine, October 1977; "[[The Best Family Home Evening Ever]]", ''Friend'' magazine, January 1978; "[[Billy's Box]]", ''Friend'' magazine, February 1978; "[[I Think Mom and Dad Are Going Crazy, Jerry]]", ''New Era'' magazine, May 1979; and "[[Middle Woman]]", ''Dragons of Darkness'', Ace Books, 1982.

He used the name Brian Green in the July 1977 fine arts issue of ''Ensign'' magazine. He used this name for his short play "The Rag Mission" because he had three other pieces appearing in the same issue.&lt;ref name="OSC Answers Questions1"/&gt; The name Dinah Kirkham was used to write the short story "[[The Best Day (short story)|The Best Day]]", in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/c/orson-scott-card/ Card bio] from FantasticFiction.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; The name '''[[wikt:nom de plume|Noam D. Pellume]]''' was used by Card for his short story "[[Damn Fine Novel]]" which appeared in the October 1989 issue of ''The Green Pages''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = | first1 =| title = The Locus Index to Science Fiction: 1984–1998| publisher = Locus Online| date = | year = | url = http://www.locusmag.com/index/s122.htm| access-date=28 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Card wrote the novel ''Zanna's Gift'' (2004) under the pen name Scott Richards, saying, "I was trying to establish a separate identity in the marketplace, but for various reasons the marketing strategy didn't work as we'd hoped."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Card | first1 = Orson Scott| title = Uncle Orson Reviews Everything: Bean on Baseball and Parker's Trilogies| publisher = Hatrack River Enterprises Inc| date=2 November 2008| url = http://www.hatrack.com/osc/reviews/everything/2008-11-02.shtml | access-date=28 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On writing==

===Teaching===

In 2005, Card accepted a permanent appointment as "distinguished professor" at [[Southern Virginia University]] in [[Buena Vista, Virginia]], a small [[liberal arts college]] run according to the principles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Card has cited his frustration with the dismal teaching methodology for [[creative writing]] in most universities as a reason for accepting this position, along with his desire to teach the techniques of effective fiction writing to writers whose values are more congruent with his own.&lt;ref name="SVU" /&gt; Card has worked closely with colleagues to develop ways to educate aspiring writers and has published two books on the subject. He was eager for the opportunity to apply these techniques in a university environment—his assorted workshops did not allow the follow-through he desired. After being deeply moved by stories of his students' parents in some of their essays, he decided to stop teaching regularly at the university to spend time with his youngest child who still lives at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hatrack.com/osc/reviews/everything/2007-05-27.shtml|date=2007-05-27|title=Uncle Orson Reviews Everything: Politically Incorrect Literature, Audio Drama, "My American Culture"|publisher=Hatrack River Enterprises Inc|access-date=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=January 2015}} Card returned to teaching for the spring semester of 2009.

Card has taught multiple courses in English and creative writing including courses analyzing the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[C.S. Lewis]], hymn and lyric writing, and [[LDS fiction]].

===Books on writing===
Card has written two books on the subject of creative writing – ''Characters and Viewpoint'', published in 1988, and ''How to Write Science Fiction and Fantasy'', published in 1990. He was also a co-writer for ''How to Write a Million'' (though his contribution is actually a reprint of an earlier work).

Card also offered advice about writing in an interview in [[Leading Edge (fiction magazine)|''Leading Edge'']] #23 in 1991.

===Writers of the Future===
Card serves as a judge in [[Writers of the Future]],&lt;ref name="WritersofFuture" /&gt; a [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] story contest for amateur writers. It originated in the early 1980s by [[L. Ron Hubbard]], a science fiction writer and the founder of [[the Church of Scientology]], and continues to be funded and organized by [[Author Services Inc.]], an entity that manages Hubbard's literary work.

===Children's books===

Card won the ALA Margaret Edwards Award in 2008 for his contribution in writing for teens, selected by a panel of [[YALSA|YA librarians]].&lt;ref name=edwards/&gt; "What have I done that made some wonderfully deluded people think that I should get the [award] for lifetime achievement in writing young adult fiction?" he asked in his address, and asserted that "There is no such thing as children's literature." Furthermore:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/yalsa/booklistsawards/bookawards/margaretaedwards/maeprevious/anniversary "Looking Back"]. YALSA. ALA. Retrieved 2013-10-13. Card won the 20th anniversary Edwards Award in 2008, when YALSA asked previous winners to reflect on the experience. Some live remarks by Card are published online with the compiled reflections but transcripts of acceptance speeches are available to members only.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have not worked with YA editors; my work has never been marketed that way until [[Tor Books|Tor]] put a YA cover and a new ISBN on ''Ender's Game''—fifteen years after the book first came out, and long after it had become popular with young readers. ''Ender's Game'' was written with no concessions to young readers. My protagonists were children, but the book was definitely not aimed at kids. I was perfectly aware that the rule of thumb for children's literature is that the protagonist must be a couple of years older than the target audience. You want ten-year-old readers, you have a twelve-year-old hero.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;At the beginning of the book, Ender is six. Who, exactly, is the target audience?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Poetry===

Card created a website, Strong Verse that publishes poetry from authors living and dead with the aim of showcasing works that present a clear message in clear language. The following motto appears on the website's header: "Good poetry is meant to be understood, not decoded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Orson Scott Card Network|title=About Strong Verse|url=http://www.strongverse.org/about.html|website=Strong Verse|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion==
Since 2001, Card's commentary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin |first=Tim |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10401422/Enders-Game-will-the-film-be-derailed-by-the-authors-homophobia.html |title=Ender's Game: will the film be derailed by the author's homophobia? |publisher=Telegraph |date=2013-10-24 |access-date=2013-11-05 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes the political columns "War Watch", "World Watch", or "Civilization Watch" (depending on Card's topic) and the column "Uncle Orson Reviews Everything", all published at the Greensboro ''[[Rhinoceros Times]]''. The last-named column features personal reviews of movies, books, and restaurants in the greater Greensboro area, in addition to a variety of other topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/books/review/inside-the-list.html?_r=3 | title = TBR Inside the List: Uncle Orson | first = G |last = Cowles | work = [[The New York Times]] |date=27 January 2012| access-date = 14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The column also later appears on his website, Hatrack River. Since 2008 Card has written a column for the ''[[Mormon Times]]''.

===Politics===
Card's vocal opposition to [[same-sex marriage]] and other views on homosexuality led to a boycott of the film version of ''Ender's Game''&lt;ref name="cieply"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/13/business/media/authors-anti-gay-views-fuel-call-for-boycott-of-enders-game.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|publisher = [[New York Times]]|title = Author's Views on Gay Marriage Fuel Call for Boycott|authorlink = Michael Cieply|first = Michael|last = Cieply|date =12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; a development which itself received criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/opinion/sunday/the-enders-game-boycott.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|publisher = New York Times|title = The 'Ender's Game' Boycott|first = Juliet|last = Lapidos|date =20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to political developments, by the early 2010s Card believed the question of U.S. legalization of same-sex marriage moot.&lt;ref name="inside_movies"/&gt;

But on economic matters, I'm a committed communitarian. I regard the Soviet Union as simply state monopoly capitalism. It was run the way the United States would be if Microsoft owned everything. Real communism has never been tried! I would like to see government controls expanded, laws that allow capitalism to not reward the most rapacious, exploitative behavior. I believe government has a strong role to protect us from capitalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2000/02/03/card/|publisher = [[Salon.com|Salon]]|date=February 3, 2000|title=My favorite author, my worst interview: I worshipped militaristic Mormon science-fiction writer Orson Scott Card -- until we met.|first = Donna|last = Minkowitz|authorlink=Donna Minkowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an August 2013 essay, presented as an "experiment" in fiction-writing called "The Game of Unlikely Events",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ornery.org/essays/warwatch/2013-05-09-1.html|publisher = [[Ornery.org|The Ornery American]]|title = Unlikely Events|date = May 9, 2013|author = Orson Scott Card|access-date=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Card described an [[alternative future]] in which President [[Barack Obama]] ruled as a "[[Hitler]]- or [[Stalin]]-style dictator" with his own national police force of young unemployed men; Obama and his wife [[Michelle Obama|Michelle]] would have amended the U.S. Constitution to allow presidents to remain in power for life, as in [[Nigeria]], [[Zimbabwe]], and [[Hitler's Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Child|first=Ben|title=Ender's Game author Orson Scott Card compares Obama to Hitler|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/16/ender-s-game-orson-scott-card-essay-obama-hitler|newspaper=The Guardian|date=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Horn|first=John|title='Ender's Game' author compares Obama to Hitler|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-enders-game-orson-card-obama-hitler-20130815,0,7348229.story|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Card's essay drew extensive criticism, especially for allusions to Obama's race with its reference to "urban gangs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.patheos.com/blogs/unreasonablefaith/2013/08/orson-scott-cards-alternate-future/|publisher = [[Patheos.com|Patheos]]|title = Orson Scott Card's Alternate Future|date = August 16, 2013|author = Daniel Florien}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[The American Prospect]]|title = Morally Compromised Art, on the Big Screen: How do we judge a movie made from a book written by someone with repellent political views?|author = Paul Waldman|date = August 16, 2013|url = http://prospect.org/article/morally-compromised-art-big-screen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.journalnow.com/news/state_region/controversial-author-orson-scott-card-named-to-unc-tv-board/article_3104bc04-199d-11e3-9679-0019bb30f31a.html|date = September 9, 2013|title = Controversial author Orson Scott Card named to UNC-TV board|agency = [[Associated Press]]|newspaper = [[Winston-Salem Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Views about homosexuality====
Card has publicly declared his opposition to [[homosexuality]] and [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NYC-based group calls for boycott of sci-fi movie over author's gay rights views|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/07/09/nyc-based-group-calls-for-boycott-of-sci-fi-movie-over-authors-gay-rights-views/|publisher=CBS New York|date=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1990 essay he wrote that "[[Sodomy laws in the United States|laws against homosexual behavior]] should remain on the books, not to be indiscriminately enforced", but to "send a clear message that those who flagrantly violate society's regulation of sexual behavior cannot be permitted to remain as acceptable, equal citizens within that society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Card|first1=Orson Scott|title=A Changed Man: The Hypocrites of Homosexuality|journal=Sunstone Magazine|date=Feb 1990|pages=44–45|url=https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/075-43-45.pdf|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same essay, Card clarified his position, writing:
{{Quote |text=
The goal of the polity is not to put homosexuals in jail. The goal is to discourage people from engaging in homosexual practices in the first place, and, when they nevertheless proceed in their homosexual behavior, to encourage them to do so discreetly, so as not shake the confidence of the community in polity's ability to provide rules for safe, dependable marriage and family relationships.
}}
In May 2013 Card further wrote that since the US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] had [[Lawrence v. Texas|ruled]] those laws unconstitutional in 2003, he has "no interest in criminalizing homosexual acts".&lt;ref name="Nauvoo"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Hypocrites of Homosexuality | url=http://www.nauvoo.com/library/card-hypocrites.html| access-date = 15 Sep 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to public criticism of the 1990 essay, Card noted:
{{Quote |text=
Oddly enough, even as I am attacked by some as a homophobe, I am attacked by others as being too supportive of homosexuality, simply because I cannot see individual homosexuals, in or out of my books, as anything other than human beings with as complex a combination of good and evil in them as I find within myself.

In a 2008 opinion piece in the ''[[Deseret News]]'' he wrote that "no matter how close the bonds of affection and friendship might be within [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex couples]], there is no act of court or Congress that can make these relationships the same as the coupling between a man and a woman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Card|first1=Orson Scott|title=Orson Scott Card: State job is not to redefine marriage|journal=The Deseret News|date=24 July 2008|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700245157/State-job-is-not-to-redefine-marriage.html?pg=all|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 he joined the board of directors of the [[National Organization for Marriage]], a group that campaigns against [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]],&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt; but later resigned from the board in mid-2013.&lt;ref name="cieply"/&gt; Card has stated that there is no need to legalize gay marriage.&lt;ref name="ornery.org"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Card|first1=Orson Scott|title=Homosexual "Marriage" and Civilization|url=http://www.ornery.org/essays/warwatch/2004-02-15-1.html|website=The Ornery American|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Card has also expressed his opinion that [[paraphilia]] and homosexuality are linked. In 2004, he claimed that it is a "myth that homosexuals are '[[Biology and sexual orientation|born that way]]{{'"}}, noting that "if there is a genetic component to homosexuality, an entire range of environmental influences are also involved." He continued, saying that "the dark secret of homosexual society" was how often people "entered into that world through disturbing seduction or rape or molestation or abuse".&lt;ref name="cieply"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ornery.org"/&gt;

In Card's 2008 novella ''Hamlet's Father'', which re-imagines the backstory of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] play ''[[Hamlet]]'', Card was accused of directly trying to link the king's [[pedophilia]] with homosexuality. The novella prompted public outcry and its publishers were inundated with complaints.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/08/outcry-hamlet-novel-gay-paedophile Flood, Alison.

Hamlet's father, in the book, is a pedophile, period. I don't show him being even slightly attracted to adults of either sex. It is the reviewer, not me, who has asserted this link, which I would not and did not make."&lt;ref name="hatrack.com"/&gt;

In 2013, Card was selected as a guest author for [[DC Comics]]'s new ''[[Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' comic book series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/comics-and-graphic-novels/2013/02/12/dc-comics-responds-backlash-over-hiring|title=DC Comics Responds to Backlash Over Hiring Antigay Writer|author=Jase Peeples|date=February 12, 2013|publisher=''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''|access-date=February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but controversy over Card's views on homosexuality led illustrator [[Chris Sprouse]] to leave the project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Artist leaves Orson Scott Card's Superman comic |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2013/03/05/chris-sprouse-orson-scott-card-superman-comic/1964845/?t=dXNlcmlkPTE5MzIxMTM0LGVtYWlsaWQ9MjEzNTQ= |first=Brian |last=Truitt |work=[[USA Today]] |date=March 5, 2013 |access-date=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and DC Comics to put Card's story on hold indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/03/orson-scott-card-superman-comic/ |title=Orson Scott Card's Controversial Superman Story Put on Hold |work=[[Wired.com]] |first1=Graeme |last1=McMillan |date=March 5, 2013 |access-date=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later an LGBT group, Geeks OUT!, proposed a boycott of the [[Ender's Game (film)|movie adaptation of ''Ender's Game'']] calling Card's view anti-gay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/09/enders-game-boycott-card-anti-gay-views |title=Activists call for Ender's Game boycott over author's anti-gay views|date=July 9, 2013 |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |first=Ben |last=Child}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Orson Scott Card's antigay views prompt 'Ender's Game' boycott|url=http://www.latimes.com/features/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-orson-scott-card-antigay-enders-game-boycott-20130711,0,2444377.story|access-date=20 Jul 2013|date=11 Jul 2013|work=Los Angeles Times|first=Carolyn|last=Kellogg}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing the movie studio [[Lionsgate]] to publicly distance itself from Card's opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheney|first=Alexandra|title=Studio comes out against 'Ender's Game' author on gay rights|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/07/12/lions-gate-comes-out-against-enders-game-author-on-gay-rights/|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, one week after the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] issued rulings in two cases that were widely interpreted as favoring recognition of same-sex marriages, Card wrote in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that the gay marriage issue is moot due to the Supreme Court's decision on [[DOMA]].&lt;ref name="inside_movies"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee |first=Stephan |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/07/08/enders-game-orson-scott-card-statement/ |title='Ender's Game' author answers critics: Gay marriage issue is 'moot' &amp;#124; Inside Movies &amp;#124; EW.com |publisher=Insidemovies.ew.com |date=2013-07-08 |access-date=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He further stated, "now it will be interesting to see whether the victorious proponents of gay marriage will show tolerance toward those who disagreed with them when the issue was still in dispute".&lt;ref name="inside_movies"/&gt;

===Religion===
Card's membership in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has been an important facet of his life from early on. He is a great-great-grandson of [[Brigham Young]], the second Latter-day Saint prophet, and all of Card's ancestors for at least three generations have been members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. His ancestors include several other figures notable in the Church, including the [[Cardston, Alberta|Cardston]] colony founder [[Charles Ora Card]]. As such, his faith has been a source of inspiration and influence for both his writing and his personal views.&lt;ref name=Willett/&gt; Since 2008 Card has written a column of Latter-day Saint devotional and cultural commentary for the Sunday national edition of the ''[[Deseret News]]'' (formerly "the ''[[Mormon Times]]''").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.deseretnews.com/article/695242930/Mormon-Times-New-section-every-Thursday-to-bring-more-LDS-news-info.html?pg=all|publisher = [[Deseret News]]|title = The Gospel in Words: Mormon Times: New section every Thursday to bring more LDS news, info|first = Joseph A.|last = Cannon|authorlink = Joseph A. Cannon|date = January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Card has served as a [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] of his ward and has held various other church callings.

==Personal life==
[[File:Scott Card.jpg|thumb|Card (right) signing autographs at [[New York Comic Con]] in 2008]]
Card and his wife, Kristine, have had five children, each named after one or more authors he and his wife admire. Their children's names are Michael Geoffrey ([[Geoffrey Chaucer]]), Emily Janice ([[Emily Brontë]] and [[Emily Dickinson]]), Charles Benjamin ([[Charles Dickens]]), Zina Margaret ([[Margaret Mitchell]]) and Erin Louisa ([[Louisa May Alcott]]). Charles, who had [[cerebral palsy]], died shortly after his 17th birthday and their daughter Erin died the day she was born.&lt;ref name="About OSC" /&gt; Card and his wife live with their youngest child, Zina, in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="About OSC" /&gt;

The life of their son, Charles, influenced some of Card's fiction, most notably the ''[[Homecoming Saga|Homecoming]]'' series, ''Lost Boys'' and ''Folk of the Fringe''. Their daughter, Emily, along with two other writers, adapted Card's short stories "[[Clap Hands and Sing]]", "[[Lifeloop]]" and "[[A Sepulchre of Songs]]" for the stage in ''[[Posing as People]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hatrack.com/store/store.cgi?loc=us&amp;item=BOOKS_PosingAsPeople&amp;opt=|title=Posing as People|publisher=Hatrack River Enterprises Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he appeared in the short film ''The Delivery'', which starred his daughter, Emily. He plays an author reading an audiobook in this film, which won First Place in Fantasy at Dragon*Con Film Festival. He wrote an original story, "The Emperor of the Air", specifically for the short film by Gabrielle de Cuir and Stefan Rudnicki.

Card is an avid fan of the [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' and makes an appearance in the documentary ''[[Done the Impossible]]'' about [[Browncoats|''Firefly'' fandom]]. He has also served on the boards of a number of organizations, including [[public television]] station [[UNC-TV]] (2013&amp;ndash;present)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=September 12, 2013 |url=http://www.news-record.com/blogs/north_state_politics/article_ee4a0514-196e-11e3-b6df-0019bb30f31a.html |title=Orson Scott Card named to UNC-TV board - News-Record.com: North State Politics |publisher=News-Record.com |date= |access-date=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Organization for Marriage]] (2009–2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/opinion/sunday/the-enders-game-boycott.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Juliet | last=Lapidos | title=The 'Ender's Game' Boycott | date=2013-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Card suffered a mild [[stroke]] on January 1, 2011, and was briefly hospitalized. He reported expecting to make a full recovery despite impairment of his left hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Locus Publications |url=http://www.locusmag.com/News/2011/01/orson-scott-card-suffers-mild-stroke/ |title=Locus Online News » Orson Scott Card Suffers Mild Stroke |publisher=Locusmag.com |date=2011-01-05 |access-date=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Card|first=Orson Scott|title=Orson Scott Card: Talents, gifts and intelligence|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705387125/Talents-gifts-and-intelligence.html?pg=all|newspaper=Deseret News|date=February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

The ALA [[Margaret A. Edwards Award]] recognizes one writer and a particular body of work for "significant and lasting contributions to young adult literature". Card won the annual award in 2008, citing ''[[Ender's Game]]'' (1985), which inaugurated the science fiction Ender Saga, and ''[[Ender's Shadow]]'' (1999), the so-called parallel novel featuring another boy in the Battle School. According to the citation, the two boys' "experiences echo those of teens, beginning as children navigating in an adult world and growing into a state of greater awareness of themselves, their communities and the larger universe."&lt;ref name=edwards&gt;[http://www.ala.org/yalsa/booklistsawards/bookawards/margaretaedwards/maeprevious/08edwards "2008 Margaret A.

'''Pavel Jozef Šafárik''' ([[Slovak language|Slovak]]: Pavol Jozef Šafárik;13 May 1795 – 26 June 1861) was a [[Slovaks|Slovak]] [[philologist]], [[poet]], one of the first scientific [[Slavist]]s; [[literary historian]], historian and [[ethnographer]].

==Family==
His father Pavol Šafárik (1761–1831) was a [[Protestant]] clergyman in Kobeliarovo (Kisfeketepatak) and before that a teacher in [[Štítnik]] (Csetnek), where he was also born. His mother, Katarína Káresová (1764–1812) was born in a poor lower gentry family in [[Hanková]] (Annafalva) and had several jobs in order to help the family in the poor region of Kobeliarovo.

P.J. Šafárik had two elder brothers and one elder sister. One brother, Pavol Jozef as well, died before Šafárik was born. In 1813, after Katarína's death, Šafárik's father married the widow Rozália Drábová, although Šafárik and his brothers and sister were against this marriage. The local teacher provided Šafárik with Czech books.

On the 17 of June 1822, when he was in [[Serbia]] (see below), P. J. Šafárik married 19-year-old Júlia Ambrózy de Séden ({{lang-sk|Júlia Ambróziová}}; 1803–1876), a highly intelligent member of lower gentry born in 1803 in present-day Serbia.{{sfn|Hanus|1895}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.snk.sk/swift_data/source/NbiU/Biograficke%20studie/23/bs23_133_149.pdf|title=Príspevok ku genealógii Pavla Jozefa Šafárika|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129031239/http://www.snk.sk/swift_data/source/NbiU/Biograficke%20studie/23/bs23_133_149.pdf|archivedate=29 November 2014|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://mek.oszk.hu/06700/06758/pdf/revai01_2.pdf|title=Révai lexicon No. 1:2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She spoke [[Slovak language|Slovak]], Czech, [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]], and supported Šafárik in his scientific work. In Serbia, they also had three daughters (Ľudmila, Milena, Božena) and two sons (Mladen Svatopluk, Vojtěch), but the first two daughters and the first son died shortly after their birth. Upon Šafárik's arrival in Prague, they had 6 further children, out of which one died shortly after its birth.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

His eldest son [[Vojtěch Šafařík|Vojtěch]] (1831–1902) became an important chemist, Jaroslav (1833–1862) became a military doctor and later the supreme assistant at the Joseph Academy in [[Vienna]], Vladislav (1841-?) became a professional soldier, and Božena (1831–?) married [[Josef Jireček]] (1825–1888), a Czech literary historian, politician and a tutor in Šafarík's family. Vojtech wrote an interesting biography of his father - ''Co vyprávěl P. J. Šafařík'' (What Šafárik said) - and the son of Božena and Jireček the study ''Šafařík mezi Jihoslovany'' (Šafárik among the [[Southern Slavs]]).

==Life==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}

===Upper Hungary (today's Slovakia) (1795–1815)===
Pavel spent his childhood in the region of Kobeliarovo in northern [[Gemer]] (Gömör) characterized by attractive nature and rich Slovak culture. He gained his basic education from his father. As P. J. Šafárik's son Vojtech put it later in his book (see Family): ''When, at the age of 7, his father showed him only one alphabet, he by himself hands down learned to read, and from then on he was always sitting on the stove and was reading. By the age of eight, he had read the whole Bible twice and one of his favorite activities was preaching to his brothers and sister, and to local people.''

In 1805–08 Šafárik studied at a "lower [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]" (in some sources described as [[Protestant]] school which was just changed into a middle [[Latin school]]) in [[Rožňava]] (Rozsnyó), where he learned [[Latin]], German and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. Since he did not have enough money to finance his studies, he continued his studies in [[Dobšiná]] (Dobsina) for two years, because he could live there with his sister.

At that time, it was absolutely necessary for anyone, who wanted to become a successful scientist in the Kingdom of Hungary (which included today's Slovakia) to have a good command of Latin, German, and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. Since the school in Rožňava specialized in Hungarian and the school in Dobšiná in German, and Šafárik was an excellent student and both schools had a good reputation, all prerequisites for a successful career were fulfilled as early as at the age of 15.

In 1810-1814 he studied at the Evangelical [[lyceum]] of [[Kežmarok]] (Késmárk), where he got to know many [[Poland|Polish]], [[Serbia]]n and [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] students and his most important friend Ján Blahoslav Benedikti, with whom they together read texts of Slovak and Czech national revivalists, especially those of [[Josef Jungmann]]. He was also familiarized with classical literature and German [[esthetics]] (also thanks to the excellent library of the lyceum), and started to show interest in [[Serbian culture]].

He graduated from the following branches of study: [[philosophy]] (including [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]], ''economia ruralis'', Latin style, comparative philosophy and history of the Kingdom of Hungary), politics and law (including ''jus naturae'', ''jus privatum civile et criminale'', ''scienciae politicae''), and [[theology]] (including dogmatic and moral theology, [[hermeneutics]], [[Greek language]], [[Hebrew language]], physics, medicine, [[natural law]], state law and [[international law]]). The studies at this school were very important; since this was a largely German school, he was able to get a (partial) scholarship for a university in [[Germany]].

He worked as a private tutor in the family of Dávid Goldberger in Kežmarok between 1812 and 1814, which he also did one year after the end of his studies in Kežmarok. His mother died in late 1812 and his father remarried 6 months later. His first larger work was a volume of poems entitled ''The Muse of [[Tatras]] with a Slavonic [[Lyre]]'' published in 1814 (see Works). The poems were written in the old-fashioned standard of the Moravian Protestant translation of the Bible that the Slovak Lutherans used in their publications with many elements from the Slovak and some from the Polish language.

===Germany (1815–1817)===
In 1815 he began to study at the [[University of Jena]], where he turned from a poet into a scientist. It was the wish of his father, who financed him, to study there.

He attended lectures in history, [[philology]], philosophy and [[natural sciences]] (lectures held by the professors Fries, [[Oken]], [[Luden]], [[Eichenstädt]]), studied books of [[Herder]] and [[Fichte]], was observing current literature and studied classical literature.  While there he translated into [[Czech language|Czech]] the ''[[The Clouds|Clouds]]'' of [[Aristophanes]] (issued in the Časopis Českého musea [Journal of the Bohemian museum] in 1830) and the ''Maria Stuart'' of [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] (issued in 1831).

In 1816, he became a member of the Latin Society of Jena. 17 of Šafárik's poems written at this time (1815–16) appeared in the ''Prvotiny pěkných umění'' by [[Hromádka]] in Vienna and made Šafárik well-known among the Slovaks and the [[Czech lands]]. In Jena, which Šafárik liked very much, he mainly learned to apply scientific methods and found a lot of new friends. One of them was the important Slovak writer [[Ján Chalupka]], and another one, Samuel Ferjenčík, introduced him to [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]]. Although he was an excellent student, Šafárik had to leave the University of Jena in May 1817 for unknown reasons (probably lack of money).

In 1817, on his way back home, he visited [[Leipzig]] and [[Prague]]. In Prague, where he was searching for a tutor job, he spent one month and joined the literary circle, whose members were [[Josef Dobrovsky]], Josef Jungmann and [[Vaclav Hanka]], whom Šafárik thus got to know in person.

===Upper Hungary (today's Slovakia) (1817–1819)===
Between the summer of 1817 and June 1819, he worked as a tutor in [[Bratislava|Pressburg (Bratislava)]] in the well-known family of [[Gašpar Kubínyi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.snk.sk/swift_data/source/NbiU/Biograficke%20studie/29/bs29_165_181.pdf|title=Biografické kalendárium P .

Šafárika|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903170333/http://www.snk.sk/swift_data/source/NbiU/Biograficke%20studie/29/bs29_165_181.pdf|archivedate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also became a good friend of the Czech [[František Palacký]], with whom he had already exchanged letters before and who was also a tutor in Pressburg at that time. The town of Pressburg was a social and intellectual center of the Kingdom of Hungary at that time. In the spring of 1819, Šafárik befriended the important Slovak writer and politician [[Ján Kollár]].

Before he left for Serbia, Šafárik spent some time in Kobeliarovo and with his grandfather in Hanková. This was the last time Šafárik saw his native country.

===Vojvodina (1819–1833)===
[[File:Pavel Jozef Šafárik portrait.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Šafárik done by the vojvodinian Slovak painter Karol Miloslav Lehotský]]
In April 1819, his friend [[Ján Blahoslav Benedikti]] helped him to get a [[doctor's degree]], which he needed in order to become headmaster of a new [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Novi Sad]] (Újvidék), in the south of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], where he befriended the teacher and writer [[Georgije Magarašević]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marcel Cornis-Pope|author2=John Neubauer|title=History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe: Junctures and disjunctures in the 19th and 20th centuries.

All other teachers at the gymnasium were Serbs, including novelist Milovan Vidaković, who taught there at the same time as Šafárik. He himself taught mathematics, physics, logic, [[rhetoric]], poetry, [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]] and classic literature in Latin, German, and when [[Magyarization]] (Hungarisation) by the authorities intensified, also in Hungarian. From 1821 onwards, he also worked as a tutor of the son of the nephew of Metropolitan [[Stefan Stratimirović]]. In 1824 he had to renounce the post of headmaster because the Austrian government prohibited the Serbian Orthodox Church from employing Protestants from the Kingdom of Hungary. This caused Šafárik, who had to finance his newly arisen family, to lose a substantial source of income. He therefore tried to find a teaching position in his native country, but for various reasons he did not succeed. In Novi Sad he studied [[Serbian literature]] and antiquities, and he acquired many rare - especially [[Old Church Slavonic]] - books and manuscripts, which he used in Prague later. He also published a collection of [[Slovak folk music|Slovak folk songs]] and sayings in collaboration with [[Ján Kollár]] and others (''see Works''). In 1826 his ''Geschichte der slawischen Sprache und Literatur nach allen Mundarten'' was published. This book was the first attempt to give anything like a systematic account of the [[Slavonic languages]] as a whole.

===Bohemia (1833–1861)===
In 1832 he finally decided to leave Novi Sad and tried to find a teacher or librarian job in [[Russian Empire|Russia]], but again without success. In 1833, with the help of Ján Kollár and on invitation of influential friends in Prague who promised to finance him, he went to Prague, where he spent the remainder of his life. During his entire stay in Prague, especially in the 1840s, his very existence depended on the 380 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]]s he received annually from his Czech friends under the condition which explicitly expressed František Palacký: "From now on, anything you write, you will write it in the Czech language only." Šafárik was an editor of the journal ''[[Světozor]]'' (1834–1835). In 1837 poverty compelled him to accept the uncongenial office of [[Censorship|censor]] of Czech publications, which he abandoned in 1847. Between 1838 and 1842 he was first editor, later conductor, of the journal ''Časopis Českého musea'', since 1841 he was a custodian of the [[Prague University]] Library. In Prague, he published most of his works, especially his greatest work ''Slovanské starožitnosti'' ("Slavonic Antiquities") in 1837. He also edited the first volume of the ''[[Výbor]]'' (selections from old Czech writers), which appeared under the auspices of the [[Prague literary society]] in 1845. To this he prefixed a grammar of the Old [[Czech language]] (''Počátkové staročeské mluvnice'').

In the papers collection ''Hlasowé o potřebě jednoty spisowného jazyka pro Čechy, Morawany a Slowáky'' ("Voices on the necessity of a united standard language for the Bohemians, Moravians and Slovaks") published by Ján Kollár in 1846, Šafárik moderately criticized [[Ľudovít Štúr]]'s introduction of a new [[History of the Slovak language|Slovak standard language]] (1843) that replaced the previously used Lutheran standard which was closer to the Czech language (the Slovak Catholics used a different standard). Šafárik – as opposed to most of his Czech colleagues – always considered the [[Slovaks]] a separate nation from the Czechs (e.g. explicitly in his works ''Geschichte der slawischen Sprache...'' and in ''Slovanský národopis'') but he advocated the use of Slovacized Czech ("Slovak style of the Czech language") as the only literary language among the Slovak people.

During the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Revolution of 1848]] he was mainly collecting material for books on the oldest Slavic history. In 1848 he was made head of the University Library of Prague and a masterful professor of Slavonic philology in the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]], but resigned to the latter in 1849 and remained head of the university library only. The reason for this resignation was that during the Revolution of 1848-49 he participated at the [[Prague Slavic Congress, 1848|Slavic Congress in Prague in June 1848]] and thus became suspicious for [[Austria]]n authorities. During the [[Political absolutism|absolutistic]] period following the defeat of the revolution, he lived a secluded life and studied especially older [[Czech literature]] and [[Old Church Slavonic]] texts and culture.

In 1856/57, as a result of persecution anxieties, overwork, and ill health, he became physically and mentally ill and burned most of his correspondence with important personalities (e.g. with Ján Kollár). In May 1860, his [[clinical depression|depression]]s made him jump into the [[Vltava]] river, but he was saved. This event produced considerable sensation among the general public. In early October 1860 he asked for retirement from his post as University Library head. The Austrian [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|emperor]] himself enabled him this in a letter written by his majesty himself and granted him a pension, which corresponded to Šafárik's previous full pay. Šafárik died in 1861 in Prague and was buried in the evangelical cemetery in [[Karlín]] Quarter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10791">A '''phonological rule''' is a formal way of expressing a systematic [[phonological]] or [[morphophonological]] process or [[Historical linguistics|diachronic]] [[sound change]] in [[language]].  Phonological rules are commonly used in generative [[phonology]] as a notation to capture sound-related operations and computations the human brain performs when [[Language production|producing]] or [[Language comprehension|comprehending]] spoken language.  They may use [[phonetic notation]] or [[distinctive features]] or both.

[[John Goldsmith (linguist)|John Goldsmith]] (1995) defines phonological rules as mappings between two different levels of sounds representation&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith 1995:2.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;in this case, the abstract or underlying level and the surface level&amp;mdash;and [[Bruce Hayes (linguist)|Bruce Hayes]] (2009) describes them as "generalizations" about the different ways a sound can be pronounced in different environments.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes 2009:26.&lt;/ref&gt;  That is to say, phonological rules describe how a speaker goes from the abstract representation stored in their brain, to the actual sound they articulate when they speak.  In general, phonological rules start with the ''[[underlying representation]]'' of a sound (the [[phoneme]] that is stored in the speaker's mind) and yield the final ''surface form'', or what the speaker actually pronounces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.udel.edu/idsardi/101/notes/phonology.html |title=LING 101: Phonology |last=Idsardi |first=William James |publisher=[[University of Delaware]] |accessdate=7 March 2009 |date=2 September 2003 |pages=A Rule of English |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305064715/http://www.ling.udel.edu/idsardi/101/notes/phonology.html |archivedate=March 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When an underlying form has multiple surface forms, this is often referred to as [[allophony]].  For example, the [[English plural]] ''-s'' may be pronounced as [[Voiceless alveolar fricative|[s]]] (in "cat'''s'''"), [[Voiced alveolar fricative|[z]]] (in "cab'''s'''"), or as [əz] (in "bus'''es'''"); these forms are all theorized to be stored mentally as the same ''-s'', but the surface pronunciations are derived through a phonological rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.udel.edu/idsardi/101/notes/phonology.html |title=LING 101: Phonology |last=Idsardi |first=William James |publisher=[[University of Delaware]] |accessdate=7 March 2009 |date=2 September 2003 |pages=The pronunciation of the English plural |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305064715/http://www.ling.udel.edu/idsardi/101/notes/phonology.html |archivedate=March 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
In most [[dialect]]s of [[American English]], speakers have a process known as [[intervocalic alveolar flapping]] that changes the consonants [[Voiceless alveolar plosive|/t/]] and [[Voiced alveolar plosive|/d/]] into a quick [[flap consonant]] ([[Alveolar tap|[ɾ]]] in words such as "bu'''tt'''er" ({{IPA|[ˈbʌɾɹ]}}) and "no'''t'''able" ({{IPA|[ˈnoʊɾəbl]}}).&lt;ref group=note&gt;See [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] for information about how to read these transcriptions.&lt;/ref&gt; The stop consonants /t/ and /d/ only become a flap in between two [[vowel]]s, where the first vowel is [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] and the second is [[Stress (linguistics)|stressless]].  It is common to represent phonological rules using formal [[rewrite rule]]s in the most general way possible. Thus, the intervocalic alveolar flapping described above can be formalized as

[[File:AmerEngFlappingRule.PNG|center]]

==Format and notation==
The rule given above for intervocalic alveolar flapping describes what sound is changed, what the sound changes to, and where the change happens (in other words, what the ''environment'' is that triggers the change).  The illustration below presents the same rule, with each of its parts labelled and described.

#Title of the rule
#The underlying sound that is changed.  In this example, the brackets represent all the features the changed sounds have in common; /t/ and /d/ are both [[stop consonant]]s and both articulated with the tongue touching the [[alveolar ridge]].  Therefore, this rule applies to all sounds that share those features (in English, only /t/ and /d/).  Rules can be written with just the individual sound to be changed, but using square bracket notation allows the rule to apply to a class of related sounds.&lt;ref name=Hayes28/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;See [[Place of articulation]] and [[Manner of articulation]] for a description of these terms.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The arrow represents that the sound on the left changes to have the features on the right.
#The sound that /t/ and /d/ (in this example) change to, or the individual features that change.
#The slash is a shorthand notation for "in the environment where...".&lt;ref name=Hayes28&gt;Hayes 2009:28&lt;/ref&gt;  It means that the notation to the right describes where the phonological rule is applied.
#The sound, or the features of the sound, that precedes the one to be changed.  In this example, the /t/ or /d/ that becomes flapped must be preceded by a stressed vowel.
#The location of the sound that is going to be changed.  In this example, the underline means that the /t/ or /d/ that becomes flapped must be in between two vowels (where the first is stressed and the second is not).
#The sound, or the features of the sound, that follows the one to be changed.  In this example, the /t/ or /d/ that becomes flapped must be followed by an unstressed vowel.
#A prose description of the rule, specifying when it applies and what it changes.

Taken together and read from left to right, this notation of the rule for intervocalic alveolar flapping states that any alveolar stop consonant (/t/ or /d/) becomes a tap ([ɾ]) in the environment where it is preceded by a stressed vowel and followed by an unstressed one.

Phonological rules are often written using [[distinctive feature]]s, which are (supposedly&lt;ref group=note&gt;Some phonologists have questioned the "naturalness" or "innateness" of distinctive features.  See, for example, {{cite journal | year=2005 | journal=Phonology | title=Ambivalence and ambiguity in laterals and nasals | last=Mielke | first=Jeff | volume=22 | page=193 | doi=10.1017/S0952675705000539 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;) natural characteristics that describe the [[Acoustics|acoustic]] and [[Articulatory phonetics|articulatory]] makeup of a sound; by selecting a particular bundle, or "matrix," of features, it is possible to represent a group of sounds that form a [[natural class]] and pattern together in phonological rules.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes 2009:71.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in the rule above, rather than writing /t/ and /d/ separately, phonologists may write the features that they have in common, thus capturing the whole set of sounds that are stop consonants and are pronounced by placing the tongue against the alveolar ridge.  In the most commonly used feature system, the features to represent these sounds would be [+delayed release, +anterior, -distributed], which describe the [[manner of articulation]] and the position and shape of the tongue when pronouncing these two sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes 2009:79; 84&amp;ndash;85.&lt;/ref&gt;  But rules are not always written using features; in some cases, especially when the rule applies only to a single sound, rules are written using the symbols of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayes 2009:92.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Hayes (2009) lists the following characteristics that all phonological rules have in common:&lt;ref&gt;Hayes 2009:26&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Language specificity''': A phonological rule that is present in one [[language]] may not be present in other languages, or even in all dialects of a given language.
*'''Productivity''': Phonological rules apply even to new words.  For example, if an English speaker is asked to pronounce the plural of the [[nonsense word]] "wug" (i.e. "wugs"), they pronounce the final ''s'' as [z], not [s], even though they have never used the word before. (This kind of test is called the [[wug test]].)
*'''Untaught and unconscious''': Speakers apply these rules without being aware of it, and they acquire the rules early in life without any explicit teaching.
*'''Intuitive''': The rules give speakers intuitions about what words are "well-formed" or "acceptable"; if a speaker hears a word that does not conform to the language's phonological rules, the word will sound foreign or ill-formed.

==Types==
{{Sound change}}
Phonological rules can be roughly divided into four types:&lt;ref name=Schramm&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=7 March 2009 | date=17 March 2001 | url=http://www.hamline.edu/personal/aschramm/linguistics2001/9phonrlz.html | title=Lesson 9.2: Phonological Rules | first=Andreas | last=Schramm | publisher=[[Hamline University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Assimilation (linguistics)|Assimilation]]''': When a sound changes one of its features to be more similar to an adjacent sound.  This is the kind of rule that occurs in the English plural rule described above&amp;mdash;the ''-s'' becomes [[Voicing (phonetics)|voiced]] or [[Voicing (phonetics)|voiceless]] depending on whether or not the preceding consonant is voiced.
*'''[[Dissimilation]]''': When a sound changes one of its features to become ''less'' similar to an adjacent sound, usually to make the two sounds more distinguishable.  This type of rule is often seen among people speaking a language that is not their [[native language]], where the sound contrasts may be difficult.&lt;ref name=Schramm/&gt;
*'''[[epenthesis|Insertion]]''': When an extra sound is added between two others.  This also occurs in the English plural rule: when the plural [[morpheme]] [[z]] is added to "bus," "bus-z" would be unpronounceable, so a short vowel (the [[schwa]], [ə]) is inserted between [s] and the [z].
*'''[[elision|Deletion]]''': When a sound, such as a stressless syllable or a weak consonant, is not pronounced; for example, most American English speakers do not pronounce the [d] in "handbag".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5604">In [[United States constitutional law]], '''police power''' is the capacity of the [[U.S. state|states]] to [[Regulation|regulate]] behavior and enforce order within their territory for the betterment of the [[health]], [[safety]], [[Morality|morals]], and [[Common good|general welfare]] of their inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title =Police Power| encyclopedia =Encyclopædia Britannica|url =http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9060615/police-power| accessdate = 2007-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], the powers not delegated to the Federal Government are reserved to the states or to the people. This implies that the Federal Government does not possess all possible powers, because most of these are reserved to the State governments, and others are reserved to the people.

Police power is exercised by the legislative and executive branches of the various states through the enactment and [[law enforcement|enforcement of law]]s. States have the power to compel [[obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] to these laws through whatever measures they see fit, provided these measures do not infringe upon any of the rights protected by the [[United States Constitution]] or in the various state constitutions, and are not unreasonably arbitrary or oppressive. Methods of enforcement can include [[Sanctions (law)|legal sanctions]], [[violence#Law|physical means]], and other forms of [[coercion]] and inducement. Controversies over the exercise of state police power can arise when exercise by state authorities conflicts with individual rights and freedoms.

== Origins ==

The authority for use of police power under American Constitutional law has its roots in [[English law#Common law|English]] and European common law traditions.&lt;ref name=Pox&gt;{{cite book|last=Willrich|first=Michael|title=Pox|date=2012|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-0-14-312078-0|page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even more fundamentally, use of police power draws on two (Latin) principles, ''[[sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas]]'' ("use that which is yours so as not to injure others"), and ''[[salus populi suprema lex esto]]'' ("the welfare of the people shall be the supreme law"), to justify restriction of individual liberties in order to protect the general welfare.&lt;ref name=Pox /&gt; The concept of police power in America was further expanded in a series of notable court cases in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, including the landmark 1851 [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] case [[Commonwealth v. Alger]], and the 1905 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case [[Jacobson v. Massachusetts]].

== Restrictions ==
{{Geographical imbalance|United States|section|date=July 2017}}
Due to the nebulous definition of the police power, restrictions on its use are few and far between. In Commonwealth v. Alger, Chief Justice [[Lemuel Shaw]] wrote that "It is much easier to perceive and realize the existence and sources of [the police power] than to mark its boundaries, or prescribe limits to exercise."&lt;ref name=Pox /&gt; However, according to historian Michael Willrich, "Shaw recognized certain constitutional restraints on police power, but they were few. Laws must apply equally to all under like circumstances... government interferences with individual rights must be 'reasonable' – they must have a clear relation to some legitimate legislative purpose. Beyond those outer limits... most courts stayed out of the way of state police power."&lt;ref name="Pox 302"&gt;{{cite book|last=Willrich|first=Michael|title=Pox |date=2012|publisher=Penguin |location=New York|isbn=978-0-14-312078-0|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later court cases have expanded somewhat on these restrictions by limiting the ability of states to infringe upon implied constitutional rights and by demanding a stricter standard of [[Legal burden of proof|reasonability]], but regulation of police power remains fairly minimal.&lt;ref&gt;Galva, Jorge E., Christopher Atchinson, and Samuel Levey. "Public Health Strategy and the Police Powers of the State." Public Health Reports 120.1 (2005): 20–27. National Center for Biotechnology Information. Web. 18 Feb. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis of United States land-use planning authority ==
The police power is the basis for [[land-use planning]] authority in the United States. This authority is usually delegated by state governments to local governments, including counties and municipalities. It is these local governments that most frequently exercise police power in land use planning matters. The regulation of land use based on police power is distinct from the taking of private property by the government through the power of eminent domain. If the regulation of land use is done under the authority of the police power, the private property owner isn't typically entitled to compensation as they would be if property was taken under the power of eminent domain. The court decision in the case [[Commonwealth v. Alger]] was related to land use planning and dealt with the construction of a wharf on privately owned tidelands around Boston Harbor.&lt;ref&gt;Understanding the Law of Zoning and Land Use Controls, Barlow Burke, Lexisnexis, Chapter 1, Published 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rita Clay Estrada''' (born July 31, 1941, in [[Michigan]], US) is a US writer of [[romance novels]] as '''Rita Clay''', '''Tira Lacy''' and '''Rita Clay Estrada''', she has also written non-fiction books about writing romance novels. She was the first president of the [[Romance Writers of America]], and founding member with her mother [[Rita Gallagher]].

==Biography==
Born Rita Clay on July 31, 1941, in [[Michigan]], US.  Her mother, [[Rita Gallagher]], was a former Miss Michigan, a romance novelist and a noted writing instructor, while her father was a pilot with the [[U.S. Air Force]].  She spent much of her early years living in Europe.  She married her high school sweetheart when she was very young and stayed at home to raise their four children.  In 1977, when she had been married about 20 years, her husband brought her a typewriter and said, "'You said you always wanted to write.  Now write.'"&lt;ref name="racine"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Racine|first=Marty|title=Romancing the word|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=August 26, 1995|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1995_1293554|accessdate=August 16, 2007|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first attempt was a long historical romance which was promptly rejected.  Her next manuscript, a contemporary romance, was likewise rejected.  Her third manuscript, ''Wanderer's Dream,'' sold to [[Harlequin Enterprises Ltd|Silhouette Books]].  She used her maiden name, Rita Clay for that and an additional seven titles for Silhouette.  In 1982, she moved to Dell to write for their Candlelight Ecstasy line.  Harlequin owned her pen name, so she wrote as Tira Lacy, an anagram of Rita Clay.  In 1985 she re-signed with Harlequin and asked to use her full name, Rita Clay Estrada, on all future books.&lt;ref name="racine"/&gt;

She generally takes 4.5 months to write a novel.  Except for punctuation and fact-checking, she does very little rewriting, as "that's why there are editors."&lt;ref name="racine"/&gt; Generally, she writes five pages each night and more on the weekends.  Her novels have been translated in 23 languages.&lt;ref name="racine"/&gt;

Estrada was a founding member and the first president of the [[Romance Writers of America]] (RWA).  Their signature award, the RITA, which is the highest award of excellence given in the genre of [[romance novel|romantic fiction]], is named for her.&lt;ref name="rwa"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Romance Writers of America]]|title=RITA Awards|url=https://www.rwanational.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?Site=RWA&amp;WebKey=626513aa-6aaa-4e14-9873-6a3c1efbaa87|accessdate=July 4, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630232429/https://www.rwanational.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?Site=RWA&amp;WebKey=626513aa-6aaa-4e14-9873-6a3c1efbaa87|archivedate=June 30, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RWA also awarded Estrada their Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000.&lt;ref name="ward"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Crescent Blues| last=Ward|first=Jean Marie|title=RWA National 2000: Contrasting Passions|url=http://www.crescentblues.com/3_4issue/rwa.shtml|accessdate=July 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She and her husband are divorced.&lt;ref name="racine"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14730">'''Robert Jackson "Bob" Alexander''' (November 26, 1918 – April 27, 2010) was an American political activist, writer, and academic who spent most of his professional career at [[Rutgers University]]. He is best remembered for his pioneering studies on the [[trade union]] movement in [[Latin America]] and dissident [[communism|communist]] political parties, including ground-breaking monographs on the [[Right Opposition|International Communist Right Opposition]], [[Maoism]], and the international [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] movement.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Robert J. Alexander was born in [[Canton, Ohio]] on November 26, 1918. His family moved to [[Leonia, New Jersey]] in 1922, when his father, Ralph S. Alexander accepted a teaching position at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name="Perrone"&gt;Fernanda Perrone, [http://www2.scc.rutgers.edu/ead/manuscripts/alexanderf.html "Biographical Sketch of Robert J. Alexander,"] Inventory to the Papers of Robert Jackson Alexander, Rutgers University.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander graduated from the public high school in 1936 and matriculated at Columbia, receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1940 and a [[Master of Arts]] degree the following year. In 1936 Alexander took a senior trip to Spain, which sparked a lifelong interest in Hispanic cultures.&lt;ref name="Perrone" /&gt;

Alexander was [[conscription|drafted]] in April 1942 into the [[United States Army Air Corps]]. He spent 25 months stationed in [[Great Britain]], during which time he spent his off hours speaking to a number of British trade unionists, taking extensive notes of his conversations.&lt;ref name="Perrone" /&gt; These discussions helped Alexander to refine an interview style of research which would later become a hallmark of his academic work.

After demobilization he began work for the State Department. While there, he received a grant from the Office of International Exchange of Persons of the State Department to work on his [[Ph.D.]] dissertation on labor relations in [[Chile]], where he conducted hundreds of interviews in virtually all the major factories of the country.&lt;ref name="Perrone" /&gt; He received his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1950.

Alexander was married to Joan O. Powell in 1949. The couple had two children.

===Political career===
Alexander was active in the [[socialism|socialist]] and [[trade union]] movements. In 1934, politicized by the [[Great Depression]], Alexander joined the [[Young People's Socialist League (1907)|Young People's Socialist League]], the youth section of the [[Socialist Party of America]].&lt;ref name="Perrone" /&gt; He continued organizing activities for YPSL while at Columbia and remained an active member of its parent group, the Socialist Party of America, serving as a member of its executive council 1957 to 1966.&lt;ref name="Perrone" /&gt; When the Socialist Party changed its name in December 1972 to [[Social Democrats, USA]] (SDUSA), he maintained his membership until 1980; according to Perrone's biographical sketch, Alexander thought that SDUSA had become "too conservative".&lt;ref name="Perrone" /&gt;

It was as a leader of the New Jersey YPSLs that he first met [[Jay Lovestone]], then head of the [[Independent Labor League of America|Communist Party, Opposition]]. Alexander would later go on six missions to Latin America for Lovestone, first under the auspices of the [[Free Trade Union Committee]], then under the direction of the [[AFL-CIO International Department]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert J Alexander ''The Right Opposition; The Lovestoneites and the International Communist Opposition of the 1930s.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1981; pg. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander was a member of the Board of Directors of the [[Rand School of Social Science]] from 1952 until its closure in 1956.&lt;ref name="Perrone" /&gt; He served on the [[League for Industrial Democracy|League for Industrial Democracy's]] National Council and was an active member of [[Americans for Democratic Action]] and a delegate to several of its national conventions.&lt;ref name="Perrone" /&gt;

During the 1950s, Alexander served as a consultant for the [[American Federation of Labor]] and [[AFL-CIO]] on the organized labor movement in Latin American and the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="HomeNews"&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/mycentraljersey/obituary.aspx?n=robert-j-alexander&amp;pid=143630100 "Robert J. Alexander,"] ''Home News Tribune,'' June 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, he was named by president-elect [[John F. Kennedy]] to the Task Force on Latin America, which recommended the establishment of the [[Alliance for Progress]].&lt;ref name="HomeNews" /&gt;

Alexander was also a lifelong member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]].&lt;ref name="HomeNews" /&gt;

===Academic career===
Alexander became an instructor at Rutgers while still in Chile in the late 1940s. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1950, associate professor in 1956, and full professor in 1961.

Although Alexander was a member of the [[Economics]] department at Rutgers, he was an interdisciplinary scholar, working extensively in the fields of [[political science]] and [[history]].&lt;ref name="HomeNews" /&gt; Alexander was regarded as a champion of the principle of [[academic freedom]] and was a founder of the faculty union at Rutgers.&lt;ref name="HomeNews" /&gt;  In 1963 Alexander achieved his "highest honor", the [[Order of the Condor of the Andes]] from the Bolivian government.&lt;ref name="Perrone"/&gt;

Alexander was a founding member of the [[Middle Atlantic Council of Latin American Studies]] (MACLAS), and served as the group's president from 1987 to 1988.&lt;ref name="HomeNews" /&gt;

During his career, Alexander wrote and published extensively on Latin American politics and trade union movements, as well as surveys on dissident radical movements such as the [[Right Opposition]], [[Trotskyism]], and [[Maoism]].

Alexander retired from Rutgers in 1989.

===Death and legacy===
Robert J. Alexander died April 27, 2010. He was 91 years old at the time of his death.

Alexander's voluminous papers are housed by the Special Collections and University Archives section of [[Rutgers University]], located in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]]. The collection includes {{convert|215|cuft|L}} of material, which is housed off site.&lt;ref&gt;Fernanda Perrone, [http://www2.scc.rutgers.edu/ead/manuscripts/alexanderf.html "Inventory to the Papers of Robert Jackson Alexander,"] Special Collections and University Archives, Rutgers University Libraries, April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Salva congruitate'''''&lt;ref&gt;[[W.V.O. Quine]], ''Philosophy of logic''&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Latin]] scholastic term in [[logic]], which means "without becoming ill-formed",&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Benjamin Schnieder, Canonical Property Designators, P9&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[wikt:salvus|salva]]'' meaning ''rescue'', ''salvation'', ''welfare'' and ''[[wikt:congruo|congruitate]]'' meaning ''combine'', ''coincide'', ''agree''. Salva Congruitate is used in logic to mean that two terms may be [[Substitution (logic)|substituted]] for each other while preserving [[grammar|grammaticality]] in all contexts.&lt;ref&gt;W.V.O. Quine, Quiddities, P204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.V.O. Quine, Philosophy of Logic, P18&lt;/ref&gt;

== Remarks on ''salva congruitate'' ==

=== Timothy C. Potts ===

[[Timothy C. Potts]] describes ''salva congruitate'' as a form of replacement in the context of meaning. It is a replacement which preserves [[semantic]] coherence and should be distinguished from a replacement which preserves [[Syntax|syntactic]] coherence but may yield an expression to which no [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]] has been given. This means that supposing an original expression is meaningful, the new expression obtained by the replacement will also be meaningful, though it will not necessarily have the same meaning as the original one, nor, if the expression in question happens to be a [[proposition]], will the replacement necessarily preserve the truth value of the original.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy C. Potts, ''Structures and categories for the representation of meaning'', p57&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bob Hale ===

[[Bob Hale (philosopher)|Bob Hale]] explains ''salva congruitate'', as applied to singular terms, as [[Noun|substantival]] expressions in natural language, which are able to replace singular terms without destructive effect on the [[Syntax|grammar]] of a sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Hale, Singular Terms, P34&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the singular term 'Bob' may be replaced by the definite description 'the first man to swim the English Channel' ''salva congruitate''. Such replacement may shift both meaning and reference, and so, if made in the context of a sentence, may cause a change in truth-value. Thus terms which may be interchanged ''salva congruitate'' may not be interchangeable ''salva veritate'' (preserving truth). More generally, expressions of any type are interchangeable ''salva congruitate'' if and only if they can replace one another preserving grammaticality or well-formedness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3277">To '''see a man about a dog''' or '''horse''' is an English idiom, usually used as a way to apologize for one's imminent departure or absence—generally to euphemistically conceal one's true purpose, such as going to use the toilet or going to buy a drink. The original non-facetious meaning was probably to place or settle a bet on a racing dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Alphabets that became a basis for [[Slavonic languages|Slavonic]] writing were called "[[Glagolitic]]" and "[[Cyrillic]]" alphabets. The history of their emergence is totally unknown. 

== Glagolitic script (10th–11th centuries) ==
The extant monuments of glagolitsa are dated no later than the end of the 10th century.  [[Symbol]]s as a rule are composed of two elements that are combined one above the other.
[[File:глаголица.gif|right|frame|Glagolitic script]]
Such construction can be seen in the decoration of kirillitsa. It usually does not include simple forms. They are connected with straights. Some letters (ш, у, м, ч, э) correspond to their modern form. Regarding the form of letters there are two types of glagolitsa. The first one – [[Bulgaria]]n glagolitsa – has roundish letters, and [[Croatia]]n glagolitsa – called as well [[Illyria]]n or [[Dalmatia]]n – has an angular forms of letters. Neither of the two types has strict border zones of spreading. Later glagolitsa borrowed many sounds from kirillitsa. West Slavic glagolitsa existed for only a short time and was replaced with the Latin writing. But glagolitsa did not perish in modern times. It was used up to the beginning of [[World War II]], and was even used for [[newspaper]]s.  It is currently being used in Croatian settlements of Italy.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

==Cyrillic script – uncial (11th century)==
Its origin remains unexplained. The title appeared later than the alphabet. [[Saint Cyril the Philosopher|St. Cyril]], while travelling across Slavic countries during the 9th century definitely composed a new Slavonic alphabet. It is not known whether it was a glagolitic script or not. It was necessary to translate [[Religious text#Christianity|religious texts]] into the Slavonic language. To do that it would be necessary to simplify intricate and difficult-to-write symbols of glagolitsa, but at the same time introduce the lacking letters for [[sound]] denotations in the spoken Slavonic language.

Many sources of the time describe this, but mention only one Slavonic alphabet though there were already two. The Cyrillic script has 43 letters, 24 of them were borrowed from the [[Byzantium|Byzantium paternal writing]] and the other 19 were invented anew, but in the graphic decorations similar to the first ones. But not all the borrowed letters kept the denotations of the same sound in the Greek language – some received new denotations peculiar to their Slavonic phonetic features.

Bulgarians have preserved the Cyrillic script to a greater extent than other Slavonians. Nowadays their writing (i.e. the Serbian language) is similar to Russian writing except several symbols designating specific phonetic features. The ancient form of the Cyrillic script is called "uncial". Uncial and [[glagolitic alphabet]] are wholly handwritten scripts. Uncial, as well as glagolitic alphabet, has a peculiar trait – clearness and straightness of tracings (writings).

Most letters are angular and have graceless features. Exceptions are narrow roundish letters with round curves – (О, С, Э, Р and  others), and among other letters these seem out of place. Lower elongations of certain letters (Р, У, 3) are idiosyncratic to this type of writing. They appear to be light decorative elements in the context of calligraphy. As for the diacritical symbols, their origin is still unclear. Uncial letters are all of a big size and are set separately from each other. The old uncial has no intervals between words.

==Semi-uncial (14th century)==
Semi-uncial was the second type of writing, that had been developed from the 14th century and later replaced the uncial. This script is brighter and more roundish. Its letters are more shallow: they have many superscript marks and the whole system of [[Punctuation|punctuation marks]]. Letters are more flexible and wide in comparison with the uncial writing and have lower and upper elongations. The broad-pen technique used while writing the uncial is seldom applied in the semi-uncial. Semi-uncial was used with cursive and ligature in the 14th–18th centuries along with the other writing styles.

To use semi-uncial in writing was more comfortable. [[Feudalism|Feudal atomism]] caused the development of unique uncial styles and even an uncial language in some remote districts. Military novels and chronicles occupy the bulk of these manuscripts, but some manuscripts recount historical events in Russia during that period. During [[Ivan III]]'s reign when the land integration and consolidation around Moscow was finished, Moscow became not only a national, but also a cultural center; and the national Russian state was created under a new autocratic regime. So a local Moscow culture became an icon of Russian character. Along with the growing demands of everyday life, the necessity of a new and more simple script was born in the society of Moscow, and thus Russia at large.

==Сursive (15th–17th centuries)==
The term "cursive writing" corresponds to the [[Roman cursive|Latin cursive]]. At the first stage of scripts development the ancient [[Greeks]] had a widely spread writing culture. Some of the south-west Slavonians also had their own scripts. Cursive writing as a separate type of writing emerged in the 15th century in Russia. The partly bound letters and bright patterns differed from other scripts' letters. But since the letters had different marks and signs, pigtails, and additional symbols,
it was difficult to read texts. Although cursive writing reflected semi-uncial,  there were fine lines that bound letters, a feature that contrasts with the semi-uncial. This script is also more flexible and fluent. Letters of cursive writing were written with elongations.

In the beginning the symbols were composed of elongations as is specific to uncial and semi-uncial. In the second half of the 16th century, and especially in the beginning of the 17th century the semi-roundish lines became the major lines. In a broader historical perspective, it is possible to see some elements of the Greek cursive script.

By the second half of the 17th century, when many different variants of writing appeared, the cursive script showed more roundish elements and ligature. The roundish contour of letters became more decorative and smooth near the end of the century. Cursive writing of that time misses elements of the Greek cursive writing and discards some semi-uncial forms. Later straights and cursives attained balance and letters became more symmetrical and roundish. At that period the uncial was transformed into a civil writing cursive.

'''Suzhou''' ([[Wu Chinese]] [''sou˥ tseu˨˩'' ]),&lt;!--Chinese in infoboxes--&gt; [[postal romanization|formerly romanized]] as '''Soochow''', is a major city located in southeastern [[Jiangsu|Jiangsu Province]] of [[East China]], about {{convert|abbr=on|100|km|mi}} northwest of [[Shanghai]]. It is a major economic center and focal point of trade and commerce, and the second largest city in the province, after its capital [[Nanjing]]. The city is situated on the lower reaches of the [[Yangtze River]] and the shores of [[Lake Tai]] and belongs to the [[Yangtze River Delta]] region. Administratively, Suzhou is a [[prefecture-level city]] with a population of 4.33 million in its city proper, and a total resident population ({{As of|2013|lc=y}}) of 10.58 million in its administrative area.&lt;ref name="sz2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Incorporating neighboring suburban regions and the satellite cities of [[Kunshan]], [[Zhangjiagang]], [[Taicang]], and [[Changshu]]. This statement is based on data from local government, while a United Nations report (see below) claims its (urban) population is 5.156 million in 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Its urban population grew at an unprecedented rate of 6.5% between 2000 and 2014, which is the highest among cities with more than 5 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division|title=World Urbanization Prospects: The 2014 Revision|url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wup/Highlights/WUP2014-Highlights.pdf|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Elizabeth MacBride|title=Keep an eye on these emerging market cities|url=http://nbr.com/2014/12/22/keep-an-eye-on-these-emerging-market-cities/|accessdate=1 January 2015|publisher=CNBC|date=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 514{{nbsp}}BC, Suzhou has over 2,500 years of history, with an abundant display of relics and sites of historical interest. Around AD{{nbsp}}100, during the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]], it became one of the ten largest cities in the world mostly due to emigration from [[Northern and southern China|Northern China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tertius Chandler|title=Four Thousand Years of Urban Growth: An Historical Census|year=1987|publisher=St. David's University Press|isbn=978-0889462076}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 Cities of the Year 100|url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201b.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2013-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 10th-century [[Song Dynasty]], it has been an important commercial center of China.

The city's canals, stone bridges, [[pagoda]]s, and meticulously designed [[Chinese garden|gardens]] have contributed to its status as one of the top tourist attractions in China. The [[Classical Gardens of Suzhou]] were added to the list of the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s in 1997 and 2000.

During the [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]], a settlement known as '''Gusu''' after nearby [[Mount Gusu]] (&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|姑蘇|山}}}}, &lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|姑|苏|山}}}}, &lt;small&gt;[[pinyin|p]]&lt;/small&gt; ''Gūsūshān'') became the capital of the [[ancient Chinese states|state]] of [[Wu (state)|Wu]]. From this role, it also came to be called '''Wu''' as well. In 514{{nbsp}}BC, [[King Helü of Wu|King Helü]] of Wu established a new capital nearby at '''Helü City''' and this grew into the modern city. During the [[Warring States period]], Helü City continued to serve as the local seat of government. From the areas it administered, it became known as '''Wuxian''' ({{abbr|lit|literally}}. "[[Wu County]]") and '''Wujun''' ("[[Wu Commandery]]").&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11384/ |title = Supplement to the Local Gazetteer of Wu Prefecture |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1134 |accessdate = 2013-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]], it was known as '''Kuaiji''' after its greatly enlarged commandery, which was named for the [[Mount Kuaiji|reputed resting place]] of [[Yu the Great]] near modern [[Shaoxing]] in [[Zhejiang]].

The name Suzhou was first officially used for the city in AD 589 during the [[Sui dynasty]]. The character {{lang|zh|{{linktext|蘇}}}} or {{lang|zh|{{linktext|苏}}}} is a contraction of the mountain and old name Gusu. The ''sū'' in its name refers to the mint [[perilla]] (''[[shiso]]''). The character {{lang|zh|{{linktext|州}}}} originally meant [[Zhou (Chinese administrative division)|something like a province or county]] (cf. [[Guizhou]]), but often came to be used [[metonymy|metonymously]] for the capital of such a region (cf. [[Guangzhou]], [[Hangzhou]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Chinese Place-names Ancient and Modern'' ({{lang|zh|中国古今地名大词典}}, ''Zhongguo Gujin Diming Dacidian''), p. 1438. [[Shanghai Lexicographical Publishing House]] (Shanghai), 2006. {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suzhou is the [[Hanyu Pinyin]] spelling of the [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] pronunciation of the name. Prior to the adoption of pinyin, it was variously [[romanization of Chinese|romanized]] as '''Soo-chow''', '''Suchow''', or '''Su-chow'''.{{sfnp|''EB''|1887}}{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}

==History==
Suzhou, the cradle of [[Wu (region)|Wu culture]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-01/06/content_296130.htm Suzhou], ''[[China Daily]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://suzhou.jiangsu.net/|title=Suzhou, Jiangsu, China|website=suzhou.jiangsu.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the oldest towns in the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] Basin. By the [[Spring and Autumn period]] of the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]], local tribes named the [[Gou Wu]] are recorded living in the area which would become the modern city of Suzhou. These tribes formed villages on the edges of the hills above the wetlands surrounding [[Lake Tai]].

[[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' records traditional accounts that the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] lord [[Wu Taibo|Taibo]] established the [[state of Wu]] at nearby Wuxi during the 11th century{{nbsp}}BC, civilizing the local people and improving their agriculture and mastery of irrigation. The Wu court later moved to Gusu within the area of modern Suzhou. In 514{{nbsp}}BC,{{refn|The old editions of the ''Britannica'' give the erroneous date of AD{{nbsp}}484.{{sfnp|''EB''|1887}}{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}}} [[King Helü of Wu|King Helü]] of Wu relocated his court nearby and called the settlement Helü City after himself. His minister [[Wu Zixu]] was closely involved with its planning and it was this site that grew into present-day Suzhou. The height of his tower on Gusu Hill (''Gusutai'') passed into Chinese legend. In 496{{nbsp}}BC, King Helü was buried at [[Tiger Hill, Suzhou|Tiger Hill]]. In 473{{nbsp}}BC, Wu was defeated and annexed by [[State of Yue|Yue]], a kingdom to its southeast; Yue was annexed in turn by [[State of Chu|Chu]] in 306{{nbsp}}BC. Remnants of the ancient kingdom include pieces of its 2,500-year-old city wall and the gate through it at [[Pan Gate]].

The city was originally laid out according to a symbolic three-by-three grid of nine squares, with the royal palace occupying the central position.&lt;ref&gt;Xu (2000), pp. 34–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Warring States]] period, Suzhou was the seat of [[Wu County]] and Commandery. Following the [[Qin Empire]]'s conquest of the area in 222{{nbsp}}BC, it was made the capital of [[Kuaiji Commandery]], including lands stretching from the south bank of the [[Yangtze]] to the unconquered interior of [[Minyue]] in southern [[Zhejiang]]. Amid the [[fall of Qin|collapse of the Qin]], Kuaiji's governor Yin Tong attempted to organize his own rebellion only to be betrayed and executed by [[Xiang Liang]] and his nephew [[Xiang Yu]], who launched their own rebellion from the city.

When the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] was completed, Suzhou found itself strategically located on a major trade route.{{sfnp|''EB''|1887}} In the course of the [[history of China]], it has been a metropolis of industry and commerce on the southeastern coast of China. During the [[Tang dynasty]], the great poet [[Bai Juyi]] constructed the Shantang Canal (better known as "[[Shantang Street]]") to connect the city with Tiger Hill for tourists. In AD{{nbsp}}1035, the [[Suzhou Confucian Temple]] was founded by famed poet and writer [[Fan Zhongyan]]. It became a venue for the [[keju|imperial civil examinations]] and then developed into the modern [[Suzhou High School]] in the 1910s.

In February 1130, the advancing [[Jin Dynasty, 1115–1234|Jin]] army from the north ransacked the city. This was followed by the [[Mongol invasion of China|Mongol invasion]] in 1275. In 1356, Suzhou became the capital of [[Zhang Shicheng]], one of the leaders of the [[Red Turban Rebellion]] against the [[Yuan dynasty]] and the self-proclaimed King of [[Kingdom of Dazhou|Wu]]. In 1367, Zhang's [[Nanjing]]-based rival [[Zhu Yuanzhang]] took the city after a 10-month siege. Zhu {{ndash}} who was soon to proclaim himself the [[Hongwu Emperor|first emperor]] of the [[Ming Dynasty]] {{ndash}} demolished the royal city in the center of Suzhou's walled city and imposed crushing taxes on the city and prefecture's powerful families.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Linda C.

SUNY Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-7914-1423-X}}, 9780791414231.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the heavy taxation and the resettlement of some of Suzhou's prominent citizens' to the area of Hongwu's capital at Nanjing, Suzhou was soon prosperous again. During the early Ming, Suzhou Prefecture supervised the [[Yangtze]] [[shoal]]s which later became [[Shanghai]]'s [[Chongming Island]].&lt;ref name=eos&gt;[http://zhuanti.shanghai.gov.cn/encyclopedia/en/Default2.aspx#50 "Chongming County" in the ''Encyclopedia of Shanghai'', pp.&amp;nbsp;50&amp;nbsp;ff.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110191937/http://zhuanti.shanghai.gov.cn/encyclopedia/en/Default2.aspx |date=10 January 2015 }} Shanghai Scientific &amp; Technical Publishers (Shanghai), 2010.

When the shipwrecked Korean official [[Choe Bu]] had a chance to see much of Eastern China from Zhejiang to Liaoning on his way home in 1488, he described Suzhou in his travel report as exceeding every other city.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, Timothy. ''[[The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China]]''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988. {{ISBN|0-520-22154-0}}. Page 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the area's private gardens were constructed by the gentry of the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties. The iconoclast [[Taiping Rebellion|Taipings]] captured the city in 1860, however, and its former buildings and gardens were "almost... a heap of ruins"{{sfnp|''EB''|1887}} by the time of their recovery by [[Charles George Gordon|Charles Gordon]]'s [[Ever-Victorious Army]] in November 1863.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} Nonetheless, by 1880, its population was estimated to have recovered to about 500,000,{{sfnp|''EB''|1887}} which remained stable for the next few decades.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} In the late 19th century, the town was particularly known for its wide range of silks and its Chinese-language publishing industry.{{sfnp|''EB''|1887}} The town was first opened to direct foreign trade by the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] ending the [[First Sino-Japanese War]]{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} and by the [[most favored nation]] clauses of earlier [[unequal treaties]] with the [[Great Powers]]. The new expatriates opened a European-and-Chinese school in 1900 and the [[Suzhou Railway Station]], connecting it with [[Shanghai Railway Station|Shanghai]], opened{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} on July 16, 1906. Just prior to the [[First World War]], there were 7000 silk looms in operation, as well as a cotton mill and a large trade in rice.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}
{{Wide image|Prosperous Suzhou.jpg|5000px|''[[Prosperous Suzhou]]'' by [[Xu Yang (Qing dynasty)|Xu Yang]]|dir=rtl}}

As late as the early 20th century, much of the city consisted of islands connected by rivers, creeks, and canals to the surrounding countryside.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} Prior to their demolition, the city walls ran in a circuit of about {{convert|10|mi|sp=us}} with four large suburbs lying outside.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} The [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invaded]] in 1937, and many gardens were again devastated by the end of the war. In the early 1950s, restoration was done on the [[Humble Administrator's Garden]] and the [[Lingering Garden]].

The urban core of Suzhou is informally called the "Old Town". It is [[Gusu District]]. [[Suzhou Industrial Park]] is to the east of the old town, and [[Suzhou High &amp; New Technology Development Zone]] is to the west. In 2000, the original [[Wu County]] was divided into two districts including [[Xiangcheng District, Suzhou|Xiangcheng]] and [[Wuzhong District|Wuzhong]]. They now form the northern and southern parts of the city of Suzhou.In 2012, the original Wujiang City became Wujiang District of Suzhou City.

Suzhou is one of the most prosperous cities in China. Its development has a direct correlation with the growth of its [[satellite town|satellite cities]], including [[Kunshan]], [[Taicang]], [[Changshu]], and [[Zhangjiagang]], which together with the city of Suzhou form the Suzhou prefecture. The Suzhou prefecture is home to many high-tech enterprises.

===Climate===
Suzhou has a four-season [[humid subtropical climate]] with hot, humid summers and cool, cloudy, damp winters with occasional snowfall ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''). Northwesterly winds blowing from [[Siberia]] during winter can cause temperatures to fall below freezing at night, while southerly or southwesterly winds during the summer can push temperatures above {{convert|35|°C}}. The hottest temperature recorded since 1951 was at {{convert|41.0|°C|0}} on 7 August 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jsnews.jschina.com.cn/system/2013/08/08/018192790.shtml {{lang|zh|中国江苏网}}] [''Míngchéng Xīnwén Wǎng'', City News Online].

In 2015, both 800-year-old Pingjiang Road Historical Block ({{lang|zh|平江路}}) and 1,200-year-old Shantang Street Scenic Area ({{lang|zh|山塘街}}) were added to the list of China's "National Historic and Cultural Streets".&lt;ref name="en.visitsz.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.visitsz.com/sight.html|title=Official Travel and Tourism Website for Suzhou|website=en.visitsz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/regional/2015-05/11/content_20683041.htm|title=Historical streets in Jiangsu listed as national heritage|website=China Daily|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Pingjiang Road runs parallel to the Pingjiang River for 1.5 kilometers and is lined with homes and some teahouses. Shantang Street, over twice as long at 3.8 km, is described by the [[BBC]] as  retaining "the alluring qualities of an old canal-side street: whitewashed buildings are completed by red-tasselled lanterns that swing softly in the breeze, adding to the charm of the river bank".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/bespoke/specials/suzhou-city-of-classical-charms/water-city.html|title=Suzhou: China’s Canal Capital|website=BBC Travel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resorts and Natural Reserves===
Suzhou Taihu National Tourism and Vacation Zone ({{lang|zh-hans|苏州太湖国家旅游度假区}}) is in the western part of Suzhou, {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} from the city center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.99taihu.com/news/?188.html | script-title=zh:苏州太湖旅游度假区顺利晋级5A级景区 | accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://suzhou.chinatupai.com/Suzhou/index.php/news,show,id,9567 | script-title=zh:苏州太湖国家旅游度假区中心区控制性详细规划公示 | accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skyscrapers===
{{Main|List of tallest buildings in Suzhou}}
[[Gate to the East]] is a 301.8 meter, 74-story skyscraper in Suzhou's central business district, built in 2015 at a cost of 700 million [[USD]] and is currently the tallest building in Suzhou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=$700 million skyscraper 'resembles a pair of pants' | url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/m-skyscraper-resembles-pair-of-pants/story-e6frfq80-1226465544901 | accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pan Gate===
[[Pan Gate]] ({{lang|zh-hans|{{linktext|盘|门}}}}) is on the southwest corner of the Main Canal or encircling canal of Suzhou. Originally built during the [[Warring States]] Period in the state of Wu, historians estimate it to be around 2,500 years old. It is now part of the ''Pan Gate Scenic Area''. It is known for the "three landmarks of Pan Gate". They are the [[Ruiguang Pagoda]]({{zh|labels=no |c=瑞光塔}}), the earliest pagoda in Suzhou built in 247{{nbsp}}BC, the ''Wu Gate Bridge'', the entrance to the gate at that time over the water passage and the highest bridge in Suzhou at the time, and the ''Pan Gate''. The Ruigang Pagoda is constructed of brick with wooden platforms and has Buddhist carvings at its base.

===Baodai Bridge===
[[Baodai Bridge]] ({{zh|labels=no |l=Precious Belt Bridge |s=宝带桥}}) stretches across the Tantai Lake in the suburbs of Suzhou. To raise money to finance the bridge, the magistrate donated his expensive belt, hence the name. The bridge was first built in 806 A.D. in the [[Tang Dynasty]] and has 53 arches with a length of 317 meters. It was made out of stone from [[Jingshan Mountains|Jinshan Mountain]] and is the longest standing bridge of its kind in China. The bridge was included on the list of national monuments (resolution 5-285) in 2001.

===Tiger Hill===
The [[Tiger Hill, Suzhou|Tiger Hill]] is known for its natural environment and historical sites. The hill is so named because it is said to look like a crouching tiger. Another legend states that a white tiger appeared on the hill to guard it following the burial The hill has been a tourist destination for hundreds, if not thousands, of years, as is evident from the poetry and calligraphy carved into rocks on the hill. The Song Dynasty poet, [[Su Shi]] said, "It is a lifelong pity if having visited Suzhou you did not visit Tiger Hill."

===Pagodas===
[[Huqiu Tower|Yunyan Pagoda]] ({{lang|zh|虎丘塔}} or {{lang|zh|云岩寺塔}}), built in 961, is a [[Chinese pagoda]] built on Tiger Hill in Suzhou. It has several other names, including the "Leaning Tower of China" (as referred to by historian O.G. Ingles)&lt;ref name="ingles 144"&gt;Ingles (1982), 144.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Yunyan Temple Tower. The tower rises to a height of 47&amp;nbsp;m (154&amp;nbsp;ft). It is a seven-story octagonal building built with blue bricks. In more than a thousand years the tower has gradually slanted due to forces of nature. Now the top and bottom of the tower vary by 2.32 meters. The entire structure weighs some {{convert|7000000|kg}}, supported by internal brick columns.&lt;ref name="ingles 145"&gt;Ingles (1982), 145.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the tower leans roughly 3 degrees due to the cracking of two supporting columns.&lt;ref name="ingles 145"/&gt;

[[Beisi Pagoda]]({{zh|labels=no |c=北寺塔}}) or North Temple Pagoda is a Chinese pagoda at Bao'en Temple in Suzhou. It rises nine stories in a height of {{convert|76|m|abbr=on}}. It is the tallest Chinese pagoda south of the Yangtze river.

Twin Pagodas ({{zh|labels=no |s=苏州双塔}}) lie in the Dinghui Temple Lane in the southeastern corner of the city proper of Suzhou. They are artistic and natural as they are close at hand. One of them is called Clarity-Dispensing Pagoda and the other Beneficence Pagoda and they are in the same form of building. There are many legends about the one-thousand-year-old pagodas. It is charming that the exquisite and straight Twin Pagoda look like two inserted writing brushes. There was originally a single-storey house with three rooms just like a writing brush holder with the shadows of the two pagodas reclining on its roof at sunset. To the east of the pagoda is a square five-storeyed bell building built in the [[Ming Dynasty]] which is exactly like a thick ink stick. So there is a saying that "the Twin Pagodas are as writing brushes while the bell building as ink stick".

===Museums===
The city's major museums include the [[Suzhou Museum]] (designed by [[I. M. Pei]]), [[Suzhou Silk Museum]], and [[Suzhou Museum of Opera and Theatre]].

==Economy==
Suzhou's economy is based primarily on its large manufacturing sector—China's second largest—including iron and steel, IT and electronic equipment, and textile products. The city's service sector is notably well-developed, primarily owing to tourism, which brought in a total of RMB 152 billion of revenue in 2013. Suzhou's overall GDP exceeded RMB 1.3 trillion in 2013 (up 9.6 percent from the year previous).&lt;ref name="china-briefing.com"&gt;[http://www.china-briefing.com/news/2014/05/02/china-regional-focus-suzhou-jiangsu-province.html "China Regional Focus: Suzhou, Jiangsu Province"], ''China Briefing'', Shanghai, 02 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is also one of China's foremost destinations for foreign investment, based on its relative proximity to Shanghai and comparatively low operating costs. The municipal government has enacted various measures to encourage FDI in a number of manufacturing (e.g. pharmaceutical, electronic goods, automobile) and service (e.g. banking, logistics, research services) sectors. Included among these measures is a preferential tax policy for limited partnership venture capital enterprises in the Suzhou Industrial Park.&lt;ref name="china-briefing.com"/&gt;

===Railway===
Suzhou is on the Shanghai-Nanjing corridor which carries three parallel railways. [[Suzhou Railway Station]], near the city center, is among the busiest passenger stations in China. It is served by the [[Beijing–Shanghai Railway]] (mostly "conventional" trains to points throughout China) and the [[Shanghai-Nanjing Intercity Railway]] (high-speed D- and G-series trains providing frequent service primarily between Shanghai and Nanjing). It takes only 25 minutes to reach [[Shanghai Railway Station]] on the fastest G-series trains and less than 2 hours to Nanjing.

The [[Suzhou North Railway Station]], a few kilometers to the north, is on the [[Beijing–Shanghai High-Speed Railway]] (opened 2011), served by high-speed trains to Beijing, Qingdao, etc.

Other stations on the [[Beijing–Shanghai Railway]] and the [[Shanghai-Nanjing Intercity Railway]] serve other points in the same corridor within Suzhou Prefecture-level city, such as [[Kunshan]]. In and between Suzhou and South KunShan station, Suzhou Industrial Park Railway Station now also becomes an important station for people visiting and living in the areas.

The northern part of the city, including such county-level cities as [[Zhangjiagang]], [[Changshu]] and [[Taicang]], presently has no rail service. However, plans exist for a cross-[[Yangtze River|river]] railway from Nantong to the [[Shanghai]] metropolitan area (the [[Shanghai–Nantong Railway]]), which will run through most of these county-level cities. Construction work is expected to start in 2013 and to take five and a half years.&lt;ref name=hcp20121224&gt;[http://news.huochepiao.com/2012-12/2012122419242969.htm 沪通铁路2013年正式开建 南通到上海仅需一小时] (Construction work on the Hu-Tong Railway will officially start in 2013.

This is diametrically opposed to the evolutionary view of religion, another hypothesis which holds that religion progressed from simple forms to complex: first preanimism, then [[animism]], [[totemism]], [[polytheism]] and finally monotheism (see [[Anthropology of religion]]).&lt;ref name=Dhavamony &gt;{{cite book | last1 = Dhavamony | first1 = Mariasusai | title = Phenomenology of religión | publisher = Editrice Pontificia Università Gregoriana | year = 1973 | pages = 60–64 | isbn = 88-7652-474-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Scottish anthropologist [[Andrew Lang]] concluded in 1898 that the idea of a high god or "All Father" existed among some of the simplest of contemporary tribes prior to Western contact.&lt;ref name=Dhavamony/&gt;

Urmonotheism was first defended by [[Wilhelm Schmidt (linguist)| Wilhelm Schmidt]] (1868–1954), in his ''Der Ursprung der Gottesidee'' appearing from 1912, opposing the "Revolutionary Monotheism" approach that traces the emergence of monotheistic thought as a gradual process spanning the Bronze and Iron Age [[Religions of the Ancient Near East]] and [[Classical Antiquity]].&lt;ref name = Pettazzoni &gt;{{cite journal | title = Das Ende des Urmonotheismus | journal = [[Numen (journal) |Numen]] |date = April 1958| first = Raffaele | last = Pettazzoni |authorlink= Raffaele Pettazzoni | volume = 5 | issue = 2 |language= German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alleged traces of primitive monotheism were located in the deities Assyrian [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] and [[Marduk]], and Hebrew [[YHWH]]. Monotheism in Schmidt's view is the "natural" form of theism, which was later overlaid and "degraded" by [[polytheism]].&lt;ref name = Pettazzoni/&gt;

Schmidt's hypothesis was controversially discussed during much of the first half of the 20th century. In the 1930s, Schmidt adduced evidence from [[Native American mythology]], Australian aborigines and other primitive civilizations in support of his views.&lt;ref&gt;''High Gods in North America'', 1933&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Origin and Growth of Religion: Facts and Theories," 1931&lt;/ref&gt; He also responded to his critics. For instance, he rejected Rafael Pettazzoni's claim that the sky gods were merely a dim personification or embodiment of the physical sky, writing in "The Origin and Growth of Religion": "The outlines of the Supreme Being become dim only among later peoples".&lt;ref name="Schmidt 1972, page 211"&gt;Schmidt, "The Origin and Growth of Religion: Facts and Theories," New York: Cooper Square Publishers, 1972, page 211&lt;/ref&gt; He adds that "a being who lives in the sky, who stands behind the celestial phenomena, who must 'centralize' in himself the various manifestations [of thunder, rain, etc.] is not a personification of the sky at all".&lt;ref name="Schmidt 1972, page 211"/&gt; According to Ernest Brandewie in ''Wilhelm Schmidt and the Origin of the Idea of God'', Schmidt also claims that Pettazzoni fails to study Schmidt's work seriously and often relies on incorrect translations of Schmidt's German.&lt;ref&gt;Brandewie, ''Wilhelm Schmidt and the Origin of the Idea of God'', Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1983, page 251&lt;/ref&gt; Brandewie also says Pettazzoni's definition of primitive ethical monotheism is an "arbitrary" straw-man argument, but he says Schmidt went too far when he claimed that such ethical monotheism was the earliest religious idea.&lt;ref&gt;Brandewie, pages 44 and 119&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1950s the academic establishment had rejected the hypothesis of primitive ethical monotheism, so the proponents of Schmidt's "Vienna school" rephrased his ideas to the effect that while ancient cultures may not have known "true monotheism", they at least show evidence for "original [[theism]]" (''Ur-Theismus'', as opposed to non-theistic [[animism]]), with a concept of ''Hochgott'' ("High God", as opposed to ''Eingott'' "Single God"). [[Christian apologetics]] in the light of this have moved away from postulating a "memory of revelation" in pre-Christian religions, replacing it with an "inkling of redemption" or [[virtuous paganism]] unconsciously anticipating monotheism.&lt;ref name = Pettazzoni/&gt; That said, [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]] noted in ''Theories of Primitive Religion'', first published in 1962, that most anthropologists have abandoned all evolutionary schemes like Schmidt and Pettazzoni's for the historical development of religion, adding that they have also found monotheistic beliefs existing side-by-side with other religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Wardak Vase''' is the name of an ancient globular-shaped buddhist [[copper]] vase that was found as part of a [[stupa]] [[relic]] deposit in the  early nineteenth century near [[Chaki Wardak]] in [[Maidan Wardak Province|Wardak Province]], [[Afghanistan]]. The importance of the vase lies in the long [[Kharoshthi]] inscription, which claims that the stupa contained the relics of the [[Buddha]]. Since 1880, the vase has been part of the [[British Museum]]'s [[The British Museum Department of Asia|Asian collection]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=105550&amp;plaA=105550-3-1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/b/bronze_reliquary_and_kushan_co.aspx British Museum Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Discovery==
The vase, coins and other relics were found by the [[United Kingdom|British]] adventurer and spy [[Charles Masson]] in 1836. Mason unearthed the vase in one of the stupas near the town of Wardak.  The finds were sent to London in 1839, where they became part of the Indian Museum's collection. In 1880, they were transferred to the [[British Museum]].

==Description==
The Wardak Vase is [[spherical]] in shape and made of copper alloy. The vase has a slim neck with an inverted rim and a low flat base. It has a series of three parallel [[Grooves (archaeology)|grooves]] running around the middle of the vase (with a further two pairs of grooves above and below). Engraved between the upper and middle grooves are four lines of Kharoshthi script that dates the vase and deposit to the year 178 AD. With the vase were found a number of beads and sixty-six coins of the [[Kushan]] Kings [[Vima Kadphises]], [[Kanishka I]] and [[Huvishka]].

==Inscription==
The long inscription refers to the Kushan year 51 in the reign of Kanishka I who reigned between AD 110 and 120, but also refers to one of his successors Huvishka, who ruled between AD 146 and 83; it thus provides useful evidence for reconstructing the chronological reigns of Kushan [[Royal family|royalty]] at the time. The inscription also indicates that the [[monastery]] was built by the [[Mahasanghikas]], one of the earliest buddhist schools in India, who were based at [[Mathura]], near Delhi. The vase therefore provides strong evidence for the widespread distribution of Buddhism in [[South Asia]] almost 2000 years ago.

==Translation of the Inscription==
A translation of the inscription is described below:

"In the 51st year, in the month Artemisios, after 15 (days), at this time Vag̱amareg̱a, son of Kamagulya; he has made his abode here in Khavada (and) establishes in the Vag̱amareg̱a monastery in a stūpa a relic of the Lord, the Śākya sage."
