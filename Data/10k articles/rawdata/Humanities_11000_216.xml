The Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam universally accepts the process of evolution, albeit divinely guided, and actively promotes it. Over the course of several decades, the movement has issued various publications in support of the scientific concepts behind the process of evolution and frequently engages in promoting how religious scripture supports the concept.

==Views on creationism and intelligent design==

Ahmadi Muslims do not take all the [[Quranic]] and [[Biblical]] [[Creationism|creation]] narratives literally, but understand some of the passages metaphorically. [[Darwinian evolution]] as well as [[Intelligent design]] models are rejected as are certain aspects of [[Islamic creationism]] that some modernist religious bodies have postulated. Instead they propound the concept of "Guided Evolution" (analogous, or identical, to the doctrine of [[theistic evolution]] or [[evolutionary creationism]] held by almost all liberal Christians, and some others) which is demonstrated as being supported both by scriptural and scientific evidence. 

Ahmadis favor the perspective that the human race evolved out of the earth over a long period of time. The [[Qur'an]] teaches that man was created from the earth through a gradual evolutionary process in the following verses:

{{quote|And He [Allah/God] has created you in different stages and different forms ... And Allah has caused you to develop as a good growth from the earth.|Qur'an 71:14,17}}

These verses illustrate that the creation of the human race was the culmination of a gradual evolutionary process and that it would be incorrect to say (as [[Creationism]]/[[Intelligent design]] suggests) that God formed the human being in an instant.&lt;ref name="original_sin"&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/library/links/original_sin.html Quran, Adam and Original Sin], by Belal Khalid&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Ahmadis accept the concept of evolution in principle, but do not accept Darwinian evolution in all its details.

==Adam and Eve==

Ahmadi Muslims also reject the creationist doctrine that [[Adam]] was the first human being on Earth, and proclaim that he was appointed as the first Prophet of God. This is supported by the verse of the [[Qur'an]] which refers to the appointment of a Representative of God on earth, rather than the creation of a new species, viz: 

{{quote|[2:30] And when thy Lord said to the angels: ‘I am about to appoint a Vicegerent in the earth,’ they said: ‘Wilt Thou place therein such as will cause disorder in it, and shed blood? — and we glorify Thee with Thy praise and extol Thy holiness.’ He answered: ‘I know what you know not.’}}

Ahmadis reason logically that the angels could only have questioned the appointment of a human being as a Prophet  because they had already witnessed disorder and bloodshed amongst the already existing humans. 

The story of [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] as given in the Bible is viewed by Ahmadis as being more of an account of religious history than a history of the entire human race. 

Belal Khalid, an Ahmadi scholar, clarified in his work, “Original Sin”:

{{quote|When the stage of the full development of the mental faculties of man was reached, God sent His revelation to the most perfect man of that generation, namely, Hadhrat Adam (as).

In short, the Quran teaches that man's physical creation and development are the result of a process of evolution and in the same way his intellectual development is also the result of a process of evolution. Hadhrat Adam (as) was not the first human being, but was the first human being whose intellect was capable of accepting and bearing the responsibility of revelation.”&lt;ref name="original_sin" /&gt;}}

==Guided evolution==
Rather than adopting the [[Darwinist]] theory of unguided natural selection, Ahmadi Muslims promote the supposition of “guided evolution” as being part of the progressive design of God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/library/articles/Guided_evolution_and_punctuated_equilibrium-20081104MN.pdf Guided evolution and punctuated equilibrium]&lt;/ref&gt;  As such they deny that [[natural selection]] occurred purely by chance,&lt;ref&gt;Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth: [http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_5_section_5.html Part V, Section 5: Survival by Accident or Design?]&lt;/ref&gt; or merely by survival of the fittest&lt;ref&gt;Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth: [http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_5_section_8.html Part V, Section 8: Natural Selection and Survival of the Fittest]&lt;/ref&gt; – and view each stage of the evolutionary process as being selectively and continually woven to an intricate level by one creator (Allah).&lt;ref&gt;Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth: [http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_5_section_12.html Part V, Section 12: Organic Systems and Evolution]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Furthermore, illustrated with scientific theories and Quranic scripture, Ahmadis contend that the processes of life on Earth started from one single point of species (bacteria)&lt;ref&gt;Review of Religions eGazette November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; with a mixture of water and a viscous clay-like substance.&lt;ref&gt;Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth: [http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_5_section_4.html Part V, Section 4: The Essential Role of Clay and Photosynthesis in Evolution]&lt;/ref&gt;  From the source of that one single organism, to the point of the first Prophet Adam (so the Ahmadiyya view) was a slow gradual evolutionary process that occurred over several stages (Lane). Each stage being of a variable timescale - perhaps over billions of years.&lt;ref&gt;Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth: [http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_5_section_1.html Part V, Section 1: Life in the Perspective of Quranic Revelations – A Brief Introductory Chapter]&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of Ahmadiyya consider that the notion of unguided 'natural selection' does not adequately explain how various species that have progressed from the lowest forms to the highest forms have solely depended upon occurrence of random mutations within the gene pool, or purely by the demands of environmental factors. In his book ''Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge and Truth'' (published 1998), [[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]], the late leader of the Ahmadiyya movement, elaborated the complex mechanism of evolution as having been played more like strategic game of Chess than a game of Dice.&lt;ref&gt;Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth: [http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_5_section_10.html Part V, Section 10: A Game of Chess or a Game of Chance!]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently evolutionary processes could only have been guided by a vastly higher intelligence (God).

==Creation of the universe==
{{Ahmadiyya|Distinct views}}
Similar to [[Theistic realism]] and the stance of modernist Islamic scholars, Ahmadis adopt a scientific cosmological approach to explaining the formation of universe initiated from the [[Big Bang]]&lt;ref&gt;Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth: [http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_4_section_5.html Part IV, Section 5: The Quran and Cosmology]&lt;/ref&gt; and highlight how these theories relate with Quranic scripture. 

Some of the following verses for example, illustrate how certain aspects of modern scientific theory correspond with religious scripture:

{{quote|Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together,&lt;br /&gt;
then We clove them asunder and We created every living thing out of the water. &lt;br /&gt;
Will they not then believe?|Qur'an 21:30 
('''[[Big Bang|Big Bang Theory]]''' and the origin of life from water)}}

{{quote|Then turned He to the heaven when it was smoke, &lt;br /&gt;
and said unto it and unto the earth: &lt;br /&gt;
Come both of you, willingly or loth. &lt;br /&gt;
They said: We come, obedient.|Qur'an 41:11 ('''The Earth from [[Nebulae]]. ''')}}

{{quote|On the day when We will roll up heaven like the &lt;br /&gt;
rolling up of the scroll for writings, &lt;br /&gt;
as We originated the first creation, (so) We &lt;br /&gt;
shall reproduce it; a promise (binding on Us); &lt;br /&gt;
surely We will bring it about.|Qur'an 21:104 ('''[[Big crunch]] Theory''')}}

Ahmadis also explain these verses were written over 1400 years ago – long before mankind had reached any level of scientific insight. Thus modern science has recently uncovered proofs about the universe which contend with these verses, so this is indication that the verses were revealed from the God that created the universe.

==Six individual phases of creation==
Furthermore, Ahmadis highlight several verses in the Quran where it mentions of "Six periods of creation" and use these verses to explain 
the theory that the universe began roughly 13 billion years ago. 
A single period, in the Ahmadi view, has no definitive timescale and could mean anywhere from one day to billions of years. 

{{quote|And, verily, We created the heavens &lt;br /&gt;
and the Earth and all that is between &lt;br /&gt;
them in six periods and no weariness &lt;br /&gt;
touched Us.|Qur'an 50:38}}

According to the Ahmadiyya view the universe passed from stage to stage till the Earth assumed a shape and developed properties which could sustain human life.

==Extraterrestrial evolution==
Generally, Ahmadis believe that life is almost certainly not limited to planet Earth. The possibility of life having evolved on other planets is clearly established in the first chapter of the Qur'an which speaks of the plurality of worlds:

{{quote|All praise belongs to Allah, Lord of '''All the Worlds'''.|Quran 1:2}}

{{quote|It is Allah who has created seven heavens and of the earth, '''the like of them'''. [His] command descends among them so you may know that Allah is over all things competent and that Allah has encompassed all things in knowledge.|Quran 65:12}}

The following verse corroborates this interpretation:

{{quote|And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and of whatever living creatures (da'bbah) He has spread forth in both. And He has the power to gather them together when He will so please".|42:29}}

Ahmadis believe that any planet that contains the key ingredient of life—water—may also harbour life, as God has created all living things from water: 

{{quote|We (God) created every living thing out of the water.|Qur'an 21:30}}

'''Arab Americans''' ({{lang-ar|عَرَبٌ أَمْرِيكِيُّونَ}} or {{lang|ar|أمريكيون من أصل عربي}}) are [[Americans]] of [[Arab]] ethnic, cultural and linguistic heritage or [[Identity (social science)|identity]], who identify themselves as Arab. Arab Americans trace ancestry to any of the various waves of [[immigrants]] of the countries comprising the [[Arab World]].

According to the [[Arab American Institute]] (AAI), countries of origin for Arab Americans include [[Algeria]], [[Bahrain]], [[Comoros]], [[Djibouti]], [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Mauritania]], [[Morocco]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sudan]], [[Syria]], [[Tunisia]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="Aait"&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|title=Texas|url=http://www.aaiusa.org/page/file/b44c4328067fdc4dce_fybmvypay.pdf/TXdemographics.pdf|publisher=Arab American Institute|date=2003|accessdate=26 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207192658/http://www.aaiusa.org/page/file/b44c4328067fdc4dce_fybmvypay.pdf/TXdemographics.pdf|archivedate=7 February 2012|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[2010 U.S. Census]], there are 1,697,570 Arab Americans in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_B04003&amp;prodType=table|title=American FactFinder - Results|author=Data Access and Dissemination Systems (DADS)|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 290,893 persons defined themselves as simply ''Arab'', and a further 224,241 as ''Other Arab''. Other groups on the 2010 Census are listed by nation of origin, and some may or may not be Arabs, or regard themselves as Arabs. The largest subgroup is by far the [[Lebanese Americans]], with 501,907,&lt;ref name=b04003&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_B04003&amp;prodType=table|title=B04003.

Approximately 1/4 of all Arab Americans claimed two ancestries.

A number of peoples that may have lived in Arab countries and are now resident in the United States are ''not'' classified as Arabs, including [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] (aka [[Chaldo-Assyrians]]), [[Jews]], [[Kurds]], [[Iraqi Turkmens]], [[Azeri]]s, [[Mandeans]], [[Circassians]], [[Shabaki]], [[Armenian people|Armenians]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Georgian people|Georgians]], [[Yazidi]]s, [[Balochs]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]] and [[Kawliya]]/[[Romani people|Romani]].

[[File:Census Bureau 2000, Arabs in the United States.png|thumb|right|350px]]
[[File:Arab1346.png|thumb|Arab ancestry|350px]]
The majority of Arab Americans, around 62%, originate from the region of the [[Levant]], which includes [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Jordan]], although overwhelmingly from Lebanon. The remainder are made up of those from [[Egypt]], [[Somalia]], [[Morocco]], [[Iraq]], [[Libya]], the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC]] and other Arab nations.

There are nearly 3.5 million Arab Americans in the United States according to The [[Arab American Institute]]. Arab-Americans live in all 50 states and in [[Washington, D.C.]], and 94% reside in the metropolitan areas of major cities. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the city with the largest percentage of Arab Americans is [[Dearborn, Michigan]], a southwestern suburb of [[Detroit]], at nearly 40%. The [[Metro Detroit|Detroit metropolitan area]] is home to the largest concentration of Arab Americans (403,445), followed by the [[New York City Metropolitan Area|New York City Combined Statistical Area]] (371,233), Los Angeles (308,295), San Francisco Bay Area (250,000), Chicago (176,208), and the Washington D.C area. (168,208).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://aai.3cdn.net/9298c231f3a79e30c6_g7m6bx9hs.pdf|title=Arab American Population Highlights|work=[[Arab American Institute|Arab American Institute Foundation]]|location=Washington, DC|accessdate=7 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723000336/http://aai.3cdn.net/9298c231f3a79e30c6_g7m6bx9hs.pdf|archivedate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Note: This information is reportedly based upon survey findings but is contradicted by information posted on the Arab American Institute website itself, which states that California as a whole only has 272,485, and Michigan as a whole only 191,607. The 2010 American Community Survey information, from the American Factfinder website, gives a figure of about 168,000 for Michigan.)

Sorting by American states, according to the 2000 U.S. Census, 48% of the Arab-American population, 576,000, reside in [[California]], [[Michigan]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Florida]], and [[New Jersey]], respectively; these 5 states collectively have 31% of the net U.S. population. Five other states - [[Illinois]], [[Texas]], [[Ohio]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Pennsylvania]] - report Arab-American populations of more than 40,000 each.  Also, the counties which contained the greatest proportions of Arab-Americans were in California, Michigan, New York, Florida, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and [[Virginia]].

The cities with 100,000 or more in population with the highest percentages of Arabs are [[Sterling Heights, Michigan]] 3.69%; [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] 2.81%; [[Warren, Michigan]] 2.51%; [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]] 2.45%; [[Burbank, California]] 2.39% and nearby [[Glendale, California]] 2.07%; [[Livonia, Michigan]] 1.94%; [[Arlington, Virginia]] 1.77%; [[Paterson, New Jersey]] 1.77%; and [[Daly City, California]] 1.69%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=G.

==Religious background==
[[File:Arab American religions.png|thumb|The religious affiliations of Arab Americans]]
While the majority of the population of the [[Arab world]] is [[Islam|Muslim]], most Arab Americans, in contrast, are [[Christian]].&lt;ref name="aai"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaiusa.org/arab-americans/22/demographics|title=Arab Americans: Demographics|publisher=Arab American Institute|date=2006|accessdate=18 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601221810/http://www.aaiusa.org/arab-americans/22/demographics|archivedate=1 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Arab American Institute, the breakdown of religious affiliation among persons originating from Arab countries is as follows:
* 63% [[Christian]]
** 35% [[Catholicism|Catholic]] ([[Roman Rite]] Catholics and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholics]]&amp;nbsp;— [[Maronite Church|Maronites]] and [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkites]])
** 18% [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] ([[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] or [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]])
** 10% [[Protestant]]
* 24% [[Muslim]]
* 13% Other; no affiliation&lt;ref name="aai" /&gt;

The percentage of Arab Americans who are Muslim has increased in recent years because most new Arab immigrants tend to be Muslim. This stands in contrast to the first wave of Arab immigration to the United States between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when almost all immigrants were Christians. Most Maronites tend to be of Lebanese or Syrian; those Palestinians often [[Eastern Orthodox]], otherwise Roman Catholic and a few Episcopalians. A small number are [[Protestant]] adherents, either having joined a Protestant denomination after immigrating to the U.S. or being from a family that converted to Protestantism while still living in the Middle East (European and American Protestant missionaries were fairly commonplace in the Levant in the late 19th and early 20th centuries).

Arab Christians, especially from [[Lebanon]], [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], and [[Egypt]], continue to immigrate into the U.S. in the 2000s and continue to form new enclaves and communities across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/arab-christians-minorities-reshaping-us-enclaves-090951417.html|title=Arab Christians, minorities, reshaping US enclaves|date=11 November 2011|work=Yahoo News|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Census Bureau is presently finalizing the ethnic classification of MENA populations. This process does not pertain to [[Jews|Jewish]], [[Muslim]], [[Christian]], [[Sikh]] and other religious adherents, whom the bureau tabulates as followers of a religion rather than members of an ethnic group.&lt;ref name=MENA1&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 National Content Test|url=https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/programs-surveys/decennial/2020-census/2015_census_tests/nct/2015-nct-omb-package.pdf|pages=33–34|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|quote=The Census Bureau is undertaking related mid-decade research for coding and classifying detailed national origins and ethnic groups, and our consultations with external experts on the Asian community have also suggested Sikh receive a unique code classified under Asian.

USA Today. Published October 7, 2014. Accessed December 14, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Following consultations with MENA organizations, the Census Bureau announced in 2014 that it would establish a new MENA ethnic category for populations from the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and the [[Arab world]], separate from the "white" classification that these populations had previously sought in 1909. The expert groups, including some Jewish organizations, felt that the earlier "white" designation no longer accurately represents MENA identity, so they successfully lobbied for a distinct categorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Comments to NCT Federal Register Notice|url=https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/programs-surveys/decennial/2020-census/2015_census_tests/nct/2015-nct-frn.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau; Department of Commerce|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Debra Nussbaum|title=New U.S. Census Category to Include Israeli’ Option|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/features/.premium-1.661491|publisher=Haaretz|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2015, the sampling strata for the new MENA category includes the Census Bureau's working classification of 19 MENA groups, as well as [[Turkish American|Turkish]], [[Sudanese American|Sudanese]], [[Djiboutian American|Djiboutian]], [[Somali American|Somali]], [[Mauritanian American|Mauritanian]], [[Armenian Americans|Armenian]], [[Cypriot Americans|Cypriot]], [[Afghan Americans|Afghan]], [[Iranian Americans|Iranian]], [[Azerbaijani Americans|Azerbaijani]] and [[Georgian Americans|Georgian]] groups.&lt;ref name=MENA2&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 National Content Test|url=https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/programs-surveys/decennial/2020-census/2015_census_tests/nct/2015-nct-omb-package.pdf|page=60|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab American Institute and other groups have noted that there was a rise in [[hate crime]]s targeting the Arab American community as well as people perceived as Arab/Muslim after the [[September 11 attacks]] and the US-led [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, Amanda. "Rise in Hate Crimes Worries Arab-Americans" (Christian Science Monitor, April 10, 2003). [http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0410/p01s03-ussc.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

A new Zogby Poll International found that there are 3.5 million Americans who were identified as "Arab-Americans", or Americans of ancestry belonging to one of the 23 UN member countries of the Arab World (these are not necessarily therefore Arabs). Poll finds that, overall, a majority of those identifying as Arab Americans are [[Lebanese Americans]] (largely as a result of being the most numerous group).
The [[Paterson, New Jersey]]-based Arab American Civic Association runs an Arabic language program in the Paterson school district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/paterson-school-district-restarts-arab-language-program-for-city-youths-1.1149766|title=Paterson school district restarts Arab language program for city youths|publisher=Paterson Press, North Jersey Media Group|date=2014-12-10|accessdate=2014-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paterson, New Jersey has been nicknamed ''[[Little Ramallah]]'' and contains a neighborhood with the same name, with an Arab American population estimated as high as 20,000 in 2015.&lt;ref name="Deena Yellin"/&gt; Neighboring [[Clifton, New Jersey]] is following in Paterson's footsteps, with rapidly growing Arab, Muslim, and Palestinian American populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/hundreds-in-clifton-cheer-raising-of-palestinian-flag-1.1546953|title=Hundreds in Clifton cheer raising of Palestinian flag|author=Andrew Wyrich|publisher=North Jersey Media Group|date=2016-04-17|accessdate=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
In a 2007 Zogby poll, 62% of Arab Americans vote [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]], while only 25% vote [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commongroundnews.org/article.php?id=22587&amp;lan=en&amp;sid=1&amp;sp=0|title=US elections through Arab American eyes by Ghassan Rubeiz - Common Ground News Service|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The percentage of Arabs voting Democratic increased sharply during the [[Iraq War]].  However, a number of prominent Arab American politicians are Republicans, including former New Hampshire Senator [[John E. Sununu]], and California Congressman [[Darrell Issa]], who was the driving force behind the state's [[2003 California recall|2003 recall election]] that removed Democratic Governor [[Gray Davis]] from office.  The first woman [[Supreme Court Chief Justice]] in Florida, [[Rosemary Barkett]], who is of Syrian descent, is known for her dedication to progressive values.

Arab Americans gave [[George W. Bush]] a majority of their votes in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]]. However, they backed [[John Kerry]] in [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]] and [[Barack Obama]] in both [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]] and [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012]]. They also backed [[Hillary Clinton]] in [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016]].

According to a 2000 Zogby poll, 52% of Arab Americans are [[pro-life]], 74% support the [[death penalty]], 76% are in favor of stricter [[gun control]], and 86% want to see an independent [[Palestinian state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allied-media.com/Arab-American/Arab%20american%20Demographics.htm|title=Arab american Demographics|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study, Arab Americans living in Detroit were found to have values more similar to that of the Arab world than those of the general population living in Detroit, on average, being more closely aligned to the strong traditional values and survival values. This was less the case when participants were secular, or belonged to second and subsequent generations.&lt;ref name="Group2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Detroit Arab American Study Group|title=Citizenship and Crisis: Arab Detroit After 9/11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Dgn9wqJVAEC&amp;pg=PA22|date=2 July 2009|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation|isbn=978-1-61044-613-6|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Arab Americans from Arab countries==
There are many U.S. immigrants from the [[Arab world]] who are not classified as Arabs. Among these are [[Armenian Americans]], [[Kurdish Americans]] and [[American Jews|Jewish Americans]] of [[Mizrahi Jew|Mizrahi]] origin. Some of these groups such as Assyrians and Chaldeans are Semites, while the vast majority of the rest are not Semites. It is very difficult to estimate the size of these communities. For example, some Armenians immigrated to the U.S. from Lebanon, Syria, or Iraq. Estimates place these communities at least in the tens of thousands.&lt;ref name="American Community Survey"&gt;{{cite web|title=Total ancestry categories tallied for people with one or more ancestry categories reported 2011 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates|url=https://archive.org/details/2011AmericanCommunitySurveyAncestry|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"2006–2010 American Community Survey Selected Population Tables". Government of the United States of America. Government of the United States of America. Retrieved 5 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ben-Ur|first1=Aviva|title=Sephardic Jews in America: A Diasporic History|date=2009|publisher=NYU Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814786321|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other smaller communities include [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] (a.k.a. [[Chaldo-Assyrians]]), [[Berbers]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], [[Mandeans]], [[Circassians]], [[Shabaki]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Mhallami]], [[Georgian people|Georgians]], [[Yazidi]]s, [[Balochs]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]], [[Azerbaijan]]s and [[Kawliya]]/[[Romani people|Roma]].

Most of these ethnic groups speak their own native languages (usually another Semitic language related to Arabic) and have their own customs, along with the Arabic dialect from the Arab country they originate from. Aviva Uri, in her study of Mizrahi Jews in America, writes that "activists and writers in the United States, both [[gentile]] Arab and Jewish, are legitimizing through their various activities and publications the identity of Mizrahim as Arab Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ben-Ur|first1=Aviva|title=Sephardic Jews in America: A Disasporic History|date=2009|publisher=NYU Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814786321|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arab American Heritage Month==
In 2014, [[Montgomery County, Maryland]] designated April as Arab American Heritage Month in recognition of the contributions that Arab Americans have made to the nation.&lt;ref name="Mcaiaahm"&gt;{{cite web|title=April is Arab American Heritage Month|url=http://insidemc.montgomerycollege.edu/details.php?id=53294|publisher=Montgomery College|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first documentary on Arab Americans premiered on [[PBS]] in August of 2017, [[Arabamericandoc.com|The Arab Americans]] features the Arab American immigrant story as told through the lens of American History and the stories of prominent Arab Americans such as actor [[Jamie Farr]], [[Ralph Nader]], Senator [[George J. Mitchell|George Mitchell]], White House Reporter [[Helen Thomas]], Pulitzer Prize winning journalist [[Anthony Shadid]], [[Danny Thomas]] actor and Founder of [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]], pollster and author [[John Zogby]], Congressman [[Nick Rahall]], racing legend [[Bobby Rahal]]. The documentary is produced and directed by Abe Kasbo.

==Festivals==
While the spectrum of Arab heritage includes 22 countries, their combined heritage is often celebrated in cultural festivals around the United States.

;New York City
The Annual Arab-American &amp; North African Street Festival was founded in 2002 by the Network of Arab-American Professionals of NY (NAAP-NY).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naaponline.org/ny Network of Arab-American Professionals of NY (NAAP-NY)]&lt;/ref&gt; Located in downtown Manhattan, on Great Jones Street between Lafayette &amp; Broadway, the Festival attracts an estimated 15,000 people, in addition to over 30 Arab and North African vendors along with an all-day live cullltural performance program representing performers from across the Arab world.

The New York Arab-American Comedy Festival was founded in 2003 by comedian [[Dean Obeidallah]] and comedian [[Maysoon Zayid]]. Held annually each fall, the festival showcases the talents of Arab-American actors, comics, playwrights and filmmakers, and challenges as well as inspires fellow Arab-Americans to create outstanding works of comedy. Participants include actors, directors, writers and comedians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arab-American &amp; North African Cultural Street Festival 2017 in New York, NY {{!}} Everfest|url=https://www.everfest.com/e/arab-american-north-african-cultural-street-festival-new-york-ny|website=Everfest.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Seattle
Of particular note is ArabFest in [[Seattle]], begun in 1999. The festival includes all 22 of the Arab countries, with a [[souk]] marketplace, traditional and modern music, an authentic Arab coffeehouse, an Arabic spelling bee and fashion show. Lectures and workshops explore the rich culture and history of the Arab peoples, one of the world's oldest civilizations. Also of new interest is the Arabic rap concert, including the NW group Sons of Hagar, showcasing the political and creative struggle of Arabic youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Live At Seattle Center|url=http://seattlecenter.com/festal/detail.aspx?id=21|website=seattlecenter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20090304155803/http://baikal.arts.ualberta.ca/ Baikal Archaeology Project(BAP)] is an international team of scholars investigating Middle Holocene (about 9000 to 3000 years before present) hunter-gatherers of the [[Lake Baikal]]  region of Siberia, Russia. The Project focuses on long-term patterns of culture change in the context of dynamic interactions with the environment. The '''Baikal Archaeology Project''' is based at the University of Alberta with Irkutsk State University being its main research partner on the Russian side. Other institutional collaborators of the project have included the University of Calgary, University of Saskatchewan, Grant MacEwan University, [[British Columbia Institute of Technology]], University of Pennsylvania, University of California-Davis, Cambridge University, Oxford University, University College London, University of Aberdeen, and Institutes of Geochemistry and Earth’s Crust, Russian Academy of Sciences in Irkutsk and Irkutsk State Technical University in Russia. The Baikal Archaeology Project has been extensively funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. [[File:BaikalArchFigure1Siberia.jpg|thumb|350px|right|alt=Map of Siberia|Map of Siberia]]

==Project history==
[[File:Basovo profiles Dustin White.JPG|thumb|right|Excavation stratigraphic profiles]]Archaeological research of the Lake Baikal region’s Middle Holocene hunter-gatherers began during the second half of the 19th century and was followed by a long period of intensive research conducted during the Soviet period by researchers such as [[Alexey Okladnikov|Alexei Pavlovich Okladnikov]]. The Baikal Archaeology Project was formed in the mid-1990s during the time of profound political, social, and economic changes in Russia. Since then, the Baikal Archaeology Project launched an extensive multidisciplinary investigation of Middle Holocene hunter-gatherers of the Baikal region. The research model involves both original fieldwork and the application of modern laboratory techniques to previously as well as recently excavated collections of archaeological materials. Much of this work is facilitated by the presence of prehistoric cemeteries with well-preserved human remains – an unusual hunter-gatherer characteristic from a global perspective. Employing many advanced research methods and the integration of diverse lines of evidence generated by mortuary [[archaeology]], [[zooarchaeology]], [[radiocarbon dating]], [[Osteology|human osteology]], [[isotope geochemistry]], [[Ancient DNA|ancient]] and [[DNA|modern]] DNA research, [[ethnoarchaeology]], and [[Paleoclimatology|paleoclimatic]] and [[environmental studies]], the project aims to achieve an improved understanding of the cultural complexity, variability, and dynamics of the long-term culture change among past boreal foragers in the Baikal region.&lt;ref name="Weber and McKenzie 2003"&gt;'''Weber, A.W., McKenzie, H.G.'''

The Middle Holocene archaeology of the Baikal region is attractive particularly owing to its wealth of well-preserved cemeteries as well as the availability of stratified habitation sites. The region also invites attention because of a unique pattern of culture change in which two periods of increased social complexity, as evidenced by large numbers of formal cemeteries dating to the Early Neolithic and the Late Neolithic–Bronze Age, are separated by a millennium-long Middle Neolithic period during which mortuary sites are entirely absent. [[File:BaikalArchTable1.jpg|600px|left|alt=Table showing the culture history model for Cis-Baikal middle Holocene|Culture history model for Cis-Baikal middle Holocene]]

The first period of social complexity is associated with the Early Neolithic Kitoi culture, while the second period relates to the Late Neolithic and Bronze Age Isakovo, Serovo, and Glazkovo cultures, respectively. Since most of the current knowledge about the region’s Middle Holocene prehistory has been derived from examination of cemeteries, the Middle Neolithic, which lacks mortuary sites, does not enjoy the same level of archaeological identity as the preceding and following periods. Thus, it has often been referred to as the period of hiatus or discontinuity in the use of formal cemeteries.

Results from this research demonstrate that the discontinuity existed for as much as 1200 years and that the Early Neolithic and Late Neolithic–Bronze Age groups, which lived in the area on either side of this hiatus, were genetically dissimilar. Further differences between these pre- and post-hiatus groups are noted with regard to dietary preferences, subsistence and land use patterns, population size and distribution, social and political relations, and worldviews. Climate and environmental change in the region also seems to coincide with this period of discontinuity.

The two main research goals the Baikal Archaeology Project are:

(1)	To ''define'' the biocultural and environmental parameters of the middle Holocene hunter-gatherer adaptations; and
(2)	To ''explain'' the documented spatial and temporal cultural variability.

The work of the Baikal Archaeology Project is organized within five research modules – Archaeology, Human Bioarchaeology, Human Genetics, Ethnoarchaeology, and Paleoenvironment – each addressing the Project’s general objectives with a different, but complementary, methodology. The Archaeology, Human Bioarchaeology, and Human Genetics modules supply the primary data on the Middle Holocene hunter-gatherers, while the Paleoenvironment and Ethnoarchaeology modules provide a broad interpretive framework for the bioarchaeological data.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20090302032009/http://baikal.arts.ualberta.ca/about/archaeological.php Archaeology Module] examines development, use, and spatial organization of the region’s numerous hunter-gatherer cemeteries, mortuary protocols, social and political organization, migrations and mobility patterns, as well as the overall spatiotemporal variability in hunter-gatherer adaptations.&lt;ref name="Bazaliiskii and Savel'ev 2003"&gt;[http://antiquity.ac.uk/ant/077/Ant0770020.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121223050602/http://antiquity.ac.uk/ant/077/Ant0770020.htm |date=2012-12-23 }}, '''Bazaliiskii, V.

Researchers of the Archaeology, Paleoenvironment, and Ethnoarchaeology modules have conducted intensive fieldwork in many locations around Lake Baikal. Archaeologists excavated the cemeteries of Shamanka, Khuzhir-Nuge XIV, and Kurma XI, all located on the shores of Lake Baikal. This work expanded the existing collection of Middle Holocene burials in the region by c. 300 individuals, thus creating new research opportunities. Excavations were also carried out at the stratified habitation sites of Gorelyi Les in the Angara valley and Sagan-Zaba and Bugul’deika coves on Lake Baikal, providing archaeological data covering the entire Holocene. In conjunction with these excavations, the Baikal Archaeology Project organized archaeological field schools which attracted participants from Russia, Canada, USA, United Kingdom, and Poland.

This work involved detailed examination of Holocene lake core records (pollen, diatom and macrofossils) and stratified floodplain sediments for high resolution paleoenvironmental reconstructions.

The Ethnoarchaeology module organized field research with Evenki and Sakha hunters and reindeer herders at sites in the Bodaibo District (Irkutsk oblast’), Zhuia River Valley, Severobaikalsk District (Buriat Republic), and villages of Essei and Olenok.  This fieldwork is designed to provide the Baikal Archaeology Project with modern examples of subsistence action in specific lacustrian and riverine landscapes, characteristic also of the Middle Holocene hunter-gatherer groups.

==Dissemination==
The Baikal Archaeology Project has organized three international conferences (in Canada, Russia and Scotland), several conference sessions, and dozens of workshops and seminars. Project scholars and graduate students have produced numerous journalism papers, doctoral dissertations and masters’ theses, as well as five monographs under its Northern Hunter-Gatherers Research Series, published by [https://web.archive.org/web/20090804022325/http://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/polar/ Canadian Circumpolar Institute Press], University of Alberta.

Marriage is the legally or formally recognized intimate and complementing union of two people as spousal partners in a personal relationship (historically and in most jurisdictions specifically a union between a man and a woman).

The basic elements of a marriage are: (1)&amp;nbsp;the parties' legal ability to marry each other, (2)&amp;nbsp;mutual consent of the parties, and (3)&amp;nbsp;a marriage contract as required by law.

In [[Christianity|Christian]] [[marriage]], the union between a man and a woman is instituted and ordained by [[God in Christianity|God]] as the lifelong relationship between one man as [[husband]], and one woman as [[wife]]. The Apostle Paul gave a similar directive when he wrote, "Let marriage be held in honour among all".{{Bibleref2c|Heb.|13:4}} Conservative Christians consider marriage as the [[eros|most intimate]] of human relationships, a gift from God, and a sacred institution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.focusonthefamily.com/marriage/gods-design-for-marriage/honoring-marriage. Accessed 15 Jan. 2018&lt;/ref&gt; [[Protestantism|Protestants]] consider it to be sacred, holy, and central to the community of faith. [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christians]] consider marriage a [[Sacrament]].

Though it is presumed that [[Jesus]] never married, He taught the importance and sacredness of lifelong marriage. He quoted from both Genesis&amp;nbsp;1 and 2{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|19:3-5|9}} that God had created humanity as male and female,{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|1:27|9}} and that in marriage "the two become one flesh".{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|2:24|9}} Then He added: "So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate".{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|19:6|9}}

While marriage is honored throughout the Bible and affirmed among Christians, there is no suggestion that it is necessary for everyone. Single people, who either have chosen to remain unmarried or who have [[Widowhood#Terminology|lost their spouse]], are neither incomplete in Christ nor personal failures.&lt;ref name="Staggs"&gt;{{citation |last1=Stagg |first1=Evelyn |author1-link=Evelyn Stagg |first2=Frank |last2=Stagg |author2-link=Frank Stagg (theologian) |title=[[Woman in the World of Jesus]] |place=Philadelphia |publisher=Westminster |year=1978 |isbn=0-664-24195-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Christians seek to uphold the seriousness of wedding vows. Yet, they respond with compassion to deep hurts by recognizing that [[divorce]], though less than the ideal, is sometimes necessary to relieve one partner of intolerable hardship, unfaithfulness or desertion.&lt;ref name="Staggs"/&gt; While the voice of God had said, "I hate divorce",{{Bibleref2c|Malachi|2:16}} some authorities believe the divorce rate in the church is nearly comparable to that of the culture at large.&lt;ref name=Desai&gt;Amy Desai, J.D. [http://www.focusonthefamily.com/marriage/divorce_and_infidelity/should_i_get_a_divorce/how_should_a_christian_view_marriage_and_divorce.aspx How Should a Christian View Marriage and Divorce?] Accessed 15 Jan. 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians today hold three competing views as to what is the biblically-ordained relationship between husband and wife. These views range from [[Christian egalitarianism]] that interprets the New Testament as teaching complete ''equality of authority and responsibility'' between the man and woman in marriage, all the way to [[Patriarchy]] that calls for a “return to complete patriarchy” in which relationships are based on male-dominant power and authority in marriage:&lt;ref name=Patriarchy/&gt;

1. [[Christian egalitarianism|Christian Egalitarians]] believe in an equal partnership of the wife and husband with neither being designated as the leader in the marriage or family. Instead, the wife and husband share a fully ''equal partnership'' in both their marriage and in the family. Its proponents teach "the fundamental biblical principle of the equality of all human beings before God".

"There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus."{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|3:28}}

According to this principle, there can be no moral or theological justification for permanently granting or denying status, privilege, or prerogative solely on the basis of a person's race, class, or gender.&lt;ref name=Groothuis&gt;Groothuis, Rebecca M. "Sexuality, Spirituality and Feminist Religion".

2. [[Complementarianism|Christian Complementarians]] prescribe husband-headship—a male-led hierarchy. This view's core beliefs call for a husband’s “loving, humble headship" and the wife’s "intelligent, willing submission" to his headship. Without necessarily using the term "obey", they believe women have "different but complementary roles and responsibilities in marriage".&lt;ref name=Comp&gt;Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood (CBMW). Core Beliefs. {{cite web |url=https://www.cbmw.org/core-beliefs/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206132921/https://www.cbmw.org/core-beliefs/ |archivedate=2013-02-06 |df= }} Accessed 5 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

3. [[Biblical patriarchy]], though not at all popular among mainstream Christians, prescribes a strict male-dominant hierarchy. This view makes the husband the “ruler” over "his" wife and “his” household.&lt;ref&gt;https://cbmw.org/uncategorized/summaries-of-the-egalitarian-and-complementarian-positions; 1/15/2018/&lt;/ref&gt; Their organization's first tenet is that "God reveals Himself as masculine, not feminine. God is the eternal Father and the eternal Son, the Holy Spirit is also addressed as 'He,' and Jesus Christ is a male". They consider the husband-father to be 'sovereign' over ''his'' household—the family leader, provider, and protector. They call for a wife to be ''obedient'' to her ''head'', (her husband).&lt;ref name=Patriarchy&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070626134919/http://www.visionforumministries.org/home/about/biblical_patriarchy.aspx "The Tenets of Biblical Patriarchy".

Some [[Polygamy in Christianity|Christian authorities used to permit]] [[polygamy]] (specifically [[polygyny]]) in the past, but this practice, besides being illegal in Western cultures, is now considered to be out of the Christian mainstream and continues to be practiced only by fringe fundamentalist sects.

==Family authority and responsibilities==

[[File:Pukirev ner brak.jpg|thumb|Orthodox betrothal depicted by [[Vasily Vladimirovich Pukirev]], 1862.]]

Much of the dispute hinges on how one interprets the [[New Testament Household Code]] ''(Haustafel)'' which has as its main focus hierarchical relationships between three pairs of social classes that were controlled by Roman law: husbands/wives, parents/children, and masters/slaves. The Code, with variations, occurs in four epistles (letters) by the [[Apostle Paul]] and in 1&amp;nbsp; Peter. The Roman law of ''Manus'' gave the husband nearly absolute autocratic power over his wife, including life and death. The law of ''Patria Potestas'' (Latin for "Rule of the Fathers") gave a husband equally severe power over his children and slaves. [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Theologian Frank Stagg]]&lt;ref name=Stagg&gt;Stagg, Frank. ''New Testament Theology''. Broadman Press, 1962. {{ISBN|0-8054-1613-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp.187ff}} finds the basic tenets of the Code in [[Aristotle]]'s discussion of the household in Book&amp;nbsp;1 of ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' and in [[Philo]]'s ''Hypothetica 7.14''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=

In a [[Tübingen]] dissertation,&lt;ref&gt;Crouch. James E. ''The Origin and Intention of the Colossian Haustafel.'' Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; by James E. Crouch concludes that the early Christians found in Hellenistic Judaism a code which they adapted and Christianized.

The Staggs believe the several occurrences of the [[New Testament Household Code]] in the Bible were intended to meet the needs for ''order'' within the churches and in the society of the day. They maintain that the New Testament Household Codes are attempts by Paul and Peter to Christianize the harsh Codes for Roman citizens who had become followers of Christ. The Staggs write that there is some suggestion in scripture that because Paul had taught that they had newly found freedom "in Christ", wives, children, and slaves were taking improper advantage of the ''Haustafel'' both in the home and the church. 
"The form of the code stressing reciprocal social duties is traced to Judaism's own Oriental background, with its strong moral/ethical demand but also with a low view of woman.... At bottom is probably to be seen the perennial tension between freedom and order.... What mattered to (Paul) was 'a new creation'{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|6:15}} and 'in Christ' there is 'not any Jew not Greek, not any slave nor free, not any male and female'.{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|3:28}}&lt;ref name=Staggs/&gt;

Such codes existed in Greek tradition. Two of these Christianized codes are found in {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:21-33}} (which contains the phrases "husband is the head of the wife" and "wives, submit to your husband") and in {{Bibleref2|Colossians|3:18-4:1}}, which instructs wives to subordinate themselves to their husbands.

The importance of the meaning of "head" as used by the [[Apostle Paul]] is pivotal in the conflict between the Complementarian position and the Egalitarian view. The word Paul used for "head", transliterated from Greek, is ''kephalē''. Today's English word "cephalic" ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|f|æ|l|ᵻ|k}} {{Respell|sə|FAL|ik}}) stems from the Greek ''kephalē'' and means "Of or relating to the head; or located on, in, or near the head." A thorough concordance search by [[Catherine Kroeger]] shows that the most frequent use of "head" ''(kephalē)'' in the New Testament is to refer to "the anatomical head of a body". She found that its second most frequent use in the New Testament was to convey the metaphorical sense of "source".&lt;ref&gt;Kroeger, Catherine Clark. "Toward an Understanding of Ancient Conceptions of 'Head'". ''Priscilla Papers,'' Volume 20:3, Summer 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Alan F. "A Meta-Study of the Debate over the Meaning of 'Head' (Kephale) in Paul's Writings. ''Priscilla Papers, '' Volume 20:4, Autumn 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Other Egalitarian authors such as Margaret Howe agree with Kroeger, writing that "The word 'head' (in {{Bibleref2|1cor|11:3||1&amp;nbsp; Corinthians&amp;nbsp;11:3}} and other similar passages) must be understood not as 'ruler' but as 'source{{' "}}.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Howe, Women and Church Leadership (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1982), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wayne Grudem criticizes commonly rendering ''kephalē'' in those same passages only to mean "source", and argues that it denotes "authoritative head" in such texts as {{Bibleref2|1cor|11:3||1&amp;nbsp;Corinthians&amp;nbsp;11:3}}. They interpret that verse to mean that [[God the father]] is the authoritative head over the [[Jesus Christ|Son]], and in turn Jesus is the authoritative head over the church, not simply its source. By extension, they then conclude that in marriage and in the church, the man is the authoritative head over the woman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/tj/kephale_grudem.pdf Wayne Grudem, "Does Kefale ("Head") Mean "Source" Or "Authority Over" in Greek Literature? A Survey of 2,336 Examples"] Trinity Journal ns 6.1 (Spring 1985): 38-59&lt;/ref&gt;

Another potential way to define the word "head", and hence the relationship between husband and wife as found in Bible, is through the example given in the surrounding context in which the word is found.{{Bibleref2c|Eph.|5:20-33}} In that context the husband and wife are compared to Christ and his church. The context seems to imply an authority structure based on a man sacrificing himself for his wife, as Christ did for the church; a love-based authority structure, where submission is not required but freely given based on the care given to the wife.&lt;ref&gt;Wickstrom, Mark. ''The Gospel of Grace.'' Beaver Pond Press, 2008.{{ISBN|978-1-59298-232-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some biblical references on this subject are debated depending on one’s school of theology. The [[Historical-grammatical method|historical grammatical method]] is a [[Biblical hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] technique that strives to uncover the meaning of the text by taking into account not just the grammatical words, but also the syntactical aspects, the cultural and historical background, and the literary genre. Thus references to a patriarchal Biblical culture may or may not be relevant to other societies. What is believed to be a timeless truth to one person or denomination may be considered a cultural norm or minor opinion to another.

=== {{anchor|Egalitarian view}} Egalitarian view ===
{{See also|Christian egalitarianism}}

Christian Egalitarians (from the French word "égal" meaning "equal") believe that Christian marriage is intended to be a marriage without any hierarchy—a full and equal partnership between the wife and husband. They emphasize that nowhere in the New Testament is there a requirement for a wife to ''obey'' her husband. While "obey" was introduced into marriage vows for much of the church during the Middle Ages, its only New Testament support is found in {{Bibleref2|1pet|3:6||1&amp;nbsp;Peter&amp;nbsp;3:6}}, with that only being by implication from Sarah's obedience to Abraham.&lt;ref name="Staggs"/&gt;{{rp|p.190}} Scriptures such as {{Bibleref2|Galatians|3:28}} state that in Christ, right relationships are restored and in him, "there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female."&lt;ref name=CBE&gt;Christians for Biblical Equality. "Men, Women and Biblical Equality". Ltd. CBE on the Web at "Biblical Equality", 1989. [www.cbeinternational.org/?q=content/men-women-and-biblical-equality.] Accessed 5 Mar 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Egalitarians interpret scripture to mean that God intended spouses to practice ''mutual submission'', each in equality with the other. The phrase "mutual submission" comes from a verse in {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:21}} which precedes advice for the three domestic relationships of the day, including slavery. It reads, "Submit to one another ('mutual submission') out of reverence for Christ", wives to husbands, children to parents, and slaves to their master. Christian Egalitarians believe that full partnership in marriage is the most biblical view, producing the most intimate, wholesome, and reciprocally fulfilling marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Aída Besançon, William Spencer. ''Marriage at the Crossroads''. InterVarsity Press, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-8308-2890-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian Egalitarian view&lt;ref&gt;Christian Egalitarian view as differentiated from humanistic egalitarianism&lt;/ref&gt; of marriage asserts that gender, in and of itself, neither privileges nor curtails a believer's gifting or calling to any ministry in the church or home. It does not imply that [[women]] and [[men]] are identical or undifferentiated, but affirms that God designed men and women to complement and benefit one another.&lt;ref name=Groothuis2&gt;Groothuis, Rebecca Merrill. "The Bible and Gender Equality." [www.cbeinternational.org Christians for Biblical Equality Web site]&lt;/ref&gt; A foundational belief of Christian Egalitarians is that the husband and wife are created equally and are ordained of God to "become one", a biblical principle first ordained by God in {{Bibleref2|Genesis|2:24}}, reaffirmed by Jesus in {{Bibleref2|Matthew|19:4-6}} and {{Bibleref2|Mark|10:6-8}}, and by the [[Apostle Paul]] in {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:30-32}}. Therefore, they see that "oneness" as pointing to [[gender equality]] in marriage. They believe the biblical model for Christian marriages is therefore for the spouses to share equal responsibility within the family—not one over the other nor one under the other.

David Dykes, theologian, author, and pastor of a 15,000-member Baptist church, sermonized that "When you are in Christ, you have full equality with all other believers". In a sermon he entitled "The Ground Is Level at the Foot of the Cross", he said that some theologians have called one particular Bible verse the Christian ''[[Magna Carta]]''. The Bible verse reads: "There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus." ({{Bibleref2|Galatians|3:28|NIV}}). Acknowledging the differences between men and women, Dykes writes that "in Christ, these differences don't define who we are. The only category that really matters in the world is whether you are '''in Christ'''. At the cross, Jesus destroyed all the made-made{{Clarification|date=August 2018}} barriers of hostility:" ethnicity, social status, and gender.&lt;ref&gt;Dykes, David O. "[http://www.preaching.com/sermons/11682921/page-3/ The Ground Is Level at the Foot of the Cross]". (Senior Pastor of Green Acres Baptist Church in Tyler, Texas)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The {{Bibleref2|Galatians|3:28}} passage comes after the apostle Paul tells us he would not submit to what was "hypocritical" to the Gospel.{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|2:1-14}} The apostle Peter had affirmed the truth of the Gospel regarding the Gentiles with his words, but his actions compromised it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbeinternational.org/?q=content/2013-02-28-preparing-womens-history-month-arise-e-newsletter Quient, Allison.

Those of the egalitarian persuasion point to the biblical instruction that all Christian believers, irrespective of gender, are to submit or be subject "to one another in the fear of God"{{Bibleref2c|Eph.|5:21|KJV|Eph.&amp;nbsp;5:21&amp;nbsp;KJV}} or "out of reverence for Christ".{{Bibleref2c|Eph.|5:21|NIV|NIV}} [[Gilbert Bilezikian]] writes that in the highly debated Ephesians&amp;nbsp;5 passage, the verb "to be subject" or "to be submitted" appears in verse&amp;nbsp;21 which he describes as serving as a "hinge" between two different sections. The first section consists of verses 18-20, verse 21 is the connection between the two, and the second section consists of verses 22-33.&lt;ref name=Bilezikian&gt;Bilezikian, Gilbert. ''Beyond Sex Roles.'' Baker Book House, 1989. {{ISBN|0-8010-0885-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.153}} When discussion begins at verse 22 in Ephesians&amp;nbsp;5, Paul appears to be reaffirming a chain of command principle within the family. However,

{{Quotation|...when interpretation begins with verse 21, the entire passage describes mutual submission within the family. The wife submits to her husband in everything "as unto the Lord." If her husband makes a request unworthy of her Lord, her primary loyalty is "unto the Lord." ...Instruction about submission is four times longer for husbands than for wives. The greatest burden of submission is clearly placed on the husband.&lt;ref name=Prescott&gt;Prescott, Bruce. "The Christian Family: Mutual Submission or Chain of Command?" ''Mainstream Messenger'', Vol. 1, No. 3. November 1998. Online: http://www.mainstreambaptists.org/mob2/family.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Advocates of [[Christian egalitarianism]] believe that this model has firm biblical support:
*The word translated "help" or "helper" in {{bibleref2|Genesis|2:18}} until quite recently was generally understood to subordinate a wife to her husband. The KJV translates it as God saying, "I will make a help meet for him". The first distortion was extrabiblical: the noun "help" and the adjective "meet" traditionally have been combined into a new noun, "helpmate". Thus, wives were often referred to as her husband's "helpmate". Next, from the word "help" were drawn inferences of authority/subjection distinctions between men and women. "Helper" was taken to mean that husband was boss and wife his domestic. It is now realized that of the 21 times the Hebrew word 'ezer is used in the Old Testament, in eight of those instances the term clearly means "savior"—another word for Jehovah God. For example, {{Bibleref2|Psalm|33:20}} says "the Lord…is our help ('ezer) and shield". {{Bibleref2|Psalm|121:1-2}} reads "I lift up my eyes to the mountains—where does my help ('ezer) come from? My help ('ezer) comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth." That Hebrew word is not used in the Bible with reference to any subordinate person such a servant.&lt;ref name=Bilezikian/&gt;{{rp|p.28}} Thus, forms of 'ezer in the Hebrew Bible can mean either "to save" or "to be strong" or have the idea of power and strength.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, R. David. ''Biblical Archaeology Review''. Jan/Feb 1983, pp. 56-58&lt;/ref&gt;
*The "two becoming one" concept, first cited in {{bibleref2|Gen.|2:24}}, was quoted by Jesus in his teachings on marriage and recorded almost identically in the gospels of both Matthew and Mark.{{bibleref2c|Matt.|19:4–6}} {{bibleref2c|Mk.|10:7–9}} In those passages Jesus reemphasized the concept by adding a divine postscript to the Genesis passage: "So, they are no longer two, but one" (NIV).
*The Apostle Paul also quoted the Genesis 2:24 passage in {{bibleref2|Ephesians|5:1}}&lt;ref name="Staggs"/&gt; Describing it as a "profound mystery", he analogizes it to "Christ and the church".{{Bibleref2c|Eph.|5:32}} Then Paul states that every husband must love his wife as he loves himself.{{Bibleref2c-nb|Eph.|5:33}}
*Jesus actually ''forbids'' any hierarchy of relationships in Christian relationships. All three [[synoptic gospels]] record virtually the same teaching of Jesus, adding to its apparent significance:&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Clive, Steve Moyise. ''Jesus and the Gospels.'' Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006. {{ISBN|0-567-04073-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{bibleref2c|Matt.|20:25–26||Matt.&amp;nbsp;20:25–26a}} {{bibleref2c|Mark|10:42-45}} {{bibleref2c|Luke|22:25-27}}
*The [[Apostle Paul]] calls on husbands and wives to be subject ''to each other'' out of reverence for Christ—mutual submission.{{bibleref2c|Eph.|5:21}}
*As persons, husband and wife are of equal value. There is no priority of one spouse over the other. In truth, they are one.&lt;ref name="Staggs" /&gt; Bible scholar [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Frank Stagg]] and Classicist [[Evelyn Stagg]] write that husband-wife equality produces the most intimate, wholesome and mutually fulfilling marriages.

Eerdmans, 1990, p. 142. {{ISBN|978-0-8028-1597-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recorded in {{bibleref2|Galatians|3:28}}, applies to all Christian relationships, including Christian marriage: "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is ''neither male nor female'': for you are all ''one'' in Christ Jesus."
*The Apostle Peter calls husbands and wives "joint heirs of the grace of life" and cautions a husband who is not considerate to his wife and does not treat her with respect that his prayers will be hindered.{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|3:7||1&amp;nbsp;Peter&amp;nbsp;3:7}}

*Among spouses, it is possible to submit without love, but it is impossible to love without submitting mutually to each other.{{Bibleref2c|Col.|3:8-9}}

The egalitarian paradigm leaves it up to the couple to decide who is responsible for what task or function in the home. Such decisions should be made rationally and wisely,{{Bibleref2c|Eph|5:15}} not based on gender or tradition. Examples of a couple's decision logic might include:
*which spouse is ''more competent'' for a particular task or function;
*which has ''better access'' to it;
*or if they decide both are similarly competent and have comparable access, they might make the decision based on who ''prefers'' that function or task, or conversely, which of them ''dislikes it less'' than the other. The egalitarian view holds that decisions about managing family responsibilities are made rationally through cooperation and negotiation, not on the basis of tradition (e.g., "man's work" or "woman's" work), nor any other irrelevant or irrational basis.&lt;ref name="UMC"&gt;{{cite web

Complementarians hold to a hierarchical structure between husband and wife. They believe men and women have different gender-specific roles that allow each to ''complement'' the other, hence the designation "Complementarians". The Complementarian view of marriage holds that while the husband and wife are of equal worth before God, husbands and wives are given different functions and responsibilities by God that are based on gender, and that male leadership is biblically ordained so that the husband is always the senior authority figure. They state they "observe with deep concern" "accompanying distortions or neglect of the glad harmony portrayed in Scripture between the intelligent, humble leadership of redeemed husbands and the loving, willing support of that leadership by redeemed wives".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbmw.org/core-beliefs/ Core Beliefs{{snd}} the "Danvers Statement"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626082957/http://cbmw.org/core-beliefs/ |date=2014-06-26 }}.

Scriptures such as 1 Corinthians 11:3: "But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God", (KJV) are understood as meaning the wife is to be subject to her husband, if not unconditionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galaxie.com/article/jbmw16-2-12 Meyer, Jason C..

[[Roman Catholic Church]] teaching on the role of women includes that of Pope Leo XIII in his 1880 encyclical ''Arcanum'' which states:
{{Quotation|The husband is the chief of the family and the head of the wife. The woman, because she is flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone, must be subject to her husband and obey him; not, indeed, as a servant, but as a companion, so that her obedience shall be wanting in neither honor nor dignity. Since the husband represents Christ, and since the wife represents the Church, let there always be, both in him who commands and in her who obeys, a heaven-born love guiding both in their respective duties."&lt;ref&gt;Pope Leo XIII Encyclical 1880 Arcanum {{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_10021880_arcanum_en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622095840/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_10021880_arcanum_en.html |archivedate=2009-06-22 |df= }} 1880 Arcanum]&lt;/ref&gt; This position was affirmed in the 1930 encyclical ''Casti Connubii,'' which invokes {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:22}}, "Let women be subject to their husbands as to the Lord, because the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ is the head of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_31121930_casti-connubii_en.html, Pope Pius XI, Casti Connubii]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though each of their churches is autonomous and self-governed, the official position of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] (the largest Protestant denomination in the United States) is:
{{Quotation|The husband and wife are of equal worth before God, since both are created in God's image. A husband is to love his wife as Christ loved the church. He has the God-given responsibility to provide for, to protect, and to lead his family. A wife is to submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband even as the church willingly submits to the headship of Christ. She, being in the image of God as is her husband and thus equal to him, has the God-given responsibility to respect her husband and to serve as his helper in managing the household and nurturing the next generation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/basicbeliefs.asp Southern Baptist Convention, Basic Beliefs] 2013&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Biblical patriarchy===
{{see also|Biblical patriarchy|Pater familias}}

The patriarchal model of marriage is clearly the oldest one. It characterized the theological understanding of most Old Testament writers. It mandates the supremacy, at times the ultimate domination, of the husband-father in the family. In the first century Roman Empire, in the time of Jesus, Paul, and Peter, it was the law of the land and gave the husband absolute authority over his wife, children, and slaves—even the power of life or death. It subordinates all women.

Biblical patriarchy is similar to [[Complementarianism]] but with differences of degree and emphasis. Biblical patriarchists carry the husband-headship model considerably further and with more militancy. While Complementarians also hold to exclusively male leadership in both the home and the church, Biblical patriarchy extends that exclusion to the civic sphere as well, so that women should not be civil leaders&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforumministries.org/issues/ballot_box/should_christians_support_a_wo.aspx Should Christians Support a Woman for the Office of Civil Magistrate?].&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed should not have careers outside the home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforumministries.org/issues/family/called_to_the_home_called_to_r.aspx Called to the Home — Called to Rule].&lt;/ref&gt;

Patriarchy is based on authoritarianism—complete obedience or subjection to male authority as opposed to individual freedom. Patriarchy gives preeminence to the male in essentially all matters of religion and culture. It explicitly deprives all women of social, political, and economic rights. The marriage relationship simply reinforced this dominance of women by men, providing religious, cultural, and legal structures that clearly favor patriarchy to the exclusion of even basic human dignity for wives.&lt;ref name=Patriarchy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Are “The Tenets of Biblical Patriarchy” Biblical? Part 1". {{cite web |url=http://rethinkingvisionforum.org/2011/08/11/are-%E2%80%9Cthe-biblical-tenets-of-patriarchy%E2%80%9D-biblical-part-1/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114657/http://rethinkingvisionforum.org/2011/08/11/are-%E2%80%9Cthe-biblical-tenets-of-patriarchy%E2%80%9D-biblical-part-1/ |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }} 16 Mar 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically in classical patriarchy, the wives and children were always legally dependent upon the father, as were the slaves and other servants. It was the way of life throughout most of the Old Testament, religiously, legally, and culturally. However, it was not unique to Hebrew thought. With only minor variations, it characterized virtually every pagan culture of that day—including all Pre-Christian doctrine and practice.&lt;ref name=Patriarchy/&gt;

While Scripture allowed this approach in Old Testament times, nowhere does the Bible ordain it. In the Hebrew nation, patriarchy seems to have evolved as an expression of male dominance and supremacy, and of a double standard that prevailed throughout much of the Old Testament. Its contemporary advocates insist that it is the only biblically valid model for marriage today. They argue that it was established at Creation, and thus is a firm, unalterable decree of God about the relative positions of men and women.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/446579/patria-potestas]&lt;/ref&gt;

Biblical patriarchists see what they describe as a crisis of this era being what they term to be a systematic attack on the "timeless truths of biblical patriarchy". They believe such an attack includes the movement to "subvert the biblical model of the family, and redefine the very meaning of fatherhood and motherhood, masculinity, femininity, and the parent and child relationship."&lt;ref name=Patriarchy/&gt; Arguing from the biblical presentation of God revealing himself "as masculine, not feminine", they believe God ordained distinct gender roles for man and woman as part of the created order. They say "Adam’s headship over Eve was established at the beginning, before sin entered the world". Their view is that the male has God-given authority and mandate to direct "his" household in paths of obedience to God. They refer to man's "dominion" beginning within the home, and a man’s qualification to lead and ability to lead well in the public square is based upon his prior success in ''ruling his household''.&lt;ref name=Patriarchy/&gt;

Thus, William Einwechter refers to the traditional Complementarian view as "two-point Complementarianism" (male leadership in the family and church), and regards the biblical patriarchy view as "three-point" or "full" complementarianism (male leadership in family, church ''and society'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforumministries.org/issues/family/men_and_women_and_the_creation.aspx Men and Women and the Creation Order, Part 1 - Vision Forum Ministries]&lt;/ref&gt;

The patriarchists teach that "the woman was created as a helper to her husband, as the bearer of children, and as a "keeper at home", concluding that the God-ordained and proper sphere of dominion for a wife is the household. Biblical patriarchists consider that "faithfulness to Christ requires that (Biblical patriarchy) be believed, taught, and lived". They claim that the "man is...the image and glory of God in terms of authority, while the woman is the glory of man". They teach that a wife is to be ''obedient'' to her "head" (husband), based upon [[Old Testament]] teachings and models.

==Biblical foundations and history==

Christians believe that marriage is considered in its ideal according to the purpose of [[God in Christianity|God]]. At the heart of God's design for marriage is companionship and intimacy.

The biblical picture of marriage expands into something much broader, with the husband and wife relationship illustrating the relationship between [[Bride of Christ|Christ and the church]].

It is also considered in its actual occurrence, sometimes involving failure. Therefore, the Bible speaks on the subject of [[divorce]].&lt;ref name="Staggs" /&gt; The New Testament recognizes a place for singleness. [[Salvation]] within Christianity is not dependent on the continuation of a biological lineage.&lt;ref name="EOC" /&gt;

[[Polygyny]], or men having multiple wives at once, is one of the most common marital arrangements represented in the Old Testament,&lt;ref name="JewEncMar"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=marriage|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=M&amp;artid=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet scholars doubt that it was common among average Israelites because of the wealth needed to practice it.&lt;ref&gt;Gene McAfee [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t120.e0669 "Sex"] The Oxford Companion to the Bible. Bruce M. Metzger and Michael D. Coogan, eds. Oxford University Press Inc. 1993. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. 19 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[biblical patriarchs]] and [[kings of Israel]] are described as engaged in polygamous relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dale Martin]] [https://vimeo.com/8581466 lecture].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Betrothal]] (''[[erusin]]''), which is merely a binding promise to get married, is distinct from marriage itself (''[[nissuin|nissu'in]]''), with the time between these events varying substantially.&lt;ref name="JewEncMar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar"&gt;{{EncyclopaediaBiblica|article=Marriage|section=Manius-Mash}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a wife was regarded as property in biblical times, the betrothal (''erusin'') was effected simply by purchasing her from her father (or [[parental guardian|guardian]]);&lt;ref name="JewEncMar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar" /&gt; the girl’s consent is not explicitly required by any biblical law.&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar" /&gt;

Like the adjacent Arabic culture ([[Pre-Islamic Arabia|in the pre-Islamic period]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[William Robertson Smith]], ''Kinship and Marriage in early Arabia'', (1885), 81&lt;/ref&gt; the act of marriage appears mainly to have consisted of the groom fetching the bride, although among the [[Israelites]] (unlike the Arabs) the procession was a festive occasion, accompanied by music, dancing, and lights.&lt;ref name="JewEncMar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar" /&gt; To celebrate the marriage, week-long feasts were sometimes held.&lt;ref name="JewEncMar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar" /&gt;

In Old Testament times, a wife was regarded as [[Personal property|chattel]], belonging to her husband.&lt;ref name="JewEncMar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar" /&gt; The descriptions of the Bible suggest that she would be expected to perform tasks such as spinning, sewing, weaving, manufacture of clothing, fetching of water, baking of bread, and [[animal husbandry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Genesis|29:9}}; {{bibleref2|Exodus|2:16}};{{Bibleref2|1|Samuel|2:19||1 Samuel 2:19}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Sam|8:13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, wives were usually looked after with care, and [[bigamy|bigamous]] men were expected to ensure that they give their first wife food, clothing, and sexual activity.{{bibleref2c|Ex|21:10}}

Since a wife was regarded as property, her husband was originally free to divorce her for any reason, at any time.&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar" /&gt; A divorced couple could get back together unless the wife had married someone else after her divorce.{{bibleref2c|Deut|24:2–4}}

=== Jesus on marriage, divorce, and remarriage ===
[[File:Christian-Marriage-Symbol.svg|thumb|150px|Sometimes used as a [[symbol]] for Christian marriage: Two gold wedding rings interlinked with the Greek letters ''[[Chi (letter)|chi]]'' (X) and ''[[Rho (letter)|rho]]'' (P)—the first two letters in the Greek word for "Christ" (see [[Labarum]])]]

The Bible clearly addresses marriage and divorce. Those in troubled marriages are encouraged to seek counseling and restoration because most divorces are neither necessary nor unavoidable.&lt;ref name=Desai/&gt;

{{Quotation|"Have you not read that at the beginning the Creator made them male and female, and said, "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh"? So they ''are'' no longer two, but one. Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate."|{{Bibleref2|Matt.|19:4–6}}, {{Bibleref2|Mark|10:7–9}}}}

In both Matthew and Mark, Jesus appealed to God's will in creation. He builds upon the narratives in where male and female are created together{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|1:27}} and for one another.{{Bibleref2c-nb|Genesis|2:24}} Thus Jesus takes a firm stand on the permanence of marriage in the original will of God. This corresponds closely with the position of the Pharisee school of thought led by [[Shammai]], at the start of the first millennium,&lt;ref name="Git910"&gt;''[[Gittin]]'' 9:10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sotah]]'' ([[Jerusalem Talmud]] only), 1:1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sotah'' (Jerusalem Talmud only), 1:16b&lt;/ref&gt; with which Jesus would have been familiar. By contrast, [[Rabbinic Judaism]] subsequently took the opposite view, espoused by [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]], the leader of the other major Pharisee school of thought at the time; in Hillel's view, men were allowed to divorce their wives for any reason.&lt;ref name="Git910" /&gt;

Some hold that marriage vows are unbreakable, so that even in the distressing circumstances in which a couple separates, they are still married from God’s point of view. This is the Roman Catholic church’s position, although occasionally the church will declare a marriage to be “null” (in other words, it never really was a marriage).&lt;ref&gt;"Catechism of the Catholic Church - The sacrament of Matrimony". [www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a7.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; William Barclay (1907-1978) has written:
{{Quotation|There is no time in history when the marriage bond stood in greater peril of destruction than in the days when Christianity first came into this world. At that time the world was in danger of witnessing the almost total break-up of marriage and the collapse of the home…. Theoretically no nation ever had a higher ideal of marriage than the Jews had. The voice of God had said, "I hate divorce" (in {{Bibleref2|Malachi|2:16}})|William Barclay&lt;ref&gt;Barclay, William. ''The Gospel of Matthew''. Westminster John Knox Press, Rev Upd edition (December 1, 2001). {{ISBN|978-0664224912}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jesus brought together two passages from Genesis, reinforcing the basic position on marriage found in Jewish scripture. Thus, he implicitly emphasized that it is God-made ("God has joined together"), "male and female,"{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|1:27}} lifelong ("let no one separate"), and monogamous ("a man…his wife").&lt;ref name="Stagg NT"&gt;Stagg, Frank.''New Testament Theology''. Broadman, 1962. {{ISBN|0-8054-1613-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jesus]] used the image of marriage and the family to teach the basics about the [[Kingdom of God]]. He inaugurated his ministry by blessing the [[Marriage at Cana|wedding feast at Cana]]. In the [[Sermon on the Mount]] he set forth a new commandment concerning marriage, teaching that lustful looking constitutes [[adultery]].{{Bibleref2c|Mt.|5:28}} He also [[Supersessionism|superseded a Mosaic Law]] allowing divorce with his teaching that "…anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality (Gk. ''porneia''),&lt;ref&gt;Thayer and Smith. "Greek Lexicon entry for Porneia". ''The KJV New Testament Greek Lexicon''.&lt;/ref&gt; causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery".{{Bibleref2c|Mt|5:32||cf. Mt. 5:32}} {{Bibleref2c|Mt|19:19}} {{Bibleref2c|Mk|10:11}} {{Bibleref2c|Lk|16:18}} Similar Pauline teachings are found in {{Bibleref2|1cor|7:10–11|ESV|1&amp;nbsp;Corinthians 7:10–11}}. The exception clause—"except for…"—uses the Greek word ''porneia'' which is variously translated "fornication" (KJV), "marital unfaithfulness" (NIV 1984), "sexual immorality" (NIV 2011), "unchastity" (RSV), ''et&amp;nbsp;al''. ''The KJV New Testament Greek Lexicon, KJV'' says ''porneia'' includes a variety of sexual "deviations" to include "illicit sexual intercourse, adultery, fornication, homosexuality, lesbianism, intercourse with animals, etc., sexual intercourse with close relatives…."{{Bibleref2c|Lev.|18}}

[[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Theologian Frank Stagg]] says that manuscripts disagree as to the presence in the original text of the phrase "except for fornication".&lt;ref name="Stagg NT"/&gt;{{rp|pp.300–301}} Stagg writes: "Divorce always represents failure…a deviation from God's will…. There is grace and redemption where there is contrition and repentance…. There is no clear authorization in the New Testament for remarriage after divorce." Stagg interprets the chief concern of {{Bibleref2|Matthew|5:32}} as being "to condemn the criminal act of the man who divorces an innocent wife…. Jesus was rebuking the husband who victimizes an innocent wife and thinks that he makes it right with her by giving her a divorce". He points out that Jesus refused to be trapped by the [[Pharisees]] into choosing between the strict and liberal positions on divorce as held at the time in Judaism. When they asked him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?"{{Bibleref2c|Mt.|19:3}} he answered by reaffirming God's will as stated in Genesis {{Bibleref2-nb|Gen.|1:27}} and {{Bibleref2-nb|Gen.|2:24}}, that in marriage husband and wife are made "one flesh", and what God has united man must not separate.{{Bibleref2c|Mt.|19:4-6}}&lt;ref name="Stagg NT"/&gt;{{rp|pp.300–301}}

There is no evidence that Jesus himself ever married, and considerable evidence that he remained single. In contrast to Judaism and many other traditions,&lt;ref name="EOC"&gt;Fahlbusch, Erwin and Geoffrey Bromiley. ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity.'' Brill Academic Publishers (November 2000). {{ISBN|90-04-11695-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p.283}} he taught that there is a place for voluntary singleness in Christian service. He believed marriage could be a distraction from an urgent mission,&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Karen. ''The Gospel according to women: Christianity's creation of the sex war in the west,'' Anchor Books, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-385-24079-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he was living in a time of crisis and urgency where the [[Kingdom of God]] would be established where there would be no marriage nor giving in marriage:

{{Quotation|
"I tell you the truth," Jesus said to them, "no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God will fail to receive many times as much in this age and, in the [[World to Come|age to come]], [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]]."|{{bibleref2|Luke|18:29–30}}
}}

In {{bibleverse||Matthew|22:28-30|NIV}} Jesus is asked about the continuing state of marriage after death and he affirms that at the resurrection "people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven."

=== New Testament beyond the Gospels ===

The [[Saint Paul|Apostle Paul]] quoted passages from Genesis almost verbatim in two of his New Testament books. He used marriage not only to describe the kingdom of God, as Jesus had done, but to define also the nature of the 1st-century Christian church. His [[theology|theological view]] was a Christian development of the [[Old Testament]] parallel between marriage and the relationship between God and [[Israel]]. He analogized the church as a bride and Christ as the bridegroom─drawing parallels between Christian marriage and the relationship between Christ and the [[Christian Church|Church]].

[[File:PaulT.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Saint Paul Writing His Epistles'', 16th century.]]

There is no hint in the New Testament that Jesus was ever married, and no clear evidence that Paul was ever married. However, both Jesus and Paul seem to view marriage as a legitimate calling from God for Christians. Paul elevates singleness to that of the preferable position, but does offer a caveat suggesting this is "because of the impending crisis"—which could itself extend to present times (see also [[Pauline privilege]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1Corinthians|7:1,7-9,17,26-28,38,40|NET}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul's primary issue was that marriage adds concerns to one's life that detract from their ability to serve God without distraction.&lt;ref&gt;Rubio, Julie Hanlon. ''A Christian Theology of Marriage and Family.'' Paulist Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8091-4118-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1Corinthians|7:32-35|NET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have speculated that Paul may have been a widower since prior to his conversion to Christianity he was a [[Pharisees|Pharisee]] and member of the [[Sanhedrin]], positions in which the social norm of the day required the men to be married. But it is just as likely that he never married at all.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;Adams, Jay E. ''Marriage, Divorce, and Remarriage in the Bible,'' Zondervan, 1986, {{ISBN|0-310-51111-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, Paul acknowledges the mutuality of marital relations, and recognizes that his own singleness is "a particular gift from God" that others may not necessarily have. He writes: "Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am. But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion."{{Bibleref2c|1Co|7:8||1&amp;nbsp;Cor 7:8}}

[[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] indicates that [[bishop]]s, [[deacon]]s, and [[Elder (Christianity)|elder]]s must be "husbands of one wife", and that women must have one husband. This is usually understood to legislate against polygamy rather than to require marriage:

{{quotation|Now the overseer (bishop) is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.|{{Bibleref2|1tim|3:2||1&amp;nbsp;Timothy&amp;nbsp;3:2}}}}

{{quotation|A deacon must be faithful to his wife and must manage his children and his household well.|{{Bibleref2|1tim|3:12||1&amp;nbsp;Timothy&amp;nbsp;3:12}}}}

{{quotation|The reason I left you in Crete was that you might put in order what was left unfinished and appoint (or ordain) elders in every town, as I directed you. An elder must be blameless, faithful to his wife, a man whose children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient.|{{Bibleref2|Titus|1:5-6}}}}

In the Roman Age, female widows who did not remarry were considered more pure than those who did.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Walcot: On Widows and their Reputation in Antiquity.

=== Marriage and early Church Fathers ===

Building on what they saw the example of Jesus and Paul advocating, some early [[Church Fathers]] placed less value on the family and saw [[celibacy]] and freedom from family ties as a preferable state.

[[Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers|Nicene Fathers]] such as [[Augustine]] believed that marriage was a sacrament because it was a symbol used by Paul to express Christ's love of the Church. However, there was also an apocalyptic dimension in his teaching, and he was clear that if everybody stopped marrying and having children that would be an admirable thing; it would mean that the [[Kingdom of God]] would return all the sooner and the [[End times|world would come to an end]].&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;Armstrong, Karen. ''Gospel According to Women.'' Anchor Books, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-385-24079-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a view reflects the [[Manichaean]] past of Augustine.

While upholding the New Testament teaching that marriage is "honourable in all and the bed undefiled,"&lt;ref&gt;Hebrews 13:4&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine believed that "yet, whenever it comes to the actual process of generation, the very embrace which is lawful and honourable cannot be effected without the ardour of lust...This is the carnal concupiscence, which, while it is no longer accounted sin in the regenerate, yet in no case happens to nature except from sin."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/15071.htm Augustine, "On Marriage and Concupiscence," Book I], cp. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[Tertullian]] and Gregory of Nyssa were church fathers who were married. They each stressed that the happiness of marriage was ultimately rooted in misery. They saw marriage as a state of bondage that could only be cured by celibacy. They wrote that at the very least, the virgin woman could expect release from the "governance of a husband and the chains of children."&lt;ref&gt;Scholer, David M.''Women in early Christianity.'' Garland Publishing, 1993. {{ISBN|978-0-8153-1074-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.151}}

[[Tertullian]] argued that second marriage, having been freed from the first by death,"will have to be termed no other than a species of fornication," partly based on the reasoning that this involves desiring to marry a woman out of sexual ardor, which a Christian convert is to avoid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.iii.vi.ix.html "Chapter IX.—Second Marriage a Species of Adultery"] ANF04. Tertullian, Part Fourth.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also advocating celibacy and virginity as preferable alternatives to marriage, [[Jerome]] wrote: "It is not disparaging wedlock to prefer virginity. No one can make a comparison between two things if one is good and the other evil."&lt;ref&gt;''Classical library from 'Select Letters of St. Jerome,''&amp;nbsp;' Letter 22. tr. by F. A. Wright. Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; On [[First Corinthians]] 7:1 he reasons, "It is good, he says, for a man not to touch a woman. If it is good not to touch a woman, it is bad to touch one: for there is no opposite to goodness but badness. But if it be bad and the evil is pardoned, the reason for the concession is to prevent worse evil."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf206.vi.vi.I.html "Against Jovinianus," Book 1], Cps. 7,13,16,33&lt;/ref&gt;

St. [[John Chrysostom]] wrote: "...virginity is better than marriage, however good.... Celibacy is...an imitation of the angels. Therefore, virginity is as much more honorable than marriage, as the angel is higher than man. But why do I say angel? Christ, Himself, is the glory of virginity."&lt;ref&gt;St. John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on First Corinthians, NPNF, s. 1, v. 12, pp. 248–262&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cyprian]], Bishop of Carthage, said that the first commandment given to men was to increase and multiply, but now that the earth was full there was no need to continue this process of multiplication.&lt;ref&gt;St. Cyprian, "Of the Discipline and Advantage of Chastity," ''ANF,'' v. 5, p.1251.&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of marriage was reflected in the lack of any formal [[liturgy]] formulated for marriage in the [[Early Christianity|early Church]]. No special ceremonial was devised to celebrate Christian marriage—despite the fact that the Church had produced liturgies to celebrate the [[Eucharist]], [[Baptism]] and [[Confirmation]]. It was not important for a couple to have their nuptials blessed by a [[priest]]. People could marry by mutual agreement in the presence of witnesses.&lt;ref name="Armstrong" /&gt;

At first, the old Roman pagan rite was used by Christians, although modified superficially. The first detailed account of a Christian wedding in the West dates from the [[Christianity in the 9th century|9th century]]. This system, known as Spousals, persisted after the [[Reformation]].&lt;ref name="Armstrong" /&gt;

The Catholic Church allowed marriages to take place inside churches only starting with the 16th century, beforehand religious marriages happened on the porch of the church.&lt;ref name=monger&gt;{{cite book|last1=Monger|first1=George P.|year=2004|chapter=Christian Weddings|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=o8JlWxBYs40C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=marriage+ceremony+%22early+christianity%22&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OQX7VNjyPMKsUaGlgfAM&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBzgK|title=Marriage Customs of the World: From Henna to Honeymoons|location=Santa Barbara, CA|publisher=ABC CLIO|pages=70–71|isbn=9781576079874|oclc=469368346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] teaches that God himself is the author of the sacred institution of marriage, which is His way of showing love for those He created. Marriage is a divine institution that can never be broken, even if the husband or wife legally divorce in the civil courts; as long as they are both alive, the Church considers them bound together by God. Holy Matrimony is another name for sacramental marriage. Marriage is intended to be a faithful, exclusive, lifelong union of a man and a woman. Committing themselves completely to each other, a Catholic husband and wife strive to sanctify each other, bring children into the world, and educate them in the Catholic way of life. Man and woman, although created differently from each other, complement each other. This complementarity draws them together in a mutually loving union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|editor=Libreria Editrice Vaticana|editor-link=Vatican Publishing House|accessdate=2009-07-22|pages=1602–1605|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P51.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The valid marriage of baptized Christians is one of the seven [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Roman Catholic sacraments]]. The sacrament of marriage is the only sacrament that a priest does not administer directly; a priest, however, is the chief witness of the husband and wife's administration of the sacrament to each other at the wedding ceremony in a Catholic church.

The Roman Catholic Church views that Christ himself established the sacrament of marriage at the [[Marriage at Cana|wedding feast of Cana]]; therefore, since it is a divine institution, neither the Church nor state can alter the basic meaning and structure of marriage. Husband and wife give themselves totally to each other in a union that lasts until death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|editor=Libreria Editrice Vaticana|editor-link=Vatican Publishing House|accessdate=2009-07-22|page=1643|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P55.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Priest]]s are instructed that marriage is part of God's natural law and to support the couple if they do choose to marry. Today it is common for Roman Catholics to enter into a "mixed marriage" between a Catholic and a baptized non-Catholic. Couples entering into a mixed marriage are usually allowed to marry in a Catholic church provided their decision is of their own accord and they intend to remain together for life, to be faithful to each other, and to have children which are brought up in the Catholic faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|editor=Libreria Editrice Vaticana|editor-link=Vatican Publishing House|accessdate=2009-07-22|pages=1633–1637|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P53.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Roman Catholic teaching, marriage has two objectives: 
•the good of the spouses themselves
•and the procreation and education of children (1983 code of canon law, c.1055; 1994 catechism, par.2363). Hence "entering marriage with the intention of never having children is a grave wrong and more than likely grounds for an [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulment]]."&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, P. "Sacrament of Holy Matrimony."&lt;/ref&gt; It is normal procedure for a priest to ask the prospective bride and groom about their plans to have children before officiating at their wedding. The Roman Catholic Church may refuse to marry anyone unwilling to have children, since procreation by "the marriage act" is a fundamental part of marriage.&lt;ref name="humanae_vitae"&gt;[[Pope Paul VI]]."Humanæ Vitæ." 1968-7-25. Accessed: 2009-7-22&lt;/ref&gt; Thus usage of any form of [[contraception]], [[in vitro fertilization]], or [[birth control]] besides [[Natural Family Planning]] is a grave offense against the sanctity of marriage and ultimately against God.&lt;ref name="humanae_vitae" /&gt;

=== Protestantism ===

[[File:Wedding of Stephen Beckingham and Mary Cox, 1729 by William Hogarth.jpg|thumb|''The Wedding of Stephen Beckingham and Mary Cox'' by [[William Hogarth]], c. 1729 ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City|N.Y.]]).]]

==== Purposes ====

Essentially all [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations hold marriage to be ordained by God for the union between a man and a woman. They see the primary purposes of this union as intimate companionship, rearing children and mutual support for both husband and wife to fulfill their life callings.&lt;ref&gt;UMC&lt;/ref&gt; Protestants generally approve of [[birth control]] and consider marital sexual pleasure to be a gift of God. While condoning [[divorce]] only under limited circumstances, most Protestant churches allow for divorce and remarriage.&lt;ref&gt;Rubio, Julie Hanlon. ''A Christian Theology of Marriage and Family,'' Paulist Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8091-4118-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian fundamentalism|Conservative]] [[Protestantism|Protestants]] take a stricter view of the nature of marriage. They consider marriage a solemn [[Covenant (religion)|covenant]] between wife, husband and [[God]]. Most view sexual relations as appropriate only within a marriage. Divorce is permissible, if at all, only in very specific circumstances (for example, sexual immorality or abandonment by the non-believer).

The [[United Methodist Church]], the second largest Protestant denomination in the United States, specifically holds that "the covenant of marriage was established by God who created us male and female for each other".&lt;ref name="Tucker2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tucker|first=Karen B. Westerfield|title=American Methodist Worship|date=27 April 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English |isbn=9780190454203|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodists further teach that marriage is "God's gift and covenant intended to imitate [[New Covenant|God's covenant with humankind]]"&lt;ref name="Tucker2011"/&gt; that "Christians enter in their [[baptism]]."&lt;ref name="Church2016"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of Resolutions of The United Methodist Church 2016|date=16 December 2016|publisher=United Methodist Publishing House|language=English|isbn=9781501833250|page=623|quote=For the church, the marriage covenant is gounded in the covenant between God and God's people into which Christians enter in their baptism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[rite]] used in the [[Free Methodist Church]] proclaims that marriage is "more than a legal contract, being a bond of union made in heaven, into which you enter discreetly and reverently."&lt;ref name="Tucker2011"/&gt;

==== Roles and responsibilities ====

Roles and responsibilities of husband and wives now vary considerably on a continuum between the long-held male dominant/female submission view and a shift toward equality (without sameness)&lt;ref&gt;Steil, Janice M. ''Marital Equality: Its Relationship to the Well-Being of Husbands and Wives.'' Sage. 1997. {{ISBN|0-8039-5251-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the woman and the man.&lt;ref&gt;Throckmorton, Anne.

Accessed 11 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; There is considerable debate among many Christians today—not just Protestants—whether equality of husband and wife or male headship is the biblically ordained view, and even if it is biblically permissible. The divergent opinions fall into two main groups: [[Complementarianism|Complementarians]] (who call for husband-headship and wife-submission) and [[Christian Egalitarianism|Christian Egalitarians]] (who believe in full partnership equality in which couples can discover and negotiate roles and responsibilities in marriage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2004/august/8.55.html |title=Editor's Bookshelf: Creating Husbands and Fathers |accessdate=2007-02-11 |last=Neff |first=David |date=2004-08-01 |work=Christianity Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no debate that {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:12-32|NIV}} presents a historically benevolent husband-headship/wife-submission model for marriage. The questions are (a)&amp;nbsp;how these [[New Testament household codes]] are to be reconciled with the calls earlier in Chapter 5 (cf. verses 1, 18, 21) for mutual submission among all believers, and (b)&amp;nbsp;the meaning of "head" in v.23. It is important to note that verse 22 contains no verb in the original manuscripts:&lt;ref name="Staggs"/&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5}} (NIV)
::&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Follow God’s example, therefore, as dearly loved children 2 and walk in the way of love....
::&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; be filled with the Spirit....
::&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
::&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; Wives, ''[submit yourselves]'' to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
::&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church— &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; for we are members of his body. &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh." &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church. &lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.

=== Eastern Orthodoxy ===
{{main|Marriage in the Eastern Orthodox Church}}

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], marriage is treated as a [[Sacred Mysteries|Sacred Mystery]] (sacrament), and as an [[ordination]]. It serves to unite a woman and a man in eternal union before God.&lt;ref name=Fitzgerald&gt;[http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7105 Fitzgerald, Thomas.

Christianitytoday.com. Retrieved on 2011-01-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is considered a [[martyr]]dom as each spouse learns to die to self for the sake of the other. Like all Mysteries, Orthodox marriage is more than just a celebration of something which already exists: it is the creation of something new, the imparting to the couple of the [[Divine grace|grace]] which transforms them from a 'couple' into husband and wife within the [[Body of Christ]].&lt;ref name="Grabbe" /&gt;

[[File:Wedding ring Louvre AC924.jpg|left|thumb|Byzantine [[wedding ring]], depicting Christ uniting the bride and groom, 7th century, [[niello]]ed gold ([[Louvre|Musée du Louvre]]).]]

Marriage is an [[icon]] (image) of the relationship between Jesus and the Church. This is somewhat akin to the Old Testament [[prophet]]s' use of marriage as an analogy to describe the relationship between God and Israel. Marriage is the simplest, most basic unity of the church: a [[wikt:congregation|congregation]] where "two or three are gathered together in Jesus' name."{{bibleref2c|Mt|18:20|KJV}}&lt;ref name="Grabbe" /&gt; The home is considered a consecrated space (the ritual for the Blessing of a House is based upon that of the Consecration of a Church), and the husband and wife are considered the [[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]] of that congregation. However, they do not "perform" the Sacraments in the [[house church]]; they "live" the Sacrament of Marriage. Because marriage is considered to be a [[pilgrimage]] wherein the couple walk side by side toward the [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]], marriage to a non-Orthodox partner is discouraged, though it may be permitted.

Unlike Western Christianity, Eastern Christians do not consider the sacramental aspect of the marriage to be conferred by the couple themselves. Rather, the marriage is conferred by the action of the [[Holy Spirit]] acting through the priest. Furthermore, no one besides a bishop or priest—not even a [[deacon]]—may perform the Sacred Mystery.

The external sign of the marriage is the placing of wedding [[Crown (headgear)|crowns]] upon the heads of the couple, and their sharing in a "Common Cup" of wine. Once crowned, the couple walk a circle three times in a ceremonial "dance" in the middle of the church, while the choir intones a joyous three-part antiphonal hymn, "Dance, [[Isaiah]]"

The sharing of the Common Cup symbolizes the transformation of their union from a common marriage into a sacred union. The wedding is usually performed after the [[Divine Liturgy]] at which the couple receives [[Holy Communion]]. Traditionally, the wedding couple would wear their wedding crowns for eight days, and there is a special prayer said by the priest at the removal of the crowns.

Divorce is discouraged. Sometimes out of ''[[economia]]'' (mercy) a marriage may be dissolved if there is no hope whatever for a marriage to fulfill even a semblance of its intended sacramental character.&lt;ref name="Grabbe" /&gt; The standard formula for remarriage is that the Orthodox Church joyfully blesses the first marriage, merely performs the second, barely tolerates the third, and invariably forbids the fourth.&lt;ref name="Hapgood"&gt;{{Citation|last =Hapgoood|first =Isabel F.|year =1922|publicationdate=1975|title =Service Book of the Holy Orthodox-Catholic Apostolic Church|edition=2nd|pages =291–305, 604–605|place =Englewood, N.J.|publisher =Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:07Thessaloniki Agia Sophia09.jpg|thumb|Orthodox Church prepared for a wedding ([[Hagia Sophia (Thessaloniki)|Hagia Sophia]], [[Thessaloniki]].)]]

[[Early church]] texts forbid marriage between an Orthodox Christian and a [[Heresy|heretic]] or [[Schism (religion)|schismatic]] (which would include all non-Orthodox Christians). Traditional Orthodox Christians forbid [[Interfaith marriage|mixed marriage]]s with other denominations. More liberal ones perform them, provided that the couple formally commit themselves to rearing their children in the Orthodox faith.

All people are called to celibacy—human beings are all born into [[virginity]], and Orthodox Christians are expected by [[Sacred Tradition]] to remain in that state unless they are called into marriage and that call is sanctified.&lt;ref name="Grabbe"&gt;Gregory (Grabbe), Bishop. ''The Sacramental Life: An Orthodox Christian Perspective.'' Liberty, Tenn: St. John of Kronstadt Press, 1986
&lt;/ref&gt; The church blesses two paths on the journey to salvation: [[monasticism]] and marriage. Mere celibacy, without the sanctification of monasticism, can fall into selfishness and tends to be regarded with disfavour by the Church.&lt;ref name="Grabbe" /&gt;

Orthodox priests who serve in [[parish]]es are usually married. They must marry prior to their ordination. If they marry after they are ordained they are not permitted to continue performing sacraments. If their wife dies, they are forbidden to remarry; if they do, they may no longer serve as a priest. A married man may be ordained as a priest or deacon. However, a priest or deacon is not permitted to enter into matrimony after ordination. Bishops must always be monks and are thus celibate. However, if a married priest is widowed, he may receive monastic tonsure and thus become eligible for the episcopate.

The Eastern Orthodox Church believes that marriage is an eternal union of spouses, but in Heaven there will not be a procreative bond of marriage.

=== Oriental Orthodoxy ===
The [[miaphysitism|Non-Chalcedonian]] Churches of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] hold views almost identical to those of the ([[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian]]) [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] allows second marriages only in cases of adultery or death of spouse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/news/coptic-pope-resists-court-ruling-divorce-remarriage Coptic Pope resists court ruling on divorce, remarriage | Al-Masry Al-Youm: Today's News from Egypt].

In the teachings of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), [[celestial marriage|celestial (or eternal) marriage]] is a [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenant]] between a man, a woman, and [[God in Mormonism|God]] performed by a [[priesthood (Mormonism)|priesthood]] authority in a [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] of the church.&lt;ref name = gospelprinciples/&gt; Celestial marriage is intended to continue forever into the [[afterlife]] if the man and woman do not break their covenants.&lt;ref name = gospelprinciples&gt;[http://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-38-eternal-marriage "Chapter 38: Eternal Marriage"], ''[[Gospel Principles]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, eternally married couples are often referred to as being "[[Sealing (Mormonism)|sealed]]" to each other. Sealed couples who keep their covenants are also promised to have their posterity sealed to them in the afterlife.&lt;ref name = gospelprinciples/&gt; (Thus, "families are forever" is a common phrase in the LDS Church.) A celestial marriage is considered a requirement for [[exaltation (Latter Day Saints)|exaltation]].&lt;ref name = gospelprinciples/&gt;

In some countries, celestial marriages can be recognized as civil marriages; in other cases, couples are civilly married outside of the temple and are later sealed in a celestial marriage.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Handbook (LDS Church)|Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2010) § 3.5.&lt;/ref&gt; (The church will no longer perform a celestial marriage for a couple unless they are first or simultaneously legally married.) The church encourages its members to be in good standing with it so that they may marry or be sealed in the temple. A celestial marriage is not annulled by a civil divorce: a "cancellation of a sealing" may be granted, but only by the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], the highest authority in the church. Civil divorce and marriage outside the temple carries somewhat of a stigma in the Mormon culture; the church teaches that the "gospel of Jesus Christ—including repentance, forgiveness, integrity, and love—provides the remedy for conflict in marriage."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lds.org/topics/divorce "Gospel Topics: Divorce"], lds.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding marriage and divorce, the church instructs its leaders: "No priesthood officer is to counsel a person whom to marry. Nor should he counsel a person to divorce his or her spouse. Those decisions must originate and remain with the individual. When a marriage ends in divorce, or if a husband and wife separate, they should always receive counseling from Church leaders."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Handbook (LDS Church)|Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2010) § 7.2.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In church temples, members of the LDS Church perform vicarious celestial marriages for deceased couples who were legally married.

==== New Church (or Swedenborgian Church) ====

[[The New Church]] teaches that marriage love (sometimes translated "conjugial love") is "the precious jewel of human life and the repository of the Christian religion" because the love shared between a husband and a wife is the source of all peace and joy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/exposition/translation/conjugial-love-rogers/contents/4570 Conjugial Love 457]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] coined the term "conjugial" (not to be confused with the more general term for marriage, "conjugial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/exposition/translation/conjugial-love-rogers/contents/980|title=Conjugial Love 98|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dictionary.reference.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/conjugial |title=Conjugial &amp;#124; Define Conjugial at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to describe the special love experienced by married partners.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. ''[https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/exposition/translation/conjugial-love-rogers/contents/10 Conjugial Love]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dictionary.reference.com"/&gt; When a husband and wife work together to build their marriage on earth, that marriage continues after the death of their bodies and they live as [[angels]] in [[heaven]] into eternity. Swedenborg claimed to have spoken to angel couples who had been married for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=42 |title=ML 42 - Small Canon Search - Reading - The Word of God, The Whole Word of God, and Nothing But the Word of God - Searching the Second Advent Christian Bible - The Second Advent Christian Canon of Scripture |publisher=Small Canon Search |date= |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who never married in the natural world will, if they wish, find a spouse in heaven.&lt;!-- please insert other denominational views here --&gt;

==== Jehovah's Witnesses ====
The [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] view marriage to be a permanent arrangement with the only possible exception being adultery. Divorce is strongly discouraged even when adultery is committed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reference.com/world-view/things-jehovah-s-witnesses-believe-marriage-efe80a14d1d56e08}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the wronged spouse is free to forgive the unfaithful one. There are provisions for a domestic separation in the event of "failure to provide for one's household" and domestic violence, or spiritual resistance on the part of a partner. Even in such situations though divorce would be considered grounds for loss of privileges in the congregation. Remarrying after death or a proper divorce is permitted. Marriage is the only situation where any type of sexual interaction is acceptable, and even then certain restrictions apply to acts such as oral and anal sex.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Married persons who are known to commit such acts may in fact lose privileges in the congregation as they are supposed to be setting a good example to the congregation.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Watchtower]] September 15, 2006, March 15, 1983, November 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of America]], many Lutheran, reformed and united churches in [[Evangelical Church in Germany]], some reformed churches in [[Federation of Swiss Protestant Churches]] does not administer sacramental marriage to same-sex couples, but blesses same-sex unions through the use of a specific liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toronto.anglican.ca/uploads.php?id=4d83da6cc1ad3 Toronto.Anglican.ca:Pastoral guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Catholic Church, the Orthodox Christian Church, and other more conservative [[Protestant]] denominations do not perform or recognize same-sex marriage because they do not consider it as marriage at all. The '''Global Anglican Future Conference''' ('''GAFCON''') consisting of the Church of Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda; Churches of South Cone, Australia, parts of England, Canada, USA and Church of India through the Jerusalem Conference condemned same-sexual preferences and marriages as not biblical and sin against God.

'''Movements for [[civil rights]] in [[Seattle]]''' started well before the celebrated struggles in the South in the 1950s and 1960s, and they relied not just on [[African American]] activists but also on [[Filipino American]]s, [[Japanese American]]s, [[Chinese American]]s, [[Jew]]s, [[Latino]]s, and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s. They also depended upon the support of some elements of the region's labor movement. From the 1910s through the 1970s, labor and civil rights were linked in complicated ways, with some unions and radical organizations providing critical support to struggles for racial justice, while others stood in the way.

==History==

===Segregationist Past===
For most of its history Seattle was a segregated city, as committed to [[white supremacy]] as any location in America. People of color were excluded from most jobs, most neighborhoods and schools, and many stores, restaurants, hotels, and other commercial establishments, even hospitals. As in other western states, the system of severe racial discrimination in Seattle targeted not just African Americans but also Native Americans, Asian Americans, [[Pacific Islander]]s, people of Mexican ancestry, and also, at times, Jews.

===Greater Seattle Housing Council===
In 1956, Seattle's Civic Unity Committee created the Greater Seattle Housing Council, intending to encourage dialogue between proponents of [[open housing]] (i.e. racially integrated housing) and the real estate industry. At this time, talks were fruitless. The following year, [[Washington (state)|Washington]] State passed an Omnibus Civil Rights Act that provided that housing that had current federal or state government loans could not discriminate on the basis of race. In 1959, this was challenged in King County Superior Court.&lt;ref name=seattle-timeline&gt;[http://clerk.ci.seattle.wa.us/~public/doclibrary/OHousing/timeline.shtml The Seattle Open Housing Campaign, 1959-1968 - Timeline]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Seattle Municipal Archives. Accessed online 24 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--source doesn't clarify what happened in court, should be followed up--&gt;

The civil rights campaign in Seattle stepped up in October 1961, when the Seattle Employment Discrimination campaign urged selective buying with campaigns referred to as well a "shoe-in" and a "shop-in." In this same time frame, the NAACP requested an open housing ordinance. The [[Seattle City Council]] convened a public hearing on the matter on December 11, 1961, but declined to act, recommending instead that supporters of such a law organize a ballot [[initiative]].&lt;ref name=seattle-timeline /&gt;

Rather than focus immediately on legislation, proponents of open housing pursued a different channel in the short run: in the summer of 1962, 24 organizations created the Fair Housing Listing Service (FHLS) to bring blacks who wished to purchase housing outside of Seattle's historically black [[Central District, Seattle, Washington|Central District]] together with white homeowners willing to sell to minorities. By the beginning of 1965, FHLS negotiated 50 such sales.&lt;ref name=seattle-timeline /&gt;

On December 17, 1962, the Mayor's Citizen's Advisory Committee on Minority Housing recommended that an open housing ordinance be submitted to city council, but the mayor and council delayed all action for a year. That year would prove eventful.&lt;ref name=seattle-timeline /&gt;

The [[Urban League]] and NAACP resigned from the Greater Seattle Housing Council because they believed had been ineffective in housing matters. A new committee was formed, the Central Area Civil Rights Committee (CACRC). 400 people participated in a protest march July 1, 1963, and 35 youth from the interracial Central District Youth Club staged Seattle's first sit-in, a nearly 24-hour occupation of the mayor's office. That very day the city council and mayor proposed a Seattle Human Rights Commission, which was established July 17 (City Ordinance 92191). The commission was authorized to draft open housing ordinance. This did not prevent a July 20 sit-in in the council chambers.&lt;ref name=seattle-timeline /&gt;

===Public Schools===
On August 28, 1963, the same day as [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], 1,000 demonstrators marched from Seattle's First [[African Methodist Episcopal Church|AME]] Church to the Federal Courthouse. Also that same day, [[Seattle Public Schools]] became the country's first major school system to initiate a voluntary [[desegregation]] plan. A week later, September 3, 1963, the Seattle Human Rights Commission recommended an ordinance against discrimination in housing sales, rentals, and financing.&lt;ref name=seattle-timeline /&gt;

===Open housing bill===
An October 20 March in support of open housing drew 1,200 people. Five days later, the city council, meeting as a Committee of the Whole, held a public hearing on the open housing bill recommended by the Seattle Human Rights Commission. The bill was approved 7-2, but was stripped of the emergency clause that would have made a council vote sufficient to turn the bill immediately into law without the possibility of being overturned by a [[referendum]]. As would have been the case with or without an emergency clause, the Committee of the Whole sent the bill to the council as such (the same people) for a final vote. The two council votes against the final version of the bill were [[Wing Luke]] and [[Charles M. Carroll]], both opposing it because the emergency clause had been taken out.&lt;ref name=seattle-timeline /&gt;

On November 27, 1963 the council approved the bill (as Ordinance 92497) by the same 7–2 margin, without the emergency clause. On December 9, 1963, Ordinance 92533 submitted Ordinance 92497 to the voters by charter referendum as part of a general election on March 10, 1964.&lt;ref name=seattle-timeline /&gt;

However, prospects did not bode well. On February 12, 1964 voters in nearby [[Tacoma, Washington]] defeated similar legislation by a margin of 3-1. On March 7, three days before the referendum vote, over 1,500 attended an open housing rally, marching from several places around the city to Westlake Plaza, but the March 10 election saw the ordinance go down to defeat, 115,627 to 54,448, as [[J. Dorm Braman]], an opponent of open housing, was elected mayor of Seattle, defeating open housing supporter [[John Cherberg]].&lt;ref name=seattle-timeline /&gt;&lt;!-- and, yes, the John Cherberg who is linked is the correct John Cherberg, even if he is better known for football. --&gt;

===Congress of Racial Equality===
In summer 1964, the [[Freedom Summer]] was occurring in [[Mississippi]] and (on July 2) President Johnson signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In Seattle, the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE) initiated the Drive for Equal Employment in Downtown Stores (DEEDS), with a goal that minorities would constitute 24% of new hires in those stores. Through January 1965, these stores were subjected to boycotts. CORE also organized pickets and sit-ins at local real estate industry offices, but a court-ordered injunction terminated the latter protests.&lt;ref name=seattle-timeline /&gt;

===Freedom March===
Thirteen days after Bloody Sunday (March 7, 1965, when the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma-to-Montgomery march]] in [[Alabama]] came under violent attack), more than 600 people in Seattle—a group slightly larger than the Selma-to-Montgomery march itself—took part in a "Freedom March" in support of the Selma marchers. Marching from the First AME Church to the Federal Courthouse, under the leadership of the NAACP, they demanded open housing legislation and equal job opportunities.&lt;ref name=seattle-timeline /&gt;

Seattle's open housing forces took a blow when, on May 15, 1965, just before the summer of the  [[Voting Rights Act]] and the [[Watts Riots]], an airplane crash killed Sidney Gerber and city council member Wing Luke. Gerber had founded Harmony Homes, which by that time had built 15 homes for African Americans in previously all-white Seattle neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=seattle-timeline /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.lib.washington.edu/findingaids/view?docId=PalmerDouglasShaw5780.xml Douglas Shaw Palmer Papers.] 2006. 0.03 cubic feet (1 vertical file).&lt;/ref&gt;

Momentum was regained two years later, when on June 8, 1967 the Seattle [[Urban League]] initiated the three-year Operation Equality. Operation Equality provided counsel to minorities seeking housing, sponsored educational projects, and worked with fair housing groups to list available housing. It was the second such project in the United States to receive a [[Ford Foundation]] grant.&lt;ref name=seattle-timeline /&gt;

Later that year, [[Sam Smith (Seattle)|Sam Smith]] won a Seattle City Council seat in the November election, becoming the first African American to serve on the council.&lt;ref name=seattle-timeline /&gt;

===Civil Rights Act of 1968===
On April 11, 1968,  one week after the assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1968. "Fair housing" had become federal policy, and Seattle had lost its opportunity to get out in front of the federal government on the matter. Eight days later, on April 19, 1968, the Seattle City Council unanimously passed a fair housing ordinance (Ordinance 96619). This time, sponsored by Smith and five other members of the 9-member council, it passed with an emergency clause, making it impossible to appeal by referendum by the voters.&lt;ref name=seattle-timeline /&gt;

Over the years, the legislation would be broadened further. In 1975, discrimination based on sex, marital status, sexual orientation, and political ideology were outlawed. In 1979, parental status was added; in 1986, creed and disability; and in 1999 gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;The Seattle Open Housing Campaign, 1961-1968, bookmark issued by Seattle Municipal Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1049">'''Debug Project''' is an ongoing project by [[Alphabet Inc.]] subsidiary Verily in [[California]] to reduce the numbers of mosquitos in a given area through interruption of the reproductive cycle.  Through laboratory methods naturally-occurring bacteria [[Wolbachia]] infect healthy male [[mosquitos]] of the species [[Aedes aegypti]]. Subsequently these mosquitos are released into the wild with the intent to mate with female mosquitos and by virtue of the Wolbachia infection lay non-producing eggs.  It is believed that through this process the overall population of mosquitos will be reduced by interrupting the reproductive cycle.  The hope is that if successful, these might be released in more endemic areas of the world where mosquitos pose a health risk through the diseases they carry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Let's Stop Bad Bugs With Good Bugs|url=https://debug.com/|website=De Bug Project|publisher=Verily Life Sciences LLC|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], '''diglossia''' ({{IPAc-en|d|aɪ|ˈ|ɡ|l|ɒ|s|i|ə}}) is a situation in which two [[dialects]] or [[languages]] are used by a single language community. In addition to the community's everyday or [[vernacular]] language variety (labeled "L" or "low" variety), a second, highly codified variety (labeled "H" or "high") is used in certain situations such as literature, formal education, or other specific settings, but not used for ordinary conversation.&lt;ref name=Ferguson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferguson |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles A. Ferguson |year=1959 |title=Diglossia |journal=Word |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=325–340 |doi=10.1080/00437956.1959.11659702 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, the H variety has no native speakers.

The high variety may be an older stage of the same language (as in medieval Europe, where Latin remained in formal use even as [[Romance languages|colloquial speech]] diverged), an unrelated language, or a distinct yet closely related present day dialect (e.g. [[Standard German]] alongside [[Low German]]; or [[Chinese language|Chinese]], with [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] as the official, literary standard and local [[varieties of Chinese]] used in everyday communication). Other examples include literary [[Katharevousa]] versus spoken [[Demotic Greek]]; literary [[Tamil language|Tamil]] versus spoken Tamil and Indonesian, with its ''Baku'' and ''Gaul'' forms;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=James N.|last=Sneddon|title=Diglossia in Indonesian|journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde|volume=159|issue=4|year=2003|pages=519–549}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Literary Welsh morphology|literary]] versus [[Colloquial Welsh morphology|spoken]] [[Welsh language|Welsh]].

== Etymology ==

The [[Greek language|Greek]] word διγλωσσία (''diglōssia'') normally refers to bilingualism in general, but was first used in the specialized meaning explained by [[Emmanuel Rhoides]] in the prologue of his ''Parerga'' in 1885.  The term was immediately adapted into [[French language|French]] as ''diglossie'' by the Greek linguist and [[Demotic Greek|demoticist]] [[Ioannis Psycharis]], with credit to Rhoides. The [[Arabist]] [[William Marçais]] used the term in 1930 to describe the linguistic situation in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speaking countries. The [[sociolinguist]] Charles A. Ferguson introduced the English equivalent ''diglossia'' in 1959, using the word as the title of an article. The article has become such a classic that it has been cited over 4,000 times according to [[Google scholar]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=ferguson+diglossia&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C44&amp;as_sdtp= Google scholar citation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language registers and types of diglossia==
&lt;!--Endoglossia and Exoglossia redirect here --&gt;

In his 1959 article, [[Charles A. Ferguson]] defines diglossia as follows:

{{quote|DIGLOSSIA is a relatively stable language situation in which, in addition to the primary dialects of the language (which may include a standard or regional standards), there is a very divergent, highly codified (often grammatically more complex) superposed variety, the vehicle of a large and respected body of written literature, either of an earlier period or in another speech community, which is learned largely by formal education and is used for most written and formal spoken purposes but is not used by any sector of the community for ordinary conversation.&lt;ref name=Ferguson /&gt;}}

Here, diglossia is seen as a kind of [[bilingualism]] in a society in which one of the languages has high prestige (henceforth referred to as "H"), and another of the languages has low prestige ("L"). In Ferguson's definition, the high and low variants are always closely related.

Ferguson gives the example of standardized Arabic and says that, "very often, educated Arabs will maintain they never use L at all, in spite of the fact that direct observation shows that they use it constantly in ordinary conversation" &lt;ref name="Ferguson" /&gt;

[[Joshua Fishman]] expanded the definition of diglossia to include the use of unrelated languages as high and low varieties.&lt;ref name=Fishman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fishman |first=Joshua |authorlink=Joshua Fishman |title=Bilingualism with and without diglossia; diglossia with and without bilingualism |year=1967 |journal=Journal of Social Issues |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=29–38 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1967.tb00573.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Alsace]] the [[Alsatian language]] (Elsässisch) serves as (L) and [[French language|French]] as (H). [[Heinz Kloss]] calls the (H) variant ''exoglossia'' and the (L) variant ''endoglossia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Heinz |last=Kloss |author-link=Heinz Kloss |title=Notes concerning a language-nation typology |pages=69–85 |book-title=Language Problems of Developing Nations |editor-first=Joshua A. |editor-last=Fishman |editor-first2=Charles A. |editor-last2=Ferguson |editor-first3=Jyotirindra |editor-last3=Das Gupta |publisher=Wiley |year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases (especially with [[creole languages]]), the nature of the connection between (H) and (L) is not one of diglossia but a [[Post-creole speech continuum|continuum]]; for example, [[Jamaican Creole]] as (L) and Standard [[English language|English]] as (H) in Jamaica.

(H) is usually the written language whereas (L) is the spoken language. In formal situations, (H) is used; in informal situations, (L) is used. Sometimes, (H) is used in informal situations and as spoken language when speakers of 2 different (L) languages and dialects or more communicate each other (as [[lingua franca]]), but not the other way around.

One of the earliest examples was that of [[Middle Egyptian]], the language in everyday use in Ancient Egypt during the Middle Kingdom (2000 - 1650 BC). By 1350 BC, in the New Kingdom (1550 -1050 BC), the Egyptian language had evolved into [[Late Egyptian]], which itself later evolved into [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] (700 BC - AD 400). These two later forms served as (L) languages in their respective periods. But in both cases, Middle Egyptian remained the standard written, prestigious form, the (H) language, and was still used for this purpose until the fourth century AD, more than sixteen centuries after it had ceased to exist in everyday speech.

Another historical example is Latin, [[Classical Latin]] being the (H) and [[Vulgar Latin]] the (L); the latter, which is almost completely unattested in text, is the tongue from which the [[Romance languages]] descended.

The (L) variants are not just simplifications or "corruptions" of the (H) variants. In phonology, for example, (L) dialects are as likely to have phonemes absent from the (H) as vice versa. Some [[Swiss German]] dialects have three phonemes, /e/, {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/æ/}}, in the phonetic space where Standard German has only two phonemes, {{IPA|/ɛ(ː)/}} (''Berlin'' 'Berlin', ''Bären'' 'bears') and {{IPA|/eː/}} (''Beeren'' 'berries'). Jamaican Creole has fewer vowel phonemes than standard English, but it has additional palatal {{IPA|/kʲ/}} and {{IPA|/ɡʲ/}} phonemes.

Especially in endoglossia the (L) form may also be called "[[basilect]]", the (H) form "[[acrolect]]", and an intermediate form "[[mesolect]]".

Ferguson's classic examples include Standard German/Swiss German, Standard [[Arabic language|Arabic]]/[[varieties of Arabic|Arabic vernacular]]s, Standard French/[[Haitian Creole language|Creole]] in Haiti, and [[Katharevousa]]/[[Modern Greek|Dimotiki]] in [[Greece]].&lt;ref name=Ferguson /&gt; Creole is now recognized as a standard language in Haiti. Swiss German dialects are hardly languages with low prestige in Switzerland (see Chambers, Sociolinguistic Theory).{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} And after the end of the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|military regime]] in 1974, Dimotiki was made into Greece's only standard language (1976). Nowadays, Katharevousa is (with a few exceptions) no longer used. Harold Schiffman writes about Swiss German: "it seems to be the case that Swiss German was once consensually agreed to be in a diglossic hierarchy with Standard German, but that this consensus is now breaking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Schiffman, Harold. |title=Classical and extended diglossia |url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/messeas/diglossia/node6.html |accessdate=2010-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also common [[code-switching]] especially in the Arabic world; according to Andrew Freeman this is "different from Ferguson's description of diglossia which states that the two forms are in complementary distribution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.innerbrat.org/Andyf/Articles/Diglossia/digl_96.htm |title=Andrew Freeman's Perspectives on Arabic Diglossia |author=Freeman, Andrew |date=9 December 1996 |work=Andy Freeman's Homepage |accessdate=8 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527030448/http://innerbrat.org/Andyf/Articles/Diglossia/digl_96.htm |archivedate=27 May 2010 |df= }}{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To a certain extent, there is code switching and overlap in all diglossic societies, even German-speaking Switzerland.

Examples where the High/Low dichotomy is justified in terms of social prestige include [[Regional Italian|Italian dialects]] as (L) and [[Italian language|Standard Italian]] as (H) in Italy and German dialects and standard German in Germany. In Italy and Germany, those speakers who still speak non-standard dialects typically use those dialects in informal situations, especially in the family. In German-speaking Switzerland, on the other hand, Swiss German dialects are to a certain extent even used in schools and to a larger extent in churches. Ramseier calls German-speaking Switzerland's diglossia a "medial diglossia", whereas Felicity Rash prefers "functional diglossia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rash |first=Felicity |year=1998 |title=The German Language in Switzerland: Multilingualism, Diglossia and Variation |location=Berne |publisher=Peter Lang |isbn=0-8204-3413-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paradoxically, Swiss German offers both the best example of diglossia (all speakers are native speakers of Swiss German and thus diglossic) and the worst, because there is no clear-cut hierarchy.

In most African countries, a European language serves as the official, prestige language, and local languages are used in everyday life outside formal situations. For example, [[Wolof language|Wolof]] is the everyday ''lingua franca'' in Senegal, French being spoken only in very formal situations; English is spoken in formal situations in Nigeria, native languages like [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] are spoken in ordinary conversations. However, a European language that serves as an official language is also spoken in informal situations if speakers of 2 different languages or more communicate each other. In [[Ivory Coast|Côte d'Ivoire]], standard [[Standard French|European French]] is the prestige language used in business, politics, etc. while [[african French#Abidjan French vocabulary|Ivorian French]] is the daily language in the street, on the markets, and informal situations in general; in Mozambique, standard [[European Portuguese]] is the language used in the formal situations, while [[Mozambican Portuguese]] is the spoken language in the informal situations; [[British English]] is the language used in the formal situations in Nigeria, while [[Nigerian English]] is the spoken language in the informal situations. In the countryside, local African dialects prevail. However, in traditional events, local languages can be used as prestige dialects : for example, a wedding ceremony between two young urban Baoulés with poor knowledge of the Baoulé language would require the presence of elder family members as interpreters in the Baoulé language so as to conduct the ceremony in that language and not in French. There are European languages in Africa, particularly North Africa, without official status that are used as prestige language: for example, in Morocco, while Modern Standard Arabic is the only official language and used in formal situations and Moroccan dialects are spoken in informal situations, French and Spanish are also spoken in formal situations by code-switching, and educated Moroccans are simultaneous bilinguals/trilinguals in Modern Standard Arabic and French/Spanish, with Moroccan dialects.

==Greek diglossia==
[[Greek language question|Greek diglossia]] belongs to the category whereby, while the living language of the area evolves and changes as time passes by, there is an artificial retrospection to and imitation of earlier (more ancient) linguistic forms preserved in writing and considered to be scholarly and classic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Apanta (Άπαντα) (vol.5)|last = Triandaphyllidis|first = Manolis|publisher = Aristotle University, Institute for Modern Greek Studies (Manolis Triandaphyllidis Foundation)|year = 1963|isbn = |location = Thessaloniki|pages = 491}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest recorded examples of diaglossia was during the first century AD, when Hellenistic Alexandrian scholars decided that, in order to strengthen the link between the people and the glorious culture of the [[Classical Greece|Greek “Golden Age”]] (5th c. BC), people should adopt the language of that era. The phenomenon, called “[[Atticism]]”, dominated the writings of part of the [[Hellenistic_Greece|Hellenistic period]], the [[Byzantine Greece|Byzantine]] and Medieval era. Following the [[Greek War of Independence]] of 1821 and in order to “cover new and immediate needs” making their appearance with “the creation of the Greek State”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ελληνοϊνδικά Μελετήματα|last = Σετάτος|first = Μιχάλης|publisher = Κωνσταντινίδης|year = 1969|isbn = |location = Θεσσαλονίκη|pages = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; scholars brought to life “Κatharevousa” or “purist” language. Katharevousa did not constitute the natural development of the language of the people, the “[[Koine Greek|Koine]]”,  “Romeika”, [[Demotic Greek]] or Dimotiki as it is currently referred to. It constituted an attempt to purify the language from vulgar forms such as words of foreign origin, especially Turkish and Slavic languages, but also French or Italian and substitute them with ancient Attic forms and even by reaching down to Homeric ''cleansed'' and ''refined'' words.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

== Sociolinguistics ==
As an aspect of study of the relationships between [[codes]] and [[social structure]], diglossia is an important concept in the field of [[sociolinguistics]]. At the social level, each of the two dialects has certain spheres of social interaction assigned to it and in the assigned spheres it is the only socially acceptable dialect (with minor exceptions). At the grammatical level, differences may involve pronunciation, [[inflection]], and/or [[syntax]] (sentence structure). Differences can range from minor (although conspicuous) to extreme. In many cases of diglossia, the two dialects are so divergent that they are distinct languages as defined by [[linguistics|linguists]]: they are not [[mutually intelligible]].

Thomas Ricento, an author on language policy and political theory believes that there is always a "socially constructed hierarchy, indexed from low to high." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ricento|first1=Thomas|title=Political economy and English as a 'global' language|journal=Critical Multilingualism Studies|date=2012|volume=1|issue=1|pages=31-56|url=http://cms.arizona.edu/index.php/multilingual/article/view/11/30|access-date=2017-03-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304114108/http://cms.arizona.edu/index.php/multilingual/article/view/11/30|archive-date=2017-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hierarchy is generally imposed by leading political figures or popular media and is sometimes not the native language of that particular region. The dialect that is the original [[mother tongue]] is almost always of low [[prestige dialect|prestige]]. Its spheres of use involve informal, interpersonal [[communication]]: conversation in the home, among friends, in marketplaces. In some diglossias, this vernacular dialect is virtually unwritten. Those who try to use it in literature may be severely criticized or even persecuted. The other dialect is held in high esteem and is devoted to written communication and formal spoken communication, such as university instruction, primary education, sermons, and speeches by government officials. It is usually not possible to acquire proficiency in the formal, "high" dialect without formal study of it. Thus in those [[diglossic]] societies which are also characterized by extreme [[economic inequality|inequality]] of [[social classes]], most people are not proficient in speaking the high dialect, and if the high dialect is grammatically different enough, as in the case of Arabic diglossia, these uneducated classes cannot understand most of the [[public speeches]] that they might hear on television and radio. The high prestige dialect (or language) tends to be the more formalised, and its forms and vocabulary often 'filter down' into the vernacular though often in a changed form.

In many diglossic areas, there is controversy and [[Attitude polarization|polarization]] of opinions of native speakers regarding the relationship between the two dialects and their respective [[Social status|statuses]]. In cases that the "high" dialect is objectively not [[Mutual intelligibility|intelligible]] to those exposed only to the [[vernacular]], some people insist that the two dialects are nevertheless a common language. The pioneering scholar of diglossia, [[Charles A. Ferguson]], observed that [[native speakers]] proficient in the high prestige dialect will commonly try to avoid using the vernacular dialect with foreigners and may even deny its existence even though the vernacular is the only socially appropriate one for themselves to use when speaking to their relatives and friends. Yet another common attitude is that the low dialect, which is everyone's [[native language]], ought to be abandoned in favor of the high dialect, which presently is nobody's native language.

== 'Critical diglossia' and 'lifestyle diglossia' ==

Mukul Saxena has taken the term "diglossia" and applied it to different data, adding both a critical perspective from the Sociolinguistics of Periphery and also making a distinction between linguistic capital and language capital. It is too soon to tell whether this will become a widely used application of "diglossia".

‘Critical diglossia’,&lt;ref name="Saxena, Mukul 2014 Pages 91"&gt;Saxena, Mukul (2014) “Critical diglossia” and “lifestyle diglossia”: development and the interaction between multilingualism, cultural diversityand English. International Journal of the Sociology of Language. Volume 2014, Issue 225, Pages 91–112, ISSN (Online) 1613–3668, ISSN (Print) 0165-2516&lt;/ref&gt; a revised notion of diglossia, underpins the state sponsored ideological dimension of the High and Low functional distribution of languages and the attitudes towards languages. In contrast to the language-centric notion of classical diglossia, the revised notion contends that diglossia is primarily a socio-cultural, economic and political phenomenon not necessarily accepted as a natural state of affairs by all the minority groups, the speakers of Low languages/varieties. Critical diglossia not only describes how language varieties and languages in a particular linguistic market are functionally distributed in formal and informal domains and their linguistic and language capitals are valued as High and Low, but also studies the reasons why the asymmetrical relationship between the language varieties and languages develops, as well as the role that historical and current political, economic and socio-cultural processes play in its construction.

While it draws on the earlier contribution of sociolinguistics of periphery in acknowledging diglossia as imposed from above, it goes further in incorporating the role of agency as proposed in another revised concept, ‘lifestyle diglossia’.&lt;ref name="Saxena, Mukul 2014 Pages 91" /&gt; Lifestyle diglossia contends how and why diglossia can also develop from below in the way individuals’ everyday socio-cultural practices and projection of identities shape their language practices.

Alternative lifestyles reflected in these practices are facilitated by the unprecedented nature of the flows of ideas, people, goods and language practices that are associated with 21st century globalization. This focus on people’s everyday practices allows for observing the language choices people make as inextricably linked to their chosen lifestyles. By capturing the micro-level practices, the ‘lifestyle diglossia’ suggests that people actively project their group affiliations and individuality by drawing on the global flows of lifestyles and local structural arrangements.

For example, when German speakers use English, they are doing more than speaking a foreign language. According to Passmore: &lt;blockquote&gt;The use of English doesn’t express some asymmetrical power relationship between German and English, nor is it related to class or race or whatnot. Sure, there are poseurs, but it’s stupid to think Germans who can speak the language of cars in English because they race them or the language of music because they consume and/or play music are living out some desperate [[wikt:wannabe|wannabe]] existence by using and knowing English terms for these things. It’s probably because with the English knowledge of these terms, one can find an even larger pool of interlocutors about a specific subject (or “lifestyle” object) online or even within Germany itself. These words become native to the speaker of that “lifestyle diglossia” in ways that those words are not “native” to the speakers of the language where these words ostensibly come from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Passmore, Ashley|title=In the New German, English is a "lifestyle diglossia"|url=http://www.60pages.com/in-the-new-german-english-is-a-lifestyle-diglossia/|access-date=2014-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714233341/http://www.60pages.com/in-the-new-german-english-is-a-lifestyle-diglossia/|archive-date=2014-07-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Du-reformen''''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈdʉː reˈfɔrmən}}, ''the you-reform'') was the process in the late 1960s of popularization of the [[Grammatical person|second-person]] [[singular number|singular]] [[pronoun]] ''du'' as a universal form of address in [[Sweden]]. The use of ''[[wikt:du#Swedish|du]]'' ([[cognate]] with English ''[[thou]]'', French ''tu'', and German ''du'') replaced an intricate former system where people chiefly addressed each other in third person, with or without a preceding Mr./Mrs./Ms. ''(herr, fru ''or'' fröken)'' before the title, often omitting both [[surname]] and given name. Less respectfully, people could be addressed with Mr./Mrs./Ms. plus surname, or in a family setting, alternatively even less respectfully, with the plain name or third person pronoun ''han'' ("he") or ''hon'' (she).

Before ''du-reformen,'' it was considered impolite to address most people without an appropriate title, although a subordinate could be addressed by name, or less respectfully as ''Ni'' or ''han/hon.'' The informal ''du'' had been used for addressing children, siblings, close friends and possibly for [[cousin]]s, but hardly for elder relatives. Members of [[Free church]]es, [[Good Templars]] and the like considered each other as siblings, and may well have used ''Du'' in that setting.

With exception for [[dialect]]al usage, the second person plural pronoun ''Ni'' had long been considered degrading when used to address a single person. However, the usage varied between different parts of the country, and as well by social context, both before and after the reform. 

[[Finland-Swedish]] has undergone a similar development, but slower and slightly less due to influence of the somewhat more conservative usage in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. In particular, the use of second person plural ''(Ni)'' to address an unknown person is considered respectful or neutral rather than degrading.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
In the Swedish of Sweden, the polite ''ni'' was known from earlier epochs, but had come to be considered careless, bullying or rude; instead, an intricate system had evolved in order to prudently step around pronouns almost altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sweden.se/eng/Home/Education/Swedish-language/Reading/How-the-Swedish-language-lost-its-formality/ |title=How the Swedish language lost its formality |last=Hellström |first=Elin |author= |date=Jun 7, 2011 |year= |department= |website=sweden.se |series= |publisher=[[Swedish Institute]] |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120911224725/http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Education/Swedish-language/Reading/How-the-Swedish-language-lost-its-formality/ |archive-date=2012-09-11 |dead-url=yes |access-date=Feb 1, 2017 |quote=Previously, the proper way to address people of the same or higher social status had been by title and surname. Colleagues spoke to each other in a more formal way at the office, asking if  “Accountant Olsson could send the invoice” or if “Managing Director Johnsson would mind postponing the meeting.” The use of herr (mr), fru (mrs) or fröken (miss) was considered acceptable in initial conversation with strangers of unknown occupation, academic title or military rank. |ref= |postscript= |subscription= |registration= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Addressing in third [[person (grammar)|person]] singular adding '''title and surname''' was considered proper and respectful in most cases. But with persons of higher standing, say a doctor, count or managing director, there arose the question when to use that title only and when to precede it with a ''herr'' ('mister' or, in this context, 'sir'); not doubling such titles could be very rude unless you were on somewhat informal terms.  A woman, married to a husband with a specific title, was addressed using the ''feminine form of her husband's title'' as a matter of course. This created its own set of problems as more and more women acquired professional titles of their own.

*If two persons were somewhat acquainted and not too far apart in rank and age, they could then drop the name and use the '''title only'''. 

*'''Surname without title''' was considered proper between friends not too close and for a superior to his subordinate or someone of similar rank. That was also customary in male brotherhoods like between students.

*Below that on the social scale, both among peers and from above, was the '''third person singular pronoun only''' (''han'' 'he', ''hon'' 'she'). That was more usual in the countryside; considered rustic by "educated" people, but fitting towards e.g. an old fisher- or woodman.

*Simple folks of venerable age could be properly addressed '''father/mother/aunt plus Christian name''' ''(far/mor/moster)'', both by their own, by other villagers and by superiors. A farmwife could be addressed as ''mor'' even if young; otherwise, one had to make do with the nearest-fitting other way of addressing.

*A master could address his servant, and a farmer his farmhand, by '''Christian name in the third person'''; that was more common between females, as the female world was generally more confined, but more restricted between the sexes. A subordinate, in each case, answered by using the superior's title or, in private, the informal term for his rank (e.g. ''herrn'', ''patron'').

*The proper '''kinship term plus Christian name''', still never alternating with pronoun, was proper in private to nearer relatives.

The second person singular ''du'' was used only to and between children, within a married couple, between lovers or to a more or less voluntary mistress of lower standing, and between friends who had toasted for brotherhood with each other ('toasted for thou' in a ''"du-skål"'' as it was known)—of course initiated by the elder or higher-ranked party. Again, the custom could be slightly more relaxed among women—at least the toast itself was usually dispensed with. Otherwise, ''du'' could be used to insult a tramp or the like.

Parts of this system began to erode around the Second World War or so, but the essentials held up into the late 1960s.

In the province of [[Dalarna]], however, and in a some other remote places with few upper-class people, the ''du/ni'' distinction had remained one of number only; although children addressed their parents with Father/Mother ''(Far/Mor)'' rather than a grammatically logical ''du.'' In other remote places, the ''Ni'' survived in its older form ''I'' (cognate with '[[Ye (pronoun)|ye]]') as both the second person plural pronoun and the polite address to singular elders, including one's parents, unless classified with "better people". In [[Standard language|standard]] Swedish, that form had become archaic and solemn well before the 20th century. (''I'' is capitalized to avoid confusion with a common [[homograph]], the preposition ''[[wikt:i#Swedish|i]]'' ('in'), rather than of respect.)

As the twentieth century progressed, this circumlocutive system of addressing, with its innumerable ambiguities and opportunities for unintentional offence, was increasingly felt as a nuisance. An early way out was to carry the circumlocutions one degree further—finding impersonal ways of saying what was needful, avoiding both personal pronoun and title (''Får det lov att vara en kopp kaffe?'', approximately 'Might it be a cup of coffee?'; ''Så det är till att resa?'', approximately 'So, it is about travelling?'), often using the [[passive voice]]. However, that soon proved of little avail. For one thing, you still had to address the person you talked with directly from time to time in the conversation, otherwise you would really have sounded impolite—and over time, it became ''de rigueur'' to do so more and more often, until it was a system with both longish titles used instead of personal pronouns and impersonal circumlocutions; and for another, the impersonal constructions soon acquired their own gradations, to be observant upon—e.g., that in the second example above being perceived as more and more rustic, ending up rude.

==Reform==
The beginning of ''du-reformen'' is associated with [[Bror Rexed]], the then head of the [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]] (''Socialstyrelsen''), who in his welcome speech to the staff in 1967 announced that he would address everyone as ''du'', increasing the effects of the reform and bringing it to a more frequent use. 

The actual reform had started earlier, including the amended language in the major newspaper [[Dagens Nyheter]]. It was seen as a reform in a democratic and egalitarian direction. First, authorities and influential circles had tried rehabilitating the ''Ni'' in a so-called "''ni''-reform". But most people could not bring themselves to feel civil using that. Then, in a process dubbed the "''du'' reform", the system rapidly broke down and the informal ''du'' became the accepted way of addressing any one person except royalty.

Addressing [[Swedish Royal Family]] also changed, but third person addressing still dominates in official settings. The universal ''ers majestät'' ('Your Majesty'), etc. became rare, possibly used on formal occasions, and is replaced by ''[[wikt:konung#Swedish|konungen]]'' or ''[[wikt:kung#Swedish|kungen]]'' ("the King"), ''kronprinsessan'' ("the Crown Princess"), etc. 

In parallel with ''du-reformen'', the use of [[title]]s was further reduced. In many other countries, [[professional title]]s rather than names are used to attract someone’s attention, while this is not usually the case in Sweden. Only slightly less accepted is the use of [[Christian name]] also when addressing an  acquaintance or colleague (''Daniel, Pia,'' etc.).

Since about 1990, it has become somewhat more common for retail and restaurant staff to address customers as ''ni'' (second-person plural), although this was not formerly considered formal language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ne.se/ni-tilltal Nationalencyklopedin].&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Riksdag]], where debate is conducted via the [[Speaker of the Riksdag|Speaker]], titles are frequently used, even though politicians are most often addressed as ''du'' in other contexts.

In order to "alleviate the intrusion" in writing, e.g. in letters or in advertisement, the ''Du'' can be capitalized. That usage was most widespread in the early days of universal ''du'' address; it has become slightly more common again simultaneously with the partial ''Ni'' revival.

'''Eugene Arnoľdovič Helimski''' (Russ. '''Евге́ний Арно́льдович Хели́мский''': 15 March 1950 in [[Odessa]], USSR &amp;ndash; 25 December 2007 in [[Hamburg]], Germany) — a Russian linguist (in the latter part of his life working in Germany), Doctor of Philosophy (1988), Professor.

Helimski researched [[Samoyedic languages|Samoyedic]] and [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]] languages, problems of Uralic and [[Nostratic]] linguistic affinity, language contact, the theory of genetic classification of languages, and the cultural history of Northern Eurasia and of [[shamanism]].  He became one of the world's leading specialists in Samoyedic languages.

== Biography ==
Helimski graduated from the Department of Structural and Applied Linguistics of [[Moscow State University]] (1972); completed a Dissertation on "Ancient Ugro-Samoyedic Linguistic Ties" (Tartu, 1979); completed the Doctoral Dissertation on "Historical and Descriptive Dialectology of the Samoyedic Languages" (Tartu, 1988); worked at the Institute of Slavic and Balkan Studies at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] (1978—1997); lectured at the [[Russian State University for the Humanities|RSUH]] (1992—1998), University of Budapest (1994—1995) and other European universities.  From 1998 onward, he was Professor of Hamburg University and Director of the Institute of Finno-Ugrian and Uralic Studies in Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-hamburg.de/ifuu/personal.html Faculty Page] at Hamburg University's [http://www.uni-hamburg.de/ifuu/index.html Institute of Finno-Ugrian and Uralic Studies (IFUU)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific Contributions ==
Helimski was a participant and organizer of numerous linguistic expeditions to Siberia and to the [[Taimyr Peninsula]]; field studies of all Samoyedic languages, one of the authors of the well-known "Studies on the [[Selkup language|Selkup Language]]" which were based on field studies and which have substantially broadened the linguistic understanding of Samoyedic.  He exposed a number of regularities in the historical phonetics of [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and substantiated the existence of grammatical and lexical Ugro-Samoyedic parallels.  He gathered all accessible data on [[Mator language|Mator]], the extinct South-Samoyedic language, and published its dictionary and grammar.  He proposed a number of novel Uralic, Indo-European and Nostratic etymologies, and collected a large body of material on the borrowed lexicon of the languages of Siberia (including Russian).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-05-10
|language =Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helimski proposed a number of modifications to the traditional theory of the "genealogical tree" with respect to the Uralic data, which affected comparative studies in general.

He worked on problematics of [[shamanism]] among the Samoyedic peoples, collected and published texts of shamanistic incantations.

He published several editions of "Таймырский этнолингвистический сборник" ("Taimyr Ethno-Linguistic Compendium", RSUH) and other works on Uralistics.

Helimski  initiated the development of a digital database of Uralic, which later became part of [[Sergei Starostin]]'s [http://starling.rinet.ru/babel.php?lan=en StarLing Project].&lt;ref&gt;[http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/bdescr.cgi?root=config&amp;morpho=0&amp;basename=\data\uralic\uralet The StarLing Uralic Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Feminism sidebar |concepts}}

'''Girl power''' is a [[slogan]] that encourages and celebrates [[women's empowerment]], independence, and confidence. The slogan's invention is credited to  US punk band [[Bikini Kill]], who published a [[zine]] called ''Girl Power'' in 1991.

== Early usage and origins==
[[File:Girl Power zine.jpg|thumb|left|158px|''Girl Power'' (1991), a [[zine]] that introduced the slogan to the punk lexicon.]]
[[File:01-21-2017 - Women's March on NYC (10696).jpg|thumb|Girls wearing "Girl power" sashes at the [[2017 Women's March]] in New York City]]

In 1991, US punk band [[Bikini Kill]] published a feminist [[zine]] called ''Girl Power''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/arts/music/kathleen-hanna-julie-ruin-hit-reset-interview.html |title=Kathleen Hanna on ''Hit Reset'', Her Recovery and Her Feminist Path |last=Coscarelli |first=Joe |date=July 11, 2016 |website=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band's lead singer, [[Kathleen Hanna]], said was inspired by the [[Black Power]] slogan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Sara|title=Girls to the Front|date=2010|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term became popular in the early and mid 90s punk culture. ''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll'' credits the zine with coining the slogan: "In their feminist fanzine Bikini Kill they articulated an agenda for young women in and outside of music; the band put those ideas to practice. (Ironically, the zine first coined the "girl power" slogan, later co-opted by England's [[bubblegum pop]] band the [[Spice Girls]].) Bikini Kill earned a reputation in the punk underground for confronting certain standards of that genre; for example, asking people to slam at the side of the stage, so that women would not get pushed out of the front, and inviting women to take the mike and talk about sexual abuse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/bikini-kill/biography |title=Bikini Kill Bio |website=RollingStone.com |access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is sometimes [[Sensational spelling|sensationally spelled]] ''grrrl power'', based on the spelling of ''[[riot grrrl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gonick|first=Marnina|title=Girl Culture|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn. [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-313-33909-7|pages=310–314|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arQy0v_PBx4C&amp;lpg=PA311&amp;ots=653MgneXMO&amp;dq=Riot%20Grrrls%20grrl%20power&amp;pg=PA311#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Girl Power}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Marion|title=Sexing The Groove: Popular Music and Gender|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-14670-8|pages=230–55|chapter='Rebel Girl, You Are the Queen of My World': Feminism, 'Subculture' and Grrrl Power}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other musical artists who have used the slogan in their music are Welsh band [[Helen Love]], with it appearing in the chorus of their 1992 song “Formula One Racing Girls”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/elizabeth.ercocklly/helenlov.htm |title=Helen Love - Gabba Gabba We Accept You |publisher=Homepage.ntlworld.com |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023114007/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/elizabeth.ercocklly/helenlov.htm |archivedate=2012-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and pop-punk duo [[Shampoo (band)|Shampoo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/april_2001/shampoo.html |title=Shampoo - Interview by Alexander Laurence |publisher=Free Williamsburg |date=April 2001 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; who released an album and single titled ''Girl Power'' in 1995.

== Spice Girls and scholarship ==
British pop quintet [[Spice Girls]] popularized the slogan in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2008/01/from-title-ix-to-riot-gr.html  |title=From Title IX to Riot Grrrls |publisher=Harvard Magazine |date=January–February 2008 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/38786.stm |title=Girl power &amp;#124; You've come a long way baby |publisher=BBC News |date=December 30, 1997 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sarler, Carol |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-396834/Girl-Power-betrayed-us.html |title=Girl Power: how it betrayed us |publisher=Daily Mail |date=21 July 2006 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her 2002 book ''[[Girl Heroes|Girl Heroes: The New Force in Popular Culture]]'', Professor Susan Hopkins suggests a correlation between ''girl power'', Spice Girls, and [[Action hero#Female action heroes|female action heroes]] at the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Costi, Angela |url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2002/22/power_chicks/ |title=Super Slick Power Chicks: The New Force or Elaborate Parody? |publisher=Senses of Cinema |date=October 4, 2002 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geri Halliwell]], a member of the Spice Girls, credited former Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], a leading conservative, as the pioneer of their ideology of girl power.&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Evans and Tara Brabazon, "I'll never be your woman: the Spice Girls and new flavours of feminism." ''Social Alternatives'' 17#2 (1998): 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/spice-girls-too-hot-to-handle-19970710 |title=Spice Girls: Too Hot to Handle |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=10 July 1997 |accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slogan has also been examined within the context of the academic field, for example [[Buffy studies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thirdspace.ca/articles/karras.htm "The Third Wave's Final girl: Buffy the Vampire Slayer"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050620082403/http://www.thirdspace.ca/articles/karras.htm |date=June 20, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Media theorist Kathleen Rowe Karlyn in her article "Scream, Popular Culture, and Feminism's Third Wave: I'm Not My Mother"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Karlyn |first=Kathleen Rowe |url=http://www.genders.org/g38/g38_rowe_karlyn.html |title=Scream, Popular Culture, and Feminism's Third Wave: I'm Not My Mother |publisher=Genders |year=2003 |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612004031/http://www.genders.org/g38/g38_rowe_karlyn.html |archivedate=2012-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Irene Karras in "The Third Wave's [[Final girl]]: [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]" suggest a link with [[third-wave feminism]]. Frances Early and Kathleen Kennedy in the introduction to ''Athena’s Daughters: Television’s New Women Warriors'', discuss what they describe as a link between girl power and a [[List of women warriors in literature and popular culture|"new" image of women warriors]] in popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Riley |first=Robin |url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=238391094059727 |title=Review of Early, Frances; Kennedy, Kathleen, eds., Athena's Daughters: Television's New Women Warriors |publisher=H-Net Reviews |date=May 2004 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Oxford English Dictionary''===
A 2001 update to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defined ''girl power'' as:

{{quote|Power exercised girls; spec. a self-reliant attitude among girls and young women manifested in ambition, assertiveness, and individualism. Although also used more widely (esp. as a slogan), the term has been particularly and repeatedly associated with popular music; most notably in the early 1990s with the briefly prominent "riot grrrl" movement in the United States (cf. RIOT GIRL n.); then, in the late 1990s, with the British all-female group The Spice Girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00307048?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=girl+power&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 |title=OED:Girl power |publisher=Oxford English Dictionary |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The dictionary further offers an example of this term by quoting from "Angel Delight", an article in the March 24, 2001 issue of ''Dreamwatch'' about the television series ''[[Dark Angel (2000 TV series)|Dark Angel]]'':

{{quote|After the [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connors]] and [[Ellen Ripley]]s of the 1980s, the 1990s weren't so kind to the superwoman format&amp;mdash;[[Xena]] Warrior Princess excepted. But it's a new 2000 millennium now, and while ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]'' and ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' are kicking up a storm on movie screens, it's been down to [[James Cameron]] to bring empowered female warriors back to television screens. And tellingly, Cameron has done it by mixing the sober feminism of his ''[[The Terminator|Terminator]]'' and ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' characters with the sexed-up girl power of a [[Britney Spears]] concert. The result is ''Dark Angel''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkangelfan.com/news/254.shtml E y e s &lt;-&gt; &lt;-&gt; O n l y&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105035505/http://www.darkangelfan.com/news/254.shtml |date=2008-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Criticism===
Dr. Debbie Ging, Chair of the BA in Communications Studies in [[Dublin City University]], was critical of the "Girl power" ideals, and linked it to the sexualisation of younger children, girls in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Ging, Debbie. [http://webpages.dcu.ie/~gingd/pdf/SexualisationOfChildren.pdf "''Girl Power" doesn’t empower: why it’s time for an honest debate about the sexualisation of children in Ireland''] July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Amy McClure of [[North Carolina State University]] warns against placing too much hope on girl power as an empowering concept. She says, “An ideology based on [[consumerism]] can never be a revolutionary social movement. The fact that it appears to be a revolutionary movement is a dangerous lie that not only marketers sell to us but that we often happily sell to ourselves.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p108568_index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131183249/http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p108568_index.html |date=January 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Media can sometimes present a narrow definition of what it means to be a girl today. One common example being popular toys such Mattel's [[Barbie]]. The recent “I can be” Barbie&lt;ref&gt;http://icanbe.barbie.com&lt;/ref&gt; embodies this concept of “girl power”: that little girls can be anything they want when they grow up. Arguably, Barbie's image may also present narrowed options with which girls can identify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Lamb | first1 = Sharon | last2 = Brown | first2 = Lyn Mikel | authorlink1 = Sharon Lamb |authorlink2=Lyn Mikel Brown| title = Packaging Girlhood: rescuing our daughters from marketers' schemes | publisher = St. Martin's Griffin | location = New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780312370053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hannah Jane Parkinson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' criticized the term as something "young women [that] are feeling more confident about calling themselves feminists and standing up for principles of equality" hide behind and denounced it for including the word "girl", claiming it promoted the calling of adult women as girls.&lt;ref name="tgljaja"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/08/stop-calling-women-girls-its-either-patronising-or-sexually-suggestive | title=Stop calling women 'girls'.

'''Hawkman (Katar Hol)''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]]. He is the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Bronze Age]], and [[New 52]] '''[[Hawkman]]'''. Created by [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Joe Kubert]], he first appeared in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #34 (February–March 1961). There are two versions of Katar Hol, the Silver Age/[[Pre-Crisis]] version and the post-''[[Hawkworld]]''/[[Post-Crisis]] version.

==Publication history==
The Silver Age '''Hawkman (Katar Hol)''' was first introduced in ''The Brave and the Bold'' #34 by artist Joe Kubert and writer Gardner Fox. At this time DC had already rebooted many of its characters such as the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], and [[Green Lantern]]. Hawkman's first appearance sold well and spawned five more tryout issues in ''The Brave and the Bold''. During these issues, he teamed up with his wife, [[Hawkwoman|Hawkgirl]], to battle foes on earth as well as on his home planet [[Thanagar]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Brave and the Bold'' #34-36, #42-44 (1961-1962)&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Brave_and_the_Bold_36.jpeg|thumb|left|The Brave and the Bold #36 (1961). Art by [[Joe Kubert]]]]

After Hawkman had concluded his appearances in ''The Brave and the Bold'', he starred in a side strip within ''[[Mystery in Space]]''. He appeared in four issues of this series, and teamed up with [[Adam Strange]] in some of these adventures.&lt;ref&gt;''Mystery in Space'' #87-90 (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Hawkman was given a bi-monthly solo title. [[Murphy Anderson]] took over the art for this series with Gardner Fox continuing as writer. Hawkman occasionally teamed up with [[The Atom (Ray Palmer)|The Atom]] and Adam Strange in his title. Together, Hawkman and Hawkgirl battled such enemies as the [[Matter Master]], the [[Shadow Thief]], and [[Lion-Mane]]. Hawkman's comic book would continue for less than five years before it was canceled at issue #27.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkman'' vol. 1 #1-27 (1964-1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

After declining sales forced the cancellation of his solo magazine, Hawkman teamed up with the Atom and starred in ''The Atom and Hawkman'' for seven issues. This series was canceled as well.&lt;ref&gt;''The Atom and Hawkman'' #39-45 (1969-1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 70s and early 80s, Hawkman continued to appear as a member of the [[Justice League of America]], which he had joined back in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' #31 (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; He also made regular appearances in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' and ''[[Detective Comics]]'', along with a three-issue story in the pages of ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]''. It was not until the mid-80s when Hawkman received his own title again. In 1986, DC pulbished a four-part miniseries called, ''The Shadow War of Hawkman''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Shadow War of Hawkman'' #1-4 (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the decent sales of this series, Hawkman received another monthly solo series. It lasted seventeen issues and one ''Special'' before it, too, was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkman'' vol. 2 #1-17 and ''Special'' #1 (1986-1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, [[Timothy Truman]] decided to reboot the Silver Age Hawkman in a three-book series titled ''[[Hawkworld]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkworld'' books #1-3 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; This was the start of the post-''Hawkworld'' version of Katar Hol. While this series was originally meant to just be a retold origin of Hawkman, it spawned yet another Hawkman series. In 1990 DC created the ''Hawkworld'' monthly series. This series had two volumes, but was eventually canceled.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkworld'' vol. 1-2 (1990-1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid 90s–2010s Hawkman would have more on-and-off series. However, none of them were of much importance. With all of the different series, Hawkman had been part of, his origin and story had become rather complicated and confusing. At the end of his 3rd series, Hawkman was physically dissolved into nothing.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkman'' vol. 3 (1993-1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Hawkman came back, but this time, rather than being the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[policeman]] that he was in the previous series, he was [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Carter Hall]], the reincarnated Egyptian prince. However this added even more complexity to Hawkman, and the series was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkman'' vol. 4 (2002-2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Silver Age Hawkman was rebooted again as part of ''[[The New 52]]'' reboot. His new comic book was titled ''The Savage Hawkman''. Although this Hawkman was the most simple version of the complex character, the series sold poorly and ended after twenty issues.&lt;ref&gt;''The Savage Hawkman'' #0-20 (2011-2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Hawkman returned again as part of the ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' relaunch, in a series titled ''The Death of Hawkman'', which concluded after six issues.&lt;ref&gt;''The Death of Hawkman'' #1-6 (2016-2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

A new ''Hawkman'' title, by Robert Venditti and Bryan Hitch, debuted in June 2018. However this series concerned Carter Hall the reincarnated Egyptian prince version of Hawkman rather than Katar Hol, or Silver Age version of the character.

==Fictional character biography==

===Silver Age version===
'''Katar Hol''' was the imperial prince of his home planet of [[Thanagar]].  His father was Paran Katar, renowned ornithologist and inventor.
When Katar Hol was eighteen, an alien race called the [[Manhawks]] invaded Thanagar and began looting the planet.  Paran sent young Katar Hol to infiltrate their nest and bring back information on the aliens.  Using this information, Paran created a hawk-like battle suit containing advanced technology like his "[[Nth metal]]".  Katar used this hawk-suit and Paran's advanced weaponry to drive the Manhawks away from Thanagar.

That, however, was not the end of the problem.  Some Thanagarians had learned the concept of stealing from the Manhawks.  Due to the amount of crime, the Thanagarian government created a police force.  In honor of Paran Katar and his achievements, the new police force began using his hawk-suit and equipment.  Paran headed this new police force, named the Hawk-Police (or [[Wingmen of Thanagar|Wingmen]]), and his son became one of the first recruits.

Katar soon became one of the most skilled of the Hawk-Police.  When a group called the Rainbow Robbers began committing crimes, Katar was teamed up with rookie [[Shayera Hol|Shayera Thal]] to track and apprehend the criminals.  During the case, Shayera saved Katar's life, and the two soon fell in love.  A few weeks later, Katar proposed to Shayera and the two got married, working together as partners-for-life in the Hawk-Police.

After ten years of marriage and in the force, the pair were sent to [[Earth]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Brave and the Bold'' #34 (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; to capture the shape-shifting Thanagarian criminal [[Byth]]. During their mission, they meet George Emmett, commissioner of the [[Midway City]] Police Department, and told him their alien origin. With Emmett's help, the pair took over his retiring brother Ed's place as [[museum]] curators. They adopt the identities as Carter and Shiera Hall. After capturing him and sending him back to Thanagar, they elected to remain on Earth to work with authorities to learn human police methods. The two acted publicly as the heroes '''Hawkman''' and [[Shayera Hol|Hawkgirl]] (later Hawkwoman).
[[Image:KatarHol.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The Silver Age Katar Hol in ''Hawkman'' # 12 (February–March 1966). Art by [[Murphy Anderson]].]]
The rest of Hawkman's supporting cast consist of [[Mavis (DC Comics)#Hawkman|Mavis Trent]], museum naturalist and diorama artist who flirts with Katar; Joe Tracy, the museum's publicist; his commanding officer Andar Pul; a large red hawk named Big Red who lives in nearby Hawk Valley; and teenage orphan Charley Parker, the [[Golden Eagle (comics)#Pre-Crisis|Golden Eagle]].  Katar gained a variety of unique villainous opponents such as the [[Shadow Thief]], the [[Matter Master]], Ira Quimby (I.Q.), Konrad Kaslak, Chac, the Raven, the Criminal Alliance of the World (or C.A.W.), [[Lion-Mane]], [[Kanjar Ro]], [[Hyathis]], the [[Fadeaway Man]], and the [[Gentleman Ghost]].

Katar joined the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]], where he befriended the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]]. As Hawkman was a conservative, he frequently verbally sparred with his fellow Leaguer [[Green Arrow]], a left-wing liberal.

Hol left the Justice League for a time when Thanagar was hit by the Equalizer Plague, which caused all Thanagarians to change so that their physical and mental talents, and even their heights, became the same. With the help of the JLA, he was eventually able to reverse the effects of the plague.

However, in the wake of the plague, Thanagar adopted an expansionist outlook, and went to war with the planet [[Rann]], which orbits [[Alpha Centauri]]. This forced Katar and Shayera to choose to fight for or against their own planet, and they elected to oppose Thanagar, becoming exiles on Earth. Around this time, Shayera herself joined the JLA, and took the name Hawkwoman.

Following the truce between Thanagar and Rann, Thanagar began to secretly try to take over the Earth. Hol opposed their efforts in a furtive "secret war" for several years.

Following the events of DC's miniseries, ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', the histories of Earth-One and Earth-Two are merged. As a result, both Golden Age and Silver Age versions of Hawkman and [[Hawkgirl]]/Hawkwoman live on the same Earth. Initially, the Silver Age Hawkman and Hawkwoman were kept in continuity unchanged. They took Superman to Krypton (now a gas planet),&lt;ref&gt;''Superman'' (volume 2) #18 "Return to Krypton"&lt;/ref&gt; briefly joined [[Justice League International]], teamed-up with Atom,&lt;ref&gt;''Power of the Atom'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; and helped [[Animal Man]] defuse a Thanagarian bomb during ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion]]''. However, DC reversed this decision and [[reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] Hawkman continuity after the 1989 ''[[Hawkworld]]'' miniseries. Originally, ''Hawkworld'' retold the origins of the Silver Age Hawkman and Hawkwoman, but following its success, DC Comics launched a ''Hawkworld'' ongoing series set in the present, resulting in a complete reboot of Hawkman continuity. By doing so, several continuity errors regarding Hawkman and Hawkwoman's Justice League appearances needed to be fixed.

===Post-''Hawkworld'' version===
Katar Hol was [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]ed in 1989 in the prestige format [[mini-series]] ''Hawkworld'' by [[Timothy Truman]]. A regular ongoing series of the same name followed from 1990–1993, which was then followed up by ''Hawkman'' (vol. 3) from 1993-1996.

[[Image:Hawks Nolan.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Katar Hol and Shayera Hol. Art by [[Graham Nolan]].]]

In this new version '''Katar Hol''' was a young police officer on the planet Thanagar, and a child of a privileged family being the son of Paran Katar. Thanagar was a planet which conquered and mined other worlds for their resources to maintain its high standard of living, and Hol realized that this was wrong. He rebelled against the system and favored the old days of Thanagar. He became a student of history and archaeology, and admired Thanagar's legendary hero Kalmoran. Hol became addicted to a recreational drug, and was manipulated by the renegade police captain Byth into killing his own father, and was sent into exile in the Isle of Chance.

During that time, he found one of the island residents in robes fashioned a pair of wings.  Katar, disillusioned, killed him and took his wings.  He learned the wings were meant for Hol and that the robed man had natural wings on his back.  Horrified on what he has done, the brother of the man he killed helped him deal with withdrawal symptoms from his drug addictions and he made peace with himself.

When his sentence was up, Hol was sent to Downside.  However, he managed to escape and uncover and defeat Byth, who had gained shape-shifting abilities. As a result, he was reinstated in the force and given a new partner, Shayera Thal - a young woman from a lower class of society.

Just after [[Hawkman (Fel Andar)|Fel Andar]] left Earth, Katar and Shayera were sent to Earth, where they served as goodwill ambassadors for their home planet and remained for some time fighting both human and [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] criminals in places like Chicago's [[Netherworld (DC Comics)|Netherworld]]. Dubbed by the press as '''Hawkman III''', Katar and Shayera, Hawkwoman II, had a tempestuous working relationship, and eventually, Shayera broke away from Katar, who continued alone.

Katar met [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Carter Hall]] and [[Hawkgirl#Golden Age|Shiera Sanders]] who returned from Asgard with the rest of the [[Justice Society]]. He learns that his father came to Earth during [[World War II]], under the alias "Perry Carter".  The Golden Age Hawks, Carter and Shiera Hall, were friends with Paran, and were the inspiration of the Wingmen. In one adventure, Carter took an injured Katar to be healed by an old friend, a Cherokee shaman named Naomi ("Faraway Woman"). Katar discovers that she had known Paran Katar, his father.  She and Paran fell in love, and the two eloped with the Halls serving as witnesses. Thus, Naomi is his birth mother and Katar is a hybrid Human-Thanagarian.

During the ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' event, Katar Hol was merged with Carter, Shiera, and a "hawk god" creature in a new Hawkman version—a living avatar of the hawk god who adventured for a brief time, continuing to prey on criminals and deal out his own brand of fierce justice. He later went insane (tormented by the voices of all the previous hawk-avatars in his head), until he was eventually banished to Limbo by the combined skills of [[Arion (comics)|Arion]] and the [[Martian Manhunter]].

Because of Carter Hall's return from the dead prior to ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', it has been stated that Katar Hol's soul dissipated from the Limbo/Realm of the Hawk God and is now deceased. Carter Hall currently inhabits a reconstructed version of Katar Hol's post-Zero Hour body, which mostly resembles Carter Hall, but with darker hair and a more barbaric frame.

===''The New 52'' version===
As part of DC's 2011 company-wide title relaunch, ''[[The New 52]]'', Katar Hol was re-established as the DCU's Hawkman, using the name Carter Hall. His origin has yet to be fully explained since he appears to not know his alien heritage, believing himself to be human. Issue #0 explains that Katar Hol was once a proud member of the [[Thanagarian]] race, adopted son of their king Thal Provis and lover to the princess [[Shayera Thal]]. Unlike other Thanagarians, he was a pacifist; desiring to find an end to centuries of war, he convinced the king to hold a peace conference. However the [[Daemonites]] took advantage of this to spread a deadly disease that quickly destroyed all Thanagarians' wings and killed their king. The new ruler, son of Provis and Katar's adoptive brother, Corsar, came to believe that only the [[Nth Metal]] could save them, but this desire for power sacrificed hundreds of lives, which was apparently rewarded when Katar was accidentally fused with it creating a full body armor and regenerating his wings. But seeing his brother's increasing insanity, Katar refused to let the metal power be distributed, leading to fighting between them and the death of Corsar. Shayera then vows to hunt down Hawkman, also blaming him for her father's death. He runs away in a stolen ship that ends up crashing on earth.&lt;ref&gt;''Savage Hawkman'' #0&lt;/ref&gt; During the ''Rotworld'' storyline Animal Man travels to a post-apocalyptic future where he is attacked by a Rot-corrupted Hawkman; this version is killed by [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|Steel]], [[Beast Boy]] and [[Black Orchid (comics)|Black Orchid]].&lt;ref&gt;''Animal Man'' #13 (October 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death of Hawkman ===
{{expand section|date=August 2017}}
Thanagarians attack the royal house of Rann and seemingly murder Sardath. Because of these actions, Adam Strange is not able to travel to Rann. We later find out that these actions are all a deliberate plan arranged by the antagonist. When Adam finally gets to Rann, he finds out from his wife Alanna that Thanagarians are behind the attack. Adam does not believe this because of his relationship with his JLA teammate, Katar Hol (Hawkman), who is from Thanagar. With assistance from Hawkman, Adam Strange determines that the real culprit is Despero. Using his psionic powers, Despero is able to control the minds of the citizens of Rann, Thanagar and Kalanor to incite skirmishes. His main goal is to steal the Nth metal resources and attack Earth with the Zeta crystals. A final major battle with Strange, Hawkman and Despero ensues. Hawkman sacrifices himself by expelling all the Nth metal in his body through the head of Despero. Strange destroys the Zeta crystals, causing an explosion. The aftermath shows that Adam Strange gets trapped in a wrinkle in space-time. Despero is cast to the edge of the universe along with the skeleton of Hawkman.

In the 2018 ''Hawkman'' series, [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Carter Hall]] uses a mystic artifact to reveal all of his past lives, suspecting there are gaps in his memories. Katar Hol is revealed to have been one of his prior reincarnations, despite the fact that the two had been alive simultaneously. This causes Hall to realize that he is reincarnating across space as well as time. On Dinosaur Island, Hall finds an ancient artificial cave carved into a mountain, guarded by Fetherians, a tribe of Stone Age winged humanoids. Upon entering the cavern, Hall is transported to Thanagar in the past and encounters Katar at a point in his life prior to traveling to Earth. Katar assumes Hall is his nemesis, the shape-shifting Byth, and the two Hawkmen engage in an aerial chase through the city before ending up on a gigantic statue of Thanagar's mythical hero, Kalmoran. Carter is able to get Katar to listen and convinces him of their common nature. Katar, who has been having similar visions, realizes that Hall's next clue is located on the statue.

==Other versions==
The Silver Age Katar Hol has made some appearances in out-of-continuity series.
* In [[Alex Ross]]' Silver Age-toned ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'', Katar Hol is a member of the Justice League; he is married to Shayera - also a member of the Justice League and works as a curator of the Midway City Museum. He is mostly referred to as "Carter", even by Shayera. In the climax of the series, he wears a suit of armor that resembles the Hawk-God.  He also appears in ''Secret Origins'' and ''Liberty and Justice'', tabloid-sized comics also by Alex Ross.
* Katar and Shayera are featured in the [[Elseworlds]] three-part [[prestige format]] [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''Legend of the Hawkman'' (2000).

* Katar is featured with Shayera in ''Scooby-Doo! Team-Up'' #33. He resembles the Joseph Gardner Hawkman from the DC Animated Universe. Like Carter Hall, Katar is a reincarnation of Prince Khufu, and have been reborn as Silent Knight and Nighthawk.

Katar Hol appeared in [[DC animated universe (comics)|''Superman &amp; Batman Magazine'' #5]], wearing a uniform resembling the Post-''[[Hawkworld]]'' version.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Hawkman's first animated appearance was in the 1967 [[Filmation]] animated series ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'', in which Hawkman appeared in several shorts, either in solo adventures or as part of the Justice League.
* Hawkman has appeared as a Super Friend in ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'', ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'', ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'', and ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]''. His voice was provided by [[Jack Angel]]. Hawkman appears in almost every episode of ''Challenge of the Superfriends'', but has spoken lines in only thirteen out of the sixteen episodes of this series.
* Hawkman was featured in the ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' TV specials in 1979, portrayed by Bill Nuckols.
* '''Hro Talak''' (anagrams to Katar Hol) is Hawkgirl's original commander and lover in ''[[Justice League]]'' voiced by Victor Rivers. A Thanagarian general greatly resembling Hawkman, he offers to help Earth defend itself against a Gordanian invasion. The Thangarians' true aim proves to be building a massive device called a hyperspace bypass, the last in a chain that will allow Thanagarian ships to warp past Gordanian defenses; however, when they do so, the energy released will wipe out all life on Earth, something that Commander Talak does not desire but considers an acceptable sacrifice necessary to win their long-running war with the Gordanians. After they are thwarted, a later episode featuring Talak's crew reveals that he died saving them.
* Katar Hol appears in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', voiced by [[James Remar]]. This version is amalgamated with Carter Hall. He's portrayed as an archeologist who was born '''Joseph Gardner''' and changed his name to Katar Hol when he discovered an Egyptian temple with a device that he believed allowed him to relive the memories of a deceased Thanagarin warrior who crash-landed on Earth with his mate. They were worshiped as gods and used their technology to improve the land. Katar believed that he was the reincarnation of the warrior, who was murdered when he and his mate were poisoned by a rogue official. Katar also believed that Shayera Hol, aka Hawkgirl of the Justice League, was the reincarnation of his lover, to the point that he became somewhat of a stalker. However, Shayera insisted he simply believed what he wanted to believe, and the actual truth was different. In the end, Katar accepted Shayera's reluctance to go with him and he moved on, continuing to believe she would be with him again one day. In his second appearance, he is shown as a hero operating out of Midway City, Katar's Silver Age home on Earth. He is still infatuated with Shayera, which annoys the Green Lantern a lot. When the Shadow Thief escapes from his body and captures the Green Lantern, Katar, Shayera, and Vixen try to rescue him but fail. The Thief then reveals the Green Lantern is also reincarnated from Egypt, as the general who betrayed Katar by seducing Shayera. The Thief also reveals he is the dark side of the reincarnated Katar and offers him the chance to reclaim Shayera by murdering the Green Lantern, which he agrees to do. Then Katar frees Shayera and the Green Lantern before forcing the Thief back into his body. Shayera insists the device the Thief used to tell his tale was a defective history log and can't be trusted. Katar acknowledges that he can't force Shayera to accept what he knows as destiny and leaves. He reappears briefly in the final episode, Destroyer, to go out and battle the invading forces of Darkseid.
* Hawkman first made a cameo on ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' in the season-four finale "The Joining, Part Two" and appeared in the episode "What Goes Up...", voiced by [[Robert Patrick]].  While not identified by name, a comment made about the Batcave looking like police headquarters on Thanagar and the comments on all of the villains he fought on 2 worlds indicates that he's Katar Hol.
* The Kator Hol Hawkman appears as a member of the JLA in  ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' animated series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = G-Man | title =Comic-Con: Brave and the Bold &amp; Young Justice Panel | publisher = Comic Vine | date =2010-07-24 | url =http://www.comicvine.com/news/comic-con-brave-and-the-bold-young-justice-panel/141716/ | accessdate = 2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Professor Helena Sandsmark''' is [[DC Comics]] [[fictional character]] created by writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] for the ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' comic book series, first appearing in ''Wonder Woman'' Vol 2 #105. The mother of the second incarnation of [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl, Cassandra Sandsmark]] and a distinguished academic in the field of archaeology, Helena is also close friends with her daughter's mentor [[Wonder Woman]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Post Zero Hour Introduction===
Helena (and her daughter, [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Cassie/Wonder Girl]]) are introduced in the revised DC Universe created after the ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time]]'' storyline.

Helena studied archeology at [[Harvard University]] under [[Julia Kapatelis]], and was one of her brightest students. After graduation, she participated in several digs around the world, including one in [[Greece]], where she made an important discovery that made her famous in her profession.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Girl'' (vol. 1) #4, Feb. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On the merits of her work in Greece and a recommendation from Julia, Helena was awarded a job as curator at the Gateway City Museum of Antiquities, the museum with the largest collection of Greek artifacts outside of Greece. She was the youngest archeologist ever to hold such a position. 

Helena met a man whom she later found out was the Olympian god [[Zeus (DC Comics)|Zeus]]. She eventually became pregnant with his [[demigod]]ess child, but he had disappeared from her life by the time she gave birth to Cassie. Helena had raised Cassie alone without revealing the identity of her father or her divine parentage.

Julia sent her friend [[Wonder Woman]] to Gateway City, so she could study at the museum. While there, Diana befriended Helena and her daughter. Helena had also entered into a short-lived relationship with [[Etrigan the Demon|Jason Blood]], a visiting occultist, though she was unaware of his other side at the time. As Diana attracted more and more attention from enemies, Helena became concerned for her daughter. However, she was surprised when Zeus granted her daughter powers. Her former mate also granted Helena the power to remove Cassie's powers by speaking one word, effectively grounding her when she needed to. When Cassie found out Zeus was her father, the revelation nearly destroyed the relationship between mother and daughter.

Around the time Diana left Gateway City, Helena had finally made amends with Cassie and granted her blessing to continue as Wonder Girl with the understanding that she’d be well trained in combat by [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]]. Helena also supervised her daughter’s membership in the superhero team Young Justice but openly objected to the fact that Cissie “[[Arrowette]]” Jones-King’s mother Bonnie encouraged her daughter’s participation without regard to the potential dangers. At one point, Helena even judged Bonnie’s behavior to be so dangerous that she kept Cissie with her and Cassie in Gateway City. Helena remained there for Cassie in the troubled months that folflowed, adjusting when Wonder Girl’s true identity was publicly revealed by the [[Silver Swan (comics)|Silver Swan]], mending fences when the teen learned that Zeus was her father, and consoling her daughter after her boyfriend Superboy was killed during the Infinite Crisis.

During the Amazons Attack incident, Wonder Girl and Supergirl attempted to negotiate an end to the war between the Amazons and the United States but inadvertently made things worse when the president of the United States was killed. Helena was deemed a collaborator by the US government and sent to an internment camp, leading Cassie to mount an attempted rescue. At her mother’s insistence that the situation be settled peacefully, Wonder Girl finally departed.

In the war’s wake, Wonder Girl and her mother were viewed with a wary eye. Leaving the Gateway Museum, Helena took a sabbatical in Greece and used the Gauntlet of Atlas and Sandals of Hermes to keep her safe. They proved invaluable when she was abducted by the Female Furies and an ensorcelled Hercules. When the latter attacked Wonder Girl, Helena astonished her daughter by sending the demigod reeling with one punch powered by the godly gauntlet. The adventure also reunited Helena with her old friend Aristides Demetrios, who was known as [[Olympian (comics)|The Olympian]] and had protected Helena during the young archaeologist's pregnancy.

Helena later joined fellow archeologists Vijay and Rani Singh for an dig in Mohenjo-Daro, Pakistan. When Vijay and Rani both mysteriously disappeared, Helena called the Teen Titans for help. Upon arriving, the Titans joined Kiran Singh – the brilliantly super-powered Solstice – in the search for her parents. But the team soon found itself trapped in a lost kingdom as they were attacked by the Hindu god King Rankor and his demonic minions. In the most brilliant display of her powers to date, Solstice unleashed a blinding pulse that drove the demons away, liberating Helena and the Singhs from King Rankor’s grasp.

===The New 52===
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Cassie's father is a British super-soldier named Lennox Sandsmark, who turns out to be Wonder Woman's half-brother and himself a demigod son of Zeus. Lennox left the family when Cassie was only four years old,&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' Vol 4 #13 (December 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; so Helena (again) raised Cassie alone without revealing the identity of her father or her divine parentage. Teenaged Cassie meets [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]],&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' (vol. 4) #2&lt;/ref&gt; joins the [[Teen Titans]] and eventually learns that she is the demigoddess niece of Wonder Woman.&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' Vol 4 #19 (June 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hopefully''''' is an [[adverb]] which means "in a [[hope]]ful manner" or, when used as a [[Disjunct (linguistics)|disjunct]], "it is hoped".  Its use as a disjunct has prompted controversy among advocates of [[linguistic purism in English|linguistic purism]] or [[linguistic prescription]].&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, John Ellison and Robert Ilson, Eds. ''The Right Word at the Right Time: A Guide to the English Language and How to Use It'', pp. 27–29. London: The Reader's Digest Association Limited, 1985. {{ISBN|0276384393}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use as a disjunct ==
''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' says the disjunct sense of ''hopefully'' dates to the early 18th century and had been in fairly widespread use since at least the 1930s.  Objection to this sense of the word only became widespread in the 1960s.  ''Merriam-Webster'' says that this usage is "entirely standard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Hopefully | website=Online Dictionary | url=http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=hopefully |publisher= Merriam-Webster |accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before 2012,  the ''[[AP Stylebook]]'' proscribed the use of "hopefully" as a disjunct.&lt;ref name="BBC2012"/&gt; 

The controversy over its use is similar to those surrounding words or phrases such as "[[begging the question]]", "[[wikt:bemused|bemused]]", "[[wikt:nauseous|nauseous]]", [[Who (pronoun)|"who" vs. "whom"]] and the loss of the distinction between "disinterested" and "uninterested."&lt;ref name="BBC2012"/&gt; The use of "hopefully" as a disjunct is reminiscent of the usage of the German word ''[[wikt:hoffentlich|hoffentlich]]'' ("it is to be hoped that").

[[File:RIAN archive 667778 May 18th - International Museum Day.jpg|thumb|People visiting the [[Pushkin Museum|Pushkin Fine Arts Museum]] on International Museum Day]]
'''International Museum Day''' (IMD) is an [[international observances|international day]] a celebration that held every year on or around [[18 May]], coordinated by the [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM). The event highlights a specific theme that changes every year and that is at the heart of the international museum community’s preoccupations.

The IMD provides the opportunity for museum professionals to meet the public and alert them as to the challenges that museums face. Indeed, following the definition of museums provided by ICOM, a museum is ''a non-profit, permanent institution in the service of society and its development, open to the public, which acquires, conserves, researches, communicates and exhibits the tangible and intangible heritage of humanity and its environment for the purposes of education, study and enjoyment''.{{cn|date=August 2018}} International Museum Day therefore serves as a platform to raise public awareness on the role museums play in the development of society today, on an international level.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==History==
Each year, all museums in the world are invited to participate in IMD to promote the role of museums around in the world, creating unique, enjoyable and free activities around a theme discussed within the ICOM community for this special day. 
Since its creation in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icom.museum/events/international-museum-day/|title=ICOM Website on IMD|publisher=''icom.museum''}}&lt;/ref&gt; International Museum Day has gained increasing attention. In 2009, International Museum Day attracted the participation of 20,000 museums hosting events in more than 90 countries. In 2010, 98 countries participated in the celebration, with 100 in 2011, and 30,000 museums in 129 countries in 2012.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} In 2011, the official IMD poster was translated into 37 languages. Since 2012, this number jumped by one to 38.

====Special activities during IMD 2012====
In many countries, International Museum Day is the occasion to celebrate museums and their activities. For instance, each year, the month of May is Museums Month in [[Guatemala]], organised with the Ministry of Culture of Guatemala. This year, the theme was ''New challenges and new inspirations''.

In [[Lithuania]], the year 2012 was declared as the Year of Museums,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.muziejai.lt/Aktualijos/aktualijos.en.htm|title=Museum Year in Lithuania|year=2012|publisher=''muziejai.lt''}}&lt;/ref&gt; in honour of the bicentenary opening of the first public museums in the country.

The Museu do Falso ([[Viseu]], [[Portugal]]) opened on 18 May 2012, for International Museum Day. Visitors were able to discover the unique Museum of History, made from contributions by contemporary artists, working under the premise of ''Simulacrum: What if a given event occurred differently from how it did?''. This aimed to serve as a hub for cultural actors and citizens.

In [[Côte d’Ivoire]], IMD 2012 was celebrated in the structure of the Palais Royal of Abenguru. Local institutions and ICOM Côte d’Ivoire organised various events including discussions, game contests for students and guided tours. About 1,500 people joined in the celebrations with important political and cultural actors from the country. 

Hans-Martin Hinz, President of ICOM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icom.museum/the-governance/hans-martin-hinz/|title=Hans-Martin Hinz was elected President of ICOM|year=2010|publisher=''icom.museum''}}&lt;/ref&gt; launched the event from [[Bahrain]], with the visit to the National Museum’s exhibition ''[[Tylos]]: Journey Beyond Life'' that recounted burial rites and customs in the ancient history of Bahrain. He then experienced the mobile museum ''Enkiru'', an extension of the exhibition specifically geared for children aged 7 to 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=329438|title=Hans-Martin Hinz celebrated IMD 2012 in Bahreïn|year=2012|publisher=''Gulf Daily News''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, he participated in a workshop devoted to emerging museum professionals organised by the National Committee of Bahrain, in partnership with ICOM Arab. Meanwhile, the ICOM President personally thanked Chinese and Argentine museums by sending them a video, broadcast during the launch ceremonies for International Museum Day in [[China]] and [[Argentina]]. 

To celebrate the event, [[Julien Anfruns]], Director General of ICOM, delivered the keynote address on the 17 May at the conference "Science Museums and New Technologies” organized by the ICOM International Committee for Education and Cultural Action (CECA) in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. He was also a panellist and keynote speaker at the [[International Bar Association]]’s conference about new legal challenges in the arts which took place at the [[MAXXI – National Museum of the 21st Century Arts]], Rome).

'''Jacquetta Hawkes''' (5 August 1910 &amp;ndash; 18 March 1996) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[archaeologist]] and writer.

Born '''Jessie Jacquetta Hopkins''', the daughter of [[Nobel Prize]]-winning scientist Sir [[Frederick Gowland Hopkins]],&lt;ref name=Cooke224&gt;{{Cite book|title = Her Brilliant Career - Ten Extraordinary Women of the 1950's|last = Cooke|first = Rachel|publisher = Virago|year = 2013|isbn = 9781844087419|location = Great Britain|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; she married first [[Christopher Hawkes]], then an assistant keeper at the British Museum, in 1933. From 1953, she was married to [[J. B. Priestley]]. She is perhaps best known generally for her book ''A Land'' (1951).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Macfarlane |first1=Robert |title=Rereading: A Land by Jacquetta Hawkes |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/11/rereading-a-land-jacquetta-hawkes |accessdate=2 July 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a prolific writer on subjects quite removed from her principal field. She was above all interested in discovering the lives of the peoples revealed by scientific excavations. With Christopher Hawkes, she co-authored ''Prehistoric Britain'' (1943) and with J. B. Priestley she wrote ''Dragon's Mouth'' (1952) and ''Journey Down a Rainbow'' (1955). Her other works include ''The World of the Past'' (1963), ''Prehistory (History of Mankind: Cultural and Scientific Development, Volume 1 Part 1)'' (1963) prepared under the auspices of [[UNESCO]], ''The Atlas of Early Man'' (1976) and ''The Shell Guide to British Archaeology'' (1986). She also scripted a film ''[[Figures in a Landscape (1954)|Figures in a Landscape]]''.&lt;ref name=Cooke250&gt;{{Cite book|title = Her Brilliant Career - Ten Extraordinary Women of the 1950's|last = Cooke|first = Rachel|publisher = Virago|year = 2013|isbn = 9781844087419|location = Great Britain|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeological research ==

Hawkes was the first woman to study archaeology and anthropology at [[Newnham College, Cambridge]], where she graduated with first class honours. In 1934 she published her first academic article "Aspects of the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods in western Europe" in the journal [[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]].&lt;ref name=Cooke230&gt;{{Cite book|title = Her Brilliant Career - Ten Extraordinary Women of the 1950's|last = Cooke|first = Rachel|publisher = Virago|year = 2013|isbn = 9781844087419|location = Great Britain|pages=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939 she was involved with moving items from the British museum to the [[Aldwych tube station]].&lt;ref name=Cooke233&gt;{{Cite book|title = Her Brilliant Career - Ten Extraordinary Women of the 1950's|last = Cooke|first = Rachel|publisher = Virago|year = 2013|isbn = 9781844087419|location = Great Britain|pages=233–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 she produced the Origins of People display at the [[Festival of Britain]].&lt;ref name=Cooke243&gt;{{Cite book|title = Her Brilliant Career - Ten Extraordinary Women of the 1950's|last = Cooke|first = Rachel|publisher = Virago|year = 2013|isbn = 9781844087419|location = Great Britain|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her general work on the [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]] (''Dawn of the Gods'', 1968), Hawkes was also one of the first archaeologists to suggest that the ancient Minoans might have been ruled by women; the idea had been discussed long before by historians of culture and religion (for instance, [[Joseph Campbell]]), and outside of the academic community, sometimes by [[feminism|feminists]]. Hawkes noted that very little if any evidence of a Minoan male ruler exists, whereas abundant evidence of such rulers existed among the [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ians, [[Hittites]], [[Assyr]]ians and other Minoan contemporaries. Furthermore, images of strong and powerful women abound in Minoan art, where both men and women are shown provocatively and elegantly dressed and in some pictures seem to move on equal terms; whereas in Egyptian, Assyrian and classical Greek art, human women (as distinct from goddesses) are never shown as the equals of males. Hawkes stated that "the absence of these manifestations of the all-powerful male ruler that are so widespread at this time and in this stage of cultural development as to be almost universal, is one of the reasons for supposing that the occupants of Minoan thrones may have been queens" (''Dawn of the Gods'', page 76).

She noted the evident love of nature, both wild and cultivated, in Minoan art and architecture. She also noted the lack of a striving for monumentality in Minoan palaces, and the absence of war and motives dramatizing a sense of destiny, guilt and brooding. She contrasts Minoan art and architecture to the heavy, foreboding and warlike architecture of Mycenae and the strong presence of themes of fate, martial heroism and moral guilt in later Greek mythology, some of the stories of which must, in an early form, already have existed at Mycenae (as well as similar motives in Babylonian literature, e.g., in the [[Gilgamesh epic]]). Although we do not know anything of the specific content of Minoan myth and folklore, themes of the kind mentioned - war, destiny, guilt, curses - do not even seem to be alluded to in the art of the period, as also noted by Hawkes. This perspective on the differences between Crete and Mycenaean Greece has remained controversial but has also spurred discussion about Minoan Crete, its religion, the nature of its monarchy and the wider set of relations between Minoan, Mycenaean and later Greek cultures.

==  Personal life ==

She met Christopher Hawkes, her senior, on a dig during her studies at Cambridge, and married him when she was 22.&lt;ref name=Cooke227 /&gt; Their only son, Nicholas, was born in 1937.&lt;ref name=Cooke227&gt;{{Cite book|title = Her Brilliant Career - Ten Extraordinary Women of the 1950's|last = Cooke|first = Rachel|publisher = Virago|year = 2013|isbn = 9781844087419|location = Great Britain|pages=227–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wartime affair with the poet [[Walter J. Turner|Walter Turner]] was followed by a post-war romance with J. B. Priestley, whom she married in 1953 after both had divorced. Hawkes and Priestley remained physically, emotionally and intellectually close until their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Cook, ''Priestley'', London: Bloomsbury, 1997, pp. 213–298.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 she was involved with the founding of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]].&lt;ref name=Cooke251&gt;{{Cite book|title = Her Brilliant Career - Ten Extraordinary Women of the 1950's|last = Cooke|first = Rachel|publisher = Virago|year = 2013|isbn = 9781844087419|location = Great Britain|pages=251–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3755">[[File:Janez_Bernik_1969.jpg|thumb|Janez Bernik (1969)]]
'''Janez Bernik''' (6 September 1933 – 15 July 2016) was a multiple-time awarded and internationally acclaimed Slovenian painter and academic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delo.si/kultura/vizualna-umetnost/umrl-slikar-in-akademik-janez-bernik.html|title=Umrl slikar in akademik Janez Bernik|work=delo.si|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernik was born in the village of [[Gunclje]], now part of [[Ljubljana]]. After finishing the [[Crafts School (Ljubljana)|Crafts School in Ljubljana]], from 1951 until 1955, Bernik attended the [[Academy of Fine Arts in Ljubljana]], where he was a pupil of [[Maksim Sedej]]. From 1956 to 1958, he continued his studies with the professors of graphic design [[Božidar Jakac]] and [[Riko Debenjak]], and on a number of study travels (Italy, France...). From 1958 to 1969, he worked as a freelance artist, and in 1970 started teaching as a professor of drawing and painting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Ljubljana. From 1979 to 1996, when he retired, he was a full professor and the head of the Painting Department of the Academy. He was member of the [[Group 69]] and participated at all its exhibitions. In 1989, he was named an associate member of the [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts]], and in 1993 became its full member. He was an external [[corresponding member]] of [[Accademia di San Luca|Accademia di san Luca in Rome]], and from 1996, a regular member of the [[European Academy of Sciences and Arts]]. He died in [[Prebold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/janez-bernik-745|title=Janez Bernik - Tate|work=tate.org.uk|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernik was a versatile artist, who reached excellent results in [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[graphic design]], [[illustration]], [[tapestry]], [[book design]], and [[poetry]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} His graphic prints are kept in numerous worldwide-known galleries and collections. He had over 60 independent exhibitions, including at the main galleries of the former Yugoslavia, Klagenfurt, Milan, Rome, Paris, Berlin, New York... Several times, he also participated at the [[Venice Biennale]], as well as at a number of group exhibitions at home and abroad. He published four independent [[graphic folder]]s. His poems were published in two collections; the first one in the monograph ''Lines'' ("Črte"), and the second one, ''Triptych'' ("Triptih"), in the catalogue ''1985&amp;nbsp;Exhibition '' ("Razstava&amp;nbsp;1985") and the ''[[Nova revija (magazine)|New Magazine]]'' ("Nova revija").

Of the domestic awards, of particular importance are the [[Prešeren Fund Award]] for painting and graphic design&amp;nbsp;(1963), [[Jakopič Award]] for painting&amp;nbsp;(1971), and [[Prešeren Award]]&amp;nbsp;(1981), whereas as to international awards, he received a number of honorary awards and golden medals for painting and graphic design. His works are kept by Slovenian galleries (Ljubljana, Maribor, Ajdovščina, and Idrija) and by galleries and museums in most of larger European cities (London, Vienna, Prague, Zagreb, Warsaw, Paris, Rome, Amsterdam). Many of his works are also kept in the Northern and Southern Americas (San Francisco, Washington, New York, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro), and even Japan (Tokio).

'''Jewish emancipation''' was the external (and [[Jewish Enlightenment|internal]]) process in various nations in [[Europe]] of eliminating [[Disabilities (Jewish)|Jewish disabilities]], e.g. [[Jewish quota]]s, to which [[European Jew|Jewish people]] were then subject, and the recognition of Jews as entitled to equality and [[citizenship]] rights on a communal, not merely individual, basis.&lt;ref name=mjl&gt;{{cite news|author=Eli Barnavi|title=Jewish Emancipation in Western Europe |url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history/Modern_History/1700-1914/Emancipation_and_Enlightenment/In_the_West.shtml|accessdate=25 September 2013|newspaper=My Jewish Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2016}} It included efforts within the community to integrate into their societies as citizens. It occurred gradually between the late 18th century and the early 20th century. Jewish emancipation followed the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the concurrent [[Haskalah|Jewish enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Shmuel Ettinger|title=Jewish Emancipation and Enlightenment|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history/Modern_History/1700-1914/Emancipation_and_Enlightenment.shtml|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various nations repealed or superseded previous discriminatory laws applied specifically against [[Jews]] where they resided. Before the [[Political emancipation|emancipation]], most Jews were [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|isolated]] in residential areas from the rest of the society; emancipation was a major goal of European Jews of that time, who worked within their communities to achieve [[Social integration|integration]] in the majority societies and broader education. Many became active politically and culturally within wider European [[civil society]] as Jews gained full citizenship. They emigrated to countries offering better social and economic opportunities, such as the [[Russian Empire]] and [[France]]. Some European Jews turned to [[Socialism]], others to Jewish nationalism: [[Zionism]].

==Background==
[[File:Royal decree proclaiming the emancipation of the Jews, France, 1791 - Musée d'art et d'histoire du Judaïsme.jpg|thumb|The 1791 law proclaiming the Emancipation of the Jews - [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme]]]]

Jews were subject to a wide range of restrictions throughout most of European history. Since the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] in 1215, Christian Europeans required Jews and Muslims to wear special clothing, such as the [[Judenhut]] and the [[yellow badge]] for Jews, to distinguish them from Christians. The practice of their religions was often restricted, and they had to swear special oaths (see [[Oath More Judaico]]). Jews were not allowed to vote, where vote existed, and some countries formally prohibited their entry, such as Norway, Sweden and [[History of the Jews in Spain|Spain]] after the expulsion in the late 15th century.

In contrast, in 1264, the Polish [[Bolesław the Pious|Prince Boleslaw the Pious]] issued the "[[Statute of Kalisz]]" – The General Charter of Jewish Liberties in Poland, an unprecedented document in medieval history of Europe that allows Jews personal freedom, legal autonomy and separate tribunal for criminal matters as well as safeguards against forced baptism and blood libel. The Charter was ratified again by subsequent Polish Kings: [[Casimir the Great]] of Poland in 1334, [[Casimir IV of Poland]] in 1453, and [[Sigismund I the Old]] of Poland in 1539. After massive expulsions of Jews from Western Europe (England, France, Germany, and Spain), they found a refuge in the lands of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. During the [[Jagiellon]] Era Poland became the home to Europe's largest Jewish population, as royal edicts warranting Jewish safety and religious freedom from the 13th century contrasted with bouts of persecution in Western Europe, especially following the [[Black Death]] of 1348–1349, blamed by some in the West on Jews themselves. Large parts of Poland suffered relatively little from the outbreak, while the Jewish immigration brought valuable manpower and skills to the rising state. The greatest increase in Jewish numbers occurred in the 18th century, when Jews came to make up 7% of the Polish population.

The rabbinate was the highest goal of many young Jewish men, and the study of the [[Torah]] (the first five books of the Bible) and the [[Talmud]] was the means to obtain the coveted position.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar |History}}

Jewish involvement in gentile society began during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. [[Haskalah]], the Jewish movement supporting the adoption of enlightenment values, advocated an expansion of Jewish rights within European society. Haskalah followers advocated "coming out of the [[ghetto]]", not just physically but also mentally and spiritually.

On September 28, 1791, [[French revolution|revolutionary France]] became the second country of the world, after Poland 500 years earlier, to emancipate its Jewish population. The 40,000 Jews living in France at the time were the first to confront the opportunities and challenges offered by emancipation. The civic equality which the French Jews attained became a model for other European Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Paula E. Hyman, ''The Jews of Modern France'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Newfound opportunities began to be provided to the Jewish people, and they slowly pushed toward equality in other parts of the world. In 1796 and 1834, the Netherlands granted the Jews equal rights with gentiles. Napoleon freed the Jews in areas he conquered in Europe outside France (see [[Napoleon and the Jews]]). Greece granted equal rights to Jews in 1830. But, it was not until the revolutions of the mid-19th century that [[Jewish political movement]]s would begin to persuade governments in Great Britain, Central and Eastern Europe to grant equal rights to Jews.&lt;ref name=jvl&gt;{{cite web |title=EMANCIPATION |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0006_0_05916.html |work=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |access-date=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emancipation movements==
The early stages of Jewish emancipation movements were part of the general progressive efforts to achieve freedom and rights for minorities. While this was a movement, it was also a pursuit for equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Judaism|last=Nicholas|first=de Lange|last2=Freud-Kandel|first2=Miri|last3=C. Dubin|first3=Lois|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=30–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the emancipation movement would be a long process.  The question of equal rights for Jews was tied to demands for constitutions and civil rights in various nations. Jewish statesmen and intellectuals, such as [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Johann Jacoby]], [[Gabriel Riesser]], [[Berr Isaac Berr]], and [[Lionel Nathan Rothschild]], worked with the general movement toward liberty and political freedom, rather than for Jews specifically.&lt;ref name=ohio.edu/&gt;

In 1781, the Prussian civil servant [[Christian Wilhelm von Dohm|Christian Wilhelm Dohm]] published the famous script ''Über die bürgerliche Emanzipation der Juden''. Dohm disproves the antisemitic stereotypes and pleads for equal rights for Jews. Till this day, it is called the ''Bible of Jewish emancipation''.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Stollberg-Rilinger: Europa im Jahrhundert der Aufklärung. Stuttgart: Reclam, 2006 (2nd edition), 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of persistent [[anti-Jewish]] incidents and [[Blood libel against Jews|blood libels]], such as the [[Damascus affair]] of 1840, and the failure of many states to emancipate the Jews, Jewish organizations formed to push for the emancipation and protection of their people. The [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]] under [[Moses Montefiore]], the [[Central Consistory]] in Paris, and the ''[[Alliance Israelite Universelle]]'' all began working to assure the freedom of Jews.

Jewish emancipation, implemented under Napoleonic rule in French occupied and annexed states, suffered a setback in many member states of the [[German Confederation]] following the decisions of the [[Congress of Vienna]]. In the final revision of the Congress on the rights of the Jews, the emissary of the [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]], [[Johann Smidt]] - unauthorised and unconsented to by the other parties - altered the text from "The confessors of Jewish faith are preserved the rights already conceded to them '''in''' the confederal states", by replacing a single word, which entailed serious consequences, into: "The confessors of Jewish faith are preserved the rights already conceded to them '''by''' the confederal states."&lt;ref&gt;In the German original: "Es werden den Bekennern des jüdischen Glaubens die denselben '''in''' ['''von''', respectively] den einzelnen Bundesstaaten bereits eingeräumten Rechte erhalten." Cf. [[Heinrich Graetz]], ''Geschichte der Juden von den ältesten Zeiten bis auf die Gegenwart'': 11 vols., Leipzig: Leiner, 1900, vol. 11: 'Geschichte der Juden vom Beginn der Mendelssohnschen Zeit (1750) bis in die neueste Zeit (1848)', p. 317. Emphasis not in the original. Reprint of the edition  revised by the author: Berlin: Arani, 1998, {{ISBN|3-7605-8673-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of German states used the altered text version as legal grounds to reverse the Napoleonic emancipation of Jewish citizens. The Prussian emissary [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] and the Austrian [[Klemens von Metternich]] promoted the preservation of Jewish emancipation, as maintained by their own countries, but were not successful in others.&lt;ref name="ohio.edu"&gt;Sharfman, Glenn R.,  [http://www.ohio.edu/chastain/ip/jewemanc.htm Jewish Emancipation], in [http://www.ohio.edu/chastain/contents.htm Encyclopedia of 1848 Revolutions]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Revolutions of 1848]], Jewish emancipation was granted by the Basic Rights of the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] (Paragraph 13), which said that civil rights were not to be conditional on religious faith. But only some German states introduced the Frankfurt parliamentary decision as state law, such as Hamburg; other states were reluctant. Important German states, such as [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] (1812), [[Kingdom of Württemberg|Württemberg]] (1828), [[Electorate of Hesse]] (1833), and [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]] (1842), had already emancipated their Jews as citizens. By doing so, they hoped to educate the gentiles, and terminate laws which sought to oppress the Jews.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although the movement was mostly successful; some early emancipated Jewish communities continued to suffer persisting or new ''de facto'', though not legal, discrimination against those Jews trying to achieve careers in public service and education. Those few states that had refrained from Jewish emancipation were forced to do so by an act of the [[North German Federation]] on 3 July 1869, or when they acceded to the newly [[German Empire|united Germany]] in 1871. The emancipation of all Jewish Germans was reversed by [[Nazi Germany]] from 1933 through [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=jvl/&gt;

==Dates of emancipation==
In some countries, emancipation came with a single act. In others, limited rights were granted first in the hope of "changing" the Jews "for the better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friends-partners.org/partners/beyond-the-pale/eng_captions/21-5.html |title=THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN ANTI-SEMITISM: images pg.21 |publisher=Friends-partners.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==

===The emancipation and the practice of Judaism===
{{editorial|date=September 2016}}The emancipation disrupted the relationship the Jews had with their religion, which could not govern any longer all the actions in their lives. Many considered a practice of Judaism more closely to the lifestyle of their non-Jewish fellow citizens. The emancipation in France, Italy, Germany, at least during the Empire, permitted many Jews to leave the ghettos and contribute, as a result of the [[Haskalah]], to the development of [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] during the 19th century. The emancipation contributed moreover to the assimilation of Jews and sometimes to their cultural disappearance when Jews merged through marriage in the surrounding society. It was not until Rabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] defined a modern vision of orthodox Judaism, enabling orthodox Jews to participate fully in a society.&lt;ref name=jvl/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2016|reason=SR Hirsch's movement is not discussed in source}}{{ clarify | date = January 2016 | reason =sentence is a grammatical fragment, thought incomplete }} Ultimately, emancipation immersed the Jews into a new culture. In doing so, Jews were able to not only see themselves as members of a religious sect, but also as citizens within society. At the same time, however, some {{who|date=September 2016}} were concerned that leaders within the Jewish movement were seeking to position Judaism with an approach catered toward a new Western civilization.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Judaism|last=C.

'''Latin American Muslims''' are [[Muslims]] from countries in [[Latin America]].

== Statistics ==
[[file:2017 Bogotá calle 80 con carrera 30 - mezquita Central Abou Bakr Alsiddiq.jpg|200px|thumb|The Mosque of Abou Bakr Alsiddq in [[Bogotá]].]]
Quoted from "Muslims in Latin America" by Muhammad Yusuf Hallar - ''"According to statistics, the number of muslims in Latin America is over four million, serving as an example 700,000 (seven hundred thousand) in Argentina and more than 1,500,000 (one point five million) in Brazil."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamawareness.net/LatinAmerica/adosimpo.html Muslims in Latin America by Muhammad Yusuf Hallar]&lt;/ref&gt; Based on other estimates the Muslims in the area of Latin America are 100,000 mainly concentrated in Brazil, El Salvador and Argentina but also there are concentrations in Venezuela, Colombia and Paraguay. Most of these Latin American Muslims are from either Lebanese or Syrian origin.

== Organizations ==

Many Muslim organizations exist in Latin America, such as the [[Islamic Organization of Latin America]] (OIPAL). OIPAL is considered the most active organization in Latin America in promoting Islamic affiliated endeavors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14821">[[Discordianism|Discordian]] works include a number of books, [[Ergodic literature|not all of which actually exist]]. Among those that have been published are ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', first published in 1965 (which includes portions of ''The Honest Book of Truth''); and ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'', which had its first volume published in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cosmic Trigger I: The Final Secret of the Illuminati]]'' (1977), page 167. {{ISBN|1-56184-003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early works==
Works by members of the original Discordian Society.

===''Principia Discordia''===
{{main|Principia Discordia}}
''Principia Discordia'' is a [[Discordianism|Discordian]] [[religious text]] written by [[Gregory Hill (writer)|Greg Hill]] ([[Malaclypse the Younger]]) and [[Kerry Thornley]] (Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst). It was originally published under the title ''Principia Discordia or How the West was Lost'' in a limited edition of five copies in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Malaclypse and Ravenhurst: ''Principia Discordia'', page 00075&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Illuminatus!'' Trilogy===
{{main|The Illuminatus! Trilogy}}
One of the most influential of all Discordian works, ''The Illuminatus! Trilogy'' is a [[trilogy|series of three novels]] written by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]] purportedly between 1969 and 1971,&lt;ref name=written&gt;''Illuminatus!'' was written between 1969 and 1971, but not published until 1975 according to Robert Anton Wilson, ''[[Cosmic Trigger I: The Final Secret of the Illuminati]]'' (1977), page 145. {{ISBN|1-56184-003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and first published in 1975. The trilogy is a [[satire|satirical]], [[postmodernism|postmodern]], [[science fiction]]-influenced adventure story; a [[Psychoactive drug|drug]]-, [[human sexuality|sex]]- and [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]-laden trek through a number of [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], both historical and imaginary, which hinge on the authors' version of the [[Illuminati]]. The narrative often switches between [[Narrator#Third person|third]] and [[Narrator#First person|first person]] perspectives and jumps around in time. It is thematically dense, covering topics like [[counterculture]], [[numerology]] and [[Discordianism]].

In a 1980 interview given to the science fiction magazine ''Starship'', Wilson suggested the novel was an attempt to build a myth around Discordianism:
{{quote|We felt the [Discordian] Society needed some opposition, because the whole idea of it is based on conflict and [[dialectics]]. So, we created an opposition within the Discordian Society, which we called the Bavarian Illuminati [...] So, we built up this myth about the warfare between the Discordian Society and the Illuminati for quite a while, until one day Bob Shea said to me, "You know, we could write a novel about this!"&lt;ref name="starship"&gt;[http://www.rawilsonfans.com/articles/Starship.htm "Robert Anton Wilson: Searching For Cosmic Intelligence" by Jeffrey Elliot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614022635/http://www.rawilsonfans.com/articles/Starship.htm |date=2006-06-14 }} Interview discussing novel . Retrieved 21 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''Zen Without Zen Masters''===
''Zen Without Zen Masters'' is a book by Camden Benares (The Count of Five), published in 1977, of [[koans]], stories and exercises of a Discordian nature.  It includes tales of several early Discordians including Hill (as Mal) and Thornley (as Omar and Ho Chi Zen).  "Enlightenment of a Seeker" from this book is also present in ''[[Principia Discordia]]'' as "A Zen Story".&lt;ref name="clutterbuck2014"&gt;Brenton Clutterbuck, "Discordian Works [Citation Needed]" (March 15, 2014), http://historiadiscordia.com/discordian-works/ Retrieved 14 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malaclypse and Ravenhurst: "Principia Discordia", page 00005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Camden Benares: ''Zen Without Zen Masters'' (1977), pages 40-41. {{ISBN|978-1-56184-073-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are references to this story in ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'', as well.

=== ''Zenarchy'' ===
''Zenarchy'' was first self-published by Thornley, under the pen name Ho Chi Zen, as a series of one-page (or ''broadsheet'') newsletters in the 1960s,.&lt;ref name="groover"&gt;{{cite news | first = Joel | last = Groover | title = Kerry Thornley, philosopher, writer, friend of Oswald  | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?s_hidethis=no&amp;p_product=AT&amp;p_theme=at&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=Kerry%20Thornley&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(Kerry%20Thornley)&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=11&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no| format = fee required | work = [[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] | page = F8 | date = 1998-12-03 | accessdate = 2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A selection of the material was later reedited and expanded by Thornley and republished in paperback by IllumiNet Press in 1991. The book describes Thornley's concept of Zenarchy "a way of Zen applied to social life. A non-combative, non-participatory, no-politics approach to anarchy intended to get the serious student thinking." &lt;ref&gt;Kerry Thornley, "Zenarchy" (1991), {{ISBN|0962653411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Summa Universalia''===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Discordianism]] --&gt;
''Summa Universalia'' was another work by [[Malaclypse the Younger]], purported to be a summary of the Universe. It was excerpted in the first edition of ''Principia'' but never published. It was mentioned in an introduction to one of the ''Principia'' editions, and the work was quoted from in the first edition.&lt;ref&gt;"By no means is the Principia our only scripture. All along Greg has been writing what he says is a summary of the Universe, but evidently it will be quite some time before he completes it." Thornley, Kerry: "Principia Discordia", page ix. Illuminet Press, 1991.  As quoted at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/principia/intro5.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malaclypse and Ravenhurst: ''Principia Discordia'', pages 2, 10, A14."Excerpted from a treatise concerning The Nature of Gods and The Eristesque Movement, to be found in the SUMMA UNIVERSALIA, the Holy Work of MALACLYPSE (THE YOUNGER), K.C., Omniscient Polyfather of Virginity-in-gold, and High Priest of The Heretic Fringe and Protestant Persuasion of the ERISIAN MOVEMENT of the DISCORDIAN SOCIETY "  As found at http://appendix.23ae.com/pd1/17.html, http://appendix.23ae.com/pd1/25.html , http://appendix.23ae.com/pd1/14.html .&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest known fragment of the text is the ''Myth of Ichabod'' (alluded to as the "Myth of Starbuck" in the 4th edition of the ''Principia'') which was circulated independently.&lt;ref&gt;Malaclypse and Ravenhurst: ''Principia Discordia'', edition in possession by the National Archives and Records Administration. "For a more complete dissertation on The Principles, see "The Cosmology" in the incompleted Holy Work of Malaclypse (The Younger), H.C., Summa Universalia ("A Summation of the Universe) which is probably not yet available. Also, for a more complete rendition of The Eristesque Principle in particular, read his "Myth of Ichabod", included in the same Holy Work but also distributed alone on occasion [sic]."&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Honest Book of Truth''===
In addition to ''Summa Universalia'', ''[[Principia Discordia]]'' also included selections from [[Kerry Thornley|Kerry Wendell Thornley]]'s writings, which he named ''The Honest Book of Truth''. These sections are clearly marked, and are subtitled in [[parody]] of the [[bible]]'s books.

''The Honest Book of Truth'' was for a long time not available to the general public, but a copy of it was published in ''Historia Discordia''.

Selections from this work can also be found within ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Shea, Robert and Wilson, Robert Anton: ''The Illuminatus! Trilogy'', pages 7, 141, 217, 657. Dell Publishing, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later works==

===''Apocrypha Discordia''===
''Apocrypha Discordia'' was compiled by Rev. DrJon Swabey, later known as His Holiness The Rev. DrJon, and published in 2001.  Steve Jackson and Reverend Loveshade had previously considered publishing a book by the name suggested by Russel Dalenberg on the [[usenet]] group rec.games.board.&lt;ref name="principia_intro"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=Steve |title=Principia Discordia (introduction) |year=1994 |publisher=Steve Jackson Games|isbn=978-1556343209 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apocrypha_appendix&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appendix.23ae.com/apocrypha/ |title=The Apocrypha Discordia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book contains material by both original and later Discordians and is illustrated by Pope Phil Wlodarczyk III. It was translated into German as ''Apocrypha Diskordia''&lt;ref name="a_diskordia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weird.gmxhome.de/principia/apocrypha2de.html|title=Apocrypha Diskordia |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because of it DrJon with Adam Gorightly were chosen to write an "outroduction" to a hardback edition of ''Principia Discordia''.

===''The Black Iron Prison''===
''The Black Iron Prison'' was an effort to create an updated, modern book that would function as ''Principia Discordia'' did when released. The collaborators stated that "while the original ''Principia Discordia'' holds important messages and philosophies, we wondered if some of the humor and language might be dated and lost on a younger generation of Discordians. We wanted to crystalize some of our favorite themes from the ''Principia'', those of radical free will and self-emancipation."  The goal was to encourage "critical thinking and self awareness" in the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackironprison.com/index.php?title=Main_Page|title=The Black Iron Prison|website=www.blackironprison.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Black Iron Prison'' has influenced Discordian communities in various parts of the world.&lt;ref name="clutterbuck2014"/&gt;

===''Liber Malorum: Children of the Apple''===
''Liber Malorum'' is the 2007 anthology put together by [[Sean Scullion]] and released on Paganarchy Press. Self-described as 'The Greatest Slice of collaborative magical fiction since the Bible', it gets increasingly Discordian as the reader journeys through the pages. It tells the story of innocent and heartbroken Bernadette who, upon trying to discover why her boyfriend left her, finds herself in a bizarre world of 'Witchcraft, Discordianism, Anarchy and Apples'.  [[Liber Malorum]] features  notable contributions from [[Ramsey Dukes]], [[Jaq D. Hawkins]], [[David Blank]], [[Orryelle Defenestrate]] and others. Significantly to Discordians, there are 23 contributing authors in total.

===''Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia: The Tales of Shamlicht''===
''Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia: The Tales of Shamlicht'' by Reverend Loveshade with "foreplay" or foreword by [[S. John Ross (game designer)|S. John Ross]] was published in 2012 by Anaphora Literary Press.&lt;ref name="anaphora"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anaphoraliterary.com/catalogue/new-age/reverend-loveshade/|title=Anaphora Literary Press: Reverend Loveshade |publisher=Anaphora Literary Press| year=2012 |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversial book reportedly was inspired by an investigation by the [[FBI]] with portions of the book having been previously seized. ''Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia'' includes blurbs (short reviews of the book) by [[Robert Crumb|R. Crumb]], [[Sondra London]], [[Alan Moore]], [[Ivan Stang|Rev. Ivan Stang]], [[Robert Anton Wilson]] (who saw an early draft), and others.&lt;ref name="ek-sen-trik-kuh"&gt;{{cite book |last=Loveshade |first=Reverend |title=Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia: The Tales of Shamlicht |year=2012 |publisher=Anaphora Literary Press|isbn=978-1937536183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyrob"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assets.nybooks.com/media/ipl/independents.pdf |title=Independent Press Listing |publisher=New York Review of Books |date=2013-01-10 |accessdate=2013-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124014839/http://assets.nybooks.com/media/ipl/independents.pdf |archivedate=2013-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was listed in January 2013 in both the print and online version of the ''New York Review of Books''.&lt;ref name="nyrob"/&gt;  The book was soon pulled from publication after allegations of plagiarism were made on amazon.com and sent to the publisher.  An editor denied the claims which did not specify what material was allegedly plagiarized.&lt;ref name="anaphora" /&gt;&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ek-sen-trik-kuh-Discordia-The-Tales-Shamlicht/dp/1937536181/|title=Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia |publisher=amazon.com |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher stated, "In part, I took the book out of print because I was receiving harassing phone calls and emails with threat of harm via “discordian” jakes, and my phone was infected with a virus with a Discordian flavor."&lt;ref name="faktorovich"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://absolutewrite.com/forums/showthread.php?266844-Anaphora-Literary-Press&amp;p=8218649&amp;viewfull=1#post8218649/|title=Anaphora Literary Press |publisher=Absolute Write |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Historia Discordia''===
''Historia Discordia'' was compiled by Adam Gorightly with foreword by Robert Anton Wilson.&lt;ref name="amazon_historia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Historia-Discordia-Adam-Gorightly/dp/1618613219/|title=Historia Discordia |publisher=RVP Press| year=2014 |accessdate=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a compilation of early Discordian photos, tracts, art collages, and more including works by Discordianism founders [[Gregory Hill (writer)|Greg Hill]] ([[Malaclypse the Younger]]) and [[Kerry Thornley]] (Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst).&lt;ref name="goodreads_historia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22529332-historia-discordia|title=Historia Discordia |publisher=RVP Press| year=2014 |accessdate=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, it contains the long-missing ''The Honest Book of Truth'' and the first edition of ''Principia Discordia''.&lt;ref name="red_dirt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reddirtreport.com/rustys-reads/book-review-historia-discordia-adam-gorightly|title=BOOK REVIEW: "Historia Discordia" by Adam Gorightly |author=Griffin, Andrew W. |publisher=Red Dirt Report| date=August 6, 2014 |accessdate=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reviewed on goodreads.com, and features a blurb by famed comic book writer Alan Moore.&lt;ref name="goodreads_historia" /&gt;

===''Principia Entropius''===
''Principia Entropius'' is a gathering of material from early Discordian message boards of the 1990s. Brenton Clutterbuck describe the book as "a terrible mess that makes one’s head hurt", but also as "a rare and valuable (historically if not creatively) snapshot of Discordianism in the 90s".&lt;ref name="clutterbuck2014"/&gt;

[[Sweden]] is home to the most inscribed sites with 15 sites, two of which are transborder properties. Three sites are shared between several countries: the [[Curonian Spit]] ([[Lithuania]] and [[Russia]]), the [[High Coast]] / [[Kvarken Archipelago]] (Sweden and Finland) and the [[Struve Geodetic Arc]] (ten countries in Northern and [[List of World Heritage Sites in Eastern Europe|Eastern Europe]]).&lt;ref name=list&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list |title=World Heritage List |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first sites from the region were inscribed in 1979, when the [[Urnes Stave Church]] and [[Bryggen]], both in Norway were chosen a year after the list's conception.&lt;ref name="SitebyYear"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;l=en&amp;action=stat&amp;mode=table#s4 |title=Number of World Heritage properties inscribed each Year |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="origlist"&gt;{{Cite report |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0003/000347/034793eb.pdf |format=PDF |title=Intergovernmental Committee for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, Second Session, Final Report |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |date=5–8 September 1978 |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |pp=7&amp;ndash;8 |accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, UNESCO's [[World Heritage Committee]] may inscribe new sites on the list, or delist sites that no longer meet the criteria.

Many fires, the last in 1955, have ravaged the characteristic wooden houses of Bryggen. Its rebuilding has traditionally followed old patterns and methods, thus leaving its main structure preserved, which is a relic of an ancient wooden urban structure once common in Northern Europe.

|Founded in 1773 in South Jutland, the site is an example of a planned settlement of the Moravian Church, a Lutheran free congregation centred in Herrnhut, Saxony. The town was planned to represent the Protestant urban ideal, constructed around a central Church square. The architecture is homogenous and unadorned, with one and two-storey buildings in yellow brick with red tile roofs. The democratic organization of the Moravian Church, with its pioneering egalitarian philosophy, is expressed in its humanistic town planning. The settlement’s plan opens onto agricultural land and includes important buildings for the common welfare such as large communal houses for the congregation’s widows and unmarried men and women. The buildings are still in use and many are still owned by the local Moravian Church community .

|The Kvarken Archipelago (Finland) and the High Coast (Sweden) are situated in the Gulf of Bothnia, a northern extension of the Baltic Sea. The 5,600 islands of the Kvarken Archipelago feature unusual ridged washboard moraines, ‘De Geer moraines’, formed by the melting of the continental ice sheet, 10,000 to 24,000 years ago. The Archipelago is continuously rising from the sea in a process of rapid glacio-isostatic uplift, whereby the land, previously weighed down under the weight of a glacier, lifts at rates that are among the highest in the world. As a consequence islands appear and unite, peninsulas expand, and lakes evolve from bays and develop into marshes and peat fens. The High Coast has also been largely shaped by the combined processes of glaciation, glacial retreat and the emergence of new land from the sea. Since the last retreat of the ice from the High Coast 9,600 years ago, the uplift has been in the order of 285 m which is the highest known &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;rebound&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The site affords outstanding opportunities for the understanding of the important processes that formed the glaciated and land uplift areas of the Earth's surface.

|Riga was a major centre of the Hanseatic League, deriving its prosperity in the 13th–15th centuries from the trade with central and eastern Europe. The urban fabric of its medieval centre reflects this prosperity, though most of the earliest buildings were destroyed by fire or war. Riga became an important economic centre in the 19th century, when the suburbs surrounding the medieval town were laid out, first with imposing wooden buildings in neoclassical style and then in ''Jugendstil'' .

|The Arctic Circle region of northern Sweden is the home of the Saami, or Lapp people. It is the largest area in the world (and one of the last) with an ancestral way of life based on the seasonal movement of livestock.

This is a designed landscape where Danish kings and their court practiced par force hunting, or hunting with hounds, which reached its peak between the 17th and the late 18th centuries, when the absloute monarchs transformed it into a landscape of power.

Completely rebuilt after its destruction by Swedish troops in 1679, Røros contains about 2000 wooden one- and two-storey houses and a smelting house. Many of these buildings have preserved their blackened wooden façades, giving the town a medieval appearance.

It is an extraordinary example of scientific collaboration among scientists from different countries, and of collaboration between monarchs for a scientific cause.

Free from human interference, Surtsey has been producing unique long-term information on the colonisation process of new land by plant and animal life. Since they began studying the island in 1964, scientists have observed the arrival of seeds carried by ocean currents, the appearance of moulds, bacteria and fungi, followed in 1965 by the first vascular plant, of which there were 10 species by the end of the first decade. By 2004, they numbered 60 together with 75 bryophytes, 71 lichens and 24 fungi. Eighty-nine species of birds have been recorded on Surtsey, 57 of which breed elsewhere in Iceland.

The islands bear testimony to a distinctive frugal way of life based on fishing and the harvesting of the down of eider ducks, in an inhospitable environment. There are fishing villages, quays, warehouses, eider houses (built for eider ducks to nest in), farming landscapes, lighthouses and beacons. There is evidence of human settlement from the Stone Age onwards. By the 9th century, the islands had become an important centre for the supply of down, which appears to have accounted for around a third of the islanders’ income. The Vega Archipelago reflects the way fishermen/farmers have, over the past 1,500 years, maintained a sustainable living and the contribution of women to eiderdown harvesting.

Despite invasions and partial destruction, it has preserved an impressive complex of Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and classical buildings as well as its medieval layout and natural setting.

| The Wadden Sea contains the Dutch Wadden Sea Conservation Area and the German Wadden Sea National Parks of Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein.  The coast line is generally flat and has may mudflats, marshes and dunes.  The site covers two-thirds of the entire Wadden Sea and is home to many plant and animal species.  It is a breeding ground for up to 12 millions birds annually and supports more than 10 percent of the population of 29 species. The site was expanded in 2014 to include the Danish part of the Wadden Sea.

|Situated in south-western Norway, north-east of Bergen, Geirangerfjord and Nærøyfjord, set 120&amp;nbsp;km from one another, are part of the west Norwegian fjord landscape, which stretches from Stavanger in the south to Andalsnes, 500&amp;nbsp;km to the north-east. The two fjords, among the world’s longest and deepest, are considered as archetypical fjord landscapes and among the most scenically outstanding anywhere. Their exceptional natural beauty is derived from their narrow and steep-sided crystalline rock walls that rise up to 1,400 m from the Norwegian Sea and extend 500 m below sea level. The sheer walls of the fjords have numerous waterfalls while free-flowing rivers cross their deciduous and coniferous forests to glacial lakes, glaciers and rugged mountains. The landscape features a range of supporting natural phenomena, both terrestrial and marine, such as submarine moraines and marine mammals.

'''''Louchébem''''' or '''''loucherbem''''' ({{IPA-fr|luʃebɛm}}) is [[Paris]]ian and [[Lyon]]naise [[butcher]]s' ([[French language|French]] ''boucher'') [[slang]], similar to [[Pig Latin]] and [[Verlan]]. It originated in the mid-19th century and was in common use until the 1950s.

==Process==
The ''louchébem'' word-creation process resembles that of ''[[largonji]]'', ''[[verlan]]'', and ''[[javanais]]'', in that existing words are camouflaged according to a set of rules.  Strictly speaking, ''louchébem'' is a more rigid variety of ''largonji'' in which the ending ''-èm'' is obligatory.  ''Largonji'' substitutes {{angle bracket|l}} for the consonant or [[consonant cluster]] at the beginning of the word, or, if the word begins with an {{angle bracket|l}} or a vowel, the second syllable; the initial consonant is then reattached to the end of the word along with a [[suffix]] particular to the [[argot]]: ''-ji'' {{IPA-fr|ʒi|}}, ''-oc'' {{IPA-fr|ɔk|}}, ''-ic'' {{IPA-fr|ik|}}, ''-uche'' {{IPA-fr|yʃ|}}, ''-ès'' {{IPA-fr|ɛs|}}, or in the case of louchébem, ''-em/ème'' {{IPA-fr|ɛm|}}.

Note that ''louchébem'' is first and foremost an [[oral language]], and spelling is usually [[phonetic spelling|phoneticized]].

==History==

Despite the name, ''louchébem'' seems to have been created not by butchers but by inmates at [[Brest Prison]], with records dating back to 1821.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Larlépem largomuche du louchébem. Parler l'argot du boucher|author=Françoise Robert L'argenton|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/lfr_0023-8368_1991_num_90_1_6200|accessdate=6 Jan 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edmund Clerihew Bentley]] used the language as a plot point in his 1937 short story "The Old-Fashioned Apache".

During the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Nazi occupation]] ''louchébem'' was used by [[Paris]]ian members of the [[French Resistance|Resistance]].

Even today, ''louchébem'' is still well-known and used among those working at [[point-of-sale]] in the [[meat]] [[retail]] industry.  Some words have even leaked into common, everyday use by the masses; an example is the word ''[[wikt:loufoque|loufoque]]'', meaning "eccentric".

There is another French [[argot]] called ''largonji'', which differs from ''louchébem'' only in the suffix that is added (-i instead of -em); the term is derived from ''jargon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Marxist feminism''' is [[feminism]] focused on investigating and explaining the ways in which women are oppressed through systems of [[capitalism]] and [[private property]].&lt;ref&gt;Desai, Murli (2014), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hUPhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA119 Feminism and policy approaches for gender aware development]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Desai | editor-first = Murli | title = The paradigm of international social development: ideologies, development systems and policy approaches | page = 119 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2014 | isbn = 9781135010256 }}

Women's University | location = Bombay | series = RCWS Gender Series | year = 1995 | oclc = 474755917}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marxist feminists, [[women's liberation]] can only be achieved through a radical restructuring of the current capitalist economy, in which, they contend, much of women's labor is uncompensated.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"&gt;[[Ann Ferguson|Ferguson, Ann]]; [[Rosemary Hennessy|Hennessy, Rosemary]] (2010), "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-class/ Feminist perspectives on class and work]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Stanford Uni | title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical background in Marxism ==
Influential work by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] (1848) in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''&lt;ref name="Marx"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Marx | first1 = Karl | last2 = Engels | first2 = Frederick | author-link1 = Karl Marx | author-link2 = Frederick Engels | title = [[The Communist Manifesto]] | publisher = Foreign Languages Publishing House | location = Moscow | year = 1848 | oclc = 919388374 }} [https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/index.htm View online.]&lt;/ref&gt; and Marx (1859) in ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' laid the foundation for some of the early discourse about the relationship between capitalism and oppression. The theory and method of study developed by Marx (1859), termed [[historical materialism]], recognizes the ways in which economic systems structure society as a whole and influence everyday life and experience.&lt;ref name="Marx Econ"&gt;{{cite book | last = Marx | first = Karl | author-link = Karl Marx | title = [[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]] | publisher = Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co. | location = Chicago | origyear = 1859 | year = 1904 | oclc = 896669199 }} [https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/ View online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Historical materialism places a heavy emphasis on the role of economic and technological factors in determining the [[base and superstructure|base structure of society]]. The base structure prescribes a range of systems and institutions aimed to advance the interests of those in power, often facilitated through the exploitation of the working class. Marx (1859) argues that these systems are set by the ruling class in accordance with their need to maintain or increase [[class conflict]] in order to remain in power. However, Marx (1859) also acknowledges the potential for organization and collective action by the lower classes with the goal of empowering a new ruling class. As [[Vladimir Lenin]] (1917) argues in support of this possibility, the organization of socialist consciousness by a [[Vanguardism|vanguard party]] is vital to the working class revolutionary process.&lt;ref name="Lenin"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lenin | first = Vladimir | author-link = Vladimir Lenin | title = [[The State and Revolution|The State and Revolution: The Marxist Theory of the State &amp; The Tasks of the Proletariat in the Revolution]] | publisher = George Allen &amp; Unwin | location = London | year = 1917 | oclc = 926871435 }} [https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ View online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884, Engels published ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State]]''.&lt;ref name="Engels"&gt;{{cite book | last = Engels | first = Frederick | author-link = Frederick Engels | title = [[The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State]] | publisher = Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co. | location = Chicago | origyear = 1884 | year = 1902 | oclc = 213734607}} [https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/ View online.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Engels (1884), the shift from [[feudalism]] to private ownership of land has had a huge effect on the status of women. In a private ownership system, individuals who do not own land or other [[means of production]] are in a situation that Engels (1884) compares to enslavement - they ''must'' work for the owners of the land in order to be able to live within the system of private ownership. Engels (1884) explains that the transition to this type of system resulted in the creation of separate public and private spheres and assigned access to waged labor disproportionately to men.

Engels (1884) argues that a woman's subordination is not a result of her biological disposition but of social relations, and that men's efforts to achieve their demands for control of women's labor and sexual faculties have gradually become institutionalized in the [[nuclear family]]. Through a Marxist [[historical materialism|historical]] perspective, Engels (1884) analyzes the widespread social phenomena associated with female sexual morality, such as fixation on [[virginity]] and sexual purity, incrimination and violent punishment of women who commit [[infidelity|adultery]], and demands that women be submissive to their husbands. Ultimately, Engels traces these phenomena to the recent development of exclusive control of private property by the patriarchs of the rising slaveowner class in the ancient mode of production, and the attendant desire to ensure that their inheritance is passed only to their own offspring: chastity and fidelity are rewarded, says Engels (1884), because they guarantee exclusive access to the sexual and reproductive faculty of women possessed by men from the property-owning class.

As such, gender oppression is closely related to class oppression and the relationship between men and women in society is similar to the relations between [[proletariat]] and [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref name="Ferguson" /&gt; On this account women's subordination is a function of class oppression, maintained (like [[racism]]) because it serves the interests of capital and the [[ruling class]]; it divides men against women, privileges working class men relatively within the capitalist system in order to secure their support; and legitimates the capitalist class's refusal to pay for the domestic labor assigned, unpaid, to women.

== Productive and reproductive labour ==
In the capitalist system, [[Productive and unproductive labour|two types of labor exist]], a division stressed by Marxist feminists like [[Margaret Benston]] and Peggy Morton.&lt;ref name="Vogel"&gt;Vogel, Lise (2013), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=RKbdfZvS3_IC&amp;pg=PA17 A decade of debate]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Vogel | editor-first = Lise  | title = Marxism and the oppression of women: toward a unitary theory | page = 17 | publisher = Brill | location = Leiden, Holland | isbn = 9789004248953 }}

The second form of labor is reproductive, which is associated with the private sphere and involves anything that people have to do for themselves that is not for the purposes of receiving a wage (i.e. cleaning, cooking, having children). Both forms of labor are necessary, but people have different access to these forms of labor based on certain aspects of their identity. Women are assigned to the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]] where the labor is reproductive and thus uncompensated and unrecognized in a capitalist system. It is in the best interest of both public and private institutions to exploit the labor of women as an inexpensive method of supporting a work force. For the producers, this means higher profits. For the nuclear family, the power dynamic dictates that domestic work is exclusively to be completed by the woman of the household thus liberating the rest of the members from their own necessary reproductive labor. Marxist feminists argue that the exclusion of women from productive labor leads to male control in both private and public domains.&lt;ref name="Vogel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hartmann"&gt;{{citation | last = Hartmann | first = Heidi | author-link = Heidi Hartmann | contribution = The unhappy marriage of Marxism and feminism: towards a more progressive union | editor-last = Sargent | editor-first = Lydia | editor-link = Lydia Sargent | title = Women and revolution: a discussion of the unhappy marriage of Marxism and Feminism | pages = 1&amp;ndash;42 | publisher = [[South End Press]] | location = Boston, Massachusetts | series = South End Press Political Controversies Series | year = 1981 | isbn = 9780896080621 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}

== Accomplishments and activism ==
The militant nature of Marxist feminists and their ability to mobilize to promote social change has enabled them to engage in important activism. Though their controversial advocacy often receives criticism, Marxist feminists challenge capitalism in ways that facilitate new discourse and shed light on the status of women.&lt;ref name="Hartmann" /&gt; These women throughout history have used a range of approaches in fighting [[hegemonic]] capitalism, which reflect their different views on the optimal method of achieving liberation for women.&lt;ref name="Ferguson" /&gt;

=== Wages for housework ===
Focusing on exclusion from productive labor as the most important source of female oppression, some Marxist feminists devoted their activism to fighting for the inclusion of domestic work within the waged capitalist economy. The idea of creating compensated reproductive labor was present in the writings of socialists such as [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1898) who argued that women's oppression stemmed from being forced into the private sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gilman | first = C. P. | author-link = Charlotte Perkins Gilman | title = Women and economics: a study of the economic relation between men and women as a factor in social evolution | publisher = Small, Maynard, &amp; Co. | location = Boston | url = http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/gilman/economics/economics.html | year = 1898 | oclc = 26987247 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilman proposed that conditions for women would improve when their work was located, recognized, and valued in the public sphere.&lt;ref name="Ferguson" /&gt;

Perhaps the most influential of the efforts to compensate reproductive labor was the [[Wages for housework|International Wages for Housework Campaign]], an organization launched in Italy in 1972 by members of the International Feminist Collective. Many of these women, including [[Selma James]],&lt;ref name="Gardiner"&gt;{{cite news | last = Gardiner | first = Becky | title = A life in writing: Selma James | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/08/life-in-writing-selma-james | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 8 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mariarosa Dalla Costa,&lt;ref name="Costa"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Dalla Costa | first1 = Mariarosa | last2 = James | first2 = Selma | author-link1 = Mariarosa Dalla Costa | author-link2 = Selma James | title = The power of women and the subversion of the community | publisher = Falling Water Press | location = Bristol, England | url = http://libcom.org/library/power-women-subversion-community-della-costa-selma-james | year = 1972 | oclc = 67881986 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brigitte Galtier, and [[Silvia Federici]]&lt;ref name="Cox"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Cox | first1 = Nicole | last2 = Federici | first2 = Silvia | author-link2 = Silvia Federici | title = Counter-planning from the kitchen: wages for housework: a perspective on capital and the left | publisher = New York Wages for Housework | location = New York | url = http://bcrw.barnard.edu/archive/workforce/Counter-Planning_from_the_Kitchen.pdf | year = 1976 | edition = 2nd | oclc = 478375855 }}&lt;/ref&gt; published a range of sources to promote their message in academic and public domains. Despite the efforts beginning with a relatively small group of women in Italy, The Wages for Housework Campaign was successful in mobilizing on an international level. A Wages for Housework group was founded in Brooklyn, New York with the help of Federici.&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt; As [[Heidi Hartmann]] acknowledges (1981), the efforts of these movements, though ultimately unsuccessful, generated important discourse regarding the value of housework and its relation to the economy.&lt;ref name="Hartmann" /&gt;

=== Sharing the responsibility of reproductive labour ===
Another solution proposed by Marxist feminists is to liberate women from their forced connection to reproductive labour. In her critique of traditional Marxist feminist movements such as the Wages for Housework Campaign, [[Heidi Hartmann]] (1981) argues that these efforts "take as their question the relationship of women to the economic system, rather than that of women to men, apparently assuming the latter will be explained in their discussion of the former."&lt;ref name="Hartmann" /&gt; Hartmann (1981) believes that traditional discourse has ignored the importance of women's oppression as women, and instead focused on women's oppression as members of the capitalist system. Similarly, [[Gayle Rubin]], who has written on a range of subjects including sadomasochism, prostitution, pornography, and lesbian literature as well as anthropological studies and histories of sexual subcultures, first rose to prominence through her 1975 essay ''The Traffic in Women: Notes on the 'Political Economy' of Sex'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Gayle Rubin|Rubin, Gayle]] (1975), "[https://genderstudiesgroupdu.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/the-rraffic-in-women.pdf The Traffic in Women: Notes on the 'Political Economy' of Sex]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Reiter | editor-first = Rayna | title = Toward an Anthropology of Women | publisher = Monthly Review Press | location = New York | isbn = 9780853453727 }}
:''Reprinted in'': {{cite book | last = Nicholson | first = Linda | title = The second wave: a reader in feminist theory | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780415917612 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she coins the phrase "sex/gender system" and criticizes Marxism for what she claims is its incomplete analysis of sexism under capitalism, without dismissing or dismantling Marxist fundamentals in the process.

More recently, many Marxist feminists have shifted their focus to the ways in which women are now potentially in worse conditions after gaining access to productive labour. [[Nancy Folbre]] proposes that feminist movements begin to focus on women's subordinate status to men both in the reproductive (private) sphere, as well as in the workplace (public sphere).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Folbre | first = Nancy | author-link = Nancy Folbre | title = [[Nancy Folbre#Who Pays for the Kids?

=== Affective labor ===
Feminist scholars and [[List of sociologists|sociologists]] such as [[Michael Hardt]]&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1051694685|title=Empire|last=Michael.|first=Hardt,|date=2000|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674251210|oclc=1051694685}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Antonio Negri|Antonio Negr]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;i&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, [[Arlie Russell Hochschild]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=J.

Whitney states "The daily struggle of unemployed persons and the domestic toil of housewives no less than the waged worker are thus part of the production and reproduction of social life, and of the biopolitical growth of capital that valorizes information and subjectivities."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The concept of [[emotional labor]] is a focus of [[affective labor]], particularly the emotional labor that is present and required in traditionally pink collared jobs (jobs traditionally occupied by women). Arlie Russell Hochschild discusses the emotional labor of flight attendants in her book ''The Managed Heart: Commercialization of Human Feeling'' (1983)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in which she considers the affective labor of the profession as flight attendants smile, exchange pleasantries and banter with customers.

They did not see a true possibility to unite across economic inequality because they argue that it would be extremely difficult for an upper class woman to truly understand the struggles of the working class.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"For what reason... should the woman worker seek a union with the bourgeois feminists? Who, in actual fact, would stand to gain in the event of such an alliance? Certainly not the woman worker." — Alexandra Kollontai, 1909&lt;ref name="kol1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Critics like Kollontai (1909) believed [[liberal feminism]] would undermine the efforts of Marxism to improve conditions for the working class. Marxists supported the more radical political program of liberating women through socialist revolution, with a special emphasis on work among women and in materially changing their conditions after the revolution. Additional liberation methods supported by Marxist feminists include radical demands coined as "Utopian Demands" by [[Maria Mies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author-last = Mies | author-first = Maria | author-link = Maria Mies | contribution = Utopian socialism and women's emancipation | editor-last1 = Mies | editor-first1 = Maria  | editor-last2 = Jayawardena | editor-first2 = Kumari | editor-link1 = Maria Mies | editor-link2 = Kumari Jayawardena | title = Feminism in Europe: liberal and socialist strategies 1789-1919 | pages = 33&amp;ndash;80 | publisher = Institute of Social Studies | location = The Hague | year = 1981 | series = History of the Women's Movement | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QpCIoAEACAAJ | oclc = 906505149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This indication of the scope of revolution required to promote change states that demanding anything less than complete reform will produce inadequate solutions to long-term issues.

'''Michael A.

==Early life==
Persinger attended [[Carroll College (Wisconsin)|Carroll College]] from 1963 to 1964 and graduated from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1967. He received his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[physiological psychology]] from the [[University of Tennessee]] in 1969 and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Manitoba]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A '''phememe''' (from Ancient Greek [[wikt:φημί]] ‘I speak, say’) is a hypothesized [[speech sound]] with an abstract [[gesture|gestural]] meaning, proposed by the linguist [[Mary LeCron Foster]]. (The term ''phememe'' appeared earlier in the works of [[Leonard Bloomfield]], who defined it as a "smallest and meaningless unit of linguistic signaling" – either a [[phoneme]] or a [[taxeme]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, Leonard (1933), ''Language'', New York: Henry Holt, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;)

According to Foster, phememes were the fundamental building block of the earliest human spoken language (Primordial Language), as opposed to the [[phoneme]]s of attested languages, contemporary or historical. The phememe concept is thus important in the debate regarding the gestural [[origin of speech]]. By way of an example, the sound [m], as a meaningful oral gesture, is understood as pointing to “two opposed surfaces in tapering, pressing together, holding together, crushing, or resting against”.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Mary LeCron. 1978. The symbolic structure of primordial language. In Sherwood L. Washburn and Elizabeth R. McCown (eds.) ''Human Evolution: Biosocial Perspectives'', 77–121. Menlo Park, CA: Benjamin/Cummings.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflexes of this primordial [m], and its original meaning, are found in ostensibly unrelated present-day languages in words referring to the mouth, the female genitals, and semantic extensions of these, e.g. Latin ''mugio'' ‘to moo, bugle’, ''mutus'' ‘mute’, ''mucus'' ‘mucous’, Japanese ''mugon'' ‘silence, muteness’, Dravidian ''muka-'' ‘face, mouth’, Piro (Arawak) ''musi-'' ‘to be pregnant, impregnate’.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Mary LeCron. 1990. The Birth and Life of Signs. In Mary LeCron Foster and Lucy Botscharow (eds.) ''The Life of Symbols'', 285–306. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to her most recent published work,&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Mary LeCron. 1996. The reconstruction of the evolution of human spoken language. In Andre Lock and Charles R. Peters (eds.) ''Handbook of Human Symbolic Evolution'', 747–775. Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Foster proposes that the phememic system of primordial spoken language consisted of the following phememes.

The philosopher Maxine Sheets-Johnstone makes extensive use of Foster’s concept of the phememe in arguing [[iconicity]] to be the foundation of the symbolic process.&lt;ref&gt;Sheets-Johnstone, Maxine. 1999. Sensory-kinetic Understandings of Language: An Inquiry into Origins. ''Evolution of Communication'' 3 (2): 149–183.&lt;/ref&gt; Earl R. Anderson&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Earl R. 1998. ''A Grammar of Iconism''. Cranbury, NJ: Associated University Presses. Pp. 63f.&lt;/ref&gt; points out that the phememe is thus an elaboration of earlier theories postulating a role for oral gesture in the origin of spoken language, such as those of the naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]&lt;ref&gt;The Expressiveness of Speech, or, Mouth-Gesture as a Factor in the Origin of Language. ''Fortnightly Review'' 64: 528–543.&lt;/ref&gt; and the anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor]],&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, Edward Burnett. 2010 [1871]. ''Primitive Culture: Researches into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom''. 2 volumes. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; who called his method ''generative philology''. An implication of the phememe hypothesis is that Primordial Language lacked [[double articulation]], which the American linguist [[Charles F. Hockett]] proposed as a central design feature of human language. According to this principle, linguistic signs are made up of building blocks, such as [[phoneme]]s, which are themselves meaningless, e.g. ''cat'' is composed of the phonemes /k/, /æ/ and /t/. Phememes came to be desemanticized and replaced by meaningless phonemes in later evolution. The anthropologist Gordon Hewes proposes that this shift was motivated by the advantages phonemes entail in rapid word retrieval.&lt;ref&gt;Hewes, Gordon W. 1983. The invention of phonemically-based language. In Eric de Grolier (ed.) ''Glossogenetics: The origin and evolution of language'', 143–162. Chur, Switzerland: Harwood Academic.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[literary criticism]], '''purple prose''' is [[prose]] text that is so extravagant, ornate, or flowery as to break the flow and draw excessive attention to itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Word a Day – purple prose |url=http://www.wordsmith.org/words/purple_prose.html |website=Wordsmith.org |accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purple prose is characterized by the excessive use of adjectives, adverbs, and [[metaphor]]s. When it is limited to certain passages, they may be termed '''purple patches''' or '''purple passages''', standing out from the rest of the work.

Purple prose is criticized for desaturating the meaning in an author's text by overusing melodramatic and fanciful descriptions. As there is no precise rule or absolute definition of what constitutes purple prose, deciding if a text, passage, or complete work has fallen victim is a somewhat subjective decision. According to [[Paul West (writer)|Paul West]], "It takes a certain amount of sass to speak up for prose that's rich, succulent and full of novelty. Purple is immoral, undemocratic and insincere; at best artsy, at worst the exterminating angel of depravity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=West|first1=Paul|title=IN DEFENSE OF PURPLE PROSE|journal=New York Times|date=15 December 1985|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/15/books/in-defense-of-purple-prose.html?pagewanted=2|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The term ''purple prose'' is derived from a reference by the Roman poet [[Horace]]&lt;ref name="Nixon"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nixon |first=Cheryl |title=Novel Definitions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XTY6q_hIa90C&amp;pg=PA194|accessdate=19 May 2013 |publisher=Broadview Press |isbn=9781770482074 |pages=194– |date=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Macrone1994"&gt;{{cite book |last=Macrone|first=Michael|title=It's Greek to Me |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ohlxXHpEK8C&amp;pg=PA147 |accessdate=19 May 2013 |date=1994-05-18 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=9780062720443 |pages=147–}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Quintus Horatius Flaccus, 65–8 BC) who wrote in his ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' (lines 14–21):&lt;ref name="horace"&gt;Horace (18 BC).

The '''Quina Mousterian''' is a variety of the [[Mousterian]] industry of the European [[Middle Palaeolithic]], associated with Neanderthals and described by [[François Bordes]]. The Quina Mousterian is usually dominated by transverse scrapers and typically has a [[Levallois technique|Levallois]] index of less than 10%.

Quina Mousterian lithic assemblages are usually found in caves. Very few Quina assemblages have been found outside cave and rock shelters. However, an important lithic assemblage, which was characterised by the presence of Quina tools and Levallois core reduction has recently been excavated at the Middle Palaeolithic valley settlements at [[Veldwezelt-Hezerwater]] in [[Belgium]]. The researchers who have excavated the Quina assemblage at the so-called "WFL site" at [[Veldwezelt-Hezerwater]] prefer to call the WFL lithic assemblage: "Levallois core reduction with Quina tools."

Quina Mousterian lithic assemblages in Southern [[France]] mostly date to the Early [[Weichselian]] (70,000-60,000BP), while Quina Mousterian lithic assemblages in [[Belgium]] mostly date to the first half of the Middle [[Weichselian]] (60,000-45,000).

A typical Quina Mousterian lithic assemblage is found in [[Axlor]] site, in the Basque Country (Spain), dated at the end of OIS3 (44,000 BP).

== History ==

Rahva Raamat was founded in 1912, when Estonian publisher Gustav Pihlakas opened his bookstore in Pärnu mnt 10, a newly designed house by respected Finnish-American architect [[Eliel Saarinen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kul.ee/en/organisation/building-and-history|title=Building and history {{!}} Ministry of Culture|website=www.kul.ee|language=en|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there has always been a bookstore in the same premises.

In October 2002 Rahva Raamat in Pärnu mnt 10 in Tallinn was in danger of being closed down. Hundreds of protesters appeared on the street, which helped the oldest bookstore in Estonia to stay open.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://maaleht.delfi.ee/news/maaleht/elu/rahva-raamat-muinsuskaitse-alla?id=65398118|title=Rahva Raamat muinsuskaitse alla!|date=1355656802|website=Maaleht|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sarah McFarland Taylor''' is an American academic and author. She is currently Associate Professor of Religion in the Department of Religious Studies at [[Northwestern University]], where she also teaches in the Environmental Policy and Culture Program. Areas of focus include women's studies in religion, religion and ecology, and religion and American culture.

Taylor has held numerous fellowships, including the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]] Postdoctoral Fellowship, a [[Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation]] Career Enhancement Fellowship, a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] Humanities Fellowship, a Wabash Center Fellowship, and a Louisville Institute Fellowship.&lt;ref name="NWU"&gt;[http://www.religion.northwestern.edu/faculty/taylor.html Northwestern University faculty profile]&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2008-2009 school year, she held the Senior Research Fellowship at the Martin Marty Center for the Advanced Study of Religion at the [[University of Chicago Divinity School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://divinity.uchicago.edu/martycenter/fellowships/senior_profiles/taylor.shtml Marty Martin Center for the Advanced Study of Religion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609201417/http://divinity.uchicago.edu/martycenter/fellowships/senior_profiles/taylor.shtml |date=2010-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her 2007 book ''Green Sisters: A Spiritual Ecology'' won two awards from the [[Catholic Press Association]] for Best Book on Gender Issues as well as Best Book on Social Concerns.&lt;ref name="NWU" /&gt; Published by the [[Harvard University]] press, ''Green Sisters'' highlights [[Roman Catholic]] religious sisters who have taken up environmental activism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sisters new ways one with the earth |author= |first=Michael |last=Swan |authorlink= |url=http://www.catholicregister.org/content/view/1871/68/ |format= |agency= |newspaper=The Catholic Register |publisher= |location=Toronto |isbn= |issn= |doi= |id= |date=May 26, 2008 |page= |pages= |accessdate=January 8, 2010 |language= |trans-title=|quote= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122094147/http://www.catholicregister.org/content/view/1871/68/ |archivedate=November 22, 2008 |ref= |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Dominican Sisters]]' Genesis Farm, the Green Mountain Monastery, [[White Violet Center for Eco-Justice]] of the [[Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods]], and the Sisters of the Presentation straw-bale welcome center.

In "What If Religions Had Ecologies?: The Case for Reinhabiting Religious Studies" ([[Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature, and Culture]], Summer 2007), Taylor argues that meaningful connections need to be forged between the literary realm of [[ecocriticism]] and religious studies, and more attention needs to be paid to the natural history of the physical environments that religious communities inhabit and to how those communities shape and are in turn shaped by those environments. When physical environments are considered as integral parts of academic religious inquiry and no longer rendered invisible or relegated to mere ‘backdrops’ for the larger human drama, contends Taylor, scholars will be able to provide a more nuanced sense of religion as it is truly lived in context. Taylor continues to theorize the concept of "[[spiritual ecology]]" in her work.

The author currently has two books in process: ''Eternally Green: American Religion and the Ecology of Death'', which looks at the [[green burial]] movement, and ''Eco-Prophecy: Religious Responses to Global Climate Change''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1840">'''Semasiology''' (from {{lang-el|links=no|σημασία}}, ''{{transl|la|semasia}}'', "signification") is a discipline of [[linguistics]] concerned with the question "what does the word ''X'' mean?". It studies the meaning of words regardless how they are pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://feb-web.ru/feb/slt/abc/lt2/lt2-7632.htm Словарь литературных терминов, семасиология (ru. Dictionary of literary terms, semasiology)]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the opposite of [[onomasiology]], a branch of [[lexicology]] that starts with a concept or object and asks for its name, i.e., "how do you express X?" whereas semasiology starts with a word and asks for its meanings.&lt;!-- Attribution of the text I added (December 18, 2016) re: comparing semasiology and onomasiology: [[Onomasiology]] --&gt;

The exact meaning of semasiology is somewhat obscure. It is often used as a synonym of [[Semantics#Linguistics|semantics]] (the study of the meaning of words, phrases, and longer forms of expression).&lt;!-- Attribution of the text I added (December 18, 2016) re: the  definition of semantics: [[Semantics#Linguistics]] --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070108095538/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/101/067.htm Semasiologia, Culture at Vologda region]&lt;/ref&gt; However, semasiology is also sometimes considered part of [[lexical semantics]], a narrow subfield of lexicology (the study of words) and semantics.

The term was first used in German by [[Christian Karl Reisig]] in 1825 in his work, [''Lectures on Latin Linguistics''] ({{lang-de|links=no|Vorlesungen über lateinische Sprachwissenschaft}}), and was used in English by 1847. Semantics replaced it in its original meaning, beginning in 1893.

'''''Shrek''''' is a 2001 American [[computer animation|computer-animated]], [[comedy film]] loosely based on the 1990 fairytale picture book [[Shrek!|of the same name]] by [[William Steig]]. Directed by [[Andrew Adamson]] and [[Vicky Jenson]] in their [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debuts]], it stars [[Mike Myers]], [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Cameron Diaz]], and [[John Lithgow]] as the [[voice acting|voices]] of the lead characters. The film [[parody film|parodies]] other films adapted from fairy tale storylines, primarily aimed at [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|animated Disney films]]. In the story, [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] (Myers) finds his swamp overrun by fairy tale creatures who have been banished by a corrupt [[Lord Farquaad]] (Lithgow) aspiring to be king. Shrek makes a deal with Farquaad to regain control of his swamp in return for rescuing [[Princess Fiona]] (Diaz), whom he intends to marry. With the help of [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]] (Murphy), Shrek embarks on his quest but soon falls in love with the princess, who is hiding a secret that will change his life forever.

The rights to Steig's book were purchased by [[Steven Spielberg]] in 1991. He originally planned to produce a traditionally-animated film based on the book, but [[John H. Williams]] convinced him to bring the film to the newly-founded [[DreamWorks]] in 1994. [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] began active development of the film in 1995 immediately following the studio's purchase of the rights from Spielberg. [[Chris Farley]] was originally cast as the voice for the title character, recording nearly all of the required dialogue. After Farley died in 1997 before the work was finished, [[Mike Myers]] stepped in to voice the character, which was changed to a Scottish accent in the process. The film was intended to be motion-captured, but after poor results, the studio decided to hire [[Pacific Data Images]] to complete the final computer animation.

''Shrek'' premiered at the at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]], where it competed for the [[Palme d'Or]],&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1100045/year/2001.html|title=Shrek|publisher=Festival de Cannes|accessdate=October 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the first animated film since Disney's ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (1953) to receive that honor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/may/21/cannes2001.cannesfilmfestival1|title=Shrek scores at the US box office|date=May 21, 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=February 7, 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely acclaimed as an animated film that featured adult-oriented humor and themes, while catering to children at the same time. The film was theatrically released in the United States on May 16, 2001, and grossed $484.4&amp;nbsp;million worldwide against production budget of $60&amp;nbsp;million. ''Shrek'' won the first ever [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] and was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. It also earned six award nominations from the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] (BAFTA), ultimately winning [[BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. The film's success helped establish [[DreamWorks Animation]] as a prime competitor to [[Pixar]] in feature film computer animation, and three sequels were released—''[[Shrek 2]]'' (2004), ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' (2007), and ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'' (2010)—along with two holiday specials, a [[Puss in Boots (2011 film)|spin-off film]], and [[Shrek the Musical|a stage musical]] that kickstarted the [[Shrek (franchise)|''Shrek'' franchise]]. A planned fifth film was cancelled in 2009 prior to the fourth film's release, but it has since been revived and has entered development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It Isn't Ogre Yet!

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP: FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words --&gt;
[[Shrek (character)|Shrek]], a green [[ogre]] who loves the solitude of his swamp, finds his life interrupted when countless fairytale creatures are exiled there by the fairytale-hating and vertically-challenged [[Lord Farquaad]] of Duloc. An angered Shrek decides to ask Farquaad to exile them elsewhere. He brings along a talking [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]], who is the only fairytale creature willing to guide him to Duloc.

Meanwhile, Farquaad tortures the [[List of Shrek characters#The Gingerbread Man|Gingerbread Man]] for the location of the remaining fairytale creatures. His guards rush in with something he has been searching for: the Magic Mirror. He asks the Mirror if his kingdom is the fairest of them all but is told that he is not even a king, as he isn't descended from royalty. To be one, he must marry a princess, so Farquaad resolves to marry [[Princess Fiona]], who is locked in a castle tower guarded by a dragon. He organizes a tournament wherein the winner gets the "privilege" of rescuing Fiona for him. Shrek and Donkey arrive during the tournament, and ignorantly defeat Farquaad's knights. Farquaad proclaims them the champions, and compels them under threat of death to rescue Fiona, promising to move the fairytale creatures from Shrek's swamp if he succeeds.

Shrek and Donkey travel to the castle to find Fiona. They are noticed by [[Dragon (Shrek)|Dragon]], who corners Donkey. In desperation, he sweet-talks the beast, learning that it is female. Dragon falls in love with Donkey and carries him to her chambers. Meanwhile, Shrek finds Fiona, who is appalled at his lack of romanticism and surprised he had not slain Dragon. They leave after rescuing Donkey, and Fiona is thrilled to be rescued but is quickly disappointed when Shrek reveals he is an ogre. Despite her demands that Farquaad come get her in person, Shrek forcibly carries her as he ventures back to Duloc with Donkey. The three encounter [[List of Shrek characters#"Monsieur" Robin Hood|Robin Hood]] on their way back, where it is revealed that Fiona is an expert martial artist. Shrek and Fiona find they have a lot in common and begin to fall in love.

When the trio is almost at Duloc, Fiona takes shelter in a windmill for the evening. Donkey hears strange noises from within and investigates, finding Fiona transformed into an ogre. She explains that she was cursed during childhood to transform every night, and that only her true love's kiss will change her to "love's true form". Meanwhile, Shrek is about to confess his feelings to Fiona and overhears part of their conversation. He is heartbroken when he mistakes her comment about being an "ugly beast" as disgust toward him. At Donkey's suggestion, Fiona vows to tell Shrek about her [[curse]], but dawn breaks and she turns back into a human. She finds that Shrek has brought Lord Farquaad to the windmill. Confused by Shrek's sudden disposition towards her, Fiona accepts Farquaad's marriage proposal and requests they be married before nightfall. The couple return to Duloc, while a hurt and angry Shrek abandons Donkey and returns to his now-vacated swamp.

An angered Donkey arrives at the swamp, where Shrek reveals that he overheard Donkey and Fiona's conversation. Donkey tells Shrek that she was talking about someone else, and urges Shrek to go after Fiona before she is married. They travel to Duloc quickly by riding Dragon, who had escaped her confines and followed Donkey.

Shrek interrupts the wedding before Farquaad can kiss Fiona. He tells her that Farquaad is not her true love and is only marrying her to become king. The sun sets, which turns Fiona into an ogre in front of everyone, causing a surprised Shrek to fully understand what he overheard. Outraged, Farquaad orders Shrek executed and Fiona detained. Dragon bursts in alongside Donkey and devours Farquaad. Shrek and Fiona profess their love and share a kiss; Fiona's curse is lifted but she is surprised to see that she is still an ogre and not beautiful. Shrek reassures her that she is. They marry in the swamp and leave on their honeymoon.

==Production==

===Development===
At the time [[DreamWorks]] was founded, producer [[John H. Williams]] got hold of the book from his children and when he brought it to DreamWorks, it caught [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]]'s attention and the studio decided to make it into a film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://culture.com/articles/487/shrek-interview-with-mike-myers.phtml | title=Shrek: Interview With Mike Myers | publisher=Culture.com | accessdate=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recounting the inspiration of making the film, Williams said: {{quote|"Every development deal starts with a pitch and my pitch came from my then kindergartner, in collaboration with his pre-school brother. Upon our second reading of Shrek, the kindergartner started quoting large segments of the book pretending he could read them. Even as an adult, I thought Shrek was outrageous, irreverent, iconoclastic, gross, and just a lot of fun.

Some early sketches of Shrek's house were done between 1996 and 1997 using [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]], with the sketches showing Shrek first living in a garbage dump near a human village called Wart Creek.

[[File:Mike Myers David Shankbone 2010 NYC.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mike Myers]] was re-cast as Shrek after [[Chris Farley]]'s death.]]
[[Chris Farley]] was initially hired to voice Shrek, and he had recorded nearly all of the dialogue for the character, but died before completing the project.&lt;ref name="JimHill1"&gt;{{cite web | last=Hill | first=Jim | url=http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2004/05/17/how-quot-shrek-quot-went-from-being-a-train-wreck-to-one-for-the-record-books.aspx | title=How "Shrek" went from being a train wreck to one for the record books | publisher=JimHillMedia.com | date=May 16, 2004 | accessdate=August 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A story reel featuring a sample of Farley's recorded dialogue was leaked to the public in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Griggs|first1=Brandon|title=Hear Chris Farley's Shrek in newly unearthed clip|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/06/entertainment/chris-farley-shrek-voice-feat/|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; DreamWorks then re-cast the voice role to [[Mike Myers]], who insisted on a complete script rewrite, to leave no traces of Farley's version of Shrek.&lt;ref name="JimHill1"/&gt; According to Myers, he wanted to voice the character "for two reasons: I wanted the opportunity to work with Jeffrey Katzenberg; and [the book is] a great story about accepting yourself for who you are."&lt;ref name = "Production notes on Culture.com"/&gt;

After Myers had completed providing the voice for the character, when the film was well into production, he asked to re-record all of his lines with a [[Scottish English#Phonology|Scottish accent]], similar to that his mother used when she told him bedtime stories and also used for his roles in other films, such as ''[[So I Married an Axe Murderer]]'' and ''[[Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me]]''.&lt;ref name="JimHill1" /&gt; According to the DVD commentary, he had also tried using country and Canadian accents.&lt;ref name = "commentary"&gt;Shrek.

"What it meant is instead of me going in for ten sessions, I went in for twenty sessions. I got paid the same.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/the-best-revelations-from-mike-myers-wtf-podcast-93234975202.html|title=The Best Revelations from Mike Myers' WTF Podcast: 'Wayne's World,' 'Shrek,' and More|date=July 29, 2014|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=March 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Myers voicing the character, more ideas began to come. There were clearer story points, fresher gags and comedy bits.{{sfn|Neuwirth|2003|p=31}} "I got a letter from Spielberg thanking me so much for caring about the character," Myers said.

Another person planned to voice a character in the film was [[Janeane Garofalo]], who was set to star alongside Farley as Princess Fiona. However, she was fired from the project with little explanation. Years later, Garofalo stated "I was never told why [I was fired]. I assume because I sound like a man sometimes? I don't know why. Nobody told me&amp;nbsp;...

===Animation===
''Shrek'' was originally set up to be a live-action/CG animation hybrid with background plate miniature sets and the main characters composited into the scene as motion-captured computer graphics, using an ExpertVision Hires Falcon 10 camera system to capture and apply realistic human movement to the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/DreamWorks+SKG+chooses+MotionAnalysis+Corp.+ExpertVision+HiRES+motion...-a019239631|title=DreamWorks SKG chooses MotionAnalysis Corp. ExpertVision HiRES motion capture system for "Shrek"|publisher=thefreelibrary.com|accessdate=March 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sizable crew was hired to run a test, and after a year and a half of R &amp; D, the test was finally screened in May 1997.{{sfn|Neuwirth|2003|p=28}} The results were not satisfactory, with Katzenberg stating "It looked terrible, it didn't work, it wasn't funny, and we didn't like it."&lt;ref name="JimHill1" /&gt; The studio then turned to its production partners at [[Pacific Data Images]] (PDI), who began production with the studio in 1998&lt;ref name = "The Tech of the Shrek the Third"&gt;{{cite video | people = [[Raman Hui]] | year = 2007 | title = The Tech of Shrek The Third | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFgCmrmS9p8 | time = 0:41 | quote = In the first Shrek, we started the animation in 1998.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and helped ''Shrek'' get to its final, computer-animated look.&lt;ref name="JimHill1" /&gt; At this time, ''[[Antz]]'' was still in production by the studio&lt;ref name="JimHill1" /&gt; and Effects Supervisor Ken Bielenberg was asked by [[Aron Warner]] "to start development for Shrek."{{sfn|Blair|2001|p=1}} Similar to previous PDI films, PDI used its own proprietary software (like its own Fluid Animation System) for its animated movies. For some elements, however, it also took advantage of some of the powerhouse animation software in the market. This is particularly true with [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]], which PDI used for most of its dynamic cloth animation and for the hair of Fiona and Farquaad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalmediafx.com/Shrek/shrekfaq.html|title=Shrek FAQ|publisher=Digital Media FX|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"We did a lot of work on character and set-up, and then kept changing the set up while we were doing the animation," Hui noted. "In ''[[Antz]]'', we had a facial system that gave us all the facial muscles under the skin. In ''Shrek'', we applied that to whole body. So, if you pay attention to Shrek when he talks, you see that when he opens his jaw, he forms a double chin, because we have the fat and the muscles underneath. That kind of detail took us a long time to get right."{{sfn|Blair|2001|p=2}} One of the most difficult parts of creating the film was making Donkey's [[fur]] flow smoothly so that it didn't look like that of a [[Chia Pet]]. This fell into the hands of the surfacing animators who used flow controls within a complex shader to provide the fur with many attributes (ability to change directions, lie flat, swirl, etc.).&lt;ref name = "dmfanimatingshrek"/&gt; It was then the job of the visual effects group, led by Ken Bielenberg, to make the fur react to environment conditions. Once the technology was mastered, it was able to be applied to many aspects of the ''Shrek'' movie including [[grass]], [[moss]], [[beard]]s, [[eyebrow]]s, and even threads on Shrek's tunic. Making human hair realistic was different from Donkey's fur, requiring a separate rendering system and a lot of attention from the [[lighting]] and [[visual effects]] teams.&lt;ref name = "dmfanimatingshrek"/&gt;

''Shrek'' has 31 sequences, with 1,288 shots in every sequence total.&lt;ref name = "Production Information on Culture.com"/&gt; [[Aron Warner]] said that the creators "envisioned a magical environment that you could immerse yourself into." Shrek includes 36 separate in-film locations to make the world of the film, which DreamWorks claimed was more than any previous computer-animated feature before. In-film locations were finalized and as demonstrated by past DreamWorks animated movies, color and mood was of the utmost importance.&lt;ref name = "dmfanimatingshrek"/&gt;

===Music===
{{Main|Shrek: Music from the Original Motion Picture}}
''Shrek'' is the third DreamWorks animated film (and the only film in the [[Shrek (franchise)|Shrek series]]) to have [[Harry Gregson-Williams]] team up with [[John Powell (composer)|John Powell]] to compose the score following ''[[Antz]]'' (1998) and ''[[Chicken Run]]'' (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burlingame|first1=Jon|title=Gregson-Williams scores many toons|url=https://variety.com/2009/film/news/gregson-williams-scores-many-toons-1118002752/|accessdate=March 8, 2015|work=Variety|date=April 22, 2009|quote=The first three – "Antz," “Chicken Run" and "Shrek" – were jointly done by Gregson-Williams and Powell,...}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Powell (composer)|John Powell]] was left out to compose scores for later Shrek films with Williams due to a conflict.&lt;ref name = "George Lucas's Blockbusting"&gt;{{cite book|author = Alex Ben Block, Lucy Autrey Wilson |page=885|title  = George Lucas's Blockbusting: A Decade-by-Decade Survey of Timeless Movies Including Untold Secrets of Their Financial and Cultural Success| year = 2010| publisher = HarperCollins| isbn = 978-0061778896}}&lt;/ref&gt; The score was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]] by Nick Wollage and Slamm Andrews, with the latter mixing it at Media Ventures and Patricia Sullivan-Fourstar handling mastering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Shrek (Original Motion Picture Score) |id=302 066 308 2|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Shrek'' introduced a new element to give the film a unique feel. The film used [[pop music]] and other [[Oldies]] to make the story more forward. Covers of songs like "[[On the Road Again (Willie Nelson song)|On the Road Again]]" and "[[Try a Little Tenderness]]" were integrated in the film's score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Makin' Toons: Inside the Most Popular Animated TV Shows and Movies |last=Neuwirth |first=Allan |authorlink= |author2= |year=2003 |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc. |location= |isbn= |page=32|pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the film was about to be completed, Katzenberg suggested to the filmmakers to redo the film's ending to "go out with a big laugh"; instead of ending the film with just a storybook closing over Shrek and Fiona as they ride off into the sunset, they decided to add a song "I'm a Believer" covered by [[Smash Mouth]] and show all the fairytale creatures in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Neuwirth. 2003. p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Rufus Wainwright]]'s version of the song [[Hallelujah (Leonard Cohen song)|"Hallelujah"]] appeared in the soundtrack album, it was [[John Cale]]'s version that appeared in the film; in a radio interview, Rufus Wainwright suggested that his version of "Hallelujah" did not appear in the film due to the "glass ceiling" he was hitting because of his sexuality. An alternative explanation is that, although the filmmakers wanted Cale's version for the film, licensing issues prevented its use in the soundtrack album, because Wainwright was an artist for [[DreamWorks Records|DreamWorks]] but Cale was not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=There Will Be Rainbows: A Biography of Rufus Wainwright|last=Lake |first=Kirk |authorlink= |author2= |year=2010 |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc. |location= |isbn=978-0-06-198846-2 |page= |pages=141–142 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9_t9aUJBqT0C&amp;pg=PA141 |accessdate=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
In many places the film references classic movies, predominantly those by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]. When [[Tinker Bell]] falls on Donkey and he says "I can fly" and people around including the [[Three Little Pigs]] say "He can fly, he can fly"; this is a reference to Disney's ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]''. This scene is also a reference to the Disney film ''[[Dumbo]]'', where Donkey says, while flying, "You might have seen a house fly, maybe even a super fly, but I bet you ain't never seen a Donkey fly"&lt;ref name = "A List of Spoofs and References in PDI/DreamWorks Animated Shrek"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.digitalmediafx.com/Shrek/shrekfeature07.html | title=A List of Spoofs and References in PDI/DreamWorks Animated Shrek | publisher=digitalmediafx.com | year=2001 | accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene where Fiona is singing to the blue bird is a reference to ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.&lt;ref name = "A List of Spoofs and References in PDI/DreamWorks Animated Shrek"/&gt; The transformation scene at the end of the film strongly references to Disney's ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''.&lt;ref name = "A List of Spoofs and References in PDI/DreamWorks Animated Shrek"/&gt;

In the scene where the [[List of characters in the Shrek series#Magic Mirror|Magic Mirror]] gives [[Lord Farquaad]] the option to marry three princesses, it parodies popular American television show ''[[The Dating Game]]'' featuring: [[Cinderella]] and [[Snow White]].&lt;ref name="Zipes 2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zipes |first=Jack |year=2011 |title=The Enchanted Screen Unknown History of Fairy-Tale Films |location=UK |publisher=Routledge |isbn= 978-0-415-99061-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Lord Farquaad's theme park style kingdom Duloc heavily mimics [[Disneyland]], even in so far as parodying the famous '[[It's A Small World]]' musical ride in the scene with the singing puppets.&lt;ref name="Zipes 2011"/&gt;

==Release==

===Marketing===
In 2000, [[IMAX]] released ''[[CyberWorld]]'' onto its branded large-screen theaters. It was a compilation film that featured stereoscopic conversions of various animated shorts and sequences, including the bar sequence in ''[[Antz]]''. [[DreamWorks]] was so impressed by the technology used for the sequence's "stereoscopic translation", that the studio and IMAX decided to plan a big-screen 3D version of ''Shrek''. The film would have been re-released during the Christmas season of 2001, or the following summer, after its conventional 2D release. The re-release would have also included new sequences and an alternate ending. Plans for this was dropped due to "creative changes" instituted by DreamWorks and resulted in a loss of $1.18&amp;nbsp;million, down from IMAX's profit of $3.24&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://culture.com/news/item/1423/as-expected-imax-reports-a-loss.phtml|title=As Expected, Imax Reports A Loss|work=[[Studio Briefing]]|publisher=Culture.com|date=November 9, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/oct/13/features.megcarter?INTCMP=SRCH | title=Imax cinemas | work=The Guardian | date=October 13, 2000 | accessdate=February 10, 2012 | author=Carter, Meg | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/034/034402p1.html | title=Shrek Like Imax | publisher=IGN | date=June 8, 2000 | accessdate=February 10, 2012 | author=Linder, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Radio Disney]] was told not to allow any ads for the film to air on the station, stating, "Due to recent initiatives with [[The Walt Disney Company]], we are being asked not to align ourselves promotionally with this new release ''Shrek''.

The film was released by [[DreamWorks|DreamWorks Home Entertainment]] on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] on November 2, 2001. Both releases included ''[[Shrek in the Swamp Karaoke Dance Party]]'', a 3-minute musical short film, that takes up right after ''Shrek''{{'}}s ending, with film's characters performing a medley of modern pop songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobson|first=Colin|title=Shrek: Special Edition (2001)|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/shrek.shtml|publisher=DVD Movie Guide|accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Shrek'' was released to video the same day that Pixar's ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' hit theaters. Since videos were traditionally released on Tuesdays, Disney's executives did not receive this well, saying that the move "seemed like an underhanded attempt to siphon off some of their film's steam". DreamWorks responded that it "simply shifted the release to a Friday to make it more of an event and predicted that it and other studios would do so more frequently with important films." ''Monsters, Inc.'' earned that weekend more than $62&amp;nbsp;million, breaking the record for an animated film, while ''Shrek''{{'}}s video release made more than $100&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lyman|first=Rick|title=Fuzzy Creatures vs. Green Ogre; 'Monsters, Inc.' and 'Shrek' Are Likely Foes for New Oscar|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/21/movies/fuzzy-creatures-vs-green-ogre-monsters-shrek-are-likely-foes-for-new-oscar.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=March 13, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 21, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually became the biggest selling DVD of all time with over 5.5&amp;nbsp;million sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/dec/13/news?INTCMP=SRCH | title=Pearl Harbor cleans up on DVD | work=The Guardian | date=December 13, 2001 | accessdate=February 10, 2012 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous films and TV shows, such as ''[[Fractured Fairy Tales]]'' and ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'', have parodied the traditional fairy tale.&lt;ref name = "Time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1619573,00.html |title=Is Shrek Bad for Kids? |work=Time |date=May 10, 2007 |first=James |last=Poniewozik}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Shrek'' itself has noticeably influenced the current generation of mainstream animated films.&lt;ref name = "Time"/&gt; Particularly after ''Shrek 2'', animated films began to incorporate more [[popular culture|pop culture]] references and end-film musical numbers.&lt;ref name = "Time"/&gt; Such elements can be seen in films like ''[[Robots (2005 film)|Robots]]'' and ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]''.&lt;ref name = "Time"/&gt; It also inspired a number of computer animated films which also spoofed fairy tales, or other related story genres, often including adult-oriented humor, most of which were not nearly as successful as ''Shrek'', such as ''[[Happily N'Ever After]]'', ''[[Igor (film)|Igor]]'', and ''[[Hoodwinked!]]''&lt;ref name = "Time"/&gt;

'''Stanley Louis&lt;!--see VIAF data--&gt; Cavell''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|v|ɛ|l}}; September 1, 1926 – June 19, 2018) was an [[American philosopher]]. He was the [[Cabot family|Walter M. Cabot]] Professor of Aesthetics and the General Theory of Value, Emeritus, at [[Harvard University]].  He worked in the fields of [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], and [[ordinary language philosophy]].  As an interpreter, he produced influential works on [[Wittgenstein]], [[J.L. Austin|Austin]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]], [[Thoreau]], and [[Heidegger]].  His work is characterized by its conversational tone and frequent literary references.

==Life==
Cavell was born to a [[Jewish]] family in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. His mother, a locally renowned pianist, trained him in music from his earliest days.&lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 21 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; During the Depression, Cavell’s parents moved several times between Atlanta and [[Sacramento, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 24 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; As an adolescent, Cavell played lead [[alto saxophone]] as the youngest member of a black jazz band in Sacramento.&lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 169 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  He entered the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he majored in music, studying with, among others, [[Bob Thompson (musician)]], [[Roger Sessions]] and [[Ernest Bloch]].&lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 85, 183  (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  After graduation, he studied composition at the [[Juilliard School]] of Music in [[New York City]], only to discover that music was not his calling.&lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 220-225 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

He entered graduate school at [[UCLA]], studying philosophy, and then transferred to [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 247 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  As a student there he came under the influence of [[J. L. Austin]], whose teaching and methods "knocked him off ... [his] horse."&lt;ref&gt;The Claim of Reason: Wittgenstein, Skepticism, Morality and Tragedy, xv (New York: Oxford, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954 he was awarded a Junior Fellowship at the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]]. Before completing his Ph.D., he became an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 326 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Cavell's daughter by his first wife (Marcia Cavell), Rachel Lee Cavell, was born in 1957. From 1962–1963 Cavell was a Fellow at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], where he befriended the British philosopher [[Bernard Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 149 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Cavell’s marriage to Marcia ended in divorce in 1961. In 1963 he returned to the Harvard Philosophy Department, where he became the Walter M. Cabot Professor of Aesthetics and the General Theory of Value.&lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 435 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1964, Cavell joined a group of graduate students, who taught at [[Tougaloo College]], a [[historically black]] college in Mississippi, as part of what became known as the [[Freedom Summer]].&lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 373 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; He and Cathleen (Cohen) Cavell were married in 1967. In April 1969, during the student protests (chiefly arising from the [[Vietnam War]]), Cavell, helped by his colleague [[John Rawls]], worked with a group of African-American students to draft language for a vote by the faculty that established the Department of African and African-American Studies at Harvard.&lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 508–512 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Cavell's first son Benjamin was born. In 1979, along with the documentary filmmaker [[Robert H. Gardner|Robert Gardner]], Cavell helped found the [[Harvard Film Archive]], to preserve and present the history of film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2007novedec/cavell.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Cavell received a [[MacArthur Fellowship]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~phildept/cavell.html]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1996-1997 Cavell was President of the [[American Philosophical Association]] (Eastern Division). In 1984, his second son David was born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~phildept/cavell.html]&lt;/ref&gt; He remained on the Harvard faculty until his retirement in 1997. After retiring, he taught courses at [[Yale University]] and the [[University of Chicago]]. He also held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of Amsterdam]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uva.nl/en/disciplines/philosophy/home/components-centrecolumn/the-spinoza-chair.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavell died in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] of [[heart failure]] on June 19, 2018 at the age of 91.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/obituaries/stanley-cavell-prominent-harvard-philosopher-dies-at-91.html|title=Stanley Cavell, Prominent Harvard Philosopher, Dies at 91|publisher=The New York Times|date=June 20, 2018|accessdate=June 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/bostonglobe/obituary.aspx?n=stanley-cavell&amp;pid=189347645&amp;referrer=0&amp;preview=false Stanley Cavell Obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Although trained in the Anglo-American [[analytical philosophy|analytic tradition]], Cavell frequently interacted with the [[continental philosophy|continental tradition]]. He includes [[film]] and [[literary criticism|literary]] study in philosophical inquiry. Cavell writes extensively on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[J. L. Austin]], and [[Martin Heidegger]], as well as on the [[Transcendentalism|American transcendentalists]] [[Henry Thoreau]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. He interprets Wittgenstein in a fashion known as the [[New Wittgenstein]]. Cavell's writing incorporates autobiographical elements concerning how his movement between and within the ideas of these thinkers influenced and influences his own thinking that impacted spheres in the arts and humanities beyond the technical study of philosophy.

A scholarly journal, the ''Conversations: The Journal of Cavellian Studies'', engages with his philosophical work. It is edited by [[Sérgio Dias Branco]] and Amir Khan and published by the [[University of Ottawa]].

Cavell established his distinct philosophical identity with ''Must We Mean What We Say?'' (1969), which addresses topics such as language use, metaphor, skepticism, tragedy, and literary interpretation, from the point of view of [[ordinary language philosophy]], of which he is a practitioner and ardent defender. One of the essays discusses [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s work on revelation and authority, ''[[The Book on Adler]]'', in an effort to help re-introduce the book to modern philosophical readers.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Religion'', vol. 57, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The World Viewed'' (1971) Cavell looks at photography and film. He also covers modernism in art and the nature of media, where he mentions the influence of art critic [[Michael Fried]]'s writing on his work.

Cavell is perhaps best known for his book, ''The Claim of Reason: Wittgenstein, Skepticism, Morality, and Tragedy'' (1979), which forms the centerpiece of his work, and which has its origins in his doctoral dissertation. In ''Pursuits of Happiness'' (1981), Cavell describes his experience of seven prominent Hollywood comedies: ''[[The Lady Eve]]'', ''[[It Happened One Night]]'', ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'', ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'', ''[[His Girl Friday]]'', ''[[Adam’s Rib]]'', and ''[[The Awful Truth]]''.  Cavell argues that these films, from the years 1934–1949, form part of what he calls the genre of "[[remarriage|The Comedy of Remarriage]]," and he finds in them great philosophical, moral, and indeed political significance. Specifically, Cavell argues that these Hollywood comedies show that "the achievement of happiness requires not the [...] satisfaction of our needs [...] but the examination and transformation of those needs."&lt;ref&gt;Cavell, ''Pursuits of Happiness'', 1981, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Cavell, the emphasis that these movies place on "[[Comedy of remarriage|remarriage]]" draws attention to the fact that, within a relationship, happiness requires "growing up" together with one's partner.&lt;ref&gt;Cavell, ''Pursuits of Happiness'', 1981, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Cities of Words'' (2004) Cavell traces the history of [[moral perfectionism]], a mode of moral thinking spanning the history of Western philosophy and literature. Having used Emerson to outline the concept, this book suggests ways we might want to understand philosophy, literature, and film as preoccupied with features of perfectionism. In ''Philosophy the Day After Tomorrow'' (2005), a collection of essays, Cavell makes the case that J. L. Austin's concept of [[performative utterance]] requires the supplementary concept of ''passionate utterance'': "A performative utterance is an offer of participation in the order of law. And perhaps we can say: A passionate utterance is an invitation to improvisation in the disorders of desire."&lt;ref&gt;Cavell, ''Philosophy the Day after Tomorrow'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts, &amp; London: Harvard University Press, 2005), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The book also contains extended discussions of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Jane Austen]], [[George Eliot]], [[Henry James]], and [[Fred Astaire]], as well as familiar Cavellian subjects such as [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], Emerson, Thoreau, Wittgenstein, and Heidegger. Cavell's final book, ''Little Did I Know: Excerpts from Memory'' (2010), is an autobiography written in the form of a diary. In a series of consecutive, dated entries, Cavell inquires about the origins of his philosophy by telling the story of his life.

The '''state of nature''' is a concept used in [[Ethics|moral]] and [[political philosophy]], [[religion]], [[social contract]] theories and international law&lt;ref&gt;[[Emer de Vattel]], ''The Law of Nations'', Preliminaries. Idea and General Principles. §4.&lt;/ref&gt; to denote the hypothetical conditions of what the lives of people might have been like before [[Society#Conceptions|societies]] came into existence. Philosophers of the state of nature theory deduce that there must have been a time before [[Society#Conceptions|organized societies]] existed, and this presumption thus raises questions such as: "What was life like before [[civil society]]?"; "How did government first emerge from such a starting position?," and; "What are the hypothetical reasons for entering a state of society by establishing a nation-state?".

In some versions of social contract theory, there are no rights in the state of nature, only freedoms, and it is the contract that creates rights and obligations. In other versions the opposite occurs: the contract imposes restrictions upon individuals that curtail their [[natural rights]].

Societies existing before or without a [[state (polity)|political state]] are currently studied in such fields as [[paleolithic]] [[history]], and the anthropological subfields of [[archaeology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[social anthropology]], and [[ethnology]], which investigate the social and power-related structures of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] and [[uncontacted peoples]] living in [[Tribe|tribal communities]].

=== Mozi (墨子)  ===
The early [[Warring States period|Warring States]] philosopher [[Mozi]] was the first thinker in ancient China to develop an ideal state of nature as a premise to defend the need of a single ruler in a state. According to him, on that state each person have their own moral (yi:義). As a result, people were unable to reach agreements and resources were wasted. Since his philosophy promotes the actions that leads to the benefit (li:利) of the state, such natural organization was rejected:&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the beginning of human life, when there was yet no law and government, the custom was "everybody according to his moral (yi:義)." Accordingly each man had his own moral, two men had two different morals and ten men had ten different morals -- the more people the more different notions. And everybody approved of his own moral and disapproved the views of others, and so arose mutual disapproval among men. As a result, father and son and elder and younger brothers became enemies and were estranged from each other, since they were unable to reach any agreement. Everybody worked for the disadvantage of the others with water, fire, and poison. Surplus energy was not spent for mutual aid; surplus goods were allowed to rot without sharing; excellent teachings (dao:道) were kept secret and not revealed." Chapter 3 - 1&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ctext.org/mozi/identification-with-the-superior-i/ens|title=Mozi|last=Adapted from Mei translation of the|first=|date=|website=Ctext|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;His proposal was to unify morals according to a single [[Fa (concept)|standard]] (fa:法) that can be used by anyone: calculating benefit of each act. In that way, the ruler of the state and his subjects will have the same morals; cooperation and joint efforts will be the rule. Later his proposal was strongly rejected by [[confucianism]] (especially [[Mencius]]) because of the preference of benefit over morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;dq=a+daoist+theory+of+chinese&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought: A Philosophical Interpretation|last=Hansen|first=Chad|date=2000-08-17|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780195350760|location=|pages=158–162|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas Hobbes===
The pure state of nature or "the natural condition of mankind" was described by the 17th century English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]], in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' and in his earlier work ''[[On the Citizen]]''.&lt;ref name="Leviathan"&gt;Hobbes, Thomas, ''Leviathan''. 1651. Edwin Curley (Ed.) 1994. Hackett Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes argued that all humans are by nature equal in faculties of body and mind (i.e., no ''natural'' inequalities are so great as to give anyone a "claim" to an exclusive "benefit"). From this equality and other causes {{Examples|date=June 2018}}in human nature, everyone is naturally willing to fight one another: so that "during the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called warre; and such a warre as is of every man against every man". In this state every person has a [[natural right]] or liberty to do anything one thinks necessary for preserving one's own life; and life is "solitary, poor, [[nasty, brutish, and short]]" (''Leviathan,'' Chapters XIII–XIV). Hobbes described this natural condition with the Latin phrase ''[[bellum omnium contra omnes]]'' (meaning war of all against all), in his work ''[[De Cive]]''.

Within the state of nature there is neither personal property nor injustice since there is no law, except for certain natural precepts discovered by reason ("[[Natural law|laws of nature]]"): the first of which is "that every man ought to endeavour peace, as far as he has hope of obtaining it" (''Leviathan'', Ch. XIV); and the second is "that a man be willing, when others are so too, as far forth as for peace and defence of himself he shall think it necessary, to lay down this right to all things; and be contented with so much liberty against other men as he would allow other men against himself" (''loc. cit.''). From here Hobbes develops the way out of the state of nature into political society and government, by [[Social Contract|mutual contracts]].

According to Hobbes the state of nature exists at all times among independent countries, over whom there is no law except for those same precepts or laws of nature (''Leviathan'', Chapters XIII, XXX end). His view of the state of nature helped to serve as a basis for theories of international law and relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yurdusev|first1=A.

=== John Locke ===
[[John Locke]] considers the state of nature in his ''[[Second Treatise on Civil Government]]'' written around the time of the [[Exclusion Crisis]] in England during the 1680s. For Locke, in the state of nature all men are free "to order their actions, and dispose of their possessions and persons, as they think fit, within the bounds of the law of nature." (2nd Tr., §4). "The state of Nature has a law of Nature to govern it", and that law is reason. Locke believes that reason teaches that "no one ought to harm another in his life, liberty, and or property" (2nd Tr., §6) ; and that transgressions of this may be punished. Locke describes the state of nature and civil society to be opposites of each other, and the need for civil society comes in part from the perpetual existence of the state of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldwin|first1=Robert|title=Locke's State of Nature in Political Society|journal=The Western Political Quarterly|date=March 1976|volume=29|issue=1|page=126|doi=10.2307/447588|jstor=447588}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view of the state of nature is partly deduced from Christian belief (unlike Hobbes, whose philosophy is not dependent upon any prior theology).

Although it may be natural to assume that Locke was responding to Hobbes, Locke never refers to Hobbes by name, and may instead have been responding to other writers of the day, like [[Robert Filmer]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Quentin Skinner|Skinner, Quentin]]. ''Visions of Politics''. Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Locke's First Treatise is entirely a response to Filmer's ''Patriarcha'', and takes a step by step method to refuting Filmer's theory set out in ''Patriarcha''. The conservative party at the time had rallied behind Filmer's ''Patriarcha'', whereas the Whigs, scared of another prosecution of Anglicans and Protestants, rallied behind the theory set out by Locke in his ''Two Treatises of Government'' as it gave a clear theory as to why the people would be justified in overthrowing a monarchy which abuses the trust they had placed in it.{{citation needed|reason=A causal historical claim that needs to be sourced|date=February 2016}}

=== Montesquieu ===
[[Montesquieu]] makes use of the concept of the state of nature in his ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', first printed in 1748. Montesquieu states the thought process behind early human beings before the formation of society. He says that human beings would have the faculty of knowing and would first think to preserve their life in the state. Human beings would also at first feel themselves to be impotent and weak. As a result, humans would not be likely to attack each other in this state. Next, humans would seek nourishment and out of fear, and impulse would eventually unite to create society. Once society was created, a state of war would ensue amongst societies which would have been all created the same way. The purpose of war is the preservation of the society and the self. The formation of law within society is the reflection and application of reason for Montesquieu.&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Thomas Nugent, revised by J. V. Prichard.

=== Jean-Jacques Rousseau ===
Hobbes' view was challenged in the eighteenth century by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who claimed that Hobbes was taking socialized people and simply imagining them living outside of the society in which they were raised. He affirmed instead that people were neither good nor bad, but were born as a blank slate, and later society and the environment influence which way we lean. In Rousseau's state of nature, people did not know each other enough to come into serious conflict and they did have normal values. The modern society, and the ownership it entails, is blamed for the disruption of the state of nature which Rousseau sees as true freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Jacques Rousseau, ''A Discourse on Inequality''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== David Hume ===
[[David Hume]] offers in ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' (1739) that human beings are naturally social: "'Tis utterly impossible for men to remain any considerable time in that savage condition, which precedes society; but that his very first state and situation may justly be esteem'd social. This, however, hinders not, but that philosophers may, if they please, extend their reasoning to the suppos'd state of nature; provided they allow it to be a mere philosophical fiction, which never had, and never cou'd have any reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hume|first1=David|title=A Treatise of Human Nature|date=1739|publisher=Project Gutenberg|pages=Book III, Part II, Section II|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4705/4705-h/4705-h.htm#link2H_4_0089|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's ideas about human nature expressed in the ''Treatise'' suggest that he would be happy with neither Hobbes' nor his contemporary Rousseau's thought-experiments. He explicitly derides as incredible the hypothetical humanity described in Hobbes' ''Leviathan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hume|first1=David|title=A Treatise of Human Nature|date=1739|publisher=Project Gutenberg|pages=Book II, Part III, Section I|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4705/4705-h/4705-h.htm#link2H_4_0089|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, he argues in "Of the Origin of Justice and Property" that if mankind were universally benevolent, we would not hold Justice to be a virtue: "’tis only from the selfishness and confin’d generosity of men, along with the scanty provision nature has made for his wants, that justice derives its origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hume|first1=David|title=A Treatise of Human Nature|date=1739|publisher=Project Gutenberg|pages=Book III, Part II, Section II|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4705/4705-h/4705-h.htm#link2H_4_0089|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Calhoun===

[[John C. Calhoun]], in his ''Disquisition on Government'', (1850) wrote that a state of nature is merely hypothetical and argues that the concept is self-contradictory and that political states naturally always existed.  "It is, indeed, difficult to explain how an opinion so destitute of all sound reason, ever could have been so extensively entertained, ... I refer to the assertion, that all men are equal in the state of nature; meaning, by a state of nature, a state of individuality, supposed to have existed prior to the social and political state; and in which men lived apart and independent of each other... But such a state is purely hypothetical. It never did, nor can exist; as it is inconsistent with the preservation and perpetuation of the race. It is, therefore, a great misnomer to call it the state of nature. Instead of being the natural state of man, it is, of all conceivable states, the most opposed to his nature—most repugnant to his feelings, and most incompatible with his wants. His natural state is, the social and political—the one for which his Creator made him, and the only one in which he can preserve and perfect his race. As, then, there never was such a state as the, so called, state of nature, and never can be, it follows, that men, instead of being born in it, are born in the social and political state; and of course, instead of being born free and equal, are born subject, not only to parental authority, but to the laws and institutions of the country where born, and under whose protection they draw their first breath."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Calhoun|first1=John|title=Disquisition on Government|url=http://www.constitution.org/jcc/disq_gov.htm|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|20th century}}
=== John Rawls ===
[[John Rawls]] used what amounted to an artificial state of nature. To develop his [[A Theory of Justice|theory of justice]], Rawls places everyone in the [[original position]]. The original position is a hypothetical state of nature used as a [[thought experiment]]. People in the original position have no society and are under a [[veil of ignorance (philosophy)|veil of ignorance]] that prevents them from knowing how they may benefit from society. They lack foreknowledge of their intelligence, wealth, or abilities. Rawls reasons that people in the original position would want a society where they had their basic liberties protected and where they had some economic guarantees as well. If society were to be constructed from scratch through a social agreement between individuals, these principles would be the expected basis of such an agreement. Thus, these principles should form the basis of real, modern societies since everyone should consent to them if society were organized from scratch in fair agreements.

=== Robert Nozick ===
Rawls' Harvard colleague [[Robert Nozick]] countered the liberal ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' with the libertarian ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', also grounded in the state of nature tradition.&lt;ref name="Rothbard"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rothbard |first=Murray N. |authorlink=Murray Rothbard |title=Robert Nozick and the Immaculate Conception of the State |journal= Journal of Libertarian Studies |volume= 1, Num 1. |pages= 45–47 |year=1977 |url= https://mises.org/journals/jls/1_1/1_1_6.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nozick argued that a minimalist state of property rights and basic law enforcement would develop out of a state of nature without violating anyone's rights or using force. Mutual agreements among individuals rather than social contract would lead to this minimal state.

== Between nations ==
In Hobbes' view, once a civil government is instituted, the state of nature has disappeared between individuals because of the civil power which exists to enforce contracts and the laws of nature generally. Between nations, however, no such power exists and therefore nations have the same rights to preserve themselves—including making war—as individuals possessed. Such a conclusion led some writers to the idea of an association of nations or worldwide [[civil society]]. Among them there were [[Immanuel Kant]] with his work on [[perpetual peace]]. This aim was taken up by former US President [[George H W Bush]] in the drive to create a "New World Order" which he describes as "a world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the conduct of nations".

Rawls also examines the state of nature between nations. In his work the ''[[Law of Peoples]]'', Rawls applies a modified version of his original position thought experiment to international relationships. Rawls says that peoples, not states, form the basic unit that should be examined. States should be encouraged to follow the principles from Rawls' earlier ''A Theory of Justice''. [[Democracy]] seems like it would be the most logical means of accomplishing these goals, but benign non-democracies should be seen as acceptable at the international stage. Rawls develops eight principles for how a people should act on an international stage.

The '''Statement of 1000''' was a statement by 1000 Syrian intellectuals in January 2001, during the [[Damascus Spring]], following the earlier [[Statement of 99]] made in September 2000. The Statement of 1000 was more detailed than the earlier statement, criticising the effective one-party rule of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Ba'ath Party]] and calling for multiparty democracy, with an independent judiciary and without [[Human rights in Syria|discrimination against women]].&lt;ref name="Wikas_Battling_Lion" /&gt;

The '''Sun temple of Userkaf''' was an Ancient [[Egyptian temple]] dedicated to the sun god [[Ra]] built by [[pharaoh]] [[Userkaf]], the founder of the [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt]], at the beginning of the [[25th century BCE]]. The sun temple of Userkaf lies between the [[Abusir]] pyramid field to the south and the locality of [[Abu Gurab]] to the north, some {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of modern-day Cairo. The ancient name of the temple was ''Nekhen-Re'' meaning the "Stronghold of Ra". The temple complex comprised several parts: on a low hill situated on the desert edge was the main temple which could be accessed via a causeway from a valley temple, located nearer to the area of cultivation and the Nile.

==Excavations==
The sun temple of Userkaf was discovered by [[Karl Richard Lepsius]] in 1842, then director of the Prussian expedition to Egypt. Lepsius did not recognised the sun temple as such and rather included it in his pioneering [[Lepsius list of pyramids|list of pyramids]], under the number XVII. Lepsius only investigated the monument superficially and the first excavations of the temple took place much later, in 1907 and 1913, under the direction of [[Ludwig Borchardt]]. Borchardt's main work however was on the nearby royal cemetery at Abusir. The temple was the focus of a dedicated excavation only 40 years later, between in 1954 to 1957, this time under the impulse of the German-Swiss expedition led by [[Herbert Ricke]].&lt;ref&gt;Ricke: ''Sonnenheiligtum, I'', 2&lt;/ref&gt; The results were published in two volumes.

==Temple layout==
[[File:Userkaf SolarTemple and ValleyTemple Abusir.svg|thumb|300px|right|Plan of the sun temple of Userkaf]]
The temple was found heavily destroyed so that any reconstruction remains very problematic. The main temple consisted originally of one big solid [[mastaba]]–like structure with a mast on top. This can be guessed from references in texts where the temple is depicted as mastaba with a mast. It was surrounded by a wall, two chapels or offering chapels were placed in front of this main structure. They each had only one room. In a later phase the main structure received an obelisk–shaped top. An altar was added in front of the building.&lt;ref&gt;Ricke: ''Sonnenheiligtum, I'', 3-31&lt;/ref&gt; The temple was most likely erected in year 5 or 6 of the king's reign, as it is mentioned on the [[Palermo stone]] (the remains of annals).&lt;ref&gt;Ricke: ''Sonnenheiligtum, I'', 15&lt;/ref&gt; The obelisk was most likely not added under Userkaf, but under one of his successors, perhaps under king [[Neferirkare]]. The obelisk shape of the top can be concluded from the writing of the temple name in Old Kingdom texts. From the reign of the latter king on, the name is always written with an obelisk.&lt;ref&gt;Ricke: ''Sonnenheiligtum, I'', 18&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there are firm archaeological reasons for the obelisk. One corner piece from the top edge of the obelisk was found.It is made of granite.&lt;ref&gt;Ricke: ''Sonnenheiligtum, I'', 13, fig. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Remains of at least two statue shrines were found. They were made of [[greywacke]] and decorated with a pattern, imitating matting or wooden beams.&lt;ref&gt;Ricke: ''Sonnenheiligtum, I'', 20-22&lt;/ref&gt;

The valley temple was found heavily destroyed too. It had most likely an open court with pillars and several chapels at the back. The number of these chapels is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Ricke: ''Sonnenheiligtum, I'', 35-47&lt;/ref&gt; In the debris of the temple was found a stone head of a king, most likely king Userkaf. It is possible that the stone temple was not built under Userkaf, but later perhaps under Niuserre. There were found building marks that are otherwise only attested for this king. Both temples were not decorated with any reliefs or inscriptions, at least nothing of this survived.

Many seal impressions were found. Most of them bear king's names. King Userkaf, [[Sahure]], [[Niuserre]], [[Djedkare]] and [[Unas]] are attested, providing evidence that the temple was used at least till the end of the Fifth Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Edel, et. al.: ''Das Sonnenheiligtum des Königs II'', 83&lt;/ref&gt; This is also confirmed by the pottery found. In contrast, the valley temple was in use till the end of the Sixth Dynasty, according to the pottery evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Edel, et. al.: ''Das Sonnenheiligtum des Königs II'', 82&lt;/ref&gt; From the New Kingdom come several visitor inscriptions, one of them was made by the ''reporter of the king'' Iamunedjeh, a person well known from other sources. He lived under [[Thutmoses III]], about 1000 years after the building was erected. In his inscription, the temple is described as ''pyramid'' (Egyptian: ''mr''). Evidently, the obelisk had collapsed by the New Kingdom and the remains were interpreted as pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;Edel, et. al.: ''Das Sonnenheiligtum des Königs II'', 115-118&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6316">'''Syntactic gemination''', or '''syntactic doubling''', is an [[external sandhi]] phenomenon in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and some [[Western Romance languages]]. It consists in the lengthening ([[gemination]]) of the initial consonant in certain contexts.

The phenomenon is variously referred to in [[English language|English]] as '''word-initial gemination''', '''phonosyntactic consonantal gemination''', as well as under the native Italian terms: '''raddoppiamento sintattico (RS), raddoppiamento fonosintattico (RF), raddoppiamento iniziale, rafforzamento iniziale (della consonante)'''

In Standard Italian, syntactic doubling occurs after the following words (with exceptions described below):
*all stressed ("strong") [[monosyllable]]s (''monosillabi forti'') and many unstressed ("weak") monosyllables: è, e, o, a, da, fra, che, se, ma, più, può, gru, gnu, re, blu, tre, ciò, sì, già, giù, là, lì, qua, qui, né, sci, tè

[[Article (grammar)|Article]]s, [[clitic]] [[pronoun]]s (mi, ti, lo, etc.) and various [[particle (grammar)|particle]]s do not cause doubling, although [[assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]] in colloquial speech can produce similar phonetic results: /il kane/ → [ikˈkaːne] 'the dog'. 

The cases of doubling are commonly classified as "stress-induced doubling" and "lexical".&lt;ref name=borelli&gt;Doris Borrelli (2002) "Raddoppiamento Sintattico in Italian: A Synchronic and Diachronic Cross-Dialectical Study" (Outstanding Dissertations in Linguistics) [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-415-94207-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Syntactic" means that gemination spans word boundaries, as opposed to word-internal [[geminated]] consonants: ''[[grappa]]'' [ˈɡrap.pa].&lt;ref name=borelli/&gt; The emergence of syntactic doubling has traditionally been explained by a [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] phenomenon of the loss of terminal consonants in Italian during its evolution from [[Latin]] (''ad'' &gt; ''a'', ''quid'' &gt; ''qui'', etc.), but more recent research also pays attention to [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] aspects.&lt;ref name=borelli/&gt;

In some phonemic transcriptions, such as in the [[Zingarelli]] dictionary, words that trigger syntactic gemination are marked with an asterisk: the [[preposition]] "a" is transcribed as /a*/.

==Regional occurrence in Italian==
Syntactic gemination is the normal native pronunciation in [[Tuscany]], [[Central Italy]] (both "stress-induced" and "lexical") and [[Southern Italy]] (only "lexical"), including [[Sicily]] and [[Corsica]]. In [[Northern Italy]], along with [[Sardinia]], speakers use it inconsistently because the feature is not present in the dialectal [[substratum]] and is not usually shown in the written language unless a new word is produced by the fusion of the two: ''"chi sa"''-&gt; ''chissà'' ("who knows" in the sense of ''goodness knows'').

==Exceptions==
It does not occur in the following cases:
*a [[pausa|pause]] is on the boundary of word in question&lt;ref name=ash2002&gt;Absalom, Matthew, Stevens, Mary, and Hajek, John, [http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/archive/00001538/ "A Typology of Spreading, Insertion and Deletion or What You Weren’t Told About Raddoppiamento Sintattico in Italian"], in "Proc. 2002 Conference of the [[Australian Linguistic Society]]", [[Macquarie University]] ([http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/archive/00001538/01/Absalom_et_al.pdf e-print pdf file])&lt;/ref&gt;
**In particular, initial gemination may be conditioned by syntax, which determines the likelihood of pause. For example, in the phrase "{{italics correction|''La volpe ne aveva mangiato metà prima di addormentarsi''}}" ("The fox had eaten half of it before falling asleep"), there is no gemination after ''metà'' if there is even a slight pause, as ''prima'' is part of the [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]], a sentence element that is easily isolated phonologically from the main clause within the [[prosodic hierarchy]] of the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;Nespor, Marina &amp; Irene Vogel (1986). Prosodic Phonology. Dordrecht: [[Foris]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*the stressed final vowel is lengthened.&lt;ref name=ash2002/&gt;
*a sharp break or change occurs in the [[intonation (linguistics)|pitch]] on the word boundary.&lt;ref name=ash2002/&gt;

There are other considerations, especially in various dialects, so the initial gemination is subject to complicated lexical, syntactic and phonological/[[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] conditions.

'''Textbookrental.ca''' is a textbook rental service company, based in Canada. Its services include textbook rentals,&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Tai, [http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/andrew-tai-/avoid-ripoffs_b_6646846.html "How to Stop Big Companies from Ripping You Off"]. ''Huffington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.actualitte.com/article/monde-edition/chapters-indigo-lance-une-e-boutique-de-manuels-scolaires/35571 "Chapters Indigo lance une e-boutique de manuels scolaires"]. ''Actualitté.com'' September 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; used textbook sales, a buyback program, and instore kiosks in university bookstores.

==History==
[[File:Kiosk stand of textbookrental.ca.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Textbookrental.ca in store Kiosk]]

Textbookrental.ca was established in 2010 by entrepreneurs Gershon Hurwitz and Mike Stock,&lt;ref name="Maclean's2010"/&gt;  in response to student concerns about the rising cost of textbooks.&lt;ref name="Moneyville"/&gt;  By 2011, the online store was selling textbooks at a discount and renting texts, allowing searching by textbook [[ISBN]], author, and title, selecting a 2, 3, or 6 month (semester) rental period, and shipping options. Once the semester is over, books are returned with a free return shipping label,&lt;ref name="CTV2011"/&gt; or in person at 11 depots.&lt;ref name="Sil2012"/&gt;&lt;!-- quotes should be in quotes, otherwise paraphrase --&gt;

The company also set up a service to buy back used books,&lt;ref name="Sil2012"/&gt; either by paying cash for books dropped off at a depot location near campus, by providing a free shipping label from the website to ship the books to the company.&lt;ref name="Globe2011"/&gt;

In 2013, Textbookrental.ca raised $415,000 of seed funding, mainly from Seek Capital, to expand its business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stockhouse.com/news/business-news/2013/07/29/textbookrental-ca-snares-$415k-seed-cash,-just-in  "TextbookRental.ca snares $415k seed cash, just in time for school"]. ''Stockhouse Editorial''. July 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
In  2014 it continues to be privately owned and is managed by the founders together with an executive team.

== Partnerships ==

Textbookrental.ca has teamed up with Conestoga college Ontario to provide students with an online rental option. Students can rent their textbooks online 24 hours a day.&lt;ref name="Conestoga"/&gt; Later the company made arrangements with other colleges, including Lakehead&lt;ref&gt;Jon Pukila.

'''''The Goodbye Family''''' are a fictional family of [[undertaker]]s from the [[Weird West|Old Weird West]] of author and illustrator [[Lorin Morgan-Richards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scbwi.org/members-public/lorin-morgan-richards-2 |title=Public Profile |publisher=SCBWI |date=2014-10-15 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steamkat.com/goodbyeanniversary-2/ |title=An Interview with Lorin Morgan-Richards |publisher=SteamKat! |date=2016-11-28 |accessdate=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Goodbye Family comprises Pyridine Goodbye, matriarch and [[mortician]], Otis, father and driver of the [[hearse]], their child Orphie, who has the dual role of [[gravedigger]] and self-appointed town Sheriff, and their pets: Ouiji the cat, a tarantula named Dorian, and Midnight their horse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lorinrichards.com/GoodbyeFamily.html |title=Lorin Morgan-Richards - The Goodbye Family |publisher=Lorinrichards.com |date= |accessdate=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Since 2009, the Goodbyes have appeared in both [[Panel (comics)|single panel comic]] and literature as part of the Great Mountain book series by Richards that begin with ''Me’ma and the Great Mountain''. The humor of the Goodbye Family is typically [[macabre]], often satirizing [[industrialization]] and rules of authority. 

==Characters and story==
Beginning in 2009, Richards started to produce the Goodbye Family as one-off cards after an inspiring trip to [[France]] and [[Wales]]. Richards envisioned Orphie, the daughter, and primary character, on the roof of the [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] sitting with gargoyles, while her parents Otis tried to board a train with a [[shrunken head]], and Pyridine publicly sewed a cadaver in Cardiff. Subsequent single panel comics and merchandise made of each character but before delving into their identities. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americymru.blogspot.com/2010/08/ |title=AmeriCymru: 8/1/10 - 9/1/10 |publisher=Americymru.blogspot.com |date=2010-10-10 |accessdate=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, A Raven Above Press released Richards first novel ''[[Me’ma and the Great Mountain]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fictiondb.com/author/lorin-morgan-richards~mema-and-the-great-mountain~1556333~b.htm |title=Me'ma and the Great Mountain by Lorin Morgan-Richards |publisher=FictionDB |date= |accessdate=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Name |url=https://advicefromacaterpillar.wordpress.com/2012/04/26/review-mema-and-the-great-mountain/ |title=Review: Me’ma and the Great Mountain &amp;#124; Advice from a Caterpillar |publisher=Advicefromacaterpillar.wordpress.com |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; about an indigenous girl that overcomes [[ghoul|ghoulish]] spirits to save her people. Along with her journey, she meets Hollis Sorrow, a friendly character entombed in a casket made by the Goodbye Family, marking the first mention in literature of the Goodbye Family. By 2015, Steamkat, an online comic distributor, weekly featured The Goodbye Family comic, and in the following year, Richards released subsequent book collections about the family.

* '''Orphie''': Daughter who loves mischief and has the strength of 20 men – which comes in handy when carrying caskets and as a gravedigger. She finds herself most often filling in as sheriff of the town and training her pet spider Dorian.
* '''Otis''': Driver of their funeral hearse with an uncanny ability to smell demise a mile away. He is in charge of all the wakes. He spends his free time walking his hat and feeding their horse Midnight various pickled things. 
* '''Pyridine''': Matriarch and mortician of the family. She enjoys needling cadaviers and social gatherings with the undead. 
* '''Ouiji''': the family cat. Believed to be part [[Siamese cat|Siamese]] due to her glowing red eyes.
* '''Dorian''': Orphie’s pet tarantula (specifically a Needlepoint Tarantula) that loves to spin webbed accessories for the family. 
* '''Midnight''': Most likely a [[Friesian horse]], she is the Goodbye's main implement of travel for both single rider and carriage. She characteristically is fueled by pickled things.

In an interview, when asked about the characters influences Richards replied: "I suppose Pyridine Goodbye, the matriarch, is loosely based on my wife, Otis Goodbye is myself, and Orphie their child is Berlin (Richards daughter) and our friend's child Heidi (who came before our daughter). All though with a few other influences. Just like the Goodbye Family we do have a pet tarantula and Siamese cat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inspirationmatters.org/Interviewshow.aspx?name=Lorin+Morgan-Richards&amp;id=76&amp;totalrec=8&amp;Alpha=L |title=Inspirational Story/Interview with Lorin Morgan-Richards |publisher=Inspirationmatters.org |date= |accessdate=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humor==
Richards clarifies the genre of ''The Goodbye Family'': ''I fall into the category of [[Weird West]], but I think it may be more of a “Down West” as I’d like to call it, for its sense of macabre western humor.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newswhistle.com/the-dreaded-summons-our-qa-with-author-lorin-morgan-richards/ |title=The Dreaded Summons – Our Q&amp;A with Author Lorin Morgan-Richards |publisher=NewsWhistle |date=2017-11-28 |accessdate=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Holy Kinship''''' is a circa 1495 [[Oil painting|oil on panel]] painting of [[Holy Kinship]] by the workshop of the renaissance artist [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]] in the collection of the [[Rijksmuseum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/images/58546 painting record] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
''The Holy Kinship'' shows the Virgin and Child in the left center with Saint Elizabeth and [[John the Baptist]] slightly more prominently positioned center right.&lt;ref name=RM/&gt; The "kinship" members have been further identified as Saint Anne with a book on the left with her husband Joachim behind her and behind him [[Saint Joseph]] holding a lily towards his wife as a gesture of the immaculate conception. Three young cousins of the infants, the later disciples Simon, Jacob and John, pour wine into a chalice in the centre of the painting which is a reference to the [[Eucharist]], and beyond them a sculpture of [[Binding of Isaac|Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac]] on the altar represents God's sacrifice of [[Jesus]]. A young [[Judas]] stands lighting the candles of the choir gate.

This painting is a former altarpiece of an unspecified church, though it is tempting to imagine similarities to the ''Commanderie van Sint-Jan'' where Geertgen is known to have lived and worked: [[Janskerk, Haarlem]].&lt;ref name=Geertgen&gt;''Geertgen was hier: meesterschilder, lekenbroeder en inspirator''’, exhibition catalog Geertgen tot Sint-Jans in De Vishal and Janskerk (18 September – 13 October), Haarlem, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The provenance of this painting only goes back to a Brussels sale in 1797 however, and indeed the painting was purchased in 1808 as a work by Jan and [[Hubert van Eyck]]. It wasn't until 1888 that it was identified as a work by the Haarlem master.&lt;ref name=RM&gt;[https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl/collectie/SK-A-500/catalogus-entry Catalog entry] in museum website&lt;/ref&gt; Since then several attempts have been made to determine the origins of the painting. In his translated ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'', [[Hessel Miedema]] reported that Geertgen died somewhere between 1486 and 1492, while recent [[dendrochronology]], on the other hand, places the painting around 1496 at the earliest.&lt;ref name=Wallert&gt;[http://www.hnanews.org/archive/2001/11/wallert01.html The Holy Kinship.

This painting has been considered a highlight of the collection since it was bought in 1808 and has been included in all ''Highlights of the Rijksmuseum'' catalogs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3310">'''The Sparrow's Lost Bean''' ([[Nepal Bhasa]]: चखुंचायागु तंगु कयगू, Chakhunchāyāgu Tangu Kaygu) is a Nepalese folk tale that ranks among the most popular children's stories told among the [[Newar]]s of [[Nepal Mandala]].&lt;ref&gt;Kansakar, Prem Bahadur (1966). ''Nyakan Bakhan.'' Kathmandu: Himanchal Pustak Bhavan. Page 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The story==
Once upon a time, there was a sparrow who was very neat and clean. Its nest was spotless and it always washed up before eating. One morning, the sparrow found a bean and was overjoyed that it didn't have to search the neighborhood for food. As was its habit, it went down to the river to wash up after putting the bean away safely on the bridge.
 
When the sparrow returned expecting to eat a fine breakfast, alas, the bean was nowhere to be found. As it was looking everywhere for its food, it saw a carpenter walking up the bridge. The sparrow went up to the carpenter and said, "I have lost my bean. Please help me find it." "Who's going to listen to you?" said the carpenter and continued on his way. 

Just then the sparrow saw a soldier walking up the bridge. It pleaded with him to help find the bean, but the soldier too was uncooperative. "Who's going to help a sparrow?" he said and walked away. Then a captain came up the bridge, but he wouldn't help the sparrow either. And then a minister, but no help from him too. He just laughed and kept walking.

The hungry sparrow became desperate. Then the king came riding on an elephant. The sparrow was certain that it would get justice from the most powerful person in the country. But the king pretended not to hear the sparrow's pleas and said nothing. As the sparrow sat there dejected, an ant came up and asked, "What's the matter? Didn't you see the king pass by?" The sparrow then told the ant how everybody from the carpenter to the king had ignored its appeals to help it find the lost bean.

"Don't worry," said the ant. "We will find the bean somehow." The ant then crawled up to the elephant's ear and said, "Tell the king to find the sparrow's bean or I will go inside your ear and bite you." The terrified elephant turned to the king and said, "You better help the sparrow, oh king, or I will throw you off my back." 

The king was startled. He immediately summoned the minister and ordered, "Help the sparrow or you are fired." The minister called the captain right away and said, "Do whatever the sparrow says or you are in trouble." The captain then called the soldier and gave him explicit orders. The soldier, in turn, found the carpenter and told him, "Find the sparrow's bean or I will hang you from this bridge itself." The carpenter searched for half a day and finally found the lost bean, and the sparrow had a satisfying breakfast that day.

{{Indigenous rights}}

The terms '''traditional knowledge''', '''indigenous knowledge''' and '''local knowledge''' generally refer to knowledge systems embedded in the cultural traditions of [[region]]al, [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]], or local [[community|communities]]. Traditional knowledge includes types of knowledge about traditional technologies of [[subsistence]] (e.g. tools and techniques for [[hunting]] or [[agriculture]]), [[midwifery]], [[ethnobotany]] and [[traditional ecological knowledge|ecological knowledge]], [[traditional medicine]], [[celestial navigation]], [[ethnoastronomy]], [http://www.eldis.org/go/topics/resource-guides/climate-change/key-issues/indigenous-knowledge-and-climate-change#.UwTEefl_uvM the climate], and others. These kinds of knowledge, crucial for subsistence and survival, are generally based on accumulations of [[empirical]] observation and on interaction with the environment.

In many cases, traditional knowledge has been [[oral tradition|orally passed]] for generations from person to person. Some forms of traditional knowledge find expression in [[storytelling|stories]], [[legend]]s, [[folklore]], [[ritual]]s, [[song]]s, and [[law]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kala, C.P. (2012) Traditional ecological knowledge and conservation of ethnobotanical species in the buffer zone of Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve, Madhya Pradesh.

== Characteristics ==
A report of the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU) Study Group on Science and Traditional Knowledge characterises traditional knowledge as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"a cumulative body of knowledge, know-how, practices and representations maintained and developed by peoples with extended histories of interaction with the natural environment. These sophisticated sets of understandings, interpretations and meanings are part and parcel of a cultural complex that encompasses language, naming and classification systems, resource use practices, ritual, spirituality and worldview."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Traditional knowledge typically distinguishes one community from another. In some communities, traditional knowledge takes on personal and [[spirituality|spiritual]] meanings. Traditional knowledge can also reflect a community's interests. Some communities depend on their traditional knowledge for survival. This is particularly true of traditional environmental knowledge, which refers to a "particular form of place-based knowledge of the diversity and interactions among plant and animal species, landforms, watercourses, and other qualities of the biophysical environment in a given place".&lt;ref&gt;Peña, Devon G.,''Mexican Americans and the Environment'', The University of Arizona Press, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;198.&lt;/ref&gt; An exemplar of a society with a wealth of [[traditional ecological knowledge]] (TEK), the South American [[Kayapo people]], have developed an extensive classification system of ecological zones of the Amazonian tropical savannah (i.e., campo / [[cerrado]]) to better manage the land.&lt;ref&gt;Posey, Darrel Addison. "Indigenous Management of Tropical Forest Ecosystems: The case of the Kayapo Indians of the Brazilian Amazon" in Dove and Carpenter, ''Environmental Anthropology: a historical reader'', Blackwell Publishing, Oxford, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some social scientists conceptualise knowledge within a naturalistic framework and emphasize the gradation of recent knowledge into knowledge acquired over many generations. These accounts use terms like "adaptively acquired knowledge", "socially constructed knowledge," and other terms that emphasize the social aspects of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Wasongo, V.O., Kambewa, D., and Bekalo, I. (2011).  Community-Based Natural Resource Management (p. 194).  In W.O. Ochola, P.C. Sanginga, I. Bekalo (Eds.), Managing Natural Resources for Development in Africa. A Resource Book.  
Nairobi, Kenya: Univ. of Nairobi Press, 2011 (Chapter 4: pp. 165-210).
&lt;/ref&gt; Local knowledge and traditional knowledge may be thought of as distinguished by the length of time they have existed - decades to centuries versus millennia. A large number of scholarly studies in the naturalistic tradition {{Clarify|date=August 2012}} demonstrate that traditional knowledge is not a natural category, and may reflect [[Power (sociology)|power]] struggles and relationships for land, resources and [[social control]] rather than adherence to a claimed [[ancestry]] or [[Tradition|heritage]].{{Citation needed|date= August 2012}}

On the other hand, indigenous and local communities themselves may perceive traditional knowledge very differently. The knowledge of indigenous and local communities is often embedded in a [[cosmology]], and any distinction between "intangible" knowledge and physical things can become blurred. Indigenous peoples often say that "our knowledge is holistic, and cannot be separated from our lands and resources". Traditional knowledge in such [[cosmologies]] is inextricably bound to [[ancestors]], and ancestral lands.{{cn|date=October 2016}} Knowledge may not be acquired by naturalistic trial and error, but through direct [[revelation]] through conversations with "the creator", [[spirits]], or ancestors. Chamberlin (2003) writes of a [[Gitksan]] elder from [[British Columbia]] confronted by a government land-claim: "If this is your land," he asked, "where are your stories?"&lt;ref&gt; Chamberlin, J.E. (2003).  If This Is Your Land, Where Are Your Stories? Finding Common Ground. Toronto: Alfred A. Knopf Canada. &lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous and local communities often do not have strong traditions of ownership over knowledge that resemble the modern forms of [[private ownership]]. Many have clear traditions of custodianship over knowledge, and customary law may guide who may use different kinds of knowledge at particular times and places, and specify obligations that accompany the use of knowledge. From an indigenous perspective, misappropriation and misuse of knowledge may be offensive to traditions, and may have spiritual and physical repercussions in indigenous cosmological systems. Consequently, indigenous and local communities argue that others' use of their traditional knowledge warrants respect and sensitivity. Critics of "traditional knowledge", however, see such demands for "respect" as an attempt to prevent unsubstantiated beliefs from being subjected to the same scrutiny as other knowledge-claims.{{cn|date=October 2016}} This has particular significance for [[environmental management]] because the spiritual component of "traditional knowledge" can justify any activity, including the [[unsustainable]] harvesting of resources.

[[File:Konchog-wangdu.jpeg|200px|right|thumb|Buddhist monk Geshe Konchog Wangdu reads [[Mahayana sutra]]s from an old woodblock copy of the Tibetan Kanjur.]]
Recently, international attention has turned to [[intellectual property|intellectual property laws]] to preserve, protect, and promote traditional knowledge. The reasons for this are complex. In 1992, the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) recognized the value of traditional knowledge in protecting species, ecosystems and landscapes, and incorporated language regulating access to it and its use (discussed below). It was soon urged that implementing these provisions would require revision of international intellectual property agreements.

This became even more pressing with the adoption of the [[World Trade Organization]] [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPs), which established rules for creating and protecting intellectual property that could be interpreted to conflict with the agreements made under the CBD. In response, the states who had ratified the CBD requested the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) to investigate the relationship between intellectual property rights, biodiversity and traditional knowledge. WIPO began this work with a fact-finding mission in 1999. Considering the issues involved with biodiversity and the broader issues in TRIPs (involving all forms of cultural expressions, not just those associated with biodiversity &amp;ndash; including traditional designs, music, songs, stories, etc.), WIPO established the Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore (IGC-GRTKF).

The period of the early 1990s to the Millennium was also characterized by the rapid rise in global [[civil society]]. The high-level Brundtland Report (1987) recommended a change in development policy that allowed for direct community participation and respected local rights and aspirations. Indigenous peoples and others had successfully petitioned the United Nations to establish a [[Working Group on Indigenous Populations]] that made two early surveys on treaty rights and land rights. These led to a greater public and governmental recognition of indigenous land and resource rights, and the need to address the issue of collective human rights, as distinct from the individual rights of existing human rights law.

The collective human rights of indigenous and local communities has been increasingly recognized &amp;ndash; such as in the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) [[Convention 169]] (1989) and the [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] (2007). The [[Rio Declaration]] (1992), endorsed by the presidents and ministers of the majority of the countries of the world, recognized indigenous and local communities as distinct groups with special concerns that should be addressed by states.

Initial concern was over the territorial rights and traditional resource rights of these communities. Indigenous peoples soon showed concern for the misappropriation and misuse of their "intangible" knowledge and cultural heritage. Indigenous peoples and local communities have resisted, among other things: the use of traditional symbols and designs as mascots, derivative arts and crafts; the use or modification of traditional songs; the patenting of traditional uses of medicinal plants; and the copyrighting and distribution of traditional stories.

Indigenous peoples and local communities have sought to prevent the patenting of traditional knowledge and resources where they have not given express consent. They have sought for greater protection and control over traditional knowledge and resources. Certain communities have also sought to ensure that their traditional knowledge is used equitably - according to restrictions set by their traditions, or requiring benefit sharing for its use according to benefits which they define.

Three broad approaches to protect traditional knowledge have been developed. The first emphasizes protecting traditional knowledge as a form of cultural heritage. The second looks at protection of traditional knowledge as a collective human right. The third, taken by the WTO and WIPO, investigates the use of existing or novel ''[[sui generis]]'' measures to protect traditional knowledge.

Currently, only a few [[nation]]s offer explicit ''[[sui generis]]'' protection for traditional knowledge. However, a number of [[country|countries]] are still undecided as to whether law should give traditional knowledge deference. Indigenous peoples have shown ambivalence about the [[indigenous intellectual property|intellectual property]] approach. Some have been willing to investigate how existing intellectual property mechanisms (primarily: patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets) can protect traditional knowledge. Others believe that an intellectual property approach may work, but will require more radical and novel forms of intellectual property law ("sui generis rights"). Others believe that the intellectual property system uses concepts and terms that are incompatible with traditional cultural concepts, and favors the commercialization of their traditions, which they generally resist. Many have argued that the form of protection should refer to collective human rights to protect their distinct identities, religions and cultural heritage.

===Public domain===
[[File:Hansel-and-gretel-rackham.jpg|thumb|200px|right| [[Hansel and Gretel]] is a [[fairy tale]] of Germanic origin, recorded by the [[Brothers Grimm]] in 1812. The tale has been adapted to various media, most notably the [[opera]] ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'' (1893) by [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]] and a stop-motion animated feature film based on the opera. Artwork by [[Arthur Rackham]], 1909]]

Literary and artistic works based upon, derived from or inspired by traditional culture or folklore may incorporate new elements or expressions. Hence these works may be "new" works with a living and identifiable creator, or creators. Such contemporary works may include a new interpretation, arrangement, adaptation or collection of pre-existing cultural heritage that is in the public domain. Traditional culture or folklore may also be "repackaged" in [[digital formats]], or [[Conservation-restoration|restoration]] and [[film colorization|colorization]]. Contemporary and tradition based expressions and works of traditional culture are generally protected under existing copyright law, a form of intellectual property law, as they are sufficiently original to be regarded as "new" upon publication. Once the intellectual property rights afforded to these new works of traditional knowledge expire, they fall into the public domain.&lt;ref name="Graber 2008 174"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Graber| first = Christoph Beat|author2=Nenova, Mira Burri  | title = Intellectual Property and Traditional Cultural Expressions in a digital environment| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2008| page =174| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=gK6OI0hrANsC&amp;dq=%22public+domain%22+intellectual+property&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 1-84720-921-1}}; Paolo Davide Farah, Riccardo Tremolada, "Diritti di proprietà intellettuale, diritti umani e patrimonio culturale immateriale", (Intellectual Property Rights, Human Rights and Intangible Cultural Heritage), RIVISTA DI DIRITTO INDUSTRIALE (Journal of Intellectual Property Law), Issue 2, Part I,  June 2014, {{ISSN|0035-614X}}, Giuffre, pp. 21-47. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2472388&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[public domain]], as defined in the context of [[intellectual property]] rights, is not a concept recognised by some indigenous peoples. As much of traditional knowledge has never been protected under intellectual property rights, it is argued that they can not be said to have entered any public domain. On this point the [[Tulalip Tribes]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] state has commented that "...open sharing does not automatically confer a right to use the knowledge (of indigenous people)... traditional cultural expressions are not in the public domain because indigenous peoples have failed to take the steps necessary to protect the knowledge in the Western intellectual property system, but from a failure of governments and citizens to recognise and respect the customary laws regulating their use".&lt;ref name="Graber 2008 174"/&gt; Equally however, the idea of restricting the use of publicly available information without clear notice and justification is regarded by many in developed nations as unethical as well as impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iccwbo.org/uploadedFiles/ICC/policy/intellectual_property/Statements/Protecting_Traditional_Knowledge.pdf |title=Policy commissions |publisher=International Chamber of Commerce |accessdate=2013-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511124417/http://iccwbo.org/uploadedFiles/ICC/policy/intellectual_property/Statements/Protecting_Traditional_Knowledge.pdf |archivedate=11 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indigenous intellectual property ===
{{Main article|Indigenous intellectual property}}
Indigenous intellectual property is an umbrella legal term used in national and international forums to identify [[indigenous peoples]]' special rights to claim (from within their own laws) all that their indigenous groups know now, have known, or will know.&lt;ref&gt;Rainforest Aboriginal Network (1993) ''Julayinbul: Aboriginal Intellectual and Cultural Property Definitions, Ownership and Strategies for Protection.'' Rainforest Aboriginal Network. Cairns. Page 65&lt;/ref&gt; It is a concept that has developed out of a predominantly [[Western culture|western]] legal tradition, and has most recently been promoted by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], as part of a more general [[United Nations]] push &lt;ref name="OHCRC001"&gt;{{cite web | last = Office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights | first =  | year = 2007 | url = http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/indigenous/ | title = Indigenous peoples | work =  | publisher = Office of the United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights.

In the lead up to and during the United Nations International Year for the World's Indigenous Peoples (1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Watson, Irene |title=1993: International Year for Indigenous Peoples |publisher=AustLII |year=1992 |work=Aboriginal Law Bulletin |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AboriginalLB/1992/52.html |accessdate=2007-11-29 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; then during the following United Nations Decade of the World's Indigenous Peoples (1995–2004)&lt;ref name="OHCRC001"/&gt; a number of conferences of both indigenous and non-indigenous specialists were held in different parts of the world, resulting in a number of declarations and statements identifying, explaining, refining, and defining 'indigenous intellectual property'.&lt;ref name="WIPO002"&gt;World Intellectual Property Organization (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indigenouspeoplesissues.com/index.php?option=com_search&amp;areas=content&amp;searchphrase=all&amp;searchword=TEK |title=Indigenous People and Traditional Knowledge: Resources |publisher=Indigenouspeoplesissues.com |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) ===
Article 27. 3(b) of the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPs) sets out certain conditions under which certain biological materials or intellectual innovations may be excluded from patenting. The Article also contains a requirement that Article 27 be reviewed. In the TRIPs-related Doha Declaration of 2001, Paragraph 19 expanded the review to a review of Article 27 and the rest of the TRIPs agreement to include the relationship between the TRIPS Agreement and the 1992 [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) and the protection of traditional knowledge and folklore.

=== The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) ===
The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD), signed at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in 1992, was the first international environmental convention to develop measures for the use and protection of traditional knowledge, related to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. By 2006, 188 had ratified the Convention and agreed to be bound by its provisions, the largest number of nations to accede to any existing treaty (the United States is one of the few countries that has signed, but not ratified, the CBD). Significant provisions include:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Article 8.  In-situ Conservation''

Each Contracting Party shall, as far as possible and as appropriate:

(a)...

(j) Subject to its national legislation, respect, preserve and maintain knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge, innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge, innovations and practices...

''Article 10.  Sustainable Use of Components of Biological Diversity''

Each Contracting Party shall, as far as possible and as appropriate:

(a)...

(c) Protect and encourage customary use of biological resources in accordance with traditional cultural practices that are compatible with conservation or sustainable use requirements
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The interpretation of these provisions has been elaborated through decisions by the parties (ratifiers of the Convention) (see the Convention on Biological Diversity Handbook, available free in digital format from the Secretariat). Nevertheless, the provisions regarding Access and Benefit Sharing contained in the Convention on Biological Diversity never achieved consensus and soon the authority over these questions fell back to WIPO.&lt;ref&gt;Louafi, Sélim and Jean-Frédéric Morin, International governance of biodiversity: Involving all the users of genetic resources, IDDRI, 2004, https://www.academia.edu/3809935/Louafi_S._and_J-F_Morin&lt;/ref&gt;  

At the Convention on Biological Diversity meeting, in Buenos Aires, in 1996, emphasis was put on local knowledge. Key players, such as local communities and indigenous peoples, should be recognized by States, and have their sovereignty recognised over the biodiversity of their territories, so that they can continue protecting it.&lt;ref&gt;Roussel, Bernard.

The parties to the Convention set a 2010 target to negotiate an international legally binding regime on access and benefit sharing (ABS) at the Eighth meeting (COP8), 20–31 March 2006 in Curitiba, Brazil. This target was met in October 2010 in Nagoya, Japan, by conclusion of the [[Nagoya Protocol]] to the CBD. The agreement is now open for ratification, and will come into force when 50 signatories have ratified it. It entered into force on 12 October 2014. {{As of|2017|10}}, 100 nations and the EU ratified the Nagoya Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cbd.int/abs/nagoya-protocol/signatories/default.shtml | title=Parties to the Nagoya Protocol | publisher=Convention on Biological Diversity | accessdate=19 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Protocol treats of inter-governmental obligations related to genetic resources, and includes measures related to the rights of indigenous and local communities to control access to and derive benefits from the use of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge.

===Government of India efforts===
In 2001, the [[Government of India]] set up the [[Traditional Knowledge Digital Library]] (TKDL) as repository of 1200 formulations of various systems of Indian medicine, such as [[Ayurveda]], [[Unani]] and [[Siddha medicine|Siddha]] and 1500 [[Yoga]] postures ([[asana]]s), translated into five languages — English, German, French, Spanish and Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tkdl.res.in/tkdl/langdefault/common/ Traditional Knowledge Digital Library] website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=61511|title=Know Instances of Patenting on the UES of Medicinal Plants in India|date=May 6, 2010|publisher=PIB, Ministry of Environment and Forests|accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; India has also signed agreements with the [[European Patent Office]] (EPO), [[United Kingdom Patent Office|United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office]] (UKIPO) and the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) to prevent the grant of invalid patents by giving [[patent examiner]]s at International [[patent office|Patent Offices]] access to the TKDL database for patent search and examination.&lt;ref name="pt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/2010/04/28214947/CSIR-wing-objects-to-Avesthage.html|title=CSIR wing objects to Avesthagen patent claim|date=April 28, 2010|work=Live Mint}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=61122|title=India Partners with US and UK to Protect Its Traditional Knowledge and Prevent Bio-Piracy|date=April 28, 2010|publisher=Press Information Bureau, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare|accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IPR Policy of Kerala Govt.(India)''' - Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) Policy for [[Kerala]] released in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/06/28/stories/2008062856600100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=IPRs policy proposes ‘knowledge commons' | date=28 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes adoption of the concepts ‘[[knowledge commons]]’ and ‘commons licence’ for the protection of traditional knowledge. The chief architects of the Policy are Prof. [[Prabhat Patnaik]] and Mr. [[R S Praveen Raj|R.S. Praveen Raj]]. The policy seeks to put all traditional knowledge into the realm of "[[knowledge commons]]", distinguishing this from the [[public domain]]. While codification of TK in [[TKDL|digital libraries]] and sharing the same with patent offices prevents direct misappropriation, it is feared that it may provide an opportunity for private appropriation by making cosmetic improvements to such traditional knowledge that is not readily accessible otherwise. TKDL cannot at the same time be kept confidential and treated as prior art - says R.S. Praveen Raj.&lt;ref name="Intellectual Property Watch 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=No Need Of IPRs For Protecting Traditional Knowledge | website=Intellectual Property Watch | date=3 September 2015 | url=http://www.ip-watch.org/2015/09/03/no-need-of-ipr-route-for-protecting-traditional-knowledge/ | access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to R S Praveen Raj any attempt to codify community-held TK in the form of Traditional Knowledge Digital Libraries (TKDL) using "Prior Informed Consent" and "Access and Benefit Sharing" concepts would be a gross injustice to those communities if the knowledge was shared with patent offices or even with researchers, as it would affect the livelihoods of Traditional Knowledge practitioners. He also cautions against classifying Traditional Knowledge under Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and creation of statutory registrable rights on TK,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/caution-on-classifying-traditional-knowledge-under-ipr/article7589338.ece | work=The Hindu | title='Caution on classifying-Traditional Knowledge under IPR' | date=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he proposes the creation of a Traditional Knowledge Docketing System (TKDS) to indicate the location at which the knowledge is available, the community that possesses the traditional knowledge, a short description of the nature of TK and community protocol, if any. He argues that the indigenous communities should be educated and empowered to protect their TK through existing legal mechanisms or take patents on the innovations made by them on the TK (if they feel so) and to negotiate with the potential customers by forming societies or trusts of their own. There is no bar for patenting inventions, though it may be based on TK. Section 3(p) of Indian Patents Act, 1970 only prevents patenting of "traditional knowledge or which is an aggregation or duplication of known properties of traditionally known component or components" and not patenting of any inventions based on TK.

In the year 2016, Dr. Shashi Tharoor, Member of Parliament from Thiruvananthapuram introduced a Private Bill ([http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/Asintroduced/3013.pdf The Protection of Traditional Knowledge Bill, 2016]). The Bill was introduced for the ''protection, preservation and promotion'' of traditional knowledge system in India. The Bill is yet to be discussed in the Parliament. Neither, the Bill was discussed much in the media. According to Mr. [[Vishnu S Warrier]], Dr. Shashi Tharoor has [http://www.intellectualpropertyprimer.com/protection-traditional-knowledge-bill-failure.html failed to address the real concern] of traditional knowledge through his Private Bill.

==Traditional cultural expressions==

The phrase "traditional cultural expressions" is used by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] to refer to "any form of artistic and literary expression in which traditional culture and knowledge are embodied. They are transmitted from one generation to the next, and include handmade textiles, paintings, stories, legends, ceremonies, music, songs, rhythms and dance."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|title=ENGAGING - A Guide to Interacting Respectfully and Reciprocally with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, and their Arts Practices and Intellectual Property|author=[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] et al|publisher=Australian Government: Indigenous Culture Support|year=2015|p=7|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330114112/http://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trial by ordeal''' was an ancient judicial practice by which the guilt or innocence of the accused was determined by subjecting them to a painful, or at least an unpleasant, usually dangerous experience. The test was one of life or death, and the proof of innocence was survival. In some cases, the accused was considered innocent if they escaped injury or if their injuries healed.

In [[medieval Europe]], like [[trial by combat]], trial by ordeal was considered a "judgement of God" ({{lang-la|judicium Dei}}): a procedure based on the premise that [[God]] would help the innocent by performing a miracle on his behalf. The practice has much earlier roots, attested to as far back as the [[Code of Hammurabi]] and the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]].

In pre-modern society, the ordeal typically ranked along with the [[oath]] and [[witness]] accounts as the central means by which to reach a judicial verdict. Indeed, the term ''ordeal'', [[Old English]] ''ordǣl'', has the meaning of "judgment, verdict" (German ''Urteil'', Dutch ''oordeel''), from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*uzdailjam'' "that which is dealt out".

Priestly cooperation in trials by fire and water was forbidden by [[Pope Innocent III]] at the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] of 1215 and replaced by [[compurgation]]. Trials by ordeal became rarer over the [[Late Middle Ages]], but the practice was not discontinued until the 16th century. Certain trials by ordeal would continue to be used into the 17th century in [[witch-hunt]]s.&lt;ref name="CathEnc" /&gt;

==Types of ordeals==

===By combat===
{{main|Trial by combat}}
Ordeal by combat took place between two people in a dispute. They, or, under certain conditions, a designated "champion" acting on their behalf, would fight, and the loser of the fight or the party represented by the losing champion was deemed guilty or liable.

A notable case was that of [[Gero, Count of Alsleben]], whose daughter married [[Siegfried II, Count of Stade]].

===By fire===
[[File:Ordeal by red-hot iron.jpg|thumb|200px|After being accused of adultery [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] proved her innocence by walking over red-hot [[ploughshare]]s.]]
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2014}}Ordeal by fire was one form of torture. Ordeal of fire typically required that the accused walk a certain distance, usually {{convert|9|ft|abbr=off}} or a certain number of paces, usually three, over [[Incandescence|red-hot]] [[ploughshare]]s or holding a red-hot [[iron]]. Innocence was sometimes established by a complete lack of injury, but it was more common for the wound to be bandaged and re-examined three days later by a priest, who would pronounce that God had intervened to heal it, or that it was merely festering&amp;mdash;in which case the suspect would be [[exile]]d or put to death. One famous story about the ordeal of ploughshares concerns [[Edward the Confessor]]'s mother, [[Emma of Normandy]]. According to legend, she was accused of [[adultery]] with Bishop [[Ælfwine of Winchester]], but proved her innocence by walking barefoot unharmed over burning ploughshares.

[[File:Gustave dore crusades barthelemi undergoing the ordeal of fire.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Bartholomew]] undergoing the ordeal of fire, by [[Gustave Doré]].]]

During the [[First Crusade]], the mystic [[Peter Bartholomew]] allegedly went through the ordeal by fire in 1099 by his own choice to disprove a charge that his claimed discovery of the [[Holy Lance]] was fraudulent. He died as a result of his injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Runciman, ''A History of the Crusades: Volume 1, The First Crusade and the Foundation of the Kingdom of Jerusalem'' (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1980), p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

Trial by ordeal was adopted in the 13th century by the [[Empire of Nicaea]] and the [[Despotate of Epirus]]; Michael Angold speculates this legal innovation was most likely through "the numerous western mercenaries in Byzantine service both before and after 1204."&lt;ref&gt;Angold, ''A Byzantine Government in Exile: Government and Society Under the Laskarids of Nicaea (1204-1261)'', (Oxford: University Press, 1975), p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; It was used to prove the innocence of the accused in cases of treason and use of magic to affect the health of the emperor. The most famous case where this employed was when [[Michael VIII Palaiologos|Michael Palaiologos]] was accused of treason: he avoided enduring the red-iron by saying he would only hold it if the [[metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Phokas (Byzantine family)|Phokas]] of [[Alaşehir|Philadelphia]] could take the iron from the altar with his own hands and hand it to him.&lt;ref&gt;Denno J. Geanakoplos, ''Emperor Michael Palaeologus and the West'' (Harvard University Press, 1959), pp. 23f&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Byzantines viewed trial of ordeal with disgust and considered it a barbarian innovation at odds with [[Byzantine law]] and ecclesiastical canons. Angold notes, "Its abolition by Michael Palaiologos was universally acclaimed."&lt;ref&gt;Angold, ''Byzantine Government'', p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1498, Dominican friar [[Girolamo Savonarola]], the leader of a reform movement in Florence who claimed apocalyptic prophetic visions, attempted to prove the divine sanction of his mission by undergoing a trial by fire. The first of its kind for over 400 years, the trial was a fiasco for Savonarola, since a sudden rain doused the flames, canceling the event, and was taken by onlookers as a sign from God against him. The Holy Inquisition arrested him shortly thereafter, with Savonarola convicted of heresy and hanged at the Piazza della Signoria in Florence.

Ordeal by fire ([[Persian language|Persian]]:'''ور''' ) was also used for judiciary purposes in [[ancient Iran]]. Persons accused of cheating in contracts or lying might be asked to prove their innocence by ordeal of fire as an ultimate test. Two examples of such an ordeal include the accused having to pass through fire, or having molten metal poured on his chest. There were about 30 of these kinds of fiery tests in all. If the accused died, he was held to have been guilty; if survived, he was innocent, having been protected by [[Mithra]] and the other gods. The most simple form of such ordeals required the accused to take an oath, then drink a potion of [[sulphur]] ([[Avestan language]] ''saokant'', [[Middle Persian]] ''sōgand'', [[Modern Persian]] ''sowgand''). They thought fire has an association with truth, and hence with [[asha]].&lt;ref name="Boyce"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/atas-fire | title=Ātaš | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica | publisher=Encyclopædia Iranica Foundation | accessdate=24 September 2013 | last=Boyce | first=Mary | year=2001 | volume=3 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014545/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/atas-fire | archivedate=28 September 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ancient India, the trial by fire was known as ''agnipariksha'', in which [[Agni]], the Fire God, would be invoked by a priest using mantras. After the invocation, a [[pyre]] is built and lit, and the accused would be asked to sit on it. According to Hindu Mythology, the Fire God would preserve the accused if he was innocent, if not, he would be burned to ashes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===By water===
====Hot water====
First mentioned in the 6th-century ''[[Lex Salica]]'', the ordeal of hot water required the accused to dip his hand in a kettle or pot of boiling water (sometimes oil or lead was used instead) and retrieve a stone. The assessment of the injury and the consequences of a miracle or lack of one, followed a similar procedure to that described above. An early (non-judicial) example of the test was described by [[Gregory of Tours]] in the late 6th century. He describes how a Catholic saint, Hyacinth, bested an [[Arianism|Arian]] rival by plucking a stone from a boiling [[cauldron]]. Gregory said that it took Hyacinth about an hour to complete the task (because the waters were bubbling so ferociously), but he was pleased to record that when the [[heresy|heretic]] tried, he had the skin boiled off up to his elbow.

Legal texts from reign of [[King Athelstan]] provide some of the most elaborate royal regulations for the use of the ordeal in Anglo-Saxon England, though the period's fullest account of ordeal practices is found in an anonymous legal text written some time in the tenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Wormald, ''The Making of English Law: King Alfred to the Twelfth Century, Vol I: Legislation and its Limits'' (Oxford, 1999), pp.373-4&lt;/ref&gt; According to this text, usually given the title ''Ordal'', the water had to be close to boiling temperature, and the depth from which the stone had to be retrieved was up to the wrist for a 'one-fold' ordeal and up to the elbow for a 'three-fold' ordeal.&lt;ref&gt;F. Liebermann, ''Die Gesetze der Angelsachsen vol. I: Text und Übersetzung'' (Halle, 1903), p.386&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between the one-fold and three-fold ordeal appears to be based on the severity of the crime, with the three-fold ordeal being prescribed for more severe offences such as treachery or for notorious criminals.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Wormald, ''Papers Preparatory to the Making of English Law, vol. II: From God's Law to Common Law'', ed. Stephen Baxter and John Hudson (2014), pp.78-9 at {{cite web |url=http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/reference/wormald/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141001090436/http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/reference/wormald/ |archivedate=2014-10-01 |df= }}. See for example, II As 4, 5, 6.1, I Atr 1.1, III Atr 3.4, V Atr 30, VI Atr 37, II Cn 30 all in Liebermann, ''Gesetze vol 1''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ordeal would take place in the church, with several in attendance, purified and praying God to reveal the truth. Afterwards, the hand was bound and examined after three days to see whether it was healing or [[festering]].&lt;ref name="KingAthelstan"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/560-975dooms.asp#The%20Laws%20of%20King%20Athelstan | title=The Laws of King Athelstan 924-939 A.D. | publisher=Fordham University | work=Internet Medieval Sourcebook | date=21 June 1998 | accessdate=3 October 2014 | editor-first1=Paul | editor-last1=Halsall | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006150341/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/560-975dooms.asp#The%20Laws%20of%20King%20Athelstan | archivedate=6 October 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was still a practice of 12th-century Catholic churches. A suspect would place his hand in the boiling water. If after three days God had not healed his wounds, the suspect was guilty of the crime.&lt;ref name="WaterOrdeal"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/water-ordeal.html | title=Ordeal of Boiling Water, 12th or 13th Century | publisher=Fordham University | work=Internet Medieval Sourcebook | date=January 1996 | accessdate=3 October 2014 | editor-first1=Paul | editor-last1=Halsall | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108084524/http://www.fordham.edu/Halsall/source/water-ordeal.html | archivedate=8 November 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ordeal of water.jpg|thumb|Water-ordeal. Engraving, 17th century.]]
Trial by ordeal mostly took place in a church because it was believed that God could watch over and decide if they were innocent.

====Cold water====
The ordeal of cold water has a precedent in the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]] and the [[Code of Hammurabi]], under which a man accused of [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] was to be submerged in a stream and acquitted if he survived. The practice was also set out in Frankish law but was abolished by [[Louis the Pious]] in 829. The practice reappeared in the [[Late Middle Ages]]: in the ''[[Dreieicher Wildbann]]'' of 1338, a man accused of [[poaching]] was to be submerged in a [[barrel]] three times and to be considered innocent if he sank, and guilty if he floated.

====Witch-hunts====
Ordeal by water was later associated with the [[witch-hunt]]s of the 16th and 17th centuries, although in this scenario the outcome was an accused who sank was considered innocent, while floating indicated [[witchcraft]]. [[Demonologists]] developed inventive new theories about how it worked. The ordeal would normally be conducted with a rope holding the subject connected to assistants sitting in a boat or the like, so that the person being tested could be pulled in if he/she did not float; the notion that the ordeal was flatly devised as a situation without any possibility of live acquittal, even if the outcome was 'innocent', is a modern exaggeration{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}. Some argued that witches floated because they had renounced [[baptism]] when entering the [[Devil]]'s service. Jacob Rickius claimed that they were supernaturally light and recommended weighing them as an alternative to dunking them; this procedure and its status as an alternative to dunking were parodied in the 1975 British film ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''.&lt;ref name="źaJermaine1866"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/superstitionand05leagoog | title=Superstition and Force | publisher=Collins, Printer | author=Lea, Henry C. | authorlink=Henry Charles Lea | year=1866 | location=Philadelphia | oclc=18128359}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James I of England|King James VI of Scotland]] (later also James I of England) claimed in his ''[[Daemonologie]]'' that water was so pure an element that it repelled the guilty. A witch trial including this ordeal took place in [[Szeged]], [[Hungary]] as late as 1728.&lt;!--Original reference text: Böhmer, ''ius eccles.'' -- If someone can find the actual page, then please add it--&gt;&lt;ref name="Boehmer"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3BMAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Jus ecclesiasticum protestantium | publisher=Impensis Orphanotrophei | last=Böhmer | first=Justus Henning | authorlink=Justus Henning Böhmer | language=Latin | ol=17577078M | year=1744 | location=Halle-Magdeburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ordeal of water is also contemplated by the [[Vishnu Smrti]],&lt;ref name="Jolly1880" /&gt; which is one of the texts of the [[Dharmaśāstra]].&lt;ref name="Jolly1880"&gt;{{cite book | chapter=XII | chapterurl=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe07/sbe07014.htm | editor1-first=F.

===By cross===
The ordeal of the cross was apparently introduced in the [[Early Middle Ages]] in an attempt to discourage [[judicial duels]] among [[Germanic peoples]]. As with judicial duels, and unlike most other ordeals, the accuser had to undergo the ordeal together with the accused. They stood on either side of a cross and stretched out their hands horizontally. The one to first lower his arms lost. This ordeal was prescribed by [[Charlemagne]] in 779 and again in 806. A capitulary of [[Louis the Pious]] in 819&lt;ref name="MGH"&gt;{{cite book | chapter=VII. Hludowici Pii Capitularia 814-837 | editor1-first=Alfredus | editor1-last=Boretius | editor1-link=:de:Alfred Boretius | title=[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]: Capitularia regum Francorum I | publisher=Societas Aperiendis Fontibus Rerum Germa | year=1883 | location=Hannover | page=279 | language=Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a decree of [[Lothar I]], recorded in 876, abolished the ordeal so as to avoid the mockery of Christ.

===By ingestion===
{{Main|Corsned}}
[[Franconia]]n law prescribed that an accused was to be given dry bread and cheese blessed by a priest. If he choked on the food, he was considered guilty. This was transformed into the ordeal of the [[Eucharist]] (trial by sacrament) mentioned by [[Regino of Prüm]] ca. 900:AD; the accused was to take the oath of innocence. It was believed that if the oath had been false, the person would die within the same year.

Both versions are essentially the opposite of ordeals, as they rely on the guilty parties' self-incrimination, while providing what amounts to a presumption of innocence. They are designed to be harmless and merciful. For how it was used in [[Anglo-Saxon]] England, see [[Corsned]].

[[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 5:12&amp;ndash;27 prescribes that a woman suspected of adultery—one called a ''[[Sotah]]'' in later commentaries—should be made to swallow "[[Ordeal of the bitter water|the bitter water that causeth the curse]]" by the priest in order to determine her guilt. The accused would be condemned only if 'her belly shall swell and her thigh shall rot'. One writer has recently argued that the procedure has a rational basis, envisioning punishment only upon clear proof of [[pregnancy]] (a swelling belly) or [[sexually transmitted disease|venereal disease]] (a rotting thigh).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Trial: A History from Socrates to O.J.

===By poison===
[[File:Tangena trial by ordeal Madagascar.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=in an ominous and dark tropical forest, a person lays on the ground, surrounded by men with spears, as a crowd looks on|A 19th-century artist's depiction of the ''[[tangena]]'' ordeal in Madagascar]]
Some cultures, such as the [[Efik people|Efik Uburutu]] people of present-day [[Nigeria]], would administer the poisonous [[Calabar bean]] (''Physostigma venenosum''; known as ''esere'' in  [[Ibibio language|Efik]]) in an attempt to detect guilt. A defendant who vomited up the bean was innocent. A defendant who became ill or died was considered guilty.&lt;ref name=FloraDelaterre&gt;{{cite web|last1=Delaterre|first1=Flora|title=Calabar Bean|url=http://www.floradelaterre.com/?id=19|website=Flora Delaterre The Plant Detective|accessdate=10 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512223614/http://www.floradelaterre.com/?id=19|archivedate=12 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residents of [[Madagascar]] could accuse one another of various crimes, including theft, Christianity, and especially witchcraft, for which the ordeal of ''[[tangena]]'' was routinely obligatory. In the 1820s, ingestion of the poisonous nut caused about 1,000 deaths annually. This average rose to around 3,000 annual deaths between 1828 and 1861.&lt;ref name="Stats"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The state and pre-colonial demographic history: the case of nineteenth century Madagascar | date=October 1991 | last=Campbell | first=Gwyn | journal=Journal of African History | volume=23 | issue=3 | pages=415&amp;ndash;445 | jstor=182662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early modern Europe, the [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] was unofficially used as a form of poison ordeal: a suspected party was forced to take the [[Eucharist]] on the grounds that, if he was guilty, he would be eternally damned, and hence his willingness to take the test would give an indication of his guilt.&lt;ref name="Thomas1971"&gt;{{cite book | title=Religion and the Decline of Magic | publisher=Folio Society | authorlink=Keith Thomas (historian) | year=2012 | location=London | origyear=1st pub. 1971 | page=42 | oclc=805007047 | first1=Keith | last1=Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===By boiling oil===
Trial by boiling oil has been practiced in villages in certain parts of [[West Africa]], such as [[Togo]].&lt;ref name="Togo_oil"&gt;{{cite episode | url=http://www.tv.com/taboo/justice/episode/931067/summary.html | title=Justice | series=[[Taboo (2002 TV series)|Taboo]] | network=National Geographic | airdate=6 October 2003 | season=2 | number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main alternatives of this trial. In one version, the accused parties are ordered to retrieve an item from a container of boiling oil, with those who refuse the task being found guilty.&lt;ref name="India_oil"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/men-undergo-trial-by-boiling-oil-over-stolen-food-78929.html | title=Men undergo trial by boiling water over stolen food | work=The Irish Independent | date=19 September 2006 | location=Dublin | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015023315/http://www.independent.ie/national-news/men-undergo-trial-by-boiling-oil-over-stolen-food-78929.html | archivedate=15 October 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the other version of the trial, both the accused and the accuser have to retrieve an item from boiling oil, with the person or persons whose hand remains unscathed being declared innocent.&lt;ref name="Togo_oil"/&gt;

===By turf===
An [[Iceland]]ic ordeal tradition involves the accused walking under a piece of turf. If the turf falls on the accused's head, the accused person is pronounced guilty.&lt;ref name="Miller1988"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Ordeal in Iceland | journal=Scandinavian Studies | year=1988 | volume=60 | issue=2 | pages=189–218 | jstor=40918943 | first1=William Ian | last1=Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English common law==
The ordeals of fire and water in England likely have their origin in Frankish tradition, as the earliest mention of the ordeal of the cauldron is in the first [[recension]] of the [[Salic Law]] in 510.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=4–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trial by cauldron was an ancient Frankish custom used against both freedmen and slaves in cases of theft, false witness and contempt of court, where the accused was made to plunge his right hand into a boiling cauldron and pull out a ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=4, 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Frankish influence spread throughout Europe, ordeal by cauldron spread to neighboring societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest references of ordeal by cauldron in the British Isles occurs in Irish law in the seventh century, but it is unlikely that this tradition shares roots with the Frankish tradition that is likely the source of trial by fire and water among the Anglo-Saxons and later the Normans in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws of [[Ine of Wessex|Ine]], king of the West Saxons, produced around 690, contains the earliest reference to ordeal in Anglo-Saxon law; however, this is the last and only mention of ordeal in Anglo-Saxon England until the tenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Norman conquest of England|Conquest of 1066]], the Old English customs of proof were repeated anew and in more detailed fashion by the Normans, but the only notable innovation of the ordeal by the conquerors was the introduction of the trial by battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Hyams|editor1-last=Arnold|editor1-first=Morris S.|title=On the Laws and Customs of England. Essays in Honor of Samuel E. Thorne|date=1981|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were, however, minor conflicts between the customs of the Anglo-Saxons and the customs Normans that were typically resolved in ways that favored the Normans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Hyams|editor1-last=Arnold|editor1-first=Morris S.|title=On the Laws and Customs of England. Essays in Honor of Samuel E. Thorne|date=1981|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a famous story from [[Eadmer]]'s ''Historia novorum in Anglia'', [[William Rufus]] expresses skepticism about the ordeal after fifty men accused of forest offenses were exonerated by the ordeal of hot iron. In this story, Rufus states that he will take judgment from God's hands into his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Hyams|editor1-last=Arnold|editor1-first=Morris S.|title=On the Laws and Customs of England. Essays in Honor of Samuel E. Thorne|date=1981|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this skepticism was not universally shared by the intellectuals of the day, and [[Eadmer]] depicts Rufus as irreligious for rejecting the legitimacy of the ordeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the ordeal in medieval England was very sensitive to status and reputation in the community. The laws of [[Canute]] distinguish between "men of good repute" who were able to clear themselves by their own oath, "untrustworthy men" who required [[compurgation|compurgators]], and untrustworthy men who cannot find compurgators who must go to the ordeal. One of the laws of [[Ethelred the Unready]] declared that untrustworthy men were to be sent to the triple ordeal, that is, an ordeal of hot iron where the iron is three times heavier than that used in the simple ordeal, unless his lord and two other knights swear that he has not been accused of a crime recently, in which case he would be sent to an ordinary ordeal of hot iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other European societies, the English rarely employed the ordeal in non-criminal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mandatory use of the ordeal in certain criminal proceedings appears to date from the [[Assize of Clarendon]] in 1166.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kerr|first1=Margaret H.|last2=Forsyth|first2=Richard D.|last3=Plyley|first3=Michael J.|title=Cold Water and Hot Iron: Trial by Ordeal in England|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History|date=1992|volume=22|issue=4|page=1|doi=10.2307/205237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to then, compurgation was the most usual method of proof, and the ordeal was used in cases where there was some presumption of guilt against the accused or when the accused was bound to fail in compurgation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kerr|first1=Margaret H.|last2=Forsyth|first2=Richard D.|last3=Plyley|first3=Michael J.|title=Cold Water and Hot Iron: Trial by Ordeal in England|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History|date=1992|volume=22|issue=4|page=3|doi=10.2307/205237}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction was made between those accused ''fama publica'' (by public outcry) and those accused on the basis of specific facts. Those accused ''fama publica'' were able to exculpate themselves by means of compurgation, whereas those accused on the basis of specific facts and those who were thought to have bad character were made to undergo the ordeal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Groot|first1=Roger D.|title=The Jury of Presentment Before 1215|journal=The American Journal of Legal History|date=1982|volume=26|issue=1|page=23|doi=10.2307/844604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assize of Clarendon declared that all those said by a jury of presentment to be "accused or notoriously suspect" of robbery, thievery, or murder or of receiving anyone who had committed such a wrong were to be put to the ordeal of water.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These juries of presentment were the [[Hundred (county division)#Hundred courts|hundred juries]] and [[vill]]s, and these groups, in effect, made the intermediate decision of whether an accused person would face the more final judgment of the ordeal. These bodies rendered "verdicts" of either suspected or not suspected. In cases where the defendant was accused on the basis of one or more specific facts, the defendant was sent to the ordeal upon the verdict of the hundred jury alone. In cases where the defendant was accused ''fama publica'', the agreement of the hundred jurors and the vills as to the defendant's suspicion was required to send him to the ordeal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; However, the intermediate accusation of the juries could still be considered final in some sense as any person who was accused of murder by the juries was required to leave the realm even if he was exonerated by the ordeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1215, clergy were forbidden to participate in ordeals by the [[Fourth Lateran Council]]. The English plea rolls contain no cases of trial by ordeal after 1219, when [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] recognized its abolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suppression ==

[[Pope]]s were generally opposed to ordeals, although there are some apocryphal accounts describing their cooperation with the practice.&lt;ref name="CathEnc"&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Ordeals}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first there was no general decree against ordeals, and they were only declared unlawful in individual cases.&lt;ref name="CathEnc"/&gt; Eventually [[Pope Innocent III]] in [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] (1215) promulgated a canon forbidding blessing of participants before ordeals.&lt;ref name="CathEnc"/&gt; This decision was followed by further prohibitions by [[synod]]s in thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.&lt;ref name="CathEnc"/&gt; The Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] (1194-1250AD) was the first king who explicitly outlawed trials by ordeal as they were considered ''irrational'' ([[Constitutions of Melfi]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ma l'imperatore svevo fu conservatore o innovatore?|url=http://www.stupormundi.it/Houben1.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429053347/http://www.stupormundi.it/Houben1.htm|archivedate=2015-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stupormundi.it/it/ma-limperatore-svevo-fu-conservatore-o-innovatore|title=Ma l'imperatore svevo fu conservatore o innovatore? - Stupor Mundi|author=|date=|website=www.stupormundi.it|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326202422/http://www.stupormundi.it/it/ma-limperatore-svevo-fu-conservatore-o-innovatore|archivedate=26 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In England, things started to change with [[Henry III of England]] (1220).

From the twelfth century, the ordeals started to be generally disapproved and they were discontinued during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. However, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries some kinds of ordeals were once again used in [[witch-hunt]]s.&lt;ref name="CathEnc" /&gt;

==Theoretical approaches==

According to a theory put forward by economics professor [[Peter Leeson]], trial by ordeal may have been effective at sorting the guilty from the innocent.&lt;ref name="Leeson2012"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Peter T. | last1=Leeson | url=http://www.peterleeson.com/Ordeals.pdf | title=Ordeals | accessdate=3 October 2014 | journal=Journal of Law and Economics | date=August 2012 | volume=55 | issue=3 | pages=691–714 | jstor=10.1086/664010 | author-link1=Peter Leeson | doi=10.1086/664010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117110839/http://www.peterleeson.com/Ordeals.pdf | archivedate=17 November 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the assumption that defendants were believers in divine intervention for the innocent, then only the truly innocent would choose to endure a trial; guilty defendants would confess or settle cases instead. Therefore, the theory goes, church and judicial authorities could routinely rig ordeals so that the participants—presumably innocent—could pass them.&lt;ref name="Leeson2010"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/01/31/justice_medieval_style/ | title=Justice, medieval style | work=Boston Sunday Globe | date=31 January 2010 | accessdate=3 October 2014 | first1=Peter | last1=Leeson | location=Boston, Massachusetts | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006114539/http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/01/31/justice_medieval_style/ | archivedate=6 October 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To support this theory, Leeson points to the great latitude given to the priests in administering the ordeal and interpreting the results of the ordeal. He also points to the overall high exoneration rate of accused persons undergoing the ordeal, when intuitively one would expect a very high proportion of people carrying a red hot iron to be badly burned and thus fail the ordeal.&lt;ref name="Leeson2012"/&gt; 
[[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]] explains the persistence and eventual withering of the ordeal by stating that it helped promote consensus in a society where people lived in close quarters and there was little centralized power. In a world where "the sacred penetrated into the chinks of the profane and vice-versa" the ordeal was a "controlled miracle" that served as a point of consensus when one of the greatest dangers to the community was feud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Peter|title=Society and the Supernatural: A Medieval Change|journal=Daedalus|date=Spring 1975|volume=104|issue=2|pages=135–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this analysis, Brown argues that the increasing authoritativeness of the state lessened the need and desire for the ordeal as an instrument of consensus, which ultimately led to its disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Peter|title=Society and the Supernatural: A Medieval Change|journal=Daedalus|date=Spring 1975|volume=104|issue=2|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;
