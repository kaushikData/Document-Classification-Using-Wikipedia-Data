[[File:Mathis Gothart Grünewald 062.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Grünewald's painting "[[The Mocking of Christ (Grünewald)|The Mocking of Christ]]" depicts Christ being lashed and abused.]]
The '''aestheticization of violence''' in high culture [[art]] or [[mass media]] has been the subject of considerable controversy and debate for centuries. In Western art, graphic depictions of the [[Passion of Christ]] have long been portrayed, as have a wide range of depictions of warfare by later painters and graphic artists. Theater and, in modern times, cinema have often featured battles and violent crimes, while images and descriptions of violence have always been a part of literature. Margaret Bruder states that the aestheticization of violence in film is the depiction of violence in a "stylistically excessive", "significant and sustained way" in which audience members are able to connect references from the "play of images and [[semiotics|signs]]" to artworks, [[genre]] conventions, cultural [[symbol]]s, or concepts.&lt;ref name="bruder"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gradnet.de/papers/pomo2.archives/pomo98.papers/mtbruder98.htm |title= Aestheticizing Violence, or How To Do Things with Style |accessdate=2007-06-08 |last= Bruder |first= Margaret Ervin |year= 1998 |publisher= Film Studies, Indiana University, Bloomington IN |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040908094032/http://www.gradnet.de/papers/pomo2.archives/pomo98.papers/mtbruder98.htm |archivedate= 2004-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power of representation==

===In high culture===
[[High culture]] forms such as [[fine art]] and [[literature]] have aestheticized violence into a form of autonomous art. In 1991, [[University of Georgia]] literature professor [[Joel Black]] stated that "(if) any human act evokes the aesthetic experience of the sublime, certainly it is the act of murder". Black notes that "...if murder can be experienced aesthetically, the murderer can in turn be regarded as a kind of artist—a performance artist or anti-artist whose specialty is not creation but destruction" (1991: 14). This conception of an [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] element of murder has a long history; in the 19th century, [[Thomas de Quincey]] wrote that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Everything in this world has two handles. [[Murder]], for instance, may be laid hold of by its moral handle... and that, I confess, is its weak side; or it may also be treated aesthetically, as the Germans call it—that is, in relation to good taste."&lt;ref name="dequincey"&gt;{{cite book |last= de Quincey |first= Thomas |authorlink= Thomas de Quincey |title= On Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts |url= http://supervert.com/elibrary/thomas_de_quincey |format= Zipped PDF download |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |year= 1827 |isbn= 1-84749-133-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In popular culture===
In addition to high culture aestheticizations of violence, mass media forms such as [[newspaper]] and [[television]] news reporting have produced sensationalized reports on [[crime]] and warfare. [[Maria Tatar]]'s book ''Lustmord: Sexual Murder in [[Weimar Germany]]'' analyzes murders in pre-Hitler Germany and their artistic representations, investigating "the chilling motives behind representations that aestheticize violence, and that turn the mutilated female body into an object of fascination".&lt;ref name="pupress"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/quotes/q5641.html |title= Additional Reviews and/or Endorsements for Tatar, M.: Lustmord: Sexual Murder in Weimar Germany |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |date= 2007-04-30 |publisher= [[Princeton University Press]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060906023727/http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/quotes/q5641.html |archive-date= 2006-09-06 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baath Party Headquarters, Baghdad (3148598572).jpg|thumb|right|200px|The bombed-out remains of the Baath Party Headquarters in Baghdad.]]
Lilie Chouliaraki's article, "The aestheticization of suffering on television" (2006), analyzes "an example of war footage in order to trace the ways in which the tension between presenting airwar as an 'objective' piece of news and as an instance of intense human suffering is resolved in television's strategies of mediation". For example, Chouliaraki argues that the "bombardment of Baghdad in 2003 during the Iraq war was filmed in long-shot and presented in a quasiliterary [[narrative]] that capitalized on an aesthetics of horror, on sublime [[spectacle]] (Boltanski). She says that the "aestheticization of suffering on television is thus produced by a visual and linguistic complex that eliminates the human pain aspect of suffering, whilst retaining the phantasmagoric effects of a [[tableau vivant]]", producing an "aestheticization of suffering [that] manages simultaneously to preserve an aura of objectivity and impartiality, and to take a pro-war side in the war footage".&lt;ref name="chouliaraki"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Chouliaraki |first= Lilie |authorlink=  |coauthors=  |year= 2006 |title= The aestheticization of suffering on television |journal= Visual Communication |volume= 5 |issue= 3 |pages= 261–285 |doi= 10.1177/1470357206068455 |url= http://vcj.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/5/3/261.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070628021152/http://vcj.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/5/3/261.pdf |archivedate= 2007-06-28 |deadurl= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In films ====
A number of filmmakers from the 20th century have used aestheticized depictions of violence. According to James Fox, filmmaker [[Donald Cammell]] "...looked upon violence as an artist might look on paint. [He asked:] What are its components? What's its nature? Its glamour?"&lt;ref name="schneider"&gt;{{cite journal |quotes= |last= Schneider |first= Steven Jay |date= 2001-06-01 |title= Killing in Style: The Aestheticization of Violence in Donald Cammell's 'White of the Eye' |journal= Scope - An Online Journal of Film and Television Studies |issn= 1465-9166 |url= http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/film/journal/articles/killing-in-style.htm  |format= Archive |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040619114211/http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/film/journal/articles/killing-in-style.htm |archivedate = 2004-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Thomas Harris]] created a fictional character called [[Hannibal Lecter]], a [[cannibalism|cannibal]] and aesthete killer. In the films adapted from his work, ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991) and ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'' (2001), directors [[Jonathan Demme]] and [[Ridley Scott]], respectively intentionally generate excitement and anticipation when Lecter is about to kill (and eat) a victim. Lecter was portrayed by [[Anthony Hopkins]]. In [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986), the villain of the film, [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]], is an excessively violent man who obsesses over small [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]]es (such as blue velvet) when he is attacking and raping his victims; his obsessions help him achieve [[orgasm]].

In the film ''[[Man on Fire (2004 film)|Man on Fire]],'' which tells the story of a burnt-out former [[Black Ops]] agent who seeks to avenge the kidnappers of a young girl he was bodyguarding, a character says that the agent is an "artist" in killing. He says the man is about to "paint his masterpiece" as he seeks out and kills all of the members of the criminal organization who were connected with the child abduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Roger |last= Ebert |title= Man on Fire Movie Review |url= http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/man-on-fire-2004 |date= 2004-04-23 |accessdate=2016-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Xavier Morales' review of [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Kill Bill:&lt;!-- The official website shows a colon in the title. See here: http://www.miramax.com/movie/kill-bill-volume-1/ --&gt; Volume 1]]'', entitled "Beauty and violence", he calls the film "a groundbreaking aestheticization of violence".  Morales says that the film, which he calls "easily one of the most violent movies ever made", "a breathtaking landscape in which art and violence coalesce into one unforgettable aesthetic experience".&lt;ref name="morales"/&gt;

Morales argues that "...&amp;nbsp;Tarantino manages to do precisely what Alex de Large was trying to do in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]:'' he presents violence as a form of expressive art...[in which the]...violence is so physically graceful, visually dazzling and meticulously executed that our instinctual, emotional responses undermine any rational objections we may have. Tarantino is able to transform an object of moral outrage into one of aesthetic beauty...[, in which,]...like all art forms, the violence serves a communicative purpose apart from its aesthetic value". When the female sword-wielding protagonist "...skillfully slices and dices her way through...[the opposing fighters]...we get a sense that she is using them as a kind of canvas for her expression of revenge...[,]...like an artist who expresses herself through brush and paint,...[she]...expresses herself through sword and blood".&lt;ref name="morales"&gt;{{cite news|first=Xavier |last=Morales |title=Beauty and violence |url=http://media.www.hlrecord.org/media/storage/paper609/news/2003/10/16/Etc/Kill-Bill.Beauty.And.Violence-530854.shtml |work=The Record |publisher=Harvard Law School RECORD Corporation |date=2003-10-16 |accessdate=2007-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021234/http://media.www.hlrecord.org/media/storage/paper609/news/2003/10/16/Etc/Kill-Bill.Beauty.And.Violence-530854.shtml |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critics analyzing violent film images that seek to aesthetically please the viewer mainly fall into two categories. Critics who see depictions of violence in film as superficial and exploitative argue that it leads audience members to become desensitized to brutality, thus increasing their aggression. On the other hand, critics who view violence as a type of content, or as a theme, claim it is cathartic and provides "acceptable outlets for anti-social impulses".&lt;ref name="bruder"/&gt;

Adrian Martin argues that critics who hold violent cinema in high regard have developed a response to anti-violence advocates, "those who decry everything from ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' to ''[[Terminator 2]]'' as dehumanising, desensitising cultural influences". Martin claims that critics who value aestheticized violence defend shocking depictions onscreen on the grounds that "screen violence is not real violence, and should never be confused with it". He claims that their rebuttal also claims that "movie violence is fun, spectacle, make-believe; it's dramatic metaphor, or a necessary catharsis akin to that provided by [[Jacobean theatre]]; it's generic, pure sensation, pure fantasy. It has its own changing history, its codes, its precise aesthetic uses."&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Adrian |year=2000 |title=The Offended Critic: Film Reviewing and Social Commentary |journal=Senses of Cinema |volume= |issue=8 |pages= |issn=1443-4059 |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/8/offended.html |format=Archive |accessdate=2007-06-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519074902/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/8/offended.html |archivedate=2007-05-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Bruder]], a film studies professor at Indiana University and the author of ''Aestheticizing Violence, or How To Do Things with Style,'' proposes that there is a distinction between aestheticized violence and the use of gore and blood in mass market action or war films. She argues that "aestheticized violence is not merely the excessive use of violence in a film". Movies such as the popular action film ''[[Die Hard 2]]'' are very violent, but they do "not fall into the category of aestheticized violence because it is not stylistically excessive in a significant and sustained way".&lt;ref name="bruder" /&gt;

But Bruder classifies films as using "stylized [e.g. aestheticized] violence if they "revel in guns, gore and explosions, exploiting [[mise-en-scene]] not so much to provide narrative environment as to create the appearance of a 'movie' atmosphere against which specifically cinematic spectacle can unfold". In movies with aestheticized violence, she argues that the "standard realist modes of editing and cinematography are violated in order to spectacularize the action being played out on the screen"; directors use "quick and awkward editing", "canted framings", shock cuts, and slow motion, to emphasize the impacts of bullets or the "spurting of blood".&lt;ref name="bruder" /&gt;

For viewers of films with aestheticized violence, such as [[John Woo]]'s movies, she claims that "One of the many pleasures" from watching Woo's films, such as ''[[Hard Target]]'' is that it gets viewers to recognize how Woo plays with conventions "from other Woo films" and how it "connects up with films...which include imitations of or homages to Woo". Bruder argues that films with aestheticized violence such as "''Hard Target'', ''[[True Romance]]'' and ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'' are [filled] with... signs" and indicators, so that "the stylized violence they contain ultimately serves as...another interruption in the narrative drive" of the film.&lt;ref name="bruder" /&gt;

Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Dwight Garner reviews the controversy and [[moral panic]] surrounding the 1991 novel and 2000 film ''[[American Psycho]]'', which concerns [[Patrick Bateman]], "an Exeter and Harvard grad, a gourmand, a tanning enthusiast and a ruthless fashion critic" who is also a [[serial killer]]. Garner concludes that the film was a "coal-black satire" in which "dire comedy mixes with [[Grand Guignol]]. There's demented opera in some of its scenes." The book, meanwhile, has acquired "grudging respect" and is "seen as a transgressive bag of broken glass that can be talked about alongside plasma-soaked trips like Anthony Burgess's ''A Clockwork Orange''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Dwight |last= Garner |title= In Hindsight, an ‘American Psycho’ Looks a Lot Like Us |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/theater/in-hindsight-an-american-psycho-looks-a-lot-like-us.html |newspaper= The New York Times |date=2016-03-24 |accessdate=2016-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garner claims that the novel's author, [[Bret Easton Ellis]], "was racing ahead of the culture" and that his book "was ahead of its time": "The culture has shifted to make room for Bateman. We've developed a taste for barbaric libertines with twinkling eyes and some zing in their tortured souls. [[Tony Soprano]], [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] from "''[[Breaking Bad]]''", [[Hannibal Lecter]] (who predates "''American Psycho''")—here are the most significant pop culture characters of the past 30 years... Thanks to these characters, and to [[first-person shooter]] [[video games]], we’ve learned to identify with the bearer of violence and not just cower before him or her."

==History in art==

===Antiquity===
[[Plato]] proposed to ban poets from his [[The Republic (Plato)|ideal republic]] because he feared that their aesthetic ability to construct attractive [[narrative]]s about immoral behaviour would corrupt young minds. Plato's writings refer to poetry as a kind of [[rhetoric]], whose "...influence is pervasive and often harmful". Plato believed that poetry that was "unregulated by philosophy is a danger to soul and community". He warned that tragic poetry can produce "a disordered psychic regime or constitution" by inducing "a dream-like, uncritical state in which we lose ourselves in ...sorrow, grief, anger, [and] resentment". As such, Plato was in effect arguing that "What goes on in the theater, in your home, in your fantasy life, are connected" to what one does in real life.&lt;ref name="griswold"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Griswold |first= Charles |editor= Edward N.

[[Aristotle]], though, advocated a useful role for music, drama, and tragedy: a way for people to purge their negative emotions. Aristotle mentions [[catharsis]] at the end of his ''Politics'', where he notes that after people listen to music that elicits pity and fear, they "are liable to become possessed" by these negative emotions. However, afterwards, Aristotle points out that these people return to "a normal condition as if they had been medically treated and undergone a purge [catharsis]&amp;nbsp;... All experience a certain purge [catharsis] and pleasant relief. In the same manner cathartic melodies give innocent joy to men" (from ''Politics'' VIII:7; 1341b 35-1342a 8).&lt;ref name="dhi"&gt;{{cite book |editor= Philip P.

[[File:FallOfTheDamnedBosch.jpg|right|upright|thumb|''[[Fall of the Damned into Hell]]'']]
The artist [[Hieronymus Bosch]], from the 15th and 16th centuries, used images of demons, half-human animals and machines to evoke fear and confusion to portray the evil of man. The 16th-century artist [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] depicted "...the nightmarish imagery that reflect, if in an extreme fashion, popular dread of the [[Apocalypse]] and Hell".&lt;ref name="alsford"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.trytel.com/~tristan/towns/florilegium/lcdth_i.html |title= Death - Introductory essay |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |last= Alsford |first= Stephen |date= 2004-02-29 |work= Florilegium Urbanum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mathis Gothart-Neithart]], a German artist known as "Grünewald" (1480–1528) depicted "intense emotion, especially painful emotion". His painting of the Crucifixion "...does not spare the beholder.

In the mid-18th century, [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]], an Italian etcher, archaeologist and architect active from 1740, did imaginary etchings of prisons that depicted people "stretched on racks or trapped like rats in maze-like dungeons", an "aestheticization of violence and suffering".&lt;ref&gt;

In 1849, as revolutions raged in European streets and authorities were putting down protests and consolidating state powers, composer [[Richard Wagner]] wrote: "I have an enormous desire to practice a little artistic terrorism."&lt;ref name="dworkin"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/Editor/DworkinTrotsky.pdf |title= Trotsky's Hammer |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |last= Dworkin |first= Craig |date= 2006-01-17 |format= PDF |publisher= Department of English, University of Utah |location= Salt Lake City, UT |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070626072920/http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/Editor/DworkinTrotsky.pdf |archivedate= 2007-06-26 |deadurl= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laurent Tailhade]] is reputed to have stated, after [[Auguste Vaillant]] bombed the Chamber of Deputies in 1893: "{{lang|fr|Qu'importent les victimes, si le geste est beau?}} [What do the victims matter, so long as the gesture is beautiful]." In 1929 [[André Breton]]'s Second Manifesto on [[surrealist art]] stated that "{{lang|fr|L’acte surréaliste le plus simple consiste, revolvers aux poings, à descendre dans la rue et à tirer au hasard, tant qu’on peut, dans la foule}}" [The simplest Surrealist act consists of running down into the street, pistols in hand, and firing blindly, as fast as you can pull the trigger, into the crowd]."&lt;ref name="dworkin" /&gt;

==Theories and semiotic analysis==
{{Semiotics}}

===Baudrillard===
French [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] theorist [[Jean Baudrillard]] argues that whereas modern societies were "...organized around the production and consumption of [[commodification|commodities]]", "postmodern societies are organized around simulation and the play of images and [[semiotics|signs]]". As such, in "...the postmodern media and consumer society, everything becomes an image, a sign, a spectacle". For Baudrillard, the West's "commercialization of the whole world...will turn out rather to have been the aestheticization of the whole world—its cosmopolitan spectacularization, its transformation into images, its semiological organization". As a result, the "previously separate domains of the [[economy]], art, politics, and sexuality" become "collapsed into each other", and art penetrates "all spheres of existence." Thus, Baudrillard argues that "[o]ur society has given rise to a general aestheticization: all forms of culture—not excluding anti-cultural ones—are promoted and all models of representation and anti-representation are taken on board".&lt;ref name="kellner"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Kellner |first= Douglas |editor= Edward N. Zalta |encyclopedia= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title= Jean Baudrillard |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2005/entries/baudrillard/ |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |edition= Summer 2005 |date= 2005-08-22 |publisher= The Metaphysics Research Lab, Center for the Study of Language and Information, [[Stanford University]] |location= Stanford, CA |issn= 1095-5054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semiotic analysis===

====Still images====
When a person views an isolated painting, photograph or cartoon, they are viewing a static image. If a photographer takes a still photo of a police officer's struggle to arrest a young man, for example, the [[denotation (Semiotics)|denotative]] meaning might be "there was a man dressed as a police officer placing his hand on the shoulder of another man of a certain age whilst a photographer took a picture". On the other hand, the [[connotation (semiotics)|connotative]] meanings might range from, "law enforcement in action" to "a heroic fight to subdue a dangerous terrorist about to release [[sarin gas]]", to "police use excessive force to arrest non-violent protesters", to "fancy dress party ends badly".  The attribution of the specific [[subtext]] is left to the caption writer, the text accompanying the photo, and the audience.

Critic [[Susan Sontag]] argued that, through repeated exposure, certain well-known photographs have become "ethical reference points", such as the many images depicting the victims and liberation of the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] (1977).  From this perspective, the subtext of such images, though still connotatively open to interpretation, has been somewhat restrained by familiarity, predominant cultural beliefs regarding the [[Holocaust]], and perhaps by overusage.

=====News reporting=====
If there is a motion picture or video recording of the previously described scenario of a police officer arresting a man, the filmmakers, videographers, and editors may reframe this scene, by fragmenting the recording, depicting it from different vantage points, editing the material, and reassembling these components. A film editor can produce a non-[[realism (arts)|realistic]] sequence of intercut, edited images, which forces the audience to interpret those images according to a different set of [[semiotic]] rules. Even without editing or alteration, a film or video recordings' ''[[mise en scène]]'' and non-verbal signs become much more explicit and enable the audience to attribute meaning to the scenario.
 
The [[value (Semiotics)|value]] of this video as a [[Sign (semiotics)|signifier]] will be determined by its relation to the other signifiers in the system. Thus, if the video is included in a reputable television news program, it will acquire a greater claim to be indexical and its status is more likely to be considered reliable "evidence" of real world events. In semiotic terms, the words spoken by the television presenter will be symbolic, and the images will have both iconic and indexical qualities.

The "semiotic value" of the video will change if it is transposed into a polemical or satirical programme, presented by a commentator, or screened with on-screen captions (e.g., "Crime Wave in the Streets", or "Protesters Brutalized by Police"). These substitute contexts form [[modality (semiotics)|modality]] indicators that may help the viewer to assess the plausibility, credibility, or truthfulness of the content. The violence shown on-screen can be '''aestheticized''' by the values of the symbolical signs used by the news presenter, by captions placed on-screen, or by the relations with other signifiers in the same programme (e.g., if the arrest video is preceded by a report about "antisocial and criminal behaviour").

=====Fictional film or video=====
If a film or television director staged a similar fictional scene, the audience will be predisposed to consider it less "real". They know that the scenario is being filtered through the film maker's sensibilities and the outcome will reflect the director's motives. Hence, the lighting, makeup, costumes, acting methods, cutting, and [[soundtrack]] music selection are understood to be combined to inform the audience about the film maker's intentions.

The [[culture industry]]'s mass-produced texts and images about crime, violence, and war have been consolidated into [[genres]]. Film makers typically choose from a predictable range of narrative [[Convention (norm)|convention]]s and use [[stereotype]]d  characters, and [[cliché]]d symbols and metaphors. Over time, certain styles and conventions of filming and editing are standardised within a medium or a genre. Some conventions tend to naturalise the content and  make it seem more real. Other methods deliberately breach convention to create an effect, such as the canted angles, rapid edits, and slow motion shots used in films with aestheticized violence.

=====Analysis of selected films=====
{{refimprove|date=February 2016}}
* ''[[The Accused (1988 film)|The Accused]]'': In this 1988 film, filmmaker [[Jonathan Kaplan]] stages a graphic rape scene to consider the moral and legal quality of the fictional spectators who, while not engaging in the rape, nevertheless shouted encouragement to those that were.
* ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]'': Matthew Crowder analyzes the aestheticization of violence in ''Strange Days'', a film by director [[Kathryn Bigelow]] (1995). A scene graphically depicts the rape of a woman; it is "...filmed in real-time using a first-person subjective camera". ''Strange Days'' tells the story of Lenny Nero, who sells an illegal, futuristic technology that allows people to record their sensory experiences onto a minidisc, so that other people can "play back" these sensory experiences and have them "wired" directly into their brain.
**In the film, Max records his rape of Iris, and gives the recording to the unsuspecting Lenny. When the "perpetrator of violence [Max] is given control of the cinematic apparatus", this is "referencing films such as ''Peeping Tom'' (Michael Powell, 1959) and ''Halloween'' (Carpenter, 1978)". Like "''Peeping Tom's'' psychopathic killer, Max does seem to see himself as some kind of artist, recording the rape and sending it to Lenny". 
**The "...first person perspective the filming of the rape scene is unrelenting, the camera never turns away from the fear and panic of Iris whose body is not only slung about by the unknown killer but also subjected to an unflinching gaze that the audience is punished with too, made complicit in the rape by their passivity". Crowder argues that "[t]he entire notion of the subjective camera—an aesthetic element of the film—its scopophilic, voyeuristic and sadistic nature, is revealed in all its depravity". As such, "[t]he aesthetic experience of the [rape] scene is one of shock, horror, dislocation and passivity at the way the camera represents the helpless body of Iris as no more than an object".
**The film's use of "playback" clips, as in the rape scene, causes a "...stylistic disruption of Hollywood codes and an even more important aesthetic effect: the disruption of the normal codes of identification with character and narrative".&lt;ref name="crowder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savingtheworld.co.uk/showPage.php?page=22 |title=Aesthetics and Politics: Strange Days |accessdate=2007-06-08 |last=Crowder |first=Matthew |year=2006 |work=Saving The World |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822044114/http://www.savingtheworld.co.uk/showPage.php?page=22 |archivedate=2007-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Bigelow was criticized for the rape scene by [[Carla Peterson (academic)|Carla Peterson]], in her article "Director joins boys' club -- and it only costs her compassion" (1995).  Crowder claims that Peterson attacked ''Strange Days'' "... as misogynist and offensive because she [Peterson] feels that it tries to create an unproblematic, if slightly uncomfortable, spectacle out of rape". As such, Crowder argues that Peterson "... fails to see that the film concerns more than a logical narrative (which if anything grows increasingly incoherent)" and claims that Peterson has "...misread the scene out of context" and dismissed "...textual elements that clearly signal criticism of both Hollywood and the cinematic apparatus as a tool of masculinist domination".
**Crowder "challenge[s] whether Peterson's response is actually aesthetic, as she makes little reference to communication between work and audience". In contrast, Crowder interprets ''Strange Days'' in a feminist context, which he argues is "...perhaps its most persuasive aesthetic effect". Crowder holds that "...''Strange Days'' can be seen as a self-conscious discourse on cinema and that part of this discourse concerns the act of aesthetic judgement". Furthermore, he states that the film's "narrative can be seen to allegorise the problem of aesthetics and value".&lt;ref name="crowder" /&gt;
* ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'': ''A Clockwork Orange'' is a 1971 film written, directed, and produced by [[Stanley Kubrick]] and based on the novel of the same name by [[Anthony Burgess]]. Set in a futuristic England (circa 1995, as imagined in 1965), it follows the life of a teenage gang leader named Alex. In Alexander Cohen's analysis of Kubrick's film, he argues that the "ultra-violence" of the young protagonist, Alex, "...represents the breakdown of culture itself". In the film, gang members are "...[s]eeking idle de-contextualized violence as entertainment" as an escape from the emptiness of their [[dystopia]]n society.
**Cohen claims that in the film, "...the violence of modern technology sees its reflection in Ultraviolence, beyond violence". When the protagonist murders a woman in her home, Cohen states that Kubrick presents a "[s]cene of aestheticized death" by setting the murder in a room filled with "...modern art which depict scenes of sexual intensity and bondage"; as such, the scene depicts a "...struggle between high-culture which has aestheticized violence and sex into a form of autonomous art, and the very image of post-modern mastery".&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cinemaspace.berkeley.edu/Cinema_Beyond/C_B.lectures/ClockworkOrange/Benj_CultIndustr_Clckwrk.html |title=Clockwork Orange and the Aestheticization of Violence |accessdate=2007-06-08 |last=Cohen |first=Alexander J. |year=1998 |publisher=UC Berkeley Program in Film Studies |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515160450/http://cinemaspace.berkeley.edu/Cinema_Beyond/C_B.lectures/ClockworkOrange/Benj_CultIndustr_Clckwrk.html |archivedate=2007-05-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Afro-Surrealism''' or '''Afrosurrealism''' is a literary and cultural aesthetic that is a response to mainstream [[surrealism]] in order to reflect the lived experience of [[people of color]]. First coined by [[Amiri Baraka]] in 1974,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=D. Scot|first1=Miller|title=Call it Afro-Surreal|url=http://sfbgarchive.48hills.org/sfbgarchive/2009/05/19/call-it-afro-surreal/|website=San Francisco Bay Guarian|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; this movement focuses on the present day experience of African Americans.  Afro-Surrealism is based on the manifesto written by D. Scot Miller, in which he says, "Afro-Surrealism sees that all 'others' who create from their actual, lived experience are surrealist..."  The manifesto delineates Afro-Surrealism from Surrealism and Afro-Futurism. The manifesto also declares the necessity of Afro-Surrealism, especially in [[San Francisco]], California. The manifesto lists ten tenants that Afro-Surrealism follows including how "Afro-Surrealists restore the cult of the past," and how "Afro-Surreal presupposes that beyond this visible world, there is an invisible world striving to manifest, and it is our job to uncover it."

Afro-Surrealism can be seen in music, photography, film, the visual arts and poetry. Notable practitioners of Afro-Surrealism include [[Ted Joans]], [[Bob Kaufman]], [[Krista Franklin]], [[Kool Keith]], [[Terrence Nance]], [[Will Alexander (poet)|Will Alexander]], [[India Sky Davis]], [[Kara Walker]], [[Samuel R. Delany]], [[Starr Finch]], Romare Bearden and [[Christopher Burch (artist)|Christopher Burch]].

== Influence ==
The AfroSurreal arts movement came about after D. Scot Miller penned The Afrosurreal Manifesto for The San Francisco Bay Guardian in May, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://sfbgarchive.48hills.org/sfbgarchive/2009/05/19/call-it-afro-surreal/&lt;/ref&gt; Until that time, the term "Afrosurreal Expressionism" was used solely to describe the writings of Henry Dumas by Amiri Baraka. Later that year, Miller spoke with Baraka about extending the term by shortening the description. It was agreed by the two of them that "Afrosurreal" without the "expressionism" would allow further exploration of the term.  [http://sfbgarchive.48hills.org/sfbgarchive/2009/10/28/anti-doofus-agenda/].  Afrosurrealism may have some similar origins to [[surrealism]] in the mid-1920s, in that an aspect of it [Negritude] came after [[André Breton]] wrote the [[Surrealist Manifesto]], but as Leopold Senghor points out in Miller's manifesto, “European Surrealism is empirical. African Surrealism is mystical and metaphorical.”.&lt;ref&gt;http://sfbgarchive.48hills.org/sfbgarchive/2009/05/19/call-it-afro-surreal/&lt;/ref&gt;

Afro-Surrealism incorporates aspects of the [[Harlem Renaissance]], [[Négritude]] and Black Radical Imagination as described by Professor Robin DG Kelley in his definitive work Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination (2003),&lt;ref&gt;https://openspace.sfmoma.org/2017/05/a-converstion-with-robin-d-g-kelley/&lt;/ref&gt; and further with his definitive Afrosurreal historical anthology, Black, Brown, &amp; Beige:
Surrealist Writings from Africa and the Diaspora (2009).&lt;ref&gt;https://muse.jhu.edu/book/3194&lt;/ref&gt;  Aspects of Afro-Surrealism can be traced to Martiniquan Suzanne Césaire’s discussion of the “revolutionary impetus of surrealism” in the 1940s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Editor’s Notes|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/black_camera/v005/5.1.editor.html|journal = Black Camera|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 1947-4237|pages = 1–2|volume = 5|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though much has been written and said about artist/activist/statesmen Aimé Césaire, much more needs to written about his partner Suzanne, a brilliant surrealist thinker, and mother of the Afrosurreal aesthetic. Her quest for “The Marvelous” over the “miserablism” expressed in the usual arts of protest inspired the Tropiques surrealist group, and especially René Ménil.

“The true task of mankind consists solely in the attempt to bring the marvelous into real life,” Ménil says in “Introduction to the Marvelous,”[1930s] “so that life can become more encompassing. So long as the mythic imagination is not able to overcome each and every boring mediocrity, human life will amount to nothing but useless, dull experiences, just killing time, as they say.”

Suzanne Césaire’s proclamation, “Be in permanent readiness for The Marvelous,” quickly became a credo of the movement; the word “marvelous” has since become re-contextualized with regard to contemporary black arts and interventions.&lt;ref&gt;https://openspace.sfmoma.org/2016/10/afrosurreal-the-marvelous-and-the-invisible/&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1956 essay for ''[[Présence Africaine]]'' Haitian novelist [[Jacques Stephen Alexis]] wrote,'' "What, then, is the Marvellous, except the imagery in which a people wraps its experience, reflects its conception of the world and of life, its faith, its hope, its confidence in man, in a great justice, and the explanation which it finds for the forces antagonistic to progress?"''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Introduction: The No-Theory Chant of Afrosurrealism|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/black_camera/v005/5.1.francis03.html|journal = Black Camera|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 1947-4237|pages = 95–112|volume = 5|issue = 1|first = Terri|last = Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, Alexis is seen to have an acute sense of reality that is not dissimilar to traditional surrealism, and his coining of the term "Marvelous Realism" reflects how he was influenced by the earlier works of the Negritude/Black Surrealist Movement.

== Development ==
Afro-Surrealism was coined by [[Amiri Baraka]] in his 1974 essay on Black Arts Movement avant-garde writer [[Henry Dumas]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/10/01/433229181/henry-dumas-wrote-about-black-people-killed-by-cops-then-he-was-killed-by-a-cop&lt;/ref&gt;  Baraka notes that Dumas is able to write about ancient mysteries that were simultaneously relevant to the present day. This idea that the past resurfaces to haunt the present day is a crucial to Afro-Surrealism.

Cinematographer [[Arthur Jafa]] expanded the field of Afro-Surrealism by experimenting with film. Jafa introduces the idea of "the alien familiar," in order to represent the Black experience and its innate surreal characteristics. "I want it to have something that I and my friends call 'the alien familiar.' If a work succeeds in a way or is able to conjure what a Black cinema would be or what this hypothetical manifestation of this particular tradition in the cinematic arena might be, it should be both alien because you’ve never seen anything quite like it, and at the same time, it should be familiar on some level to Black audiences."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Jafa, “The Notion of Treatment: Black Aesthetics and Film, based on an interview with Peter Hassli and additional discussions with Pearl Bowser,” in Oscar Micheaux and His Circle: African-American Filmmaking and Race Cinema of the Silent Era, ed. Pearl Bowser et al. (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2001), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; This focus on the alien aspect of the Black experience, and on Black folk culture, are what separate Afro-Surrealism from magical realism and surrealism.

=== The Future-Past ===
&lt;ref&gt;Miller, D. S. "Afrosurreal Manifesto: Black Is the New black—a 21st-Century Manifesto." ''Black Camera'', vol. 5 no. 1, 2013, pp. 113-117. ''Project MUSE'', muse.jhu.edu/article/525948.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Afro-Futurism which speculates on black possibilities in the future, Afrosurrealism, as Miller describes, is about the present. Rather than speculate on the coming of the four horseman, Afrosurrealists understand that they rode through too long ago. Through Afrosurrealism, artists expose this form of the future past that is "RIGHT NOW." Most Afrosurrealists reject the study of the future pushing themselves to focus on the present, the future that has already past.

=== The everyday lived experience ===

Much of Afro-Surrealism is concerned with the everyday life because it is said that there is nothing more surreal than the Black experience.  According to Terri Francis, "Afrosurrealism is art with skin on it where the texture of the object tells its story, how it weathered burial below consciousness, and how it emerged somewhat mysteriously from oceans of forgotten memories and discarded keepsakes. This photograph figures Afrosurrealism as bluesy, kinky-spooky."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Meditation|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/black_camera/v005/5.1.francis02.html|journal = Black Camera|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 1947-4237|pages = 94-94|volume = 5|issue = 1|first = Terri|last = Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Present day realism ===
In the manifesto from which present day Afrosurrealism is based, writer D. Scot Miller states in a response to Afrofuturism:

"Afro-Futurism is a diaspora intellectual and artistic movement that turns to science, technology, and science fiction to speculate on black possibilities in the future. Afro-Surrealism is about the present. There is no need for tomorrow’s-tongue speculation about the future. Concentration camps, bombed-out cities, famines, and enforced sterilization have already happened. To the Afro-Surrealist, the Tasers are here. The Four Horsemen rode through too long ago to recall. What is the future? The future has been around so long it is now the past."

As The AfroSurreal Manifesto and Afrofuturism come to the fore in artistic, commercial and academic circles, the struggle between the specific and “the scent” of present-day manifestations of Black absurdity has come with it, posing interesting challenges to both movements. For Afrofuturists, this challenge has been met by inserting Afrocentric elements into its growing pantheon, the intention being to centralize Afrofuturist focus back on the continent of Africa to enhance its specificity. For the Afrosurrealists, the focus has been set at the “here and now” of contemporary Black arts and situations in the Americas, Antilles, and beyond, searching for the nuanced “scent” of those current manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;https://openspace.sfmoma.org/2017/05/the-electrical-scent-of-damas-negritude-the-harlem-renaissance-and-the-afrosurreal/&lt;/ref&gt;

Afro-Surrealist scholar Rochelle Spencer identifies at least three different subgenres of black speculative art, and Spencer argues that Afro-Surrealism is the most present-focus, though it is not devoid of technology and may include allusions to modern technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why Black Science Fiction Studies Matter|url = http://www.themarysue.com/black-science-fiction-studies-matter/|website = www.themarysue.com|accessdate = 2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Francis, the juxtaposition between the old and the present day is what makes Afro-Surrealism so unique. As Francis puts it, "Surrealism here, the Afro-surreal, like the marvelous discussed above, is actually a realism so real, so contrary to the norms of publicized blackness, that it represents a rupture, a radical break from ordinary understanding such that the old feels new—because it was never known.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiana.edu/~blackcam/pastIssues/Fall2013.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of Afrosurrealist Works ==

=== ''Zong!,'' M. NourbSe Philip and Setaey Adamu Boateng ===
In &lt;ref&gt;Philip, Marlene Nourbese. Zong! Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;''Zong!'', M. NourbSe Philip crafts a powerful counter-narrative surrounding the events of the [[Zong massacre|''Zong'' massacre]]. Utilizing the words from the legal decision to build her poetry, Philip rejects the idea of an archival past. Instead Philip looks to the present moment to understand how to read this legal decision and understand the case. Following the footsteps of Toni Morrison’s ''Beloved'', Philip presupposes the notion of a past that is not past allowing these past artifacts to haunt the present moment. Rather than organize the fragments, Philip allows the fragments to tell themselves. This is not to say that Philip gives the fragments voices, but instead gives them space. The space in the poem allows Philip’s audience to hear the silence of these voices, to truly understand the missing narratives form the past and the role that has on the present.

=== ''Beloved'', Toni Morrison ===
As mentioned earlier, Toni Morrison’s &lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Toni. Beloved: A Novel. New York: Knopf : Distributed by Random House, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;''Beloved'' remains an important milestone for Afrosurrealists. Here, Morrison imagines a narrative of a slave women grieving the death of her baby daughter, Beloved. With no trace of a past, Beloved reappears of on the steps of 124, confused and looking for her mother. Following this moment, the novel crafts a haunting tale of a woman seeking to understand the sudden reappearance of her daughter and the scars left behind from slavery. In ''Beloved,'' Morrison attempts to come to grip with the legacies left by slavery, challenging the notion that these legacies exits only from the past. From the epigraph, “''Sixty Million and more'',” Morrison presupposes there is no way to count those affected from slavery and additionally, that the number is ever-growing into the present. In her award-winning novel, Morrison expands the idea of the past, attempting to demonstrate the past is ever present and moreover, that the past is RIGHT NOW.

{{Culture of Argentina}}
'''Argentine literature''', i.e. the set of literary works produced by writers who originated from Argentina, is one of the most prolific, relevant and influential in the whole Spanish speaking world, with renowned writers such as [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Julio Cortázar]], [[Leopoldo Lugones]] and [[Ernesto Sabato]].

==History==
===Origins===
As a matter of fact, the name of the country itself comes from a Latinism which first appeared in a literary source: [[Martin del Barco Centenera]]'s epic poem ''La Argentina'' (1602). This composition runs 10.000 verses and describes the landscape as well as the conquest of the territory. The word was reintroduced in ''Argentina manuscrita'', a prose chronicle by [[Ruy Díaz de Guzmán]].

Argentine literature began around 1550 with the work of Matías Rojas de Oquendo and Pedro González de Prado (from [[Santiago del Estero]], the first important urban settlement in Argentina), who wrote [[prose]] and [[poetry]].  They were partly inspired by oral [[Argentine Amerindians|aboriginal]] poetry—in particular, according to Carlos Abregú Virreyra, by the ''lules'', ''juríes'', ''[[diaguita]]s'' and ''tonocotés''. A [[symbiosis]] emerged between the aboriginal and Spanish traditions, creating a distinct literature, geographically limited (well into the 18th century) to the Argentine north and central regions, with the province of [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]] as its center, due to the foundation of the [[National University of Córdoba]]. Two names stand out from this period: Gaspar Juárez Baviano, and Antonia de la Paz y Figueroa, also known as "Beata Antula".

Gradually, with the economic prosperity of the port, the cultural axis moved eastward. The letters of the colonial age (Viceroyalty-[[neoclassicism]], [[baroque]] and [[Epic poetry|epic]]) grew under the protection of the [[May Revolution|independentist]] fervor: [[Vicente López y Planes]], Pantaleón Rivarola and [[Esteban de Luca]].

During the 17th century, Argentine baroque literature was poor in comparison with that from Europe and some other parts of the New World. The only remarkable poet of this period was fray [[José Luis de Tejeda]] who wrote ''Coronas líricas'' and ''El peregrino de Babilonia''

===Cultural independence from Spain===
{{main|1837 generation}}
[[File:Salon literario.jpg|thumb|The [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] of the [[1837 generation]].]]
As in the rest of the continent, strong feelings of emancipation from Spain were present in Argentina. Before independence, some [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] authors such as [[Juan Cruz Varela]] produced numerous works related with this revolutionary spirit but still under the paradoxical Spanish domain.

Argentina's true break with Spanish tradition was manifested in literature through the adoption of French [[romanticism]] as a model, postulating the return to popular sources and to the [[Middle Ages|medieval]]. This aesthetic and intellectual was brought by [[Esteban Echeverría]] who wrote the first local and realistic story, ''El Matadero'' ("The slaughterhouse"), as well as the nativist poem ''La Cautiva'' ("The Captive"), with the [[Pampas]] as its background.  His barbed wit and opposition to powerful Buenos Aires governor [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] forced him into exile.

In the middle of the 19th century [[José Mármol]] published the first Argentine novel, ''[[Amalia (novel)|Amalia]]'' (1851–1852), a [[historical novel]] set during the dark year of 1840 which mixed fictional characters (Amalia, Daniel Bello, Eduardo Belgrano) with actual historical characters like Juan Manuel de Rosas.&lt;ref&gt;María Minellono. "Entre el folletín y la novela histórica; el problema del género en ''Amalia'' de José Mármol"&lt;/ref&gt;

As Rosas' power increased, more literary works from the opposition were produced, such as [[Juan Bautista Alberdi]]'s play ''El Gigante Amapolas'', a good example of local [[sainete]]. In the genre of [[essay]], [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] published his ''[[Facundo]]'', a particular (re)vision of [[Facundo Quiroga]]'s life from a deterministic point of view. Sarmiento conveyed aspects of [[sociology]] and [[semiotic]]s in this analysis.

Echeverría, Mármol and Sarmiento are among the group of writers known as [[Generación del 37]], who are considered the first generation of local intellectuals.

Poetry lessened in combative spirit and turned towards the anecdotal and sentimental: [[Carlos Guido y Spano]] and [[Ricardo Gutiérrez]], the chronicle writers of folk literature. [[Lucio V. Mansilla]] published in 1870 ''[[Una excursión a los indios ranqueles]]'', a sort of chronicle of a voluntary expedition to sign a peace treaty with the Indians. His work (enrolled in a realistic aesthetic) anticipated Generación del '80, which would be deeply influenced by [[modernism]]. [[Juana Manuela Gorriti]] was one of the first popular female writers, mainly due to her [[melodramatic]] narrative works like the novel ''La hija del mazorquero'' and the foundation of ''La alborada'', a cultural magazine.

===''Literatura Gauchesca''===
[[File:Martin fierro 1894.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Cover of ''[[Martín Fierro]]'' by [[José Hernández (writer)|José Hernández]], 1894 edition.]]
European-oriented, indeed Euro-centric, themes and styles would remain the norm in Argentine letters, especially from Buenos Aires, during this century. The (romantic) poetry as ''La cautiva'' or the latter ''Santos Vega'' by [[Rafael Obligado]] gave a lot of importance to the nature of the ''pampa'',&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo Romano. ''El nativismo como ideología en "Santos Vega" de Rafael Obligado'': Editorial Biblos&lt;/ref&gt; sharing some elements with a picturesque, imitation-[[gaucho]] literature, purporting to use the language of the [[gaucho]]s and to reflect their mentality. The first current is known as ''poesía nativista'' (nativist poetry) and became a literary tradition. The second (known as ''poesía gauchesca'') developed in parallel as a part of that generation's understanding of national identity. Although it also is a product of literary authors, this writing takes the voice of the gaucho as protagonist from the beginning. ''Gauchesca'' is related to ''payador's singing'', a payador being a modern equivalent of the illiterate medieval singers. A payador's work, in opposition to ''gauchesca'', is sung spontaneously.&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Payador|Wikipedia article]] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ''gauchesco'' author was [[Bartolomé Hidalgo]] who wrote during the [[Argentine War of Independence|war of independence]] and therefore his works had a strong political ideology. His compositions were mainly ''[[cielitos]]'' (''payadoresque'' songs but with provocative political messages) and ''diálogos patrióticos'' (conversations between two characters about current affairs).

In a second period, ''gauchesca'' was influenced by political-faction fights. [[Estanislao del Campo]], and [[Hilario Ascasubi]] are the most representative writers of this period. Del Campo wrote ''''Fausto'''', a poem which has been read both as a parody of gauchesca and an intelligent joke towards city people.&lt;ref&gt;Enrique Anderson Imbert. Prólogo a ''Fausto''. Buenos Aires: Editorial de Belgrano&lt;/ref&gt; In the poem, Anastasio El Pollo meets a friend and tells him his impressions on particular event: he has seen the Devil. What El Pollo doesn't know (or pretends he doesn't) is that all he saw was actually an [[opera]] performance at [[Teatro Colón]].&lt;ref&gt;Enrique Anderson Imbert. Análisis de Fausto. Buenos Aires: CEAL, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

The last author of gauchesca is [[José Hernández (writer)|José Hernández]], the author of [[Martín Fierro]]. Gauchesca leaves its political influences and becomes social in the sense that gauchos are disappearing, mainly due to Sarmiento and the new economic model. Hernández is considered the responsible for consolidating the gauchesco style.

===Generation of 1880===
The generation of 1880 emphasized the European color and cultural supremacy of [[Buenos Aires]].  The [[immigration|migratory]] current of mixed ethnicity accentuated the change of the ''big village'' for the ''cosmopolitan metropolis''. The poetry of this period is lyric: [[Leopoldo Díaz]] y [[Pedro Bonifacio Palacios|Almafuerte]]. The latter usually depicts the worker's life in passionate attacks against the contradictions of contemporary society. Almafuerte (pseudonym of [[Pedro Bonifacio Palacios]]) was also a teacher and a journalist whose opinions and articles gave him a lot of problems.

[[Essay]] is a recent genre that developed in the late 19th century: [[José Manuel Estrada]], [[Pedro Goyena]] and [[Joaquín V. González]].

Narrative works oscillated between social issues and folk literature. The predominant tendency was [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], best represented by [[Miguel Cané]] in his autobiographical novel ''[[Juvenilia]]''. Other writers influenced by realism were [[Lucio V. Mansilla]], [[Francisco Sicardi]], [[Benito Lynch]] and [[Carlos María Ocantos]]. [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] was also an important tendency towards the end of the century. Argentine Naturalism was commanded by [[Eugenio Cambaceres]] in his novels ''Sin rumbo'' and ''Música sentimental'', almost forgotten today. Cambaceres was inspired by [[Émile Zola]]'s theory about the naturalistic approach to literary work, but its ideology suffered considerable alterations. [[Julián Martel]] and [[Antonio Argerich]] with {{lang|es|¿Inocentes o culpables?}} added a highly loaded moral touch to Argentine naturalism.

===Modern===
[[File:Bioy Casares, Ocampo y Borges.jpg|thumb|[[Adolfo Bioy Casares]], [[Victoria Ocampo]] and [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in [[Mar del Plata]], 1935.]]
Towards the end of the 19th century, led by the [[Nicaragua]]n [[Rubén Darío]], [[modernism]] appears in Latin American literature. Preciosity of manner and a strong influence from [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] sum up the new genre, which inspires the clearest voice in poetry, [[Leopoldo Lugones]], who was the author of the first Argentine [[science fiction]] story. The first truly modern generation in Argentine literature is the [[Martín Fierro|Martinfierristas]] (c. 1922). The movement contributes an intellectual doctrine in which a number of current trends come together: the trend represented by the [[Florida group]], adscript to [[Ultraist movement|ultraísmo]], with [[Oliverio Girondo]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Leopoldo Marechal]] and Macedonio Fernández; and the trend of Boedo, impressed by Russian [[Literary realism|realism]], with Raúl González Tuñón, César Tiempo y Elías Catelnuovo. [[Ricardo Güiraldes]], however, remains classical in style, giving a whole new freshness to ''gauchesca'' poetry and writing what is perhaps the novel, ''[[Don Segundo Sombra]]''.

[[Benito Lynch]] (1885–1951), an eccentric short-story writer who, like Güiraldes, does not easily fit into any "generation", wrote his quirky tales in an enchanted neo-''gauchoesque'' manner about this time.
Between the end of this decade and the beginning of the following one emerged the ''Novísimos'' ("Newest"), a generation of poets (Arturo Cambours Ocampo, Carlos Carlino and José Portogalo), fiction writers (Arturo Cerretani, [[Roberto Arlt]], Luis Maria Albamonte and Luis Horacio Velázquez) and playwrights (Roberto Valenti, Juan Oscar Ponferrada and Javier Villafañe). The group promoted philosophical reflection and a new essence for ''Argentinidad''. [[Leopoldo Marechal]]'s novel Adán Buenosayres, published in 1948 and praised by [[Julio Cortázar]] in 1949.

Also worthy of note is the literary work of [[Leonardo Castellani]] (1899–1981), a Jesuit priest who left a considerable bulk of essays, novels, tales and poetry.  Expelled from the [[Company of Jesus]], the outspoken Castellani was also widely ignored  – like his contemporary Marechal – by the literary ''intelligentsia'' of his time due to his nationalist ideology.

===Generation of '37===
The ''Generation of 1937'' centers on poetry, where it developed the descriptive, nostalgic and meditative in the work of [[Ricardo E. Molinari]], [[Vicente Barbieri]], [[Olga Orozco]], León Benarós and Alfonso Sola Gonzáles.  Fiction writers subscribed to [[idealism]] and [[magic realism]], María Granata, [[Adolfo Bioy Casares]], [[Julio Cortázar]], [[Silvina Ocampo]]) or to a subtler form of [[realism (arts)|realism]] [[Manuel Mujica Laínez]], Ernesto L. Castro, [[Ernesto Sabato]] and Abelardo Arias) with some urban touches, as well as folk literature (Joaquín Gómez Bas and Roger Plá).

Essayists do not abound. Antonio Pagés Larraya, Emilio Carilla, Luis Soler Cañas are some of the few who stand out, although the greatest Argentine essayist after Sarmiento – [[Ezequiel Martínez Estrada]] – also belonged to the Generation of '37. Many of these writers and a number of European ones contributed extensively to ''[[Sur (magazine)|Sur]]'', a literary journal published by [[Victoria Ocampo]], a noted commentator on the day's culture.

===Neohumanism, Existentialism and other influences===
[[File:Cortazar2.jpg|thumb|[[Julio Cortázar]] in 1967, photograph by [[Sara Facio]].]]
In 1950,  another milestone arose: the [[New Humanism]], a response to World War II and its aftermath.  On one level are [[avant-garde|avant-gardists]] like Raúl Gustavo Aguirre, Edgar Bayley and Julio Llinás; on another, [[existentialism|existentialists]]: José Isaacson, Julio Arístides and Miguel Ángel Viola. Further away are those who reconcile both tendencies with a regionalist tendency: Alfredo Veiravé, Jaime Dávalos and Alejandro Nicotra.  Other fiction writers left a highly charged testimony of the times: [[Beatriz Guido]], [[David Viñas]], [[Marco Denevi]] and [[Silvina Bullrich]]. In a majority of the writers, a strong influence of [[Anglo-Saxon poetry|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Italian poetry]] can be perceived. Of particular interest are the poetic works of two of Marechal's disciples, the poets [[Rafael Squirru]] and Fernando Demaría.

A new trend started in 1960, continuing until about 1990. Its influences are heterogeneous: [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]], [[Albert Camus|Camus]], Eluard; some Spanish writers, like Camilo José Cela; and previous Argentine writers like Borges, Arlt, Cortázar and Marechal. Two trends were in evidence: the tracing of [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] time and [[historicity]] (Horacio Salas, [[Alejandra Pizarnik]], Ramón Plaza) and the examination of urban and social disarray: ([[Abelardo Castillo]], Marta Lynch, [[Manuel Puig]], Alicia Steinberg).

===Dirty War===
The 1970s were a dark period for intellectual creation in Argentina. The epoch is characterised by the [[exile]] ([[Juan Gelman]], [[Antonio Di Benedetto]]) or death (Roberto Santoro, Haroldo Conti, and [[Rodolfo Walsh]]) of major writers. The remaining literary journalists, like [[Liliana Heker]], veiled their opinions in their work. Some journalists ([[Rodolfo Walsh]]), poets (Agustín Tavitián and Antonio Aliberti), fiction writers ([[Osvaldo Soriano]], Fernando Sorrentino), and essayists (Ricardo Herrera, [[María Rosa Lojo]]) stood out among the vicissitudes and renewed the field of ethical and aesthetic ideas.

===Current===
The 1990s are marked by reunion among survivors of different generations, in an intellectual coalition for the review of values and texts as Argentina faced the end of the century. Some examples are [[Alan Pauls]], [[Mario Areca]], [[Aníbal Cristobo]], [[Ernesto de Sanctis]], [[Marco Denevi]], [[Edgar Brau]] and some more.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4536">'''Art fabrication''' is a process or service relating to the production of large or technically difficult artworks.

When a lone artist or designer is incapable or chooses not to realize the creation of his or her own design or conception, he or she may enlist the assistance of an art fabrication studio.  Typically, an art fabrication studio has access to the resources, specialized machinery, and labor necessary to execute particularly complex projects.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Notable art fabricators==

Lippincott, Inc., founded in 1966 by Donald Lippincott and Roxanne Everett, was the first company to devote itself exclusively to art fabrication using industrial techniques. The company encouraged a collaborative relationship between artists and the fabrication crew, allowing the creation of work using media that artists had not previously used. Lippincott, Inc. fabricated work for almost 100 artists, including [[Barnett Newman]], [[Louise Nevelson]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Robert Indiana]], and [[Ellsworth Kelly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''Beaumont Street''' is a street in the centre of [[Oxford]], [[England]].

The street was laid out from 1828 to 1837 with elegant terraced houses in the [[Regency architecture|Regency style]]. Before that, it was the location of [[Beaumont Palace]], now noted by a plaque near the junction with [[Walton Street]]. [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] considered it "''the finest street ensemble of Oxford.''"&lt;ref name="pevsner"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Buildings of England: Oxfordshire |last1=Sherwood |first1=Jennifer |last2=Pevsner |first2=Nikolaus |authorlink2=Nikolaus Pevsner | year=1974 | publisher=[[Penguin Books]] | pages=324–325 | isbn=0-14-071045-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard I of England]] (reign 6 July 1189 – 6 April 1199) and [[John, King of England]] (reign 6 April 1199 – 19 October 1216) the sons of [[Henry II of England]] were both born at [[Beaumont Palace]] in Oxford on 8 September 1157 and 24 December 1166 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Vivian|title=Kings &amp; Queens|year=1996|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-00-472295-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the western end is [[Worcester College]] and the junction with [[Walton Street]] to the north and [[Worcester Street]] to the south. Halfway along to the north is [[St John Street, Oxford|St John Street]]. To the south is the [[Oxford Playhouse]], designed by Sir [[Edward Maufe]] and built in 1938, where many [[University of Oxford|University]] productions are held. To the north at the eastern end is the [[Ashmolean Museum]]. Opposite the eastern end is the [[Martyrs' Memorial]]. Here, Beaumont Street adjoins [[St Giles' Street, Oxford|St Giles']] to the north and [[Magdalen Street]] to the south. Oxford's foremost hotel, the [[Macdonald Randolph Hotel|Randolph]], is on the corner with Magdalen Street, designed by [[William Wilkinson (architect)|William Wilkinson]] in the [[Victorian Gothic]] style and built in 1864.&lt;ref name="pevsner" /&gt; An extension was added in 1952 to the west, designed by [[J. Hopgood]].

The Institute of Archaeology, part of the [[School of Archaeology]] in the [[University of Oxford]], was established in 1962 and is located at 36 Beaumont Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/institute.html Institute of Archaeology], [http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/ School of Archaeology], [[University of Oxford]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

In poem "Wherefrom"&lt;ref&gt;"[https://archive.org/details/amongflowersand00bourgoog Among the flowers, and other poems] by Francis William Bourdillon. 1878. Publisher "Marcus Ward"&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Francis William Bourdillon]] a British poet and translator wrote about Beaumont Street legend:


''Just at the end of Beaumont Street,

''In front of Worcester walls,

''Strange shrieks of woe the passer greet,

''As every footstep falls.''


The street is a favoured location for [[dentist]]s and [[physician|doctor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.19beaumontstgp.nhs.uk/ 19 Beaumont Street Surgery — Dr MacLennan &amp; Partners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014034210/http://www.19beaumontstgp.nhs.uk/ |date=14 October 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.28beaumontstreet.co.uk/ 28 Beaumont Street Medical Practice — Drs Sichel and Ferguson].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.33beaumontstreet.com/ 33 Beaumont Street — Specialist Dental Practice, Oxford].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Byham Theater''' is a landmark building at 101 Sixth Street in the [[Cultural District, Pittsburgh|Cultural District]] of [[Downtown Pittsburgh|Downtown]] [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. Originally built in 1903 as The Gayety Theater, the former [[vaudeville]] house was renovated and reopened as The Byham Theater in 1990.

Built in 1903 and opened [[Halloween]] night 1904, the then-named Gayety Theater was stage and [[vaudeville]] house, and it featured stars such as [[Ethel Barrymore]], [[Gertrude Lawrence]], and [[Helen Hayes]]. It was renamed The Fulton in the 1930s when it became a full-time movie theater. The classic horror film ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'', which was filmed in and around Pittsburgh, had its world premiere at the Fulton in 1968. In 1990 the [[Pittsburgh Cultural Trust]] bought the theater and refurbished the Fulton as part of its plan for the Cultural District. [[Carolyn M. Byham]] and [[William C. Byham]] of Pittsburgh made a major naming gift for a 1995 renovation, and it has been the Byham Theater since.

A '''digiglyph''' is the final stage of a printmaking process that combines traditional [[monoprinting]] techniques with digital manipulation and outsourcing. A digiglyph differs from a traditional [[monoprint]] or [[monotype]] in that it uses a completed hand-drawn monoprint/monotype as the first stage of a final piece. The monoprint is scanned, and then its composition is further manipulated using computer software, before being reprinted and hand embellished. Digital digiglyph files can be used to produce editions; however, hand embellishment of each print transforms the digiglyph into a one-of-a-kind image.

== Technique ==
Starting out as a traditional monoprint, the digiglyph departs from hand work by using computer software to scan the completed print and layer in conceptually related material. The completed digital composition is exported and the finished digital print is then embellished by hand, creating a unique print.

The '''Dogmatic Sarcophagus''', also known as the "Trinity Sarcophagus"  is an [[early Christian]] [[sarcophagus]] dating to 320–350,&lt;ref&gt;Various scholars give narrower ranges, but the great majority of dates given fall within this range&lt;/ref&gt; now in the [[Vatican Museums]] (Vatican 104).&lt;ref&gt;There is another "Trinity Sarcophagus" at [[Arles]], alsao with a three-figure Trinity.&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered in the 19th century during rebuilding works at the [[basilica di San Paolo fuori le Mura]], in [[Rome]], [[Italy]].

Together with the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]], it one of the most important examples of Christian-Roman sculpture of the [[Constantine I|Constantinian]] era. It draws its name from its clear references to the [[dogma]]s of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] (325), in particular to Christ being consubstantial with God the Father, as shown (for example) by the scene of a figure with the appearance of Jesus between [[Adam and Eve]], though whether the figure is to be understood as Christ or God the Father is less clear – the dogmatic point works either way.&lt;ref name=Milburn/&gt;

==Description==
The front face is split into two registers, typical of the style of the time, with [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] subjects and a central shell-shaped ''[[clipeus]]'' containing the portraits of the dead couple, embraced and wearing marital clothes typical of the 4th century (''tunica manicata'', ''dalmatina'' and ''[[toga|toga contabulata]]'' by the man, who holds a ''rotulus'' in his hand, and tunic and [[palla]] by the woman). The heads are basic types, showing there was either no desire or not enough time to personalize the sarcophagus.

In the upper register are five episodes, two from the [[book of Genesis]] and two miracles of Christ:
*Three similar bearded figures representing the [[Trinity]], the middle enthroned representing [[God the Father]], creating [[Eve]] from the rib of [[Adam]], who lies on the ground.&lt;ref name=Milburn/&gt; 
*A younger, beardless, figure with the [[depiction of Jesus|conventional appearance of Christ]] between Adam and Eve, and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.
*[[Marriage at Cana]]
* [[Feeding the Five Thousand|Multiplication of the loaves]] 
*[[Resurrection of Lazarus]]

In the lower register are six scenes, one linked to Christ's birth, two to the Bible and three to St Peter:
*[[Adoration of the Magi]], with an enthroned Virgin and Child, and with Magi in oriental dress and [[Phrygian cap]]s, and with [[Balaam]] behind the throne
*Healing the blind
*[[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] in the lions' den
*[[Habbakuk]] with the basket of loaves and the angel
*[[Saint Peter|Peter]] denying Christ, with the crowing cockerel from the Gospel account
*Peter's arrest, by two soldiers wearing [[Pannonia]]n caps
*[[Moses]] or Peter creating a spring of water in the presence of a [[centurion]] (with the latter wearing typical 4th century military dress)

The sarcophagus can be dated to between 330 and 340 due to the male hairstyles (apart from those of Christ and Peter), the squat square figures and the lack of calligraphic detail. There are echoes of the previous "plebeian" official art, which has led some to suggest that the sarcophagus is from the same workshop that produced and amended the reliefs for the [[Arch of Constantine]] (dedicated in 315).

==Iconography==
The account in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] naturally credits the [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] to the single figure of God, in Christian terms, God the Father.  However the first person plural in Genesis 1:26 "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness", and New Testament references to Christ as creator (John 1:3, Colossians 1:15) led Early Christian writers to associate the Creation with the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]], or pre-existing Christ.  
  
A number of other sarcophagi, most conveniently collected in the same Vatican collection as the Dogmatic Sarcophagus, also show groups of three figures usually interpreted as representing the Trinity in scenes from Genesis.  Sometimes one figure is beardless, while the other two are bearded.{{sfn|Jensen|2003|loc=Figs 5–11}} Given the funerary context, and that adjacent scenes often show [[New Testament]] miracles, including the [[Raising of Lazarus]], the emphasis of these scenes may relate as much to the overcoming of sin and hope of new life as the [[Fall of Man]].{{sfn|Jensen|2003|p=37–38}}

Christ was compared to Adam in [[Book of Romans|Romans]] 5:14–21, and was sometimes called the "new Adam", especially in connection with [[baptism]] (at this period catechumens were apparently naked when this was administered).  This may also be referred to in the second scene, or the central figure may represent the [[Logos (Christianity)|Divine Logos]], who is also shown with the appearance of Jesus.{{sfn|Jensen|2003|p=27-29}} The scene represents the "division of labours" between Adam and Eve; the central figure holds a sheaf of corn in one hand and a dead [[hare]] (in another Vatican example a lamb) in the other,{{sfn|Jensen|2003|p=33}} although one might expect hunting hares to be Adam's task and agriculture Eve's, rather than the opposite as the sarcophagus seems to suggest.

Adam and Eve also functioned as [[typology (theology)|typological]] forerunners of Jesus and Mary, and the Tree of Knowledge of the Cross of the [[Crucifixion]].  In addition they represented faithfulness in marriage, and scenes of them between the Logos are interpreted by some as representing their marriage ceremony, suitable for the sarcophagus of a married couple.{{sfn|Jensen|2003|p=47-52}}

{{Refimprove|date=February 2018}}

In [[computer programming]], an '''entry point''' is where control is transferred from a [[Loader (computing)|loader]] or [[operating system]] to a [[computer program]], at which place the processor enters a program or a [[Machine code|code]] fragment and [[Execution (computing)|execution]] begins. (It's possible that the computer program itself is the operating system, in which case the launcher is the [[bootloader]]). In some operating systems or [[programming language]]s, the initial entry is not part of the program but of the [[runtime library]], in which case the runtime library initializes the program and then the runtime library enters the program. In other cases, the program may call the runtime library before doing anything when it is entered for the first time, and, after the runtime library returns, the actual code of the program begins to execute. This marks the transition from [[load time]] (and dynamic [[link time]], if present) to [[run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]].

In simple [[Layout (computing)|layouts]], programs begin their execution at the beginning, which is common in [[scripting language]]s, simple binary [[executable]] formats, and [[boot loader]]s. In other cases, the entry point is at some other fixed point, which is some [[memory address]] than can be an [[absolute address]] or relative address ([[offset (computer science)|offset]]).

Alternatively, execution of a program can begin at a named point, either with a conventional name defined by the [[programming language]] or [[operating system]], or at a caller-specified name. In many programming languages, notably [[C (programming language)|C]], this named point is a function called &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;; as a result, the entry point is often called the '''main function'''.

A common form of the '''main function''' in C, C# or C++, is a static method, either returning no data (&lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt;) or a number (&lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;), also known as the [[return code]].
[[File:Program-entry-point-demonstration-CSharp.png|alt=Example of the main function, in C#.|none|thumb|467x467px|How the &lt;code&gt;Main()&lt;/code&gt; might look in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] source code. Different parts are labeled for users who know less about programming.]]

== Usage ==
Entry points apply both to source code and to [[executable]] files. However, in day-to-day [[software development]], programmers specify the entry points only in source code, which makes them much better known. Entry points in executable files depend on the [[application binary interface]] (ABI) of the actual operating system, and are generated by the compiler or linker (if not fixed by the ABI). Non-executable [[object file]]s may also have entry points, which are used later by the linker when generating entry points of an executable file.

Entry points are capable of passing on command arguments, variables, or other information as a local variable used by the &lt;code&gt;Main()&lt;/code&gt; method. This way, specific options may be set upon execution of the program, and then interpreted by the program. Many programs use this as an alternative way to configure different settings, or perform a set variety of actions using a single program.

=== Contemporary ===
In most of today's popular programming languages and operating systems, a [[computer program]] usually only has a single ''entry point''.

In [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[D programming language|D]], [[Rust programming language|Rust]] and [[Kotlin (programming language)|Kotlin]] programs this is a [[Function (computer science)|function]] named &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;; in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] it is a [[static method]] named &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; (although the class must be specified at the invocation time), and in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] it is a static method named &lt;code&gt;Main&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLTBW_2.3.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r3.cbclx01/mainf.htm |title=The main() function |publisher=[[IBM]] |work=ibm.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/acy3edy3.aspx |title=Main() and Command-Line Arguments (C# Programming Guide) |publisher=Msdn.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In major operating systems, the standard executable format has a single entry point. In the [[Executable and Linkable Format]] (ELF), used in [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems such as [[Linux]], the entry point is specified in the &lt;code&gt;e_entry&lt;/code&gt; field of the ELF header. In the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (gcc), the entry point used by the linker is the &lt;code&gt;_start&lt;/code&gt; symbol. Similarly, in the [[Portable Executable]] format, used in [[Microsoft Windows]], the entry point is specified by the &lt;code&gt;AddressOfEntryPoint&lt;/code&gt; field, which is inherited from [[COFF]]. In [[COM file]]s, the entry point is at the fixed [[offset (computer science)|offset]] of 0100h.

One notable modern exception to the single-entry-point paradigm is [[Android (operating system)|Android]].  Unlike applications on most other operating systems, Android applications do not have a single entry point{{snd}} there is no &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function, for example.  Instead of a single entry point, they have essential components (which include activities and services) which the system can instantiate and run as needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/android/devguide/guide/topics/fundamentals.html |title=Application Fundamentals |work=Android Development |accessdate=2014-02-19 |publisher=linuxtopia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An occasionally used technique is the [[fat binary]], which consists of several executables for different targets packaged in a single binary. Most commonly, this is implemented by a single overall entry point, which is compatible with all targets and branches to the target-specific entry point. Alternative techniques include storing separate executables in separate [[fork (file system)|forks]], each with its own entry point, which is then selected by the operating system.

=== Historical ===
Historically, and in some contemporary [[legacy system]]s, such as [[OpenVMS|VMS]] and [[OS/400]], computer programs have a multitude of ''entry points'', each corresponding to the different functionalities of the program. The usual way to denote entry points, as used system-wide in VMS and in [[PL/I]] and [[Macro (computer science)|MACRO]] programs, is to append them at the end of the name of the [[executable image]], delimited by a [[dollar sign]] ($), e.g. &lt;code&gt;directory.exe$make&lt;/code&gt;.

The [[Apple I]] computer also used this to some degree. For example, an alternative entry point in Apple I's [[BASIC]] would keep the BASIC program useful when the reset button was accidentally pushed.{{Clarify|date=July 2010}}&lt;!-- in memory? difficult to know without a reference --&gt;

== Exit point ==
In general, programs can exit at any time in an unstructured way, by returning to the operating system or [[crash (computing)|crashing]]. Scripting languages typically end by reaching the end of the program, but for binaries the control must return to the operating system or it will simply run off the end of the process's memory, either executing whatever code is there or (in modern operating systems) resulting in a [[memory access]] violation and termination by the operating system.

Usually, there is not a single exit point specified in a program. However, in other cases runtimes ensure that programs always terminate in a structured way via a single exit point, which is guaranteed unless the runtime itself crashes; this allows cleanup code to be run, such as &lt;code&gt;atexit&lt;/code&gt; handlers. This can be done by either requiring that programs terminate by returning from the main function, by calling a specific exit function, or by the runtime catching exceptions or operating system signals.

==Programming languages==
In many programming languages, the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function is where a program starts its execution. It enables high-level organization of the program's functionality, and typically has access to the [[command-line argument|command arguments]] given to the program when it was executed.

The main function is generally the first programmer-written [[subroutine|function]] that runs when a program starts, and is invoked directly from the system-specific initialization contained in the [[runtime environment]] ([[crt0]] or equivalent). However, some languages can execute user-written functions before main runs, such as the constructors of [[C++]] global objects.

In other languages, notably [[scripting language]]s, execution simply begins at the start of the program.

A non-exhaustive list of programming languages follows, describing their way of defining the main entry point:

===APL===
In [[APL (programming language)|APL]], when a workspace is loaded, the contents of "quad LX" (latent expression) variable is interpreted as an APL expression and executed.

===C and C++===
In [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]], the [[function prototype]] of the main function looks like one of the following:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int main(void);
int main();

int main(int argc, char **argv);
int main(int argc, char *argv[]);
int main(int argc, char **argv, char **env);



// more specifically in C
// NOT according to the ISO C standard 5.1.2.2.1
// BUT in embedded programming depending on the µC, this form is also used
void main (void);


&lt;/source&gt;

The [[parameter (computer science)|parameters]] &lt;code&gt;argc&lt;/code&gt;, ''argument count'', and &lt;code&gt;argv&lt;/code&gt;, ''argument vector'',&lt;ref&gt;argv: the vector term in this variable's name is used in traditional sense to refer to strings.&lt;/ref&gt; respectively give the number and values of the program's [[command-line argument]]s. The names of &lt;code&gt;argc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;argv&lt;/code&gt; may be any valid identifier in C, but it is common convention to use these names. In C++, the names are to be taken literally, and the "void" in the parameter list is to be omitted, if strict conformance is desired.&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/comp.std.c++/browse_thread/thread/a1e5504b499bc58f Parameter types and names of main]&lt;/ref&gt; Other platform-dependent formats are also allowed by the C and C++ standards, except that in C++ the return type must always be &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;Section 3.6.1.2, Standard C++ 2011 edition.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, [[Unix]] (though not [[POSIX.1]]) and [[Windows]] have a third argument giving the program's [[environment variable|environment]], otherwise accessible through &lt;code&gt;getenv&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;[[stdlib.h]]&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp);
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]-based operating systems, such as [[macOS]], have a fourth parameter containing arbitrary OS-supplied information, such as the path to the executing binary:&lt;ref&gt;[http://unixjunkie.blogspot.com/2006/02/char-apple-argument-vector.html The &lt;code&gt;char *apple&lt;/code&gt; Argument Vector]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp, char **apple);
&lt;/source&gt;

The value returned from the main function becomes the [[exit status]] of the process, though the C standard only ascribes specific meaning to two values: &lt;code&gt;EXIT_SUCCESS&lt;/code&gt; (traditionally 0) and &lt;code&gt;EXIT_FAILURE&lt;/code&gt;. The meaning of other possible return values is implementation-defined. In case a return value is not defined by the programmer, an implicit &lt;code&gt;return 0;&lt;/code&gt; at the end of the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; function is inserted by the compiler; this behavior is required by the C++ standard.

It is guaranteed that &lt;code&gt;argc&lt;/code&gt; is non-negative and that &lt;code&gt;argv[argc]&lt;/code&gt; is a [[null pointer]]. By convention, the command-line arguments specified by &lt;code&gt;argc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;argv&lt;/code&gt; include the name of the program as the first element if &lt;code&gt;argc&lt;/code&gt; is greater than 0; if a user types a command of "&lt;code&gt;rm file&lt;/code&gt;", the [[shell (computing)|shell]] will initialise the &lt;code&gt;[[rm (Unix)|rm]]&lt;/code&gt; process with &lt;code&gt;argc = 2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;argv = {"rm", "file", NULL}&lt;/code&gt;.  As &lt;code&gt;argv[0]&lt;/code&gt; is the name that processes appear under in &lt;code&gt;[[ps (Unix)|ps]]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[[top (Unix)|top]]&lt;/code&gt; etc., some programs, such as [[Daemon (computer software)|daemons]] or those running within an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] or [[virtual machine]] (where &lt;code&gt;argv[0]&lt;/code&gt; would be the name of the host executable), may choose to alter their argv to give a more descriptive &lt;code&gt;argv[0]&lt;/code&gt;, usually by means of the &lt;code&gt;[[Exec (operating system)|exec]]&lt;/code&gt; system call.

The &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; function is special; normally every C and C++ program must define it exactly once.

If declared, &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; must be declared as if it has external linkage; it cannot be declared &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt;.

In C++, &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; must be in the global [[namespace]] (i.e. &lt;code&gt;::main&lt;/code&gt;), cannot be overloaded, and cannot be a [[member function]], although the name is not otherwise reserved, and may be used for member functions, classes, enumerations, or non-member functions in other namespaces. In C++ (unlike C) &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; cannot be called [[Recursion (computer science)|recursively]] and cannot have its address taken.

===C#===
When executing a program written in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], the [[Common Language Runtime|CLR]] searches for a static method marked with the &lt;code&gt;.entrypoint&lt;/code&gt; IL directive, which takes either no arguments, or a single argument of type &lt;code&gt;string[]&lt;/code&gt;, and has a return type of &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, and executes it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/04/02/NETConsoleApps/ |title=Console Applications in .NET, or Teaching a New Dog Old Tricks |publisher=Msdn.microsoft.com |date=2003-06-12 |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="csharp"&gt;
static void Main();
static void Main(string[] args);
static int Main();
static int Main(string[] args);
&lt;/source&gt;

Command-line arguments are passed in &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt;, similar to how it is done in Java. For versions of &lt;code&gt;Main()&lt;/code&gt; returning an integer, similar to both C and C++, it is passed back to the environment as the exit status of the process.

Since C#7.1 there are four more possible signatures of the entry point, which allow asynchronous execution in the &lt;code&gt;Main()&lt;/code&gt; Method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/proposals/csharp-7.1/async-main.md}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="csharp"&gt;
static Task Main()
static Task&lt;int&gt; Main()
static Task Main(string[])
static Task&lt;int&gt; Main(string[])
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;Task&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Task&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; types are the asynchronous equivalents of &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;.

===Clean===
[[Clean (programming language)|Clean]] is a functional programming language based on graph rewriting. The initial node is called &lt;code&gt;Start&lt;/code&gt; and is of type &lt;code&gt;*World -&gt; *World&lt;/code&gt; if it ''changes'' the world or some fixed type if the program only prints the result after [[graph rewriting|reducing]] &lt;code&gt;Start&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
Start :: *World -&gt; *World
Start world = startIO ...
&lt;/source&gt;

Or even simpler

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
Start :: String
Start = "Hello, world!"
&lt;/source&gt;

One tells the compiler which option to use to generate the executable file.

===Common Lisp===
ANSI Common Lisp does not define a main function; instead, the code is read and evaluated from top to bottom in a source file. However, the following code will [[Emulator|emulate]] a main function.

&lt;source lang="lisp"&gt;
(defun hello-main ()
  (format t "Hello World!~%"))

(hello-main)
&lt;/source&gt;

===D===
In [[D (programming language)|D]], the [[function prototype]] of the main function looks like one of the following:

&lt;source lang="D"&gt;
void main();
void main(string[] args);
int main();
int main(string[] args);
&lt;/source&gt;

Command-line arguments are passed in &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt;, similar to how it is done in C# or Java. For versions of &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; returning an integer, similar to both C and C++, it is passed back to the environment as the exit status of the process.

===FORTRAN===
[[FORTRAN]] does not have a main subroutine or function. Instead a &lt;code&gt;PROGRAM&lt;/code&gt; statement as the first line can be used to specify that a program unit is a main program, as shown below. The &lt;code&gt;PROGRAM&lt;/code&gt; statement cannot be used for recursive calls.&lt;ref&gt;XL FORTRAN for [[AIX]]. Language Reference. Third Edition, 1994. [[IBM]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="fortran"&gt;
      PROGRAM HELLO
      PRINT *, "Cint!"
      END PROGRAM HELLO
&lt;/source&gt;

Some versions of Fortran, such as those on the [[IBM System/360]] and successor mainframes, do not support the PROGRAM statement. Many compilers from other software manufacturers will allow a fortran program to be compiled without a PROGRAM statement. In these cases, whatever module that has any non-comment statement where no SUBROUTINE, FUNCTION or BLOCK DATA statement occurs, is considered to be the Main program.

===GNAT===
Using [[GNAT]], the programmer is not required to write a function called &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;; a source file containing a single subprogram can be compiled to an executable. The binder will however create a package &lt;code&gt;ada_main&lt;/code&gt;, which will contain and export a C-style main function.

===Go===
In [[Go (programming language)|Go]] programming language, program execution starts with the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function of the &lt;code&gt;package main&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;source lang="go"&gt;
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
 fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
&lt;/source&gt;

There is no way to access arguments or a return code outside of the standard library in Go. These can be accessed via &lt;code&gt;os.Args&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;os.Exit&lt;/code&gt; respectively, both of which are included in the &lt;code&gt;"os"&lt;/code&gt; package.

===Haskell===
A [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] program must contain a name called &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; bound to a value of type &lt;code&gt;IO t&lt;/code&gt;, for some type &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/modules.html |title=The Haskell 98 Report: Modules |publisher=Haskell.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is usually &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; is a [[monads in functional programming|monad]], which organizes [[Side effect (computer science)|side-effects]] in terms of [[purely functional programming|purely functional]] code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geekrant.wordpress.com/2008/06/23/misconceptions/ Some Haskell Misconceptions: Idiomatic Code, Purity, Laziness, and IO] — on Haskell's monadic IO&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; value represents the side-effects-ful computation done by the program. The result of the computation represented by &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; is discarded; that is why &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; usually has type &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;, which indicates that the type of the result of the computation is &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;, the [[unit type]], which contains no information.

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello, World!"
&lt;/source&gt;

Command line arguments are not given to &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;; they must be fetched using another IO action, such as &lt;code&gt;[https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/libraries/base-4.11.1.0/System-Environment.html#v%3AgetArgs System.Environment.getArgs]&lt;/code&gt;.

===Java===
[[Java (programming language)|Java]] programs start executing at the main [[method (computer science)|method]], which has the following [[method heading]]:

&lt;source lang="java5"&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
public static void main(String... args)
public static void main(String args[])
&lt;/source&gt;

Command-line arguments are passed in &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt;. As in C and C++, the name "&lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt;" is special. Java's main methods do not return a value directly, but one can be passed by using the &lt;code&gt;System.exit()&lt;/code&gt; method.

Unlike C, the name of the program is not included in &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt;, because the name of the program is exactly the name of the class that contains the main method called, so it is already known. Also unlike C, the number of arguments need not be included, since arrays in Java have a field that keeps track of how many elements there are.

Another aspect unique to Java is that the main function must be included within a class, and then called manually by the runtime. This is because in Java everything has to be contained within a class. For instance, a [[hello world]] program in Java may look like so:

&lt;source lang="java5"&gt;
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

To run this program, one must call &lt;code&gt;java HelloWorld&lt;/code&gt; in the directory where the compiled [[Java class file|class file]] (which itself must be named &lt;code&gt;HelloWorld.class&lt;/code&gt;) exists. Alternatively, executable [[JAR (file format)|JAR]] files use a [[manifest file]] to specify the entry point in a manner that is filesystem-independent from the user's perspective.

===LOGO===
In [[Logo (programming language)|FMSLogo]], the procedures when loaded do not execute. To make them execute, it is necessary to use this code:

 to procname
  ...                 ; Startup commands (such as print [Welcome])
 end

 make "startup [procname]

Note that the variable &lt;code&gt;startup&lt;/code&gt; is used for the startup list of actions, but the convention is that this calls another procedure that runs the actions. That procedure may be of any name.

===OCaml===
[[OCaml]] has no &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function. Programs are evaluated from top to bottom.

Command-line arguments are available in an array named &lt;code&gt;Sys.argv&lt;/code&gt; and the exit status is 0 by default.

Example:
&lt;source lang="ocaml"&gt;

print_endline "Hello World"

&lt;/source&gt;

===Pascal===
In [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], the main procedure is the only unnamed procedure in the program. Because Pascal programs have the procedures and functions in a more rigorous top-down order than C, C++ or Java programs, the main procedure is usually the last procedure in the program. Pascal does not have a special meaning for the name "&lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;" or any similar name.

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
program Hello(Output);
begin
  writeln('Hello, world!');
end.
&lt;/source&gt;

Command-line arguments are counted in &lt;code&gt;ParamCount&lt;/code&gt; and accessible as strings by &lt;code&gt;ParamStr(n)&lt;/code&gt;, with n between 0 and &lt;code&gt;ParamCount&lt;/code&gt;.

Note that "unit" or "module" based versions of Pascal start the main module with the PROGRAM keyword, while other separately compiled modules start with UNIT (UCSD/Borland) or MODULE (ISO). The unnamed function in modules is often module initialization, and run before the main program starts.

===Perl===
In [[Perl]], there is no main function. Statements are executed from top to bottom.

Command-line arguments are available in the special array &lt;code&gt;@ARGV&lt;/code&gt;. Unlike C, &lt;code&gt;@ARGV&lt;/code&gt; does not contain the name of the program, which is &lt;code&gt;$0&lt;/code&gt;.

===PHP===
PHP does not have a "main" function. Starting from the first line of a PHP script, any code not encapsulated by a function header is executed as soon as it is seen.

===Pike===
In [[Pike (programming language)|Pike]] syntax is similar to that of C and C++.  The execution begins at &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;.  The "&lt;code&gt;argc&lt;/code&gt;" variable keeps the number of [[Parameter (computer science)|arguments]] passed to the program.  The "&lt;code&gt;argv&lt;/code&gt;" variable holds the value associated with the arguments passed to the program.

Example:
&lt;source lang="pike"&gt;
 int main(int argc, array(string) argv)
&lt;/source&gt;

===Python===
[[Python (programming language)|Python]] programs are evaluated top-to-bottom, as is usual in scripting languages: the entry point is the start of the source code. Since definitions must precede use, programs are typically structured with definitions at the top and the code to execute at the bottom (unindented), similar to code for a [[one-pass compiler]], such as in Pascal.

Alternatively, a program can be structured with an explicit &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function containing the code to be executed when a program is executed directly, but which can also be invoked by importing the program as a module and calling the function. This can be done by the following idiom, which relies on the internal variable &lt;code&gt;__name__&lt;/code&gt; being set to &lt;code&gt;__main__&lt;/code&gt; when a program is executed, but not when it is imported as a module (in which case it is instead set to the module name); there are many variants of this structure:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Python main() functions
|author=Ned Batchelder
|date=6 June 2003
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
import sys

def main(argv):
    n = int(argv[1])
    print(n + 1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.exit(main(sys.argv))
&lt;/source&gt;

In this idiom, the call to the named entry point &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; is explicit, and the interaction with the operating system (receiving the arguments, calling system exit) are done explicitly by library calls, which are ultimately handled by the Python runtime. This contrast with C, where these are done ''implicitly'' by the runtime, based on convention.

=== QB64 ===
The [[QB64]] language has no main function, the code that is not within a function, or subroutine is executed first, from top to bottom:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="vb"&gt;
print "Hello World! a =";
a = getInteger(1.8d): print a

function getInteger(n as double)
    getInteger = int(n)
end function
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Command line arguments (if any) can be read using the COMMAND$ function:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="vb"&gt;
dim shared commandline as string
commandline = COMMAND$

'Several space-separared command line arguments can be read using COMMAND$(n)
commandline1 = COMMAND$(2)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Ruby===
In [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], there is no distinct main function. The code written without additional "&lt;code&gt;class .. end&lt;/code&gt;", "&lt;code&gt;module .. end&lt;/code&gt;" enclosures is executed directly, step by step, in context of special "&lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;" object. This object can be referenced using:

&lt;source lang="irb"&gt;
irb(main):001:0&gt; self
=&gt; main
&lt;/source&gt;

and contain the following properties:

&lt;source lang="irb"&gt;
irb(main):002:0&gt; self.class
=&gt; Object
irb(main):003:0&gt; self.class.ancestors
=&gt; [Object, Kernel, BasicObject]
&lt;/source&gt;

Methods defined without additional classes/modules are defined as private methods of the "&lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;" object, and, consequently, as private methods of almost any other object in Ruby:

&lt;source lang="irb"&gt;
irb(main):004:0&gt; def foo
irb(main):005:1&gt;   42
irb(main):006:1&gt; end
=&gt; nil
irb(main):007:0&gt; foo
=&gt; 42
irb(main):008:0&gt; [].foo
NoMethodError: private method `foo' called for []:Array
	from (irb):8
	from /usr/bin/irb:12:in `&lt;main&gt;'
irb(main):009:0&gt; false.foo
NoMethodError: private method `foo' called for false:FalseClass
	from (irb):9
	from /usr/bin/irb:12:in `&lt;main&gt;'
&lt;/source&gt;

Number and values of command-line arguments can be determined using the single &lt;code&gt;ARGV&lt;/code&gt; constant array:

&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
$ irb /dev/tty foo bar

tty(main):001:0&gt; ARGV
ARGV
=&gt; ["foo", "bar"]
tty(main):002:0&gt; ARGV.size
ARGV.size
=&gt; 2
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that first element of &lt;code&gt;ARGV&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ARGV[0]&lt;/code&gt;, contains the first command-line argument, not the name of program executed, as in C. The name of program is available using &lt;code&gt;$0&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;$PROGRAM_NAME&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/rubyworld.html#UB Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide, Ruby and Its World] — on Ruby &lt;code&gt;ARGV&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to Python, one could use:

&lt;source lang="ruby"&gt;
if __FILE__ == $PROGRAM_NAME
  # Put "main" code here
end
&lt;/source&gt;

===Rust===
&lt;source lang="rust"&gt;
fn main() {
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Visual Basic===
In [[Visual Basic]], when a project contains no forms, the startup object may be the &lt;code&gt;Main()&lt;/code&gt; procedure. The &lt;code&gt;Command$&lt;/code&gt; function can be optionally used to access the argument portion of the command line used to launch the program:
&lt;source lang="vb"&gt;
Sub Main()
    Debug.Print "Hello World!"
    MsgBox "Arguments if any are: " &amp; Command$
End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

===Xojo===
In [[Xojo]], there are two different project types, each with a different main entry point. Desktop (GUI) applications start with the &lt;code&gt;App.Open&lt;/code&gt; event of the project's &lt;code&gt;Application&lt;/code&gt; object. Console applications start with the &lt;code&gt;App.Run&lt;/code&gt; event of the project's &lt;code&gt;ConsoleApplication&lt;/code&gt; object. In both instances, the main function is automatically generated, and cannot be removed from the project.

The '''Feminale''' in [[Cologne]] is [[Germany]]'s oldest [[feminism|feminist]] [[film festival]]. It has been held annually since 1984.

The Feminale was founded by students of [[film theory]] from the [[University of Cologne]]. Participating films must be made by females. They cover a broad spectrum of [[film genre]]s, including [[experimental film]]s and [[short film]]s.

The festival aims to voice the concerns of women in the [[film industry]]. It provides female [[director (film)|film makers]] with a platform for presenting their work to the public, and encourages presentation and discussion of changes in film [[aesthetics]] from a female point of view.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2605">[[File:Art hastividyarnava 2.jpg|thumb|A folio from the '''Hastividyarnava''' manuscript]]
The '''Hastividyārnava''', written by Sukumar Barkaith, is one of the best known illustrated manuscripts of [[Assam]].  Commissioned under the patronage of King [[Siva Singha]] (1713-1744 C.E.) and his queen consort [[Phuleswari]], it deals with the management and care of [[Indian elephant|elephants]] in the royal stables.&lt;ref name="Barkaith"&gt;Barkaith, S. (1734). ''Hastividyarnava.''  Edited with an introduction by P.C. Choudhury.  Guwahati: Publication Board, Assam.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hastividyārnava is a work that arose in a matrix of disciplined study, prolonged observation and a precedent tradition. The commission of such a treatise was perhaps considered important as the elephant played an important role in affirming the idea of monarchy and exercising state power.&lt;ref name=Barua&gt;Barua, M. (2005). The Elephant in Assamese History and Mythology. Kaziranga National Park Centenary Celebration Volume P. 34-39. Forest Department of Assam, Govt. of Assam.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
The treatise itself was written for a ruling monarch, and almost entirely from the view of sustaining [[monarchy]] – which elephants are suitable for the kingdom, how they should be trained for use by the nobility and for the purpose of war. The ''Hastividyārnava'' has an elaborate taxonomic system describing the various types of elephants and their character, and it was perhaps considered important for a king to have knowledge regarding elephants, as it is mentioned that only the learned king recognizes particular [[breed]]s.

== Artists ==
The two artists ''Dilbar'' and ''Dosai'' who painted the manuscript were probably not very familiar with the landscape of Assam and hence the quality of the landscapes are not of a very high standard.

== Current location and status ==
The manuscript is currently housed in the Department of Historical and Antiquarian Studies (DHAS) in Guwahati, Assam.  The ''Hastividyarnava'' should not be confused with the ''Hati-Puthi'' of ''Auniati Sattra'' (Majuli), which is a much later work (possibly of the early 19th century).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srimanta.net/manuscript%20painting2.htm srimanta.org]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lenox Globe (2) Britannica.png|thumb|right|The [[Lenox Globe]]&lt;ref&gt;As illustrated in the Encyclopædia Britannica, 9th edition, Volume X, 1874, Fig.2&lt;/ref&gt;]]
"'''Here be dragons'''" means dangerous or unexplored territories, in imitation of a medieval practice of putting illustrations of [[dragon]]s, [[Sea monster|sea-monster]]s and other mythological creatures on uncharted areas of maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-enchanting-sea-monsters-on-medieval-maps-1805646/ |title=The Enchanting Sea Monsters on Medieval Maps |last=Waters |first=Hannah |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |date=2013-10-15 |accessdate=2017-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Van Duzer |first1=Chet |title=Sea Monsters on Medieval and Renaissance Maps |publisher=British Library Publishing |year=2013 |isbn=978-0712357715 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=25%|align=right
|quote = As geographers, [[Quintus_Sosius_Senecio | Sosius]], crowd into the edges of their maps parts of the world which they do not know about, adding notes in the margin to the effect, that beyond this lies nothing but sandy deserts full of wild beasts, unapproachable bogs, [[Scythia]]n ice, or a frozen sea, so, in this work of mine, in which I have compared the lives of the greatest men with one another, after passing through those periods which probable reasoning can reach to and real history find a footing in, I might very well say of those that are farther off, beyond this there is nothing but prodigies and fictions, the only inhabitants are the poets and inventors of fables; there is no credit, or certainty any farther.

}}

Although several early maps, such as the ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'', have illustrations of mythological creatures for decoration, the phrase itself is an [[anachronism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Erin C. | last = Blake | year = 1999 | title = Where Be "Here be Dragons"? | work = MapHist Discussion Group | publisher =  | url = http://www.maphist.nl/extra/herebedragons.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are just two known historical uses of this phrase in the [[Latin]] form "HC SVNT DRACONES"&lt;!-- sic; don't replace HC by HIC --&gt; (i.e. ''hic sunt dracones,'' 'here are dragons'). One is on the [[Hunt–Lenox Globe]]{{Ref|lenox_globe}} (c. 1503–07), on which the term appeared around the east coast of Asia. This might be related to the [[Komodo dragon]]s on the Indonesian islands, tales of which were quite common throughout East Asia.{{Ref|mccarthy}} The other appearance of the term is on a globe engraved on two conjoined halves of ostrich eggs, dated to 1504.&lt;ref name=Wapo/&gt; Earlier maps contain a variety of references to [[legendary creature|mythical]] and real creatures, but the Lenox Globe and the egg globe are the only known surviving maps to bear this phrase. Furthermore, the two maps may be closely linked: an investigation of the egg globe performed by collector Stefaan Missinne concluded that the Hunt–Lenox Globe is in fact a cast of it.
"'Here be dragons,' [is] a very interesting sentence," said Thomas Sander, editor of the ''Portolan'', the journal of the Washington Map Society. "In early maps, you would see images of sea monsters; it was a way to say there's bad stuff out there."&lt;ref name=Wapo&gt;{{cite news|last=Kim|first=Meeri|title=Oldest globe to depict the New World may have been discovered|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/oldest-globe-to-depict-the-new-world-may-have-been-discovered/2013/08/19/503b2b4a-06b4-11e3-a07f-49ddc7417125_story.html?hpid=z1|accessdate=20 August 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical phrase used by ancient Roman and Medieval cartographers was ''HIC SVNT LEONES'' (literally, "here are [[lion]]s") when denoting unknown territories on maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Duzer|first=Chet|date=2014-06-04|title=Bring on the Monsters and Marvels: Non-Ptolemaic Legends on Manuscript Maps of Ptolemy’s Geography|url=http://www.brepolsonline.net/doi/10.1484/J.VIATOR.1.103923|journal=Viator|volume=45|issue=2|pages=303–334|doi=10.1484/J.VIATOR.1.103923|issn=0083-5897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dragons on maps ==
[[File:Psalter World Map, c.1265.jpg|thumb|The 1265 [[Psalter world map]]]]
Dragons appear on a few other historical maps:
* The [[T and O map|T-O]] [[Psalter world map]] ({{circa|1250}} AD) has dragons, as symbols of [[sin]], in a lower "frame" below the world, balancing [[Jesus]] and [[angel]]s on the top, but the dragons do not appear on the map proper.
* The [[Borgia map]] (c. 1430), in the Vatican Library, states, over a dragon-like figure in [[Asia]] (in the upper left quadrant of the map), "''Hic etiam homines magna cornua habentes longitudine quatuor pedum, et sunt etiam serpentes tante magnitudinis, ut unum bovem comedant integrum.''" ("Here there are even men who have large four-foot horns, and there are even serpents so large that they could eat an ox whole.").
* The [[Fra Mauro Map]] (c. 1450) has the "[[Island of Dragons]]" ({{lang-it|Isola de' dragoni}}), an imaginary island in the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Item 558 in: {{citation|title=Fra Mauro's World Map|authorlink=Piero Falchetta|first=Piero |last=Falchetta|publisher=Brepols |year=2006|isbn=2-503-51726-9|pages=294–295}}; also in [http://geoweb.venezia.sbn.it/cms/images/stories/Testi_HSL/FM_iscr.pdf the list online]&lt;/ref&gt;  In an inscription near [[Herat]], [[Fra Mauro]] says that in the mountains nearby "there are a number of dragons, in whose forehead is a stone that  cures many infirmities", and describes the locals' way of hunting those dragons to get the stones. This is thought to be based on [[Albertus Magnus]]'s treatise ''De mineralibus''.&lt;ref&gt;"In le montagne de la citade de [[Herat|here]] sono dragoni assai, i qual hano una piera in fronte virtuosa a molte infirmitade".  Item 1457 in {{harvnb|Falchetta|2006|pp=462–464}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an inscription elsewhere on the map, the cartographer expresses his skepticism regarding "serpents, dragons and [[basilisk]]s" mentioned by "some historiographers".&lt;ref&gt;Item 460 in {{harvnb|Falchetta|2006|pp=276–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 19th-century Japanese map, the ''[[:File:Jishinnoben1855.jpg|Jishin-no-ben]]'', in the shape of [[ouroboros]], depicts a dragon associated with causing earthquakes.

== Other creatures on maps ==
* [[Ptolemy]]'s atlas in ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' (originally 2nd century, taken up again in the 15th century) warns of [[elephant]]s, [[Hippopotamus|hippos]] and [[Cannibalism|cannibals]].
* ''[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]'' (medieval copy of Roman map) has "in his locis elephanti nascuntur", "in his locis scorpiones nascuntur" and "hic cenocephali nascuntur" ("in these places elephants are born, in these places [[scorpion]]s are born, here [[Cynocephaly|Cynocephali]] are born").
* [[Cotton MS. Tiberius]] B.V. fol. 58v (10th century), British Library Manuscript Collection, has "hic abundant leones" ("here lions abound"), along with a picture of a lion, near the east coast of Asia (at the top of the map towards the left); this map also has a text-only serpent reference in southernmost [[Africa]] (bottom left of the map): "Zugis regio ipsa est et Affrica. est enim fertilis. sed ulterior bestiis et serpentibus plena" ("This region of Zugis is in Africa; it is rather fertile, but on the other hand it is full of beasts and serpents.")
* The [[Ebstorf map]] (13th century) has a dragon in the extreme south-eastern part of Africa, together with an [[asp (reptile)|asp]] and a [[basilisk]].
* [[Giovanni Leardo]]'s map (1442) has, in southernmost Africa, "Dixerto dexabitado p. chaldo e p. serpent".
* [[Martin Waldseemüller]]'s Carta marina navigatoria (1516) has "an elephant-like creature in northernmost [[Norway]], accompanied by a legend explaining that this 'morsus' with two long and quadrangular teeth congregated there", i.e. a [[walrus]], which would have seemed monstrous at the time.
* Waldseemüller's Carta marina navigatoria (1522), revised by Laurentius Fries, has the morsus moved to the [[Davis Strait]].
* Bishop [[Olaus Magnus]]'s ''[[Carta Marina]]'' map of [[Scandinavia]] (1539) has many monsters in the northern sea, as well as a winged, bipedal, predatory land animal resembling a dragon in northern Lapland.
* On the maps surrounding [[imperialism]], up until the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885 and the discoveries made by [[David Livingstone|Livingstone]], elephants were drawn in as is shown by this excerpt from "On Poetry: a Rhapsody" by [[Jonathan Swift]]: "So geographers, in Afric maps, With savage pictures fill their gaps, And o'er uninhabitable downs, Place elephants for want of towns."

'''''Jonas''''', also known as '''''Jonas L.A.''''', &lt;!-- Do not change --&gt;is&lt;!-- to "was" as that is incorrect. Fiction continues to exist even after creation of new episodes stops.--&gt; a [[List of Disney Channel series|Disney Channel Original Series]] created by [[Michael Curtis (TV producer)|Michael Curtis]] and [[Roger S.

''Jonas'' is the first Disney Channel Original Series since ''[[Phil of the Future]]'' not to be shot on videotape in a [[multi-camera setup|multi-camera]] format, be filmed before a live studio audience, or use a [[laugh track]].&lt;ref name="takeontv"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20273041,00.html| title=The Jonas Brothers Take On TV| first = Lynette |last= Rice| publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|issue =1044/1045|page = 94|date=April 24, 2009 |accessdate=2009-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was the first on the network to premiere on a Saturday night, part of a deliberate strategy by Disney to open up the night to original programming.&lt;ref name="lajtracker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/05/review-jonas.html|title=Show Tracker|publisher=|accessdate=2014-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second season premiered on June 20, 2010 and ended on October 3, 2010. In November 2010, Disney Channel announced the series was canceled after two seasons.

==About==
Shortly after the Jonas Brothers guest starred on the ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' episode "[[Me and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas]]", development for a TV series and [[Disney Channel Original Movie]] called ''[[Camp Rock]]'' starring the Jonas Brothers began.

The original concept for the TV series was about the band playing concerts as a [[undercover|cover]] while working as government [[espionage|secret agents]] to save the world and was entitled ''Jonas'' (an [[acronym]] which stood for "Junior Operatives Networking as Spies"). At the same time, they tried to hide their double lives from their mother and Frankie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-jonas2-2009may02,0,4301397.story| title=Jonas| author=Robert Lloyd| publisher=LATimes.com|date=May 2, 2009 |accessdate=2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Stella, ignorant of the Jonas' double lives, dated each of the famous brothers without informing the others and reported the details in her [[teen magazine]] [[column]]. Said Staub, "So pretty much the entire show, it's all of us lying to each other, and kind of everything backfiring, and us getting caught in awkward situations."&lt;ref name="radiofreestaub" /&gt; She described the concept as, "like ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'' and a little of bit of ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (1996 TV series)|Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith]]''. There's going to be fun action sequences and still be a sitcom".&lt;ref name=radiofree /&gt;

The ''Jonas'' pilot was shot in 2007, but the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]] impeded progress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roanoke.com/extra/wb/151404 Roanoke.com] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120908133459/http://www.roanoke.com/extra/wb/151404 |date=September 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Disney Channel Asia aired it during the Sneak Peak 2008. Instead, Disney Channel filmed a mini [[reality show]], the 2008 [[List of Disney Channel Original Series#Disney Channel Short Shows|Disney Channel Original Short Series]] ''[[Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream]]'', which followed the Jonas Brothers on a concert tour and premiered May 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream | url=http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/tv/jonas-brothers-living-the-dream/EP01058570 | publisher=zap2it.com | accessdate=2009-05-17 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523082116/http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/tv/jonas-brothers-living-the-dream/EP01058570 | archive-date=May 23, 2009 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later on June 20, 2008, the Disney Channel Original Movie ''[[Camp Rock]]'', in which the brothers starred as the fictional band "Connect 3", debuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Jonas reality show: The episodes! | url=http://www.tigerbeatmag.com/dailydish/jonas-brothers/2008/05/13/jonas-reality-show-the-episodes/ | publisher=TigerBeatmag.com | date=May 13, 2008 | accessdate=2009-05-17 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612011315/http://www.tigerbeatmag.com/dailydish/jonas-brothers/2008/05/13/jonas-reality-show-the-episodes/ | archivedate=June 12, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jonas Brothers also released ''[[Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience]]'', a [[Disney Digital 3-D]] concert film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=44747|title=Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience|date=June 4, 2014|work=ComingSoon.net|accessdate=2014-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; "After this rush of releases, the Jonas Brothers became too popular to imagine them as anything but more dramatic versions of themselves," explained executive producer [[Michael Curtis (TV producer)|Michael Curtis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/tv/44149057.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O:DW3ckUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUUsZ|title=Television: Jonas Brothers channel inner Monkees|publisher=|accessdate=2014-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210203216/http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/tv/44149057.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O:DW3ckUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUUsZ|archive-date=December 10, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The spy concept was very big and very ambitious and it started to not feel quite right. As the band got bigger and bigger, doing a show that captured more of their real lives and trying to turn that into a more grounded, real version of what they might be doing became more interesting to do and more fun to do.".&lt;ref name="northjerseyjonas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.signonsandiego.com/stories/2009/may/01/lz1c01jonas185957-disney-backing-them-again-jonase/?&amp;zIndex=91703|title=Disney backing them up again; Jonases promoted into a sitcom|work=U-T San Diego|accessdate=2014-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It is now about us being a band and balancing a normal life," Nick Jonas told Access Hollywood.&lt;ref name="buddytv.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/jonas/jonas-brothers-hit-the-small-s-26154.aspx?pollid=3001630&amp;answer=3005551#poll3001630|title=Jonas Brothers Hit the Small Screen with J.O.N.A.S., SNL Appearance|publisher=|accessdate=2014-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the series changed from ''J.O.N.A.S.'' to ''JONAS'', dropping the acronym but remaining in all capitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-jonas2-2009may02,0,4301397.story|title='Jonas'|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2014-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producers have drawn connections between ''Jonas'' and productions by earlier bands. Show creator and producer [[Roger S. H. Schulman]] claims that "It's hard not to make parallel comparisons to [[The Beatles]] in 1962 and 1963 when you see the kind of response that the Jonas Brothers' fans have to them," and describes the 1964 ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and 1965 ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'' as "very much a template" for the series.&lt;ref name="northjerseyjonas"/&gt; Producers and critics have also compared the series to ''The Monkees'', a popular but short-lived mid-1960s television comedy also following a real life band. At the Television Critics Association winter press tour in January 2009, [[Gary Marsh]], entertainment president of Disney Channel Worldwide, described ''Jonas'' as a cross between ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'' and ''[[Flight of the Conchords (TV series)|Flight of the Conchords]]''.&lt;ref name="northjerseyjonas" /&gt; The ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' remarks that Joe Jonas parallels "goofy [[Micky Dolenz]]", Kevin Jonas "quirky [[Michael Nesmith]]", and Nick Jonas "dreamy [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]]".&lt;ref name="suntimespaige"&gt;{{cite news |title = Here they come, walkin'down the (same old) street |first = Paige |last = Wiser |newspaper = [[The Chicago Sun-Times]] |date = April 30, 2009 |page = 22 |accessdate = 2010-10-20 |url = http://blogs.suntimes.com/tv/2009/04/jonas_review_better_than_hanna.html &lt;!-- http://www.suntimes.com/lifestyles/wiser/1550662,CST-FTR-jonas30.article--&gt; |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090903215424/http://blogs.suntimes.com/tv/2009/04/jonas_review_better_than_hanna.html |archivedate = September 3, 2009 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jonas Brothers reportedly watched episodes of ''[[The Partridge Family]]'' and ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'' "for literally three days straight" for inspiration.&lt;ref name="buddytv.com"/&gt;

==Characters==
[[Image:Lucasjonas.jpg|thumb|250px|Cast of ''Jonas L.A.'']]

===Main===
* Joseph "Joe" Lucas ([[Joe Jonas]])&lt;ref name=repetida_1 /&gt; – Joe is known as the teen heartthrob of the group. He performs lead vocals, as well as keyboards and the rhythm guitar for the brothers' band, JONAS. Girl crazy and flirtatious, Joe will go to any length to get a girl to like him. He is shown to be the most superficial and appearance oriented member of the band, and is obsessed with his hair. Joe tends to be goofier than Nick, but is not quite as quirky as Kevin. Joe likes stuffed animals that make noises. His pockets and backpack are [[hammerspace|seemingly bottomless]] and capable of holding comically large quantities. He always carries a blue panda pencil with him. Joe and Stella – the brothers' childhood friend and band's stylist – are shown to have mutual romantic feelings for one another from the beginning, but both agree that they will not go out, as a potential break-up could ruin both their longtime friendship and working relationship. However, this agreement does nothing to quash Joe's crush on Stella, and he often flirts with her and tries to spend as much time with her as possible. Near the end of season 1, in the episode "Double Date", Joe and Stella kiss, resolving their romantic tension. They soon decide to become a couple. When the brothers move to Los Angeles, Joe decides to spend his time exploring a career in acting and the film industry. He lands a role in a movie with famous actress Vanessa Page. In the first episode of season 2, "House Party", Stella witnesses Joe hugging Vanessa, which hurts her and leads to her telling Joe that she'd rather they stay friends. Following the breakup, Joe becomes very jealous when Ben asks Stella out and she accepts. Joe then decides to pursue Vanessa. With Stella dating Ben and Joe dating Vanessa, they still have feelings for one another – however, both parties are oblivious to this fact. Joe eventually breaks up with Vanessa after discovering that she dislikes Stella, whom he loves. At the end of the series, he and Stella reunite as a couple, after they both finally become aware of their feelings.
* Kevin Percy Lucas ([[Kevin Jonas]])&lt;ref name=repetida_1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.disneychannelmedianet.com/web/showpage/showpage.aspx?program_id=3118744&amp;type=lead |title=Disney Channel Medianet |publisher=Disney Channel Medianet |accessdate=2010-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123022106/http://www.disneychannelmedianet.com/web/showpage/showpage.aspx?program_id=3118744&amp;type=lead |archive-date=November 23, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; – Kevin is the oldest of the brothers, and is usually seen as wild and goofy. Kevin is known to think outside of the box, and likes to imagine wacky animals, such as an otter that can play the trumpet and a bear in a bikini. Kevin often comes up with plans that are insane or impossible, which can make him look naïve and unintelligent. However, he shows glimpses of profound thoughts and intellect, and sometimes comes up with genuinely good ideas. Kevin is shown to be very honest, as he's a poor liar; when he lies, his voice becomes comically high-pitched. He owns a full moving rack of guitars, and likes woodland creature stuffed animals. He plays lead guitar and does backup vocals in the brothers' band JONAS, though he once performed lead vocals. He had a crush on a girl that he met in [[Scandinavia]] and, when that romance didn't work out, fell for another girl from [[France]], which suggests that he has an affinity for foreign girls. He is more of a risk taker than his brothers. Despite sometimes having a bit of a rivalry (like when they're both vying to get a spot in [[Justin Timberlake]]'s ping-pong tournament), Nick and Kevin are very close. He also enjoys filmmaking, which is shown in "Direct to Video", where Kevin very much wants to direct the band's new music video. His middle name, Percy, is revealed by Joe in the series finale.
* Nicholas "Nick" Lucas ([[Nick Jonas]])&lt;ref name=repetida_1 /&gt; – Nick is portrayed as being the calm and collected member of the band. He has many short-lived relationships, and his family has criticized him for falling in love too fast. Nick is much more serious than his brothers, sometimes losing his patience with Kevin's silly antics. Nick likes stuffed animals that swim. Nick is the drummer for JONAS. When he was a baby, according to his family, he never smiled – Nick claims he was waiting for his teeth to come in (however, when Joe asks what his excuse is now, he does not have a response). Nick is also the mastermind of creative plans gone awry, and can keep a level head amid chaos. He is also seen baking many times in the show; Kevin is unable to resist his blue cookies. In season 2, he develops a relationship with Macy Misa, being smitten by her transformation into a different and more relaxed person who no longer acts like a rabid fangirl to the band. His moments with Macy tend to get interrupted by DZ, to humorous effect. In "The Secret", Nick is forced to watch over Big Man's niece, Kiara ([[China Anne McClain]]), who is aware that he and Macy are dating. In exchange for her silence about their relationship, Nick begrudgingly agrees to do a collaboration with her. He ends up telling the rest of the friends about his relationship through the song that he and Kiara made. Nick is seen to be very thoughtful, and makes a handmade mug for Macy for their one-month anniversary, after learning from Kevin that she likes homemade gifts.
* Stella Malone ([[Chelsea Kane Staub]])&lt;ref name=repetida_1 /&gt; – Stella is Jonas's stylist. She is best friends with Macy and is the brothers' childhood friend – she has known the boys since she was three. Stella and Joe both know that they like one another, but don't date, as they don't want a potential breakup to ruin their friendship. However, she gets jealous if she sees Joe with another girl, which was shown when she thought Joe and Macy were dating. Stella created an automated outfit selector called the StellaVator, and is constantly trying to adapt clothes to Jonas's hectic lifestyle. She gets annoyed when her outfits get ruined, which happens a lot more than she'd like. She is addicted to texting, and always has her phone on her. Stella also tries her best to help Macy talk to Jonas normally, instead of like an obsessed fangirl. Unlike her best friend Macy, who is a great athlete, Stella is horrible at sports. She is, however, an excellent seamstress, and once created a dozen girls' volleyball uniforms with very little notice. In the episode "Double Date", Joe and Stella kiss, and soon become a couple. However, at the beginning of season 2, she sees Joe hugging Vanessa Page, and assumes that they are romantically involved. The incident with Vanessa makes her decide that she only wants to be friends with Joe, rather than be in a relationship. While hiking with Macy, she meets a boy named Ben, whom she goes out with, much to Joe's disappointment. In the episode "America's Sweethearts", Stella is jealous when Joe's producer asks him to kiss Vanessa. After Joe says that he likes Vanessa, she lies to him, saying that Vanessa doesn't like him back. Stella feels guilty, and admits that she lied. Joe and Vanessa date, and Stella tries her best to not be jealous and spends time with Ben. Neither Joe nor Stella have lost their feelings for one another, however, after Vanessa tells Joe that she doesn't like Stella, Joe breaks up with her. After finally realizing that they both love one another, Stella and Joe become a couple in the series finale.
* Macy Misa ([[Nicole Gale Anderson|Nicole Anderson]])&lt;ref name=repetida_1 /&gt; – Macy is Stella's best friend, as well as the president of JONAS's fan club. In season 1, whenever she approaches the members of Jonas, she becomes incredibly nervous and excited, and either faints or accidentally injures them. She commonly steps on the boys' feet, or hits them in the head with her sports equipment. She often refers to each boy as "(first name) of JONAS." When she dates a boy, Randolph, she tries to make him into a JONAS member, even calling the boy "Nick" as a "nickname". Macy is very athletic, and plays on a number of sports teams. She also works in her mother's thrift store, called Misa's Pieces. Macy is revealed to be [[Tone deafness|tone deaf]], so much so that, according to Stella, they once called [[Animal Control]] under the belief that Macy's singing was an injured [[manatee]] at a softball game. Macy's obsessed fangirl attitude about Jonas changes into a real friendship with the boys late in season 1, as she begins to see them as people rather than popstars. In the episode "Frantic Romantic", she and Stella attend a Hollywood Private Party with the boys. In season 2, Macy is shown to have greatly changed, no longer being a crazy fan. This different attitude and the appearance of her real personality intrigues Nick, who eventually falls for her. Her moments with Nick tend to get interrupted by DZ, to a comical effect. In the episode "The Secret", it officially shows that Macy and Nick are dating – however, they want to keep their relationship a secret. It is revealed in a later episode that she has many brothers, and they are a big golfing family. It is also revealed that her mother taught her to play golf and her family only gives handmade gifts. Nick tries to please Macy by making her a mug for their one-month anniversary. Nick and Macy's relationship is eventually revealed, and by the end of the series, they are openly dating and happy with each other.
*Thomas “Tom” Lucas ([[John Ducey]]; main, season 1; guest, season 2) – Joe, Nick, Kevin, and Frankie's father, as well as the manager of Jonas. He is sometimes the voice of reason when his boys have crushes on girls. In his downtime, he often plays hide and seek with Frankie. He is usually nervous when famous people interview the band. It is also shown that he likes woodland creature stuffed animals that can swim and make noises, which are combinations of his son's favorite toys. He is a main character in season 1. In season 2, he appears as a guest in one episode.

===Recurring===
* Frankie Lucas  ([[Frankie Jonas]]) – Frankie is the youngest Lucas brother. He is constantly trying to get in the Jonas spotlight. Frankie hopes to get a chance to perform with the band, but his brothers don't think that is likely. Frankie can move very fast, and is an expert at hide-and-seek. He's also very skilled in getting his way. He was raised in New Jersey, and enjoys playing ping-pong. He has a crush on Macy, and was briefly mad at Nick for dating her, even going to lengths to try and "steal" her.
* Big Man ([[Robert Feggans|Robert "Big Rob" Feggans]]) – He is the bodyguard who escorts the band everywhere. He is seen to live with the boys in L.A. He has a niece, Kiara.

'''Season 1'''
* Sandy Lucas ([[Rebecca Creskoff]]) – She is the mother of Kevin, Joe, Nick, and Frankie, and is Tom's wife. She's down to earth and always proud of her sons, despite their mistakes. Mrs. Lucas just wants to have a normal family, but has acknowledged that it may not be possible with famous children. She is mostly an off-screen character.
* Van Dyke Tosh ([[Chuck Hittinger]]) – He is Stella's occasional love interest, who habitually makes Joe jealous. Van Dyke asks Stella on a date in the episode "Double Date", which causes Joe to crash their date.
* Mrs. Snark (Tangelina Rouse) – The biology/drama teacher who loves Joe, Nick, and Kevin. Much to Joe's chagrin, she often gives them preferential treatment in school, sometimes causing tension between the boys and other students. Her niece is a huge Jonas fan.

'''Season 2'''
* Dennis Zimmer "DZ" ([[Adam Hicks]]) – A new friend who the band meets while in L.A. He is the son of a very wealthy and successful record producer. He shows the band the "hot spots" in Los Angeles. He is very fun and outgoing. He is also an aspiring rapper, and tries to get his father to listen to his songs but can never get the chance.
* Vanessa Paige ([[Abby Pivaronas]]) – A popular actress who co-stars with Joe in a big-time film, "Forever April". She is also briefly his girlfriend on the show, until he breaks up with her because she dislikes Stella.
* Lisa Malone (Beth Crosby) – Stella's aunt who Stella and Macy stay with while residing in Los Angeles. She doesn't want them to date rock stars, as she made the mistake of dating rock stars twelve times. She appears in nearly all of the episodes in season 2, despite not being a main character.
* Mona Klein ([[Debi Mazar]]) – The director of "Forever April". In "Up in the Air", after Joe and Vanessa break up, Mona gives some advice to Joe, saying "when you find something real, never let it go".
* Kiara Tyshanna ([[China Anne McClain]]) – The niece of Big Man. She is the first one to find out about Nick and Macy dating.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
''Jonas'' received mixed to negative reviews for its premiere. Ken Tucker of ''Entertainment Weekly'' called the show "''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'' for [[Generation Y|millennials]]" and enjoyed the featured Jonas Brothers music. [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] magazine reviewer Brian Lowry believed that Jonas Brothers' adorers would be pleased with the result, and that those who are not fans would still find an amiable charm within the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117940160.html |title = Jonas |first = Brian|last = Lowry|date = May 1, 2009|accessdate=2010-10-20|newspaper = Daily Variety Gotham}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paige Wiser of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' found the series better than ''Hannah Montana'', but commented that Nick Jonas's reserved nature made him the weak link of the premiere episode and that the boys' amateur acting is "endearing until they play a scene opposite someone with real comedic timing – like [[John Ducey]]."&lt;ref name="suntimespaige"/&gt; ''The New York Times''' John Carmanica was also disappointed with Nick's performance, particularly because, according to Carmanica, he gives off the savviest air in the band's off screen life. Carmanica also criticizes the series' script as blithe, unfunny, and "seeded with profound cynicism", but praised the believable fraternal interactions and Kevin Jonas's acting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | title = The Private Lives of Pop Stars, Male Division| first = Jon | last = Caramanica | department = The Arts/Cultural Desk; SECTC | page = 3 | date = May 2, 2009 | accessdate=2010-10-20 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/02/arts/television/02jona.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viewer reception ===
The series was the first series on Disney Channel to premiere on a Saturday night, part of a deliberate strategy by Disney to open up the night to original programming and compete with Nickelodeon's traditional dominance of the evening.&lt;ref name="lajtracker" /&gt; The show was paired with the established series ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place]]'', which moved from a Sunday early evening timeslot, in the 8 p.m. (Eastern Time) slot. The series debuted on Disney Channel on May 2, 2009,&lt;ref name="Margaret Lyons"/&gt; and drew a solid 4.00&amp;nbsp;million viewers in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Multichannel News]] | title = 'Jonas' Sounds Solid Start For Disney Channel| first = Mike | last = Reynolds | edition = | page = | volume = | date = May 4, 2009 | accessdate=2010-10-20 | url = http://www.multichannel.com/article/231342-_Jonas_Sounds_Solid_Start_For_Disney_Channel.php }}&lt;/ref&gt; 73% of which was female. While this amounted to Disney Channel's best ratings in the time slot in eight months,&lt;ref name="lajtracker"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/05/jonas-brothers.html?xid=rss-breakingnews-The%20Jonas%20Brothers%E2%8099%20new%20song:%20Like,%20OMG,%20you%20guys,%20it%20kind%20of%20rocks?! EW.com] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was also Disney Channel's second-lowest rated live-action series premiere in nearly four years.&lt;ref name="nysecond"&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | title = Boy Band Is Starting To Feel The Heat| first = Brooks | last = Barnes | department = The Arts/Cultural Desk; SECTC | page = 1 | date = May 25, 2009 | accessdate=2010-10-20 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/25/arts/music/25jonas.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' comments that "Jonas didn't do poorly, exactly. [...] It's just that one expects the premiere of a show by a heavily promoted major Disney brand like the Jonas Brothers to make a bigger splash."&lt;ref name="nojpop"/&gt;

Viewership for the series second episode the following week fell sharply to nearly half its premiere audience—2.2&amp;nbsp;million total U.S. viewers and beyond cable's Top 100, which [[E!: Entertainment Television]] notes "in the grand scheme of things, is still a very good showing - unless you're trying to live up to the media's expectations for a world famous act." E! credits the decline to the premiere of Nickelodeon's hour-long ''[[iCarly]]'' special, "iDate a Bad Boy", which earned 6.5&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref name="ejonasflop"&gt;[http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b123505_are_jonas_brothers_overhellipagain.html Are the Jonas Brothers Over…Again?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516022823/http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b123505_are_jonas_brothers_overhellipagain.html |date=May 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratings improved over the following episodes, and the ''New York Times'' reported, "If "Jonas" can dent ratings for ''iCarly'' […] the brothers’ sitcom will be considered a big success internally.&lt;ref name="nysecond" /&gt; However, just weeks after its premiere Disney Channel moved ''Jonas'' and ''Wizards of Waverly Place'' to Sunday and Friday evenings, respectively, and began airing movies in its old timeslot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = [[New York Daily News]] | title = Inner Tube| first = | last = | department = Television | page = 76 | date = May 28, 2009 | accessdate=2010-10-20 | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/05/28/2009-05-28_untitled__inn28tv.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its Sunday timeslot, ''Jonas'' has been doing well in key kids demographics and averaging 3.4 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3iec91181b3bb41981421b109961a1dfca ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110055425/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3iec91181b3bb41981421b109961a1dfca |date=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the move to Sundays and Fridays and declining ratings, along with the change in setting and ill-fated strategies in promoting the show would result in Disney's decision to pull the plug on "Jonas L.A." On November 8, 2010, it announced that the show will not return for a third season. In a statement from a Disney Channel spokesperson: "We've been fortunate to work with the enormously talented Jonas Brothers on several projects, including the Emmy-nominated series JONAS L.A.," adding that "We look forward to working with them on new projects in the future."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/News/Disney-Cancels-JONAS-1025220.aspx "Disney Channel Cancels JONAS L.A."] from [[TV Guide]] (November 8, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy''''' ({{lang-fr|L'Espion Turc}}) is an eight-volume collection of fictional letters claiming to have been written by an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] spy named "Mahmut",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/books/review/2007/01/25/stuart/|title=Herbivore vs. carnivore|first=Laura|last=Miller|date=2007-01-25|publisher=[[Salon.com]]|accessdate=2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the French court of [[Louis XIV]].

==Authorship and publication==
[[File:Giovanni-Paolo-Marana-Espion-turc MG 9430.tif|thumb|Tome 4. Portrait of Mahomet "The impostor"]]

It is agreed that the first volume of this work was written by [[Giovanni Paolo Marana]] (1642-1693), a [[Genoa|Genoese]] political refugee to the French court of [[Louis XIV]].&lt;ref&gt;Paula R. Backscheider, Catherine Ingrassia, 2005, ''A companion to the eighteenth-century English novel and culture'', page 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ballaster207"&gt;Rosalind Ballaster, 2005, ''Fables of the East: selected tales, 1662-1785'',  page 207&lt;/ref&gt; The first volume (102 letters) was published in several parts between 1684 and 1686 in both Italian and in a French translation.&lt;ref name="Betts"&gt;C. J. Betts, 1984, ''Early deism in France'', pages 97-8&lt;/ref&gt; They were translated by [[William Bradshaw (writer)|William Bradshaw]] into English in 1687 under the supervision of [[Robert Midgley]] who owned the copyright of the work.&lt;ref name="Ballaster207"/&gt; The remaining seven volumes appeared first in English between 1691 and 1694, prefaced with a letter claiming that they were translated from a discovered Italian manuscript.&lt;ref name="Ballaster207"/&gt; A French edition of the last seven volumes (with the first) was published in 1696-7 and asserting that it was a translation from the English.&lt;ref name="Ballaster208"&gt;Rosalind Ballaster, 2005, ''Fables of the East: selected tales, 1662-1785'', page 208&lt;/ref&gt; The eight volumes contain 644 letters.&lt;ref name="Betts"/&gt;

There has long been a controversy as to the authorship of the volumes subsequent to Marana's first. They have been attributed to many writers, most notably Robert Midgley and William Bradshaw who produced the English translation.&lt;ref name="Ballaster208"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Backscheider58"&gt;Paula R. Backscheider, Catherine Ingrassia, 2005, ''A companion to the eighteenth-century English novel and culture'', page 58&lt;/ref&gt; However, given the similarities between the letters, and the stylistic coherence of the whole series, the likeliest author is Marana himself.&lt;ref name="Betts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosalind Ballaster 2005, page 145"&gt;Rosalind Ballaster, 2005, ''Fabulous orients: fictions of the East in England, 1662-1785'', page 145&lt;/ref&gt; Marana may have had difficulty in getting the later volumes published in France and turned to England to secure their continuing appearance.&lt;ref name="Ballaster208"/&gt;

The work was popular throughout the 18th century and went through fifteen complete editions by 1801.&lt;ref name="Ballaster208"/&gt; [[Daniel Defoe]] was attracted to the deist rationalist sympathies of the purported spy; his ''Continuation of Turkish Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy in Paris'' (1718) extended the narrator's account from 1687 to 1693.&lt;ref name="Rosalind Ballaster 2005, page 145"/&gt;

==Content==
The volumes contain fictional letters written by one "Mahmut the Arabian."&lt;ref&gt;Paula R. Backscheider, Catherine Ingrassia, 2005, ''A companion to the eighteenth-century English novel and culture'', page 56&lt;/ref&gt; The letters cover the period of 1637 to 1682 in France, from the last years of the Regency of [[Anne of Austria]] and [[Cardinal Richelieu]] through the long reign of Louis XIV and his minister [[Cardinal Mazarin]].&lt;ref name="Ballaster208"/&gt; The Letters form a rambling journal of gossip on current politics and satire on society.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Pike Conant, 2009, ''The Oriental Tale in England in the Eighteenth Century'', page 158&lt;/ref&gt; Mahmut sends reports from [[Paris]] to [[Constantinople]] on politics and current events in France, but corresponds privately on other subjects including religion, and adds stories and anecdotes for diversion.&lt;ref name="Betts"/&gt; His observations range from those on political figures such as Richelieu and Mazarin to speculations on the status of women, advice about state policy, and major interventions in controversies about religious doctrine and their consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Paula R. Backscheider, Catherine Ingrassia, 2005, ''A companion to the eighteenth-century English novel and culture'', page 61&lt;/ref&gt; His political position in the letters changes from that of liberal [[Catholic]] to that of a rationalistic [[Deism|Deist]].&lt;ref name="Backscheider58"/&gt;

By a lot of people, the term '''[[Brick Gothic]]''' is used for what more specifically is called  '''Baltic Brick Gothic''' or '''North German Brick Gothic'''. That part of [[Gothic architecture]], widespread in [[Northern Germany]], [[Denmark]], [[Poland]] and the [[Baltic states]], is commonly identified with the sphere of influence of the [[Hanseatic League]]. But there is a continuous mega-region of Gothic brick architecture, or '''Brick Gothic''' in a sense based on the facts, from the [[Strait of Dover]] to [[Finland]] and [[Lake Peipus]] and to the Sub[[Carpathian Mountains|carpathian]] region of southeastern [[Poland]] and southwestern [[Ukraine]].

Out of northern Germany and the Baltic region, the term "Brick Gothic" is adequately applied as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://inventaris.onroerenderfgoed.be/erfgoedobjecten/31213 Official Flemish portal on architectural heritage – on churches in Poperinge, "Baksteengotiek van de kuststreek" (Brick Gothic of the coastal region) in Flanders]&lt;br /&gt;[https://cultureelerfgoed.nl/monumenten/25809 Official Dutch portal on architectural heritage – on a village church, "markant stuk baksteengotiek" (striking example of Brick Gothic) in the Netherlands]&lt;br /&gt;[https://www.schnell-und-steiner.de/artikel_6467.ahtml Book on a Bavarian brick church "eines der bedeutendsten Werke der Backsteingotik in Bayern" (one of the most important works of Brick Gothic in Bavaria)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The region around the Baltic Sea, including Northern Germany, has some typical characteristics, but there are also regional and social differences, such as between the churches of medieval big cities and those of the neighbouring villages. On the other hand, a significant number of Gothic brick buildings erected near the Baltic Sea could also have been built in the [[Netherlands]] or in [[Flanders]], and vice versa.

Furthermore, Gothic brick structures have also been erected in other regions, such as northern Italy, southwestern and central France, and in the [[Danube|Danubian]] area of southern Germany. The particular architectural styles of some regions differ very much from the others, these are Italian Gothic (with [[Lombard Gothic]], [[Venice|Venetian]] Gothic and [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] Gothic), French [[Gothique Méridional]]. Quite late began the medieval use of brick in England, with the [[Tudor Style]].

The true extent of northern  Brick Gothic and  other Gothic brick architecture is shown by this almost complete list.

This list will never be complete. But it aims to be almost complete to give an unbiased survey as well on the variance as on the geography of Gothic brick buildings.

The dates given here refer to the present extant Gothic structures. Predecessors or post-Gothic alterations are not normally mentioned, but can be assessed by following up the literature. The most influential structures are indicated by bold print. Romanesque and Renaissance structures are not listed. Gothic Brick structures from outside the Baltic or North German regions, e.g. the [[Danube|Danubian]] ones, are also included, while [[Neogothic]] edifices are not listed.

Most of the Gothic brick architecture in Belgium can be found in [[West Flanders]], some in a narrow strip along the border with the Netherlands. Many Gothic brick churches in the Province of [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]] have been lost in the 19th century, as they were displaced by Gothic Revival churches.

''See [[List of Gothic brick buildings in Germany]]''

===[[Hungary]]===
– In Hungary, there is much more hidden than visible medieval brick. During the 145 years of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation, many churches fell in ruins. At about 1700 they were restored, inclusively of plastering, which need not necessary have existed before. In ruins of the Turkish wars and of World War II, brick can be visible, though these buildings had been plastered in their time of function. –

Though brick generally is not typical for medieval Swiss architecture, there are also some Gothic brick buildings in Switzerland, and some more have disappeared.

The [[Hero System]] (or HERO System) is a [[generic role-playing game system]] that developed from the [[superhero]] [[Role-playing game|RPG]] [[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]. This page lists all the products published for use with this role-playing system.

==Product Types==

Publishers and gamers classify HERO System products into a few types of books:

* '''Rulebook:'''  Provides some version of the HERO System rules engine.
* '''Rules Supplement:'''  Provides new or optional rules (for the game system as a whole, or a particular setting), but not the core rules engine itself.
* '''Genre Book:''' Covers creating and running games in a particular genre using the HERO System.
* '''Subgenre Book: ''' Like a Genre Book, but focusing on a narrower segment of the full genre.
* '''Campaign Setting:'''  Describes a fictional world and/or provides parameters for a campaign.
* '''Setting Expansion:''' Offers more detail on an existing Campaign Setting, such as detailing a single city or country within a larger fictional world.
* '''Creature Book:''' Describes general monsters, animals, or similar classes of characters. For example, it might include "demons" or "vampires," but not a ''specific'' demon or vampire.
* '''Enemies Book:''' Details ''specific'' adversaries for use in adventures (villains &amp; villain teams, individually named monsters and antagonists, etc.).
* '''Characters Book:''' Contains specific characters (like an Enemies Book), but not necessarily adversaries (allies, supporting characters, etc.).
* '''Organization Book:''' Details the structure and workings of one or more organizations (companies, agencies, criminal empires, and so on).
* '''Adventure Book:''' Outlines one or more pre-prepared adventure scenarios.
* '''Powers Book:''' Offers pre-defined powers, spells, or the like.
* '''Equipment Book:''' Details pre-defined gear of one or more kinds. 
* '''Playing Aid:''' Game-assistance material such as [[GM screen]]s.

==HERO System Genres==

Players typically refer to various story genres by the name of the HERO System genre book most prominently or most recently associated with it as follows:

* '''[[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]:''' Comic-book style superheroes.  This is the genre most closely associated with the HERO System, and was also the title of the first HERO System game in 1981.  Many players call the game system itself by the name "Champions," or consider that name interchangeable with the term "HERO System."
* '''Fantasy Hero:''' Fantasy adventure typically featuring wizards, swordsmen, kings, quests, dragons, prophecies, and so on.
* '''Star Hero:''' Science-Fiction and other futuristic settings.
* '''Pulp Hero:''' Action-Adventure in the style of the 1920s-1930s pulp adventure magazines (flying aces, daring archaeologists, Nazis, masked men, gangsters, mad scientists, and so on).
* '''Dark Champions:''' Modern-day Action Adventure such as non-superpowered vigilantes, military or law enforcement, international espionage, etc.
* '''Horror Hero:''' Stories played for fright, usually featuring normal people facing (or fleeing) supernatural evil or other Things Man Was Not Meant To Know.
* '''Ninja Hero:''' Martial Arts adventure in the vein of wuxia cinema and similar tales.
* '''Cyber Hero:''' Near-future (often dystopian) stories typically spotlighting the convergence of humanity and technology.
* '''Post-Apocalyptic Hero:''' Adventure in worlds after the fall of an earlier civilization.
* '''Western Hero:''' Sixguns and sheriffs in the American Wild West.
* '''[[Robot Warriors]]:''' Anime-style Mecha adventure.
* '''The Widening Gyre:''' Steampunk adventure.

This incomplete '''list of art critics''' enumerates persons who had or have a significant part of their known creative output in the form of [[art criticism]], which consists mostly of the written discussion and aesthetic evaluation of [[Work of art|works of art]].&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;
{{Compact ToC|seealso=yes|q=}}

==Scope==
{{main|Art critic}}
There is no official list of [[art critic]]s, the compilation of which is compounded by problems in defining [[art criticism]] – not least of which is the overlap with [[art history]],&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; and [[Aesthetics|philosophy of art]]. Herein will be included those [[authors]] that are mentioned as being art critics or producing art criticism in works of reference, as are encyclopedias, dictionaries or scholarly reviews.

According to one authority, art criticism, in a close approximation to the current sociocultural framework of the activity, started in the [[18th century CE]] in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; However, many authors living before that time and outside that region of the world wrote on the subject of art and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic experience]], though using [[Philosophy of art|terms and concepts]] that may not have a direct translation into the lexicon of the [[Western culture|Western]] tradition.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; These, when mentioned, will be included as well though pertinently noted.

[[File:Nobel2008Literature news conference1.jpg|thumb|right|Announcement of the Laureate of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], one of the world's richest literary prizes, at the Swedish Academy in Stockholm (2008)]]
Many [[literary awards]] attract a significant remuneration as part of their prize.  This is a list of active literary awards from around the world with remunerations valued at least {{currency|100,000}} or equivalent.

== Inclusion criteria ==
*The award is active and is primarily focused on writing and the arts.
*The remuneration is equal to or greater than US$100,000 or equivalent. Because fluctuating [[exchange rate]]s move non-US dollar denominated awards in and out of the list over time, awards near this amount are also included.
*The award is for any genre of writing (fiction, journalism, etc.) or award type (book or author).
*The listed remuneration is for a single winner or co-winners. The list does not aggregate the total value of runners-up and other prizes within the same award. For example, the [[Prime Minister's Literary Awards]] is listed as [[Australian dollar|A$]]100,000 even though it is composed of four prizes totaling A$400,000.

The following is a list of the first known appearances of various [[superhero]] [[fictional characters]] and teams.

A superhero (also known as a "super hero" or "super-hero") is a [[fictional character]] "of unprecedented physical prowess dedicated to acts of derring-do in the public interest."&lt;ref&gt;''National Periodical Publications v. Empire Comics'', [[New York Court of Appeals]], April 21, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the debut of Superman in 1938 by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, stories of superheroes — ranging from brief episodic adventures to continuing years-long sagas — have dominated [[American comic book]]s and crossed over into other [[mass media|media]]. A [[female]] superhero is sometimes called a "superheroine."

By most definitions, characters need not have actual superhuman powers to be deemed superheroes, although sometimes terms such as "costumed crimefighters"&lt;ref&gt;Per [http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2006/mar/17/v_vendetta_s_subversive/?arts ''Lawrence Journal-World'' (March 17, 2006): "'V for Vendetta' is S for Subversive", by Jon Niccum],  [http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/00/04710246/0471024600.pdf "The Dark Knight: Batman &amp;mdash; A NonSuper Superhero"], [http://uk.videogames.games.yahoo.com/ps2/previews/batman-begins-2bae56.html GameSpot: PS2 Games: ''Batman Begins''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625170802/http://uk.videogames.games.yahoo.com/ps2/previews/batman-begins-2bae56.html |date=2007-06-25 }}, [http://members.fortunecity.com/srca1943/SpotlightComicsAnnual2.html ''Spotlight Comics Annual'' #2 (May 2002)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619133829/http://members.fortunecity.com/srca1943/SpotlightComicsAnnual2.html |date=2008-06-19 }}; [http://www.adherents.com/lit/comics/Scarecrow_of_Romney_Marsh.html "The Religious Affiliation of Comic Book Characters: Rev. Dr. Christopher Syn, the Scarecrow of Romney Marsh (one of the world's first masked crime-fighters)" (no date)], and other sources.&lt;/ref&gt; are used to refer to those without such powers who have many other common traits of superheroes.

The folkloric Spring-heeled Jack came to be featured in a series of Penny Dreadfuls as a villain.  However, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, he was reinvented as a crime-fighter with a disguise, secret lair, and gadgets, hallmarks of superheroes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackcatpress.co.uk/Spring_Heeled_Jack_Page.htm ''The Complete Spring Heeled Jack Page'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Modernisme''''' ({{IPA-ca|muðərˈnizmə}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] for "modernism"), also known as '''[[Catalan people#Culture and society|Catalan]] modernism''', is the historiographic denomination given to an art and literature movement associated with the search of a new entitlement of Catalan culture, one of the most predominant cultures within [[Spain]]. Nowadays it is considered a movement based on the cultural reivindication of a ''catalan identity''. Its main form of expression was in architecture, but many other arts were involved (painting, sculpture, etc.), and especially the design and the decorative arts (cabinetmaking, carpentry, forged iron, ceramic tiles, ceramics, glass-making, silver and goldsmith work, etc.), which were particularly important, especially in their role as support to architecture. Modernisme was also a literary movement (poetry, fiction, drama). 

Although Modernisme was part of a general trend that emerged in [[Europe]] around the [[Fin de siècle|turn of the 20th century]], in [[Catalonia]] the trend acquired its own unique personality. Modernisme's distinct name comes from its special relationship, primarily with [[Catalonia]] and [[Barcelona]], which were intensifying their local characteristics for socio-ideological reasons after the revival of Catalan culture and in the context of spectacular urban and industrial development. It is equivalent to a number of other [[fin de siècle]] art movements going by the names of [[Art Nouveau]] in [[France]] and [[Belgium]], [[Jugendstil]] in [[Germany]], [[Secession (art)|Sezession]] in [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Liberty style]] in [[Italy]] and Modern or [[Glasgow Style]] in [[Scotland]].

Modernisme was active from roughly 1888 (the [[Exposición Universal de Barcelona|First Barcelona World Fair]]) to 1911 (the death of [[Joan Maragall]], the most important ''Modernista'' poet). The ''Modernisme'' movement was centred in the city of [[Barcelona]], though it reached far beyond, and is best known for its architectural expression, especially in the work of [[Antoni Gaudí]], but was also significant in sculpture, poetry, theatre and painting. Notable painters include [[Santiago Rusiñol]], [[Ramon Casas]],&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Robert (1993) 'Barcelona', London, {{ISBN|0-00-272167-8}}, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isidre Nonell]], [[Hermen Anglada Camarasa]], Joaquim Mir, [[Eliseu Meifrèn]], Lluïsa Vidal and Miquel Utrillo. Notable sculptors are [[Josep Llimona]], Eusebi Arnau and Miquel Blai.

==Main concepts==
[[File:Barcelona-gm4.jpg|thumb|right|Duana de Barcelona (Customs House), by [[Enric Sagnier]]]]

[[Catalan nationalism]] was an important influence upon ''Modernista'' artists, who were receptive to the ideas of [[Valentí Almirall]] and [[Enric Prat de la Riba]] and wanted Catalan culture to be regarded as equal to that of other European countries. Such ideas can be seen in some of Rusiñol's plays against the Spanish army (most notably ''[[L'Hèroe]]''), in some authors close to [[anarchism]] ([[Jaume Brossa]] and [[Gabriel Alomar]], for example) or in the articles of [[federalism|federalist]] anti-[[monarchism|monarchic]] writers such as [[Miquel dels Sants Oliver]]. They also opposed the traditionalism and religiousness of the [[Renaixença]] Catalan Romantics, whom they ridiculed in plays such as [[Santiago Rusiñol]]'s ''[[Els Jocs Florals de Canprosa]]'' (roughly, "The Poetry Contest of Proseland"), a satire of the revived [[Jocs Florals]] and the political milieu which promoted them.

''Modernistes'' largely rejected bourgeois values, which they thought to be the opposite of art. Consequently, they adopted two stances: they either set themselves apart from society in a [[bohemianism|bohemian]] or culturalist attitude (Decadent and Parnassian poets, Symbolist playwrights, etc.) or they attempted to use art to change society (''Modernista'' architects and designers, playwrights inspired by [[Henrik Ibsen]], some of [[Joan Maragall|Maragall]]'s poetry, etc.)

==Architecture and the plastic arts==
The earliest example of ''Modernista'' [[architecture]] is the café Castell dels tres Dragons designed by [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]] in the Parc de la Ciutadella for the [[Exposición Universal de Barcelona|1888 Universal Exhibition]]. It is a search for a particular style for Catalonia drawing on Medieval and Arab styles. Like the currents known in other countries as [[Art Nouveau]], Jugendstil, Stile Liberty, Modern Style or [[Sezessionstil]], ''Modernisme'' was closely related to the English [[Arts and Crafts movement]] and the [[Gothic revival]]. As well as combining a rich variety of historically-derived elements, it is characterized by the predominance of the curve over the straight line, by rich decoration and detail, by the frequent use of vegetal and other organic motifs, the taste for asymmetry, a refined aestheticism and dynamic shapes.&lt;ref&gt;Solà-Morales, I, (1992) 'Arquitectura Modernista, fi de segle a Barcelona', Barcelona, {{ISBN|84-252-1563-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While Barcelona was the centre of ''Modernista'' construction, the Catalan industrial bourgeoisie built industrial buildings and summer residences - ''cases d'estiueig'' - in many Catalan towns, notably [[Terrassa]] and [[Reus]]. The textile factory which is now home to the Catalan national technical museum [[MNACTEC]] is an outstanding example.

[[File:Reptil Parc Guell Barcelona.jpg|thumb|right|'El drac' (dragon) in the [[Parc Güell]], by [[Antoni Gaudí]].]]
[[Antoni Gaudí]] is the best-known architect of this movement. Other influential architects were [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]] and [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]], and later [[Josep Maria Jujol]], [[Rafael Guastavino]] and [[Enrique Nieto (architect)|Enrique Nieto]].&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, David, 'Modern architecture in Barcelona, 1854-1929', Barcelona, 1985. {{cite web |url=http://www.anglo-catalan.org/op/monographs/issue03.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425152348/http://www.anglo-catalan.org/op/monographs/issue03.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
In literature, ''Modernisme'' stood out the most in narrative. The ''nouvelles'' and novels of decadent writers such as [[Prudenci Bertrana]] (whose highly controversial ''[[Josafat (book)|Josafat]]'' involved a demented priest who ends up killing a prostitute), [[Caterina Albert]] (also known as Víctor Catala), author of bloody, expressionistic tales of rural violence, opposed to the idealisation of nature propugned by Catalan Romantics, or [[Raimon Casellas]] have been highly influential upon later Catalan narrative, essentially recovering a genre that had been lost due to political causes since the end of the Middle Ages. Those writers often, though not always, show influences from Russian literature of the 19th Century and also [[Gothic novel]]s. Still, works not influenced by those sources, such as [[Joaquim Ruyra]]'s slice-of-life tales of the North-Eastern Catalan coast are perhaps even more influential than that of the aforementioned authors, and Rusiñol's well-known ''[[L'auca del senyor Esteve]]'' (roughly "The Tale of Mr. Esteve"; an ''[[auca (cartoon)|auca]]'' is a type of illustrated [[Broadside (printing)|broadside]], similar to a one-sheet comic book) is an ironic critique of Catalan bourgeoisie more related to ironic, pre-Realist Catalan ''costumisme''.

In poetry, ''Modernisme'' closely follows Symbolist and Parnassian poetry, with poets frequently crossing the line between both tendencies or alternating between them. Another important strain of ''Modernista'' poetry is [[Joan Maragall]]'s "Paraula viva" (''Living word'') school, which advocated Nietzschean vitalism and spontaneous and imperfect writing over cold and thought-over poetry. Although poetry was very popular with the ''Modernistes'' and there were lots of poets involved in the movement, Maragall is the only ''Modernista'' poet who is still widely read today.

''Modernista'' theatre was also important, as it smashed the insubstantial regional plays that were popular in 19th century Catalonia. There were two main schools of ''Modernista'' theatre: social theatre, which intended to change society and denounce injustice—the worker stories of [[Ignasi Iglésias]], for example ''[[Els Vells]]'' ("The old ones"); the Ibsen-inspired works of [[Joan Puig i Ferreter]], most notably ''[[Aigües Encantades]]'' ("Enchanted Waters"); Rusiñol's antimilitaristic play ''[[L'Hèroe]]''—and symbolist theatre, which emphasised the distance between artists and the bourgeoisie—for example, Rusiñol's ''[[Cigales i Formigues]]'' ("Cicadas and Ants") or ''[[El Jardí Abandonat]]'' ("The Abandoned Garden").

==Linguistics==
''Modernista'' ideas impelled ''[[L'Avenç]]'' collaborator [[Pompeu Fabra]] to devise a new [[orthography]] for Catalan. However, only with the later rise of [[Noucentisme]] did his projects come to fruition and end the orthographic chaos which reigned at the time.

==Decline==
By 1910, ''Modernisme'' had been accepted by the bourgeoisie and had pretty much turned into a fad. It was around this time that [[Noucentisme|Noucentista]] artists started to ridicule the rebel ideas of ''Modernisme'' and propelled a more bourgeois art and a more right-of-center version of Catalan Nationalism, which eventually rose to power with the victory of the [[Regionalist League|Lliga Regionalista]] in 1912. Until [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]]'s dictatorship suppressed all substantial public use of Catalan, Noucentisme was immensely popular in Catalonia. However, ''Modernisme'' did have a revival of sorts during the [[Second Spanish Republic]], with ''[[avant-garde]]'' writers such as [[Futurism (art)|Futurist]] [[Joan-Salvat Papasseit]] earning comparisons to Joan Maragall, and the spirit of [[Surrealism|Surrealists]] such as [[Josep Vicent Foix]] or [[Salvador Dalí]] being clearly similar to the rebellion of the ''Modernistes'', what with Dalí proclaiming that Catalan Romanticist [[Àngel Guimerà]] was ''a putrefact pervert''. However, the ties between Catalan art from the 1930s and ''Modernisme'' are not that clear, as said artists were not consciously attempting to continue any tradition.

''Modernista'' architecture survived longer. The Spanish city of [[Melilla]] in Northern Africa experienced an economic boom at the turn of the 20th century, and its new bourgeoisie showed its riches by massively ordering ''Modernista'' buildings. The workshops established there by Catalan architect [[Enrique Nieto (architect)|Enrique Nieto]] continued producing decorations in this style even when it was out of [[fashion in Barcelona]], which results in Melilla having, oddly enough, the second largest concentration of ''Modernista'' works after Barcelona.

== UNESCO World Heritage ==
Some of the works of Catalan Modernism have been listed by [[UNESCO]] as [[World Cultural Heritage]]:

== Architects ==
There were more than 100 architects who made buildings of the ''Modernista'' style, three of whom are particularly well known for their outstanding buildings: [[Antoni Gaudí]], [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]] and [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]].

* [[Antoni Gaudí]], who went beyond mainstream ''Modernisme'', creating a personal style based on observation of the nature and exploitation of traditional Catalan construction traditions. He was using regulated geometric shapes as the [[hyperbolic paraboloid]], the hyperboloid, the helicoid and the conoide.&lt;ref&gt;http://noticias.arq.com.mx/Detalles/9955.html.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]] created a genuine alternative architecture. Along with [[Josep Vilaseca i Casanovas]] he worked towards a modern and international style. Domènech continued on from Viollet-le-Duc, his work characterized by a mix of constructive rationalism and ornaments inspired in the Hispano-Arab architecture as seen in the [[Palau de la Música Catalana]], in the [[Hospital de Sant Pau]] or in the [[Institut Pere Mata]] of Reus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arteespana.com/arquitecturamodernista.htm&lt;/ref&gt; His Hotel Internacional at Passeig de Colom in Barcelona (demolished after the 1888 World Fair) was an early example of industrial building techniques.
* [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]] was a Catalan architect, politician and historian who was involved in many projects to restore older buildings. One of his most well-known buildings is his rebuilding of the [[Casa Amatller]] in [[Passeig de Gràcia]]. It has elements in both the Catalan tradition and others originating in the [[Netherlands]] or the [[Germany|German]] [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]. [[Neo-Gothic]] is also apparent in his Codorniu Winery (Caves Codorniu, 1904). He built Casa Amatller and [[Casa Trinxet]].

* [[Josep Vilaseca i Casanovas]], author of the [[Arc de Triomf]] of Barcelona (gate entrance to the Exposition of 1888) and the Casa Pia Batlló of the Rambla Catalunya, Gran Via.
* [[Joan Rubió i Bellver]], pupil of Domènech i Montaner and disciple and assistant of Gaudí between 1893 and 1905 to the [[Sagrada Família]], to the [[Casa Batlló]] and the [[Parc Güell]].

'''''Moulin Rouge: La Goulue''''' is a poster by [[France|French]] artist [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. It is a colour [[lithograph]] from 1891, probably printed in about 3,000 copies, advertising the famous dancers [[La Goulue]] and [[Valentin le désossé|"No-Bones" Valentin]], and the new [[Paris]] dance hall [[Moulin Rouge]].&lt;ref name="IMA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=Indianapolis|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although most examples were pasted as advertising posters and lost, surviving examples are in the collection of the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] and many other institutions.

==Description==
''Moulin Rouge: La Goulue'' is a bold, four-color lithograph depicting the famous [[cancan]] dancer La Goulue and her flexible partner Valentine le désossé made to advertise the popular French club, Moulin Rouge. Their audience is reduced to silhouettes in order to focus attention on the performers and evoke the Japanese art then in vogue. The triple repetition of the club's name draws the focus down to the central figure of the poster, La Goulue herself.&lt;ref name="NGA"/&gt; The stark white of her petticoats, depicted with just a few lines on the white paper, epitomizes Toulouse-Lautrec's boldly simplistic style, a sharp break from the text-heavy posters of the day.&lt;ref name="IMA"/&gt;

==Historical information==
The Moulin Rouge had opened two years earlier, in 1889, and instantly established itself as a [[Montmartre]] landmark. It was renowned for the elasticity of its young dancers, both physically and morally; police officers made periodic checks to ensure that they were all wearing underwear. However, the poster by [[Jules Chéret]] advertising the club's delights, was relatively subdued, so the director [[Charles Zidler]] hired the young (only 27 years old) Toulouse-Lautrec to create a more vibrant poster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toulouse-Lautrec PL. 122 Moulin Rouge - La Goulue|publisher=Yaneff International Gallery|url=http://www.yaneff.com/html/plates/pl122.html|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''Moulin Rouge: La Goulue'' was Toulouse-Lautrec's first attempt at lithography, such was his grasp of the medium's possibilities that it was an immediate sensation. 3000 copies spread around Paris captivated the public with their eye-catching design, bold colors, and innovative, Japanese-inspired use of silhouettes. Cannily focusing on the dancer La Goulue, whose energetic kicks and insatiable appetites had made her famous, gave the poster an additional boost in popularity. However, it was Toulouse-Lautrec's own artistic skill that made him a star overnight.&lt;ref name="NGA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Matheny|first=Lynn Kellmanson|title=Cafés, Cabarets, and Dance Halls|publisher=[[National Gallery of Art]]|year=2005|url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2005/toulouse/cafes.shtm|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mšecké Žehrovice Head''' is a male sculpted head from c. 150-50 BC found at the double [[Viereckschanze]] site in [[Mšecké Žehrovice]], about 65&amp;nbsp;km north-west of [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]].  It is one of the best known works of [[Celtic art]] from [[Iron Age Europe]], and, along with the [[Glauberg]] "Prince" and the 
[[Warrior of Hirschlanden]], one of the few large representations of the human figure. Ever since its discovery in 1943, the sculpture became one of the most photographed, reproduced and published [[La Tène culture|La Tène]] (cc. 450-50 B.C.) objects ever.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vincent Megaw|Megaw]] and [[Ruth Megaw|Megaw]]; Venclová, N., ed. "The Stone Head". In ''Mšecké Žehrovice in Bohemia. Archaeological Background to a Celtic Hero'' (Kronos B.Y. editions, 1998:281)&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture is now in the Prague National Museum as inventory No. 111938.

With its iconic moustache, owl-like eyes, torc ornament and unique hairstyle, the marlstone head became an international mascot of 'barbarian' Europe, embellishing the covers of many scientific as well as populist publications concentrating on Iron Age Europe related issues.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

==Substance==
The stone head, sculpted from local Cretaceous [[limestone]] has a maximum height of 234mm and width of 174mm. The sculpture was broken into at least five pieces sometime in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Jansová, L. "Mšecké Žehrovice und die Frage der Viereckschanzen in Böhmen". (''Archaeologické Rozhledy'', 1968, 20:470-489)&lt;/ref&gt; Four pieces have been found in fairly good condition. However, the missing fragment or possibly fragments, a right-hand side of the head including upper part of the ear, have not yet been found. The heavily stylized facial features are projected on an almost flat surface surrounded by a braid-like  shaped hair. The most prominent are the bulging oval eyes, contoured by a curvilinear eyebrow matching a similarly imposing curvilinear moustache. The mouth is suggested by a mere downward bending line.&lt;ref&gt;Venclová, N., "The Venerable Bede, druidic tonsure and archaeology", (''Antiquity'', 2002, 76:458-71)&lt;/ref&gt; The ears are not naturalistic but rather represented as [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] buds, a stylistic form representative of La Tène art.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobstahl, P. ''Early Celtic Art'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1944)&lt;/ref&gt; The neck is formed in a shape of a [[torc]], a traditional Celtic necklace. A similar torc can be seen on the second-century B.C. sculpture of a ''[[Dying Gaul]]'' from Pergamon.

==Background==
The visual imagery of the La Tène period was characterized by an ubiquitous appearance of an anthropomorphic head symbol typical of Central and Western Celtic Europe &lt;ref&gt;Megaw and Megaw, ''Celtic Art. From its Beginning to the Book of Kells'', (New York, NY:  Thames and Hudson, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; These images were skillfully entwined in ornaments, handles, jewelry and reliefs fashioned mostly of metals. [[Anthropomorphism|Anthropomorphic]] sculpture itself was extraordinarily rare and few examples survive till today. The ''Celtic Hero'' was found during a course of 1943 excavation of [[oppidum]] Mšecké Žehrovice in central Bohemia, Czech Republic. The sculpture was buried in a pit on a southwest corner of a square enclosure located within the oppidum.  Other artifacts found in the pit include burned animal bones that date the feature to late La Tène period LT C2-D1 (approx. 150-50 BC.), pottery sherds,  pieces of [[saprolite]] and a piece of iron wire. The dating of the pit is further supported by the typology of the pottery sherds which also place the interment of the sculpture to approx. mid 2nd to mid 1st century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Venclová, ''šecké Žehrovice in Bohemia. Archaeological Background to a Celtic Her'', (Kronos B.Y. Editions, 1998:31)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ormolu''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔr|m|əl|uː}} (from French ''or moulu'', signifying ground or pounded gold) is an English term, used since the 18th century for the [[gilding]] technique of applying finely ground, high-carat [[gold]]–[[mercury (element)|mercury]] [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]] to an object of [[bronze]], and for objects finished in this way.

The mercury is driven off in a [[kiln]] leaving behind a gold coating.  The French refer to this technique as "''bronze doré''"; in English, it is known as "'''gilt bronze'''".

==Process==
The manufacture of true ormolu employs a process known as mercury-gilding or [[fire-gilding]], in which a solution of [[Mercury(II) nitrate|mercuric nitrate]] is applied to a piece of [[copper]], [[brass]], or bronze; followed by the application of an [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]] of gold and mercury.  The item is then exposed to extreme heat until the mercury vaporizes and the gold remains, adhering to the metal object.

This process has generally been supplanted by the [[electroplating]] of gold over a [[nickel]] substrate, which is more economical and less dangerous.

==Health risk==
Due to exposure to the harmful mercury fumes, most gilders did not survive beyond 40 years of age. In literature there is a reference from [[John Webster]]:

{{quote|Hang him; a gilder that hath his brains perished with quicksilver is not more cold in the liver|''[[The White Devil]]''}}

After around 1830, legislation in France had outlawed the use of mercury, although it continued to be commonly employed until around 1900 and was still in use around 1960 in very few workshops. To replace ormolu, other gilding techniques (like electroplating from the mid-19th century on) were utilized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antiqueinstruments.co.uk/ormolu ''Ormolu, definition and origins'': in Antiqueinstruments] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811140333/http://antiqueinstruments.co.uk/ormolu |date=August 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=January 2018}} Electroplating is the most common modern technique.  Ormolu techniques are essentially the same as those used on [[silver]], to produce [[silver-gilt]] (also known as [[vermeil]]).

==Alternatives==
A later substitute of a mixture of metals resembling ormolu was developed in France and called ''pomponne'', though the mix of copper and [[zinc]], sometimes with an addition of [[tin]], is technically a type of brass. From the 19th century the term has been popularized to refer to gilt metal or imitation gold.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopédie méthodique&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilt-bronze is found from [[ancient history|antiquity]] onwards across Eurasia, and especially in [[Chinese art]], where it was always more common than silver-gilt, the opposite of Europe.

==Applications==
Craftsmen principally used ormolu for the decorative mountings of furniture, clocks, lighting devices, and [[porcelain]]. The great French furniture designers and [[Cabinet making|cabinetmakers]], or ''[[ébéniste]]s'', of the 18th and 19th centuries made maximum use of the exquisite gilt-bronze mounts produced by ''[[fondeurs-ciseleurs]]'' (founders and finishers) such as the renowned [[Jacques Caffieri]] (1678–1755), whose finished gilt-bronze pieces were almost as fine as jewelers' work. Ormolu mountings attained their highest artistic and technical development in France.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Similarly fine results could be achieved for lighting devices, such as chandeliers and candelabras, as well as for the ornamental metal mounts applied to clock cases and to ceramic pieces. In the hands of the Parisian ''marchands-merciers'', the precursors of decorators, ormolu or gilt-bronze sculptures were used for bright, non-oxidizing fireplace accessories or for Rococo or Neoclassical mantel-clocks or wall-mounted clock-cases – a specialty of [[Charles Cressent]] (1685–1768) – complemented by rock-crystal drops on gilt-bronze chandeliers and wall-lights.

The bronze mounts were cast by [[lost wax casting]], and then chiseled and [[Repoussé and chasing|chased]] to add detail. [[Rococo]] gilt bronze tends to be finely cast, lightly chiseled, and part-burnished. [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] gilt-bronze is often entirely chiseled and chased with extraordinary skill and delicacy to create finely varied surfaces.

The ormolu technique was extensively used in the [[French Empire mantel clock]]s, reaching its peak during this period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zaandam.klokkenmuseum.info/ Pier Van Leeuwen, ''Empire mantel clocks: A golden dream in timekeepers'' (2003): in the Museum of the Dutch Clock website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese and European porcelains mounted in gilt-bronze were luxury wares that heightened the impact of often-costly and ornamental ceramic pieces sometimes used for display.  Chinese ceramics with gilt-bronze mounts were produced under the guidance of the Parisian ''marchands-merciers'', for only they had access to the ceramics (often purchased in the Netherlands) and the ability to overleap the [[guild]] restrictions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} A few surviving pieces of 16th-century Chinese porcelain subsequently mounted in contemporary European silver-gilt, or ''[[vermeil]]'', show where the foundations of the later fashion lay.

From the late 1760s, [[Matthew Boulton]] (1728–1809) of Birmingham produced English ormolu vases and perfume-burners in the latest Neoclassical style. Though the venture never became a financial success, it produced the finest English ormolu. In the early 19th century fine English ormolu came from the workshops of [[Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy]] (1780–1854).

In France, the tradition of neoclassic ormolu to [[Pierre-Philippe Thomire]] (1751–1843) was continued by [[Lucien-François Feuchère]]. Beurdeley &amp; Cie. produced excellent ormolu in Rococo and Neoclassical styles in Paris, and rococo gilt-bronze is characteristic of the furniture of [[François Linke]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4253">'''Park McArthur''' (born 1984, North Carolina, USA) is an artist living in [[New York City]] who works in [[sculpture]], [[Installation art|installation]], [[Writing|text]], and [[sound]]. McArthur is a wheelchair user whose work uses this position to inform her art.

==Life and work==
McArthur graduated with a Masters in Fine Art from the [[University of Miami]] in 2009 and studied at the Whitney Museum of American Art’s Independent Study Program, 2011-2012. About McArthur's 2014 exhibition ''Ramps'', wherein the artist exhibited the wheelchair ramps of institutions with which she had previously worked, writer Andrew Blackley said, "The exhibition displayed the means by which institutions both produce and deny access. Each ramp challenged reappraisal and reinforced a set of past and future foreclosures. ‘Ramps’ enlisted generative, generous responses to the negativity of the institution, to the point of engendering the reproduction of those very negative characteristics (by removing the objects’ previously assumed ‘function’). By extension, at stake and always under threat are the threaded relationships between queerness and disability, the breakdown of their concomitant binaries and the temporality of care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blackley|first1=Andrew|title=Park McArthur: Geometry, Material, Scale|journal=Afterall Journal|date=Autumn–Winter 2015|pages=54–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McArthur, recently, in 2015, addressed [[Félix González-Torres|Felix Gonzalez-Torrez]]'s ''"Untitled" (Love Letter From the War Front)'' in [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], Lower Manhattan, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Park McArthur on "Untitled" (Love Letter From The War Front) by Felix Gonzalez-Torrez|url=http://whitney.org/WatchAndListen/Artists?context=Artist&amp;play_id=1283|website=Whitney Museum of American Art|publisher=Whitney Museum of American Art|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McArthur's work has been described as questioning of "care alongside questions of autonomy and dependency" in regards to the daily experience of disabled individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newschool.edu/lang/faculty/Park-McArthur/|title=Park McArthur|website=www.newschool.edu|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; McArthur uses her work to challenge the status quo and give those who are usually marginalized by societal structures a voice. Her choice of medium are sculptures and installations that "conceptually driven and often composed of utilitarian materials such as blocks of foam or a Wikipedia entry."&lt;ref name="lnchen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Park McArthur|url=https://www.artsy.net/artist/park-mcarthur|website=Artsy|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her works elicit an “experience of activism and jerry-built ingenuity.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/12/19-best-art-shows-of-2014.html|title=The 19 Best Art Shows of 2014|website=Vulture|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, McArthur won the [[Wynn Newhouse Award]], an annual prize given to disabled artists in recognition of their artistic merit.

McArthur is represented by Essex Street Gallery, New York, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McArthur|first1=Park|url=http://www.essexstreet.biz/artist/mcarthur|website=Essex Street Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perkins+Will''' is an American architecture and design firm established in 1935.

==History==
The firm was established by Lawrence Perkins (1907-1998&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/06/arts/lawrence-perkins-90-architect-who-loved-building-schools.html ''New York Times'' obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;) and Philip Will (1906-1985).&lt;ref&gt;1967 ''World Book Encyclopedia'', Vol. 1, p. 591.&lt;/ref&gt; Perkins and Will met while studying architecture at [[Cornell University]]. The company was founded in Chicago.

The company attracted national attention in 1940 with the [[Crow Island School]] in Winnetka, Illinois, designed in association with [[Eliel Saarinen]] and [[Eero Saarinen]]. In 1986, Perkins+Will was bought by Dar Al-Handasah, a Lebanese consulting firm.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dargroup.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Perkins + Will announced its planned acquisition of The Freelon Group, led by [[Philip Freelon]]. After the close of the transaction, Freelon is expected to join Perkins + Will’s board of directors and become managing and design director of the firm’s North Carolina practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bracken|first=David|title=Global architecture firm Perkins+Will acquiring the Freelon Group|url=http://www.thedurhamnews.com/2014/03/06/3679068/global-architecture-firm-perkinswill.html|accessdate=12 March 2014|newspaper=The Durham News|date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainable design==
The firm's website claims to have more [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) accredited professionals than any other design firm in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/perkinswill-designs-more-than-150-leed-certified-projects-171118981.html PR Newswire, September 25, 2012], retrieved 2012-09-29&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Perkins+Will announced the LEED-ND (Neighborhood Development) platinum level certification for its 100th sustainable building, the Dockside Green Phase Two Balance project, located in [[Victoria, British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usgbc.org/Docs/Archive/General/Docs10125.pdf USGBC Dockside Green project page].

The '''Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments''' or '''Roerich Pact''' is an inter-American [[treaty]]. The most important idea of the Roerich Pact is the [[legal recognition]] that the defense of [[cultural objects]] is more important than the use or destruction of that culture for military [[defense (military)|purposes]], and the protection of culture always has precedence over any [[military necessity]].

[[File:N Roerich.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Nicholas Roerich]].]]

Russian painter and philosopher [[Nicholas Roerich]] (1874–1947)&lt;ref&gt;[[Leslie Brenner]], "Nicholas Roerich. Idealist and Visionary", ''[[Foreign Affairs Journal]]'', April 1990&lt;/ref&gt; initiated the modern movement for the defense of cultural objects, for the idea of "Peace of Civilizations". Besides the recognition as one of the greatest Russian painters, Roerich's most notable achievement during his lifetime was the Roerich Pact signed on 15 April 1935 by the representatives of [[International Conference of American States|American states]] in the [[Oval Office]] of the [[White House]] (Washington, DC). It was the first international treaty signed in the Oval Office.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Stoumatoff, ''FDR's Unfinished Portrait: A Memoir'', University of Pittsburgh Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-8229-3659-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholas Roerich was born on 9 October 9, 1874, in [[St. Petersburg]]. His parents encouraged him to study law, but seeing their son's inclination for painting, they allowed him to study both, which he did with much success. In 1900, Roerich went to [[Paris]] to take lessons from [[Fernand Cormon]], the well known tutor of [[Van Gogh]] and [[Toulouse-Lautrec]]. Upon his return to St. Petersburg, he married [[Helena Roerich|Helena Shaposhnikova]], who later developed the [[Agni Yoga]] philosophy. Soon Roerich became quite a successful painter. One of his paintings was purchased by Russian [[Tsar Nicolas II]] himself. Roerich also worked as stage and costume designer for several operas and ballets by [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]], premiered in St. Petersburg.

In 1917 Roerich went to live near a lake in [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]], to strengthen his health. After the border between Russia and Finland was closed in 1918 in the context of the [[October Revolution]] and [[Finnish Civil War]], the family travelled across several [[Scandinavia]]n countries to [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and eventually left for [[North America]] in 1920. There, Roerich founded two cultural institutions: "[[Cor Ardens]]" (Flaming Heart, a fraternity of artists from several countries) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corardens.com/|title=Scripture Speaks - Savoring the deep meaning of the Word of God which unfolds each year in the liturgy, revealing the fundamental mysteries of our faith.|website=Corardens.com|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Master Institute of United Arts" (an organization for education, science, and philosophy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roerich.org/roerich-biography.php|title=Nicholas Roerich biographical outline|website=Roerich.org|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, the [[Roerich Museum]] was founded in New York. In 1929, it moved to a new building. Presently, the Roerich Museum is located in [[Manhattan]], at the corner of 107th Street and Riverside Drive. In 1929, Roerich's work towards the pact was recognised through a nomination for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/redirector/?redir=archive/show.php&amp;id=5885 Nobel Prize Committee archives 1929]&lt;/ref&gt;.


After leaving America, the Roerichs settled at Naggar in the [[Kullu Valley]] from which their estate looked towards the [[Himalayas]]. Here they established the [[Urusvati Institute]] which remains in Naggar with an exhibition about the pact. Nicholas Roerich died of a cardiac arrest on 13 December 1947.

== Origins of the Roerich Pact ==
An idea about the protection of [[cultural monuments]] was formulated for the first time by N.K. Roerich in 1899. During his excavations at [[Saint Petersburg Governorate|Saint-Petersburg province]], Roerich began to point to the necessity of protection of cultural monuments, which reproduce a world-view of ancient people for us.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In 1903, Roerich together with his wife Helena Ivanovna Roerich toured through forty ancient Russian cities, including [[Yaroslavl]], [[Kostroma]], [[Kazan]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], [[Suzdal]], [[Yuryev-Polsky (town)|Yuriev-Polsky]], [[Smolensk]], [[Vilnius]], [[Izborsk]] and [[Pskov]]. In 1904, proceeding the expedition, N.K.Roerich has visited [[Uglich]], [[Kalyazin]], [[Kashin (town)|Kashin]] and [[Tver]]. During these travels Roerich created a large series of architectural studies, created near 90 paintings of the visited sites. Later many Russian churches were destroyed and these paintings remain the only documenting images.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Summarizing this trips, the painter admired the beauty of the ancient monuments. Roerich, expressing his feelings for the state of their protection, in his article "Along the old times" (1903): "Last summer I had an occasion to see many our true antique and little love to it".

In 1904, Roerich gave a report to the Emperor's [[Russian Archeological Society|Russian Archeologist Society]] about the sad state of historical monuments and the necessity to take prompt actions to protect them.

During the [[Russian-Japan war]] (1904–1905), Roerich expressed an idea about the necessity of a special treaty for the protection of institutions and cultural monuments.  In the course of several years after his travel in 1903-1904, Roerich repeatedly pointed out the state of antique monuments. He wrote several articles dedicated to the poor state of the churches. In the article "Silent Pogroms" (1911) Roerich wrote about the unskillful restoration of [[St. John the Forerunner Church at Yaroslavl]]: "Who would defense a beautiful antique from mad pogroms? It is grievously when the antique dies. But it is more terrible when the antique remains disfigured, false, imitation...".

In 1914, Roerich appealed to the high command of the [[Imperial Russian army]], as well as the governments of the [[United States]] and [[Third French Republic|France]] with an idea of conclusion of an international agreement aimed on the protection of cultural values during armed conflicts. He created a poster "Enemy of Mankind" denouncing the barbaric destruction of cultural monuments, and picture "Glow" expressing a protest against [[World War I]].

In 1915, Roerich wrote a report for Russian Emperor [[Nicholas II]] and Great Prince [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856–1929)|Nicholas Nikolayevich]] containing an appeal to make real state measures for national protection of cultural values.

In 1929, Roerich, in cooperation with [[Georgi Shklyaver|G.G. Shklyaver]] (a.k.a. Georges Chklaver), a doctor of [[international law]] and political sciences at [[Paris University]] prepared a project of the Pact for protection of cultural values. Simultaneously Roerich proposed a distinctive sign to identify the objects that are in need of protection – the [[Banner of Peace]]. It represents a white cloth with a red circle and three red circles inscribed in it.

== The Roerich Pact ==
In 1929 Roerich in collaboration with [[Paris University]] professor G.G. Shklyaver  (a.k.a. Georges Chklaver) prepared a draft of an international treaty dedicated to protection of cultural values. The scheme was to be a cultural analog to the [[Red Cross]] for medical neutrality.

In 1930, text of draft agreement with accompanying Roerich's appeal to governments and peoples of all countries was published in press and distributed in government, scientific, artistic and educational institutions of the whole world. As a result, the committees supporting the Pact were established in many countries. The draft pact was approved by Committee for Museum affairs at [[League of Nations]] and also by the Committee of the [[Pan-American Union]]. Ultimately, the Pact was signed by 21 states in the Americas and was ratified by ten of them.

In the [[aftermath of World War II]], the Roerich Pact played an important role in forming of international law standards and public activity in the field of protection of cultural heritage. In 1949, at the fourth [[UNESCO]] General Conference, a decision was accepted to begin the work for international law regulation in the field of cultural heritage protection in case of armed conflict.

Ideas of Roerich Pact still are not implemented in the [[international law]], especially its principle of the almost unlimited preference of the preservation of cultural values to the military necessity.

== The Banner of Peace ==
{{main|Banner of Peace}}
[[File:Pax cultura.svg|thumb|100px|right|The Pax Cultura emblem.]]
[[File:Pax-roerix-50.jpg|thumb|200px|right|50 years of the Roerich Pact]]

"''Pax Cultura''" ("Cultural Peace" or "Peace through Culture") is the motto of the cultural artifact protection movement founded by Nicholas Roerich, and is symbolized by a maroon on white emblem consisting of three solid circles in a surrounding circle. On April 15, 1935 the Roerich Pact was signed by the [[United States]] and [[Latin America]]n nations, agreeing that "historic monuments, museums, scientific, artistic, educational and cultural institutions" should be protected both in times of peace and war, and identified by their flying a distinctive flag, the ''Banner of Peace'', bearing the Pax Cultura emblem.

According to the Roerich Museum, "The Banner of Peace symbol has ancient origins. Perhaps its earliest known example appears on Stone Age amulets: three dots, without the enclosing circle. Roerich came across numerous later examples in various parts of the world, and knew that it represented a deep and sophisticated understanding of the triune nature of existence. But for the purposes of the Banner and the Pact, Roerich described the circle as representing the totality of culture, with the three dots being Art, Science, and Religion, three of the most embracing of human cultural activities. He also described the circle as representing the eternity of time, encompassing the past, present, and future. The sacred origins of the symbol, as an illustration of the trinities fundamental to all religions, remain central to the meaning of the Pact and the Banner today."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roerich.org/nr.html?mid=pact ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roerich Pact sign was superseded by the distinctive marking of cultural property as defined by the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|Hague Convention of 1954]]. However, the emblem of the Roerich Pact is still a valid protective sign in the relations between the ten states which are bound by the Pact.

== The Roerich Pact importance for the 21st century ==
The Roerich Pact is not only a relatively short multilateral treaty: it is a conglomerate of legal ideas about a new state order in which the state and the culture closely overlap. A measure of this complexity is the share of state [[budget]] annually spent on culture, art and
education, which in many countries exceeds military expenses.

Important in the framework of ideas of the Roerich Pact is the recognition that the safety of any foreign cultural object on the territory of a foreign state must be also respected and treated as a factor much higher in significance than military willingness to bomb, destroy or use it for military purposes.

Nicholas Roerich managed to continue and develop into a profound and feasible doctrine the famous maxim proclaimed by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], "Beauty will save the World!" Hence starts a very powerful Russian movement in the development of the concept of aesthetical statehood. The concept of the state as a work of art was first suggested in the 19th century by [[Jacob Burckhardt]], who was Swiss historian of art, specializing in Italian [[Renaissance]], and who gave this name to a chapter of one of his books. The concept itself had not been formulated to a completion and was expressed in a general idea that period, as well as their rulers, considered the achievements in culture and art as most important for securing the prestige both of their states and their own, which finally resulted in the unique Italian Renaissance art, literature, philosophy and science. Roerich produced ideas based on the approaches used by Burkhardt and Dostoevsky.

Roerich, considered the care for future generations to be a cornerstone of the existence of the [[rule of law]] and the constitutional state. President of the USA, Franklin D. Roosevelt, in the speech upon the signature of the 'Roerich Pact' Treaty said: "In opening this Pact to the adherence of the Nations of the world, we are endeavoring to make of universal application one of the principles vital to the preservation of modern civilization. This Treaty possesses a spiritual significance far deeper than the text of the instrument itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/75th_Anniversary_of_Roerich_Pact_Eng.html Barenboim P., Sidiqi N. ''Bruges, the Bridge between Civilizations: The 75th Anniversary of the Roerich Pact'']. М., Letny Sad; Grid Belgium, 2010. {{ISBN|978-5-98856-114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to realize that the Roerich Pact was only the first step towards the future development of a new legal culture. All written laws must conform to the universal unwritten principles of morality, fairness, and justice, equality, autonomy, dignity, and respect that is known as a higher law theory.&lt;ref&gt;Rule of Law article in the West's Encyclopedia of American Law&lt;/ref&gt; The concrete conceptual provisions of Roerich's philosophical and legal concept of the state are based on the one of [[Rule According to Higher Law]] ideas that the primary duty of the state is to sustain and develop the spiritual unity of its citizens, by carefully preserving the best specimens of national cultural heritage, promoting universal culture and spiritual growth of all people, especially the young ones. At that, the major share of profits received by the state should be directed at the development of culture, which, as it was already mentioned, would lead to a further growth of economical prosperity.

According to Roerich's concept, the state, as an instrument for the preservation and development of culture, the instrument defending both domestic and foreign cultural treasures, the instrument maintaining peace and avoiding wars, the instrument building a new civilization, based on the best cultural traditions of today and, therefore, spending the utmost economically reasonable assets for these purposes — all this can be explicitly and exclusively based on constitutional foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Naeem Sidiqi, Op.cit. p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis R. Elbinger, "The Unifying Power of Art", in Foreign Service Journal, April 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

== World League of Culture and World Day of Culture ==
In the broad sense the Roerich Pact is understood as not only a legal treaty but also as a whole complex of measures for the protection of cultural values suggested by N. Roerich. Consequently, the Roerich Pact has not only legal but also philosophic, enlightening, and evolutional significance since it reflects an idea of cultural protection in its many manifestations.

Characterizing the Roerich Pact, cosmonaut [[Alexey Leonov|A.A. Leonov]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If we are raising a culture and spirituality then it will help us to strengthen an economics, to make the policy moral and to stop the military conflicts. This is a significance of the Roerich Pact today. The more time is passed the more actual for the world it becomes. …&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Developing the Pact ideas N. Roerich has stated the thoughts about a role of community. The laws for culture protection in itself will not work if the community will not display an activity and interest to this. Later this thought was supported by academician [[Dmitry Likhachov|D.S. Likhachev]]. He said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;… I believe that the best and freely developing social forms of culture can unite creative constructive forces and improve a social life, thereby help the state to maintain high ideals of humanism and peacefulness in the people. …&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the first international conference of Roerich Pact in Bruges (September, 1931), N. Roerich proposed to create a World League of Culture. One of main aims of the League must be to train care of the nature.

In his article "Pain of the Planet" (1933) N. Roerich wrote: "The call about culture, call about the world, and call about creativity and beauty reaches the ear which is strengthen by true values only. Understanding of life as self-improving for the people's good arises where the respect of the nature is valid. Therefore, the League of Culture together with main enlightener activity must wholesale explain a wise regard for the nature as an origin of merry work, wise joy, continuous cognition and creativity".

The cultural community highly appreciates N. Roerich's thought about the implementation of [[Universal Day of Culture|World Day of Culture]]. N. Roerich wrote:
"… We shall hear about the world Day of Culture too when at all schools and enlightener societies simultaneously the day will dedicated to comprehension of the national and world cultural treasures…"

'''''Shock Illustrated''''' was an American black and white magazine published by [[EC Comics]] from late 1955 to early 1956. Part of EC's [[List of Entertaining Comics publications#Picto-Fiction|Picto-Fiction]] line, each magazine featured three to five stories. The artists drew one to four panels per page with the text overlaid onto the artwork. The first issue appeared with a cover date of September–October 1955 and featured three psychology-themed stories, similar in theme to the comic ''Psychoanalysis'' published by EC in 1955. Starting with the second issue this type of story was generally reduced to one per issue, with the remaining stories being similar in theme to those that appeared in EC's comic ''[[Shock SuspenStories]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cochran, Russ. ''Complete EC Library: Terror Illustrated''. Gemstone, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Shock Illustrated'' ran for a total of three issues. The Picto-Fiction magazines lost money from the start, and when EC's distributor went bankrupt, the company had no choice but to cancel the prints. The third issue of this magazine is known as the rarest EC publication of all time. Although all 250,000 copies had been printed, publisher [[William Gaines|Bill Gaines]] lacked the funds to bind them, and all but 100 copies were destroyed.

==Contributors==
The editor of ''Shock Illustrated'' was [[Al Feldstein]]. In addition to those stories credited to him, Feldstein also wrote under the pseudonym [[Alfred E. Neuman]]. Feldstein included multiple retellings of previous stories, a move suggested by Gaines. This included "A Question of Time" and "Dead Right" in the second issue and "Curiosity Killed" in the third issue. Contributing writers included [[Jack Oleck]] (who had worked as a writer on EC's earlier publications), Robert Bernstein, John Larner, and [[Daniel Keyes]] (using the pseudonyms Kris Daniels and A.D. Locke).

Artists featured in ''Shock Illustrated'' included [[Jack Kamen]], Rudy Nappi, [[Reed Crandall]], [[George Evans (comics)|George Evans]], [[Al Williamson]], [[Angelo Torres]] and [[Graham Ingels]].

''Shock Illustrated'' was reprinted along with the other Picto-Fiction magazines in hardbound volumes by Russ Cochran (and [[Gemstone Publishing]]) for the first time in 2006 as the final part of his ''Complete EC Library''. With these reprints, published for the first time, was the fourth issue of the title which had been produced but never printed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9878">A '''short story cycle''' (sometimes referred to as a '''story sequence''' or '''composite novel''')&lt;ref&gt;Scholars are still debating the differences between these terms; see Nagel's introduction for an overview of the discussion.&lt;/ref&gt; is a collection of [[Short story|short stories]] in which the narratives are specifically composed and arranged with the goal of creating an enhanced or different experience when reading the group as a whole as opposed to its individual parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Mann| first = Susan| year = 1989 | title = The Short Story Cycle | isbn = 0-313-25081-2 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = New York |page = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short story cycles are different from [[novels]] because the parts that would make up the chapters can all stand alone as a short story, each individually containing a beginning, middle and conclusion. When read as a group there is a tension created between the ideas of the individual stories, often showing changes that have occurred over time or highlighting the conflict between two opposing concepts or thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Mann p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this dynamic, the stories need to have an awareness of what the other stories accomplish; therefore, cycles are usually written with the expressed purpose to create a cycle as opposed to being gathered and arranged later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lynch | first = Gerald | year = 2001 | title = the one and the many | publisher = the university of Toronto Press | location = Toronto | isbn = 0-8020-3511-6 | page = 16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitional debates ==
{{See also|short story collection}}
Scholars have pointed out that there is a wide range of possibilities that fall between simple collections and novels in their most-commonly understood form. One question is how well the stories stand up individually: chapters of a novel usually cannot stand alone, whereas stories in collections are meant to be fully independent. But many books have combined stories in such a way that the stories have varying degrees of interdependence, and it is these variations that cause problems in definition. Maggie Dunn and Ann Morris, for instance, claim that the stories in a ''story cycle'' are more independent than those in a ''composite novel'',&lt;ref&gt;Dunn and Morris p.5&lt;/ref&gt; and James Nagel points out that both ''cycle'' and ''sequence'' are misleading, since ''cycle'' implies circularity and ''sequence'' implies temporal linearity, neither of which he finds to be essential to most such collections.&lt;ref name="Nagel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nagel|first=James|title=The Contemporary American Short-Story Cycle: The Ethnic Resonance of Genre|year=2001|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|location=Baton Rouge|isbn=0-8071-2660-8|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rolf Lundén has suggested four types of cycles, in order of decreasing unity: the ''cycle'', in which the ending resolves the conflicts brought up at the beginning (e.g., ''[[The Bridge of San Luis Rey]]''); the ''sequence'', in which each story is linked to the ones before it but without a cumulative story that ties everything together (e.g., ''[[The Unvanquished]]''); the ''cluster'', in which the links between stories are not always made obvious and in which the discontinuity between them is more significant than their unity (e.g., ''[[Go Down, Moses (book)|Go Down, Moses]]''); and the ''novella'', in the classical sense of a collection of unrelated stories brought together by a [[frame story]] and a narrator(s) (e.g., ''[[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'').[All examples are Lundén's]&lt;ref name=Lunden&gt;{{cite book|last=Lundén|first=Rolf|title=The United Stories of America: Studies in the Short Story Composite|year=1999|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-0692-8|pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert M. Luscher compares and contrasts the short story cycle and [[science fiction]] short stories combined into longer [[fixup]]s.&lt;ref name="luscher"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5WyidbsLaxQC&amp;lpg=PA370&amp;ots=mnc_goAXNW&amp;pg=PA370#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |title=A Companion to the American Novel |last=Luscher |first=Robert M. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2012 |isbn=9781405101196 |editor-last=Bendixen |editor-first=Alfred |editor-link=Alfred Bendixen |series=Blackwell Companions to Literature and Culture |volume=80 |page=370 |chapter=The American Short-Story Cycle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In their study of the genre, Maggie Dunn and Ann Morris note that the form descends from two different traditions: There are texts that are themselves assembled from other texts, such as the way the tales from the [[Arthurian cycle]] is compiled in books by [[Chretien de Troyes]], [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]], [[Thomas Malory]] and the ''[[Mabinogion]]''. Then there are the classic [[novella#History|serialized novellas]], many of them with [[frame story|frame stories]]; this genre includes ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', ''[[The Decameron]]'', ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', etc. Dunn and Morris show how in the nineteenth century, the genre appeared in such forms as the [[sketch story|village sketch]] collection (e.g., ''[[Our Village]]'') and the patchwork collection (e.g., [[Louisa May Alcott]]'s ''Aunt Jo's Scrap-Bag'').&lt;ref name="Dunn"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunn|first=Maggie|title=The Composite Novel: The Short Story Cycle in Transition|year=1995|publisher=Twayne Publishers; Macmillan|isbn=0-8057-0966-5|author2=Ann Morris }}&lt;/ref&gt;

J. Gerald Kennedy describes the proliferation of the genre in the twentieth century, attributing it in part to the desire "to renounce the organizing authority of an omniscient narrator, asserting instead a variety of voices or perspectives reflective of the radical subjectivity of modern experience. Kennedy finds this proliferation in keeping with [[modernist literature|modernism]] and its use of fragmentation, juxtaposition and simultaneism to reflect what the "multiplicity" that characterizes the century.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern American Short Story Sequences: Composite Fictions and Fictive Communities|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-43010-0|editor=Kennedy, J. Gerald|page=x-xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as James Nagel and Rocío G. Davis have pointed out that the story cycle has been very popular among ethnic U.S. authors. Davis argues that ethnic writers find the format useful "as a metaphor for the fragmentation and multiplicity of ethnic lives" insofar as it highights "the subjectivity of experience and understanding" by allowing "multiple impressionistic perspectives and fragmentation of simple linear history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethnicity and the American Short Story|year=1997|publisher=Garland|location=New York|isbn=0-8153-2105-8|pages=3–23|author=Davis, Rocío G.|editor=Julie Brown|chapter=Identity in Community in Ethnic Short Story Cycles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Composite Novel==
Dunn and Morris list several methods that authors use to provide unity to the collection as a whole. It has to be noted that these organising principles pertain to their theory of the composite novel as a short story collection where the focus lies on the coherent whole. (the examples are theirs):
The organising principles
* a geographical area: ''[[The Country of the Pointed Firs]]'', ''[[Dubliners]]'', ''[[The Women of Brewster Place (novel)|The Women of Brewster Place]]''
* a central protagonist, which has the option of also being the narrator: ''[[Cosmicomics]]'', ''[[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'', ''[[The Woman Warrior]]'', ''[[Julio Cortázar|A Certain Lucas]]''
* a collective protagonist: ''[[In Our Time (short story collection)|In Our Time]]'', ''[[Go Down, Moses (book)|Go Down, Moses]]'', ''[[Love Medicine]]'', ''[[Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza]]''
* patterns to create coherence: ''[[Three Lives]]'', ''[[Exile and the Kingdom]]'', ''[[Eudora Welty|The Golden Apples]]'', ''[[A Yellow Raft in Blue Water]]''
* focus on story-telling itself: ''[[The Way to Rainy Mountain]]'', ''[[Robert Coover|Pricksongs &amp; Descants]]'', ''How to Make an American Quilt''
Multiple of these organizing principles may be used in order to create a composite novel.

[[File:The Specter of Newby Church.jpg|right|350px]]
'''The Spectre of Newby Church''' (or the "Newby Monk") is the name given to an artifact found on a photograph taken in the [[Church of Christ the Consoler]], on the grounds of [[Newby Hall]] in [[North Yorkshire]], [[United Kingdom]]. The image was taken in 1963 by the Reverend Kenneth F. Lord.&lt;ref name="au"&gt;{{cite web | title = Real or fake? Mysterious ghost pictures investigated | publisher= news.com.au | date = September 13, 2013 | url = http://www.news.com.au/technology/real-or-fake-mysterious-ghost-pictures-investigated/story-e6frfro0-1226718211697 | accessdate = April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="People"&gt;{{cite news | title = World's most famous ghost pictures | newspaper = The People | pages = 4–5 | date = September 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the artifact appears to resemble a human, much speculation has been had regarding what type of person might be in the image. Most speculation by believers has concluded that it resembles a 16th-century monk, with a white shroud over his face, possibly to mask leprosy or another disfigurement. Others contend that it is an accomplice in a costume.&lt;ref name="People"/&gt;

Initial claims suggested that the figure would measure at 9 feet tall, but its feet are not visible and it could easily be standing on a box, giving the impression of height.&lt;ref&gt;Bord, J. ''Ghosts''. [[David &amp; Charles]], 1974. P. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

On looking over the image, purported photographic experts{{who|date=May 2016}} have concluded that the image is not the result of double exposure, although Rick Burden, founder of the Ghost Hunters of Australia website, believes to be "probably fake." It resembles many other double exposure hoaxes.&lt;ref name="au"/&gt;

==Plot==
{{Main|List of Star vs. the Forces of Evil characters}}
Star Butterfly is a [[Magical girl|magical princess]] from the dimension of Mewni, and the heir to the royal throne of the Butterfly Kingdom. As per tradition, she is given the family heirloom wand on her 14th birthday. After she accidentally sets fire to the family castle, her parents King River and Queen Moon Butterfly decide that a safer option is to send her to Earth as a [[foreign exchange student]], so she can continue her magic training there. She befriends Marco Diaz and lives with his family while attending Echo Creek Academy. Going in a series of misadventures using "dimensional scissors" that can open [[Portals in fiction|portals]], Star and Marco must deal with everyday school life while protecting Star's wand from falling into the hands of Ludo, a villain from Mewni who commands a group of monsters. Besides also dealing with her ex-boyfriend Tom, in Season 3, Star goes up against more serious villains like Toffee and Meteora Butterfly while uncovering the mystery behind her relative Eclipsa Butterfly.

==Background and production==
Nefcy said she originally created Star as a girl who wanted to be a [[magical girl]] like ''[[Sailor Moon (character)|Sailor Moon]]'', and Marco as a boy who was obsessed with ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' and karate; they would be enemies instead of friends. In this earlier version, Star did not have any actual magical powers; she instead would approach and solve problems primarily through the force of her determination alone.&lt;ref name="bloginterview 20150720"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.disney.com/insider/2015/07/20/creator-daron-nefcy-guides-us-through-tonights-star-studded-episode-of-star-vs-the-forces-of-evil/|title=Creator Daron Nefcy Guides Us Through Tonight’s Star-Studded Episode of Star Vs. the Forces of Evil|date=July 20, 2015|work=Disney Insider Blog|accessdate=November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nerdist"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Rutherford|first=Kristen|title=Interview: Daron Nefcy of Disney’s Star vs. the Forces of Evil|url=http://nerdist.com/interview-daron-nefcy-of-disneys-star-vs-the-forces-of-evil/|work=[[Nerdist Industries|Nerdist]]|date=March 26, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nefcy began pitching the show when she was in her third year of college, when Cartoon Network was actively soliciting the creation of pilots for prospective new shows.&lt;ref name="comicbook.com"/&gt; Nefcy originally placed Star in the fourth grade, reflecting on a time in her own childhood when she held a self-described obsession with the animated series ''[[Sailor Moon (anime)|Sailor Moon]]''. However, Nefcy later adjusted the character's age to fourteen during the time she made her series proposition to Disney.&lt;ref name="comicbook.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bloginterview 20150720"/&gt;&lt;ref name="huffpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-hill/how-comic-con-helped-crea_b_5989262.html|title=How Comic-Con Helped Create Fans for Disney XD's ''Star vs. The Forces of Evil'' Six Months Before Its First Episode Airs - Jim Hill|author=|date=|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An executive at that time made the suggestion for Star to have actual magical powers. Nefcy worked this concept into the show's current iteration, along with the idea of different dimensions as show locations, the framing device of Star being a foreign exchange student, and the plot aspects relating to Star being a princess and the subsequent consequences of her royal birthright.&lt;ref name="nerdist"/&gt; Nefcy said that the overall concept has evolved over about six years.&lt;ref name="huffpost"/&gt;

In addition to ''[[Sailor Moon (anime)|Sailor Moon]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', Nefcy has said that she had heavy influence in her youth from the animated Japanese shows ''[[Magic Knight Rayearth]]'', ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]'' and ''[[Unico]]'', the last of which featured a pink unicorn. She also cited shows unrelated to Japanese animation such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'',&lt;ref name="nerdist"/&gt; and was influenced by independent comic series such as ''[[Scott Pilgrim]]'' and ''The Dungeon''.&lt;ref name="huffpost"/&gt; With regards to the development of more strong female characters, Nefcy said that she "looked at TV over the years and I have had to go to Japan when I was younger to find the cartoons that had the characters that I wanted to see. It was always a question of 'Well, why isn't that on TV in the U.S.?'"&lt;ref name="bloginterview 20150720"/&gt;

One of the concepts she likes about the show is that it doesn't make high school the most important experience for teenagers. She also likes that Star does her own thing instead of being concerned about fitting in.&lt;ref name="nerdist"/&gt; Nefcy did not want the gimmick about keeping the magic powers a secret from others as typical of magical girl shows, so she had the students already know about it and Marco's parents as well. She also portrays Star as not really a superhero as she does not specifically go after super-villains except when they attack her, and that she doesn't really save people.&lt;ref name="comicbook.com"/&gt; Nefcy said that the episodes balance comedy and drama: "we really want our characters to feel like teenagers and have them going through the normal emotions that teenagers go through, but in this magical setting."&lt;ref name="bloginterview 20150720"/&gt;

Storyboarding and design are done in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="huffpost"/&gt; In describing the process, Nefcy said that the show is storyboard-driven, with each episode mapped out by the storyboard artists. The storyboarders also do the writing, taking a two-page outline and turning it into a full script. A storyboard for 11 minutes would require about 2000 drawings to be done in a six-week period.&lt;ref name="business insider 2015-3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/disney-animator-shares-best-and-worst-parts-of-her-job-2015-3|title=Disney animator shares best and worst parts of her job|work=[[Business Insider]]|first=Jacquelyn|last=Smith|date=March 24, 2015|accessdate=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After pre-production in the US, the first season animation was done at [[Mercury Filmworks]] in Ottawa, Canada. Mercury had also done ''[[Wander Over Yonder]]'' and the ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' series.&lt;ref name="huffpost"/&gt; For the rest of first season, the animation was done &lt;!-- on [[Toon City Animation]] in Manila, --&gt; in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="business insider 2015-3"/&gt; The second season was animated by Sugarcube and [[Rough Draft Studios]], both located in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet | user=daronnefcy | author=Daron Nefcy | number=679476188838903808 | title=@chuck_kopsho nope, now it's Sugarcube and RDK | date=December 22, 2015 | accessdate=August 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daronnefcy.com/post/135744482230/recently-i-got-the-wonderful-opportunity-to-visit|title=- Recently I got the wonderful opportunity to visit...|first=Daron|last=Nefcy | date=December 22, 2015 | work=daronnefcy.com|accessdate=February 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme song was done by Brad Breeck, who also did ''[[Gravity Falls]]''{{'}} opening theme; Nefcy said: "when we were listening to it we didn't know, because we just listened [[Blind experiment|blind]]".

The show was initially scheduled to premiere on [[Disney Channel]] after being greenlighted in March 2013, for a premiere in the Fall of 2014, before being switched over to Disney XD.&lt;ref name="comicbook.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deadline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2013/03/disney-channel-greenlights-animated-series-about-magical-princess-from-young-creator-447677/|title=Disney Channel Greenlights Animated Series About Magical Princess From Young Creator|author=Nellie Andreeva|date=March 7, 2013|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on February 23, 2018, it was announced that the show would be moving to Disney Channel for its fourth season.&lt;ref name="Star4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2018/02/disney-channel-renews-star-vs-the-forces-of-evil-announces-amphibia-owl-house-1202300438/|title=Disney Channel Launching Toon Series 'Amphibia' &amp; 'The Owl House', Renews 'Star Vs.

==Promotion and release==
The show's title sequence was promoted at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con 2014]] six months prior to its scheduled broadcast premiere. As a result, the footage was uploaded by fans to YouTube who then started generating fan art and fan fiction.&lt;ref name="huffpost"/&gt; The first episode premiered on Disney Channel in January 2015. The positive reaction on social media prompted Disney XD to order a second season of the series in February 2015, six weeks ahead of its launch of the series on Disney XD in March.&lt;ref name="deadline 20150212"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/02/star-vs-the-forces-of-evil-renewed-season-two-disney-xd-1201371982/|title=Disney XD Orders Season 2 Of ‘Star Vs.

==Reception==
''Star vs. the Forces of Evil'' has received positive reviews by critics.

Kevin Johnson of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the pilot episode a B+, saying that the show was something children could have a lot of fun with, noting how the show follows current trends in western animation "towards large-eyed characters and quirky visual trends". Johnson stated that ''Star vs. the Forces of Evil'' "excels on wild, silly, and clever set-pieces to bring the laughs and action", but expected that adult viewers won't get much out of it.&lt;ref name="episode 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/star-vs-forces-evil-star-comes-earthparty-pony-214001|title=''Star Vs.

Club]]''|last=Johnson|first=Kevin|date=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the premiere of ''Star vs. the Forces of Evil'' became the most-watched animated series debut in Disney XD’s history.&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/disney-xd-sets-animated-ratings-high-with-premiere-of-star-vs-the-forces-of-evil-1201467036/|title=Disney XD Sets Animated Ratings High with Premiere of ‘Star vs. the Forces of Evil’|publisher=''[[Variety.com]]''|last=Kissell|first=Rick|date=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of the second season, Disney XD announced it had ordered a fourth season of the show, and that in 2016, ''Star'' and another animated show ''[[Milo Murphy's Law]]'' had reached over 100 million consumer views combined across its media platforms.&lt;ref name="hr4"/&gt;

In reviewing episodes from the first season, Marcy Cook of ''[[The Mary Sue]]'' described the show as a blend of others such as ''[[Invader Zim]]'' and a sanitized ''[[Ren &amp; Stimpy]]'', with great appeal to tween and teen girls as well some laugh out loud moments for adults. She said, "[I]t's really cool to see a girl who is into cuteness and rainbows also kick-ass and enjoy it". Cook was bothered by the short episodes that made the plot seem rushed or underdeveloped. Cook was bugged by Marco's [[retcon]]ned personality from the pilot episode where he was a safety conscious kid to the series where he was a martial arts fight seeker.&lt;ref name="mary sue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/star-vs-the-forces-of-evil/|title=You Should Give Star Vs The Forces of Evil a Try|author=|date=|work=themarysue.com|accessdate=July 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caitlin Donovan of entertainment website Epicstream listed it among her top 10 animated series of 2015. She found the first few episodes to be "a little rough for me, like the show was trying too hard to be funny and weird", but that the show got better with character development and relationship building, with "a really dramatic, high-tension finale to the first season".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epicstream.com/featureslist/Top-10-Animated-Series-of-2015/2|title=Epicstream|author=|date=|work=epicstream.com|accessdate=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Critic as Artist'''" is an essay by [[Oscar Wilde]], containing the most extensive statements of his [[aesthetic philosophy]]. A dialogue in two parts, it is by far the longest one included in his collection of essays titled ''Intentions'' published in May 1891. "The Critic as Artist" is a significantly revised version of articles that first appeared in the July and September issues of ''[[Nineteenth Century (periodical)|The Nineteenth Century]]'', originally entitled "'''The True Function and Value of Criticism'''." The essay is a conversation between its leading voice Gilbert and Ernest, who suggests ideas for Gilbert to reject.

==Summary==
The essay sets to collapse the distinction between fine art and criticism cherished by artists and critics such as [[Matthew Arnold]] and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] - only critical faculty enables any artistic creation at all, while criticism is independent of the object it criticises and not necessarily subject to it. The essay champions contemplative life to the life of action. According to Gilbert, scientific principle of heredity shows we are never less free, never have more illusions than when we try to act with some conscious aim in mind. Critical contemplation is guided by conscious aesthetic sense as well as by the soul. The soul is wiser than we are, writes Wilde, it is the concentrated racial experience revealed by the imagination. Criticism is above reason, sincerity and fairness; it is necessarily subjective. It is increasingly more to criticism than to creation that future belongs as its subject matter and the need to impose form on chaos constantly increases. It is criticism rather than emotional sympathies, abstract ethics or commercial advantages that would make us cosmopolitan and serve as the basis of peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilde-online.info/the-critic-as-artist-page44.html The Critic as Artist]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Last Judgement''''' is a [[triptych]] of [[oil paintings]] by the British artist [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]], created in 1851–1854.  The work comprises three separate paintings on a theme of the [[Eschatology|end of the world]], inspired by the [[Book of Revelation]].  The paintings are generally considered to be among Martin's most important works, and have been described by some art critics as his [[masterpiece]].

The paintings were Martin's last major works before his death in 1854.  They were exhibited to the public from the time of his death until the 1870s to advertise the sale of prints from engravings of the works, being displayed in galleries and exhibition halls all over the UK, in New York in 1856–7 and in Australia in 1878–79. It has been claimed that up to eight million people viewed the paintings during their extensive tours.

Martin's style of didactic expository art was rarely praised by art critics but remained popular with the public until the 1860s.  He fell out of style by the end of the 19th century, and his works were pigeonholed as Victorian and religious by the early 20th century.

Critical opinion of Martin's work improved from the 1940s, and the [[Tate Gallery]] bought ''[[The Great Day of His Wrath]]'' in 1945.  The triptych was reassembled at the Tate Gallery in 1974 after Charlotte Frank donated the two other works following the death of her husband, Robert Frank.  The paintings were the cornerstone of the first substantial exhibition of Martin's works at the [[Tate Britain]] in 2011–12, with a theatrical [[son et lumière (show)|son et lumière]] show dramatising the manner of their exhibition in Victorian Britain.

==''The Last Judgement''==
The first element of the triptych, ''The Last Judgement'', is the central piece, intended to be displayed between the peaceful landscape of ''The Plains of Heaven'' to the left and the turbulent scene in ''[[The Great Day of His Wrath]]'' to the right.  It combines elements of both, with a crowd of "saved" people to the left, and of the "damned" to the right, with the heavenly host above.  A drawing in pencil and ink, signed and dated 1845, shows that this work was planned before Martin decided to paint a triptych, and Martin had started work on the painting by the end of 1849.  Painted in oil on canvas, it measures {{convert|196.8|cm|in}} by {{convert|325.7|cm|in}}.  

The work reflects the text of the Book of Revelation, which states that the [[Book of Judgement]] is sealed with [[seven seals]], and describes the events that take places as each seal is broken.  The breaking of the sixth seal triggers "the great day of his wrath" depicted in the second painting, followed by the last judgement after the seventh seal is broken.

According to chapter 4 of the Book of Revelation, "a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne ... and round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment: and they had on their heads crowns of gold"; in chapter 8, "four of the seven angels who have sounded their trumpets after the opening of the seventh seal", and "an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe ... to the inhabitors of the earth."; in chapter 9, a star falls from heaven and creates a [[abyss (religion)|bottomless pit]]: "and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace". The armies of [[Gog and Magog]], "the number of whom is as the sand of the sea" are mentioned in chapter 20, and paradise is referred to in chapter 21: "I saw a new heaven and a new earth ... the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband".

In the background of the painting is the [[Celestial City]], [[Jerusalem]], drawing elements from Martin's earlier historical and architectural paintings, with the [[Plains of Heaven]] behind.  The light of God pervades the work, with Christ sitting in judgement on the [[Throne of God]] in the centre, accompanied by 24 seated elders.  Four angels sound trumpets after the opening of the [[seventh seal]].

Below, a yawning chasm divides mankind into two parts: the "saved" are assembled on [[Mount Zion]] at God's right hand (that is, on the viewer's left) and the damned are gathered on the right.  The virtuous men, women and children of the saved include portraits of around 40 famous people, many of which are painted on slips of paper that were pasted onto the canvas like a [[collage]], awaiting their turn to appear before the throne.   An engraved key was published in 1855 identifying the principal figures among the saved, including many artists, writers and scientists such as [[Thomas More]], [[John Wesley|Wesley]], [[Cnut the Great|Canute]], [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]], [[George Washington|Washington]], [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]], [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and [[James Watt|Watt]].

The damned include richly dressed women, notably [[Salome]] daughter of [[Herodias]], and the [[whore of Babylon]], and also lawyers and clergymen, including a bishop and a pope.  A railway train with carriages labelled "London" and "Paris" tumbles into the bottomless pit.  The forces of [[Satan]] are being defeated, with the armies of [[Gog and Magog]] also falling into the abyss. 

The painting shows the time when "Heaven and Earth are passing away, and all things are made new."  According to Mary L. Pendered's 1923 book ''John Martin, Painter: His Life and Times'', Martin originally intended to call the painting ''All Things Made New''.

The painting was retained by Martin's family after his death until it was sold in 1935.  It was acquired by Robert Frank in 1947, inherited by his wife Charlotte Frank in 1953, and left to the Tate Gallery in memory of her husband in 1974.

==''The Great Day of His Wrath''==
{{main|The Great Day of His Wrath}}

The second work in the triptych, ''The Great Day of His Wrath'', was intended to be hung to the right of ''The Last Judgement'', and continues the theme of destruction and damnation depicted on the right side of the central image.

The Book of Revelation describes a scene that is painted by Martin: "... and, lo, there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood. And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and island were moved out of their places."   The collapsing pile of rocks to the right of the painting are the buildings of an entire city falling into an abyss.

The oil on canvas work measures {{convert|196.5|cm|in}} by {{convert|303.2|cm|in}}.  It was bought by the Tate Gallery in 1945.

==''The Plains of Heaven''==
The third work in the triptych, ''The Plains of Heaven'' was intended to be hung to the left of ''The Last Judgement'', and continues the pastoral landscape occupied by the "saved" on the left side of the central image.

The landscape resembles the Italian views painted by [[J. M. W. Turner]], with serene open vistas of greenery.  Martin painted similar landscapes in watercolours around 1850; examples include ''The Traveller'' and ''Joshua spying out the Land of Canaan''.  The scene resembles Martin's 1841 painting of ''The Celestial City and River of Bliss''.

The oil on canvas work measures {{convert|198.8|cm|in}} by {{convert|306.7|cm|in}}. Along with ''The Last Judgement'', the painting was left to the Tate on the death of Charlotte Frank in 1974, in memory of her husband Robert Frank.

==Reception==
Martin signed an agreement with the publisher and printseller [[Thomas Maclean]] in June 1851, under which Martin's painting ''The Great Day of His Wrath'' would be [[engraving|engraved]] and the painting would be exhibited to publicise subscriptions for the print. Maclean was to retain two thirds of the net profits from the print, with Martin receiving one third.  The painting was sent to the engraver, [[Charles Mottram]], by the end of 1851.  Martin probably started work on the second and third paintings before the end of 1851, and a second agreement for their engraving was signed on 23 June 1852.

Martin suffered a [[stroke]] in November 1853, and died on 17 February 1854.  Seven days earlier, the pictures were first exhibited together in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], where they were shown at the Victoria Rooms in Grey Street from 10 February to 4 March 1854 (''The Last Judgement'' had been put on display on its own at Maclean's gallery in London in June 1853).  The paintings were accompanied by an explanatory pamphlet, a technique that Martin has used with his earlier Biblical pictures.  The paintings went on an extensive tour of provincial cities, including Glasgow, Edinburgh, York, Hull, Leeds, Oxford, Birmingham, Liverpool, Huddersfield, Sheffield, Leicester, Bristol and Chester.  There was initially some suggestion that the paintings were unfinished, but they were signed by Martin and he had consented to the tour, although Maclean had considerable rights over them under his agreement with Martin. The painting were exhibited in London in May 1855, at the [[Hall of Commerce]] at 52 [[Threadneedle Street]].

''[[The Morning Post]]'' of 3 May 1855 greatly admired them: 'the simple grandeur of the conception, the broad artistic arrangement, and the wonderfully inventive faculty in detail. ..will serve to place the fame of Martin in a much higher position than any of his former labours'.

The paintings visited Dublin in March 1856, and the United States in 1857.  The Mottram [[mezzotint]] engravings were finally published in 1857, in New York and London.  The paintings were back in London in 1860, at [[Mabley's]] in [[Strand, London|the Strand]].  Tours of Britain continued for more than a decade, with the last recorded exhibition in Hexham in 1872.  They were exhibited in Australia in 1878-9, where they were shown in at a gallery in Melbourne and were included unofficially in the British Court at the [[Sydney International Exhibition]].  [[Sydney International Exhibition (1879)]]

It has been claimed that up to eight million people viewed the paintings during the extensive tours.

==Ownership==
The ownership of the paintings after Martin's death remains unclear.  They are not mentioned in his will, and the agreement with Maclean (which gave Mclean two thirds of the profits from the sale of prints, and the right to use the paintings to market the prints) meant that they were on tour for decades.  It seems likely that they were bequeathed to a cousin, Maria Thompson, who had married the son of the Thomas Wilson, his host during his regular visits to the Isle of Man and who nursed him in his final illness.  There was also a family connection - the Thomas Wilson was married to the sister of Martin's wife.

The works remained in the extended Wilson-Martin family - in the possession of the artist's son Charles by about 1872 - and his son Thomas Carew Hunt Martin lent the paintings for an exhibition at [[Earls Court]] in 1897. They were repeatedly put up for sale by auction but there were no buyers.  By the 1890s, they were displayed "in a dingy room" at [[Alexandra Palace]], and then on the staircase at the [[Dore Gallery]] from around 1900 to the 1920s.  By 1923, they had been taken out of their frames and were rolled up and stored in a warehouse.  They were sold at auction in 1935 for £7 by [[Rex Nan Kivell]], manager of the [[Redfern Gallery]].  The Tate bought ''The Great Day of his Wrath'' from Kivnell in 1945.  After the sale, ''The Last Judgement'' was cut into four strips to decorate a screen.  It was acquired by Robert Frank in 1947 and restored.  Frank also acquired ''The Plains of Heaven''.  The triptych was reassembled at the Tate Gallery in 1974 after Charlotte Frank donated the two other works following the death of her husband, Robert Frank.

'''''View from Mount Holyoke, Northampton, Massachusetts, after a Thunderstorm''''', commonly known as '''''The Oxbow''''', is a seminal landscape [[painting]] by [[Thomas Cole]], founder of the [[Hudson River School]]. The painting depicts a Romantic panorama of the Connecticut River Valley just after a thunderstorm. It has been interpreted as a confrontation between wilderness and civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Angela|title=The Empire of the Eye|year=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|isbn=0-8014-2830-0|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Background==
Between 1833 and 1836, American painter and putative "founder" of ''The Hudson River School,'' Thomas Cole, had been hard at work on his series of paintings ''[[The Course of Empire (paintings)|The Course of Empire]]''. The work was commissioned by New York patron [[Luman Reed]], who had met Cole in 1832, and the two held a friendship largely based on Reed's generosity in buying Cole's paintings. Reed requested ''The Course of Empire'' to comprise no less than five paintings of a historic composition. Cole himself was excited by such a project, but doubt began to set in by the end of 1835. The work was slow and laborious, and Cole found great difficulty in painting the figures. Reed had begun to notice Cole was becoming lonely and depressed, and suggested that he suspend work on ''The Course of Empire'' and paint something that was more in his element for the April 1836 opening of the [[National Academy of Design]]'s annual exhibition. Cole, in replying to Reed in a letter, stated that he felt obliged to finish the series as Reed had been so generous in his support, and instead suggested that he simply complete the last painting in the series and display that at the exhibition. Reed however, did not really like the idea, as he thought it might spoil the unveiling of the series as a whole. He suggested instead that he paint a picture much like the already completed second painting in the series, ''The Pastoral State''. This depicted a peaceful setting which Reed thought "no man ever produced a more pleasing landscape in a more pleasing season." Responding in a letter in March 1836, Cole agreed to take Reed's advice and paint a picture for the exhibition, writing:&lt;ref name=met&gt;Roque, Oswaldo Rodriguez (1982). ''"The Oxbow" by Thomas Cole: Iconography of an American Landscape Painting''. Metropolitan Museum Journal. pp. 63–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Fancy pictures]] seldom sell &amp; they generally take more time than views so I have determined to paint one of the latter.  I have already commenced a view from [[Mount Holyoke|Mt. Holyoke]]&amp;mdash;it is about the finest scene I have in my sketchbook &amp; is well known&amp;mdash;it will be novel and I think effective&amp;mdash;I could not find a subject very similar to your second picture &amp; time would not allow me to invent one.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Cole also comments that he used a larger canvas, as he was not able to ready a smaller frame in time for the exhibition, and moreover felt compelled to make a statement with the one painting he was to present.&lt;ref name=met/&gt;

==Composition==
The painting moves from a dark wilderness with shattered tree trunks on rugged cliffs in the foreground covered with violent rain clouds on the left to a light-filled and peaceful, cultivated landscape on the right, which borders the tranquility of the bending [[Connecticut River]]. In returning to painting landscapes, Cole was faced with the dichotomy of the untamed wilderness and land cultivated by man. While other painters of the [[Hudson River School]] would merge the two peacefully, Cole did not shy away from portraying the two as opposites and showing how the cultivation would destroy the natural wilderness, and as a result never meet in the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Flexner, James T (1998). ''Random Harvest''. Fordham University Press. p. 145. {{ISBN|0-8232-1731-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the hill in the far background, logging scars in the forest can be observed, which appear to form [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letters]]. This was first noticed by Matthew Baigell long after the landscape was painted. It reads as [[Noah]] (נֹ֫חַ) If viewed upside down, as if from God's perspective, the word ''[[El Shaddai|Shaddai]]'' is formed, "The Almighty." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://picturingamerica.neh.gov/downloads/pdfs/Resource_Guide_Chapters/PictAmer_Resource_Book_Chapter_5A.pdf|title=View from Mount Holyoke (The Oxbow), 1836|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cole gives himself a tiny [[self-portrait]] sitting on the rocks in the foreground with his easel.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmerding, John (2003). ''Signs of the Artist: Signatures and Self-expression in American Paintings''. Yale University Press. p. 58. {{ISBN|0-300-09779-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
Cole sold the painting at the exhibition to Charles Nicoll Talbot (1802–1874), merchant in the [[Economic history of China|China trade]].&lt;ref&gt;David Bjelajac, "Thomas Cole's ''Oxbow'' and the American Zion Divided", ''American Art'' '''20''' (2006), pp60–83.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838 he lent it to the Dunlap Benefit Exhibition, and later to the third annual exhibition of the Artists' Fund Society, which was held in New York in 1862. With his death in 1874, the painting was acquired from his estate by [[Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage]], wife of [[Russell Sage]]. Olivia Sage was a known philanthropist, and her transfer of ''The Oxbow'' to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1908 would seem rather natural.  However, she may have been inspired by a similar gesture in 1904 by Samuel P. Avery, Jr., who donated ''[[The Titan's Goblet]]'', another of Cole's well-known paintings, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Furthermore, Olivia Sage's attorney, [[Robert W. DeForest]], was a secretary on the Board of Trustees of the Metropolitan Museum. The painting today resides in The Metropolitan Museum of Art.&lt;ref&gt;Parry III, Ellwood C (2003).

'''''The Red Vineyards near Arles''''' is an oil painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Vincent van Gogh]], executed on a privately primed [[French Standard Sizes for Oil paintings|Toile de 30]] piece of burlap in early November 1888. It depicts workers in a [[vineyard]], and is believed to be the only van Gogh painting sold during his lifetime. 

It has been listed among the artist's major works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lj75DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT89|title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide Russia|publisher=Penguin|date=2016|isbn=1465462635|quote=[...] but the real masterpieces are upstairs. On the second floor are paintings by Vincent van Gogh, including ''The Red Vineyard at Arles'' (1888) and ''Prisoners Exercising'' (1890) [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''The Red Vineyard'' was exhibited for the first time at the [[Vincent van Gogh's display at Les XX, 1890|annual exhibition of Les XX, 1890]] in Brussels, and sold for 400 Francs (equal to about [[USD|$]]2,000 today) to [[Anna Boch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://annaboch.com|title=Anna Boch.com  Impressionist, patron of many artists|website=annaboch.com|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; an impressionist painter, member of [[Les XX]] and art collector from Belgium;&lt;ref&gt;Hulsker (1980), 356&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pickvance (1984), 168–169;206&lt;/ref&gt; Anna was the sister of [[Eugène Boch]], another impressionist painter and a friend of Van Gogh, too, who had painted Boch's portrait (''[[Portrait of Eugene Boch|Le Peintre aux Étoiles]]'') in [[Arles]], in autumn 1888. 

It was acquired by the famous Russian collector [[Ivan Morozov|Sergei Shchukin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://annaboch.com/theredvineyard/|title=The Red Vineyard by Vincent van Gogh - World's most valuable painting|website=annaboch.com|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was later nationalised by the [[Bolsheviks]] with the rest of his collection, which eventually passed to the [[Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Moscow]], where is resides today.

'''''Tokion''''' was a Japanese-based magazine covering art, fashion, music and film first published in Japan in 1996, followed by [[United States]], UK, and [[Hong Kong]] editions. The magazine's makers also produced the annual Creativity Now Conference, a weekend-long seminar of panel discussions with speakers from across the creative spectrum.

== History ==
The magazine was started in 1996 by Lucas Badtke-Berkow and Adam Glickman, two American [[expatriates]] living in Japan, as a cultural bridge between [[Japan]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=neoj&gt;{{cite news|title=On the New Japanese Tokion|url=http://neojaponisme.com/2006/09/18/on-the-new-japanese-tokion/|accessdate=29 November 2015|work=Neo Japonisme|date=18 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, ''Tokion'' opened an American office in [[Los Angeles]]. In 2000 it moved into a retail space/office in [[New York City]], while maintaining a retail space/office in Tokyo. While in New York, the magazine's focus shifted from Japanese-influenced content to street culture aesthetics and then to a more global arts magazine featuring interviews with recognized artists such as  [[Lou Reed]], [[Richard Prince]], [[James Brown]], [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Roger Corman]], [[Ed Ruscha]] and [[Jeff Koons]], while continuing to cover up-and-coming artists such as [[Harmony Korine]], [[Miranda July]], [[Cory Arcangel]] and Simone Shubuck.

In 2002, Badtke-Berkow sold his share in the magazine to Glickman. Badtke-Berkow began publishing Papersky and Mammoth magazines in Japan, while Glickman began publishing Japanese and US editions. In 2005, the Japanese edition was sold to Infas Publishing Company. In 2006, the American edition was sold to independent publisher Larry Rosenblum. In 2009, ''Tokion'' and Creativity Now were sold out of foreclosure to Donald Hellinger, president of Nylon Holding, Inc.. In 2010 the magazine was renamed ''Factory'' in the US.&lt;ref name=neoj /&gt;

This psychological effect is often used in the [[Cinematography|cinema]], where an [[actor]] will be shown apparently looking at himself or herself in the mirror. What viewers see is different from what the actor sees, because the camera is not right behind the actor, but the position of the actor is often chosen so that his or her image is nicely framed in the mirror for the camera.

Although the name of the effect refers to a woman, [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the effect is more general. The effect is seen with an animal apparently looking at itself in a mirror in [[La Dame à la Licorne|''The Lady and the Unicorn'' (French: ''La Dame à la licorne'')]] tapestries, where the unicorn appears to be gazing at its own reflection as it kneels on the ground.

Bertamini et al. (2010) conducted additional studies and confirmed that the Venus effect also occurs with photographs, and in real life when the person and the mirror are seen in a room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Founded and run by couple [[William Christopher Ellis|William Ellis]] and [[Jordan Tannahill]], who converted it from an old barbershop, the space became an influential hub for [[queer]] counterculture in the city.&lt;ref name=fab&gt;[http://www.fabmagazine.com/fab-blog/videofag "Videofags: A new queer art space in Kensington - ready to blow your mind"]. ''[[Fab (magazine)|fab]]'', October 17, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A flexible [[multimedia]] space, Videofag was designed to serve as a cinema, art gallery, nightclub or theatre space depending on the needs of any individual event.&lt;ref name=karasik&gt;[http://torontoist.com/?post_type=event&amp;p=253039&amp;preview=true&amp;eo_month=2013-06 "The Biographer Is a Great First Draft"].

''[[Xtra!]]'', November 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Videofag often acted as a laboratory, in which artists were gifted residencies to explore new ideas.
