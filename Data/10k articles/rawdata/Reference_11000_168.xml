'''Astrodatabank''' is a [[wiki]] website containing a collection of [[Astrology|astrological]] data. The freely accessible database features the birth details and associated [[Horoscope|birth charts]] of public figures and mundane events. The collection was started by astrologer, [[Lois Rodden]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=jsG2Fy-OtJEC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;dq=ancient+astrodatabank&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5Ws2qUCCsv&amp;sig=oa3n3_H8w2bgiw3nKzJl2NNyNkw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ancient%20astrodatabank&amp;f=false|title=Astrology and Aptitude: How to Become What You Were Meant to Be|first=Kim|last=Falconer|date=2005|publisher=[[American Federation of Astrologers]]|quote=Lois Rodden, astrologer, author and founder of Astrodatabank research}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1979.  Astrodatabank is currently owned and maintained by the Swiss company Astrodienst and is published in English.

== History ==

In 1979, Lois Rodden started publishing birth data with her book, Profiles of Women.  Eventually this led onto the formation of Astrodatabank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=t0GvUz1oexQC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;lpg=PR9&amp;dq=Mark+McDonough+astrodatabank&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O_s9W3S1gE&amp;sig=-I_YP_lzUZqyUwj2y51zlap80mY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjN78yXrOPOAhXIgI8KHS0YCU84ChDoAQgcMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Mark%20McDonough%20astrodatabank&amp;f=false|title=Acknowledgements|work=Mapping Your Birthchart: Understanding Your Needs &amp; Potential access,Stephanie Clement, Cosmic Patterns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TECH/science/9806/05/t_t/high.tech.horoscope/|title= Astrologers goes High-Tech|publisher=CNN|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/08/magazine/suddenly-popular.html?pagewanted=all|title=Suddenly popular, Mark McDonough, astrological-database,Web sites he built|publisher=The New York Times|date= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark McDonough&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kepler.edu/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=35:individual-donors&amp;catid=41:donors&amp;Itemid=135|title=McDonough|work=[[Kepler College]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed the Astrodatabank database work using the astrology birth data collected by Lois Rodden over 40 years of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=zLca-R5aLzIC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=business+astrodatabank&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lZn96hlsE8&amp;sig=oK987DTrWzsSwU1-osKVZqGDp0Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBmafO4_XOAhVEqo8KHcHqCso4ChDoAQgwMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=business%20astrodatabank&amp;f=false|title=Lois Rodden,business partner Mark McDonough,runs the software|work=Soul Mate Astrology,Trish MacGregor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six months before Lois Rodden died, Lois named Pat Taglilatelo as her successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncgrbostonastrology.org/board.php|title=Pat Taglilatelo worked as an editor of Astrodatabank,from 2003|work=The National Council for Geocosmic Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data collection of another lifelong collector, [[Edwin Charles Steinbrecher]], was integrated into the database during the next two years.

In July 2005, McDonough gave Richard Smoot ownership of the company. Astrodatabank was later  bought by the Swiss company Astrodienst AG, of Alois Treindl, in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.com/people/treindl_tarriktar_e.htm|title=A conversation with Alois Treindl|publisher=The Mountain Astrologer|first=Tem|last=Tarrktar|quote= AstroDatabank is a huge service to the whole field.|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and converted into a wiki project and made freely accessible to all.&lt;ref&gt;

Astrodatabank as a [[wiki]] was released on 12 March 2009, with  72,271 pages, in English. The names Astrodatabank, Astro-Databank, AstroDatabank, and ADB refer to the one and same project Astrodatabank.&lt;ref&gt;

Researchers have imported Astrodatabank birth chart data into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences ([[SPSS]]) for analysis. They claim that Astrodatabank sets the standards for rigorous astrological methodology and meet social scientific research design standards.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''''Auctoritates Aristotelis''''' ("Authoritative [passages of] [[Aristotle]]") was a popular [[florilegium]] (anthology of brief extracts) composed around the end of the thirteenth century by the [[Franciscan]] scholar [[Johannes de Fonte]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamesse 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

This large collection of ''sententiae'' (opinions) derived from [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] texts was compiled around 1300 by de Fonte while he was a lector in theology at the Franciscan convent in [[Montpellier]]. He says in the prologue that his work is intended to provide assistance ‚Äúas much for preaching to the people as study of the arts.‚Äù The work enjoyed a wide circulation,  providing a convenient way to access Aristotle's philosophy, or to embellish a composition or sermon with quotations from his work.

{{Globalize/US|date=May 2013}}

'''Bicultural identity''' is the condition of being oneself regarding the combination of two cultures. The term can also be defined as [[biculturalism]], which is the presence of two different cultures in the same country or region. As a general term, culture involves the behaviors and belief characteristics of a particular social, ethnic, or age group. Within culture, we have cultural effects, which are the shared behaviors and customs we learn from the institutions around us. An example of a cultural effect would be how an individual‚Äôs personality is strongly influenced by the biological and social norms he is exposed to. Another cultural effect would be that in some societies it would be more [[acceptable]] to dress or act in a certain way.

In regards to bicultural identity, an individual may face conflict assimilating into both cultures or finding a balance between both. An individual may face challenges assimilating into the whole, collective culture. Similarly, an individual may face difficulty balancing their identity within themselves due to the influence of both of their cultures. Being an individual with identity plurality can be hard mentally and emotionally. The different levels of biculturalism can be defined though the way people are able to simultaneously manage their two selves. The more they alternate between them, the more cognitive complexity they face, since they avoid cultural duality and do not practice handling both cultures at the same time. It is through identity integration that they will be able to solve the problem and alleviate the tolls that come with identity plurality &lt;ref&gt;Kramer, T., Lau-Gesk, L., &amp; Chiu, C. (2009). The interactive effects of duality expertise and coping frames on responses to ambivalent messages. Journal of Consumer Psychology (Elsevier Science), 19(4), 661-672.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fitzsimmons, S. R. (2013). Multicultural employees: a framework for understanding how they contribute to organizations. Academy of Management Review, 38(4), 525-549&lt;/ref&gt; Bicultural identity also may have positive effects on the individual, in terms of the additional knowledge they acquire from belonging to more than one culture. Furthermore, with the growing number of racial minorities in American society, individuals that identify with more than one culture may have more linguistic ability.

== Biculturalism  and personality ==

Culture affects the personality of an individual because the individual may react in a way that is reflective of the knowledge one acquires from one or more culture(s). Problems may arise when ideals in one culture are not connected to another culture, which may cause generalizations about personality. Personality is shaped by both cultures and thus generalizations should not be made based on one single culture.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, H. (2012). Personality: Classic theories and modern research. Pearson Higher Education: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; One‚Äôs culture also influences one‚Äôs hormonal changes, one‚Äôs interaction with violence and one‚Äôs family values. For example, Hispanic American culture often requires older children to take care and/or help raise younger siblings, while mainstream American culture interprets parents as the sole caregivers. Another example of this difference would be religious preference and or practice. Cultures other than the American culture may often identify more with certain religions and are often more in tune with their religious beliefs.

== Measuring bicultural identity ==

=== Bicultural Identity Integration ===

One construct to measure bicultural identity is the Bicultural Identity Integration (BII) construct. It is a relatively new construct and was proposed in 2002 by Benet-Mart√≠nez, Leu, Lee &amp; Morris. The BII looks at how the bicultural individual perceives his bicultural identities and whether they are compatible or oppositional. It also seeks to identify the big five aspects of an individual‚Äôs personality, including aspects such as sociability, activity and emotionality.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez, V., J.; Haritatos (2002). "Bicultural Identity Integration (BII): Components and psychosocial antecedents". Journal of Personality 73: 1015-1050.&lt;/ref&gt; The BII seeks to find whether an individual has a cultural distance or conflict within one‚Äôs cultures, which in turn helps indicate how biculturally competent we are.

Low BII bicultural individuals have difficulties in incorporating both cultures into a cohesive identity and tend to see both cultures as highly dissimilar. Bicultural individuals with high BII on the other hand, see their identities as complementary and themselves as part of a ‚Äúthird‚Äù culture, which integrates elements from both their cultures.
According to Margaret Mead, a cultural anthropologist, individuals respond in a more stable fashion when their cultural contexts are understood. 
Researchers wanted to examine how these differences could relate to other factors and the results are insightful. BII is significantly associated with the psychological and social adjustments of the bicultural. Low BII bicultural individuals are found to have inferior bilingual proficiency, experience more anxiety, depression and are more neurotic and less open than bicultural individuals with high BII.
More importantly, low BII bicultural individuals are not chameleon-like. They resist the frame switching and are more likely to respond in ways inconsistent with the cultural cues. In other words, when low BII Chinese-Americans are presented with American cues, unlike high BII bicultural individuals, they would not behave like Americans but instead, more like a Chinese.
However, the identity struggle for bicultural individuals can be made less arduous. It is important to note that like other personality traits, BII is malleable to contextual factors. BII can be increased by asking bicultural individuals to recall positive cross-cultural exchanges or like in another study, make high-level construals. These findings can be useful in for example, helping immigrants to cope with their new environment.

== Bicultural identity and language ==

[[Language]] is an essential aspect of any culture. Individuals are able to maintain key aspects of their culture by maintaining their culture‚Äôs language. Language is important because it is an oral form of how people interact with other people within a society. Language reinforces the ties among the people who speak the same language, and thus encourages cultural bonding.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, S.. "Two languages, two personalities? Examining language effects on personality in the bilingual context.". Unpublished doctoral dissertation.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, by preserving the language within both of one‚Äôs cultures, one can maintain one‚Äôs integration within each culture. However, this can result in a difficulty in integrating one‚Äôs cultures if each has a distinct, different language as it can prevent outsiders from understanding that particular culture.

=== Cultural frame switching ===

The concept of cultural frame switching (CFS) or [[double consciousness]] made popular by [[W.E.B Du Bois]] addresses how an individual switches between cultural frames or systems in response to their environment. The presence of culture-specific peers can elicit culture-specific values.&lt;ref&gt;Benet-Martinez, V., J., F., M.; Leu, Lee, Morris (2002). "Negotiating biculturalism: Cultural frame switching in biculturals with oppositional versus compatible cultural identities". Journal of Cross-cultural Psychology 33: 492‚Äì516.&lt;/ref&gt; CFS can be used to describe the switching of different language use depending on the context. Thus, CFS can be connected to cultural accommodation, which is seen when bilinguals respond to situations with the language that applies best to the situation present. 
It is evident that language can have an effect on an individual‚Äôs thinking process; this is because the language itself primes the individual‚Äôs cultural values, attitudes and memory which in turn affects behavior. Thus, language has a powerful effect on the way in which an individual responds to change.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

== Cultural perspectives ==

=== African American culture ===

[[African American]] culture is also known as black culture in the [[United States]] and the identity of African American culture is rooted in the historical experience of the African American people. It is rooted in [[Africa]], and is a blend of sub-Saharan African and Sahelean cultures. Due to aspects of African American culture that were accentuated by the slavery period, African American culture is dynamic. 
Within the African American culture, race or physical differences led to mass murder, and violence against racial groups. These occurrences may affect an individual‚Äôs perception of their African American culture. 
In America, Black and White differences are the most significant groupings largely because of American history. The US was founded on the principle of ‚Äúall men are equal‚Äù and yet slavery existed. This is what resulted in the [[American Dilemma]]. Thus, due to historical reasons, and because they are often stereotyped, African Americans have difficulty assimilating with their culture and American culture.&lt;ref&gt;Guan, M., F., E.; Lee, Cole (2012). "Complexity of culture: The role of identity and context in bicultural individuals' body ideals". Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology 18 (3): 247-257.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asian American culture ===

Individuals having origins within the Far East, Southeast Asia or the Indian subcontinent are referred to as Asian under the [[U.S. Census Bureau]]. [[Asian American]] complete 4.8% of the U.S. population alone. Asian Americans have had the highest educational attainment level and median household income of any racial demographic in the country and attain the highest median personal income overall, {{as of|2008|lc=y}}. Thus, Asian American Culture is often depicted as the most similar culture to American Culture.  
Asian Americans often communicate non-verbally and/or indirectly, and often are not as bold or upfront as other cultures in terms of their communication. The Asian American way of life is much more group-oriented or holistic and thus the way in which they interpret the world is systematically different from American Culture in terms of thought process and lifestyle. This may make it difficult for Asian Americans to assimilate easily into American culture.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

=== Hispanic American culture ===

[[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] have origins in the countries of Latin America and the Iberian Peninsula consisting of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]. Hispanic Americans are very racially diverse. Hispanics constitute 16.5% of the total United States population. 
Hispanic Americans often are very religiously oriented and focus on family values and the importance of intergenerational connections. This may cause difficulty in integration with American culture, as the Hispanic community often emphasizes the importance of helping one‚Äôs family and advancing as a family rather than simply individual success, which is more prominent within American Culture.&lt;ref&gt;Mok, A., M.; Morris (2012). "Bicultural self-defense in consumer contexts: Self-protection motives are the basis for contrast versus assimilation to cultural cues". Journal of Consumer Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Hispanics may have difficulty associating with American Culture because of the language culture, as most Hispanics can speak Spanish. The ability to speak Spanish is valued greatly within Hispanic culture, as it is greatly used during social gatherings and amongst extended family. The Spanish language is a significant part of Hispanic culture, and because of the vast amount of racial differences within Hispanic Americans, the way in which Spanish is spoken within the different racial groups is often different. This makes it not only difficult to assimilate into American culture but to often assimilate with the different races in Hispanic America.

== Immigrant experience ==

[[Immigrants]] particularly find it difficult to assimilate both their cultural contexts. Immigrants need to reconcile both their current host cultures and their culture of origin, which is where they grew up. Immigrants culturally evolve through a process of adaptation and assimilation. Immigrants are usually influenced by more dominant values that they have learned in their native cultures. Immigrants encounter a major upheaval by moving far away from home and sometimes may never find themselves connected to either culture. Immigrants face many [[stress (psychological)|stresses]], which can raise their risk for [[substance abuse]] and other psychological stressors.&lt;ref&gt;Dong, Q., D., J.; Gundlach, Phillips (2006). "The impact of bicultural identity on immigrant socialization through television viewing in the United States". Journal of Intercultural Communication Studies 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Developing a bicultural identity is involves blending two cultures together and learning to be competent within their two cultures. Immigrants and children of these individuals may be more at risk for victimization, poverty, and the need for assistance from the government. Immigrant parents for example may struggle to find a balance in their new lives and may be so busy keeping up with the demands that may be less involved in the community and in turn less involved with their child‚Äôs education.

With immigrants, language barriers may also bring hardship in terms of communication with natives of their less dominant culture. Immigrants may not adapt fully because of the language barriers holding them back from even simple conversation. [[Acculturation]] is the process in which a bicultural individual or immigrant adopts the social norms of the mainstream society. The cultural gap between immigrant parents and their children may widen due to acculturation because younger generations find it easier to adapt to the new culture. Family relations may be strained due to this issue. Children of immigrant parents may enjoy more [[mainstream]] culture, but may also want to stick to their families‚Äô roots in order to please their caregivers. Immigrants and bicultural families do have more positive roles as well. They have strong commitments to family and have a dream for a better life. This in turns gives families a sense of purpose and connection and makes the family unit stronger. Native customs such as holidays and religious affiliations may also support the family unit and promote unity all around.

== Integration ==

=== Social and workplace interactions ===

Individuals with bicultural identity face issues around stereotype threat. Others may be perceived negatively, or their judgments may in turn alter the way that one behaves in certain situations. For example, with standardized testing, African American students in low-income areas often do worse on a given test due to the expectations for them to do worse. Stereotype threat is so powerful that it may extend on to different areas of life, such as the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Mok, M., W.; Morris (2012). "Managing two cultural identities: The malleability of bicultural identity integration as a function of induced global or local processing". Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin 38 (2): 233-246.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a multidimensional concept that may affect an individual on many levels. Stereotype threat makes it harder for individuals to integrate successfully with their peers if they feel judged or feel pressures to exceed in certain ways especially if their dual cultural roles may be in conflict with one another. Thiese scenarios are contingent on an individual's success with [[acculturation]] strategies.

A bicultural individual's integration into a workplace also depends on the cultural makeup of his or her team. A team can be categorized as culturally homogenous, culturally diverse, or possessing a cultural faultline.&lt;ref&gt;Dau, L.A. (2016). ‚ÄúBiculturalism, Team Performance, and Cultural-faultline Bridges,‚Äù Journal of International Management 22 (1): 48-62.&lt;/ref&gt; A bicultural is more likely to integrate with a team, possessing the skills to form a cultural attachment with homogenous or heterogenous teams by traversing cultural barriers.

=== Family dynamics and integration ===

Caregivers also face a dilemma with their children who have bicultural identities; they want to instill pride in their children, but also must prepare their children for prejudice without making them feel inferior to other cultural groups. For example, African-American parents must socialize their children in such a manner where they will be prepared to face discrimination in society, but they also must preserve their culture in such a way that makes them feel prideful. This dilemma that parents face makes it harder for individuals to feel comfortable within social groups and may minimize the different cultures that individuals surround themselves with.&lt;ref&gt;Torres, V., S., L., C., A., E.; Martinez, Wallace, Medrano, Robledo, Hernandez (2012). "The connections between Latino ethnic identity and adult experiences". Adult Education Quarterly 62 (1): 3-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Some individuals can develop a more multicultural outlook and feel confident being around many kinds of people, whereas others may have an issue with this and may stick to their own cultural group.

== Academics and attitudes towards education ==

Academics within individuals with bicultural identity may also be aversely affected in terms of stereotype threat. An individual may lose motivation in a scholastic setting due to the negative expectations placed on them. Attitudes may change within academics if a student feels as though he cannot do well due to societal constraints on his particular culture. Although this may discourage some, specific tests have been made in order to integrate culture within standardized testing.

A system created by Jane Mercer, assumes that test results cannot be distanced from the culture and it focuses on comparisons among people within particular culture groups rather than between culture groups. This system has been applied to intelligence and ability examinations in order to combat the concern of disadvantaged minorities doing poorly due to their incapacity to do as well as their counterparts.

'''''Botany of the F√¶r√∂es''' based upon Danish investigations'' ‚Äì a three-volume classic scientific work on [[flora]] and [[vegetation]] of the [[Faroe Islands]], including [[fungi]], [[lichens]], [[algae]], [[bryophytes]] and [[vascular plants]]. It was published 1901 to 1908 and funded by the [[Carlsberg Foundation]]. The project was initiated by [[Eugen Warming]], who edited the content. The published work was based on investigations made chiefly between 1895 and 1900 by [[Frederik B√∏rgesen|F. B√∏rgesen]], [[Christian E.O. Jensen|C. Jensen]], [[Carl Hansen Ostenfeld|C.H. Ostenfeld]], J. Hartz, [[Helgi J√≥nsson|H. J√≥nsson]] and [[Eugenius Warming|Eug. Warming]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1719">'''Braddock's Battlefield History Center''' is a small American museum and visitors center on the site of the [[Battle of the Monongahela]] of 9 July 1755.

It features a collection of art, documents, and artifacts about the [[Braddock Expedition]] and the [[French and Indian War]] as it unfolded at the [[Forks of the Ohio]]. Located seven miles (10&amp;nbsp;km) east of downtown [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] in [[North Braddock, Pennsylvania]], it is housed in a renovated car dealership along with a small gymnastics company on a three-acre parcel on a hillside that overlooks the [[Monongahela River]] Valley and the historic [[Edgar Thomson Works]] of [[United States Steel]].

The museum was created by Robert T. Messner, a retired Pittsburgh lawyer and grandfather, with the support of local foundations, and it opened to the public on 18 August 2012.

{{Computer form factors}}
In [[computing]], the '''form factor''' is the specification of a [[motherboard]] ‚Äì the dimensions, power supply type, location of mounting holes, number of ports on the back panel, etc. Specifically, in the [[IBM PC compatible]] industry, standard form factors ensure that parts are interchangeable across competing vendors and generations of technology, while in enterprise computing, form factors ensure that server modules fit into existing [[rackmount]] systems. Traditionally, the most significant specification is for that of the motherboard, which generally dictates the overall size of the [[computer case|case]]. [[Small form factor]]s have been developed and implemented.

== Overview of form factors ==
[[File:VIA Mini-ITX Form Factor Comparison.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Comparison of some common [[motherboard]] form factors]]
A [[PC motherboard]] is the main [[printed circuit board|circuit board]] within a typical [[desktop computer]], [[laptop]] or [[server (computing)|server]]. Its main functions are as follows:
* To serve as a central backbone to which all other modular parts such as [[CPU]], [[RAM]], and [[hard drive]]s can be attached as required to create a computer
* To be interchangeable (in most cases) with different components (in particular CPU and [[expansion card]]s) for the purposes of customization and upgrading
* To distribute [[power supply unit (computer)|power]] to other circuit boards
* To electronically co-ordinate and interface the operation of the components
As new generations of components have been developed, the standards of motherboards have changed too. For example, the introduction of [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]] and, more recently, [[PCI Express]] have influenced motherboard design. However, the standardized size and layout of motherboards have changed much more slowly and are controlled by their own standards. The list of components required on a motherboard changes far more slowly than the components themselves. For example, [[Northbridge (computing)|north bridge]] microchips have changed many times since their introduction with many manufacturers bringing out their own versions, but in terms of form factor standards, provisions for north bridges have remained fairly static for many years.

Although it is a slower process, form factors do evolve regularly in response to changing demands. IBM's long-standing standard, [[AT (form factor)|AT]] (Advanced Technology), was superseded in 1995 by the current industry standard [[ATX]] (Advanced Technology Extended), which still governs the size and design of the motherboard in most modern PCs. The latest update to the ATX standard was released in 2007. A divergent standard by [[chipset]] manufacturer [[VIA Technologies|VIA]] called [[EPIA]] (also known as ITX, and not to be confused with EPIC) is based upon smaller form factors and its own standards.

Differences between form factors are most apparent in terms of their intended market sector, and involve variations in size, design compromises and typical features. Most modern computers have very similar requirements, so form factor differences tend to be based upon subsets and supersets of these. For example, a desktop computer may require more sockets for maximum flexibility and many optional connectors and other features on board, whereas a computer to be used in a [[multimedia]] system may need to be optimized for heat and size, with additional plug-in cards being less common. The smallest motherboards may sacrifice CPU flexibility in favor of a fixed manufacturer's choice.

== PC/104 and EBX ==
[[PC/104]] is an embedded computer standard which defines both a form factor and computer bus. PC/104 is intended for embedded computing environments. Single board computers built to this form factor are often sold by [[Commercial off-the-shelf|COTS]] vendors, which benefits users who want a customized rugged system, without months of design and paper work.

The PC/104 form factor was standardized by the PC/104 Consortium in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PC/104 Embedded Consortium's History |url=http://www.pc104.org/history.html |accessdate=2008-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211094103/http://www.pc104.org/history.html |archivedate=2008-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An IEEE standard corresponding to PC/104 was drafted as IEEE P996.1, but never ratified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Angel| first = Jonathan|  title = Open standard defines tiny expansion modules| publisher = LinuxDevices.com| date = 2010-02-01| url = http://archive.linuxgizmos.com/open-standard-defines-tiny-expansion-modules/| accessdate = 2014-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 5.75&amp;nbsp;√ó&amp;nbsp;8.0&amp;nbsp;in [[Embedded Board eXpandable]] (EBX) specification, which was derived from Ampro's proprietary Little Board form-factor, resulted from a collaboration between Ampro and [[Motorola Computer Group]].

As compared with PC/104 modules, these larger (but still reasonably embeddable) SBCs tend to have everything of a full PC on them, including application oriented interfaces like audio, analog, or digital I/O in many cases. Also it's much easier to fit Pentium CPUs, whereas it's a tight squeeze (or expensive) to do so on a PC/104 SBC. Typically, EBX SBCs contain: the CPU; upgradeable RAM subassemblies (e.g., DIMM); Flash memory for solid state drive; multiple USB, serial, and parallel ports; onboard expansion via a PC/104 module stack; off-board expansion via ISA and/or PCI buses (from the PC/104 connectors); networking interface (typically Ethernet); and video (typically CRT, LCD, and TV).

== Mini PC ==
[[Mini PC]] is a [[Personal computer|PC]] small form factor very close in size to an external [[CD]] or [[DVD]] [[disk drive|drive]]. Mini PCs have proven popular for use as [[Home theater PC|HTPCs]].

The term '''cross-reference''' can refer to either:
* An instance within a [[document]] which refers to related information elsewhere in the same document. In both printed and online dictionaries cross-references are important because they form a network structure of relations existing between different parts of data, dictionary-internal as well as dictionary external.&lt;ref&gt;Sandro Nielsen (1999): "Mediostructures in Bilingual LSP Dictionaries." In: ''Lexicographica. International Annual for Lexicography'' 15, 90‚Äì113.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In an [[Index (publishing)|index]], a cross reference is often denoted by ''See also''.  For example, under the term ''Albert Einstein'' in the index of a book about Nobel Laureates, there may be the cross-reference ''See also: Einstein, Albert''.
* In [[hypertext]], cross-referencing is maintained to a document with either in-context (XRIC) or out-of-context (''XROC'') cross-referencing.  These are similar to [[Key Word in Context|KWIC and KWOC]].
* In programming, "cross-referencing" means the listing of every file name and line number where a given [[identifier#In computer science|named identifier]] occurs within the program's [[source tree]].
* In a [[relational database management system]], a table can have an xref as prefix or suffix to indicate it is a [[cross-reference table]] that joins two or more tables together via [[primary key]].

== Structure of a cross reference ==
In a document, especially those authored in a [[Content management system]],
a cross-reference has two major aspects:
* A visible form that appears when the document is presented to the reader
* A technical mechanism that resides within the system

The visible form contains text, graphics, and other indications that:
* Enable the reader to follow the cross reference to the referenced content
* May enable the reader to understand what is being referred to, or what to expect upon following the reference
* May present to the reader some information from the referenced content

The technical mechanism that resides within the system:
* Identifies what location is being referred to
* Permits the system to present appropriate referencing text when the location containing the reference is presented to a reader
* Permits the system to offer a control (such as a link) that a reader can use when the content is presented in electronic form to access the referenced content

== How cross references contribute to usability of a document or set of documents ==
If the cross reference mechanism is well designed, the reader will be able to follow each cross reference to the referenced content whether the content is presented in print or electronically.

An author working in a content management system is responsible for identifying subjects of interest that cross documents, and creating appropriate systems of cross references to support readers who seek to understand those subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rockley|first1=Ann|last2=Cooper|first2=Charles|title=Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy|date=2012|publisher=New Riders|isbn=978-0321815361|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an individual cross reference, an author should ensure that location and content of the target of the cross reference are clearly identified, and the reader can easily determine how to follow the cross reference in each medium in which publication is supported.

[[Content strategy]] practitioners (known as content strategists) specialize in planning content to meet business needs, taking into account the processes for creating and maintaining the content, and the systems that support the content.

The '''De Wild family''' was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] family of [[art]] [[professionals]], including [[conservator-restorer]]s, [[art dealers]], [[painter]]s, and [[connoisseur]]s.&lt;ref name=ac&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van Duijn |first1=Esther |last2=Te Marvelde |first2=Mireille |date={{date|2016-10|mdy}} |title=The Art of Conservation VII: Hopman and De Wild: The historical importance of two Dutch families of restorers |url=http://burlington.org.uk/archive/back-issues/201610 |journal=Burlington Magazine |volume=158 |issue=1363 |pages=812‚Äì823 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent internationally in the late nineteenth century and into the twentieth century, they were especially known for their advances in [[Painting restoration|art restoration]].

==Carel de Wild==
Carel de Wild was born on August 26, 1870, to Angenita Mertina Visser de Wild of [[Kessel, Limburg]].&lt;ref name=wi&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date={{date|1922-5-27|mdy}} |title=Professor de Wild's Will |jstor=25589977 |journal=American Art News |volume=20 |issue=33 |pages=5 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=es&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Household furniture, important paintings &amp; objects of art : from the estate of the late Carel F.

===United States===
After working with [[Goupil &amp; Cie]] in [[Paris]],&lt;ref name=es /&gt; Carel received an offer to work as an advisor and restorer with art dealing institution [[Knoedler]] &amp; Co, and departed for the [[United States]] in 1911.&lt;ref name=ob /&gt; During his time with Knoedler &amp; Co., and subsequently at the independent practice on [[Fifth Avenue]] he opened in 1916, he worked closely with American [[industrialists]] [[Henry Clay Frick]], [[Joseph Widener]],&lt;ref name=wf&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date={{date|1918-12-14|mdy}} |title=That Phila.

==Derix de Wild==
After Carel's departure for the [[United States]] in 1911, the Haarlem Committee of Supervision nominated his older brother, Derix, to continue restoring the city's twelve Hals group portraits.&lt;ref name=ac /&gt;&lt;ref name=ba&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Wild |first1=Derix |last2= |first2= |date={{date|1924-9|mdy}} |title=The Cleaning of the Frans Hals Pictures at Haarlem |url= |journal=Bulletin of the Bachstitz Gallery |volume=7 |issue=8 |pages= |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Carel, he worked at the [[Mauritshuis]], developing a close professional relationship with then-director [[Wilhelm Martin]] that led to several collaborative projects, often scientific in nature. For example, in July 1916, in response to a threat of [[chemical attack]], they tested the effects of [[lye]] on a series of "dummy" paintings in order to discover which brand of fire extinguisher was best suited to saving an artwork.&lt;ref name=ac /&gt; Derix is also thought to have assisted Martin in his publications on conservation and restoration.&lt;ref name=ac /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martin |first1=Wilhelm |last2= |first2= |date={{date|1916-10|mdy}} |title=Over conserveeren en restaureeren van oude schilderijen |url= |journal=Oude Kunst |volume= |issue= |pages=1‚Äì9 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his continuation of the Hals project at [[Haarlem]], he brought in the chemist Gosen Van der Sleen to aid in his analysis. This was the first known case in the Netherlands of a chemist advising on a painting restoration project.&lt;ref name=ac /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy-van Halm |first=J |editor-last=Schweizerischer Verband f√ºr Konservierung der Kunsthistoriker in der Schweiz; Nationale Informationsstelle f√ºr Kulturg√ºter-Ehraltung |editor-first= |title=Geschichte der Restaurierung in Europa : Akten des internationalen Kongresses "Restauriergeschichte", Interlaken 1989 |publisher=Worms: Wernersche Verlagsgesellschaft |date=1991 |pages=105‚Äì07 |chapter=Zur Geschichte der Restaurierung in Holland, eine Skizze |isbn=3884620827}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Van der Sleen's approval, he continued the restoration as planned, working with his son A.M., nephew C. F. Louis, and brother Carel to re-varnish the paintings.&lt;ref name=ac /&gt; Although he published little himself, save for an article in the [[Kurt Walter Bachstitz]] Gallery Bulletin, he remained well-occupied with his restoration business in the Hague until his death on December 4, 1932.&lt;ref name=ba /&gt;&lt;ref name=ac /&gt;

==A. Martin de Wild==
[[File:A-Martin-de-Wild-from-The-Hague-352107479016.jpg|thumb|upright|A. Martin de Wild in 1947.]]
Angenitus Martin de Wild, known as A. M. or Martin, was Derix de Wild's son. He sought to further the chemical approach to restoration promoted by his father and uncle. To this end, he enrolled at the [[Delft University of Technology]], completing a doctorate degree in [[inorganic chemistry]] in 1928.&lt;ref name=he&gt;{{cite book |last=Tromp |first=Henk |date=2010 |title=A Real Van Gogh: How the Art World Struggles with Truth |url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/R/bo10497630.html |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Amsterdam University Press |page= |isbn=9089641769 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''The Scientific Examination of Pictures,'' originally completed as part of his chemistry thesis, was soon published internationally.&lt;ref name=he /&gt;&lt;ref name=sc&gt;{{cite book |last=Wild, de |first=A.

Bell and Sons, Ltd |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking paint samples from a variety of European masterpieces, he studied the chemical makeup of synthetic pigments used in oil painting over time. After Martin's death, the book was considered a "landmark" for its technical analysis of pigmentation.&lt;ref name=amo&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=April 1969 |title=Angenitus Martin de Wild |jstor=3179096 |journal=Bulletin of the American Group: International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=9 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin's heavily technical method of art analysis and formal chemical training were a relative novelty. He went on to some renown for his involvement in forgery trials throughout the 1930s and 1940s, including the highly publicized [[Otto Wacker]] trial in 1932 and the [[Han van Meegeren]] trial in 1946.&lt;ref name=he /&gt; He lectured at the [[University of Utrecht]] from 1938 until 1947.&lt;ref name=ac /&gt; Working privately in his studio in the Hague, Martin published widely until his death in 1969, often collaborating with colleagues from the Delft University of Technology and the [[International Institute for Conservation]].&lt;ref name=amo /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Wild |first1=A.M. |last2=Cursiter |first2=S. |date=1937 |title=Picture Relining |url= |journal=Technical Studies in the Field of Fine Arts |volume= |issue= |pages= 161‚Äì178|doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Wild |first1=A.M. |last2=Froentejes |first2=W |date=October 1950 |title=A Forged Frans Hals |jstor=870559 |journal=The Burlington Magazine |volume=92 |issue=571 |pages= 296‚Äì297 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Wild |first1=A.M. |last2= |first2= |date=1964 |title=Wiederfestigung von Leinwand und Bildschicht |url= |journal=Maltechnik |volume=4 |issue= |pages=97‚Äì111 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Wild |first1=A.M. |last2= |first2= |date=May 1959 |title=A Vacuum Re-Lining Apparatus for General Use |jstor=1504889 |journal=Studies in Conservation |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=i |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==C. F. Louis de Wild==
Carel de Wild's son C. F. Louis trained with his uncle Derix for much of his youth, eventually establishing his own restoration practice.&lt;ref name=ac /&gt;&lt;ref name=cob&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=C.

He worked in conjunction with American museums like the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the [[National Gallery of Art]], and, like his father before him, the [[Frick Collection]]. Notable paintings he restored include the [[Alba Madonna]] and multiple works by [[Piero della Francesca]]. He retired from his conservation practice in 1969, and passed away in 1987 at the age of 86.&lt;ref name=cob /&gt;

'''Djehutynakht''', tentatively identified with '''Djehutynakht IV''' or '''Djehutynakht V''', was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian "[[nomarch|Overlord]] of the [[Hare nome]]" (the 15th nome of [[Upper Egypt]]) during the very end of the [[11th Dynasty]] or the early [[12th Dynasty]] (21st-20th century BCE). He is well known for his painted outer [[coffin]] (commonly called ‚ÄúBersha coffin‚Äù) now exhibited in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] along with his other [[grave goods]].

==Biography==
{{Hiero|Djehutynakht&lt;br&gt;·∏è·∏•wty-n·∏´t|&lt;hiero&gt;G26-N35:M3:X1*Aa1&lt;/hiero&gt;|align=left|era=mk}}
Once believed to have lived during the reign of [[pharaoh]] [[Senusret III]] of the 12th Dynasty, from the analysis of his furniture it has been deducted that he actually lived in an earlier period, although a degree of uncertainty still remains: it's very difficult to trace Djehutynakht's family and life events, and the only certain relationship it that with his wife, also named Djehutynakht. The name was very common in this period and six nomarchs bearing it are known, two of whom ‚Äì the fourth and the fifth respectively ‚Äì were married to a wife with the same name.&lt;ref name=hw&gt;{{cite book |last=Willems|first=Harco|year=1988|title=Chests of Life|location=Leiden|publisher=Ex Oriente Lux|isbn= 90-72690-01-X}} pp.&amp;nbsp;70-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If this nomarch was the same of ''Djehutynakht IV'', then he lived at the very end of the 11th Dynasty and was the son of the nomarch Ahanakht I, successor of his brother Ahanakht II, and predecessor of the nomarch Neheri I. Otherwise, if he was the same of ''Djehutynakht V'', then he lived during the late reign of pharaoh [[Amenemhat I]] of the 12th Dynasty and was Neheri I's son and successor by his wife Djehutyhotep, and the uncle of his successor Neheri II. In either cases, no children are known for Djehutynakht and his wife.&lt;ref name=hw/&gt; See "[[Hare nome#Nomarchs of the Hare nome|Nomarchs of the Hare nome]]" for a complete genealogy.

Djehutynakht's tomb ‚Äì designated 10A ‚Äì was rediscovered in the [[Deir el-Bersha]] necropolis in [[Middle Egypt]] in 1915 by the American [[Egyptologist]] [[George Andrew Reisner]] who was the leader of the [[Harvard University]] ‚Äì Boston Museum of Fine Arts expedition.&lt;ref name=hw/&gt; Almost nothing was left of the outer chapel but the burial chamber, although already raided of the jewelry, still contained several finely painted [[Cedrus libani|cedar wooden]] coffins belonged to Djehutynakht and his wife (above all his outer coffin, commonly called ‚ÄúBersha coffin‚Äù, renowned as ‚Äúthe finest painted coffin Egypt produced and a masterpiece of panel painting‚Äù.&lt;ref name=ex&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.org/exhibitions/secrets-tomb-10a |title=The Secrets of Tomb 10A: Egypt 2000 BC |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Boston Museum of Fine Arts |publisher= |access-date=September 4, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the coffins, in the tomb were found a head of a mummy (most likely a male one thus possibly belonging to the nomarch&lt;ref name=head&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/head-of-the-mummy-of-djehutynakht-144861 |title=Head of the mummy of Djehutynakht |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Boston Museum of Fine Arts |publisher= |access-date=September 4, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as well as lady Djehutynakht's [[canopic chest]] and a great number of funerary furniture such as pottery, [[canopic jar]]s, several model boats, many models of men and women in different daily life activities, and the famous group composed of a priest and many offering girls, known as ‚ÄúBersha procession‚Äù. In its entirety, these objects forms the largest [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] funerary assemblage ever found.&lt;ref name=ex/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Egyptian government gave the whole content of Tomb 10A to the Museum of Fine Arts. During the naval trip to [[Boston]] in 1920, the collection was threatened by a fire on board, but fortunately the damage was very limited. For decades only the ‚ÄúBersha coffin‚Äù and the ‚ÄúBersha procession‚Äù were exhibited at the MFA; in 2009-10 the whole collection was shown in a dedicated exhibition.&lt;ref name=ex/&gt;

The '''FIBA Women's World Ranking''' is the [[FIBA]]'s rankings of national women's [[basketball]] teams. FIBA ranks women's national teams in both senior and junior competitions. It also publishes combined rankings for all competitions involving both sexes.

==Calculation==
FIBA still uses the competition-based system to determine its women's rankings. As noted above, this system was also used to determine men's rankings prior to 2017. FIBA has announced that it will introduce a game-based ranking procedure similar to that currently used for men's rankings in the indeterminate future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/documents/rankingmen/faq |title=FIBA World Ranking Men, presented by Nike ‚Äì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) |publisher=FIBA |accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events' weights===
FIBA uses a [[weighted arithmetic mean]] to determine the statistical weight of each of the tournaments. Each event is assigned point weight that is based partly on how competitive the tournament is and partly on which national teams are participating:&lt;ref name="how"&gt;[http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/even/rank/p/openNodeIDs/998/selNodeID/998/howItWork.html FIBA.com: How it works]&lt;/ref&gt;

|-

| 4 || [[FIBA Asia Women's Cup]] || 0.3
|-
| 4 || [[EuroBasket Women]] || 1
|-
| 4 || [[FIBA Oceania Women's Championship]] || 0.1
|}

===Competition ranking points===
[[File:FIFA World Rankings for Women.png|thumb|300px|Map of FIBA World Ranking for women]]
As opposed to [[Association football|football]] tournaments, teams still have to go through a series of consolation and classification rounds even if they've been eliminated from title contention, so that a complete ranking of the teams will be possible.&lt;ref name="how"/&gt;

The calculations are done after the tournaments stated above in a group of two Olympic cycles (8 years). The oldest tournament outside the 8-year period is discarded and replaced with the newest competition.&lt;ref name="how"/&gt;

This means that in every computation, there are:
* Four continental championships
* Two [[FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup]]s
* Two [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic basketball tournaments]]

===Example===
The {{wnbt|United States}}' 1000.0 points were calculated by this method:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35859">The '''FIVB World Ranking''' is a ranking system for men's and women's national teams in [[volleyball]]. The teams of the member nations of [[FIVB]], volleyball's world governing body, are ranked based on their competitions results with the most successful teams being ranked highest. A point system is used, with points being awarded based on the importance of each FIVB International competitions and Continental competitions also. Under the existing system, rankings are based on a team's performance, with more recent results and more significant competitions being more heavily weighted to help reflect the current competitive state of a team. {{as of|2017|August}} the top 3 teams in men's category are, world's no.1 [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], no.2 [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]], no.3 [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] and in women's category are as follows, world's no.1 [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], no.2 [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]], no.3 [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]].

The ranking system was most recently revamped after the 2006 [[FIVB World League|World League]] (for men) and 2006 [[FIVB World Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] (for women).

The rankings are used in international competitions to define the seeded teams and arrange them in pools. Specific procedures for seeding and pooling are established by the FIVB in each competition's formula, but the method usually employed is the [[serpentine system]].

'''Forward-confirmed reverse DNS''' ('''FCrDNS'''), also known as '''full-circle reverse DNS''', '''double-reverse DNS''', or '''iprev''', is a networking parameter configuration in which a given [[IP address]] has both forward (name-to-address) and reverse (address-to-name) [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) entries that match each other. This is the standard configuration expected by the Internet standards supporting many DNS-reliant protocols. David Barr published an opinion in RFC 1912 (Informational) recommending it as best practice for DNS administrators, but there are no formal requirements for it codified within the DNS standard itself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/std13 |title=Information on STD 13 &amp;raquo; RFC Editor |access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A FCrDNS verification can create a weak form of authentication that there is a valid relationship between the owner of a domain name and the owner of the network that has been given an IP address. While weak, this authentication is strong enough that it can be used for [[whitelist]]ing purposes because [[Spam (electronic)|spammers]] and [[Phishing|phishers]] cannot usually by-pass this verification when they use [[zombie computer]]s for [[email spoofing]]. That is, the reverse DNS might verify, but it will usually be part of another domain than the claimed domain name.

Using an ISP's mail server as a relay may solve the reverse DNS problem, because the requirement is the forward and reverse lookup for the sending relay have to match, it does not have to be related to the from-field or sending domain of messages it relays.

Other methods for establishing a relation between an IP address and a domain in email are the [[Sender Policy Framework]] (SPF) and the [[MX record]].

ISPs that will not or cannot configure reverse DNS will generate problems for hosts on their networks, by virtue of being unable to support applications or protocols that require reverse DNS agree with the corresponding A (or AAAA) record.  ISPs that cannot or will not provide reverse DNS ultimately will be limiting the ability of their client base to use Internet services they provide effectively and securely.

==Applications==
* Most e-mail [[mail transfer agent]]s (server software) use a FCrDNS verification and if there is a valid domain name, put it into the "Received:" trace header field.
* Some e-mail mail transfer agents will perform FCrDNS verification on the domain name given on the SMTP HELO and EHLO commands. This can violate RFC 2821 and so e-mail is usually not rejected by default.
* The [[Sender Policy Framework]] email anti-forgery system uses a FCrDNS check in its "ptr:" mechanism. However, the use of this "ptr:" mechanism is discouraged since the first standardisation of SPF in 2006 (in RFC4408).
* Some [[e-mail spam]] filters use FCrDNS checks as an authentication method for domain names or for [[whitelist]]ing purposes, according to RFC 7601, for example.
* [[SpamCop]] uses the FCrDNS check, which sometimes causes problems for SpamCop users who are also customers of [[Internet service provider]]s who do not provide properly matching DNS and rDNS records for mail servers. [http://forum.spamcop.net/forums/index.php?act=findpost&amp;pid=36027] [http://forum.spamcop.net/forums/index.php?act=findpost&amp;pid=41615]
* Some [[FTP]], [[Telnet]] and [[TCP Wrapper]] servers perform FCrDNS checks.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}
* Some [[IRC]] Servers perform FCrDNS checks to prevent abuse.

'''Hellawes''' the Sorceress is a minor character in [[Thomas Malory]]'s 15th-century compilation of [[Arthurian legend]]s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]].'' She is lady of the Castle Nygurmous ("of [[necromancy]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=mi4WDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90|title=The Body and the Arts|last=Saunders|first=Corinne|date=2009-03-26|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780230234000|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hellawes is a treacherous enchantress whom Sir [[Lancelot]] encounters in his pursuit of a holy sword or cloth heal his wounded [[vassal|liegeman]], Meliot of Logres. She manages to lure the questing knight into her fearsome [[chapel perilous]] but Lancelot‚Äîwho has been the object of her obsessive and [[unrequited love]] for seven years‚Äîsuccessfully escapes.

{{quotation|Lancelot braved the chapel to retrieve a sword and discovered that its terrifying properties were simply illusions. Hellawes appeared before him and asked him for a kiss in exchange for the sword, but Lancelot refused. It turned out that Lancelot would have perished from the kiss had he consented. Hellawes had tendencies toward [[necrophilia]], and she would have rather had Lancelot as a dead lover than to have lived without him. Lancelot hurried away, and Hellawes died a few weeks later from sorrow. [Christopher W. Bruce, "The Arthurian Name Dictionary," 1999]&lt;ref name=Bruce&gt;Bruce, Christopher.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4715">'''Kanjirottu Yakshi''' (Chiruthevi) is a folkloric [[vampire]]. According to the myth, she was born into an affluent [[Padamangalam Nair]] tharavad by name Mangalathu at Kanjiracode in [[Southern Travancore]] (now in [[Tamil Nadu]]). Being a ravishingly beautiful courtesan she had an intimate relationship with Raman Thampi, son of King [[Rama Varma of Venad|Rama Varma]] and rival of [[Marthanda Varma|Anizhom Thirunal Marthanda Varma]]. According to the story, she was murdered by her servant and she turned into a [[Yakshi]], (which is a class of mythical beings in Malayalam folklore, equivalent to the Yaksha class in Hindu Puranas) waylaying men with her beauty and drinking their blood.&lt;ref&gt;Kaimal, Kesava. 'Thekkan Thiruvithamkurile Yakshikal'. Srinidhi Publications, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mangalathu Chiruthevi==

Chiruthevi was a courtesan who had as her clients the high and the mighty. But she was infatuated with one of her many servants, Kunjuraman. Kunjuraman, a Pondan Nair (palanquin-bearer), was a fair, tall, well-built and handsome young man. She and her brother Govindan used to ride on Kunjuraman's back to nearby places. A predatory sadist, Chiruthevi enjoyed torturing Kunjuraman physically and mentally. She did everything possible to separate him from his wife.

In course of time, the unmarried Govindan and Kunjuraman became bosom friends. They often shared the same room. Chiruthevi was not quite comfortable with the growing fondness of her brother for her lover. But she did not act.

Chiruthevi hatched a plot and liquidated Kunjuraman's wife. Once Govindan was travelling on Kunjuraman's back when the former revealed the details of the plot. Days later, Kunjuraman strangled Chiruthevi to death when they were sharing a bed. Govindan winked at the crime and protected his beloved friend.
 
Chiruthevi was reborn as a vengeful Yakshi to a couple at Kanjiracode. She grew into a bewitching beauty within moments of her birth. Though she seduced many men and drank their blood, her heart was set on the handsome Kunjuraman. She told him that she was willing to pardon him if he married her. Kunjuraman flatly refused. The Yakshi channelised all her energies in tormenting him. Devastated, Kunjuraman sought the assistance of Mangalathu Govindan, who was a great upasaka of Lord [[Balarama]]. Govindan was for a compromise. He said that the Yakshi could have Kunjuraman for a year provided she conformed to three conditions. One, she must agree to be installed at a temple after one year. Two, after many years the temple will be destroyed and she must then seek refuge in (saranagati) Lord [[Narasimha]] for attaining moksham. Three, she must pray for Govindan and his relationship with Kunjuraman not only in their current birth but also in their subsequent births. The Yakshi swore upon 'ponnum vilakkum' that she would abide by all the three conditions. Thus the compromise formula worked.&lt;ref&gt;Nair, Balasankaran. 'Kanjirottu Yakshi'. Sastha Books, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kanjiracottu Valiaveedu Temple==

A year later, the Yakshi was installed at a Temple which later came to be owned by Kanjiracottu Valiaveedu. The members of Valiaveedu started worshipping this Yakshi besides their Guardian Deity, Sri Ramanuja Perumal (Lord Krishna accompanied by Sri Rukmini and Lord Balarama).&lt;ref&gt;Nair, Balasankaran. 'Kanjirottu Yakshi'. Sastha Books, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Devotees used to offer [[Pongala]] to Yakshi Amma on Pooram in the month of Meenom and on the first Fridays in every Malayalam month except Meenom.&lt;ref&gt;Nair, Balasankaran. 'Valiaveedu Charithrathil'. Sastha Books, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The Temple does not exist any more.

==Kanjirottu Yakshi and Sri Padmanabhaswami Temple==

After taking refuge in Lord Narasimha of Thekkedom, the Yakshi is now believed to be residing in Kallara B of Sri [[Padmanabhaswamy Temple]]. As Princess [[Aswathi Thirunal Gowri Lakshmi Bayi]] observes, "Disturbing her peace would be a disaster especially if her current quiet temperament reverts to the menacing nature that was once hers."&lt;ref&gt;Bayi, Aswathi Thirunal Gouri Lakshmi. 'Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple' (Third Edition). Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The enchanting and ferocious forms of this Yakshi are painted on the south-west part of Sri Padmanabha's shrine.

==Sundara Lakshmi==

Sundara Lakshmi, an accomplished dancer and consort of Maharaja [[Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma]], was an ardent devotee of Kanjirottu Yakshi Amma.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4906">In [[mathematics]], '''Ky Fan's lemma (KFL)''' is a combinatorial lemma about labellings of triangulations. It is a generalization of [[Tucker's lemma]]. It was proved by [[Ky Fan]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/1969651 | volume=56 | title=A Generalization of Tucker's Combinatorial Lemma with Topological Applications | journal=The Annals of Mathematics | pages=431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TuckerLemExample.png|thumb|350px|In this example, where ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, there is no 2-dimensional alternating simplex (since the labels are only 1,2). Hence, there must exist a complementary edge (marked with red).]]

== Definitions ==
KFL uses the following concepts.
* &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt;: the closed ''n''-dimensional [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]].
** &lt;math&gt;S_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;: its boundary [[sphere]].
* ''T'': a [[Triangulation (topology)|triangulation]] of &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt;.
** ''T'' is called ''boundary antipodally symmetric'' if the subset of [[Simplex|simplices]] of ''T'' which are in &lt;math&gt;S_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; provides a triangulation of &lt;math&gt;S_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; where if œÉ is a simplex then so is ‚àíœÉ.
* ''L'': a ''labeling'' of the vertices of ''T'', which assigns to each vertex a non-zero integer: &lt;math&gt;L: V(T) \to \mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}&lt;/math&gt;.
** ''L'' is called ''[[odd function|boundary odd]]'' if for every vertex &lt;math&gt;v\in S_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L(-v) = -L(v)&lt;/math&gt;. 
* An edge of ''T'' is called a ''complementary edge'' of ''L'' if the labels of its two endpoints have the same size and opposite signs, e.g. {‚àí2, +2}.
* An ''n''-dimensional simplex of ''T'' is called an ''alternating simplex'' of ''T'' if its labels have different sizes with alternating signs, e.g.{‚àí1, +2, ‚àí3} or {+3, ‚àí5, +7}.

== Statement ==
Let ''T'' be a boundary-antipodally-symmetric triangulation of &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt; and ''L'' a boundary-odd labeling of&amp;nbsp;''T''.

If ''L'' has no complementary edge, then ''L'' has an odd number of ''n''-dimensional alternating simplexes.

=== Corollary: [[Tucker's lemma]] ===
By definition, an ''n''-dimensional alternating simplex must have labels with ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 different sizes.

This means that, if the labeling ''L'' uses only ''n'' different sizes (i.e. &lt;math&gt;L: V(T) \to \{+1,-1,+2,-2,\ldots,+n,-n\}&lt;/math&gt;), it cannot have an ''n''-dimensional alternating simplex.

Hence, by KFL, ''L'' must have a complementary edge.

== Proof ==
KFL can be proved constructively based on a path-based algorithm. The algorithm it starts at a certain point or edge of the triangulation, then goes from simplex to simplex according to prescribed rules, until it is not possible to proceed any more. It can be proved that the path must end in an alternating simplex.

The proof is by induction on ''n''.

The basis is &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt; is the interval &lt;math&gt;[-1,1]&lt;/math&gt; and its boundary is the set &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt;. The labeling ''L'' is boundary-odd, so &lt;math&gt;L(-1)=-L(+1)&lt;/math&gt;. Without loss of generality, assume that &lt;math&gt;L(-1)=-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L(+1)=+1&lt;/math&gt;. Start at ‚àí1 and go right. At some edge ''e'', the labeling must change from negative to positive. Since ''L'' has no complementary edges, ''e'' must have a negative label and a positive label with a different size (e.g. ‚àí1 and +2); this means that ''e'' is a 1-dimensional alternating simplex. Moreover, if at any point the labeling changes again from positive to negative, then this change makes a second alternating simplex, and by the same reasoning as before there must be a third alternating simplex later. Hence, the number of alternating simplices is odd.

The following description illustrates the induction step for &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt;. In this case &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt; is a disc and its boundary is a circle. The labeling ''L'' is boundary-odd, so in particular &lt;math&gt;L(-v) = -L(v)&lt;/math&gt; for some point ''v'' on the boundary. Split the boundary circle to two semi-circles and treat each semi-circle as an interval. By the induction basis, this interval must have an alternating simplex, e.g. an edge with labels (+1,‚àí2). Moreover, the number of such edges on both intervals is odd. Using the boundary criterion, on the boundary we have an odd number of edges where the smaller number is positive and the larger negative, and an odd number of edges where the smaller number is negative and the larger positive. We call the former ''decreasing'', the latter ''increasing''.

There are two kinds of triangles.

* If a triangle is not alternating, it must have an even number of increasing edges and an even number of decreasing edges.
* If a triangle is alternating, it must have one increasing edge and one decreasing edge, thus we have an odd number of alternating triangles.

By induction, this proof can be extended to any dimension.

'''''Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage''''' (1972), compiled by the linguist and author [[Lin Yutang]], contains over 8,100 character [[headword|head entries]] and 110,000 words and phrases, including many [[neologisms]]. Lin's dictionary made two [[lexicographical]] innovations, neither of which became widely used. [[Collation]] is based on his graphical "Instant Index System" that assigns numbers to [[Chinese characters]] based on 33 basic calligraphic [[Stroke (CJKV character)|stroke]] patterns. [[Romanization of Chinese]] is by Lin's "Simplified National Romanization System", which he developed as a prototype for the [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]] or "National Romanization" system adopted by the Chinese government in 1928. Lin's bilingual dictionary continues to be used in the present day, particularly the free online version that the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] established in 1999.

==History==
[[File:Linyutang.jpg|thumb|[[Lin Yutang]], chief editor of the ''Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage'']]
[[File:Ming Kwai 1952 US 2613795 A.png|thumb|Ming Kwai typewriter invented by [[Lin Yutang]], from 1952 {{cite patent |country=US |number=2613795|status=patent}}]]
[[Lin Yutang]] (1895-1976) was an influential Chinese scholar, linguist, educator, inventor, translator, and author of works in Chinese and English.

Lin's ''Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage'' was his second lexicographical effort. From 1932 to 1937, he compiled a 65-volume monolingual Chinese dictionary that was destroyed by Japanese troops during the [[Battle of Shanghai]] in 1937, except for 13 volumes that he had shipped earlier to New York (Durdin 1972: 37).

Lin Yutang's "Instant Index System" for characters inspired his invention of the [[Chinese typewriter#Ming Kwai Nao Can typewriter|Ming Kwai Chinese typewriter]] in 1946. Users would [[Chinese input methods for computers|input a character]] by pressing two keys based upon the 33 basic stroke formations, which Lin called "letters of the Chinese Alphabet" (Sorrel 2009).

''Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage'' was the first major Chinese‚ÄêEnglish dictionary to be produced by a fully bilingual Chinese instead of by Western missionaries (Durdin 1972: 37). In the history of Chinese lexicography, missionaries dominated the first century of Chinese‚ÄêEnglish dictionaries, from [[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Morrison]]'s ''[[A Dictionary of the Chinese Language]]'' (1815-1823) to [[Robert Henry Mathews|Mathews]]' ''[[Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary|Chinese-English Dictionary]]'' (1931, 1943) (Durdin 1972: 37) .

In the period between Mathews' and Lin's dictionaries, both the Chinese and English vocabularies underwent radical changes in terminology for fields such as popular culture, economics, politics, science, and technology. Lin's dictionary included many [[neologism]]s and [[loanword]]s not found in Mathews', for example (in pinyin), ''yu√°nz«êd√†n'' ÂéüÂ≠êÂΩà " atomic bomb", ''h√©p√≠ng g√≤ngch«î'' ÂíåÂπ≥ÂÖ±Ëôï "peaceful coexistence", ''x·ªãÃån«éo'' Ê¥óËÖ¶ "brainwash", ''t√†ik≈çngr√©n'' Â§™Á©∫‰∫∫ "astronaut", ''y√°og«în'' ÊêñÊªæ "rock 'n' roll", and ''xƒ´p√≠'' Â¨âÁöÆ "hippie".

The history of ''Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage'' began in late 1965, when Lin and [[Li Choh-ming]], the founding [[Vice-Chancellor]] of the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], made plans for compiling a new Chinese-English dictionary as a "lasting contribution to knowledge" (1972: xvi). When the dictionary was published, Lin acknowledged that Li's "vision and enthusiastic support" made the compilation project possible. Lin started working on the dictionary in Taipei, and in the spring of 1967, he accepted the position of [[Professor#Research professor|Research Professor]] at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Qian 2011: 251).  After completing the manuscript in the spring of 1971, Lin moved to Hong Kong, where his former student Francis Pan and a team of young Chinese University graduates assisted him with copyediting, research, and final preparations (Durdin 1972: 37).

Li Choh-ming also contributed the dictionary's [[foreword]] (in Chinese and English) and title [[Chinese calligraphy]] seen on the cover. Li says that a good Chinese-English dictionary should provide an "idiomatic equivalence" of terms in the two languages, and derides previous dictionaries for rendering ''f√®itiƒõ'' Âª¢Èêµ as "old iron" when it should "obviously" be "scrap iron" (1972: xvi). However, ''old iron'' is perfectly good [[British English]] usage (Pollard 1973: 786).

This [[Edition (book)#First edition|first edition]] was bilingually titled '''''Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage''''' or '''''DƒÅngd√†i H√†n-Yƒ´ng c√≠di«én''''' (Áï∂‰ª£Êº¢Ëã±Ë©ûÂÖ∏). Sponsored by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, this book was printed in Japan by [[Kenky≈´sha]], which is known for publishing high-quality dictionaries, and was distributed by [[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw-Hill]] in the United States. The original edition included three indexes: Lin's idiosyncratic "instant" index for looking up [[traditional Chinese characters]], an alphabetical English index, and an index of about 2,000 [[simplified Chinese characters]]. However, many users unfamiliar with Lin's character indexing system found the dictionary difficult to use, which led to the following supplement.

In 1978, [[The Chinese University Press]] published the '''''Supplementary index to Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage''''' or '''''L√≠n Y«ît√°ng dƒÅngd√†i H√†n-Yƒ´ng c√≠di«én zƒìng biƒÅn su«íy«ên''''' (ÊûóË™ûÂ†ÇÁï∂‰ª£Êº¢Ëã±Ë©ûÂÖ∏Â¢ûÁ∑®Á¥¢Âºï), which indexed by [[Wade-Giles]] romanization and by the 214 [[Kangxi radicals]].

The 1987 revised edition '''''The New Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary''''' or '''''Zu√¨xƒ´n L√≠n Y«ît√°ng dƒÅngd√†i H√†n-Yƒ´ng c√≠di«én''''' (ÊúÄÊñ∞ÊûóË™ûÂ†ÇÁï∂‰ª£Êº¢Ëã±Ë©ûÂÖ∏), which was edited by Lai Ming (ÈªéÊòé) and [[Tai-yi Lin|Lin Tai-yi]], Lin Yutang's son-in-law and daughter, has about 6,300 character head entries and 60,000 compounds or phrases, said to be "what general readers are likely to encounter or likely to use in their daily lives and studies" (1987: xii). Compared with the 1720-page original edition, the 1077-page new edition has approximately 1,700 fewer head entries and 40,000 more phrases. The revised edition has five indexes: numerical Instant Index System, simplified "''Guoryuu Romatzyh''", Wade-Giles, [[Bopomofo|Mandarin Phonetic Symbols]], and 214 radicals.

A team of scholars at the Chinese University of Hong Kong Research Centre for Humanities Computing developed a free web edition of ''Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage'' and published it online in 1999. The web edition comprises a total of 8,169 head characters, 40,379 entries of Chinese words or phrases, and 44,407 explanatory entries of grammatical usage. [[Chinese character encoding]] is in the [[Big5]] system (which includes 13,053 [[traditional Chinese characters]]), which does not encode [[simplified Chinese characters]] or uncommon characters (represented as "‚ñ°" in the dictionary) included in [[Unicode]]'s 80,388 [[CJK Unified Ideographs]]. The web edition dictionary replaces Lin Yutang's obsolete Gwoyeu Romatzyh system with modern standard [[pinyin]] romanization, which users can hear pronounced through [[speech synthesis]]. It also abandons Lin's obsolete Instant Index System, which "has not been widely used since its inception", and provides three machine-generated indexes by [[Radical (Chinese characters)|radical]], pinyin, and English.

==Content== 
Lin's ''Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage'' comprises approximately 8,100 character head entries and 110,000 word and phrase entries (Dunn 1977: 81). It includes both modern Chinese [[neologisms]] such as ''x«ên«éo'' Ê¥óËÖ¶ "[[brainwash]]" and many [[List of loanwords in Chinese#English|Chinese loanwords from English]] such as ''y√°og«în'' ÊêñÊªæ "[[rock 'n' roll]]" and ''xƒ´p√≠'' Â¨âÁöÆ "[[hippie]]". The lexicographical scope "includes all words and phrases that a modern reader is likely to encounter with(sic) in reading modern newspapers, magazines and books" (Lin 1972: xix). The dictionary contains an English index of over 60,000 words, which effectively serves as an English-Chinese dictionary. It also includes a table with 2,000 [[simplified Chinese characters]] that had come into common use in the [[People‚Äôs Republic of China]] during the 1950s and 1960s.

Lin Yutang's dictionary introduced two new Chinese linguistic systems that he invented, the Instant Index System for looking up characters and Simplified Guoryuu Romatzyh for romanizing pronunciations. Lin claimed a third innovation of being the first dictionary to determine [[parts of speech]] for Chinese words, but that distinction goes to the War Department's 1945 [[Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese#History|Dictionary of Spoken Chinese]] (1972: xxiii; Dunn 1977: 81).

[[Collation]] in ''Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage'' is by means of Lin's numerical Instant Index System for characters, which he describes as "the culmination of five decades of research". Lin previously developed this system for selecting characters with his 1946 Ming Kwai Chinese typewriter (above). The system's Chinese name ''sh√†ngxi√†x√≠ng ji«énz√¨f«é'' ‰∏ä‰∏ãÂΩ¢Ê™¢Â≠óÊ≥ï meaning "character lookup method by upper and lower shape" describes how each character is assigned a four-digit (or optional five-digit) code number according to the stroke patterns in their top left and bottom right corners. In analogy to the more popular [[Four-Corner Method]] that assigns a character a four-digit code based upon graphic strokes in the four corners, plus an optional fifth digit, Lin's simpler Instant Index System is sometimes called the "Two-Corner Method" (Theobald 2000).

First, Lin breaks down all Chinese characters into 33 basic stroke formations, called the "letters of the Chinese Alphabet", arranged into ten groups suggested by the characters for numerals. For instance, the character for ''liu'' ÂÖ≠ "6" is the mnemonic basic for "letters" ‰∫† (60), Âπø (61), ÂÆÄ (62), and ‰∏∂ (63). Second, Lin lists the "fifty radicals" (common among the traditional 214 [[Kangxi radicals]]) designated with letters A through D, as in Ê∞µ (63A), Á§ª (63B), Ë°§ (63C), and Êà∏ (63D). Third, characters that can be divided vertically into left and right components are called "split" (S), and those characters that cannot are called "non-split" (NS), thus Áæä and Áæ© are (NS) while Á•• and ‰ΩØ are (S).

Lin's primary rule for the Instant Index is "Geometric Determination: The tops are defined as the ''geometrically highest''; the bottoms are ''geometrically lowest''. They are not the first and last strokes in writing." For example, the four-digit lookup code for Ë®Ä is 60.40 since the highest upper left stroke is ‰∫† (60) and the lowest bottom right stroke is Âè£ (40). Lin's dictionary lists only three characters Ë®Ä, Âêù, and Âïª in the 60.40 group, but there is a further rule for code groups that list many, such as 81A.40 with ten characters like Èà∑ (81A.40-1) and Èäò (81A.40-9), "The Fifth Digit: Top of Remainder" arranges the group's character entries in numerical accordance with the "top of remainder" (character minus "radical").

Romanization in ''Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage'' is by "Simplified ''Guoryuu Romatzyh''" (''Ji«énhu√† lu√≥m«éz√¨'' Á∞°ÂåñÁæÖÈ¶¨Â≠ó, ''Jiaanhuah Rormaatzyh'' in Lin's system) that he developed in 1923 and 1924 as a prototype for the ''[[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]]'' (GR) "National Language Romanization" system adopted by the Chinese Government in 1928 (Dunn 1977: 81). Lin also calls this system "Simplified Romatzyh" and "Basic GR".

Both systems represent the [[four tones]] of Standard Chinese with different spellings but Lin's simplified GR is more consistent than standard GR. For instance, the word ''Gu√≥y«î'' ÂúãË™û ("National Language; Standard Chinese; Mandarin") is romanized ''Gwoyeu'' in official GR and ''Guoryuu'' in Lin's simplified GR, which exemplifies the difference between systems. Pinyin 2nd-tone ''gu√≥'' (Âúã) is GR ''gwo'' and "basic" GR ''guor''; and 3rd-tone ''y«î'' (Ë™û) is ''yeu'' and ''yuu'', respectively. Simplified GR consistently represents tone by the spelling of the main vowel in a syllable, with vowel unchanged for 1st-tone (''guo''), ''-r'' added for 2nd-tone ''guor'' (Âúã), vowel doubled for 3rd-tone (''guoo''), and ''-h'' added for 4th-tone (''guoh''); and similarly ''yu'', ''yur'', ''yuu'' (Ë™û), and ''yuh''. Standard GR uses these same four tonal spellings for many syllables (tones 1-4 are ''a'', ''ar'', ''aa'', and ''ah''), but changes them for some others, including ''guo'', ''gwo'' (Âúã), ''guoo'', and ''guoh''; and ''yiu'', ''yu'', ''yeu'' (Ë™û), ''yuh''.

Lin Yutang said, "People who are new to this system will doubtless be disturbed by it at first. But they'll get used to it very quickly. I don't need to emphasize the point that the method of building the tone into the spelling of the word fits the modern world of telegraphy, the typewriter and the computer." (Durdin 1972: 37).

Entries in ''Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage'' are lexicographically sophisticated and have accurate translation equivalents. The basic format for a head entry gives the character, the Instant Index System code, the pronunciation(s) in Simplified GR, the part or parts of speech, optionally other speech levels (e.g., "sl." for slang), English translation equivalents for the head character and usage examples of [[polysyllabic]] compounds, phrases, and idioms, subdivided by numbers for multiple meanings, and lastly a list of common Chinese words using the entry character, each given with characters, pronunciation, part of speech, and translation equivalents (Ching 1975: 524). The dictionary distinguishes historical varieties: ''AC'' ([[Old Chinese|Ancient Chinese]]), ''MC'' ([[Middle Chinese]]), ''LL'' ([[Classical Chinese|Literary Language]]), and ''Dial.'' ([[Varieties of Chinese|dialect]]); and levels of speech: ''court.'' (courteous), ''sl.'' (slang), ''satir.'' (satirical,) ''facet.'' (facetious), ''contempt.'' (contemptuous), ''abuse'', ''derog.'' (derogatory), ''vulgar'', and ''litr.'' (literary) (Lin 1972: xx-xxi).

Lin explains that the basic principle for translation equivalents is "contextual semantics, the subtle, imperceptible changes of meaning due to context" (1972: xxiv). In terms of the translational contrast between [[dynamic and formal equivalence]], Lin placed emphasis on presenting the dynamic or "idiomatic equivalence" of words and phrases rather than rendering formal literal translations (Dunn 1977: 81).

The Chinese character [[wikt:ÈÅì|ÈÅì]] for ''d√†o'' "way; path; say; the [[Tao|Dao]]" or ''d«éo'' "guide; lead; instruct" (or [[wikt:Â∞é|Â∞é]]) provides a good sample entry for a dictionary because it has two pronunciations and is [[polysemy|polysemous]].
:'''ÈÅì''' 80.83 ''dauh'' „Ñâ„Ñ†Àã
:'''N. adjunct.''' A stripe, streak, course, issue: ‰∏ÄÈÅìÂÖâÔºåÊ∞£ a streak of light, a jet of gas; ‰∏ÄÈÅìË°óÔºåÊ≤≥ a street, a stream; ‚Ä¶ [3 more usage examples]
:'''N.''' ‚ë† Doctrine, body of moral teachings, truth: Â≠îÂ≠ü‰πãÈÅìÔºåÂÑíÈÅì teachings of Confucius and Mencius; ÈÇ™ÈÅìÔºåÂ∑¶ÈÅì heresy; the Tao of Taoism, the Way of Nature which cannot be given a name; ‚Ä¶ [8 examples] ‚ë° Path, route: Âø´ËªäÈÅì speedway on city road; Ë°óÈÅì street; ‚Ä¶ [7 examples]
:'''V.i.''' ‚ë† To say: Ë™™ÈÅì (s.o.) says, (followed by quotation); Á¨ëÈÅì say with a smile or laugh; ‚Ä¶ [7 examples] ‚ë° Guide (u.f. Â∞é): ÈÅì‰πã‰ª•Âæ∑ (AC) guide them with morals.
:['''Words'''] lists 27 alphabetically arranged entries from "ÈÅìÁôΩ ''dauhbair'', n., spoken part of dialogue in Chin. opera." to "ÈÅìÂèã ''dauh-youu'', n., friends of same church or belief, friends sharing same interest (oft. referred to drug addicts)."
The first "N. adjunct." and third "V.i." part-of-speech sections refer to grammatical "[[noun adjunct]]" or [[Chinese measure word]] and "[[intransitive verb]]".

==Reception==
Reviewers of ''Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage'' have praised some aspects like the translation equivalents and censured others like the "instant" character indexing system. On the one hand, ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter Peggy Durdin calls the dictionary a "milestone in communication between the world's two largest linguistic groups, the Chinese‚Äêspeaking and English‚Äêspeaking peoples" (1972: 37). On the other, the American sinologist and historian [[Nathan Sivin]] says, "Despite a good deal of meretricious ballyhoo when it was published, Lin's book does not contain significant lexicographic innovations." (1976: 308).

Reviews are mentioned by English sinologist and translator David E. Pollard, "Lin Yutang is his own worst enemy: one can visualize the hackles of reviewers everywhere rising both at his claims, which are mostly phony, and his denials, which are often untrue." (1973: 786). After criticizing faults in Lin Yutang's dictionary, one reviewer gave a balanced conclusion, "the mistakes and omissions are far outweighed by his index system even with its kinks, and by his typable, indexable, computerizable romanization system, his generally excellent English translations, and his comprehensive and up-to-date entries." (Ching 1975: 524).

Lin Yutang's confusing Instant Index System has been widely criticized. Nathan Sivin surveyed users of the numerical system and found that most "consider it a nuisance to use" (1976: 309). What Lin called an "unforgettable instant index system", proved to be "an unnecessary and not easily remembered variation on the traditional four-corner arrangement" (Chan and Pollard 2001: 1100). Since most students of Chinese who purchase Lin's dictionary already know the conventional 214 radical-stroke and Four-Corner systems, they "may resent having to learn a new set of tricks", says Pollard, who suggests that "the process of compiling a Chinese dictionary will always bring out the mad inventor in people" (1973: 788). Ching says Lin's system is a "praiseworthy improvement" over previous Chinese-English dictionaries, but it is not as easy to use as an alphabetically arranged dictionary. Although the name Instant Index System "promises facility and speed in locating characters", it is often "difficult to locate them "instantly"," for two major reasons: the variability of Chinese characters and cases when dictionary users interpret the rule of geometric determination differently from what Lin intended. For example, according to the rule, it would be "most logical" to search for this character ''chin'' Á∑ä under number 30, the horizontal stroke ‰∏Ä at the top left, but it is classified under number 51, the [[radical 27|cliff radical]] ÂéÇ, and no cross-references are provided (1975: 522).

Lin's "Simplified Romatzyh" system of romanization also has detractors. While one reviewer called the romanization system "revolutionary even though it has been in existence for quite some time", and agreed with Lin that "as a learning tool, the "basic" GR is better" (Ching 1975: 522), others have been less impressed. "Casual users unwilling to master the complexities of its arrangement and transcription will find it practically inaccessible" (Sivin 1976: 309). The system "still remains daunting unless the reader finds compelling reasons" to use Lin's dictionary (Chan and Pollard 2001: 1100).

Many reviewers have commented on the wide range of entries in Lin's dictionary, which is aimed not at students of a special field, but at "modern, educated man" (Durdin 1972: 37). Lin Yutang's introduction says many dictionary entries come from Wang Yi's (1937-1945) ''Gwoyeu Tsyrdean'' ÂúãË™ûËæ≠ÂÖ∏ "Dictionary of the National Language". Sivin calls Lin's dictionary "largely an English translation of the excellent" ''Gwoyeu Tsyrdean'' (1976: 308). Pollard criticizes Lin's list of Chinese terms that had "never been carefully noted" prior to his dictionary, since all that he did was to translate the half that are "carefully noted" in the Wang's dictionary, while ''Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary'' (1931, 1943) also includes half of the terms. "To have gutted the ''Gwoyeu Tsyrdean'' would by itself have been a worthwhile job, but he has done more, by selectively expanding and explaining and, particularly, by adding a host of new terms and expressions" (1973: 786-787).

Eugene Ching says that Lin Yutang's choice of modernized entries "makes his dictionary the most up-to-date available today" (1975: 522). Ching analyzed the 120 entries under ''chu'' Âá∫ "go out; come out" in Lin Yutang's ''Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage'' with the 170 in Wang's ''Gwoyeu Tsyrdean'' and found that Lin added and eliminated certain types of lexical items. In the process of addition, Lin not only incorporated new lexical items (e.g., ''taanbair'' Âù¶ÁôΩ "confess one's own guilt in communist meeting"), but also included new meanings for old items ("a girl secretary in office kept for her looks rather than work" for ''huapirng'' Ëä±Áì∂(ÂÖí) "flower vase"). Eliminated items include: obsolete or rare terms (''chudueihtzy'' Âá∫ÈöäÂ≠ê "a poetic pattern"), expressions whose meanings can be synthesized (''chubaan faa'' Âá∫ÁâàÊ≥ï "publication codes"), and highly literary expressions (''chu-choou-yarng-jir'' Âá∫ÈÜúÊèöÁñæ "to expose the ugliness and defects"). However, this process of elimination gave rise to mistakes, such as omitting some common literary clich√©s (''chu-erl-faan-er'' Âá∫ÁàæÂèçÁàæ "outstanding") and overlooking frequently used meanings ("to complete the apprenticeship" for ''chu-shyw'' Âá∫Â∏´ "to march army for battle").

Lin Yutang's ''Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage'' has been repeatedly criticized for not including more vocabulary developed in the PRC. Lin's dictionary "covers essential Chinese as spoken and written today outside the People's Republic and ignores terminology peculiar to mainland China" (Sivin 1976: 309). Dunn estimates that only about 1% of the total number of entries are "Chinese Communist words and phrases", such as ''xi√†f√†ng'' ‰∏ãÊîæ "[[Sent-down youth|send down]] urban cadres to work at a lower level or do manual labor in the countryside" and ''D√† yu√® j√¨n'' Â§ßË∑ÉËøõ "[[Great Leap Forward]]" (1977: 81). Although Lin's dictionary includes words from many modern sources, "What is left out, unfortunately for most potential users, is the vocabulary developed in the People's Republic" (Pollard 1973: 787).

Reviewers have frequently commended Lin's dictionary for its accurate English translation equivalents of each head character and its multiple usage examples. Sivin says that "in accuracy of translation, clarity of explanation, and colloquialism of English equivalents this is greatly superior to any other dictionary in a Western European language" 1976: 309). "Lin Yutang's business is in words, and he knows how they are manipulated; he also has a very wide knowledge of things Chinese, which helps him immeasurably in his task. Of course there are instances where better English equivalents could have been found, and his scholarship is not infallible, but it probably is true, as Professor Li claims, that he is uniquely qualified, among individuals, to bridge the gap between the two languages." (Pollard 1973: 787).

Several scholars have found faults with the dictionary's treatment of parts-of-speech and syntactic categories. Lin's main claim "to have solved at one stroke the problem of Chinese grammar by classifying words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs and prepositions, would need some justifying, since it is ultimately based on the premise that Chinese is the same as Latin", and a scheme that is only a "[[wikt:pis-aller|pis-aller]] should not be presented as a revelation" (Pollard 1973: 787). Ching says the best way grammar can be taught in a dictionary is through sample phrases or sentences, but without appropriate examples, the "students depending upon this dictionary for self-study will find the grammatical labels alone not really useful" (1975: 524). Sivin describes Lin's grouping of words by English parts of speech as "linguistically retrograde and confusing, since the structure of Chinese is quite different" (1976: 308). Lin explained that, "most linguists have doubted whether Chinese has anything that could be called grammar. Well, one certainly cannot discover grammar until one recognizes and thinks in terms of whole words, which are parts of speech‚Äînouns, verbs and so on. Then one sees that Chinese grammar exists." (Durdin 1972: 37).

Lastly, Lin Yutang's dictionary has some minor mistakes (Ching 1975: 524). One example of translation error is found under the very first entry, ''tsair'' Êâç; ''tsairmauh'' ÊâçË≤å "personal appearance as reflecting ability" is translationally incompatible with ''larng-tsair-nyuumauh'' ÈÉéÊâçÂ•≥Ë≤å "the boy has talent and the girl has looks" (under ÈÉé) and ''tsair-mauh-shuang-chyuarn'' ÊâçË≤åÈõôÂÖ® "to have both talent and looks" (under ÂÖ®). Another example of carelessness is seen under the sequential entries ''shyu'' Êàç "Garrison; frontier guard" and ''shuh'' Êàå "No. 11 in the [[Earthly Branches|duodecimal cycle]]", where Lin warns students to distinguish the characters from each other. Yet, the ''chiaan'' ÈÅ£ entry writes the example word ''chiaanshuh'' ÈÅ£Êàå "send to exile" twice as "ÈÅ£Êàç"; an error that the revised 1987 edition corrected. Admittedly, these two [[ideographic]] characters are easily confused, ''x≈´'' Êàå (Êàä "a weapon" and a horizontal stroke ‰∏Ä signifying "to wound") "destroy; 11th" and ''sh√π'' Êàç (Êàä "a weapon" and a dot ‰∏∂ simplified from the original ‰∫∫ "person" signifying "person with a weapon") "frontier guard" ([[Bernard Karlgren]], [[Wenlin]] 2016). Eugene Ching concludes that, "Since his profound knowledge of both Chinese and English makes Lin one of the most qualified persons to work on a bilingual dictionary, it is impossible that he is ignorant of the correct translation and the correct grammar of the above examples. These mistakes can only suggest Lin's failure to proofread carefully the work of his assistants."

The [[ecclesiastical]] words most commonly [[abbreviate]]d at all times are [[proper name]]s, [[title]]s (official or customary), of persons or [[corporation]]s, and words of frequent occurrence. A list of those used in [[Roman Republic]]an and early [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] times may be seen in [[James Chidester Egbert, Jr.]]'s ''[[Latin Inscriptions]]'' ([[New York City]], 1896), 417‚Äì459.

The [[Jewish]] scribes and [[Talmudic]] scholars also had frequent recourse to abbreviations. Between the seventh and ninth centuries the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] system of abbreviations gave way to a more difficult one that gradually grew up in the monastic houses and in the chanceries of the new [[Germanic peoples|Teutonic]] kingdoms. [[Merovingian]], [[Lombardic language|Lombard]], and [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] scripts offer each their own abbreviations, not to speak of the unique scotica manus or libri scottice scripti ([[Irish language|Irish]] hand, or books written in the medieval Irish hand). Eventually such productive centres of technical manuscripts as the [[Papal Chancery]], the theological schools of [[Paris]] and [[Oxford]], and the civil-law school of [[Bologna]] set the standards of abbreviations for all [[Europe]].

Medieval manuscripts abound in abbreviations, owing in part to the abandonment of the [[uncial]], or [[quasi]]-uncial, and the almost universal use of the cursive, hand. The medieval writer inherited a few from [[Christian]] antiquity; others he invented or adapted, in order to save time and parchment. They are found especially in manuscripts of scholastic theology and canon law, annals and chronicles, the Roman law, and in administrative documents, civil and privileges, bulls, rescripts. They multiplied with time, and were never so numerous as on the eve of the discovery of printing; many of the early printed books offer this peculiarity, together with other characteristics of the manuscript page.

The development of printing brought about the abandonment of many abbreviations, while it suggested and introduced new ones a process also favoured by the growth of ecclesiastical legislation, the creation of new offices, etc. There was less medieval abbreviation in the text of books much used on public occasions, e.g. missals, antiphonaries, Bibles; in one way or another the needs of students seem to have been the chief cause of the majority of medieval abbreviations. The means of abbreviation were usually full points or dots (mostly in Roman antiquity), the semicolon (eventually conventionalized), lines (horizontal, perpendicular, oblong, wavy curves, and commas). Vowel-sounds were frequently written not after, but over, the consonants. Certain letters, like p and q, that occur with extreme. frequency, e.g. in prepositions and terminations, became the source of many peculiar abbreviations; similarly, frequently recurring words like et (and), est (is). Habit and convenience are today the principal motives for using abbreviations. Most of those in actual use fall under one or other of the following heads: [[Administration (business)|Administrative]], [[Liturgical]], [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]], and [[Chronological]].

==Administrative==
The first class of abbreviations includes those used in the composition of [[Pontifical]] documents. They were once very numerous, and lists of them may be seen in the works quoted below (e.g. [[Quantin]], [[Prou]]). It may be well to state at once that since 29 December 1878, by order of [[Leo&amp;nbsp;XIII]], the great papal documents ([[Litterae Apostolicae]]) are no longer written in the old [[goths|Gothic]] hand known as bollatico; all abbreviations, with the exception of a few obvious ones, like S.R.E., were abolished by the same authority ([[Acta Sanctae Sedis]], XI, 465‚Äì467). In the transaction of ordinary business the [[Roman Congregations]] are wont to use certain brief and pithy formulas (e.g. Negative = "[[Yes and no|No]]"; Negative et amplius = "No with emphasis"). They are not, correctly speaking, abbreviations. For a list of these see [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]]. This class includes also the abbreviations for the names of most sees. The full [[Latin]] titles of all existing (Latin) dioceses may be seen in the Roman annual, "[[Gerarchia Cattolica]]", a complete list of the Latin names of all known dioceses (extant or extinct) is found in the large folio work of the [[Count|Comte]] de [[Mas Latrie]], "Tr√©sor de chronologie, d'histoire et de g√©ographie" (Paris, 1884). For the same purpose the reader may also consult the episcopal catalogues of the [[Benedictine]] [[Pius Bonifacius Gams]], "[[Series Episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae]]" ([[Ratisbon]], 1873‚Äì86), and the [[Franciscan]] [[Conrad Eubel]], ''[[Hierarchia Catholica Medii √Üvi]]'' ([[M√ºnster]], 1898‚Äì1902). Under this general heading may be included all abbreviated forms of addresses in ordinary intercourse, whether of individuals or of members of religious orders, congregations, institutes, to which may be added the forms of addresses usual for members of [[Catholic]] lay societies and the [[Papal]] orders of merit. (See [[Catholic societies]], [[orders of merit]].) The abbreviations of the titles of [[Roman Congregations]], and of the individual canonical ecclesiastical authorities, belong also to this class.

==Liturgical==
A second class of abbreviations includes those used in the description of [[liturgical]] acts or the directions for their performance, e.g. the [[Holy Mass]], the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] ([[Breviary]]), the ecclesiastical devotions, etc. Here may also be classed the abbreviated forms for the name of [[God]], [[Jesus Christ]], and the [[Holy Ghost]]; also for the names of the [[Blessed Virgin]], the saints, etc.; likewise abbreviations used in the administration of the [[Sacraments]], mortuary epitaphs, etc. (to which class belong the numerous [[Catacomb]] inscriptions); finally some miscellaneous abbreviations like those used in the publication of documents concerning beatification and canonization.

==Scholastic==
In the third class belong scholastic abbreviations, used to designate honorific titles acquired in the schools, to avoid the repetition of lengthy titles of books and reviews, or to facilitate reference to ecclesiastical and civil legislation.

==Chronological==
In the fourth class of abbreviations belong all such as are used to describe the elements of the year, civil or ecclesiastical.

[[Image:Nagoya Boston Museum of Fine Arts.JPG|thumb|Kanayama South Building where the museum was located]]
The {{nihongo|'''Nagoya/Boston Museum of Fine Arts (N/BMFA)'''|ÂêçÂè§Â±ã„Éú„Çπ„Éà„É≥ÁæéË°ìÈ§®|Nagoya Bosuton Bijutsukan}} was an [[art museum]] located in [[Nagoya]], [[Japan]].

== History ==
It was the sister museum of the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] (the MFA) and was established in partnership with the Foundation for the Arts, Nagoya (FAN) partly to help bring the treasures of the MFA's collection, particularly those of types rarely exhibited in Japan, to the country. The museum formally opened on April 17, 1999. 

Each year, the MFA, Boston sent two five-month loan exhibitions to the Nagoya museum; longer-term, five year exhibits were also provided. Despite the desire of N/BMFA's curators to display primarily Japanese and [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] art, the MFA, Boston had insisted on a more wide-ranging display. A small number of items were, nevertheless, sent regularly for the Nagoya museum's "Japanese corner". 

The Nagoya museum was described{{By whom|date=December 2009}} as part of Boston's [[Malcolm Rogers (curator)|Malcolm Rogers]]' attempt to "internationalize" the institution.

The museum suffered financial difficulties due to low visitor numbers, which resulted in its eventual closure in October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20181008/k10011663621000.html|title=ÂêçÂè§Â±ã„Éú„Çπ„Éà„É≥ÁæéË°ìÈ§®„ÅåÈñâÈ§® ÂÖ•È§®ËÄÖÊï∞„ÅÆÊ∏õÂ∞ë„Å™„Å©„Åß {{!}} NHK„Éã„É•„Éº„Çπ|last=Êó•Êú¨ÊîæÈÄÅÂçî‰ºö|work=NHK„Éã„É•„Éº„Çπ|access-date=2018-10-08|language=ja-JP}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its final exhibition, "In Pursuit of Happiness: Favorite Works from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston", was held between July and October of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2018/07/17/arts/openings-outside-tokyo/pursuit-happiness-favorite-works-museum-fine-arts-boston/|title='In Pursuit of Happiness: Favorite Works from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston' {{!}} The Japan Times|work=The Japan Times|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==

The museum operated a 4,700 square meter (50,590&amp;nbsp;ft¬≤) facility on three levels, including 1,400 square meters (15,069&amp;nbsp;ft¬≤) of exhibition galleries. The architecture of the museum was contemporary but nonetheless meant to reflect that of the neoclassical MFA building in Boston, especially its white granite facade. A 31-story hotel building is attached to the building that housed the museum.

It was accessible from [[Kanayama Station (Aichi)|Kanayama Station]] on the [[Central Japan Railway Company|Central Japan Railway]], the local [[Meitetsu]] rail system, and the [[Nagoya City Subway]].

The '''National Land and Property Gazetteer''' (NLPG) is an initiative in England and Wales to provide a definitive and consistent [[address (geography)|address]] infrastructure. Up until recently Great Britain has not held a single list of all addresses in the country, meaning that many government and private services have not been sure if addresses from differing sources refer to the same or different properties.

The NLPG is made up of the input of [[Local Land and Property Gazetteer]]s (LLPGs) maintained by local authorities that are the creators of all address information excepting postcodes. The NLPG then acts as a central repository or "hub" for LLPGs maintained by local authorities. The NLPG also enforces compliance by local authorities with the national standard for the representation of address information, [[British Standard]] 7666 (BS7666), and coordinates and enforces the maintenance of LLPGs by local authorities.

The NLPG is managed by the company [[GeoPlace]], which is a public sector limited liability partnership between the Local Government Association (LGA) and Ordnance Survey.

The NLPG does not just hold addresses where people work or live, or addresses that have a postal address. The NLPG also includes 'non-addressable properties that are of no use for postal deliveries but can be vital information for emergency response, asset insurance, planning issues, repair and maintenance, and many other activities.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egovmonitor.com/node/1214 |accessdate=December 8, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518160156/http://www.egovmonitor.com/node/1214 |archivedate=May 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many ways the information held by the NLPG may be considered to hold a national model of land and property in the UK.

Although the NLPG may be considered to be in an intermediate stage of development, its usage has been taken up by a number of public and private organisations as it provides the most complete register of land and property in the UK.

==National spatial address infrastructure==
On 26 May 2005 the [[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]] proposed that ownership of the NLPG transfer from the IDeA to [[Ordnance Survey]] to allow for the creation of the [[National Spatial Address Infrastructure]] (NSAI).

On 3 December 2010, the [[Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government]] announced the formation of [[GeoPlace]] to provide a freely-available national address gazetteer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlpg.org.uk/nlpg/document.htm?targ=883 |title=document viewer |website=NLPG.org.uk |date=2011-02-22 |accessdate=2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a joint venture between the [[Local Government Association]] (LGA) and [[Ordnance Survey]] which included the acquisition of [[Intelligent Addressing]], the company that initially envisioned and coordinated the development of the NLPG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iahub.net/docs/1291201364675.pdf |format=PDF |title=New Ordnance Survey and Local Government joint venture acquires Intelligent Addressing and ends address confusion |website=Iahub.net |accessdate=2016-01-27
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the setting up of GeoPlace, NLPG data has been brought together with Ordnance Survey, Valuation Office Agency and Royal Mail data into the National Address Gazetteer infrastructure. The National Address Gazetteer infrastructure is the single source from which the AddressBase products from [[Ordnance Survey]] are developed. Through agreement between Ordnance Survey and Scotland‚Äôs Improvement Service, working on behalf of Scottish Local Government, the National Address Gazetteer includes Scottish address data.

PRODML Standards support automated production data acquisition, operations monitoring, optimization, reporting, and configuration management business processes. PRODML-based interactions are used by production software components, including field data historians, surveillance applications, model analysis and management applications, optimization applications, simulation applications, etc. 

The PRODML initiative was started in 2005 by five energy companies: [[BP]], [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], [[ExxonMobil]], [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], and [[Statoil]], joined by eight supplier companies: [[Halliburton]], [[Invensys]], [[Kongsberg]], [[OSIsoft]], [[Petroleum Experts]], [[Schlumberger]], [[Tieto]], and [[Weatherford International|Weatherford]] as well as [[Energistics]].

PRODML Standards evolved from the Energistics family of standards for drilling, completions and interventions, [[WITSML]], initiated in 2000.

==EnergyML==

[[EnergyML]] is the foundation for consistency and interoperability among all Energistics data transfer families of standards, including besides the PRODML Standards, [[WITSML]] for drilling, completions, and interventions and [[RESQML]](tm) for reservoir characterization.

'''Paternalistic conservatism''' is a strand in [[conservatism]] which reflects the belief that societies exist and develop organically and that members within them have obligations towards each other.{{sfn|Heywood|2013|p=34}} There is particular emphasis on the [[Noblesse oblige|paternalistic obligation]] of those who are [[Social privilege|privileged]] and [[wealth]]y to the [[Poverty|poorer parts of society]]. Since it is consistent with principles such as [[Organic unity|organicism]], [[hierarchy]] and [[duty]], it can be seen an outgrowth of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditional conservatism]]. Paternal conservatives support neither the [[individual]] nor the [[State (polity)|state]] in principle, but are instead prepared to support either or recommend a balance between the two depending on what is most practical.{{sfn|Heywood|2012|p=80}}

== One-nation conservatism ==
[[File:Benjamin Disraeli by Cornelius Jabez Hughes, 1878.jpg|thumb|[[Benjamin Disraeli]], widely considered the architect of [[one-nation conservatism]]]]
[[One-nation conservatism]] was first conceived by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]],{{sfn|Dorey|1995|pp=16-17}} who presented his political philosophy in two novels, ''[[Sybil (novel)|Sybil, Or The Two Nations]]'' and ''[[Coningsby (novel)|Coningsby]]'', published in 1845 and 1844 respectively.&lt;ref name=Heywood82&gt;Heywood 2007, pp. 82‚Äì83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Dana Arnold]]|title=Cultural Identities and the Aesthetics of Britishness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WfmC9qWNYdMC&amp;pg=PA96|year=2004|publisher=Manchester University Press|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli's conservatism proposed a paternalistic society with the [[social class]]es intact, but with the [[working class]] receiving support from [[the Establishment]]. He emphasised the importance of [[social obligation]] rather than the [[individualism]] that pervaded his society.{{sfn|Dorey|1995|pp=16‚Äì17}} Disraeli warned that Britain would become divided into two nations (of the rich and poor) as a result of increased [[industrialisation]] and [[Economic inequality|inequality]].&lt;ref name=Heywood82/&gt; Concerned at this division, he supported measures to improve the lives of the people to provide social support and protect the working classes.{{sfn|Dorey|1995|pp=16‚Äì17}}

Disraeli justified his ideas by his belief in an [[Organicism|organic society]] in which the different classes have natural obligations to one another.{{sfn|Dorey|1995|pp=16-17}} He saw society as naturally hierarchical and emphasised the obligation of those at the top to those below. This was based in the feudal concept of ''[[noblesse oblige]]'', which asserted that the [[aristocracy]] had an obligation to be generous and honourable and to Disraeli this implied that government should be paternalistic.&lt;ref name=Heywood82/&gt; Unlike the [[New Right]], one-nation conservatism takes a pragmatic and non-ideological approach to politics and accepts the need for flexible policies as one-nation conservatives have often sought compromise with their ideological opponents for the sake of [[Status quo|social stability]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloor 2010, pp. 41‚Äì42.&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli justified his views pragmatically by arguing that should the [[ruling class]] become indifferent to the suffering of the people, society would become unstable and [[social revolution]] would become a possibility.{{sfn|Dorey|1995|pp=16-17}}

== Catholic political movements in the 19th century ==
In Europe, Catholic political movements emerged in the 19th century as a response to widespread deterioration of social conditions and rising [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] and [[Democracy|democratic]] tendencies amongst artisans and workers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#eley|Eley]] (1997), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; It mixed social commitment, paternalistic social welfare and authoritarian patronage from above with deepening popular piety.&lt;ref&gt;[[#eley|Eley]] (1997), pp. 174‚Äì175.&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the influence of these doctrines can be seen in the [[conservative socialism]] of [[Albert de Mun]] and [[Ren√© de La Tour du Pin]]. The [[Conservatism in Germany|German conservative]] [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] figure [[Adolf Stoecker]] founded the [[Christian Social Party (Germany)|Christian Social Workers' Party]] in 1878 that aimed to align workers with [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christianity]] and the [[House of Hohenzollern|German monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Dietze. ''In Defense of Property''. Lanham, Maryland, US; London, England, UK: University Press of America, 1995, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Stoecker respected existing social hierarchies, but he also desired a [[State (polity)|state]] that would be active in protecting the poor and vulnerable citizens.&lt;ref name="university2000"&gt;Albert S. Lindemann. ''Esau's Tears: Modern Anti-Semitism and the Rise of the Jews''. First paperback edition. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, US; Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; Madrid, Spain: Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Stoecker on occasion used [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] rhetoric to gain support, though he urged supporters to practice Christian love even towards Jews.&lt;ref name="university2000"/&gt;

== Otto von Bismarck ==
[[File:Otto F√ºrst von Bismarck.JPG|thumb|[[Otto von Bismarck]] promoted [[State Socialism (Germany)|State Socialism]] policies as remedial measures to appease the [[working class]] and detract support for [[socialism]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] following earlier attempts to achieve the same objective through Bismarck's [[Anti-Socialist Laws]]]]
19th-century [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] adopted policies of state-organized compulsory insurance for workers against sickness, accident, incapacity and old age in what has been nicknamed "Bismarckian socialism", better known as "[[State Socialism (Germany)|State Socialism]]".&lt;ref name="development1988"&gt;Alan John Percivale Taylor. ''The Course of German History: A Survey of the Development of German History''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, U.S.: Routledge, 1988, 2001, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was actually coined by Bismarck's [[Liberalism in Germany|liberal]] opposition, but later accepted by Bismarck.&lt;ref&gt;''Bismarck'', Edgar Feuchtwanger, (2002) p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Bismarck himself was not a [[Socialism|socialist]] and enacted the [[Anti-Socialist Laws]], rather his actions were designed to offset the growth of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]].&lt;ref name="development1988"/&gt; Bismarck's policies have been viewed as a form of [[state socialism]].&lt;ref name="transaction1989"&gt;[[#Harris|Harris]] (1989), p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bismark's State Socialism was based upon [[Romanticism|Romantic]] political thought in which the state was supreme and carried out Bismarck's agenda of supporting "the protest of [[collectivism]] against [[individualism]]" and of "[[Nationalism|nationality]] against [[cosmopolitanism]]" and stated that "the duty of the State is to maintain and promote the interests, the well-being of the nation as such".&lt;ref name="transaction1989"/&gt;

The academic equivalent of Bismarck's State Socialism at the time was the ''[[Historical school of economics|Kathedersozialismus]]'' of [[Adolph Wagner]] and [[Gustav Schmoller]].&lt;ref name="transaction1989"/&gt; Schmoller was an opponent of both [[liberalism]] and [[Marxism|Marxian]] [[Proletariat|proletarian]] [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]].&lt;ref name="transaction1989"/&gt; Wagner had originally been a [[Manchester Liberalism|Manchester liberal]], but he had developed into a [[Far-right politics|far-right]] conservative and antisemite.&lt;ref name="antisemitism1"&gt;Marcel Stoetzler. ''The State, the Nation, &amp; the Jews: Liberalism and the Antisemitism Dispute in Bismarck's Germany''. University of Nebraska, 2008, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kathedersozialists'' held in common three tenets, namely that "[[economic freedom]] cannot be absolute", "the [[economy]] must obey ethical as well as practical demands" and "the state must intervene to provide a degree of social justice".&lt;ref name="antisemitism1"/&gt; Schmoller denied that [[free trade]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[economics]] were suitable for Germany, instead advocating [[Economic interventionism|state intervention in the economy]] to foster [[industrialism]] and improving conditions for labourers.&lt;ref name="transaction1989"/&gt; Schmoller endorsed the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian monarchy]] as historically being a "benevolent and socially mediating institution".&lt;ref name="antisemitism1"/&gt; Schmoller stated: "A firm monarchy is a great blessing when it is bound up with traditions like those of the Prussian monarchy, which recognizes its duties".&lt;ref name="transaction1989"/&gt;

==Red tory==
{{Main|Red Tory}}
A '''Red Tory''' is an adherent of a political philosophy derived from the [[Tory]] tradition, predominantly in Canada, but also in the United Kingdom. This philosophy tends to favour communitarian social policies, while maintaining a degree of fiscal discipline and a respect of social and political order. In Canada, Red Toryism is found in provincial and federal Conservative political parties. The history of Red Toryism marks differences in the development of the [[political culture of Canada|political cultures of Canada]] and the [[Political culture:United States#Political culture|United States]]. [[Canadian conservatism]] and [[American conservatism]] have been different from each other in fundamental ways, including their stances on social issues and the role of government in society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/conservatism/ "Conservatism"], ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;

The adjective "red" refers to the economically left-leaning nature of Red Toryism in comparison with Blue Toryism, since socialist and other leftist parties have traditionally used the [[Political colour#Red|colour red]]. In Canada today, however, red is commonly associated with the centre-left [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]]. The term reflects the broad ideological range traditionally found within conservatism in Canada.

== Critique by free-market conservatives and socialists ==
The term [[right-wing socialism]]&lt;ref name="prospects1"&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. ''Left, Right, and the Prospects for Liberty''. Auburn, Alabama, U.S.: Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2010, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Huerta de Soto|2010|page=80}} is a term used by some [[Free market|free-market]] [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] movements and politicians to describe paternalistic conservatism as they see it supporting [[paternalism]] and [[Solidarity|social solidarity]] as opposed to [[individualism]], [[commercialism]] and ''laissez-faire'' economics.&lt;ref name="conservative2006"/&gt;{{sfn|Huerta de Soto|2010|pp=79‚Äì80}} They argue that paternalist conservatism supports state promoted [[Social stratification|social hierarchy]] and allows certain people and groups to hold higher status in such a hierarchy, which is conservative.{{sfn|Huerta de Soto|2010|p=79}} The term is also used‚Äîmore commonly, but distinctly‚Äîto refer to [[Third Way|moderate social democratic]] forms of socialism when contrasted with [[Marxism‚ÄìLeninism]] and other more radical left-wing alternatives. In ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] criticised the ''[[Philosophy of Poverty]]'' by the [[Anarchism|anarchist]] writer and theorist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] as representing [[Bourgeois socialism|conservative or bourgeois socialism]]. [[Right-wing socialism#"War Socialism" during World War I|Military socialism]], [[guild socialism]], [[agrarian socialism]] and some forms of [[Christian socialism]] are also termed right-wing socialism by various authors.{{sfn|Huerta de Soto|2010|p=80}}

=== Usage of conservative socialism by various authors ===
The term [[conservative socialism]] was used as a rebuke by Karl Marx for certain strains of socialism, but it has also been used by proponents of such a system.&lt;ref name="conservative2006"&gt;[[#Viereck|Viereck]] (2006), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early proponent of self-described conservative socialism was 19th-century Austrian politician [[Klemens von Metternich]] as early as 1847.&lt;ref name="conservative2006"/&gt; [[Monarchism|Monarchists]] had begun to use [[Socialism|socialist]] as an antithesis of "[[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] ''[[laissez-faire]]''" indicating reliance on a social conscience as opposed to pure individualism.&lt;ref name="conservative2006"/&gt; Metternich said the aims of such a conservative socialism were "peaceful, class-harmonizing, cosmopolitan, traditional".&lt;ref&gt;[[#viereck|Viereck]] (2006), pp. 74‚Äì75.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monarchic socialism]] promoted social paternalism portraying the monarch as having a fatherly duty to protect his people from the effects of free economic forces.&lt;ref name="conservative1"&gt;[[#viereck|Viereck]] (2006), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Metternich's conservative socialism saw [[liberalism]] and [[nationalism]] as forms of [[Middle class|middle-class]] dictatorship over [[Commoner|the masses]].&lt;ref name="conservative1"/&gt;

[[Johann Karl Rodbertus]], a monarchist conservative landowner and lawyer who briefly served as minister of education in [[Prussia]] in 1848, promoted a form of [[state socialism]] led by an [[Enlightened absolutism|enlightened monarchy]] supporting [[Regulatory economics|state regulation of the economy]].&lt;ref name="intelligentsia1989"&gt;Marshall S. Shatz. ''Jan Waclaw Machajski: A Radical Critic of the Russian Intelligentsia and Socialism''. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, US: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1989, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Rodbertus supported the elimination of [[private ownership of land]], with [[State capitalism|the state in control of national capital rather than redistribution of private capital]].&lt;ref name="intelligentsia1989"/&gt; In the 1880s, Rodbertus' conservative socialism was promoted as a non-revolutionary alternative to [[social democracy]] and a means to justify the acceptance of Bismarck's social policies.&lt;ref name="intelligentsia1989"/&gt;

[[File:Hillary Clinton and her largest donor Peter Paul.jpg|thumb|201x201px|Hillary Clinton and Peter Paul at the [[Gala Hollywood Farewell Salute to President Clinton]].]]
'''''Paul v. Clinton''''' was a [[Lawsuit|civil lawsuit]] filed by [[Peter F. Paul]], the [[plaintiff]], against the [[Defendant|defendants]], former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]], and his wife, former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Hillary Clinton]].

The fundraiser was held on the eve of the [[Democratic National Convention]], during Hillary Clinton's [[United States Senate election in New York, 2000|first Senate race]].

However, Paul said that these promises were never fulfilled. Although he contended the event cost close to $2 million, the campaign reports filed with the [[Federal Election Commission]] at the time estimated at about $500,000.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321124348/http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=3738672|title=Court Says Clinton Should Not Be in Suit|last=Risling|first=Greg|date=October 16, 2007|work=ABC News|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Peter Paul helped organize the [[Gala Hollywood Farewell Salute to President Clinton]] fundraiser for the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's 2000 [[New York (state)|New York]] Senate campaign, which raised more than $1 million for her campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jul/20/business/fi-stanlee20|title=Money, Politics and the Undoing of Stan Lee Media|last=Cieply|first=Michael|date=July 20, 2003|work=The Los Angeles Times|access-date=|last2=Bates|first2=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Paul's promise to help with her campaign, court filings state that in return for working for one year at Stan Lee Media, he offered Mr. Clinton $10 million in SLM stock, $5 million in cash and $1 million for the Clinton Library.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2001/06/28/a-clinton-donor-with-a-bone-to-pick/ed3dbe79-5832-4468-9d85-fae3e1200e20/|title=A Clinton Donor With a Bone to Pick|last=Novak|first=Robert D.|date=June 28, 2001|work=The Washington Post|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Two days after the dinner and concert, a columnist at the [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]], Lloyd Grove, reported about Paul's felony record, revealing that he had three separate criminal convictions on fraud and drug charges from the 1970s and 1980s at the time. In the late 1970s, Paul was convicted of [[cocaine]] possession with intentions to distribute and of attempting to defraud [[Fidel Castro|Fidel Castro]]'s Cuban Government of $8.75 million by selling it a non-existent shipload of coffee beans. Paul was sentenced to approximately 40 months in prison. In the 1980s, he violated his terms of [[parole]] by lying to a Customs officer, which resulted in him serving time again. When Paul was arrested for all of these crimes, he claimed that he was part of a secret government operation.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.factcheck.org/2008/01/crooked-claims-about-clinton/|title=Crooked Claims About Clinton|last=Novak|first=Viveca|date=January 18, 2008|website=Factcheck.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Howard Wolfson]], Hillary Clinton's spokesperson, said that her campaign would not accept any contributions from Paul&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;, they returned the $2000 check they directly received from him and his wife, but ignored Paul's alleged $1.9 million contribution.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Following the collapse and declaration of [[bankruptcy]] of Stan Lee Media in early February 2001, Paul departed for Brazil to avoid [[Prosecutor|prosecution]] of [[Securities fraud|stock fraud]] charges, more specifically he manipulated the price of the Stan Lee Media's stock price. He was indicted with criminal charges and spent more than two years in a Brazilian prison, before being extradited back to the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2009/07/after-4-years-clintons-accuser-sentenced-to-10-020086|title=After 4 years, Clintons' accuser sentenced to 10|last=Gerstein|first=Josh|date=July 22, 2009|website=Politico|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2005-2009 ==

=== The Gala Hollywood Farewell Salute to President Clinton ===
In late 2005, one of Hillary Clinton's fundraising committees agreed to pay a $35,000 fine for underreporting gifts spent on the Hollywood gala by $721,895 to boost her campaign for the Senate. Even though the committee had corrected its filings, Paul continuously said that the campaign was still refusing to acknowledge his alleged near $2 million contribution.

=== Senator Clinton Dropped from Lawsuit ===
[[File:Ronaldreaganstatebuilding.jpg|thumb|California's Second District Court of Appeal]]
On April 10, 2006 at the [[Los Angeles County]] [[Superior Court]], Judge Aurelio Munoz dismissed [[Senate|Senator]] Hillary Clinton as the defendant in the Paul v. Clinton lawsuit. Judge Munoz Brough criticized Peter Paul's legal team for "inundat[ing] this court" with photos of Paul with the Clintons, President [[Ronald Reagan]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;and his wife, [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]], and others, which provided no evidence that the Clintons made any promises to him. The judge stated, "there is nothing to indicate Hillary Clinton was aware that the promises were not made in good faith." She sought out dismissal under a California law aimed at reducing lawsuits and protecting people's First Amendment rights. Before Hillary was dismissed, the attorneys representing Paul, the United States Justice Foundation, asked that they have permission to take her deposition, but Judge Munoz declined. Although Senator Clinton was dismissed from the case, the lawsuit continued with Bill Clinton, James Levin, Aaron Tonken and Gary Smith as defendants, and their trial date was set for March 27, 2007.

Later, Peter Paul then filed an appeal of the decision. Two [[Hearing (law)|hearings]] were held on September 7, 2007, and October 16, 2007, where [[California Courts of Appeal#Second District|California's Second District Court of Appeal]] denied the motion to reinstate Senator Hillary Clinton as the defendant in the lawsuit that claims she, her husband and other associates swindled money from Paul to fund the 2000 fundraising event. The [[appellate court]] upheld the lower court's, [[Los Angeles County]] [[Superior Court]], decision to remove the New York senator and Democratic [[United States presidential election, 2008|presidential candidate]], while it also said that Clinton would be able to regain her legal costs. After the ruling, Paul said he would consider a further appeal to the [[Supreme Court of California]]. Most, but not all of the causes of action against President Clinton had been dismissed on procedural grounds. Paul‚Äôs attorneys, mainly Colette Wilson, pleaded that Clinton violated federal code, which would in turn make her not covered the [[anti-SLAPP]] statute. A lawyer of Paul, Lucianne Goldberg, then released a video claiming that Clinton was aware of Paul‚Äôs illegal campaign activities. However, the evidence he provided did not make his statement clear at all. It only showed Hillary Clinton thanking the fundraiser organizers, without proving anything on Clinton‚Äôs knowledge of Paul‚Äôs alleged actions.

In early March 2005, Paul pleaded guilty to one felony of stock fraud. Four years later on June 25, 2009, Judge Leonard Wexler sentenced him to ten years in prison. This was said to have pretty much been the end to the story, mainly because the [[Washington Post]] had then become aware that Peter Paul was a three-time convicted felon, making his appeals less interesting. As of early 2009, Hillary and Bill Clinton have both been dismissed from the case, Paul v. Clinton, as defendants, and she won an award of $130,000 in legal fees against Paul. The civil suit was still on-going against Gary Smith, a producer of the 2000 fundraiser.

=== Anthologies/ Collections/ Groups ===
PennSound hosts recordings that are part of anthologies, collections and groups, such as readings and discussions of poetics that took place as part of the same academic conference, readings from different poets at the same event, and readings from poetry and poetics symposiums.  Such collections include the LEGEND recording from 1981, with readings from [[Bruce Andrews]], [[Ron Silliman]], [[Ray DiPalma]], and [[Charles Bernstein]], readings from a celebration of [[Hart Crane]], and readings from the Festival of Contemporary Japanese Women Poets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/anthologies.php PennSound Anthologies]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Singles Archive ===
A searchable alphabetized archive of single recordings contains individual poems, introductions to readings, and other miscellaneous recordings on the PennSound website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/singles/ PennSound Singles]&lt;/ref&gt;

PennSound recently added a selection of poetry related videos, including videos from the 2004 Louis Zukofsky Centennial Conference, films of [[Hannah Weiner]] and [[Armand Schwerner]] by Phill Niblock, and videos of [[Jerome Rothenberg]] in conversation and discussion at the Kelly Writers House.&lt;ref&gt;[http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/video.php PennSound Cinema]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PennSound Podcasts ===

'''''People v. Stone''''', [[Supreme Court of California]], 46 Cal. 4th 131, 92 Cal. Rptr. 3d 362 (2009), is a [[criminal case]] in which the court set precedent for a theory of liability that a defendant is guilty of a single attempt to murder when multiple potential victims are in the [[kill zone]] and no one is killed, but if the intended target is not killed and an untargeted person in the kill zone is killed, defendant is guilty both of attempted murder of the target and is guilty of murder of the untargeted person killed.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2832">The '''Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award''', created in 1989 and named for the late longtime [[NFL commissioner]], [[Pete Rozelle]], is bestowed annually by the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] "for longtime exceptional contributions to radio and television in professional football".  Unlike the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]]'s comparable [[Ford C. Frick Award]], the Rozelle Award has occasionally been granted to broadcast executives and production people in addition to on-air personalities.

'''QRpedia''' is a [[mobile Web]] based system which uses [[QR code]]s to deliver [[Wikipedia]] articles to users, in their preferred language.&lt;ref name="EdenT-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shkspr.mobi/blog/index.php/2011/04/introducing-qrpedia/|title=Introducing QRpedia|last=Eden|first=Terence|date=2011-04-03|accessdate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CmoI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childrensmuseum.org/Childrens-Museum-Indianapolis-Creates-New-Learning-Opportunities-through-Wikipedian-in-Residence|title=The Children's Museum of Indianapolis Creates New Learning Opportunities through Wikipedian-in-Residence|last=Anon|date=2011-08-19|publisher=The Children's Museum of Indianapolis|accessdate=25 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329035310/http://www.childrensmuseum.org/Childrens-Museum-Indianapolis-Creates-New-Learning-Opportunities-through-Wikipedian-in-Residence|archivedate=29 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TO"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=L.|last2=Adams|first2=S.|title=The Technology Outlook for UK Tertiary Education 2011-201|url=http://www.nmc.org/pdf/2011-Technology-Outlook-UK.pdf|series=NMC Horizon Report Regional Analyses|year=2011|publisher=The New Media Consortium|location=Austin, Texas|isbn=978-0-615-38209-8|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005200523/http://www.nmc.org/pdf/2011-Technology-Outlook-UK.pdf|archivedate=2011-10-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; QR codes can easily be generated to link directly to any [[Uniform Resource Identifier]] (URI), but the QRpedia system adds further functionality. It is owned and operated by a subsidiary of [[Wikimedia UK]] (WMUK).

QRpedia was conceived by Roger Bamkin, a Wikipedia volunteer, coded by Terence Eden, and unveiled in April 2011. It is currently in use at museums and other institutions in countries including [[Australia]], [[Bulgaria]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Spain]], [[India]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[Ukraine]] and the [[United States]]. The project's source code is freely reusable under the [[MIT License]].

== Process ==
[[File:Derby Museum visitor uses QR Code.jpg|thumb|left|Visitors to [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery|Derby Museum]] using a [[mobile phone]] to scan a QRpedia QR code]]

When a user scans a QRpedia QR code on their [[mobile device]], the device decodes the QR code into a [[Uniform Resource Locator]] (URL) using the [[domain name]] "''languagecode''.qrwp.org" and whose [[Path segment|path]] (final part) is the title of a Wikipedia article, and sends a request for the article specified in the URL to the QRpedia [[web server]]. It also transmits the language setting of the device.&lt;ref name="ByrdPhillips-2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://midea.nmc.org/2011/06/qrpedia/|title=Going Multilingual with QRpedia|last=Byrd Phillips|first=Lori|date=2011-06-15|publisher=Marcus Institute for Digital Education in the Arts|accessdate=25 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ACwdLuzA?url=http://midea.nmc.org/2011/06/qrpedia/|archivedate=26 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The QRpedia server then uses Wikipedia's [[Application programming interface|API]]&lt;ref name="EdenT-1" /&gt; to determine whether there is a version of the specified Wikipedia article in the language used by the device, and if so, returns it in a mobile-friendly format.&lt;ref name="ByrdPhillips-2" /&gt; If there is no version of the article available in the preferred language, then the QRpedia server offers a choice of the available languages, or a [[Google Translate|Google translation]].

In this way, one QRcode can deliver the same article in many languages,&lt;ref name="ByrdPhillips-2" /&gt; even when the museum is unable to make its own translations. QRpedia also records usage statistics.&lt;ref name="ByrdPhillips-2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qrwp.org/stats.php?path=QRpedia|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713074153/http://qrwp.org/stats.php?path=QRpedia|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 July 2012|title=QRpedia Statistics (example)|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

QRpedia also has uses outside of such institutions. For example, the [[Occupy movement]] uses it on campaign posters.&lt;ref name="Occupy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wedontmakedemands.org/posters.php|title=We Don't Make Demands: Posters|date=2011-12-02|accessdate=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Award ==
In January 2012, QRpedia was one of four projects (from 79 entrants) declared the most innovative mobile companies in the UK of 2011 by the Smart UK Project, and thus chosen to compete at [[Mobile World Congress]] in Barcelona, on 29 February 2012.&lt;ref name="SmartUK" /&gt; The criteria were "to be effective, easy to understand and with global potential and impact".&lt;ref name="SmartUK2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartukproject.co.uk/archives/1730|title=Smart UK Project ‚Äì the final four|publisher=Smart UK Project|accessdate=19 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618162634/http://www.smartukproject.co.uk/archives/1730|archivedate=18 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wikimedia UK dispute ==
A conflict of interest case involving QRpedia was identified as one of the "main incidents" leading to a 2012 review of the governance of Wikimedia UK (WMUK). The review found that the amount of time taken to resolve ownership caused the risk of outsiders perceiving a potential conflict of interest, and that Bamkin's acceptance of consultancy fees on projects (jointly funded by WMUK) involving QRpedia provided an opportunity for damage to the reputation of WMUK. This conflict of interest led to the resignation of WMUK trustee Joscelyn Upendran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Young |first=Niki May |title=Wikimedia UK trustees have been 'too involved' to effectively govern charity |url=http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/governance/news/content/14428/wikimedia_uk_trustees_have_been_too_involved_to_govern_the_charity |date=8 February 2013 |accessdate=2013-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211023803/http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/governance/news/content/14428/wikimedia_uk_trustees_have_been_too_involved_to_govern_the_charity |archivedate=February 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before her resignation on 31 August 2012, Upendran stated that "the charity has in effect agreed to take on responsibility [...] for a service that is 'co-owned' by a trustee", and suggested that "the conflict of interest may present a legal risk under charity and corporate law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/02/13/wikimedia_uk_shape_up/|title=Review finds Wikipedia UK board needs major leadership overhaul|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 February 2013, WMUK announced that the intellectual property in QRpedia, and the qrpedia.org and qrwp.org domains, were to be transferred to the chapter at no cost.&lt;ref name="Keating"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimediauk-l/2013-February/010309.html|title=QRpedia|last=Keating|first=Chris|date=2013-02-09|publisher=[[Wikimedia UK]]|accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 February 2013, Michael Peel registered two QRpedia related domain names on behalf of WMUK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Mike_Peel/Wikimedia_compensation|title=User:Mike Peel/Wikimedia compensation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 April 2013, WMUK announced that Roger Bamkin and Terence Eden were transferring ownership of QRpedia to Wikimedia UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wikimedia.org.uk/2013/04/announcement-qrpedia-donated-to-wikimedia-uk/|title=Announcement ‚Äì QRpedia donated to Wikimedia UK - Wikimedia UK Blog|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 November 2013, WMUK announced that the agreement for the transfer had been signed and the IP rights in QRpedia were held by Cultural Outreach Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of WMUK, and that following the agreement, the transfer of the domain names was an administrative process that could begin immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.wikimedia.org.uk/w/index.php?title=Water_cooler&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47323|title=Difference between revisions of "Water cooler"|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Science Leadership Academy''' is a magnet public high school in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], which opened in September 2006. SLA is a partnership between The [[Franklin Institute]] and the [[School District of Philadelphia]]. SLA is a 1:1 project-based laptop school where all students and teachers use laptops as their primary learning tool.

==History==

Science Leadership Academy was created by the board of the [[Franklin Institute]] and founding principal, Christopher Lehmann. The 'Mission and Visions' page of the school's website describes the school as, "a partnership high school between the School District of Philadelphia and The Franklin Institute. SLA is an inquiry-driven, project-based high school focused on 21st century learning that opened its doors on September 7, 2006. SLA provides a rigorous, college-preparatory curriculum with a focus on science, technology, mathematics and entrepreneurship. Students at SLA learn in a project-based environment where the core values of inquiry, research, collaboration, presentation, and reflection are emphasized in all classes." &lt;ref&gt;Science Leadership Academy, "[http://scienceleadership.org/pages/Mission_and_Vision Mission and Vision]," Referenced on February 6, 2011. {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wUnreEdY?url=http://scienceleadership.org/pages/Mission_and_Vision |date=February 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spring 2009, SLA was named an Apple Distinguished School, as of 2009 one of only 33 schools in the nation so named.&lt;ref&gt;The Franklin Institute, "[http://www2.fi.edu/press/releases/sla_apple.pdf Science Leadership Academy named "Apple Distinguished School"]," June 2009. Referenced on July 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, SLA was featured in the April 2007 Edutopia Magazine article, "My School, Meet MySpace" where the school is called "... [John] Dewey for the digital age, old-fashioned progressive education with a technological twist."&lt;ref&gt;Edutopia Magazine, "[http://www.edutopia.org/my-school-meet-myspace My School, Meet MySpace]," April 2007. Referenced on July 9, 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wUntSCp8?url=http://www.edutopia.org/my-school-meet-myspace |date=February 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school has received speeches from a number of distinguished individuals over the years, including [[Bill Gates]], Chairman of Microsoft and co-chair of the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], who spoke to the students of SLA on Thursday, April 29, 2010 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.philly.com/inquirer/front_page/20100430_Bill_Gates_visits_Science_Leadership_Academy.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605135651/http://www.philly.com/inquirer/front_page/20100430_Bill_Gates_visits_Science_Leadership_Academy.html |date=June 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Steven Squyres]], lead researcher on the Mars Land-Rover project who first visited the school in 2007 and was SLA's keynote speaker at their first graduation on June 15, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scienceleadership.org/drupaled/blog/clehmann/17-jun-2010/8019  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808021527/http://www.scienceleadership.org/drupaled/blog/clehmann/17-jun-2010/8019 |date=August 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September 2010 issue of Ladies Home Journal, SLA was named one of ten in "America's Most Amazing Schools".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lhj.com/relationships/family/school/most-amazing-schools/?page=10 Ladies Home Journal article]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wUnxv6br?url=http://www.lhj.com/relationships/family/school/most-amazing-schools/?page=10 |date=February 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, Apple.com published a case study of SLA on their Education web page.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apple.com/education/profiles/science-leadership-academy/ Apple.com Case Study] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wUnzedk1?url=http://www.apple.com/education/profiles/science-leadership-academy/ |date=February 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, SLA was featured in the PBS documentary Digital Media: New Learners for the 21st Century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/programs/digital-media/ Digital Media: New Learners for the 21st Century]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Apple.com featured SLA in their video about iBooks and iBooksAuthor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apple.com/education/#video-textbooks]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, President [[Barack Obama]] came to the Franklin Institute. He was there to congratulate the graduating seniors of Science Leadership Academy. The president said, "My expectation is that somebody in this auditorium is going to figure out new sources of energy that help not only make us more energy independent but also deals with the problems like climate change. There is somebody in this room who is going to make sure that we are defeating diseases like Alzheimer's or find a cure for [[cancer]]."
President Obama said that the students' talents would mean a bright future for the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/2012-06-12/news/32195997_1_president-obama-sla-science-museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

==School features==
Each student of SLA, (along with the teachers), receives their own personal laptop, which they are responsible for throughout the school year. The majority of school work is done on the computers through the school's [[Instructure|Canvas]] course-management system. The school also has some of the largest and most extensive lab areas in the entire school district, with four lab classrooms. Two are located on the 2nd floor and the other two on the 3rd. These classrooms are large in space, combining both a usual SLA classroom along with the lab areas, allowing students to conduct experiments on a regular basis opposed to the occasional one as in many other schools. Students do benchmark projects every quarter to demonstrate the application of their learning, with the aid of the five ''core values'' (see below).

==Building==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TheSLApool300pix.jpg|thumb|"The Pool"]] --&gt;The location of the school building was decided upon its proximity to the Franklin Institute, as well as being in the heart of [[Center City, Philadelphia|Downtown Philadelphia]]. The building itself was formerly an office building (for the Human Resources department of the School District of Philadelphia), which was completely renovated for SLA. In total, the building is five stories tall (though the school only uses the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th floors), contains three elevators (reserved for teachers and disabled students only), and three main stairwells, with one that gives access to the 1st-3rd floors, and the other two for the 1st‚Äì5th floors. One interesting feature to the building, dubbed the "Pool" by the students, is a large cutout structure, (with the interior walls painted blue that give it its name), located on the second floor which looks into the 1st-floor caf√©.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:TheSLAcafefullshot.jpg|thumb|The caf√© on the first floor of SLA]]  --&gt;This space was originally planned to be a grand staircase that leads visitors straight from the front door to the office, however, engineering conflicts did not allow for this. Also, two ballrooms, (located in the middle of the 2nd and 3rd floors) were supposed to be staircases that were connected as well, though the same conflicts denied those plans. The lease for these plans ends in 2019. At that point, Science Leadership Academy has plans to renovate and move into [[Benjamin_Franklin_High_School_(Philadelphia)|Benjamin Franklin High School]]'s facility. The building will be renovated to fit the two schools how they see fit. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designshare.com/index.php/articles/science-leadership-academy/ DesignShare: "Designing School 2.0: A Study of Philadelphia's Science Leadership Academy"] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wUo1Syor?url=http://www.designshare.com/index.php/articles/science-leadership-academy/ |date=February 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science Leadership Academy @ Beeber==
{{see also|Dimner Beeber Middle School}}

On September 9, 2013, the school opened a second campus in the Wynnefield area of Philadelphia and graduated its first class in June 2017. [http://www.slabeeber.org SLA@Beeber] originally shared a building with Beeber Middle School.  After delaying a closure decision in 2013, the Philadelphia School Reform Commission recommended in 2015 that Beeber Middle School be phased out over a two year period&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Graham |first1=Kristen |title=Philly superintendent wants more closures, conversions, new schools |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/education/20151002_Philly_superintendent_wants_more_closures__conversions__new_schools.html?arc404=true |website=philly.com |publisher=The Philadelphia Inquirer |accessdate=31 August 2018 |language=English |date=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. SLA@Beeber is now the only occupant of the building, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its significance to educational architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Register of Historic Places Pennsylvania - Philadelphia County |url=https://nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/pa/Philadelphia/state.html |website=nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com |publisher=American Dreams, Inc. |accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In the 2018-2019 school year, the school welcomed its first fifth grade class.  The school's founding principal is Christopher Johnson. They have created many new partnerships with places such as PAFA and St. Joseph's University.

== Science Leadership Academy Middle School ==
On September 7, 2016, the third campus of Science Leadership Academy - Science Leadership Academy Middle School opened in the Powelton Village neighborhood of Philadelphia. The school (SLA-MS) opened with a 5th grade and will grow a grade until it houses a 5th through 8th grade. The founding principal is Timothy Boyle and the school is currently housed in the Dornsife Center on 35th and Spring Garden Sts as part of their partnership with Drexel University. The website for the school is http://www.slamiddle.org. 

==Core values==

The Science Leadership Academy is an understanding-driven, project-based school where the learning is centered around the five core values of '''inquiry''', '''research''', '''collaboration''', '''presentation''' and '''reflection'''.

===Inquiry===
Students ask questions about their topic that will allow them to fully understand it. They also inquire about the things they do not know about said topic.

===Research===
With their resources, students research their topics in depth using credible sources.

===Collaboration===
Students collaborate with classmates and others to continue their spectrum of learning.

===Presentation===
Students convey their thoughts, ideas, and findings through their presentations.

===Reflection===
Students reflect on the work, along with successes and failures and see what they can do to improve on future work.

== History ==
It was founded by the former pupil [[Hauke L√∂ffler]] on 22 July 2004. The first version was running [[PmWiki]]; later the wiki was moved to [[MediaWiki]].
It was mentioned by [[Deutsche Presse Agentur|DPA]] and on German television ([[ZDF]]).

It is hosted by the [[voluntary association]] "Bildungsverein Region Karlsruhe e.V." (e.V. = [[Eingetragener Verein]]).

== Content ==
The Stadtwiki Karlsruhe contains information on all topics that are related to Karlsruhe, it provides detailed information and links to geography, nature, history, politics, religion, education, culture, social affairs, sports, business and transport.

It also provides information on the subject of tourism and leisure destinations, gastronomy guide, clubs and venues, and acts specifically as a calendar of events.

The only relevant criterion is the reference to Karlsruhe.

In October 2008 the Stadtwiki for an English and a French edition was expanded, in September 2009 at a Russian edition.

'''''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''''' is a fictional electronic guide book in the multimedia scifi/comedy series [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|of the same name]] by [[Douglas Adams]]. The Guide serves as "the standard repository for all knowledge and wisdom" for many members of the series' galaxy-spanning civilization. Entries from the guidebook are used as comic narration to bridge events and provide background information in every version of the story. The guide is published by "Megadodo Publications", a publishing company on [[Ursa Minor Beta]].

In the original radio scripts, the Guide's voice was called the "Narrator" and in the 2004‚Äì2005 series, "The Voice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas | editor = Geoffrey Perkins (ed.), additional Material by M. J. Simpson. | title=[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Original Radio Scripts]] | edition=25th Anniversary | publisher=Pan Books | year=2003|ISBN=0-330-41957-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adams, Douglas.|editor = [[Dirk Maggs]], dramatisations and editor. | title=The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Radio Scripts: The Tertiary, Quandary and Quintessential Phases | publisher=Pan Books | year=2005 | ISBN=0-330-43510-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For all of the radio series and the 1981 TV series, the role was credited as "The Book", though this was changed to "Narrator/The Guide" for the 2005 movie.

In the first two phases of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)|the radio series]], the LP album adaptations of the first radio series and in the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|television series]], the Guide was voiced by British actor [[Peter Jones (actor)|Peter Jones]]. During the 2004‚Äì2005 radio series, ''The Guide'' was voiced by [[William Franklyn]]. In [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|the film version]], it was voiced by [[Stephen Fry]]. In the Hexagonal Phase of the radio series, based on the novel, ''[[And Another Thing... (novel)|And Another Thing...]]'', the Guide was voiced by the series co-creator [[John_Lloyd_(writer)|John Lloyd]]. 

==Entries==
The ''Guide'''s numerous entries are quoted throughout the various incarnations of the ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' series. As well as offering background information, the Guide's entries often employ irony, sarcasm and subtle commentary on the action and on life in general. For instance, the entry on the [[Sirius Cybernetics Corporation]] describes their marketing division as "a bunch of mindless jerks who will be the first against the wall when the revolution comes", with a footnote to the effect that the editors would welcome applications from anyone interested in taking over the post of robotics correspondent.&lt;ref&gt;The original Radio Series  Fit the Second&lt;/ref&gt; The entry on the villainous [[Vogon]]s begins, "Here's what to do if you want to get a lift from a Vogon: forget it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas Adams|title=The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: A Trilogy in Four Parts|publisher=Pan|year=1992 |pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entry on "What to do if you find yourself stuck in a crack in the ground underneath a giant boulder you can't move, with no hope of rescue" suggests that first, you "consider how lucky you are that life has been good to you so far. Alternatively, if life hasn't been good to you so far, which given your current circumstances seems more likely, consider how lucky you are that it won't be troubling you much longer."&lt;ref&gt;{{H2G2|radio|7|link=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its advice on drunkenness is simply, "Go to it, and good luck",&lt;ref&gt;Adams p.358&lt;/ref&gt; and according to the 2005 film, its entry on love is "Avoid it at all costs".

The ''Guide'' tends to focus on certain topics. For instance, if looking for information about sex, the ''Guide'' suggests reading "chapters seven, nine, ten, eleven, fourteen, sixteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty-one to eighty-four inclusive, and in fact most of the rest of the ''Guide''."&lt;ref&gt;Adams p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; On the ''Guide'''s outdated and typo-filled entries (some of which could cause serious injury or death, such as "Ravenous Bugblatter Beasts often make a very good meal for visiting tourists," rather than "Ravenous bugblatter beasts often make a very good meal ''of'' visiting tourists.")&lt;ref&gt;Adams p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Adams wrote, "...though it cannot hope to be useful or informative on all matters, it does make the reassuring claim that where it is inaccurate, it is at least ''definitively'' inaccurate. In cases of major discrepancy it was always reality that's got it wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{H2G2|radio|10|link=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editing==
Despite the work of dedicated field researchers such as [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford Prefect]], many of the contributions to the ''Guide'' are made on a strictly ad-hoc basis. With the permanent staff more likely to be on a lunch break than working, "most of the actual work got done by any passing stranger who happened to wander into the empty offices of an afternoon and saw something worth doing."&lt;ref&gt;Adams p. 397&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the ''Guide'' being patchy in its coverage, cobbled together (for example: the entry on "The Universe" was copied from the back of a packet of breakfast cereal)&lt;ref&gt;Adams p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; and often riddled with errors.

Although Ford puts together a lengthy and detailed entry on Earth during the 15 years he is stranded there, the editors cut it down to two words: "Mostly harmless." In ''So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish'', he is stunned to see his entire original work restored during a database update, even though he saw the planet being demolished by the Vogons. The change turns out to be necessary because another Earth has been pulled into existence from a parallel universe by [[dolphins]] in order to prevent humans from becoming extinct.

The ''Guide'' can receive updates to its data base via [[Sub-Etha]]. Field researchers (like Ford Prefect) can also use the Guide to edit entries and transmit these back to the publisher.&lt;ref&gt;Adams p. 478&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publisher==
At the start of the series, the Guide was published by [[Megadodo Publications]], one of the "great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor."&lt;ref&gt;Adams p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; When Megadodo was bought out by [[Infinidim Enterprises]] in ''[[Mostly Harmless]]'', the new editor in chief, [[Minor characters in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Zarniwoop / Vann Harl|Vann Harl]], changed the Guide's demographic from penniless hitchhikers to families in billions of billions of alternate worlds, thus altering the Guide's original purpose. When Ford learned of this plan, he knocked out Vann Harl and stole his Ident-I-Eeze card to increase the spending limit on Ford's own Dine-O-Charge card. Ford was thus able to use his Dine-O-Charge to buy (among other things): a pink spaceship, all the [[foie gras]] in London, and The [[London Zoo]], in addition to buying the hotel he was staying at for the concierge, all charged to the Guide and Infinidim Enterprises.

==Physical description==
The Guide is described as resembling "a small, thin, flexible lap computer" encased in a "sturdy plastic cover" with the words "Don't Panic" inscribed on it "in large, friendly letters".&lt;ref&gt;Adams p. 537&lt;/ref&gt; It is presumably of robust construction, making it able to withstand falling through time/space wormholes and being thrown into swamps, being rescued, and still operating. Arthur Dent's copy survived a spaceship crash which melted the ship into something unrecognizable yet the Guide (and on-board entertainment system) survived. Its entries are arranged alphabetically on the screen and accessed via typing entry codes on a keyboard; "Earth" is on the same page as "[[Eccentrica Gallumbits]], the Triple-Breasted Whore of Eroticon 6."&lt;ref&gt;Adams p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish]]'' the Guide's "current tally" of pages is said to be 5,973,509.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas | title=So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish | publisher=Pocket Books | year=1988 | ISBN=0-671-66493-X | page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film, the Guide is depicted as a large metal book with a large screen instead of pages. Entries here are reached by voice activation (e.g. saying the word "Vogon" will bring up the article on Vogons, etc.)

==Personality==
At the start, the ''Guide'' is merely an information resource, although one with a distinctly flippant and exuberant tone. Its introduction begins with the words, "Space is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean you may think it's a long walk down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space. Listen..."&lt;ref&gt;Adams p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the fifth novel, ''Mostly Harmless'', a new edition of the ''Guide'', the ''Guide'' Mark II,  is published that is artificially intelligent and capable of interacting with the reader. This ''Guide'', which takes the form of a black, birdlike robot, appears pleasant and friendly but is in fact deeply malevolent and in league with the Vogons in a plot to destroy Earth. Strangely enough, it saves all the main characters from certain doom as part of some unknown agenda and disappears from existence shortly before the Grebulons destroy Earth at the beginning of the sixth book in the series, ''And Another Thing'' by [[Eoin Colfer]].

==Representation==
In the original radio series, [[Peter Jones (actor)|Peter Jones]] provided the voice for "The Book" as both the ''Guide'' itself and as the overall narrator. When speaking as the ''Guide'', Jones's voice was electronically filtered to sound mechanical, and spoken against simple electronic music. When speaking merely as the narrator, his voice was left unfiltered. In the television series, Jones's voice was left unfiltered for both the ''Guide'' and "general" narrations, which were accompanied by hand-drawn animations representing computer readouts. These animations often contained little jokes, such as the full text of the "worst poetry in the universe", the equation of 37 Earth miles as "1 Altairian long way", the inclusion of a topping of meringue on a Magrathea-constructed planet, and the outcome of an intergalactic war represented as a video game score. The 2005 film, which featured Stephen Fry as the voice of the ''Guide'', also employed animations, but in a more minimalist, abstract style. They were animated by [[Shynola]].

==Inspiration==
Adams conceived of the ''Guide'' while hitchhiking from London to Istanbul in 1971. Drunk and penniless in a field in [[Innsbruck]], Austria, Adams looked up at the stars and then at his stolen copy of ''[[Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe]]'' and thought that someone should write ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Don't Panic: Douglas Adams and the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy|author=Neil Gaiman|year=1993|publisher=Titan Books|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe'' claimed in its introduction that it was possible to survive in Europe on less than US$25 a week, a claim echoed in the catchphrase of the ''Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' that it was the best source of advice for those who wanted to see the universe "on less than 30 Altairian dollars a day."

==In reality==
Douglas Adams, who was deeply involved with computer technology, founded the website [[h2g2]] in 1999. In keeping with the ''Hitchhiker's Guide'''s tradition of being edited by random people off the street, h2g2 is an encyclopedia edited by thousands of contributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The h2g2 Tour ‚Äì An Introduction to h2g2|year=2000|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/dontpanic-tour|accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The site's creation predates [[Wikipedia]] by two years, though several commentators have noted the similarities between Wikipedia and the ''Hitchhiker's Guide'', particularly its wild variance in reliability and quality and its tendency to focus on topics of interest to its writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikipedia is a real-life Hitchhiker's Guide: huge, nerdy, and imprecise|author=Paul Boutin|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2117942/|work=slate|year=2005|accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Anthology at the End of the Universe: Leading Science Fiction Authors on Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|editor=Glenn Yeffeth|pages=31|publisher=BenBella Books, Inc|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zdnet&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dawson|first1=Christopher|title=Wikipedia is the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/wikipedia-is-the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy/|publisher=ZDNet|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rough Guide to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|isbn=9781848362420|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=6hdBx7oUH-YC&amp;pg=PT96|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 Adams wrote:

{{quote|text=When I originally described The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, over twenty years ago, I was only joking. I didn't see myself as a predictive kind of science fiction writer, like Arthur C. Clarke who more or less single-handedly invented the communications satellite. The Guide was just a narrative device which allowed me to run off at tangents whenever the story seemed to be getting a bit dull.

But it turns out that I, inadvertently, had a terribly good idea. The Guide was compiled by researchers roaming round the galaxy, beaming their copy in, which was then instantly available to anybody to read. Over, believe it or not, something called the SubEthaNet.

Well, more or less.

I really didn't foresee the Internet. But then, neither did the computer industry. Not that that tells us very much of course - the computer industry [[year 2000 problem|didn't even foresee that the century was going to end]].

But I did have the inkling of an idea that a collaborative guide, one that was written and kept up to date by the people who used it, in real time, might be a neat idea. I just didn't really realise that such a thing might be possible in my lifetime or how powerful such a thing might be.

We're gradually beginning to get some tiny, tiny inkling of how powerful a networked community sharing information really could become.|author=Douglas Adams|source=My Vision for h2g2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams |first1=Douglas |title=My Vision for h2g2, by Douglas Adams |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A550955 |accessdate=15 May 2016 |date=4 April 2000 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109020604/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A550955 |archivedate=January 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some have compared [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s [[iPad]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]'s [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] to the ''Hitchhiker's Guide''; indeed fans have designed "Don't Panic" covers for both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple iPad is the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/04/03/853835/-Apple-iPad-is-the-Hitchhikers-Guide-to-the-Galaxy|publisher=Daily Kos|year=2010|accessdate=2011-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reviews.cnet.com/2300-3126_7-10004120.html CNet Reviews: 15 Must Have Ipad cases]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=2501385 Ipad: The closest Thing We've got to a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=xkcd&gt;[http://xkcd.com/548/ xkcd: Kindle]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2009/03/12/first-laser-etched-kindle-2-the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy-dont-panic/ First laser etched Kindle 2!

'''The World's 50 Best Restaurants''' is a list produced by UK media company [[William Reed Business Media]], which originally appeared in the British magazine ''[[Restaurant (magazine)|Restaurant]]'', based on a poll of international [[chef]]s, [[restaurateur]]s, [[gourmand]]s and [[restaurant critic]]s. In addition to the main ranking, the organisation awards a series of special prizes for individuals and restaurants, including the One To Watch award, the Lifetime Achievement Award and the Chefs' Choice Award, the latter based on votes from the fifty head chefs from the restaurants on the previous year's list. Often working as a barometer of global gastronomic trends, the list showcases a variety of cuisines from all over the world&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theworlds50best.com/|title=The World's 50 Best Restaurants|website=The World's 50 Best Restaurants|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The top restaurants have sometimes been forerunners of [[molecular gastronomy]]. Most of the restaurants serve [[haute cuisine]], which is characterized by the meticulous preparation and careful presentation of food.

The first place on the list has been dominated by [[elBulli]] and [[Noma (restaurant)|Noma]]. In 2002 and 2006‚Äì2009, elBulli was determined to be the world's best restaurant, winning more times than any other restaurant.{{r|XSECN}} In 2010, Noma received the first place award. It was maintained in 2011 and again in 2012.{{r|2012 awards}} After defending its title for the third time, chef [[Ren√© Redzepi]] said that 1,204 customers were wait-listed for the evening, compared to 14 customers from two years before.{{r|QdZ8I}} However, in 2013 [[El Celler de Can Roca|El Celler De Can Roca]] took over the first position before Noma regained it in 2014. In 2018, [[Osteria Francescana]] regained the crown it had held in 2016, after dropping to second in 2017, when [[Eleven Madison Park]] topped the poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/worlds-best-restaurants-2018/index.html |title=World's 50 best restaurants for 2018 announced |author=Barry Neild |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The list originated as a one-off stunt by the staff of ''Restaurant'' magazine, who came up with the idea at the [[Shaston Arms]] public house in London's [[Carnaby Street]].{{r|NY}}  It was more successful than they expected and soon became established as a major event in the culinary world.{{r|NY}}

The World's 50 Best Restaurants list is compiled from the votes of the "World‚Äôs 50 Best Restaurants Academy", a group of 26 panels established to make the ranking&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.{{r|JrySP}} The world is divided into regions, with a chairperson in each region appointed for their knowledge of their part of the restaurant world. These chairs each selected a voting panel of 40 members, who every year cast thousands of votes.

There is no list of nominees; each member of the international voting panel votes for their own personal choice of ten restaurants. Up to six votes can be cast for restaurants in the voter's own region, while at least four must go to restaurants outside of the home region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; No voting member is allowed to vote for their own restaurant, or one in which they have an economic interest, and voters must have eaten in the restaurants they nominate within the past 18 months. The integrity of the voting process and the resulting list is adjudicated by global consultancy firm Deloitte.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The criteria are different from those of the ''[[Michelin Guide]]'' or other guides, which has allowed restaurants like [[Momofuku Ssam Bar]], [[Asador Etxebarri]] and [[St. John (restaurant)|St. John]] to hold their own among the [[Molecular gastronomy|molecular]] or [[traditional cuisine]] of restaurants such as [[The Fat Duck]], [[Les Ambassadeurs (restaurant)|Les Ambassadeurs]] or [[The French Laundry]].

The '''Social Movement ‚Äì Tricolour Flame''' ({{lang-it|Movimento Sociale ‚Äì Fiamma Tricolore}}, '''MS-FT'''), commonly known as '''Tricolour Flame''' (''Fiamma Tricolore''), is a [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist]]&lt;ref name="CottaVerzichelli2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maurizio Cotta|author2=Luca Verzichelli|title=Political Institutions in Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-FAZHBDqggC&amp;pg=PA40|accessdate=16 July 2013|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-928470-2|pages=40‚Äì}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of political parties in Italy|political party in Italy]].

==History==
The party was started by the more radical members of the [[Fascism|Fascist]] [[Italian Social Movement]], led by [[Pino Rauti]], who refused to join the mainstream [[conservatism|conservative]] party [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]]. Rauti was later ousted by [[Luca Romagnoli]], who took the leadership.

In the [[European Parliament Election, 2004 (Italy)|2004 European Parliamentary Election]] the party gained enough votes in the Southern constituency to elect Luca Romagnoli to the [[European Parliament]].  The party was then a member of the [[House of Freedoms]] coalition for the [[Italian general elections, 2006|2006 general election]].

In the coming of the [[Italian general election, 2008|2008 general election]], Tricolour Flame formed a joint list called [[The Right‚ÄìTricolour Flame]] with [[The Right (Italy)|The Right]] of [[Francesco Storace]], a splinter group of National Alliance, in support of the candidacy of [[Daniela Santanch√®]] for Prime Minister.

On 8 November 2013, Luca Romagnoli, secretary of Tricolour Flame, together with the secretary of [[The Right (Italy)|The Right]] [[Francesco Storace]], the regent of [[Future and Freedom]] [[Roberto Menia]], the leader of [[I the South]] [[Adriana Poli Bortone]], [[Domenico Nania]] of the association [[New Alliance (Italy)|New Alliance]], [[Oreste Tofani]] of the association ''Nazione Sovrana'', [[Antonio Buonfiglio]] of the association ''Il Popolo della Vita'' and [[Roberto Buonasorte]], editor of the online newspaper ''Il Giornale d'Italia'', founded the [[Movement for National Alliance]], a federation of right movements inspired to [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]].
On 9 December 2013 the Central Committee of Tricolour Flame distrusted Luca Romagnoli, because he joined this initiative without having preventively sought the opinion of the same Committee, and  Attilio Carelli became regent Secretary of the party. After the expulsion Romagnoli founded instead his new political movement, [[Social Right (political party)|Social Right]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.termometropolitico.it/91848_al-via-la-destra-sociale-di-romagnoli.html Al via la Destra sociale di Romagnoli]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 and 14 December 2014, the VII National Congress officially appointed Carelli as Secretary of the party.

For the [[Italian general election, 2018|2018 general election]], it formed the [[Italy for the Italians]] coalition along with the [[New Force (Italy)|New Force]] party.

==Ideology==
Tricolour Flame is the party of the Italian [[far-right politics|far-right]] most closely tied to the legacy of [[Italian Social Republic]] (RSI). The RSI is usually seen by the party as the example of what [[Fascism]] should have been, in particular as an example of true welfare state. As a sign of this legacy, the party, for example, guarantees free membership for ex-RSI military.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiammatricolore.net/fiamma/tesseramento.asp :: Fiamma Tricolore :: Sito ufficiale :: Appuntamenti&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A press release from the Rome section of the party states:
{{cquote|Tricolour Flame is a movement born just to remark its own ideal proximity to the Social Republic and its fighters. A Republic on which side we would surely have fought, if only the fate would have let us born these years. And we should have surely fought to win, because for us the political synthesis originated from the thought of [[Benito Mussolini]] is for us the only political, economical and spiritual system able to bring the freedom and social justice that are today denied to Italians and all other world populations. [...] [We] relaunch our battle for a better tomorrow, embodying the ideals of the Black Shirts of [[Alessandro Pavolini]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiammaroma.info Fiamma Tricolore Roma&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tricolour Flame maintains a fairly strong [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] stance, and it can be thought to be the Italian party closest to [[Third Position|third positionist]] ideology.

Recently Tricolour Flame has been peculiar, among Italian neo-fascist organizations, in actively trying to attract the young masses and renewing its political practices and communication techniques in a more modern, innovative fashion. Political manifests often tend towards attractive, modern graphics and clear-cut, even humorous slogans. Tricolour Flame is also very close to youth far-right organizations and initiatives, of which the most relevant is [[CasaPound]], a [[social center|social centre]] in [[Rome]].

The party is against the regionalism promoted by the [[Lega Nord|Northern League]] for an independent "[[Padania]]", instead favoring a united Italy.

==Membership==
Among the more controversial members of Tricolur Flame are Pietro Puschiavo and Maurizio Boccacci.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050607045606/http://www.fiammatricolore.net/organigramma.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 Puschiavo was a founding member of the Veneto Skinheads Front, a [[White power skinhead|far-right skinhead]] group based in [[Veneto]] and connected to [[Blood and Honour]]. Boccacci is the former leader of the Western Political Movement, a far-right skinhead organization based in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw97-8/italy.html Stephen Roth Institute: Antisemitism And Racism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629110430/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw97-8/italy.html |date=2011-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It guarantees code and data loaded inside to be protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity{{Clarify|reason=|date=November 2018}}.&lt;ref name="oulpita.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://poulpita.com/2014/02/18/trusted-execution-environment-do-you-have-yours/ |title=Trusted Execution Environment, millions of users have one, do you have yours? |website=Poulpita |date=2014-02-18 |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A TEE as an isolated execution environment provides security features such as isolated execution, integrity of applications executing with the TEE, along with confidentiality of their assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmtQtWpfW3w|title=The benefits of Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)|first=|last=Ram Kumar Koppu|date=26 October 2013|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general terms, the TEE offers an execution space that provides a higher level of security{{For whom|date=November 2018}} than a rich mobile operating system open (mobile OS) and more functionality than a 'secure element' (SE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalplatform.org/documents/GlobalPlatform_TEE_White_Paper_Feb2011.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Trusted Execution Environment : Delivering Enhanced Security at a Lower Cost to the Mobile Market |website=Gloobalplatform.org |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industry associations like GlobalPlatform (working to standardize specifications for the TEE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landmobile.co.uk/news/globalplatform-publishes-tee-security-best-practice-guidelines|title=GlobalPlatform publishes TEE Security Best Practice Guidelines |website=Landmobile.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Trusted Computing Group]] (working to align GlobalPlatform TEE specification with its [[Trusted Platform Module]] (TPM) technology for enhanced mobile security&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tpm_mobile_with_trusted_execution_environment_for_comprehensive_mobile_device_security|title=TPM MOBILE with Trusted Execution Environment for Comprehensive Mobile Device Security - Trusted Computing Group|date=1 June 2012|website=Trustedcomputinggroup.org}}
&lt;/ref&gt;) have undertaken work in recent years.

==History==
Open Mobile Terminal Platform (OMTP) first defined TEE in their 'Advanced Trusted Environment:OMTP TR1' standard, defining it as a "set of hardware and software components providing facilities necessary to support Applications" which had to meet the requirements of one of two defined security levels. The first security level, Profile 1, was targeted against only software attacks and whilst Profile 2, was targeted against both software and hardware attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsma.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/omtpadvancedtrustedenvironmentomtptr1v11.pdf |title=Omtp Hardware Requirements And Defragmentation |format=PDF |website=Gsma.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial TEE solutions based on ARM TrustZone technology which conformed to the TR1 standard such as Trusted Foundations, developed by Trusted Logic, were later launched.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140903041544/http://www.trusted-logic.com/IMG/pdf/TRUSTED_LOGIC_TRUSTED_FOUNDATIONS_OMTP_FINAL.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt; This software would become part of the Trustonic joint venture, and the basis of future GlobalPlatform TEE solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121230204123/http://www.trustonic.com/about-us/who-we-are]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tlmobility.com/spip.php?article207 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140827111210/http://tlmobility.com/spip.php?article207 |archivedate=2014-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on the OMTP standards ended in mid 2010 when the group transitioned into the '''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Wholesale Applications Community' (WAC)'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobileeurope.co.uk/Press-Wire/omtp-announces-final-documents-prior-to-transition-into-wholesale-application-community|title=OMTP announces final documents prior to transition into Wholesale Application Community|website=Mobileeurope.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OMTP standards, including those defining a TEE, are hosted by GSMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsma.com/newsroom/gsmadocuments/omtp-documents/|title=OMTP documents|last=|first=|date=May 2012|website=Gsma.com|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010 GlobalPlatform first announced their own standardisation of the TEE, focusing first on the client API (the interface to the TEE within the mobile OS)&lt;ref name="globalplatform.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalplatform.org/mediapressview.asp?id=800|title=GlobalPlatform|website=Globalplatform.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was expanded later to include the TEE internal API,&lt;ref name="globalplatform.org"/&gt; a Remote Administration framework,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalplatform.org/mediapressview.asp?id=1284|title=GlobalPlatform|website=Globalplatform.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a compliance programme and standardised security level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalplatform.org/mediapressview.asp?id=963|title=GlobalPlatform|website=Globalplatform.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
The TEE is an isolated environment that runs in parallel with the operating system, providing security for the rich environment. It is intended to be more secure than the User-facing OS (which GlobalPlatform calls the REE or Rich Execution Environment) and offers a higher level of performance and functionality than a Secure Element (SE), using a hybrid approach that utilizes both hardware and software to protect data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrust.com/a-glance-at-mobile-security-the-trusted-execution-environment/|title=A Glance at Mobile Security: The Trusted Execution Environment - Entrust, Inc.|website=Entrust.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It therefore offers a level of security sufficient for many applications. Trusted applications running in a TEE have access to the full power of a device's main processor and memory, while hardware isolation protects these from user installed apps running in a main operating system. Software and cryptographic isolation inside the TEE protect the trusted applications contained within from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trustonic.com/products-services/trusted-execution-environment|title=Solutions - Trustonic- Securing Smart Devices &amp; Mobile Applications|website=Trustonic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Service providers, [[Mobile network operator|mobile network operators (MNO)]], operating system developers, [[Mobile Application Development|application developers]], device manufacturers, platform providers and silicon vendors are the main stakeholders contributing to the standardization efforts around the TEE.

To prevent simulation of hardware with a user-controlled software 
a hardware root of trust is used. To simulate the hardware in a way enabling it to pass remote authentication an attacker should extract keys from the hardware, which is costly because of used equipment and reverse engineering skills required (focused ion beam, scanning electron microscope, microprobing, decapsulation) or even impossible if the hardware is designed in a way that reverse engineering destroys the keys. In some cases the keys are unique for each piece of hardware, so a key extracted from one chip is useless for another ones.

==Uses==
There are a number of use cases for the TEE. Though not all possible use cases exploit the deprivation of ownership, TEE is usually used exactly for this.

'''Premium Content Protection / [[Digital Rights Management]]'''

'''Note:''' Much TEE literature covers this topic under the definition "premium content protection" which is the preferred nomenclature of many copyright holders. Premium content protection is a specific use case of [[Digital Rights Management|Digital Rights Management (DRM)]], and is [[‡∏ï|controversial]] among some communities. It is widely used by copyrights holders to restrict the ways in which end users can consume content such as 4K high definition films.

The TEE is a suitable environment for protecting digitally encoded information (for example, HD films or audio) on connected devices such as smart phones, tablets and HD televisions. This suitability comes from the ability of the TEE to deprive owner of the device from reading stored secrets, and the fact that there is often a protected hardware path between the TEE and the display and/or subsystems on devices.

The TEE is used to protect the content once it is on the device: while the content is protected during transmission or streaming by the use of encryption, the TEE protects the content once it has been decrypted on the device by ensuring that decrypted content is not exposed to the environment not approved by app developer OR platform vendor.

'''Mobile financial services'''

Mobile Commerce applications such as: mobile wallets, peer-to-peer payments, contactless payments or using a mobile device as a point of sale (POS) terminal) often have well-defined security requirements. TEEs can be used, often in conjunction with [[near field communication]] (NFC), SEs and trusted backend systems to provide the security required to enable financial transactions to take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalplatform.org/documents/GP_Position_Paper_Value_Added_Mobile_Services.pdf |format=PDF |title=A SECURE SOLUTION FOR DEPLOYING VALUE-ADDED MOBILE SERVICES |website=Globalplatform.org |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some scenarios, interaction with the end user is required, and this may require the user to expose sensitive information such as a PIN, password or biometric identifier to the [[mobile operating system|mobile OS]] as a means of authenticating the user. The TEE optionally offers a trusted user interface which can be used to construct user authentication on a mobile device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalplatform.org/TEEevent/media_center_blog_ngarner.asp|title=GlobalPlatform - TEE Conference - 13 October 2016|website=Globalplatform.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Authentication'''

The TEE is well-suited for supporting biometric ID methods (facial recognition, fingerprint sensor and voice authorization), which may be easier to use and harder to steal than PINs and passwords. The authentication process is generally split into three main stages:

* Storing a reference 'template' identifier on the device for comparison with the 'image' extracted in next stage.
* Extracting an 'image' (scanning the fingerprint or capturing a voice sample, for example).
* Using a matching engine to compare the 'image' and the 'template'.

A TEE is a good area within a mobile device to house the matching engine and the associated processing required to authenticate the user. The environment is designed to protect the data and establish a buffer against the non-secure apps located in [[mobile operating system|mobile OS]]. This additional security may help to satisfy the security needs of service providers in addition to keeping the costs low for handset developers.

The [[FIDO Alliance]] is collaborating with [[GlobalPlatform]] to standardize the TEE for natural ID implementations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalplatform.org/TEEevent/media_center_blog_sebastientaveau.asp|title=GlobalPlatform - TEE Conference - 13 October 2016|website=Globalplatform.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enterprise and government'''

The TEE can be used by governments and enterprises to enable the secure handling of confidential information on a mobile device. The TEE offers a level of protection against software attacks generated in the [[mobile operating system|mobile OS]] and assists in the control of access rights. It achieves this by housing sensitive, ‚Äòtrusted‚Äô applications that need to be isolated and protected from the mobile OS and any malicious malware that may be present. Through utilizing the functionality and security levels offered by the TEE, governments and enterprises can be assured that employees using their own devices are doing so in a secure and trusted manner.

'''Secure Modular Programming'''

With the rise of software assets and reuses, [[Modular programming]] is the most productive process to design software architecture, by decoupling the functionalities into small independent modules. As each module contains everything necessary to execute its desired functionality, the TEE allows to organize the complete system featuring a high level of reliability and security, while preventing each module from vulnerabilities of the others.

==Hardware support==

The following embedded hardware technologies can be used to support TEE implementations:

==Standardization==
While there are a number of proprietary systems, [[GlobalPlatform]] is working to standardize the TEE. Standardizing the TEE is helpful for implementers of mobile wallets, NFC payment implementations, premium content protection and bring your own device (BYOD) initiatives.

These following TEE specifications are currently available from the GlobalPlatform website:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalplatform.org/specificationsdevice.asp|title=GlobalPlatform|website=Globalplatform.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://www.globalplatform.org/specificationsdevice.asp TEE Client API Specification v1.0] outlines the communication between applications running in a [[mobile operating system|mobile OS]] and trusted applications residing in the TEE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark |first=Sarah |url=https://www.nfcworld.com/2010/08/11/34274/globalplatform-specification-adds-secure-area-to-mobile-phone-baseband-processors/ |title=GlobalPlatform specification adds secure area to mobile phone baseband processors ‚Ä¢ NFC World |website=Nfcworld.com |date=2010-08-11 |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://www.globalplatform.org/specificationsdevice.asp TEE Systems Architecture v1.0] explains the hardware and software architectures behind the TEE.&lt;ref name="finextra.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/44607/globalplatform-releases-trusted-execution-environment-specs|title=GlobalPlatform releases Trusted Execution Environment specs|date=17 May 2012|website=Finextra Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://www.globalplatform.org/specificationsdevice.asp TEE Internal API Specification v1.0] specifies how to develop trusted applications.&lt;ref name="finextra.com"/&gt;
* [http://www.globalplatform.org/specificationsdevice.asp TEE Secure Element API Specification v1.0] specifies the syntax and semantics of the TEE Secure Element API. It is suitable for software developers implementing trusted applications running inside the TEE which need to expose an externally visible interface to client applications. 
* [http://www.globalplatform.org/specificationsdevice.asp Trusted User Interface API v1.0] specifies how a trusted UI, with preformated interfaces, should facilitate information entry that will be securely provided by the end user and securely controlled by the TEE.
* [http://globalplatform.org/specs-library/?filter-committee=tee Trusted User Interface API Low Level v1.0] specifies a low-level interface to a frame buffer and input events, which the Trusted Application can use to create custom user interfaces.
* [http://www.globalplatform.org/specificationsdevice.asp TEE TUI Extension: Biometrics API v1.0] specifies how a trusted UI should facilitate biometric entry that will be securely provided by the end user and securely controlled by the TEE.
* [http://www.globalplatform.org/specificationsdevice.asp TEE TA Debug Specification v1.0] specifies the GlobalPlatform TEE debug interfaces and protocols.
* [http://www.globalplatform.org/specificationsdevice.asp TEE Management Framework v1.0] specifies the GlobalPlatform Remote Administration Framework, which enables trusted applications on a device to be remotely managed by trusted service providers.

Trustonic was the company to qualify a GlobalPlatform-compliant TEE product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trustonic.com/news/release/trustonic-is-first-to-qualify-a-globalplatform-compliant-tee/en |title=Enterprise &amp;#124; Trustonic- Flexibility As Well As Device Security |publisher=Trustonic |date= |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, a significant number of GlobalPlatform TEE implementations have become available. A list of those which have been formally qualified by GlobalPlatform can be found at,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalplatform.org/complianceproducts.asp|title=GlobalPlatform Qualified Products|publisher=GlobalPlatform}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many other TEE products offer a high level of compatibility with GlobalPlatform standards.

==Security==
The GlobalPlatform TEE [[Protection Profile]] specifies the typical threats the hardware and software of the TEE needs to withstand. It also details the security objectives that are to be met in order to counter these threats and the security functional requirements that a TEE will have to comply with. A security assurance level of EAL2+ has been selected; the focus is on vulnerabilities that are subject to widespread, software-based exploitation.

The [[Common Criteria]] portal has officially listed the GlobalPlatform TEE Protection Profile&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/anssi-profil_PP-2014_01.pdf |format=PDF |title=GlobalPlatform Device Committee : TEE Protection Profile Version 1.2
|website=Commoncriteriaportal.org |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; on its website, under the Trusted Computing category. This important milestone means that industries using TEE technology to deliver services such as premium content and mobile wallets, or enterprises and governments establishing secure mobility solutions, can now formally request that TEE products are certified against this security framework.

GlobalPlatform is committed to ensuring a standardized level of security for embedded applications on secure chip technology. It has developed an open and thoroughly evaluated trusted execution environment (TEE) ecosystem with accredited laboratories and evaluated products. This certification scheme created to certify a TEE product in 3 months has been launched officially in June 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalplatform.org/mediapressview.asp?id=1154|title=GlobalPlatform|website=Globalplatform.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wikicollecting''''' was a wiki-based open-source encyclopedia covering all areas of antiques and collectables. It was built through an international collaboration of collectors and experts, and encouraged users to submit, edit, update and expand articles for future generations of collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20110320/ai_n57113103/?tag=content;col1|publisher=Sunday Mirror|title=FOCUS ON WIKICOLLECTING.ORG}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luxist.com/2011/02/26/the-five-most-expensive-beatles-collectibles/|publisher=Luxist.com|title=The Five Most Expensive Beatles Collectibles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Top Five Most Expensive Beatles Collectibles|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/the-top-five-most-expensive-beatles-collectibles/49852/|publisher=Prefix magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site included information about a wide variety of subjects ranging from [[art]], [[postage stamps]], [[coins]], [[classic cars]], [[wine]] to [[comic books]]. 

Launched in February 2011, the site had amassed over 400,000 articles as of July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikicollecting.org/wiki:about-us |title=About us|publisher=Wikicollecting.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was offline by the end of 2015.

==Pages==

The types of pages include encyclopaedic entries on specific subjects, sales or items, and information on museums, galleries, collectors‚Äô clubs and organizations around the world. 

Articles can include notable sales and price histories. 

Articles can range from an overview of a collecting area (such as trading cards) including the subject‚Äôs history and context, to the current market value of a particular collectible. These articles are written from a point of neutrality.

It also includes comprehensive free listings of antique and collectibles dealers, which allow businesses to submit and maintain their own pages and include contact information and external links to their own websites.

Business and dealer pages are often written in a more subjective style, but the site is informally moderated by a number of volunteer users to maintain its accuracy.

== Criticism ==
The WordReference forums are strongly criticized by many users due to the rules imposed by the administrator and creator of WordReference, Michael Kellog. These rules deny the possibility of eliminating accounts within the site, arguing that: "Most people asking that their posts be deleted are asking it because they have cheated on their homework and don't want to get caught" (point number 5 of its rules).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is it possible to delete an account?|url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:krQtqqy4SgIJ:https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/is-it-possible-to-delete-an-account.116068/+&amp;cd=4&amp;hl=es&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=es&amp;client=opera|accessdate=3 September 2017|work=WordReference Forums|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
