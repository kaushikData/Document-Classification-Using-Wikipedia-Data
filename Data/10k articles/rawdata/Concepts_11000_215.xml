The '''aggregate demand–inflation adjustment model''' builds on the concepts of the [[IS–LM model]] and the [[AD–AS model]]s, essentially in terms of changing interest rates in response to fluctuations in inflation rather than as changes in the money supply in response to changes in the price level.

== The model ==

The AD–IA model is a Keynesian method used to explain economic fluctuations.  Essentially, this model is used to show undergraduate students how shifts in demand or shocks to prices can affect real GDP around potential.  The model assumes that when inflation rises the interest rate rises (monetary policy rule).  It also assumes that when real GDP exceeds potential, there is upward pressure on the inflation rate and vice versa.

The model features a downward-sloping demand curve (AD) and a horizontal inflation adjustment line (IA).  The point where the two lines cross is equal to potential GDP.  A shift in either curve will explain the impact on real GDP and inflation in the short run.

===Assumptions===
The AD–IA model depends on the assumption of the monetary policy rule (MPR). The monetary policy rule is that the federal reserve increases interest rates in response to increase in [[inflation]] and vice versa.

===Shifts in demand===
A shift in demand can occur for the following reasons:
* A change in government spending
* A change in consumption
* A change in taxes
* A change in the monetary rule

''Example'':  Suppose the government were to cut taxes.  This would lead to an increase in expenditures and thus an increase in demand.  The demand curve would therefore shift to the right and real GDP would be growing above potential.  The inflation adjustment line would then shift upward (reflecting an increase in the inflation rate) causing a movement along the new demand curve until real GDP was equal to potential.

== More advanced ==
This model is further advanced in higher levels of undergraduate studies.

[[David Romer]] proposed in 2000 that the LM curve be replaced in the [[IS–LM]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Romer |first=David |year=2000 |title=Keynesian Macroeconomics without the LM Curve |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=149–169 |doi=10.1257/jep.14.2.149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Romer suggested that although the Federal Reserve uses [[open market operation]]s to impact the federal funds rate, they are not targeting [[money supply]], but rather the [[interest rate]].  Therefore, he suggests removing the LM curve and replacing it with the MP curve.

'''ASCII stereograms''' are a form of [[ASCII art]] based on [[stereoscopy|stereogram]]s to produce the [[optical illusion]] of a three-[[dimension]]al [[image]] by crossing the eyes appropriately using a single image or a pair of images next to each other.

To obtain the 3D effect (in Figure 1 for instance), it is necessary for the viewer to diverge their eyes such that two adjacent letters in the same row come together ([[File:Stereogram guide parallel.png|10px]]). To help in focusing, try to make the two capital Os at the top look like three. Ensure that the image of the central dot is stable and in focus. Once this has been done, look down at the rest of the image and the 3D effect should become apparent. If the Os at the bottom of Figure 1 look like three, then the effect is reversed. It is also possible to obtain opposite 3D effects by crossing the eyes rather than diverging them {{Stereogram|cross}}.

&lt;/pre&gt;

Figure 2 demonstrates the effect even more dramatically. Once the 3D image effect has been achieved ([[File:Stereogram guide parallel.png|10px]]), moving the viewer's head away from the screen increases the stereo effect even more. Moving horizontally and vertically a little also produces interesting effects.

Figure 3 shows a '''Single Image Random Text Stereogram''' ('''SIRTS''') based on the same idea as a Single Image Random Dot Stereogram ([[SIRDS]]). The word "Hi" in relief can be seen when the image clicks into place. ([[File:Stereogram guide cross-eyed.png|10px]])

Some people have included stereograms in their "signature" at the end of [[electronic mail]] messages and news articles. Figure 4 is such an example.

Moving animated versions of ASCII stereograms are possible too.

==Text emphasis==
The stereo effect can be used to highlight individual words in a text, as a sort of "secret message". The effect can be disguised when the paragraph is block justified.

Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 are due to David B. Thomas, [[Jonathan Bowen]], Charles Durst and Marty Hewes respectively. These four stereograms appeared on the publicly accessible ''alt.3d'' [[USENET]] [[newsgroup]].  Figure 5 was invented on the spot by a Wikipedian.

{{About|the ancient Indian concept of human life stages|spiritual hermitage|Ashram}}

An '''''Ashrama''''' in [[Hinduism]] is one of four age-based life stages discussed in Indian texts of the ancient and medieval eras.&lt;ref name=patrick&gt;Patrick Olivelle (1993), The Āśrama System: The History and Hermeneutics of a Religious Institution, Oxford University Press, {{oclc|466428084}}, pages 1–29, 84–111&lt;/ref&gt; The four ashramas are: ''[[Brahmacharya]]'' (student), ''[[Grihastha]]'' (householder), ''[[Vanaprastha]]'' (retired) and  ''[[Sannyasa]]'' (renunciate).&lt;ref name=rks/&gt;

The ''Ashrama'' system is one facet of the ''[[Dharma]]'' concept in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=aw2/&gt; It is also a component of the ethical theories in Indian philosophy, where it is combined with four proper goals of human life (''[[Purusartha]]''), for fulfilment, happiness and spiritual liberation.&lt;ref name=aw0/&gt;

==Ashram system==
Under the Ashram system, the human lifespan was divided into four periods.&lt;ref name="Chakkarath, Pradeep (2005), p. 39"&gt;Chakkarath, Pradeep (2005), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rama, p. 467"&gt;Rama, p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of each period was the fulfilment and development of the individual. The classical system, in the ''[[Ashrama Upanishad]]'', the ''[[Vaikhanasa Dharmasutra]]'' and the later ''[[Dharmaśāstra|Dharmashastra]]'', presents these as sequential stages of human life and recommends ages for entry to each stage, while in the original system presented in the early ''[[Dharmasutras]]'' the Ashramas were four alternative available ways of life, neither presented as sequential nor with age recommendations.&lt;ref name=patrick/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Holdrege (2004), Dharma, in The Hindu World (Editors: Sushil Mittal and Gene Thursby), Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-21527-7}}, page 231&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ashrama and Purushartha==
The Ashramas system is one facet of the complex [[Dharma]] concept in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=aw2&gt;Alban Widgery (1930), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2377977 The Principles of Hindu Ethics], International Journal of Ethics, 40(2): 237–239&lt;/ref&gt; It is integrated with the concept of [[Purushartha]], or four proper aims of life in Hindu philosophy, namely, [[Dharma]] (piety, morality, duties), [[Artha]] (wealth, health, means of life), [[Kama]] (love, relationships, emotions) and [[Moksha]] (liberation, freedom, self-realization).&lt;ref name=aw2/&gt; Each of the four Ashramas of life are a form of personal and social environment, each stage with ethical guidelines, duties and responsibilities, for the individual and for the society. Each Ashrama stage places different levels of emphasis on the four proper goals of life, with different stages viewed as steps to the attainment of the ideal in Hindu philosophy, namely [[Moksha]].&lt;ref&gt;Alban Widgery (1930), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2377977 The Principles of Hindu Ethics], International Journal of Ethics, 40(2): 239–240&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither ancient nor medieval texts of India state that any of the first three Ashramas must devote itself solely to a specific goal of life (''Purushartha'').&lt;ref name=paol&gt;Patrick Olivelle (1993), The Āśrama System: The History and Hermeneutics of a Religious Institution, Oxford University Press, {{oclc|466428084}}, pages 216–219&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth stage of ''Sannyasa'' is different, and the overwhelming consensus  in ancient and medieval texts is that ''Sannyasa'' stage of life must entirely be devoted to ''Moksha'' aided by ''Dharma''.&lt;ref name=paol/&gt;

''Dharma'' is held primary for all stages. ''Moksha'' is the ultimate noble goal, recommended for everyone, to be sought at any stage of life. On the other two, the texts are unclear.&lt;ref name=paol/&gt; With the exception of [[Kamasutra]], most texts make no recommendation on the relative preference on Artha or Kama, that an individual must emphasise in what stage of life. The Kamasutra states,&lt;ref name=paol/&gt;

{{Quote|
The life span of a man is one hundred years. Dividing that time, he should attend to three aims of life in such a way that they support, rather than hinder each other. In his youth he should attend to profitable aims ([[artha]]) such as learning, in his prime to pleasure ([[kama]]), and in his old age to [[dharma]] and [[moksha]].|Kamasutra 1.2.1 – 1.2.4|Translated by Patrick Olivelle &lt;ref name=paol/&gt;}}

'''Benchmarking''' is comparing ones business processes and [[performance metric]]s to industry bests and [[best practice]]s from other companies. In [[project management]] benchmarking can also support the selection, planning and delivery of projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Invernizzi|first=Diletta Colette|last2=Locatelli|first2=Giorgio|last3=Brookes|first3=Naomi J.|date=2017-08-01|title=How benchmarking can support the selection, planning and delivery of nuclear decommissioning projects|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149197017301075|journal=Progress in Nuclear Energy|volume=99|pages=155–164|doi=10.1016/j.pnucene.2017.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dimensions typically measured are quality, time and cost. In the process of best practice benchmarking, management identifies the best firms in their industry, or in another industry where similar processes exist, and compares the results and processes of those studied (the "targets") to one's own results and processes. In this way, they learn how well the targets perform and, more importantly, the business processes that explain why these firms are successful. According to National Council on Measurement in Education, benchmark assessments &lt;ref&gt;National Council on Measurement in Education (USA) http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorB {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722194028/http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorB |date=2017-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are short assessments used by teachers at various times throughout the school year to monitor student progress in some area of the school curriculum. These also are known as interim assessments.

Benchmarking is used to measure performance using a specific [[Performance indicator|indicator]] (cost per unit of measure, productivity per unit of measure, cycle time of x per unit of measure or defects per unit of measure) resulting in a metric of performance that is then compared to others.&lt;ref&gt;Fifer, R. M. (1989). [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1696939&amp;show=abstract Cost benchmarking functions in the value chain.] Strategy &amp; Leadership, 17(3), 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also referred to as "best practice benchmarking" or "process benchmarking", this process is used in management which particularly shows VEMR [[strategic management]], in which organizations evaluate various aspects of their processes in relation to best practice companies' processes, usually within a peer group defined for the purposes of comparison. This then allows organizations to develop plans on how to make improvements or adapt specific best practices, usually with the aim of increasing some aspect of performance. Benchmarking may be a one-off event, but is often treated as a continuous process in which organizations continually seek to improve their practices.

== History ==
The term '''benchmark''', originates from the history of guns and ammunition, and with the same aim as for the business term; comparison and improved performance. The introduction of gunpowder arms replaced the bow and arrow from the archer, the soldier who used the bow. The archer now had to adapt to the new situation, and learn to handle the gun. The new weapon left only a mark on the target, where the arrow used to be visible, and with the bow gone, the soldiers title changed to [[marksman]], the man who put the mark. The gun was improved already in the early beginning, with rifling of the barrel, and the rifle was born. With the industrialization of the weapon-industry in the mid-1800's, The mass production of ammunition as a cartridge replaced the manual loading of black-powder and bullet into the gun. Now, with standardized production of both the high-precision rifle, as well as the cartridge, the marksman was now the uncertain variable, and with different qualities and specifications on both rifle as well as ammunition, there was a need for a method of finding the best combination. The rifled weapon was fixed in a bench, making it possible to fire several identical shots at a target to measure the spread. This is benchmarking, as it is still done today, both at the gun-factory, the ammunition-factory, as well as for a lot of sportsmen who look for the best ammunition to bring to competition.  

Benchmarking is most used to measure performance using a specific indicator (cost per unit of measure, productivity per unit of measure, cycle time of x per unit of measure or defects per unit of measure) resulting in a metric of performance that is then compared to others. In 1994, one of the first technical journal named [[Benchmarking (journal)|''Benchmarking: An International Journal'']] was published.

In 2008, a comprehensive survey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalbenchmarking.ipk.fraunhofer.de/fileadmin/user_upload/GBN/PDF/2010_gbn_survey_business_improvement_and_benchmarking_web.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803220401/http://www.globalbenchmarking.ipk.fraunhofer.de/fileadmin/user_upload/GBN/PDF/2010_gbn_survey_business_improvement_and_benchmarking_web.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on benchmarking was commissioned by The Global Benchmarking Network, a network of benchmarking centres representing 22 countries.

# Mission and Vision Statements and Customer (Client) Surveys are the most used (by 77% of organizations) of 20 improvement tools, followed by [[SWOT analysis]] (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) (72%), and Informal Benchmarking (68%). [[Performance Benchmarking]] was used by 49% and Best Practice Benchmarking by 39%.
# The tools that are likely to increase in popularity the most over the next three years are Performance Benchmarking, Informal Benchmarking, SWOT, and Best Practice Benchmarking. Over 60% of organizations that are not currently using these tools indicated they are likely to use them in the next three years. benchmarking mainly depends on SWOT analysis and will also be using in future for almost 4-5 years.

== Procedure ==
There is no single benchmarking process that has been universally adopted. The wide appeal and acceptance of benchmarking has led to the emergence of benchmarking methodologies. One seminal book is Boxwell's ''Benchmarking for Competitive Advantage'' (1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Benchmarking for Competitive Advantage |first=Robert J|last= Boxwell Jr |year=1994 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=Robert J Boxwell Jr, New York |isbn=0-07-006899-2 |pages=225 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first book on benchmarking, written and published by [[Kaiser Associates]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Beating the competition: a practical guide to Benchmarking |year=1988 |publisher=Kaiser Associates |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-1-56365-018-5 |pages=176 |url=http://www.kaiserassociates.com/cs/first_book_on_benchmarking |access-date=2009-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827003927/http://www.kaiserassociates.com/cs/first_book_on_benchmarking |archive-date=2009-08-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a practical guide and offers a seven-step approach. Robert Camp (who wrote one of the earliest books on benchmarking in 1989)&lt;ref&gt;Camp, R. (1989). The search for industry best practices that lead to superior performance. Productivity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; developed a 12-stage approach to benchmarking.

The 12 stage methodology consists of:
# Select subject
# Define the process
# Identify potential partners
# Identify data sources
# Collect data and select all partners
# Determine the gap
# Establish process differences
# Target future performance
# Communicate
# Adjust goal
# Implement
# Review and recalibrate

The following is an example of a typical benchmarking methodology:

* Identify problem areas: Because benchmarking can be applied to any business process or function, a range of research techniques may be required. They include informal conversations with customers, employees, or suppliers; [[qualitative marketing research|exploratory research]] techniques such as [[focus group]]s; or in-depth [[marketing research]], [[Quantitative marketing research|quantitative research]], [[Statistical survey|surveys]], [[questionnaire construction|questionnaires]], re-engineering analysis, process mapping, quality control variance reports, financial ratio analysis, or simply reviewing cycle times or other performance indicators. Before embarking on comparison with other organizations it is essential to know the organization's function and processes; base lining performance provides a point against which improvement effort can be measured.
* Identify other industries that have similar processes: For instance, if one were interested in improving hand-offs in addiction treatment one would identify other fields that also have hand-off challenges. These could include air traffic control, cell phone switching between towers, transfer of patients from surgery to recovery rooms.
* Identify organizations that are leaders in these areas: Look for the very best in any industry and in any country. Consult customers, suppliers, financial analysts, trade associations, and magazines to determine which companies are worthy of study.
* Survey companies for measures and practices: Companies target specific business processes using detailed surveys of measures and practices used to identify business process alternatives and leading companies. Surveys are typically masked to protect confidential data by neutral associations and consultants.
* Visit the "best practice" companies to identify leading edge practices: Companies typically agree to mutually exchange information beneficial to all parties in a benchmarking group and share the results within the group.
* Implement new and improved business practices: Take the leading edge practices and develop implementation plans which include identification of specific opportunities, funding the project and selling the ideas to the organization for the purpose of gaining demonstrated value from the process.

== Costs ==
The three main types of costs in benchmarking are:
* Visit Costs - This includes hotel rooms, travel costs, meals, a token gift, and lost labor time.
* Time Costs - Members of the benchmarking team will be investing time in researching problems, finding exceptional companies to study, visits, and implementation. This will take them away from their regular tasks for part of each day so additional staff might be required.
* Benchmarking Database Costs - Organizations that institutionalize benchmarking into their daily procedures find it is useful to create and maintain a database of best practices and the companies associated with each best practice now.

The cost of benchmarking can substantially be reduced through utilizing the many internet resources that have sprung up over the last few years. These aim to capture benchmarks and best practices from organizations, business sectors and countries to make the benchmarking process much quicker and cheaper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://logisticsbureau.com/what-is-benchmarking-save-supply-chain-costs/ "What is Benchmarking? Save Supply Chain Costs"] Retrieved 2014-3-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical/product benchmarking ==
The technique initially used to compare existing corporate strategies with a view to achieving the best possible performance in new situations (see above), has recently been extended to the comparison of technical products. This process is usually referred to as "technical benchmarking" or "product benchmarking". Its use is well-developed within the automotive industry ("automotive benchmarking"), where it is vital to design products that match precise user expectations, at minimal cost, by applying the best technologies available worldwide. Data is obtained by fully disassembling existing cars and their systems. Such analyses were initially carried out in-house by car makers and their suppliers. However, as these analyses are expensive, they are increasingly being outsourced to companies who specialize in this area. Outsourcing has enabled a drastic decrease in costs for each company (by cost sharing) and the development of efficient tools (standards, software).

== Types ==
Benchmarking can be internal (comparing performance between different groups or teams within an organization) or external (comparing performance with companies in a specific industry or across industries). Within these broader categories, there are three specific types of benchmarking: 1) Process benchmarking, 2) Performance benchmarking and 3) Strategic benchmarking. These can be further detailed as follows:
*Process benchmarking - the initiating firm focuses its observation and investigation of business processes with a goal of identifying and observing the best practices from one or more benchmark firms. Activity analysis will be required where the objective is to benchmark cost and efficiency; increasingly applied to back-office processes where outsourcing may be a consideration. Benchmarking is appropriate in nearly every case where process redesign or improvement is to be undertaking so long as the cost of the study does not exceed the expected benefit.
*Financial benchmarking - performing a financial analysis and comparing the results in an effort to assess your overall competitiveness and productivity.
*Benchmarking from an investor perspective- extending the benchmarking universe to also compare to peer companies that can be considered alternative investment opportunities from the perspective of an investor.
*Benchmarking in the public sector - functions as a tool for improvement and innovation in public administration, where state organizations invest efforts and resources to achieve quality, efficiency and effectiveness of the services they provide.
*Performance benchmarking - allows the initiator firm to assess their competitive position by comparing products and services with those of target firms.
*Product benchmarking - the process of designing new products or upgrades to current ones. This process can sometimes involve reverse engineering which is taking apart competitors products to find strengths and weaknesses.
*Strategic benchmarking - involves observing how others compete. This type is usually not industry specific, meaning it is best to look at other industries.
*Functional benchmarking - a company will focus its benchmarking on a single function to improve the operation of that particular function. Complex functions such as Human Resources, Finance and Accounting and Information and Communication Technology are unlikely to be directly comparable in cost and efficiency terms and may need to be disaggregated into processes to make valid comparison.
*Best-in-class benchmarking - involves studying the leading competitor or the company that best carries out a specific function.
*Operational benchmarking  embraces everything from staffing and productivity to office flow and analysis of procedures performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuesoft.com/news-events/medical-practice-benchmarking.html|title=Benchmarking: How to Make the Best Decisions for Your Practice|work=NueMD}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Energy benchmarking - process of collecting, analysing and relating energy performance data of comparable activities with the purpose of evaluating and comparing performance between or within entities.&lt;ref&gt;prEN16231:2011 Energy Efficiency Benchmarking Methodology, Brussels: CEN, 2011, p5 (Definition 3.2)&lt;/ref&gt;  Entities can include processes, buildings or companies.  Benchmarking may be internal between entities within a single organization, or - subject to confidentiality restrictions - external between competing entities.

== Tools ==
{{further information|List of benchmarking methods and software tools}}
Benchmarking software can be used to organize large and complex amounts of information. Software packages can extend the concept of benchmarking and competitive analysis by allowing individuals to handle such large and complex amounts or strategies. Such tools support different types of benchmarking (see above) and can reduce the above costs significantly.

The emerging technology of benchmarking engines automates the stage of going from data to noteworthy comparative insights, sometimes even expressing the insights in English sentences.

== Metric benchmarking ==
Another approach to making comparisons involves using more aggregative cost or production information to identify strong and weak performing units. The two most common forms of quantitative analysis used in metric benchmarking are data envelope analysis (DEA) and regression analysis. DEA estimates the cost level an efficient firm should be able to achieve in a particular market. In infrastructure regulation, DEA can be used to reward companies/operators whose costs are near the efficient frontier with additional profits. Regression analysis estimates what the average firm should be able to achieve. With regression analysis, firms that performed better than average can be rewarded while firms that performed worse than average can be penalized. Such benchmarking studies are used to create yardstick comparisons, allowing outsiders to evaluate the performance of operators in an industry. Advanced statistical techniques, including [[stochastic frontier analysis]], have been used to identify high and weak performers in industries, including applications to schools, hospitals, water utilities, and electric utilities.&lt;ref name="bokir"&gt;[http://www.regulationbodyofknowledge.org/price-level-regulation/basic-forms-of-regulation/ Body of Knowledge on Infrastructure Regulation] "Incentive Regulation: Basic forms of Regulation"&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest challenges for metric benchmarking is the variety of metric definitions used among companies or divisions. Definitions may change over time within the same organization due to changes in leadership and priorities. The most useful comparisons can be made when metrics definitions are common between compared units and do not change so improvements can be changed

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4150">The '''Black Horse''' was a study concept for a proposed winged [[single-stage to orbit]] [[spaceplane]] that would use [[aerial refueling]] to greatly reduce the size of the spacecraft, to about the size of an [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]. The original concept was proposed in 1993 by [[US Air Force]] Captain Mitchell Burnside Clapp, who was familiar with the Air Force's use of aerial refueling to extend the performance of combat aircraft. The concept was further developed by others, including an even smaller concept developed by [[Robert Zubrin]], '''Black Colt'''. Clapp left the Air Force in 1996 and partnered with Zubrin to form [[Pioneer Rocketplane]], who proposed a slightly larger version known as '''Pathfinder'''. This has since become the [[Pathfinder XL]] concept.

Clapp proposed Black Horse as a solution to the Air Force's ongoing TransAtmospheric Vehicle (TAV) mission. The concept was picked up by the [[Phillips Laboratory]], and over the winter of 1993-94 they carried out a six-week study with WJ Schafer Associates and Conceptual Research Corporation (an aircraft design firm) into what was now known as the Aerial Propellant Transfer (APT) concept. APT was based on using as many off-the-shelf components as possible and considered a wide variety of possible propellants. Wishing to use only non-cryogenic fuels, they favored the use of conventional [[JP-5]] [[jet fuel]] with [[hydrogen peroxide]] as the [[oxidizer]]. Other mixes considered, mostly for comparison purposes, were [[liquid hydrogen]] (LH2) and [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX), [[methane]]/LOX, and [[RP-1]]/LOX. Although the performance of the alternate fuels was higher, they all included at least one cryogenic component and were much less dense. Using peroxide had the additional advantage of cooling the combustion, which allowed the use of conventional JP-5 rather than the more expensive RP-1.{{sfn|Zubrin|Clapp|1995}}

The study demonstrated that Black Horse would outperform any [[VTHL|vertical take-off/horizontal landing]] concept no matter what fuel it used. The study also noted that the speed that the aerial fuel transfer took place was a key input to the overall performance of the system. Black Horse was deliberately designed to use existing [[tanker aircraft]], specifically the KC-135Q and T models, which had fuel tanks completely separate from the aircraft's own fuel system (most models allowed the 135's engines to draw from the tanks). However, performance was slightly increased if the transfer took place in the [[supersonic]] regime at Mach 3.0, and dramatically increased, almost doubled, if it was [[hypersonic]] at Mach 5.5.{{sfn|Zubrin|Clapp|1995}}

The concept was also picked up by Zubrin, who was then working at [[Martin Marietta]], who carried out their own design series from January to May 1994. This developed the smaller Black Colt concept. Clapp and Zubrin later wrote an extensive article on the concepts in the June 1985 edition of [[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|''Analog'']] magazine.{{sfn|Zubrin|Clapp|1995}}

The '''Black Cat Analogy''' is an [[analogy]], accounting for the differences, mainly between [[science]] and [[religion]], but also between others, such as [[philosophy]] and [[metaphysics]].

==Description==
The analogy can be described like this:

*Philosophy is like being in a dark room and looking for a black cat.
*Metaphysics is like being in a dark room and looking for a black cat that isn't there.
*Theology is like being in a dark room and looking for a black cat that isn't there, and shouting "I found it!"
*Science is like being in a dark room looking for a black cat while using a flashlight.

It can also be applied to other bodies of knowledge or learning, for example by [[Ernest Gellner]] to [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name=doniger/&gt;

==Explanation==
Vincent Barry explains the difference between philosophy and [[theology]] as lying in the fact that philosophy is scientific and open-minded, concerned with proof, while theologians "have found their final truth" before they begin the search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barry|first=Vincent|title=Bioethics in a Cultural Context|date=2011|publisher=Cengage|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ie0XO1aKVSsC&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;ots=yWfum64HEM&amp;dq=Philosophy%20is%20like%20being%20in%20a%20dark%20room%20and%20looking%20for%20a%20black%20cat.&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q=Philosophy%20is%20like%20being%20in%20a%20dark%20room%20and%20looking%20for%20a%20black%20cat.&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Many variations on the analogy exist, and they have been variously attributed to several famous figures at different times (e.g. [https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin#Misquoted misquotations of Charles Darwin]), but the quotation has been around since at least the 1890s.&lt;ref name="Quote Investigator 15 February 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= A Blind Man in a Dark Room Looking for a Black Cat That Is Not There |url= http://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/02/15/hidden-cat/ | first= Garson| last= O’Toole| date= 15 February 2015| website= Quote Investigator | accessdate= 4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its absolute origin is unknown.&lt;ref name="Quote Investigator 19 February 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= The Philosopher, the Theologian, and the Elusive Black Cat|url= http://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/02/19/philo-cat/| first= Garson| last= O’Toole| date= 19 February 2015| website= Quote Investigator | accessdate= 4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentators===
[[Wendy Doniger]] relates it to a French and English [[proverb]]: "In the dark, all cats are grey." [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] criticised naive ideas of the Absolute, which he ridiculed as "like a night, as people say, in which all cows are black." [[Dashiell Hammett]] in ''[[The Dain Curse]]'' (1929) referred to a "blind man in a dark room hunting for a black hat that wasn't there". [[Ernest Gellner]] referred to an [[East European]] joke about science, philosophy, and [[Marxism]] as looking for a cat in a dark room with various consequences: with science the cat is present, with philosophy absent, and with Marxism absent but found.&lt;ref name=doniger&gt;{{cite book|last=Doniger|first=Wendy|title=The Implied Spider|date=2011|publisher=Columbia University Press|pages=31–33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=76Oh3p2vpe4C&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;ots=Ut0qmJjwux&amp;dq=Philosophy%20is%20like%20being%20in%20a%20dark%20room%20and%20looking%20for%20a%20black%20cat.&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q=Philosophy%20is%20like%20being%20in%20a%20dark%20room%20and%20looking%20for%20a%20black%20cat.&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Butterfly-FFT.png|thumb|200px|right|[[Signal-flow graph]] connecting the inputs ''x'' (left) to the outputs ''y'' that depend on them (right) for a "butterfly" step of a radix-2 Cooley–Tukey FFT.  This diagram resembles a [[butterfly]] (as in the [[Morpho (butterfly)|morpho butterfly]] shown for comparison), hence the name, although in some countries it is also called the hourglass diagram.]] In the context of [[fast Fourier transform]] algorithms, a '''butterfly''' is a portion of the computation that combines the results of smaller [[discrete Fourier transform]]s (DFTs) into a larger DFT, or vice versa (breaking a larger DFT up into subtransforms).  The name "butterfly" comes from the shape of the data-flow diagram in the radix-2 case, as described below.&lt;ref name=Oppenheim89&gt;Alan V. Oppenheim, Ronald W. Schafer, and John R. Buck, ''Discrete-Time Signal Processing'', 2nd edition (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest occurrence in print of the term is thought to be in a 1969 [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] technical report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author=C. J. Weinstein |date=1969-11-21 |title=Quantization Effects in Digital Filters |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=AD0706862 |publisher=[[MIT Lincoln Laboratory]] |page=42 |accessdate=2015-02-10 |quote=This computation, referred to as a 'butterfly' }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathoverflow.net/a/98804 |title=FFT and Butterfly Diagram|last= Cipra  |first= Barry A.  |author-link = Barry A. Cipra|date=2012-06-04 |website=mathoverflow.net |access-date=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same structure can also be found in the [[Viterbi algorithm]], used for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states.

Most commonly, the term "butterfly" appears in the context of the [[Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm]], which [[recursion|recursively]] breaks down a DFT of [[composite number|composite]] size ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''rm'' into ''r'' smaller transforms of size ''m'' where ''r'' is the "radix" of the transform.  These smaller DFTs are then combined via size-''r'' butterflies, which themselves are DFTs of size ''r'' (performed ''m'' times on corresponding outputs of the sub-transforms) pre-multiplied by [[root of unity|roots of unity]] (known as [[twiddle factor]]s).  (This is the "decimation in time" case; one can also perform the steps in reverse, known as "decimation in frequency", where the butterflies come first and are post-multiplied by twiddle factors.  See also the [[Cooley–Tukey FFT]] article.)

==Radix-2 butterfly diagram==
In the case of the radix-2 Cooley–Tukey algorithm, the butterfly is simply a DFT of size-2 that takes two inputs (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) (corresponding outputs of the two sub-transforms) and gives two outputs (''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) by the formula (not including [[twiddle factor]]s):

:&lt;math&gt;y_0 = x_0 + x_1 \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_1 = x_0 - x_1. \, &lt;/math&gt;

If one draws the data-flow diagram for this pair of operations, the (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) to (''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) lines cross and resemble the wings of a [[butterfly]], hence the name (see also the illustration at right).

[[Image:DIT-FFT-butterfly.png|thumb|300px|right|A decimation-in-time radix-2 FFT breaks a length-''N'' DFT into two length-''N''/2 DFTs followed by a combining stage consisting of many butterfly operations.]]
More specifically, a radix-2 decimation-in-time FFT algorithm on ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; inputs with respect to a primitive ''n''-th root of unity &lt;math&gt;\omega^k_n = e^{-\frac{2\pi i k}{n}}&lt;/math&gt; relies on O(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') butterflies of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;y_0 = x_0 + x_1 \omega^k_n \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_1 = x_0 - x_1 \omega^k_n, \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' is an integer depending on the part of the transform being computed. Whereas the corresponding inverse transform can mathematically be performed by replacing ''&amp;omega;'' with ''&amp;omega;''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; (and possibly multiplying by an overall scale factor, depending on the normalization convention), one may also directly invert the butterflies:

:&lt;math&gt;x_0 = \frac{1}{2} (y_0 + y_1) \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_1 = \frac{\omega^{-k}_n}{2} (y_0 - y_1), \, &lt;/math&gt;

corresponding to a decimation-in-frequency FFT algorithm.

==Other uses==
The butterfly can also be used to improve the randomness of large arrays of partially random numbers, by bringing every 32 or 64 bit word into causal contact with every other word through a desired hashing algorithm, so that a change in any one bit has the possibility of changing all the bits in the large array.&lt;ref&gt;*{{Citation | last1=Press | first1=WH | last2=Teukolsky | first2=SA | last3=Vetterling | first3=WT | last4=Flannery | first4=BP | year=2007 | title=Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing | edition=3rd | publisher=Cambridge University Press |  publication-place=New York | isbn=978-0-521-88068-8 | chapter=Section 7.2 Completely Hashing a Large Array | chapter-url=http://apps.nrbook.com/empanel/index.html#pg=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2361">'''Conceptual architecture''' is a form of architecture that utilizes [[conceptualism]], characterized by an introduction of ideas or concepts from outside of architecture often as a means of expanding the discipline of architecture. This produces an essentially different kind of building than one produced by the widely held 'architect as a master-builder' model, in which craft and construction are the guiding principles. The finished building as product is less important in conceptual architecture, than the ideas guiding them, ideas represented primarily by texts, diagrams, or art installations. Architects that work in this vein are [[Diller and Scofidio|Diller + Scofidio]], [[Bernard Tschumi]], [[Peter Eisenman]] and [[Rem Koolhaas]].

Conceptual architecture was studied in the essay, ''Notes on Conceptual Architecture: Towards a Definition'' by [[Peter Eisenman]] in 1970, and again by the Harvard Design Magazine in Fall of 2003 and Winter 2004, by a series of articles under the heading ''Architecture as Conceptual Art''. But the understanding of design as a construction of a concept was understood by many [[modern architecture|modernist architects]] as well. To quote [[Louis Kahn]] on [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]:

:''It doesn't work, it doesn't have to work. Wright had the shape conceived long before he knew what was going into it. I claim that is where architecture starts, with the concept.''&lt;ref&gt;
Louis Kahn quote from Frampton, Kenneth. ''Modern Architecture, a critical history.'' page 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''domestic pig''' (''Sus scrofa domesticus'' or only ''Sus domesticus''), often called '''swine''', '''hog''', or simply '''pig''' when there is no need to distinguish it from other [[pig]]s, is a [[Domestication|domesticated]] large, [[even-toed ungulate]]. It is variously considered a [[subspecies]] of the [[wild boar]] or a distinct [[species]]. The domestic pig's head-plus-body-length ranges from {{convert|0.9|to|1.8|m|in|abbr=on}}, and the adult can weigh between {{convert|26|and|350|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The size and weight of a hog largely depends on its breed. Compared to other [[artiodactyl]]s, its head is relatively long, pointed, and free of warts. Even-toed ungulates are generally [[herbivore|herbivorous]], but the domestic pig is an [[omnivore]], like its wild relative.

When used as [[livestock]], domestic pigs are [[Pig farming|farmed]] primarily for the consumption of their flesh, called [[pork]]. The animal's bones, hide, and [[bristles]] are also used in commercial products. Domestic pigs, especially [[Miniature pig|miniature]] breeds, are kept as pets.

==Biology==
[[File:Domestic pig skull.jpeg|thumb|Domestic pig skull]][[File:Suíno alta.jpg|thumb|right|Skeleton specimen of a swine]]
[[File:Pig hand skeleton.jpg|thumb|left|Bones of a domestic pig’s foot]]
The domestic pig typically has a large head, with a long snout which is strengthened by a special prenasal bone and a disk of [[cartilage]] at the tip.&lt;ref name="ADW Sus scrofa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Sus_scrofa.html|title=Sus scrofa (wild boar)|website=Animal Diversity Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; The snout is used to dig into the soil to find food, and is a very acute sense organ. The [[dental formula]] of adult pigs is {{DentalFormula|upper=3.1.4.3|lower=3.1.4.3}}, giving a total of 44 [[tooth|teeth]]. The rear teeth are adapted for crushing. In the male the canine teeth can form [[tusk]]s, which grow continuously and are sharpened by constantly being ground against each other.&lt;ref name="ADW Sus scrofa"/&gt;

==Taxonomy==
The domestic pig is most often considered to be a [[subspecies]] of the [[wild boar]], which was given the name ''Sus scrofa'' by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758; following from this, the formal name of the domestic pig is ''Sus scrofa domesticus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?name=Sus+scrofa+domestica|title=Taxonomy Browser|website=ncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gentry"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Anthea Gentry |author2=Juliet Clutton-Brock |author3=Colin P.

[[DNA]] evidence from subfossil remains of teeth and jawbones of Neolithic pigs shows that the first domestic pigs in Europe had been brought from the Near East. This stimulated the domestication of local European wild boar, resulting in a third domestication event with the Near Eastern genes dying out in European pig stock. Modern domesticated pigs have involved complex exchanges, with European domesticated lines being exported, in turn, to the ancient Near East.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6978203.stm BBC News, "Pig DNA reveals farming history"] 4 September 2007.

In August 2015, a study looked at over 100 pig genome sequences to ascertain their process of domestication, which was assumed to have been initiated by humans, involved few individuals, and relied on reproductive isolation between wild and domestic forms. The study found that the assumption of reproductive isolation with population bottlenecks was not supported. The study indicated that pigs were domesticated separately in Western Asia and China, with Western Asian pigs introduced into Europe, where they crossed with wild boar. A model that fitted the data included a mixture with a now extinct [[ghost population]] of wild pigs during the [[Pleistocene]]. The study also found that despite back-crossing with wild pigs, the genomes of domestic pigs have strong signatures of selection at DNA loci that affect behavior and morphology. The study concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars and created [[domestication islands]] in the genome. The same process may also apply to other domesticated animals.&lt;ref name=frantz2015&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frantz, L|year=2015|title=Evidence of long-term gene flow and selection during domestication from analyses of Eurasian wild and domestic pig genomes|doi=10.1038/ng.3394|pmid=26323058|volume=47|issue=10|journal=Nat.

The adaptable nature and [[omnivorous]] diet of the wild boar allowed early humans to domesticate it readily. Pigs were mostly used for food, but early civilizations also used the pigs' hides for shields, bones for tools and weapons, and bristles for brushes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flossybrush.ca/oral.html Oral Care.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070916014320/http://www.flossybrush.ca/oral.html |date=16 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, pigs have been domesticated for a long time, mostly in [[Goa]] and some [[rural area]]s, for [[pig toilet]]s.

Among the animals that the Spanish [[Columbian Exchange|introduced]] to the [[Chiloé Archipelago]] in the 16th century, pigs were the most successful to adapt.

== Reproduction ==
Female pigs reach sexual maturity at 3–12 months of age, and come into [[Estrous cycle|estrus]] every 18–24 days if they are not successfully bred. The gestation period averages 112–120 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.extension.org/pages/63668/feral-hog-reproductive-biology|title=Feral Hog Reproductive Biology|date=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estrus lasts two to three days, and the female's displayed receptiveness to mate is known as standing heat. Standing heat is a reflexive response that is stimulated when the female is in contact with the saliva of a sexually mature boar.

They typically live in groups of about 8-10 adult sows, some young individuals, and some single males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Algers|first=Bo|last2=Uvnäs-Moberg|first2=Kerstin|date=1 June 2007|title=Maternal behavior in pigs|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0018506X07000682|journal=Hormones and Behavior|series=Reproductive Behavior in Farm and Laboratory Animals11th Annual Meeting of the Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology|volume=52|issue=1|pages=78–85|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2007.03.022|pmid=17482189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their relative lack of sweat glands, pigs often control their body temperature using behavioural thermoregulation. [[Wallowing]], which often consists of coating the body with mud, is a behaviour frequently exhibited by pigs.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bracke|first=M.B.M|year=2011|title=Review of wallowing in pigs: description of the behaviour and its motivational basis|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159111000219|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=132|pages=1–13|via=Science Direct|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2011.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do not submerge completely under the mud, but vary the depth and duration of wallowing depending on environmental conditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Typically, adult pigs start wallowing once the ambient temperature is around 17-21&amp;nbsp;°C. They cover themselves from head to toe in mud.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Pigs may use mud as a sunscreen, or as a method of keeping parasites away.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Most [[bristle]]d pigs will "blow their coat", meaning that they shed most of the longer, more-coarse stiff hair once a year, usually in [[Spring (season)|Spring]] or early [[Summer]], to prepare for the warmer months ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanminipigassociation.com/educational/blowing-coat-mini-pig-shedding|title=Blowing Coat - Mini Pig Shedding FAQ|website=americanminipigassociation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If conditions permit, domestic pigs feed continuously for many hours and then sleep for many hours, in contrast to [[ruminants]] which tend to feed for a short time and then sleep for a short time. Pigs are [[omnivore|omnivorous]], and are highly versatile in their feeding behaviour. As they are foraging animals, they primarily eat leaves, stems, roots, fruits, and flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kongsted|first=A. G.|last2=Horsted|first2=K.|last3=Hermansen|first3=J.

=== Rooting ===
[[File:JulianaPigletPlaytimeCropped&amp;Resized.gif|thumb|Juliana piglet rooting on its sibling’s belly]]
Rooting is an instinctual behavior in pigs that is characterized by a pig nudging its snout into something. Similar to a [[Kneading (cats)|cat’s kneading]], rooting is found comforting, first happens when they are born in order to obtain their mother’s [[milk]], and can become a habitual, obsessive behavior which is most prominent in animals [[Weaning|weaned]] too early.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanminipigassociation.com/educational/rooting-behaviors-in-mini-pigs|title=Rooting &amp; Nudging Behaviors in Mini Pigs|website=americanminipigassociation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, pigs will root and dig into the ground to forage for food.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Rooting is known to also be used as a means of communication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A pig may be chosen to have a [[nose ring (animals)#Pig nose rings|nose ring]] pierced through its septum, as this discourages rooting as it is painful to the pig. Piercing through the rim of the nose is even more painful, as in this area, there are many more [[free nerve ending]]s.

The breed known as the [[kunekune]] hardly ever roots, as it sustains itself feeding on nothing more but grass leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tractorsupply.com/out-here_articles_livestock_kunekune-pigs|title=Kunekune pigs are just right for farm life|website=tractorsupply.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not having to root around in the soil to find underground food (e.g. tubers), it thus has evolved to, for the most part, not possess these instincts.

===Nest-building===
A behavioural characteristic of domestic pigs which they share with carnivores is [[nest-building]]. Sows root in the ground to create depressions and then build nests in which to give birth. First, the sow digs a depression about the size of her body. She then collects twigs, grasses and leaves, and carries these in her mouth to the depression, building them into a mound. She distributes the softer, finer material to the centre of the mound using her feet. When the mound reaches the desired height, she places large branches, up to 2 metres in length, on the surface. She enters into the mound and roots around to create a depression within the gathered material. She then gives birth in a lying position, which, again, is different from other artiodactyls, which usually give birth in a standing position.&lt;ref name="CluttonBrock, (1987)" /&gt;

Nest-building behaviour is an important part in the process of pre and post-partum maternal behaviour. Nest-building will occur during the last 24 hours before the onset of farrowing, and becomes most intense during 12 to 6 hours before farrowing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Algers|first=Bo|last2=Uvnäs-Moberg|first2=Kerstin|date=1 June 2007|title=Maternal behavior in pigs|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=52|issue=1|pages=78–85|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2007.03.022|issn=0018-506X|pmid=17482189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nest-building is divided into two phases: one of which is the initial phase of rooting in ground while the second phase is the collecting, carrying and arranging of the nest material.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The sow will separate from the group and seek a suitable nest site with some shelter from rain and wind that has well-drained soil. This nest-building behaviour is performed to provide the offspring with shelter, comfort, and thermoregulation. The nest will provide protection against weather and predators, while keeping the piglets close to the sow and away from the rest of the herd. This ensures they do not get trampled on and that other piglets are not stealing milk from the sow.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Wischner D., Kemper N., and Krieter J. 2009. "Nest-building behaviour in sows and consequences for pig husbandry". ''Livestock Science.'' 124(1): 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Nest-building can be influenced by internal and external stimuli. Internal hormonal changes and the completion of one nesting phase are indicators of this maternal behaviour.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The onset is triggered by the rise in prolactin levels, which is caused by a decrease in progesterone and an increase in prostaglandin, while the gathering of the nest material seems to be regulated more by external stimuli such as temperature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The longer time spent on nest-building will increase pre-partum oxytocin.

===Nursing and suckling behaviour===
[[File:PigCochon allaitant.jpg|thumb|right|A sow with suckling piglets]] 
Compared to most other mammals, pigs display complex nursing and suckling behaviour.&lt;ref name="Fraser, (1980)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fraser | first1 = D | year = 1980 | title = A review of the behavioural mechanisms of milk ejection of the domestic pig | url = | journal = Applied Animal Ethology | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 247–256 | doi=10.1016/0304-3762(80)90026-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nursing occurs every 50–60 minutes, and the sow requires stimulation from piglets before milk let-down. Sensory inputs (vocalisation, odours from mammary and birth fluids and hair patterns of the sow) are particularly important immediately post-birth to facilitate teat location by the piglets.&lt;ref name="Rohde Parfet and Gonyou, (1991)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rohde Parfet | first1 = K.A. | last2 = Gonyou | first2 = H.W. | year = 1991 | title = Attraction of newborn piglets to auditory, visual, olfactory and tactile stimuli | url = | journal = Journal of Animal Science | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 125–133 | doi=10.2527/1991.691125x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, the piglets compete for position at the udder, then each piglet massages around its respective teat with its snout, during which time the sow grunts at slow, regular intervals. Each series of grunts varies in frequency, tone and magnitude, indicating the stages of nursing to the piglets.&lt;ref name="Algers, (1993)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Algers | first1 = B | year = 1993 | title = Nursing in pigs: communicating needs and distributing resources | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/14973674 | journal = Journal of Animal Science | volume = 71 | issue = 10| pages = 2826–2831 | doi=10.2527/1993.71102826x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phase of competition for teats and of nosing the udder lasts for about one minute, and ends when milk flow begins. In the third phase, the piglets hold the teats in their mouths and suck with slow mouth movements (one per second), and the rate of the sow’s grunting increases for approximately 20 seconds. The grunt peak in the third phase of suckling does not coincide with milk ejection, but rather the release of oxytocin from the pituitary into the bloodstream.&lt;ref name="Castren et al., (1989)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Castren | first1 = H. | last2 = Algers | first2 = B. | last3 = Jensen | first3 = P. | last4 = Saloniemi | first4 = H. | year = 1989 | title = Suckling behaviour and milk consumption in newborn piglets as a response to sow grunting | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 227–238 | doi=10.1016/0168-1591(89)90069-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phase four coincides with the period of main milk flow (10–20 seconds) when the piglets suddenly withdraw slightly from the udder and start sucking with rapid mouth movements of about three per second. The sow grunts rapidly, lower in tone and often in quick runs of three or four, during this phase. Finally, the flow stops and so does the grunting of the sow. The piglets may then dart from teat to teat and recommence suckling with slow movements, or nosing the udder. Piglets massage and suckle the sow’s teats after milk flow ceases as a way of letting the sow know their nutritional status. This helps her to regulate the amount of milk released from that teat in future sucklings. The more intense the post-feed massaging of a teat, the greater the future milk release from that teat will be.&lt;ref name="Jensen et al., (1998)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jensen | first1 = P. | last2 = Gustafsson | first2 = G. | last3 = Augustsson | first3 = H. | year = 1998 | title = Massaging after milk ejection in domestic pigs - an example of honest begging? | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 779–786 | doi=10.1006/anbe.1997.0651| pmid = 9632466 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teat order===
In pigs, [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]] hierarchies can be formed at a very early age. Domestic piglets are highly [[wiktionary:precocious|precocious]] and within minutes of being born, or sometimes seconds, will attempt to suckle. The piglets are born with sharp teeth and fight to develop a teat order as the [[anterior]] teats produce a greater quantity of milk. Once established, this teat order remains stable with each piglet tending to feed from a particular teat or group of teats.&lt;ref name="CluttonBrock, (1987)"/&gt;  Stimulation of the anterior teats appears to be important in causing milk letdown,&lt;ref name="Fraser, (1973)"&gt;Fraser, D., (1973). The nursing and suckling behaviour in pigs. I. The importance of stimulation of the anterior teats. British Veterinary Journal, 129: 324-336&lt;/ref&gt; so it might be advantageous to the entire litter to have these teats occupied by healthy piglets.
Using an artificial sow to rear groups of piglets, recognition of a teat in a particular area of the udder depended initially on visual orientation by means of reference points on the udder to find the area, and then the olfactory sense for the more accurate search within that area.&lt;ref name="Jeppesen, (1982)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jeppesen | first1 = L.E. | year = 1982 | title = Teat-order in groups of piglets reared on an artificial sow.

===Senses===
Pigs have [[Panorama|panoramic]] vision of approximately 310° and [[binocular vision]] of 35° to 50°. It is thought they have no [[Accommodation (eye)|eye accommodation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animalbehaviour.net/JudithKBlackshaw/Chapter3e.htm|title=Animalbehaviour.net (Pigs)|accessdate=9 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317194223/http://animalbehaviour.net/JudithKBlackshaw/Chapter3e.htm|archivedate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other animals that have no accommodation, e.g. sheep, lift their heads to see distant objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animalbehaviour.net/JudithKBlackshaw/Chapter3b.htm|title=Animalbehaviour.net (Sheep)|accessdate=9 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226191014/http://animalbehaviour.net/JudithKBlackshaw/Chapter3b.htm|archivedate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The extent to which pigs have colour vision is still a source of some debate; however, the presence of [[cone cell]]s in the retina with two distinct wavelength sensitivities (blue and green) suggests that at least some colour vision is present.&lt;ref name="Lomas et al., 1998)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lomas | first1 = C.A. | last2 = Piggins | first2 = D. | last3 = Phillips | first3 = C.J.C. | year = 1998 | title = Visual awareness | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 57 | issue = 3–4| pages = 247–257 | doi=10.1016/s0168-1591(98)00100-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pigs have a well-developed sense of smell, and use is made of this in [[Europe]] where they are trained to locate underground [[truffles]]. Olfactory rather than visual stimuli are used in the identification of other pigs.&lt;ref name="Houpt, (1998)"&gt;Houpt, K.A., (1998).

In "Social Behaviour in Farm Animals", eds. Keeling, L.J. and Gonyou, H.W. CABI, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alarm or aversive stimuli are transmitted to other pigs not only by auditory cues but also by [[pheromone]]s.&lt;ref name="Vieuille-Thomas and Signoret, (1992)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vieuille-Thomas | first1 = C. | last2 = Signoret | first2 = J.P. | year = 1992 | title = Pheromonal transmission of an aversive experience in domestic pigs | url = | journal = Journal of Chemical Ecology | volume = 18 | issue = 9| pages = 1551–1557 | doi=10.1007/bf00993228| pmid = 24254286 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, recognition between the sow and her piglets is by olfactory and vocal cues.&lt;ref name="Jensen and Redbo, (1987)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jensen | first1 = P. | last2 = Redbo | first2 = I. | year = 1987 | title = Behaviour during nest leaving in free ranging domestic pigs | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 18 | issue = 3–4| pages = 355–362 | doi=10.1016/0168-1591(87)90229-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breeds==
{{Main|List of pig breeds}}

Many [[breed]]s of domestic pig exist; in many colors, shapes, and sizes. According to [[The Livestock Conservancy]], as of 2016, three breeds of domestic pig are critically rare (having a global population of fewer than 2000). They are the [[Choctaw hog]], the [[Mulefoot]], and the [[Ossabaw Island pig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://livestockconservancy.org/index.php/heritage/internal/conservation-priority-list#Pigs|title=The Livestock Conservancy|last=|first=|date=|website=livestockconservancy.org|language=en|access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The known smallest domestic pig breed in the world is the [[Göttingen minipig]], typically weighing about {{convert|26|kg|lb}} as a healthy, full-grown adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://minipigs.dk/fileadmin/filer/pdf/Taking_good_care_of_Ellegaard_Goettingen_Minipigs_13.03.13.pdf |title=Taking good care of Ellegaard Göttingen Minipigs® |website=Ellegaard Göttingen Minipigs |access-date=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Show_Pig_(18097041013).jpg|thumb|A [[Large White pig|Large White]], a breed commonly used in meat production]]
When in use as [[livestock]], the domestic pig is mostly farmed for its meat, [[pork]]. Other food products made from pigs include pork [[sausage]] (which includes [[casing (sausage)|casing]]s that are made from the [[intestine]]s), [[bacon]], [[Gammon (meat)|gammon]], [[ham]] and [[pork rinds]]. The head of a pig can be used to make a preserved jelly called [[head cheese]], which is sometimes known as brawn. [[Liver (food)|Liver]], [[chitterlings]], [[blood (food)|blood]] (for [[black pudding]]), and other [[offal]] from pigs are also widely used for food. In some [[religion]]s, such as [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]], pork is a [[Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork|taboo food]].

The use of [[pig milk]] for human consumption does take place, but as there are certain difficulties in obtaining it, there is little commercial production.

Livestock pigs are exhibited at [[agricultural show]]s, judged either as [[Stud (animal)|stud stock]] compared to the standard features of each pig breed, or in commercial classes where the animals are judged primarily on their suitability for slaughter to provide premium meat.

The [[Leather|skin of pigs]] is used to produce seat covers, apparel, [[pork rinds]], and other items.

In some [[developing nation|developing]] and [[developed nation]]s, the domestic pig is usually raised outdoors in yards or fields. In some areas, pigs are allowed to [[foraging|forage]] in woods where they may be taken care of by [[swineherd]]s. In [[industrialization|industrialized]] nations such as the United States, domestic pig farming has switched from the [[Sty|traditional pig farm]] to large-scale [[intensive pig farming|intensive pig farms]]. This has resulted in lower production costs, but can cause significant [[Cruelty to animals|cruelty]] problems, and demand for pasture-raised pork in the United States has increased as consumers become concerned with humane treatment of livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/business/demand-grows-for-hogs-that-are-raised-humanely.html|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|title=Demand Grows for Hogs That Are Raised Humanely Outdoors|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As pets==
[[File:Mini pig 2.jpg|thumb|right|Crossbred miniature pig #1]] 
[[Vietnamese Pot-bellied|Vietnamese pot-bellied pig]]s, a [[miniature pig|small breed of domestic pig]], have made popular [[pet]]s in the [[United States]] beginning in the latter half of the twentieth century.

They were soon crossbred with a variety of other smaller breeds (such as the [[Göttingen minipig]]), with separate locations breeding different lineages. These [[miniature pig]]s soon gained attention, even more so than the original [[Vietnamese Pot-bellied|Vietnamese pot-bellied]]. As a result of this, many pet pigs are now of unknown genetic descent.

Domestic pigs are highly [[intelligent]], social creatures. They are considered hypoallergenic, and are known to do quite well with people who have usual animal allergies. Since these animals are known to have a life expectancy of 15 to 20 years, they require long-term commitment.

===Care===

Un-neutered male and female swine may express unwanted, aggressive behavior, and are prone to developing serious health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanminipigassociation.com/owners/helpful-owner-articles/spay-and-neuter|title=Spay and Neuter - American Mini Pig Association|website=americanminipigassociation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular trimming of the hooves is necessary; hooves left untreated cause major pain in the pig, can create malformations in bone structure, and may cause it to be more susceptible to fungal growth between crevices of the hoof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanminipigassociation.com/owners/helpful-owner-articles/hoof-trimming|title=Hoof Trimming - American Mini Pig Association|website=americanminipigassociation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As prey animals, natural behavior causes pigs to have a strong fear of being picked up, but they will usually calm down once placed back onto the ground. When holding the pig, supporting it under the legs is not as stressful for the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifewithaminipig.com/how-to-hold-a-mini-pig|title=Mini Pig Training: How to Hold a Mini Pig - Life with a Mini Pig|date=21 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pigs need enrichment activities to keep their intelligent minds occupied; if pigs get bored, they often get destructive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.minipiginfo.com/aggressive-mini-pigs.html|title=Aggressive Mini Pigs- How To Correct Aggression Issues|website=Mini Pig Info}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[#Rooting|rooting]] is found to be comforting, pigs kept in the house may root in household objects, and as such, should have a box with rocks, soil, straw, and/or other material for them to root in instead.

==In human medical applications==
The domestic pig, both as a live animal and source of post-mortem tissues, is one of the most valuable animal models used in biomedical research today, because of its biological, physiological and anatomical similarities to human beings.&lt;ref name=porcine2018Janu/&gt;&lt;ref name=porcine2018Janu2/&gt; For instance, human skin is very similar to pig skin, therefore pig skin has been used in many preclinical studies.&lt;ref name=porcine2018Janu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivis.org/proceedings/acvp/2009/Herron.pdf?LA=1|title=Pigs as Dermatologic Models of Human Skin Disease|last=Herron|first=Alan J.|date=5 December 2009|website = ivis.org | publisher = DVM Center for Comparative Medicine and Department of Pathology Baylor College of Medicine Houston, Texas | access-date = 27 January 2018 | quote = pig skin has been shown to be the most similar to human skin.

Pigs are currently thought to be the best non-human candidates for organ donation to humans. The risk of cross-species disease transmission is decreased because of their increased phylogenetic distance from humans.&lt;ref name=Dooldeniya2003&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dooldeniya | first1 = M. D. | last2 = Warrens | first2 = A.

(2007) [http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3715.htm Xenotransplantation]. Emedicine.com&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, no xenotransplantation trials have been entirely successful due to obstacles arising from the response of the recipient’s [[immune system]]—generally more extreme than in allotransplantations, ultimately results in rejection of the xenograft, and in some cases result in the death of the recipient—including hyperacute rejection, acute vascular rejection, cellular rejection and chronic rejection. An early major breakthrough was the 1,3 galactosyl transferase gene knockout.&lt;ref name=latemple&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-3089.1998.tb00027.x | last1 = Latemple | first1 = D.

Examples of viruses carried by pigs include porcine [[herpesvirus]], [[rotavirus]], [[parvovirus]], and [[circovirus]]. Of particular concern are PERVs (porcine endogenous retroviruses), vertically transmitted microbes that embed in swine genomes. The risks with xenosis are twofold, as not only could the individual become infected, but a novel infection could initiate an epidemic in the human population. Because of this risk, the FDA has suggested any recipients of xenotransplants shall be closely monitored for the remainder of their life, and quarantined if they show signs of xenosis.&lt;ref name=FDA2006&gt;FDA. (2006) [http://www.fda.gov/cber/xap/xap.htm Xenotransplantation Action Plan: FDA Approach to the Regulation of Xenotransplantation]. Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 PERVs in the genome using [[CRISPR#Editing|CRISPR Cas9 genome editing]] technology, and eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=NY Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/science/editing-of-pig-dna-may-lead-to-more-organs-for-people.html?_r=1 | author = Carl Zimmerman | title=Editing of Pig DNA May Lead to More Organs for People | date=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* The Dublin Principles */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3607">The '''Dublin Statement on Water and Sustainable Development''', also known as the '''Dublin Principles''', was a meeting of experts on water related problems that took place on 31 January 1992 at the International Conference on Water and the Environment (ICWE), Dublin, Ireland, organised on 26–31 January 1992.

The Dublin Statement on Water and Sustainable Development recognises the increasing [[water scarcity|scarcity of water]] as a result of the different conflicting uses and overuses of water.

== The Dublin Principles ==

The declaration sets out recommendations for action at local, national and international levels to reduce the scarcity, through the following four guiding principles:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wmo.ch/pages/prog/hwrp/documents/english/icwedece.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://docs.watsan.net/Scanned_PDF_Files/Class_Code_7_Conference/71-ICWE92-9739.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

#[[Fresh water]] is a [[finite resource|finite and vulnerable resource]], essential to sustain life, development and the environment
#[[Water development]] and [[water management|management]] should be based on a participatory approach, involving users, planners and policy-makers at all levels
#[[Women]] play a central part in the provision, management and safeguarding of water
#Water has an [[economic value]] in all its competing uses and should be recognized as an [[economic good]]

== Water as a human right or economic good? ==

The emphasis of the Dublin Statement on ''the economic value'' of water rather than water as ''a [[universal right]]'' is highly contested by [[NGO]]s and human rights activists (although the full text of principle 4 does state ''it is vital to recognize first the basic right of all human beings to have access to clean water and [[sanitation]] at an affordable price'')

In November 2002, however, the UN [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] adopted ''General Comment No. 15'', which was formulated by experts as a comment on articles 11 and 12 of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatercouncil.org/index.php?id%3D1764 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717002357/http://www.worldwatercouncil.org/index.php?id=1764 |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this comment, water is recognised not only as a limited natural resource and a public good but also as a [[human right]]. This step - adopting General Comment No. 15 - was seen as a decisive step towards the recognition of water as universal right.

On 30 September 2010, the 15th Session of the UN Human Rights Council passed Resolution A/HRC/15/L.14,&lt;ref&gt;http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/15/L.14&lt;/ref&gt; reaffirming an earlier General Assembly resolution (64/292 of 28 July 2010) which ''recognized the right to safe and clean [[drinking water]] and sanitation as a human right that is essential for the full enjoyment of life and all human rights''. Resolution A/HRC/15/L.14 clarifies that ''the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation is derived from the [[right to an adequate standard of living]] and inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of [[physical health|physical]] and [[mental health]], as well as the right to life and [[human dignity]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1188">In the area of [[mathematics]] known as [[semigroup theory]], an '''''E''-semigroup''' is a [[semigroup]] in which the [[idempotent]]s form a [[subsemigroup]].&lt;ref name="W"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s002330010131| title = Certain congruences on E-inversive E-semigroups| journal = [[Semigroup Forum]]| volume = 65| issue = 2| pages = 233| year = 2002| last1 = Weipoltshammer | first1 = B. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain classes of ''E''-semigroups have been studied long before the more general class, in particular, a [[regular semigroup]] that is also an ''E''-semigroup is known as an [[orthodox semigroup]].

Weipoltshammer proved that the notion of [[weak inverse]] (the existence of which is one way to define [[E-inversive semigroup|''E''-inversive semigroup]]s) can also be used to define/characterize ''E''-semigroups as follows: a semigroup ''S'' is an ''E''-semigroup if and only if, for all ''a'' and ''b'' ∈ ''S'', ''W''(''ab'') = ''W''(''b'')''W''(''a''), where ''W''(''x'') ≝ {''x'' ∈ ''S'' | ''xax'' = ''x''} is the set of weak inverses of ''x''.&lt;ref name="W"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2702">'''Elapsed real time''', '''real time''', '''wall-clock time''', or '''wall time''' is the actual time taken from the start of a [[computer program]] to the end. In other words, it is the difference between the time at which a task finishes and the time at which the task started.

Wall time is thus different from [[CPU time]], which measures only the time during which the processor is actively working on a certain task. The difference between the two can arise from [[Computer architecture|architecture]] and [[Runtime system|run-time]] dependent factors, e.g. [[sleep (operating system)|programmed delays]] or waiting for [[system resources]] to become available. Consider the example of a mathematical program that reports that it has used "CPU time 0m0.04s, Wall time 6m6.01s". This means that while the program was active for six minutes and six seconds, during that time the computer's processor spent only 4/100 of a second performing calculations for the program.

Conversely, programs [[Parallel computing|running in parallel]] on more than one processing unit can spend CPU time many times beyond their elapsed time. Since in [[concurrent computing]] the definition of elapsed time is non-trivial, the conceptualization of the elapsed time as measured on a separate, independent wall clock is convenient.

Another definition of "wall time" is the measurement of time via a separate, independent clock as opposed to the local system's internal time, i.e. with regard to the difference between the two.&lt;!-- This is a useless and thus bad definition: If you can state what "opposed" means, then the difference is known, which fundamentally means that the two clocks are synchronized, i.e. the same --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Wall time|url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/W/wall-time.html|work=The Jargon File|accessdate=June 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Real time" in the meaning of "wall time" should not be confused with [[real-time computing]]. 

== In Simulation ==
The term wall-clock time has also found widespread adoption in computer simulation, to distinguish between, first, the (often compressed or expanded) simulation time and, second, time as it passes for the user of the simulation tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NS-3 Manual|url=http://www.nsnam.org/docs/manual/html/realtime.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OMNeT++ Manual|url=http://www.omnetpp.org/doc/omnetpp/manual/usman.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nicol|first1=John|title=Fundamentals of Real-Time Distributed Simulation|isbn=978-0986841408|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emir Spahić''' ({{IPA-sh|ěmir spǎxiːtɕ|hr}}; born 18 August 1980) is a Bosnian former professional [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|centre back]].

During his club career, he represented teams in his homeland, Croatia, Russia, France, Spain and Germany.

A full international from 2003 to 2016, he was the [[Captain (association football)|captain]] of the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina national team]] from 2008 until the end of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].

==Club career==
Over the course of his career, Spahić played for [[NK Zagreb|Zagreb]], [[Shinnik Yaroslavl]], [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]] and [[FC Anzhi Makhachkala|Anzhi Makhachkala]].

He played for Zagreb and Leverkusen in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] and with Montpellier, Sevilla and Lokomotiv in the [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]].&lt;ref name=Bundesliga/&gt;

===Montpellier===
On 24 June 2009, Spahić announced that he would join newly promoted [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]] for the [[2009–10 Ligue 1]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.index.hr/clanak.aspx?category=sport&amp;id=440228|title=Spahic signs for Montpellier|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his league debut against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]], he scored a header in the 94th minute for a 1–1 draw, earning his side a point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/montpellier-vs-psg/105659|title=Montpellier - PSG 1:1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 August 2014, 34-year-old Spahić headed in a goal from a free kick to level the score at 2–2 in a game that finished 4–2 for Leverkusen against [[Hertha BSC]], thus ensuring his team's unbeaten start to the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leverkusen maintain perfect start|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/sport/football/2014/08/leverkusen-maintain-perfect-start-201483016814773801.html|accessdate=30 August 2014|newspaper=aljazeera.com|date=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spahić was sent off for two yellow cards in a 4–5 home defeat against [[VfL Wolfsburg]] on 14 February 2015; having been 1–4 down, the score was level at his time of dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wolfsburg win thriller at Bayer Leverkusen thanks to Bas Dost’s four-goal haul|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/14/bayer-leverkusen-wolfsburg-match-report|accessdate=14 February 2015|work=The Guardian|agency=Reuters|date=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spahić was the [[captain (association football)|captain]] of the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina national team]] before initially announcing his retirement.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klix.ba/sport/nogomet/safet-susic-za-klix-ba-postujem-spahicevu-odluku-nece-biti-lako-naci-njegovu-zamjenu/140807105|title=Emir Spahic retirement|language=Bosnian|publisher=klix.ba|date=7 August 2014|accessdate=7 August 2014|first=Sinan|last=Ziric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2003, he made his debut as a [[substitute (association football)|substitute]] against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] at [[Stadionul Ion Oblemenco]] in [[Craiova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.javno.ba/javno-teme/javnoba-ekspertiza-10-najboljih-bh-nogometaa-od-osamostaljenja-drave.html|title=JAVNO.ba EKSPERTIZA: 10 najboljih BH nogometaša od osamostaljenja države|date=20 October 2012|accessdate=2 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026035323/http://www.javno.ba/javno-teme/javnoba-ekspertiza-10-najboljih-bh-nogometaa-od-osamostaljenja-drave.html|archivedate=26 October 2012|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bihsoccer.com/Reprezentacija-BiH-Godina-2003.html|title=Reprezentacija BiH – Godina 2003|accessdate=2 April 2013|publisher=bihsoccer.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211171927/http://www.bihsoccer.com/Reprezentacija-BiH-Godina-2003.html|archivedate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February 2006, he scored his first international goal, in a friendly game against [[Japan national football team|Japan]], played in [[Dortmund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/sport/fudbal/vesti.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=01&amp;nav_id=190064|title=BiH vs Japan|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since his debut, he was an important member of the national team. He headed a ball into the box and assisted [[Ermin Bičakčić]] who scored a crucial equalizer versus [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]] in [[Žilina]] during [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group G#Matches|2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers]]. Bosnia and Herzegovina came back from one goal down in that game to win 2–1 and stay top of their qualifying group for ahead of [[Greece national football team|Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/uk/en/report/334762/hajrovic-hero|title=Hajrovic the hero|publisher=espnfc.com|date=10 September 2013|accessdate=11 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130913022443/http://espnfc.com/uk/en/report/334762/hajrovic-hero|archivedate=13 September 2013|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spahić retired from international football on 7 August 2014.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; After his retirement, Bosnia lost their first game of [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying|Euro 2016 qualifiers]] versus [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] (ranked 121 places behind Bosnia in FIFA Ranking for August 2014) without Spahić,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/novost164423|title=Šokantan poraz Bosne i Hercegovine|language=Bosnian}}{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in manager [[Safet Sušić]] calling him back from retirement on 22 September for the games that followed against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/244/286/8/|title=Spahic returns for Bosnia and Herzegovina EURO qualifiers|accessdate=22 September 2014|publisher=fifa.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027044808/http://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/244/286/8/|archivedate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Bosnia's key defenders were either injured&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bhdragons.com/sead-kolasinac-sidelined-for-six-months/|title=Sead Kolasinac Sidelined For Six Months|publisher=BHDragons|date=24 August 2014|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or lacked competitive matches for their clubs, which prompted in Spahić's call-up to the national side. Due to injury, he missed those two games and later returned to international stage against [[Israel national football team|Israel]] on November 16 where he played the full game, his first since playing against [[Iran national football team|Iran]] at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.klix.ba/sport/uzivo-izrael-bih/141116092|title=Izrael - BiH 3:0|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The emo subculture gained popularity among Iraqi teens in 2011. Earlier, it had become popular in other Arab countries. Emo, an offshoot of [[hardcore punk]] music,{{cn|date=May 2014}} is associated in most of the world with teen [[fashion]] and [[social alienation |alienation]], but in the Arab world is also strongly associated with [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bambury|first=Brent|title=Iraq emo killings: Associated Press Bureau Chief in Baghdad Lara Jakes talks about emo culture in Iraq (audio report)|url=http://www.cbc.ca/player/Radio/Day+6/Full+Episodes/2012/ID/2210891443/?page=13&amp;sort=MostPopular|accessdate=27 September 2012|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{!}} CBC Radio|date=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[Saudi Arabia]]'s religious police arrested 10 emo women for allegedly causing a disturbance in a coffee shop,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-05-23/saudi-emo-girls-busted-by-religious-cops/836866|title=Saudi 'emo' girls busted by religious cops|date=2010-05-23|newspaper=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008, conservative Egyptians criticized emo fashion-followers in [[Cairo]] for being "disciples of Satan and homosexuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=al-Attabi|first=Kadhim|title=Emo subculture on the rise among Baghdad teens|url=http://news.monstersandcritics.com/middleeast/news/article_1656804.php/Emo-subculture-on-the-rise-among-Baghdad-teens|accessdate=11 March 2012|newspaper=Monsters and Critics|date=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexuality is not illegal in Iraq but it is taboo, and many [[LGBT]] (lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender) people in Iraq are discriminated against, abused or murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraqi 'emo' youths reportedly killed by conservative militias|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17333275|accessdate=11 March 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In February 2012, the Baghdad [[Morality Police (Iraq)|Morality Police]] published a statement on the Iraqi Interior Ministry website criticizing emo teens for wearing "strange, tight clothes with pictures of skulls on them," and "rings in their noses and tongues." The statement condemned emo as [[Quake 3 Arena|Satanic]], and quoted Colonel [[Mushtaq Taleb al-Mahemdawi]] as saying the Morality Police had been given official approval by the Interior Ministry "to eliminate [the phenomenon] as soon as possible since it's detrimentally affecting the society and becoming a danger."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abramovitch|first=Seth|title=Truth Check: Is Iraq Killing Hundreds of Emo Teens?|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2012/03/truth-check-iraq-killing-hundreds-emo-teens/49736/|accessdate=11 March 2012|newspaper=Atlantic Monthly|date=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that in the weeks following, anti-emo flyers, threatening death "unless gay men cut their hair, stopped wearing the clothing of devil worshippers and stopped listening to metal, emo and rap music", began appearing in neighbourhoods across Baghdad.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

== Killings ==
[[Ministry of Interior (Iraq)|Interior Ministry]] security officers say the number of dead is six. However, the [[Reuters]] news agency reported that hospital and security officials put the number at 14 or more, and [[human rights]] groups such as the [[Brussells Tribunal]] said the dead number as many as 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emerging from Iraq: Reports of Kidnapping and Murder of Gay and Lesbian People|url=http://www.iglhrc.org/cgi-bin/iowa/article/takeaction/resourcecenter/1492.html|publisher=International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Associated Press]] reported that an unnamed Interior Ministry official put the number at 58, and said all but one were male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Associated Press|title=Violent 'Emo Killings' Rattle Iraqi Youth|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/03/11/148419422/violent-emo-killings-rattle-iraqi-youth|accessdate=12 March 2012|publisher=NPR|date=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the BBC, the [[United Nations]] puts the number of dead at at least 12, but believes the real number is much higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Antelava|first=Natalia|title=BBC investigation reveals police persecution of gays in Iraq|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-19570870|accessdate=27 September 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibility for the murders ==
International human rights groups have called on Iraqi authorities to investigate the killings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=AFP|title=Rights groups urge Iraq to investigate ‘emo’ killings|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/03/16/201079.html|accessdate=26 March 2012|publisher=Al Arabiya|date=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying they are the work of paramilitary groups and the police,&lt;ref name="vice"&gt;{{cite news|last=Taete|first=Jamie Lee Curtis|title=IS THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT KILLING LGBT PEOPLE?|url=https://www.vice.com/en_se/read/is-the-iraqi-government-killing-LGBT-people|accessdate=11 March 2012|newspaper=Vice magazine|date=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; including groups such as the [[Mahdi Army]], created in 2003 by popular [[Shia]] cleric [[Muqtada al-Sadr]].&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; Iraqi commentators and American professor of Middle Eastern history Mark Levine have speculated that deploying paramilitary groups against emo kids serves Iraqi authorities' interests by keeping the groups occupied, and deflecting their anger and unhappiness from other possible targets in chaotic post-war Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Levine|first=Mark|title=Killing emos, and the future, in Iraq|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/03/201231911938716976.html|accessdate=26 March 2012|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iraqi television network [[Al Sumaria]] reported that Sadr denied responsibility for the deaths, calling the emo teens fools and unnatural but saying they should be dealt with through legal means.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="alarabiya" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Al Arabiya News" /&gt;

Following coverage of the murders, Iraqi officials denied there is any campaign to kill gay or emo teenagers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ruhayem|first=Rami|title=Iraq's Emo killings: A horror story out of control?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17450437|accessdate=26 March 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and said the story has been made up to serve anti-religious, anti-government agendas. They say emo teens can dress as they please, and that the government will protect them.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="alarabiya" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Al Arabiya News" /&gt;

In September 2012, the BBC interviewed 17 gay men and former policemen in Baghdad, all of whom had friends or boyfriends killed, and reported that all blamed the Iraqi Interior Ministry for inciting the murders, and said arrests and killings are still ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Antelava|first=Natalia|title=BBC investigation reveals police persecution of gays in Iraq|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-19570870|accessdate=27 September 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
In May 2012 as a result of the emo killings, according to the [[International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission]], the Dutch government "expanded" its asylum policy towards LGBT Iraqis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iraq Baseline Study 2013|url=http://iglhrc.org/sites/default/files/Iraq%20Baseline%20Study%20Final%20with%20Table%20of%20Contents%201.29.13.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003222620/http://www.iglhrc.org/sites/default/files/Iraq%20Baseline%20Study%20Final%20with%20Table%20of%20Contents%201.29.13.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 October 2013|publisher=The International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission  (IGLHRC)|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[U.S. State Department|U.S. State department]]'s 2013 [[Country Reports on Human Rights Practices]] for Iraq reported that in 2013, Iraq's [[Cabinet of Iraq|Council of Ministers]] established an inter-ministerial committee that issued a statement saying LGBT people are "no different" from others, and that established a [[charter]] to describe the baseline protection owed to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iraq Human Rights Report 2013|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/220565.pdf|publisher=United States Department of State • Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
Israeli intelligence analyst Daniel Brode claims the murders are part of an overall shift inside the Iraqi Shiite-Arab population towards becoming "more religious, more conservative and more assertive," with the goal of consolidating its own power by creating a "fundamentalist Shiite government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brode|first=Daniel|title=Iraq: The Next Shiite Islamic Republic?|url=http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=51322|accessdate=26 March 2012|newspaper=Middle East Online|date=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[2003_invasion_of_iraq|2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq]], sexual minorities there enjoyed a fair amount of freedom. But the invasion brought to power the conservative [[Islamic Dawa Party]], and [[Human Rights Watch]] says that since 2004, hundreds of Iraqi gay men have been killed. The campaign has been said to be led by the Mahdi Army, with Iraqi security forces said to have "colluded and joined in the killing." Witnesses told Human Rights Watch the killers break into houses and pick up people in the street, interrogating them to extract the names of other victims, and then kill them and mutilate their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-gay attacks on rise in Iraq|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8204853.stm|accessdate=27 September 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=17 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2007, according to the London-based human rights organization [[Iraqi LGBT]], Iraqi political and religious organizations had launched an organised, coordinated campaign to hunt, arrest, torture and kill everyone they perceived as gay. Iraqi LGBT says the Iraqi government forces gay people to give names and addresses of other gays, then arrests them and hands them over to paramilitary groups to be murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hilli|first=Ali|title=Viewpoint: Iraqi gays in 'hell on earth'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19525137|accessdate=27 September 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper, American [[human rights]] activist [[Scott_Long_(human_rights_activist)|Scott Long]] described Iraq as "a devastated society with a broken political process and a fractured public" and said "it's not just wrong, it's counterproductive to call these murders "gay killings."" He called on Iraq to begin a debate about difference, saying "Iraqis need to discuss why the horrors of the last four decades have made otherness seem intolerable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Long|first=Scott|title=Massacre of emos in Iraq goes to core of a damaged society|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/18/iraq-massacre-emos-killing-gay|accessdate=27 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Neo-fascism}}
'''Europe a Nation''' was a policy developed by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Fascist]] politician [[Oswald Mosley]] as the cornerstone of his [[Union Movement]]. It called for the integration of [[Europe]] into a [[polity|single political entity]]. Although the idea failed to gain widespread support for the Union Movement, it nonetheless proved highly influential on the [[far-right]] thought in Europe.

==Origins==
The idea of a united Europe began to develop in the final days of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Concepts such as ''Nation Europa'' and ''Eurafrika'', both of which looked for an ever-closer union between European countries, gained some currency in the German far-right underground in the immediate aftermath of the [[Second World War]]. Mosley, who towards the end of the war had learned to read the [[German language]], read a number of pamphlets discussing these ideas and was strongly influenced by them.&lt;ref&gt;Thurlow, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; Another important influence was [[Benito Mussolini]]'s manifesto of the [[Italian Social Republic]], which included a call for the establishment of a European Community.&lt;ref name="Harris31"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thurlow, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

For his part, Mosley would later claim that he had first advocated something akin to Europe a Nation in speeches as early as 1936.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oswald Mosley]], ''My Life'', Nelson, 1970, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; It was not, however, [[British Union of Fascists]] policy at any time.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Development==
Mosley first presented his idea of Europe forming a single state in his book ''The Alternative'' in 1947.&lt;ref name="Mack36"&gt;Macklin, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the traditional vision of nationalism that had been followed by the various shades of pre-war fascism had been too narrow in scope and that the post-war era required a new paradigm in which Europe would come together as a single state.&lt;ref&gt;Thurlow, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected any notion of a [[federal Europe]], instead calling for full integration.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Eatwell, ''Fascism: A History'', Random House, 2011, pp. 330-331&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Mosley insisted that a supranational European state was essential to the plan.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was presented to the wider electorate in October 1948 when Mosley called for elections to a European Assembly as the first step towards his vision.&lt;ref name="Harris31"&gt;Harris, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion also had an important [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] dimension as Mosley saw it as the only defence against Europe becoming the scene of the power struggles between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, pp. 79-80&lt;/ref&gt; He contended that the racial kinship between the Germanic peoples of Europe, whom he defined as the Germans, British, Scandinavians and northern French, would be the basis for unity, whilst also declaring his admiration for the contributions of the Latin peoples to Europe's cultural history.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

He was opposed to both the [[United Nations]] and its predecessor the [[League of Nations]], dismissing both as part of a Jewish plot to undermine nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Europe a Nation was to include an [[anti-Semitic]] dimension, with the entire Jewish population of Europe to be expelled to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], where they could decide their own fate.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, pp. 80-81&lt;/ref&gt;

Africa, most of which was still in the hands of the European colonial empires, was to be retained by the united Europe as a giant colony, with [[apartheid]] implemented on a continental basis, effectively excluding Blacks from Europe.&lt;ref name="Harris31"/&gt; Notions of any indigenous rule in Africa were excluded altogether from the idea.&lt;ref name="Thur245"/&gt; With [[autarky]] a central aim of Europe a Nation, Africa was to be exploited by the new state for its mineral and food resources. In this aspect, Mosley was heavily influenced by the works of [[Anton Zischka]].&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Mosley subsequently built upon the policy by calling for the European state to have its prices and incomes regulated by a "wage price mechanism", whilst also calling for "European Socialism", a syndical style organisation basis for the continent's industry.&lt;ref&gt;Thurlow, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively though the vision he presented was one that was highly steeped in [[corporatism]] and [[elitism]].&lt;ref name="Mack82"&gt;Macklin, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Elections were to be corporatist in nature with an occupation-based franchise (previously a British Union of Fascists policy) whilst "European Socialism" was to include an effective free hand for business leaders but the co-ordination of workers in bodies called "labour Charters", a policy borrowed from the Fascist Italy.&lt;ref name="Mack82"/&gt;

Mosley summed up the arguments himself by stating that 'no lesser degree of union than that of an integral nation can give the will and power to act on the great scale.... No lesser space than all Europe, and the overseas possessions of Europe in a common pool, can give the room within which to act effectively'.&lt;ref&gt;Oswald Mosley, 'European Socialism', ''The European'', May 1956&lt;/ref&gt; However Europe a Nation drew heavily on the existing heritage of fascism and indeed Graham Macklin has argued that it "merely adapted and enlarged the parameters of his fascist panacea to suit the times, and is thus easily recognisable as 'Fascist'".&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Within the UK, the notion of Europe a Nation largely failed to attract the younger far-right activists, most of whom deserted Mosley in favour of the [[League of Empire Loyalists]] (LEL) and other more minor and more extreme groups.&lt;ref&gt;Thurlow, pp. 244-245&lt;/ref&gt; [[A.K. Chesterton]], who went on to lead the LEL, was a strong critic of Europe a Nation from 1947 when ''The Alternative'' was first published, preferring to emphasise [[British nationalism]].&lt;ref name="Mack36"/&gt;

The policy also failed to capture the minds of the British electorate, with the Union Movement enjoying comparative success in voting terms only when they emphasised more basic anti-immigrant rhetoric.&lt;ref name="Thur245"&gt;Thurlow, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[Alexander Raven Thomson]], one of Mosley's closest lieutenants and noted for his sycophantic attitudes towards his leader, eventually told Mosley in 1950 that Europe a Nation held little attraction to British voters. As a consequence, the Union Movement briefly downplayed the idea, although Thomson's preferred alternative, [[neo-Nazism]], was soon abandoned as well when it proved equally unpalatable to the electorate.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the wider European far-right, however, Europe a Nation did gain some wider currency. [[Fritz Rössler]], at the time going by the alias Dr. Franz Richter, became an enthusiastic supporter of the idea and attempted to make it [[Deutsche Reichspartei]] policy. He failed in this attempt and was expelled from the party, decamping to the [[Socialist Reich Party]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; For a time it also had the support of [[Adolf von Thadden]], who helped Mosley to organise the [[National Party of Europe]], a largely failed attempt to build a continental Europe a Nation political party.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately however the plan's main supporter in Germany proved to be [[Arthur Erhardt]], who established the journal ''[[Nation Europa]]'' to support far-right pan-European nationalist ideas, to which Mosley was a frequent contributor.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside Germany it also gained some currency within the [[Italian Social Movement]], although by the early 1950s that wing of the party lost influence, the Italian nationalist arm gaining supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Similar ideas would later be developed by [[Jean-François Thiriart]] and others interested in [[Europeanism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin A. Lee]], ''[[The Beast Reawakens]]'', Warner Books, 1998, pp. 170–174&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Europe a Nation was also an important influence on the thinking of [[Alain de Benoist]] and in particular the work of the think tank ''[[Groupement de recherche et d'études pour la civilisation européenne]]'' which he established in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Algebraic modeling language]]s like [[AIMMS]], [[AMPL]], [[General Algebraic Modeling System|GAMS]], MPL and others have been developed to facilitate the description of a problem in mathematical terms and to link the abstract formulation with data-management systems on the one hand and appropriate algorithms for solution on the other. Robust algorithms and modeling language interfaces have been developed for a large variety of [[Mathematical optimization|mathematical programming]] problems such as [[Linear programming|Linear Programs]] (LPs),  [[Nonlinear programming|Nonlinear Programs]] (NPs), Mixed Integer Programs (MIPs), [[Mixed complementarity problem|Mixed Complementarity Programs]] (MCPs) and others. Researchers are constantly updating the types of problems and algorithms that they wish to use to model in specific domain applications.

'''Extended Mathematical Programming''' ('''EMP''') is an extension to algebraic modeling languages that facilitates the automatic reformulation of new model types by converting the EMP model into established mathematical programming classes to solve by mature solver algorithms. A number of important problem classes can be solved. Specific examples are [[Variational inequality|Variational Inequalities]],  [[Nash equilibrium|Nash Equilibria]], Disjunctive Programs  and [[Stochastic programming|Stochastic Programs]].

EMP is independent of the modeling language used but currently it is implemented only in GAMS. The new types of problems modeled with EMP are reformulated with the GAMS solver JAMS to well established types of problems and the reformulated models are passed to a suitable GAMS solver to be solved. The core of EMP is a file called &lt;tt&gt;emp.info&lt;/tt&gt; where the annotations that are needed for the reformulations are added to the model.

== Equilibrium problems ==

Equilibrium problems model questions arising in the study of [[Economic equilibrium|economic equilibria]] in a mathematically abstract form. Equilibrium problems include Variational Inequalities, problems with Nash Equilibria, and Multiple Optimization Problems with Equilibrium Constraints (MOPECs). Use EMP's keywords to reformulate these problems as [[Mixed complementarity problem|Mixed Complementarity Problems]] (MCPs), a class of problems for which mature solver technology exists. Solve the newly reformulated EMP keyword version of the problem with the PATH solver or other GAMS [[Mixed complementarity problem|MCP]] solvers.

Examples of the use of  EMP to solve equilibrium problems include the computation of Cournot-Nash-Walras equilibria..,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Outrata, JV, Ferris, MC, Červinka, M and Outrata, M| title=On Cournot-Nash-Walras equilibria and their computation| year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; modeling water allocation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Britz, W, Ferris, MC and Kuhn, A | title=Modeling Water Allocating Institutions based on Multiple Optimization Problems with Equilibrium Constraints| journal=Environmental Modelling &amp; Software| year=2013| volume=46| pages=196–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Bauman, A, Goemans, C, Pritchett, J and McFadden, DT | title=Modeling Imperfectly Competitive Water Markets in the Western U.S| journal=Selected Paper prepared for presentation at the 2015 Agricultural &amp; Applied Economics Association and Western Agricultural Economics Association Annual Meeting, San Francisco, CA, July 26–28| year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; long-term planning of transmission line expansion of the electrical grid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Tang, L  |author2=Ferris, MC| title=A Hierarchical Framework for Long-Term Power Planning Models| journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Systems| year=2015| volume=30| number=1| pages=46–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; modeling [[Risk aversion|risk-averse]] agents in hydro-thermal electricity markets with uncertain inflows into hydro reservoirs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Philpott, A, Ferris, MC and Wets, R | title=Equilibrium, uncertainty and risk in hydro-thermal electricity systems| journal=Mathematical Programming, Series B, to appear| year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modeling [[Variational inequality|Variational Inequalities]] in energy markets &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authors=Gabriel, SA, Conejo, AJ, Fuller, JD, Hobbs, BF and Ruiz| title=Complementarity Modeling in Energy Markets| series= International Series in Operations Research &amp; Management Science | volume=180 | publisher=Springer New York, pp 181-220 and 323-384| year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hierarchical optimization ==

Hierarchical optimization problems are [[Mathematical optimization|mathematical programs]] with an additional optimization problem in their constraints. A simple example is the [[Bilevel optimization|bilevel programming]] problem that optimizes an upper level objective over constraints that include another lower level optimization problem. Bilevel programming is used in many areas. One example is the design of optimal tax instruments. The tax instrument is modeled in the upper level and the clearing market is modeled in the lower level. In general, 
the lower level problem may be an optimization problem or a [[Variational inequality|Variational Inequality]]. Several keywords are provided to facilitate reformulating hierarchical optimization problems. Bilevel optimization problems modeled with EMP are reformulated to [[Mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints|Mathematical Programs with Equilibrium Constraints]] (MPECs) and then they are solved with one of the GAMS MPEC solvers (NLPEC or [[KNITRO]]).

== Disjunctive programming ==

[[Mathematical optimization|Mathematical programs]] involving binary variables and disjunction definitions for modeling discrete choices are called disjunctive programs. Disjunctive programs have many applications, including ordering of tasks in a production process, organizing complex projects in a time saving manner and choosing the optimal route in a circuit. Procedures for linear and nonlinear disjunctive programming extensions are implemented within EMP. Linear disjunctive programs are reformulated as mixed integer programs (MIPs) and nonlinear disjunctive programs are reformulated as mixed integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs). They are solved with the solver LogMIP 2.0 and possibly other GAMS subsolvers.

Examples of the use of EMP for disjunctive programming include scheduling problems in the chemical industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Grossmann, IE| title=Advances in mathematical programming models for enterprise-wide optimization| journal=Computers and  Chemical Engineering| year=2012| volume=47|  pages=2–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== EMP for stochastic programming ==
EMP SP is the stochastic extension of the EMP framework. A deterministic model with fixed parameters is transformed into a stochastic model where some of the parameters are not fixed but are represented by probability distributions. This is done with annotations and specific keywords. Single and joint discrete and [[Probability distribution|parametric probability distributions]] are possible. In addition, there are keywords for the [[Expected value|Expected Value]], [[Value at risk|Value at Risk]] (VaR) and [[Expected shortfall|Conditional Value at Risk]] (CVaR). Variables that are risk measures can feature in the objective equation or in constraints. EMP SP facilitates the optimization of a single risk measure or a combination of risk measures (for example, the weighted sum of Expected Value and CVaR). In addition, the modeler can choose to trade off risk measures. It is also possible to model constraints that only hold with certain probabilities (chance constraints). Currently, the following GAMS solvers can be used with EMP SP: DE, DECIS, JAMS and [[LINDO]]. Any GAMS solver can be used to process the pre-sampled [[Stochastic programming#Deterministic equivalent of a stochastic problem|deterministic equivalent]] problem.

In [[critical theory]], [[sociology]], and [[psychoanalysis]], the '''gaze''' (translated from French ''le regard'') is the act of seeing and being seen.

Numerous [[existentialism|existentialists]] and [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologists]] have addressed the concept of gaze beginning with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', Part 3, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] elaborated on gaze to illustrate a particular dynamic in power relations and disciplinary mechanisms in his ''[[Discipline and Punish]]''. [[Derrida]] also elaborated on the relations of animals and humans via the gaze in ''The Animal That Therefore I Am''. The concept of a male gaze was originally theorized by feminist film theorist [[Laura Mulvey]], and has since been applied to many other forms of media and technology, such as advertisements, the work space, and video games.

==In psychoanalysis==

In [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]] psychoanalytic theory, it is the anxious state that comes with the awareness that one can be viewed. The psychological effect, Lacan argues, is that the subject loses a degree of autonomy upon realizing that he or she is a visible object. This concept is bound with his theory of the [[mirror stage]], in which a child encountering a mirror realizes that he or she has an external appearance. Lacan suggests that this gaze effect can similarly be produced by any conceivable object such as a chair or a television screen. This is not to say that the object behaves optically as a mirror; instead it means that the [[awareness]] of any object can induce an awareness of also ''being'' an object.

It has also been called an aspect of one of the "most powerful human forces"; that is, "the meeting of the face and the gaze" because "Only there do we exist for one another."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Ove Knausgaard, "The Inexplicable," ''The New Yorker,'' May 25, 2015, page 32]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systems of power and the gaze==
[[Michel Foucault]] first used the term "medical gaze" in ''[[The Birth of the Clinic]]'' to explain the process of medical diagnosis, power dynamics between doctors and patients, and the hegemony of medical knowledge in society. He elaborated on the gaze to illustrate a particular dynamic in power relations and disciplinary mechanisms in his ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'', such as surveillance and the function of related disciplinary mechanisms and self-regulation in a prison or school as an apparatus of power.

The gaze is not something one has or uses; rather, it is the relationship into which someone enters. As [[Marita Sturken]] and [[Lisa Cartwright]] write in ''Practices of Looking'', "The gaze is integral to systems of power and ideas about knowledge."&lt;ref name=Cartwright&gt;Sturken, Marita; Cartwright, Lisa. ''Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture''. Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 94, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Three main concepts that Foucault introduced are [[panopticism]], [[power/knowledge]], and [[biopower]]. These concepts all address self-regulation under systems of [[surveillance]]. This refers to how people modify their behaviour under the belief that they are constantly being watched even if they cannot directly see who or what is watching them. This possible surveillance, whether real or unreal, has self-regulating effects.&lt;ref&gt;Sturken, Marita and Lisa Cartwright. ''Practices of Looking: an introduction to visual culture''. Oxford University Press, 2009. pp. 106-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The male gaze ==
{{main article|Male gaze}}
In her 1975 essay ''Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema'', [[Laura Mulvey]] introduced the [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist]] concept of "[[male gaze]]" as a feature of gender power asymmetry in film. The concept was present in earlier studies of the gaze,{{specify|date=June 2016}} but it was Mulvey who brought it to the forefront. Mulvey stated that women were objectified in film because heterosexual men were in control of the camera. Hollywood films played to the models of [[voyeurism]] and [[scopophilia]].&lt;ref&gt;Sturken, Marita and Lisa Cartwright. ''Practices of Looking: an introduction to visual culture''. Oxford University Press, 2001. p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has subsequently been influential in [[feminist film theory]] and [[media studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Sassatelli, Roberta. ''Interview with Laura Mulvey: Gender, Gaze and Technology in Film Culture''. Theory, Culture &amp; Society, September 2011, 28(5) p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The feminine gaze ==
{{Main article|Judith Butler}}

In [[Judith Butler]]'s 1990 book ''[[Gender Trouble]]'', she proposed the idea of the feminine gaze as a way in which men choose to perform their masculinity by using women as the ones who force men into self-regulation.

== Imperial gaze&lt;!-- linked from 'Male gaze'--&gt; ==
[[E. Ann Kaplan]] has introduced the [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial]] concept of the imperial gaze, in which the observed find themselves defined in terms of the privileged observer's own set of value-preferences.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Ashcroft et al, ''Post-Colonial Studies'' (2000) p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of the colonised, the imperial gaze infantilizes and trivializes what it falls upon,&lt;ref&gt;Vijay Mishra, ''Bollywood Cinema'' (2002) p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; asserting its command and ordering function as it does so.&lt;ref&gt;E. H. Yekani, ''The Privilege of Crisis'' (2011) p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaplan comments: "The imperial gaze reflects the assumption that the white western subject is central much as the male gaze assumes the centrality of the male subject."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Patricia Waugh, ''Literary Theory and Criticism'' (2006) p. 514&lt;/ref&gt;

== The oppositional gaze ==
In her 1992 essay titled "The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectatorship",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Feminism and Visual Cultural Reader|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=Amelia Jones|year=|isbn=|location=New York: Routledge, 2003|pages=94–105|chapter=The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectator|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[bell hooks]] counters [[Laura Mulvey]]'s notion of the [[Male gaze|(male) gaze]] by introducing the oppositional gaze of Black women. This concept exists as the reciprocal of the normative white spectator gaze. As [[Laura Mulvey|Mulvey]]'s essay&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media and Cultural Studies: Keywords|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|publisher=Meenakshi Gigi Durham and Douglas Kellner|year=|isbn=|location=2001; Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2006|pages=342–352|chapter=Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; contextualizes the [[Male gaze|(male) gaze]] and its objectification of white women, [[Bell hooks|hooks]] essay&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; opens "oppositionality [as] a key paradigm in the feminist analysis of the 'gaze' and of scopophilic regimes in Western culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thinking Differently: A Reader in European Women's Studies|last=Griffin|first=Gabriele, and Rosi Braidotti|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=London: Zed, 2002|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oppositional gaze remains a critique of rebellion due to the sustained and deliberate misrepresentation of Black women in cinema as characteristically [[Mammy archetype|Mammy]], [[Jezebel]] or Sapphire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M.|first=West, Carolyn|date=2012-01-01|title=Mammy, Jezebel, Sapphire, and Their Homegirls: Developing an "Oppositional Gaze" Toward the Images of Black Women|url=http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/ias_pub/270/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postcolonial gaze===
First referred to by Edward Said as "orientalism", the term "post-colonial gaze" is used to explain the relationship that colonial powers extended to people of colonized countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Said|first=Edward|title=Orientalism|year=1978|publisher=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placing the colonized in a position of the "[[Other (philosophy)#Imperialism and colonialism|other]]" helped to shape and establish the colonial's identity as being the powerful conqueror, and acted as a constant reminder of this idea.&lt;ref name = Beardsell&gt;{{cite book|last=Beardsell|first=Peter|title=Europe and Latin America: Returning the Gaze|year=2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The postcolonial gaze "has the function of establishing the subject/object relationship&amp;nbsp;... it indicates at its point of emanation the location of the subject, and at its point of contact the location of the object".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beardsell|first=Peter|title=Europe and Latin America: Returning the Gaze|year=2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester, UK|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, this means that the colonizer/colonized relationship provided the basis for the colonizer's understanding of themselves and their identity.&lt;ref name = Beardsell/&gt; The role of the appropriation of power is central to understanding how colonizers influenced the countries that they colonized, and is deeply connected to the development of post-colonial theory. Utilizing postcolonial gaze theory allows formerly colonized societies to overcome the socially constructed barriers that often prohibit them from expressing their true [[Economic, social and cultural rights|cultural, social, economic]], and [[civil and political rights|political rights]].&lt;ref name = Beardsell/&gt;


'''The international gaze'''
The international gaze is the term used to describe the Neo Liberal and globalising manifestation of the imperial,- / post-colonial gaze. Both latter terms are helpful in defining the dominated status of developing countries. However, the international gaze offers a way of understanding how internationalism, seemingly neutral and optimistic in outlook, is deeply rooted in a discourse of advantage and power. It inculcates an implicit assumption of dominance by those empowered to be international, whilst obviating the innate power relations. This term is first used by A. Gardner-McTaggart (2018) in ''International Capital, International Schools, Leadership and Christianity

''
'''The male tourist gaze'''

The tourism image is created through cultural and ideological constructions and advertising agencies that have been male dominated. What is represented by the media assumes a specific type of tourist: white, Western, male, and heterosexual, privileging the gaze of the "master subject" over others.&lt;ref name="Privileging the Male Gaze"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pritchard and Morgan|first1=Annette and Nigel|title=Privileging the Male Gaze|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|date=2000|issue=27.4|pages=884–905|doi=10.1016/s0160-7383(99)00113-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the representation of the typical tourist because those behind the lens, the image, and creators are predominantly male, white, and Western. Those that do not fall into this category are influenced by its supremacy. Through these influences female characteristics such as youth, beauty, sexuality, or the possession of a man are desirable while the prevalence of stereotypes consisting of submissive and sensual women with powerful "macho" men in advertising are projected.&lt;ref name="Privileging the Male Gaze"/&gt;

{{cleanup|date=April 2012}}
In [[psychology]], the term '''identity crisis''' means the failure to achieve ego [[Identity formation|identity]] during adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;Kendra Cherry, [http://psychology.about.com/od/theoriesofpersonality/a/identitycrisis.htm Identity Crisis - Theory and Research]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "S216"&gt;(Schultz, 216)&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by German psychologist [[Erik Erikson]].

The [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stage of psychosocial development]] in which identity crisis may occur is called the Identity Cohesion vs. Role Confusion. During this stage, adolescents are faced with physical growth, sexual maturity, and integrating ideas of themselves and about what others think of them.&lt;ref name="Schultz, 215-216"&gt;(Schultz, 215-216)&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents therefore form their self-image and endure the task of resolving the crisis of their basic ego identity. Successful resolution of the crisis depends on one's [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|progress through previous developmental stages]], centering on issues such as trust, autonomy, and initiative.&lt;ref name="Schultz, 215-216"/&gt;

Erikson's own interest in identity began in childhood. Born [[Ashkenazic Jewish]], Erikson felt that he was an outsider. His later studies of cultural life among the [[Yurok]] of northern California and the [[Sioux]] of South Dakota helped formalize Erikson's ideas about identity development and identity crisis. Erikson described those going through an identity crisis as exhibiting confusion.&lt;ref name = "S216"/&gt;

==Concept==
{{Main article|Erikson's stages of psychosocial development}}

Sometimes individuals face obstacles that may prevent the development of a strong identity. This sort of unresolved crisis leaves individuals struggling to "find themselves". They often seem to have no idea who or what they are, where they belong or where they want to go. They may withdraw from normal life, not taking action or acting as they usually would at work, in their marriage or at school, or be unable to make defining choices about the future. They may even turn to negative activities, such as crime or drugs since from their point of view having a negative identity could be more acceptable than none at all.&lt;ref name = "S216"/&gt;

On the other side of the spectrum, those who emerge from the adolescent stage of personality development with a strong sense of identity are well equipped to face adulthood with confidence and certainty. 

Erikson felt that peers have a strong impact on the development of ego identity during adolescence. He believed that association with negative groups such as cults or fanatics could actually "redistrict" the developing ego during this fragile time. The basic strength that Erikson found should be developed during adolescence is [[fidelity]], which only emerges from a cohesive ego identity. Fidelity is known to encompass sincerity, genuineness and a sense of duty in our relationships with other people.&lt;ref name = "S216"/&gt;

He described identity as "a subjective sense as well as an observable quality of personal sameness and continuity, paired with some belief in the sameness and continuity of some shared world image. As a quality of unself-conscious living, this can be gloriously obvious in a young person who has found himself as he has found his commonality. In him we see emerge a unique unification of what is irreversibly given &amp;mdash; that is, body type and temperament, giftedness and vulnerability, infantile models and acquired ideals &amp;mdash; with the open choices provided in available roles, occupational possibilities, values offered, mentors met, friendships made, and first sexual encounters."&lt;ref name = "E730"&gt;(Erikson, 730)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marcian theory==
{{Main article|James Marcia}}

James Marcia's research on identity statuses of adolescents also apply to Erikson's framework of identity crises in adolescents.

'''Identity foreclosure''' is an identity status which Marcia claimed is an identity developed by an individual without much choice.  "The foreclosure status is when a commitment is made without exploring alternatives. Often these commitments are based on parental ideas and beliefs that are accepted without question".&lt;ref name="social.jrank.org"&gt;James Marcia, [http://social.jrank.org/pages/322/Identity-Development.html Identity Development - Aspects of Identity]&lt;/ref&gt;  Identity foreclosure can contribute to identity crises in adolescents when the "security blanket" of their assumed identity is removed.  These "foreclosed individuals often go into crisis, not knowing what to do without being able to rely on the norms, rules, and situations to which they have been accustomed."&lt;ref&gt;Seth J. Scwartz, ''The Evolution of Eriksonian and Neo-Eriksonian Identity Theory and Research: A review and Integration''.  "Identity, An International Journal of Theory and Research", 2001 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this would be a son of a farmer who learns that his father is selling the farm, and whose identity as an heir to a farm and the lifestyle and identity of a farmer has been shaken by that news.

'''Identity diffusion''' is a Marcian identity status that can lead to identity crises in adolescents.  Identity diffusion can be described as "the apathetic state that represents the relative lack of both exploration and commitment".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Identity diffusion can overlap with diagnoses such as schizophrenia and depression, and can best be described as a lack of identity structure.  An example of an identity crisis emerging from this status is an adolescent who becomes recluse after his identity as a star athlete is destroyed by a serious injury.

'''Identity moratorium''' is the status that Marcia theorizes lasts the longest in individuals, is the most volatile, and can be best described as "the active exploration of alternatives".&lt;ref name="social.jrank.org"/&gt;  Individuals experiencing identity moratorium can be very open-minded and thoughtful but also in crisis over their identity.&lt;ref&gt;(Schwartz, 12)&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this would be a college student who lacks conviction in their future after changing majors multiple times but still cannot seem to find their passion.

'''Identity achievement''' is the resolution to many identity crises.  Identity achievement occurs when the adolescent has explored and committed to important aspects of their identity."&lt;ref&gt;(Marcia)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology}}

'''Inalienable possessions''' (or '''immovable property''') are things such as land or objects that are symbolically identified with the groups that own them and so cannot be permanently severed from them. [[Landed estate]]s in the [[Middle Ages]], for example, had to remain intact and even if sold, they could be reclaimed by blood kin. As a legal classification, inalienable possessions date back to Roman times. According to Barbara Mills, "Inalienable possessions are objects made to be kept (not exchanged), have symbolic and economic power that cannot be transferred, and are often used to authenticate the ritual authority of corporate groups".&lt;ref name="Mills 2004 238"/&gt; 

[[Marcel Mauss]] first described inalienable possessions in ''[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]'', discussing [[potlatch]]es, a kind of gift-giving feast held in communities of many [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|indigenous peoples]] of the [[Pacific Northwest]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is even incorrect to speak in these cases of transfer. They are [[loans]] rather than sales or true abandonment of possessions. Among the [[Kwakiutl]] a certain number of objects, although they appear at the [[potlatch]], cannot be disposed of. In reality these pieces of "property" are [[wikt:sacrum#Latin|sacra]] that a family divests itself of only with great reluctance and sometimes never.&lt;ref name="Mauss2000"&gt;Mauss 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Annette Weiner]] broadened the application of the category of property outside the European context with her book ''Inalienable Possessions: The Paradox of Keeping-While-Giving'', focussing on a range of Oceanic societies from [[Polynesia]] to [[Papua New Guinea]] and testing existing theories of [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] and marriage exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=131–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also applies the concept to explain examples such as the [[Kula ring]] in the [[Trobriand Islands]], which was made famous by [[Bronisław Malinowski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=32–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She explores how such possessions enable hierarchy by establishing a source of lasting social difference. She also describes practices of loaning inalienable possessions as a way of either "temporarily making kin of non-kin" or garnering status.

== ''Inalienable Possessions: The Paradox of Keeping-While-Giving'' ==
''Inalienable Possessions: The Paradox of Keeping-While-Giving'' is a book by anthropologist [[Annette Weiner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weiner was a Professor of Anthropology and Dean of the Graduate School of Arts at [[New York University]], and served as president of the [[American Anthropological Association]]. She died in 1997.

The book focuses on a range of Oceanic societies from Polynesia to Papua New Guinea to test existing theories of [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] (gift-giving) and marriage exchange. The book is also important for introducing a consideration of gender in the [[Gift economy|gift-giving debate]] by placing women at the heart of the political process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mills|first=Barbara|title=The establishment and defeat of hierarchy: Inalienable possessions and the history of collective prestige structures in the Pueblo Southwest|journal=American Anthropologist|year=2004|volume=106|issue=2|pages=239–41|doi=10.1525/aa.2004.106.2.238}}&lt;/ref&gt; She finds inalienable possessions at the root of many Polynesian kingdoms, such as [[Hawaii]] and [[Samoa]]. She also credits the original idea of "inalienable possessions" to Mauss, who classified two categories of goods in Samoa, ''Oloa'' and ''le'Tonga''─immovable and movable goods exchanged through marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbara Mills praised her investigation of how "inalienable possessions are simultaneously used to construct and defeat hierarchy", saying it "opens a boxful of new theoretical and methodological tools for understanding [[social inequality]] in past and present societies."&lt;ref name="Mills 2004 238"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mills|first=Barbara|title=The establishment and defeat of hierarchy: Inalienable possessions and the history of collective prestige structures in the Pueblo Southwest|journal=American Anthropologist|year=2004|volume=106|issue=2|page=238|doi=10.1525/aa.2004.106.2.238}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Cosmological authentication==
[[File:Maori cloak.jpg|left|thumb |Young Maori woman wearing a high status feather cloak indicating nobility]]
Weiner states that certain objects become inalienable only when they have acquired "cosmological authentication"; that is,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
What makes a possession inalienable is its exclusive and cumulative identity with a particular series of owners through time.  Its history is authenticated by fictive or true genealogies, origin myths, sacred ancestors, and gods.  In this way, inalienable possessions are transcendent treasures to be guarded against all the exigencies that might force their loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She gives the example of a [[Māori people|Māori]] Sacred Cloak and says that when a woman wears it "she is more than herself – that she is her ancestors." Cloaks act as conduits for a person's hau or life giving spirit.  The hau can bring strength or even knowledge potentially but a person may also have the risk of losing their hau. "An inalienable possession acts as a stabilizing force against change because its presence authenticates cosmological origins, kinship, and political histories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, the Cloak actually stands for the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=49–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; "These possessions then are the most potent force in the effort to subvert change, while at the same time they stand as the corpus of change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Sillitoe queries the supposed identification of these objects with persons. He states that these objects are "durable wealth [that] is collective property that is continually in circulation among persons who have temporary possession of it. In this view, transactable objects belong to society as a whole and are not inalienable possessions associated with certain persons. An analogy in Western culture is sporting trophies, such as championship boxing belts owned by all the clubs comprising the association that controls the competition in which constituent club members compete, and which pass for agreed periods of time into the possession of particular champions, changing hands as new champions emerge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sillitoe|first=Paul|title=Why Spheres of Exchange|journal=Ethnology|year=2006|volume=45|issue=1|pages=15|doi=10.2307/4617561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theuws argues that "Over time, objects acquire new meanings and what was once a humble pot may become a sacred vessel." This transformation in the object is the result of [[ritualization]] or a change in cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Topographies of Power in the Early Middle Ages Maastricht as a center of power in the early Middle Ages|year=2001|publisher=Brill|location=Amsterdam|pages=201–2|author=Theuws, Frans|authorlink=Maastricht as a centre of power|editors=Theuws, Frans, Van Rhijn, Carine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, "[[Ritual Knowledge]] is often a source of political power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spielmann|first=K.A.|title=Feasting, Craft Specialization, and the Ritual Mode of Production in Small-Scale Societies|journal=American Anthropologist|year=2002|volume=104|issue=1|pages=195–207|doi=10.1525/aa.2002.104.1.195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these possessions may also become destabilizing, as elites reconstruct those sacred histories to identify themselves with the past; for example, [[Gandhi]] invoked the traditional hand spinning traditional cloth, khadi, to contest British rule, which [[Nehru]] referred to as Gandhi's "livery of freedom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Keeping-while-giving==

Inalienable possessions are nonetheless frequently drawn into exchange networks. The subtitle of Weiner's book is "The paradox of keeping-while-giving"; they are given as gifts (not sold) yet still retain a tie to their owners. These gifts are not like those given in regular [[gift giving]] in the West on birthdays for example.  Rather, these gifts can't be re-sold for money by the receiver because the value and the significance of the gift cannot be alienated or disengaged from its relationship to those whose inalienable possession it is.

=== Property value, obligations and rights ===

These inalienable possessions are a form of property that is inalienable, yet they can be exchanged. Property can be thought of as a [[bundle of rights]] – the right to use something, the right to collect rent from someone, the right to extract something (as in oil drilling), the right to hunt within a particular territory.  That ownership may be a bundle of rights held in common by groups of individuals or lineages. The property thus becomes impossible to separate from the group owning it.   "To give in this instant means to transfer without alienating, or to use the language of the West, to give means to cede the right of use without ceding actual ownership".  In other words, Weiner is contending that an economy built around the moral code of gift giving provides the giver rights over what he/she has given and in turn "subsequently benefits from a series of advantages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when one accepts a gift one also accepts that the giver now has rights over the receiver.

=== Reconfiguring exchange theory ===
Weiner begins by re-examining Mauss' explanation for the return gift, the "spirit of the gift." The "spirit of the gift" was a translation of a Maori word, ''hau''. Weiner demonstrates that not ''all'' gifts must be returned. Only gifts that are "immoveable property" can become inalienable gifts. She further argues that inalienable possessions gain the "mana" (spirit) of their possessors, and so become associated with them. These goods are frequently produced by women, like the feather cloak above. The more prominent the woman, the more mana the object is thought to inherit. The longer the kin group can maintain the object in their possession, the more valuable it becomes; but it must also be periodically displayed to assert the group's status, and thus becomes an object of desire for outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=44–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The sibling incest taboo ===
Weiner argues that the role of women in the exchange of inalienable possessions has been seriously underestimated. [[Kinship]] theory as developed by [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], used the "[[incest taboo|sibling incest taboo]]" to argue that women themselves are [[Alliance theory|objects of exchange]] between lineage groups. Men had to find women outside their kin groups to marry hence they "lost" their sisters in order to gain wives. Weiner shows that the focus on women as wives ignores the importance of women as sisters (who are not "lost" as a result of becoming wives). Women produce inalienable possessions which they may take with them when they marry out; the inalienable possession, however, must be reclaimed by her brother after her death in order to maintain the status of the kin group. In comparing Hawaii, Samoa and the Trobriands, she argues that the more stratified a society is by ranked differences, the more important inalienable possessions produced by sisters become. The more stratified a society becomes (as in Hawaii), the closer the sibling bond ("sibling intimacy"). In these cases, women are critical to the "cosmological authentication" of inalienable possessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=66–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The defeat of hierarchy ===
A critical part of Weiner's argument is that the ability to keep inalienable possessions outside of exchange is a source of difference, and hence brings high status. The development of Polynesian kingdoms is an example. She points to the inalienable possessions of the Australian aborigines, however, to demonstrate how the creation of hierarchy can be defeated. Australian inalienable possessions are given  cosmological authentication through their religious beliefs in the [[Dreamtime|Dreaming]].

{{quote|As an [[ideology]], The Dreaming is [[Subjective idealism|immaterial]] but in another sense, The Dreaming flourishes because it consists of material and verbal possessions—myths, names, songs, ceremonies, and sacred objects inherited from one generation to the next. In this way, The Dreaming itself encompasses vast inalienable possessions that are authenticated by the very cosmology under which they are produced. These possessions created in and authenticated by The Dreaming circulate from one person or group to another in a limited way. The possibilities of transmission in the face of the canon for guardianship establish for ritual leaders a domain of authority that in certain situations leads to a formalized position of rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Weiner points out that the same gender relations of "sibling intimacy" affect the exchange of these inalienable objects. Women as sisters and women as wives provide the conduit for the gifting and return gifting of these goods, allowing the givers to build prestige. However, insofar as these inalienable possessions lose their cosmological authentication, these social hierarchies lose intergenerational longevity. Because the Dreaming itself is an inalienable possession kept secret by clan elders, it can be lost and hierarchy defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=98–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The paradox of keeping-while-giving ===
[[File:Kula bracelet.jpg|thumbnail|A Kula bracelet from the Trobriand Islands.]]
Weiner has used the term to categorize the many [[Kula ring|Kula]] valuables of the [[Trobriand]] islanders who view those objects as culturally imbued with a spiritual sense of the gift giver.  Thus, when they are transferred from one individual or group to another the objects reserve meaningful bonds associated with that of the giver and their lineage. The shell bracelets and necklaces given in exchange each have their own histories, and are thus ranked on the basis of who they have been exchanged to. There were, as well, less well known shells called ''kitomu'' which were individually owned (rather than being part of lineage history), which would be given to temporarily please a disappointed trade partner expecting a more valuable shell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=134–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kula trade was organized differently in the more hierarchical parts of the Trobriand islands. There, only chiefs were allowed to engage in Kula exchange. In hierarchical areas, individuals can earn their own kitomu shells, whereas in less hierarchical areas, they are always subject to the claims of matrilineal kin. And lastly, in the hierarchical areas, Kula necklaces and bracelets are saved for external exchange only; stone axe blades are used internally. In less hierarchical areas, exchange partners may lose their valuables to internal claims. As a result, most seek to exchange their kula valuables with chiefs, who thus become the most successful players. The chiefs have saved their Kula valuables for external trade, and external traders seek to trade with them before they lose their valuables to internal claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=137–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kula exchange is the only way for an individual to achieve local prestige without local political action. But this prestige is fleeting and does not transform into permanent differences in rank because women's participation is minor and Kula shells lack cosmological authentication. It is not Kula shells but women's cloth wealth that is connected with matrilineal ancestors. It is for this reason that women retain high prestige and authority despite the fame of male Kula exchange players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=147–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Godelier on ''keeping-for-giving and giving-for-keeping''==
[[Maurice Godelier]] has further elaborated on Annette Weiner's ideas on inalienable possessions in ''The Enigma of the Gift''. He derived two theses from Weiner, to which he adds a third.

'''First Thesis:''' As discussed above, even in a society that is dominated by a gift-giving economic and moral code, the interplay of gift and counter-gift doesn't completely dominate the social sphere, as there must be some objects which are kept and not given. These things, such as valuables, [[talismans]], knowledge, and rites, confirm  identities and their continuity over time.  Moreover, they acknowledge differences of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] of individuals or groups linked by various kinds of exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Second Thesis:'''  Women or the feminine element also exercise power by providing legitimation and redistributing  of political and religious power among groups in a society.  Godelier contends that Weiner refocuses attention on the role of women in constructing and legitimizing power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=33–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While women, as wives, are frequently lowered in status, as sisters, they frequently retain equal status to their brothers.  For example, in [[Polynesia]], the woman as a sister appears to control those goods associated with the [[sacred]], the ancestors, and the gods.

To this, Godelier adds a third thesis.

'''Third thesis:''' The social is not just the sum of alienable and inalienable goods, but is brought into existence by the difference and inter-dependence of these two spheres of exchange. Maintaining society thus requires not ''keeping-while-giving'', but "''keeping-for-giving and giving-for-keeping''."&lt;ref name="Godelier 1999 36"&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related anthropologists on exchange theory ==
*[[Emile Durkheim]] "describes how exchange involves an intensive bonding more formidable than mere economic relations.  [[Social cohesiveness]] occurs because one person is always dependent on another to achieve a feeling of completeness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This comes into being via the domain of the sacred [[ritual]] that involves communal participation even as it encompasses the moment in a higher order of sacredness.
*[[Bronisław Malinowski]] wrote ''[[Argonauts of the Western Pacific]]''.  Malinowski was a pioneer of ethnographic fieldwork in  the Trobriand Islandes and researched [[Kula ring|Kula]] exchange.  His work was later re-analyzed by Mauss and subsequently by other anthropologists.
*[[Marcel Mauss]] wrote ''[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]''.  He was a pioneer in the study of gift exchange. Mauss was concerned only with the relations formed by the circulation of things that men produce, and not with the relations that men form while they produce things. He is concerned, in particular, with why people give gifts, and why they feel the obligation to make a return.  In fact, he contended that [[inalienable right|inalienability]] is based on or legitimized by the [[belief]] that there is present in the object a power, a spirit, a spiritual reality that binds it to the giver, and which accompanies the object wherever it goes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This spirit then wishes to return to its source the original giver.
*[[Marshall Sahlins]] wrote ''Stone Age Economics''.  Sahlins disagreed with Mauss on several points and contended that "the freedom to gain at others' expense is not envisioned by the relations and forms of exchange."  Moreover, "The material flow underwrites or initiates social relations…. Persons and groups confront each other not merely as distinct interests but with the possible inclination and certain right to physically prosecute these interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sahlins|first=Marshall|title=Stone Age Economics|year=1972|publisher=Aldine de Gruyter|location=New York|pages=149–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] applauded Marcel Mauss for his efforts even as he criticized him of not perceiving that "the primary fundamental phenomena (of social life) is exchange itself."  He believed that "society is better understood in terms of [[language]] than from the standpoint of any other [[paradigm]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, he thought that [[anthropologists]] and [[ethnographers]], particularly Mauss, were becoming confused by the languages of those they ethnographically studied, resulting in obscure theories that didn't really make sense.  He advocated [[Structuralism (sociology)|structuralist]] analysis in an attempt to clear up certain confusions caused by Mauss' work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=17–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Maurice Godelier]] wrote ''The Enigma of the Gift.''  Godelier expanded on Weiner's work  by maintaining that society requires not ''keeping-while-giving'', but "''keeping-for-giving and giving-for-keeping''."&lt;ref name="Godelier 1999 36"/&gt;

== Importance ==

[[Economist]]s have often shunned the idea of pondering exactly why people want goods.&lt;ref name="Douglas1979"&gt;Douglas 1979&lt;/ref&gt; [[Good (economics)|Goods]] serve many purposes beyond what classical economists might theorize. Goods can serve as systems of [[social communication]] according to [[Mary Douglas]], a prominent anthropologist.&lt;ref name="Douglas1979"/&gt; In fact, [[anthropology]] in general is important to [[economics]] because it talks about the socio-cultural relationships in [[economy]] and economy itself as a [[cultural system]] that is not just market-based.&lt;ref name="Erem2007"&gt;Erem 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, entire industries are often based on gift giving such as the pharmaceutical industry. In addition, gift-giving plays an important role in the [[cultural development]] of how social and [[business]] relations evolve in major economies such as in the case of the Chinese.

In [[mathematics]], '''infinity plus one''' has meaning for the [[Hyperreal number|hyperreals]], and also as the number [[ω+1]] ([[omega]] plus one) in the [[ordinal number]]s and [[Surreal number#.22... and Beyond..22|surreal number]]s. 

== Mathematics ==
There are several mathematical theories which include both infinite values and addition.

* [[Cardinal number]]s are representations of sizes (cardinalities) of abstract sets, which may be [[infinite set|infinite]]. [[Cardinal addition|Addition of cardinal numbers]] is defined as the cardinality of the [[disjoint union]] of sets of given cardinalities. It can be easily shown that κ + 1 = κ for any infinite cardinal κ, as illustrated by [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]]. Moreover, if one assumes the [[axiom of choice]], then κ + λ = max { κ, λ } if at least one of κ or λ is infinite.
* [[Ordinal number]]s represent [[order type]]s of [[well-order]]ed sets. [[Ordinal addition]] is defined as the order type of the [[concatenation]] of orders. This operation is not [[commutative]]: ω + 1 is a strictly larger ordinal than ω, but 1 + ω = ω.
* [[Hyperreal number]]s are an extension of the [[real number]] system which contains infinite and [[infinitesimal number]]s. The resulting system is an [[ordered field]] thanks to the [[transfer principle#Transfer principle for the hyperreals|transfer principle]], which states that any [[first-order logic|first-order]] sentence which is true for real numbers also holds for hyperreals. Since ∀''x'': ''x'' &amp;lt; ''x'' + 1 is a first-order sentence holding for reals (as it follows from the ordered field axioms), adding one to an infinite hyperreal produces infinity. The same will hold for any [[non-Archimedean ordered field]].
* [[Surreal number]]s also extend real numbers to a system which satisfies the axioms of an [[ordered field]], and so addition behaves similarly to hyperreals, in that ''x'' &amp;lt; ''x'' + 1 for all surreals ''x''. In this system, one may find elements corresponding to infinite ordinals; however, surreal addition and multiplication correspond not to the usual ordinal operations, but to the [[ordinal arithmetic#Natural operations|natural sum and natural product]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19808">'''Intermediate scrutiny''', in [[United States constitutional law|U.S. constitutional law]], is the second level of deciding issues using [[judicial review]].  The other levels are typically referred to as [[rational basis review]] (least rigorous) and [[strict scrutiny]] (most rigorous).

In order to overcome the intermediate scrutiny test, it must be shown that the law or policy being challenged furthers an important government interest by means that are substantially related to that interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/intermediate_scrutiny |title=Intermediate Scrutiny - Legal Information Institute |publisher=topics.law.cornell.edu |date=January 15, 2014 |accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''Wengler v. Druggists Mutual Ins. Co.'', 446 U.S. 142, 150 &lt;/ref&gt; 

Intermediate scrutiny may be contrasted with "[[strict scrutiny]]", the higher standard of review that requires narrowly tailored and least restrictive means to further a compelling governmental interest, and "[[rational basis review]]", a lower standard of review that requires the law or policy be rationally related to an legitimate government interest. 

This approach is most often employed in reviewing limits on commercial speech, content-neutral regulations of speech, and state actions discriminating on the basis of sex.

==Laws subject to Equal Protection scrutiny==

Constitutional Equal Protection analysis applies not only to challenges against the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], but also to [[State Government|state]] and [[local government]]s.  Although the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause applies only to state and local governments, the United States Supreme Court has implied an Equal Protection limitation on the federal government through a process known as "[[reverse incorporation]]."  As the Fourteenth Amendment applies directly to the states, the incorporation process was unnecessary to hold this restriction against state and local governments.  Equal Protection analysis also applies to both [[legislature|legislative]] and [[Executive (government)|executive]] action regardless if the action is of a [[substantive due process|substantive]] or [[procedural due process|procedural]] nature.  Judicially crafted ([[common law]]) rules are also valid only if they conform to the requirements of Equal Protection.  See, e.g., ''Reed v. Campbell'', 476 U.S. 852 (1986).&lt;ref&gt;In ''Reed'', a judicially crafted time window for filing was applicable only to illegitimate persons and was scrutinized under intermediate Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection standard and struck down.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex-based classifications==
In the context of sex-based classifications, intermediate scrutiny applies to [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] challenges of [[Equal protection clause|equal protection]] and [[discrimination]].

An example of a court using intermediate scrutiny came in ''[[Craig v. Boren]]'', 429 U.S. 190 (1976), which was the first case in the [[United States Supreme Court]] which determined that statutory or administrative sex-based classifications were subject to an intermediate standard of [[judicial review]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.georgetown.edu/glh/markowitz.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan]]'' in 1982, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled  that the burden is on the proponent of the discrimination to establish an "exceedingly persuasive justification" for sex-based classification to be valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=linderd |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/missu.html |title=Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan |publisher=law.umkc.edu |date=July 1, 1982 |accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, the court applied intermediate scrutiny in a way that is closer to [[strict scrutiny]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/intermediate-scrutiny |title=Intermediate scrutiny |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in recent decisions the Court has preferred the term "exacting scrutiny" when referring to the intermediate level of Equal Protection analysis.  For example the court applied similar exacting intermediate scrutiny when ruling on sex-based classifications in both ''[[J.E.B. v. Alabama]]'' (concerning specific strikes against male jurors during jury composition) and ''[[United States v. Virginia]]'' (concerning male-only admission to the Virginia Military Institute).

In ''[[Glenn v. Brumby]]'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] held that firing based on [[transgender]] status was a form of sex discrimination, and therefore subject to intermediate scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://verdict.justia.com/2012/03/19/sex-discrimination-claims-under-title-vii-and-the-equal-protection-clause|title=Sex Discrimination Claims Under Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause:|last=Kemp|first=David S.|date=March 19, 2012|work=Verdict|publisher=Justia|accessdate=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illegitimacy==

Restrictions based on [[illegitimacy]] are also subjected to intermediate scrutiny in the Equal Protection context.&lt;ref name="Gerstmann1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gerstmann|first=Evan|title=The Constitutional Underclass: Gays, Lesbians, and the Failure of Class-Based Equal Protection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cB_kFqFzYvQC&amp;pg=PA53|accessdate=December 29, 2012|date=April 1, 1999|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226288598|pages=53–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weisberg2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weisberg|first=D. Kelly|title=Family Law: Aspen Roadmap Law Course Outline|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BelQvCiJGU8C&amp;pg=PA58|accessdate=December 29, 2012|date=April 8, 2008|publisher=Aspen Publishers Online|isbn=9780735572256|pages=58–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts have found such scrutiny necessary for a number of reasons.  Rationally, imposing legal burdens on an illegitimate person in order to express disapproval of the conduct of her parents is illogical, unjust, and contrary to the fundamental principle that legal burdens should have some relationship to individual wrongdoing.  Like race or gender, the court has stressed that an illegitimate person's status of birth is a condition over which she has no control, and it has no bearing on her ability or willingness to contribute to society.  In applying increasingly exacting intermediate scrutiny, the courts have noted that illegitimate persons are a stigmatized minority, are vastly outnumbered politically, and are the target of long-standing and continuing invidious legal discrimination.  For all these reasons, exacting constitutional scrutiny is mandated under the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

An additional ground for heightening scrutiny of illegitimacy-based discriminatory statutes occurs whenever such statutes involve sex discrimination (as they commonly do).  Following a sweep of legislative changes in almost every state in the early nineteenth century all non-marital children were legitimated as to their mothers.  Each such child remained illegitimate as to her male parent, only.  This gender-based classification disadvantaged male parents and privileged female parents in their fundamental familial relationship to their child.  Such gender discrimination was held an additional grounds for intermediate scrutiny of statutory denial of the father-child relationship in cases such as ''[[Caban v. Mohammed]]'', 441 U.S. 380 (1979).

==Sexual orientation==
Courts have been reluctant to apply intermediate scrutiny to cases centered around sexual orientation. For instance, in ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'' 517 US 620 (1996), which struck down an amendment to the [[Colorado Constitution]] that invalidated legal protections based on sexual orientation, the [[United States Supreme Court]] held that the amendment violated the Equal Protection Clause because the amendment was motivated by a bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group, which is never a legitimate governmental interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

In ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', 539 U.S. 558 (2003), the U.S. Supreme Court struck down anti-sodomy laws as unconstitutional, explicitly overturning its earlier ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'', 478 U.S. 186 (1986) decision, but did not specify the level of scrutiny it applied. In ''[[Lofton v. Secretary of the Department of Children &amp; Family Services]]'', 358 F.3d 804 (11th Cir. 2004), the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] explicitly held that ''Lawrence'' did not apply strict scrutiny.  However, in 2008, the [[California Supreme Court]] adopted the [[strict scrutiny]] standard for state laws that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation in the case ''[[In re Marriage Cases]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Abigail Perkiss |url=http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2013/01/defining-protected-classes-same-sex-marriage-and-judicial-scrutiny/ |title=Defining protected classes: Same-sex marriage and judicial scrutiny |publisher=blog.constitutioncenter.org |accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 18, 2012, the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] became the first federal appeals court, in ''[[Windsor v. United States]]'', to hold that laws that classify people based on [[sexual orientation]] should be subject to intermediate scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weiss|first=Debra Cassens|title=2nd Circuit Rules for Surviving Gay Spouse, Says DOMA Violates Equal Protection Clause|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/2nd_circuit_rules_for_surviving_gay_spouse_seeking_estate_tax_deduction_in_/|accessdate=October 18, 2012|newspaper=ABA Journal|date=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2ndCir&gt;{{cite web|title=Windsor v.

On January 21, 2014, the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled in ''SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Abbott Laboratories'' that  "classifications based on sexual orientation are subject to heightened scrutiny", making it the second appellate court to do so.&lt;ref name=9thCir&gt;{{cite web|title=''SmithKline Beecham Corp. v.

==Free speech==
There are two types of laws affecting "free speech" among United States citizens:  content-based and content-neutral.  In the free speech context, intermediate scrutiny is the test or standard of review that courts apply when analyzing content-neutral speech versus content-based speech. Content-based speech is reviewed under strict scrutiny in which courts evaluate the value of the subject matter or the content of the communication.&lt;ref&gt;United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 813 and 832 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 131 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;  Content-neutral laws are evaluated by the nature and scope of the speech regarding the time, place and manner of communication.  Content-neutral speech is reviewed under intermediate scrutiny versus strict scrutiny because this speech is only restricted by the way in which the information is communicated; not the information itself.  In 1968, ''[[United States v. O'Brien]]'' established a four-factor test to determine whether restricting content-neutral speech is constitutional:  (1) Is restriction within the constitutional power of government? (2) Does restriction further important or substantial governmental interest? (3) Is the governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression? (4) Is the restriction narrowly tailored &amp;ndash; no greater than necessary?  Later, a fifth factor was added in ''[[Ladue v. Gilleo]]'', 512 U.S. 43 (1994): (5) whether the restriction leaves open ample opportunities of communication.

When deciding if a restriction is narrowly tailored, courts consider the setting of the communication. Setting has two divisions:  public forum and non- public forum.  In a public forum people have a right to express themselves however, not in a non-public forum.  ''[[Adderley v. Florida]]'', 385 U.S. 39 (1966) held that freedom of speech may be limited in a jailhouse because a jailhouse is not a public forum therefore speech is subject to restriction.  The court in Adderley v. Florida used the [[rational basis]] test standard of review even though the law was content neutral because a jailhouse is a non-public forum.

''[[Ward v. Rock Against Racism]]'', 491 U.S. 781 (1989) held that a city's restriction on loud music volume controlled by equipment and technicians is constitutional because it is narrowly tailored.  ''[[Madsen v. Women's Health Center]]'', 512 U.S. 753 (1994) upheld part of an injunction restricting abortion protesters from entering the "buffer zone" around the abortion clinic because this was the least restrictive means and still gave protestors ample opportunity to communicate outside the buffer zone on the sidewalk, which was a public forum. The court used the [[strict scrutiny]] standard of review in ''Madsen''. 

Intermediate scrutiny applies to regulation that does not directly target speech but has a substantial impact on a particular message.  It applies to [[time, place, and manner]] restrictions on speech, for example, with the additional requirement of "adequate alternative channels of communication."  In other words, if restricting the time, place, or manner of speech means that speech cannot take place at all, the regulation fails intermediate scrutiny.  It has been used in "erogenous zoning" cases such as ''[[Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.]]'', 475 U.S. 41 (1986), that limit the concentration or require concentration of certain types of establishments.  It has also been used for other types of content-neutral regulation, as well as for content-neutral speech compulsion.  Intermediate scrutiny also applies to regulation of commercial speech, as long as the state interests in regulating relate to fair bargaining.  Regulations for other reasons, such as protection of children, are subject to strict scrutiny.

==Gun control==
Various federal and state laws restricting access to guns by certain people, laws that restrict or ban the acquisition or ownership of certain types of firearms by the general population, and laws that restrict the [[Concealed Carry in the United States|carrying of firearms by private citizens in public places]] have largely been upheld on the basis of intermediate scrutiny.  In many of these cases, such laws have survived intermediate scrutiny on the basis that the government is furthering an "important interest in public safety" in enacting laws that constrain the individual [[right to keep and bear arms]] under the [[Second Amendment of the United States Constitution]].  The [[United States Supreme Court]] in its 2008 ''District of Columbia v. Heller'' decision confirmed that the right to "keep and bear arms" is an individual right, but also caveated that the Second Amendment is not necessarily "a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner."

However, outright bans on acquiring, possessing and carrying any and all types of firearms in [[Illinois]], the [[District of Columbia]] and in various cities and counties (notably [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] and [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]) have been struck down, failing to survive intermediate scrutiny where the courts determined that the government overreached in furthering its interest in public safety by completely banning private citizens from obtaining or possessing firearms or carrying firearms in public.

The Supreme Court has yet to clarify the exact level of scrutiny to be applied to gun control laws, though in its decision in ''D.C. v. Heller'', the Court identified a broad category of laws deemed presumptively constitutional.

=="Intermediate" versus "heightened"==
The phrase "heightened scrutiny" has been used interchangeably with "intermediate scrutiny" but it is unclear if the two are actually legally interchangeable. In ''[[Witt v. Department of the Air Force]]'', 527 F.3d 806 (9th Cir. 2008), the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] ruled that the law commonly known as "don't ask, don't tell" (DADT) was subject to "heightened" scrutiny based on its analysis of ''Lawrence''. The court articulated a three-pronged test for heightened scrutiny. To pass, the law "must advance an important governmental interest, the intrusion must significantly further that interest, and the intrusion must be necessary to further that interest". This differs from the "substantially related to important governmental interests" two-prong test for "intermediate" scrutiny. As the [[Obama administration]] chose not to appeal ''Witt'' to the Supreme Court, it is binding precedent on the Ninth Circuit and it has been cited as such in ''[[Log Cabin Republicans v. United States]]'' (''LCR''), another case challenging the constitutionality of DADT. The District court in ''LCR'' applied the three-pronged test in ruling DADT unconstitutional. The administration appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit. In December 2010 DADT was legislatively repealed. On September 29, 2011, the Ninth Circuit vacated the district court's decision, ruling that the legislative repeal of "don't ask, don't tell" rendered the case [[Mootness|moot]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/29/us-usa-gays-military-idUSTRE78S5NE20110929?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=domesticNews |title=U.S. court vacates ruling on gays in military |publisher=Reuters |first=Dan |last=Levine |date=September 29, 2011 |accessdate=October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Obama administration, in its refusal to defend several lawsuits challenging Section 3 of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], argued that "heightened" scrutiny is the appropriate level of scrutiny to apply to statutes that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.

==History==
The English expression "a [[Birmingham]] [[screwdriver]]" meaning a hammer, references the habit of using the one tool for all purposes, and predates both Kaplan and Maslow by at least a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Jonathon|title=Dictionary of Slang|year=1998|publisher=Cassell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868, a London periodical, ''[[Once A Week (magazine)|Once a Week]]'', contained this observation: "Give a boy a hammer and chisel; show him how to use them; at once he begins to hack the doorposts, to take off the corners of shutter and window frames, until you teach him a better use for them, and how to keep his activity within bounds."&lt;ref name="Quote Investigator"/&gt;

==Abraham Kaplan==
The first recorded statement of the concept was [[Abraham Kaplan]]'s, in 1964: "I call it ''the law of the instrument,'' and it may be formulated as follows: Give a small boy a hammer, and he will find that everything he encounters needs pounding."&lt;ref&gt;

In February 1962, [[Abraham Kaplan]], then a Professor of Philosophy, gave a banquet speech at a conference of the [[American Educational Research Association]] that was being held at [[UCLA]]. An article in the June 1962 issue of the ''Journal of Medical Education'' stated that "the highlight of the 3-day meeting ... was to be found in Kaplan's comment on the choice of methods for research. He urged that scientists exercise good judgment in the selection of appropriate methods for their research. Because certain methods happen to be handy, or a given individual has been trained to use a specific method, is no assurance that the method is appropriate for all problems. He cited Kaplan’s Law of the Instrument: 'Give a boy a hammer and everything he meets has to be pounded.{{'"}}

In ''The Conduct of Inquiry: Methodology for Behavioral Science'' (1964), Kaplan again mentioned the law of the instrument saying, "It comes as no particular surprise to discover that a scientist formulates problems in a way which requires for their solution just those techniques in which he himself is especially skilled." And in a 1964 article for ''[[The Library Quarterly]]'', he again cited the law and commented: "We tend to formulate our problems in such a way as to make it seem that the solutions to those problems demand precisely what we already happen to have at hand."&lt;ref name="Quote Investigator"&gt;{{cite web|title=If Your Only Tool Is a Hammer Then Every Problem Looks Like a Nail|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/05/08/hammer-nail/|website=Quote Investigator|publisher=Quote Investigator|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tomkins and Colby==

In a 1963 essay collection, ''Computer Simulation of Personality: Frontier of Psychological Theory'', [[Silvan Tomkins]] wrote about "the tendency of jobs to be adapted to tools, rather than adapting tools to jobs". He wrote: "If one has a hammer one tends to look for nails, and if one has a computer with a storage capacity, but no feelings, one is more likely to concern oneself with remembering and with problem solving than with loving and hating." In the same book, [[Kenneth Mark Colby]] explicitly cited the law, writing: "The First Law of the Instrument states that if you give a boy a hammer, he suddenly finds that everything needs pounding. The computer program may be our current hammer, but it must be tried. One cannot decide from purely armchair considerations whether or not it will be of any value."&lt;ref name="Quote Investigator"/&gt;

==Abraham Maslow==

''Maslow's hammer,'' popularly phrased as "[[wikt:if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail|if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail]]" and variants thereof, is from Abraham Maslow's ''The Psychology of Science'', published in 1966. [[Abraham Maslow]] wrote: "I remember seeing an elaborate and complicated automatic washing machine for automobiles that did a beautiful job of washing them. But it could do only that, and everything else that got into its clutches was treated as if it were an automobile to be washed. I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail."&lt;ref name="Quote Investigator"/&gt;&lt;ref name=maslow66&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Robert Kagan==
In his 2003 book, ''[[Of Paradise and Power]]'', historian [[Robert Kagan]] suggested a corollary to the law: "When you don't have a hammer, you don't want anything to look like a nail." According to Kagan, the corollary explains the difference in views on the use of military force the United States and Europe have held since the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Robert Kagan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kagan|first1=Robert|title=Of Paradise and Power: America and Europe in the New World Order|date=January 2004|publisher=Vintage Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75GLDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Robert%20Kagan%22%20%22When%20you%20don't%20have%20a%20hammer%2C%20you%20don't%20want%20anything%20to%20look%20like%20a%20nail.%22|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lee Loevinger==
In 1967, [[Lee Loevinger]] of the [[Federal Communications Commission]] dubbed the law "Loevinger's law of irresistible use", and applied it to government: "The political science analogue is that if there is a government agency, this proves something needs regulating."

In 1984, investor [[Warren Buffett]] criticized academic studies of financial markets that made use of inappropriate mathematical approaches: "It isn't necessarily because such studies have any utility; it's simply that the data are there and academicians have worked hard to learn the mathematical skills needed to manipulate them. Once these skills are acquired, it seems sinful not to use them, even if the usage has no utility or negative utility. As a friend said, to a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail."&lt;ref name="Quote Investigator"/&gt;

==Manifestations==
===Psychiatry===

One application the law of the instrument has been observed in is the prescribing usage of [[anti-psychotic]] drugs. During Maslow's era, the only medicines available for psychiatric patients were the anti-psychotics [[stelazine]] and [[thorazine]], so it was often the case that other  mental illnesses were treated as if they were [[psychoses]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Computer programming===
The notion of a ''golden hammer,'' "a familiar technology or concept applied obsessively to many software problems", was introduced into [[information technology]] literature in 1998 as an [[anti-pattern]]: a programming practice to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = AntiPatterns: Refactoring Software, Architectures, and Projects in Crisis
 |author1=William J. Brown |author2=Raphael C. Malveau |author3=Hays W. "Skip" McCormick |author4=Thomas J. Mowbray | publisher = Wiley

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Software developer José M. Gilgado has written that the law is still relevant in the 21st century and is highly applicable to software development. Many times software developers, he observed, "tend to use the same known tools to do a completely new different project with new constraints". He blamed this on "the [[comfort zone]] state where you don't change anything to avoid risk. The problem with using the same tools every time you can is that you don't have enough arguments to make a choice because you have nothing to compare to and is limiting your knowledge." The solution is "to keep looking for the best possible choice, even if we aren't very familiar with it". This includes using a computer language with which one is unfamiliar. He noted that the product [[RubyMotion]] enables developers to "wrap" unknown computer languages in a familiar computer language and thus avoid having to learn them. But Gilgado found this approach inadvisable, because it reinforces the habit of avoiding new tools.&lt;ref name="Jose M Dev"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gilgado|first1=José|title=Avoiding the law of the instrument|url=http://josemdev.com/articles/avoiding-the-law-of-the-instrument/|website=Jose M Dev|publisher=Jose M Dev|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
One observer stated in 2016 that the law of the instrument may be "the least discussed law when talking about education", but is "the most important to warn for in educational discussions". He asked: "How many times do you read: this tool will change everything in education? We know that it won’t, but most of the time the person expressing this is really convinced of his hammer." Some educators say: "let’s teach all children how to code".&lt;ref name="The Economy of Meaning"&gt;{{cite web|title=The "Law of the instrument"|url=https://theeconomyofmeaning.com/2016/12/18/the-law-of-the-instrument/|website=The Economy of Meaning|publisher=The Economy of Meaning|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8834">'''Logical truth''' is one of the most fundamental [[concept]]s in [[logic]], and there are different theories on its nature. A logical truth is a [[Statement (logic)|statement]] which is [[truth|true]], and remains true under all [[interpretation (logic)|reinterpretations]] of its components other than its [[logical constant]]s. It is a type of [[Analytic–synthetic distinction|analytic statement]]. All of [[philosophical logic]] can be thought of as providing accounts of the nature of logical truth, as well as [[logical consequence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine, Willard Van Orman]], ''Philosophy of logic''&lt;/ref&gt;

Logical truths (including [[Tautology (logic)|tautologies]]) are truths which are considered to be '''necessarily true'''. This is to say that they are considered to be such that they could not be untrue and no situation could arise which would cause us to reject a logical truth.  It must be true in every sense of intuition, practices, and bodies of beliefs. However, it is not universally agreed that there are any statements which are ''necessarily'' true.

A logical truth is considered by some philosophers to be a statement which is true in all [[possible world]]s. This is contrasted with [[fact]]s (which may also be referred to as ''contingent claims'' or ''synthetic claims'') which are true in ''this'' world, as it has historically unfolded, but which is not true in at least one possible world, as it might have unfolded. The [[proposition]] "If p and q, then p" and the proposition "All married people are married" are logical truths because they are true due to their inherent structure and not because of any facts of the world. 
Later, with the rise of formal logic a logical truth was considered to be a statement which is true under all possible interpretations.

The existence of logical truths has been put forward by [[rationalist]] philosophers as an objection to [[empiricism]] because they hold that it is impossible to account for our [[knowledge]] of logical truths on empiricist grounds. Empiricists commonly respond to this objection by arguing that logical truths (which they usually deem to be mere tautologies), are analytic and thus do not purport to describe the world.

== Logical truths and analytic truths ==
{{Main|Analytic–synthetic distinction}}

Logical truths, being analytic statements, do not contain any information about any matters of [[fact]]. Other than logical truths, there is also a second class of analytic statements, typified by "no bachelor is married". The characteristic of such a statement is that it can be turned into a logical truth by substituting synonyms for synonyms ''[[salva veritate]]''. "No bachelor is married" can be turned into "no unmarried man is married" by substituting "unmarried man" for its synonym "bachelor".

In his essay [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]], the philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]] called into question the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements. It was this second class of analytic statements that caused him to note that the concept of analyticity itself stands in need of clarification, because it seems to depend on the concept of [[synonym]]y, which stands in need of clarification. In his conclusion, Quine rejects that logical truths are necessary truths. Instead he posits that the truth-value of any statement can be changed, including logical truths, given a re-evaluation of the truth-values of every other statement in one's complete theory.

== Truth values and tautologies ==
{{Main|Tautology (logic)}}

Considering different [[interpretation (logic)|interpretations]] of the same statement leads to the notion of [[truth value]]. The simplest approach to truth values means that the statement may be "true" in one case, but [[false (logic)|"false"]]&lt;!-- not yet an article, but ought to be.  please, do not remove the link --&gt; in another. In one sense of the term "tautology", it is any type of [[well-formed formula|formula]] or [[proposition]] which turns out to be true under any possible interpretation of its terms (may also be called a [[Valuation (logic)|valuation]] or assignment depending upon the context). This is synonymous to logical truth.

However, the term "tautology" is also commonly used to refer to what could more specifically be called [[Truth function|truth-functional]] tautologies. Whereas a tautology or logical truth is true solely because of the logical terms it contains in general (e.g. "[[Universal quantification|every]]", "[[Existential quantification|some]]", and "is"), a truth-functional tautology is true because of the logical terms it contains which are [[logical connective]]s (e.g. "[[logical disjunction|or]]", "[[logical conjunction|and]]", and "[[joint denial|nor]]"). Not all logical truths are tautologies of such a kind.

== Logical truth and logical constants ==
{{Main|Logical constant}}

Logical constants, including [[logical connective]]s and [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]], can all be reduced conceptually to logical truth. For instance, two statements or more are [[Logical NAND|logically incompatible]] ''[[if and only if|if, and only if]]'' their [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] is logically false. One statement [[Logical implication|logically implies]] another when it is logically incompatible with the [[negation]] of the other. A statement is logically true if, and only if its opposite is logically false.  The opposite statements must contradict one another.  In this way all logical connectives can be expressed in terms of preserving logical truth.  The logical form of a sentence is determined by its semantic or syntactic structure and by the placement of logical constants.  Logical constants determine whether a statement is a logical truth when they are combined with a language that limits its meaning.  Therefore, until it is determined how to make a distinction between all logical constants regardless of their language, it is impossible to know the complete truth of a statement or argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-constants/|title=Logical Constants|last=MacFarlane|first=J.|date=May 16, 2005|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logical truth and rules of inference ==

The concept of logical truth is closely connected to the concept of a [[rule of inference]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A. J. Ayer|Alfred Ayer]], ''[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logical truth and logical positivism ==

[[Logical positivism]] was a movement in the 20th century and was followed to a great extent in Europe and the United States.  It is a structured method of determining how valid the knowledge is.  It introduced mathematics and the natural sciences into the field of philosophy.  It is also known as scientific empiricism.  Logical positivism considers philosophy as an analytical inquiry. Philosophy was deciphered as an activity rather than a theory.  Logical positivists worked to explain the language of science by showing that scientific theories could be broken down to logical truths along with the experience of the five senses.  The concepts created in this movement are very closely followed today in the West. Logical positivism was a way to decipher whether a statement was truly a logical truth by means of relating it to a scientific theory or mathematics.  It determined the validity of the statement as well as gave it the rank of a logical truth or a false truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2016|title=Logical Positivism|url=|journal=Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-classical logics ==

{{Main|Non-classical logic}}

Non-classical logic is the name given to [[formal system]]s which differ in a significant way from standard logical systems such as [[Propositional logic|propositional]] and [[predicate logic]]. There are several ways in which this is done, including by way of extensions, deviations, and variations. The aim of these departures is to make it possible to construct different models of [[logical consequence]] and logical truth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Sider]], ''Logic for philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Magnetic complex reluctance''' ([[SI Unit]]: [[Henry (unit)|H]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) is a measurement of a passive [[magnetic circuit]] (or element within that circuit) dependent on sinusoidal magnetomotive force ([[SI Unit]]: [[Ampere-turn|At]]·[[Weber (unit)|Wb]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and sinusoidal [[magnetic flux]] ([[SI Unit]]: [[Tesla (unit)|T]]·[[Metre|m]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and this is determined by deriving the ratio of their complex ''effective'' amplitudes.[Ref. 1-3]

:&lt;math&gt;Z_\mu = \frac{\dot N}{\dot \Phi} = \frac{\dot {N}_m}{\dot {\Phi}_m} = z_\mu e^{j\phi}&lt;/math&gt;

As seen above, magnetic complex reluctance is a [[phasor]] represented as ''uppercase Z mu'' where:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot {N}_m&lt;/math&gt; represent the magnetomotive force (complex effective amplitude)
:&lt;math&gt;\dot \Phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot {\Phi}_m&lt;/math&gt; represent the magnetic flux (complex effective amplitude)
:&lt;math&gt;z_\mu&lt;/math&gt;, ''lowercase z mu'', is the real part of magnetic complex reluctance

The "lossless" [[magnetic reluctance]], ''lowercase z mu'', is equal to the [[absolute value#Complex numbers|absolute value]] (modulus) of the magnetic complex reluctance. The argument distinguishing the "lossy" magnetic complex reluctance from the "lossless" magnetic reluctance is equal to the natural number &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; raised to a power equal to:
:&lt;math&gt;j\phi = j\left(\beta - \alpha\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*&lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is the imaginary number
*&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the phase of the magnetomotive force
*&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the phase of the magnetic flux
*&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the phase difference

The "lossy" magnetic complex reluctance represents a magnetic circuit element's resistance to not only magnetic flux but also to ''changes'' in magnetic flux. When applied to harmonic regimes, this formality is similar to [[Ohm's Law]] in ideal AC circuits. In magnetic circuits, magnetic complex reluctance is equal to:
:&lt;math&gt;Z_\mu = \frac{1}{\dot {\mu} \mu_0}\frac{l}{S}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*&lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the circuit element
*&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the cross-section of the circuit element
*&lt;math&gt;\dot {\mu} \mu_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[permeability (electromagnetism)#Complex permeability|complex magnetic permeability]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24603">'''Manic Pixie Dream Girl''' ('''MPDG''') is a [[stock character]] type in [[films]]. Film critic [[Nathan Rabin]], who coined the term after observing [[Kirsten Dunst]]'s character in ''[[Elizabethtown (film)|Elizabethtown]]'' (2005), said that the MPDG "exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive [[Screenwriter|writer]]-[[Film director|directors]] to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures."&lt;ref name="rabin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/my-year-of-flops-case-file-1-elizabethtown-the-bat,15577/ |title=My Year Of Flops, Case File 1: ''Elizabethtown'': The Bataan Death March of Whimsy |last=Rabin |first=Nathan |authorlink=Nathan Rabin |date=January 25, 2007 |website=[[The A.V.

The Manic Pixie Dream Girl has been compared to another stock character, the [[Magical Negro]], a [[black people|black]] character who seems to exist only to provide spiritual or mystical help to the [[White savior narrative in film|white savior protagonist]]. In both cases, the stock character has no discernible inner life, and usually only exists to provide the protagonist some important life lessons.&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bowman |first1=Donna |last2=Gillette |first2=Amelie |last3=Hyden |first3=Steven |last4=Murray |first4=Noel |last5=Pierce |first5=Leonard |last6=Rabin |first6=Nathan |date=August 4, 2008 |title=Wild things: 16 films featuring Manic Pixie Dream Girls |website=[[The A.V.

==Examples==
MPDGs are usually [[static characters]] who have [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] personality quirks and are unabashedly girlish. They invariably serve as the [[romantic interest]] for a (most often brooding or depressed) male [[protagonist]]. Examples of an MPDG are described below:
*An example is [[Natalie Portman]]'s character in the movie ''[[Garden State (film)|Garden State]]'' (2004), written and directed by [[Zach Braff]].&lt;ref name="rabin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="welker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2008/08/07/manic_pixie/ |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111008063922/http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2008/08/07/manic_pixie/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 8, 2011 |title=The Natalie Portman problem |last=Berman |first=Judy |date=August 7, 2008 |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |accessdate=January 5, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of ''Garden State'', [[Roger Ebert]] also described this kind of rather unbelievable "movie creature" as "completely available" and "absolutely desirable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Garden State |first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert |website=Rogerebert.com |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/garden-state-2004 |date=August 6, 2004 |accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' points to [[Katharine Hepburn]]'s character in ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938) as one of the earliest examples of the archetype.&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; 
*The'' [[Filmspotting]]'' podcast created a list of Top Five Manic Pixie Dream Girls; Nathan Rabin appeared as a guest and created his own, separate list of MPDGs.&lt;ref name="filmspotting"/&gt;

===Counterexamples===
*The titular character of ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977) is often called a MPDG but is arguably not one, as she has her own goals independent of the male lead.{{r|kelly20130109}}
*[[Kate Winslet]]'s character Clementine in ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'' (2004) acknowledges the trope of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl and rejects the type, in a remark to [[Jim Carrey]]'s Joel: "Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive. But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's lookin' for my own peace of mind; don't assign me yours.”&lt;ref name="filmspotting"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmspotting.net/reviews/624-fs-326-127-hours-top-5-manic-pixie-dream-girls.html |title=Top Five Manic Pixie Dream Girls |website=Filmspotting |date=November 19, 2010 |accessdate=June 26, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617034840/http://www.filmspotting.net/reviews/624-fs-326-127-hours-top-5-manic-pixie-dream-girls.html |archivedate=June 17, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Although [[Zooey Deschanel]]'s Summer in ''[[500 Days of Summer]]'' (2009) is often identified as a MPDG, the movie can be seen as a deconstruction of the trope because it shows the dangers of idealising women as things, rather than respecting them as real people with their own complex outlooks. Director [[Marc Webb]] stated, "Yes, Summer has elements of the manic pixie dream girl&amp;nbsp;– she is an immature view of a woman. She's Tom's view of a woman. He doesn't see her complexity and the consequence for him is heartbreak. In Tom's eyes, Summer is perfection, but perfection has no depth. Summer's not a girl, she's a phase."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/16/500-days-of-summer |title="'Is there such a thing as "the one" - and what happens if you lose her?" |newspaper=The Guardian |last=Wiseman |first=Eva |date=August 16, 2009 |accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Eve, the lead character of [[Stuart Murdoch (musician)|Stuart Murdoch]]'s [[musical film]], ''[[God Help the Girl (film)|God Help the Girl]]'' (2014), has also been noted as a subversion of the trope, with actress [[Emily Browning]] approaching the character as "the anti-manic pixie dream girl" and describing her as having "her own inner life" and being "incredibly self-absorbed; [...] Olly wants her to be his muse and she's like, 'No, I'm not having that. I'm gonna go do my own shit.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.luckymag.com/style/2014/09/emily-browning-god-help-the-girl |first=Laura |last=Morgan |title=Emily Browning On Playing An 'Anti-Manic Pixie Dream Girl' In The New Pop Musical God Help The Girl |website=Lucky Magazine |date=October 13, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013042032/http://www.luckymag.com/style/2014/09/emily-browning-god-help-the-girl |archivedate=October 13, 2014 |accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/01/sundance-stuart-murdoch-belle-and-sebastian-god-help-the-girl.html |first=Jada |last=Juan |title=Sundance: Belle and Sebastian Front Man Stuart Murdoch's Glasgow Musical |publisher=[[Vulture.com]] |date=January 26, 2014 |accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and debate==
In an interview with Vulture, the entertainment section of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', about her film ''[[Ruby Sparks]]'', actress and screenwriter [[Zoe Kazan]] criticized the term as reductive, [[diminutive]], and [[misogynistic]]. She disagreed that Hepburn's character in ''Bringing Up Baby'' is a MPDG: "I think that to lump together all individual, original quirky women under that rubric is to erase all difference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/07/zoe-kazan-ruby-sparks-interview.html |title=Zoe Kazan on Writing ''Ruby Sparks'' and Why You Should Never Call Her a 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' |first=Patti |last=Greco |publisher=Vulture |date=July 23, 2012 |accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a December 2012 video, [[AllMovie]] critic Cammila Collar embraced the term as an effective description of one-dimensional female characters who only seek the happiness of the male protagonist, and who do not deal with any complex issues of their own. The pejorative use of the term, then, is mainly directed at writers who do not give these female characters more to do than bolster the spirits of their male partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMsrwfbyxMo |title=Semantic Breakdown: The Manic Pixie Dream Bitch |work=[[YouTube]] |date=December 14, 2012 |accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''{{'}}s Aisha Harris posited that "critiques of the MPDG may have become more common than the archetype itself", suggesting that filmmakers had been forced to become "self-aware about such characters" in the years since Rabin's coining of the phrase and that the trope had largely disappeared from film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Harris |first=Aisha |title=Is the Manic Pixie Dream Girl Dead? |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/12/05/manic_pixie_prostitute_video_is_the_latest_critique_of_the_manic_pixie_dream.html |website=Slate |publisher=The Slate Group |date=December 5, 2012 |accessdate=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Kat Stoeffel, for ''[[New York (magazine)|The Cut]]'', argued that the term itself had become sexist, citing her opinion that "it was levied, criminally at [[Diane Keaton]] in ''[[Annie Hall]]'' and [[Zooey Deschanel]], the actual person. ''How could a real person's defining trait be a lack of interior life?"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stoeffel |first=Kat |title=The 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' Has Died |url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/07/manic-pixie-dream-girl-has-died.html |website=The Cut |publisher=New York Media LLC. |accessdate=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

Similar sentiments were elucidated by Monika Bartyzel for ''[[The Week]]'' in April 2013, who wrote "this once-useful piece of critical shorthand has devolved into laziness and sexism". Bartyzel argues that "[The term] 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' was useful when it commented on the superficiality of female characterizations in male dominated journeys, but it has since devolved into a pejorative way to deride unique women in fiction and reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bartyzel |first=Monika |title=Girls on Film: Why it's time to retire the term 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' |url=http://theweek.com/article/index/243265/girls-on-film-why-its-time-to-retire-the-term-manic-pixie-dream-girl |website=The Week |publisher=The Week Publications, Inc. |date=April 26, 2013 |accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retraction of the term==
In July 2014, for ''Salon'', Rabin prompted a retraction of the term "Manic Pixie Dream Girl". He argued that in "giving an idea a fuzzy definition", he inadvertently gave the phrase power it was not intended to have. The trope's popularity, Rabin suggested, led to discussions of a more precise definition, a reduction of the critic's all-encompassing classification of MPDG. While he coined the term to expose the sexist implications in modern culture, the "phrase was increasingly accused of being sexist itself". Backlash occurred when many well-loved female characters were placed under this trope. In response, Rabin suggested that nuanced characters cannot be classified in such a restricted nature, and thus he apologized to pop culture for "creating this unstoppable monster".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2014/07/15/im_sorry_for_coining_the_phrase_manic_pixie_dream_girl/ |date=July 15, 2014 |title=I'm sorry for coining the phrase "Manic Pixie Dream Girl": In 2007, I invented the term in a review. Then I watched in queasy disbelief as it seemed to take over pop culture |first=Nathan |last=Rabin |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manic Pixie Dream Boy==
Recently there has been discussion of a male version of this trope, the Manic Pixie Dream Boy or Manic Pixie Dream Guy. Augustus Waters from the film version of ''[[The Fault in Our Stars (film)|The Fault in Our Stars]]'' (2014) was given this title in a 2014 [[Vulture.com|''Vulture'']] article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Patches |first=Matt |title=He's Perfect, He's Awful: The Case Against The Fault in Our Stars' Gus Waters |url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/06/case-against-fault-in-our-stars-gus-waters-manic-pixie-dream-guy.html |website=Vulture |publisher=''New York Magazine''|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Matt Patches stated, "he's a bad boy, he's a sweetheart, he's a dumb jock, he's a nerd, he's a philosopher, he's a poet, he's a victim, he's a survivor, he's everything everyone wants in their lives, and he's a fallacious notion of what we can ''actually'' have in our lives."

The Manic Pixie Dream Boy trope has also been pointed out in sitcoms such as ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'' and ''[[30 Rock]]''. The female protagonists of these shows are married to men ([[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]]'s [[Ben Wyatt (Parks and Recreation)|Ben Wyatt]] and [[James Marsden]]'s Criss Chros, respectively), who, according to a 2012 ''[[Grantland]]'' article, "patiently [tamp] down her stubbornness and temper while appreciating her quirks, helping her to become her best possible self".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lambert |first=Molly |title=1D Internet Fantasies: Liz Lemon, One Direction, and the Rise of the Manic Pixie Dream Guy |url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/1d-internet-fantasies-liz-lemon-one-direction-and-the-rise-of-the-manic-pixie-dream-guy/ |publisher=Grantland |accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character Jesse, played by [[Skylar Astin]], in the film ''[[Pitch Perfect]]'' (2012) embodies the Manic Pixie Dream Boy trope. His role in the film appears to be to coax the very serious character Beca, played by [[Anna Kendrick]], out of her gloom and embrace life to the fullest. He has no backstory of his own, and no major goals of his own in the context of the film. According to an article on Ohio State's Entertainment News site.

{{Quote|Jesse, the male protagonist, never fails to break my heart. His character is seemingly flawless: he is sweet, charming, funny, boyishly handsome, and talented, but in a self-deprecating way. The character radiates youthful appeal in a way that makes me want to sit close to him and watch John Hughes movies with him. He takes on the selfless task of cracking open the stony girl protagonist by showing her ''The Breakfast Club'' and becomes a victim—Jesse is unusual. Jesse is a background story-less charisma machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://osu.uloop.com/news/view.php/60295/Boys-and-Girls-in-Current-Film-A-Glimps/ |title=Boys and Girls in Current Film: A Glimpse into 'Manic Pixies' |first=Lacey |last=Ross |date=December 25, 2012 |publisher=[[Uloop]] |accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Algorithm-defined fantasy girl===
{{See also|Magical girlfriend}}
Another version of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl is the algorithm-defined fantasy girl. The difference is that the latter is not human, but a robot or artificial intelligence of some sort. The function is the same one: to fulfill the desires of the male character and to help him in his journey without having any desires or journey of her own. Some examples are: Joi in ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]'' and Samantha in [[Spike Jonze]]'s ''[[Her (film)|Her]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/11/16455282/blade-runner-2049-analysis-ana-de-armas-fantasy-girl|title=Blade Runner 2049 continues questionable trend of the ‘algorithm-defined fantasy girl’|first=Julia|last=Alexander|date=11 October 2017|website=Polygon|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/15/ex-machina-sexy-female-robots-scifi-film-obsession&lt;/ref&gt;

It was developed in 1998 in the Netherlands by the International Information Centre and Archives for the Women’s Movement (IIAV) in collaboration with the [[Royal Tropical Institute]], and [[Oxfam|Oxfam, GB]], with a grant from [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wieringa|first=Saskia |title=Traveling Heritages: New Perspecitves on Collecting, Preserving, and Sharing Women's History|publisher=[[Amsterdam University Press]]|year=2008|page=136|isbn=9789052602998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presently [[Atria (institute)|Atria]], institute on gender equality and women’s history, the successor of the IIAV, maintains the database.

It contains almost 600 women's information centres from over 130 countries and can be accessed through the Atria website.

==Finding relevant sources of women's information==
The Mapping the World database is a tool for finding sources of women's information, that are open to the public. The centers provide the information, which includes a description of the center, highlights in their collections, and contact information.
Many of the centers listed in the database have resources such as books, periodicals, and photos, to be viewed and used on site at the center, or to be searched on line through their website.

==What are Women’s Information Services==

Women have collected and disseminated information for hundreds of years, but it is only from early 20th century that centres have been developed for the specific purpose of collecting and documenting what has come to be known as women’s information. Women’s information envelops a wide spectrum of material, cultural, political and educational issues.

Women’s information centres give women access to information that affects them. In the past fifty years, influenced by the worldwide women’s movement, collections have become more established and have developed their own professional instruments  (for example the Women’s Thesaurus,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.atria.nl/en/library-archive/womens-thesaurus Women's Thesaurus]&lt;/ref&gt; an instrument developed to index women’s information).

Women’s information services include:
* International, national and local women’s information services
* Women’s documentation and research centres connected to universities
* Gender specific information sections in governmental organisations, and
* Resource centres in which, among others, women’s information is collected,
* Or, where the development of the women’s movement is still in its early stages, such as in newly democratic countries, or in countries where war has destabilised development, a women’s magazine, a radio or TV programme are often ‘focal point’ for women’s information, accessible to the public.

==Targetgroup==
The database is a resource for anyone looking for print, on line, photographic, audio-visual, or other resources about women.  Sources of women's information are to be found in over 50 languages, covering hundreds of relevant subjects, from more than 130 countries. 
Targetusers are women and women’s organizations, policymakers, decision-makers and general information services.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13037">The '''marginal value theorem''' ('''MVT''') is an [[optimality model]] that usually describes the behavior of an optimally foraging individual in a system where resources (often food) are located in discrete patches separated by areas with no resources. Due to the resource-free space, animals must spend time traveling between patches. The MVT can also be applied to other situations in which organisms face [[diminishing returns]].

The MVT was first proposed by [[Eric Charnov]] in 1976. In his original formulation: "The predator should leave the patch it is presently in when the marginal capture rate in the patch drops to the average capture rate for the habitat."&lt;ref name="Charnov 1976"&gt;[[Eric Charnov|Charnov, E. L.]] 1976. Optimal foraging: the marginal value theorem. Theoretical Population Biology 9:129–136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
All animals must forage for food in order to meet their energetic needs, but doing so is energetically costly. It is assumed that evolution by natural selection results in animals utilizing the most economic and efficient strategy to balance energy gain and consumption.  The Marginal Value Theorem is an optimality model that describes the strategy that maximizes gain per unit time in systems where resources, and thus rate of returns, decrease with time.&lt;ref name="Parker 1991"&gt;Parker, G.A. “Marginal Value Theorem with Exploitation Time Costs: Diet, Sperm Reserves, and Optimal Copula Duration in Dung Flies” (1992) The American Naturalist 139(6):1237–1256&lt;/ref&gt; The model weighs benefits and costs and is used to predict giving up time and giving up density. Giving up time (GUT) is the interval of time between when the animal last feeds and when it leaves the patch. Giving up density (GUD) is the food density within a patch when the animal will choose to move on to other food patches.

When an animal is foraging in a system where food sources are patchily distributed, the MVT can be used to predict how much time an individual will spend searching for a particular patch before moving on to a new one. In general, individuals will stay longer if (1) patches are farther apart or (2) current patches are poor in resources. Both situations increase the ratio of travel cost to foraging benefit.

[[File:Marginalvaluetheorem.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The optimal time spent in a patch is given by the tangent to the resource intake curve that departs from the expected transit time value. Any other line crossing the resource intake curve has a shallower slope and thus a sub-optimal resource intake rate.]]

==Modeling==
As animals forage in patchy systems, they balance resource intake, traveling time, and foraging time. Resource intake within a patch diminishes with time, as shown by the solid curve in the graph to the right. The curve follows this pattern because resource intake is initially very fast, but slows as the resource is depleted. Traveling time is shown by the distance from the leftmost vertical dotted line to the y-axis. Optimal foraging time is modeled by connecting this point on the x-axis tangentially to the resource intake curve. Doing so maximizes the ratio between resource intake and time spent foraging and traveling.

At the extremes of the loading curve, animals spend too much time traveling for a small payoff, or they search too long in a given patch for an ineffective load. The MVT identifies the best possible intermediate between these extremes.

===Assumptions===
# The individual is assumed to control when it leaves the patch in order to maximize the ratio between resource intake and time.
# The consumer depletes the amount of resources in the patch where he/she is foraging; therefore, the rate of intake of food in that patch decreases as a function of time.
# If there is variation in the quality of patches, the MVT assumes that different patches are distributed randomly throughout the landscape.

==Examples==

===Humans===
A common illustration of the MVT is apple picking in humans. When one first arrives at a new apple tree, the number of apples picked per minute is high, but it rapidly decreases as the lowest-hanging fruits are depleted. Strategies in which too few apples are picked from each tree or where each tree is exhausted are suboptimal because they result, respectively, in time lost travelling among trees or picking the hard to find last few apples from a tree. The optimal time spent picking apples in each tree is thus a compromise between these two strategies, which can be quantitatively found using the MVT.

===Optimal foraging in great tits===
[[Great tit]]s are a species of bird found throughout Europe, northern Africa, and Asia. They are known to forage in “patchy” environments, and research has shown that their behavior can be modeled by [[Optimal foraging theory|optimal foraging models]], including the MVT. In a 1977 study by R.A. Cowie,&lt;ref name="Cowie 1977"&gt;Cowie, R. J. (1977) “Optimal foraging in great tits (Parus Major)” Nature 268:137–139&lt;/ref&gt; birds were deprived of food and then allowed to forage through patches in two different environments (the environments differed only in distance between patches). As predicted, in both cases birds spent more time in one area when the patches were farther away or yielded more benefits, regardless of the environment. In a similar experiment by Naef-Daenzer (1999),&lt;ref name="ND1999"&gt;Naef-Daenzer, Beat (1999) “Patch time allocation and patch sampling by foraging great and blue tits” Animal Behavior 59:989–999&lt;/ref&gt; great tits were shown to have a foraging efficiency 30% better than random foraging would yield. This is because great tits were specifically spending more time in resource-rich areas, as predicted by the MVT. This data supports the use of the MVT in predicting the foraging behavior of great tits.

===Feeding in hairy armadillos and guinea pigs===
Experimental evidence has shown that [[screaming hairy armadillo]]s and [[guinea pig]]s qualitatively follow MVT when foraging.&lt;ref name="Cassini 1990"&gt;Cassini, Marcelo H., Alejandro Kacelnik, and Enrique T. Segura (1990) “The tale of the screaming hairy armadillo, the guinea pig, and the marginal value theorem” Animal Behavior 39(6):1030–1050&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers ran several parallel experiments: one for each animal under consistent patch quality, and one for guinea pigs with varying patch quality. While the qualitative foraging trend was shown to follow MVT in each case, the quantitative analysis indicated that each patch was exploited further than expected.

===Plant root growth===
The MVT can be used to model foraging in plants as well as animals. Plants have been shown to preferentially place their roots, which are their foraging organs, in areas of higher resource concentration. Recall that the MVT predicts that animals will forage for longer in patches with higher resource quality. Plants increase root biomass in layers/areas of soil that are rich in nutrients and resources, and decrease root growth into areas of poor-quality soil. Thus, plants grow roots into patches of soil according to their wealth of resources in a manner consistent with the MVT.&lt;ref name="mcknickle"&gt;McNickle, Gordon G. and James F. Calhill Jr. “Plant root growth and the marginal value theorem” (2009) Proceedings of the National Academ of Sciences of the United States of America 106(12):4747–4751&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, plant roots grow more quickly through low-quality patches of soil than through high-quality patches of soil, just as foraging animals are predicted to spend less time in low-quality areas than high-quality areas.

===Copulation time in dung flies===
The MVT can be applied to situations other than foraging in which animals experience diminished returns. Consider, for example, the mating copulation duration of the [[Scathophaga stercoraria|yellow dung fly]]. In the dung fly mating system, males gather on fresh cow droppings and wait for females to arrive in smaller groups to lay their eggs. Males must compete with each other for the chance to mate with arriving females—sometimes one male will kick another male off of a female and take over mating with the female mid-copulation. In this instance, the second male fertilizes about 80% of the eggs.&lt;ref name="Parker and Stuart"&gt;Parker, G. A. and R. A. Stuart (1976) “Animal Behavior as a Strategy Optimizer: Evolution of Resource Assessment Strategies and Optimal Emigration Thresholds” The American Naturalist 110(976):1055–1076&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, after a male has mated with a female he guards her so that no other males will have the opportunity to mate with her and displace his sperm before she lays her eggs. After the female lays her eggs, the male must take the time to search for another female before he is able to copulate again.

The question, then, is how long the dung fly should spend copulating with each female. On one hand, the longer a male dung fly copulates the more eggs he can fertilize. However, the benefits of extra copulation time diminish quickly, as the male loses the chance to find another female during long copulations. The MVT predicts that the optimal copulation time is just long enough to fertilize about 80% of the eggs; after this time, the rewards are much smaller and are not worth missing out on another mate.&lt;ref name="Parker and Stuart" /&gt; This predicted value for copulation time, 40 minutes, is very close to the average observed value, 36 minutes.

In dung flies, the observed values of copulation time and time searching for another mate vary with body weight. Heavier males have shorter search times and shorter copulation times. These shorter search times are likely due to increased cost of travel with increased body weight; shorter copulation times probably reflect that it is easier for heavier males to successfully take over females mid-copulation. Additionally, researchers have taken into account “patch quality,” i.e. the quality of females arriving on the various cowpats. Research also shows that males copulate for longer with the larger females who hold more eggs and have larger reproductive tract dimensions. Thus, males change their copulation time to maximize their fitness, but they are doing so in response to selection imposed by female morphology. Even with these variations, male dung flies do exhibit close-to-optimal copulation time relative to their body size, as predicted by the MVT.&lt;ref name ="Parker et al 1999"&gt;Parker, Geoffrey A., Leigh W. Simmons, Paula Stockley, Doreen M. McChristie, and Eric L. Charnov. (1999) “Optimal copula duration in yellow dung flies: effects of female size and egg content.” Animal Behavior 57:795–805&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Many studies, such as the examples presented above, have shown good qualitative support for predictions generated by the Marginal Value Theorem. However, in some more quantitative studies, the predictions of the MVT haven’t been as successful, with the observed values substantially deviating from predictions. One proposed explanation for these deviations is that it is difficult to objectively measure payoff rates. For example, an animal in an unpredictable environment may need to spend extra time sampling, making it hard for researchers to determine foraging time.&lt;ref name="Nonacs"&gt;Nonacs, Peter. “State dependent behavior and the marginal value theorem.” (2001) Behavioral Ecology 12(1):71–83&lt;/ref&gt;
        
Beyond this imprecision, some researchers propose that there is something fundamental missing from the model. Namely, animals are probably doing more than just foraging, whether it be dealing with predation risks or searching for mating opportunities.&lt;ref name="Nonacs" /&gt; Natural selection is not the only force influencing the evolution of species. Sexual selection, for example, may alter foraging behaviors, making them less consistent with the MVT. These researchers point out that the marginal value theorem is a starting point, but complexity and nuances must be incorporated into models and tests for foraging and patch-use.

One other type of model that has been used in place of MVT in predicting foraging behavior is the state-dependent behavior model. Although state-dependent models have been viewed as a generalization of the MVT,&lt;ref name="Wajnberg et al 2000"&gt;Wajnberg Eric, Pierre Bernhard, Frederic Hamelin and Guy Boivin (2006). "Optimal patch time allocation for time-limited foragers." Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 60, 1–10&lt;/ref&gt; they are unlikely to generate broadly applicable predictions like those from the MVT because they test predictions under a specific set of conditions. While the predictions of these models must be tested under precise conditions, they might offer valuable insights not available from broader models such as MVT.&lt;ref name="Nonacs" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7143">A '''mathematical object''' is an [[abstract object]] arising in [[mathematics]]. The concept is studied in [[philosophy of mathematics]].

In mathematical practice, an ''object'' is anything that has been (or could be) formally defined, and with which one may do [[deductive reasoning]] and [[mathematical proof]]s. Commonly encountered mathematical objects include [[number]]s, [[permutation]]s, [[Partition of a set|partitions]], [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], [[set (mathematics)|sets]], [[function (mathematics)|functions]], and [[relation (mathematics)|relations]].  [[Geometry]] as a branch of mathematics has such objects as [[hexagon]]s, [[point (geometry)|points]], [[line (geometry)|lines]], [[triangle]]s, [[circle]]s, [[sphere]]s, [[polyhedron|polyhedra]], [[topological space]]s and [[manifold]]s.  Another branch&amp;mdash;[[algebra]]&amp;mdash;has [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], [[lattice (group)|group-theoretic lattices]], and [[lattice (order)|order-theoretic lattices]].  [[Category (mathematics)|Categories]] are simultaneously homes to mathematical objects and mathematical objects in their own right. In [[proof theory]], proofs and [[theorem]]s are also mathematical objects.

The [[Ontology|ontological status]] of mathematical objects has been the subject of much investigation and debate by philosophers of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[[John P. Burgess|Burgess, John]], and Rosen, Gideon, 1997. ''A Subject with No Object: Strategies for Nominalistic Reconstrual of Mathematics''. [[Oxford University Press]]. {{isbn|0198236158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cantorian framework==
One view that emerged around the turn of the 20th century with the work of [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]] is that all mathematical objects can be defined as [[Set (mathematics)|sets]].  The set {0,1} is a relatively clear-cut example.  On the face of it the [[group (mathematics)|group]] '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of integers mod 2 is also a set with two elements.  However, it cannot simply be the set {0,1}, because this does not mention the additional structure imputed to '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by the [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s of [[addition]] and [[additive inverse|negation]] mod 2: how are we to tell which of 0 or 1 is the [[additive identity]], for example?  To organize this group as a set it can first be coded as the [[Tuple|quadruple]] ({0,1},+,&amp;minus;,0), which in turn can be coded using one of several conventions as a set representing that quadruple, which in turn entails encoding the operations + and &amp;minus; and the constant 0 as sets.

Sets may include ordered denotation of the particular identities and operations that apply to them, indicating a group, abelian group, ring, field, or other mathematical object. These types of mathematical objects are commonly studied in [[abstract algebra]].

==Foundational paradoxes==
If, however, the goal of mathematical ontology is taken to be the internal consistency of mathematics, it is more important that mathematical objects be definable in some uniform way (for example, as sets) regardless of actual practice, in order to lay bare the [[essence]] of its [[paradox]]es.  This has been the viewpoint taken by [[foundations of mathematics]], which has traditionally accorded the management of paradox higher priority than the faithful reflection of the details of mathematical practice as a justification for defining mathematical objects to be sets.

Much of the tension created by this foundational identification of mathematical objects with sets can be relieved without unduly compromising the goals of foundations by allowing two kinds of objects into the mathematical universe, sets and [[relation (mathematics)|relation]]s, without requiring that either be considered merely an instance of the other.  These form the basis of [[model theory]] as the [[domain of discourse]] of [[predicate logic]].  From this viewpoint, mathematical objects are entities satisfying the [[axiom]]s of a formal theory expressed in the language of predicate logic.

==Category theory==
A variant of this approach replaces relations with [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]], the basis of [[universal algebra]].  In this variant the axioms often take the form of [[equation]]s, or implications between equations.

A more abstract variant is [[category theory]], which abstracts sets as objects and the operations thereon as [[morphism]]s between those objects.  At this level of abstraction mathematical objects reduce to mere [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] whose [[edge (geometry)|edge]]s as the morphisms abstract the ways in which those objects can transform and whose structure is encoded in the [[Function composition|composition law]] for morphisms. [[Category (mathematics)|Categories]] may arise as the models of some axiomatic theory and the [[homomorphism]]s between them (in which case they are usually [[concrete category|concrete]], meaning equipped with a [[Full and faithful functors|faithful]] [[forgetful functor]] to the category '''[[category of sets|Set]]''' or more generally to a suitable [[topos]]), or they may be constructed from other more primitive categories, or they may be studied as abstract objects in their own right without regard for their [[provenance]].

The '''metre–tonne–second''' or '''MTS''' system of units is a system of [[physical unit]]s. It was invented in France, hence the unit names ''sthène'' and ''pièze'', and became its legal system between 1919 and 1961 ("décret" 5 May 1961, "Journal Officiel"). It was adopted by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1933 and abolished there in 1955. It was a [[metric system|metric]] and [[coherent system]] of units, much as [[SI]] and the [[centimetre–gram–second system]] (CGS), but with larger units for industrial use, whereas the CGS system was regarded as suitable for laboratory use only.&lt;ref name=ieeeghn&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14410">'''''Nafs''''' ({{lang|ar|نَفْس}}) is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word occurring in the [[Quran]] and means "[[Self (philosophy)|self]]", "[[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]",&lt;ref name=Talib&gt;Nurdeen Deuraseh and Mansor Abu Talib (2005), "Mental health in Islamic medical tradition", ''The International Medical Journal'' '''4''' (2), p. 76-79&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Ego (Freudian)|ego]]" or "[[soul]]". In the Quran, the word is used in both the individualistic (verse 2:48) and collective sense (verse 4:1), indicating that although humanity is united in possessing the qualities of a ''nafs'' (i.e. "soul" or "consciousness"), they are individually responsible for exercising the agencies of the "free will" that it provides them.
{{Sufism|Ideas}}{{Sunni Islam}}{{Alevism|Beliefs}}

Much of the popular literature on ''nafs'', however, is focused on the [[Sufi]] conceptions of the term. According to the [[Sufi philosophy|Sufi philosophies]], the ''nafs'' in its unrefined state is "the ego", which they consider to be the lowest dimension of a person's inward existence — his animal and [[Satan]]ic nature.&lt;ref name="Chittick 1983"&gt;{{cite book

==Quranic concept==
The triliteral root ''nūn fā sīn'' (ن ف س) occurs 298 times in the Quran, in four derived forms:&lt;ref name="The Quranic Arabic Corpus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=nfs|title=The Quranic Arabic Corpus - Quran Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#once as the form V verb ''tanaffasa'' (تَنَفَّسَ)
#once as the form VI verb ''yatanāfasi'' (يَتَنَافَسِ)
#295 times as the noun ''nafs'' (نَفْس)
#once as the form VI active participle ''mutanāfisūn'' (مُتَنَٰفِسُون)

The noun ''nafs'' has important instances in the Quran such as the following: "O you who have believed, upon you is [responsibility for] yourselves..."&lt;ref name=Quran.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quran.com/5/105|title=Surah Al-Ma'idah - The Noble Qur'an - القرآن الكريم|publisher=}} [http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-5/verse-105/ Quran Surah Al-Maaida ( Verse 105 )]&lt;/ref&gt; The major theme of the word ''nafs'' as used in the Quran is to instill a sense of individual responsibility through a strong emphasis on the choices made by the individual (as in 5:105), while at the same time reminding humanity of its common origins (verse 4:1).

The Quran affords much importance to the ''nafs'' of an individual, highlighting the agency of free will and intelligence, without which neither responsibility nor accountability can exist. The Quran does not attribute to the ''nafs'' any inherent properties of [[good]] or [[evil]], but instead conveys the idea that it is something which has to be nurtured and self-regulated, so that it can progress into becoming 'good' through its thoughts and actions. The Quranic conception of the ''nafs'' therefore has an extremely modernistic undertone, much like Nietzsche's conception of "Übermensch" or 'Superman', as suggested by [[Muhammad Iqbal]], a prominent Muslim scholar and philosopher, who went as far as to accuse Nietzsche of borrowing the term from Islamic thought. Iqbal stated: "It is probable that Nietzsche borrowed it (Übermensch) from the literature of Islam or of the East and degraded it by his materialism."&lt;ref name="IQBAL ACADEMY PAKISTAN"

==Sufism's conception of nafs==

===Three principal stages===
There are three principal stages of ''nafs'' in Sufistic Wisdom, also mentioned in different verses of the Quran. The Sufis call them "stages" in the process of development, refinement and mastery of the ''nafs''.&lt;ref name=IdriesShah&gt;{{cite book

===The inciting ''nafs'' (''an-nafs al-ʾammārah'')===
In its primitive stage the ''nafs'' incites us to commit evil: this is the ''nafs'' as the lower self, the base instincts.&lt;ref name="Schimmel 1975"&gt;{{cite book

Islam emphasizes the importance of fighting the inciting ''nafs'' in Quran&lt;ref name=ahadess.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahadees.com/englisharabicurdu-surah-87.html|title=Surah Al-A'la   -  Arabic Text with Urdu and English Translation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[hadith]]. One [[hadith|tradition]] holds that [[Muhammad]] said after returning from a war, "We now return from the small struggle ([[Jihad#Lesser Jihad .28Jihad bil Saif.29|Jihad Asghar]]) to the big struggle ([[Jihad#Greater Jihad|Jihad Akbar]])". His companions asked, "O [[prophet]] of [[God]], what is the big struggle?" He replied, "The struggle against ''nafs''."&lt;ref name="Kabbani"&gt;{{Cite web

This stage is generally divided into the levels ''al nafs al-hayawaniyya'' und ''al nafs al-iblissiyya''. ''Al nafs al-hayawaniyya'' ("the animal state") describes the self, which runs after material possessesion, sensual desires and animalistic pleasures. ''Al nafs al-iblissiyya'' is even lower than the animal state, because the self seeks to replace God in the love for itself.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Leaman ''The Qur'an: A Philosophical Guide'' Bloomsbury Publishing 2016 {{ISBN|978-1-474-21620-3}} page 84&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran enjoins the faithful "to hinder the ''nafs'' from [[lust]]",{{Quran-usc|79|40}} and another [[hadith|traditional narration]] warns that "the worst enemy you have is [the ''nafs''] between your sides."&lt;ref name="Nicholson 1914"&gt;{{cite book

  | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rumi]] warns of the ''nafs'' in its guise of religious hypocrisy, saying "the ''nafs'' has a [[rosary]] and a [[Koran]] in its right hand, and a [[scimitar]] and dagger in the sleeve."&lt;ref name="Nicholson 1990"&gt;{{cite book | last = Nicholson | first = Reynold | authorlink = Reynold Nicholson | title = [[Mathnawi]] of [[Jalaluddin Rumi]] | publisher = [[Gibb Memorial Trust]] | location = Warminster | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-906094-27-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal imagery is often used to describe the ''nafs''. A popular image is a donkey or unruly horse that must be trained and broken so that eventually it will bear its rider to the goal.&lt;ref name="Nicholson 1911"&gt;{{Cite book

===The self-accusing ''nafs'' (''an-nafs al-luwwāmah'')===
In Sura al-[[Qiyama]] the Quran mentions "the self-accusing ''nafs''".{{Quran-usc|75|2}} This is the stage where "the [[conscience]] is awakened and the self accuses one for listening to one’s ego. One repents and asks for [[forgiveness]]."&lt;ref name="PathToSpiritualExcellence"&gt;{{cite book

===The ''nafs'' at peace (''an-nafs al-muṭmaʾinnah'')===
In Sura al-[[Fajr]] the Quran mentions "the ''nafs'' at peace".{{Quran-usc|89|27}} This is the ideal stage of ego for Muslims. On this level one is firm in one’s faith and leaves bad manners behind.&lt;ref name="PathToSpiritualExcellence"/&gt; The soul becomes tranquil, at peace.&lt;ref name="PathToSpiritualExcellence"/&gt; At this stage, followers of Sufism have relieved themselves of all [[materialism]] and worldly problems and are satisfied with the will of God.

====Four additional stages of ''nafs''====

In addition to the three principal stages, another four are sometimes cited:

=====The inspired ''nafs'' (''an-nafs al-mulhamah'')=====
This stage comes between the 2nd and 3rd principal stages. It is the stage of action. On this level "one becomes more firm in listening to one’s conscience, but is not yet surrendered."&lt;ref name="PathToSpiritualExcellence"/&gt; Once you have seen your weaknesses and have set your targets, this ego inspires you to do good deeds and to be on the plus side. The Sufis say that it is important that whenever you think of good, you must immediately act upon it. Abbas Bin Abdul Muttalib lays down three rules:{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}
#Ta'Jeel or Swiftness. A good deed must be done immediately and there should be no laziness.
#Tehqeer or Contempt. You must look at your good acts with contempt otherwise you will become self-righteous.
#Ikhfa or Secrecy. You must keep your good acts secret otherwise people will praise you and it will make you self-righteous.

According to the Quran, charity should be given both secretly and openly. In [[Muhammad Asad]]'s translation of the Quran, 14:31 reads: "[And] tell [those of] My servants who have attained to faith that they should be constant in prayer and spend [in Our way], secretly and openly, out of what We provide for them as sustenance, ere there come a Day when there will be no bargaining, and no mutual befriending."

=====The pleased ''nafs'' (''an-nafs ar-raḍīyyah'')=====
The stage comes after the 3rd principal stage. On this level "one is pleased with whatever comes from Allah and doesn’t live in the past or future, but in the moment."&lt;ref name="PathToSpiritualExcellence"/&gt; "One thinks always: ‘Ilahi Anta Maqsudi wa ridhaka matlubi’. One always sees oneself as weak and in need of Allah."&lt;ref name="PathToSpiritualExcellence"/&gt;

=====The pleasing ''nafs'' (''an-nafs al-marḍīyyah'')=====
On this level the two [[Ruh]]s in man "have made peace".&lt;ref name="PathToSpiritualExcellence"/&gt; "One is soft and tolerant with people and has good [[Akhlaq]] (Arabic: أخلاق), good manners."&lt;ref name="PathToSpiritualExcellence"/&gt;

=====The pure ''nafs'' (''an-nafs aṣ-ṣāfīyyah'')=====
On this level "one is dressed in the attributes of the [[insan kamil|Insan Kamil]], the perfected man, who is completely surrendered and inspired by Allah."&lt;ref name="PathToSpiritualExcellence"/&gt; One is "in full agreement with the Will of Allah".&lt;ref name="PathToSpiritualExcellence"/&gt;

=====Full sequence of ''nafs'' development=====

Therefore, the full sequence of the seven stages of the development of the ''nafs'' is as follows:

# The inciting ''nafs'' (an-nafs al-ʾammārah)
# The self-accusing ''nafs'' (an-nafs al-luwwāmah)
# The inspired ''nafs'' (an-nafs al-mulhamah)
# The ''nafs'' at peace (an-nafs al-muṭmaʾinnah)
# The pleased ''nafs'' (an-nafs ar-raḍīyyah)
# The pleasing ''nafs'' (an-nafs al-marḍīyyah)
# The pure ''nafs'' (an-nafs aṣ-ṣāfīyyah)

[[Dervish]]es from the [[Jerrahi]] school of Sufism are encouraged to study a text describing these stages of ''nafs'' as a nested series of cities.&lt;ref name="Frager1" /&gt;

====Characteristics of ''nafs''====

In its primitive state the ''nafs'' has seven characteristics that must be overcome:{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}
#[[Pride]] (''Takabbur'')
#[[Greed]] (''Hirs'')
#[[Jealousy]] (''Hasad'')
#[[Lust]] (''Shahwah'')
#[[Backbiting]] (''Gheebah'')
#[[Stinginess]] (''Bokhl'')
#[[wikt:malice|Malice]] (''Keena'')

'''Optical sorting''' (sometimes called '''digital sorting''') is the automated process of [[sorting]] solid products using [[cameras]] and/or [[lasers]].

Depending on the types of sensors used and the software-driven intelligence of the [[image processing]] system, optical sorters can recognize objects' color, size, shape, structural properties and chemical composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sun|first=Da-Wen|title=Computer Vision Technology for Food Quality Evaluation|year=2007|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-373642-0|pages=600|url=http://www.elsevier.com/books/computer-vision-technology-for-food-quality-evaluation/sun/978-0-12-373642-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sorter compares objects to user-defined accept/reject criteria to identify and remove defective products and foreign material (FM) from the production line, or to separate product of different grades or types of materials.

[[File:SortingPotatoStrips.jpg|thumb|Optical sorting achieves non-destructive, 100 percent inspection in-line at full production volumes.]]  
Optical sorters are in widespread use in the [[food industry]] worldwide, with the highest adoption in processing harvested foods such as potatoes, fruits, vegetables and nuts where it achieves non-destructive, 100 percent inspection in-line at full production volumes. The technology is also used in [[pharmaceutical manufacturing]] and [[nutraceutical]] manufacturing, tobacco processing, [[waste recycling]] and other industries. Compared to manual sorting, which is subjective and inconsistent, optical sorting helps improve product quality, maximize throughput and increase yields while reducing labor costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Joseph Irudayaraj|Irudayaraj]]|first=Joseph|title=Nondestructive Testing of Food Quality|year=2008|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-8138-2885-5|pages=384|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0813828856.html|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The sorting system ==

In general, optical sorters feature four major components: the feed system, the optical system, image processing software and the separation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=M|title=Detecting Foreign Bodies in Food|year=2004|publisher=Woodhead Publishing Ltd.|isbn=1 85573 729 9|pages=328|url=http://www.woodheadpublishing.com/en/book.aspx?bookID=614}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The objective of the feed system is to spread product into a uniform monolayer so products are presented to the optical system evenly, without clumps, at a constant velocity. The optical system includes lights and sensors housed above and/or below the flow of the objects being inspected. The image processing system compares objects to user-defined accept/reject thresholds to classify objects and actuate the separation system. The separation system, usually compressed air for small products and mechanical devices for larger products like whole potatoes, pinpoints objects while in-air and deflects the objects to remove into a reject chute while good product continues along its normal trajectory.

The ideal sorter depends on the application, with the product's characteristics and the user's objectives determining the ideal sensors, software-driven capabilities and mechanical platform.

== Sensors ==
Optical sorters require a compatible combination of light and sensors to illuminate objects and capture images of the objects before the images can be processed and accept/reject decisions made.

There are camera sorters, laser sorters and sorters that feature a combination of cameras and lasers on one platform. Lights, cameras, lasers and laser sensors can be designed to function within visible light wavelengths as well as the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) [[spectrum]]s. The optimal wavelengths for each application maximize the contrast between the objects to be separated. Cameras and laser sensors can differ in spatial resolution, with higher resolutions enabling the sorter to detect and remove smaller defects.

=== Cameras ===

[[File:SortingGreenBeans.jpg|thumb|Shape sorting enables the detection of same-color defects and foreign material]] Monochromatic cameras detect shades of gray from black to white and can be effective when sorting products with high-contrast defects.

Sophisticated color cameras with high color resolution are capable of detecting millions of colors to better distinguish more subtle color defects. [[Trichromatic]] color cameras (also called three-channel cameras) divide light into three bands, which can include red, green and/or blue within the visible spectrum as well as IR and UV.

Coupled with intelligent software, sorters that feature cameras are capable of recognizing each object's color, size and shape as well as the color, size, shape and location of a defect on a product. Some intelligent sorters even allow the user to define a defective product based on the total defective surface area of any given object. They use high beam infrared laser beams to show the laser on the beam.

=== Lasers ===

While cameras capture product information based primarily on material reflectance, lasers and their sensors are able to interrogate a material's structural properties in addition to determining differences in color. This structural property inspection capability makes lasers ideal for detecting a wide range of organic and inorganic foreign material such as insects, glass, metal, sticks, rocks and plastic, even if they are the same color as the good product, and for separating various materials at waste recycling facilities.

Lasers can be designed to operate within specific wavelengths of light, within the visible spectrums and beyond. For example, lasers can detect chlorophyll by stimulating fluorescence using specific wavelengths, a process that is very effective for removing foreign material from green vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Hong|title=Automatic sorting of Chinese jujube (Zizyphus jujuba Mill. cv. 'hongxing') using chlorophyll fluorescence and support vector machine|journal=Journal of Food Engineering|date=December 2010|volume=101|pages=402–408|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260877410003754|doi=10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.07.028|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Camera/laser combinations ===

Sorters equipped with cameras and lasers on one platform are generally capable of identifying the widest variety of attributes. Cameras are often better at recognizing color, size and shape while laser sensors identify differences in structural properties to maximize foreign material detection and removal. 
 
=== Hyperspectral imaging ===

[[File:Hyperspectral image of "sugar end" potato strips.jpg|thumb|Hyperspectral image of "sugar end" potato strips shows invisible defects]] Driven by the need to solve previously impossible sorting challenges, a new generation of sorters that feature [[multispectral]] and [[hyperspectral imaging]] systems are being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgstaller|first=Markus|author2=Groinig, Marcus|title=Spectral Imaging Sorts 'Sugar-End' Defects|journal=Vision Systems Design|date=February 2012|url=http://www.vision-systems.com/articles/print/volume-17/issue-2/features/spectral-imaging-sorts-sugar-end-defects.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like trichromatic cameras, multispectral and hyperspectral cameras collect data from across the electromagnetic spectrum. Unlike trichromatic cameras, which divide light into three bands, hyperspectral systems can divide light into hundreds of narrow bands over a continuous range that covers a vast portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Compared to the three data points per pixel collected by trichromatic cameras, hyperspectral cameras can collect hundreds of data points per pixel, which are combined to create a unique [[spectral signature]] (also called a fingerprint) for each object. When complemented by capable software intelligence, a hyperspectral sorter processes those fingerprints to enable sorting on the chemical composition of the product. This is an emerging area of [[chemometrics]].

== Software-driven intelligence ==
Once the sensors capture the object's response to the energy source, image processing takes over to manipulate the raw data to extract and categorize information about specific features. As raw data flows from the sensors, the definitions of good and bad flow from the user who sets the accept/reject thresholds. The art and science of image processing lies in developing [[algorithms]] that maximize the effectiveness of the sorter while presenting a simple user-interface to the operator.

Object-based recognition is a classic example of software-driven intelligence. It allows the user to define a defective product based on where a defect lies on the product and/or the total defective surface area of an object. It offers more control in defining a wider range of defective products, and if used to control the sorter's ejection system, it improves the accuracy of ejecting defective products, which improves product quality and increases yields.

New software-driven capabilities are constantly being developed to address the specific needs of various applications. As computing hardware becomes more powerful, new software-driven advancements become possible. Some of these advancements enhance the effectiveness of sorters to achieve better results while others enable completely new sorting decisions to be made.

== Platforms ==
The considerations that determine the ideal platform for a specific application include the nature of the product – large or small, wet or dry, fragile or unbreakable, round or easy to stabilize – and the user's objectives. In general, products smaller than a grain of rice and as large as whole potatoes can be sorted. Throughputs range from less than 2 metric tons of product per hour on low-capacity sorters to more than 35 metric tons of product per hour on high-capacity sorters.

=== Channel sorters ===

The simplest optical sorters are channel sorters, a type of [[color sorter]] that can be effective for products that are small, hard and dry with a consistent size and shape such as rice and seeds. For these products, channel sorters offer an affordable solution and ease of use with a small footprint. Channel sorters feature monochromatic or color cameras and remove defects and foreign material based only on differences in color.

For products that are soft or wet or non-homogenous, which cannot be handled by a channel sorter, and for processors that want more control over the quality of their product, freefall sorters (also called waterfall or gravity-fed sorters), chute-fed sorters or belt sorters are ideal. These more sophisticated sorters often feature advanced cameras and/or lasers that, when complemented by capable software intelligence, detect objects' size, shape, color, structural properties and chemical composition.

=== Freefall and chute-fed sorters ===

As the names imply, freefall sorters inspect product in-air during the freefall, while chute-fed sorters stabilize product on a chute prior to in-air inspection. The major advantages of freefall and chute-fed sorters, compared to belt sorters, are a lower price point, smaller footprint and the absence of moving parts, which contributes to low maintenance. These sorters are often most suitable for nuts and berries as well as a frozen and dried fruits, vegetables, potato strips and seafood, in addition to waste recycling applications that require mid-volume throughputs.

=== Belt Sorters ===

[[File:SortingPeas.jpg|thumb|Optical sorters can function within visible light wavelengths as well as the IR and UV spectrums]] Belt sorting platforms are often preferred for higher capacity applications such as vegetable and potato products prior to canning, freezing or drying, most fresh cut produce and wet fruits as well as waste recycling. Belt sorters stabilize product on a conveyor belt prior to inspection. Some belt sorters inspect product on the belt from the top only while others also launch product off the belt for in-air inspection from the bottom. Belt sorters can be designed to achieve traditional two-way sorting or can be equipped with two ejector systems and three outfeed streams to achieve three-way sorting.

=== ADR systems ===

A fifth type of sorting platform, called an automated defect removal (ADR) system, is specifically for potato strips (French fries). Unlike other sorters that eject products with defects from the production line, ADR systems identify defects and actually cut the defects from the strips. In conjunction with a mechanical nubbin grader that follows the ADR, this combination is essentially another type of optical sorting system because it uses optical sensors to identify and remove defects.

=== Single-file inspection systems ===

The platforms described above all operate in bulk mode, without needing to single-file product prior to inspection. In contrast, a sixth type of platform, used in the pharmaceutical industry, is a single-file optical inspection system. Although these sorters are effective in detecting and removing foreign tablets and capsules and defects based on differences in size, shape and color, they have not been widely adopted due to the high capital costs, low throughput and slow changeover, compared to the belt sorters for tablets, capsules and softgels.

=== Mechanical graders ===

For products that require sorting only by size, mechanical grading systems that don't utilize sensors or image processing systems are often highly effective. These mechanical grading systems are sometimes referred to as sorting systems, but should not be confused with optical sorters that feature sensors and image processing systems.

'''''{{lang|fr|Peine forte et dure}}''''' ([[Law French]] for "hard and forceful punishment") was a method of [[torture]] formerly used in the [[common law]] legal system, in which a [[defendant]] who refused to [[plea]]d ("stood mute") would be subjected to having heavier and heavier stones placed upon his or her chest until a plea was entered, or he/she died.

Many defendants charged with capital offences would refuse to plead in order to avoid forfeiture of property. If the defendant pleaded either guilty or not guilty and was executed, their heirs would inherit nothing, their property [[escheat]]ing to the Crown. If they refused to plead their heirs would inherit their estate, even if they died in the process.

==Legal background==
[[File:Engraving for the Malefactor's Register the punishment formerly inflicted on those who refused pleading to an indictment.jpg|left|thumb|An engraving of the ''peine forte et dure'' inflicted on a prisoner (appearing in the "[[The Newgate Calendar|Malefactor's register]]" of 1780)]]
The common law courts originally took a very limited view of their own [[jurisdiction]]. They considered themselves to lack jurisdiction over a defendant until he had voluntarily submitted to it by entering a plea seeking judgment from the court.&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Frederick Pollock]] and [[Frederic William Maitland]], ''[[The History of English Law]]'', v. 2, pp. 650–651 (Cambridge; 1968; {{ISBN|0-521-07062-7}})&lt;/ref&gt; Obviously, a [[criminal justice]] system that could punish only those who had volunteered for possible punishment was unworkable; a means was needed to coerce them into entering a plea.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, [[William Blackstone]], ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' (1769), vol. 4, pp. *319-324&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, individuals were frequently tried under [[Admiralty law]], as observed by [[Henry de Bracton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae |url=http://bracton.law.harvard.edu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Standing Mute Act 1275", part of [[Statute of Westminster 1275|Statute of Westminster of 1275]] of [[Edward I of England]], states:
{{quote|It is provided also, That notorious Felons, which openly be of evil name, and will not put themselves in Enquests of Felonies that Men shall charge them with before the Justices at the King's suit, shall have strong and hard Imprisonment (prison forte et dure), as they which refuse to stand to the common Law of the Land : But this is not to be understood of such prisoners as be taken of light suspicion.&lt;ref name=tyburn&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/tyburntreeitshis00markuoft/tyburntreeitshis00markuoft_djvu.txt "TYBURN TREE: ITS HISTORY AND ANNALS"], Alfred Marks, 1908 ''(at archive.org)''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It appears to have initially meant imprisonment under harsh conditions:
{{quote|in the worst place in the prison, upon the bare ground continually, night and day; that they eat only bread made of barley or bran, and that they drink not the day they eat ...&lt;ref name=tyburn /&gt;}}
By the reign of [[Elizabeth I]] it took the form of "pressing" the accused with weights.&lt;ref name=tyburn /&gt; 
 
The procedure was recorded by a 15th-century witness as follows:
{{quote|he will lie upon his back, with his head covered and his feet, and one arm will be drawn to one quarter of the house with a cord, and the other arm to another quarter, and in the same manner it will be done with his legs; and let there be laid upon his body iron and stone, as much as he can bear, or more ...&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=veURAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=%22laid+in+some+low+dark+house%22#PPA218,M1 Curiosities of Cowell's "Interpreter"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Pressing to death" might take several days, and not necessarily with a continued increase in the load. The Frenchman Guy Miege, who from 1668 taught languages in London,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:ed89c430-0517-4065-b717-0243fd11b368 The enterprising and tenacious Guy Miège: four dictionaries from 1677 to 1688]&lt;/ref&gt; says the following about the English practice:&lt;ref&gt;Miege, G.:"[https://books.google.no/books?id=b3gZAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:Pu8Sknlj31oC&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VAMaUeXcJ8jR4QSm1YGoCg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The present state of Great-Britain and Ireland]" London 1715, p.294&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote| For such as stand Mute at their Trial, and refuse to answer Guilty, or Not Guilty, Pressing to Death is the proper Punishment. In such a Case the Prisoner is laid in a low dark Room in the Prison, all naked but his Privy Members, his Back upon the bare Ground his Arms and Legs stretched with Cords, and fastned to the several Quarters of the Room. This done, he has a great Weight of Iron and Stone laid upon him. His Diet, till he dies, is of three Morsels of Barley bread without Drink the next Day; and if he lives beyond it, he has nothing daily, but as much foul Water as he can drink three several Time, and that without any Bread: Which grievous Death some resolute Offenders have chosen, to save their Estates to their Children. But, in case of High Treason, the Criminal's Estate is forfeited to the Sovereign, as in all capital Crimes, notwithstanding his being pressed to Death.}}

''{{lang|fr|Peine forte et dure}}'' was abolished in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1772, with the last known actual use of the practice having been in 1741.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsu.edu/~crimdo/forfeiture.html Drug Control and Asset Seizures: a review of the history of forfeiture in England and colonial America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970428075512/http://www.fsu.edu/~crimdo/forfeiture.html |date=28 April 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1772 refusing to plead was deemed to be equivalent to pleading guilty, but this was changed in 1827 to being deemed a plea of not guilty &amp;ndash; which is now the case in all common law jurisdictions.

==Cases==
[[File:Giles Corey restored.jpg|thumb|[[Giles Corey]] was pressed to death during the [[Salem Witch Trials]] in the 1690s.]]
The most famous case in England was that of [[Roman Catholic]] [[martyr]] [[Margaret Clitherow|St Margaret Clitherow]], who (in order to avoid a trial in which her own children would be obliged to give evidence and could be tortured) was pressed to death on 25 March 1586, after refusing to plead to the charge of having harboured Catholic (then outlawed) [[priest]]s in her house. She died within fifteen minutes under a weight of at least {{convert|700|lb|kg}}. Several hardened criminals, including [[William Spiggot]] (1721) and Edward Burnworth, lasted a half hour under {{convert|400|lb|kg}} before pleading to the indictment. Others, such as Major Strangways (1658) and John Weekes (1731), refused to plead, even under {{convert|400|lb|kg}}, and were killed when bystanders, out of mercy, sat on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/23.2/mckenzie.html|title=Mackenzie, The Practise of Peine Forte et Dure in 16th and 17th Century England|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207082401/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/23.2/mckenzie.html|archivedate=7 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, [[Giles Corey]] was pressed to death between September 17 and September 19, 1692, during the [[Salem witch trials]], after he refused to enter a plea in the judicial proceeding. According to legend, his last words as he was being crushed were "More weight", and he was thought to have been killed as the weight was applied. This is referred to in Arthur Miller's political drama ''[[The Crucible]]'', where Giles Corey is pressed to death after refusing to plead "aye or nay" to the charge of witchcraft. In the film version of this play, the screenplay of which was also by Miller, Corey is crushed to death for refusing to reveal the name of a source of information.

The '''''Polish Operation''''' of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[NKVD|security service]] in 1937–1938 was a [[Mass operations of the NKVD|mass operation of the NKVD]] carried out in the [[Soviet Union]] against [[Poles]] (labeled by the Soviets as "agents") during the period of the [[Great Purge]]. It was ordered by the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] against the so-called "Polish spies" and customarily interpreted by the [[NKVD]] officials as relating to 'absolutely all Poles'. It resulted in the sentencing of 139,835 people, and summary executions of 111,091 Poles.&lt;ref name="Gellately-Kiernan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldman2011-217"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wendy Z.

==Order № 00485==
{{main article|Order № 00485}}
The top secret [[NKVD Order No. 00485]], titled "''On the liquidation of the Polish diversionist and espionage groups and POW units''," was approved on August 9, 1937 by [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|the Party's]] [[Central Committee]] [[Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Politburo]], and was signed by [[Nikolai Yezhov]] on August 11, 1937.&lt;ref name="Russian1" /&gt; It was distributed to the local subdivisions of the NKVD simultaneously with Yezhov's thirty-page "secret letter," explaining what the "Polish operation" was all about. The letter from Yezhov was titled, "''On fascist-resurrectionist, spying, diversional, defeationist, and terrorist activity of Polish intelligence in the USSR''".&lt;ref name="Russian2"&gt;Original document.

The "Order" adopted the simplified so-called "[[album procedure]]" (as it was called in NKVD circles). The long lists of Poles condemned by a lower NKVD organ (so-called ''dvoika'', a two-man team) during early meetings,{{r|Sanford2007}} were then collected into "albums" and sent to the midrange NKVD offices for a stamp of approval by a ''troika'' (a three-man team; a communist official, NKVD leader, and party procurator). Poles were the first ever major Soviet population group to be sentenced in this manner.&lt;ref name="Sanford2007"&gt;{{cite book |title=Katyn and the Soviet Massacre of 1940: Truth, Justice and Memory |author=[[George Sanford (political scientist)|George Sanford]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tV2AAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT33 |publisher=Routledge |date=2007 |ISBN=1134302991 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the approval of the entire "album", the executions were carried out immediately. This procedure was also used later on in other [[mass operations of the NKVD]].&lt;ref name="Werth2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tyrollins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SEMELIN-MASS-VIOLENCE-IN-USSR-NATION-FRON-OPERATIONS-OF-THE-NKVD-1937-TO-1938.pdf |title=The NKVD Mass Secret National Operations (August 1937 - November 1938) |publisher=MassViolence.org |work=Online Encyclopedia of Mass Violence |date=20 May 2010 |via=Internet Archive |author=Nicolas Werth |pages=4 of 10 |format=PDF |ISSN=1961-9898 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220170831/http://www.tyrollins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SEMELIN-MASS-VIOLENCE-IN-USSR-NATION-FRON-OPERATIONS-OF-THE-NKVD-1937-TO-1938.pdf |archivedate=20 February 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Polish Operation" was a second in a series of [[Mass operations of the NKVD|national operations of the NKVD]], carried out by the Soviet Union against ethnic groups including Latvian, Finnish, German and Romanian, based on a theory about an internal enemy (i.e. the [[fifth column]]) labelled as the "hostile capitalist surrounding" residing along its western borders.&lt;ref name="arlindo-correia-2" /&gt; In opinion of historian [[Timothy Snyder]], this fabricated justification was intended only to cover-up the state-sanctioned campaign of mass-murder aiming to eradicate Poles as a national (and linguistic) minority group.&lt;ref name="arlindo-correia-2" /&gt; Another possible cause according to Snyder might have sprung from the necessity to explain the [[Holodomor|Soviet-made famine in Ukraine]] which required a political scapegoat. A top Soviet official [[Vsevolod Balitsky]] chose the [[Polish Military Organization]] which was disbanded in 1921. The NKVD declared that it continued to exist. Some Soviet Poles were tortured in order to confess to its existence, and denounce other individuals as spies. Meanwhile, the Communist International helped by revisiting its files in search of Polish members, producing another bountiful source of made-up evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Snyder (2005), ''[https://books.google.ca/books?id=LkZlidUKEl8C&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=elections%20Poland%201930&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q=sabotaging+collectivization&amp;f=false  Sketches from a Secret War]'' Yale University Press, p. 129. {{ISBN|030010670X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scale of the Polish Operation and its victims==

Among them were tens of thousands of peasants, railway workers, industrial labourers, engineers and others. An additional 17 percent of victims came from the Soviet Byelorussia. The rest came from around Western Siberia and Kazakhstan, where exiled Poles had lived since the [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions]], as well as from the southern Urals, northern Caucasus and the rest of Siberia, including the Far East.&lt;ref name="Gellately-Kiernan"&gt;{{cite book | title=The specter of genocide: mass murder in historical perspective. | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | author=Robert Gellately, Ben Kiernan | year=2003 | pages=396 | isbn=0521527503 | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=k9Ro7b0tWz4C&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=%22lead,+in+the+next+fourteen+months,+to+the+arrest+of+143,810+people%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XHC3TdekDoPniALfvPE7&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lead%2C%20in%20the%20next%20fourteen%20months%2C%20to%20the%20arrest%20of%20143%2C810%20people%22&amp;f=false | quote= Polish operation (page 233 –) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following categories of people were arrested by the NKVD during its Polish operation, as described in Soviet documents:
# "Active" members of the [[Polish minority in Soviet Union]] (practically all Poles).&lt;ref name="Gellately-Kiernan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldman2011-217"/&gt;
# All [[immigrant]]s from [[Poland]].

# All [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] from the [[Polish-Soviet war]] remaining in the Soviet Union.
# Members of [[Polish Military Organisation|Polska Organizacja Wojskowa]] listed in the special list (most of them were not members of that organisation).

===Killing process and death toll===
According to archives of the NKVD: 111,091 [[Poles]] and people accused of ties with Poland, were sentenced to death, and 28,744 were sentenced to [[labor camp]]s (known as the "dry guillotine" of slow death by exposure, malnutrition, and overwork);&lt;ref name="grhs.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grhs.org/heritage/SovietRepression.pdf | title=Soviet "Paradise" Revisited: Genocide, Dissent, Memory and Denial | publisher=GRHS Heritage Society | accessdate=April 26, 2011 | author=Eric J.

The Operation was only a peak in the persecution of the Poles, which spanned more than a decade. As the Soviet statistics indicate, the number of ethnic Poles in the USSR dropped by 165,000 in that period. "It is estimated that Polish losses in the Ukrainian SSR were about 30%, while in the Belorussian SSR... the Polish minority was almost completely annihilated."&lt;ref name="balticnorthernminorities" /&gt;

[[Timothy Snyder]] gives a conservative estimate of 85,000 confirmed Poles executed simultaneously across the country.&lt;ref name="Snyder2010-103"/&gt;

Almost all victims of the NKVD shootings were men, wrote Michał Jasiński, most with families. Their wives and children were dealt with by the [[NKVD Order № 00486]]. The women were generally sentenced to deportation to Kazakhstan for an average of 5 to 10 years. Their children were put in orphanages to be brought up as Soviet, with no knowledge of their origins. All possessions of the accused were confiscated. The parents of the executed men – as well as their in-laws – were purposely left with nothing to live on, which usually sealed their fate as well. Statistical extrapolation, wrote Jasiński, increases the number of Polish victims in 1937–1938 to around 200–250,000 depending on size of their families.&lt;ref name="fronda"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fronda.gliwice.pl/czytelnia.php5?id=84 | title=Zapomniane ludobójstwo stalinowskie (The forgotten Stalinist genocide) | publisher=Gliwicki klub Fondy.

====Great Purge of Poles in Leningrad====
In [[Leningrad]], the [[NKVD]] reviewed local telephone books and arrested almost 7,000 citizens with Polish-sounding name with the vast majority of such nominal "suspects" were executed within 10 days of arrest.&lt;ref name="arlindo-correia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arlindo-correia.org/040111.html | title=The Devils’ Playground | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=April 26, 2011 | author=Joshua Rubenstein | quote=Rubenstein is the Northeast regional director of [[Amnesty International USA]] and a co-editor of ''The Unknown Black Book: The Holocaust in the German-Occupied Soviet Territories.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genocide characterization==
Historian [[Michael Ellman]] asserts that the "national operations", particularly the "Polish Operation", may have constituted [[genocide]] as defined by the UN convention.&lt;ref name="paulbogdanor"&gt;Michael Ellman, [http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/soviet/famine/ellman1933.pdf Stalin and the Soviet Famine of 1932-33 Revisited] [[PDF]] file&lt;/ref&gt; His opinion is shared by [[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], who calls the Polish operation of the NKVD "a mini-genocide".&lt;ref&gt;Simon Sebag Montefiore.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11629">The '''Pygmalion effect''', or '''Rosenthal effect''', is the phenomenon whereby others' expectations of a target person affect the target person's performance.&lt;ref name = Mitchell&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Terence R. |last2=Daniels |first2=Denise |editor-last=Walter C. Borman |editor2=Daniel R. Ilgen |editor3=Richard J. Klimoski |title=Handbook of Psychology (volume 12)|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |date=2003 |pages=229 |chapter=Motivation |isbn=0-471-38408-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is named after the Greek myth of [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]], a sculptor who fell in love with a statue he had carved, or alternately, after the Rosenthal–Jacobson study (see below).

A corollary of the Pygmalion effect is the [[golem effect]], in which low expectations lead to a decrease in performance;&lt;ref name = Mitchell /&gt; both effects are forms of [[self-fulfilling prophecy]]. By the Pygmalion effect, people internalize their positive labels, and those with positive labels succeed accordingly. The idea behind the Pygmalion effect is that increasing the leader's expectation of the follower's performance will result in better follower performance. Within [[sociology]], the effect is often cited with regard to [[education]] and [[social class]]. The concept of [[stereotype threat]] could be considered to be the inverse of the Pygmalion effect, as it denotes a negative form of self-fulfilling prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;https://www.ode.state.or.us/initiatives/closinggap/2005/threatstereo-edldrshp112004.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rosenthal–Jacobson study ==
[[Robert Rosenthal (psychologist)|Robert Rosenthal]] and [[Lenore Jacobson]]'s [[Pygmalion in the Classroom|study]] showed that, if [[teacher]]s were led to expect enhanced performance from children, then the children's performance was enhanced. This study supported the hypothesis that reality can be positively or negatively influenced by the expectations of others, called the [[observer-expectancy effect]]. Rosenthal argued that biased expectancies could affect reality and create self-fulfilling prophecies.&lt;ref name="RosenthalJacobson1992"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rosenthal, Robert|author2=Jacobson, Lenore|authorlink1=Robert Rosenthal (psychologist)|authorlink2=Lenore Jacobson|title=Pygmalion in the classroom : teacher expectation and pupils' intellectual development.|date=1992|publisher=Crown House Pub.|location=Bancyfelin, Carmarthen, Wales|isbn=978-1904424062|edition=Newly expanded}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All students in a single California elementary school were given a disguised IQ test at the beginning of the study. These scores were not disclosed to teachers. Teachers were told that some of their students (about 20% of the school chosen at random) could be expected to be "intellectual bloomers" that year, doing better than expected in comparison to their classmates. The bloomers' names were made known to the teachers. At the end of the study, all students were again tested with the same IQ-test used at the beginning of the study.  All six grades in both experimental and control groups showed a mean gain in IQ from before the test to after the test.  However, First and Second Graders showed statistically significant gains favoring the experimental group of "intellectual bloomers". This led to the conclusion that teacher expectations, particularly for the youngest children, can influence student achievement. Rosenthal believed that even attitude or mood could positively affect the students when the teacher was made aware of the "bloomers". The teacher may pay closer attention to and even treat the child differently in times of difficulty.

Rosenthal predicted that [[elementary school]] teachers may subconsciously behave in ways that facilitate and encourage the students' success. When finished, Rosenthal theorized that future studies could be implemented to find teachers who would encourage their students naturally without changing their teaching methods. The prior research that motivated this study was done in 1911 by psychologists regarding the case of [[Clever Hans]], a horse that gained notoriety because it was supposed to be able to read, spell, and solve math problems by using its hoof to answer. Many skeptics suggested that questioners and observers were unintentionally signaling Clever Hans. For instance, whenever Clever Hans was asked a question the observers' demeanor usually elicited a certain behavior from the subject that in turn confirmed their expectations. For example, Clever Hans would be given a math problem to solve, and the audience would get very tense the closer he tapped his foot to the right number, thus giving Hans the clue he needed to tap the correct number of times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/33936/33936-h/33936-h.htm#CHAPTER_IV |title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of Clever Hans (The Horse of Mr. von Osten), by Oskar Pfungst |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Students' views of teachers ==
Teachers are also affected by the children in the classroom. Teachers reflect what is projected into them by their students. An experiment done by Jenkins and Deno (1969) submitted teachers to a classroom of children who had either been told to be attentive, or unattentive, to the teachers' lecture. They found that teachers who were in the attentive condition would rate their teaching skills as higher.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, J. R., &amp; Deno, S. L.  (1969).  ''Influence of student behavior on teacher's self-evaluation.''  [[Journal of Educational Psychology]], 60, 439-442&lt;/ref&gt; Similar findings by Herrell (1971) stated that when a teacher was preconditioned to classrooms as warm or cold, the teacher would start to gravitate towards their precondition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED056331 Galatea in the Classroom: Student Expectations Affect Teacher Behavior]; Herrell, James M.&lt;/ref&gt; To further this concept, Klein (1971) did the same kind of study involving teachers still unaware of any precondition to the classroom but with the class full of confederates who were instructed to act differently during periods over the course of the lecture. "Klein reported that there was little difference between students' behaviors in the natural and the positive conditions."&lt;ref name="Good 1974 276–277"&gt;{{cite book|last=Good|first=Jere E. Brophy, Thomas L.|title=Teacher-student relationships: causes and consequences|year=1974|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|location=London|isbn=0-03-085749-X|pages=276–277}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more observational study designed to remove the likes of the [[Hawthorne effect]], Oppenlander (1969) studied the top and bottom 20% of students in the sixth grade from a school that tracks and organizes its students under such criteria.&lt;ref name="Good 1974 276–277" /&gt;

==Criticism of the Pygmalion study==
Soon after ''Pygmalion'''s publication, [[Robert L. Thorndike]], an [[educational psychology|educational psychologist]], criticized the study and demonstrated that the instrument used to assess the children's IQ scores was seriously flawed.&lt;ref name="Thorndike"&gt;Thorndike, R.L. (1968). Reviewed work: Pygmalion in the classroom by Robert Rosenthal and Lenore Jacobson. ''American Educational Research Journal, 5''(4), 708-711.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the average reasoning IQ score for the children in one regular class was in the retarded range, which, given the circumstances, is impossible. In the end, Thorndike wrote the Pygmalion study's findings were worthless. He summarized his evaluation of the instrument this way: "When the clock strikes thirteen, doubt is not only cast on the last stroke but also on all that have come before....When the clock strikes 14, we throw away the clock."&lt;ref name="Thorndike"/&gt; Rosenthal countered that "even if the initial test results were faulty, that didn’t invalidate the subsequent increase, as measured by the same test,"&lt;ref&gt;http://discovermagazine.com/2015/dec/14-great-expectations&lt;/ref&gt; although with initial IQ scores in the retarded range the observed change at the conclusion of the study is more likely to reflect [[regression toward the mean|regression-to-the-mean]] effects than the effect of teacher expectations.

A major limitation has also been the lack of replication. "Most studies using product measures found no expectancy advantage for the experimental group, but most studies using process measures did show teachers to be treating the experimental group more favorably or appropriately than they were treating the control group...because teachers did not adopt the expectations that the experimenters were attempting to induce, and/or because the teachers were aware of the nature of the experiment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Good|first=Jere E. Brophy, Thomas L.|title=Teacher-student relationships: causes and consequences|year=1974|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|location=London|isbn=0-03-085749-X|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis indicates that the magnitude of the effect of inducing IQ-related expectancies in teachers is reduced by the amount of time teachers have spent getting to know their students prior to expectancy induction: &lt;ref&gt;Raudenbush, S. W. (1984). Magnitude of teacher expectancy effects on pupil IQ as a function of the credibility of expectancy induction: A synthesis of findings from 18 experiments. ''Journal of Educational Psychology, 76''(1), 85-97. doi:10.1037/0022-0663.76.1.85&lt;/ref&gt; When teachers have gotten to know their students for more than two weeks prior to expectancy induction, the impact of expectancy induction is virtually zero.

== In the workplace ==
Leader expectations of the employee may alter leader behavior. This behavior that is expressed toward an employee can affect the behaviors of the employee in favor of the leader's expectations.&lt;ref name = Bezuijen&gt;Bezuijen, X., van den Berg, P., van Dam, K., &amp; Thierry, H. (2009). "Pygmalion and employee learning: The role of leader behaviors". ''[[Journal of Management]]'', 35(5), 1248–1267. doi: 10.1177/0149206308329966&lt;/ref&gt; The more an employee is engaged in learning activities, the higher the expectation is from the leader. In turn, the employee participates in more learning behavior. Leaders will show more leader behaviors such as leader-member exchange (trust, respect, obligation, etc.), setting specific goals, and allowing for more learning opportunities for employees, and giving employees feedback. These factors were brought about by Rosenthal's model of the Pygmalion effect.&lt;ref name = Bezuijen /&gt;

===By book===

====Book I====
While visiting the [[Piraeus]] with [[Glaucon]], [[Polemarchus]] asks [[Socrates]] to join him for a celebration. Socrates then asks [[Cephalus]], Polemarchus, and [[Thrasymachus]] their definitions of justice. Cephalus defines justice as giving what is owed. Polemarchus says justice is "the art which gives good to friends and evil to enemies." Thrasymachus proclaims "justice is nothing else than the interest of the stronger." Socrates overturns their definitions and says that it is to your advantage to be just and disadvantage to be unjust. The first book ends in [[aporia]] concerning its essence.

====Book II====
Socrates believes he has answered [[Thrasymachus]] and is done with the discussion of justice.

Socrates' young companions, [[Glaucon]] and [[Adeimantus of Collytus|Adeimantus]], continue the argument of Thrasymachus for the sake of furthering the discussion. Glaucon gives a speech in which he argues first that the origin of justice was in social contracts aimed at preventing one from suffering injustice and being unable to take revenge, second that all those who practice justice do so unwillingly and out of fear of punishment, and third that the life of the unjust man is far more blessed than that of the just man. Glaucon would like Socrates to prove that justice is not only desirable, but that it belongs to the highest class of desirable things: those desired both for their own sake and their consequences.

After Glaucon's speech, [[Adeimantus of Collytus|Adeimantus]] adds that, in this thought experiment, the unjust should not fear any sort of divine judgement in the afterlife, since the very poets who wrote about such judgement also wrote that the gods would grant forgiveness to those humans who made ample religious sacrifice. Adeimantus demonstrates his reason by drawing two detailed portraits, that the unjust man could grow wealthy by injustice, devoting a percentage of this gain to religious sacrifices, thus rendering him innocent in the eyes of the gods.

Socrates suggests that they look for justice in a city rather than in an individual man. After attributing the origin of society to the individual not being self-sufficient and having many needs which he cannot supply himself, they go on to describe the development of the city. Socrates first describes the "healthy state", but Glaucon asks him to describe "a city of pigs", as he finds little difference between the two. He then goes on to describe the luxurious city, which he calls "a fevered state".&lt;ref name="PlatoFowler1977"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Plato|author2=Harold North Fowler|author3=Paul Shorey|title=Plato in Twelve Volumes|url=http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0059.tlg030.perseus-eng1:2.372d|volume=5-6|year=1977|publisher=W. Heinemann|isbn=978-0-674-99040-1|location=372d}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires a guardian class to defend and attack on its account. This begins a discussion concerning the type of education that ought to be given to these guardians in their early years, including the topic of what kind of stories are appropriate.  They conclude that stories that ascribe evil to the gods are untrue and should not be taught.

====Book III====
Socrates and his companions Adeimantus and Glaucon conclude their discussion concerning education. Socrates breaks the educational system into two. They suggest that guardians should  be educated in these four virtues: wisdom, courage, justice and temperance. They also suggest that the second part of the guardians' education should be in gymnastics. With physical training they will be able to live without needing frequent medical attention: physical training will help prevent illness and weakness. Socrates asserts that both male and female guardians be given the same education, that all wives and children be shared, and that they be prohibited from owning private property.

====Book IV====
Socrates and his companions conclude their discussion concerning the lifestyle of the guardians, thus concluding their initial assessment of the city as a whole. Socrates assumes each person will be happy engaging in the occupation that suits them best. If the city as a whole is happy, then individuals are happy. In the physical education and diet of the guardians, the emphasis is on moderation, since both poverty and excessive wealth will corrupt them (422a1). Without controlling their education, the city cannot control the future rulers. Socrates says that it is pointless to worry over specific laws, like those pertaining to contracts, since proper education ensures lawful behavior, and poor education causes lawlessness (425a-425c).&lt;ref&gt;Julia Annas, “Law in the Republic” from ''Virtue and Law in Plato and Beyond'', (Oxford Scholarship Online, 2017)

DOI:10.1093/oso/9780198755746.003.0002&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates proceeds to search for wisdom, courage, and temperance in the city, on the grounds that justice will be easier to discern in what remains (427e). They find wisdom among the guardian rulers, courage among the guardian warriors (or auxiliaries), temperance among all classes of the city in agreeing about who should rule and who should be ruled. Finally, Socrates defines justice in the city as the state in which each class performs only its own work, not meddling in the work of the other classes (433b). 

The virtues discovered in the city are then sought in the individual soul. For this purpose, Socrates creates an analogy between the parts of the city and the soul (the city-soul analogy). He argues that psychological conflict points to a divided soul, since a completely unified soul could not behave in opposite ways towards the same object, at the same time, and in the same respect (436b).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Brown|first=Eric|title=Plato's Ethics and Politics in The Republic|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/plato-ethics-politics/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gives examples of possible conflicts between the rational, “spirited,” and appetitive parts of the soul, corresponding to the rulers, auxiliaries, and producing classes in the city. 

Having established the tripartite soul, Socrates defines the virtues of the individual. A person is wise if he is ruled by the part of the soul that knows “what is beneficial for each part and for the whole,” courageous if his spirited part “preserves in the midst of pleasures and pains” the decisions reached by the rational part, and temperate if the three parts agree that the rational part lead (442c-d).&lt;ref&gt;Plato. Plato in Twelve Volumes, Vols. 5 &amp; 6 translated by Paul Shorey. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; They are just if each part of the soul attends to its function and not the function of another. It follows from this definition that one cannot be just if one doesn’t have the other cardinal virtues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Brown|first=Eric|title=Plato's Ethics and Politics in The Republic|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/plato-ethics-politics/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Book V====
Socrates, having to his satisfaction defined the just constitution of both city and psyche, moves to elaborate upon the four unjust constitutions of these. Adeimantus and Polemarchus interrupt, asking Socrates instead first to explain how the sharing of wives and children in the guardian class is to be defined and legislated, a theme first touched on in Book III. Socrates is overwhelmed at their request, categorizing it as three "waves" of attack against which his reasoning must stand firm. These three waves challenge Socrates' claims that 

* both male and female guardians ought to receive the same education
* human reproduction ought to be regulated by the state and all offspring should be ignorant of their actual biological parents
* such a city and its corresponding philosopher-king could actually come to be in the real world.

====Book VI====
Socrates' argument is that in the ideal city, a true philosopher with understanding of forms will facilitate the harmonious co-operation of all the citizens of the city. This philosopher-king must be intelligent, reliable, and willing to lead a simple life. However, these qualities are rarely manifested on their own, and so they must be encouraged through education and the study of The Good. Just as visible objects must be illuminated in order to be seen, so must also be true of objects of knowledge if light is cast on them. Just as light comes from the Sun, so does truth come from goodness. Goodness as the source of truth makes it possible for the mind to know, just as light from the Sun makes the eyes able to see.

====Book VII====
Socrates elaborates upon the immediately preceding Analogies [[Analogy of the Sun|of the Sun]] and of the [[Analogy of the Divided Line|Divided Line]] in the [[Allegory of the Cave]], in which he insists that the psyche must be freed from bondage to the visible/sensible world by making the painful journey into the intelligible world. He continues in the rest of this book by further elaborating upon the curriculum which a would-be philosopher-king must study. This is the origin of the [[quadrivium]]: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music.

Next, they elaborate on the education of the philosopher king. Until age 18, would-be guardians should be engaged in basic intellectual study and physical training, followed by two years of military training. However, a correction is then introduced where the study of gymnastics (martial arts) and warfare - 3 plus 2 years, respectively - are supplanted by philosophy for 5 years instead. Next, they receive ten years of mathematics until age 30, and then five years of [[dialectic]] training. Guardians then spend the next 15 years as leaders, trying to "lead people from the cave". (This refers to "the [[Allegory of the Cave]]") Upon reaching 50, they are fully aware of the form of good, and totally mature and ready to lead.

====Book VIII====
Socrates discusses four unjust constitutions: [[timocracy]], [[oligarchy]], [[democracy]], and [[tyranny]]. He argues that a society will decay and pass through each government in succession, eventually becoming a tyranny, the most unjust regime of all.

The starting point is an imagined, alternate [[aristocracy]] (ruled by a philosopher-king); a just government dominated by the wisdom-loving element. When its social structure breaks down and enters civil war, it is replaced by timocracy. The timocratic government is dominated by the spirited element, with a ruling class of property-owners consisting of warriors or generals ([[Ancient Sparta]] is an example). As the emphasis on honor is compromised by wealth accumulation, it is replaced by oligarchy. The oligarchic government is dominated by the desiring element, in which the rich are the ruling class. The gap between rich and poor widens, culminating in a revolt by the underclass majority, establishing a democracy. Democracy emphasizes maximum freedom, so power is distributed evenly. It is also dominated by the desiring element, but in an undisciplined, unrestrained way. The populism of the democratic government leads to mob rule, fueled by fear of oligarchy, which a clever demagogue can exploit to take power and establish tyranny. In a tyrannical government, the city is enslaved to the tyrant, who uses his guards to remove the best social elements and individuals from the city to retain power (since they pose a threat), while leaving the worst. He will also provoke warfare to consolidate his position as leader. In this way, tyranny is the most unjust regime of all.

In parallel to this, Socrates considers the individual or soul that corresponds to each of these regimes. He describes how an aristocrat may become weak or detached from political and material affluence, and how his son will respond to this by becoming overly ambitious. The timocrat in turn may be defeated by the courts or vested interests; his son responds by accumulating wealth in order to gain power in society and defend himself against the same predicament, thereby becoming an oligarch. The oligarch's son will grow up with wealth without having to practice thrift or stinginess, and will be tempted and overwhelmed by his desires, so that he becomes democratic, valuing freedom above all.

====Book IX====
Having discussed the tyrannical constitution of a city, Socrates wishes to discuss the tyrannical constitution of a psyche. This is all intended to answer Thrasymachus' first argument in Book I, that the life of the unjust man (here understood as a true tyrant) is more blessed than that of the just man (the philosopher-king).

First, he describes how a tyrannical man develops from a democratic household. The democratic man is torn between tyrannical passions and oligarchic discipline, and ends up in the middle ground: valuing all desires, both good and bad. The tyrant will be tempted in the same way as the democrat, but without an upbringing in discipline or moderation to restrain him. Therefore, his most base desires and wildest passions overwhelm him, and he becomes driven by lust, using force and fraud to take whatever he wants. The tyrant is both a slave to his lusts, and a master to whomever he can enslave.

Because of this, tyranny is the regime with the least freedom and happiness, and the tyrant is most unhappy of all, since the regime and soul correspond. His desires are never fulfilled, and he always must live in fear of his victims. Because the tyrant can only think in terms of servant and master, he has no equals whom he can befriend, and with no friends the tyrant is robbed of freedom. This is the first proof that it is better to be just than unjust. The second proof is derived from the tripartite theory of soul. The wisdom-loving soul is best equipped to judge what is best through reason, and the wise individual judges wisdom to be best, then honor, then desire. This is the just proportion for the city or soul and stands opposite to tyranny, which is entirely satiated on base desires. The third proof follows from this. He describes how the soul can be misled into experiencing false pleasure: for example, a lack of pain can seem pleasurable by comparison to a worse state. True pleasure is had by being fulfilled by things that fit one's nature. Wisdom is the most fulfilling and is the best guide, so the only way for the three drives of the soul to function properly and experience the truest pleasure is by allowing wisdom to lead. To conclude the third proof, the wisdom element is best at providing pleasure, while tyranny is worst because it is furthest  removed from wisdom.

Finally, Socrates considers the multiple of how much worse tyranny is than the kingly/disciplined/wise temperament, and even quantifies the tyrant as living 729 times more painfully/less joyfully than the king. He then gives the example of a chimera to further illustrate justice and the tripartite soul.

The discussion concludes by refuting Thrasymachus' argument and designating the most blessed life as that of the just man and the most miserable life as that of the unjust man.

====Book X====
Concluding a theme brought up most explicitly in the Analogies of the Sun and Divided Line in Book VI, Socrates finally rejects any form of imitative art and concludes that such artists have no place in the just city. He continues on to argue for the immortality of the psyche and even espouses a theory of reincarnation. He finishes by detailing the rewards of being just, both in this life and the next. Artists create things but they are only different copies of the idea of the original. 
"And whenever any one informs us that he has found a man who knows all the arts, and all things else that anybody knows, and every single thing with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man—whoever tells us this, I think that we can only imagine to be a simple creature who is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met, and whom he thought all-knowing, because he himself was unable to analyze the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation."&lt;ref name="The Republic Book X"&gt;''The Republic'', Book X&lt;/ref&gt;

"And the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water, and crooked when in the water; and the concave becomes convex, owing to the illusion about colours to which the sight is liable. Thus every sort of confusion is revealed within us; and this is that weakness of the human mind on which the art of conjuring and deceiving by light and shadow and other ingenous devices imposes, having an effect upon us like magic."&lt;ref name="The Republic Book X"/&gt;

He speaks about illusions and confusion. Things can look very similar, but be different in reality. Because we are human, at times we cannot tell the difference between the two.

"And does not the same hold also of the ridiculous? There are jests which you would be ashamed to make yourself, and yet on the comic stage, or indeed in private, when you hear them, you are greatly amused by them, and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness—the case of pity is repeated—there is a principle in human nature which is disposed to raise a laugh, and this which you once restrained by reason, because you were afraid of being thought a buffoon, is now let out again; and having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre, you are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet at home."

With all of us, we may approve of something, as long we are not directly involved with it. If we joke about it, we are supporting it.

"Quite true, he said. 
And the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections, of desire and pain and pleasure, which are held to be inseparable from every action—in all of them poetry feeds and waters the passions instead of drying them up; she lets them rule, although they ought to be controlled, if mankind are ever to increase in happiness and virtue."&lt;ref name="The Republic Book X"/&gt;

Sometimes we let our passions rule our actions or way of thinking, although they should be controlled, so that we can increase our happiness.

===Scholarly views===
[[File:P. Oxy. LII 3679.jpg|thumb|P. Oxy. 3679, manuscript from the 3rd century AD, containing fragments of Plato's Republic.]]
Three interpretations of the ''Republic'' are presented in the following section; they are not exhaustive in their treatments of the work, but are examples of contemporary interpretation.

====Bertrand Russell====
In his ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'' (1945), [[Bertrand Russell]] identifies three parts to the ''Republic'':&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell|Russell, Bertrand]], ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]]'', begin of Book I, part 2, ch. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Books I–V: from the attempt to define ''justice'', the description of an ideal community (''eutopia'') and the education of its Guardians;
# Books VI–VII: the nature of [[philosopher]]s, the ideal rulers of such a community;
# Books VIII–X: the pros and cons of various practical [[form of government|forms of government]].

The core of the second part is the [[Allegory of the Cave]] and the discussion of the [[Platonic realism|theory of ideal forms]]. The third part concerns the [[Five Regimes]] and is strongly related to the later dialogue ''[[Laws (Plato)|The Laws]]''; and the [[Myth of Er]].

The paradigm of the city—the idea of [[the Good]], the ''Agathon''—has manifold historical embodiments, undertaken by those who have seen the Agathon, and are ordered via the vision. The centerpiece of the ''Republic'', Part II, nos. 2–3, discusses the rule of the philosopher, and the vision of the Agathon with the [[Allegory of the Cave|allegory of the cave]], which is clarified in the [[theory of forms]]. The centerpiece is preceded and followed by the discussion of the means that will secure a well-ordered ''[[polis]]'' (City). Part II, no. 1, concerns marriage, the community of people and goods for the guardians, and the restraints on warfare among the Hellenes. It describes a partially [[Communism|communistic]] ''polis''. Part II, no. 4, deals with the philosophical education of the rulers who will preserve the order and character of the city-state.

In part II, the ''Embodiment of the Idea'', is preceded by the establishment of the economic and social orders of a ''polis'' (part I), followed by an analysis (part III) of the decline the order must traverse. The three parts compose the main body of the dialogues, with their discussions of the "paradigm", its embodiment, its genesis, and its decline.

The introduction and the conclusion are the frame for the body of the ''Republic''. The discussion of right order is occasioned by the questions: "Is justice better than injustice?" and "Will an unjust man fare better than a just man?" The introductory question is balanced by the concluding answer: "Justice is preferable to injustice". In turn, the foregoing are framed with the ''Prologue'' (Book I) and the ''Epilogue'' (Book X). The prologue is a short dialogue about the common public ''[[doxai]]'' (opinions) about justice. Based upon faith, and not reason, the ''Epilogue'' describes the new arts and the [[immortality]] of the [[soul]].

==== Leo Strauss ====
[[Leo Strauss]] identified a four-part structure to the ''Republic'',{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} perceiving the dialogues as a drama enacted by particular characters, each with a particular perspective and level of intellect:
 
#Book I: Socrates is forcefully compelled to the house of [[Cephalus (person)|Cephalus]]. Three definitions of justice are presented, all are found lacking.
#Books II–V: [[Glaucon]] and [[Adeimantus of Collytus|Adeimantus]] challenge Socrates to prove why a perfectly just man, perceived by the world as an unjust man, would be happier than the perfectly unjust man who hides his injustice and is perceived by the world as a just man. Their challenge begins and propels the dialogues; in answering the challenge, of the "charge", Socrates reveals his behavior with the young men of Athens, whom he later was convicted of corrupting. Because Glaucon and Adeimantus presume a definition of justice, Socrates digresses; he compels the group's attempt to discover justice, and then answers the question posed to him about the intrinsic value of the just life.
#Books V–VI: The "Just City in Speech" is built from the earlier books, and concerns three critiques of the city. Leo Strauss reported that his student [[Allan Bloom]] identified them as: communism, communism of wives and children, and the rule of philosophers. The "Just City in Speech" stands or falls by these complications.
#Books VII–X: Socrates has "escaped" his captors, having momentarily convinced them that the just man is the happy man, by reinforcing their prejudices. He presents a rationale for political decay, and concludes by recounting [[The Myth of Er]] ("[[everyman]]"), consolation for non-philosophers who fear death.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Topics==

===Definition of justice===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2010}}
In the first book, two definitions of justice are proposed but deemed inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.1.introduction.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive - The Republic by Plato|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning debts owed, and helping friends while harming enemies, are commonsense definitions of justice that, Socrates shows, are inadequate in exceptional situations, and thus lack the rigidity demanded of a [[definition]]. Yet he does not completely reject them, for each expresses a commonsense notion of justice that Socrates will incorporate into his discussion of the just regime in books II through V.

At the end of Book I, Socrates agrees with Polemarchus that justice includes helping friends, but says the just man would never do harm to anybody. Thrasymachus believes that Socrates has done the men present an injustice by saying this and attacks his character and reputation in front of the group, partly because he suspects that Socrates himself does not even believe harming enemies is unjust. Thrasymachus gives his understanding of justice and injustice as "justice is what is advantageous to the stronger, while injustice is to one's own profit and advantage".&lt;ref&gt;Plato. Book I, 344c. Plato Republic. Indianapolis: Hackett, 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates finds this definition unclear and begins to question Thrasymachus. Socrates then asks whether the ruler who makes a mistake by making a law that lessens their well-being, is still a ruler according to that definition. Thrasymachus agrees that no true ruler would make such an error. This agreement allows Socrates to undermine Thrasymachus' strict definition of justice by comparing rulers to people of various professions. Thrasymachus consents to Socrates' assertion that an artist is someone who does his job well, and is a knower of some art, which allows him to complete the job well. In so doing Socrates gets Thrasymachus to admit that rulers who enact a law that does not benefit them firstly, are in the precise sense ''not'' rulers. Thrasymachus gives up, and is silent from then on. Socrates has trapped Thrasymachus into admitting the strong man who makes a mistake is not the strong man in the precise sense, and that some type of knowledge is required to rule perfectly. However, it is far from a satisfactory definition of justice.

At the beginning of Book II, Plato's two brothers challenge Socrates to define justice in the man, and unlike the rather short and simple definitions offered in Book I, their views of justice are presented in two independent speeches. Glaucon's speech reprises Thrasymachus' idea of justice; it starts with the legend of [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]],  who discovered a [[Ring of Gyges|ring]] that gave him the power to become invisible. Glaucon uses this story to argue that no man would be just if he had the opportunity of doing injustice with [[impunity]]. With the power to become invisible, Gyges is able to seduce the queen, murder the king, and take over the kingdom. Glaucon argues that the just as well as the unjust man would do the same if they had the power to get away with injustice exempt from punishment. The only reason that men are just and praise justice is out of fear of being punished for injustice. The law is a product of compromise between individuals who agree not to do injustice to others if others will not do injustice to them. Glaucon says that if people had the power to do injustice without fear of punishment, they would not enter into such an agreement. Glaucon uses this argument to challenge Socrates to defend the position that the unjust life is better than the just life. Adeimantus adds to Glaucon's speech the charge that men are only just for the results that justice brings one fortune, honor, reputation. Adeimantus challenges Socrates to prove that being just is worth something in and of itself, not only as a means to an end.

Socrates says that there is no better topic to debate. In response to the two views of injustice and justice presented by Glaucon and Adeimantus, he claims incompetence, but feels it would be impious to leave justice in such doubt. Thus the ''Republic'' sets out to define [[justice]]. Given the difficulty of this task as proven in Book I, [[Socrates]] in Book II leads his interlocutors into a discussion of justice in the city, which Socrates suggests may help them see justice not only in the person, but on a larger scale, "first in cities searching for what it is; then thusly we could examine also in some individual, examining the likeness of the bigger in the idea of the littler" (368e–369a).&lt;ref&gt;"Suppose that a short-sighted person had been asked by some one to read small letters from a distance; and it occurred to some one else that they might be found in another place which was larger and in which the letters were larger..." (368, trans. Jowett).&lt;/ref&gt;

For over two and a half millennia, scholars have differed on the aptness of the city-soul analogy Socrates uses to find justice in Books II through V.&lt;ref&gt;For an oft-cited argument that the analogy does not work, see T. Penner, “Thought and Desire in Plato.” in G Vlastos ed., Plato, Vol. 2. Anchor Books, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Republic'' is a dramatic dialogue, not a treatise. Socrates' definition of justice is never unconditionally stated, only versions of justice within each city are "found" and evaluated in Books II through Book V. Socrates  constantly refers the definition of justice back to the conditions of the city for which it is created. He builds a series of myths, or [[noble lie]]s, to make the cities appear just, and these conditions moderate life within the communities. The "earth born" myth makes all men believe that they are born from the earth and have predestined natures within their veins. Accordingly, Socrates defines justice as "working at that which he is naturally best suited", and "to do one's own business and not to be a busybody" (433a–433b) and goes on to say that justice sustains and perfects the other three [[cardinal virtues]]: Temperance, Wisdom, and Courage, and that justice is the cause and condition of their existence. Socrates does not include justice as a virtue within the city, suggesting that justice does not exist within the human soul either, rather it is the result of a "well ordered" soul. A result of this conception of justice separates people into three types; that of the soldier, that of the producer, and that of a ruler. If a ruler can create just laws, and if the warriors can carry out the orders of the rulers, and if the producers can obey this authority, then a society will be just.

The city is challenged by Adeimantus and Glaucon throughout its development: Adeimantus cannot find happiness in the city, and Glaucon cannot find honor and glory. This hypothetical city contains no private property, no marriage, or nuclear families. These are sacrificed for the common good and doing what is best fitting to one's nature. In Book V Socrates addresses the question of "natural-ness" of and possibility for this city, concluding in Book VI, that the city's ontological status regards a construction of the soul, not of an actual metropolis.

The rule of [[philosopher-king]]s appear as the issue of possibility is raised. Socrates never positively states what justice is in the human soul/city; it appears he has created a city where justice is not found, but can be lost. It is as though in a well-ordered state, justice is not even needed, since the community satisfies the needs of humans.

In terms of why it is best to be just rather than unjust for the individual, Plato prepares an answer in Book IX consisting of three main arguments.  Plato says that a tyrant's nature will leave him with "horrid pains and pangs" and that the typical tyrant engages in a lifestyle that will be physically and mentally exacting on such a ruler.  Such a disposition is in contrast to the truth-loving [[philosopher king]], and a tyrant "never tastes of true freedom or friendship".  The second argument proposes that of all the different types of people, only the philosopher is able to judge which type of ruler is best since only he can see the [[Form of the Good]].  Thirdly, Plato argues, "Pleasures which are approved of by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest." In sum, Plato argues that philosophical pleasure is the only true pleasure since other pleasures experienced by others are simply a neutral state free of pain.

Socrates points out the human tendency to be corrupted by power leads down the road to [[timocracy]], [[oligarchy]], [[democracy]] and [[tyranny]]. From this, he concludes that ruling should be left to philosophers, who are the most just and therefore least susceptible to corruption. This "good city" is depicted as being governed by philosopher-kings; disinterested persons who rule not for their personal enjoyment but for the good of the city-state (polis). The paradigmatic society which stands behind every historical society is hierarchical, but social classes have a marginal permeability; there are no slaves, no discrimination between men and women. The men and women are both to be taught the same things, so they are both able to be used for the same things (451e). In addition to the ruling class of guardians ([[:wiktionary:φύλακες|φύλακες]]), which abolished riches, there is a class of private producers (demiourgoi), who may be rich or poor. A number of provisions aim to avoid making the people weak: the substitution of a universal educational system for men and women instead of debilitating music, poetry and theatre—a startling departure from Greek society. These provisions apply to all classes, and the restrictions placed on the philosopher-kings chosen from the warrior class and the warriors are much more severe than those placed on the producers, because the rulers must be kept away from any source of corruption.

In Books V-VI the abolition of riches among the guardian class (not unlike Max Weber's bureaucracy) leads controversially to the abandonment of the typical family, and as such no child may know his or her parents and the parents may not know their own children. Socrates tells a tale which is the "allegory of the good government". The rulers assemble couples for reproduction, based on breeding criteria. Thus, stable population is achieved through eugenics and social cohesion is projected to be high because familial links are extended towards everyone in the city. Also the education of the youth is such that they are taught of only works of writing that encourage them to improve themselves for the state's good, and envision (the) god(s) as entirely good, just, and the author(s) of only that which is good.

In Books VII-X stand Plato's criticism of the forms of government. It begins with the dismissal of timocracy, a sort of authoritarian regime, not unlike a military dictatorship. Plato offers an almost psychoanalytical explanation of the "timocrat" as one who saw his father humiliated by his mother and wants to vindicate "manliness". The third worst regime is oligarchy, the rule of a small band of rich people, millionaires that only respect money. Then comes the democratic form of government, and its susceptibility to being ruled by unfit "sectarian" demagogues. Finally the worst regime is tyranny, where the whimsical desires of the ruler became law and there is no check upon arbitrariness.

===Theory of universals===
{{see also|Problem of universals|Allegory of the Cave|Theory of Forms}}

The ''Republic'' contains Plato's [[Allegory of the Cave|''Allegory of the cave'']] with which he explains his concept of [[The Forms]] as an answer to the [[problem of universals]].

The allegory of the cave primarily depicts Plato's distinction between the world of appearances and the 'real' world of the Forms,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Silverman|first=Allan|title=Plato's Middle Period Metaphysics and Epistemology|date=2014|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/plato-metaphysics/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2014|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as helping to justify the philosopher's place in society as king. Plato imagines a group of people who have lived their entire lives as prisoners, chained to the wall of a cave in the subterranean so they are unable to see the outside world behind them. However a constant flame illuminates various moving objects outside, which are silhouetted on the wall of the cave visible to the prisoners. These prisoners, through having no other experience of reality, ascribe forms to these shadows such as either "dog" or "cat".

Plato then goes on to explain how the philosopher is akin to a prisoner who is freed from the cave. The prisoner is initially blinded by the light, but when he adjusts to the brightness he sees the fire and the statues and how they caused the images witnessed inside the cave. He sees that the fire and statues in the cave were just copies of the real objects; merely imitations. This is analogous to the Forms. What we see from day to day are merely appearances, reflections of the Forms. The philosopher, however, will not be deceived by the shadows and will hence be able to see the 'real' world, the world above that of appearances; the philosopher will gain knowledge of things in themselves. In this analogy the sun is representative of the Good. This is the main object of the philosopher's knowledge. The Good can be thought of as the form of Forms, or the structuring of the world as a whole.

The prisoner's stages of understanding correlate with the levels on the [[The divided line of Plato|divided line]] which he imagines. The line is divided into what the visible world is and what the intelligible world is, with the divider being the Sun. When the prisoner is in the cave, he is obviously in the visible realm that receives no sunlight, and outside he comes to be in the intelligible realm.

The shadows witnessed in the cave correspond to the lowest level on Plato's line, that of imagination and conjecture. Once the prisoner is freed and sees the shadows for what they are he reaches the second stage on the divided line, the stage of belief, for he comes to believe that the statues in the cave are real. On leaving the cave, however, the prisoner comes to see objects more real than the statues inside of the cave, and this correlates with the third stage on Plato's line, thought. Lastly, the prisoner turns to the sun which he grasps as the source of truth, or the Form of the Good, and this last stage, named as dialectic, is the highest possible stage on the line. The prisoner, as a result of the Form of the Good, can begin to understand all other forms in reality.

At the end of this allegory, Plato asserts that it is the philosopher's burden to reenter the cave. Those who have seen the ideal world, he says, have the duty to educate those in the material world. Since the philosopher recognizes what is truly good only he is fit to rule society according to Plato.

===The dialectical forms of government===
{{Main article|Plato's five regimes}}

While Plato spends much of the ''Republic'' having Socrates narrate a conversation about the city he founds with Glaucon and Adeimantus "in speech", the discussion eventually turns to considering four regimes that exist in reality and tend to degrade successively into each other: timocracy, oligarchy (also called plutocracy), democracy and tyranny (also called despotism).

'''Timocracy'''

Socrates defines a [[timocracy]] as a government of people who love rule and honor. Socrates argues that the timocracy emerges from aristocracy due to a civil war breaking out among the ruling class and the majority. Over time, many more births will occur to people who lack aristocratic, guardian qualities, slowly drawing the populace away from knowledge, music, poetry and "guardian education", toward money-making and the acquisition of possessions. This civil war between those who value wisdom and those who value material acquisition will continue until a compromise is reached. The timocracy values war insofar as it satisfies a love of victory and honor. The timocratic man loves physical training, and hunting, and values his abilities in warfare.

'''Oligarchy'''

Temptations create a confusion between economic status and honor which is responsible for the emergence of [[oligarchy]]. In Book VIII, Socrates suggests that wealth will not help a pilot to navigate his ship, as his concerns will be directed centrally toward increasing his wealth by whatever means, rather than seeking out wisdom or honor. The injustice of economic disparity divides the rich and the poor, thus creating an environment for criminals and beggars to emerge. The rich are constantly plotting against the poor and vice versa. The oligarchic constitution is based on property assessment and wealth qualification. Unlike the timocracy, oligarchs are also unable to fight war, since they do not wish to arm the majority for fear of their rising up against them (fearing the majority even more than their enemies), nor do they seem to pay mercenaries, since they are reluctant to spend money.

'''Democracy'''

As this socioeconomic divide grows, so do tensions between social classes. From the conflicts arising out of such tensions, the poor majority overthrow the wealthy minority, and [[democracy]] replaces the oligarchy preceding it. The poor overthrow the oligarchs and grant liberties and freedoms to citizens, creating a most variegated collection of peoples under a "supermarket" of constitutions. A visually appealing [[demagogue]] is soon lifted up to protect the interests of the lower class. However, with too much freedom, no requirements for anyone to rule, and having no interest in assessing the background of their rulers (other than honoring such people because they wish the majority well) the people become easily persuaded by such a demagogue's appeal to try and satisfy people's common, base, and unnecessary pleasures.

'''Tyranny'''

The excessive freedoms granted to the citizens of a democracy ultimately leads to a [[tyranny]], the furthest regressed type of government.  These freedoms divide the people into three socioeconomic classes: the dominating class, the elites and the commoners.  Tensions between the dominating class and the elites cause the commoners to seek out protection of their democratic liberties.  They invest all their power in their democratic demagogue, who, in turn, becomes corrupted by the power and becomes a tyrant with a small entourage of his supporters for protection and absolute control of his people.

==Reception and interpretation==

===Ancient Greece===
The idea of writing treatises on systems of government was followed some decades later by Plato's most prominent pupil [[Aristotle]], whose [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politika'']] systematises many of Plato's concepts, in some cases differing from his conclusions.

It has been suggested that [[Isocrates]] parodies the ''Republic'' in his work ''[[Busiris (Greek mythology)|Busiris]]'' by showing Callipolis' similarity to the Egyptian state founded by a king of that name.&lt;ref&gt;Most recently, Niall Livingstone, ''A Commentary on Isocrates' Busiris''. ''Mnemosyne Supplement'' 223. Leiden:  Brill, 2001 (see review by David C. Mirhady in [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2004/2004-09-37.html Bryn Mawr Classical Review]). For earlier consideration of the similarities, see H. Thesleff, ''Studies in Platonic Chronology'', Helsinki 1982, pp. 105f., and C. Eucken, ''Isokrates'', Berlin 1983, pp. 172 ff. Both Thesleff and Eucken entertain the possibility that Isocrates was responding to an earlier version of ''Republic'' than the final version we possess.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zeno of Citium]], the founder of [[Stoicism]], wrote his own imitation of Plato's ''Republic'', c. 300 BC. ''[[The Republic (Zeno)|Zeno's Republic]]'' advocates a form of [[anarchism]] in which all of the citizens are philosophers, and advocates a more radical form of sexual communism than that proposed by Plato.

===Ancient Rome===

====Cicero====
The English title of Plato's dialogue is derived from [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De re publica]]'', written some three centuries later. Cicero's dialogue imitates Plato's style and treats many of the same topics, and Cicero's main character [[Scipio Africanus Minor|Scipio Africanus]] expresses his esteem for Plato and Socrates.

''Res publica'' is not an exact translation of Plato's Greek title ''politeia''. Rather, ''politeia'' is a general term for the actual and potential forms of government for a ''Polis'' or city-state, and Plato attempts to survey all possible forms of the state. Cicero's discussion is more parochial, focusing on the improvement of the participants' own state, the [[Roman Republic]] in its final stages.

====Tacitus====
In antiquity, Plato's works were largely acclaimed, but a few commentators regarded them as too theoretical. [[Tacitus]], commented on such works as ''The Republic'' and [[Politics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's ''Politics'']] in his ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Ann.]]'' (IV, 33):
{|-
|-
|&amp;nbsp;
|valign="top"|''Nam cunctas nationes et urbes populus aut primores aut singuli regunt: delecta ex iis (his) et consociata (constituta) rei publicae forma laudari facilius quam evenire, vel si evenit, haud diuturna esse potest.''
|&amp;nbsp;
|valign="top"|Indeed, a nation or city is ruled by the people, or by an upper class, or by a monarch. A government system that is invented [[Mixed government|from a choice of these same components]] is sooner idealised than realised; and even if realised, there will be no future for it.
|}
In this work, Tacitus undertakes the prosaic description and minute analysis of how real states are governed, attempting to derive more practical lessons about good versus bad governance than can be deduced from speculations on ideal governments.

====Augustine====
In the pivotal era of Rome's move from its ancient [[polytheism|polytheist]] religion to Christianity, [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] wrote his magnum opus ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'': Again, the references to Plato, Aristotle and Cicero and their visions of the ideal state were legion: Augustine equally described a model of the "ideal city", in his case the eternal [[Jerusalem]], using a visionary language not unlike that of the preceding philosophers.

===Islam===
Islamic philosophers were much more interested in Aristotle than Plato, but not having access to Aristotle's [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']], Ibn Rushd ([[Averroes]]) produced instead a commentary on
Plato's ''Republic''. He advances an authoritarian ideal, following Plato's paternalistic model. Absolute monarchy, led by a philosopher-king, creates a justly ordered society. This requires extensive use of coercion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=Antony|title=The History of Islamic Political Thought|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|edition=2nd|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7486-3987-8|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; although persuasion is preferred and is possible if the young are properly raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Fakhry |first=Majid |title=Averroes (Ibn Rushd) His Life, Works and Influence |publisher=[[Oneworld Publications]] |year=2001| p=106 |isbn=978-1-85168-269-0 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhetoric, not logic, is the appropriate road to truth for the common man. Demonstrative knowledge via philosophy and logic requires special study. Rhetoric aids religion in reaching the masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.neh.gov/humanities/2011/novemberdecember/feature/the-islamic-scholar-who-gave-us-modern-philosophy|title=The Islamic Scholar Who Gave Us Modern Philosophy|journal=Humanities|author=Robert Pasnau|volume=32|number=6|date=Nov–Dec 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Plato, Ibn Rushd accepts the principle of women's equality. They should be educated and allowed to serve in the military; the best among them might be tomorrow's philosophers or rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Averroës|first=Erwin I.J.|last=Rosenthal|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc.|date=2017-12-26|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Averroes|ref=harv}|p=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citation|Fakhry|2001|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also accepts Plato's illiberal measures such as the censorship of literature. He uses examples from Arab history to illustrate just and degenerate political orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citation|Fakhry|2001|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hegel===
[[Hegel]] respected Plato's theories of state and ethics much more than those of the early modern philosophers such as [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Hobbes]] and [[Rousseau]], whose theories proceeded from a fictional "[[state of nature]]" defined by humanity's "natural" needs, desires and freedom.  For Hegel this was a contradiction: since nature and the individual are contradictory, the  freedoms which define individuality as such are latecomers on the stage of history.  Therefore, these philosophers unwittingly projected man as an individual in modern society onto a primordial state of nature.  Plato however had managed to grasp the ideas specific to his time:

{{Quotation|Plato is not the man to dabble in abstract theories and principles; his truth-loving mind has recognized and represented the truth of the world in which he lived, the truth of the one spirit that lived in him as in Greece itself.  No man can overleap his time, the spirit of his time is his spirit also; but the point at issue is, to recognize that spirit by its content.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, "Lectures on the Philosophy of History", vol II, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For Hegel, Plato's Republic is not an abstract theory or ideal which is too good for the real nature of man, but rather is not ideal enough, not good enough for the ideals already inherent or nascent in the reality of his time; a time when Greece was entering decline. One such nascent idea was about to crush the Greek way of life: modern freedoms—or Christian freedoms in Hegel's view—such as the individual's choice of his social class, or of what property to pursue, or which career to follow. Such individual freedoms were excluded from Plato's Republic:

{{Quotation|Plato recognized and caught up the true spirit of his times, and brought it forward in a more definite way, in that he desired to make this new principle an impossibility in his Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, "Lectures on the Philosophy of History", vol II, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Greece being at a crossroads, Plato's new "constitution" in the ''Republic'' was an attempt to preserve Greece: it was a reactionary reply to the new freedoms of private property etc., that were eventually given legal form through Rome. Accordingly, in ethical life, it was an attempt to introduce a religion that elevated each individual not as an owner of property, but as the possessor of an immortal soul.

===20th century===

====Gadamer====
In his 1934 ''Plato und die Dichter'' (''Plato and the Poets''), as well as several other works, [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] describes the utopic city of the ''Republic'' as a [[heuristic]] [[utopia]] that should not be pursued or even be used as an orientation-point for political development. Rather, its purpose is said to be to show how things would have to be connected, and how one thing would lead to another—often with highly problematic results—if one would opt for certain principles and carry them through rigorously. This interpretation argues that large passages in Plato's writing are [[irony|ironic]], a line of thought initially pursued by [[Kierkegaard]].

====Popper====
The city portrayed in the ''Republic'' struck some critics as harsh, rigid, and unfree; indeed, as [[totalitarian]]. [[Karl Popper]] gave a voice to that view in his 1945 book ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', where he singled out Plato's state as a dystopia. Popper divorced Plato's ideas from those of Socrates, claiming that the former in his later years expressed none of the [[humanitarian]] and [[democracy|democratic]] tendencies of his teacher. In particular, Popper accuses Plato of betraying Socrates. [[Gilbert Ryle]], reviewing Popper's text just two years after its publication&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=G. |last=Ryle |authorlink=Gilbert Ryle |title=Popper, K.R. - ''The Open Society and its Enemies'' |journal=[[Mind (journal)|Mind]] |date=1 April 1947 |volume=56 |issue=222 |page=167–172 |doi=10.1093/mind/LVI.222.167 |jstor=2250518}}&lt;/ref&gt; and agreeing with him, wrote that Plato "was Socrates' Judas."&lt;ref&gt;Ryle, G. (1947). p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=EgIxAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22was+Socrates'+Judas%22 169]. See also: {{cite book |first=T.E. |last= Burke |title=The Philosophy of Popper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rIK7AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=1983 |publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |location=Manchester |isbn=978-0-71900911-2 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rIK7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=141&amp;dq=%22As+Gilbert+Ryle+put+it,+according+to+Popper,+Plato+was+Socrates'+Judas.+The+very+things+for+which+Socrates+lived+and+died+are+the+things+which+Plato+tries+to+demolish+with+words+put+into+Socrates'+mouth%22 141]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper thought Plato's envisioned state totalitarian as it advocated a government composed only of a distinct hereditary ruling class, with the working class—who Popper argues Plato regards as "human cattle"—given no role in decision making. He argues that Plato has no interest in what are commonly regarded as the problems of justice—the resolving of disputes between individuals—because Plato has redefined justice as "keeping one's place".&lt;ref name="popper"&gt;[[Karl Popper|Popper, Karl]] (1950) ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]], Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato'', New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Voegelin====
[[Eric Voegelin]] in ''Plato and Aristotle'' (Baton Rouge, 1957), gave  meaning to the concept of 'Just City in Speech' (Books II-V). For instance, there is evidence in the dialogue that [[Socrates]] himself would not be a member of his 'ideal' state. His life was almost solely dedicated to the private pursuit of [[knowledge]]. More practically, Socrates suggests that members of the lower classes could rise to the higher ruling class, and vice versa, if they had 'gold' in their veins—a version of the concept of [[social mobility]]. The exercise of power is built on the '[[noble lie]]' that all men are brothers, born of the earth, yet there is a clear hierarchy and class divisions. There is a tripartite explanation of human psychology that is extrapolated to the city, the relation among peoples. There is no [[family]] among the guardians, another crude version of [[Max Weber|Max Weber's]] concept of [[bureaucracy]] as the state non-private concern. Together with Leo Strauss, Voegelin considered Popper's interpretation to be a gross misunderstanding not only of the dialogue itself, but of the very nature and character of Plato's entire philosophic enterprise.

====Strauss and Bloom====

Some of [[Plato]]'s proposals have led theorists like [[Leo Strauss]] and [[Allan Bloom]] to ask readers to consider the possibility that [[Socrates]] was creating not a blueprint for a real city, but a learning exercise for the young men in the dialogue. There are many points in the construction of the "Just City in Speech" that seem [[contradictory]], which raise the possibility Socrates is employing [[irony]] to make the men in the dialogue question for themselves the ultimate value of the proposals. In turn, [[Plato]] has immortalized this 'learning exercise' in the ''Republic''.

One of many examples is that Socrates calls the marriages of the ruling class '[[sacred]]'; however, they last only one night and are the result of manipulating and drugging couples into predetermined intercourse with the aim of eugenically breeding guardian-warriors. Strauss and Bloom's interpretations, however, involve more than just pointing out inconsistencies; by calling attention to these issues they ask readers to think more deeply about whether Plato is being ironic or genuine, for neither Strauss nor Bloom present an unequivocal opinion, preferring to raise philosophic doubt over interpretive fact.

Leo Strauss's approach developed out of a belief that [[Plato]] wrote esoterically. The basic acceptance of the [[exoteric]]-[[esoteric]] distinction revolves around whether Plato really wanted to see the "Just City in Speech" of Books V-VI come to pass, or whether it is just an [[allegory]]. Strauss never regarded this as the crucial issue of the dialogue. He argued against Karl Popper's literal view, citing [[Cicero]]'s opinion that the ''Republic's'' true nature was to bring to light the nature of political things.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Political Philosophy'', co-editor with Joseph Cropsey, 3rd. ed., Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Strauss undermines the justice found in the "Just City in Speech" by implying the city is not natural, it is a man-made conceit that abstracts away from the erotic needs of the body. The city founded in the ''Republic'' "is rendered possible by the abstraction from eros".&lt;ref&gt;''History of Political Philosophy'', co-editor with Joseph Cropsey, 3rd. ed., Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;

An argument that has been used against ascribing ironic intent to Plato is that [[Plato's Academy]] produced a number of [[tyrant]]s who seized political power and abandoned philosophy for ruling a city. Despite being well-versed in Greek and having direct contact with Plato himself, some of Plato's former students like [[Clearchus of Heraclea|Clearchus]], tyrant of [[Heraclea Pontica|Heraclea]]; [[Chaeron of Pellene|Chaeron]], tyrant of [[Pellene]]; [[Erastus of Scepsis|Erastus]] and [[Coriscus of Scepsis|Coriscus]], tyrants of [[Skepsis]]; [[Hermias of Atarneus]] and [[Assos]]; and [[Calippus of Syracuse|Calippus]], tyrant of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] ruled people and did not impose anything like a philosopher-kingship. However, it can be argued whether these men became "tyrants" through studying in the Academy. Plato's school had an elite student body, some of whom would by birth, and family expectation, end up in the seats of power. Additionally, it is important to remember that it is by no means obvious that these men were tyrants in the modern, [[totalitarian]] sense of the concept.  Finally, since very little is actually known about what was taught at Plato's Academy, there is no small controversy over whether it was even in the business of teaching politics at all.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Schofield, "Plato and Practical Politics", in C. Rowe and M. Schofield (eds.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Greek and Roman Political Thought'', Cambridge University Press 2005, pp. 293-302.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Views on the city–soul analogy====
Many critics, both ancient and modern (like [[Julia Annas]]), have suggested that the dialogue's political discussion actually serves as an analogy for the individual soul, in which there are also many different "members" that can either conflict or else be integrated and orchestrated under a just and productive "government." Among other things, this analogical reading would solve the problem of certain implausible statements Plato makes concerning an ideal political republic. In a definitive treatment of the subject, Blössner (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Blössner, Norbert. The City-Soul Analogy, G. R. F. Ferrari (Translator). In: G. R. F. Ferrari (Ed.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Plato's Republic'', Cambridge University Press, 2007. (Ch. 13; pp. 345–385).&lt;/ref&gt; presents and argues for the case that the ''Republic'' is best understood as an analysis of the workings and moral improvement of the individual soul with remarkable thoroughness and clarity. This view, of course, does not preclude a legitimate reading of the ''Republic'' as a political treatise (the work could operate at both levels). It merely implies that it deserves more attention as a work on psychology and moral philosophy than it has sometimes received.

====Practicality====
The above-mentioned views have in common that they view the ''Republic'' as a theoretical work, not as a set of guidelines for [[good governance]]. However, Popper insists that the Republic, "was meant by its author not so much as a theoretical treatise, but as a topical political manifesto"&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl (1950) The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato, New York: Routledge. p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bertrand Russell]] argues that at least in ''intent'', and all in all not so far from what was possible in ancient Greek city-states, the form of government portrayed in the ''Republic'' was meant as a practical one by Plato.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, B. (2004) ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]]'', end of Book I, part 2, ch. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===

One of Plato's recurring techniques in the ''Republic'' is to refine the concept of justice with reference to various examples of greater or lesser injustice.  However, in ''The Concept of Injustice'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Concept of Injustice'' (Routledge, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Heinze]] challenges the assumption that 'justice' and 'injustice' form a mutually exclusive pair.  Heinze argues that such an assumption traces not from strict deductive logic, but from the arbitrary etymology of the word 'injustice'.   Heinze critiques what he calls 'classical' Western justice theory for having perpetuated that logical error, which first appears in Plato's ''Republic'', but manifests throughout traditional political philosophy, in thinkers otherwise as different as [[Aristotle]], [[Aquinas]], Locke, [[Rousseau]], [[Hegel]] and [[Marx]].

In 2001, a survey of over 1,000 academics and students voted the ''Republic'' the greatest philosophical text ever written. [[Julian Baggini]] argued that although the work "was wrong on almost every point, the questions it raises and the methods it uses are essential to the western tradition of philosophy. Without it we might not have philosophy as we know it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/sep/07/books.humanities |title=The thinking person's favourite thinkers  |last=Gibbons |first=Fiachra |date=September 7, 2001 |accessdate=March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fiction, [[Jo Walton]]'s 2015 novel ''[[The Just City]]'' explored the consequences of establishing a city-state based on the ''Republic'' in practice.

==Place in Plato's corpus==
The ''Republic'' is generally placed in the ''[[Plato#Dialogues|middle period]]'' of Plato's dialogues—that is, it is believed to be written after the ''early period'' dialogues but before the ''late period'' dialogues.  However, the distinction of this group from the early dialogues is not as clear as the distinction of the late dialogues from all the others.  Nonetheless, Ritter, Arnim, and Baron—with their separate methodologies—all agreed that the ''Republic'' was well distinguished, along with ''Parmenides'', ''Phaedrus'' and ''Theaetetus''.&lt;ref&gt;Brandwood, Leonard, ''The Chronology of Plato's Dialogues'' (Cambridge University Press, 1990), p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the first book of the ''Republic'', which shares many features with earlier dialogues, is thought to have originally been written as a separate work, and then the remaining books were conjoined to it, perhaps with modifications to the original of the first book.&lt;ref&gt;Brandwood (1990), p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fragments==
Several [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]] fragments were found to contain parts of the Republic, and from other works such as [[Phaedo]], or the dialogue [[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]], written around 200-300 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/oxyrhynchuspapyr15gren#page/186/mode/2up/search/plato|title=The Oxyrhynchus papyri|authors=Bernard Pyne Grenfell and Arthur Surridge Hunt|year=1898|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fragments of a different version of Plato's Republic were discovered in 1945, part of the [[Nag Hammadi library]], written ca. 350 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mountainman.com.au/essenes/plato_at_nag_hammadi.htm|title=Plato's Republic at Nag Hammadi c.350 CE|author=Mountain Man Graphics}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings highlight the influence of Plato during those times in Egypt.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6353">In the theory of [[renewal process]]es, a part of the mathematical theory of probability, the '''residual time''' or the '''forward recurrence time''' is the time between any given time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and the next [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] of the renewal process under consideration. In the context of random walks, it is also known as '''overshoot'''. Another way to phrase residual time is "how much longer time is there to wait?". 

The residual time is very important in most of the practical applications of renewal processes:
* In [[queueing theory]], it determines the remaining time, that a newly arriving customer to a non-empty queue has to wait until being served.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Stewart, "Probability, Markov Chains, Queues, and Simulation: The Mathematical Basis of Performance Modeling", Princeton University Press, 2011, {{ISBN|1-4008-3281-0}}, 9781400832811&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[wireless networking]], it determines, for example, the remaining lifetime of a wireless link on arrival of a new packet.
* In [[dependability]] studies, it models the remaining lifetime of a component.
* etc.

== Formal definition ==
[[File:Renewal process.reetep.png|thumb|right|350px|Sample evolution of a renewal process with ''holding times'' ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and jump times ''J&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.]]
Consider a renewal process &lt;math&gt;\{N(t),t\geq0\}&lt;/math&gt;, with ''holding times'' &lt;math&gt;S_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and ''jump times'' (or renewal epochs) &lt;math&gt;J_{i}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;i\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. The holding times &lt;math&gt;S_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are non-negative, independent, identically distributed random variables and the renewal process is defined as &lt;math&gt;N(t) = \sup\{n: J_{n} \leq t\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then, to a given time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, there corresponds uniquely an &lt;math&gt;N(t)&lt;/math&gt;, such that:

:&lt;math&gt;J_{N(t)} \leq t &lt; J_{N(t)+1}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

The '''residual time''' (or excess time) is given by the time &lt;math&gt;Y(t)&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; to the next renewal epoch.

:&lt;math&gt;Y(t) = J_{N(t)+1} - t. \,&lt;/math&gt;

== Probability distribution of the residual time ==
Let the [[cumulative distribution function]] of the holding times &lt;math&gt;S_{i}&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;F(t) = Pr[S_{i} \leq t]&lt;/math&gt; and recall that the [[Renewal theory#Properties of renewal processes and renewal-reward processes|renewal function]] of a process is &lt;math&gt;m(t) = \mathbb{E}[N(t)]&lt;/math&gt;. Then, for a given time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the cumulative distribution function of &lt;math&gt;Y(t)&lt;/math&gt; is calculated as:&lt;ref&gt;Jyotiprasad Medhi, "Stochastic processes", New Age International, 1994, {{ISBN|81-224-0549-5}}, 9788122405491&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(x,t) = \Pr[Y(t) \leq x] = F(t+x) - \int_0^t \left[1 - F(t+x-y)\right]dm(y)&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, the probability density function can be written as 
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(x, t) = f(t+x) + \int_0^t f(u+x) m'(t-u) du, &lt;/math&gt;

where we have substituted &lt;math&gt;u = t-y.&lt;/math&gt; From elementary renewal theorem &lt;math&gt;m'(t) \rightarrow 1/\mu&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;. If we consider the limiting distribution as &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;, assuming that &lt;math&gt;f(t) \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;, we have the limiting pdf as

:&lt;math&gt; \phi(x) = \frac{1}{\mu} \int_0^\infty f(u+x) du = \frac{1}{\mu} \int_x^\infty f(v) dv  = \frac{1 - F(x)}{\mu},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the mean of the distribution &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. Likewise, the cumulative distribution of the residual time is 

:&lt;math&gt; \Phi(x) = \frac{1}{\mu} \int_0^x [1 - F(x)] du.&lt;/math&gt;

For large &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the distribution is independent of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, making it a stationary distribution. An interesting fact is that the limiting distribution of forward recurrence time (or residual time) has the same form as the limiting distribution of the backward recurrence time (or age). This distribution is always J-shaped, with mode at zero.

The first two moments of this limiting distribution &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; are:

:&lt;math&gt; E[Y] = \frac{\mu_2}{2\mu} = \frac{\mu^2 + \sigma^2}{2\mu}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; E[Y^2] = \frac{\mu_3}{3\mu}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt; is the variance of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_3&lt;/math&gt; are its second and third moments. 

=== Waiting time paradox ===
The fact that &lt;math&gt; E[Y] = \frac{\mu^2 + \sigma^2}{2\mu} &gt; \frac{\mu}{2}, &lt;/math&gt; is also known variously as the waiting time paradox, inspection paradox, or the paradox of renewal theory. The paradox arises from the fact that the average waiting time for to the next renewal, assuming that the reference time point &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is uniform randomly selected within the inter-renewal interval, is larger than the average inter-renewal interval &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mu}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. The average waiting is &lt;math&gt;E[Y] = \frac{\mu}{2}&lt;/math&gt; only when &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, that is when the renewals are always punctual or deterministic.

=== Special case: Markovian holding times ===
When the holding times &lt;math&gt;S_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are exponentially distributed with &lt;math&gt;F(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;, the residual times are also exponentially distributed. That is because &lt;math&gt;m(t) = \lambda t&lt;/math&gt; and:

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr[Y(t) \leq x] = \left[1-e^{-\lambda(t+x)}\right] - \int_0^t \left[1 - 1+e^{-\lambda(t+x-y)}\right]d(\lambda y) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is a known characteristic of the [[exponential distribution]], i.e., its [[Exponential distribution#Memorylessness|memoryless property]]. Intuitively, this means that it does not matter how long it has been since the last renewal epoch, the remaining time is still probabilistically the same as in the beginning of the holding time interval.

== Related notions ==
Renewal theory texts usually also define the '''spent time''' or the '''backward recurrence time''' (or the current lifetime) as &lt;math&gt;Z(t) = t - J_{N(t)}&lt;/math&gt;. Its distribution can be calculated in a similar way to that of the residual time. Likewise, the total '''life time''' is the sum of backward recurrence time and forward recurrence time.

[[File:Five senses.jpg|thumb|318x318px|Five Aristotelian senses and their respective sensory organs inherent among ''[[Homo sapiens]]'']]
[[File:Claesz., Pieter - Still Life with Musical Instruments - 1623.jpg|thumb|270px|An [[allegory]] of five senses. Still Life  by [[Pieter Claesz]], 1623. The painting illustrates the senses through musical instruments, a compass, a book, food and drink, a mirror, [[incense]] and an open perfume bottle. The [[tortoise]] may be an illustration of touch or an allusion to the opposite (the tortoise isolating in its shell).]]

A '''sense''' is a [[physiological]] capacity of [[organism]]s that provides data for [[perception]]. The senses and their operation, classification, and theory are overlapping topics studied by a variety of fields, most notably [[neuroscience]], [[cognitive psychology]] (or [[cognitive science]]), and [[philosophy of perception]]. The [[nervous system]] has a specific [[sensory nervous system]], and a '''sense organ''', or '''sensor''', dedicated to each sense.

Humans have a multitude of sensors. Sight ([[Visual perception|vision]]), hearing ([[Hearing|audition]]), taste ([[taste|gustation]]), smell ([[olfaction]]), and touch ([[Somatosensory system|somatosensation]]) are the five traditionally recognized senses. The ability to detect other stimuli beyond those governed by these most broadly recognized senses also exists, and these [[sensory modalities]] include temperature ([[thermoception]]), kinesthetic sense ([[proprioception]]), pain ([[nociception]]), balance ([[equilibrioception]]), vibration ([[mechanoreceptor|mechanoreception]]), and various internal stimuli (e.g. the different [[chemoreceptor]]s for detecting [[salt]] and [[carbon dioxide]] concentrations in the blood, or sense of [[hunger]] and sense of [[thirst]]). However, what constitutes a sense is a matter of some debate, leading to difficulties in defining what exactly a distinct sense is, and where the borders lie between responses to related stimuli.

Other animals also have receptors to sense the world around them, with degrees of capability varying greatly between species. Humans have a comparatively weak sense of smell and a stronger sense of sight relative to many other [[mammals]] while some animals may lack one or more of the traditional five senses. Some animals may also intake and interpret sensory [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] in very different ways. Some species of animals are able to sense the world in a way that humans cannot, with some species able to sense [[electrical field|electrical]] and [[magnetic field]]s, and detect [[water pressure]] and currents.

[[File:Peacock served in full plumage (detail of BRUEGHEL Taste, Hearing and Touch).jpg|thumb|Detail of ''The Senses of Hearing, Touch and Taste'', [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]], 1618]]
A broadly acceptable definition of a sense would be "A system that consists of a group of sensory cell types that responds to a specific physical phenomenon, and that corresponds to a particular group of regions within the brain where the signals are received and interpreted." There is no firm agreement as to the number of senses because of differing definitions of what constitutes a sense.

The senses are frequently divided into exteroceptive and interoceptive:
* ''Exteroceptive senses'' are senses that perceive the body's own position, motion, and state, known as ''proprioceptive senses''. External senses include the traditional five: sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste, as well as [[thermoception]] (temperature differences) and possibly an additional weak [[magnetoception]] (direction).&lt;ref name="Voustianiouk 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Voustianiouk A, Kaufmann H |title=Magnetic fields and the central nervous system |journal=Clin Neurophysiol |volume=111 |issue=11 |pages=1934–5 |date=November 2000 |pmid=11068225 |doi=10.1016/S1388-2457(00)00487-9|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proprioceptive senses include [[nociception]] (pain); [[equilibrioception]] (balance); [[proprioception]] (a sense of the position and movement of the parts of one's own body).
* ''Interoceptive senses'' are senses that perceive [[#Other internal senses|sensations in internal organs]].

Non-human animals may possess senses that are absent in humans, such as [[electroreception]] and detection of [[polarized light]].

In [[Buddhist philosophy]], [[Ayatana]] or "sense-base" includes the mind as a sense organ, in addition to the traditional five. This addition to the commonly acknowledged senses may arise from the psychological orientation involved in Buddhist thought and practice. The mind considered by itself is seen as the principal gateway to a different spectrum of phenomena that differ from the physical sense data. This way of viewing the human sense system indicates the importance of internal sources of sensation and perception that complements our experience of the external world.

===Sight===

[[Image:Pietro Paolini - Allegory of the Five Senses - Walters 372768.jpg|left|thumb|In this painting by [[Pietro Paolini]], each individual represents one of the five senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]

 |title=Allegory of the Five Senses }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''[[Visual perception|Sight]]''' or '''vision''' (adjectival form: visual/optical) is the capability of the eye(s) to focus and detect images of visible [[light]] on [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] in the [[retina]] of each eye that generates electrical [[Action potential|nerve impulses]] for varying colors, hues, and brightness.  There are two types of photoreceptors: [[Rod cell|rods]] and [[Cone cell|cones]]. Rods are very sensitive to light, but do not distinguish colors.  Cones distinguish colors, but are less sensitive to dim light. There is some disagreement as to whether this constitutes one, two or three senses. Neuroanatomists generally regard it as two senses, given that  different receptors are responsible for the perception of color and brightness. Some argue{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} that [[stereopsis]], the perception of depth using both eyes, also constitutes a sense, but it is generally regarded as a cognitive (that is, post-sensory) function of the [[visual cortex]] of the brain where patterns and objects in [[Real image|images]] are recognized and interpreted based on previously learned information. This is called visual memory.

The inability to see is called [[blindness]]. Blindness may result from damage to the eyeball, especially to the retina, damage to the optic nerve that connects each eye to the brain, and/or from [[stroke]] ([[infarct]]s in the brain).  Temporary or permanent blindness can be caused by poisons or medications.

People who are blind from degradation or damage to the visual cortex, but still have functional eyes, are actually capable of some level of vision and reaction to visual stimuli but not a conscious perception; this is known as [[blindsight]]. People with blindsight are usually not aware that they are reacting to visual sources, and instead just unconsciously adapt their behaviour to the stimulus.

On February 14, 2013 researchers developed a [[neural implant]] that gives [[rat]]s the ability to sense [[infrared]] light which for the first time provides [[living creatures]] with new abilities, instead of simply replacing or augmenting existing abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-02/14/implant-gives-rats-sixth-sense-for-infrared-light|title=Implant gives rats sixth sense for infrared light|work=Wired UK|date=14 February 2013|accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hearing===

'''[[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]]''' or '''audition''' (adjectival form: auditory) is the sense of [[sound]] perception. Hearing is all about vibration. Mechanoreceptors turn motion into electrical nerve pulses, which are located in the inner ear. Since sound is vibration, propagating through a medium such as air, the detection of these vibrations, that is the sense of the hearing, is a mechanical sense because these vibrations are mechanically conducted from the eardrum through a series of tiny bones to hair-like fibers in the [[inner ear]], which detect mechanical motion of the fibers within a range of about 20 to 20,000&amp;nbsp;[[hertz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ChrisDAmbrose.shtml |title=Frequency Range of Human Hearing, Physics Factbook by Glenn Elert (ed) |publisher=Hypertextbook.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; with substantial variation between individuals. Hearing at high frequencies declines with an increase in age. Inability to hear is called [[deafness]] or hearing impairment. Sound can also be detected as [[Seismic communication|vibrations conducted through the body]] by tactition. Lower frequencies that can be heard are detected this way. Some deaf people are able to determine direction and location of vibrations picked up through the feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vicdeaf.com.au/files/editor_upload/File/Information%20Sheets/Deaf%20Culture%20and%20Communication%20-%20A%20Basic%20Guide.pdf|title=Deaf Culture and Communication: A Basic Guide|work=Victorian Deaf Society|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taste===

'''[[Taste]]''' or '''gustation''' (adjectival form: gustatory) is one of the traditional five senses. It refers to the capability to detect the taste of substances such as food, certain minerals, and poisons, etc. The sense of taste is often confused with the "sense" of flavor, which is a combination of taste and smell perception. [[File:Philippe Mercier - The Sense of Taste - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Philippe Mercier - The Sense of Taste - Google Art Project]] Flavor depends on odor, texture, and temperature as well as on taste. Humans receive tastes through sensory organs called taste buds, or gustatory calyculi, concentrated on the upper surface of the tongue. There are five [[basic taste]]s: [[sweet]], [[Bitter (taste)#Bitterness|bitter]], [[sour]], [[Saltiness|salty]] and [[umami]]. Other tastes such as calcium&lt;ref name="Tordoff 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tordoff MG |title=Gene discovery and the genetic basis of calcium consumption |journal=Physiol. Behav. |volume=94 |issue=5 |pages=649–59 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18499198 |pmc=2574908 |doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2008.04.004 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sciencedaily 2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080820163008.htm |title=That Tastes ...

The inability to taste is called [[ageusia]].

===Smell===

'''[[Olfaction|Smell]]''' or '''olfaction''' (adjectival form: olfactory) is the other "chemical" sense. Unlike taste, there are hundreds of olfactory receptors (388 according to one source&lt;ref name=Moonwalk
&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sandwalk.blogspot.co.uk/2007/01/sense-of-smell-olfactory-receptors.html |title=A Sense of Smell: Olfactory Receptors |work=Sandwalk |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), each binding to a particular molecular feature. Odor molecules possess a variety of features and, thus, excite specific receptors more or less strongly. This combination of excitatory signals from different receptors makes up what we perceive as the molecule's smell. [[File:The sense of smell Philippe Mercier.jpg|thumb|The sense of smell [[Philippe Mercier]]]] In the brain, olfaction is processed by the [[olfactory system]]. [[Olfactory receptor neuron]]s in the [[Human nose|nose]] differ from most other neurons in that they die and regenerate on a regular basis. The inability to smell is called [[anosmia]]. Some neurons in the nose are specialized to detect [[pheromone]]s.&lt;ref name="LiveScience"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/2737-surprising-impact-taste-smell.html |title=The Surprising Impact of Taste and Smell |work=LiveScience }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Touch===

'''[[Somatosensory system|Touch]]''' or '''somatosensation''' (adjectival form: somatic), also called '''[[tactition]]'''  (adjectival form: tactile) or '''[[Mechanoreceptor|mechanoreception]]''', is a perception resulting from activation of neural [[Mechanoreceptor|receptors]], generally in the [[skin]] including [[hair follicle]]s, but also in the [[tongue]], [[throat]], and [[Mucous membrane|mucosa]]. A variety of [[pressure]] receptors respond to variations in pressure (firm, brushing, sustained, etc.). The touch sense of [[itch]]ing caused by insect bites or allergies involves special itch-specific neurons in the skin and spinal cord.&lt;ref name="Sun Zhao 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sun YG, Zhao ZQ, Meng XL, Yin J, Liu XY, Chen ZF |title=Cellular basis of itch sensation |journal=Science |volume=325 |issue=5947 |pages=1531–4 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19661382 |pmc=2786498 |doi=10.1126/science.1174868 |url=|bibcode=2009Sci...325.1531S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss or impairment of the ability to feel anything touched is called tactile [[anesthesia]].  [[Paresthesia]] is a sensation of tingling, pricking, or [[numbness]] of the skin that may result from nerve damage and may be permanent or temporary.

== Other senses ==

===Balance and acceleration===
{{Main|Vestibular system}}

'''[[Balance (ability)|Balance]]''', '''[[equilibrioception]]''', or '''vestibular sense''' is the sense that allows an organism to sense body movement, direction, and acceleration, and to attain and maintain postural equilibrium and balance. The organ of equilibrioception is the vestibular labyrinthine system found in both of the [[inner ear]]s. In technical terms, this organ is responsible for two senses of [[angular momentum]] acceleration and [[linear acceleration]] (which also senses [[gravity]]), but they are known together as equilibrioception.

The [[vestibular nerve]] conducts information from sensory receptors in three [[Osseous ampullae|ampulla]] that sense motion of fluid in three [[semicircular canal]]s caused by three-dimensional rotation of the head.  The vestibular nerve also conducts information from the [[utricle (ear)|utricle]] and the [[saccule]], which contain hair-like sensory receptors that bend under the weight of [[otolith]]s (which are small crystals of [[calcium carbonate]]) that provide the inertia needed to detect head rotation, linear acceleration, and the direction of gravitational force.

===Temperature===

'''[[Thermoception]]''' is the sense of '''heat''' and the absence of heat ('''cold''') by the [[skin]] and internal skin passages, or, rather, the '''[[heat flux]]''' (the rate of [[heat flow]]) in these areas. There are specialized receptors for cold (declining temperature) and for heat (increasing temperature). The cold receptors play an important part in the animal's sense of smell, telling wind direction.  The heat receptors are sensitive to infrared radiation and can occur in specialized organs, for instance in [[pit vipers]]. The [[Thermoreceptor|thermoceptors]] in the skin are quite different from the [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] thermoceptors in the brain ([[POAH|hypothalamus]]), which provide feedback on internal body temperature.

===Proprioception===

'''[[Proprioception]]''', the '''kinesthetic sense''', provides the [[Parietal lobe|parietal cortex]] of the brain with information on the movement and relative positions of the parts of the body. Neurologists test this sense by telling patients to close their eyes and touch their own nose with the tip of a finger. Assuming proper proprioceptive function, at no time will the person lose awareness of where the hand actually is, even though it is not being detected by any of the other senses. Proprioception and touch are related in subtle ways, and their impairment results in surprising and deep deficits in perception and action.&lt;ref name="roblesdelatorre"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roblesdelatorre.com/gabriel/GR-IEEE-MM-2006.pdf |title=The Importance of the Sense of Touch in Virtual and Real Environments |work=International Society for Haptics |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pain===

'''[[Nociception]]''' (physiological [[pain]]) signals nerve-damage or damage to tissue. The three types of pain receptors are cutaneous (skin), somatic (joints and bones), and visceral (body organs). It was previously believed that pain was simply the overloading of pressure receptors, but research in the first half of the 20th century indicated that pain is a distinct phenomenon that intertwines with all of the other senses, including touch. Pain was once considered an entirely subjective experience, but recent studies show that pain is registered in the [[anterior cingulate gyrus]] of the brain.&lt;ref name="Fulbrigh 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fulbright RK, Troche CJ, Skudlarski P, Gore JC, Wexler BE |title=Functional MR imaging of regional brain activation associated with the affective experience of pain |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=177 |issue=5 |pages=1205–10 |date=November 2001 |pmid=11641204 |doi=10.2214/ajr.177.5.1771205 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main function of pain is to attract our [[attention]] to dangers and motivate us to avoid them. For example, humans avoid touching a sharp needle, or hot object, or extending an arm beyond a safe limit because it is dangerous, and thus hurts. Without pain, people could do many dangerous things without being aware of the dangers.

===Sexual stimulation===
{{Main|Sexual stimulation}}

'''[[Sexual stimulation]]''' is any [[stimulation|stimulus]] (including bodily contact) that leads to, enhances and maintains [[sexual arousal]], and may lead to [[orgasm]]. Distinct from the general sense of touch, sexual stimulation is strongly tied to hormonal activity and chemical triggers in the body. Although sexual arousal may arise without [[physical stimulation]], achieving orgasm usually requires physical sexual stimulation (stimulation of the Krause-Finger [[Bulboid corpuscle|corpuscles]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://abdominalkey.com/sensory-corpuscles/|title=Sensory Corpuscles|last=Themes|first=UFO|date=2017-03-29|work=Abdominal Key|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; found in erogenous zones of the body).

===Other internal senses{{anchor|Interoception}}===
An '''internal sense''' also known as [[interoception]]&lt;ref name="Craig 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Craig AD |title=Interoception: the sense of the physiological condition of the body |journal=Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=500–5 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12965300 |doi=10.1016/S0959-4388(03)00090-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; is "any sense that is normally stimulated from within the body".&lt;ref name="Dunn Galton 2010"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Dunn BD, Galton HC, Morgan R, etal |title=Listening to your heart.

Interoception is thought to be atypical in clinical conditions such as alexithymia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shah|first=Punit|last2=Hall|first2=Richard|last3=Catmur|first3=Caroline|last4=Bird|first4=Geoffrey|date=2016-08-01|title=Alexithymia, not autism, is associated with impaired interoception|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945216300594|journal=Cortex|volume=81|pages=215–220|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2016.03.021|pmc=4962768|pmid=27253723}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some examples of specific receptors are:

* [[Pulmonary stretch receptors]] are found in the lungs and control the [[respiratory rate]].
* [[Peripheral chemoreceptors]] in the brain monitor the carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in the brain to give a feeling of [[suffocation]] if carbon dioxide levels get too high.&lt;ref name="HowStuffWorks How Your Lungs Work"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/human-biology/lung3.htm |title=How Your Lungs Work |work=HowStuffWorks }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[chemoreceptor trigger zone]] is an area of the [[medulla oblongata|medulla]] in the brain that receives inputs from [[blood]]-borne [[drug]]s or [[hormone]]s, and communicates with the [[vomiting center]].
* Chemoreceptors in the circulatory system also measure salt levels and prompt thirst if they get too high; they can also respond to high [[blood sugar]] levels in diabetics.
* [[Cutaneous receptor]]s in the skin not only respond to touch, pressure, temperature and vibration, but also respond to vasodilation in the skin such as [[blushing]].
* Stretch receptors in the [[gastrointestinal tract]] sense gas distension that may result in colic pain.
* Stimulation of sensory receptors in the [[esophagus]] result in sensations felt in the throat when [[swallowing]], [[vomiting]], or during [[acid reflux]].
* Sensory receptors in [[pharynx]] mucosa, similar to touch receptors in the skin, sense foreign objects such as food that may result in a [[gag reflex]] and corresponding gagging sensation.
* Stimulation of sensory receptors in the [[urinary bladder]] and [[rectum]] may result in sensations of fullness.
* Stimulation of stretch sensors that sense dilation of various blood vessels may result in pain, for example headache caused by vasodilation of brain arteries.
* Cardioception refers to the perception of the activity of the heart.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* [[Opsin]]s and [[direct DNA damage]] in [[melanocyte]]s and [[keratinocyte]]s can sense [[ultraviolet]] radiation, which plays a role in pigmentation and [[sunburn]].

==Perception not based on a specific sensory organ==

===Time===
{{main | time perception}}
'''[[time perception|Chronoception]]''' refers to how the passage of time is perceived and experienced. Although the [[time perception|sense of time]] is not associated with a specific [[sensory system]], the work of [[psychologist]]s and [[neuroscientist]]s indicates that human brains do have a system governing the [[perception]] of [[time]],&lt;ref name="Rao 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rao SM, Mayer AR, Harrington DL |title=The evolution of brain activation during temporal processing |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=317–23 |date=March 2001 |pmid=11224550 |doi=10.1038/85191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.unisci.com/stories/20011/0227013.htm | title= Brain Areas Critical To Human Time Sense Identified | accessdate= | date= 2001-02-27 |publisher= UniSci – Daily University Science News}}&lt;/ref&gt; composed of a highly distributed system involving the [[cerebral cortex]], [[cerebellum]] and [[basal ganglia]]. One particular component, the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]], is responsible for the [[circadian rhythm|circadian (or daily) rhythm]], while other cell clusters appear to be capable of shorter-range ([[ultradian]]) timekeeping.

One or more [[dopaminergic pathways]] in the [[central nervous system]] appear to have a strong modulatory influence on [[mental chronometry]], particularly interval timing.&lt;ref name="Amph-DA reaction time"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parker KL, Lamichhane D, Caetano MS, Narayanan NS | title = Executive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease and timing deficits | journal = Front. Integr. Neurosci. | volume = 7 | page = 75 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24198770 | pmc = 3813949 | doi = 10.3389/fnint.2013.00075 | quote = Manipulations of dopaminergic signaling profoundly influence interval timing, leading to the hypothesis that dopamine influences internal pacemaker, or “clock,” activity. For instance, amphetamine, which increases concentrations of dopamine at the synaptic cleft advances the start of responding during interval timing, whereas antagonists of D2 type dopamine receptors typically slow timing;... Depletion of dopamine in healthy volunteers impairs timing, while amphetamine releases synaptic dopamine and speeds up timing. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agency===
{{main | Sense of agency}}

The sense of agency refers to the subjective feeling of having chosen a particular action. Some conditions, such as schizophrenia, can lead to a loss of this sense, causing a person to feel like a machine or even leading to delusions of being controlled from some outside source. The opposite extreme occurs too, with some people experiencing everything in their environment as if they had decided that it would happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Ego Tunnel | last = Metzinger | first = Thomas | pages = 117–118 | year = 2009 | publisher = Basic Books | isbn = 978-0-465-04567-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in non-pathological cases, there is a measurable difference between making a decision and the feeling of agency. Through methods such as [[Neuroscience of free will#Libet experiment|the Libet experiment]], a gap of half a second or more can be detected from the time when there are detectable neurological signs of a decision having been made to the time when the subject actually becomes conscious of the decision.

There are also experiments in which an illusion of agency is induced in psychologically normal subjects. In Wegner and Wheatley 1999, subjects were given instructions to move a mouse around a scene and point to an image about once every thirty seconds. However, a second person—acting as a test subject but actually a confederate—had their hand on the mouse at the same time, and controlled some of the movement. Experimenters were able to arrange for subjects to perceive certain "forced stops" as if they were their own choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wegner D, Wheatley T | title = Apparent Mental Causation | journal = American Psychologist | year = 1999 | volume = 54 | number = 7 | pages = 480–92 | url = http://cogsci.ucd.ie/introtocogsci/docs/Agency-1999.pdf | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.54.7.480 | pmid=10424155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Metzinger | first = Thomas | date= 2003 | title = Being No One | page = 508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Familiarity===

[[Recognition memory]] is sometimes divided into two functions by neuroscientists: familiarity and recollection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mandler | year = 1980 | title =  Recognizing: the judgement of prior occurrence | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 87| issue = 3 | pages = 252–271 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.87.3.252| url = http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/58b2c2fc }}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong sense of familiarity can occur without any recollection, for example in cases of [[deja vu]]. The temporal lobe, in particular the [[perirhinal cortex]], responds differently to stimuli which feel novel than to things which feel familiar. Firing rates in the perirhinal cortex are connected with the sense of familiarity in humans and other mammals. In tests, stimulating this area at 10–15&amp;nbsp;Hz caused animals to treat even novel images as familiar, and stimulation at 30–40&amp;nbsp;Hz caused novel images to be partially treated as familiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Bidirectional Modulation of Recognition Memory | authors = Jonathan W. Ho, Devon L. Poeta, Tara K. Jacobson, Timothy A. Zolnik, Garrett T. Neske, Barry W. Connors and Rebecca D. Burwell | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 35 | number = 39 | date = 30 September 2015 | pages = 13323–13335 | doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2278-15.2015| pmid = 26424881 | pmc = 4588607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, stimulation at 30–40&amp;nbsp;Hz led to animals looking at a familiar image for longer periods, as they would for an unfamiliar one; but it did not lead to the same exploration behavior normally associated with novelty. Recent studies on lesions in the area concluded that rats with a damaged perirhinal cortex were still more interested in exploring when novel objects were present, but seemed unable to tell novel objects from familiar ones—they examined both equally. Thus, other brain regions are involved with noticing unfamiliarity, but the perirhinal cortex is needed to associate the feeling with a specific source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Detecting and discriminating novel objects: The impact of perirhinal cortex disconnection on hippocampal activity patterns | author = Kinnavane, Lisa and Amin, Eman and Olarte-Sánchez, Cristian M. and Aggleton, John P. | journal = Hippocampus | volume = 26 | number = 11 | issn = 1098-1063 | doi = 10.1002/hipo.22615 | pmid = 27398938 | pmc = 5082501 | pages = 1393–1413 | year = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-human senses==

===Analogous to human senses===
Other living organisms have receptors to sense the world around them, including many of the senses listed above for humans. However, the mechanisms and capabilities vary widely.

====Smell====
Most non-human mammals have a much keener sense of smell than humans, although the mechanism is similar.{{Citation needed|reason=Any non-anectodal sources?|date=December 2017}} An example of smell in non-mammals is that of [[sharks]], which combine their keen sense of smell with timing to determine the direction of a smell. They follow the nostril that first detected the smell.&lt;ref name="Gardiner Atema 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardiner|first1=Jayne M.|last2=Atema|first2=Jelle|title=The Function of Bilateral Odor Arrival Time Differences in Olfactory Orientation of Sharks|journal=Current Biology|volume=20| issue=13| year=2010| pages=1187–1191| issn=0960-9822| doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.04.053|pmid=20541411|url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(10)00591-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Insect]]s have olfactory receptors on their [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]].

====Vomeronasal organ====
Many animals ([[salamander]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[mammal]]s) have a [[vomeronasal organ]]&lt;ref name="Takami 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Takami S |title=Recent progress in the neurobiology of the [[vomeronasal organ]] |journal=Microsc. Res. Tech. |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=228–50 |date=August 2002 |pmid=12203701 |doi=10.1002/jemt.10094 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is connected with the mouth cavity. In mammals it is mainly used to detect [[pheromones]] of marked territory, trails, and sexual state. Reptiles like [[snake]]s and [[monitor lizard]]s make extensive use of it as a smelling organ by transferring scent molecules to the vomeronasal organ with the tips of the forked tongue. In reptiles the vomeronasal organ is commonly referred to as Jacobsons organ. In mammals, it is often associated with a special behavior called [[flehmen]] characterized by uplifting of the lips. The organ is [[Human vestigiality|vestigial in humans]], because associated neurons have not been found that give any sensory input in humans.&lt;ref name="Frasnelli 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frasnelli J, Lundström JN, Boyle JA, Katsarkas A, Jones-Gotman M |title=The vomeronasal organ is not involved in the perception of endogenous odors |journal=Hum Brain Mapp |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=450–60 |date=March 2011 |pmid=20578170 |pmc=3607301 |doi=10.1002/hbm.21035 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taste====
[[Flies]] and [[butterflies]] have taste organs on their feet, allowing them to taste anything they land on. [[Catfish]] have taste organs across their entire bodies, and can taste anything they touch, including chemicals in the water.&lt;ref&gt;Atema, Jelle (1980) [https://books.google.com/books?id=TZbRp0z5-p0C&amp;pg=PA57 "Chemical senses, chemical signals, and feeding behavior in fishes"] p. 57–101. In: Bardach, JE ''Fish behavior and its use in the capture and culture of fishes', The WorldFish Center, {{ISBN|978-971-02-0003-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vision and light sensing====
[[Cat]]s have the ability to see in low light, which is due to muscles surrounding their [[Iris (anatomy)|irides]]–which contract and expand their pupils–as well as to the [[tapetum lucidum]], a reflective membrane that optimizes the image.
[[Crotalinae|Pit vipers]], [[Pythonidae|pythons]] and some [[Boidae|boa]]s have organs that allow them to detect [[infrared]] light, such that these snakes are able to sense the body heat of their prey. The [[common vampire bat]] may also have an infrared sensor on its nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitt.edu/AFShome/s/l/slavic/public/html/courses/vampires/images/bats/vambat.html|title=The illustrated story of the Vampire bat|accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that [[birds]] and some other animals are [[tetrachromats]] and have the ability to see in the [[ultraviolet]] down to 300 nanometers. [[Bees]] and [[dragonflies]]&lt;ref name="van Kleef Berry 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Kleef| first1=J.| last2=Berry| first2=R.|last3=Stange| first3=G.| title=Directional Selectivity in the Simple Eye of an Insect|journal=Journal of Neuroscience| volume=28|issue=11| year=2008| issn=0270-6474| doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5556-07.2008 | pmid=18337415| pages=2845–2855}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also able to see in the ultraviolet. [[Mantis shrimp]]s can perceive both [[polarized light]] and [[multispectral]] images and have twelve distinct kinds of color receptors, unlike humans which have three kinds and most mammals which have two kinds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v401/n6756/full/401873a0.html| title=Ultraviolet vision: the colourful world of the mantis shrimp| year=1999 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=401 |pages=873–874 |doi=10.1038/44751 |author1=Justin Marshall |author2=Johannes Oberwinkler |pmid=10553902 |issue=6756|bibcode = 1999Natur.401..873M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cephalopod]]s have the ability to change color using [[chromatophore]]s in their skin. Researchers believe that [[opsin]]s in the skin can sense different wavelengths of light and help the creatures choose a coloration that camouflages them, in addition to light input from the eyes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thedishonscience.stanford.edu/posts/octopus-vision-is-in-the-skin-of-the-beholder/ Octopus vision, it's in the eye (or skin) of the beholder]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other researchers hypothesize that [[cephalopod eye]]s in species which only have a single [[photoreceptor protein]] may use [[chromatic aberration]] to turn monochromatic vision into color vision,&lt;ref&gt;[https://phys.org/news/2016-07-explanation-cephalopods-black-white-vision.html Study proposes explanation for how cephalopods see color, despite black and white vision]&lt;/ref&gt; explaining pupils shaped like the letter U, the letter W, or a [[dumbbell]], as well as explaining the need for colorful mating displays.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.futurity.org/octopus-color-pupils-1196262/ Odd pupils let ‘colorblind’ octopuses see colors]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some cephalopods can distinguish the polarization of light.

====Balance====
Many invertebrates have a [[statocyst]], which is a sensor for acceleration and orientation that works very differently from the mammalian's semi-circular canals.

====Sensing gravity====
Some plants (such as mustard) have genes that are necessary for the plant to sense the direction of gravity.  If these genes are disabled by a mutation, a plant cannot grow upright.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Zimmer, "The Search for Genes Leads to Unexpected Places", ''New York Times'', April 27, 2010, page D1, New York edition [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/science/27gene.html Plants sensing gravity]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Not analogous to human senses===
In addition, some animals have senses that humans do not, including the following:

==== Echolocation ====
{{Main|Animal echolocation}}
Certain animals, including [[bat]]s and [[cetacea]]ns, have the ability to determine orientation to other objects through interpretation of reflected sound (like [[sonar]]). They most often use this to navigate through poor lighting conditions or to identify and track prey. There is currently an uncertainty whether this is simply an extremely developed post-sensory interpretation of auditory perceptions or it actually constitutes a separate sense. Resolution of the issue will require brain scans of animals while they actually perform echolocation, a task that has proven difficult in practice.

Blind people report they are able to navigate and in some cases identify an object by interpreting reflected sounds (especially their own footsteps), a phenomenon known as [[human echolocation]].

==== Electroreception ====
'''[[Electroreception]]''' (or '''electroception''') is the ability to detect [[electric field]]s. Several species of fish, [[shark]]s, and rays have the capacity to sense changes in electric fields in their immediate vicinity. For cartilaginous fish this occurs through a specialized organ called the [[Ampullae of Lorenzini]]. Some fish passively sense changing nearby electric fields; some generate their own weak electric fields, and sense the pattern of field potentials over their body surface; and some use these electric field generating and sensing capacities for social [[communication]]. The mechanisms by which electroceptive fish construct a spatial representation from very small differences in field potentials involve comparisons of spike latencies from different parts of the fish's body.

The only orders of mammals that are known to demonstrate electroception are the [[dolphin]] and [[monotreme]] orders. Among these mammals, the [[platypus]]&lt;ref name="Electroreceptive Mechanisms in the Platypus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/bionb420.07/anelson/electrorecept.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990209085517/http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/bionb420.07/anelson/electrorecept.html |archivedate=1999-02-09 |title=Electroreceptive Mechanisms in the Platypus |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has the most acute sense of electroception.

A dolphin can detect electric fields in water using electroreceptors in [[Whisker|vibrissal crypts]] arrayed in pairs on its snout and which evolved from whisker motion sensors.&lt;ref name="Drake 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drake|first1=Nadia|title=Life: Dolphin can sense electric fields: Ability may help species track prey in murky waters|journal=Science News|volume=180| issue=5|year=2011| pages=12–12| issn=0036-8423|doi=10.1002/scin.5591800512}}&lt;/ref&gt; These electroreceptors can detect electric fields as weak as 4.6 microvolts per centimeter, such as those generated by contracting muscles and pumping gills of potential prey. This permits the dolphin to locate prey from the seafloor where sediment limits visibility and echolocation.

Spiders have been shown to detect electric fields to determine a suitable time to extend web for 'ballooning'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morley |first1=Erica |title=Electric Fields Elicit Ballooning in Spiders |journal=Current Biology |date=July 5, 2018 |volume=28 |issue=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Body modification]] enthusiasts have experimented with magnetic implants to attempt to replicate this sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2005/05/05/implant-gives-man-th.html|title=Implant gives man the sense of "magnetic vision" |accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in general humans (and it is presumed other mammals) can detect electric fields only indirectly by detecting the effect they have on hairs. An electrically charged balloon, for instance, will exert a force on human arm hairs, which can be felt through tactition and identified as coming from a static charge (and not from wind or the like). This is not electroreception, as it is a post-sensory cognitive action.

==== Magnetoception ====
'''[[Magnetoception]]''' (or '''magnetoreception''') is the ability to detect the direction one is facing based on the Earth's [[magnetic field]]. Directional awareness is most commonly observed in [[bird]]s, which rely on their magnetic sense to navigate during migration.&lt;ref name="Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/magsense/ms.html |title=The Magnetic Sense of Animals |work=Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baylor College of Medicine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcm.edu/news/item.cfm?newsID=5575 |title=Built-in GPS in birds in tune with Earth's magnetic field |work= Baylor College of Medicine |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wu Dickman 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wu |first1=L.-Q. |last2=Dickman |first2=J.

====Hygroreception====
'''[[Hygroreception]]''' is the ability to detect changes in the moisture content of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enjin|first=Anders|last2=Zaharieva|first2=Emanuela E.|last3=Frank|first3=Dominic D.|last4=Mansourian|first4=Suzan|last5=Suh|first5=Greg S.

====Infrared sensing====
{{Main|Infrared sensing in snakes}}

The ability to sense [[infrared]] thermal radiation evolved independently in various families of [[snakes]]. Essentially, it allows these reptiles to "see" radiant heat at [[wavelengths]] between 5 and 30 [[μm]] to a degree of accuracy such that a blind [[rattlesnake]] can target vulnerable body parts of the prey at which it strikes.&lt;ref&gt;(Kardong &amp; Mackessy 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; It was previously thought that the organs evolved primarily as prey detectors, but it is now believed that it may also be used in thermoregulatory decision making.&lt;ref&gt;(Krochmal et al. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The facial pit underwent [[parallel evolution]] in [[pitvipers]] and some [[Boidae|boas]] and [[pythons]], having evolved once in pitvipers and multiple times in boas and pythons.&lt;ref&gt;(Pough et al. 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[electrophysiology]] of the structure is similar between the two lineages, but they differ in gross structural [[anatomy]]. Most superficially, pitvipers possess one large pit organ on either side of the head, between the eye and the nostril ([[Loreal pit]]), while boas and pythons have three or more comparatively smaller pits lining the upper and sometimes the lower lip, in or between the scales. Those of the pitvipers are the more advanced, having a suspended sensory membrane as opposed to a simple pit structure. Within the family [[Viperidae]], the pit organ is seen only in the subfamily Crotalinae: the pitvipers. The organ is used extensively to detect and target [[endothermic]] prey such as rodents and birds, and it was previously assumed that the organ evolved specifically for that purpose. However, recent evidence shows that the pit organ may also be used for thermoregulation. According to Krochmal et al., pitvipers can use their pits for thermoregulatory decision making while true vipers (vipers who do not contain heat-sensing pits) cannot.

In spite of its detection of IR light, the pits' IR detection mechanism is not similar to photoreceptors – while photoreceptors detect light via photochemical reactions, the protein in the pits of snakes is in fact a temperature sensitive ion channel. It senses infrared signals through a mechanism involving warming of the pit organ, rather than chemical reaction to light.&lt;ref name="Gracheva et al. 2010"&gt;(Gracheva et al. 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the thin pit membrane, which allows incoming IR radiation to quickly and precisely warm a given ion channel and trigger a nerve impulse, as well as vascularize the pit membrane in order to rapidly cool the ion channel back to its original "resting" or "inactive" temperature.&lt;ref name="Gracheva et al. 2010"/&gt;

==== Other ====
*'''Pressure detection''' uses the organ of Weber, a system consisting of three appendages of vertebrae transferring changes in shape of the [[gas bladder]] to the middle ear. It can be used to regulate the buoyancy of the fish. Fish like the [[weather fish]] and other loaches are also known to respond to low pressure areas but they lack a swim bladder.
* '''Current detection''' is a detection system of water currents, consisting mostly of [[vortex|vortices]], found in the [[lateral line]] of fish and aquatic forms of amphibians. The lateral line is also sensitive to low-frequency vibrations. The mechanoreceptors are [[hair cell]]s, the same mechanoreceptors for vestibular sense and hearing. It is used primarily for navigation, hunting, and schooling. The receptors of the [[electroception|electrical sense]] are modified hair cells of the lateral line system.
*'''[[Polarized light]] direction/detection''' is used by [[bees]] to orient themselves, especially on cloudy days. [[Cuttlefish]], some [[beetles]], and [[mantis shrimp]] can also perceive the polarization of light.  Most sighted humans can in fact learn to roughly detect large areas of polarization by an effect called [[Haidinger's brush]], however this is considered an [[entoptic phenomenon]] rather than a separate sense.
* '''[[Slit sensilla]]e of spiders''' detect mechanical strain in the exoskeleton, providing information on force and vibrations.

===Plant senses===
By using a variety of sense receptors, plants sense light, gravity, temperature, humidity, chemical substances, chemical gradients, reorientation, magnetic fields, infections, tissue damage and mechanical pressure. The absence of a nervous system notwithstanding, plants interpret and respond to these stimuli by a variety of hormonal and cell-to-cell communication pathways that result in movement, morphological changes and physiological state alterations at the organism level, that is, result in plant behavior. Such physiological and cognitive functions are generally not believed to give rise to mental phenomena or qualia, however, as these are typically considered the product of nervous system activity. The emergence of mental phenomena from the activity of systems  functionally or computationally analogous to that of nervous systems is, however, a hypothetical possibility explored by some schools of thought in the philosophy of mind field, such as functionalism and computationalism.

[[File:1668 Gérard de Lairesse - Allegory of the Five Senses.jpg|thumb|[[Gérard de Lairesse|Lairesse's]] ''Allegory of the Five Senses'']]

In the time of [[William Shakespeare]], there were commonly reckoned to be '''five wits''' or '''five senses'''.&lt;ref name=Furness1&gt;{{cite book|chapter=King Lear|title=Shakespeare|page=187|location=Philadelphia|publisher=J.B. Lippincott Co.|oclc=1932507|author=[[Horace Howard Furness]]|volume=5|edition=7th|year=1880}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the words "sense" and "wit" were synonyms,&lt;ref name=Furness1 /&gt; so the senses were known as the five outward wits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia|article=wit|encyclopedia=The Merriam-Webster new book of word histories|publisher=Merriam-Webster |date=1991 |isbn=0-87779-603-3| oclc=24246335 |pages=508}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Words|author=[[C.

The traditional five senses are enumerated as the "five material faculties" (''{{IAST|pañcannaṃ indriyānaṃ avakanti}}'') in Hindu literature. They appear in allegorical representation as early as in the [[Katha Upanishad]] (roughly 6th century BC), as five horses drawing the "[[chariot]]" of the body, guided by the mind as "chariot driver".

Depictions of the five traditional senses as [[allegory]] became a popular subject for seventeenth-century artists, especially among [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch]] and [[Flemish Baroque painter]]s. A typical example is [[Gérard de Lairesse]]'s ''Allegory of the Five Senses'' (1668), in which each of the figures in the main group alludes to a sense: Sight is the reclining boy with a [[convex mirror]], hearing is the [[cupid]]-like boy with a [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], smell is represented by the girl with flowers, taste is represented by the woman with the fruit, and touch is represented by the woman holding the bird.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, a statistic is '''sufficient''' for a [[Parametric family|family]] of [[probability distribution]]s if the sample from which it is calculated gives no additional information than does the statistic, as to which of those probability distributions is that of the population from which the sample was taken.

A related concept is that of '''linear sufficiency''', which is weaker than ''sufficiency'' but can be applied in some cases where there is no sufficient statistic, although it is restricted to linear estimators.&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, Y. (2003) — entry for linear sufficiency&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kolmogorov structure function]] deals with individual finite data; the related notion there is the algorithmic sufficient statistic.

The concept is due to [[Ronald Fisher|Sir Ronald Fisher]] in 1920. Stephen Stigler noted 1973 that the concept of sufficiency had fallen out of favor in [[descriptive statistics]] because of the strong dependence on an assumption of the distributional form (see [[#Exponential family|Pitman–Koopman–Darmois theorem]] below), but remained very important in theoretical work.&lt;ref name=Stigler1973&gt;{{cite journal

==Background==
Roughly, given a set &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; of [[independent identically distributed]] data conditioned on an unknown parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, a sufficient statistic is a function &lt;math&gt;T(\mathbf{X})&lt;/math&gt; whose value contains all the information needed to compute any estimate of the parameter (e.g. a [[maximum likelihood]] estimate).  Due to the factorization theorem ([[#Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem|see below]]), for a sufficient statistic &lt;math&gt;T(\mathbf{X})&lt;/math&gt;, the probabilty density can be written as &lt;math&gt;f_{\mathbf{X}}(x) = h(x) \, g(\theta, T(x))&lt;/math&gt;.  From this factorization, it can easily be seen that the maximum likelihood estimate of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; will interact with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; only through &lt;math&gt;T(\mathbf{X})&lt;/math&gt;.  Typically, the sufficient statistic is a simple function of the data, e.g. the sum of all the data points.

More generally, the "unknown parameter" may represent a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] of unknown quantities or may represent everything about the model that is unknown or not fully specified.  In such a case, the sufficient statistic may be a set of functions, called a ''jointly sufficient statistic''.  Typically, there are as many functions as there are parameters.  For example, for a [[Gaussian distribution]] with unknown [[mean]] and [[variance]], the jointly sufficient statistic, from which maximum likelihood estimates of both parameters can be estimated, consists of two functions, the sum of all data points and the sum of all squared data points (or equivalently, the [[sample mean]] and [[sample variance]]).

The concept is equivalent to the statement that, [[Conditional probability distribution|conditional]] on the value of a sufficient statistic for a parameter, the [[joint probability distribution]] of the data does not depend on that parameter. Both the statistic and the underlying parameter can be vectors.

==Mathematical definition==

A statistic ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''T''(''X'') is '''sufficient for underlying parameter ''θ''''' precisely if the [[conditional probability distribution]] of the data ''X'', given the statistic ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''T''(''X''), does not depend on the  parameter ''θ''.&lt;ref name="CasellaBerger"&gt;{{cite book | last = Casella | first = George |author2=Berger, Roger L.  | title = Statistical Inference, 2nd ed | publisher=Duxbury Press | year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===
As an example, the sample mean is sufficient for the mean (''μ'') of a [[normal distribution]] with known variance. Once the sample mean is known, no further information about ''μ'' can be obtained from the sample itself.  On the other hand, for an arbitrary distribution the [[median]] is not sufficient for the mean: even if the median of the sample is known, knowing the sample itself would provide further information about the population mean.  For example, if the observations that are less than the median are only slightly less, but observations exceeding the median exceed it by a large amount, then this would have a bearing on one's inference about the population mean.

==Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem==

''[[Ronald Fisher|Fisher's]] factorization theorem'' or ''factorization criterion'' provides a convenient '''characterization''' of a sufficient statistic.  If the [[probability density function]] is ƒ&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), then ''T'' is sufficient for ''θ'' [[if and only if]] nonnegative functions ''g'' and ''h'' can be found such that

:&lt;math&gt; f_\theta(x)=h(x) \, g_\theta(T(x)), &lt;/math&gt;

i.e. the density ƒ can be factored into a product such that one factor, ''h'', does not depend on ''θ'' and the other factor, which does depend on ''θ'', depends on ''x'' only through ''T''(''x'').

It is easy to see that if ''F''(''t'') is a one-to-one function and ''T'' is a sufficient
statistic, then ''F''(''T'') is a sufficient statistic. In particular we can multiply a
sufficient statistic by a nonzero constant and get another sufficient statistic.

===Likelihood principle interpretation===
An implication of the theorem is that when using likelihood-based inference, two sets of data yielding the same value for the sufficient statistic ''T''(''X'') will always yield the same inferences about ''θ''.  By the factorization criterion, the likelihood's dependence on ''θ'' is only in conjunction with ''T''(''X'').  As this is the same in both cases, the dependence on ''θ'' will be the same as well, leading to identical inferences.

===Proof===
Due to Hogg and Craig.&lt;ref name="HoggCraig"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hogg | first = Robert V. |author2=Craig, Allen T.  | title = Introduction to Mathematical Statistics | publisher=Prentice Hall | year = 1995 | ISBN=978-0-02-355722-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n&lt;/math&gt;,  denote a random sample from a distribution having the [[Probability density function|pdf]] ''f''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''θ'') for ''ι''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''θ''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''δ''. Let ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) be a statistic whose pdf is ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;;&amp;nbsp;''θ''). Then ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a sufficient statistic for ''θ'' if and only if, for some function ''H'',

:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i; \theta) = g_1 \left[u_1 (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n); \theta \right] H(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n). &lt;/math&gt;

First, suppose that
:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i; \theta) = g_1 \left[u_1 (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n); \theta \right] H(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n). &lt;/math&gt;

We shall make the transformation ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''u''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), for ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n'', having inverse functions ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''w''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), for ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n'', and [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] &lt;math&gt; J = \left[w_i/y_j \right] &lt;/math&gt;. Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;
 \prod_{i=1}^n f \left[ w_i(y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n); \theta \right]  = 
 |J| g_1 (y_1; \theta) H \left[ w_1(y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n), \dots, w_n(y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n) \right].
&lt;/math&gt;

The left-hand member is the joint pdf ''g''(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;; θ) of ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), ..., ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).  In the right-hand member, &lt;math&gt;g_1(y_1;\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the pdf of &lt;math&gt;Y_1&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;H[ w_1, \dots , w_n] |J|&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient of &lt;math&gt;g(y_1,\dots,y_n;\theta)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_1(y_1;\theta)&lt;/math&gt;; that is, it is the conditional pdf &lt;math&gt;h(y_2, \dots, y_n \mid  y_1; \theta)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;Y_2,\dots,Y_n&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;Y_1=y_1&lt;/math&gt;.

But &lt;math&gt;H(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt;, and thus &lt;math&gt;H\left[w_1(y_1,\dots,y_n), \dots, w_n(y_1, \dots, y_n))\right]&lt;/math&gt;, was given not to depend upon &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; was not introduced in the transformation and accordingly not in the Jacobian &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that &lt;math&gt;h(y_2, \dots, y_n \mid y_1; \theta)&lt;/math&gt; does not depend upon &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;Y_1&lt;/math&gt; is a sufficient statistics for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.

The converse is proven by taking:

:&lt;math&gt;g(y_1,\dots,y_n;\theta)=g_1(y_1; \theta) h(y_2, \dots, y_n \mid y_1),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h(y_2, \dots, y_n \mid y_1)&lt;/math&gt; does not depend upon &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;Y_2 ... Y_n&lt;/math&gt; depend only upon &lt;math&gt;X_1 ... X_n&lt;/math&gt;, which are independent on &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; when conditioned by &lt;math&gt;Y_1&lt;/math&gt;, a sufficient statistics by hypothesis. Now divide both members by the absolute value of the non-vanishing Jacobian &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;, and replace &lt;math&gt;y_1, \dots, y_n&lt;/math&gt; by the functions &lt;math&gt;u_1(x_1, \dots, x_n), \dots, u_n(x_1,\dots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;x_1,\dots, x_n&lt;/math&gt;. This yields

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{g\left[ u_1(x_1, \dots, x_n), \dots, u_n(x_1, \dots, x_n); \theta \right]}{|J^*|}=g_1\left[u_1(x_1,\dots,x_n); \theta\right] \frac{h(u_2, \dots, u_n \mid u_1)}{|J^*|}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J^*&lt;/math&gt; is the Jacobian with &lt;math&gt;y_1,\dots,y_n&lt;/math&gt; replaced by their value in terms &lt;math&gt;x_1, \dots, x_n&lt;/math&gt;. The left-hand member is necessarily the joint pdf &lt;math&gt;f(x_1;\theta)\cdots f(x_n;\theta)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X_1,\dots,X_n&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;h(y_2,\dots,y_n\mid y_1)&lt;/math&gt;, and thus &lt;math&gt;h(u_2,\dots,u_n\mid u_1)&lt;/math&gt;, does not depend upon &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;H(x_1,\dots,x_2)=\frac{h(u_2,\dots,u_n\mid u_1)}{|J^*|}&lt;/math&gt;

is a function that does not depend upon &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.

===Another proof===
A simpler more illustrative  proof is as follows, although it applies only in the discrete case.

We use the shorthand notation to denote the joint probability density of &lt;math&gt;(X, T(X))&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;f_\theta(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a function of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;f_\theta(x,t) = f_\theta(x)&lt;/math&gt;, as long as &lt;math&gt;t = T(x)&lt;/math&gt; and zero otherwise. Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f_\theta(x) &amp; = f_\theta(x,t) \\
&amp; = f_\theta (x\mid t) f_\theta(t) \\
&amp; = f(x\mid t) f_\theta(t)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

with the last equality being true by the definition of sufficient statistics. Thus &lt;math&gt;f_\theta(x)=a(x) b_\theta(t)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a(x) = f_{X \mid t}(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_\theta(t) = f_\theta(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;f_\theta(x)=a(x) b_\theta(t)&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f_\theta(t) &amp; = \sum _{x : T(x) = t} f_\theta(x, t) \\
&amp; = \sum _{x : T(x) = t} f_\theta(x) \\
&amp; = \sum _{x : T(x) = t} a(x) b_\theta(t) \\
&amp; = \left( \sum _{x : T(x) = t} a(x) \right) b_\theta(t).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

With the first equality by the [[Probability density function#Probability functions associated with multiple variables|definition of pdf for multiple variables]], the second by the remark above, the third by hypothesis, and the fourth because the summation is not over &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;f_{\theta\mid t}(x)&lt;/math&gt; denote the conditional probability density of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;T(X)&lt;/math&gt;. Then we can derive an explicit expression for this:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f_{\theta\mid t}(x)
&amp; = \frac{f_\theta(x, t)}{f_\theta(t)} \\
&amp; = \frac{f_\theta(x)}{f_\theta(t)} \\
&amp; = \frac{a(x) b_\theta(t)}{\left( \sum _{x : T(x) = t} a(x) \right) b_\theta(t)} \\
&amp; = \frac{a(x)}{\sum _{x : T(x) = t} a(x)}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

With the first equality by definition of conditional probability density, the second by the remark above, the third by the equality proven above, and the fourth by simplification. This expression does not depend on &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and thus &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a sufficient statistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cnx.org/content/m11480/1.6/ | title=The Fisher–Neyman Factorization Theorem}}.

==Minimal sufficiency==
A sufficient statistic is '''minimal sufficient''' if it can be represented as a function of any other sufficient statistic. In other words, ''S''(''X'') is '''minimal sufficient''' if and only if&lt;ref&gt;Dodge (2003) — entry for minimal sufficient statistics&lt;/ref&gt;
#''S''(''X'') is sufficient, and
#if ''T''(''X'') is sufficient, then there exists a function ''f'' such that ''S''(''X'') = ''f''(''T''(''X'')).

Intuitively, a minimal sufficient statistic ''most efficiently'' captures all possible information about the parameter ''θ''.

A useful characterization of minimal sufficiency is that when the density ''f''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; exists, ''S''(''X'') is '''minimal sufficient''' if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f_\theta(x)}{f_\theta(y)}&lt;/math&gt; is independent of ''θ'' :&lt;math&gt;\Longleftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''S''(''x'') = ''S''(''y'')

This follows as a direct consequence from [[#Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem|Fisher's factorization theorem]] stated above.

A case in which there is no minimal sufficient statistic was shown by Bahadur, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann and Casella (1998), ''Theory of Point Estimation'', 2nd Edition, Springer, p 37&lt;/ref&gt; However, under mild conditions, a minimal sufficient statistic does always exist. In particular, in Euclidean space, these conditions always hold if the random variables (associated with &lt;math&gt;P_\theta&lt;/math&gt; ) are all discrete or are all continuous.

If there exists a minimal sufficient statistic, and this is usually the case, then every [[Completeness (statistics)|complete]] sufficient statistic is necessarily minimal sufficient&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann and Casella (1998), ''Theory of Point Estimation'', 2nd Edition, Springer, page 42&lt;/ref&gt;(note that this statement does not exclude the option of a pathological case in which a complete sufficient exists while there is no minimal sufficient statistic). While it is hard to find cases in which a minimal sufficient statistic does not exist, it is not so hard to find cases in which there is no complete statistic.

The collection of likelihood ratios &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{L(\theta_1\mid X)}{L(\theta_2\mid X)}\right\}&lt;/math&gt; is a minimal sufficient statistic if &lt;math&gt;P(X\mid \theta)&lt;/math&gt; is discrete or has a density function.

==Examples==
===Bernoulli distribution===

If ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;....,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are independent [[Bernoulli trial|Bernoulli-distributed]] random variables with expected value ''p'', then the sum ''T''(''X'') =&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a sufficient statistic for ''p'' (here 'success' corresponds to ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and 'failure' to  ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0; so ''T'' is the total number of successes)

This is seen by considering the joint probability distribution:

:&lt;math&gt; \Pr\{X=x\}=\Pr\{X_1=x_1,X_2=x_2,\ldots,X_n=x_n\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Because the observations are independent, this can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
p^{x_1}(1-p)^{1-x_1} p^{x_2}(1-p)^{1-x_2}\cdots p^{x_n}(1-p)^{1-x_n} &lt;/math&gt;

and, collecting powers of ''p'' and 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'',  gives

:&lt;math&gt;
p^{\sum x_i}(1-p)^{n-\sum x_i}=p^{T(x)}(1-p)^{n-T(x)}
&lt;/math&gt;

which satisfies the factorization criterion, with ''h''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 being just a constant.

Note the crucial feature: the unknown parameter ''p'' interacts with the data ''x'' only via the statistic ''T''(''x'') =&amp;nbsp;Σ&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

As a concrete application, this gives a procedure for creating a [[Fair_coin#Fair_results_from_a_biased_coin|fair coin from a biased coin]].

===Uniform distribution===
{{see also|German tank problem}}
If ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are independent and [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly distributed]] on the interval [0,''θ''], then ''T''(''X'') = max(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is sufficient for θ — the [[sample maximum]] is a sufficient statistic for the population maximum.

To see this, consider the joint [[probability density function]] of ''X''=(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;). Because the observations are independent, the pdf can be written as a product of individual densities

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f_X(x_1,\ldots,x_n)
  &amp;= \frac{1}{\theta}\mathbf{1}_{\{0\leq x_1\leq\theta\}} \cdots
     \frac{1}{\theta}\mathbf{1}_{\{0\leq x_n\leq\theta\}} \\
  &amp;= \frac{1}{\theta^n}\mathbf{1}_{\{0\leq\min\{x_i\}\}}\mathbf{1}_{\{\max\{x_i\}\leq\theta\}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''1'''&lt;sub&gt;{''...''}&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[indicator function]].  Thus the density takes form required by the Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem, where ''h''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''1'''&lt;sub&gt;{min{''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}≥0}&lt;/sub&gt;, and the rest of the expression is a function of only ''θ'' and ''T''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;max{''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}.

In fact, the [[minimum-variance unbiased estimator]] (MVUE) for ''θ'' is

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{n+1}{n}T(X). &lt;/math&gt;

This is the sample maximum, scaled to correct for the [[bias of an estimator|bias]], and is MVUE by the [[Lehmann–Scheffé theorem]]. Unscaled sample maximum ''T''(''X'') is the [[maximum likelihood estimator]] for ''θ''.

===Uniform distribution (with two parameters)===

If &lt;math&gt;X_1,...,X_n&lt;/math&gt; are independent and [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly distributed]] on the interval &lt;math&gt;[\alpha, \beta]&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are unknown parameters), then &lt;math&gt;T(X_1^n)=\left(\min_{1 \leq i \leq n}X_i,\max_{1 \leq i \leq n}X_i\right)&lt;/math&gt; is a two-dimensional sufficient statistic for &lt;math&gt;(\alpha\, , \, \beta)&lt;/math&gt;.

To see this, consider the joint [[probability density function]] of &lt;math&gt;X_1^n=(X_1,\ldots,X_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Because the observations are independent, the pdf can be written as a product of individual densities, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f_{X_1^n}(x_1^n)
  &amp;= \prod_{i=1}^n \left({1 \over \beta-\alpha}\right) \mathbf{1}_{ \{ \alpha \leq x_i \leq \beta \} }
  = \left({1 \over \beta-\alpha}\right)^n \mathbf{1}_{ \{ \alpha \leq x_i \leq \beta, \, \forall \, i = 1,\ldots,n\}} \\
  &amp;= \left({1 \over \beta-\alpha}\right)^n \mathbf{1}_{ \{ \alpha \, \leq \, \min_{1 \leq i \leq n}X_i \} } \mathbf{1}_{ \{ \max_{1 \leq i \leq n}X_i \, \leq \, \beta \} }.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The joint density of the sample takes the form required by the Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem, by letting

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
h(x_1^n)= 1, \quad
g_{(\alpha, \beta)}(x_1^n)= \left({1 \over \beta-\alpha}\right)^n \mathbf{1}_{ \{ \alpha \, \leq \, \min_{1 \leq i \leq n}X_i \} } \mathbf{1}_{ \{ \max_{1 \leq i \leq n}X_i \, \leq \, \beta \} }.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;h(x_1^n)&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on the parameter &lt;math&gt;(\alpha, \beta)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_{(\alpha \, , \, \beta)}(x_1^n)&lt;/math&gt; depends only on &lt;math&gt;x_1^n&lt;/math&gt; through the function &lt;math&gt;T(X_1^n)= \left(\min_{1 \leq i \leq n}X_i,\max_{1 \leq i \leq n}X_i\right),&lt;/math&gt;

the Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem implies &lt;math&gt;T(X_1^n) = \left(\min_{1 \leq i \leq n}X_i,\max_{1 \leq i \leq n}X_i\right)&lt;/math&gt; is a sufficient statistic for &lt;math&gt;(\alpha\, , \, \beta)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Poisson distribution===

If ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;....,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are independent and have a [[Poisson distribution]] with parameter ''λ'', then the sum ''T''(''X'') =&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a sufficient statistic for&amp;nbsp;''λ''.

To see this, consider the joint probability distribution:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Pr(X=x)=P(X_1=x_1,X_2=x_2,\ldots,X_n=x_n).
&lt;/math&gt;

Because the observations are independent, this can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x_1} \over x_1 !} \cdot
{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x_2} \over x_2 !} \cdots
{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x_n} \over x_n !}
&lt;/math&gt;

which may be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
e^{-n\lambda} \lambda^{(x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n)} \cdot
{1 \over x_1 ! x_2 !\cdots x_n ! }
&lt;/math&gt;

which shows that the factorization criterion is satisfied, where ''h''(''x'') is the reciprocal of the product of the factorials.  Note the parameter λ interacts with the data only through its sum ''T''(''X'').

===Normal distribution===

If &lt;math&gt;X_1,\cdots,X_n&lt;/math&gt; are independent and [[Normal distribution|normally distributed]] with expected value &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; (a parameter) and known finite variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2,&lt;/math&gt; then 

:&lt;math&gt;T(X_1^n)=\overline{x}=\frac1n\sum_{i=1}^nX_i&lt;/math&gt; 

is a sufficient statistic for &lt;math&gt;\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

To see this, consider the joint [[probability density function]] of &lt;math&gt;X_1^n=(X_1,\dots,X_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Because the observations are independent, the pdf can be written as a product of individual densities, i.e. -

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f_{X_1^n}(x_1^n)
  &amp; = \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp \left (-\frac{(x_i-\theta)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right ) \\ [6pt]
   &amp;= (2\pi\sigma^2)^{-\frac{n}{2}} \exp \left ( -\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(x_i-\theta)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right ) \\ [6pt]
  &amp; = (2\pi\sigma^2)^{-\frac{n}{2}} \exp \left (-\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{ \left ( \left (x_i-\overline{x} \right ) - \left (\theta-\overline{x} \right ) \right )^2}{2\sigma^2} \right ) \\ [6pt]
  &amp; = (2\pi\sigma^2)^{-\frac{n}{2}} \exp \left( -{1\over2\sigma^2} \left(\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\overline{x})^2 + \sum_{i=1}^n(\theta-\overline{x})^2 -2\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\overline{x})(\theta-\overline{x})\right) \right) \\ [6pt] 
  &amp;= (2\pi\sigma^2)^{-\frac{n}{2}} \exp \left( -{1\over2\sigma^2} \left (\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\overline{x})^2 + n(\theta-\overline{x})^2 \right ) \right ) &amp;&amp; \sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\overline{x})(\theta-\overline{x})=0 \\ [6pt]
  &amp;= (2\pi\sigma^2)^{-\frac{n}{2}} \exp \left( -{1\over2\sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\overline{x})^2 \right ) \exp \left (-\frac{n}{2\sigma^2} (\theta-\overline{x})^2 \right )

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The joint density of the sample takes the form required by the Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem, by letting

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
h(x_1^n) &amp;= (2\pi\sigma^2)^{-\frac{n}{2}} \exp \left( -{1\over2\sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\overline{x})^2 \right ) \\[6pt]
g_{\theta}(x_1^n) &amp;=  \exp \left (-\frac{n}{2\sigma^2} (\theta-\overline{x})^2 \right )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;h(x_1^n)&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on the parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_{\theta}(x_1^n)&lt;/math&gt; depends only on &lt;math&gt;x_1^n&lt;/math&gt; through the function 

:&lt;math&gt;T(X_1^n)=\overline{x}=\frac1n\sum_{i=1}^nX_i,&lt;/math&gt;

the Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem implies &lt;math&gt;T(X_1^n)&lt;/math&gt; is a sufficient statistic for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.

(If &lt;math&gt; \sigma^2 &lt;/math&gt; is unknown: since &lt;math&gt;s^2  = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \left(x_i - \overline{x} \right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;,  the above likelihood can be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f_{X_1^n}(x_1^n)= (2\pi\sigma^2)^{-\frac{n}{2}} \exp ( -\frac{n-1}{2\sigma^2}s^2 ) \exp \left (-\frac{n}{2\sigma^2} (\theta-\overline{x})^2 \right )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

the Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem still holds and implies that &lt;math&gt;(\overline{x},s^2)&lt;/math&gt; is a joint sufficient statistic for &lt;math&gt; ( \theta , \sigma^2) &lt;/math&gt;.

===Exponential distribution===

If &lt;math&gt;X_1,\dots,X_n&lt;/math&gt; are independent and [[Exponential distribution|exponentially distributed]] with expected value ''θ'' (an unknown real-valued positive parameter), then &lt;math&gt;T(X_1^n)=\sum_{i=1}^nX_i&lt;/math&gt; is a sufficient statistic for θ.

To see this, consider the joint [[probability density function]] of &lt;math&gt;X_1^n=(X_1,\dots,X_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Because the observations are independent, the pdf can be written as a product of individual densities, i.e. -

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f_{X_1^n}(x_1^n)
  &amp;= \prod_{i=1}^n {1 \over \theta}  \, e^{ {-1 \over \theta}x_i }
   =               {1 \over \theta^n}\, e^{ {-1 \over \theta} \sum_{i=1}^nx_i }.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The joint density of the sample takes the form required by the Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem, by letting

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
h(x_1^n)= 1,\,\,\,
g_{\theta}(x_1^n)= {1 \over \theta^n}\, e^{ {-1 \over \theta} \sum_{i=1}^nx_i }.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;h(x_1^n)&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on the parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_{\theta}(x_1^n)&lt;/math&gt; depends only on &lt;math&gt;x_1^n&lt;/math&gt; through the function &lt;math&gt;T(X_1^n)=\sum_{i=1}^nX_i&lt;/math&gt;

the Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem implies &lt;math&gt;T(X_1^n)=\sum_{i=1}^nX_i&lt;/math&gt; is a sufficient statistic for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.

===Gamma distribution===

If &lt;math&gt;X_1,\dots,X_n&lt;/math&gt; are independent and distributed as a [[Gamma distribution|&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(\alpha \, , \, \beta) &lt;/math&gt;]], where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are unknown parameters of a [[Gamma distribution]], then &lt;math&gt;T(X_1^n) = \left( \prod_{i=1}^n{X_i} , \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \right)&lt;/math&gt; is a two-dimensional sufficient statistic for &lt;math&gt;(\alpha, \beta)&lt;/math&gt;.

To see this, consider the joint [[probability density function]] of &lt;math&gt;X_1^n=(X_1,\dots,X_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Because the observations are independent, the pdf can be written as a product of individual densities, i.e. -

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f_{X_1^n}(x_1^n)
  &amp;= \prod_{i=1}^n \left({1 \over \Gamma(\alpha) \beta^{\alpha}}\right) x_i^{\alpha -1} e^{{-1 \over \beta}x_i}
  &amp;= \left({1 \over \Gamma(\alpha) \beta^{\alpha}}\right)^n \left(\prod_{i=1}^n x_i\right)^{\alpha-1} e^{{-1 \over \beta} \sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The joint density of the sample takes the form required by the Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem, by letting

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
h(x_1^n)= 1,\,\,\,
g_{(\alpha \, , \, \beta)}(x_1^n)= \left({1 \over \Gamma(\alpha) \beta^{\alpha}}\right)^n \left(\prod_{i=1}^n x_i\right)^{\alpha-1} e^{{-1 \over \beta} \sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;h(x_1^n)&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on the parameter &lt;math&gt;(\alpha\, , \, \beta)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_{(\alpha \, , \, \beta)}(x_1^n)&lt;/math&gt; depends only on &lt;math&gt;x_1^n&lt;/math&gt; through the function &lt;math&gt;T(x_1^n)= \left( \prod_{i=1}^n{x_i} , \sum_{i=1}^n{x_i} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

the Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem implies &lt;math&gt;T(X_1^n)= \left( \prod_{i=1}^n{X_i} , \sum_{i=1}^n{X_i} \right)&lt;/math&gt; is a sufficient statistic for &lt;math&gt;(\alpha\, , \, \beta).&lt;/math&gt;

==Rao–Blackwell theorem==

'''Sufficiency''' finds a useful application in the [[Rao–Blackwell theorem]], which  states that if ''g''(''X'') is any kind of estimator of ''θ'', then typically the conditional expectation of ''g''(''X'') given sufficient statistic ''T''(''X'') is a better estimator of ''θ'', and is never worse.  Sometimes one can very easily construct a very crude estimator ''g''(''X''), and then evaluate that conditional expected value to get an estimator that is in various senses optimal.

==Exponential family==
{{main|Exponential family}}
According to the '''Pitman–Koopman–Darmois theorem,''' among families of probability distributions whose domain does not vary with the parameter being estimated, only in [[exponential family|exponential families]] is there a sufficient statistic whose dimension remains bounded as sample size increases. Less tersely, suppose &lt;math&gt;X_n, n = 1, 2, 3, \dots&lt;/math&gt; are [[independent identically distributed]] random variables whose distribution is known to be in some family of probability distributions with fixed support. Only if that family is an exponential family there is a (possibly vector-valued) sufficient statistic &lt;math&gt;T(X_1, \dots, X_n)&lt;/math&gt; whose number of scalar components does not increase as the sample size ''n'' increases.

This theorem shows that sufficiency (or rather, the existence of a scalar or vector-valued of bounded dimension sufficient statistic) sharply restricts the possible forms of the distribution.

==Other types of sufficiency==
===Bayesian sufficiency===

An alternative formulation of the condition that a statistic be sufficient, set in a Bayesian context, involves the posterior distributions obtained by using the full data-set and by using only a statistic. Thus the requirement is that, for almost every ''x'',

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr(\theta\mid X=x) = \Pr(\theta\mid T(X)=t(x)). &lt;/math&gt;

More generally, without assuming a parametric model, we can say that the statistics ''T'' is ''predictive sufficient'' if

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr(X'=x'\mid X=x) = \Pr(X'=x'\mid T(X)=t(x)).&lt;/math&gt;

It turns out that this "Bayesian sufficiency" is a consequence of the formulation above,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32327">[[File:Trolley problem.png|thumb|The trolley problem: should you pull the lever to divert the runaway trolley onto the side track?]]
The '''trolley problem''' is a [[thought experiment]] in [[ethics]]. The general form of the problem is this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
You see a runaway [[tram|trolley]] moving toward five tied-up (or otherwise incapacitated) people lying on the tracks. You are standing next to a lever that controls a [[railroad switch|switch]]. If you pull the lever, the trolley will be redirected onto a side track and the five people on the main track will be saved. However, there is a single person lying on the side track. You have two options:

# Do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the main track.
# Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.

Which is the more ethical option?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The modern form of the problem was first introduced by [[Philippa Foot]] in 1967,&lt;ref name="Philippa Foot 1978"&gt;Philippa Foot, ''[http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ362/hallam/Readings/FootDoubleEffect.pdf The Problem of Abortion and the Doctrine of the Double Effect]'' in ''Virtues and Vices'' (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1978) (originally appeared in the ''Oxford Review'', Number 5, 1967.)&lt;/ref&gt; but also extensively analysed by [[Judith Thomson]],&lt;ref&gt;Judith Jarvis Thomson, ''[https://learning.hccs.edu/faculty/david.poston/phil1301.80361/readings-for-march-31/JJ%20Thomson%20-%20Killing-%20Letting%20Die-%20and%20the%20Trolley%20Problem.pdf Killing, Letting Die, and the Trolley Problem]'', 59 The Monist 204-17 (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Judith Jarvis Thomson 1985"&gt;Judith Jarvis Thomson, ''[http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/Courses/thomsonTROLLEY.pdf The Trolley Problem]'', 94 Yale Law Journal 1395–1415 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frances Kamm]],&lt;ref&gt;Francis Myrna Kamm, ''Harming Some to Save Others'', 57 Philosophical Studies 227-60 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Unger]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Unger, ''[[Living High and Letting Die]]'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; However an earlier version, in which the one person to be sacrificed on the track was the [[switchman]]'s child, was part of a moral questionnaire given to undergraduates at the [[University of Wisconsin]] in 1905,&lt;ref&gt;Frank Chapman Sharp, ''A Study of the Influence of Custom on the Moral Judgment'' Bulletin of the University of Wisconsin no.236 (Madison, June 1908), 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Chapman Sharp, ''Ethics'' (New York: The Century Co, 1928), 42-44, 122.&lt;/ref&gt; and the German legal scholar [[Hans Welzel]] discussed a similar problem in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Welzel, ''ZStW Zeitschrift für die gesamte Strafrechtswissenschaft'' 63 [1951], 47ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2001, the trolley problem and its variants have been used extensively in empirical research on [[moral psychology]]. Trolley problems have also been a topic of popular books.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/books/review/would-you-kill-the-fat-man-and-the-trolley-problem.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; The problem often arises in the discussion of the ethics of the design of [[autonomous vehicle]]s.

== Original dilemma ==
Foot's original structure of the problem ran as follows:

{{quote|Suppose that a judge or magistrate is faced with rioters demanding that a culprit be found for a certain crime and threatening otherwise to take their own bloody revenge on a particular section of the community. The real culprit being unknown, the judge sees himself as able to prevent the bloodshed only by framing some innocent person and having him executed. Beside this example is placed another in which a pilot whose airplane is about to crash is deciding whether to steer from a more to a less inhabited area. To make the parallel as close as possible it may rather be supposed that he is the driver of a runaway tram which he can only steer from one narrow track on to another; five men are working on one track and one man on the other; anyone on the track he enters is bound to be killed. In the case of the riots the mob have five hostages, so that in both examples the exchange is supposed to be one man's life for the lives of five.&lt;ref name="Philippa Foot 1978" /&gt;}}

A [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] view asserts that it is obligatory to steer to the track with one man on it. According to classical utilitarianism, such a decision would be not only permissible, but, morally speaking, the better option (the other option being no action at all).&lt;ref&gt;Barcalow, Emmett, ''Moral Philosophy: Theories and Issues.'' Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate viewpoint is that since moral wrongs are already in place in the situation, moving to another track constitutes a participation in the moral wrong, making one partially responsible for the death when otherwise no one would be responsible. An opponent of action may also point to the [[commensurability (ethics)|incommensurability]] of human lives. Under some interpretations of [[duty|moral obligation]], simply being present in this situation and being able to influence its outcome constitutes an obligation to participate. If this is the case, then deciding to do nothing would be considered an immoral act if one values five lives more than one.

[[File:The trolley problem.svg|thumbnail|upright=1.5|Five variants of the trolley problem: the original Switch, the Fat Man, the Fat Villain, the Loop and the Man in the Yard]]
The trolley problem is a specific ethical thought experiment among several that highlights the difference between [[deontological ethics|deontological]] and [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] ethical systems.  The central question that these dilemmas bring to light is on whether or not it is right to actively inhibit the [[utility]] of an individual if doing so produces a greater utility for other individuals.

The initial trolley problem also supports comparison to other, related, dilemmas:

=== The Fat Man ===
{{quote|As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. You are on a bridge under which it will pass, and you can stop it by putting something very heavy in front of it. As it happens, there is a very fat man next to you – your only way to stop the trolley is to push him over the bridge and onto the track, killing him to save five. Should you proceed?}}

Resistance to this course of action seems strong; when asked, a majority of people will approve of pulling the switch to save a net of four lives, but will disapprove of pushing the fat man to save a net of four lives.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer, ''Ethics and Intuitions'' The Journal of Ethics (2005). http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/200510--.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to attempts to find a relevant moral distinction between the two cases.

One clear distinction is that in the first case, one does not intend harm towards anyone – harming the one is just a [[Unintended consequence|side effect]] of switching the trolley away from the five. However, in the second case, harming the one is an integral part of the plan to save the five. This is an argument which [[Shelly Kagan]] considers (and ultimately rejects) in his first book ''The Limits of Morality''.&lt;ref&gt;Shelly Kagan, ''The Limits of Morality'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

A claim can be made that the difference between the two cases is that in the second, you intend someone's death to save the five, and this is wrong, whereas, in the first, you have no such intention. This solution is essentially an application of the [[doctrine of double effect]], which says that you may take action which has bad side effects, but deliberately intending harm (even for good causes) is wrong.

Another distinction is that the first case is similar to a pilot in an airplane that has lost power and is about to crash into a heavily populated area. Even if the pilot knows for sure that innocent people will die if he redirects the plane to a less populated area—people who are "uninvolved"—he will actively turn the plane without hesitation. It may well be considered noble to sacrifice your own life to protect others, but morally or legally allowing murder of one innocent person to save five people may be [[insufficient justification]].{{Clarify|date=February 2012}}

=== The fat villain ===
The further development of this example involves the case, where the fat man is, in fact, the villain who put these five people in peril. In this instance, pushing the villain to his death, especially to save five innocent people, seems not only morally justifiable but perhaps even imperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Carneades.org|title=The Fat Villain Trolley Problem (90 Second Philosophy)|date=2013-10-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQXPDfwhGsc|accessdate=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is essentially related to another thought experiment, known as [[ticking time bomb scenario]], which forces one to choose between two morally questionable acts.

=== The loop variant ===

The claim that it is wrong to ''use'' the death of one to save five runs into a problem with variants like this:

{{quote|As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people and you can divert it onto a secondary track. However, in this variant the secondary track later rejoins the main track, so diverting the trolley still leaves it on a track which leads to the five people. But, the person on the secondary track is a fat person who, when he is killed by the trolley, will stop it from continuing on to the five people. Should you flip the switch?}}

The only physical difference here is the addition of an extra piece of track.  This seems trivial since the trolley will never travel down it.  The reason this might affect someone's decision is that in this case, the death of the one actually is part of the plan to save the five.

The rejoining variant may not be fatal to the "using a person as a means" argument. This has been suggested by Michael J. Costa in his 1987 article "Another Trip on the Trolley", where he points out that if we fail to act in this scenario we will effectively be allowing the five to become a means to save the one. If we do nothing, then the impact of the trolley into the five will slow it down and prevent it from circling around and killing the one.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} As in either case some will become a means to saving others, we are permitted to count the numbers. This approach requires that we downplay the moral difference between doing and allowing.

=== Transplant ===
Here is an alternative case, due to [[Judith Jarvis Thomson]],&lt;ref name="Judith Jarvis Thomson 1985" /&gt; containing similar numbers and results, but without a trolley:

{{quote|A brilliant transplant surgeon has five patients, each in need of a different organ, each of whom will die without that organ. Unfortunately, there are no organs available to perform any of these five transplant operations. A healthy young traveler, just passing through the city the doctor works in, comes in for a routine checkup. In the course of doing the checkup, the doctor discovers that his organs are compatible with all five of his dying patients. Suppose further that if the young man were to disappear, no one would suspect the doctor. Do you support the morality of the doctor to kill that tourist and provide his healthy organs to those five dying persons and save their lives?}}

=== The man in the yard ===
Unger argues extensively against traditional non-utilitarian responses to trolley problems. This is one of his examples:

{{quote| As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. You can divert its path by colliding another trolley into it, but if you do, both will be derailed and go down a hill, and into a yard where a man is sleeping in a hammock. He would be killed. Should you proceed?}}

Responses to this are partly dependent on whether the reader has already encountered the standard trolley problem (since there is a desire to keep one's responses consistent), but Unger notes that people who have not encountered such problems before are quite likely to say that, in this case, the proposed action would be wrong.

Unger therefore argues that different responses to these sorts of problems are based more on psychology than ethics – in this new case, he says, the only important difference is that the man in the yard does not seem particularly "involved". Unger claims that people therefore believe the man is not "fair game", but says that this lack of involvement in the scenario cannot make a moral difference.

Unger also considers cases which are more complex than the original trolley problem, involving more than just two results. In one such case, it is possible to do something which will (a) save the five and kill four (passengers of one or more trolleys and/or the hammock-sleeper), (b) save the five and kill three, (c) save the five and kill two, (d) save the five and kill one, or (e) do nothing and let five die.

== Empirical research ==
{{See also|Moral psychology|Dual process theory (moral psychology)}}
In 2001, [[Joshua Greene (psychologist)|Joshua Greene]] and colleagues published the results of the first significant empirical investigation of people's responses to trolley problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=Joshua D.|last2=Sommerville|first2=R.

== Survey data ==
The trolley problem has been the subject of many surveys in which approximately 90% of respondents have chosen to kill the one and save the five.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://healthland.time.com/2011/12/05/would-you-kill-one-person-to-save-five-new-research-on-a-classic-debate/|title='Trolley Problem': Virtual-Reality Test for Moral Dilemma – TIME.com|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the situation is modified where the one sacrificed for the five was a relative or romantic partner, respondents are much less likely to be willing to sacrifice their life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://137.140.1.71/jsec/articles/volume4/issue3/bleskefinal.pdf Journal of Social, Evolutionary, and Cultural Psychology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411182922/http://137.140.1.71/jsec/articles/volume4/issue3/bleskefinal.pdf |date=2012-04-11 }} – {{ISSN|1933-5377}} – volume 4(3). 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 survey published in a 2013 paper by David Bourget and [[David Chalmers]] shows that 69.9% of professional philosophers would switch (sacrifice the one individual to save five lives) in the case of the trolley problem. 8% would not switch, and the remaining 24% had another view or could not answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bourget|first1=David|last2=Chalmers|first2=David J.|year=2013|title=What do Philosophers believe?|url=http://philpapers.org/archive/BOUWDP|accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications for autonomous vehicles ==
Problems analogous to the trolley problem arise in the design of [[autonomous car]]s, in situations where the car's [[software]] is forced during a potential crash scenario to choose between multiple courses of action (sometimes including options which include the death of the car's occupants), all of which may cause harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/the-ethics-of-autonomous-cars/280360/|title=The Ethics of Autonomous Cars|date=October 8, 2013|publisher=The Atlantic|author=Patrick Lin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2014/06/18/when-should-your-driverless-car-from-google-be-allowed-to-kill-you/|title=When Should Your Driverless Car From Google Be Allowed To Kill You?|date=2014-06-18|publisher=Forbes|author=Tim Worstall}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=1510.03346|author2=Azim Shariff|title=Autonomous Vehicles Need Experimental Ethics: Are We Ready for Utilitarian Cars?|date=2015-10-13|author1=Jean-François Bonnefon|author3=Iyad Rahwan|doi=10.1126/science.aaf2654|volume=352|journal=Science|pages=1573–1576|bibcode=2016Sci...352.1573B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/view/542626/why-self-driving-cars-must-be-programmed-to-kill/|title=Why Self-Driving Cars Must Be Programmed to Kill|date=October 22, 2015|publisher=MIT Technology review|author=Emerging Technology From the arXiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Shariff|first2=Azim|last3=Rahwan|first3=Iyad|year=2016|title=The social dilemma of autonomous vehicles|journal=Science|volume=352|issue=6293|pages=1573–1576|doi=10.1126/science.aaf2654|first1=Jean-François|last1=Bonnefon|pmid=27339987|arxiv=1510.03346|bibcode=2016Sci...352.1573B}}&lt;/ref&gt; A platform called [[Moral Machine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moralmachine.mit.edu|title=Moral Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created by [[MIT Media Lab]] to allow the public to express their opinions on what decisions autonomous vehicles should make in scenarios that use the trolley problem paradigm.

In 2016, the government of Germany constituted an ethical commission that addressed the implications of autonomous driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmvi.de/SharedDocs/DE/Publikationen/G/bericht-der-ethik-kommission.html|title=Bericht der Ethik-Kommission Automatisiertes und vernetztes Fahren|author=BMVI Commission|first=|date=June 20, 2016|website=|publisher=Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (German: Bundesministerium für Verkehr und digitale Infrastruktur)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115224017/http://www.bmvi.de/SharedDocs/DE/Publikationen/G/bericht-der-ethik-kommission.html|archive-date=2017-11-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the commission defined 20 rules for autonomous and connected driving, which will be obligatory for upcoming laws regarding the production of autonomous cars.

== In popular culture ==
In an [[urban legend]] that has existed since at least the mid-1960s, the decision is described as having been made in real life by a drawbridge keeper who was forced to choose between sacrificing a passenger train and his own four-year-old son.&lt;ref name="SnopesDrawbridge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snopes.com/glurge/drawbridge.asp|title=The Drawbridge Keeper|author=Barbara Mikkelson|date=27 February 2010|accessdate=20 April 2016|work=[[Snopes.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a 2003 Czech [[short film]] titled ''[[Most (2003 film)|Most]]'' (''The Bridge'' in English) and ''The Bridge'' (US) which deals with a similar plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0345672/|title=Most (2003)|author=lewis-8|date=25 January 2003|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version is often given as an illustration of the [[Christianity|Christian]] belief that [[penal substitution|God sacrificed his son]], [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref name="SnopesDrawbridge" /&gt;

In the 2010 video game ''[[Fable 3]]'', one of the earliest moral choices players make involves having to choose to execute either their childhood sweetheart or a crowd of protesters. If a decision is not made within a certain period of time, the king announces that the player has five seconds to make up their mind, "or they all die."

== Criticism ==

In a 2014 paper published in the ''Social and Personality Psychology Compass'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/spc3.12131|last1=Bauman|first1=Christopher W.|last2=McGraw|first2=A.

Brianna Rennix and Nathan J. Robinson of ''[[Current Affairs (magazine)|Current Affairs]]'' go even further and assert that the thought experiment is not only useless but downright detrimental to human psychology. The authors are opining that to make cold calculations about hypothetical situations in which every alternative will result in one or more gruesome deaths is to encourage a type of thinking that is devoid of human empathy and assumes a mandate to decide who lives or dies. They also question the premise of the scenario. "If I am forced against my will into a situation where people will die, and I have no ability to stop it, how is my choice a “moral” choice between meaningfully different options, as opposed to a horror show I’ve just been thrust into, in which I have no meaningful agency at all?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://editor.currentaffairs.org/2017/11/the-trolley-problem-will-tell-you-nothing-useful-about-morality/|title=The Trolley Problem Will Tell You Nothing Useful About Morality|last1=Rennix|first1=Brianna|last2=Robinson|first2=Nathan J.|work=[[Current Affairs (magazine)|Current Affairs]]|date=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Probability fundamentals}}
{{anchor|Primary|Simple|Cylindrical|Metric|2|3}}A '''Venn diagram''' (also called '''primary diagram''', '''set diagram''' or '''logic diagram''') is a [[diagram]] that shows ''all'' possible [[logic]]al relations between a finite collection of different [[Set (mathematics)|sets]].  These diagrams depict [[element (mathematics)|element]]s as points in the plane, and [[set (mathematics)|set]]s as regions inside closed curves.  A Venn diagram consists of multiple overlapping closed curves, usually circles, each representing a set.  The points inside a curve labelled ''S'' represent elements of the set ''S'', while points outside the boundary represent elements not in the set ''S''.   This lends to easily read visualizations; for example, the set of all elements that are members of both sets ''S'' and ''T'', ''S''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''T'', is represented visually by the area of overlap of the regions ''S'' and ''T''. In Venn diagrams the curves are overlapped in every possible way, showing all possible relations between the sets.  They are thus a special case of [[Euler diagram|Euler diagrams]], which do not necessarily show all relations. Venn diagrams were conceived around 1880 by [[John Venn]]. They are used to teach elementary [[set theory]], as well as illustrate simple set relationships in [[probability]], [[logic]], [[statistics]], [[linguistics]], and [[computer science]].

A Venn diagram in which the area of each shape is proportional to the number of elements it contains is called an '''area-proportional''' or '''scaled Venn diagram'''.

==Example==
[[File:Венов дијаграм.svg|thumb|left|Sets A (creatures with two legs) and B (creatures that can fly)]]
This example involves two [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], A and B, represented here as coloured circles. The orange circle, set A, represents all living creatures that are two-legged. The blue circle, set B, represents the living creatures that can fly. Each separate type of creature can be imagined as a point somewhere in the diagram.  Living creatures that both can fly ''and'' have two legs—for example, parrots—are then in both sets, so they correspond to points in the region where the blue and orange circles overlap. It is important to note that this overlapping region would only contain those elements (in this example creatures) that are members of both set A (two-legged creatures) and are also members of set B (flying creatures.)

Humans and penguins are bipedal, and so are then in the orange circle, but since they cannot fly they appear in the left part of the orange circle, where it does not overlap with the blue circle. Mosquitoes have six legs, and fly, so the point for mosquitoes is in the part of the blue circle that does not overlap with the orange one. Creatures that are not two-legged and cannot fly (for example, whales and spiders) would all be represented by points outside both circles.

The combined region of sets A and B is called the ''[[union (set theory)|union]]'' of A and B, denoted by {{nowrap|A ∪ B}}. The union in this case contains all living creatures that are either two-legged or that can fly (or both).

The region in both A and B, where the two sets overlap, is called the ''[[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]'' of A and B, denoted by {{nowrap|A ∩ B}}. For example, the intersection of the two sets is not empty, because there ''are'' points that represent creatures that are in ''both'' the orange and blue circles.

Venn diagrams were introduced in 1880 by [[John Venn]] in a paper entitled ''On the Diagrammatic and Mechanical Representation of Propositions and Reasonings'' in the "Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science", about the different ways to represent [[proposition]]s by diagrams.&lt;ref name="Venn1880_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Venn1880_2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sandifer2003"/&gt; The use of these types of [[diagram]]s in [[formal logic]], according to [[Frank Ruskey]] and Mark Weston, is "not an easy history to trace, but it is certain that the diagrams that are popularly associated with Venn, in fact, originated much earlier. They are rightly associated with Venn, however, because he comprehensively surveyed and formalized their usage, and was the first to generalize them".&lt;ref name="Ruskey2005"/&gt;

Venn himself did not use the term "Venn diagram" and referred to his invention as "[[Eulerian Circle]]s".&lt;ref name="Sandifer2003"/&gt; For example, in the opening sentence of his 1880 article Venn writes, "Schemes of diagrammatic representation have been so familiarly introduced into logical treatises during the last century or so, that many readers, even those who have made no professional study of logic, may be supposed to be acquainted with the general nature and object of such devices. Of these schemes one only, viz. that commonly called 'Eulerian circles,' has met with any general acceptance..."&lt;ref name="Venn1880_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Venn1880_2"/&gt; Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson) includes "Venn's Method of Diagrams" as well as "Euler's Method of Diagrams" in an "Appendix, Addressed to Teachers" of his book "Symbolic Logic" (4th edition published in 1896).  The term "Venn diagram" was later used by [[Clarence Irving Lewis]] in 1918, in his book "A Survey of Symbolic Logic".&lt;ref name="Ruskey2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis1918"/&gt;

Venn diagrams are very similar to [[Euler diagram]]s, which were invented by [[Leonhard Euler]] in the 18th century.&lt;ref group="note" name="NB_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Venn1881"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gailand_1967"/&gt; M.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;Baron has noted that [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] (1646–1716) in the 17th century produced similar diagrams before Euler, but much of it was unpublished.&lt;ref name="Leibniz_1690"/&gt; She also observes even earlier Euler-like diagrams by [[Ramon Llull]] in the 13th Century.&lt;ref name="Baron_1969"/&gt;

In the 20th century, Venn diagrams were further developed. D.&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;Henderson showed in 1963 that the existence of an ''n''-Venn diagram with ''n''-fold [[rotational symmetry]] implied that ''n'' was a [[prime number]].&lt;ref name="Henderson_1963"/&gt; He also showed that such symmetric Venn diagrams exist when ''n'' is 5 or 7. In 2002 Peter Hamburger found symmetric Venn diagrams for ''n'' = 11 and in 2003, Griggs, Killian, and Savage showed that symmetric Venn diagrams exist for all other primes. Thus rotationally symmetric Venn diagrams exist if and only if ''n'' is a prime number.&lt;ref name="Ruskey_2006"/&gt;

Venn diagrams and Euler diagrams were incorporated as part of instruction in [[set theory]] as part of the [[new math]] movement in the 1960s. Since then, they have also been adopted in the curriculum of other fields such as reading.&lt;ref name="Stategies"/&gt;

A Venn diagram is constructed with a collection of simple closed curves drawn in a plane. According to Lewis,&lt;ref name="Lewis1918"/&gt; the "principle of these diagrams is that classes [or ''[[set (mathematics)|set]]s''] be represented by regions in such relation to one another that all the possible logical relations of these classes can be indicated in the same diagram. That is, the diagram initially leaves room for any possible relation of the classes, and the actual or given relation, can then be specified by indicating that some particular region is null or is not-null".&lt;ref name="Lewis1918"/&gt;{{rp|157}}

Venn diagrams normally comprise overlapping [[circle]]s. The interior of the circle symbolically represents the [[element (mathematics)|element]]s of the set, while the exterior represents elements that are not members of the set. For instance, in a two-set Venn diagram, one circle may represent the group of all [[wood]]en objects, while another circle may represent the set of all tables. The overlapping region or ''[[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]'' would then represent the set of all wooden tables. Shapes other than circles can be employed as shown below by Venn's own higher set diagrams. Venn diagrams do not generally contain information on the relative or absolute sizes ([[cardinality]]) of sets; i.e. they are [[schematic]] diagrams.

Venn diagrams are similar to [[Euler diagram]]s. However, a Venn diagram for ''n'' component sets must contain all 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; hypothetically possible zones that correspond to some combination of inclusion or exclusion in each of the component sets. Euler diagrams contain only the actually possible zones in a given context. In Venn diagrams, a shaded zone may represent an empty zone, whereas in an Euler diagram the corresponding zone is missing from the diagram. For example, if one set represents ''dairy products'' and another ''cheeses'', the Venn diagram contains a zone for cheeses that are not dairy products. Assuming that in the context ''cheese'' means some type of dairy product, the Euler diagram has the cheese zone entirely contained within the dairy-product zone—there is no zone for (non-existent) non-dairy cheese. This means that as the number of contours increases, Euler diagrams are typically less visually complex than the equivalent Venn diagram, particularly if the number of non-empty intersections is small.&lt;ref name="Kent_2004"/&gt;

The difference between Euler and Venn diagrams can be seen in the following example. Take the three sets:

* &lt;math&gt;A = \{1,\, 2,\, 5\}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;B = \{1,\, 6\}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;C = \{4,\, 7\}&lt;/math&gt;

The Venn and the Euler diagram of those sets are:

=={{anchor|Elegant|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11}}Extensions to higher numbers of sets==
Venn diagrams typically represent two or three sets, but there are forms that allow for higher numbers. Shown below, four intersecting spheres form the highest order Venn diagram that has the symmetry of a [[simplex]] and can be visually represented. The 16 intersections correspond to the vertices of a [[tesseract]] (or the cells of a [[16-cell]] respectively).

For higher numbers of sets, some loss of symmetry in the diagrams is unavoidable. Venn was keen to find "symmetrical figures...elegant in themselves,"&lt;ref name="Venn1881"/&gt; that represented higher numbers of sets, and he devised an ''elegant'' four-set diagram using [[ellipse]]s (see below). He also gave a construction for Venn diagrams for ''any'' number of sets, where each successive curve that delimits a set interleaves with previous curves, starting with the three-circle diagram.

[[Anthony William Fairbank Edwards]] constructed a series of Venn diagrams for higher numbers of sets by segmenting the surface of a sphere, which became known as Edwards–Venn diagrams.&lt;ref name="Edwards_2004"/&gt; For example, three sets can be easily represented by taking three hemispheres of the sphere at right angles (''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0). A fourth set can be added to the representation by taking a curve similar to the seam on a tennis ball, which winds up and down around the equator, and so on. The resulting sets can then be projected back to a plane to give ''cogwheel'' diagrams with increasing numbers of teeth, as shown here. These diagrams were devised while designing a [[stained-glass]] window in memory of Venn.&lt;ref name="Edwards_2004"/&gt;

===Other diagrams===
Edwards–Venn diagrams are [[topological equivalence|topologically equivalent]] to diagrams devised by [[Branko Grünbaum]], which were based around intersecting [[polygon]]s with increasing numbers of sides. They are also two-dimensional representations of [[hypercube]]s.

[[Henry John Stephen Smith]] devised similar ''n''-set diagrams using [[sine]] curves&lt;ref name="Edwards_2004"/&gt; with the series of equations
: &lt;math&gt;y_i = \frac {\sin(2^{i }x)}{2 i} \text{ where } 0 \leq i \leq n-2 \text{ and } i \in \mathbb{N}. &lt;/math&gt;

[[Charles Lutwidge Dodgson]] (aka [[Lewis Carroll]]) devised a five-set diagram known as [[Carroll's square (diagram)|Carroll's square]]. Jeremiah Joven Joaquin and Robert James Boyles, on the other hand, proposed supplemental rules for the standard Venn diagram in able to account for certain problem cases. For instance, regarding the issue of representing singular statements, they suggest to consider the Venn diagram circle as a representation of a set of things, and use [[first-order logic]] and [[set theory]] to treat categorical statements as statements about sets. Additionally, they propose to treat singular statements as statements about [[set membership]]. So, for example, to represent the statement “a is F” in this retooled Venn diagram, a small letter “a” may be placed inside the circle that represents the set F.&lt;ref&gt;Joaquin, J.J. and Boyles, R.J.M. (2017). [https://www.pdcnet.org/teachphil/content/teachphil_2017_0040_0002_0161_0180 Teaching Syllogistic Logic via a Retooled Venn Diagrammatical Technique].

=={{anchor|Johnston}}Related concepts==
[[File:Venn3tab.svg|thumb|Venn diagram as a truth table]]
Venn diagrams correspond to [[truth table]]s for the propositions &lt;math&gt;x\in A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x\in B&lt;/math&gt;, etc., in the sense that each region of Venn diagram corresponds to one row of the truth table.&lt;ref name="Grimaldi_2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson_2001"/&gt; This type is also known as Johnston diagram. Another way of representing sets is with John F. Randolph's [[R-diagram]]s.

'''VisSim''' is a visual [[block diagram]] program for simulation of [[dynamical system]]s and [[model based design]] of [[embedded systems]], with its own [[vsual programming language|visual language]]. It is developed by Visual Solutions of [[Westford, Massachusetts]]. Visual Solutions, has been acquired by [[Altair Engineering|Altair]] in August 2015 and its products have been rebranded as solidThinking Embed as a part of [[solidThinking]]'s Model Based Development Suite. With solidThinking Embed, you can develop virtual prototypes of dynamic systems. Models are built by sliding blocks into the work area and wiring them together with the mouse. Embed automatically converts the control diagrams into C-code ready to be downloaded to the target hardware.

VisSim or now solidThinking Embed uses a graphical data flow paradigm to implement dynamic systems based on differential equations. Version 8 adds interactive [[UML state machine|UML]] [[Object Management Group|OMG]] 2 compliant [[State diagram|state chart graphs]] that are placed in VisSim diagrams. This allows the modeling of state based systems such as startup sequencing of process plants or serial protocol decoding.

==Applications==
VisSim/solidThinking Embed is used in [[control system]] design and [[digital signal processing]] for multidomain simulation and design.&lt;ref name=References&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?q=VisSim+Visual+Solutions Books on wide variety of technical subjects referencing VisSim] on the [[Google Books Library Project]]&lt;/ref&gt; It includes blocks for arithmetic, Boolean, and [[transcendental function]]s, as well as [[digital filter]]s, [[transfer function]]s, [[numerical integration]] and interactive plotting.&lt;ref name=userguide&gt;''Visual simulation with student VisSim'', by Karen Darnell, 1996, PWS Pub. Co., Boston, {{ISBN|0-534-95485-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly modeled systems are aeronautical, biological/medical, digital power, electric motor, electrical, hydraulic, mechanical, process, thermal/HVAC and econometric.&lt;ref name=References /&gt;

===Distributing VisSim models===
[[File:VisSim screenshot.PNG|left|thumb|VisSim viewer screenshot with sample model.]]
A read-only version of the software, [http://www.vissim.com/downloads/demos.html VisSim Viewer], is available free of charge and provides a way for people not licensed to use VisSim to run VisSim models.&lt;ref name=Viewer&gt;[http://vissim.com/products/vissim_viewer.html Viewer page] on company website&lt;/ref&gt; This program is intended to allow models to be more widely shared while preserving the model in its published form.&lt;ref name=Viewer /&gt; The viewer will execute any VisSim model, and only allows changes to block and simulation parameters to illustrate different design scenarios. Sliders and buttons may be activated if included in the model.

==Code generation==
The "VisSim/C-Code" add-on generates [[ANSI C]] code for the model, and generates target specific code for on-chip devices like PWM, ADC, encoder, GPIO, I2C etc. This is useful for development of [[embedded systems]]. After the behavior of the controller has been simulated, C-code can be generated, compiled and run on the target. For debugging, VisSim supports an interactive JTAG linkage, called "Hotlink", that allows interactive gain change and plotting of on-target variables. The VisSim generated code has been called efficient and readable, making it well suited for development of embedded systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akademik.unsri.ac.id/download/journal/files/waset/v47-35.pdf Graphical Environment for Modeling Control Systems in Full Scope Training Simulators]&lt;/ref&gt; VisSim's author served on the X3J11 ANSI C committee and wrote several C compilers, in addition to co-authoring a book on C.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Peter+A.+Darnell&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;lr= Books on C by Peter A. Darnell and Philip E. Margolis]&lt;/ref&gt; This deep understanding of ANSI C, and the nature of the resulting [[machine code]] when compiled, is the key to the code generator's efficiency. VisSim can target small [[16-bit]] [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed point]] systems like the [[Texas Instruments]] [[MSP430]], using only 740 bytes flash and 64 bytes of RAM for a small closed-loop [[Pulse-width modulation]] (PWM) actuated system, as well as allowing very high control sample rates over 500&amp;nbsp;kHz on larger [[32-bit]] [[floating point processor]]s like the [[Texas Instruments]] 150&amp;nbsp;MHz F28335.

==Use of model-based development==
{{Main article|Model based design}}
The technique of simulating system performance off-line, and then generating code from the simulation is known as "model-based development". Model-based development for [[embedded system]]s is becoming widely adopted for production systems because it shortens development cycles for hardware development in the same way that [[Model-driven architecture]] shortens production cycles for software development.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LGzS1uiUa7AC Principles of model-driven architecture], Stephen J. Mellor, Addison-Wesley, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Model building]] is a visual way of describing a situation. In an engineering context, instead of writing and solving a [[system of equations]], model building involves using visual "blocks" to solve the problem. The advantage of using models is that in some cases problems which appear difficult if expressed mathematically may be easier to understand when represented pictorially.

VisSim uses a hierarchical composition to create nested block diagrams. A typical model would consist of "virtual plants" composed of various VisSim "layers", combined if necessary with custom blocks written in C or FORTRAN. A virtual controller can be added and tuned to give desired overall system response. [[Graphical control element (software)|Graphical control element]] such as sliders and buttons allow control of [[what-if analysis]] for operator training or controller tuning.

Although VisSim was originally designed for use by [[control engineer]]s, it can be used for any type of mathematical model.

'''Westley Wallace Law''' (January 1, 1923 &amp;ndash; July 29, 2002) was a civil rights leader from [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. He was president of the Savannah chapter of the [[NAACP]], where he led his community and made  great strides in desegregation through [[nonviolent resistance]] from 1950 to 1976. After his time with the NAACP W. W. Law spent much of the rest of his life advocating for African-American history and culture in Savannah. To this end he established the Savannah-Yamacraw Branch of the [[Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History]], the [[Ralph Mark Gilbert Civil Rights Museum]], the [[King-Tisdell Cottage Museum]], the [[Beach Institute of African American Culture]], and the [[Negro Heritage Trail Tour]].

==Background==

W. W. Law was the only son and eldest of ten children born to Geneva Wallace and Westley Law. He began working at the age of ten to help his recently widowed mother while also attending school. In high school, Law joined the NAACP Youth Council and later served as the council's president while in college at [[Savannah State University|Georgia State College]]. His college career was interrupted when he was drafted into military service in [[World War II]]. W. W. Law returned from the war and, with the help of the GI Bill, returned to college where he earned a bachelor's degree in biology.

After graduation Law worked as a mail carrier for the U.S. Postal Service for more than forty years. His job with the Postal Service was endangered, however, when he was fired for his civil rights activism. President [[John F. Kennedy]] and the NAACP stepped in quickly upon hearing of Law's firing and he was reinstated in his job. Mr. Law retired from the Postal Service in 1990. Westley Wallace Law died on July 29, 2002 at his home in Savannah,Georgia.
