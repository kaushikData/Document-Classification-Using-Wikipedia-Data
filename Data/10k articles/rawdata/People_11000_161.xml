'''AbdelRahman Mansour''' ({{lang-ar|عبد الرحمن منصور}}; born in 1987) is an Internet activist, journalist and human rights defender. In 2011, he came up with the idea of turning Egypt's National Police Day on 25 January into a Facebook event, "Revolution of the Egyptian People," sparking the online campaign for pro-democracy demonstrations that later snowballed into a popular uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/9772/meet-abdelrahman-mansour-who-made-25-january-a-dat|title=Jadaliyya|last=جدلية|first=Jadaliyya -|website=Jadaliyya - جدلية|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About to start his compulsory military service in early January 2011, just before [[25 January revolution]], Mansour remained anonymous without announcing his role as the underground Cairo-based administrator of the Facebook page "We are all Khaled Saeed", the main online tool that mobilized the initial mass protests against torture and [[police brutality]], and which culminated weeks later in the ouster of Egyptian strongman [[Hosni Mubarak]], who had ruled the country for the previous three decades.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-revolution-idUSTRE73C18E20110413&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wael Ghonim]], who was living abroad at the time, was the page's publicly known administrator.

== Background==
Abdelrahman was born to a middle-class family in 1987 in Mansoura, Egypt. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in [[Journalism]] and [[Broadcasting]] from [[Mansoura University]] in 2010. After his graduation and immediate conscription, he traveled to the United States in late 2013 to continue his academic studies.

== Career ==
He first became politically active in 2005, joining the protest movement [[Kefaya]] to demand political reforms in Egypt, and later participated in student movements across several Egyptian universities. Since then, he has been active in raising awareness among Arab audiences on the importance of political activism, citizen movements and broadcasting &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://global.ilmanifesto.it/abdelrahman-mansour-the-people-will-do-to-el-sisi-what-they-did-to-mubarak/|title=Abdelrahman Mansour: ‘the people will do to el-Sisi what they did to Mubarak’|date=2016-07-06|work=Il manifesto global|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/11/19/eyewitness-in-gaza-an-egyptian-risks-death-beside-the-palestinians|title=Eyewitness in Gaza: An Egyptian Risks Death Beside the Palestinians|last=Topol|first=Sarah A.|date=2012-11-20|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/01/arab-spring-egypt-silent-protest-160124101244868.html|title=My Arab Spring: Egypt's silent protest|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdelrahman became an active blogger with “Kulina Layla (We are all Layla),” a feminist initiative that provided Arab women with an electronic platform to counter conservative voices in mainstream social media. He worked to expand the platform, introducing it in Morocco and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/9772/meet-abdelrahman-mansour-who-m|title=Jadaliyya|last=جدلية|first=Jadaliyya -|website=Jadaliyya - جدلية|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, he began collaborating with Wael Ghonim to moderate and manage the online page of [[Mohamed ElBaradei|Mohamed Elbaradei]], who had returned to Egypt the same year. After the tragic death of Khalid Saeed, the two online activists started the Facebook page "We Are All Khaled Saeed".

==Involvement in the Egyptian Revolution of 2011==
In 2010, Abdelrahman and Wael Ghonim founded the Facebook page, "We Are All Khaled Saeed," to commemorate the death of Khaled Saeed, a young Egyptian who was tortured to death by police in Alexandria in the same year. They utilized the page, with up to 3,000,000 followers, to mobilize for anti-government and anti-torture protests on 25 January. On 14 January, Abdelrahman conducted a survey on the page to test the waters, asking members if they would follow in the footsteps of Tunisians and take to the streets on 25 January. Enough enthusiasm poured prompting him and Wael to generate an online event entitled: 25 يناير ثورة على التعذيب والفساد والظلم والبطالة (January 25: Revolution against Torture, Corruption, Unemployment and Injustice). This first call to protests was soon picked up by many other activists. Both Abdelrahman and Wael collaborated anonymously with other activists on-the-ground to plan the locations for the protests.

The page was also influential in organizing innovative activities such as the Silent Stands and the Police Communication Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/110524/20110209/wael-ghonim-google-marketing-executive-egypt-protests-detained-released-face-protestors-facebook-twi.htm |title=Google man Wael Ghonim emerges as the face of Egypt protests - International Business Times |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2011-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anarchitext.wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anarchitext.wordpress.com/2011/03/27/wael-ghonim/ |title=Wael Ghonim " AnarchitexT |publisher=Anarchitext.wordpress.com |date=2011-03-27 |accessdate=2011-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the Arab Spring uprising in Egypt, Abdelrahman criticized the country's Islamists for their misrule; mainly "marginalizing other political forces" and sidelining youth groups.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-arabs-uprisings-idUSBRE91D0S620130214&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticized young activists, or revolutionaries, for their lack of political engagement and failing to develop a political platform that builds on their protest demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/sara-khorshid/the-egyptian-revolutionar_b_6684882.html|title=The Egyptian Revolutionaries: What Went Wrong|last=Khorshid|first=Sara|date=2015-02-17|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alan Hodge''' (16 October 1915 – 25 May 1979) was an English historian and journalist.  He was a member of the circle of writers and artists that centred around [[Laura Riding]] and [[Robert Graves]] in the late 1930s, and later collaborated with Graves on ''[[The Long Week-End]]'', a social history of Britain between the wars, and ''The Reader Over Your Shoulder'', a guide to writing English prose.  After the Second World War he worked as the general editor of [[Hamish Hamilton]]'s Novel Library, as an editorial assistant on [[Winston Churchill]]'s ''[[A History of the English-Speaking Peoples|History of the English-Speaking Peoples]]'', and as a founding co-editor (with [[Peter Quennell]]) of the successful magazine ''[[History Today]]''.

== Parentage and education ==

Alan Hodge was born on 16 October 1915 in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], Yorkshire; his father was T. S. Hodge, a [[Cunard Line]] captain and officer in the [[Royal Naval Reserve]].  He grew up in [[Liverpool]] and attended [[Liverpool Collegiate School]] before going up to [[Oriel College, Oxford]] where he read history.{{sfn|Anonymous|1981|p=373}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watt |first1=Homer Andrew |last2=Cargill |first2=Andrew |year=1948 |title=College Reader |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ILUVAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Born+in+Scarborough,+on+the+Yorkshire+coast+of%22&amp;dq=%22Born+in+Scarborough,+on+the+Yorkshire+coast+of%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIq5GXq-zYAhWCI1AKHU5KDh8Q6AEIKTAA |location=New York |publisher=Prentice-Hall |page=929 |access-date=12 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Quennell|1980|p=157}}  In his spare time he wrote poetry and, with [[Kenneth Allott]], co-edited the Oxford University English Club's magazine, ''Programme''.{{sfn|Anonymous|1979}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://copac.jisc.ac.uk/id/42221030?style=html&amp;title=Programme.No.%2013%20(February%205%2C%201936) |title=Catalogue entry |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=n.d. |website=Copac |access-date=12 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://copac.jisc.ac.uk/id/42508424?style=html&amp;title=Programme.No.%2016%20(May%206%2C%201936) |title=Catalogue entry |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=n.d. |website=Copac |access-date=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Riding-Graves circle ==

In 1935 Hodge, then in his second year at Oriel, wrote a review of the first volume of ''Epilogue'', an irregular critical journal, which led to a correspondence with its editor, the American poet [[Laura Riding]].  Riding invited Hodge to visit her at the house in [[Majorca]] she shared with [[Robert Graves]], and Hodge duly turned up in time for Christmas.{{sfn|Baker|1993|p=331}}{{sfn|Seymour-Smith|1982|p=260}}  He made an excellent impression; Graves noted in his diary, "Hodge very decent &amp; sensible", and described him as "young, blonde good head".{{sfn|Seymour-Smith|1982|pp=260–261}}  Another description of his appearance a year or so later described him as "a small blond boy with a cherubic soprano's face, an incongruously deep and hollow voice, and a deliberate, sententious manner; he seemed about sixteen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Matthews |first1=T. S. |year=1979 |orig-year=1977 |title=Under the Influence |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7yQrAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22incongruously+deep+and%22&amp;dq=%22incongruously+deep+and%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJssOb-aDZAhUP3qQKHfTQDlc4ChDoAQg6MAM |location=London |publisher=Cassell |pages=153–154 |isbn=0304304085 |access-date=12 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hodge went home in early January 1936, but returned the following July to spend the summer holidays there.  He was kept busy helping with a planned series of schoolbooks, contributing to ''Epilogue'', and writing poems.{{sfn|Seymour-Smith|1982|p=261}}{{sfn|Seymour|1996|p=239}}{{sfn|Graves|1990|p=270}}  During July the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out, and on 2 August, acting on official advice, the entire household left Majorca aboard a British destroyer.{{sfn|Seymour-Smith|1982|pp=263–264}}  Hodge settled in London with his new girlfriend Beryl Pritchard, a [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics|PPE]] student he had met at Oxford, but remained a part of the circle of writers and artists dominated by Laura Riding.{{sfn|Baker|1993|p=368}}{{sfn|Seymour|1996|p=258}}  Before long he decided to return to Spain to work for the beleaguered [[Second Spanish Republic|Socialist government]], despite himself being a lifelong Conservative, but Riding told him he must stay in England.  Hodge, who was becoming her closest disciple, acquiesced.{{sfn|Baker|1993|p=369}}{{sfn|Graves|1990|p=275}}{{sfn|Seymour-Smith|1992|p=313}}  At this time he was working on a novel called ''A Year of Damage'', based on his experiences with a former girlfriend, [[Audrey Beecham]], and by the spring of 1937 it was completed.  Graves and Riding supervised its progress closely and made many suggestions for its improvement, all of which he adopted, but though both of them loved the finished book Hodge wouldn't publish it, and destroyed the manuscript.{{sfn|Seymour-Smith|1992|pp=277, 287}}{{sfn|Seymour|1996|p=254}}  In the second half of 1937 he used his skills as a historical researcher to help Graves with the writing of ''[[Count Belisarius]]'', a novel set in the [[Byzantine Empire under the Justinian dynasty|early Byzantine Empire]];{{sfn|Graves|1991|p=281}} and at about the same time they worked on a historical survey of the influence of politics on literature, eventually published in Harry Kemp &lt;!-- Not [[Harry Kemp]] --&gt; and Laura Riding's book ''The Left Heresy in Literature and Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=News and Notes |work=The Times Literary Supplement |location=London |date=24 December 1938 |page=809 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These were only the first results of a fruitful partnership between the two friends.

== First marriage ==

On 29 January 1938 Hodge and Beryl Pritchard were married.  Beryl had previously doubted it was a good idea, but Hodge won her round; Beryl's parents were less amenable, her father being rude to Hodge at the wedding, and her mother telling her she was throwing her life away.{{sfn|Baker|1993|pp=368-369}}{{sfn|Seymour-Smith|1992|p=302}}  In June Riding, Graves, the Hodges and two more of the coterie travelled to [[Rennes]] in [[Brittany]] and found a large country house, which they rented and moved into.{{sfn|Seymour|1996|pp=261–262}}  A year later the entire party took ship for America, where an old friend of Graves, the journalist [[T. S. Matthews|Tom Matthews]], had engaged to find them a home.  The atmosphere in the new community became increasingly claustrophobic and nightmarish as Riding's domination grew more oppressive, and in a few months the group broke up.  Hodge, utterly disillusioned with Riding, returned to England with Graves in August, Beryl being expected to follow shortly after.  By now the dynamic of the Hodge marriage had completely changed, both coming to suspect that theirs was more a friendship than a romance, while Beryl and Graves had gradually fallen in love with each other.{{sfn|Graves|1991|pp=300–323}}{{sfn|Seymour-Smith|1992|pp=340–341}}  On arriving in England Hodge immediately set out on a journalistic assignment to Poland, and was in Warsaw when the German army invaded the country.  He managed to return to England by a circuitous journey via Estonia, Finland, Sweden and Norway.{{sfn|Graves|1998|p=6}}{{sfn|Seymour|1996|pp=275–276}}  Beryl reached England from America in October and moved in with Graves, a situation which Hodge, after some initial resistance, accepted without ill-feeling.  Beryl remained with Graves for the rest of his life, while Hodge kept his close friendship with both.{{sfn|Graves|1991|p=324}}

== Collaborations with Robert Graves ==

Hodge now resumed his literary partnership with Graves, beginning with some historical research on the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] for Graves's [[Sergeant Lamb novels]].{{sfn|Graves|p=324}}  The next project, ''[[The Long Week-End]]'', was intended as "a reliable record of what took place, of a forgettable sort, during the twenty-one-year interval between the [[World war|two great European wars]]", for which Hodge did research work and wrote first drafts of several of the chapters.  The evidence was mainly drawn from [[ephemera]]l sources, such as newspapers, magazines and radio broadcasts, and the book depicted British life in this period as being mainly devoted to frivolities and distractions.{{sfn|Donoghue|1989|p=25}}{{sfn|Seymour|1996|p=285}}  ''The Long Week-End'' was completed in June 1940 and published the following November by [[Faber and Faber]], with Graves and Hodge being credited as co-authors.  There have been many subsequent editions in Britain and the United States, it has been translated into Danish and Swedish and even published in [[Braille]].{{sfn|Graves||1990|p=295}}{{sfn|Higginson|1966|pp=85–86, 278}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://copac.jisc.ac.uk/search?&amp;author=alan+hodge&amp;title=long |title=Catalogue search |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=n.d. |website=Copac |access-date=12 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On its first publication the reaction of academe was mixed.  One historian detected the malign influence of the [[Mass-Observation]] movement in the authors' approach, and called it "a strange unfocused photograph of the times, in which, although the 'camera-eye' has not lied, it has failed entirely to introduce any perspective or integration",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=William D. |date=December 1941 |title=Review of ''The Long Week-End'' |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/236582 |journal=The Journal of Modern History |volume=13 |issue=4 |page=563 |access-date=12 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the sociologist [[Alfred McClung Lee]] thought it "regrettable that so few books do so well the useful task Graves and Hodge assigned themselves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=Alfred McClung |date=December 1941 |title=Review of ''The Long Week-End'' |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=6 |issue=6 |page=923 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Press reviews had some very enthusiastic things to say: "thoroughly good reading",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/robert-graves2/the-long-week-end/ |title=Review of ''The Long Week-End'' |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=15 June 1941 |website=Kirkus Reviews |publisher=Kirkus Media |access-date=12 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "swift, ironic, entertaining...fair and penetrating and a thoroughly significant book today",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Burt |first=Ruth |date=3 July 1941 |title=Books in Review |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SN19410703.2.27 |work=Sausalito News |access-date=12 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "it could hardly have been better done".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=P.

By August 1940{{sfn|Seymour|1996|p=299}} the two were working together on what Graves called a "new book about English prose...for the general reader, and also for intelligent colleges and [[Sixth form|VI-forms]]".{{sfn|Graves|1998|pp=19–20}}  Originally intended to help Graves's daughter Jenny Nicholson, it was eventually published as ''The Reader Over Your Shoulder: A Handbook for Writers of English Prose''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graves |first1=William |year=2001 |title=Wild Olives |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3nQS0Hd2EnsC&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=%22wrote+for+my+half-sister%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5nLnztKXZAhXIY1AKHSRbBTgQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22wrote%20for%20my%20half-sister%22&amp;f=false |location=London |publisher=Pimlico |page=viii |isbn=0712601163 |access-date=14 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its plan, which owes something to Riding's 1938 work ''The World and Ourselves'', is as follows:{{sfn|Seymour|1996|p=299}} first come chapters entitled "The Peculiar Qualities of English", "The Present Confusion of English Prose", "Where Is Good English to Be Found?", and "The Use and Abuse of Official English"; then a history of English prose, quoting many examples; then chapters on "The Principles of Clear Statement" and "The Graces of Prose"; finally, taking up the greater part of the book, the authors present under the title "Examinations and Fair Copies" fifty-four stylistically aberrant passages by well-known writers, analyze their faults, and rewrite them in better English.  This last section, according to the academic [[Denis Donoghue (academic)|Denis Donoghue]], "accounted for much of the fame and nearly all of the delight that the book has given its readers".{{sfn|Donoghue|1989|p=27}}  Getting copyright waivers from each of the 54 writers made demands on the co-authors' time, and since this section was, in Graves's words, "dynamite under so many chairs", also on their diplomacy.{{sfn|Graves|1998|pp=42, 45}}  Their private nickname for the book was ''A Short Cut to Unpopularity''.{{sfn|Graves|1990|p=296}}  The publishers Faber and Faber initially accepted the book while it was still in progress, but later took fright and dropped it;{{sfn|Graves|1998|pp=24, 36}} it was finally published in May 1943 by [[Jonathan Cape]].  There have been several later editions, some at full length and some drastically abridged.{{sfn|Higginson|1966|pp=92–95}}{{sfn|Donoghue|1989|p=28}}  [[G. W.

For this reason the book is just as important as [[I. A. Richards]]' ''Practical Criticism''".  He went on, "there is no point in being scandalized by the assumption in ''The Reader Over Your Shoulder'' that good English is the sort of English written by Graves and Hodge.  In my opinion, that claim is justified."{{sfn|Donoghue|1989|pp=27–30}}

By 1941 another project was in the offing alongside ''The Reader Over Your Shoulder''.  This was intended as a volume of new poems by Hodge, Graves, [[James Reeves (writer)|James Reeves]], [[Norman Cameron (poet)|Norman Cameron]] and Harry Kemp &lt;!-- Not [[Harry Kemp]] --&gt; , all of whom were veterans of the Laura Riding circle.{{sfn|Graves|1998|p=25}}  In the event the publisher, [[Hogarth Press]], rejected Reeves and Kemp from this line-up, so when the book appeared in March 1942 it included 17 poems by Hodge alongside contributions by Graves and Cameron, "published under a single cover for economy and friendship", as the Authors' Note says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graves |first1=Robert |year=1997 |editor1-last=Graves |editor1-first=Beryl |editor2-last=Ward |editor2-first=Dunstan |title=Complete Poems.

One more book was to have been a collaboration between Graves and Hodge.  This was eventually published under Graves's name alone as ''[[The White Goddess|The White Goddess: A Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth]]''.  Hodge retired from the project at a fairly early stage, in 1943, as it became clear that this would be a very personal view of the nature of poetic inspiration and would go beyond his own areas of expertise.  Of the central thesis of the book Hodge wrote, "I think it is a good myth, that is, it has truth, and it is not necessary to ask whether it is entirely factually true".{{sfn|Graves|1998|pp=70, 7374}}  They would not produce another book together again, and Graves began to recede from the foreground of Hodge's life.

According to Hodge's later description of his role as Bracken's literary catalyst he would be "asked to produce a list of targets for attack. Invariably these were shot down by Bracken in withering terms. This was part of a process of warming up by which he got into his stride".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1990 |editor1-last=Cockett |editor1-first=Richard |editor1-link=Richard Cockett |title=My Dear Max: The Letters of Brendan Bracken to Lord Beaverbrook, 1925–1958 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fXiuAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Bracken+in+withering%22&amp;dq=%22Bracken+in+withering%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifoe-167nZAhVDYVAKHW3DAc0Q6AEIKTAA |location=London |publisher=Historians' Press |page=16 |isbn=095089009X |access-date=14 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not everyone reacted well to this kind of treatment – his civil servants cheered when he departed in 1945, and he is rumoured to have been in some respects the model for [[George Orwell|Orwell]]'s [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]{{sfn|Cavendish|2011|p=12}} – but the relationship with Hodge was different, Bracken having a genuine fondness for him as well as a respect for his scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Quennell |first1=Peter |year=1982 |title=Customs and Characters |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7FAfAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Brendan+was+fond+of+Alan%22&amp;dq=%22Brendan+was+fond+of+Alan%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjG65Xs67nZAhVBKlAKHRV7AckQ6AEIKTAA |location=London |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |page=156 |isbn=0297780603 |access-date=22 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life as a working historian ==

The last 28 years of Hodge's life were dominated by his work on the magazine ''[[History Today]]''.  This was the creation of Brendan Bracken, Hodge's old boss and from 1945 Chairman of the Financial News group which owned the ''Financial Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.winstonchurchill.org/publications/finest-hour/finest-hour-113/brendan-bracken-the-fantasist-whose-dreams-came-true/ |title=Brendan Bracken: The Fantasist Whose Dreams Came True |last=Lysaght |first=Charles Edward |date=2001 |website=winstonchurchill.org |publisher=The International Churchill Society |access-date=16 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of his projects was the creation of a monthly history magazine to be edited by Hodge, but when in 1950 he decided to act on this plan he brought in the literary biographer [[Peter Quennell]] as well, making the two men co-editors.{{sfn|Quennell|1980|p=157}}  Paper-rationing delayed the magazine's launch, but on 12 January 1951 the first issue appeared.  ''History Today'' (the title was allegedly suggested by [[Winston Churchill]]) was attractively illustrated and aimed itself at the general reader without writing down to him.  The intention, as [[A. L. Rowse]] later wrote, was to "bridge the gap between specialist journals, all too often unreadable by the general public, and the intelligent reader who wanted to read history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rowse |first1=A.

While editing the magazine Hodge took up a prolonged side-activity, the editing of Winston Churchill's ''[[A History of the English-Speaking Peoples|History of the English-Speaking Peoples]]''.  Churchill had begun to work on this massive work during his "wilderness years", in 1932, and it was in [[Galley proof|proof]] by the time he re-entered the Cabinet in September 1939, at which point he had to lay it aside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jenkins |first1=Roy |author-link1=Roy Jenkins |year=2002 |orig-year=2001 |title=Churchill |location=London |publisher=Pan |pages=448, 546–547 |isbn=0330488058 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1953, once again Prime Minister, he returned to the ''History'', uncertain whether it was in a publishable state.  His close friend Bracken advised him to take on Hodge as an editorial assistant, the introductions were made, and Hodge soon found himself leading a team of historians advising Churchill on necessary revisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clarke |first1=Peter |author-link1=Peter Clarke (historian) |year=2013 |orig-year=2012 |title=Mr Churchill's Profession |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xoukhTh_wQgC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;dq=%22Hodge+might+be+able%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjonbyf-63ZAhVRY1AKHY_qD6EQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Hodge%20might%20be%20able%22&amp;f=false |location=London |publisher=Bloomsbury |page=281 |isbn=9781408831236 |access-date=17 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gilbert|1988|p=877}}  His brief was to produce "a lively, continuous narrative" emphasizing "famous dramatic events",{{sfn|Gilbert|1988|p=591}} but getting major changes made in the text proved very difficult.  "Errors of fact were changed with courteous alacrity," according to the historian [[John H. Plumb]]; "subject to strong pressure, an adjective might or might not be pruned, but the grand design proved immutable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Plumb |first1=J. H. |year=1988 |title=The Making of an Historian |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YA8iAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22changed+with+courteous+alacrity%22&amp;dq=%22changed+with+courteous+alacrity%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj49fXU0K_ZAhXGZ1AKHWC8B58Q6AEIKTAA |location=Brighton |publisher=Harvester, Wheatsheaf |page=240 |isbn=0710812531 |access-date=18 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hodge worked in various places: at home, at the ''History Today'' offices, at [[Chartwell]] (Churchill's home in [[Kent]]), and in the south of France where Churchill spent lengthy holidays.  They developed a close friendship, but the work came to an end at last in 1957.{{sfn|Gilbert|1988|pp=1136, 1148, 1163, 1189, 1228–1230}}

One project suffered from Hodge's heavy workload in these years. When his old friend Norman Cameron died from a stroke in 1953 leaving Hodge his copyrights, Hodge agreed to prepare an edition of his poems with an introduction by Robert Graves. This edition hung fire for a long time, to Graves's increasing anger, but the ''Collected Poems'' finally appeared in June 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graves |first1=Robert |year=1990 |editor1-last=O'Prey |editor1-first=Paul |title=Between Moon and Moon |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BrnyAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Hodge+had+undertaken+to+prepare%22&amp;dq=%22Hodge+had+undertaken+to+prepare%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjb0fSQ06_ZAhUIJlAKHW0_AYoQ6AEIKTAA |location=Mount Kisco |publisher=Moyer Bell |pages=145, 307 |isbn=1559210311 |accessdate=18 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Graves|1998|pp=221–222}}

The same year, having resigned as Prime Minister amid heavy press criticism of the [[Suez Crisis]], [[Anthony Eden]] decided to write his memoirs as a way of giving his side of the story.  He recruited a team of historians to assist him, and Bracken once more stepped forward to recommend Hodge for his "grace of style and nicety of perspective".  Hodge joined the team, and was kept occupied through to 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moran |first1=Christopher |year=2013 |title=Classified: Secrecy and the State in Modern Britain |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=p24kPDwzXkUC&amp;pg=PA220&amp;dq=%22assembled+a+stellar+research%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjX_O2S1a_ZAhULalAKHX2ZA54Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22assembled%20a%20stellar%20research%22&amp;f=false |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=220 |isbn=9781107000995 |access-date=18 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=James |first1=Robert Rhodes |author-link1=Robert Rhodes James |year=1986 |title=Anthony Eden |location=London |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |page=604 |isbn=0297789899 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1971 |editor1-last=Yates |editor1-first=John V. |title=The Author's and Writer's Who's Who |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vSUNAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22to+sir+anthony+eden+1957+59%22&amp;dq=%22to+sir+anthony+eden+1957+59%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3rNWS-uvYAhULmbQKHVSeDlwQ6AEIKTAA |edition=6th |location=London |publisher=Burke's Peerage |page=390 |isbn=0850110106 |access-date=18 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 Brendan Bracken died, and Hodge was commissioned to write his biography.  He researched his subject diligently,{{sfn|Lysaght|1979|p=15}}{{sfn|PHS|1973}} but found himself hampered by the fact that Bracken had ordered his private papers to be burned after his death and also by a sense of loyalty to his old boss which would not have allowed him to publish everything he found.{{sfn|Lysaght|1979|pp=15, 336}}  After several years he abandoned the task and gave his notes to [[Charles Lysaght]] and [[Andrew Boyle]], both of whom were engaged on the same task.{{sfn|PHS|1973}}

In 1960 Hodge and Quennell collaborated on ''The Past We Share: An Illustrated History of the British and American Peoples''.{{sfn|Anonymous|1979}}  Reviews were mixed.  ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' called it "a superb panoramic view of history with a somewhat misleading subtitle, for the emphasis is so largely British that the America aspects take definitely second place", ''[[The New Yorker]]'' "a more than ordinarily serious entry in a frequently trumped-up field",{{sfn|Davison|1962|p=1159}} and ''[[Booklist|The Booklist and Subscription Books Bulletin]]'' "an inviting historical summary for casual reading",;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=1960 |title=Review of ''The Past We Share'' |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3qxTAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22illustrations+are+well+placed.+not%22&amp;dq=%22illustrations+are+well+placed.+not%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiO48Oh6K_ZAhUMZlAKHTg4CZ0Q6AEIMTAC |journal=The Booklist and Subscription Books Bulletin |volume=57 |page=350 |access-date=18 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Times Literary Supplement'' found the illustrations good in themselves but inaccurately captioned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Common Place-Book |work=The Times Literary Supplement |location=London |date=27 January 1961 |page=55 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' thought that "the real past we share with the English was a broader, harsher, more dynamic and far more astonishing saga of conquest than this genteel survey suggests", ''[[The New York Times]]'' that "the luminous histories of our two peoples have not been dovetailed at all (as the title implied they would be) but rather set side by side to languish augustly in isolation from one another", but the ''[[Chicago Tribune|Chicago Sunday Tribune]]'' believed that "this gallery of a pictured past is as rewarding as any the reader is likely to tour for some time".{{sfn|Davison|1962|p=1159}}

Alan Hodge remained until his death the co-editor with Peter Quennell of ''History Today''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carcanet.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?owner_id=863 |title=Alan Hodge (1915–1979) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=n.d. |website=Carcanet Press |access-date=18 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He died at the age of 63 on 25 May 1979.{{sfn|Anonymous|1981|p=373}}

== Personal life ==

In 1942 Hodge opened the way for his first wife, Beryl, to marry Graves by instituting divorce proceedings, and the divorce was made absolute the following year.{{sfn|Seymour|1996|p=287}}{{sfn|Seymour-Smith|1992|p=361}}  In the autumn of 1947 he met [[Jane Aiken Hodge|Jane Aiken]], daughter of the poet and novelist [[Conrad Aiken]], and on 3 January 1948 they married.{{sfn|Graves|1998|pp=147–148}}  He encouraged her to begin her successful career writing Gothic romances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kissandthrill.com/2013/01/22/jane-aiken-hodges-gothic-romances-more-than-just-a-girl-and-her-castle/ |title=Jane Aiken Hodge's Gothic Romances: More than Just a Girl and Her Castle |last=Wray |first=Sharon |date=22 January 2013 |website=Kiss and Thrill |access-date=18 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They lived in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] and later [[Lewes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Radcliffe |first1=Elsa J. |year=1979 |title=Gothic Novels of the Twentieth Century: An Annotated Bibliography |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9Dsx3-Hm7b4C&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=%22husband+Alan+Hodge%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_0df0v7DZAhXQalAKHT7vAV8Q6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22husband%20Alan%20Hodge%22&amp;f=false |location=Metuchen, NJ |publisher=Scarecrow Press |page=101 |isbn=0810811901 |access-date=18 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Forthcoming Marriages |url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/newspaperRetrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=DateAscend&amp;tabID=T003&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchId=R1&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=71&amp;qrySerId=Locale%28en%2C%2C%29%3AFQE%3D%28tx%2CNone%2C12%29%22alan+hodge%22%24&amp;retrieveFormat=MULTIPAGE_DOCUMENT&amp;userGroupName=bright&amp;inPS=true&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;&amp;docId=&amp;docLevel=FASCIMILE&amp;workId=&amp;relevancePageBatch=CS236157561&amp;contentSet=UDVIN&amp;callistoContentSet=UDVIN&amp;docPage=article&amp;hilite=y |work=The Times |location=London |date=25 March 1974 |access-date=22 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and had two daughters, Jessica and Joanna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fallon |first1=Eileen |year=1984 |title=Words of Love: A Complete Guide to Romance Fiction |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kHREAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22January+3,+1948;+children:+Jessica+Mary%22&amp;dq=%22January+3,+1948;+children:+Jessica+Mary%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5rWxU9fxJIPb7AbpxYHgAQ&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AewAA |location=New York |publisher=Garland |page=269 |isbn=9780824092047 |access-date=22 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Jones was born in 1974 in [[Dallas, Texas]], and grew up in the Dallas suburb of [[Rockwall, Texas|Rockwall]] and the city of [[Austin, Texas]]. His father is a dentist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Charlie|last=Warzel|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/alex-jones-will-never-stop-being-alex-jones|title=Alex Jones will never stop being Alex Jones|website=[[Buzzfeed]]|publisher=Buzzfeed Inc.|location=New York|date=May 4, 2017|accessdate=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother a [[Homemaking|homemaker]].&lt;ref name="MeetAJ"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Alexander|last=Zaitchik|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/talk-radios-alex-jones-the-most-paranoid-man-in-america-20110302|title=Meet Alex Jones, the Talk Radio Host Behind Charlie Sheen's Crazy Rants|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher=Wenner Media LLC|location=New York|date=March 2, 2011|accessdate=March 24, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110329052117/http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/talk-radios-alex-jones-the-most-paranoid-man-in-america-20110302|archivedate=March 29, 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his video podcasts, he reports he is of Irish,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGpO5elD3Gs|title = Baltimore City Councilman Pushes Racial Division|date = April 29, 2015|accessdate = April 30, 2015|publisher = YouTube, Google|author = The Alex Jones Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt; German, Welsh, mostly English, and partially Native American descent. He was a lineman on his high school's football team and graduated from [[Anderson High School (Texas)|Anderson High School]] in Austin in 1993.&lt;ref name="MeetAJ"/&gt; As a teenager, he read conservative [[journalist]] and conspiracy theorist [[Gary Allen]]'s [[anti-Semitic]] book ''None Dare Call It Conspiracy'',&lt;ref name="JTABook"&gt;{{cite news |last1=(Staff writer) |title=Congressman Won't Comment on Endorsement of Anti-semitic Book |url=https://www.jta.org/1972/06/16/archive/congressman-wont-comment-on-endorsement-of-anti-semitic-book |accessdate=July 11, 2018 |work=Daily News Bulletin |agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |issue=117 |date=June 16, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had a profound influence on him and which he calls "the easiest-to-read primer on The New World Order".&lt;ref name="RollingStonepage3"&gt;{{cite web|first=Alexander|last=Zaitchek|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/meet-alex-jones-175845/|title=Meet Alex Jones|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Media LLC|location=New York|date=March 2, 2011|accessdate=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After high school, Jones briefly attended [[Austin Community College District|Austin Community College]] but dropped out.&lt;ref name= Stern&gt;Howard Stern Radio Show, February 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Jones began his career in Austin with a live, call-in format [[public-access television|public-access]] [[cable television]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infowars.com/about-alex-jones/|title=About Alex Jones|work=Infowars}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Jones switched format to radio, hosting a show named ''The Final Edition'' on [[KUTX|KJFK]] (98.9 FM).&lt;ref name="KJFK"&gt;{{cite news|first=Lee|last=Nichols|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/column?oid=oid:75039|title=Psst, It's a Conspiracy: KJFK Gives Alex Jones the Boot Media Clips|newspaper=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|publisher=Austin Chronicle Corp.|location=Austin, Texas|date=December 10, 1999|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ron Paul]] was running for Congress and was a guest on his show several times.&lt;ref name="NYMagpage2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/news/media/alex-jones-2011-4/index1.html|title=How Radio Host Alex Jones Has Cornered the Bipartisan Paranoia Market|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|publisher=[[New York Media]]|location=New York City|accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] happened in 1995 Jones began accusing the government of being responsible, saying, "I understood there's a kleptocracy working with psychopathic governments—clutches of evil that know the tricks of control".&lt;ref name="RollingStonep4"/&gt; In 1998, he released his first film, ''America Destroyed By Design''.

In 1998, Jones organized a successful effort to build a new [[Branch Davidians|Branch Davidian]] church, as a memorial to those who died during the 1993 fire that ended the government's [[Waco siege|siege]] of the original Branch Davidian complex near [[Waco, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Connie|last=Mabin |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/branch-davidians-hope-a-new-church-can-close-wounds-719121.html |title=Branch Davidians hope a new church can close wounds |agency=Associated Press |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=Independent Print Ltd.|location=London |date=April 19, 2000 |accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often featured the project on his public-access television program and claimed that [[David Koresh]] and his followers were peaceful people who were murdered by Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms]] during the siege.&lt;ref name="KJFK" /&gt; In the same year, he was removed from a [[George W. Bush]] rally at [[Bayport Industrial District]], Texas. Jones interrupted [[Governor of Texas|governor]] Bush's speech, demanding that the [[Federal Reserve]] and [[Council on Foreign Relations]] be abolished. Journalist [[David Weigel]], reporting on the incident, said Jones "seemed to launch into public events as if flung from another universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David|last=Wiegel|title=Alex Jones celebrates Trump's takeover of the GOP |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/18/alex-jones-celebrates-trumps-takeover-of-the-gop/ |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |publisher=Nash Holdings LLC|location=Washington, DC|date=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Jones tied with [[Shannon Burke Show|Shannon Burke]] for that year's "Best Austin Talk Radio Host" poll, as voted by ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best of Austin 1999 Readers Poll|date=1999|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Awards/BestOfAustin/?BOACategory=Media&amp;Year=1999&amp;Poll=Readers&amp;Display=Long|accessdate=August 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he was fired from KJFK-FM for refusing to broaden his topics. His views were making the show hard to sell to advertisers, according to the station's operations manager.&lt;ref name="KJFK"/&gt; Jones stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;It was purely political, and it came down from on high&amp;nbsp;...

In 2001, his show was syndicated on approximately 100 stations.&lt;ref name="RollingStonep4"/&gt; After the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attack]], Jones began to speak of a conspiracy by the Bush administration as being behind the attack,&lt;ref name="Knight"/&gt; which caused a number of the stations that had previously carried him to drop his program, according to Will Bunch.&lt;ref name="Bunch2011"/&gt;

On June 8, 2006, while on his way to cover a meeting of the [[Bilderberg Group]] in [[Ottawa]], Jones was stopped and detained at the [[Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport|Ottawa airport]] by Canadian authorities who confiscated his passport, camera equipment, and most of his belongings. He was later allowed to enter Canada lawfully. Jones said about the reason for his immigration hold, "I want to say, on the record, it takes two to tango. I could have handled it better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Payton |first=Laura |title=Bilderberg-bound filmmaker held at airport |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |date=June 8, 2006 |url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=f67cbe75-4eed-4daf-877e-189e52d1f33c&amp;k=12919 |accessdate=August 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011102348/http://canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=f67cbe75-4eed-4daf-877e-189e52d1f33c&amp;k=12919 |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8, 2007, he was arrested while protesting at 6th Avenue and 48th Street in [[New York City]]. He was charged with operating a [[megaphone]] without a permit.

On July 21, 2016, following the [[2016 Republican National Convention]], Jones and [[Roger Stone]] began plotting the removal of [[Ted Cruz]] from his Senate seat after he failed to endorse Donald Trump as the Republican presidential candidate, with potential challengers [[Katrina Pierson]] and [[Dan Patrick (politician)|Dan Patrick]] mooted as replacements in the upcoming [[United States Senate election in Texas, 2018|Texas election for Senate]] in 2018.&lt;ref name=plotprimary&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/288719-roger-stone-alex-jones-plot-primary-challenge-to-cruz|title=Roger Stone, Alex Jones plot primary challenge to Cruz|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|last=Easley|first=Jonathan|date=July 21, 2016|accessdate=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 6, 2017, alongside [[Paul Joseph Watson]], Jones began hosting a contest to create the best "CNN Meme", in which the winner would receive $20,000.

=== Sexual harassment and antisemitism claims ===
In February 2018, Jones was accused by two former employees of antisemitism, anti-black racism and sexual harassment of males and females.

==Radio, websites and mail-order business {{anchor|Infowars}}==
''The Alex Jones Show'' is broadcast nationally by the [[Genesis Communications Network]] to more than 90 AM and FM radio stations in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gcnlive.com | title=GCNLive}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[WWCR]], a [[shortwave radio]] station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wwcr.com/pgm-links.html | title=WWCR Programming Schedule}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sunday show also airs on [[KLBJ (AM)|KLBJ]].

According to journalist Will Bunch, a senior fellow at [[Media Matters for America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.commondreams.org/author/will-bunch | title=Will Bunch | publisher=CommonDreams | accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/will-bunch/ | title=Will Bunch | work=The Huffington Post | accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the show has a demographic heavier in younger viewers than other conservative pundits due to Jones's "highly conspiratorial tone and Web-oriented approach". Bunch has also stated that Jones "feed[s] on the deepest paranoia".&lt;ref name="Bunch2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bunch|first=Will|title=The Backlash: Right-Wing Radicals, High-Def Hucksters, and Paranoid Politics in the Age of Obama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4cEAb7Pv-a0C&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=January 10, 2013|date=September 13, 2011|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780061991721|pages=73–}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alexander Zaitchik of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, in 2011 he had a larger on-line audience than [[Glenn Beck]] and [[Rush Limbaugh]] combined.&lt;ref name="RollingStonep4"/&gt;

=== Infowars and other sites ===
[[File:Infowars Logo with Natural Earth Map Background.svg|alt=|thumb|Infowars.com logo]]
{{Main|InfoWars}}
Jones is the publisher and director of the Infowars.com website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.infowars.com/contact/|title=Contact " Alex Jones' Infowars: There's a war on for your mind!|website=www.infowars.com|language=en-US|access-date=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Infowars'' website receives approximately 10 million monthly visits, making its reach more extensive than mainstream news websites such as ''[[The Economist]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quantcast.com/infowars.com?qcLocale=en_US#trafficCard|title=Infowars.com Audience Insights – Quantcast|website=www.quantcast.com|access-date=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/28/13424848/alex-jones-infowars-prisonplanet|title=Alex Jones, Pizzagate booster and America's most famous conspiracy theorist, explained|work=Vox|access-date=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:News Wars Logo.svg|thumb|Newswars logo]]
In August 2017, Jones announced the launch of NewsWars.com, a site Jones said was intended to battle news that he considers to be fake news.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Beth|last=Baumann|url=https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/08/12/infowars-alex-jones-launches-new-website-aimed-at-exposing-fake-news|title=InfoWars' Alex Jones launches new website aimed at exposing 'fake news'|website=[[TheBlaze]]|publisher=[[Mercury Radio Arts]]|location=Irving, Texas|date=August 12, 2017|access-date=February 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones also operates the PrisonPlanet.com website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roig-Franzia|first=Manuel|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/alex-jones-conspiracy-donald-trump-us-election-infowars-prisonplanet-a7429461.html|title=How Alex Jones, conspiracy theorist extraordinaire, got Donald Trump’s ear|work=The Independent|date=November 21, 2016|access-date=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumer products===
A 2017 piece for German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' by Veit Medick indicated that two-thirds of Jones' funds derive from sales of a successful range of his own products. These products are marketed through the ''Infowars'' website and through advertising spots on Jones' show.  They include dietary supplements, toothpaste, bulletproof vests and "brain pills," which hold "an appeal for anyone who believes [[Armageddon]] is near", according to Medick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Veit|last=Medick|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/a-visit-to-the-infowars-studios-of-alex-jones-a-1136654.html|title=Meet Donald Trump's Propagandist|magazine=[[Der Spiegel]]|publisher=Spiegel-Verlag|location=Hamburg, Germany|date=February 28, 2017|accessdate=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, Californian medical company [[Labdoor, Inc]] reported on tests applied to six of Jones' dietary supplement products.  These included a product named Survival Shield, which was found by Labdoor to contain only [[iodine]], and a product named Oxy-Powder, which comprised a compound of magnesium oxide and citric acid; common ingredients in dietary supplements.  Labdoor indicated no evidence of prohibited or harmful substances, but cast doubt on Infowars' marketing claims for these products, and asserted that the quantity of the ingredients in certain products would be "too low to be appropriately effective".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://labdoor.com/article/labdoor-special-report-we-tested-the-infowars-supplements|title=Labdoor Special Report: We Tested the Infowars Supplements|date=August 10, 2017|publisher=Labdoor Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/we-sent-alex-jones-infowars-supplements-to-a-lab-heres|title=We Sent Alex Jones' Infowars Supplements To A Lab.

On a segment of ''[[Last Week Tonight]]'', host [[John Oliver]] stated that Jones spends "nearly a quarter" of his on-air time promoting products sold on his website, many of which are purported solutions to medical and economic problems claimed to be caused by the conspiracy theories described on his show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Locker|first1=Melissa|title=John Oliver Goes to War with Alex Jones on 'Last Week Tonight'|url=http://time.com/4880191/john-oliver-alex-jones-last-week-tonight/|accessdate=August 2, 2017|work=Time|publisher=Time Inc.|date=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Today in Entertainment: Twitter has a field day over Anthony Scaramucci's exit; Celebrities mourn the loss of Sam Shepard|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-john-oliver-mocks-alex-jones-products-1501509845-htmlstory.html|accessdate=August 4, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
Jones has been the center of many controversies.

===School shootings===
Jones has been criticized for propagating conspiracy theories about the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]] in 2012 and the [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting]] in 2018 being false flag operations engineered by gun control advocates.

On June 9, 2013, Jones appeared as a guest on the [[BBC]]'s television show ''[[Daily Politics|Sunday Politics]]'', during a discussion about conspiracy theories surrounding the [[Bilderberg Group]] meetings with presenter [[Andrew Neil]] and journalist [[David Aaronovitch]]. A critic of such theories, Aaronovitch implied that, since Jones had not been killed for exposing conspiracies, they either do not exist or that Jones is a part of them himself.

===Relationship with Donald Trump===

[[File:Andrew Ducrow's monument in Kensal Green Cemetery.JPG|thumb|Andrew Ducrow's monument in Kensal Green Cemetery]]
'''Andrew Ducrow''' (1793–1842) was a British [[circus|circus performer]], often called the "Father of British circus [[equestrianism]]" and "the Colossus of equestrians". He was the originator of horsemanship acts and proprietor of [[Astley's Amphitheatre]] . Ducrow was trained by his father who had immigrated to England from Belgium in 1793. The "Courier of St. Petersburg", his most famous act, was the forerunner to modern horse acts and is still performed today at equestrian events.

Ducrow performed within the United Kingdom and in Europe, including in famous venues such as [[Covent Garden]] and [[Drury Lane]].  He is most famous as the proprietor of Astley’s Amphitheatre, where he was also the chief performer.  Referred to by some as "the Chippendales of his day," Ducrow and his sons would dress in "fleshings" (flesh-coloured body stockings) and would perform physique poses posed as [[plastiques]] while standing upon the rumps of white [[stallions]] which could carry them round the amphitheatre several times.  

[[Pablo Fanque]], the black circus equestrian and later circus owner, best known from his mention in [[The Beatles]] song "[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]]" on the album [[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]], worked in Ducrow's circus for some time.&lt;ref&gt;"The Illustrated London News," March 20, 1847.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ducrow's shows proved immensely popular.  Unfortunately, the Amphitheatre succumbed three times to fire.  After the third time in 1841, Ducrow collapsed from a mental breakdown and died shortly thereafter in 1842.  [[William Batty]] took over management of Astley's Amphitheatre and an employee of Ducrow called Joseph Hillier took over Ducrow's circus company.&lt;ref&gt;The Life and Art of Andrew Ducrow by A.H. Saxon&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ducrow is buried on the Main (or Centre) Avenue at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] in London, England, one of the most desirable burial plots of the time.  His tomb is one of the largest and most decorated tombs within the cemetery.  The decoration is primarily pagan, being drawn from [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Egypt]]ian sources.  There is no [[Christian]]-inspired decoration.  The tomb was designed by Ducrow's theatrical designer and originally was brightly painted in pastel hues to attract the eye.  These have faded over time.

'''Anna "Kakurukaze" Mungunda''' (1932–10 December 1959) was a Namibian woman of [[Herero people|Herero]] descent. She was the only woman among the casualties of the [[Old Location]] uprising in [[Windhoek]] on 10 December 1959. Since Namibia's independence on 21 March 1990 Mungunda is regarded one of the heroes of the Namibian nation.&lt;ref name=Heroes&gt;{{cite web

Anna Mungunda is one of nine national heroes of Namibia that were identified at the inauguration of the country's [[Heroes' Acre (Namibia)|Heroes' Acre]] near Windhoek. Founding president [[Sam Nujoma]] remarked in his inauguration speech on 26 August 2002 that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
On that fateful day [of the Old Location uprising], twelve peaceful demonstrators were killed and more than fifty others were injured. In the face of this brutality, a courageous and fearless young woman by the name of Kakurukaze Mungunda demonstrated her bravery and heroism by setting alight the car of De Wet who was the superintendent of the Windhoek Old Location. She was shot on the spot and Killed in cold blood by the South African apartheid repressive police. To her revolutionary spirit and his visionary memory we humbly offer our honour and respect.&lt;ref name=Nujoma&gt;{{cite web

Reverend Canon '''Arthur Townshend Boscawen''' (9 July 1862 – 17 July 1939) was from 1893 the Rector of [[Ludgvan]], Cornwall, UK, and a recreational and commercial [[horticulture|horticulturist]] who introduced the ''[[Anemone]]'' as a commercial crop to Cornwall.

==Family==
Arthur Townshend Boscawen was born in [[Hanover Square, Westminster|Hanover Square]], London, the ninth of twelve children of the Rev Hon John Townshend Boscawen (1820–1889) and Mary Tremayne (died 25 November 1895), the daughter of [[John Hearle Tremayne]] [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] for [[Cornwall (UK Parliament constituency)|Cornwall]] and owner of the [[Heligan estate]], near [[Mevagissey]].&lt;ref name="Rev. Hon. John Townshend Boscawen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lundy|first1=Darryl|title=Rev. Hon. John Townshend Boscawen|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p8092.htm#i80920|website=The Peerage|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was the Rector of [[Lamorran]], a keen gardener of (it was said) one of the finest gardens in Cornwall. His uncle was [[Evelyn Boscawen, 6th Viscount Falmouth]] who was developing the garden on his estate at [[Tregothnan]].&lt;ref name=hort&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fordham|first1=Ray|title=Canon Boscawen of Ludgvan and his Contributions to Horticulture.

Boscawen married at [[St Andrew's Church, Plymouth]], on 2 September 1902, Christian Anna E Chapell-Hodge (1866– 13 November 1940), eldest daughter of Mr and Mrs Chapell-Hodge of Plymouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Marriages |day_of_week=Saturday |date=13 September 1902 |page_number=1 |issue=36872| }}&lt;/ref&gt; They had two daughters:&lt;ref name="atb"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lundy|first1=Darryl|title=Rev. Canon Arthur Townshend Boscawen|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p31605.htm#i316041|website=The Peerage|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Violet Mary Boscawen (12 June 1903 – 7 January 1998)
# Karenza Margaret Boscawen (11 November 1904 – 22 April 1977) – a cultivar of the [[daffodil]], 'Karenza' was named for her.&lt;ref name=hort/&gt;

==Career==
He initially considered the army for a career but opted for the church, and following a short period working in the [[Diocese of Bristol]] he was based at [[Buckland Monachorum]], Devon for five years before moving to Ludgvan in 1893. In 1917 Boscawen had the rank of Temporary Chaplain to the Forces, of the 1st Battalion, [[Cornwall Volunteers Regiment]].&lt;ref name="wikitree"/&gt; In 1933 he was appointed [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Truro Cathedral]] and was also a [[Magistrate (England and Wales)|Justice of the Peace]].&lt;ref name=hort/&gt;

===Gardening===
The garden of the Rectory, in Ludgvan, was first laid out by [[William Borlase]] when he was the rector in 1722. He planned to grow exotic species sent to him by his uncle who was a captain in the service of the [[East India Company]] in [[Bengal]], India. Boscawen had similar plans and was sent trees and shrubs from [[New Zealand]]. Material for the garden was provided by some of New Zealand's [[botanist]]s, including [[Thomas Frederic Cheeseman|Thomas Cheeseman]], and by his eldest brother, John Hugh Boscawen who was employed by the [[New Zealand Forest Service]]. There was also a network between local gardens and gardeners with the transfer of plants and seeds. These included [[Arthur Algernon Dorrien-Smith|Arthur Dorrien-Smith's]] [[Tresco Abbey Gardens|garden]] at [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]], [[Morrab Gardens]] and [[Penlee House|Penlee Park]] in Penzance and Eagles Nest, [[Zennor]]. Little of the original garden survives, the three winters of 1938, 1939 and 1940 were severe and many of the more tender trees and shrubs were killed, although some of the planting remains including the palms (''[[Trachycarpus fortunei]]''), the tallest measuring {{convert|10|m}} tall. Boscawen did not leave a list of his plantings but research by Anne Boscawen shows that there were 290 acquisitions of plants.&lt;ref name=hort/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boscawen|first1=Anne|title=Ludgvan Rectory|journal=The Cornish Garden|year=1981|issue=24|pages=28–29 &amp; 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boscawen also introduced many new plants to the botanical garden at [[Tregothnan#Gardens|Tregothnan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cornwall's largest private botanical gardens|url=https://tregothnan.co.uk/trading-shed/botanical-garden/|website=Tregothnan|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Horticulture==
Boscawen spent much of his time on the propagation of shrubs from cuttings and seeds. In 1912 he was awarded a Gold Medal and The Gardeners' Chronicle Cup for New Plants for varieties of New Zealand manukas' ([[Leptospermum scoparium|''Leptospermum scoparium'' var Nichollsii]]). A variety of daffodil was named, ″Karenza (Cornish for love) was named after his second daughter and a second variety was named ″Ludgvan″. Both varieties appear to be no longer available. It is thought that Boscawen collected seeds of ''Anemome'' while on holiday in the Mediterranean and in 1925 gave {{convert|2|oz}} of white, woolly seeds to the nearby [[Gulval Experimental Station]]. The first commercial crop was despatched to [[Covent Garden]] which filled a gap in the farming year between [[broccoli|cauliflower]] and [[Narcissus (plant)|''narcissi'']]. Cauliflower is known as broccoli in Cornwall and he helped local production by introducing seed from [[Bavaria]], to improve the local varieties.&lt;ref name=hort/&gt;

He was awarded the [[Victoria Medal of Honour]] in 1922 by the [[Royal Horticultural Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fordham|first1=Ray|title=Canon Boscawen of Ludgvan and his Contributions to Horticulture. '''In''' Ludgvan; A Century of Horticulture 1903–2003|date=2003|publisher=Ludgvan Horticultural Society|location=Ludgvan|pages=17–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Arthur Townsend Boscawen died 17 July 1939 at the Rectory and is buried at the Church of St Paul, Ludgvan. There is a monument to him inside the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Townshend Boscawen grave monument|url=http://www.gravestonephotos.com/public/gravedetails.php?grave=110086&amp;scrwidth=|website=Gravestone Photographic Resource|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://books.google.com/books?id=hP7jJAkTd9MC&amp;pg=PA30 ''An encyclopedic dictionary of conflict and conflict resolution, 1945–1996''].&lt;/ref&gt; (November 27, 1932 – August 21, 1983) was the a Filipino politician who served as a [[Senator of the Philippines]] (1967–1972) and governor of the province of [[Tarlac]]. He was the husband of former [[Philippines|Philippine]] [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]] and father of former Philippine President [[Benigno Aquino III]]. Aquino, together with [[Gerardo Roxas]] and [[Jovito Salonga]], formed the leadership of the opposition towards then President [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. Shortly after the imposition of [[Martial law in the Philippines|martial law]], he was arrested in 1972 along with others associated with the [[New People's Army|Communists]]' armed insurgency and incarcerated for seven years. He founded his own party, [[Lakas ng Bayan]], and ran in the [[Philippine parliamentary election, 1978|1978 Philippine parliamentary election]], but all of the party's candidates, including Aquino, lost in the election. In 1980, Aquino was permitted by Marcos to travel to the [[United States]] for medical treatment following a heart attack. He was [[Assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr.|assassinated at the Manila International Airport]] in 1983 upon returning from his self-imposed exile. His death catapulted his widow, Corazon, into the political limelight, and prompted her to run for president as member of the [[United Nationalist Democratic Organization|UNIDO]] party in the [[Philippine presidential election, 1986|1986 snap elections]].

Among other public structures, Manila International Airport has since been renamed [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] in his honor, and the [[Ninoy Aquino Day|anniversary of his death]] is a national holiday.

==Early Life ==
Benigno Simeón Aquino Jr. was born in [[Concepcion, Tarlac]], on November 27, 1932, to [[Benigno Aquino Sr.]] and Aurora Lampa Aquino&lt;ref name="noynoyCriticizesKiansDeath"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sadongdong |first1=Martin |title=‘Noynoy’ criticizes Kian’s death at the hands of Caloocan cops |url=https://news.mb.com.ph/2017/08/21/noynoy-criticizes-kians-death-at-the-hands-of-caloocan-cops/ |publisher=[[Manila Bulletin]] |date=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="donaAuroraOnSon"&gt;{{cite web |title=Doña Aurora A.

His grandfather, Aquino, was a general in the revolutionary army of [[Emilio Aguinaldo]], the officially recognized first [[President of the Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Aquinos of Tarlac in the Philippines|url=http://www.muntingnayon.com/page/100717/|work=Munting Nayon|first=Renato|last=Perdon|date=May 17, 2010|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received his elementary education at the basic education department of [[De La Salle University|De La Salle College]] and  finished at the basic education department of [[Saint Joseph's College of Quezon City]]. He then graduated at the high school department of [[San Beda College]]. Aquino took his tertiary education at [[Ateneo de Manila University]] to obtain a Bachelor of Arts degree, but he interrupted his studies.&lt;ref name="mvs"&gt;Soliven, Maximo V. (August 26, 2008). [http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/sb/sb005847.htm "Ninoy: In the Eye of Memory"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323022102/http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/sb/sb005847.htm |date=March 23, 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one of his biographies, he considered himself to be an average student; his grade was not in the line of 90s nor did it fall into the 70s. At age 17, he was the youngest war correspondent to cover the [[Korean War]] for ''[[The Manila Times]]'' of ''[[Don (honorific)|Don]]'' [[Chino Roces|Joaquín "Chino" Roces]]. Because of his journalistic feats, he received the Philippine Legion of Honor award from President Elpidio Quirino at age 18. At 21, he became a close adviser to then [[Department of National Defense (Philippines)|Defense Secretary]] [[Ramon Magsaysay]]. Aquino took up law at the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]], where he became a member of [[Upsilon Sigma Phi]], the same fraternity as [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. He interrupted his studies again however to pursue a career in journalism. According to [[Maximo Soliven|Máximo Soliven]], Aquino "later 'explained' that he had decided to go to as many schools as possible, so that he could make as many new friends as possible."&lt;ref name="mvs"/&gt; In early 1954, he was appointed by President [[Ramon Magsaysay]], his wedding sponsor to his 1953 wedding at the Our Lady of Sorrows Church in [[Pasay]] with Corazon Cojuangco, to act as personal emissary to [[Luis Taruc]], leader of the [[Hukbalahap]] rebel group. After four months of negotiations, he was credited for Taruc's unconditional surrender&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Benigno Simeon 'Ninoy' Aquino Jr.|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/331427/benigno-simeon-ninoy-aquino-jr|newspaper=Manila Bulletin|date=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was given a second Philippine Legion of Honor award with the degree of Commander on October 14, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On October 14, 1954, for successfully bringing Luis Taruc down from the hills, Ninoy Aquino got his second Legion of Honor award|url=http://tumblr.malacanang.gov.ph/post/30023940935/on-october-14-1954-for-successfully-bringing|publisher=Presidential Museum and Library/[[Presidential Communications Group (Philippines)|PCDSPO]]|date=August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became mayor of Concepcion in 1955 at the age of 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senator Benigno 'Ninoy' Aquino Jr. remembered for his heroism and courage on his 79th Birth Anniversary|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/342714/senator-benigno-ninoy-aquino-jr-remembered-his-heroism-and-courage-his-79th-birth-an|newspaper=Manila Bulletin|date=November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
[[File:Ramon Magsaysay and Ninoy Aquino 1951.jpg|thumb|Benigno Aquino Jr. (right) with Ramon Magsaysay in August 1951.]]

Aquino gained an early familiarity with Philippine politics, as he was born into one of the Philippines' political and landholding clans. His grandfather served under President Aguinaldo, and his father held office under Presidents [[Manuel L. Quezon|Quezon]] and [[Jose P. Laurel]]. As a consequence, Aquino was able to be elected mayor when he was 23 years old. Five years later, he was elected the nation's youngest vice-governor at 27 (the record was surpassed by [[Jolo Revilla]] at 25 in [[Cavite local elections, 2013|2013]]). Two years later, he became governor of Tarlac province in 1961 and then secretary-general of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] in 1966. 

In 1968, during his first year as senator, Aquino alleged that Marcos was on the road to establishing "a garrison state" by "ballooning the armed forces budget," saddling the defense establishment with "overstaying generals" and "militarizing our civilian government offices."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Famous Assassinations in World History: An Encyclopedia|first=Michael|last=Newton|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2014|page=18|ISBN=1610692861|accessdate=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Teodoro&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Opinion&amp;title=aquino-vs-marcos-reprised&amp;id=124027|title=Aquino vs Marcos reprised|first=Luist|last=Teodoro|work=Vantage Point|publisher=[[BusinessWorld]]|date=March 4, 2016|accessdate=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquino became known as a constant critic of the Marcos regime, as his flamboyant rhetoric had made him a darling of the media. His most polemical speech, "A Pantheon for Imelda", was delivered on February 10, 1969. He assailed the Cultural Center, the first project of First Lady [[Imelda Marcos]] as extravagant, and dubbed it "a monument to shame" and labelled its designer "a megalomaniac, with a penchant to captivate". By the end of the day, the country's broadsheets had blared that he labelled the President's wife, his cousin Paz's former ward, and a woman he had once courted, "the Philippines' [[Eva Peron]]". President Marcos is said to have been outraged and labelled Aquino "a congenital liar". The First Lady's friends angrily accused Aquino of being "ungallant". These so-called "fiscalization" tactics of Aquino quickly became his trademark in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.spot.ph/arts-culture/46380/remembering-ninoy-aquino-his-life-and-words-|title=Remembering Ninoy Aquino: His Life and Words|publisher=www.spot.ph|date=August 19, 2010|accessdate=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Teodoro/&gt;

==Early martial law years==
It was not until the [[1971 Plaza Miranda bombing|Plaza Miranda bombing]] however on August 21, 1971 that the pattern of direct confrontation between Marcos and Aquino emerged. At 9:15&amp;nbsp;pm, at the kick-off rally of the Liberal Party, the candidates had formed a line on a makeshift platform and were raising their hands as the crowd applauded. The band played, a fireworks display drew all eyes, when suddenly there were two loud explosions that obviously were not part of the show. In an instant the stage became a scene of wild carnage. The police later discovered two fragmentation grenades that had been thrown at the stage by "unknown persons". Eight people died, and 120 others were wounded, many critically.

As Aquino was the only Liberal Party senatorial candidate not present at the incident, many assumed that Aquino's [[New People's Army|NPA]] friends tipped him off in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton-Paterson|first=James|title=America’s Boy: The Marcoses and the Philippines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-L4PBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT278&amp;lpg=PT278&amp;dq=ninoy+tipped+plaza+miranda&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BgW2J_HGDs&amp;sig=IZDSz99YNcCODHLHM0ZsHbFhFFk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ninoy%20tipped%20plaza%20miranda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, some former Communists claimed responsibility and accused Aquino of being involved, but the party leadership has dismissed this as absurd. No one has ever been prosecuted for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/777194/joma-sison-cpp-ninoy-have-no-role-in-plaza-miranda-bombing|title=Joma Sison: CPP, Ninoy have no role in Plaza Miranda bombing|last=Gonzales|first=Yuji Vincent|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most historians continue to suspect Marcos as he is known to have used [[false flag]] attacks as a pretext for his declaration of martial law at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RmMCmvYBQtMC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;lpg=PA280&amp;dq=marcos.+plaza+miranda&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JJ33NUzUIP&amp;sig=3jR4gvAY68EOZ8hqRY5ChgtV4fc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwixis699f3YAhVBT98KHUajC2M4FBDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=marcos.%20plaza%20miranda&amp;f=false|title=International Handbook of Human Rights|last=Donnelly|first=Jack|last2=Howard-Hassmann|first2=Rhoda E.|date=1987|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=|isbn=9780313247880|location=|pages=280–281|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3_0TBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1225&amp;dq=marcos.+plaza+miranda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim5YOk-P3YAhXiQd8KHXZ-CcUQ6AEINzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=marcos.%20plaza%20miranda&amp;f=false|title=World Terrorism: An Encyclopedia of Political Violence from Ancient Times to the Post-9/11 Era: An Encyclopedia of Political Violence from Ancient Times to the Post-9/11 Era|last=Ciment|first=James|date=2015-03-10|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317451518|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcos declared martial law on September 21, 1972 through [[Proclamation № 1081|proclamation 1081]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philippines during martial law|url=http://www.philippine-history.org/martial-law-philippines.htm|publisher=www.philippine-history.org|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and he went on air to broadcast his declaration on midnight of September 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Televised proclamation of martial law by Marcos|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14iz1eZlNuU|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquino was one of the first to be arrested and imprisoned on trumped-up charges of murder, illegal possession of firearms and subversion. He was tried before Military Commission No. 2 headed by Major-General Jose Syjuco.

On April 4, 1975, Aquino announced that he was going on a hunger strike, a fast to the death to protest the injustices of his military trial. Ten days through his hunger strike, he instructed his lawyers to withdraw all motions he had submitted to the Supreme Court. As weeks went by, he subsisted solely on salt tablets, sodium bicarbonate, amino acids, and two glasses of water a day. Even as he grew weaker, suffering from chills and cramps, soldiers forcibly dragged him to the military tribunal's session. His family and hundreds of friends and supporters heard Mass nightly at the Santuario de San Jose in [[Greenhills, San Juan]], praying for his survival. Near the end, Aquino's weight had dropped from 54 to 36 kilos. Aquino nonetheless was able to walk throughout his ordeal. On May 13, 1975, on the 40th day, his family and several priests and friends, begged him to end his fast, pointing out that even Christ fasted only for 40 days. He acquiesced, confident that he had made a symbolic gesture. But he remained in prison, and the trial continued, drawn out for several years. On November 25, 1977, the Military Commission charged Aquino along with [[New People's Army|NPA]] leaders [[Bernabe Buscayno]] (Commander Dante) and Lt. Victor Corpuz, guilty of all charges and sentenced them to death by firing squad.&lt;ref name="asianjournalusa.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Max Soliven recalls Ninoy Aquino: Unbroken|url=http://asianjournalusa.com/max-soliven-recalls-ninoy-aquino-unbroken-p5828-87.htm|accessdate=August 30, 2013|newspaper=Philippines Star|date=October 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death sentence was never carried out as Aquino's death sentence was commuted by President Marcos in May 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=New York Times|title=BENIGNO AQUINO, BITTER FOE OF MARCOS|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/22/obituaries/benigno-aquino-bitter-foe-of-marcos.html|date=August 22, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1978 elections, bypass surgery, exile==
[[File:PH1-06132016 fort-boni GN1.jpg|left|thumb|Room where Aquino was detained from August 1973 to 1980]]
In 1978, from his prison cell, Aquino was allowed to run in the [[Philippine parliamentary election, 1978]]. As Ninoy's liberal party colleagues were boycotting the election, he formed the party ''[[Lakas ng Bayan]]''. The party had 21 candidates for the Metro Manila area, including Ninoy himself. All of the party's candidates, including Ninoy, lost in the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roces|first1=Alejandro|title=Lakas ng Bayan candidates|url=http://www.philstar.com/opinion/354387/lakas-ng-bayan-candidates|website=Philippine Star|date=24 August 2006|quote=The historically unprecedented noise barrage was an attestation they unanimously won that election, but they all lost in the counting.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-March 1980, Aquino suffered a heart attack, mostly in a solitary cell. He was transported to the [[Philippine Heart Center]], where he suffered a second heart attack. [[Electrocardiography|ECG]] and other tests showed that he had a blocked artery. Philippine surgeons were reluctant to do a [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|coronary bypass]], because it could involve them in a controversy. In addition, Aquino refused to submit himself to Philippine doctors, fearing possible Marcos "duplicity"; he preferred to go to the United States for the procedure or return to his cell at Fort Bonifacio and die.

His request was granted and Ninoy was allowed to go to the US for surgery, together with his entire family. This was arranged after a secret hospital visit by Imelda Marcos. This "emergency leave" was set when Ninoy supposedly agreed to the First Lady's 2 conditions: that if he leaves, he will return; and while in America, he should not speak out against the Marcos regime. Ninoy was operated in Dallas, Texas by Rolando M. Solis, a Filipino American, and the longest practicing Cardioligiat in Dallas currently. After the Surgery, Ninoy made a quick recovery. After which, he decided to renounce the agreement saying, "a pact with the devil is no pact at all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Philippine Star|title=Ninoy Aquino: Fight for Freedom|url=http://www.ninoyaquino.ph/exile-begins.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ninoy Aquino 2.jpg|thumb|left|Aquino in 1981, during his interview on [[The 700 Club]]]]
He, Cory and their children started a new life in Massachusetts. He continued to work on two books and gave a series of lectures while on fellowship grants from Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His travels across the US had become opportunities for him to deliver speeches critical of the Marcos government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Philippine Star|title=Important moments in Ninoy Aquino's life|date=August 21, 2014|url=http://www.philstar.com/news-feature/2014/08/21/1360124/important-moments-ninoy-aquinos-life|accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Philippine Star|title=Ninoy Aquino: Fight for Freedom|url=http://www.ninoyaquino.ph/exile-begins.html|accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his years of expatriation, Aquino was always aware that his life in the U.S. was temporary. He never stopped affirming his eventual return even as he enjoyed American hospitality and a peaceful life with his family on American soil. After spending 7 years and 7 months in prison, Aquino's finances were in ruins. Making up for the lost time as the family's breadwinner, he toured America; attending symposiums, lectures, and giving speeches in freedom rallies opposing the Marcos dictatorship. The most memorable was held at the [[Wilshire Ebell Theater]] in Los Angeles, California on February 15, 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHyJYcUIUjg |title=An NATv Exclusive: Ninoy Aquino's memorable speech in Los Angeles! (1 of 9) |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=January 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planning return==

In the first quarter of 1983, Aquino received news about the deteriorating political situation in his country and the rumored declining health of President Marcos (due to [[Lupus erythematosus|lupus]]). He believed that it was expedient for him to speak to Marcos and present to him his rationale for the country's return to democracy, before extremists took over and made such a change impossible. Moreover, his years of absence made his allies worry that the Filipinos might have resigned themselves to Marcos' strongman rule and that without his leadership the centrist opposition would die a natural death.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Aquino decided to go back to the Philippines, fully aware of the dangers that awaited him. Warned that he would either be imprisoned or killed, Aquino answered, "if it's my fate to die by an assassin's bullet, so be it. But I cannot be petrified by inaction, or fear of assassination, and therefore stay in the side..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/21/newsid_2534000/2534945.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &amp;#124; 21 &amp;#124; 1983: Filipino opposition leader shot dead |publisher=BBC News |date=August 21, 1968 |accessdate=December 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family, however, learned from a Philippine Consular official that there were orders from Ministry of Foreign Affairs not to issue any passports for them. At that time, their passports had expired and their renewal had been denied. They therefore formulated a plan for Aquino to fly alone (to attract less attention), with the rest of the family to follow him after two weeks. Despite the government's ban on issuing him a passport, Aquino acquired one with the help of [[Rashid Lucman]], a former [[Mindanao]] legislator and founder of the Bangsamoro Liberation Front, a [[Moro people|Moro]] separatist group against Marcos. It carried the alias ''Marcial Bonifacio'' (Marcial for martial law and Bonifacio for Fort Bonifacio, his erstwhile prison).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inq7.net/nat/2003/aug/21/nat_4-1.htm |title=Services – INQUIRER.net |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516180338/http://www.inq7.net/nat/2003/aug/21/nat_4-1.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually obtained a legitimate passport from a sympathizer working in a Philippine consulate through the help of Roque R. Ablan Jr, then a Congressman. The Marcos government warned all international airlines that they would be denied landing rights and forced to return if they tried to fly Aquino to the Philippines. Aquino insisted that it was his natural right as a citizen to come back to his homeland, and that no government could prevent him from doing so. He left [[Logan International Airport]] on August 13, 1983, took a circuitous route home from Boston, via Los Angeles to [[Singapore]]. In Singapore, then Tunku [[Ibrahim Ismail of Johor]] met Aquino upon his arrival in Singapore and later brought him to [[Johor]] to meet with other Malaysian leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E6DF153BF935A25753C1A965948260&amp;sec=health&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all AQUINO'S FINAL JOURNEY], KEN KASHIWAHARA, October 16, 1983, The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; Once in [[Johor]], Aquino met up with Tunku Ibrahim's father, Sultan [[Iskandar of Johor|Iskandar]], who was a close friend to Aquino.&lt;ref&gt;''Towards Relevant Education: A General Sourcebook for Teachers'' (1986), Education Forum, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

He then left for Hong Kong and on to [[Taipei]]. He had chosen Taipei as the final stopover when he learned the Philippines had severed diplomatic ties with the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan). This made him feel more secure; the Taiwan government could pretend they were not aware of his presence. There would also be a couple of [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] friends accompanying him. From Taipei he flew to Manila on then Taiwan's [[flag carrier]] [[China Airlines]] Flight 811.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Marcos wanted Aquino to stay out of politics, however Aquino asserted his willingness to suffer the consequences declaring, "the Filipino is worth dying for."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Biography/BiographyAquinoCor.htm |title=1998 Ramon Magsaysay Award for International Understanding – Corazon Aquino |publisher=Rmaf.org.ph |accessdate=December 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wished to express an earnest plea for Marcos to step down, for a peaceful regime change and a return to democratic institutions. Anticipating the worst, at an interview in his suite at the [[Taipei Grand Hotel]], he revealed that he would be wearing a [[body armor|bullet-proof vest]], but he also said that "it's only good for the body, but in the head there's nothing else we can do." Sensing his own doom, he told the journalists accompanying him on the flight, "You have to be very ready with your hand camera because this action can become very fast. In a matter of a three or four minutes it could be all over, you know, and [laughing] I may not be able to talk to you again after this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuEPFt-Dd-Q |title=Ninoy Aquino: Worth Dying For (the last interview!)

==Assassination==
[[File:Ninoy's bloodied jacket, belt and boots.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Clothes worn by Aquino upon his return from exile are on permanent display at the Aquino Center in [[Tarlac]].]]
{{Main|Assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr.}}
Aquino was assassinated on August 21, 1983, when he was shot in the head after returning to the country. At the time, bodyguards were assigned to him by the Marcos government. A subsequent investigation produced controversy but with no definitive results. After Marcos' government was overthrown, another investigation found sixteen defendants guilty. They were all sentenced to life in prison. Some were released over the years, the last ones in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/topstories/topstories/view/20090304-192228/10-Aquino-Galman-convicts-free-finally "10 Aquino-Galman convicts free finally"]. ''Philippine Daily Inquirer''. March 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another man present at the airport tarmac, Rolando Galman, was shot dead shortly after Aquino was killed. The Marcos government claimed Galman was the trigger man in Aquino's assassination.

After the assassination, the opposition ran for the [[Regular Batasang Pambansa]] under the [[United Nationalist Democratic Organization]] (UNIDO) and the [[Partido Demokratikong Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan]] (PDP-LABAN) against the ruling [[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan]] of [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. In the wake of the massive outpouring of protest and discontent following the assassination of Ninoy, the opposition performed better during the [[Philippine parliamentary election, 1984]] compared to the [[Philippine parliamentary election, 1978]], winning 61 seats out of 183 seats or 33%. Many Filipinos considered his death as the best thing that happened in the history of the Philippines.

==Funeral==
[[File:Cory aquino wiki.JPG|thumb|Sen. Ninoy Aquino's grave (right) is next to his wife [[Corazon Aquino]]'s (left) at the Manila Memorial Park in [[Parañaque]], Philippines.]]

Aquino's body lay in state in a coffin. No effort was made to disguise a bullet wound that had disfigured his face. In an interview with Aquino's mother, Aurora, she told the funeral parlor not to apply makeup nor [[embalm]] her son, to see "what they did to my son". Thousands of supporters flocked to see the bloodied body of Aquino, which took place at the Aquino household in Times Street, West Triangle, [[Quezon City]], for nine days. Aquino's wife, [[Corazon Aquino]], and children Ballsy, Pinky, Viel, [[Noynoy Aquino|Noynoy]] and [[Kris Aquino|Kris]] arrived the day after the assassination. Aquino's funeral procession on August 31 lasted from 9&amp;nbsp;a.m., when his funeral mass was held at [[Santo Domingo Church]] in [[Santa Mesa|Santa Mesa Heights]], [[Quezon City]], with the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Archbishop of Manila]], [[Jaime Sin]] officiating, to 9&amp;nbsp;p.m., when his body was interred at the [[Manila Memorial Park]]. More than two million people lined the streets during the procession which was aired by the Church-sponsored [[Radio Veritas]], the only station to do so. The procession reached [[Rizal Park]], where the Philippine flag was brought to half-staff.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

[[Jovito Salonga]], then head of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]], referred to Aquino as "the greatest president we never had",&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.fnf.org.ph/online-exhibit/gallery14.html "The Greatest President We Never Had"]. Liberal Party of the Philippines.&lt;/ref&gt; adding:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Ninoy was getting impatient in Boston, he felt isolated by the flow of events in the Philippines. In early 1983, Marcos was seriously ailing, the Philippine economy was just as rapidly declining, and insurgency was becoming a serious problem. Ninoy thought that by coming home he might be able to persuade Marcos to restore democracy and somehow revitalize the Liberal Party.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Historical reputation and legacy==
[[File:Benigno Aquino Jr 2000 stamp of the Philippines.jpg|thumb|Ninoy Aquino on a 2000 stamp of the Philippines]]
[[File:Ninoy Aquino Monument and marker at the Pampanga Provincial Capitol.jpg|thumb|Ninoy Aquino Monument ([[Pampanga Provincial Capitol]]).]]
Although Aquino was recognized as the most prominent and most dynamic politician of his generation, in the years prior to martial law he was regarded by many as being a representative of the entrenched familial elite which to this day dominates Philippine politics. While atypically telegenic and uncommonly articulate, he had his share of detractors and was not known to be immune to ambitions and excesses of the ruling political class. However, during his seven years and seven months imprisoned as a criminal, Aquino read the book ''Born Again'' by convicted [[Watergate]] conspirator [[Charles Colson]] and it inspired him to a rude awakening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__ripZFVtUQ |title=Ninoy Aquino's guest appearance on The 700 Club Part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date=December 23, 2008 |accessdate=December 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the remainder of his personal and political life had a distinct spiritual sheen. He emerged as a contemporary counterpart of [[Jose Rizal]], who was among the most vocal proponents of the use of non-violence to combat a repressive regime at the time, following the model of [[Gandhi]] and [[Martin Luther King]]. Some{{Who|date=July 2018}} remained skeptical of Aquino's redirected spiritual focus and they were right, but it ultimately had an effect on his wife's political ambition. While some may question the prominence given Aquino in Philippine history, it was his assassination that was pivotal to the eventual restoration of constitutional democracy in the Philippines.

=== Monuments and memorials ===
The Manila International Airport (MIA) where he was assassinated was renamed Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) and his image is printed on the [[Philippine five hundred peso bill|500-peso note]]. August 21, the anniversary of his death, is Ninoy Aquino Day, an annual public holiday in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.ph/events-and-holidays|title=Events and Holidays - GOV.PH|website=www.gov.ph|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno9256.htm Republic Act No. 9256]{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several monuments were built because of their demands to be honored. Most renowned is the bronze memorial in [[Makati City]] near the [[Philippine Stock Exchange]], which has become a popular venue for anti-government rallies and large demonstrations{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. Another bronze statue is in front of the Municipal Building of [[Concepcion, Tarlac]].

In a June 1981 interview with [[Pat Robertson]] on ''[[The 700 Club]]'', Aquino said he was raised [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Catholic]]. According to him, his religious awakening began after reading [[Evangelical Christian]] author [[Charles Colson]]'s 1976 book ''Born Again'', during his solitary confinement under the Marcos regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''Bray Wilkins''' ({{circa}} 1610 – 1/2 January 1702) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] immigrant, patriarch, and founder of [[Middleton, Massachusetts]]. Bray's origins aren't concretely known and are supplanted (and probably distorted) by familial tradition, however his reputation was already prolific in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] decades before his death. His progeny, the [[Wilkins (surname)|Wilkins family]], had a strong presence in the area. Bray and his seed were prominent figures in some [[Salem Witch Trials]].

==Early life==
On a broad scale, Bray Wilkins' history is somewhat known. Bray was probably a descendant of Robert de Wintona, one of the men who captured [[Wales]] for the [[Norman people]] alongside [[Robert FitzHamon]] in the mid-11th century. Robert became the lord over [[Llandow]] and  [[Llanblethian]], in the latter of which he built a [[Llanquian Castle|large manor]] which housed his descendants for some years. His great-grandson, Wilkyne de Winton, is the first attestation of what would become the surname 'Wilkins'. Over time, the by-names of Robert's descendants became corrupted, eventually forming surnames such as Wilcolyne, Wilkyn, Wilkin, and ultimately, Wilkins.

That being said, Bray's immediate origins aren't completely known. Family tradition places his birth in [[Glamorganshire]] on 16 October 1610, as the son of Thomas John Willkins and Hannah Nichols. However, there are no (surviving) records supporting these conclusions. It is known from his own admission and other records which required such information that Bray was born in 1610 in Wales. Where in Wales he was born is up for debate, it is sometimes suggested he was born in [[Brecknockshire]] and a descendant of the lord John Wilkins, who married the sister of [[Oliver Cromwell]]. While the Brecknockshire claims are up in the air, Bray was certainly not a descendant of the union of John Wilkins and Robina Cromwell, mainly because John Wilkins was actually born more than four years after Bray.

==Immigration and life in Massachusetts==
Regardless of his origins, Bray arrived in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] around 1630, his first residence being recorded as [[Lynn, Massachusetts]]. He is first mentioned in a parchment dated January 16, 1632 which describes the allotment of 16 acres of [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] to him.  He is registered as have taken the [[Oath of a Freeman]] on May 14, 1634.

Bray was known by the community as a model citizen: upright, pious, and adored. In 1659, Bray and his partner John Gengell (of uncertain relations, see below) leased 700 acres of land eight to ten miles northwest of Salem, which became the town of [[Danvers, Massachusetts|Danvers]], and later Middleton. A controversial mortgage claim lead to Bray and Gengell being brought to court in 1666.

===Salem Witch Trials===
In 1689, Bray and his family, along with several others, moved from Salem proper to establish a church in Danvers. Around 1690, Bray's granddaughter by his son Thomas, Margaret, married a man by the name of [[John Willard]]. Willard acted as a constable for the court, and given Bray's legal misfortunes decades prior, the family disapproved of him immediately after it was announced Margaret and John were eloped. The two lived a rather normal life for several years, all the while the Wilkins family did not shy away from making it known how they disapproved of John. During the first weeks of the [[Salem Witch Trials]] in spring 1692, paranoia and mania swept through Danvers. Willard, being a constable, found he at times was to arrest townspeople he held in high regard. His refusal to arrest accused witches lead to himself being accused of witchcraft, and on May 10 of the same year a warrant for Willard's arrest was ratified. Willard fled to [[Lancaster, Massachusetts|Nashaway]], where he was discovered following the issue of a second warrant for his arrest. Once returned to Danvers, [[Mercy Lewis]], at this time the lover of Henry Wilkins, one of Bray's sons, accused Willard of being responsible for the death of her newborn son Daniel. Willard was put on trial on May 18, during which Bray Wilkins testified that he had been inflicted with a very painful condition after Willard had given him a stare, recounting, "[Willard] lookt after such a sort upon me as I never before discerned in any." Indeed, a kidney stone had begun to afflict Bray after he had encountered Willard in the middle of a meal some days before. Two of Bray's daughters and several others gave second-hand testimony that John Willard had beaten his wife Margaret and then exhibited odd behavior which frightened her into running to a relative's house for safety. During his examination, he denied these allegations with the rest, and desired that his wife would be called to testify on his behalf, but this does not appear to have been done. Indeed, no such frenzy is known to have occurred at any point, Margaret and John shared three children and lived a modest life. Regardless, the testimony of the Wilkins family was damning, and Willard was found guilty and hanged for witchcraft that August.

==Death==
Bray Wilkins died in January 1702. His burial place is not known, though legend places in on the original foundations of Danvers/Middleton that he and Gengell built, today known as "Will's Hill", also where he passed away.

==Marriage and descendants==
The identity of Bray Wilkins' wife isn't known, but there are two candidates: Hannah Way and Hannah Gengell. Hannah Gengell is proposed to have been the sister of Bray's lifelong partner John Gengell. Neither candidate has more evidence favoring their identification over the other, however it is more likely Bray married Hannah Way as opposed to Hannah Gengell. Any mention of Bray's wife simply refers to her as "Hannah" and no mention of her maiden name is ever recorded in the sparse times she is ever mentioned. No record of her death is known to exist. 

Two persons who had access to much early documentary material about the Wilkins family, now lost, Martha J. Averill and Emily Ann Milliken née Wilkins, maintained that Bray's wife was Hannah Gengell, and furthermore the Wilkins are described with familial kindness in John Gengell’s will dated 10 April 1685. However, a 1984 article from [[The American Genealogist]] written by David L. Greene disputes the identification of Bray's wife as a Gengell by claiming the main piece of support, John Gengell's will, makes the conclusion impossible, as Gengell called himself 70 in that document, and thus about 21 when Bray married Hannah (though ''why'' this fact makes it impossible for the wife of Bray Wilkins to be Hannah Gengell is suspiciously unexplained). Though Greene acknowledges that it is difficult to escape the inference that Bray and John Gengell were in some way related, he advances the following arguments: Henry Way arrived at Nantasket in 1630 (meaning he was in New England when Bray was) with his wife Elizabeth and children Samuel, Richard, Henry, and Susanna, suggesting the seemingly missing entry for his son Aaron Way may indicate that other children may very well have gone undocumented. Additionally, Bray purportedly sold land to what he called his "trusty kinsman" in May 1675, one of whom was clarified as Aaron Way. Furthermore, during his testimony against Willard in 1692, Bray called Richard Way, his theoretical brother-in-law, his 'brother'. Greene also mentions one of Bray’s sons was named ‘Henry’, which he postulates was intended as the namesake of Hannah Way’s father. However, there is no reason to think that other relationships couldn’t explain the language. After all, members of a common social group might call themselves "brothers" or "cousins" without any actual blood or marital relationship. Still, it doesn’t help the case of the Gengell identification that Hannah Way is attested to while Hannah Gengell isn’t. John Gengell himself is only sparsely attested to, let alone a hypothetical sister of his, and even then, none of the surviving pieces that attest to his existence give an idea of his personal life. On the other hand,  the Way family is very well documented; manuscript summaries of the parish registers for Bridport and Allington, Dorset, in the collection of the Rev. Richard Grosvenor Bartelot, show that Henry Way married Elizabeth Batchelar on 22 Jan. 1615, (apparently as his second wife) and that they had a daughter "Hanah" who was baptized there on 3 March 1616. Additionally, while it is true and evident in John Gengell’s will that he regarded the Wilkins very highly, he very explicitly avoids calling them relatives. Coincidentally, Aaron Way is also mentioned alongside a “Mary Way” as a witness in the will.&lt;ref&gt; The American Genealogist, Vol. 60; Jan. 1984; ''Bray Wilkins of Salem Village, Ma. and his
children.'' Greene, David L. pp. 14–18, 111-113&lt;/ref&gt;

Bray was only married once, the wedding probably taking place between 1632 and 1636. Bray Wilkins had eight children:

# Samuel Wilkins Sr. (December 1636 – 20 December 1688)
# John Wilkins (22 March 1642 – 1723)
# Lydia Wilkins (25 September 1644 – 1701), who married John Nichols of [[Topsfield, Massachusetts|Topsfield]]
# Thomas Wilkins (16 Mar 1647 – October 1717)
# Margery Wilkins ({{circa}} 1648 – {{circa}} 1697), who married Philip Knight Jr.
# Henry Wilkins (17 July 1651  – 8 December 1737)
# Benjamin Wilkins ({{circa}} 1652 – 1715)
# James Wilkins ({{circa}} 1655 – ?)

'''Charles Strickland''', was the local agent and town planner in [[County Mayo]] for [[Charles Dillon, 14th Viscount Dillon|Lord Dillon]]. He was the founder of the settlement of [[Charlestown, County Mayo|Charlestown]].  In 1860 he helped build the [[Ballaghaderreen Cathedral|Cathedral]] of [[Ballaghaderreen]] where his memory is commemorated in the architecture.

He founded a town in Mayo adjoining the existing settlement of Bellaghy in [[County Sligo]]. Mayo farmers, including tenants of Lord Dillon, were disadvantaged by the rules of the existing market in Bellaghy. They complained to Lord Dillon's local agent Strickland, who conspired to build a new town where the Mayo farmers could sell their produce within a short walk of the established market.

The town was originally named Newtown Dillon but was renamed ''Charlestown'' in Strickland's honour.

In 1860 The Bishop of [[Achonry]] among others installed a window in a chapel at the cathedral to commemorate Strickland of Loughlynn and his wife Maria for their assistance in the construction of the cathedral.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4628">[[File:Duque-de-Luynes.JPG|thumb|right|210px|The first duke of Luynes]]

'''Charles d'Albert, Duke of Luynes''' (5 August 1578 &amp;ndash; [[Longueville, Lot-et-Garonne|Longueville]], 15 December 1621) was [[Kingdom of France|French]] courtier and a [[favourite]] of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], by whom he was made a [[Peer of France|Peer]] and [[Constable of France]] before dying at the height of his influence.

==Biography==
He was the first son of Honoré d'Albert (d. 1592), ''seigneur'' de [[Dukes of Luynes|Luynes]], who was in the service of the three last [[Valois Dynasty|Valois]] kings and of [[Henry IV of France]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=147}}

Charles was brought up at court and attended the [[Dauphin of France|dauphin]], later Louis XIII. The king shared his fondness for hunting and rapidly advanced him in favour. In 1615 he was appointed commander of the [[Louvre Palace]] and counsellor, and the following year [[Grand Falconer of France]]. He used his influence over the king in the court intrigues against the queen-mother [[Marie de' Medici]] and her favourite [[Concino Concini|Concini]]. It was Luynes who, with Vitry, captain of the guard, arranged the plot that ended in Concini's assassination (1617) and secured all the latter's possessions in [[Italy]] and France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=147}}

In the same year he was appointed captain of the [[Bastille]] and lieutenant-general of [[Normandy]], and married [[Marie de Rohan]], daughter of the [[duke of Montbazon]]. He employed extreme measures against the [[pamphlet]]eers of the time, but sought peace in Italy and with the [[Protestants]]. In 1619 he negotiated the [[Treaty of Angoulême]] by which Marie de' Medici was accorded complete liberty. He was made governor of [[Picardy]] in 1619; suppressed an uprising of nobles in 1620; and in 1621, with slight military ability or achievement, was appointed [[constable of France]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=147}}

His rapid rise to power made him a host of enemies, who looked upon him as but a second Concini. In order to justify his newly-won laurels, Luynes undertook an expedition against the Protestants, but died of a fever, aged 43, in the midst of the campaign, at [[Longueville, Lot-et-Garonne|Longueville]] in [[Guienne]], on 15 December 1621.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=147}}

==Family==
{{main|Dukes of Luynes}}
His brother [[Honoré d'Albert (1581-1649)]], first [[duke of Chaulnes]], was governor of [[Picardy]] and [[Marshal of France]] (1619), and defended his province successfully in 1625 and 1635.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=147}}

[[File:Emilia Francis (née Strong), Lady Dilke by Sir Hubert von Herkomer.jpg|right|thumb|An 1887 portrait of Lady Dilke by [[Hubert von Herkomer]]]]
'''Emilia Francis, Lady Dilke''' (née '''Strong'''; 2 September 1840, [[Ilfracombe]], Devon – 23 October 1904) was an [[English people|English]] author, art historian, feminist and trade unionist.

==Biography==
Emilia Francis Strong, the daughter of Henry and Emily Weedon Strong, was called by her middle name, with its masculine spelling, during her childhood and youth. She was raised in [[Iffley]], near [[Oxford]], and attended the [[South Kensington Art School]] in London in her late teens. She married [[Mark Pattison (academic)|Mark Pattison]], Rector of [[Lincoln College, Oxford]], in 1861;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=DILKE, Lady (Emilia Francis Strong)|magazine=Who's Who|year=1905|volume= 57|page=440|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iEVLAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA440}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was then known as '''Francis Pattison''', '''Mrs. Mark Pattison''', or, in some of her publications, as  '''E. F. S. Pattison'''. After Mark Pattison's death in 1884, she married [[Sir Charles Dilke, 2nd Baronet|Sir Charles Dilke]], and was subsequently known as Lady Dilke or Emilia Dilke.  Both of her marriages were topics of some public discussion.

She became a contributor to the ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]'' in 1864 and subsequently was for many years fine-art critic of the ''[[The Academy (periodical)|Academy]]'' and from 1873 its art editor, and she published in numerous other journals in Britain and France.&lt;ref name=DictEntry&gt;{{cite book|editor=Brake, Laurel|editor2=Demoor, Marysa|year=2009|chapter=Dilke, Emilia|title=Dictionary of Nineteenth-century Journalism in Great Britain and Ireland|publisher=Academia Press|page=170|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVrUTUelE6YC&amp;pg=PA170}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In addition to numerous signed and unsigned essays, and her major works of art history, she wrote essays on French politics and on women's trade unionism and women's work. She also published two volumes of supernatural short stories (a third part-volume appeared posthumously).  She was involved with the Women's Protective and Provident League, later the [[Women's Trade Union League]] (WTUL), from near its inception in 1874 and she served as President of the WTUL for many years until her death.   Her niece, [[Gertrude Tuckwell]] (daughter of her sister Rosa and brother-in-law the [[Reverend William Tuckwell]]) worked with her closely in her feminist and trade unionist activities.

[[File:Велихов, Евгений Павлович.jpeg|thumb|220px|right|Evgeny Velikhov (2010).]]
'''Evgeny Pavlovich Velikhov''' (born on February 2, 1935; in Russian: ''Евгений Велихов'') is a physicist and scientific leader in the [[Russia|Russian Federation]].&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{Cite web | title=E. P. Velikhov link at Kurchatov Institute | url=http://www.kiae.ru/rnc1.html | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315040100/http://www.kiae.ru/rnc1.html | archivedate=March 15, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His scientific interests include [[Plasma (physics)|plasma physics]], [[laser]]s, [[Fusion power|controlled nuclear fusion]], [[power engineering]] and [[magnetohydrodynamics]] ([[Pulsed power|high-power pulsed]] [[MHD generator]]s). He is the author of over 1500 [[Scientific literature|scientific publications]] and a number of inventions and discoveries.

He currently holds the post of president of the [[Kurchatov Institute]] (named after [[Igor Kurchatov]]) and first Secretary (head) of the [[Public Chamber of Russia]]. He is a member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] and has been the vice-president of the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]].

== Career ==
Evgeny Velikhov graduated from the Department of Physics at [[Moscow State University|M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University]] (MSU) in 1958, where he specialized in theoretical physics. From 1958 until 1961, he studied at graduate school. After completing his graduate work, he began work as a junior researcher at the ''Institute of Atomic Energy'', the precursor institution to the Russian Research Centre (RRC) "Kurchatov Institute". He spent most of his scientific career rising through the ranks of this famous federal scientific agency.

His early work regarding [[fluid]] and plasma [[Instability|instabilities]] led to the discovery of the [[magnetorotational instability]] in 1959&lt;ref name="V1959"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, he defended his [[Dissertation|thesis]] before receiving his [[Doctor of Science]] degree in [[physics]] and [[mathematics]].

In 1968, he obtained the rank of Professor of [[atomic physics]], plasma physics and microelectronics at the Physics Department of Moscow State University.  In 1973, he became the head of the Department until 1988. 
In 1971, he became a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]].

From 1971 to 1978, he was the director of the [[Magnetic Laboratory]] (later known as the [[TRINITY]] State Scientific Center), a branch of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]] in 1956, and subdivision of Kurchatov Institute since 1961, at [[Troitsk, Moscow Oblast]]. 

In 1972, he founded an energy and space plasma research department at [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]] (MIPT, more known as "Phystech"), with a base in this branch of the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy (KIAE).

In 1975, he established another new [[Academic department|department]] at Phystech in order to study the problems of physics and energy, for which he received the honor of [[Professor|chair]] of plasma energy. The next year, he was appointed as the first [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the ''Faculty of Physics For Energy'' (FPFE), a [[Research and development|R&amp;D]] department of fusion energy specialized in plasma and high pressure physics, quantum optics, laser and space technologies. Ten years later, in 1986, he was promoted as the scientific director of FPFE.

In 1988, he was named director of Kurchatov Institute and chairman of the international programme (Russia, USA, [[European Union]] and Japan) for the creation of the thermonuclear experimental [[tokamak]] [[ITER]], and has been its president from 1992 until the present. In 2009 he was elected Chair of the ITER Council, the governing body of ITER.

He is also president of the [[joint stock company]] [[Rosshelf]] (Russian offshore development company to develop seafloor-based oil and gas production complex), [[Gazprom]]'s subsidiary; and co-chairman of [[Relcom]] board of directors.

Evgeny Velikhov currently resides in Moscow.

==Early life==
Poulter grew up in [[Upland, California]]. At 17, he joined the Navy and served on a ship in Japan. He went AWOL for 1-1/2 years in Japan and ultimately was court-martialed in [[Washington, D.C.]], whereupon he received a [[Military discharge|dishonorable discharge]].&lt;ref name=OConnell/&gt;

==Film role==
In 2013, Poulter was recruited from the streets of Austin to play the third lead, "Wade", in the film ''Joe'', which became his sole film performance, although he worked as a background extra in 1987 in the TV series ''[[Thirtysomething]]''. Shortly before landing the film role, Poulter worked for a traveling carnival, but he was left naked on the side of the road after he was caught stealing money.&lt;ref name=OConnell/&gt;

===Reviews===
''[[The Independent]]'' summed up Poulter's performance in its movie review, writing, "In his only screen role, he offers an utterly compelling portrait of a man so consumed by self-loathing that he will go to extreme lengths to destroy the life of his son."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/joe-film-review-nicolas-cage-delivers-an-astonishing-performance-in-low-budget-drama-9627270.html|title=Joe, film review: Nicolas Cage delivers an astonishing performance in|author=|date=24 July 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Movie critic Peter Sobczynski in his review for [[RogerEbert.com]] described Poulter's film debut as a "stunning performance" and "one of the great one-shot performances in the history of the cinema."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/joe-2014|title=Joe Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (2014) - Roger Ebert|first=Peter|last=Sobczynski|date=|website=www.rogerebert.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Award===
The [[Austin Film Critics Association]] gave Poulter the Special Honorary Award in 2014 for his performance in ''Joe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://austinfilmcritics.org/2014-awards-5d1c9a372b9f|title=2014 Awards – Austin Film Critics Association|author=|date=7 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Before the film's 2014 release, Poulter was found dead on February 10, 2013, at the edge of [[Lady Bird Lake]], a river-like reservoir in Austin, Texas.&lt;ref name=OConnell/&gt; Director Green dedicated the film ''Joe'' to Poulter.&lt;ref name=Labrecque/&gt;

==Life==
She was the eldest daughter of John Stein of Edinburgh. She became, on 19 August 1824, the second wife of [[Sir Alexander Don, 6th Baronet]] of Newton Don, and the intimate friend of [[Sir Walter Scott]].

Hein Mevissen is also the creator and designer of the character [[Olli]] that was original created in 2004 as a character for a bottled [[mineral water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.limburger.nl/article/20141029/REGIONIEUWS01/141029247/1067|title=Olli en het poepkanon trekken de wereld in|language=Dutch|date=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olli is a cartoon character and a [[stuffed toy]].

The original [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name, Olli, is a shortening of Olifantje, "little elephant".
The hype around Olli is explained as a new way of marketing called brand feeling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blauw.com/nl/nieuws/blog/over-olli-brand-feeling-en-twee-rotterdamse-merken|title=Over Olli, brand feeling|publisher=Blauw|date=Feb 14, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223041016/http://www.blauw.com/nl/nieuws/blog/over-olli-brand-feeling-en-twee-rotterdamse-merken/|archivedate=December 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[emotional branding]].

'''Homer William Smith''' (January 2, 1895 – March 25, 1962), best known as '''Homer W. Smith''' was an American [[Physiology|physiologist]] and [[Science journalism|science writer]].

==Biography==

Smith was born in [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]]. He received his [[Doctor of Science|D.Sc]] in 1921 from [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health|Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health]]. From 1928 until his retirement in 1961 he was the Professor of Physiology and Director of the Physiological Laboratories  at [[New York University School of Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;Bing, R. J. (1995). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/clc.4960180814/pdf ''Homer W. Smith and His Contribution to Cardiovascular Medicine'']. ''[[Clinical Cardiology]]'' 18 (8): 486–487.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was a leader in the field of [[renal physiology]].&lt;ref&gt;Giebisch, G. (2004). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15151273 ''Homer W. Smith's Contribution to Renal Physiology'']. J Nephrol 17: 159–165.&lt;/ref&gt; His elegant experiments on the kidney in the 1930s proved beyond any doubt that it operated according to physical principles, both as a filter and a secretory organ, eliminating the last vestige of [[vitalism]] in physiology.&lt;ref name=ANBO/&gt; He used [[inulin]] (at the same time as [[Alfred Newton Richards|A.N. Richards]]), to measure how much kidney filtrate is formed.  His book ''The Kidney: Structure and Function in Health and Disease'', was an authoritative summary of what was known at that time..

He also wrote brilliantly for general readers.   ''From Fish to Philosopher'' explains how evolutionary history accounts for the seemingly bewildering mammalian kidney, in which water, salts, and small molecules are filtered from the blood into kidney tubules and then much of the water and salt and many of the small molecules are pumped back into the blood stream.  Vertebrates originated in fresh water, where water was drawn into their bodies by the [[osmotic pressure]] of their body fluids.  Their kidneys excreted the extra water while also retrieving their supply of small solutes.  He concludes with an admiring discussion of another of his interests:  how rapidly the piano can be played by an educated nervous system sustained by the kidneys.  ''Komongo or, the Lungfish and the Padre''  takes place in the Suez Canal where a scientist returning to the United States with a cargo of lungfish for kidney experiments delivers a monologue to an Anglican Minister on how evolution shapes organisms.  ''Man and His Gods'' &lt;ref name=ANBO&gt;{{Cite book |title = Smith, Homer William |last = Bynum |first = W.F. |publisher = [[American National Biography|American National Biography Online]] |year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/homer1a.htm |title=Homer W.

Fishman. (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

He also served on the board of trustees of Science Service, now known as [[Society for Science &amp; the Public]], from 1952-1955.&lt;ref name=ANBO/&gt;

As a memorial to Smith in 1963 the [[New York Heart Association]] created the Homer W. Smith Award in Renal Physiology.&lt;ref&gt;Hrushka, K. A. (1991). [http://ajprenal.physiology.org/content/260/2/F151 ''American Journal of Physiology - Renal Physiology''] 260 (2): F151–F152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Homer Smith was married to Margaret Wilson, who was the daughter of Lily and James Robert Wilson from Spring City, Tennessee. His son was Homer Wilson Smith.&lt;ref name=ANBO/&gt;

==Views on religion==

Smith attacked [[superstition]] and was critical of religious ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Leon Blau|Blau, Joseph L]]. (1953). ''Reviewed Works: The Scriptures of Mankind by Charles S. Braden; Man and His Gods by Homer W. Smith; The Religions of Mankind by Edmund Davison Soper; What Americans Believe and How They Worship by J. Paul Williams''. ''Jewish Social Studies'' 15 (1): 77–80.&lt;/ref&gt; He identified as an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] but has also been described as an [[Atheism|atheist]] and [[Humanism|humanist]].&lt;ref&gt;Farber, Saul J. (1996). ''Homer W. Smith: The Humanist''. ''[[Kidney International]]'' 49: 1528-1529.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, David. (2015). ''Marine Physiology Down East: The Story of the Mt. Desert Island Biological Laboratory''. Springer. p. 111. {{ISBN|978-1-4939-2959-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith was an advocate of the [[Christ myth theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Graubard, Mark. (1953). ''Reviewed Work: Man and His Gods by Homer W. Smith''. ''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]'' 44 (1/2): 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zadunaisky, José A. (1989). ''Dedication of the Homer W. Smith Laboratory at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, Salsbury Cove, Maine: Friday, July 28, 1989''. Mount Desert Island Biological Loboratory. p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indonesian names''' and naming customs reflect the [[multicultural]] and [[polyglot]] nature of the over 17,000 islands in the [[Indonesian archipelago]]. The world's fourth most populous nation, Indonesia is home to approximately 365 tribal-ethnic groups, each with their own [[culture]], [[customs]], and [[language]]. The state officially recognises more than 300 of these ethnic groups. The [[Javanese people|Javanese]] are the largest single group, comprising around 40 percent of Indonesia's population.

==Honorifics==

In Indonesia, ranks and professional titles are used. It is also customary to use ''Pak'', ''Bapak'' or ''Saudara'' to address men and ''Bu'', ''Saudari'' or ''Ibu'' to address women. ''Pak'' and ''Bapak'' are literally translated as "father". ''Bapak'' is more formal and is used much like the English word, "sir". ''Saudara'' (for men) or ''Saudari'' (for women) is another term of greater respect and formality. It translates to "kinsman", "lady" or "gentleman". ''Ibu'' is literally translated as "mother". It is used as "ma'am" or "lady" would be in English. If addressing a man whose name is unknown, one uses ''Bapak'' and if addressing a woman whose name is unknown, one uses ''Ibu''.

An informal way to address a significantly older person is to use ''Om'', ''Paman'', ''Bibi'' or ''Tante'', which mean "uncle" and "aunt". The terms are Dutch-influenced and quite commonly used in the big cities.

Local honorifics continue to be employed throughout Indonesia. In a casual situation, ''Kakak'' is used to address a person as an older sister or brother. In [[Javanese language|Javanese]] ''Mbak'' is used for "older sister" and ''Mas'' is used for "older brother". ''Mbak'' and ''Mas'' are used for example to address junior staff in cafes and restaurants in Jakarta.

In Sumatran Malay or Minangkabau cultural spheres, an older brother is addressed as ''Abang''. However, it is also common to address a becak driver, angkot driver, vegetable vendor, fishmonger or hawker with ''Abang''.

"Gus" (from ''bagus'') is used exclusively to address an honorable Eastern Javanese person with a strong traditional and religious identity. For example, the Indonesian former president, [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] is often addressed as ''Gus Dur''.

==Naming forms==
Indonesians do not generally use a given or first name and a family, last or surname name. The majority of Indonesians do not have [[family name]]s. Rather, their given names are geographically and culturally specific. Names beginning with "Su" in Indonesian spelling ("Soe" in [[Dutch orthography]]), or ending with an "o" are usually [[Javanese people]]. For example, people called "Suprapto" or "Soeprapto, Joko" are likely to be of Javanese descent. [[Suharto]] is another example.

[[Balinese name]]s are quite distinct, as they have a naming system which denotes birth order. ''Wayan'' means first born. ''Made'' means second born. A Balinese name may also indicate [[caste]]. For instance, a [[Kshatriya]] person may be named "I Gusti".

"Sitompul" and "Rajagukguk" are clan names usually found in people with [[Batak]] or [[North Sumatera|North Sumatran]] heritage.

In general, Indonesian names fall into one of the following categories:

* [[Mononymous person|A single name]], such as [[Sukarno]] and [[Suharto]]
* Two (or more) names ''without'' a [[family name]], such as [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]]
* Two (or more) names ''with'' a [[family name]] such as [[Abdul Haris Nasution]] or [[Mahyadi Panggabean]]
* Two (or more) names ''with'' a [[patronymic]], such as [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] or [[Abdurrahman Wahid]]

==Indonesian naming system==
Until recently, most Indonesians did not have family names. Both men and women usually have a given name and then take the name of their father as a last name. Some, but not all, married Indonesian women take the last name of their husband. This name is usually added after their own "last" name. Therefore, it is not rare for married couples to have different last or family names.

Naming also differs regionally. Some Javanese, especially those of the old generation have [[mononymous person|only one name]]. Bataks have clan names which are used as their surnames. Some Chinese Indonesians have Chinese-style names. In Indonesian telephone directories, names are listed under the first or given name and not under the last or family name.

===Mononymic names===
Example:
:Child's name: Hasan
:Father's name: Suparman
:Mother's name: Wulandari

On the birth certificate, the child's name would be written as "Hasan child of Suparman and Wulandari". The birth certificate of an extramarital child would bear only the mother's name. On a school diploma, the child's name would be written as "Hasan, child of Suparman". On all other official documents (ID card, driver's license, and passport), only the child's name would appear, "Hasan".

===Polynymic names without a family name===
Example:
:Child's name: Hasan Prasetyo
:Father's name: Suparman Prakoso
:Mother's name: Wulandari Hartono

On the birth certificate, the child's name would be written as "Hasan Prasetyo child of Suparman Prakoso and Wulandari Hartono". On all other official documents, the child's name would be written as "Hasan Prasetyo".

===Polynymic names with family name===
If the parents want a family name (or surname) to appear on official documents, the family name should be included on the child's birth certificate.

Example:
:Child's name: Yovan Gunardio Darmawan
:Father's name: Budi Darmawan
:Mother's name: Natalena Tirrand

On the birth certificate, the child's name would be written as "Yovan Gunardio Darmawan child of Budi Darmawan and Natalena Tirrand". On all other official documents, the child's name would be written as "Yovan Gunardio Darmawan".

===Polynymic names with patronymic===
The patronymic is usually constructed from the father's name, with the word ''putra'' (for males, "son" in [[Sanskrit]]) or ''putri'' (for females, "daughter" in Sanskrit) appended.

Example:
:Child's name: Hasan Suparmanputra
:Father's name: Suparman
:Mother's name: Wulandari

On the birth certificate, the child's name would be written as "Hasan Suparmanputra child of Suparman and Wulandari". On all other official documents, the child's name would be written as "Hasan Suparmanputra". This would be somewhat analogous to the practice in [[Icelandic name|Iceland]], where patronymics are used.

Occasionally, the father's name will be used as the surname, without appending ''putra'' or ''putri'' (in this example it would be Hasan Suparman). This might be done unofficially, that is, not matching the birth certificate. Nevertheless, this format sometimes appears on government documents.

==Modifications to the name beyond Indonesia==
Other nations may modify an official Indonesian name to conform to local standards. This is most apparent in nations where individuals normally have a family or last name.

In the Netherlands, for example, a person without an official family name would be given the surname ''Onbekend'' (which means "unknown"). Individuals with multiple-word names will often be given this surname, particularly if the last name on the birth certificate differs from the father's family name. Individuals with a distinct family name may also be given this surname if it is recorded differently on the birth certificate.

Referring to the examples above, a Netherlands identification card would record the individual's name as:
:Example 1: Hasan Onbekend
:Example 2: Hasan Prasetyo Onbekend
:Example 3: Hasan Herianto
:Example 4: Hasan Suparmanputra Onbekend

In Germany, the one-word name is used as both given name and surname. This is often displayed on official documents as "Hasan Hasan" or "H. Hasan".

In the U.S., there are three ways to record people with a single-word name. One way is to use the existing single word name as the surname. Then, an official body will add [[Placeholder name#Fnu Lnu|"Fnu"]] (family name unknown) as the first or given name. This can lead to a false belief that "Fnu" is a common Indonesian first name.

Conversely, the existing single word name can be used as the given or first name and then [[Placeholder name#Fnu Lnu|"Lnu"]] (last name unknown) may be added as the family, surname or last name. This can lead to the misconception that "Lnu" is a common Indonesian surname. In some cases "Fnu" will be used as the surname or last name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/07/07-9550.pdf Example of court document using FNU as a placeholder last name]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, the existing single word name may be duplicated to give a first name and surname such as "Hasan Hasan".

==Origin of names in Indonesia==
===Local family names ===
There are some Indonesian ethnic groups or tribes whose people do maintain a family, last or surname. These include the:
* [[Alas people]] of [[Aceh]], for example, Keruas, Kepale Dese, or Pagan.
* [[Bantenese people]] of [[Java]], for example, Djajadiningrat, Soerjaatmadja, or Prawiranegara.
* [[Batak (Indonesia)|Batak]] people of [[Sumatra]], for example, Nasution, Hutagaol, Sitompul, Karokaro, Rajagukguk, or Sinaga.
* [[Nias]] people and people of the islands off the west coast of Sumatra, for example, Amuata, Falakhi, Laoly, Marunduri, Ote, or Wau.
* [[Minangkabau people]] of [[Sumatra]], for example, Bodi, Caniago, Sikumbang, Koto, or Piliang.
* Tribes in [[Lampung]], for example, Badak, Limau, Gunungalip, or Way Tube.
* Christian [[Betawi people]], for example, Baidan, Djaim, or Senen.
* The royals and nobles from the [[Javanese people]] and the [[Sundanese people]] of [[Java]], for example, Sastrowardoyo, Djojohadikusumo, or Natalegawa.
* [[Dayak people]] of [[Kalimantan]], for example, Belawan, Manuwu, Ngayoh, Kuntai, or Unus.
* [[Minahasan people]] from [[Manado]] and other parts of [[North Sulawesi]], for example, Ratulangi, Gerungan, Sondakh, Mongilong, Waworuntu, or Tambayong.
* [[Sangirese people]] from [[North Sulawesi]] for example, Mohede, Sahanaya, or Palar.
* [[Toraja]] people from [[South Sulawesi]] for example, Batusura, Lumba, Rambulangi, or Manganan.
* Tribes in the [[Molucca Islands]], for example, Malaiholo, Hehamahua, Sahanaya, or Sahilatua.
* Tribes in the [[East Nusa Tenggara]], for example, Hurek, Riberu, Fernandez, da Costa, da Gama, Lamaborak, or Leyn.
* Tribes in the [[West Papua (region)|Papua]], for example, Suebu, Maniani, Wanggai, or Wonda.

===Sanskrit-derived names===
Indonesians regardless of personal religion, particularly the [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] and [[Balinese people|Balinese]] may have names strongly derived from [[Sanskrit]]. This is because of the Indian cultural influence which came to the archipelago since thousands of years ago during the Indianization of South East Asian kingdoms, and ever since, it is seen as part of the Indonesian culture, especially Javanese, Balinese, and some part of Sumatran culture. Thus, related Hindu or Indian culture in Indonesia is present not only as part of religion, but also culture. As a result, it is common to find Muslim or Christian Indonesians with Indo-Sanskritic sounding names. Unlike Sanskrit-derived names in [[Thai names|Thai]] and [[Khmer language|Khmer]], the pronunciation of such names in either Javanese or Indonesian is similar to the original Indian pronunciation, except that the "v" is changed to a "w".

Some common names derived from Sanskrit and using the names of Indian Hindu gods or heroes include [[Indra]], [[Krishna|Krisna]], [[Vishnu|Wisnu]], [[Surya]], [[Dharma]], [[Rama]], [[Lakshmana|Lesmana]], Sudarto (Javanese for [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta]]), [[Devi|Dewi]], [[Prithvi|Pertiwi]], [[Sri]], [[Sita|Sinta]], Ratna, [[Pāramitā|Paramitha]], and Kumala&lt;!--Not supported by the DAB page--&gt;. Other Sanskrit derived names used widely in Indonesia also include such as: Wibisana or Wibisono (from the [[Ramayana]] figure [[Vibhisana]]), [[Arya (name)|Arya]] or Aryo, [[Subrata]], [[Aditya]], [[Abimanyu]], Bima, Sena, Satya, Cakra (read Chakra), Putri, Putra, Mahardhika, Gatot or Gatut (from the [[Mahabharata]] figure [[Ghatotkacha]]), Perdana (from the word "Pradhan"), Prameswara or Prameswari, Pertiwi (from Pritvhi), Dewi (Devi), Wijaya (from Vijay), and many more. Even Indonesian government names of institutions, mottoes, and other terms also use [[Sanskrit]], such as to address an [[Indonesian Navy]] general, the word "Laksamana" (from the Ramayan figure [[Lakshman]]) is used. The "Adipura award" (Indonesian: ''Penghargaan Adipura'') which is an award given to cities throughout Indonesia from the central government for cleanliness and urban environmental management also uses from Sanskrit language which is ''Adi'' and ''Pura''. There are also many mottoes of Indonesian institutions which use [[Sanskrit]] language, such as the motto of the [[Indonesian Military Academy]] which sounds "''Adhitakarya Mahatvavirya Nagarabhakti''".

For example, [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]], former Indonesian president, has a Sanskrit-derived name. "Susilo" comes from ''sushila'' meaning "good character" and "Yudhoyono" comes form ''yudha'' meaning "war" or "battle" and ''yana'' meaning "an epic story". [[Sukarno]] is derived from the Sanskrit ''su'' (good) and ''karno'' or ''[[Karna]]'' (a warrior) in [[Mahabharata]].

Some of these Sanskrit-derived names might be used by ''ningrat'' or ''menak'' (noble) families, especially among Javanese and Sundanese, in much the same way as some family names in western culture indicate lineage and nobility. Some such names are Adiningrat, Notonegoro, Suryasumantri, Dharmokusumo, Wongsoatmodjo, Natalegawa, Kusumaatmadja, Kartadibrata, Kartapranata and Kartasasmita.

In the case of the Indonesian foreign minister, [[Marty Natalegawa]], "Marty" is his first name, indicating his birth in March. "Natalegawa" is his family name, which indicates that he is from a Sundanese noble family.

Many Indonesians use Sanskrit-derived names to indicate their position among siblings (birth order). The first-born child might bear the name ''Eka'' or ''Eko'' (mostly Javanese), the second-born child might be named ''Dwi'', the third-born ''Tri'', the fourth-born ''Catur'', and the fifth-born ''Panca'' or ''Ponco'' (usually Javanese). Some examples are [[Eko Yuli Irawan]], [[Rizky Dwi Ramadhana]], [[Triyaningsih]], and [[Catur Pamungkas]].

===Chinese names===
Under President Suharto, Indonesia attempted to deconstruct organisations and groups that might represent an internal security threat. As a part of the policy to limit the influence of the Chinese [[Communism|Communists]] and to encourage the ethnic Chinese to assimilate, the state required [[Chinese Indonesian]] individuals to change their names. This was a difficult balance because while the names were changed, laws continued to identify them as 'different' from indigenous Indonesian groups. Indonesian businessman, Liem Sioe Liong, for example, had his name changed to [[Sudono Salim]]. With Suharto's downfall came new laws, one of which allowed the Chinese to revert to Chinese family names.

Many of the later generations have kept the Indonesian form of the name. Other Chinese Indonesians, however, maintain their Chinese name as well as their family names. As is customary with [[Chinese family names|Chinese names]], the family name (or surname) is traditionally written in front of the given (or first) name.

===Arabic names===
As [[Islam]] is the largest religion in Indonesia, it is quite common to find [[Arabic names|Arabic]] first names or words. Popular Arabic names include [[Muhammad]] or Mohammad, [[Abdul]], [[Ali]], [[Amir]], [[Annisa]], [[Aisyah]], [[Aziz]], [[Ahmad]], [[Hassan (given name)|Hassan]], [[Habibie]], [[Hidayat]], [[Ibrahim]], [[Nur (name)|Nur]], [[Nurul]], [[Rahman (name)|Rahman]], [[Taufik]] and [[Umar]]. Such names are used by Indonesians not of Arab descent, both as first names and as surnames.

Ethnic groups with strong Islamic influence, such as the [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]], [[Ethnic Malay|Malay]], [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Betawi people|Betawi]] and [[Bugis]], tend to use Arabic names. For example, Indonesian politicians [[Teuku Muhammad Hasan]] (from Aceh) and [[Mohammad Hatta]] (from Minangkabau) have Arabic names. However, some of these ethnic groups with strong Islamic influences, such as the [[Betawi people]], have Arabic names which have been suitable with the local pronunciation, such as Rojak (Razak), Leman (Sulaiman), etc.

[[Arab Indonesian|Arab]]s settled in Indonesia many generations ago, and their descendants still use their family names, for example, Assegaf, Alhabsyi, or Shihab.

The name "Maysaroh" is a common female name amongst the Betawi people. However, this name is actually a male name in Arab countries. It is probably mistaken with the name Saroh, which is in turn derived from [[Sarah (given name)|Sarah]].

===Western names===
Western names were brought to Indonesia by the Portuguese and later the Dutch. Names with a Dutch origin include Henry, Agus, Johan, Andri, Anto (Antonius), Siska, Roni, Jono, Riska, Suzanna, Rian, and Markus. These names are found in Muslim and Christian people of Java.

[[Catholicism|Catholic]] Indonesians may use [[Latin]] first or Christian names such as Antonius, Ignatius, Johannes, Markus, Paulus, Anastasia, Fransiska, Maria, Georgius, and Theresia. [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Indonesians may use Anglicised names such as Anthony, Martin, George, James, John, Paul, Caroline, Eva, Stephanie, Mary, or Melinda.

There are some similarities between the Indonesian Catholic and Muslim names such as [[Fatima (given name)|Fatima]], [[Omar (name) (disambiguation)|Omar]], and Soraya.

Due to [[globalisation]] non-Christian Indonesians may use shortened Western names such as Courtney, Tony or Julie.

Combinations such as "Ricky Hidayat" (Western-Arabic) or "Lucy Wiryono" (Western-Javanese) are to be found as well.

Western-derived names may indicate the month of birth. For example,
* January: Januri (m), Yanuar (m). Example: [[Yanuar Tri Firmanda]].
* February: usually identified from prefix ''Febr-''. Example: [[Febriyanto Wijaya]].
* March: Marti (derived from ''Maret'', Indonesian word for March, which in turn is derived from [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''Maart''). Example: [[Marty Natalegawa]].
* April: usually identified from prefix ''Afri-'' or ''Apri-''. Example: [[Aprilia Yuswandari]].
* May: Mei or its derivations such as Meilanie, Meiliana, Meiliani (all are feminine). Example: [[Meiliana Jauhari]].
* June: Yuni (f) or its derivations such as Yuniar (f), Yuniarti (f), Yuniarto (m). Example: [[Yuni Shara]].
* July: usually identified from prefix ''Juli-'' or ''Yuli-''. Example: [[Alvent Yulianto]].
* August: Agus (n) or its derivations such as Agustin (n), Agustina (f), Agustinus (m, usually borne by Indonesian Catholic). Example: [[Agus Ngaimin]].
* September: usually identified from prefix ''Seft-'' or ''Sept-''. Example: [[Seftia Hadi]].
* October: usually identified from prefix ''Oct-'' or ''Okt-''. Example: [[Yati Octavia]].
* November: usually identified from prefix ''Nov-''. Example: [[Novita Dewi]].
* December: Deasy, Desi, Dessy (all are feminine). Example: [[Desi Anwar]].

===Patronymic family names===
The Indonesian patronymic family name is usually constructed of the father's name, with the word ''putra'' (for male) or ''putri'' (for female) appended. One example is former Indonesian President [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]], the daughter of former President [[Sukarno]]. However, it is also common for the father's name alone to form the child's surname (for instance, 'Ali Ahmad' from the father 'Ahmad Sudharma').

===Matronymic family names===
Located in Western Sumatra, the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] are the largest matrilineal culture in the world and the fourth largest ethnic group in Indonesia. Tribe, clan (or ''suku'') titles, properties and names are all handed down through the female line.

==Nicknames==
It is uncommon, and considered rude, to refer to an Indonesian person by their full first name, unless that name has only one or two syllables. Former Indonesian president [[Abdurrahman Wahid]], for example, had "Abdurrahman" shortened to "Dur". Many Indonesians use a different name altogether; a woman born as "Khadijah" may be known as "Ida" or "Ijah" to all her friends and family.

In [[Sundanese people|Sundanese culture]] it is common for the nickname to become integrated as the first name. For example, someone with the name "Komariah", "Gunawan" or "Suryana" written in their birth certificate may become known as "Kokom" for Komariah, "Gugun" or "Wawan" for Gunawan, and "Yaya" or "Nana" for Suryana. The result is rhyming names such as "Kokom Komariah", "Wawan Gunawan", and "Nana Suryana". Notable people having such names include politician [[Agum Gumelar]], comedian [[Sule (comedian)|Entis Sutisna]] (with stage name [[Sule (comedian)|Sule']]), and sportsman [[Ajat Sudrajat]].

Indonesian people might also take a Western style  nickname such as Kevin, Kenny, Tommy (Tomi), Jimmy, Ricky, Dicky, Bob, Nicky, Nico, Susy, Taty, Lucy (Lusi), Nancy, Marry (Maria) and so on. It does not necessarily mean their names are Thomas (for Tommy) or James (for Jimmy). For instance, [[Suharto]]'s son, Hutomo Mandalaputra is popularly known as "Tommy Suharto". The "Tommy" here was not derived from "Thomas", but from the Javanese name, "Hutomo".

==Noble titles as part of personal name==
In some ethnic groups it is common to include a nobility title into the formal personal name. Due to the various traditions of nobility in each ethnic group, it may be difficult for people from outside a particular ethnic group to discern the nobility title from the personal name.

Acehnese have titles such as ''Teuku'' (male) and ''Cut'' (female). Celebrities with such titles include, for example, Teuku Ryan, Teuku Wisnu, and Cut Tari.

[[Bantenese people|Bantenese]] have titles such as ''Tubagus'' (male) and ''Ratu'' (female). People with such titles include, for example, [[Tubagus Ismail]], and [[Ratu Atut Chosiyah]].

The [[Bugis]] and [[Makassar]] people have titles such as ''Daeng'' and ''Andi'' and the Buton people have titles such as ''La'' (male) and ''Wa'' (female), for example, La Nyalla Mattalitti or Wa Ode Nurhayati.

==Indexing==
According to the [[Chicago Manual of Style]], Indonesian names are [[Subject indexing|indexed]] differently according to the individual practices and customs. If there is one name, it is only indexed under that name. If the family name is printed first, index under the family name with no comma and no inversion.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/CHIIndexingComplete.pdf Indexes: A Chapter from The Chicago Manual of Style]." [[Chicago Manual of Style]]. Retrieved on December 23, 2014. p. 25 (PDF document p. 27).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jan Kefer''' (b. [[Nový Bydžov]], 31 January 1906 – d. [[Flossenbürg]], 3 December 1941) was a Czech astrologer, [[hermeticist]] and publicist in the age between the two World Wars. He was the chairman of Universalia, a society of Czech hermeticists.

== Biography ==
Kefer's father was from [[Bavaria]]. He was born blind due to a congenital defect of his eyes, but this cleared up when he was three years old.  In [[Prague]] he studied at the Archbishop Gymnasium in the classroom of famous mystic [[Jaroslav Ovečka]]. He became a novice at Strahov Monastery, but later left the order. He graduated from [[Charles University in Prague]] with a degree in arts.

Kefer practised [[astrology]], [[kabbalah]], [[Magick (Thelema)|magick]], [[alchemy]] and [[theurgy]]. He wrote many works about astrology and hermetism, and regularly discoursed on these themes in the Universalia Society.  He also translated many meaningful books into [[Czech language]], including [[Bardo Thödol]] or the books of [[Eliphas Lévi]].

Kefer worked as a librarian of the [[National Museum (Prague)|National Museum in Prague]] and later as a librarian of [[Strahov Monastery]] and in the library of the [[Vatican Library|Vatican]].  He was longtime secretary and later president of the society of Czechoslovakian hermeticists, Universalia, and editor of ''Logos'' journal.

Perhaps Kefer's most famous act was performing three magick rituals against [[Adolf Hitler]], with the aim of killing him.  He was arrested on 18 June 1941 by the [[Gestapo]], who offered him a place as Hitler's personal astrologist or participation in his astrological team, but he refused.  Jan Kefer died in [[Flossenbürg concentration camp|Flossenbürg]] concentration camp on 3 December 1941.

[[File:Lasha Darbaidze January 2011.JPG|thumb|border|right|text-top|Lasha Darbaidze, January 2011]]
'''Lasha Darbaidze''' (b. January 23, 1969) is a [[Georgian American|Georgian-born American citizen]] who holds the positions of [[Honorary Consul]] of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] since 2010, and President of the St. George Foundation since 2004.

==Early life==
Darbaidze graduated from the Physical Mathematical School (Komarov) and then earned [[engineering]], [[classics]] and [[philosophy]] degrees at the [[Georgian Technical University]], both in the capital [[Tbilisi]]. He served in the [[Soviet military]] where he earned the rank of Chief Lieutenant and obtained experience in [[military administration]] management. Darbaidze returned to Tbilisi after serving his military duty to pursue his [[entrepreneur]]ial interests.

==Career==
In 1999 Darbaidze immigrated to the [[United States]]. He settled in [[New York City]] and began working as the head of [[security]] for All-Tech Security and Investigation. While there, Darbaidze developed and managed twenty professional security departments/teams for such luxury brands as [[Chanel]], [[Prada]], [[Fendi]] and [[Graff Diamonds|Graff]]. He acquired expertise in [[loss prevention]], [[security management]], [[risk management]], [[audit]]s, [[inventory control]] and safety strategy. Darbaidze decided to open his own security business in 2001 and operated under the name RM Security Services as a major [[subcontractor]] for All-Tech Security and Investigation in the New York [[metropolitan area]]. Then, in 2003 he was recruited by Graff USA to become their U.S. Security Director, a position he currently holds. 

In order to restructure and expand his own business, Darbaidze incorporated RM Security Services under the name LMIP Security, Inc. in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lmipss.com/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820051738/http://lmipss.com/index.html |archivedate=2011-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new structural and financial approach (with investment from Lerner Accounting Services, a private company in [[Brooklyn]], NY, specializing in [[accounting]], [[healthcare]] and regions interstate billing services) gave LMIP Security the financial strength and higher [[insurance]] coverage it needed to provide security services nationwide to such clients as Graff, [[De Beers]], [[Hublot]], [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]]. Darbaidze also maintains his position as a major security subcontractor for All-Tech Security and Investigation, with clients such as [[David Yurman]], [[Judith Ripka]] &amp; [[Longchamp (company)|Longchamp]].

Darbaidze is President of the St. George Foundation, which he founded in 2004, to provide assistance to the Georgian community in the United States. Most notably it purchased the Holy Rosary Church in [[Hanover Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Hanover Township, PA]].&lt;ref&gt;http://citizensvoice.com/news/hanover-twp-church-to-become-georgian-orthodox-monastery-1.78026#axzz1J5IWoX7Q&lt;/ref&gt;  It has become a [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian Orthodox]] monastery and religious center.&lt;ref&gt;http://itv.ge/?m=16&amp;CID=15583&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2011 Darbaidze and foundation members traveled to Tbilisi to make a donation to the Gldani Crisis Center, which provides a home for under-privileged and [[special needs]] children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlinenews.ge/index.php?id=6099&amp;lang=eng |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322154244/http://www.onlinenews.ge/index.php?id=6099&amp;lang=eng |archivedate=2012-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deoagency.ge/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=259%3Avisit-of-an-honorary-councilor-of-georgia-to-usa-to-gldani-crisis-center&amp;catid=58%3Anews&amp;Itemid=222&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the largest source of [[employment]] for the Georgian community in the United States. 

In 2010 the Georgian government awarded Darbaidze the position of Honorary Consul, which is headquartered in [[Millburn, New Jersey|Millburn, NJ]]. This diplomatic status was approved by the [[U.S. State Department]] in November 2010.  However, in October 2011 Georgian government stripped Darbaidze of his Honorary Consul appointment as well as his Georgian citizenship.

== Stuart Baggs ==
'''Stuart Baggs''' was a [[Telecommunications|telecoms]] entrepreneur from the [[Isle of Man]] and was 21 when he appeared on the programme. He was educated at Ramsey Grammar School, and had a fear of ''[[The Muppets]]'' character [[Sam Eagle]].&lt;ref name="Muppet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/what-s-on/manx-entertainment-news/iomtoday-spotlight-stuart-baggs-1-6950480|title=iomtoday spotlight: Stuart Baggs|publisher=|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first business venture was when he sold yo-yos on the school playground.  At thirteen he launched his own telecommunications company, [[Communications in the Isle of Man| Bluewave Communications]], which became a limited company on his eighteenth birthday and which he continued to run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/isleofman/hi/people_and_places/newsid_9204000/9204347.stm |title=The Apprentice: Stuart Baggs 'The Brand' becomes boss |work=BBC |date=18 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He styled himself as "Stuart Baggs—the brand" and nicknamed himself "Herr Baggs" in the crisp-selling task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/Lord-Sugar-unmoved-by-39The.6576776.jp |title= Lord Sugar unmoved by 'The Brand' on Apprentice |date=12 October 2010 |author= John Turner |work=Isle of Man Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baggs produced some memorable quotes throughout the series, including: "Everything I touch turns to sold", "Excuse me, sir, you look like a sausage connoisseur" (quoted to Lord Sugar), "I'm not a one-trick pony, I'm not a ten-trick pony, I have a whole field of ponies—and they're literally all running towards this job",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/the-apprentice/8189916/The-Apprentices-Stuart-Baggs-in-quotes.html |title= The Apprentice's Stuart Baggs in quotes |date=9 December 2010 |author= Unknown |work=The Telegraph |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the infamous "I have to rein in my own extreme masculinity in this task."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.startupdonut.co.uk/blog/2010/11/apprentice-stuart-baggs-show |title= The Apprentice: The Stuart Baggs show |date=18 November 2010 |author= Rachel Miller |work=The Startup Donut}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baggs was eliminated in week 11.

Before firing him, Lord Sugar told Baggs that he was "full of shit" and guilty of dressing up his credentials for his own gain, with particular reference to a telecommunications licence issued in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/the-apprentice/8205039/The-Apprentice-semi-final-review.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Michael | last=Hogan | title=The Apprentice semi final, review | date=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sugar added that Baggs' claims had left him annoyed at himself, as he had fired [[#Elizabeth Locke|Liz Locke]] in the previous week before he was aware of the lie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/tv/2010/12/15/the-apprentice-lord-sugar-rips-into-stuart-baggs-for-being-full-of-s-115875-22784722/|title=The Apprentice: Lord Sugar rips into Stuart Baggs for being "full of s***"|author=mirror Administrator|date=15 December 2010|work=mirror|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baggs denied that he had lied on his CV about the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/apr/09/stuart-baggs-my-greatest-mistake |title=Stuart Baggs: My greatest mistake |author=Graham Snowdon |date= 9 April 2011 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baggs was not invited back to participate in the final.

He was a regular panelist/reporter for ''[[Big Brother's Bit On The Side]]'' from August 2011. In February 2013, he appeared on ''[[The Sarah Millican Television Programme]]'' and said that ''The Apprentice'' had "made him the most unemployable person in the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s108/the-apprentice/news/a457937/apprentice-stuart-baggs-im-unemployable.html |title= 'Apprentice' Stuart Baggs: 'I'm unemployable' |date=11 February 2013 |author= Alex Fletcher |work=Digital Spy |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 2014, he appeared as a contestant on ''[[Come Dine With Me]]'' in his home country, which he called "great fun" while admitting that he was "a terrible cook".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/what-s-on/manx-entertainment-news/baggs-is-back-for-come-dine-with-me-1-6927538 |title=Baggs is back – for Come Dine with Me |work=Isle of Man Today |date=October 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving university, he worked for nine months for [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.|JP Morgan]], a commercial and investment banking institution in London, and left it to appear on the programme. His past jobs have included working in an off-licence and a pub. He was fired in The Apprentice Final 2010, being beaten by Stella English.&lt;ref name="Stella English"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12016281|title=The Apprentice: Stella English wins final|publisher=BBC News Online|date=19 December 2010|accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Sugar said that he was not worried about Chris's future, and said that his doors will always be open for him. Bates was the first male Runner Up of the apprentice UK.

He started working as an Investment Analyst for former [[Dragon's Den]] panelist [[James Caan (entrepreneur)|James Caan]]'s private equity company [[Hamilton Bradshaw]]. After around one year, he joined [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] (PwC)'s Transaction Advisory Services, and studied the ACA qualification from the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] (ICAEW).

== Melissa Cohen ==
'''Melissa Cohen''' is a 27-year-old food business manager from London. She was educated at [[Jewish Free School]], a [[voluntary aided school|voluntary aided]] [[comprehensive school]] in [[Kenton, London|Kenton]] in north London. Formerly a hairdresser before venturing into food business management, where she single-handedly increased the share of the Kosher food market for a major retail chain. She also co-wrote a jingle for a successful supermarket advertising campaign for the same chain.&lt;ref name= "girls"&gt;{{cite press release |title=The Apprentice: meet the girls |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2010/09_september/28/apprentice2.shtml |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=28 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was fired in the fourth week after taking much of the limelight for her confrontations with other contestants without achieving much in the way of success. She returned in episode 12 to help the finalists with their task, and was selected by [[#Stella English|Stella English]] to be in her team.

== Stella English ==
'''[[Stella English]]''' left school with no qualifications, but at the time of entering had become Head of Business Management on the trading floor of a Japanese investment bank.&lt;ref name= "girls" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/218974/Apprentice-winner-Stella-English-engaged-to-scaffolder|title=Apprentice Winner Stella English Engaged to Scaffolder|first=Elisa|last=Roche|date=23 December 2010|publisher=[[Daily Express]]|accessdate=23 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the series winner, beating Chris Bates in the final mainly because of her experience in business. She was born and grew up in [[Thamesmead]], London.&lt;ref name="Stella English"/&gt; She lives in London with her partner Ray, and she was to be married in the Summer of 2011. 
English proved to be a very successful candidate throughout the series, holding the best record against all other competitors. She showed terrific leadership abilities in the second task, where she was dispatched to the boys' team and led them to victory by stopping their arguing and managing them well. She continued to win most of the tasks throughout the series, but in the run up to the final in tasks 9 and 10 she was accused by her fellow candidates of being "wooden" and " vanilla corporate", but Lord Sugar claimed this was because of her working in a Japanese Bank. Due to her consistent performance throughout the series and her serious, some would say ruthless, determination, Lord Sugar made her a finalist. She showed excellent leadership and organizational skills in the last task, and in the boardroom Lord Sugar made the decision to hire English. She commented she was looking forward to the future and she was extremely happy.

In June 2013 Lord Sugar sued English for £35,000 over her failed constructive dismissal case against him. A spokesman for Lord Sugar said: "An application has been made to the tribunal to recover our costs.".  English said "I thought it was over. I am devastated I can’t just move on with my life." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/lord-sugar-suing-apprentice-winner-stella-english-over-employment-tribunal-8648819.html|title=Lord Sugar suing Apprentice winner Stella English over employment tribunal|work=The Evening Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the court case, English divulged that her attempted business ventures — including a fashion label and events company — had fallen flat, meaning that she was now claiming jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit, and was facing a repossession order on her house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2431630/Lord-Sugar-turns-tables-Apprentice-winner-Stella-English-suing-35-000-legal-costs.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Apprentice's downfall: I'm claiming benefits and my home could be repossessed, says woman who quit £100,000 job with Lord Sugar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sugar did not win the case, and  English said that she was keen to put the saga behind her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-24276627 | work=BBC News | title=Lord Sugar loses Apprentice tribunal legal costs bid | date=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014 it was announced that two contractors who worked for English's failed events company were suing her for unpaid fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kentish_gazette/news/stella-english-12408/|title=BBC Apprentice TV star Stella English from Whitstable taken to court over claims of unpaid bills by Ashford printing firm CAD Kent|work=Kent Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015 English was convicted of failing to reveal the identity of the driver of her car when it was caught speeding. English ignored five letters from the police requesting the information.

== Alex Epstein ==
'''Alex Epstein''' is 26 years old and unemployed from [[Manchester]]. Previously the Head of Communications at Masternaut Three X in Leeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexepstein.co.uk/my-entrepreneurial-journey/ Alex Epstein – My experiences at one of the UKʼs fastest growing businesses&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[King David School, Manchester|The King David High School]], a [[voluntary aided school|voluntary aided]] Jewish Orthodox [[comprehensive school]] in [[Crumpsall]] in Manchester. He was awarded 10 A*s at GCSE, but was sacked from his first job making ice-cream at [[Häagen-Dazs]]. He later ventured into corporate communications before losing his job, allegedly because of the recession.&lt;ref name="boys" /&gt;

In week 1, Alex found himself in the boardroom, selected by project manager Dan for his poor working habits. Alex improved in the second and third weeks – the latter especially, where he secured several clients for the bread-making task. Ultimately, his bad habits resurfaced in week 5, where he guided his, and project manager Paloma's team into multiple retail-related errors. His sales ability was also heavily criticised. In week 6, a mixed performance thus far, Alex found himself as project manager for a marketing campaign for cleaning products. Despite his background in communications, Alex broke fundamental advertising rules, and combined with his [[Machiavellianism|Machievellian]] selection of Sandeesh for firing, despite her competent performance, was enough to see him fired by Lord Sugar. Lord Sugar implied that  Laura Moore might have been fired instead of Alex, had Alex selected her to return to the boardroom. He returned in episode 12 to help the finalists with their task, and was selected by [[#Chris Bates|Chris Bates]] to be in his team.

== Christopher Farrell ==
'''Christopher Farrell''' was a 28-year-old [[mortgage broker]] from [[Cheshire]]. He was educated at Overchurch Junior School,&lt;ref name=LE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/apprentice-star-christopher-farrell-breaks-3386012|title=Apprentice star Christopher Farrell breaks silence after fraud case guilty plea|work=Liverpool Echo|author=Helen Hunt|date=24 January 2011|accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a state primary school and [[Woodchurch High School]],&lt;ref name=LE/&gt; a state comprehensive school in the [[Woodchurch]] area of the [[Wirral Peninsula]] in [[North West England]]. He was a [[Royal Marine]] [[Commando]] for 10 years, serving in [[Iraq]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Afghanistan]] before becoming a mortgage broker.&lt;ref name="boys" /&gt;

Farrell was fired in week 8 – his first time in the boardroom. Lord Sugar stated that he felt Christopher was a hard worker and excellent logistically, but lacking in the special talent that is necessary in 'The Apprentice'. He returned in episode 12 to help the finalists with their task, and was selected by [[#Stella English|Stella English]] to be in her winning team.

Farrell has since left the public eye after selling his Financial Services company for an undisclosed fee. However, he was reported to be in the millions.  He is now investing in property and is reported to have a portfolio of up to 30 buildings.

== Dan Harris ==
'''Dan Harris''' is a 34-year-old father-of-two and a sales director from [[Oxfordshire]]. He is a former GB [[Triathlon|triathlete]], who has completed three [[ultramarathon]]s as well as climbing [[Mount Kilimanjaro]]. He once jointly held the world record for the fastest ascent and descent of [[Mount Kenya]]. Whilst studying at [[Southampton Solent University]], he launched three businesses including a nightclub promotions company and an embroidery business that reputedly supplied 30% of the branded garments to Southampton University.

After graduation he worked briefly for a head hunting firm in [[Fareham]], before leaving to join a weapons logistics company in [[Pittsburgh]]. After being made redundant he returned to the UK to pursue an IT career. Unable to find a role, he worked as a dustman before founding his own company. He successfully ran an IT Security firm for 8 years before selling the company and establishing a Recruitment company. He sold this company two years later but rejoined it as non-executive director.

[[The News of the World]] reported that he had made a personal fortune of £2.5M but had lost the majority of that in the recession when his company hit difficulties.
Dan was the first to be fired in the sixth series, despite leading the team to profit and losing by just £15, the show's fourth lowest-ever losing margin. His aggressive style on the task and relaxed attitude in the boardroom were cited as reasons for his firing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/showbiz/1014145/Apprentice-Dan-I-blew-it.html |title=Apprentice Dan: I blew it |author=Tom Latchem |date=3 October 2010 |work=[[The News of the World]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jamie Lester ==
'''Jamie Lester''' is a 28-year-old overseas property developer from London. He is the son of a cab driver, and was educated at [[Ilford Jewish Primary School]] in Ilford in Essex&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/41745/apprentice-jamie-escapes-warning-lord-sugar Apprentice Jamie escapes with warning from Lord Sugar] ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]''. 25 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A former estate agent, he owned two properties by the age of 23 and started his own company at 24, turning over £1,000,000 in two-and-a-half years. He could have been fired in week seven had Sandeesh brought him in the boardroom.
Jamie was fired in week 11. He returned in episode 12 to help the finalists with their task, and was selected by [[#Chris Bates|Chris Bates]] to be in his team. Jamie set up his South-West London estate agency Haus Properties in 2011.

== Liz Locke ==
'''Elizabeth "Liz" Locke''' is a 24-year-old investment banker from [[Birmingham]]. She was educated at [[King Edward VI Handsworth School]], a state grammar school for girls in [[Handsworth, West Midlands|Handsworth]] in [[Birmingham]], from 1996–2003. After experience in investment banking, she has recently ventured into property development and project management.&lt;ref name= "girls" /&gt; Locke graduated from [[Birmingham Business School (University of Birmingham)|Birmingham Business School]], part of the [[University of Birmingham]], in 2007 with a first-class honours degree in accounting and finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business.bham.ac.uk/alumni/news/apprentice.shtml|title=Birmingham Business School|publisher=|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was controversially fired in Week 10 for not having a special 'spark' despite being a record-breaking candidate. In episode 11, [[Alan Sugar]] told [[#Stuart Baggs|Stuart Baggs]] that he was annoyed with himself for firing Liz after being swayed by Baggs' lies in the boardroom. This makes Liz the second person (the first being Miriam Staley) that Sugar has publicly regretted firing after the event. Liz returned in episode 12 to help the finalists with their task, and was selected by [[#Chris Bates|Chris Bates]] to be in his team.

== Laura Moore ==
'''Laura Moore''' is a 22-year-old business development manager from [[Warwickshire]], now living in London. She is a trained violinist, and single-handedly brought in over £500,000 of sales in her first year as a management consultant.&lt;ref name= "girls" /&gt; As project manager in week two, Laura had a hard time controlling her all-girl team, with Karren Brady giving the girls a dressing-down in the boardroom. She appeared in her team's fashion advert in week five and was only brought into the boardroom twice throughout the series. She was fired in week nine, with friend Liz Locke saying that she would be missed.

Before appearing on [[The Apprentice (UK TV series)|The Apprentice]], Laura had been involved in four start-up businesses, and has since been involved in projects to encourage young entrepreneurs.

Laura is still involved with various start-ups, whilst also working in fashion, representing [[The Princes Trust|The Prince's Trust]] as an ambassador, and doing motivational and corporate speaking engagements. She has recently joined the committee of Businesswoman of the Year.

== Joanna Riley ==
'''Joanna Riley''' is a 25-year-old cleaning company owner from [[Leicester]]. She set up her [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]]-based cleaning company at the age of 22. Her first job was as a hotel waitress, later moving into telecommunications at a call centre before becoming her own boss.&lt;ref name= "girls" /&gt; Before the series aired, it was reported that Riley had been convicted for racially abusing three taxi drivers in October 2005.&lt;ref name="criminalpast"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1316798/The-Apprentice-2010-Joanna-Riley-second-contestant-criminal-past.html |title=Second Apprentice contestant's criminal past revealed: Joanna Riley convicted of racial abuse |date=1 October 2010 |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="baddies"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3160961/Apprentice-in-double-scandal.html |title=Sugar baddies |first1=Andy |last1=Crick |first2=Helen |last2=Gilbert |date=1 October 2010 |newspaper=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Joanna was fired in week eleven, finishing fourth. She returned in episode 12 to help the finalist with their task, and was selected by 
[[#Stella English|Stella English]] to be in her team.

Before firing her, [[Alan Sugar|Lord Sugar]] told her that he wanted her to be proud of what she does for a living. He fired her, but praised her hard work, telling her to be very proud of herself and she should leave with her head held up high.

Riley appeared as a contestant on ''Pointless Celebrities'' with fellow ex-Apprentice contestant Stuart Baggs in July 2011.

== Shibby Robati ==
'''Shahab "Shibby" Robati''' is a 27-year-old business owner, originally from [[Leeds]] now living in London. Robati was educated at [[Royal Grammar School, Guildford|The Royal Grammar School]], a boys' [[independent school]] in [[Guildford]] in Surrey. His first job was as a paper boy at the age of 17. He since turned his hand to business development. A voice impersonator and self-confessed comedian, Shibby claims to have made £150,000 turnover and over £90,000 profit in the first year of setting up two businesses.&lt;ref name="boys" /&gt; However, during the series whilst pleading about his inexperience he claimed that he had never been involved in either sales or negotiations. He was fired in week three after leading his team to failure in the breadmaking task. He returned in episode 12 to help the finalists with their task, and was selected by 
[[#Chris Bates|Chris Bates]] to be in his team.

== Sandeesh Samra ==
'''Sandeesh Samra''' is a 26-year-old recruitment consultant from [[Nottingham]]. She started her working life as a sales assistant for [[Toys R Us]]. As a recruitment consultant, she managed to break a company revenue record.&lt;ref name= "girls" /&gt;

Sandeesh performed reasonably well in the opening weeks, notably advocating an exclusivity deal that could have seen her team take victory in the second task. However, this was followed by a string of poor showings – her disruptive attitude towards her Project Manager saw her taken into the boardroom in Week three, where she was accused of hiding behind production. She was accused of not contributing again in weeks five and six, although this claim was disputed in week six, where she somewhat redeemed herself by delivering a good pitch. In the seventh week, despite putting in her best performance as a Project Manager, Sandeesh was fired for bringing the wrong candidates into the boardroom; Lord Sugar could not justify keeping her over Liz Locke and Chris Bates.

== Joy Stefanicki ==
'''Joy Stefanicki''' is a 31-year-old Marketing Director originally from [[Southampton]], and now living in [[Birmingham]].  She started her working life cleaning dishes in her parents' pub before joining a supermarket at the age of 16.&lt;ref name= "girls" /&gt; She was fired by Lord Sugar in Week 2 for having made insufficient effort in the losing team's assignment. Joy was the only candidate who fellow candidates Alex Epstein and Stuart Baggs never worked with during the series.

== Paloma Vivanco ==
'''Paloma Vivanco''' is a 29-year-old senior marketing manager living in London. Born in Peru, she was raised in the [[United States]] and [[Australia]] before attending university in [[New Zealand]]. She started working life frying doughnuts in Donut King before launching her first company at the age of 21 straight out of university, eventually moving into the telecommunications industry.

During her time on The Apprentice Paloma was perceived by the Daily Mail as a villain&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1322470/The-Apprentice-2010-Paloma-Vivanco-real-villain.html&lt;/ref&gt; owing to her extreme "takes no prisoners" attitude and often projected an egotistical image by attacking the backgrounds and abilities of other candidates including her own Project Manager Shibby Robati saying to him "I am a businesswoman and you are a joke!" and saying that he "has the business skills of a schoolboy" and despite helping Sandeesh Samra get Shibby fired she later brutally attacked her and contestant Alex Epstein for no reason prior to her firing. Vivanco also tried deliberately to set up Epstein as a scapegoat.

In week one, she demonstrated her ability to work effectively as part of a team, as a manufacturing member. Week three saw Paloma's sales abilities highlighted by Karren. Week five displayed her managerial skills when she was project manager for the task. Her ultimate flaw, which eventually led her to be fired in week five, was her tendency to have an extreme "takes no prisoners"&lt;ref name= "girls" /&gt; attitude, where she often projected an egotistical image by attacking the backgrounds and abilities of other candidates. She returned in episode 12 to help the finalists with their task, and was selected by [[#Stella English|Stella English]] to be in her team.

'''Mark T. Abene''' (born February 23, 1972) is an American [[infosec]] expert and entrepreneur, originally from [[New York City]]. Better known by his [[pseudonym]] '''Phiber Optik''', he was once a member of the [[hacker groups]] [[Legion of Doom (hacking)|Legion of Doom]] and [[Masters of Deception]].

Phiber Optik was a high-profile [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] in the 1980s and early 1990s, appearing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Harper's]]'', ''[[Esquire Magazine|Esquire]]'', in debates and on [[television]]. He is an important figure in the 1995 non-fiction book, ''Masters of Deception — The Gang that Ruled Cyberspace'' ({{ISBN|978-0-06-092694-6}}).

==Early life==

Abene's first contact with computers was at around 9 years of age at a local department store, where he would often pass the time while his parents shopped. His first computer was a [[TRS-80 MC-10]] with 4 [[kilobyte]]s of [[Random-access memory|RAM]], a 32-column screen, no lower [[computer case|case]], and a [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] [[tape recorder]] to load and save programs. As was customary at the time, the computer connected to a [[television set]] for use as a [[computer monitor|monitor]]. 

After receiving the gifts of a RAM upgrade (to 20K) and a 300 [[baud]] [[modem]] from his parents, he used his computer to access [[CompuServe]] and shortly after discovered the world of dialup [[Bulletin Board System|BBSes]] via people he met on CompuServe's "[[CB simulator]]", the first nationwide online chat. On some of these BBSes, Abene discovered dialups and guest accounts to [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[minicomputer]]s running the [[RSTS/E]] and [[TOPS-10]] [[operating system]]s as part of the [[BOCES]] educational program in Long Island, New York. Accessing those DEC minicomputers he realized there was a programming environment that was much more powerful than that of his own home computer, and so he began taking books out of the library in order to learn the programming languages that were now available to him. This and the ability to remotely save and load back programs that would still be there the next time he logged in had a profound effect on Abene, who came to view his rather simple computer as a window into a much larger world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-10270582-83.html Q&amp;A: Mark Abene, from 'Phiber Optik' to security guru], cnet.com; accessed February 8, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having learned about programming and fundamental security concepts during those early years, Abene further honed his skill in understanding the intricacies of the nationwide telephone network.{{cn|date=February 2018}} In the mid-1980s he was first introduced to members of the [[Legion of Doom (hacking)|Legion of Doom (LOD)]], a loosely knit group of highly respected teenage hackers who shared Abene's uncompromising desire to understand technology.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} 

Their main focus was to explore telecommunications systems, minicomputer and [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] operating systems and large-scale packet data networks. The eventual decline of the LOD toward the late 1980s largely due to fragmentation and dissention within the group, coupled with the legal prosecution of a handful of its members, caused Abene to increasingly align himself with a local group of up-and-coming hackers, who came to be known as the [[Masters of Deception|Masters of Deception (MOD)]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==Legal tribulations==
On January 24, 1990, Abene and other MOD members had their homes searched and property seized by the [[U.S. Secret Service]] largely based on government suspicions of having caused [[AT&amp;T Corporation]]'s network crash just over a week earlier on January 15 (Abene was personally accused by the Secret Service of having done as much, during the search and seizure). Some weeks later, AT&amp;T themselves admitted that the crash was the result of a flawed software update to the switching systems on their long distance network, thus, human error on their part.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/SWE/Papers/att_collapse.html All Circuits are Busy Now: The 1990 AT&amp;T Long Distance Network Collapse]&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1991, Abene was arrested and charged with computer tampering and computer trespass in the first degree, New York state offenses. Laws at the time were considered a “gray area” concerning information security. Abene, who was a minor at the time, pleaded "not guilty" to the first two offenses and ultimately accepted a plea agreement to a lesser misdemeanor charge, and was sentenced to 35 hours of community service.&lt;ref name="Newsbytes"&gt;Newsbytes&lt;/ref&gt;

Abene and four other members of the Masters of Deception were also arrested in December 1991 and indicted by a Manhattan federal grand jury on July 8, 1992, on an 11-count charge. The indictment relied heavily on evidence collected by court-approved wire tapping of telephone conversations between MOD members. According to U.S. Attorney [[Otto G. Obermaier|Otto Obermaier]],&lt;ref name="Newsbytes"/&gt; it was the "first investigative use of court-authorized wiretaps to obtain conversations and data transmissions of computer hackers" in the United States.

According to a July 9, 1992 newsletter from the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], the defendants faced a maximum term of 50 years in prison and fines of $2.5 million if found guilty on all counts. Despite the fact that Abene was a minor at the time the crimes were allegedly committed, was only involved in a small fraction of the sub-charges, and often in a passive way, a plea arrangement resulted in by far the harshest sentence: 12 months imprisonment, three years probation and 600 hours of community service.

After serving the one-year sentence at the Federal Prison "Camp" in [[Schuylkill, Philadelphia|Schuylkill, Pennsylvania]], Abene was released in November 1994. In January 1995, a huge celebration called "Phiberphest '95" was held in his honor at Manhattan's [[Irving Plaza]] ballroom/nightclub. In ''Time'', Joshua Quittner called him "the first underground hero of the Information Age, the Robin Hood of cyberspace."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982254,00.html Hacker Homecoming]&lt;/ref&gt; Upon leaving jail, Phiber Optik made the [[@Cafe]] his hang out spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWssRVJgPqc&amp;t=365|title=The hippest internet cafe of 1995 - YouTube|work=[[YouTube]]|date=2016-08-24|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social protests==
Many people inside and outside of the hacker world felt that Abene was made an example of, and was not judged according to earlier court standards.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Abene had built up a significant reputation in the hacker sub-culture, for example regularly appearing on the radio show ''[[Off the Hook (radio program)|Off the Hook]]'', hosted by [[Eric Corley]] (a.k.a. Emmanuel Goldstein), debating and defending the morals and motivations of hackers in public forums and in interviews, and lecturing on the history of telecommunications technology at the night courses of several New York City universities. At the time of the indictment he was working at [[MindVox]], an early BBS/ISP founded by two New York LOD members, and subsequently on [[EchoNYC]], a multi-user BBS and early ISP.

ECHO users, ECHO management themselves and hackers around the nation expected Abene to get off with probation or at most a few months of jail time. Co-defendants and previous offenders charged with "hacking" offenses had received rather lenient punishments, and given his new-found enthusiasm for using his knowledge to constructive ends, the general feeling was optimistic prior to sentencing.

A statement made by U.S. Attorney Otto Obermeier in conjunction with the indication, "The message that ought to be delivered with this indictment is that such conduct will not be tolerated, irrespective of the age of the particular accused or their ostensible purpose,"&lt;ref&gt;Newsbytes, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; was interpreted by Abene's supporters to mean that MOD was made an example of, to show that the authorities could handle the perceived "hacker threat". During sentencing, Judge Stanton said that "the defendant stands as a symbol here today," and that "hacking crimes constitute a real threat to the expanding [[information highway]]", reinforcing the view that a relatively harmless "teacher" was judged as a symbol for all hackers.&lt;ref&gt;Dibbel, 1994 and Goldstein, 1993, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional life==
Abene has spoken on the subject of security in many publications such as ''The New York Times'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. He has appeared as a speaker at both hacker and security industry conferences worldwide and frequently visits universities to speak to students about information security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/6578941 "The Rise &amp; Fall of Information Security in the Western World" (2007)], vimeo.com; accessed February 8, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

After some years as a security consultant, he joined forces with former Legion of Doom member Dave Buchwald and a third colleague, Andrew Brown, to create the security consulting firm Crossbar Security.{{cn|date=February 2018}} Crossbar provided consulting services for third party companies, during which the principals conducted business in the U.S., Japan, Brazil, and Sweden. As a result of the "dot com" bust Crossbar ultimately went defunct in 2001, largely due to cuts in corporate security spending.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Abene made his acting début as "The Inside Man" in the fiction film ''[[Urchin (film)|Urchin]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urchinthemovie.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629000247/http://www.urchinthemovie.com|date=2007-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; completed in 2006 and released in the US in February 2007, in which other hacker notables such as [[Dave Buchwald]] and [[Eric Corley|Emmanuel Goldstein]] can also be seen. In 2009, he founded [[Vectra Networks Inc.|TraceVector]], an [[intrusion detection]] firm that makes use of [[supercomputing]] and [[data analytics]]. He currently resides in [[Silicon Valley]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

===International politics===
According to Rath, events of the last century in the international arena have been driven by pharmaceutical and oil companies. Rath claims that [[World War II]] was started and exploited by these interests.&lt;ref name="FallofRath"/&gt; In court filings, Rath and his lawyers write that the pharmaceutical industry then started [[apartheid]] in South Africa as part of a global conspiracy to "conquer and control the entire African continent." Former [[Nazi]] officials and the German chemical company [[IG Farben]] are specifically mentioned as playing a central role in the alleged conspiracy. In these documents, Rath also compares his adversaries in court to Hitler's storm troopers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=6&amp;art_id=nw20070510150555640C886929 'Apartheid a pharmaceutical plot-Rath'] IOL-South Africa, 10 May 2007.

Rath suggests that the pharmaceutical industry continues to control international politics today, allowing 9/11 to occur and starting the Iraq War to divert attention from what Rath considers the failures of drug companies.&lt;ref name="no-drugs"/&gt; On his website, Rath states that United States President [[George W. Bush]] and Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], at the behest of what Rath calls the "pharmaceutical cartel", were planning a nuclear war in advance of the 4 November 2008 elections in the United States. Rath has made similar claims in the ''[[New York Times]]'' and other major newspapers around the world in the form of large advertisements reportedly designed to resemble newspaper editorials.&lt;ref name="business-guardian"/&gt;

==Awards==
In 2001, Rath was presented the Bulwark of Liberty Award by the [[Health freedom movement|health freedom]] advocacy groups the American Preventive Medical Association and the National Foundation for Alternative Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-77147816.html Health Products Business magazine] Published 1 July 2001.

==Efficacy and marketing claims==

=== SKAK ===
In 2004, the Swiss Study Group for Complementary and Alternative Methods in Cancer (SKAK), an independent group which evaluates [[alternative medicine|alternative medical treatments]], examined Rath's vitamin preparations and the marketing claims made by Rath.&lt;ref name="swiss"&gt;[http://www.swisscancer.ch/dt_fr/content/orange/pdf/skak/04_rath_e.pdf Report from the Swiss Study Group on Complementary and Alternative Methods in Cancer], stating that there is no evidence that Rath's treatments are effective. Retrieved 21 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The Study Group reported that they "found no proof that the vitamin preparations of Dr. Matthias Rath have any effect on human cancer" and "advise against their use in cancer prevention and treatment while recommending a diet rich in fruit and vegetables."&lt;ref name="swiss"/&gt; Specifically, the Swiss Study Group report criticised Rath for:

*Making sweeping, unsubstantiated claims of efficacy. Rath has claimed that his vitamin treatments can cure all forms of cancer, as well as most [[infectious disease]]s, including AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;Rath, M.: Durchbruch der Zellforschung im Kampf gegen den Krebs. 3d ed. 2002, MR Publishing B.V., Almelo, NL&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brochure"&gt;Rath, M.: Cellular health Series – Cancer. 2/2001, MR Publishing, Sta. Clara, CA 95054&lt;/ref&gt;
*Citing anecdotal reports of success which could not be confirmed. In the case of one patient allegedly "cured" by Rath's methods, the Study Group found that "it is not even certain from a medical perspective if cancer was present."
*Using a self-developed test of efficacy, rather than using widely accepted and verified tests and endpoints.

The conclusion of the Swiss Study Group regarding Rath's vitamin formulations was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A cancer-curing effect has not been documented for any of these substances. Nor is there any proof that the preparations sold by Matthias Rath, some with high dosages, are useful in cancer prevention – leave alone curing cancer. Rath still owes proof regarding the correctness of his claims. Proof of effect cannot be provided by analogy with in vitro, animal or cell experiments. Because there is no proof for effect nor for the harmlessness of the preparations, SKAK advises against their use.&lt;ref name="swiss"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Harvard multivitamin study===
To support the use of multivitamins in HIV/AIDS, Rath has cited a study conducted by the [[Harvard School of Public Health]], published in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fawzi W, Msamanga G, Spiegelman D, Wei R, Kapiga S, Villamor E, Mwakagile D, Mugusi F, Hertzmark E, Essex M, Hunter D | title = A randomized trial of multivitamin supplements and HIV disease progression and mortality | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 351 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–32 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15229304 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa040541}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that multivitamin supplementation slows the progression of HIV to AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.dr-rath-foundation.org/NHC/researcharchive.html#aids Dr. Rath's website, citing the New England Journal of Medicine study among others.]. Retrieved 20 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, the study authors released a statement condemning Rath's "irresponsible and misleading statements, as in our view they deliberately misinterpret findings from our studies to advocate against the scale-up of antiretroviral therapy."&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/press/releases/press05062005.html Statement from the authors of the Harvard School of Public Health study], stating that Rath has misused their study results. Retrieved 20 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The study authors felt that Rath had misused their study results to argue that multivitamins should be used ''in place of'' antiretroviral medication. In their statement, the study authors affirmed the central role of [[HAART|antiretroviral medication]] in the treatment of AIDS, and indicated that multivitamins should be, at most, a ''supplementary'' treatment.&lt;ref name="harvard"/&gt;

===Use of published medical literature===
A 1998 article in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' examined some of the claims made by Rath and Health Now in support of Rath's multivitamin supplement blend.&lt;ref name="bmj"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tröger U, Meyer F | title = Validity of advertising claims for multivitamin preparation Vitacor 20/90 on the internet | journal = BMJ | volume = 317 | issue = 7165 | pages = 1069–71 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9774300 | pmc = 1114069 | doi=10.1136/bmj.317.7165.1069}} – article also [http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/317/7165/1069 available online] in its entirety.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors found that Rath listed 40 citations to support his product; however, on examination, only 8 of these citations were of actual clinical trials. After examining these clinical trials, the authors concluded that despite Rath's claims to the contrary, "no general clinical benefit of vitamins C and E and carotene can be proved from the works cited by Health Now."&lt;ref name="bmj"/&gt;

=== Claims of WHO and UN support ===
Rath's advertising material has suggested that his nutritional supplements are superior to antiretroviral therapy in the treatment of HIV/AIDS and implied that his claims were endorsed by the [[World Health Organization]], [[UNICEF]], and [[UNAIDS]]. However, these agencies issued a joint statement condemning Rath's advertisements as "wrong and misleading".&lt;ref name="unreuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO.UNICEF.UNAIDS"&gt;{{cite news | title = UN condemns irresponsible attack on antiretroviral therapy | date = 30 March 2005 | publisher = WHO, UNICEF, and UNAIDS | url = http://www.unicef.org/media/media_25810.html | accessdate = 15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Watson J | title = Vitamin guru provokes wRath of scientists, activists | journal = Nat Med | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 581 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15937452 | doi = 10.1038/nm0605-581a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

=== Credentials ===
The [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] (DA), official opposition party in South Africa, said Rath was representing himself as a medical doctor in his literature distributed in South Africa, and claimed that this was against the law since he was not registered as a doctor in South Africa. The DA filed complaints with the Health Professions Council of South Africa and the police. The Health Professions Council said it could not discipline Rath since its jurisdiction is restricted to registered doctors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aegis.com/news/sapa/2007/SA070702.html 'Health council says it cannot stop Rath'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416084517/http://www.aegis.com/news/sapa/2007/SA070702.html |date=16 April 2009 }} South African Press Association, 12 July 2007.

===South African Council of Churches===
To address the "confusion" created by Rath's advertising campaign, the [[South African Council of Churches]] issued a statement that Rath's activities in South Africa "can only be interpreted as misguided strategies to promote Rath's own brand of nutritional supplements." The Council affirmed the importance of both antiretroviral medication and good nutrition for people with HIV, and pointed out that multivitamins are distributed by [[public health]] services and need not be obtained from Rath's organisation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacc.org.za/news05/rathads.html "Don't Be Confused by Unproven Medical Claims, SACC warns"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231094538/http://www.sacc.org.za/news05/rathads.html |date=31 December 2006 }}.

The first Mist's name was Kyle Nimbus. He fought in [[World War I]] as a Captain in the Canadian Army, winning the [[Victoria Cross]]. He was also a scientist and created a device that turned his body into a gaseous form; he became a supervillain, first fighting the Golden Age [[Sandman (DC Comics Golden Age)|Sandman]] under the name 'Johnathon Smythe', before changing his name to the Mist. In 1941 he undertook a crimewave in [[Opal City]] and was stopped by Ted Knight, the Golden Age [[Starman (DC Comics Golden Age)|Starman]]; he vowed revenge on Starman and became his nemesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia|last= |first= |year=2004|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Limited|isbn=0-7566-0592-X|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the [[Ultra-Humanite]]'s incarnation of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], and appeared during the late 1980s ''Starman'' series (chronicling the adventures of [[Starman (comics)#Will Payton|Will Payton]]), then using the name '''Nimbus'''.

The Mist had two children named Nash and Kyle.

In the early 1990s after Ted Knight had retired (following the events of ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]''), the Mist planned his final revenge on Starman and sent his son, also named Kyle, to kill Knight's son David, as well as nearly killing his second son, [[Starman (Jack Knight)|Jack]], demolishing his home and kidnapping the elder Knight. In exchange for his father, Jack battled the younger Kyle, resulting in the junior Kyle's death, which drove the Mist mad. He was like this for some time until making a deal with the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]], restoring his sanity. This allowed him to advise his daughter on joining Simon Culp's scheme to destroy Opal City and conversely kill Culp himself when he threatened her, on the grounds he "hated dwarfs". Ultimately, he revealed he was tired and had decided to end his life, planting a nuclear bomb in Opal City set to detonate at the moment of his death and then taking poison. However he failed to destroy the city as a terminally ill Ted Knight used an advanced version of his gravity rod to lift the entire building miles into the air; the two enemies made peace just before the Mist's heart stopped, killing them both.

==== Earth-Two version ====
What follows is an account of the Mist's history as it existed on the world of [[Earth-Two]], prior to the consolidating of DC Comics' alternate Earths in the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' miniseries. Much of this can still be considered canon where it does not contradict later established information.

June 1962 saw Earth-Two's public re-emergence of [[Vandal Savage]]. He briefly terrorized a handful of important U.S. cities and was able to attack and incapacitate various members of the retired [[Justice Society of America|JSA]].(''Flash'' #137, 6.63) This brazen attack on major American cities and on the persons of a handful of retired JSAers resulted in the re-emergence and the re-formation of the Justice Society of America. This did not have an immediate effect on the super-scientists and criminals who operated openly in the 1940s and covertly in the 1950s, but over time this curious breed of villain did begin to re-emerge.

September 1965 found the Mist working with a gang of hoodlums along the Atlantic coast in Park City. With his secret formulas and gadetry he was controlling Mrs. Dinah Lance, using the Drake Flower Shoppe as the means to gain access to the wealthy citizenry, and using his hypnotic influence to have the rich rob themselves and hand over their wealth to the Mist's henchmen.

Though Park City did have a protector in the guise of the [[Black Canary]], this heroine was only seen infrequently and the Mist seemed not to have been perturbed by this. Though he was using Mrs. Lance he never discovered her dual identity as the Black Canary.

By September his crime spree was advancing nicely and was baffling the local police. Finally, a local private investigator – Mr. Larry Lance (and husband to Dinah Lance) figured out the connection between those robbed and his wife's flower shop. At about this time the Lance family was visited by their friend [[Starman (Ted Knight)|Ted Knight]], he accidentally intercepted a hypnotic sound wave sent by the Mist. Together the three heroes went about hunting down the gang and the leader.

During this crime spree, the Mist discovered how to use his inviso-solution, sound waves and a recording of motor noises from the Park City Observatory to block star-energy from reaching Starman's gravity rod, in effect making it powerless; however, Starman had with him a newer, quasar-powered rod which proved impervious to the deactivation. In the end the Mist and his men were defeated and handed over to the police. (''The Brave &amp; the Bold'' #61, 9.65)

=== Mist (Nash) ===
Nash was not initially the villain that her father or brother were, but rather a meek, stuttering girl. During her father's campaign of revenge against Ted Knight she was in a position to kill Jack Knight, but let him go after he reasoned that she personally had no reason to kill him. However, after Jack killed her brother she underwent a major personality shift and became the second Mist, exposing herself to the same process that had transformed her father. During her first major crimewave she drugged Jack, had sex with him while he was unconscious and became pregnant. She later gave birth to a son, Kyle Theo. named after her father and Jack's. She passed on a second opportunity to kill Jack, deciding to better herself as a villain whilst Jack worked to become a better hero. She spent much time in Europe where she killed the second [[Amazing Man (DC Comics)|Amazing Man]], [[Crimson Fox]] and [[Blue Devil (DC Comics)|Blue Devil]]. She was then one of the many villains who took part in the plan to destroy Opal City during the ''Grand Guignol'' storyline. After this failed, her father made his own attempt to destroy the city. Since his plan would kill Nash and her son, she attempted to stop him. Her father shot her and in her dying moments she gave her son over to Jack.

== Powers and abilities ==
Both Mists are able to transform into a living vapor, becoming tangible and intangible at will.

== In other media ==
=== Television ===
The Kyle Nimbus version of Mist appears on ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', portrayed by [[Anthony Carrigan (actor)|Anthony Carrigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/22/the-flash-things-you-cant-outrun-review|title=THE FLASH: "THINGS YOU CAN'T OUTRUN" REVIEW|last=Schedeen|first=Jesse|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=October 21, 2014|accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nimbus is a mob hit-man, who was turned on by his employers and testified against. After being charged he was made a death row inmate who was being executed via gas chamber when the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator exploded, giving him his elemental abilities as he can literally transform into the gas that was being used to execute him. He begins executing people responsible for landing him in prison, the last attempt being [[Joe West (Arrowverse)|Joe West]], his arresting officer. [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]] is able to defeat The Mist after keeping him in his gas state for an overextended amount of time, weakening him to the point of unconsciousness. He was later locked in a makeshift cell in the converted particle accelerator turned metahuman prison. He is briefly seen again in the episode "Power Outage", but just in his mist form. He is shown again in the episode "Rogue Air" when he and the other prisoners manage to escape while being transferred from the particle accelerator prison to the island prison of Lian Yu.

'''Naum Krnar''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Наум Крнар}}; d. 13 July 1817) was the secretary of [[Karađorđe]], the leader of the [[First Serbian Uprising]].{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=670}} Krnar was an ethnic Greek, hailing from [[Thessaly]].{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=670}} He spoke several languages and worked as a merchant in [[Belgrade]].&lt;!-- --&gt; With the outbreak of the uprising, Krnar, who had enriched himself through the trade of leather and fur, immediately joined Karađorđe in the organization, and became his personal secretary and chairman in the Serbian Ruling Council (''[[Praviteljstvujušči sovjet serbski]]'').&lt;!-- --&gt; It is unknown whether he fled Serbia with Karađorđe after the suppression by the Ottomans in 1813.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=670}} As many of the Serbian commanders, he found refuge in the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;!-- --&gt; He was a founding member of the [[Filiki Eteria]] (1814).&lt;!-- --&gt; On 12 July 1817, on the [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]], he and Karađorđe secretly crossed the [[Danube]] into [[Revolutionary Serbia|Serbia]], in order to continue the [[Serbian Revolution]], however, the leader of the [[Second Serbian Uprising]], [[Miloš Obrenović]] (who had stopped the rebellion in exchange for Ottoman autonomy), learnt of this and had them both beheaded, their heads sent to the Sultan in Constantinople. Karađorđe and Krnar stayed in a cottage in the village of [[Radovanj]] in the [[Smederevo]] ''[[nahija]]''.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=670}} Nikola Novaković, a henchman of [[Vujica Vulićević]], first killed the sleeping Karađorđe with an axe blow to the head, then shot Krnar, who was washing himself and getting water for Karađorđe in the river downwards from the cottage, with a rifle, on 13 July.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=670}} Novaković beheaded both with his [[yatagan]], and took them with him on horse to Kolare, and then to Belgrade, where he gave them to Miloš Obrenović.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=670}} Obrenović in turn gave them to [[Marashli Ali Pasha]] who took them to Constantinople.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=670}} The heads were on public display for seven days.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=671}} They were then held at the Museum of Sciences in Istanbul.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=671}} They say that Greeks later stole the heads, and took them to Athens to be held in a museum.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=671}} The bodies of Karađorđe and Krnar were buried in a tomb in Radovanj by priest Jovan and Dragić Vojkić.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=671}} The body of Karađorđe was transferred to [[Oplenac]] in 1919, while Krnar's body is still buried in the tomb.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=671}}

==Descendants==
Krnar left a young son, Joca, after him. Joca took the surname ''[[Naumović]]''.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=671}} Joca was handsome, tall, had black hair and moustache.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=671}} He was serious, agreeable, a capable and correct officer.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=671}} Joca was a cavalry officer, and later served as first adjutant of [[Alexander Karađorđević, Prince of Serbia|Aleksandar Karađorđević]], with the rank of colonel, then served as a chief of an [[okrug]].{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=671}} Pensioned, he died at 64 years of age on 28 December 1878 in Belgrade and was buried in the Church of St. Mark in [[Palilula, Belgrade|Palilula]].{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=671}} He had three sons (Mihailo, Mirko, Boja) and a daughter (Maca).{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=671}}

The rule of [[Alexander Obrenović]] (r. 1889–1903) was largely criticized, with dissatisfaction throughout the country. After a failed attempt to kill Obrenović, a military conspiracy group decided to stage the assassination at the royal palace. They recruited officers of the Royal Guard, including lieutenant colonel Mihailo Naumović, a grandson of Naum, who had sympathy toward the Karađorđević due to the murder of his grandfather ordered by Miloš Obrenović. The royal couple were assassinated in the [[May Coup (Serbia)|May Coup (1903)]], which led to the reinstatement of the Karađorđević dynasty.

During his tenure from 1990 until his death in 2011, the Mir Yeshiva grew into the largest [[yeshiva]] in Israel with nearly 6,000 undergraduate students&lt;ref name="vos"/&gt; and over 1,600 ''avreichim'' (married students).&lt;ref name="yated"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.communitym.com/article.asp?article_id=102013 |title=Rav Nosson Tzvi Finkel z.s.l. |first=Rabbi Yehuda |last=Beyda |work=Community Magazine |year=2012 |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one estimate, he taught 25,000 students over his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rav Nosson Tzvi |first1=Rebbetzin Sara |last1=Finkel |first2=Rabbi Yehuda |last2=Heimowitz |publisher=[[ArtScroll|Mesorah Publications, Ltd.]]|year=2012 |isbn=1-4226-1193-0|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he suffered from [[Parkinson's disease]] for the last 28 years of his life,&lt;ref&gt;Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; experiencing involuntary spasms and slurred speech, he did not let his illness stop him from learning [[Torah study|Torah]] for long hours, delivering regular ''[[Shiur (Torah)|shiurim]]'' (lectures), and fund-raising for his yeshiva around the world.&lt;ref name="hamodia"/&gt; He raised an estimated US$500 million for the Mir during his tenure as rosh yeshiva.&lt;ref name="donn"&gt;Donn, Yochonon. "'My Everyman Brother-in-Law Who Became a Gadol'". ''Hamodia'', 17 November 2011, p.

==Early life==
Nosson Tzvi Finkel was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] to Rabbi Eliyahu Meir Finkel and his wife, Sara Rosenblum, who ran a [[Kashrut|kosher]] catering business.&lt;ref name="haaretz"/&gt; His paternal grandfather, Rabbi Avraham Shmuel Finkel, was a ''[[mashgiach ruchani]]'' at the [[Hebron Yeshiva|Hebron yeshiva]] in Israel,&lt;ref&gt;Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; and his paternal great-grandfather was the [[Nosson Tzvi Finkel (Slabodka)|Alter of Slabodka]], Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel, after whom he was named.&lt;ref name="vos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vosizneias.com/94340/2011/11/08/jerusalem-torah-torah-chigri-sak-hagaon-harav-nosson-tzvi-finkel-ztl |title=Jerusalem &amp;ndash; Torah Chigri Sak! Hagaon Harav Nosson Tzvi Finkel, zt"l |date=8 November 2011 |accessdate=8 November 2011 |work=[[Vos Iz Neias?]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had one brother, Gedaliah, who now teaches at the Mir yeshiva. After his parents [[Aliah|immigrated]] to Israel in 1973,&lt;ref&gt;Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; his mother published a best-selling [[kosher]] cookbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d7CnIH_COcYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=sara+finkel&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=sara%20finkel&amp;f=false |title=Classic Kosher Cooking |last=Finkel |first=Sara |year=1989 |publisher=[[Targum Press]] |isbn= 0-944070-14-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reb Finkel grew up as a "typical American Jewish boy"&lt;ref name="vos"/&gt; who enjoyed playing basketball and baseball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2011/11/09/4792/ |title=R.

His great-uncle, Rabbi [[Eliezer Yehuda Finkel (Mir rosh yeshiva, Poland and Jerusalem)|Eliezer Yehuda Finkel]] ("Reb Leizer Yudel"), the Mir rosh yeshiva, recognized his ability to think clearly and have patience for studying, and asked his parents to let him stay and study in his yeshiva. Finkel remained at the Mir for eight months, studying with top-notch ''[[chavruta]]s'' (study partners) to develop his skills.&lt;ref&gt;Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), pp. 45&amp;ndash;47.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Chicago to take his secondary education at the [[Mixed-sex education#USA|co-ed]], [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] [[Ida Crown Jewish Academy]], where he was president of the [[student council]] and a starting centerfielder for the baseball team.&lt;ref name="haaretz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/anglo-file/rabbi-finkel-the-inspirational-yeshiva-head-who-grew-up-thoroughly-american-1.394912 |title=Rabbi Finkel, The Inspirational Yeshiva Head Who Grew Up Thoroughly American |first=Raphael |last=Ahren |date=11 November 2011 |accessdate=28 November 2011 |work=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 17, Finkel returned to Jerusalem to learn at the Mir under the guidance of his great-uncle.&lt;ref name="FinkelHeimowitz179"&gt;Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; He learned diligently for the next six years.&lt;ref name="hamodia"/&gt; With one of his ''chavrutas'', Rabbi [[Zundel Kroizer]], he completed the entire [[Talmud]] each year.&lt;ref name="hamodia"/&gt;

In the summer of 1964&lt;ref&gt;Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; Finkel married Reb Leizer Yudel's granddaughter, Leah, his second cousin and the eldest daughter of Rabbi [[Binyomin Beinush Finkel]], who was his father's first cousin.&lt;ref name="mish"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mishpacha.com/Browse/Article/1567/Special-Tribute-Edition-One-Father-Myriads-of-Orphans|title=Special Tribute Edition: One Father, Myriads of Orphans |last=Heimowitz |first=Rabbi Yehuda |date=9 November 2011 |accessdate=10 November 2011 |work=[[Mishpacha]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his wife had 11 children.&lt;ref name="hamodia"/&gt; He continued to learn with ''chavrutas'' at all hours, stopping at 2 a.m.;&lt;ref&gt;"''Sar V'gadol Nafal B' Yisrael'' (A Prince and Great Person Fell in Israel)". ''Hamodia'', 10 November 2011, p. C6.&lt;/ref&gt; his wife would bring their children to visit him at the yeshiva so he wouldn't have to take the time to walk home.&lt;ref name="donn"/&gt; He also began delivering ''shiurim'' in the yeshiva, which was headed by his father-in-law after the death of Reb Leizer Yudel in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the death of his father-in-law on 13 February 1990,&lt;ref&gt;Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; Finkel was named rosh yeshiva of the Mir&lt;ref name="Lakewood"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lakewoodlocal.com/2011/11/07/tefilos-needed-for-harav-nosson-tzvi-finkel/ |title= Boruch Dayan Haemes: Harav Nosson Tzvi Finkel |date=8 November 2011 |accessdate=8 November 2011 |work=Lakewood Local}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with Rabbi [[Refoel Shmuelevitz]] (son of former Mir rosh yeshiva Rabbi [[Chaim Leib Shmuelevitz]]). Finkel took on the financial responsibility for the yeshiva.

==Growth of the Mir==
[[File:The Mir Yeshiva Simchas Beis HaShoeivah in 2006.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel (center, in wheelchair) participates in a [[Simchat Beit HaShoeivah]] at the Mir in 2006.]]
When Reb Finkel first came to the Mir at the age of 17 in 1960, enrollment was less than 200 students, of which 75 percent were ''avreichim'' (married students) and 25 percent were undergraduates.&lt;ref name="finkel185"/&gt; When he became rosh yeshiva in 1990, enrollment stood at approximately 1,200 students.&lt;ref name="finkel185"&gt;Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, enrollment reached nearly 6,000 undergraduates&lt;ref name="vos"/&gt; and over 1,600 ''avreichim''.&lt;ref name="yated"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.yated.com/content.asp?contentid=495 |title=Inspiring a Generation |last=Lipschutz |first=Rabbi Pinchos |work=[[Yated Ne'eman (United States)|Yated Ne'eman]] |accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This growth is credited to Finkel's open-door policy as rosh yeshiva: whoever wished to learn at the Mir was welcome. Enrollment now includes Litvish, [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]], [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]], [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] and [[Baal teshuva|baalei teshuva]] students from Israel, the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name="hamodia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yated"/&gt;

To accommodate the ever-increasing enrollment, Finkel fund-raised for and constructed four new buildings in addition to the original yeshiva building constructed by Reb Leizer Yudel in 1949.&lt;ref name="FinkelHeimowitz179"/&gt; He assigned separate ''[[beth midrash|battei medrash]]'' (study halls) for each group of students, making one for Israeli students, one for Americans, one for those who wished to study without a daily ''shiur'', and so on. As enrollment continued to climb, several students of the main ''maggidei shiur'' (lecturers) began delivering ''shiurim'' in English, and Finkel raised the funds to open a new ''beis medrash'' in 2006 for these ''shiurim'' too. Yet another ''beis medrash'' was built in recent years.&lt;ref name="mish"/&gt; The Mir also opened a ''yeshiva gedola'' for Israeli students in the Brachfeld neighborhood of [[Modi'in Illit]]&lt;ref&gt;Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), pp. 345&amp;ndash;348.&lt;/ref&gt; where Finkel gave ''shiurim'' and occasional ''shmuessen'' ([[Musar movement|musar]] talks), and a ''yeshiva ketana'' in the [[Ramat Shlomo]] neighborhood of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="hamodia"/&gt;

In an unusual move for a Litvish yeshiva, Finkel accepted 800 [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] students and allowed them to learn in their own ''chabura'' and follow their own customs, including a ''fartug'' (pre-dawn study session) before morning prayers. This group, known as ''Chaburas Ameilim BaTorah'' (the "Toiling in Torah" Study Group), was housed in a different neighborhood, but the week before his death, Finkel moved them onto Mir yeshiva premises. He participated in their Thursday-night study sessions as well as their ''[[Seudat mitzvah#Seudat Siyum Masechet|seudot mitzvah]]'' (festival meals) marking a [[siyum]], and [[Hanukkah]] parties.&lt;ref name="hamodia"&gt;"Hagaon Harav Nosson Tzvi Finkel, ''zt"l: Leader of thousands, rebbi to each one". ''[[Hamodia]]'', 10 November 2011, pp. A20, A26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yated"/&gt;

Notwithstanding the Mir's huge enrollment, Finkel tried to remember the name of each student.&lt;ref name="funeral"/&gt; He also remembered personal details about each of his alumni and donors abroad. His brother-in-law, Rabbi Aharon Lopiansky, rosh yeshiva of the Yeshiva of Greater Washington, said that at Mir dinners, 1,000 people could be waiting to speak with the rosh yeshiva, "and almost every single one on the line was someone he had had a personal connection with".&lt;ref name="donn"/&gt;

Despite his busy schedule, Finkel also expressed a willingness to learn in ''chavruta'' with any student who asked. It was estimated that he studied with approximately 80 people every week.&lt;ref&gt;Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), pp. 277&amp;ndash;278, 281.&lt;/ref&gt; Like his great-uncle Reb Leizer Yudel, Finkel offered cash incentives for Torah study, challenging his students to learn many pages of Talmud and study for large blocks of time. He regularly hosted siyums for students in his own home and at his own expense.&lt;ref&gt;Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), pp. 258&amp;ndash;264.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finkel shouldered the responsibility for raising funds for this giant Torah enterprise. Despite his disease and its side effects, he traveled twice a year to England and the United States.&lt;ref name="hamodia"/&gt; In the past two years, the [[Late-2000s recession|economic recession]] saw the yeshiva's debts mounting quicker than they were being met, with salaries and [[kollel]] [[stipend]]s running months behind. Finkel was said to be very upset by this state of affairs.&lt;ref name="hamodia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="donn"/&gt;

==Illness==
Reb Finkel was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="mish"/&gt; Though he experienced much difficulty in walking and talking, and suffered from involuntary tremors and spasms and slurred speech, he continued to learn for hours every day and gave regular ''shiurim'' in the yeshiva, as well as embarked on regular fund-raising trips abroad.&lt;ref name="hamodia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lakewood"/&gt; In later years, when he felt too weak to sit in a chair during the ''chaburas'' (small-group learning sessions) that he organized for students in his home, he would lie down on a couch and encourage the students to begin the session.&lt;ref name="mish"/&gt; He refused to take medication for his condition, since the drugs could make his mind foggy or cause memory loss&lt;ref name="mish"/&gt; and he didn't want to risk forgetting his Torah studies.&lt;ref name="haaretz"/&gt; He only took medication that provided temporary relief from his symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
At 6 a.m. in his home on November 8, 2011 (11 [[Cheshvan]] 5772), Finkel suddenly lost consciousness. EMS personnel attempted to revive him for 50 minutes while students of the Mir stood outside in the street praying for him. His personal doctor summoned to the home determined that he had died of [[cardiac arrest]].&lt;ref name="hamodia"/&gt;

An estimated 100,000 people&lt;ref name="kol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="finkel448"&gt;Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), p. 448.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="levaya"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://matzav.com/100000-attend-levaya-of-rav-nosson-tzvi-finkel |title=Photos: 100,000 Attend Levaya of Rav Nosson Tzvi Finkel zt"l |date=8 November 2011 |accessdate=8 November 2011|publisher=matzav.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; attended his funeral, which began at the Mir yeshiva in [[Beit Yisrael]] and continued on foot to [[Har HaMenuchot]],&lt;ref name="hamodia"/&gt; where he was buried next to Rabbi Chaim Shmuelevitz, a former rosh yeshiva of the Mir,&lt;ref name="levaya"/&gt; and close by the graves of Reb Leizer Yudel and Rabbi Binyomin Beinish Finkel.&lt;ref name="finkel448"/&gt; The [[Edah HaChareidis]] ordered all [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] businesses to close during the funeral, and [[Lithuanian Jews|Litvishe]] Torah leaders Rabbi [[Yosef Shalom Eliashiv]] and [[Aharon Leib Shteinman]] instructed teachers and students of [[Talmud Torah]]s, yeshivas, and kollels to join the funeral procession.&lt;ref name="funeral"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vosizneias.com/94357/2011/11/08/jerusalem-tens-of-thousands-attend-levaya-of-r%E2%80%99-nosson-tzvi-finkel-zatzal-photos |title=Jerusalem &amp;ndash; Tens Of Thousands Attend Levaya of R’ Nosson Tzvi Finkel, Zatzal (photos) |work=Vos Iz Neias?|date=8 November 2011 |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kol"/&gt; The procession blocked the entrance to the city and halted operations of the [[Jerusalem Light Rail]], as tens of thousands of mourners blocked the tracks on the [[Jerusalem Chords Bridge]] en route to the cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/article.php?p=108357 |title=Mir Rosh Yeshiva’s Levaya Halts Jerusalem Light Rail |date=8 November 2011 |accessdate=28 November 2011 |work=[[Yeshiva World News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rav Finkel's death was a double blow for the Jerusalem Litvish yeshiva world, coming one day after the death of Rabbi [[Dov Schwartzman]], another respected Litvish rosh yeshiva in Jerusalem. Rabbi Finkel participated in Rabbi Schwartzman's funeral on 7 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sever |first=Yechiel |script-title=he:אלפים רבים בהלוויית הגאון הגדול רבי דב שוורצמן זצוק"ל |trans-title=Thousands at the Funeral of the Great Torah Genius Rabbi Dov Schwartzman |language=Hebrew|date=8 November 2011 |work=[[Yated Ne'eman (Israel)|Yated Ne'eman]]|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the funeral it was announced that Finkel's eldest son, Rabbi [[Eliezer Yehuda Finkel (Mir Jerusalem rosh yeshiva)|Eliezer Yehuda Finkel]], would succeed his father as rosh yeshiva.&lt;ref name="mish"/&gt;

[[File:SekienNuribotoke.jpg|thumb|right|Nuribotoke as illustrated by [[Toriyama Sekien]].]]
The {{Nihongo|'''Nuribotoke'''|塗仏}} is an animated corpse with darkened skin and dangling eyeballs in [[Japanese mythology]]. They are portrayed  with largely bloated stomachs and occasionally having a catfish's tail. They are believed to have revived due to poor care of the household shrine. However, due to interpretations that they possess a tail, it may be that the corpse is controlled by another being or be a [[yōkai]] in disguise. It will act like a messenger of the Buddha but give out false prophecies to fool worshipers. It is also believed to dance often, more so during the demons' night parade ([[Hyakki Yakō]]).

A '''payload specialist''' ('''PS''') is an individual selected and trained by commercial or research organizations for flights of a specific [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]] on a [[NASA]] [[Space Shuttle]] mission. People assigned as payload specialists included individuals selected by the research community, a company or consortium flying a commercial payload aboard the [[spacecraft]], and non-NASA [[astronauts]] designated by international partners.

The term refers to both the individual and to the position on the Shuttle crew.

==History==
{{main|Astronaut ranks and positions}}
Payload specialists were generally selected for a single specific mission and were chosen outside the standard NASA [[NASA Astronaut Corps|astronaut selection process]]. They were not required to be [[United States]] [[citizen]]s, but had to be approved by NASA and undergo rigorous training. In contrast, a Space Shuttle [[mission specialist]] was selected as a NASA [[astronaut|astronaut candidate]] first and then assigned to a mission.

Payload specialists on early missions were technical experts to accompany specific payloads such as a commercial or scientific satellite. On [[Spacelab]] and other missions with science components, payload specialists were scientists with expertise in specific experiments. The term also applied to representatives from partner nations who were given the opportunity of a first flight on board of the Space Shuttle (such as Saudi Arabia and Mexico), and to Congressmen and the Teacher in Space program.

Other positions on board Space Shuttle were [[commander|mission commander]], [[aviator|pilot]], and [[mission specialist]]. Unlike other Shuttle crew, international or scientific payload specialists were generally assigned a back-up who trained alongside the primary payload specialist and would replace him/her in the event of illness or other disability.

Payload specialists were flown from 1983 ([[STS-9]]) to 2003 ([[STS-107]]). The last flown payload specialist was the first [[Israelis|Israeli]] astronaut, [[Ilan Ramon]], who was killed in the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]] on mission STS-107 with the rest of the crew.

==Criticism==
NASA's payload specialist program has been criticized for giving limited Shuttle flight positions to civilian aerospace engineers such as [[Greg Jarvis]] (killed aboard ''[[Space shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]''), politicians such as [[US Representative]] [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]], and others civilians such as [[Teacher in Space Project|Teacher in Space]] [[Christa McAuliffe]] (also killed aboard ''Challenger''). Even the rationale for the Shuttle flight of former [[Mercury Seven|Mercury astronaut]] and US Senator [[John Glenn]] was questioned.&lt;ref name="Glenn"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oberg|first1=James|title=NASA hypes "Glenn Mission" Science|url=http://www.jamesoberg.com/glenn.html|website=jamesoberg.com|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concern was that these people had replaced career astronauts in very limited flight opportunities, and some may have flown without understanding the level of danger.

A 1986 post-''Challenger'' article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reviewed the issue, reporting that as far back as 1982, NASA was concerned with finding reasonable justifications for flying civilians on the Shuttle as was directed by the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration. The article says that "A review of records and interviews with past and present NASA and government officials shows the civilian program's controversial background, with different groups pushing for different approaches."&lt;ref name = Post/&gt; The article concludes with:

{{quote|text=Author [[Tom Wolfe]], who chronicled the early days of the space program in ''[[The Right Stuff (book)|The Right Stuff]],'' wrote after the ''Challenger'' explosion that support for the citizen program, and therefore McAuliffe's place aboard the ill-fated shuttle, was part of an insiders' battle. NASA civilians, pitting themselves against the professional astronauts, used the program for the "dismantling of Astropower," which Wolfe described as "the political grip the original breed of [[Fighter pilot|fighter-pilot]] [[Test pilot|test-pilot]] astronauts had on NASA."&lt;ref name = Post&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pincus|first1=Walter|authorlink1=Walter Pincus|title=NASA's Push to Put Citizen in Space Overtook Fully 'Operational' Shuttle|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1986/03/05/nasas-push-to-put-citizen-in-space-overtook-fully-operational-shuttle/29fe2714-39b7-40dd-b15e-073441de636e/|website=Washingtonpost.com|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Ramzan Akhmadovich Kadyrov''' ({{lang-rus|Рамза́н Ахма́тович Кады́ров|p=rɐˈmzan ɐxˈmatəvʲɪtɕ kɐˈdɨrəf}}, {{lang-ce|Къадар Ахьмат-кIант Рамзан}} ''Q̇adar Aẋmat-khant Ramzan''; born 5 October 1976) is the [[Head of the Chechen Republic]] and a former member of the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Chechen independence]] movement.

He is the son of former Chechen President [[Akhmad Kadyrov]], who was assassinated in May 2004. In February 2007, Kadyrov replaced [[Alu Alkhanov]] as President, shortly after he had turned 30, which is the minimum age for the post. He was engaged in [[Sulim Yamadaev–Ramzan Kadyrov power struggle|violent power struggles]] with Chechen government [[warlord]]s [[Sulim Yamadayev]] and [[Said-Magomed Kakiyev]] for overall military authority, and with Alkhanov for political authority.

Ramzan Kadyrov is an honorary member of the [[Russian Academy of Natural Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Люпхъ Лярхякюбяйюъ|url=http://lenta.ru/articles/2006/01/19/ramsan/ |title=Йюбйюг: Юйюделхй, Гюыхрмхй Х Опнярн Бнкьеамхй|publisher=Lenta|date=19 January 2006|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the Akhmat Fight Club and established an international annual freestyle wrestling tournament called the Ramzan Kadyrov &amp; [[Adlan Varayev]] Cup.

==Biography==

===Early life and militia leader===
{{See also|Kadyrovtsy}}
[[File:Vladimir Putin 18 January 2001-3.jpg|thumb|[[Akhmad Kadyrov]], formerly a leading separatist [[mufti]], had switched sides in 2000]]
He was born in [[Tsentaroy]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. He was the second son in Akhmat and Aimani Kadyrovs' family and their youngest child. He had an elder brother called Zelimkhan (1974 – 31 May 2004), and he has two elder sisters, Zargan (born 1971) and Zulay (born 1972). Kadyrov strove to gain the respect of his father, Akhmad Kadyrov, who was an [[imam]]. He claims that he always emulated his father. Akhmad had supported the call for [[jihad]] against Russians during the [[First Chechen War]] but switched sides and declared allegiance to Russia in the [[Second Chechen War]].&lt;ref name=BBCCZECH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/czech/worldnews/story/2005/09/050916_chechnya_tyson_0730.shtml|title=BBCCzech.com - Svět - Bývalý šampion Mike Tyson v Čečensku zahájil turnaj v boxu|website=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/08/putins-dragon|title=The Putin of Chechnya|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, as the Soviet Union dissolved, the Chechens launched [[First Chechen War|a bid for independence]].

During the [[First Chechen War]], together with his [[Akhmad Kadyrov|father]], he fought against Russian armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lenta.ru/lib/14161090/full.htm|title=Lenta.ru: Кадыров, Рамзан|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Ramzan was the personal driver and bodyguard of his father Akhmad, who became the separatist [[mufti]] of Chechnya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ria.ru/spravka/20070216/60825494.html|title=Рамзан Кадыров. Биография|work=РИА Новости|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kadyrovtsy militia was formed during the First Chechen War when [[Akhmad Kadyrov]] launched the jihad against Russia.

The Kadyrov clan [[defection|defected]] to the Moscow side at the beginning of the [[Second Chechen War]] in 1999. Since then, Kadyrov led his [[militia]] with support from Russia's [[FSB (Russia)|FSB]] [[state security]] service (including service [[ID card]]s) becoming the head of the Chechen [[Presidential Security Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sputniknews.com/onlinenews/2004051039915857/|title=SON OF ASSASSINATED PRESIDENT OF CHECHNYA APPOINTED FIRST DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER|first=|last=Sputnik|website=sputniknews.com|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The militia later became known as the [[Kadyrovites]].

Ramzan Kadyrov was falsely rumoured to have died of a [[gunshot]] wound inflicted by his [[bodyguard]] on 28 April 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kavkaz.tv/eng/content/2004/04/30/2725.shtml Discrepant reports about Kadyrov, Jr. – Kavkazcenter.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903154228/http://www.kavkaz.tv/eng/content/2004/04/30/2725.shtml |date=3 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deputy Prime Minister===
[[File:AlkhanovPutinKadyrov.JPG|thumb|right|From left to right: President [[Alu Alkhanov]], Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]], and Kadyrov at the first session of the Chechen Parliament in December 2005.]]
After his father, then President, was assassinated on 9 May 2004, Ramzan was appointed as the First [[Deputy Prime Minister]] of the [[Chechen Republic]] on 10 May 2004.&lt;ref name=Pravda&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pravdareport.com/hotspots/conflicts/10-05-2004/5518-kadyrovramzan-0/|title=Ramzan Kadyrov- Chechnya's first deputy prime minister|publisher=Pravda Report|date=10 May 2004|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When his sister was detained by the [[Dagestan]] police in January 2005, Ramzan and some 150 armed men drove to the [[Khasavyurt]] City Police (GOVD) building. According to the city [[mayor]], Kadyrov's men surrounded the GOVD, forcing its duty officers against a wall, and assaulted them, after which they left the building with Zulay Kadyrova, "victoriously shooting in the air."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=409&amp;&amp;issue_id=3195 |title=RAMZAN FREES HIS SISTER… |author=Anon |journal=Chechnya Weekly |volume=6 |issue=2 |date=13 January 2005 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210092947/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=409&amp;&amp;issue_id=3195 |archivedate=10 December 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, Ramzan declared that "[[Akhmad Kadyrov Mosque|Europe's largest mosque]]" would be built in place of the demolished ruins of [[Grozny]]'s shattered [[downtown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/chechnya/Story/0,,1542119,00.html|work=The Guardian| location=London|title=Biggest mosque for Grozny|date=4 August 2005|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that Chechnya is the "most peaceful place in Russia" and in a few years it would also be "the wealthiest and the most peaceful" place in the world. He said that the war was already over with only 150 "bandits" remaining (as opposed to the official figures of 700 to 2,000 [[Rebellion|rebel]] fighters), and that thanks to his father, 7,000 separatists had already defected to the Russian side since 1999. When responding to a question on how he is going to "avenge the murder of his father", Ramzan said:
{{Quotation|1=I've already killed him, whom I ought to kill. And those, who stay behind him, I will be killing them, to the very last of them, until I am myself killed or jailed. I will be killing [them] for as long as I live... Putin is gorgeous. He thinks more about Chechnya than about any other republic [of the Russian Federation]. When my father was murdered, he [Putin] came and went to the cemetery in person. Putin has stopped the war. Putin should be made president for life. Strong rule is needed. Democracy is all but an American fabrication... Russians never obey their laws. Everyone was stealing, and only [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky|Khodorkovsky]] is in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grani.ru/War/Chechnya/m.120334.html|title=Грани.Ру:  Кадыров официально вступил в должность президента Чечни – Война / Чечня|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Original Russian text: Того, кого я должен был убить, я уже убил.

He remained the First Deputy Prime Minister until November 2005.&lt;ref name="Chechnya.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chechnya.gov.ru/page.php?r=2|title=Кадыров Рамзан Ахматович|publisher=Chechnya Government|accessdate=26 November 2016|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting Prime Minister===

Following a [[car accident]] in November 2005, in which Chechnya's prime minister [[Sergey Abramov (politician)|Sergey Abramov]] was injured, Ramzan was appointed as the [[caretaker government#Caretakers|caretaker]] prime minister on 18 November 2005. He immediately proceeded to implement elements of [[Sharia]] law, such as declaring a ban on [[gambling]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] production.&lt;ref name="The Jamestown Foundation"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=416&amp;issue_id=3656 |title=RAMZAN – VIDEO STAR? |author=Anon |journal=Chechnya Weekly |volume=7 |issue=11 |date=16 March 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506070231/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=416&amp;issue_id=3656 |archivedate=6 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/627875|title=Временно неисполняющий обязанности|date=19 November 2005|publisher=[[Komersant]]|accessdate=2013-04-20|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GDCbyH2v?url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/627875|archivedate=2013-04-28|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, responding to the publication of the [[Mohammed cartoons]], he accused the [[Danish people|Danes]] of "spying" and being "pro-terrorist". He also banned Danish [[Danish citizenship|citizens]] from entering Chechnya, effectively banning activity of the [[Danish Refugee Council]], the largest [[NGO]] working in the region. Kadyrov is quoted as saying, "That cartoonist needs to be buried alive." He was eventually pressed to overturn this decision by [[Moscow]], a rare example of federal [[Interventionism (politics)|intervention]] in Kadyrov's rule in the republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=416&amp;issue_id=3616&amp;article_id=2370761 |title=RAMZAN BANS ALL THINGS DANISH |author=Anon |journal=Chechnya Weekly |volume=7 |issue=6 |date=9 February 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121005046/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=416&amp;issue_id=3616&amp;article_id=2370761 |archivedate=21 November 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prime Minister===
On 1 March 2006, [[Sergey Abramov (politician)|Sergey Abramov]] resigned from the position of prime minister and told [[Itar-Tass]] news agency that he did so "on the condition that Ramzan Kadyrov lead the Chechen government." This was followed by a decree of Kadyrov [[Islam and clothing|forcing women to wear]] [[hijab|headscarves]]; he also rejected a federal appropriation of the republic's budget, demanding more money, and called for all federal forces but the [[border guard]]s to be withdrawn.

Kadyrov was appointed as the Prime Minister of the Chechen Republic by Alkhanov on 4 March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.1tv.ru/news/2006/03/04/222789-ramzan_kadyrov_naznachen_premierom_chechenskoy_respubliki|title=Рамзан Кадыров назначен премьером Чеченской республики|publisher=Channel One Russia|date=4 March 2006|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after taking office, Kadyrov approved a project to erect a [[presidential palace]] on a {{convert|30|acre|m2|adj=on}} plot by the [[Sunzha River]] in ruined downtown Grozny. The project, which was also to include a five-star hotel and recreational facilities, was estimated to cost around 1.5 billion [[Russian ruble|ruble]]s ($54 million [[USD]]) to build. Later, Kadyrov called for [[refugee camps]] scattered across Chechnya to be closed down, calling the refugees "international spies who are interested in stoking conflict between Chechnya and Russia, who are seeking to destabilise the situation in our region". [[Reuters]] quoted him as saying that "liquidating the refugee camps will allow us to uncover spies who are working for foreign [[intelligence service]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=416&amp;issue_id=3706&amp;article_id=2371029 |title=KADYROV FINDS FIFTH COLUMN AMONG DISPLACED CHECHENS |author=Anon |journal=Chechnya Weekly |volume=7 |issue=17 |date=27 April 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930190012/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=416&amp;issue_id=3706&amp;article_id=2371029 |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; His cousin Odes Baysultanov was appointed to the position of First Deputy Prime Minister by Alkhanov on 6 March 2006 after being unanimously approved by the Chechen Parliament.&lt;ref name="Chechnya.gov2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=OdesRegnum&gt;{{cite web|url=https://regnum.ru/news/810079.html|title=Кадыров предложил кандидатуру Одеса Байсултанова на пост премьера Чечни|publisher=REGNUM News Agency|date=10 April 2007|accessdate=26 November 2016|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 2006, Speaker of the Chechen [[People's Assembly (Chechnya)|People's Assembly]] [[Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov]] said at a [[press conference]] in Moscow that "there is no alternative" to Kadyrov for the [[presidency]]; Kadyrov has "exclusive awards in combat, and has made achievements in improving the peaceful life and in [[human rights]] protection. Who could replace him at this stage? Nobody," he said. Later that year, [[Umar Dzhabrailov]], Chechnya's representative in the [[Federation Council]] and a close ally of Kadyrov's, urged Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov to initiate a measure calling on Kadyrov to become the republic's president, thereby replacing Alu Alkhanov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=416&amp;issue_id=3919&amp;article_id=2371634 |title=UMAR DZHABRAILOV WANTS KADYROV TO REPLACE ALKHANOV |author=Anon |journal=Chechnya Weekly |volume=7 |issue=43 |date=9 November 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930190039/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=416&amp;issue_id=3919&amp;article_id=2371634 |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, several Russian newspapers reported that a worsening security situation in Chechnya was lessening the likelihood that Kadyrov would replace Alu Alkhanov as the republic's president. Other media, however, reported that Kadyrov continued to strengthen his position at Alkhanov's expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=416&amp;issue_id=3926&amp;article_id=2371653 |title=KADYROV VS.

On 6 December 2006, Kadyrov said he that he would seek the [[prosecution]] of the commanders of federal military units responsible for the death or disappearance of civilians in Chechnya (specifically [[Major General]] [[Aleksandr Studenikin]]). In addition, Kadyrov said the war in Chechnya was unleashed not by the Chechen people but by the Russian leadership. Kadyrov's comments may have represented his government's increasing unhappiness with certain figures in Moscow, who were said to be blocking his elevation to the post of Chechen president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=416&amp;issue_id=3948&amp;article_id=2371717 |title=KADYROV VOWS TO PROSECUTE FEDERAL COMMANDERS FOR ABUSES |author=Anon |journal=Chechnya Weekly |volume=7 |issue=47 |date=7 December 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202845/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=416&amp;issue_id=3948&amp;article_id=2371717 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, leaked cables from an American diplomat recounted a lavish wedding attended by Kadyrov in Russia's Caucasus region in which guests threw $100 bills at child dancers, and which had nighttime "water-scooter jaunts on the [[Caspian Sea]]", and a report that Ramzan Kadyrov gave the newly married couple a "five-kilo lump of gold".&lt;ref name=twsDecZ16bb2&gt;{{cite news|author= Scott Shane and Andrew W.

On 5 February 2007, Kadyrov said he did not aspire to become the Chechen president; however, he criticised Alkhanov. Kadyrov also claimed the [[First Chechen War|war in Chechnya]] was ultimately finished, with "all informal armed groups eliminated". Alkhanov, for his part, criticised "the cult of personality and idealisation of one person", a clear reference to Kadyrov, whose enormous portraits are prominently displayed in Grozny.

On 15 February 2007, Putin signed a decree removing Alkhanov and installing Kadyrov as Chechen's [[acting president]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,252203,00.html|publisher=Fox News Channel|title=Putin Dismisses Chechen President, Puts Prime Minister in Charge|date=15 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 March 2007, following Putin's nomination of Kadyrov as Chechen president, the Chechen parliament approved the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regnum.ru/english/790563.html Chechen parliament votes for appointing Ramzan Kadyrov as president – Russian News – REGNUM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903140300/http://www.regnum.ru/english/790563.html |date=3 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following days, serious changes took place in the administrative setup of the republic, affecting both the top- and middle-ranking officials. Former deputy prime minister [[Odes Baysultanov]] (a cousin of Kadyrov) was elevated to the vacant post of prime minister. Critics allege that Ramzan Kadyrov is actively building his own "vertical of power" in the republic, and encouraging nepotism by placing men of the [[Beno clan]] in all the leading and important positions.

A Russian daily, ''[[Gazeta.ru|Gazeta]]'', reported that according to a poll conducted by the independent [[Levada Center]], only 33 percent of Russians believe that Ramzan Kadyrov can be trusted, while 35 percent believed that he cannot. Asked whether they thought Kadyrov could normalise the situation in Chechnya and end the bloodshed there, 31 percent said yes and 38 percent said no.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=421&amp;issue_id=4037&amp;article_id=2372009 |title=POLL FINDS A PLURALITY OF RUSSIANS DISTRUST RAMZAN |author=Anon |journal=Chechnya Weekly |volume=8 |issue=11 |date=15 March 2007 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520043841/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=421&amp;issue_id=4037&amp;article_id=2372009 |archivedate=20 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 March 2007, Kadyrov said that human rights abuses were "a thing of the past" in his republic, rejecting new charges of torture made by the [[Council of Europe]]. Two days later he accused the federal authorities of torturing detainees. On 19 March 2007, Kadyrov vowed to put an end to all remaining guerilla activity in Chechnya within two months. On 5 April 2007, Kadyrov was sworn in as President of Chechnya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/04/05/europe/EU-GEN-Russia-Chechnya.php "Kadyrov sworn in as Chechnya's new Kremlin-backed president"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125155033/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/04/05/europe/EU-GEN-Russia-Chechnya.php |date=25 January 2009 }}, Associated Press (''International Herald Tribune''), 5 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He appointed his maternal cousin Odes Baysultanov as the Prime Minister of the republic on 10 April.&lt;ref name=OdesRegnum/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cacianalyst.org/resources/pdf/issues/20070418Analyst.pdf|title=Central Asia-Caucasus Analyst|publisher=[[Central Asia-Cacusus Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the car-bomb attack on [[Yunus-bek Yevkurov]], president of the neighbouring [[Republic of Ingushetia]] on 22 June 2009, Kadyrov claimed that the Kremlin had ordered him to fight insurgents there, and during his subsequent visit to the republic on 24 June pledged ruthless vengeance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSLO672371|agency=Reuters|title=Russia's Kadyrov vows revenge for Ingushetia bombing|date=24 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late December 2009, Kadyrov claimed that remaining rebels were getting financed by "The West"; "I officially declare this: those who destroyed the [[Soviet Union]], those who want to destroy the [[Russian Federation]], they stand behind them". He also suggested that Russia should attack [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Ukraine]] "It's Russia's private affliction; why should we always suffer if we can eradicate this for good?".&lt;ref name=Interv&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/6858882/Chechen-president-says-the-West-wants-to-destroy-Russia.html Chechen President Says the West Wants to Destroy Russia ], The Telegraph, (21 December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In early August 2010, Kadyrov had claimed that there were only 70 Islamist militants left in Chechnya.&lt;ref name="hide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Kadyrov_Is_Warned_You_Can_Run_But_You_Cant_Hide/2141433.html |title=Kadyrov Is Warned: 'You Can Run, But You Can't Hide' |publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty: Caucasus Report |date=30 August 2010 |accessdate=27 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60Ui0mu1G?url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Kadyrov_Is_Warned_You_Can_Run_But_You_Cant_Hide/2141433.html |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, he proposed changing the title of ''President of the Chechen Republic'' to ''Head of the Chechen Republic''. On 12 August, he also called upon presidents of all [[North Caucasus]] republics to petition the [[State Duma]] to change their titles, stating that there should only be one president in Russia. The Chechen parliament unanimously approved this change on 2 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chechnya's Kadyrov given title 'head of republic,' not president |publisher=Sputnik News |date=2 September 2010 |accessdate=24 November 2016|url=https://sputniknews.com/russia/20100902160441578/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Speaker of the Chechen Parliament Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov stated on the next day that the title will be retained until the end of Kadyrov's term in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kadyrov will remain president until April 2011 |publisher=Lenta.ru |date=3 September 2010 |accessdate=24 November 2016|url=https://www.lenta.ru/news/2010/09/03/president/|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, he invited the players of Brazil's [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] winning team to play a match against a Chechen football team led by Kadyrov. The Brazilian team was named as Brazil XI. In addition, [[Ruud Gullit]] was hired by Kadyrov to train [[FC Terek Grozny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/17/chechnya-v-brazil-ramzan-kadyrov-football-coup|title=Chechnya v Brazil?

====Attempts at consolidation of the Chechen nation====

As reported by the [[Caucasian Knot]], an independent human rights resource, on 5 February 2009, "in the course of his meeting in Grozny with Ramzan Ampukaev, representative of the Chechen Diaspora in Europe, Ramzan Kadyrov invited former militants, now living in Europe, to come back home":

:"Now, the situation in the republic has stabilized, we witness a steady economic growth, and there's no sense for people to leave. And those who are already abroad, can always come back. We'll help them in every possible way," said Mr.&amp;nbsp;Kadyrov. "All sorts of Emirs and former participants of illegal armed formations, who are now in Europe and whose actions were not aggravated by bloody crimes, have two alternatives: either to come back and serve for the welfare of their homeland, or stay there until the end of their days."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.kavkaz-uzel.eu/articles/9279 |title=President of Chechnya calls former militants back home from Europe |last1=Ibragimov |first1=Muslim |date=6 February 2009 |website=kavkaz-uzel.eu |publisher= |access-date=22 August 2016 |quote=source CK correspondent; redirected from eng.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/9279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tsentoroy and Chechen Parliament attacks====

In 2010, two large scale attacks were carried out by Chechen insurgents, one in Kadyrov's home-village Tsentoroy and the other on Chechen Parliament in Grozny.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/Chechen_Commanders_Rebel_Against_Umarov/2127053.html "Chechen Commanders Rebel Against Umarov"], [[RFE/RL]], 13 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,RUS,,4cb2a7282,0.html "Chechen Rebel Field Commanders Renounced Loyalty Oath to Doku Umarov"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016214516/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2C%2C%2CRUS%2C%2C4cb2a7282%2C0.html |date=16 October 2012 }}. Eurasia Daily Monitor, Volume 7, Issue 182. [[Jamestown Foundation]], 8 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2010 Tsentoroy attack|assault on Tsentoroy]] which occurred on 29 August is considered to have "shattered" the image of Kadyrov's unshakeable rule in Chechnya, as it was the first time in six years that his seemingly impregnable village had come under attack.&lt;ref name="hide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shattered"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache%3D1%26tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D%3D36791%26tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D%3D13%26cHash%3D33195d931e |archive-url= https://www.webcitation.org/60Uj4jm24?url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=36791&amp;tx_ttnews%5bbackPid%5d=13&amp;cHash=33195d931e |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 27 July 2011 |title= Attack on Kadyrov’s Home Village Damages Chechnya’s Image of Stability |publisher= Eurasia Daily Monitor Volume: 7 Issue: 159 |date= 7 September 2010 |accessdate= 27 July 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 September, Ramzan Kadyrov announced a reward of more than $300,000 for information about each of the insurgency leaders involved in the operation, which Chechen commentators interpreted as an indicator of the government's weakness. Kadyrov also tightened his control over information coming from Tsentoroy by not allowing any of the village's 5,000 inhabitants to leave in the days after the attack; the citizenry were also allegedly under the threat of death not to talk about the siege or the damage inflicted by the rebels.&lt;ref name="shattered"/&gt; The [[2010 Chechen Parliament attack|attack on the Chechen parliament]] was carried out by three Chechen rebels on 19 October 2010.&lt;ref name="rian1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20101019/161007096.html|title=Terrorists launch deadly attack on Chechen parliament (Update 1)|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|date=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kadyrov dressed in a parade uniform attended a meeting that was held a few hours after all the buildings of the parliament were declared cleared by the special forces. During the meeting, he apologised to the politicians who escaped unhurt from the attack. Kadyrov vowed to intensify the fight against militants in the republic, calling them "bandits". He also blamed the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Poland]] saying they were "harbouring criminals. Why do they shield bandits who have shed blood where there is western democracy? Where is the justice? ... Sooner or later Zakayev, [[Khuseyn Gakayev|Gakayev]], [[Dokka Umarov|Umarov]], [[Aslambek Vadalov|Vadalov]] and other criminals will get what they deserve ... I have no doubt that it was the drunk and alcoholic [[Akhmed Zakayev]] and his backers in [[London]] and other western capitals. I want to say that they will not achieve anything. The Chechen republic is still standing. It is a peaceful and stable region."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=1525306&amp;NodesID=6 Чеченские боевики прошли в парламент], ''[[Kommersant]]'', 20 October 2010. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Washington, Tom.

===Head of the Chechen Republic===
[[File:Ramzan Kadyrov, 2014.jpeg|thumb|Kadyrov in 2014]]

Kadyrov was nominated by [[Russian President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] on 28 February 2011 and was unanimously elected for a second term by the Chechen Parliament on 5 March 2011. After his election, he stated that he was going to continue the current course of reviving the republic's economy and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/politics/kadyrov-chechnya-second-term/|title=Kadyrov pledges to "stay the course" during his second term|publisher=RT|date=5 March 2011|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 March, he captained a Chechen football team which included current players of FC Terek Grozny, former players of [[Soviet Union national football team]] and former German midfielder [[Lothar Matthaeus]] in a match against the team Brazil XI which included ex-Brazilian footballers like [[Romario]], [[Dunga]], [[Bebeto]] and [[Cafu]]. Kadyrov scored twice during the match but his team lost 6–4 to the Brazilian side. Kadyrov said that he had organised the match to show that Chechnya had recovered from years of separatist conflict. He also said that the Brazilians weren't paid to appear but came out of goodwill and in return for a donation to flood victims in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-12679028|title=Former Brazil stars in Chechnya for controversial game|publisher=BBC|date=5 March 2011|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kadyrov was sworn in as head of the republic on 5 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist//RTV/2011/04/06/RTV1017511/?v=2 |title=RUSSIA: Kremlin-backed Kadyrov is inaugurated President of Chechnya for second term |publisher=ITN Source |date=6 April 2011 |accessdate=2 August 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719185651/http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist//ITN/1971/01/16/FS160171067/ |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2012, he visited [[Azerbaijan]] to sign intergovernmental agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.az/en/news/182588|title=APA – Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov pays official visit to Azerbaijan|last1=Dementeva|first1=Victoria|publisher=Azerbaijan News Agency|date=15 November 2012|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, he ordered the closure of the newspaper ''Kadyrov's Path'' after one of its reporters asked Putin a question about the violence once focused in Chechnya spreading to other republics and followed it up by asking about the fate of a local radio station. Kadyrov had reportedly taken a disliking to the question asked by the reporter to Putin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/20/chechnyan-newspaper-shut-down-putin|title=Chechen newspaper shut down after reporter asks Putin a question|last1=Elder|first1=Miriam|publisher=The Guardian|date=20 December 2012|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kadyrov termed former [[Ukrainian President]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]]'s ouster as a "coup d'etat" and a deliberate attempt to exert pressure on Russia through Ukraine, however at the same time placed the blame on Yanukovych for the situation in Ukraine. On 28 February 2014, he affirmed his readiness to dispatch peacekeepers and a consignment of humanitarian aid to [[Crimea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/kadyrov-offers-crimea-aid/25281734.html|title=Chechen Leader Ready to Send Peacekeepers, Humanitarian Aid To Crimea|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=1 March 2014|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[2014 Grozny bombing]], in which ISIL's hand was suspected, he said that he might block internet in Chechnya as anyone could easily find and listen to a sermon by a jihadist. After Kadyrov went on a tirade against ISIL on Instagram for threatening Russia, ISIL commander [[Omar al-Shishani]] put a $5 million bounty on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/article/ramzan-kadyrov-the-chechen-leader-with-a-5m-islamic-state-bounty-on-his-head|title=Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen Leader With a $5M Islamic State Bounty on his Head|last1=Luhn|first1=Alec|publisher=Vice News|date=22 October 2014|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 May 2015, he announced that he was going to star in a Hollywood thriller titled ''Whoever Doesn't Understand Will Get It'' which will be directed by a director of famous Hollywood films and also feature global film-stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2015/05/26/chechen-warlord-ramzan-kadyrov-movie-star/|title=Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov reinvents himself as action movie star|last1=Miller|first1=Christopher|publisher=Mashable|date=26 May 2015|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/26/chechen-leader-hollywood-ramzan-kadyrov|title=Chechen leader to star in two films – one Hollywood, one human rights exposé|last1=Amos|first1=Howard|publisher=The Guardian|date=26 May 2015|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kadyrov in July 2015 denied that ISIL had any territory in Chechnya and claimed that they never will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/chechnya-kadyrov-islamic-state/27130881.html|title=Kadyrov: 'There Won't Even Be A Whiff Of IS In Chechnya'|last1=Paraszcuk|first1=Joanna|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=16 July 2015|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an interview in October 2015, he suggested that Putin should send Chechen special forces to Syria claiming they will wipe out ISIL in weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/02/putin-should-unleash-chechen-troops-on-isis-says-regions-president|title=Putin should unleash Chechen troops on Isis, says region's president|last1=Walker|first1=Shaun|publisher=The Guardian|date=2 October 2015|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 December, he promised revenge against ISIL for beheading of Magomed Khasiev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ramzan-kadyrov-chechen-leader-promises-revenge-isis-after-russian-citizen-beheaded-1531743|title=Ramzan Kadyrov: Chechen leader promises revenge on Isis after Russian citizen beheaded|last1=William|first1=Watkinson|publisher=International Business Times|date=3 December 2015|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 February 2016, he claimed that Chechen special forces had infiltrated ISIL cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/war-isis-chechnya-leader-ramzan-kadyrov-claims-his-special-forces-are-ground-syria-1542593|title=War on Isis: Chechnya leader Ramzan Kadyrov claims his special forces are on the ground in Syria|last1=Cole|first1=Brendan|publisher=International Business Times|date=8 February 2016|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kadyrov announced on 27 February 2016 that he would step down at the end of his second term, which was set to expire on 5 April. However, he later decided to run in the elections that were to be held that September. Putin appointed him as the acting head of Chechnya until the elections in a decree signed on 25 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/thousands-march-in-moscow-to-mark-anniversary-of-boris-nemtsov-murder-1456589495|title=Chechen Leader Ramzan Kadyrov Says He’s Ready to Step Down|last1=Marson|first1=James|last2=Sonne|first2=Paul|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=27 February 2016|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/kadyrov-gets-putins-support-will-run-in-elections/563731.html|title=Kadyrov Gets Putin's Support, Will Run in Elections|last1=Evdokimova|first1=Maria|publisher=The Moscow Times|date=25 March 2016|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held a meeting with Saudi prince [[Mohammed bin Salman]]'s deputy Ahmed al-Khatib on 8 May relating to Saudi Arabia investing in projects in Chechnya and declared that relations between Russia and Saudi Arabia were at an "all-time high".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/business/342374-chechnya-saudi-arabia-investment/|title=Saudi Arabia to invest in Russia’s Chechnya – Kadyrov|publisher=RT|date=9 May 2016|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kadyrov launched his reality show titled ''[[The Team (reality show)|The Team]]'' with the first episode being aired by [[Channel One Russia|Channel One]] on 30 June. People from across Russia were invited by Kadyrov to register for the contest. The winner of the contest will go on to become head of Chechnya's Agency for Strategic Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/01/chechen-hardman-ramzan-kadyrov-seeks-apprentice-in-new-televisio/|title=Chechen hardman Ramzan Kadyrov seeks 'apprentice' in new television show|publisher=Telegraph|date=1 July 2016|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/chechen-leader-ramzan-kadyrov-launches-apprentice-style-reality/story?id=40249956|title=Chechen Leader Launches 'Apprentice'-Style Search for Assistant|publisher=ABC News|date=30 June 2016|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chechen economic recovery and reconstruction ==
[[File:Grozny PB040082 2430.jpg|thumb|250px|Chechen capital Grozny in 2016]]
In 2006, the production of Chechnya's industry increased by 11.9%.&lt;ref name="Rosstat 2006-2007 Economic Growth"&gt;[http://www.gks.ru/dbscripts/Cbsd/DBInet.cgi?pl=7000002 "Темп роста валового регионального продукта к предыдущему году, процент".] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091203133241/http://www.gks.ru/dbscripts/Cbsd/DBInet.cgi?pl=7000002 |date=3 December 2009 }} Rosstat.

In February 2010, head of the British delegation of the Human Rights Group [[Lord Judd]], formerly "bitterly critical of the Russian authorities for the situation in Chechnya", pointed out a striking change for the better in the Russian North Caucasus republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2010/02/17/4502831.html|title=Lord Judd sees striking change for the better in Chechnya|publisher=RUVR|date=17 February 2010|access-date=20 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401192956/http://english.ruvr.ru/2010/02/17/4502831.html|archive-date=1 April 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judd said that changes which occurred since his visit as a member of PACE delegation in 2000 were "so overwhelming that sometimes you forget about what happened here until quite recently".

According to a 2016 report by Russian opposition leader [[Ilya Yashin]], Kadyrov collected enormous wealth, primarily through theft of federal subsidies for Chechnya. Between 2001 and 2014 Chechnya has received over 464 billion roubles in subsidies, grants and donations with federal subsidies accounting for 80% of the republic's budget (and this does not include funds allocated for infrastructure managed at federal level such as roads). However, the administration of Chechnya is being criticized for spending public funds for their personal benefit—in 2010 [[Dmitry Medvedev]] noted that "federal funds often do not reach people; we know where they disappear; it is obvious-they are being stolen". For example, the fleet of official vehicles in Chechnya accounts for half of all official vehicles in all Northern Caucasus republics. Public funds are being funnelled through [[Akhmad Kadyrov Foundation]], which—while being registered as a charity—has never produced or published any financial reports as required by Russian law. These violations are ignored by [[Ministry of Justice (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Justice]], which in many cases has enforced them very strictly against other charities. The foundation operates a building company that services most of the publicly procured infrastructure projects in the republic and also collects a fee from all working citizens of Chechnya, ranging from 10 to 30% of their earnings, raising 3–4 billion roubles per year this way. Kadyrov himself declares annual income of 4.84 million roubles (2015), which is inconsistent with his lavish life-style, luxury vehicles, watches, race horses and mansions.&lt;ref name="Yashin2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.4freerussia.org/a-threat-to-national-security-download-the-english-ver/ |title=A Threat to National Security |accessdate=1 March 2016 |author=Yashin, Ilya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2009 assassination attempt ==
An assassination attempt on Kadyrov and a parliament member [[Adam Delimkhanov]] was averted on 23 October 2009, by the police. Chechen Deputy interior minister [[Roman Edilov]] said the police shot dead the driver of a speeding car loaded with a 200-litre tank after firing warning shots shortly before Kadyrov was to arrive at a construction site. The driver of the car was later identified as a militant leader (so-called [[Urus-Martan]] [[emir]] [[Beslan Bashtayev]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20091023/156570480.html Chechnya says assassination attempt on Kadyrov averted].

== Accusations of human rights abuses ==
[[File:Глава Чеченской Республики, Герой России Рамзан Ахматович Кадыров вручает Председателю Парламента Чечни Магомед Даудов.jpg|thumb|Kadyrov with Chechnya's parliamentary chairman [[Magomed Daudov]] in June 2016]]
Kadyrov has been personally implicated in several instances of [[torture]] and [[murder]]. A number of Chechens opposed to Kadyrov have been assassinated abroad, and several witnesses (including Artur Kurmakaev and Ruslan Khalidov) report the existence of a 300 name "Murder List". Chechens who have been murdered, where Kadyrov's involvement is suspected, include [[Movladi Baisarov]] and [[Ruslan Yamadaev]] (both Moscow); [[Sulim Yamadaev]] (Dubai); Gazhi Edilsutanov, Islam Dzahnibekov, Ali Osaev (Istanbul); and [[Umar Israilov]] (Vienna).&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Tony (14 May 2009). [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n09/wood03_.html "The Murder List"]. ''[[London Review of Books]]''. Vol. 31 No. 9 p 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kadyrov stated in December 2009 that he had personally helped many of the murder victims and their families and was not their enemy. "I don't want to kill, who did I fight? I fought terrorists. Who did I protect? I protected the whole of Russia so that people in Moscow or St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg...could live in peace. They accuse me of killing women and children. It's not true."&lt;ref name=Interv/&gt;

* A mutinied commander, [[Movladi Baisarov]], said that Kadyrov "acts like a medieval tyrant. If someone tells the truth about what is going on, it's like signing one's own death warrant. Ramzan is a law unto himself. He can do anything he likes. He can take any woman and do whatever he pleases with her. (...) Ramzan acts with total impunity. I know of many people executed on his express orders and I know exactly where they were buried".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070320161547/http://www.axisglobe.com/article.asp?article=1104 Eurasian Secret Services Daily Review]. axisglobe.com (23 October 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 November 2006, Baisarov was killed in an ambush by members of Kadyrov's police on Moscow's [[Leninsky Prospekt, Moscow|Leninsky Prospekt]], about two kilometres from the Kremlin.
* On 13 November 2006, [[Human Rights Watch]] published a briefing paper&lt;ref name="HUman Rights Watch"/&gt; on torture in Chechnya that it had prepared for the 37th session of the [[United Nations]] [[UN Committee Against Torture|Committee Against Torture]]. The paper covered torture by personnel of the Second Operational Investigative Bureau ([[ORB-2]]), torture by units under the effective command of Ramzan Kadyrov, torture in secret detentions and the continuing "[[forced disappearance]]s". According to HRW, torture "in both official and secret detention facilities is widespread and systematic in Chechnya". In many cases the perpetrators were so confident that there would be no consequences for their abuses that they did not even attempt to conceal their identity. Based on extensive research, HRW concluded in 2005 that [[forced disappearance]]s in Chechnya are so widespread and systematic that they constitute [[crimes against humanity]].
* [[Anna Politkovskaya]], a veteran Russian reporter (murdered in 2006; case unsolved as of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}) who specialised in Chechnyan reporting, claimed that she had received a grainy video [[footage]] shot on a mobile phone of a man identical in appearance to Ramzan, saying that "the clips were the murders of federal servicemen by the Kadyrovites, and also kidnappings directed by Kadyrov.&lt;ref name="grainy"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Sunday Times (London)|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article600842.ece|title=Kidnap video may have doomed shot Russian reporter|author=Mark Franchetti|date=15 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are very serious things; on the basis of this evidence a criminal case and investigation should follow.

* On 23 October 2006, a [[criminal case]] was registered on the basis of the video tape frames published by the ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' newspaper in Anna Politkovskaya's article. Sergey Sokolov, deputy editor-in-chief of the paper, told the [[Echo Moskvy]] Radio that it can be clearly seen in the video as to how "Kadyrov's military forces are beating federal soldiers" with participation of "a man looking like Ramzan Kadyrov".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061116193535/http://eng.kavkaz.memo.ru/newstext/engnews/id/1090100.html Criminal case initiated on the facts disclosed by Politkovskaya]. kavkaz.memo.ru (23 October 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 October 2006, Politkovskaya was found shot dead in an elevator in her apartment in Moscow.
* German [[human rights]] group the [[Society for Threatened Peoples|Society for Threatened Peoples (GfbV)]], which branded Kadyrov a "war criminal", has alleged that up to 75 percent of recent incidents of murder, torture, [[rape]], and [[kidnapping]] in Chechnya have been committed by Ramzan's [[paramilitary]] forces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141112062315/http://www.gfbv.de/pressemit.php?id=688&amp;PHPSESSID=460043a9ad74cade2aa4777e6c4c5248 Police tried to silence GfbV – Critical banner against Putin´s Chechnya policies wars]. gfbv.de (10 October 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Memorial (society)|Memorial]] group investigator stated in its report: "Considering the evidence we have gathered, we have no doubt that most of the crimes which are being committed now in Chechnya are the work of Kadyrov's men. There is also no doubt in our minds that Kadyrov has personally taken part in beating and torturing people. What they are doing is pure lawlessness. To make matters worse, they also go after people who are innocent, whose names were given by someone being tortured to death. He and his henchmen spread fear and terror in Chechnya. (...) They travel by night as [[death squad]]s, kidnapping civilians, who are then locked in a [[torture chamber]], raped and murdered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=416&amp;issue_id=3714&amp;article_id=2371050 |title=SUNDAY TIMES DESCRIBES RAMZAN’S PERSONAL TOUCH |author=Anon |journal=Chechnya Weekly |volume=7 |issue=18 |date=4 May 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506070236/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=416&amp;issue_id=3714&amp;article_id=2371050 |archivedate=6 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tsentaroy (Khosi-Yurt), where the Kadyrovite headquarters is located, there are at least two illegal prisons functioning. One consists of concrete [[bunker]]s or [[Pillbox (military)|pillbox]]es, where kidnapped relatives of armed Chechen fighters are held [[hostage]] while the second prison in Tsentaroy is evidently located in the yard—or in immediate vicinity—of the house of Ramzan Kadyrov.
* The [[Kadyrovites]] are often accused of working as a death squad against Kadyrov's enemies. Ramzan is rumoured to own a private [[prison]] in his stronghold of Tsentaroy, his home village south-east of Grozny.

* A man who criticised local officials and apparently Kadyrov in a [[YouTube]] appeal to the Russian President became a target of many threats due to which he had to flee to the neighboring republic of Dagestan. In May 2016, his house was burnt down by a group of masked men and his family was dragged out, put in a car and were thrown under a bridge. His wife also stated that they threatened the other residents with burning down their houses as well if they reported about the matter to anyone. Later, the Chechen police cordoned off his village in order to hunt him down. Kadyrov's spokesman denied these deports were true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://themoscowtimes.com/news/masked-men-torch-chechen-mans-house-after-complaint-to-putin-about-kadyrov-52868|title=Chechen leader 'has 1,000 wedding guests questioned after losing phone'|work=The Moscow Times|date=13 May 2016|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/17/police-surround-entire-village-in-chechnya-in-hunt-for-man-who-d/|title=Police 'surround' entire village in Chechnya in hunt for man who dared to complain about local officials|work=The Telegraph|date=17 May 2016|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complainant later publicly apologised to Kadyrov and accused the media of distorting his remarks in his video complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/man-whose-house-was-torched-apologizes-for-criticism-of-kadyrov-53080|title=Man Whose House Was Torched Apologizes for Criticism of Kadyrov|work=The Moscow Times|date=31 May 2016|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He again fled to Dagestan in November 2016.

===Rounding up, torture and execution of gay men===
{{main|Anti-gay purges in Chechnya}}
Kadyrov has previously encouraged extrajudicial killings of homosexual men by family members as an alternative to law enforcement – in some cases, gay men in prison have been released early specifically to enable their murder by relatives.&lt;ref name="IBTimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/deadly-anti-lgbt-crisis-unfolding-chechnya-1616551|title='People are being tortured and killed': Chechnya's deadly anti-LGBT crisis|first=Lydia|last=Smith|date=11 April 2017|accessdate=12 April 2017|website=International Business News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, international media reported that gay men in Chechnya were being arrested, detained and [[torture]]d as part of a region-wide [[pogrom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/world/europe/chechnya-russia-attacks-gays.html|title=‘They Starve You. They Shock You’: Inside the Anti-Gay Pogrom in Chechnya|work=The New York Times|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] said on 5 May that he would personally ask the Russian [[Prosecutor General of Russia|Prosecutor General]] and [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Interior Ministry]] to help Kremlin rights [[ombudswoman]] [[Tatyana Moskalkova]] check the reported abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39823237|title=Chechnya gay rights: Putin backs inquiry into hate crimes|date=5 May 2017|publisher=|accessdate=24 August 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK Deputy Foreign Secretary Sir [[Alan Duncan]] told the UK Parliament he had been informed of alleged plans to eliminate Chechnya's gay community by the start of the Islamic holy month of [[Ramadan]],&amp;nbsp;which commenced on 26 May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/chechnya-ramzan-kadyrov-gay-men-eliminate-chechen-leader-detain-torture-end-may-2017-camps-russia-a7700711.html|title=Chechnya wants to 'eliminate' gay men by the end of May, reports suggest|date=2017-04-25|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-06-11 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chechnya has denied the reports, with its interior minister calling the allegations an "April Fools' joke". Kadyrov's spokesman [[Alvi Karimov]] rejected the allegations and described the report in the Russian newspaper, ''Novaya Gazeta'', as "absolute lies and disinformation", basing his denial on the claim that "you cannot detain and persecute people who simply do not exist in the republic. If there were such people in Chechnya, the law-enforcement organs wouldn't need to have anything to do with them because their relatives would send them somewhere from which there is no returning."&lt;ref name=armgard&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Shaun |title=Chechen police 'have rounded up more than 100 suspected gay men'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/02/chechen-police-rounded-up-100-gay-men-report-russian-newspaper-chechnya|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2 April 2017|date=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladimir Putin]]'s spokesperson [[Dmitry Peskov]] also said that there had been no evidence found to support the allegations, adding that he had no reason to doubt Kadyrov's claims that no one under his rule has been persecuted for their sexual orientation.

In an interview with [[HBO]]'s [[Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel|Real Sports]] aired on 18 July, Kadyrov said that, if there are any, Chechen gays should be moved to Canada, and claimed that pro-LGBT lobbyists are devils.&lt;ref name=BIdoomsdaydevice /&gt;&lt;ref name=WaPoKady /&gt;

===Sanctions===
On 20 December 2017, the United States imposed sanctions under the [[Magnitsky Act]] on five Russian nationals including Kadyrov, accusing him of personal involvement in repression, torture and murder. U.S. officials accused him of heading "an administration involved in disappearances and extrajudicial killings," and that one or more of his political opponents were killed at his direction. He was added to [[United States Department of the Treasury]]'s blacklist which also included a Chechen security official Ayub Kataev along with three other Russian individuals for their criminal involvement in a corruption case uncovered by [[Sergei Magnitsky]].&lt;ref name=Magnitsky&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/us-invokes-magnitsky-act-as-it-sanctions-putin-ally-and-chechen-leader-ramzan-kadyrov/a-41883305|title=US invokes Magnitsky Act as it sanctions Putin ally and Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov|publisher=Deutsche-Welle|date=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Kadyrov mocked the sanctions on his Instagram account. "A sleepless night is waiting for me." He further stated, "I can be proud that I'm out of favor with the special services of the USA," and added, "In fact, the USA cannot forgive me for dedicating my whole life to the fight against foreign terrorists among which there are bastards of America's special services."&lt;ref name=Magnitsky/&gt;

President Putin's spokesman [[Dmitry Peskov]] called the sanctions "illegal" and "unfriendly" stating, "We consider these sanctions illegal, we consider them unfriendly, and we do not agree with them." He also stated that it was highly probable that Russia would retaliate by accusing U.S. officials or citizens of rights violations and banning them from the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-chechnya-kremlin-says-us-kadyrov-sanctions-illegal-vows-response/28930921.html|title=Kremlin Says Sanctions Against Kadyrov 'Illegal,' Vows Response|publisher=RFE/RL|date=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social media==

===Networks===
The number of subscribers to Kadyrov's [[social media|social networks]] in 2016 was more than three million people, including three million followers of his [[Instagram]] account, according to the Chechen leader's press service. It said that he had 500,000 followers on the Russian [[VK (social networking)|VK]] social network, 760,860 on [[Facebook]], 331,000 on [[Twitter]] and 5,447 on [[LiveJournal]]. Besides his Instagram postings, it was said that he had also made almost 5,000 on Twitter and 2,300 on VK. The [[Russian News Agency TASS]] said that Kadyrov had been "recognized as the most quoted Russian blogger."&lt;ref name=TotalNumber&gt;[http://tass.com/society/899109 "Total Number of Kadyrov's Subscribers on Social Networks Exceeds 3 Million People"]. Tass.com (11 September 2016). Retrieved on 16 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported that Kadyrov had posted nearly 8,000 pictures on Instagram, which made him the online mobile photo-sharing, video-sharing, and social networking service's "most prolific political strongman."&lt;ref&gt;Grove, Thomas (26 August 2016) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-strongman-of-instagram-1472221224 "How Chechnya's President Ramzan Kadyrov Bends Social Media to His Will"]. ''The Wall Street Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' called Kadyrov's Instagram account "bizarre if strangely compelling",&lt;ref name=MissingChechen/&gt; and ''Newsweek'' said it was "flashy."&lt;ref name=PutinAlly&gt;Sharkov, Damien. (23 May 2016) [http://www.newsweek.com/putin-ally-kadyrov-snaps-back-john-oliver-cat-segment-462935 "Putin Ally Kadyrov Takes Aim at John Oliver Cat Segment"]. ''Newsweek''.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 article, ''The New York Times'' said that Kadyrov was "Instagram-addicted."&lt;ref name=ChechenLeaderScolds&gt;Mackey, Robert (20 May 2015) [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/21/world/europe/chechen-leader-scolds-whatsapp-users-for-spreading-rumors-about-officials-wedding.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FKadyrov%2C%20Ramzan%20A.&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=9&amp;pgtype=collection "Chechen Leader Scolds WhatsApp Users for Spreading 'Rumors' About Official's Wedding"]. ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian programme director of [[Human Rights Watch]] said in an October 2016 article in ''The Guardian'' that "even the mildest criticism on social media [is] ruthlessly punished through unlawful, punitive detention, enforced disappearances, cruel and degrading treatment, death threats, threats against family members, and physical abuse of family members." She said that a social worker from a small town in Chechnya made a [[WhatsApp]] recording that [[Viral video|went viral]] among Chechen users "imploring" Kadyrov "to look into the plight of ordinary people pushed below the poverty line" by local officials. The article stated that the woman, with her husband, "found herself hauled into the studio of [[Grozny TV]], the state television and radio broadcaster" to face Kadyrov in person, "to apologise publicly for her lies." A "severe and sweeping repression by the local authorities is designed to remind the Chechen public of Kayrov's total control," the article claimed.&lt;ref&gt;Lokshina, Tanya (10 October 2016) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/10/public-humiliation-chechen-leader-ramzan-kadyrov-strategy-control-social-media "Public Humiliation: Chechen Leader's Simple Strategy to Control Social Media"]. ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===WhatsApp lecture===

In May 2015, Kadyrov gave a stern televised lecture to a group of Chechen men and women who were accused of using the [[WhatsApp]] messaging service to comment on the impending marriage of local police chief to a teenage girl some three decades younger than him. The wedding had been widely discussed across Russia on reports that the young woman, Kheda Goylabiyeva, was being coerced into marriage with the chief, Nazhud Guchigov.&lt;ref name=ChechenLeaderScolds/&gt;

"Behave like Chechens", Kadyrov was reported as telling the assemblage of about a dozen people standing in the marbled courtyard of a building that seemed to be his government palace. "Honor of the family is the most important thing. Don't write such things any more. You, men, keep your women away from WhatsApp."&lt;ref name=ChechenLeaderScolds/&gt;&lt;ref name=ChechenLeadersAdvice/&gt; In its coverage of the incident, ''The New York Times'' reported:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Lock them in, do not let them go out, and they will not post anything", Mr. Kadyrov said in a video to a sheepish group of men and women who kept their arms folded across their chests and their eyes firmly on the ground during the harangue.&lt;ref name=ChechenLeadersAdvice&gt;MacFarquhar, Neil (May 20, 2015) [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/21/world/europe/chechen-leaders-advice-on-women-lock-them-in.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FKadyrov%2C%20Ramzan%20A.&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=8&amp;pgtype=collection "Chechen Leader's Advice on Women: Lock Them In"]. ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In December 2015, a female Chechen [[social worker]] criticised Kadyrov in an audio message posted on WhatsApp, after her boss tried to force her to put aside some money as collateral for her next month's payment. Three days after posting the message, she appeared on Grozny TV along with her husband, where she was publicly berated by Kadyrov as well as parliament speaker Magomed Daudov, presidential administration head Islam Kadyrov and her boss. The couple apologised on live television for her message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/a/chechnya-kadyriv-social-worker-tv/27443034.html|title=Kadyrov Shames Chechen Social Worker On TV|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|author=Anna Shamanska|date=22 December 2015|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Oliver===

In May 2016, Kadyrov engaged in a brief Instagram dispute with comedian [[John Oliver]].

He had posted a message on Instagram asking for help in finding his cat, which had gone astray. The posting led Oliver to make a five-minute segment on HBO's ''[[Last Week Tonight]]'' dealing with the cat's disappearance and, according to ''The Guardian,'' Kadyrov's penchant for posting of, for example, "regular videos of his [[workout|work-outs]] in the gym," also on Instagram. As well, Oliver teased Kadyrov "for his propensity" to wear [[T-shirts]] bearing the image of Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]]. After the show, Oliver posted a photo of himself holding a cat, captioned "@RKadyrov Is this your cat?"&lt;ref name="FurFlies"&gt;Walker, Shaun (24 May 2016) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/24/fur-flies-chechen-leader-ramzan-kadyrov-comedian-john-oliver-clash-lost-cat "Fur Flies as Chechen Leader and Comedian John Oliver Clash Over Los Cat"]. ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kadyrov responded in English, according to ''The New York Times'' – or a "rambling" one, according to the ''Daily Mail'' – along with a [[Photo manipulation|doctored photo]] of Oliver wearing a Putin T-shirt, captioned, in part, "I am tired of jokes. I want to care for cats in Chechnya. By the way, Putin is our leader."&lt;ref name=MissingChechen&gt;MacFarquhar, Neil (24 May 2016) [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/25/world/europe/ramzan-kadyrov-chechnya-cat.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FKadyrov%2C%20Ramzan%20A.&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=collection&amp;_r=0 "Missing: Chechen Strongman's Cat. If Seen, Contact @kadyrov_95"]. ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Account suspensions===

Kadyrov stated that he found his Russian-language Instagram and [[Facebook]] accounts were not working on December 23, 2017, and he never received a response from Instagram after sending a request for service support. His English-language Instagram account remained unaffected however. Kadyrov accused them of bowing to pressure from United States after he was sanctioned.&lt;ref name=Bowing&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-chechnya-kadyrov-off-facebook-instagram-after-us-sanctions/28934854.html|title=Chechen Leader Accuses Social Media Of Bowing To Pressure After U.S. Sanctions Tightened|publisher=RFE/RL}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
He wrote on [[Telegram (messaging service)|Telegram]] in response, "Instagram's move, which still wants to pretend it is independent from officials of Washington is weird." He added, "They wanted to stir my indignation, but were wrong, and this is the only thing which pleases me in actions Instagram and their patrons in the White House are undertaking. I have planned already to quit the network. But I thought I could fail my friends and subscribers, as on Instagram and Facebook I have more than 4 million followers."&lt;ref name=Bowing/&gt;
 
The [[Chairman of the State Duma|Speaker]] of the [[State Duma]] [[Vyacheslav Volodin]] stated that the decision by Facebook and Instagram to suspend Kadyrov's accounts violated his rights, stating, "They are afraid of a public conversation and the truth. Such decision cannot be explained in another way… The thing is that to read bloggers in social networks one needs to be their subscribers. By deleting an account, they deprive citizens of their right to know about bloggers’ opinion and to communicate with them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tass.com/politics/982788|title=State Duma speaker blasts Facebook, Instagram move to delete Chechen leader’s accounts|publisher=TASS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia's telecommunications overseer [[Roskomnadzor]] on 26 December asked Facebook to explain why they had suspended his accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-kadyrov-instagram-facebook-telecoms-watchdog/28940087.html|title=Russian Telecoms Watchdog Demands Explanation From Facebook, Instagram Over Blocked Kadyrov Accounts|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook issued a statement on 28 December that it did so after he was sanctioned by United States Department of the Treasury's [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] as these came under trade sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/facebook-instagram-kadyrov-chechnya-blocked-us-sanctions/28944406.html|title=Facebook Says Kadyrov's Social-Media Accounts Blocked Due To U.S. Sanctions|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other issues ==

=== Sauna video ===
On 12 March 2006, a Chechen separatist website posted a short video shot on a mobile phone of a party in a sauna involving two alleged prostitutes and several men, including one who looked and sounded like Ramzan Kadyrov, seen dancing with a young, half-naked woman and trying to rip her bra off. Another man then starts masturbating in front of them.&lt;ref name="Osborn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article355348.ece|work=The Independent|location=London|title=Chechen PM in sauna sex scandal|first=Andrew|last=Osborn|date=3 April 2006|accessdate=22 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817101200/http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article355348.ece|archivedate=17 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Osborn, Moscow reporter for ''[[The Independent]]'', reported that "Mr Kadyrov's aides have laughed off the grainy video ... as a 'provocation'".&lt;ref name="Osborn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsru.com/russia/15mar2006/video.html Чеченский сайт обнародовал "пикантное" видео с человеком, похожим на Рамзана Кадырова] [[NEWSru]] 15 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Call to quarantine proceeds of horse race===
On 3 November 2009, a horse owned by Ramzan Kadyrov, Mourilyan, came third in the [[Melbourne Cup]] winning about US$380,000 in prize money. The leader of the [[Australian Greens]], Senator [[Bob Brown]], immediately called for the [[Government of Australia]] to quarantine the prize money until assurances are received as to how the money will be used. Concerns had been previously raised that the [[Melbourne Cup]] could be used to launder money by overseas individuals.&lt;ref name = "Quarantine prize money of Chechen horse: Greens"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/sport/horseracing/mourilyan-third/2009/11/03/1257010193627.html|title=Quarantine prize money of Chechen horse: Greens|publisher=Sydney Morning Gerald|date=3 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Honor killings ===
In 2009, Kadyrov stated his approval of [[honor killing]]s, based on the belief that women are the property of their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=28409 |title=Chechen President Kadyrov Defends Honor Killings |publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=3 March 2009 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318050843/http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=28409 |archivedate=18 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with David Scott of [[HBO]], he condoned honor killings of homosexuals in July 2017 stating, "If we have [gay] people here, I'm telling you officially their relatives won't let them be because of our faith, our mentality, customs, traditions. Even if it's punishable under the law, we would still condone it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/chechen-republic-dictator-kadyrov-fighters-beat-article-1.3336146|title=Chechen Republic dictator Ramzan Kadyrov offers disturbing look into his reign, says his MMA fighters would beat America’s|publisher=NY Daily News|date=July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wikileaks ===
On 28 November 2010, a [[Classified information|classified]] [[Wikileaks cable]] named Kadyrov as a "starring guest" at some of [[Dagestan]]'s most elaborate weddings, which indicates the political "Caucasus power structure" in these weddings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/cable/2006/08/06MOSCOW9533.html|title=Full-text search|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, leaked cables from an American diplomat recounted a lavish wedding attended by Kadyrov in Russia's Caucasus region in which guests threw $100 bills at child dancers, and which had nighttime "water-scooter jaunts on the Caspian Sea", and a report that Ramzan Kadyrov gave the newly married couple a "five-kilo lump of gold".&lt;ref name=twsDecZ16bb2/&gt;

=== ''Charlie Hebdo'' cartoons ===
In January 2015, Kadyrov said he would organize protests if a Russian newspaper published the ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' cartoons, saying "we will not allow anyone to insult the Prophet [Muhammad], even if it will cost us our lives." He also stated that [[Alexei Venediktov]] "will be brought to account" after his radio station [[Ekho Moskvy]] took a survey of readers on whether to publish the cartoons. Venediktov stated he would ask the authorities to intervene against Kadyrov's threats.&lt;ref name=MT150112&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/there-s-no-line-kadyrov-can-t-cross-analysts-say/514252.html |title= There's No Line Kadyrov Can't Cross, Analysts Say |first= Allison |last= Quinn |work=The Moscow Times|date= 12 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a protest rally against the cartoons attended by hundreds of thousands of people in Chechnya, he accused those backing Charlie Hebdo of using "false slogans about free speech and democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/19/chechens-protest-cartoons-prophet-muhammad-charlie-hebdo | title= Up to 800,000 Chechens protest over cartoons of prophet Muhammad | publisher = The Guardian | date= 19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polygamy ===
Kadyrov supports [[polygamy]] in Muslim-majority [[Republics of Russia|republics in Russia]], and believes that Muslims who speak out against the practise are not true adherents to their faith. According to Kadyrov, men legally marrying more than one wife would be more honest than having lots of [[mistress (lover)|mistresses]], and would resolve [[Demographic crisis of Russia|Russia's demographic problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://rbth.com/news/2015/06/18/polygamy_is_blessing_mistresses_are_evil_-_chechen_leader_47014.html|title=Polygamy is blessing, mistresses are evil – Chechen leader|work=[[Russia Beyond the Headlines]]|agency=[[Interfax]]|date=18 June 2015|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, he stated that all Muslim men are permitted by Allah to have four wives but discouraged having the marriages officially registered. He also denied reports that polygamy would be legalised in Chechnya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tass.com/society/1001474|title=Legalization of polygamy in Chechnya is out of question, says Chechen leader|work=[[TASS]]|date=24 April 2018|accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Boston Marathon bombing ===
After the [[Boston Marathon bombing]], Kadyrov expressed sadness for the victims but denied the suspects had any ties to his region in a statement on his Instagram. He suggested that the suspects were products of American upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/us/entry/kadyrov-chechen-president-boston-bombing_n_3116698.html|title=Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechen President, Suggests Boston Bombing Suspects Products Of American Upbringing|last1=Bennett-Smith|first1=Meredith|publisher=Huffington Post|date=19 April 2013|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kadyrov accused the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] of framing [[Dzokhar Tsarnaev]] on 18 March 2015, after he was handed a death sentence for the Boston Marathon Bombing and said that they could not have conducted the bombing without CIA's knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/chechen-leader-accuses-us-intelligence-framing-boston-bomber-dzhokhar-tsarnaev-1926343|title=Chechen Leader Accuses US Intelligence Of Framing Boston Bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev|last1=Pandey|first1=Avaneesh|publisher=International Business Times|date=18 May 2015|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Threats to opposition politicians ===
On 31 January 2016, Kadyrov posted a video of Russian opposition politicians [[Mikhail Kasyanov]] and [[Vladimir Vladimirovich Kara-Murza]] in the crosshairs of a gun on his [[Instagram]] blog.&lt;ref name=BBC160201&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35459613 |title= Chechnya's Kadyrov puts Putin critic Kasyanov in gunsights |work= [[BBC News]] |date= 1 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters160201&gt;{{cite news |url= http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-russia-opposition-threat-idUKKCN0VA2J6 |title= Putin ally issues video of opposition leader in sniper's cross-hairs |first= Andrew |last= Osborn |work= [[Reuters]] |date= 1 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a few days after multiple complaints Instagram removed the video prompting Kadyrov to criticize the decision: "This is the much-boasted freedom of speech in America! You can write anything but cannot touch those American dogs, those friends of the Congress and the State Department".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Кадыров раскритиковал Instagram за удаления поста с Касьяновым под прицелом|url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/news/2016/02/02/626417-kadirov-instagram-kasyanovim|agency=[[Vedomosti]]|date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Report by Ilya Yashin===
Russian opposition leader [[Ilya Yashin]] authored a report against Kadyrov released on 23 February 2016 during a press conference which was repeatedly interrupted by police and hecklers. He also claimed that Kadyrov had murdered [[Boris Nemtsov]]. The report titled ''A National Security Threat'' claimed that Kadyrov poses a threat to Russia. It included allegations of corruption, authoritarian rule, secret prisons, rigging votes in favour of Vladimir Putin, stealing from the country's national budget to enrich himself, enforcing [[Sharia law]] over Russian law, his lavish lifestyle, building and maintaining a personal army of about 30,000 fighters, purported ties to organised crime figures, and his involvement in politically motivated murders of journalists, human rights activists and political opponents. The report also contained 20 questions which Yashin had invited Kadyrov to answer but was refused. Kadyrov dismissed the report calling it "nothing but idle chatter" and posted it on his social network accounts before its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/russia-chechnya-kadyrov-opposition-expose/27568698.html|title=Despite Harassment, Russian Opposition Leader Presents Scathing Kadyrov Report|last1=Balmforth|first1=Tom|last2=Coalson|first2=Robert|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=23 February 2016|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/23/chechen-leader-ramzan-kadyrov-threatens-whole-of-russia-opposition-warns|title=Chechen leader Kadyrov 'threatens whole of Russia', opposition says|last1=Bennetts|first1=Marc|publisher=The Guardian|date=23 February 2016|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/report-blames-chechen-leader-over-killing-kremlin-critic-121619146.html|title=Report blames Chechen leader over killing of Kremlin critic|publisher=Yahoo!

===Grozny fatwa===

A conference of Islamic scholars funded by the Tabah foundation in the [[United Arab Emirates]], was convened by Kadyrov in Grozny in late August 2016. The conference was attended by notable Islamic scholars including the [[Grand Imam of Al-Azhar]], [[Ahmed el-Tayeb]]; [[Grand Mufti]] of [[Egypt]], [[Shawki Allam]]; ex-Grand Mufti of Egypt [[Ali Gomaa]], Usama al-Azhari who is the religious adviser to [[Egyptian President]] [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]]; [[Habib Ali al-Jifri]] and the [[mufti]] of [[Damascus]] Abdul Fattah al-Bizm. The conference was convened to discuss the alleged abuse of Islamic ideas to propagate extremism and to establish the criteria for determining who are the true followers of the [[Sunnah]]. The assembly of scholars issued a [[fatwa]] which declared that those who abide by the [[Kalam]], belong to the four [[Schools of Sunni law|madhhabs]] and follow the path of moral self-perfection espoused by distinguished Islamic teachers, primarily the [[Sufi]] [[Sheikh (Sufism)|sheikhs]], were the only true believers. The fatwa called the sect of [[Salafism]] as a "dangerous and erroneous contemporary sect", along with the extremist groups like [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Habashis]]. The conference also issued two further documents. In the first one, it appealed to President Vladimir Putin to ban Salafism and term any condemnation of "[[traditional Islam]]" as "extremism". It also proposed the fatwa be regarded as the considered opinion of "leading Russian experts" when evaluating the activity of Muslim organizations and the preaching of individual clerics. The second one issued a resolution calling for the establishment of a Council for Islamic Education and also a Council of [[Ulema]], which would rule on who is and is not a true follower of [[Sunni Islam]].&lt;ref name="RfeRl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/a/caucasus-report-grozny-fatwa-controversy/27987472.html|title=Analysis: Grozny Fatwa On 'True Believers' Triggers Major Controversy|last1=Fuller|first1=Liz|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=14 September 2016|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalist.com/soul-of-islam-uae-saudi-arabia-religion-gulf-countries/|title=UAE Vs.

A New Fracture Emerges in Islam|author=Yaroslav Trofimov|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=22 September 2016|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruling created a controversy, with both Islamic theologians and secular commentators condemning it, with some seeing it as a bid by Kadyrov to divide [[Russian Muslims]] into those who accept the importance he places on teachings of the Sufi brotherhoods as well as probably also what he considers as "traditional Islam" without question, and those who don't with "erroneous" views. Many of the key participants also disavowed the resolutions. Mukkadas Bibarsov, [[mufti]] of [[Saratov Oblast]] stated that the question of who was a true follower of Sunni Islam was resolved "centuries ago". He also added that the fatwa failed to take into account the crucial differences between Russia's Muslims, specifically that some Muslim communities did not follow [[Sufism]]. Liz Fuller writing for [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] commented that the fatwa seemed to be giving permission to Kadyrov to take any action he likes to punish those whose religious views don't match with his own. Yaroslav Trofimov writing for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' described it as a "new fracture emerging within Islam". Many Saudi clerics and citizens expressed outrage at the fatwa on social media. The [[Muslim Brotherhood]] expressed "deep sorrow" over the fatwa, stating that it “ignited fires of discord among Muslims around the world.”&lt;ref name="RfeRl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TG"/&gt;

=== Threats to Russian police officers ===
In 2015, Kadyrov ordered Chechen security forces to “shoot to kill” if they encountered [[Law enforcement in Russia|police officers]] from [[Federal subjects of Russia|other parts of Russia]] on the territory of the Chechen Republic.&lt;ref name= "moscow times"&gt;"[https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/kadyrov-authorizes-his-police-to-shoot-officers-from-other-parts-of-russia-46061 Kadyrov Authorizes His Police to Shoot Officers From Other Parts of Russia]".

We have to be reckoned with. … If you are masters of your territory, then you must control it."&lt;ref name= "moscow times"/&gt; According to Ekaterina Sokirianskaia, "Some critics claim that Mr. Putin now fears Mr. Kadyrov because he knows any serious attempt to challenge the Chechen leader’s position might lead to a third war."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/opinion/chechnya-ramzan-kadyrov-russia.html Is Chechnya Taking Over Russia?]" ''The New York Times.'' 17 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mixed martial arts tournament involving child fighters===
A [[mixed martial arts]] tournament involving children was held as an "exhibition fight" on 4 October during the ''Grand Prix Akhmat 2016'' in Grozny and broadcast on [[Match TV]]. Ramzan's three sons, all of whom are aged under 12, fought in the tournament with Ramzan sitting in the audience and none of the fighters wore any protective gear. One of the fights ended with a [[technical knockout]]. He also posted images of the bouts on his Instagram account. The event caused an outcry especially against Ramzan allowing his children to compete in the tournament. [[Fedor Emelianenko]], the president of Russian MMA Union, criticised the event as "inexcusable", stating that rules stipulate fighters under the age of 21 have to wear protective gear while children under the age of 12 are not allowed to compete. Vadim Finkelstein, the head of MMA promotion [[M-1 Global]] also backed Fedor's comments. [[Dmitry Peskov]], the spokesperson for President Putin, stated that the fact that one of the fights between the children finished with a technical knockout was “a reason for the appropriate oversight agencies to inquire about this incident.” [[Ministry of Sport (Russia)|Deputy Minister of Sports]] [[Pavel Kolobkov]] stated that participation of children under the age of 12 in MMA competitions was illegal while stating that the incident was being investigated. Sports Minister [[Vitaly Mutko]] also stated that the event will be investigated. MMA fighter [[Jeff Monson]] however backed the organisers stating that there was nothing wrong with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-wp-blm-chechnya-comment-6df5bcbe-8c84-11e6-8cdc-4fbb1973b506-20161007-story.html|title=Kiddie fight offers insight into Putin's approach to Chechnya Leonid Bershidsky|last1=Bershidsky|first1=Leonid|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=7 October 2016|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/chechen-leader-blasted-watches-children-9010015|title=Chechen leader blasted as he watches his own children fighting in UFC-style cage battles

Several Chechen officials responded to Fedor's criticism with insults and accusations including Timur Dugazayev, general director of Akhmat MMA promotion, [[State Duma|Member of Parliament]] [[Adam Delimkhanov]] as well as Kadyrov himself.&lt;ref name="RTSport"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pravdareport.com/society/stories/12-10-2016/135857-childrens_fights_chechnya-0/|title=Children's MMA fights in Chechnya: Immoral behaviour that only Chechens understand|publisher= Pravda Report|date=12 October 2016|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Sports found on 18 October that Kadyrov's promotion had violated regulations. It also found that the event was actually an unlicensed show with no regulatory oversight. The promotion was directed to coordinate with the Ministry of Sports and other regulatory bodies to “prevent such irregularities in conduct” and handed a letter detailing its failure to comply with the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2016/10/19/13329312/kremlin-rules-against-kadyrov-child-mma-fights-stern-letter-putin-russia-fedor|title=Kremlin rules against Kadyrov’s child MMA fights, sends stern letter|publisher= SB Nation|date=18 October 2016|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comments about gays, Russia's nuclear arsenal and tensions with the United States===

In an interview with [[HBO]]'s ''[[Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel]]'' in July 2018, Kadyrov denied his government detained and tortured gay men, while stating they weren't human and didn't exist in Chechnya. He further stated that if they existed, they should be sent to Canada. Kadyrov also commented about Russia's nuclear arsenal and tensions between USA and Russia. He stated, "America is not really a strong enough state for us to regard it as an enemy of Russia, we have a strong government and are a nuclear state." He also stated, "Even if our government was completely destroyed, our nuclear missiles would be automatically deployed. We will put the whole world on its knees and screw it from behind."&lt;ref name=BIdoomsdaydevice/&gt;&lt;ref name=WaPoKady/&gt;

Kadyrov has previously encouraged extrajudicial killings of homosexual men by family members as an alternative to law enforcement. Since February 2017, over 100 male residents of the [[Chechen Republic]] (part of the [[Russian Federation]]) assumed to be [[gay]] or [[bisexual]] have been rounded up, detained and [[torture]]d by Kadyrov's government on account of their [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="uawire.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uawire.org/news/homosexual-men-from-Chechnya-confirm-existence-of-special-prisons-in-the-republic|title=Information uncovered about a second prison for homosexuals in the Russian republic of Chechnya|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These crackdowns have been described as part of a systemic anti-[[LGBT]] [[purge]] in the region. The men have been held and allegedly tortured in what human rights groups and eyewitnesses have called [[Internment|concentration camps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Lydia|title=Chechnya detains 100 gay men in first concentration camps since the Holocaust|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/chechnya-detains-100-gay-men-first-concentration-camps-since-holocaust-1616363|accessdate=16 April 2017|work=International Business Times UK|date=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Advocate"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reynolds|first1=Daniel|title=Report: Chechnya Is Torturing Gay Men in Concentration Camps|url=http://www.advocate.com/world/2017/4/10/report-chechyna-torturing-gay-men-concentration-camps|accessdate=16 April 2017|work=The Advocate|date=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kadyrov has denied these reports, while also characterizing gay people as "not human" and claiming that they "don't exist in his region".&lt;ref name=WaPoKady&gt;{{cite news|title=Ramzan Kadyrov says there are no gay men in Chechnya — and if there are any, they should move to Canada|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/07/15/ramzan-kadyrov-says-there-are-no-gay-men-in-chechnya-and-if-there-are-any-they-should-move-to-canada/|agency=[[Washington Post]]|date=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BIdoomsdaydevice&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/kadyrov-russia-doomsday-device-nuclear-2017-7|title=Chechnya's leader says Russia has a literal nuclear doomsday device — and it's automated|work=Business Insider|date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New Yorker]]'' says that over the years Kadyrov has tried out various personalities: "the merciless warrior in fatigues who leads special operations to kill anti-government rebels; the jolly Caucasus baron who spars with [[Mike Tyson]] and shows off his private zoo; the family man and observant Muslim who has banned alcohol, ordered that women wear head scarves in public buildings, and boasts that his six-year-old son has memorized the Koran."

'''Selika Lazevski''' was a black [[equestrianism|horsewoman]] in [[Belle Époque Paris|''Belle Époque'' Paris]]. In 1891, she was the subject of a series of six portraits at the studio of [[Paul Nadar]] in Paris.

==Life==
Little is known of her life but she is thought to have been a horsewoman who rode ''[[Airs above the ground|haute école]]'' at the [[Nouveau Cirque]] (1886-1926) on [[rue Saint-Honoré]], Paris. Selika may not have been her real first name and there is a possibility that she took her surname Lazevski from the Polish circus horseman and ''haute école'' rider [[Valli de Laszewski]] and his French wife, Lara, who worked at the Nouveau Cirque during that period.&lt;ref name=paris&gt;[https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2018/02/09/selika-lost-mystery-belle-epoque/ Selika, Mystery of the Belle Epoque.] Susanna Forrest, ''[[The Paris Review]]'', 9 February 2018. Retrieved 19 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, Lazevski was the subject of a series of six portraits at the studio of Paul Nadar (son of [[Nadar]]) in Paris.&lt;ref name=paris/&gt;

==''L'Africaine''==
Sélika is the name of an enslaved Hindu princess who is the heroine of ''[[L'Africaine]]'', an opera by [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]] that was unfinished at the time of his death in 1864. The opera was completed by Meyerbeer's friend, [[François-Joseph Fétis]], and premiered in Paris in 1865 by which time the heroine had become an African princess.

==Legacy==
In 2016, it was announced that a short film, ''The Adventures of Selika'' would be made based on Lazevski's life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/news/adventures-of-selika-sybil-mair-606639 New equestrian film: Tom Hunt produces score while leading lady takes to the saddle.] Lucy Elder, ''Horse &amp; Hound'', 11 December 2016.

==History==
[[Image:Old peasant with dagger and long smoking pipe, Mestia, Svanetia, Georgia (Republic).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Svan with dagger and long smoking pipe. [[Mestia]] (~1888–1900)]]
{{Georgians}}

The Svans are usually identified with the '''[[Sanni]]''' mentioned by [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]] [[geography|geographer]] [[Strabo]], who placed them more or less in the area still occupied by the modern-day Svans.

In the Russian Empire and early Soviet Union [[Mingrelian people|Mingrelians]] and Svans had their own census grouping, but were classified under the broader category of Georgian in the 1930s. They are [[Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church|Georgian Orthodox]] Christians, and were Christianized in the 4th–6th centuries. However, some remnants of pre-Christian beliefs have been maintained. [[Saint George]] (known as ''Jgëræg'' to the locals), a [[patron saint]] of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], is the most respected saint. The Svans have retained many of their old traditions, including [[Feud|blood revenge]], although this tradition has been declining over time and as law enforcement takes hold. Their families are small, and the husband is the head of his family. The Svan strongly respect the older women in families.

==Language==
Typically bilingual, they use both [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and their own, unwritten [[Svan language]]. However, Svan is being largely replaced by Georgian, which is the language of culture and education in Georgia.

==Genetics==
According to [[Y-DNA|Y-DNA Haplogroups]], Svan people are almost entirely made up of DNA from one unique [[Haplogroup F* (Y-DNA)]] known as haplogroup F[xI,G,J2,K], found in the [[Abazins|Abazin]] (29%), [[Chechens|Chechen]] (32%) and [[Dargins|Dargin]] (27%) populations with the remaining 8% of their DNA being part of [[Haplogroup G-M201]]. &lt;ref&gt;Nasizde 2004a&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous Svans==

* [[Géla Babluani]]
* [[Mikheil Gelovani]]
* [[Otar Ioseliani]]
* [[Mikheil Kurdiani]]
* [[Sopho Gelovani]]
* [[Tariel Oniani]]

'''Thomas Robert "Tom" Frame''' (born 7 October 1962) is an Australian [[Anglican]] bishop, historian, academic, author and [[social commentator]].

==Early life==
Frame was born in [[Stanmore, New South Wales]] and raised in [[Wollongong]] by his [[Adoption|adoptive]] parents. He was educated at West Wollongong Infants School (1968–70), West Wollongong Primary School (1971–74, awarded Dux in 1974) and Wollongong High School (1975–78).

==Career==
Frame joined the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College, HMAS ''Creswell'']] as a 16-year-old junior entry cadet [[midshipman]] in January 1979. Later that year, he was assigned to the destroyer escort {{HMAS|Derwent|DE 49|6}} as a junior officer under training, where he earned his helmsman's certificate. He graduated from the RAN College in December 1983. Frame completed his studies in Chinese history and economics at the [[University of New South Wales]], graduating with Bachelor of Arts (Honours), and the inaugural W.J. Liu Memorial Prize for Excellence in Chinese Studies in 1984.

Frame was the inaugural Summer Vacation Scholar at the [[Australian War Memorial]] in 1985, then completed his training aboard {{HMAS|Jervis Bay|GT 203|6}} and {{HMAS|Supply}}. He was then assigned to the shore establishment {{HMAS|Cerberus|naval base|6}} as an instructor. While there, he took on additional duty as director of the base's museum, also working as a consultant for the [[Australian National Maritime Museum]] and studying for a Diploma in Education from the [[University of Melbourne]].

Frame was appointed Research Officer to the [[Chief of Navy (Australia)|Chief of Naval Staff]] at Navy Office, Canberra in April 1988. Two years later he undertook study in military history at the [[Australian Defence Force Academy]] leading to the award of a PhD in October 1991, taking as his thesis topic the [[Melbourne-Voyager collision|''Melbourne''-''Voyager'' collision]]. He served as a staff officer at Headquarters, [[Australian Defence Force]], then resigned from the RAN in November 1992.

===Post-naval career===
Frame then completed a [[Master's degree|Master]] of Theology degree with a thesis entitled ''The Delphic Sword: Reconciling Christianity and Military Service in Australia'' and trained for the [[priesthood]] in the [[Anglican Church of Australia]] in the [[Anglican Diocese of Canberra and Goulburn|Diocese of Canberra and Goulburn]].

He was [[Ordination|ordained]] in December 1993 and appointed curate of St John's Church in [[Wagga Wagga]] and a Visiting Scholar at [[Charles Sturt University]]. In November 1995, he was inducted as [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of St James' Church, Binda.

From 1996 to 1997, he took leave in England and completed a [[Master of Arts]] (Honours) in applied theology at the [[University of Kent]] at [[Canterbury]] as the [[Lucas Tooth]] Scholar and ministered in the United [[Benefice]] of [[Hever, Kent|Hever]], [[Four Elms]] and [[Markbeech]] in the [[Diocese of Rochester]].

He became Rector of St Philip's Church, [[Bungendore]], in January 1999 and was appointed lecturer (half-time) in public theology at [[St Mark's National Theological Centre]] in June 2000. He was also a Visiting Fellow in the School of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the Australian National University from 1999 to 2003.

On 28 June 2001, he was consecrated bishop and became the first full-time Anglican Bishop to the [[Australian Defence Force]]. He was the youngest Anglican bishop in Australia when consecrated and the fifth youngest in the nation's history. He was Patron of the Armed Forces Federation of Australia (2002–06) and a member of the Council of the Australian War Memorial (2004–07), and judged the Inaugural Prime Minister's Prize for Australian History in 2007.

===Academic career===
Frame resigned as Anglican Bishop to the Australian Defence Force in November 2006 to become Director of St Mark's National Theological Centre at [[Barton, Australian Capital Territory|Barton]] in [[Canberra, Australian Capital Territory]], the administrative headquarters of the School of Theology of [[Charles Sturt University]] with the title of Professor. He was head of the CSU School of Theology from November 2006 to June 2008. He completed his directorship of St Mark's in January 2014.

In July 2014, Frame was appointed Director of the Australian Centre for the Study of Armed Conflict and Society (ACSACS) at the University of New South Wales, Canberra, and commissioned to produce a 50th anniversary history of the relationship between the University and the Department of Defence for release in 2017.

==Personal life==
Frame married Helen (Bardsley), a pianist, secondary school science teacher and former Army Reserve Officer, in December 1983 at Huskisson, New South Wales. They have two daughters (Megan (1987) and Kelly (1989)) and two granddaughters (Lily and Imogen). In 2010, he relocated to a rural property adjacent to the village of Tarago (north-east of Canberra) where he is engaged in small-scale beef production. He is also Honorary Priest in Charge of the Mulwaree Anglican Mission District consisting of churches at Lake Bathurst, Tarago, Currawang and Collector.

'''Victoria Stilwell''' (born 20 July 1969) is an English [[dog trainer]], author and [[television presenter]]. Stilwell served as a judge on the CBS show ''[[Greatest American Dog]]'' and presented the [[Animal Planet]] dog training TV show ''[[It's Me or the Dog]]'', counselling families with problem pets and solving their dogs' behaviour problems.

==Background==
Stilwell originally trained as an actress, playing roles in ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' in 1992, [[ITV1]]'s ''[[The Bill]]'' in 1994, and onstage in London's West End theatre, as well as several commercials and voiceovers. She received a BA honours degree in Theatre from [[Middlesex University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:-I8v1k53hPQJ:www.playbill.com/news/article/107375-Its-Me-or-the-Dog-Featuring-Actress-Dog-Trainer-Stilwell-Makes-US-TV-Debut+Victoria+Stilwell+%22middlesex+university%22&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=ru&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ua&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to supplement her income as an actress, Stilwell's veterinary nurse sister suggested that she start a dog walking agency. Within a month she was walking 20 dogs per day – 10 in the morning, 10 in the afternoon – and immediately recognised the need for qualified professionals to help her clients with the training process. She then expanded her focus to dog training and after moving to the United States with her husband in 1999, Stilwell co-founded several dog training companies up and down the East Coast.

==Dog trainer==
Stilwell has become an advocate of science-based dog training. Stilwell rejects dominance-based, traditional training techniques, instead, promoting positive reinforcement techniques.

In 2010, Stilwell created Victoria Stilwell Positively Dog Training – a global network of positive reinforcement dog trainers dedicated to spreading the word about positive reinforcement techniques and behaviourists.

Stilwell is currently certified by the Animal Behaviour and Training Associates, and is a longtime member of the US Association of Pet Dog Trainers (APDT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Association of Professional Dog Trainers - Victoria Stilwell|url=http://apdt.com/conf/speakers/bio_stilwell.aspx|accessdate=20 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603105206/http://www.apdt.com/conf/speakers/bio_stilwell.aspx|archive-date=3 June 2013|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charity==
Stilwell created the Victoria Stilwell Foundation, whose mission is "to provide financial support and canine behaviour expertise to assistance dog organisations and small animal rescue shelters while promoting the concept of reward-based, positive reinforcement dog training philosophies in organisations and households throughout the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://positively.com/foundation/mission-inspiration|title=Mission &amp; Inspiration - Victoria Stilwell Positively|website=''positively.com''|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a particular fondness for rescue animals in need of behavior rehabilitation, Stilwell devotes much of her time and energy to a number of animal rescue organizations around the world, serving as a behavior adviser for shelters in Atlanta, New York, the UK and Hong Kong while giving regular seminars on the subject of dog rescue, training and rehabilitation. She has been involved in animal welfare and protection organizations on a national (U.S.) stage, including serving as an Advisory Board Member of RedRover&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victoria Joins RedRover|url=http://positively.com/2011/07/01/victoria-joins-redrover-formerly-united-animal-nations/|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a National Ambassador for [[American Humane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal Planet’s ‘It's Me or the Dog’ Star Victoria Stilwell Is Named an American Humane Association National Ambassador|url=http://www.americanhumane.org/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/animal-planets-its-me-or.html|accessdate=20 February 2014|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140220203757/http://www.americanhumane.org/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/animal-planets-its-me-or.html|archive-date=20 February 2014|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked as a volunteer adoption counselor for the [[ASPCA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://positively.com/victorias-blog/911-a-look-back/|title=9/11: A Look Back {{!}} Victoria Stilwell Positively|website=''positively.com''|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been featured in numerous magazines and journals including ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/13/fashion/13pet.html?_r=1&amp;scp=6&amp;sq=victoria+stilwell&amp;st=nyt|title=Who Invited the Dog?|first=Joyce Wadler and Abby|last=Aguirre|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/pets/2009-08-12-stilwell-dog-chains_N.htm|title=Chaining dogs unleashes bad behavior |website=USA Today|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', [[MSNBC.com]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35522352/ns/health-pet_health/|title=MSN - Outlook, Office, Skype, Bing, Breaking News, and Latest Videos|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Psychology Today]]'' and ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article636837.ece|title=Jail Owners of Killer Dogs – News – The Sun(UK)|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;''. Stilwell is a regular columnist for ''[http://thebark.com The Bark]'', ''[[Dog World]]'', ''American Dog'' and ''[[Dogs Today]]'' magazines, and she has appeared on numerous talk shows, news broadcasts and radio shows in the US, Europe and Asia as a dog training expert.

==TV programmes==

===''It's Me or the Dog''===
From 2005 to 2008, Stilwell worked with unruly dogs on her TV show, ''[[It's Me or the Dog]]'', which aired in over forty countries. The show features Stilwell as she counsels families with problem pets and uses positive reinforcement training techniques to help them learn how to correct their dogs' behaviour. Originally produced for [[Channel 4]] in the UK, the show premiered in the US on [[Animal Planet]] in April 2007, and over 90 episodes have been aired worldwide. A typical episode involves a family struggling to cope with their misbehaving dog(s). Stilwell initially observes the problems [[in situ]], then presents the family with her opinion regarding the causes of the issues. She then works with the family and their dogs to restore balance.

===''Greatest American Dog''===
Stilwell was one of three judges on the [[CBS]] show ''[[Greatest American Dog]]'', in which 12 dog-owner teams compete for the title 'Greatest American Dog' and a $250,000 prize. The series debuted on CBS 10 July 2008.

==Podcast==
Stilwell created a podcast called ''Victoria Stilwell Positively'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victoria Stilwell Positively|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/victoria-stilwell-positively/id376674442?mt=2|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; available on iTunes and other places of podcast purchase

==Awards==
Stilwell was honoured with the prestigious "Excellence in Journalism and Outstanding Contributions to the Pet Industry Award" at the 2011 Global Pet Expo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/prwebAPPA-PIDA/Victoria-Stilwell/prweb8158250.htm|title=Victoria Stilwell to be Honored at Global Pet Expo 2011|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named 'Dog Trainer of the Year' by DogWorld Magazine at the 55th Annual Purina Pro Plan Show Dogs of the Year Awards Presented By Dogs in Review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/victoria-stilwell-named-2009-trainer-of-the-year-84233392.html|title=Victoria Stilwell named 2009 Dog Trainer of the Year – PR Newswire|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was named among 2009's '100 Best &amp; Brightest' in the dog world in ''The Bark'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://positively.com/files/Bark-2010-BestBrightest.pdf|title=Bark's 100: the Best and Brightest – The Bark|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stilwell won a 2009 CableFax award as Best Host in the Animals &amp; Nature category. In 2009, ''It's Me or the Dog'' was nominated for a [[People's Choice Award]] in the US, and after its first season in the UK, ''It's Me or the Dog'' was nominated in the 'Best Factual Entertainment' category in the UK's [[TV Quick]] Awards. Her first book, ''It's Me or the Dog: How to Have the Perfect Pet'' was voted one of the 50 greatest dog books ever written by ''[[Dogs Today]]'' magazine.

==Campaigns==
She advocates animal rescue and supports ''Paws Atlanta'', "Atlanta Pet Rescue", ''Stray from the Heart (NYC)'', ''Hong Kong Dog Rescue'' and ''Greyhound Rescue West of England (www.grwe.com)'', ''Wisconsin Puppy Mill Project'', the ''Waterside Action Group'', ''Deed Not Breed'' (campaigning to re-write the UK's [[Dangerous Dogs Act]] to remove breed-specific legislation) as well as ''Vets Get Scanning'', promoting mandatory pet micro-chipping and scanning by vets.

Stilwell is a critic of [[fox hunting]] and was among more than 20 high-profile people who signed a letter to Members of Parliament in 2015 to oppose [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] prime minister [[David Cameron]]'s plan to amend the [[Hunting Act 2004]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.stv.tv/scotland-decides/news/1324609-snp-to-vote-against-tories-on-fox-hunting-ban-in-england-and-wales/ |title=SNP to vote against Tories on fox hunting ban in England and Wales |publisher=STV |date=13 July 2015 |accessdate=17 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715203740/http://news.stv.tv/scotland-decides/news/1324609-snp-to-vote-against-tories-on-fox-hunting-ban-in-england-and-wales/ |archivedate=15 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Stilwell met her actor husband, Van Zeiler, while starring opposite him in the West End production of ''[[Buddy - The Buddy Holly Story]]''. The couple and their daughter live in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/film_and_tv/s/1010/1010822_victoria_misses_england.html|title=Victoria misses England|first=Manchester Evening|last=News|date=19 April 2010|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After many years without a pet dog of her own (due to work commitments), Stilwell adopted a rescued chocolate [[Labrador Retriever|Labrador]] named Sadie. In early 2011, Stilwell fostered a Chihuahua/Miniature Pinscher mix named Jasmine and decided to adopt her in late February/early March 2011. Prior to that, she had spent her time since 2000 fostering dogs due to be [[Animal euthanasia|euthanised]] by local municipal shelters. Stilwell and her husband then gave the dogs a home while rehabilitating them and eventually finding suitable homes for the animals. She has explained that, until recently, owning a dog would have been irresponsible and not fair to the dog, considering how much the whole family travels. The couple has re-homed over 50 dogs and cats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.k9magazine.com/k9insider/exclusive-content/victoria-stilwell-its-me-or-the-dog.html |title=It's Me or The Dog – The Victoria Stilwell Interview for K9 Magazine |access-date=13 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070417225504/http://www.k9magazine.com/k9insider/exclusive-content/victoria-stilwell-its-me-or-the-dog.html |archive-date=17 April 2007 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vince coleman-face-pre1917.jpg|thumb|Vince Coleman]]
'''Patrick Vincent Coleman''' (13{{nbsp}}March 1872{{snd}}6{{nbsp}}December 1917)&lt;ref&gt;Nova Scotia Vital Statistics, Birth: Registration Year: 1874 - Book: 1811 - Page: 5 - Number: 92; Death: Registration Year: 1917 - Page: 102 - Number: 613&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[train dispatcher]] for the [[Canadian Government Railways]] (formerly the ICR, [[Intercolonial Railway of Canada]]) who was killed in the [[Halifax Explosion]], but not before he sent a message to an incoming passenger train to stop out of range of the explosion.  Today he is remembered as one of the heroic figures from the disaster.

On the morning of 6 December 1917, the 45-year-old Coleman and Chief Clerk William Lovett were working in the [[Richmond, Nova Scotia|Richmond]] station, surrounded by the railway yards near the foot of Richmond Street, only a few hundred feet from Pier 6. From there, trains were controlled on the main line into [[City of Halifax|Halifax]]. The line ran along the western shore of [[Bedford Basin]] from [[Rockingham, Nova Scotia|Rockingham Station]] to the city's passenger terminal at the [[North Street Station (Halifax)|North Street Station]], located a mile to the south of Richmond Station. Coleman was an experienced dispatcher who had been commended a few years earlier for helping to safely stop a runaway train.&lt;ref&gt;[https://maritimemuseum.novascotia.ca/what-see-do/halifax-explosion/vincent-coleman-and-halifax-explosion Dan Conlin, "Vincent Coleman and the Halifax Explosion", ''Maritime Museum of the Atlantic'' web page]&lt;/ref&gt;

At approximately 8:45&amp;nbsp;a.m., there was a collision between {{SS|Mont-Blanc}}, a French munitions ship carrying a cargo of high explosives, and a Norwegian vessel, {{SS|Imo}}. Immediately thereafter ''Mont-Blanc'' caught fire, and the crew abandoned ship. The vessel drifted from near the mid-channel over to Pier 6 on the slack tide in a matter of minutes and beached herself.&lt;ref&gt;Investigation into the Halifax Explosion, RG 42-C-3-a, vol. 596 and Appeal Book and other records, RG 42-C-3-a, vol. 597, testimony of Edward McCrossan (SS ''Curacas''), Library and Archives Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; A sailor, believed to have been sent ashore by a naval officer, warned Coleman and Lovett of her cargo of high explosives.&lt;ref&gt;''Scapegoat, the extraordinary legal proceedings following the 1917 Halifax Explosion'', Joel Zemel (2012), note 80, p. 382. The only naval officer in the vicinity of Pier 6 before and after the collision with knowledge of Mont Blanc's cargo was the port convoy officer, Lieutenant James Anderson Murray (RNCVR), aboard ''Hilford''. The small tug was chartered by the RN's Port Convoy Office under the command of Rear-Admiral Bertram M. Chambers. According to the testimony of Francis Mackey, the pilot of ''Mont-Blanc'' (Appeals Book: ''Imo vs. Mont-Blanc''), ''Hilford'' was close enough to Pier 6 to put a sailor ashore quickly in order to warn people about the nature of the French ship's cargo.&lt;/ref&gt; The overnight express train No. 10 from [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], carrying nearly 300 passengers, was due to arrive at 8:55&amp;nbsp;a.m. Before leaving the office, Lovett called CGR terminal agent Henry Dustan to warn him of a burning ship laden with explosives that was heading for the pier.&lt;ref&gt;Investigation into the Halifax Explosion, RG 42-C-3-a, vol. 596 and Appeal Book and other records, RG 42-C-3-a, vol. 597, testimony of Henry Dustan, Library and Archives Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; After sending Lovett's message, Coleman and Lovett were said to have left the CGR depot. However, the dispatcher returned to the [[telegraph]] office and continued sending warning messages along the rail line as far as [[Truro, Nova Scotia|Truro]] to stop trains inbound for Halifax. An accepted version of Coleman's [[Morse code]] message reads as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Hold up the train. Ammunition ship afire in harbour making for Pier 6 and will explode. Guess this will be my last message. Good-bye boys."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maritimemuseum.novascotia.ca/what-see-do/halifax-explosion/vincent-coleman-and-halifax-explosion |title=Vincent Coleman and the Halifax Explosion |publisher=Maritime Museum of the Atlantic |date=1917-12-06 |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The telegraphed warnings were apparently heeded, as the No. 10 passenger train was stopped just before the explosion occurred. The train was halted at Rockingham Station, on the western shore of Bedford Basin, approximately {{convert|6.4|km|mi}} from the downtown terminal. After the explosion, Coleman's message, followed by other messages later sent by railway officials who made their way to Rockingham, passed word of the disaster to the rest of Canada. The railway quickly mobilized aid, sending a dozen relief trains with fire and medical help from towns in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick on the day of the disaster, followed two days later by help from other parts of Canada and from the United States, most notably [[Boston]]. Even though Lovett had left the station, both he and Coleman were killed in the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://maritimemuseum.novascotia.ca/what-see-do/halifax-explosion/vincent-coleman-and-halifax-explosion Dan Conlin, "Vincent Coleman and the Halifax Explosion", ''Maritime Museum of the Atlantic'' web page]; Nova Scotia Vital Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although historians debate whether Coleman's initial message actually contributed to stopping the No. 10 train, there is some documented evidence to indicate it did. No. 10's Conductor Gillespie reported to the ''Moncton Transcript'' that although running on time, "his train was held for fifteen minutes by the dispatcher at Rockingham."&lt;ref&gt;''Built for War: Canada's Intercolonial Railway'', Jay Underwood (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Vince Coleman was also the subject of a [[Heritage Minute]] and was a prominent character in the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] miniseries ''[[Shattered City: The Halifax Explosion]]''. The Heritage Minute and other sources contain historical inaccuracies in that Coleman is shown warning others in the area surrounding the depot station of the impending explosion. In reality the Richmond Station was surrounded by freight yards. Another error is the exaggeration of the number of passengers aboard the Saint John train. The four-car overnight passenger train contained a maximum of 300 people, not 700 as claimed in the Heritage Minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Metson, Graham|title=The Halifax Explosion|page=42|publisher=McGraw Hill Ryerson|year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warning message is also changed. Coleman's telegraph key, watch and pen are on display in the Halifax Explosion exhibit at Halifax's [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]].

Coleman is [[interred]] at [[Mount Olivet Cemetery-Halifax|Mount Olivet Cemetery in Halifax]], at the intersection of Mumford Road with Joseph Howe Drive. He was survived by his wife Frances, who lived until 1970. A street is named after him in the Clayton Park neighbourhood of Halifax, and in 2007 a section of Albert Street near his old home was renamed Vincent Street. A [[condominium]] near Mount Olivet Cemetery on Bayer's Road is named The Vincent Coleman, also in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Power|first=Bill|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/business/415960-apartment-project-started|title=Apartment project started|work=[[The Chronicle Herald]]|date=11 January 2013|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleman was inducted into the [[Canadian Railway Hall of Fame]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railfame.ca/sec_ind/heroes/en_2004_ColemanV.asp|publisher=Canadian Railway Hall of Fame|title=Vince Coleman (2004)|accessdate=13 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615064825/http://www.railfame.ca/sec_ind/heroes/en_2004_ColemanV.asp#|archive-date=15 June 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Halifax harbour [[ferry]] was named ''Vincent Coleman'', by popular vote in the spring of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=They've been acknowledged: Vince Coleman, Rita Joe chosen as new Halifax ferry names|url=http://www.metronews.ca/news/halifax/2017/06/02/vince-coleman-rita-joe-chosen-for-new-halifax-ferry-names-.html|accessdate=4 June 2017|publisher=Metro News|date=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ferry was dedicated and officially entered service in a ceremony at the Halifax ferry terminal on March 14, 2018&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/vincent-coleman-ferry-halifax-transit-dedication-1.4575836 Susan Bradley, "He loved the railway and he loved his job': Halifax ferry dedicated to Vincent Coleman", ''CBC News'' Mar 14, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;
