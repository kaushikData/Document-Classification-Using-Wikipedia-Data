{{one source|date=January 2015}}
'''''A Grammar of the Dialect of the Bolton Area''''' is a two-part dialectological book written by Graham Shorrocks, a professor at the [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]], based on a series of research projects in the 1970s and 1980s.  From 1972 to 1974 Shorrocks did fieldwork in his hometown of [[Farnworth]] supported by a grant from the [[University of Sheffield]].&lt;ref name="MUN"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mun.ca/gazette/1997-98/Apr.23/book/b01-gram.htm|title=Rev. of Shorrocks, ''A Grammar of the Dialect of the Bolton Area''|date=23 April 1998|work=Gazette|publisher=[[Memorial University of Newfoundland]]|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He later undertook further fieldwork in other parts of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Bolton|Bolton metropolitan borough]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="MUN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shorrocks (1998), p.84&lt;/ref&gt;  Part 1 was published in 1998, and Part 2 in 1999.  The book argues that grammatical variation amongst dialects of English has been underestimated.&lt;ref name="Pt1pvii"/&gt;  In the preface, the author says that the account of the morphology and syntax is "probably more detailed than the grammatical component in any other monograph devoted to a British English dialect".&lt;ref name="Pt1pvii"&gt;Shorrocks (1998), p.vii&lt;/ref&gt;

Shorrocks's technique was to get to know his informants well so that they would speak to him naturally, as they would with their friends and families.&lt;ref&gt;Shorrocks (1998), pp.101-103&lt;/ref&gt;  As he recorded his conversations, he felt that this was necessary to avoid their modifying their speech under the pressure of being recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Shorrocks (1998), pp. 110-113&lt;/ref&gt;  Shorrocks was very critical of [[sociolinguistic]] techniques, which he felt relied excessively on questionnaires and were particularly unsuitable for revealing the grammatical features that can only be recorded in flowing speech.&lt;ref&gt;Shorrocks (1998), pp.41-46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shorrocks (1999), pp.19-20&lt;/ref&gt;  Shorrocks concluded that the extent of decline in traditional dialect presented by many sociolinguists was exaggerated, and that all the grammatical features of the Bolton dialect found by the early dialectologist [[Joseph Wright (linguist)|Joseph Wright]] were still present at the time of his research in addition to a few features that Wright had not recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Shorrocks (1999), pp.257-258&lt;/ref&gt;

Shorrocks stated that the dialect of [[Bolton]], and [[Greater Manchester]] in general, has been highly stigmatised.

{{quote|A great many people in the area feel ashamed of their speech - to a degree that goes beyond what is generally appreciated.  I have personally known those who would avoid, or could never enjoy, a conversation with a stranger, because they were literally too ashamed to open their mouths.  It has been drummed into people - often in school, and certainly in society at large - that dialect speech is incorrect, impure, vulgar, clumsy, ugly, careless, shoddy, ignorant, and altogether inferior.  Furthermore, the particularly close link in recent English society between speech, especially accents, and social class and values has made local dialect a hindrance to upward social mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Shorrocks (1998), p.90&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The concept of a "Northern Regional Standard", which Shorrocks attributes to the [[Sheffield University]] dialectologist John Widdowson, is used to describe modifications made by dialect speakers when not speaking with acquaintances.&lt;ref name="Pt1p5556"&gt;Shorrocks (1998), pp.55-56&lt;/ref&gt;  Shorrocks notes that the number of speakers of [[Received Pronunciation]] in the Bolton area is very small, which restricts its influence on the base dialect.&lt;ref name="Pt1p5556"/&gt;

The phonemes described for the Bolton dialect are shown in the table below.&lt;ref&gt;Shorrocks (1998), pp.157-405&lt;/ref&gt;  {{IPA|/h/}} is shown as a marginal phoneme in the dialect, used only when stressing words or attempting to modify speech towards a standard form, and {{IPA|/x/}} is shown as a phoneme that existed in the dialect until the mid-20th century as a pronunciation of the sequence ''gh''.&lt;ref&gt;Shorrocks (1998), pp.402-403&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no phoneme {{IPA|/ŋ/}} in the Bolton dialect, although {{IPA|[ŋ]}} occurs as an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} before {{IPA|/k, g/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Shorrocks (1999), p.viii&lt;/ref&gt;

{{InfoMaps}}
In [[informal logic]] and [[philosophy]], an '''argument map''' or '''argument diagram''' is a visual representation of the structure of an [[argument]]. An argument map typically includes the key components of the argument, traditionally called the ''[[Logical consequence|conclusion]]'' and the ''[[premise]]s'', also called ''[[Main contention|contention]]'' and ''[[Reason (argument)|reason]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1991|pp=49–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argument maps can also show [[co-premise]]s, [[Objection (argument)|objection]]s, [[counterargument]]s, [[rebuttal]]s, and [[Lemma (logic)|lemma]]s. There are different styles of argument map but they are often functionally equivalent and represent an argument's individual claims and the relationships between them.

Argument maps are commonly used in the context of teaching and applying [[critical thinking]].&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Davies|2012}}; {{harvnb|Facione|2013|p=86}}; {{harvnb|Fisher|2004}}; {{harvnb|Kelley|2014|p=73}}; {{harvnb|Kunsch|Schnarr|van Tyle|2014}}; {{harvnb|Walton|2013|p=10}}; {{harvnb|van Gelder|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of mapping is to uncover the logical structure of arguments, identify unstated assumptions, evaluate the support an argument offers for a conclusion, and aid understanding of debates. Argument maps are often designed to support deliberation of issues, ideas and arguments in [[wicked problem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Culmsee|Awati|2013}}; {{harvnb|Hoffmann|Borenstein|2013}}; {{harvnb|Metcalfe|Sastrowardoyo|2013}}; Ricky Ohl, [https://books.google.com/books?id=loa4BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA360 "Computer supported argument visualisation: modelling in consultative democracy around wicked problems"], in {{harvnb|Okada|Buckingham Shum|Sherborne|2014|pp=361–380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An argument map is not to be confused with a [[concept map]] or a [[mind map]], two other kinds of [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|node–link diagram]] which have different constraints on nodes and links.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Davies|2010}}; {{harvnb|Hunter|2008}}; {{harvnb|Okada|Buckingham Shum|Sherborne|2014|pp=vii–x, 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key features==
A number of different kinds of argument map have been proposed but the most common, which Chris Reed and Glenn Rowe called the ''standard diagram'',&lt;ref name="ReedRowe64"&gt;{{harvnb|Reed|Rowe|2007|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of a [[tree structure]] with each of the reasons leading to the conclusion. There is no consensus as to whether the conclusion should be at the top of the tree with the reasons leading up to it or whether it should be at the bottom with the reasons leading down to it.&lt;ref name="ReedRowe64"/&gt; Another variation diagrams an argument from left to right.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Walton|2013|pp=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Doug Walton]] and colleagues, an argument map has two basic components: "One component is a set of circled numbers arrayed as points. Each number represents a proposition (premise or conclusion) in the argument being diagrammed. The other component is a set of lines or arrows joining the points. Each line (arrow) represents an inference. The whole network of points and lines represents a kind of overview of the reasoning in the given argument..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reed|Walton|Macagno|2007|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the introduction of software for producing argument maps, it has become common for argument maps to consist of boxes containing the actual propositions rather than numbers referencing those propositions.

There is disagreement on the terminology to be used when describing argument maps,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1991|pp=49–90}}; {{harvnb|Reed|Rowe|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ''standard diagram'' contains the following structures:

'''Dependent premises''' or '''co-premises''', where at least one of the joined premises requires another premise before it can give support to the conclusion: An argument with this structure has been called a ''linked'' argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrell|2010|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dependent premises.jpg|thumb|centre|100px|Statements 1 and 2 are dependent premises or co-premises]]

'''Independent premises''', where the premise can support the conclusion on its own: Although independent premises may jointly make the conclusion more convincing, this is to be distinguished from situations where a premise gives no support unless it is joined to another premise. Where several premises or groups of premises lead to a final conclusion the argument might be described as ''convergent''. This is distinguished from a ''divergent'' argument where a single premise might be used to support two separate conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1991|pp=91–110}}; {{harvnb|Harrell|2010|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Independent premises.jpg|thumb|centre|150px|Statements 2, 3, 4 are independent premises]]

'''Intermediate conclusions''' or '''sub-conclusions''', where a claim is supported by another claim that is used in turn to support some further claim, i.e. the final conclusion or another intermediate conclusion: In the following diagram, statement '''4''' is an intermediate conclusion in that it is a conclusion in relation to statement '''5''' but is a premise in relation to the final conclusion, i.e. statement '''1'''. An argument with this structure is sometimes called a ''complex'' argument. If there is a single chain of claims containing at least one intermediate conclusion, the argument is sometimes described as a ''serial'' argument or a ''chain'' argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beardsley|1950|pp=18–19}}; {{harvnb|Reed|Walton|Macagno|2007|pp=3–8}}; {{harvnb|Harrell|2010|pp=19–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Intermediate conclusion.jpg|thumb|centre|150px|Statement 4 is an intermediate conclusion or sub-conclusion]]

Each of these structures can be represented by the equivalent "box and line" approach to argument maps. In the following diagram, the ''contention'' is shown at the top, and the boxes linked to it represent supporting ''reasons'', which comprise one or more ''premises''. The green arrow indicates that the two ''reasons'' support the ''contention'':

[[File:A box and line diagram.png|thumb|center|A box and line diagram]]

Argument maps can also represent counterarguments. In the following diagram, the two ''objections'' weaken the ''contention'', while the ''reasons'' support the ''premise'' of the objection:

==Representing an argument as an argument map==

===Diagramming written text===
A written text can be transformed into an argument map by following a sequence of steps. [[Monroe Beardsley]]'s 1950 book ''Practical Logic'' recommended the following procedure:&lt;ref name="Beardsley"&gt;{{harvnb|Beardsley|1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Separate statements by brackets and number them.
#Put circles around the logical indicators.
#Supply, in parenthesis, any logical indicators that are left out.
#Set out the statements in a diagram in which arrows show the relationships between statements.

[[File:Diagram using Beardsley's procedure.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A diagram of the example from Beardsley's ''Practical Logic'']]

Beardsley gave the first example of a text being analysed in this way:

:Though &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;① [&lt;/span&gt;people who talk about the "social significance" of the arts don’t like to admit it&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;② [&lt;/span&gt;music and painting are bound to suffer when they are turned into mere vehicles for propaganda&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span style="width:100%; border:solid 2px blue; padding-left:5px; padding-right:5px; border-radius:25px;"&gt;For&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;③ [&lt;/span&gt;propaganda appeals to the crudest and most vulgar feelings&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(for)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;④ [&lt;/span&gt;look at the academic monstrosities produced by the official Nazi painters&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;. What is more important, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;⑤ [&lt;/span&gt;art must be an end in itself for the artist&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="width:100%; border:solid 2px blue; padding-left:5px; padding-right:5px; border-radius:25px;"&gt;because&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;⑥ [&lt;/span&gt;the artist can do the best work only in an atmosphere of complete freedom&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;.

Beardsley said that the conclusion in this example is statement ②. Statement ④ needs to be rewritten as a declarative sentence, e.g. "Academic monstrosities [were] produced by the official Nazi painters." Statement ① points out that the conclusion isn't accepted by everyone, but statement ① is omitted from the diagram because it doesn't support the conclusion. Beardsley said that the logical relation between statement ③ and statement ④ is unclear, but he proposed to diagram statement ④ as supporting statement ③.

[[File:Using Harrell's procedure.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A box and line diagram of Beardsley's example, produced using Harrell's procedure]]

More recently, philosophy professor Maralee Harrell recommended the following procedure:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrell|2010|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Identify all the claims being made by the author.
#Rewrite them as independent statements, eliminating non-essential words.
#Identify which statements are premises, sub-conclusions, and the main conclusion.
#Provide missing, implied conclusions and implied premises. (This is optional depending on the purpose of the argument map.)
#Put the statements into boxes and draw a line between any boxes that are linked.
#Indicate support from premise(s) to (sub)conclusion with arrows.

===Diagramming as thinking===
Argument maps are useful not only for representing and analyzing existing writings, but also for thinking through issues as part of a [[Problem structuring methods|problem-structuring process]] or [[writing process]].&lt;ref&gt;This is related to the distinction between "knowledge telling" and "knowledge transforming" in [[composition studies]]: see, for example, {{harvnb|Chryssafidou|2014|pp=38–39, 413}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of such argument analysis for thinking through issues has been called "reflective argumentation".&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Hoffmann|Borenstein|2013}}; {{harvnb|Hoffmann|2016}}; {{harvnb|Hoffmann|2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An argument map, unlike a [[decision tree]], does not tell how to make a decision, but the process of choosing a [[Coherentism|coherent]] position (or [[reflective equilibrium]]) based on the structure of an argument map can be represented as a decision tree.&lt;ref&gt;See section 4.2, "Argument maps as reasoning tools", in {{harvnb|Brun|Betz|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===The philosophical origins and tradition of argument mapping===
[[File:Whatley.png|thumb|From Whately's Elements of Logic p467, 1852 edition]]
In the ''Elements of Logic'', which was published in 1826 and issued in many subsequent editions,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whately|1834}} (first published 1826)&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishop [[Richard Whately]] gave probably the first form of an argument map, introducing it with the suggestion that "many students probably will find it a very clear and convenient mode of exhibiting the logical analysis of the course of argument, to draw it out in the form of a Tree, or Logical Division".

However, the technique did not become widely used, possibly because for complex arguments, it involved much writing and rewriting of the premises.

[[File:Wigmore chart.png|thumb|Wigmore evidence chart, from 1905]]
Legal philosopher and theorist [[John Henry Wigmore]] produced maps of legal arguments using numbered premises in the early 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wigmore|1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in part on the ideas of 19th century philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]] who used lines to indicate relations between terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodwin|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anglophone argument diagramming in the 20th century===
Dealing with the failure of [[Formal system|formal]] reduction of informal argumentation, English speaking [[argumentation theory]] developed diagrammatic approaches to informal reasoning over a period of fifty years.

[[Monroe Beardsley]] proposed a form of argument diagram in 1950.&lt;ref name="Beardsley"/&gt; His method of marking up an argument and representing its components with linked numbers became a standard and is still widely used. He also introduced terminology that is still current describing ''convergent'', ''divergent'' and ''serial'' arguments.

[[File:Toulmindiag.png|thumb|A [[Toulmin method|Toulmin argument diagram]], redrawn from his 1959 ''Uses of Argument'']]
[[File:Toulmingeneral.png|thumb|A generalised Toulmin diagram]]
[[Stephen Toulmin]], in his groundbreaking and influential 1958 book ''The Uses of Argument'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Toulmin|2003}} (first published 1958)&lt;/ref&gt; identified several elements to an argument which have been generalized. The [[Toulmin method|Toulmin diagram]] is widely used in educational critical teaching.&lt;ref name="Simon06"&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|Erduran|Osborne|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Böttcher|Meisert|2011}}; {{harvnb|Macagno|Konstantinidou|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst Toulmin eventually had a significant impact on the development of [[informal logic]] he had little initial impact and the Beardsley approach to diagramming arguments along with its later developments became the standard approach in this field. Toulmin introduced something that was missing from Beardsley's approach. In Beardsley, "arrows link reasons and conclusions (but) no support is given to the implication itself between them. There is no theory, in other words, of inference distinguished from logical deduction, the passage is always deemed not controversial and not subject to support and evaluation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reed|Walton|Macagno|2007|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toulmin introduced the concept of [[Warrant (rhetoric)|''warrant'']] which "can be considered as representing the reasons behind the inference, the backing that authorizes the link".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reed|Walton|Macagno|2007|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beardsley's approach was refined by Stephen N. Thomas, whose 1973 book ''Practical Reasoning In Natural Language''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1997}} (first published 1973)&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the term ''linked'' to describe arguments where the premises necessarily worked together to support the conclusion.&lt;ref name="SnoeckHenkemans"&gt;{{harvnb|Snoeck Henkemans|2000|p=453}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the actual distinction between dependent and independent premises had been made prior to this.&lt;ref name="SnoeckHenkemans"/&gt; The introduction of the linked structure made it possible for argument maps to represent missing or "hidden" premises. In addition, Thomas suggested showing reasons both ''for'' and ''against'' a conclusion with the reasons ''against'' being represented by dotted arrows. Thomas introduced the term ''argument diagram'' and defined ''basic reasons'' as those that were not supported by any others in the argument and the ''final conclusion'' as that which was not used to support any further conclusion.

[[File:Scrivendiag.png|thumb|Scriven's argument diagram. The explicit premise 1 is conjoined with additional unstated premises a and b to imply 2.]]
[[Michael Scriven]] further developed the Beardsley-Thomas approach in his 1976 book ''Reasoning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scriven|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Beardsley had said "At first, write out the statements...after a little practice, refer to the statements by number alone"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beardsley|1950|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scriven advocated clarifying the meaning of the statements, listing them and then using a tree diagram with numbers to display the structure. Missing premises (unstated assumptions) were to be included and indicated with an alphabetical letter instead of a number to mark them off from the explicit statements. Scriven introduced counterarguments in his diagrams, which Toulmin had defined as rebuttal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reed|Walton|Macagno|2007|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also enabled the diagramming of "balance of consideration" arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Eemeren|Grootendorst|Snoeck Henkemans|Blair|1996|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 a series of large-scale argument maps released by [[Robert E. Horn]] stimulated widespread interest in argument mapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holmes|1999}}; {{harvnb|Horn|1998}}; Robert E. Horn, [http://www.stanford.edu/~rhorn/a/topic/arg/artclCmptrSpArgmttn.pdf "Infrastructure for navigating interdisciplinary debates: critical decisions for representing argumentation"], in {{harvnb|Kirschner|Buckingham Shum|Carr|2003|pp=165–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of computer-supported argument visualization===
[[Human–computer interaction]] pioneer [[Douglas Engelbart]], in a famous 1962 technical report on [[intelligence augmentation]], envisioned in detail something like argument-mapping software as an integral part of future intelligence-augmenting computer interfaces:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Engelbart|1962}}; For an account of Engelbart's place in the history of computer-supported argument visualization, see, e.g., Simon Buckingham Shum, [http://simon.buckinghamshum.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/VisualizingArgumentation-Roots.pdf "The roots of computer supported argument visualization"], in {{harvnb|Kirschner|Buckingham Shum|Carr|2003|pp=3–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|You usually think of an argument as a serial sequence of steps of reason, beginning with known facts, assumptions, etc., and progressing toward a conclusion. Well, we do have to think through these steps serially, and we usually do list the steps serially when we write them out because that is pretty much the way our papers and books have to present them—they are pretty limiting in the symbol structuring they enable us to use.&amp;nbsp;... To help us get better comprehension of the structure of an argument, we can also call forth a schematic or graphical display. Once the antecedent-consequent links have been established, the computer can automatically construct such a display for us.|source=Douglas Engelbart, "Augmenting human intellect: a conceptual framework" (1962)}}

In the middle to late 1980s, [[hypertext]] [[software application]]s that supported argument visualization were developed, including [[NoteCards]] and [[gIBIS]]; the latter generated an on-screen graphical hypertextual map of an [[issue-based information system]], a model of argumentation developed by Werner Kunz and [[Horst Rittel]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Conklin|Begeman|1988}}, on [[gIBIS]]; {{harvnb|Halasz|1988}}, on [[NoteCards]]; {{harvnb|Kirschner|Buckingham Shum|Carr|2003|pp=14–15}}, on the place of both in the history of computer-supported argument visualization&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, [[Tim van Gelder]] and colleagues developed a series of software applications that permitted an argument map's premises to be fully stated and edited in the diagram, rather than in a legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Gelder|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Gelder's first program, Reason!Able, was superseded by two subsequent programs, bCisive and Rationale.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berg|van Gelder|Patterson|Teppema|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, many other software applications were developed for argument visualization. By 2013, more than 60 such software systems existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walton|2013|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the differences between these software systems is whether collaboration is supported.&lt;ref name="Scheuer10"&gt;{{harvnb|Scheuer|Loll|Pinkwart|McLaren|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Single-user argumentation systems include Convince Me, iLogos, LARGO, Athena, [[Araucaria (software)|Araucaria]], and Carneades; small group argumentation systems include Digalo, QuestMap, [[Compendium (software)|Compendium]], Belvedere, and AcademicTalk; community argumentation systems include [[Debategraph]] and [[Collaboratorium]].&lt;ref name="Scheuer10"/&gt;

==Applications==
Argument maps have been applied in many areas, but foremost in educational, academic and business settings, including [[design rationale]].&lt;ref name="Applications"&gt;{{harvnb|Kirschner|Buckingham Shum|Carr|2003}}; {{harvnb|Okada|Buckingham Shum|Sherborne|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argument maps are also used in [[forensic science]],&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Bex|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[law]], and [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Verheij|2005}}; {{harvnb|Reed|Walton|Macagno|2007}}; {{harvnb|Walton|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been proposed that argument mapping has a great potential to improve how we understand and execute democracy, in reference to the ongoing evolution of [[e-democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hilbert|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difficulties with the philosophical tradition===
It has traditionally been hard to separate teaching critical thinking from the philosophical tradition of teaching [[logic]] and method, and most critical thinking textbooks have been written by philosophers. [[Informal logic]] textbooks are replete with philosophical examples, but it is unclear whether the approach in such textbooks transfers to non-philosophy students.&lt;ref name="Simon06" /&gt; There appears to be little statistical effect after such classes. Argument mapping, however, has a measurable effect according to many studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Twardy|2004}}; {{harvnb|Álvarez Ortiz|2007}}; {{harvnb|Harrell|2008}}; Yanna Rider and Neil Thomason, [https://books.google.com/books?id=loa4BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA112 "Cognitive and pedagogical benefits of argument mapping: LAMP guides the way to better thinking"], in {{harvnb|Okada|Buckingham Shum|Sherborne|2014|pp=113–134}}; {{harvnb|Dwyer|2011}}; {{harvnb|Davies|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, instruction in argument mapping has been shown to improve the critical thinking skills of business students.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrington|Chen|Davies|Kaur|2011}}; {{harvnb|Kunsch|Schnarr|van Tyle|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence that argument mapping improves critical thinking ability===
There is empirical evidence that the skills developed in argument-mapping-based critical thinking courses substantially transfer to critical thinking done without argument maps. Alvarez's meta-analysis found that such critical thinking courses produced gains of around 0.70 SD, about twice as much as standard critical-thinking courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Álvarez Ortiz|2007|pp=69–70 ''et seq''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tests used in the reviewed studies were standard critical-thinking tests.

===How argument mapping helps with critical thinking===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2017|small=y}}
The use of argument mapping has occurred within a number of disciplines, such as philosophy, management reporting, military and intelligence analysis, and public debates.&lt;ref name="Applications"/&gt;

*''Logical structure'': Argument maps display an argument's logical structure more clearly than does the standard linear way of presenting arguments.
*''Critical thinking concepts'': In learning to argument map, students master such key critical thinking concepts as "reason", "objection", "premise", "conclusion", "inference", "rebuttal", "unstated assumption", "co-premise", "strength of evidence", "logical structure", "independent evidence", etc. Mastering such concepts is not just a matter of memorizing their definitions or even being able to apply them correctly; it is also understanding why the distinctions these words mark are important and using that understanding to guide one's reasoning.
*''Visualization'': Humans are highly visual and argument mapping may provide students with a basic set of visual schemas with which to understand argument structures.
*''More careful reading and listening'': Learning to argument map teaches people to read and listen more carefully, and highlights for them the key questions "What is the logical structure of this argument?" and "How does this sentence fit into the larger structure?" In-depth cognitive processing is thus more likely.
*''More careful writing and speaking'': Argument mapping helps people to state their reasoning and evidence more precisely, because the reasoning and evidence must fit explicitly into the map's logical structure.
*''Literal and intended meaning'': Often, many statements in an argument do not precisely assert what the author meant. Learning to argument map enhances the complex skill of distinguishing literal from intended meaning.
*''Externalization'': Writing something down and reviewing what one has written often helps reveal gaps and clarify one's thinking. Because the logical structure of argument maps is clearer than that of linear prose, the benefits of mapping will exceed those of ordinary writing.
*''Anticipating replies'': Important to critical thinking is anticipating objections and considering the plausibility of different rebuttals. Mapping develops this anticipation skill, and so improves analysis.

==Standards==

===Argument Interchange Format===
{{main|Argument Interchange Format}}
The Argument Interchange Format, AIF, is an international effort to develop a representational mechanism for exchanging argument resources between research groups, tools, and domains using a semantically rich language.&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.arg.dundee.ac.uk/people/chris/publications/2006/aif_final.pdf AIF original draft description] (2006) and the [http://www.argdf.org/source/ArgDF_Ontology.rdfs full AIF-RDF ontology specifications] in [[RDFS]] format.&lt;/ref&gt; AIF-RDF is the extended ontology represented in the [[Resource Description Framework]] Schema (RDFS) semantic language. Though AIF is still something of a moving target, it is settling down.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bex|Modgil|Prakken|Reed|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal Knowledge Interchange Format===
{{main|Legal Knowledge Interchange Format}}
The Legal Knowledge Interchange Format (LKIF)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boer|Winkels|Vitali|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed in the European ESTRELLA project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Estrella project website |url=http://www.estrellaproject.org/ |website=estrellaproject.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212103522/http://www.estrellaproject.org/ |archivedate=2016-02-12 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and designed with the goal of becoming a standard for representing and interchanging policy, legislation and cases, including their justificatory arguments, in the legal domain. LKIF builds on and uses the [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL) for representing concepts and includes a reusable basic ontology of legal concepts.

'''Biology''' is the [[natural science]] that studies [[life]] and living [[organism]]s, including their [[anatomy|physical structure]], [[Biochemistry|chemical processes]], [[Molecular biology|molecular interactions]], [[Physiology|physiological mechanisms]], [[Developmental biology|development]] and [[evolution]].&lt;ref name=aquarenagloss&gt;Based on definition from: {{cite web |url=http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~wetlands/Glossary/glossary.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608113114/http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~wetlands/Glossary/glossary.html |archivedate=2004-06-08 |title=Aquarena Wetlands Project glossary of terms |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;  |publisher=Texas State University at San Marcos}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the complexity of the science, there are certain unifying concepts that consolidate it into a single, coherent field. Biology recognizes the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] as the basic unit of life, [[genes]] as the basic unit of [[heredity]], and [[evolution]] as the engine that propels the [[Speciation|creation]] and [[extinction]] of [[species]]. [[Organism|Living organisms]] are [[Thermodynamic system|open systems]] that survive by transforming [[energy]] and decreasing their local [[entropy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Davies, PC; Rieper, E; Tuszynski, JA | title=Self-organization and entropy reduction in a living cell | journal=Bio Systems | volume=111 | issue=1 | pages=1–10 | date=January 2013 | pmid=23159919 | pmc=3712629 | doi=10.1016/j.biosystems.2012.10.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to maintain a stable and vital condition defined as [[homeostasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Modell|first=Harold|last2=Cliff|first2=William|last3=Michael|first3=Joel|last4=McFarland|first4=Jenny|last5=Wenderoth|first5=Mary Pat|last6=Wright|first6=Ann|date=December 2015|title=A physiologist's view of homeostasis|journal=Advances in Physiology Education|volume=39|issue=4|pages=259–66|doi=10.1152/advan.00107.2015|issn=1043-4046|pmc=4669363|pmid=26628646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[wikt:biology|biology]]'' is derived from the [[Greek Language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|[[wikt:βίος|βίος]]}}, ''bios'', "[[life]]" and the suffix {{lang|grc|[[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''-logia'', "study of."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://topics.info.com/Who-coined-the-term-biology_716 |title=Who coined the term biology? |work=Info.com |accessdate=2012-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509211839/http://topics.info.com/Who-coined-the-term-biology_716 |archivedate=2013-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web | title=biology | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=biology&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 | publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307163258/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=biology&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 | archivedate=2013-03-07 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin-language form of the term first appeared in 1736 when Swedish scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]] (Carl von Linné) used ''biologi'' in his ''Bibliotheca botanica''. It was used again in 1766 in a work entitled ''Philosophiae naturalis sive physicae: tomus III, continens geologian, biologian, phytologian generalis'', by [[Michael Christoph Hanow|Michael Christoph Hanov]], a disciple of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]. The first German use, ''Biologie'', was in a 1771 translation of Linnaeus' work. In 1797, Theodor Georg August Roose used the term in the preface of a book, ''Grundzüge der Lehre van der Lebenskraft''. [[Karl Friedrich Burdach]] used the term in 1800 in a more restricted sense of the study of human beings from a morphological, physiological and psychological perspective (''Propädeutik zum Studien der gesammten Heilkunst''). The term came into its modern usage with the six-volume treatise ''Biologie, oder Philosophie der lebenden Natur'' (1802–22) by [[Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus]], who announced:&lt;ref name=Richards&gt;{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Robert J. |title=The Romantic Conception of Life: Science and Philosophy in the Age of Goethe|year=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press | isbn= 978-0226712109 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=X7N4_i7vrTUC&amp;printsec=frontcover }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The objects of our research will be the different forms and manifestations of life, the conditions and laws under which these phenomena occur, and the causes through which they have been effected. The science that concerns itself with these objects we will indicate by the name biology [Biologie] or the doctrine of life [Lebenslehre].

Although modern biology is a relatively recent development, sciences related to and included within it have been studied since ancient times. [[Natural philosophy]] was studied as early as the ancient civilizations of [[Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]], the [[Indian subcontinent]], and [[China]]. However, the origins of modern biology and its approach to the study of nature are most often traced back to [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Magner|first=Lois N.|title=A History of the Life Sciences, Revised and Expanded|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC|year=2002|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0203911006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324125937/http://books.google.com/books?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC|archivedate=2015-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Anthony | last=Serafini |title=The Epic History of Biology |date=2013 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z3oECAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;q=biology%20egypt|accessdate=14 July 2015| isbn=978-1489963277 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the formal study of [[medicine]] dates back to [[Hippocrates]] (ca. 460–370 BC), it was [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) who contributed most extensively to the development of biology. Especially important are his ''[[History of Animals]]'' and other works where he showed naturalist leanings, and later more empirical works that focused on biological causation and the diversity of life. Aristotle's successor at the [[Lyceum]], [[Theophrastus]], wrote a series of books on [[botany]] that survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to the plant sciences, even into the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Theophrastus|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars of the [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|medieval Islamic world]] who wrote on biology included [[al-Jahiz]] (781–869), [[Al-Dīnawarī]] (828–896), who wrote on botany,&lt;ref name="Fahd-815"&gt;{{cite book | last=Fahd | first=Toufic |contribution=Botany and agriculture|page=815|ref=harv|editor-last1=Morelon |editor-first1=Régis |editor-last2=Rashed |editor-first2=Roshdi |year=1996 |title=Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science |volume=3 |publisher=[[Routledge]] | isbn=978-0415124102| title-link=Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi|Rhazes]] (865–925) who wrote on [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]]. [[Medicine]] was especially well studied by Islamic scholars working in Greek philosopher traditions, while natural history drew heavily on Aristotelian thought, especially in upholding a fixed hierarchy of life.

Biology began to quickly develop and grow with [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]]'s dramatic improvement of the [[microscope]]. It was then that scholars discovered [[spermatozoa]], [[bacteria]], [[infusoria]] and the diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by [[Jan Swammerdam]] led to new interest in [[entomology]] and helped to develop the basic techniques of microscopic [[dissection]] and [[staining]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Magner |first=Lois N. |title=A History of the Life Sciences, Revised and Expanded |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC |year=2002 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0203911006 |pages=133–44 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324125937/http://books.google.com/books?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC |archivedate=2015-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in [[microscopy]] also had a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the [[cell (biology)|cell]]. Then, in 1838, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann|Schwann]] began promoting the now universal ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of [[life]], although they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. Thanks to the work of [[Robert Remak]] and [[Rudolf Virchow]], however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be known as [[cell theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jan | last=Sapp | authorlink=Jan Sapp | year=2003 | title=Genesis: The Evolution of Biology | chapter=7 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=New York. | isbn=978-0195156188 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Coleman | first=William  | year=1977 | title=Biology in the Nineteenth Century: Problems of Form, Function, and Transformation | chapter=| publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=New York | isbn=978-0521292931 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, taxonomy and classification became the focus of natural historians. [[Carl Linnaeus]] published a basic [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] for the natural world in 1735 (variations of which have been in use ever since), and in the 1750s introduced [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] for all his species.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst. ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]], treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable—even suggesting the possibility of [[common descent]]. Although he was opposed to evolution, Buffon is a key figure in the [[history of evolutionary thought]]; his work influenced the evolutionary theories of both [[Lamarck]] and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst. ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Serious evolutionary thinking originated with the works of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], who was the first to present a coherent theory of evolution.&lt;ref name="Gould 2002 187"&gt;[[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould, Stephen Jay]]. ''The Structure of Evolutionary Theory''.

Lamarck believed that these acquired traits could then be passed on to the animal's offspring, who would further develop and perfect them.&lt;ref name=Lam1914&gt;[[#Lamarck1914|Lamarck (1914)]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was the British naturalist [[Charles Darwin]], combining the biogeographical approach of [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]], the uniformitarian geology of [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]], [[Thomas Malthus|Malthus's]] writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise and extensive natural observations, who forged a more successful evolutionary theory based on [[natural selection]]; similar reasoning and evidence led [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] to independently reach the same conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst.

The discovery of the physical representation of heredity came along with evolutionary principles and [[population genetics]]. In the 1940s and early 1950s, experiments pointed to [[DNA]] as the component of [[chromosomes]] that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as [[genes]]. A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as [[viruses]] and [[bacteria]], along with the discovery of the double helical structure of DNA in 1953, marked the transition to the era of [[molecular genetics]]. From the 1950s to present times, biology has been vastly extended in the [[Molecular Biology|molecular]] domain. The [[genetic code]] was cracked by [[Har Gobind Khorana]], [[Robert W. Holley]] and [[Marshall Warren Nirenberg]] after DNA was understood to contain [[codons]]. Finally, the [[Human Genome Project]] was launched in 1990 with the goal of mapping the general human [[genome]]. This project was essentially completed in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2940601.stm | title=Human genome finally complete | accessdate=2006-07-22 | date=2003-04-14 | work=BBC News | first=Ivan | last=Noble | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614141605/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2940601.stm | archivedate=2006-06-14 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with further analysis still being published. The Human Genome Project was the first step in a globalized effort to incorporate accumulated knowledge of biology into a functional, molecular definition of the human body and the bodies of other organisms.

==Foundations of modern biology==

===Cell theory===

{{Main|Cell theory}}

Cell theory states that the [[cell (biology)|cell]] is the fundamental unit of [[life]], that all living things are composed of one or more cells, and that all cells arise from pre-existing cells through [[cell division]]. In [[multicellular organisms]], every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a [[zygote|single cell]] in a fertilized [[egg (biology)|egg]]. The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Mazzarello, P | title=A unifying concept: the history of cell theory | journal=Nature Cell Biology | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=E13–15 | date=May 1999 | pmid=10559875 | doi=10.1038/8964}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the phenomenon of [[energy transfer|energy flow]] occurs in cells in processes that are part of the function known as [[metabolism]]. Finally, cells contain hereditary information ([[DNA]]), which is passed from cell to cell during cell division. Research into the origin of life, [[abiogenesis]], amounts to an attempt to discover the origin of the first cells.

===Evolution===

{{Main|Evolution}}
A central organizing concept in biology is that life changes and develops through evolution, and that all life-forms known have a [[Common descent|common origin]]. The theory of evolution postulates that all [[organism]]s on the [[Earth]], both living and extinct, have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral [[gene pool]]. This [[last universal common ancestor of all organisms|universal common ancestor of all organisms]] is believed to have appeared about [[Timeline of evolution|3.5 billion years ago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Life Evolving: Molecules, Mind, and Meaning | last=De Duve | first=Christian | location=New York | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2002| page=44 | isbn=978-0195156058}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologists regard the ubiquity of the [[genetic code]] as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[archaea]], and [[eukaryote]]s (see: [[origin of life]]).&lt;ref name="Futuyma"&gt;{{cite book| author=Futuyma, DJ |title=Evolution |year=2005 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |isbn=978-0878931873 |oclc=57311264 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued with a singularly rigorous consistency but it is also eloquent, imaginatively evocative, and rhetorically compelling."  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Alfred Russel Wallace]] is recognized as the co-discoverer of this concept as he helped research and experiment with the concept of evolution.)&lt;ref&gt;Shermer p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution is now used to explain the great variations of life found on Earth.

Darwin theorized that species flourish or die when subjected to the processes of [[natural selection]] or [[selective breeding]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]] (1859). ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetic drift]] was embraced as an additional mechanism of evolutionary development in the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of the theory.&lt;ref name=GGS&gt;{{Cite book | last=Simpson | first=George Gaylord | author-link=George Gaylord Simpson | year=1967 | title=The Meaning of Evolution | publisher=Yale University Press | edition=Second | isbn=978-0300009521 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary history of the [[species]]—which describes the characteristics of the various species from which it descended—together with its genealogical relationship to every other species is known as its [[phylogeny]]. Widely varied approaches to biology generate information about phylogeny. These include the comparisons of [[DNA sequence]]s, a product of [[molecular biology]] (more particularly [[genomics]]), and comparisons of [[fossil]]s or other records of ancient organisms, a product of [[paleontology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bio-medicine.org/q-more/biology-definition/phylogeny/ |title=Phylogeny |publisher=Bio-medicine.org |date=2007-11-11 |accessdate=2013-10-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224700/http://www.bio-medicine.org/q-more/biology-definition/phylogeny/ |archivedate=2013-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologists organize and analyze evolutionary relationships through various methods, including [[phylogenetics]], [[phenetics]], and [[cladistics]]. (For a summary of major events in the evolution of life as currently understood by biologists, see [[evolutionary timeline]].)

Evolution is relevant to the understanding of the natural history of life forms and to the understanding of the organization of current life forms. But, those organizations can only be understood in the light of how they came to be by way of the process of evolution. Consequently, evolution is central to all fields of biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Montévil, M; Mossio, M; Pocheville, A; Longo, G | title=Theoretical principles for biology: Variation | journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology | volume=122 | issue=1 | pages=36–50 | date=October 2016 | pmid=27530930 | doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.08.005 | url=https://www.academia.edu/27942089 | series=From the Century of the Genome to the Century of the Organism: New Theoretical Approaches | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320150224/http://www.academia.edu/27942089/Theoretical_principles_for_biology_Variation | archivedate=2018-03-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Genetics}}
[[Gene]]s are the primary units of inheritance in all organisms. A gene is a unit of [[heredity]] and corresponds to a region of [[DNA]] that influences the form or function of an organism in specific ways. All organisms, from bacteria to animals, share the same basic machinery that copies and translates DNA into [[protein]]s. Cells [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribe]] a DNA gene into an [[RNA]] version of the gene, and a [[ribosome]] then [[Translation (biology)|translates]] the RNA into a sequence of [[amino acid]]s known as a protein. The [[genetic code|translation code]] from RNA codon to amino acid is the same for most organisms. For example, a sequence of DNA that codes for [[insulin]] in humans also codes for insulin when inserted into other organisms, such as plants.&lt;ref&gt;Marcial, Gene G.

DNA is found as linear [[chromosome]]s in [[eukaryote]]s, and circular chromosomes in [[prokaryote]]s. A chromosome is an organized structure consisting of [[DNA]] and [[histone]]s. The set of chromosomes in a cell and any other hereditary information found in the [[mitochondria]], [[chloroplasts]], or other locations is collectively known as a cell's [[genome]]. In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is localized in the [[cell nucleus]], or with small amounts in [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the [[nucleoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Thanbichler, M; Wang, SC; Shapiro, L | title=The bacterial nucleoid: a highly organized and dynamic structure | journal=Journal of Cellular Biochemistry | volume=96 | issue=3 | pages=506–21 | date=October 2005 | pmid=15988757 | doi=10.1002/jcb.20519 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete assemblage of this information in an organism is called its [[genotype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8472 |title=Genotype definition – Medical Dictionary definitions |publisher=Medterms.com |date=2012-03-19 |accessdate=2013-10-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054803/http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8472 |archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homeostasis===

[[File:ACTH Negative Feedback.svg|right|thumb|alt=diagram showing feedback loop of hormones|The [[hypothalamus]] secretes [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone|CRH]], which directs the [[pituitary gland]] to secrete [[ACTH]]. In turn, ACTH directs the adrenal cortex to secrete [[glucocorticoid]]s, such as [[cortisol]].

Homeostasis is the ability of an [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]] to regulate its internal environment to maintain stable conditions by means of multiple [[dynamic equilibrium]] adjustments that are controlled by interrelated regulation mechanisms. All living [[organism]]s, whether [[Single celled|unicellular]] or [[multicellular]], exhibit homeostasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rodolfo | first=Kelvin | date=January 2000 | url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-homeostasis/ | title=What is homeostasis? | journal=Scientific American | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020456/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=what-is-homeostasis | archivedate=2013-12-03 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To maintain dynamic equilibrium and effectively carry out certain functions, a system must detect and respond to perturbations. After the detection of a perturbation, a biological system normally responds through [[negative feedback]] that stabilize conditions by reducing or increasing the activity of an organ or system. One example is the release of [[glucagon]] when sugar levels are too low.

[[File:Energy and life.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|alt=diagram showing human energy process from food input to heat and waste output|Basic overview of [[Bioenergetics|energy and human life]].]]

===Energy===
The survival of a living organism depends on the continuous input of [[energy]]. Chemical reactions that are responsible for its structure and function are tuned to extract [[Chemistry#Energy|energy]] from substances that act as its food and transform them to help form new cells and sustain them. In this process, [[molecule]]s of [[chemical substance]]s that constitute [[food]] play two roles; first, they contain energy that can be transformed and reused in that organism's biological, [[chemical reaction]]s; second, food can be transformed into new molecular structures (biomolecules) that are of use to that organism.

The organisms responsible for the introduction of energy into an ecosystem are known as producers or [[autotroph]]s. Nearly all such organisms originally draw their energy from the sun.&lt;ref name=bryantfrigaard&gt;{{cite journal | author=Bryant, DA; Frigaard, NU | title=Prokaryotic photosynthesis and phototrophy illuminated | journal=Trends in Microbiology | volume=14 | issue=11 | pages=488–96 | date=November 2006 | pmid=16997562 | doi=10.1016/j.tim.2006.09.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants and other [[phototroph]]s use solar energy via a process known as [[photosynthesis]] to convert raw materials into organic molecules, such as [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], whose bonds can be broken to release energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Smith, AL |title=Oxford dictionary of biochemistry and molecular biology |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1997 |page=508 | isbn=978-0198547686 | quote=Photosynthesis – the synthesis by organisms of organic chemical compounds, esp. carbohydrates, from carbon dioxide using energy obtained from light rather than the oxidation of chemical compounds.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few [[ecosystems]], however, depend entirely on energy extracted by [[chemotroph]]s from [[methane]], [[sulfides]], or other non-[[Solar energy|luminal]] energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Edwards | first=Katrina | title=Microbiology of a Sediment Pond and the Underlying Young, Cold, Hydrologically Active Ridge Flank | journal=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the energy thus captured produces [[biomass]] and energy that is available for growth and development of other [[life]] forms. The majority of the rest of this biomass and energy are lost as waste molecules and heat. The most important processes for converting the energy trapped in chemical substances into energy useful to sustain life are [[metabolism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Campbell | first1=Neil A. | last2=Reece | first2=Jane B.  |title=Biology |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |year=2001 |chapter=6|isbn=978-0805366242 |oclc=47521441}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cellular respiration]].&lt;ref name="Colvard, 2009"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Bartsch | first1=John | last2=Colvard | first2=Mary P. | year=2009 | title=The Living Environment | location=New York State | publisher=Prentice Hall | isbn=978-0133612028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physiological===
{{Main|Physiology}}

Physiology is the study of the mechanical, physical, and biochemical processes of living organisms function as a whole. The theme of "structure to function" is central to biology. Physiological studies have traditionally been divided into [[plant physiology]] and [[animal physiology]], but some principles of physiology are universal, no matter what particular [[organism]] is being studied. For example, what is learned about the physiology of [[yeast]] cells can also apply to human cells. The field of animal physiology extends the tools and methods of [[human physiology]] to non-human species. Plant physiology borrows techniques from both research fields.

Physiology is the study the interaction of how, for example, the [[nervous system|nervous]], [[immune system|immune]], [[endocrine system|endocrine]], [[respiratory system|respiratory]], and [[circulatory system|circulatory]] systems, function and interact. The study of these systems is shared with such [[medicine|medically]] oriented disciplines as [[neurology]] and [[immunology]].

===Evolutionary===
[[Current research in evolutionary biology|Evolutionary research]] is concerned with the origin and descent of [[species]], and their change over time. It employs scientists from many taxonomically oriented disciplines, for example, those with special training in particular [[organism]]s such as [[mammalogy]], [[ornithology]], [[botany]], or [[herpetology]], but are of use in answering more general questions about evolution.

Evolutionary biology is partly based on [[paleontology]], which uses the [[fossil]] record to answer questions about the mode and tempo of evolution,&lt;ref name=Jablonski&gt;{{cite journal | author=Jablonski D | title=The future of the fossil record | journal=Science | volume=284 | issue=5423 | pages=2114–16 | date=June 1999 | pmid=10381868 | doi=10.1126/science.284.5423.2114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and partly on the developments in areas such as [[population genetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gillespie | first=John H. | authorlink=John H.

{{Main|Systematics}}

Multiple [[speciation]] events create a tree structured system of relationships between species. The role of [[systematics]] is to study these relationships and thus the differences and similarities between species and groups of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Neill | first=Campbell | title=Biology; Fourth edition | publisher=The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company | year=1996 | isbn=978-0805319408 | page=G-21 (Glossary) }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, systematics was an active field of research long before evolutionary thinking was common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Douglas | first=Futuyma |authorlink=Douglas Futuyma | title=Evolutionary Biology; Third edition | publisher=[[Sinauer Associates]] | year=1998 | isbn=978-0878931897 | page=88 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, living things have been divided into five kingdoms: [[Monera]]; [[Protist]]a; [[Fungus|Fungi]]; [[Plant]]ae; [[Animal]]ia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Margulis, Lynn; Schwartz, KV |author-link1= Lynn Margulis |title=Five Kingdoms: An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth |edition=3rd |publisher= WH Freeman &amp; Co|year=1997 |isbn=978-0716731832 |oclc=223623098}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many scientists now consider this five-kingdom system outdated. Modern alternative classification systems generally begin with the [[three-domain system]]: [[Archaea]] (originally Archaebacteria); [[Bacteria]] (originally Eubacteria) and [[Eukaryote|Eukaryota]] (including [[protist]]s, [[fungi]], [[plants]], and [[animal]]s)&lt;ref name="domain"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Woese, CR; Kandler, O; Wheelis, ML | title=Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=87 | issue=12 | pages=4576–79 | date=June 1990 | pmid=2112744 | pmc=54159 | doi=10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 | bibcode=1990PNAS...87.4576W }}&lt;/ref&gt; These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the chemical composition of key biomolecules such as [[ribosome]]s.&lt;ref name="domain"/&gt;

Further, each kingdom is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is:
[[Domain (biology)|Domain]]; [[Kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]]; [[Phylum]]; [[Class (biology)|Class]]; [[Order (biology)|Order]]; [[Family (biology)|Family]]; [[Genus]]; [[Species]].

Outside of these categories, there are obligate intracellular [[parasite]]s that are "on the edge of life"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rybicki, EP | year=1990 | title=The classification of organisms at the edge of life, or problems with virus systematics | journal=S Afr J Sci | volume=86 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230603479 | pages=182–86 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170718162450/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230603479_The_classification_of_organisms_at_the_edge_of_life_or_problems_with_virus_systematics | archivedate=2017-07-18 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of [[metabolism|metabolic]] activity, meaning that many scientists do not actually classify such structures as alive, due to their lack of at least one or more of the fundamental functions or characteristics that define life. They are classified as [[virus (biology)|viruses]], [[viroid]]s, [[prion]]s, or [[Satellite (biology)|satellites]].

The scientific name of an organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. ''Homo'' is the genus, and ''sapiens'' the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the species in lowercase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=McNeill, J|author2=Barrie, FR|author3=Buck, WR|author4=Demoulin, V|author5=Greuter, W|author6=Hawksworth, DL|author7=Herendeen, PS|author8=Knapp, S|author9=Marhold, K|author10=Prado, J|author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, WF|author12=Smith, GF|author13=Wiersema, JH|author14=Turland, NJ |display-authors=6 |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G.

The dominant classification system is called the [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. It includes ranks and [[binomial nomenclature]]. How organisms are named is governed by international agreements such as the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN), the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN), and the [[International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria]] (ICNB). The classification of [[viruses]], [[viroids]], [[prions]], and all other sub-viral agents that demonstrate biological characteristics is conducted by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) and is known as the International Code of Viral Classification and Nomenclature (ICVCN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp |title=ICTV Virus Taxonomy 2009 |publisher=Ictvonline.org |accessdate=2013-10-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004225742/http://www.ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp |archivedate=2013-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ictvdbpopsi&gt;&lt;!--citation specified in source--&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20090813214826/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/Ictv/fs_pospi.htm Index of Viruses – Pospiviroidae]'' (2006).

A merging draft, BioCode, was published in 1997 in an attempt to standardize nomenclature in these three areas, but has yet to be formally adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=The BioCode: Integrated biological nomenclature for the 21st century? | booktitle=Proceedings of a Mini-Symposium on Biological Nomenclature in the 21st Century | last=McNeill | first=John | date=November 1996 | url=http://www.plantsystematics.org/reveal/pbio/nomcl/mcne.html | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140104161223/http://www.plantsystematics.org/reveal/pbio/nomcl/mcne.html | archivedate=2014-01-04 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BioCode draft has received little attention since 1997; its originally planned implementation date of January 1, 2000, has passed unnoticed.

The [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|ICVCN]] remains outside the BioCode, which does not include viral classification.

{{Main|Ecology|Ethology|Behavior|Biogeography}}

[[Ecology]] is the study of the distribution and abundance of [[life|living organisms]], the interaction between them and their [[natural environment|environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Begon, M; Townsend, CR; Harper, JL | title=Ecology: From individuals to ecosystems. (4th ed.) |year=2006 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-1405111171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An organism shares an environment that includes other organisms and [[biotic factors]] as well as local [[abiotic factors]] (non-living) such as [[climate]] and [[ecology]].&lt;ref name="habitats_of_the_world"&gt;{{cite book | title=Habitats of the world | year=2004 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=U-_mlcy8rGgC&amp;pg=PA238 | publisher=Marshall Cavendish | location=New York | isbn=978-0761475231 | page=238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible, even on small scales. A microscopic [[bacterium]] responding to a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African [[savanna]]. For any species, [[behavior]]s can be [[co-operation|co-operative]], [[Competition (biology)|competitive]], [[parasite|parasitic]], or [[symbiosis|symbiotic]]. Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an [[ecosystem]].

Ecological systems are studied at several different levels, from the scale of the ecology of individual organisms, to those of [[population]]s, to the [[ecosystem]]s and finally the [[biosphere]]. The term [[population biology]] is often used interchangeably with [[population ecology]], although ''population biology'' is more frequently used in the case of [[diseases]], [[viruses]], and [[microbes]], while the term population ecology is more commonly applied to the study of plants and animals. Ecology draws on many subdisciplines.

[[Ethology]] is the study of animal [[behavior]] (particularly that of social animals such as [[primate]]s and [[canidae|canids]]), and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology. Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the [[evolution]] of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of [[natural selection]]. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was [[Charles Darwin]], whose book, ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]],'' influenced many ethologists to come.&lt;ref name="black"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Black, J | title=Darwin in the world of emotions | journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume=95 | issue=6 | pages=311–13 | date=June 2002 | pmid=12042386 | pmc=1279921 | doi=10.1258/jrsm.95.6.311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biogeography]] studies the spatial distribution of organisms on the [[Earth]], focusing on such topics as [[plate tectonics]], [[climate change]], [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] and [[Animal migration|migration]], and [[cladistics]].

==Basic unresolved problems in biology==
{{Main|List of unsolved problems in biology}}
Despite the profound advances made over recent decades in our understanding of life's fundamental processes, some basic problems have remained unresolved. One of the major unresolved problems in biology is the primary adaptive function of sex, and particularly its key processes in eukaryotes of meiosis and homologous recombination. One view is that sex evolved primarily as an adaptation that promoted increased genetic diversity (see references e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Otto, SP; Gerstein, AC | title=Why have sex? The population genetics of sex and recombination | journal=Biochemical Society Transactions | volume=34 | issue=Pt 4 | pages=519–22 | date=August 2006 | pmid=16856849 | pmc= | doi=10.1042/BST0340519 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Agrawal, AF | title=Evolution of sex: why do organisms shuffle their genotypes? | journal=Current Biology | volume=16 | issue=17 | pages=R696–704 | date=September 2006 | pmid=16950096 | pmc= | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.07.063 | bibcode=1996CBio....6.1213A }}&lt;/ref&gt;). An alternative view is that sex is an adaptation for promoting accurate DNA repair in germ-line DNA, and that increased genetic diversity is primarily a byproduct that may be useful in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Bernstein | first1=Harris | last2=Bernstein | first2=Carol | last3=Michod | first3=Richard E. | year=2011 | chapter-url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/dna-repair/meiosis-as-an-evolutionary-adaptation-for-dna-repair | chapter=Meiosis as an Evolutionary Adaptation for DNA Repair Chapter 19 | title=DNA Repair | editor-first=Inna | editor-last=Kruman editor | publisher=InTech | doi=10.5772/25117 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616090717/http://www.intechopen.com/books/dna-repair/meiosis-as-an-evolutionary-adaptation-for-dna-repair | archivedate=2013-06-16 | df= | isbn=978-9533076973 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hörandl | first=Elvira | date=2013 | chapter-url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/meiosis/meiosis-and-the-paradox-of-sex-in-nature | chapter=Meiosis and the Paradox of Sex in Nature | title=Meiosis | editor-first=Carol | editor-last=Bernstein | isbn=978-9535111979 | journal=InTech | doi=10.5772/56542 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190537/http://www.intechopen.com/books/meiosis/meiosis-and-the-paradox-of-sex-in-nature | archivedate=2013-10-29 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Evolution of sexual reproduction]]).

Another basic unresolved problem in biology is the biologic basis of aging. At present, there is no consensus view on the underlying cause of aging. Various competing theories are outlined in [[Ageing#Theories|Ageing Theories]].

'''Bundeli''' ([[Devanagari]]: बुन्देली or बुंदेली;  or '''Bundelkhandi''', is a [[Indo-Aryan language]]  spoken in the [[Bundelkhand]] region of central [[India]]. It belongs to the Central Indo-Ayran languages and is part of the [[Western Hindi]] subgroup.

==Classification==
A descendant of the [[Sauraseni]] [[Apabhramsa language|Apabhramsha]] language, Bundeli was classified under [[Western Hindi]] by [[George Abraham Grierson]] in his [[Linguistic Survey of India]].&lt;ref&gt;http://dsal.uchicago.edu/books/lsi/lsi.php?volume=9-1&amp;pages=843#page/103/mode/1up&lt;/ref&gt;. Bundeli is also closely related to [[Braj Bhasha]], which was the foremost literary language in central India until the nineteenth century.

Like many other [[Indo-Aryan languages]], Bundeli has often been subject to a designation as a [[dialect]], instead of a [[language]]. Furthermore, as is the case with other [[Hindi languages]], Bundeli speakers have been conflated with those of [[Hindi|Standard Hindi]] in censuses.

Grierson divided Bundeli into four dialect groups:&lt;ref&gt;{{Linguistic Survey of India|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Standard Bundeli
* Northeast Bundeli (closely related to [[Bagheli]])
* Northwest Bundeli (similar to [[Braj Bhasha]])
* South Bundeli

==Geographical distribution==
The [[Bundelkhand]] region comprises regions of [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Madhya Pradesh]]. Bundeli is spoken in the [[Chatarpur district|Chattarpur]],[[Rath, India|Rath,]] [[Panna district|Panna]], [[Tikamgarh district|Tikamgarh]], [[Banda district|Banda]], [[Hamirpur district, Uttar Pradesh|Hamirpur]], [[Jalaun district|Jalaun]], [[Jhansi district|Jhansi]], [[Gwalior district|Gwalior]], [[Vidisha district|Vidisha]], [[Bhopal district|Bhopal]], [[Sagar district|Sagar]], [[Damoh District|Damoh]], [[Ashoknagar District|Ashoknagar]], [[Jabalpur district|Jabalpur]], [[Lalitpur District, India|Lalitpur]], [[Chitrakoot district|Chitrakoot]], [[Mahoba district|Mahoba]] districts.

==History==
In the past Bundeli was used in government correspondences, messages, invoices, gazette and friendship treaties.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Early examples of Bundelkhandi literature are the verses of [[Bhaddari]] as well as versions of the [[Alha-Khand]] epic. It is still preserved by bards in the Banaphari region. The epic is about heroes lived in the 12th century AD. The poed Chand Bardai, wrote this epic based on King Prithiviraj's wars with state of Mahoba. Many literary works in Bundheli were produced during the reign of Emperor [[Akbar]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Notable figures are the poet [[Kesab Das]] of the 16th century, while Padmakar Bhatt and Prajnes wrote several works during the 19th century. Prannath and Lal Kabi, produced many works in Bundheli language at the court of Chhattarsal of Panna.&lt;ref&gt;http://dsal.uchicago.edu/books/lsi/lsi.php?volume=9-1&amp;pages=843#page/110/mode/1up&lt;/ref&gt;

'''C.H. Mohammed Koya''' (15 July 1927 – 28 September 1983) was an Indian politician who served as the tenth [[Chief Minister of Kerala]] from 12 October to 1 December 1979. He was the leader of the [[Indian Union Muslim League]].

==Political career==
He experienced his first taste of politics right from his high school. He was actively involved with the [[Indian Union Muslim League|IUML]]. In his early years, he served a short term in the Kurumpranad District Muslim League committee and later in the Municipal Office in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]].

In 1951, he was elected to the National Executive of the [[IUML]] and shortly afterwards, was elected the Councilor of [[Kozhikode|Calicut Municipality]]. C.H.Mohammed Koya defeated K.P.Kuttikrishnan Nair (''Kuttiettan'' – as he was popularly known) of the [[Indian National Congress]]. The latter had earlier defeated two of the most popular politicians in Kerala, [[E.M.S. Namboodiripad]] and [[Seethi Sahib]] earning him the nickname the ''Giant-Killer'' from [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]. Kuttiettan and his best friend C.K.Govindan Nair (CKG) were the Congress leaders who had even outrightly rejected Nehru's mandates regarding candidature in Kerala, openly holding that as the State Congress Committee leaders, they knew whom to field and they do not need advice from the AICC (the High Command).

His chief mentor, both in his personal life and political career was Syed Abdur Rahman Bafaqi Thangal, to whom he was indebted for all his achievements.

Mohammed Koya was elected into the [[Kerala Legislative Assembly]] from the [[Tanur, India|Tanur]] constituency in 1957 and again in 1960.  On 9 June 1961 he became the  [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the [[Kerala Legislative Assembly]] after the sudden demise of  [[Seethi Sahib|K.M.Seethi Sahib]]. Despite being one of the youngest members in the Assembly, he was known for his charisma and the flair with which he discharged his duties.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

When Muslim league quit the political alliance at State level, Mohammed Koya resigned Speakership and contested the ensuing Parliamentary Poll successfully from the [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] constituency . Again, in the State Assembly elections held in 1967, he won by a vast majority, contesting from [[Mankada]] constituency. He was the Education Minister in the cabinet headed by Shri [[E.M.S. Namboodiripad]]. He continued to retain his Education portfolio in succeeding ministries headed by [[C. Achutha Menon]], [[K. Karunakaran]], [[A.K. Antony]] till the Ninth ministry headed by [[P.K. Vasudevan Nair]]. As Education minister he was instrumental in formulating many plans that has helped Kerala reach the forefront in the education sector in [[India]]. {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

On 12 October 1979 C.H.Mohammed Koya became the Chief Minister of Kerala and his term continued to 1 December 1979. He was the shortest serving Chief Minister of Kerala. He was the [[Deputy Chief Minister]] in the next [[United Democratic Front (India)|United Democratic Front]](UDF) ministry headed by [[K.Karunakaran]]. Continuing in the seat even after the ministry was re-constituted in 1982, after the General Election, Shri.  Koya stayed there till his untimely demise in the ensuing year.

Koya died on 28 September 1983 at the Institute of Medical Sciences, [[Hyderabad]] due to a massive [[cerebral haemorrhage]]. He reached Hyderabad for attending a public function, and stayed in the veteran actor-cum-then [[Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh|Chief Minister]] [[N. T. Rama Rao]]'s home. Despite being a heavy [[diabetes|diabetic]], he consumed high amount of payasam, and thus it led to the massive haemorrhage which finally killed him. His dead body was taken back to Kerala, and was buried with full state honours. He was then survived by his mother, wife, and three children – two daughters and one son ([[M. K. Muneer]]). Now, only the children are left.

The '''Central Maluku languages''' are a putative group of fifty [[Austronesian languages]] (geographically [[Central–Eastern Malayo-Polynesian languages]]) spoken principally on the [[Seram]], [[Buru]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]], [[Kei Islands|Kei]], and the [[Sula Islands]]. None of the languages have as many as fifty thousand speakers, and several are extinct.

==Classification==
The traditional components of Central Maluku are the [[Sula languages|Sula]], [[Buru languages|Buru]], and [[East Central Maluku languages]], plus the [[Ambelau language|Ambelau]] isolate.

==Lhagang Choyu==
Lhagang Choyu ({{zh|Tagong Queyu 塔公却域語}}) is a Qiangic language similar to Choyu recently described by Suzuki &amp; Wangmo (2018).&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, Hiroyuki and Sonam Wangmo. 2018. “[http://hdl.handle.net/10108/91144 Lhagang Choyu wordlist with the Thamkhas dialect of Minyag Rabgang Khams (Lhagang, Khams Minyag)]”.

It used to be spoken in Xiya 西雅 Hamlet of the same township (Suzuki &amp; Wangmo 2016:63). Lhagang Choyu is an endangered language with about 100 speakers.

{{Politics}}
'''Client politics''' is the type of [[politics]] when an organized [[minority group|minority]] or [[interest group]] benefits at the expense of the public. Client politics may have a strong interaction with the dynamics of [[identity politics]]. 

This is particularly common in a [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]] system, such as in the [[United States]], where minorities can have considerable power shaping public policy. The opposite of client politics is 'entrepreneurial' politics, or [[conviction politics]].

==Examples==
===Tariffs===
An example of this is [[tariffs]] on imported goods in order to keep prices high.  The public is largely unaware and/or indifferent to a slight increase in the prices of goods while manufacturers are dependent and very aware of the subsidizing effect of tariffs on competing products.  Thus, local manufacturers will most likely strive to maintain tariffs and may succeed quite often.

===Pesticides===
Another example with farmers is the common use of potentially harmful [[pesticides]]. Due to the sheer amount of pesticides on the market and the difficulty on testing each one, there lacks conclusive evidence that many of the pesticides in use would harm the environment, leading to a lack of public consensus of what to do.  Farmers, on the other hand, are extremely sensitive to the benefits that such chemicals have on crop yield and will organize to keep pesticides available for use.

===Pork barrel legislation===
Most [[pork barrel]] legislation would be considered to be client politics.

'''Common stock''' is a form of corporate [[equity (finance)|equity]] ownership, a type of [[security (finance)|security]]. The terms '''voting share''' and '''ordinary share''' are also used frequently in other parts of the world; "common stock" being primarily used in the [[United States]].  They are known as '''Equity shares''' or Ordinary shares in the UK and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] realms.  This type of share gives the [[stockholder]] the right to share in the profits of the company, and to vote on matters of [[corporation|corporate]] [[policy]] and the composition of the members of the [[board of directors]].

It is called "common" to distinguish it from [[preferred stock]]. If both types of stock exist, common/equity stockholders usually cannot be paid [[dividend]]s until all preferred/preference stock dividends are paid in full; it is possible to have common stock that has dividends that are paid alongside the preferred stock.

In the event of [[bankruptcy]], common stock investors receive any remaining funds after bondholders, creditors (including employees), and preferred stockholders are paid. As such, common stock investors often receive nothing after a liquidation bankruptcy [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]].

Common stockholders can also earn money through [[capital appreciation]].  Common shares may perform better than preferred shares or bonds over time, in part to accommodate the increased risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Common Stock|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commonstock.asp|publisher=ValueClick|work=Investopedia.com|accessdate=2013-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shareholder rights==
Shareholder rights are more conceptual than technical or factual. Their most common source is in the statutory and case law of the jurisdiction in which the company was formed. Information about what people think of as shareholder rights can also be found in the corporate charter and governance documents, but companies do not actually have documentation outlining specific "Shareholder Rights." Some shareholders elect to enter into shareholder agreements that create new rights among the shareholders, and it is common for the company to be a party to that agreement. {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Some common stock shares have voting rights on certain matters, such as electing the board of directors. However, in the [[United States]], a company can have both a "voting" and "non-voting" series of common stock, as with preferred stock, but not in countries which have laws against multiple voting and [[Non-voting stock|non-voting]] shares

Hypothetically speaking, holders of voting common stock can influence the corporation through votes on establishing corporate objectives and policy, stock splits, and electing the company's board of directors. In practice, it's questionable whether or not such actions can be organized or ruled in their favor. Some shareholders, including holders of common stock, also receive preemptive rights, which enable them to retain their proportional ownership in a company if it issues additional stock or other securities.
There is no fixed dividend paid out to common/equity stockholders and so their returns are uncertain, contingent on earnings, company reinvestment, and efficiency of the market to value and sell stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfu.edu/~palmitar/Law&amp;Valuation/chapter%204/4-3-1.htm|title=Characteristics of common stock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Common/Equity stock is classified to differentiate it from preferred stock. Each is considered a "class" of stock, with different series of each issued from time to time such as Series B Preferred Stock. Nevertheless, using "Class B Common Stock" is a common label for a super-voting series of common stock.

In law, a '''commutation''' is the substitution of a lesser penalty for that given after a [[conviction]] for a crime. The penalty can be lessened in severity, in duration, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How to Apply for a Pardon or Commutation of Sentence|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/how-apply-pardon-or-commutation-of-sentence|website=ExpertLaw.com|publisher=ExpertLaw|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most [[Pardon|pardons]] by government and overturnings by the court (a full overturning is equal to an [[acquittal]]), a commutation does not affect the status of a defendant's underlying criminal conviction.

Although the concept of commutation may be used to broadly describe the substitution of a lesser criminal penalty for the original sentence, some jurisdictions have historically used the term only for the substitution of a sentence of a different character than was originally imposed by the court.&lt;ref name="brettpardon"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brett|first1=Peter|title=Conditional Pardons and the Commutation of Death Sentences|journal=The Modern Law Review|date=1957|volume=20|issue=2|pages=131–147|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2230.1957.tb00432.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the substitution of a sentence of parole for the original sentence of incarceration. A jurisdiction that uses that definition of commutation would use another term, such as a remission, to describe a reduction of a penalty that does not change its character.&lt;ref name="brettpardon"/&gt;

A commutation does not reverse a conviction and the recipient of a commutation remains guilty in accordance with the original conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clemency|url=https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/clemency|website=Death Penalty Information Center|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, someone convicted of capital murder may have their sentence of death commuted to life imprisonment, a lessening of the punishment that does not affect the underlying criminal conviction, as may occur on a discretionary basis or following upon a change in the law or judicial ruling that limits or eliminates the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time on Death Row|url=https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/time-death-row|publisher=Death Penalty Information Center|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some jurisdictions a commutation of sentence may be conditional, meaning that the convicted person may be required to abide by specified conditions or may lose the benefit of the commutation. The conditions must be lawful and reasonable, and will typically expire when the convicted completes any remaining portion of his or her sentence. For example, the pardon may be conditioned upon the person's being a law-abiding citizen, such that if the beneficiary of the commutation commits a new crime before the condition expires the original sentence may be restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=67A. Corpus Juris Secundum, Pardon and Parole, § 38|date=2006|publisher=West Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White v. State, 717 S.W.2d 309, 310 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1986)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12131061960664662213|website=Google Scholar|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Daigou'' purchases are often from luxury brand boutiques in major fashion cities like [[Paris]], [[London]], [[New York City]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Tokyo]] and [[Seoul]].

[[Image:A2000.jpg|thumb|right|An [[Amiga 2000]] desktop video system. The CPU unit is to the right with the monitor sitting on a [[VCR]].]]
'''Desktop video''' refers to a phenomenon lasting from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s when the graphics capabilities of personal computers such as Commodore's [[Amiga]], the [[Apple Macintosh II]] and specially-upgraded [[IBM PC compatibles]] had advanced to the point where individuals and local broadcasters could use them for [[analog signal|analog]] [[non-linear editing]] (NLE) and [[vision mixing]] in [[video production]]. Despite the use of computers, desktop video should not be confused with [[digital video]] since the video data remained analog. Full-screen, full-motion video's vast storage requirements meant that the promise of digital encoding would not be realized on desktop computers for at least another decade.

==Description==
There were multiple models of [[genlock]] cards available to synchronise the content; the [[Newtek]] [[Video Toaster]] was commonly used in Amiga and PC systems, while Mac systems had the [[SuperMac]] [[Video Spigot]] and [[Radius (hardware company)|Radius]] VideoVision cards. Apple later introduced the Macintosh [[Quadra 840AV]] and [[Centris 660AV]] systems to specifically address this market.

Desktop video was a parallel development to [[desktop publishing]] and enabled many small production houses and local TV stations to produce their own original content for the first time. Along with the advent of [[Public-access television|public access cable]] channels, desktop video meant that [[television advertising]] became affordable for local businesses such as real estate agents, contractors and auto dealers for the first time. As with the phrase ''desktop publishing'', use of the term died out as the technologies to which it referred become the norm for any kind of video production.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2224">'''Elemental cost planning''' is a system of [[Cost planning]] and [[Cost control]], typically for buildings, which enables the cost of a scheme to be monitored during design development.

1951 saw the publication of the Ministry of Education Building Bulletin No 4 which essentially introduced the concept of elemental cost planning to the UK construction industry. Its Author was James Nisbet. The concept has been refined and developed over more than 50 years in the UK by [[BCIS]] (the Building Cost Information Service of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors).

Elemental Cost Planning relies upon the adoption of a Standard Form of Cost Analysis for buildings which allows costs to be compared on a common format and forms the basis of the benchmarking analysis central to the concept of Elemental Cost Plans.

It should :-
*Ensure that the tender amount is close to the first estimate, or that any likely difference between the two is anticipated and is acceptable. 
*Ensure that the money available for the projects is allocated consciously and economically to the various components and finishes.
*Always involves the measurement and pricing of approximate quantities at some stage of the process.
*Aim to achieve good value at the desired level of expenditure. 

Elemental cost planning is often referred to as 'designing to a cost' or 'target cost planning' since a cost limit is fixed for the scheme and the architect must then prepare a design not to exceed this cost.

[[File:The Pentagon US Department of Defense building.jpg|thumb|right|An aerial shot of [[The Pentagon]] can be used to establish a meeting of US military strategists.]]
An '''establishing shot''' in [[filmmaking]] and [[television production]] sets up, or establishes the context for a scene by showing the relationship between its important figures and objects.&lt;ref name="yale"&gt;{{Cite web| title=Film analysis. Part 4: Editing | publisher=Yale University | date= | url=http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/editing.htm | accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally a long or [[long shot|extreme-long shot]] at the beginning of a scene indicating where, and sometimes when, the remainder of the scene takes place.&lt;ref name="calgary"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Videography Glossary|publisher=Calgary board of education|date=|url=http://schools.cbe.ab.ca/b690/Curriculum/computerop/comp9plus/CTS901-03/CTS9Plus-VideoGlossary.html|accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mediacollege"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Shot types|publisher=MEDIA COLLEGE.com|date=|url=http://www.mediacollege.com/video/shots/|accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Purdue"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Terms Used by Narratology and Film Theory|publisher=Purdue University|date=|url=https://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/narratology/terms/|accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guillotine"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Glossary|publisher=The Art of the Guillotine|date=|url=http://www.artoftheguillotine.com/glossarye.html|accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Establishing shots were more common during the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|classical era]] of filmmaking than they are now. Today's filmmakers tend to skip the establishing shot in order to move the scene along more quickly, or merely mention the setting in on-screen text (as is done in the [[Law &amp; Order (franchise)|''Law &amp; Order'' franchise]]). In addition, the expositional nature of the shot (as described above) may be unsuitable to scenes in mysteries, where details are intentionally obscured or left out.

==Use of establishing shots==
;Location: Establishing shots may use famous landmarks to indicate the city where the action is taking place or has moved to, such as the following;
*[[Brandenburg Gate]] to identify [[Berlin]]
*[[Empire State Building]], the [[Statue of Liberty]] or the [[World Trade Center site|World Trade Center]] to identify [[New York City]]
*[[London Eye]], [[Big Ben]] or [[Tower Bridge]] to identify [[London]]
*[[Sydney Opera House]] or the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge|Harbour Bridge]] to identify [[Sydney]]
*[[CN Tower]] to identify [[Toronto]]
*[[Hollywood Sign]] to indicate [[Los Angeles]]
*[[Eiffel Tower]] and/or the [[Arc de Triomphe]] to identify [[Paris]]
*[[Shibuya#Shibuya Crossing|Shibuya Scramble Crossing]] to identify [[Tokyo]]
*[[Las Vegas Strip]] to identify [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name="albany"&gt;{{Cite web|title=CSI and Forensic Realism|publisher=University of Albany|date=|url=http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/vol15is1/Deutsch_Cavender.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Time of day: Sometimes the viewer is guided in their understanding of the action. For example, an exterior shot of a building at night followed by an interior shot of people talking implies that the conversation is taking place at night inside that building - the conversation may in fact have been filmed on a studio set far from the apparent location, because of budget, permits, time limitations or convenience. In the series ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'', [[24-hour clock|24-hour]] [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (known in military nomenclature as "Zulu time") was used for these scenes to reinforce the military setting of the series.

;Relationship: An establishing shot might be a long shot of a room that shows all the characters from a particular scene. For example, a scene about a murder in a college lecture hall might begin with a shot that shows the entire room, including the lecturing professor and the students taking notes. A close-up shot can also be used at the beginning of a scene to establish the setting (such as, for the lecture hall scene, a shot of a pencil writing notes).

;Concept: An establishing shot may also establish a concept, rather than a location. For example, opening with a martial arts drill visually establishes the theme of martial arts. A shot of rain falling could be an establishing shot, followed by more and more detailed look at the rain, culminating with individual raindrops falling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1240">In the context of [[European integration]], '''Europeanisation of law''' may be interpreted as
* broadening of the scope of European law,
* emergence of new legal disciplines in Europe.

According to Professor Jacques Ziller the Europeanisation of law has three main consequences: 
* leads to change in the systems of [[sources of law]] in the national legal systems, 
* [[legal system]]s converge,
* changes [[legal science]]s' methodology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2629">The '''Fixed-Mobile Convergence Alliance''', formed in mid-2004, was a global non-profit organisation for improving products for providing [[Fixed mobile convergence|convergence]] between fixed and mobile networks. The FMCA was incorporated as a not-for-profit association under New York law in August 2006. The Alliance had a membership base of 20 leading global telecom operators, most of which were integrated telecom operators owning both [[landline|fixed]] and [[mobile phone|mobile]] networks. The included vendor affiliation programme made the operators able to work closely with the associate members, who were all telecommunication vendors.

==Members==
The alliance was founded by six companies: [[British Telecom]], [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]], [[Rogers Wireless]], [[Brasil Telecom]], [[Korea Telecom]] and [[Swisscom]]. The purpose of this alliance was to encourage seamless integration of [[mobile phone|mobile]] and [[landline|fixed]] telephone services ([[Technological convergence]]).

The member operators had a customer base of over 850 million customers and collaborated with member vendors towards accelerated development and availability of Convergence products and services in areas such as devices, access points and home gateways, roaming and innovative applications.

==Standards==
In order to accomplish its goals, the FMCA developed close relationships with leading [[Standards organization|Standards Development, Specification and Certification Organisations]] (SDO/Fora), including the [[Wi-Fi Alliance]], [[Wireless Broadband Alliance]], [[Home Gateway Initiative]] and [[3GPP]]. The FMCA actively contributed towards the delivery of existing and emerging standards that were relevant to FMCA product and service requirements. The FMCA did not aim to create standards but rather to accelerate the adoption of the Convergence technologies by encouraging consistency across product and equipment standards.

==Disbanding==
The FMCA was disbanded in March 2010, allegedly because of lack of demand for its services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.channelpartnersonline.com/Articles/2010/09/Fixed-Mobile-Convergence-Finding-the-Opportunity.aspx?topic=voice-mail | title=Fixed Mobile Convergence: Finding The Opportunity | work=channelpartnersonline.com | date=September 24, 2010 | accessdate=August 26, 2016 | author=Charlene O’Hanlon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Félix Morisseau-Leroy''' (13 March 1912 &amp;ndash; 5 September 1998), was a [[Haiti]]an writer who wrote in [[Haitian Creole]] for poetry and plays, the first significant writer to do so. By 1961 he succeeded in having Creole  recognized as an official language of Haiti, after expanding its teaching in schools and use in creative literature.  Morisseau also published works on [[French language|French]], [[Haitian Creole]] and [[Haitian French]] literature.  He worked internationally, encouraging the development of national literature in post-colonial [[Ghana]] and [[Senegal]].  In 1981 he settled in [[Miami, Florida]], where he was influential in uniting the Haitian community around Creole  and encouraged its study in academia.

==Early life and education ==
Born in [[Grand Gosier]] in 1912 to an educated, well-to-do [[mulatto]] family, Morisseau studied in nearby [[Jacmel]], where he was educated in [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]].  There he met his future wife Renée, who admired his skills as a horseman.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19980911/ai_n14170055 Nick Caistor, "Obituary: Felix Morisseau-Leroy"], ''The Independent'', London, 11 Sep 1998, accessed 14 Aug 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
Morisseau-Leroy married Renée in Jacmel, and always said she inspired his poetry.  They had two sons and a daughter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19980911/ai_n14170055 Nick Caistor, "Obituary: Félix Morisseau-Leroy"], ''The Independent'', London, 11 Sep 1998, accessed 14 Aug 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After returning from the US to Haiti, he taught in the capital Port-au-Prince.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt;  He began to pay more attention to the Creole of the streets and to think of its power as a written language to unite the country.  At that time, French was used by the educated classes, and Creole was the language of the common people.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt; 
Morisseau-Leroy taught literature and theater, and also worked as a writer and journalist.  He was appointed to political offices in government, including director in the Haitian [[Ministry of Public Instruction]] and General Director of National Education.

Known informally as "Moriso", he was a father of the [[Creole Renaissance]].  He promoted the movement to stimulate use of Haitian Creole (or Kreyòl) language and establish its legitimacy for creative use in literature and culture.  As this was the only language of the majority of the people, who were mostly rural, Morisseau believed strongly in using Creole as a means of uniting the country.  Morisseau translated the classical Greek tragedy ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'' into Creole as ''Wa Kreyon'', at the same time adapting the characters and context for Haitian culture, for instance, featuring a Vodoun priest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/ile.en.ile/paroles/morisolewa.html "Biography of Felix Morisseau-Leroy"], in French, with bibliography, Lehman Library, City University of New York, accessed 14 Aug 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of [[Papa Doc Duvalier]]'s autocratic regime shut down many of the most promising writers, as he was threatened by free expression.  According to one story, Duvalier sent armed forces to escort Morisseau to the airport and force him into exile because he was offended by his work.  Only the fact that they were former classmates and friends probably saved Morisseau's life.&lt;ref name="geoffreyphilp.blogspot.com"&gt;[http://geoffreyphilp.blogspot.com/2006/03/happy-birthday-flix-morisseau-leroy.html "Happy Birthday, Felix Morrisseau-Leroy"], 13 Mar 2006, Geoffrey Philp blog spot, accessed 14 Aug 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Morisseau-Leroy was invited to France to produce ''Wa Kreyon'' in Paris.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt;  While there he met major figures in the [[Négritude]] movement, such as [[Aimé Césaire]] and [[Leopold Senghor]].  They encouraged his work and also influenced his future teaching in nations of [[Africa]] and in the United States.&lt;ref name="geoffreyphilp.blogspot.com"/&gt;

He next moved to [[Ghana]], where he taught and headed the national theatre as colonialism was ending.  He taught in Ghana for seven years, then moved to [[Senegal]], where he taught until 1979.  Other Haitian writers exiled by Duvalier to Senegal included [[Jean Brierre]], [[Gérard Chenet]] and [[Roger Dorsinville]].&lt;ref name="lehman.cuny.edu"&gt;[http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/ile.en.ile/paroles/morisolewa.html "Biography of Felix Morisseau-Leroy"], in French, with bibliography], Lehman Library, City University of New York, accessed 14 Aug 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Morisseau-Leroy last moved to [[Miami, Florida]], in 1981, where there was a large Haitian community.  He settled with his family there for the rest of his life. In teaching Haitian Creole and literature, he helped unite immigrants and their descendants around their heritage.  He wrote a weekly column carried in the periodical ''[[Haïti en Marche]]''.  In later years, his mop of a white-haired [[Afro]] became a trademark, as was his sense of humor.

In 1991, his work was included in a collection of English translations (by Jeffrey Knapp, Marie Marcelle Buteau Racine, Marie Helene Laraque, and Suze Baron), ''Haitiad and Oddities'', was published in Miami.  It contains "Natif Natal," originally written in French, and 12 poems, including "Boat People," "Thank You Dessalines," and "Water," originally written in Haitian Creole. In 1995 he published his last work, an epic novel of Haiti of which he was proud, entitled ''Les Djons d'Haiti Tom'' (''People of Haiti with Courage'').&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt;

He died in Miami in 1998.

==Influence==

The '''Gagauz language''' (''Gagauz dili, Gagauzça'') is a [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] spoken by the [[Gagauz people]] of [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]], and [[Turkey]], and it is the official language of the [[Gagauzia|Autonomous Region of Gagauzia]] in Moldova. Gagauz belongs to the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] branch of Turkic languages, alongside [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]] (considered [[Kipchak languages|Kipchak]] in some cases), and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].  Gagauz has two [[dialect]]s, Bulgar Gagauzi and Maritime Gagauzi. Gagauz is a distinct language from [[Balkan Gagauz Turkish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=1710-16 |title= Language Family Trees: Altaic, Turkic, Southern, Turkish |editor=Lewis, M.

Though it was established as a written language in 1957, Gagauz was not used in curriculum until 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evidentials: Turkic, Iranian and Neighbouring Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VEiAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103|year=2000|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-080528-4|page=103|chapter=Indirectivity in Gagauz|first=Astrid|last=Menz|editor1-first=Lars|editor1-last=Johanson|editor2-first=Bo|editor2-last=Utas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gagauz is a language coming from Balkan Gagauz Turkish; Balkan linguistics was the first to view the consequences of language contact as normal rather than corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Balkan Languages and Balkan Linguistics|jstor=41287733|first=Victor A.|last=Friedman|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=40|year=2011|pages=275–291|doi=10.1146/annurev-anthro-081309-145932}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Gagauz language" and identification of one's language as "Gagauz" were established concurrently with or even after the creation of national self-awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kvilinkova|first=E.

== History ==

In 1994, the Gagauz wanted autonomy from the former Soviet Union.  The Law on Special Legal Status of Gagauzia was passed leading the Gagauz case to be the only case in the former Soviet Union where an ethnic group was granted autonomy status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt3fhcx2.13|chapter=Gagauz Autonomy in Moldova: The Real and the Virtual in Post-Soviet State Design|first=Oleh|last=Protsyk|year=2010|title=Asymmetric Autonomy and the Settlement of Ethnic Conflicts|editor1-first=Marc|editor1-last=Weller|editor2-first=Katherine|editor2-last=Nobbs|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 14, 1995, The Autonomy Statute for Gagauzia was put into effect, granting independence and attempting to regain control of the areas surrounding the Gagauz capital Comrat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite article|url=http://leader.viitorul.org/public/513/en/Conflicttransform%20Neukirch.pdf|title=Autonomy and Conflict Transformation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1750 and 1846, Gagauz ancestors fled to Russia and settled in the region that is now the current-day Republic of Moldova. Empress Catherine allowed the Gagauz to settle in the region under the condition that they converted to Orthodox Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1469-1809.2006.00330.x|title=The Gagauz, a Linguistic Enclave, are not a genetic isolate|journal=Annals of Human Genetics|year=2007|volume=71|pages=379–389|last1=Nasidze|first1=I.|last2=Quinque|first2=D.|last3=Udina|first3=I.|last4=Kunizheva|first4=S. |last5=Stoneking|first5=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The districts of Gagauzia were the poorest in Moldova.  In the years leading up to their independence, Gagauzia fought hard against the government over water supply, health care and native language education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=40396520|title=Moldova and the new Bessarabian questions | volume=49 | pages=135–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gagauzian autonomy led to tough times and turmoil both internally and with the central government in 2002.  Power-sharing is a difficult thing to do, so international assistance was needed many times for disputes between the power-sharing Moldova and Gagauzia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/books/10.1163/ej.9789004164826.i-794.61|title=Gagauzia and Moldova: Experiences in Power-sharing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orthography ==
{{main|Gagauz alphabet}}
It appears that the first alphabet to be used for the language was the [[Greek alphabet]]&lt;ref&gt;M. Ciachir. Basarabialâ gagauzlarân istoriassi / Chișinău: 1933, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 19th century. For example, orientalist [[Otto Blau]] claims that plays of [[Euripides]] had been translated into the Gagauz language and had been written with Greek letters.&lt;ref&gt;Măcriș, Anatol. ''Găgăuzii'' / Bucharest: Editura PACO, 2008, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1957, [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] was used up until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. In 1996 the Republic of Moldova officially introduced a [[Latin script|Latin-based alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lex.justice.md/viewdoc.php?action=view&amp;view=doc&amp;id=306590 HOTĂRÎRE (Judgment) Nr. 816], Moldovan Parliament, 24 April 1996 (Romanian/Moldovan and Russian).&lt;/ref&gt; This is modelled after the modern [[Turkish alphabet]], with the addition of three letters: {{angle bracket|ä}} to represent the sound of {{IPA|[æ]}} (as {{angle bracket|ə}} in [[Azerbaijani alphabet|Azeri]]), {{angle bracket|ê}} to represent the {{IPA|[ə]}} (schwa) sound, which does not exist in Turkish, and {{angle bracket|ț}} or {{angbr|ţ}} to represent the sound {{IPA|[ts]}} as in [[Romanian alphabet|Romanian]]. On the other hand, unlike Crimean Tatar, Turkish, and some other Turkic languages, Gagauz does not have the letter {{angle bracket|ğ}}, which had become completely silent in the Gagauz language.

Note that [[I-dot|dotted]] and [[dotless I]] are separate letters, each with its own uppercase and lowercase form. ''I'' is the capital form of ''ı'', and ''İ'' is the capital form of ''i''. The Gagauz alphabet has no q, w or x. Instead, those characters are transliterated into Gagauz as k, v and ks.

== Current situation ==
A study in 2012 was conducted on the Gagauz community to assess the current situation and sociocultural context. The findings show that within Gagauzia, official documents, printed publications, and official web sites are only in Russian. The National Passport System in Moldova does not allow the spelling of names in Gagauz. Signposts in Gagauzia are mostly in Romanian, and the names of squares and streets have not changed since the time of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Sirkeli, M. &amp; Lisenco, S. (2012). "Policy Brief: Implementation of linguistic rights of the Gagauz of Moldova. Integration of the Gagauz Community into the Society of Moldova."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
Despite various laws that support the rights of citizens to education in their native language, almost all instruction in Gagauzian schools is in Russian. Gagauz, while the native language of all students, is only taught as a "native language" class for a few hours per week.&lt;ref name="Dağdeviren Kırmızı"&gt;Dağdeviren Kırmızı, Gülin. "Emotional and Functional Attitudes of Native Speakers Towards Gagauz as an Endangered Language." (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also shown that there are not serious desires or attempts to institute Gagauz as a language of instruction. In a study, 80.6% of respondents preferred Russian as the medium of instructions at schools.&lt;ref name="Dağdeviren Kırmızı"/&gt; There are, however, some notable efforts to increase Gagauz language education. [[Todur Zanet]], editor-in-chief of the ''[[Ana Sözü]]'' local newspaper, has played an active role in encouraging readers and local authorities to promote instruction in their mother tongue. Zanet has also contributed significantly to efforts to standardize the language, and increase its accessibility through print and other mediums.

=== Media ===
''Ana Sözü'' is the largest local newspaper in Gagauzia. It is also the only local newspaper still written entirely in Gagauz, and was the first newspaper of any kind published in the Gagauz language. Apart from ''Ana Sözü'', there are various newspapers published in the Autonomous Territorial Unit of Gagauzia, including ''Açık Göz'', ''Gagauz Yeri'', ''Gagauz Sesi'', ''Halk Birliği'', ''Novıy Vzgled'', ''Vesti'', ''Gagauzii'', and ''Znamea''.

In addition to printed materials, the company Gagauz Radio Televisionu (GRT) produces radio and television broadcasts in Gagauz.

'''Gourgen Mkrtich Yanikian''' or in Western Armenian '''Kourken Mgrditch Yanigian''' ({{lang-hy|Գուրգէն Մկրտիչ Եանիկեան}}, December 24, 1895 – February 27, 1984) was an [[Armenian American]] [[engineer]], [[Armenian Genocide]] survivor, best known for the assassination of two [[Turkey|Turkish]] consular officials, Los Angeles Consul General [[Mehmet Baydar]] and Consul [[Bahadır Demir]], in [[California]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;{{citation | contribution-url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE3DD1439F932A35750C0A962948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon= | contribution = Imprisoned Armenian Dies | title = [[The New York Times]] | date = March 1, 1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sentenced to life imprisonment, Yanikian was released on parole in January 1984. It is widely believed that Yanikian's act was the inspiration for the founding of the [[Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia]], the Armenian militant organization of the 1970s and 1980s which staged attacks on Turkish diplomats in retaliation for the [[Armenian Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=admin|title=Gourgen Yanikian – the spiritual founder of ASALA|url=http://www.aniarc.am/2015/01/26/gourgen-yanikian-the-spiritual-founder-of-asala/|website=ANIARC|publisher=ANIARC|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Yanikian was born in [[Erzurum]] in 1895, at the height of the [[Hamidian massacres|anti-Armenian]] massacres that had taken hold of the eastern provinces of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. His family was able to flee to a safer location, but when they returned to Erzurum eight years later to retrieve personal possessions they had hidden in a barn, his elder brother Hagop was killed by two Turkish men.&lt;ref&gt;Bobelian, Michael. ''Children of Armenia: A Forgotten Genocide and the Century-long Struggle for Justice''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2009, pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Yanikian was studying to be an engineer at the [[Moscow State University|University of Moscow]] when World War I broke out. After learning of the Turkish persecution of Armenians during the [[Armenian Genocide|genocide of 1915-23]], he traveled to the [[Caucasus]] in the spring of 1915 and joined a volunteer regiment of the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian Army]] to find out the fate of his family members, whom he had not heard from since the outbreak of the war and who were living in the Ottoman Empire. He was assigned to an engineering unit that was tasked with mapping out the geography of the terrain ahead of the regular troops. As the Russian army advanced, Yanikian witnessed first hand the destruction wrought against the Armenians. Upon his arrival in Erzurum, he found his father's business in ruins and recognized the bodies of two of his relatives. In the course of the genocide he lost twenty-six members of his extended family.&lt;ref&gt;Bobelian. ''Children of Armenia'', pp. 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ArmenianGuilty /&gt;&lt;ref name=ArmenianHeld&gt;{{citation | url = http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F70C17F83E551A7493CBAB178AD85F478785F9 | contribution = Armenian Held in Coast Slaying of Two Turks | title = The New York Times | date = July 29, 1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
Yanikian went on to complete his education in Russia and in 1930 moved to Iran together with his wife Suzanna. They settled in Tehran where Suzanna opened a gynecological clinic while Yanikian set up a civil engineering company called RAHSAZ.&lt;ref&gt;Kalaydjian, Tigran. ''Sentinel of Truth: Gourgen Yanikian and the Struggle Against the Denial of the Armenian Genocide''. SBPRA (2012). {{ISBN|978-1-62212-995-9}} p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst other construction projects, he oversaw the building of a railroad across Iran during the Second World War, as part of Allied efforts there, and became quite affluent.&lt;ref name=ArmenianGuilty&gt;{{citation | url = http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FA0F1FFE385C1A7A93C1A9178CD85F478785F9 | contribution = Armenian Guilty of Killing Turks | title = The New York Times | date = July 3, 1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He emigrated to the United States in 1946, via France.  He and his wife arrived in New York and moved to Beverly Hills where he opened the Yanikian Theater.  The theater did not do well.

The couple moved to Fresno, CA, where there was a large Armenian community.  He claims he was a radio host in Fresno.  After some years, he and his wife moved to Santa Barbara, CA.  He began developing properties, using his substantial savings.  Things did not go well however, and he lost most of his money in the project.  All the while, he had been writing and publishing several novels including {{citation | title = The Triumph of Judas Iscariot | year = 1950}}, ''Harem Cross'' (1953) and ''The Voice of an American'' (1960). By the late 1960s, Yanikian had lost most of his money, was living on welfare and his wife was in a care home with dementia unable to recognize him, even though he visited nearly every day and brought her chocolates.  Her medical care became a factor in his insolvency and his dependency.

A final straw came for him late in 1972 when the U.S. State Department wrote him a letter that he should make no more attempts to communicate with their office.  Yanikian had been attempting to collect money owed him from Iran for projects he had done during World War II.  Yanikian had exhausted every legal channel and hoped the State Department could evoke pressure for payment &lt;ref&gt;Trial Transcripts Yanikian's testimony&lt;/ref&gt; of $1.5 million he claimed he was owed for the construction work he had overseen there.

As a matter of fact, in 1944 the Iranian court issued an award in favor of Yanikian against [[Ministry of Roads and Transportation (Iran)|Iran's Ministry of Roads]], which stipulated that the Ministry was to compensate Yanikian for the implemented construction works by 26 November 1944, but the Ministry failed to pay the award until 15 August 1948, and Yanikian sought to recover the damages for the delay in payment. The Iranian government stated that Yanikian was paid in full, and the [[Iran–United States Claims Tribunal]] dismissed in 1985 the claims of Yanikian's attorneys citing the lack of jurisdiction over items of the claim.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Adlam, M. E. MacGlashan. Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal Reports, Volume 8. Cambridge University Press, 1987. {{ISBN|0521464420}}, 9780521464420, pp 290-297&lt;/ref&gt; His despondency about the general state of his life has been thought to be a major factor in his act of planning and killing the Consul General and the Vice Consul General.&lt;ref&gt;Trial Transcripts Yanikian testimony&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letters of Psychiatric Evaluations of Yanikian&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bobelian. ''Children of Armenia'', pp. 141-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Memories of the genocide lingered in his mind and visions of his dead brother haunted him for years. The [[Republic of Turkey]]'s continual [[Denial of the Armenian Genocide|denial of the genocide]] remained a source of anguish and pain. Eventually, Yanikian, believing he had little left to live for, resolved to avenge the deaths of his family members and bring greater awareness to the genocide by organizing the assassination of the perpetrator country's agents, an act that took its cue from the example set by [[Soghomon Tehlirian]] fifty years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Bobelian. ''Children of Armenia'', pp. 143-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assassination of Turkish consuls===
On January 27, 1973, the 77-year-old Yanikian lured the Turkish consul general [[Mehmet Baydar]], 47, and vice-consul [[Bahadır Demir]], 30, to a cottage at the [[Santa Barbara Biltmore|Biltmore Hotel]] in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], promising to make a gift to Turkey of a [[bank note]] and a painting stolen from the Ottoman sultan's palace more than a century earlier.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fbMiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fLMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4349,3106195&amp;dq UPI. Author Yanikian Refuses To Plea]." ''Beaver County Times''. Feb. 27, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Yanikian had contacted the consul general three months before, and insisted that the consul general personally accept the painting, and since Baydar did not drive, Demir was asked to accompany him to provide transportation.&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;"Return of Painting Used as Lure in Consuls' Slayings, Police Say." ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. January 29, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Baydar, married and the father of two daughters, was a career diplomat who had previously served in Paris and Washington. Demir was on his first foreign assignment.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt; That neither man was alive during the genocide "mattered little to Yanikian," according to journalist Michael Bobelian: "Just as Ottoman dehumanization of the Armenians a half century earlier opened the door for so many ordinary citizens to participate in the Genocide, Yanikian came to view the men not as human beings, but as symbols of decades of injustice."&lt;ref&gt;Bobelian. ''Children of Armenia'', p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yanikian handed them the bank note, for which he was given a receipt, and the three men began to converse over lunch.&lt;ref&gt;Bobelian. ''Children of Armenia'', p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Yanikian revealed to them that he was not Iranian, as he had told the consulate when he first contacted them, but Armenian. Baydar dropped the bank note in anger and a heated exchange took place. At this point, Yanikian yelled "I will kill you," pulled a [[Luger P08 pistol|Luger]] pistol from a hollowed-out book and emptied nine rounds, hitting the Turkish diplomats in the shoulders and chest, though none of the wounds were lethal. As Baydar and Demir lay on the ground, Yanikian took a [[Browning Arms Company|Browning]] pistol from a drawer and fired two rounds into the head of each man, "what he considered mercy shots."&lt;ref&gt;Bobelian. ''Children of Armenia'', pp. 147-48.&lt;/ref&gt; He phoned the front desk of the hotel from his room and requested that the sheriff be contacted, because "I have just killed two men."&lt;ref name= "ArmenianHeld"/&gt;

Before meeting the Turkish diplomats, Yanikian had sent a letter to an Armenian language newspaper, urging Armenians to wage a war on Turkish diplomats.&lt;ref&gt;West, Richard. "Armenian Held in 2 Slayings Urged 'War' on Turk Envoys." ''Los Angeles Times''. January 30, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turkish Embassy reacted to the killings by calling on the United States to take action to protect its nationals, and the American Ambassador in [[Ankara]] condemned the killings, stating he and all Americans were "shocked at this senseless act of violence."&lt;ref name=ArmenianHeld /&gt; Fifty [[FBI]] agents were assigned to investigate Yanikian's background, including exploring possible (though ultimately non-existent) ties to the [[Soviets]] or to a well-organized "Armenian gang."&lt;ref&gt;See Bobelian, ''Children of Armenia'', pp. 153-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial and sentencing===
Yanikian pleaded not guilty to two charges of first degree murder. Although over the course of the trial he openly conceded that he had caused the deaths of the men, he insisted that he was not guilty of any crime.&lt;ref name=ArmenianGuilty /&gt; Yanikian insisted that what he did was "destroy two evils," as the victims were "not human" for him.&lt;ref name="court"&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/california/calapp3d/39/366.html People v. Yanikian 39 Cal. App. 3d 366].&lt;/ref&gt; Yanikian admitted that he conceived the assassination plan in April 1972, and meticulously implemented it over the intervening months between that time and the date of the actual homicides on January 27, 1973. He had originally planned to carry out the homicides in the consular offices, but changed his mind upon visiting the offices where he observed the presence of numerous employees who "might try to be heroes and get hurt."&lt;ref name="court"/&gt;

In an interview with reporters in a court anteroom he slammed his hands down on the table and declared that other people "have had their [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]] but we have not."&lt;ref name = ArmenianGuilty /&gt; Yanikian's defense counsel, headed by defense attorney James T. Lindsey, attempted to bring in survivors of the Armenian Genocide to testify as to the trauma of the experiences, as part of the defense strategy of depicting Yanikian as having "diminished mental capacity," but these motions were denied in court.&lt;ref name =ArmenianGuilty /&gt; After Yanikian's death, District Attorney David D. Minier wrote, "Looking back, I regret that I did not allow the genocide to be proven. Not because Yanikian should have gone free, but because history's darkest chapters — its genocides — should be exposed, so their horrors are less likely to be repeated."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Armenians hoped Yanikian's trial would provide a vehicle for proving the massacres in a court of law, while there were still surviving witnesses, but District Attorney Minier didn't agree. Only Yanikian took the Armenian Genocide witness stand, accompanied by his friend and interpreter, Santa Barbaran Aram Saroyan, the uncle of famous author [[William Saroyan]]. He told of coming across mutilated corpses and finding the decapitated bodies of his relatives killed in the massacres, and how he watched in hiding as marauding Turks slit his brother's throat.&lt;ref&gt;Bobelian. ''Children of Armenia'', p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded by saying that he killed the Turkish diplomats as representatives of the "government that had massacred his people."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{citation | contribution = Murder Will Out? District Attorney Regrets Not Allowing Genocide Testimony at Murder Trial | first = David D | last = Minier | title = [[The Independent]] | date = Apr 2, 1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yanikian's defense was based entirely on his claim of diminished capacity. However, the jury did not find this to be convincing, because it was clear from his testimony that he understood he was taking the lives of two human beings and that he did so because he considered it justified.&lt;ref name="court"/&gt;

Yanikian was sentenced to life in prison on July 2, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Bobelian, ''Children of Armenia'', p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Court of Appeals of California]] declined his appeal and ruled that his "ability to deliberate and to premeditate his crime was demonstrated by his own testimony of the elaborate preparations pursuant to a plan which was executed with logic and precision. Defendant's testimony showed the plan was initiated many months prior to its execution and involved the use of a bait to lure the consular officials to the place chosen by defendant."&lt;ref name="court"/&gt; Despite objections from the [[Turkish government]], Yanikian was paroled on January 31, 1984, because of poor health, and transferred to a [[Montebello, California|Montebello]] [[convalescent]] hospital. He died of a [[heart attack]] one month later at the age of 88.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Paroled Assassin of Two Turkish Diplomats Dies." ''Los Angeles Times'', February 29, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Yanikian is known to have remarked, "I’m not Gourgen Yanikian but unacknowledged history coming back for the 1,500,000 Armenians whose bones desecrate my invisible existence."&lt;ref&gt;Der Mugurdechian, Barlow. "Across the Chasm: From Catastrophe to Creativity" in ''The Armenian Genocide: Cultural and Ethical Legacies'', ed. [[Richard G. Hovannisian]]. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2007, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In death, he became a symbol for many Armenians of their resentment toward the Turkish government for refusing to acknowledge the Armenian genocide. Upon his death, one of his attorneys, [[Bill Paparian]], remarked that Yanikian "is now a piece of Armenian history."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; 
	 
It is believed that Yanikian's act set off [[List of Turkish diplomats assassinated by Armenian militant organisations|the string of assassinations and targeted attacks against Turkish diplomats]] by [[ASALA]] and [[JCAG]] in the 1970s and 1980s. Yanikian would later be appropriated by ASALA as an iconic figure.&lt;ref name=rapo&gt;{{citation | last = Rapoport | first = David C | title = Terrorism | year = 2006 | pages= 44–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning, it bore the name of "The Prisoner Kurken Yanikian Group".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Near East/South Asia Report | place = United States | publisher = Foreign Broadcast Information Service, Joint Publications Research Service | year = 1987 | page = 3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this association, Yanikian's slayings have been characterized as "the opening salvo" of the armed attacks against the Turkish government and its agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Masih | first1 = Joseph R | last2= Krikorian | first2 = Robert O | title = Armenia: At the Crossroads |location = Amsterdam |publisher=Harwood Academic Publishers | year = 1999 | page = xxxi}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Khachig Tololyan, "[Yanikian is] not understood in the context of his life, of his real biography, or even in the context of the brief autobiography we can glean from his utterances. He is assigned a regulative biography, and understood through it... enlisted in a resonating roll-call that blurs history, context, and nuance."&lt;ref name =rapo /&gt;

==Cultural references==
There is a conversation between the Brano and Gavra from [[Olen Steinhauer]]'s ''Liberation Movements'' dedicated to Yanikian's person:&lt;br /&gt;
—"Who's Gourgen Yanikian?" Gavra asked.&lt;br /&gt;
—"American citizen, Armenian descent. Two years ago he invited the Turkish consul general and the consul to lunch at the Baltimore Hotel in Santa Barbara, California. He shot them both with a Luger. Killed them."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Liberation Movements | first = Olen | last = Steinhauer | publisher = Macmillan | year = 2007 | page = 43}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, ''In My Defense'' play was staged in [[Glendale, California]]. Dedicated to Yanikian's life and struggle, the play is written by Jack Emery for the [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carlwattsartist.com/Gourgen_Yanikian_In_My_Defense.html Gourgen Yanikian: In My Defense, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Accessed Dec 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jollo received some notable media attention. According to [[The Daily Telegraph]].&lt;ref&gt;"Flinder Boyd's favourite websites", Flinder Boyd, [[The Daily Telegraph]], https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/olympics/london2012/3568810/Flinder-Boyds-favourite-websites.html, Dec 6, 2008.

==Development==
The Jollo website was classified as [[Software release life cycle#BETA|beta]].

Jollo was developed using [[LAMP (software bundle)|LAMP]] and had been praised for its colorful graphics and simple user interface.

Jollo offered a simple web-based API that could be used for translations. For example, the URL: http://www.jollo.com/translate.php?st=I%20love%20you&amp;sl=en&amp;tl=zh was used to translate the sentence "I love you" from English into Chinese.

A '''language island''' is an [[exclave]] of a [[language]] that is surrounded by one or more different languages.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Auer, Frans Hinskens, Paul Kerswill. Dialect change: convergence and divergence in European languages. str. 221. "The term 'Sprachinsel' was used for the first time in 1847 to designate a Slavonic community surrounded by a German-speaking population close to Konigsberg, East Prussia cf.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5746">{{technical|date=April 2017}}In [[psycholinguistics]], a '''lemma''' (plural ''lemmas'' or ''lemmata'') is an abstract conceptual form of a word that has been mentally selected for utterance in the early stages of speech production.&lt;ref name="paul warren"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warren|first1=Paul|title=Introducing Psycholinguistics|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521130561|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3V0gAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lemma represents a specific [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] but does not have any specific sounds that are attached to it.

When a person produces a word, they are essentially turning their thoughts into sounds, a process known as [[lexicalisation]]. In many psycholinguistic models this is considered to be at least a two-stage process. The first stage deals with [[semantics]] and [[syntax]]; the result of the first stage is an abstract notion of a word that represents a meaning and contains information about how the word can be used in a sentence. It does not, however, contain information about how the word is pronounced. The second stage deals with the [[phonology]] of the word; it attaches information about the sounds that will have to be uttered. The result of the first stage is the '''lemma''' in this model; the result of the second stage is referred to as the '''[[lexeme]]'''.

This two-staged model is the most widely supported theory of speech production in psycholinguistics,&lt;ref name="harley"&gt;{{cite book | last = Harley | first = T. | title = The Psychology of Language | publisher = Psychology Press | date = 2005 | location = Hove; New York | page = 359}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it has been challenged.&lt;ref name="Caramazza"&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Caramazza | first = A. | title = How many levels of processing are there in lexical access?  | journal = Cognitive Neuropsychology | date = 1997 |volume = 14 | pages =177&amp;ndash;208 | doi=10.1080/026432997381664| citeseerx = 10.1.1.455.4266 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, there is some evidence to indicate that the [[grammatical gender]] of a noun is retrieved from the word's phonological form (the lexeme) rather than from the lemma.&lt;ref name = "starreveld"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Starreveld | first = P. A. | last2 = La Heij | first2 = W.| title = Phonological facilitation of grammatical gender retrieval | url = http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/handle/1871/17124/Starrenveld_Language%20and%20Cognitive%20Processes_19%286%29_2004_u.pdf | journal = Language and Cognitive Processes | date = 2004 |volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages =677&amp;ndash;711 | doi=10.1080/01690960444000061| hdl = 1871/17124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be explained by models that do not assume a distinct level between the semantic and the phonological stages (and so lack a lemma representation).&lt;ref name="Caramazza"/&gt;

During the process of language activation, lemma retrieval is the first step in lexical access. In this step, meaning and the syntactic elements of a lexical item are realized as the lemma. Lemma retrieval, as explained through a [[Spreading activation|spreading-activation]] theory, is part of a network of separate elements consisting of the abstract concept, the lemma and the lexeme. Lemma retrieval is aided by the activation level of the concept that has yet to be verbalized. When activation takes place on the lemma level, the highest activated lemma element is selected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roelofs|first=Ardi|date=1992-01-01|title=A spreading-activation theory of lemma retrieval in speaking|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001002779290041F|journal=Cognition|volume=42|issue=1–3|pages=107–142|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(92)90041-F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lexical selection experiments have provided evidence that lemma retrieval is affected by the frequency of the word. This indicates that word frequency not only has an effect on the phonological elements of a word but also the semantic and syntactic elements that make of the lemma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254830585|title=Short article Does word frequency affect lexical selection in speech production? (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments that have studied the [[Tip of the tongue|Tip-of-the tongue]] (TOT) phenomenon have provided evidence that less strong connections of phonological elements (lexemes) and lexical and syntactic representation (lemmas) lead to inability to retrieve a lexical item.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hofferberth-Sauer|first=N. J.|date=2014|title=Resolving tip-of-the-tongue states with syllable cues|url=|journal=In V. Torrens &amp; L. Escobar (Eds.), the Processing of Lexicon and Morphosyntax|volume=|pages=(pp. 43–68)}}&lt;/ref&gt; TOT utterances provide evidence that the lemmas and lexemes are separate processes in language activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://benjamins.com/catalog/z.200.02abr|last=Abrams|first=Lise|last2=Davis|first2=Danielle K.|pages=13–53|doi=10.1075/z.200.02abr|title=Cognition, Language and Aging|year=2016|isbn=978 90 272 1232 0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of lemma is similar to the [[Sanskrit]] ''[[sphoṭa]]'' (6th century), an invariant mental word, to which the sound is intimately – but not indivisibly – connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coward|first1=Harold G.|title=The Sphoṭa theory of language as Revelation|url=http://www.tuninst.net/LANG-THOUGHT/Spho-Coward/Sphota2-5/sphota2-5.htm|website=TIL (Tun Institute of Learning)|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ciudad lineal de Arturo Soria.jpg|thumb|The concept of Arturo Soria's linear city.]]
[[File:Ciudad Lineal-ca. 1910.jpg|thumb|The planning of [[Ciudad Lineal]] (1895-1910) published by [[Madrid Urbanization Company]].]]
The '''linear city''' was an [[urban planning|urban plan]] for an elongated urban formation.  The city would consist of a series of functionally specialized parallel sectors.  Generally, the city would run parallel to a river and be built so that the dominant wind would blow from the residential areas to the industrial strip. The sectors of a linear city would be: 

# a purely segregated zone for railway lines, 
# a zone of production and communal enterprises, with related scientific, technical and educational institutions, 
# a green belt or buffer zone with major highway, 
# a residential zone, including a band of social institutions, a band of residential buildings and a "children's band", 
# a park zone, and 
# an agricultural zone with gardens and state-run farms (''sovkhozy'' in the [[Soviet Union]]). 

As the city expanded, additional sectors would be added to the end of each band, so that the city would become ever longer, without growing wider.

The linear city design was first developed by [[Arturo Soria y Mata]] in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]] during the 19th century, but was promoted by the Soviet planner [[Nikolay Alexandrovich Milyutin]] in the late 1920s. (Milyutin justified placing production enterprises and schools in the same band with [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]' statement that "education and labour will be united".)

[[Ernst May]], a famous [[Germany|German]] functionalist architect, formulated his initial plan for [[Magnitogorsk]], a new city in the Soviet Union, primarily following the model that he had established with his [[Frankfurt]] settlements: identical, equidistant five-story communal apartment buildings and an extensive network of dining halls and other public services.

The name '''MetaTexis''' is used for several software products developed by MetaTexis Software and Services.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metatexis.com/contact.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The main software products are MetaTexis for Word and the MetaTexis Server. MetaTexis for Word is a [[translation memory]] software, also called [[Computer-assisted translation]] tool (CAT tool), that runs inside Microsoft Word. The MetaTexis Server is a server software for translation memories (TMs) and terminology databases (TDBs) that allows numerous translators to work with the same TMs and TDBs via LAN or Internet.

MetaTexis Software and Services is based in Trier, Germany.

== History ==
The first version of MetaTexis for Word was released in July 2002. From the start MetaTexis for Word used the COM-add-in technology for MS Word. Since then the software has continually been extended and improved. Version 3 of MetaTexis for Word was released in September 2010.

In 2006 the first version of the MetaTexis Server was released. Since then the software has continually been extended and improved. Version 3 of the MetaTexis Server was released in October 2010.

== Products ==

=== MetaTexis for Word ===
MetaTexis for Word is a so-called COM-add-in that runs in Microsoft Word on Windows. The functions are available via a menu and a toolbar and/or via a ribbon inside Microsoft Word. A document translated in MetaTexis for Word is converted into a bilingual document (containing both the source text and the translation). The text is segmented, and the segments are presented to the translator one after another.  When the translation is finished, the final, translated document is created by a clean-up process.  The workflow is similar to older Trados versions or Wordfast Classic.

=== MetaTexis Server ===

== Supported source document formats ==
MetaTexis for Word can handle the following formats: any file type that is supported by [[Microsoft Word]], plain text files, Word documents (DOC/DOCX),  [[Microsoft Excel]] (XLS/XLSX), [[PowerPoint]] (PPT/PPTX), [[Rich Text Format]] (RTF), [[HTML]], [[XML]], TRADOS Word documents, TRADOS TagEditor (TTX), TRADOS Studio (SDLXLIFF), Manual Maker, several further formats.

== Supported translation memory and glossary formats ==
MetaTexis can use five professional database engines to save and administer the translation memory and terminology data.

The MetaTexis products can also import and export several file types for the exchange of data, in especially MetaTexis support [[Translation Memory eXchange|TMX]] files for translation memory exchange with other translation memory tools. MetaTexis can also import [[Termbase eXchange|TBX]]files for terminology exchange with other CAT tools. 

The MetaTexis programs support multiple TMs and glossaries.  The size of TMs and TDBs is only limited by the database engine used and by the database storage and the computing capacities of the system where the software is installed. 

MetaTexis for Word can access the MetaTexis Server and other server-based TMs, and MetaTexis can retrieve data from [[machine translation]] services that are available via internet (including [[Google Translate]] and [[Microsoft Translator]]).

== Documentation and support ==
Comprehensive help resources are available for each MetaTexis software product.  The program manuals, FAQs, demos, etc. can be accessed via this internet page: http://www.metatexis.com/support.htm .

Individual support is provided via email. The support is available for free. No support contract needs to be signed, no fees need to be paid.

'''Modern Literal Taiwanese (MLT)''', also known as '''Modern Taiwanese Language (MTL)''', is an [[orthography]] in the [[Latin alphabet]] for [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] based on the Taiwanese Modern Spelling System (TMSS). MLT is able to use the [[ASCII]] character set to indicate the proper variation of pitch without any subsidiary scripts or [[diacritic]] symbols.

==The current system==
The MLT alphabet adopts the Latin alphabet of 26 letters and the Scandinavian letter [[ø]] to express the basic sounds of Taiwanese:

:a b c ch e f g h i j k kh l m n ng ø o p ph q r s t th u v y z zh

A MLT word, like each English word, can be formed by only one syllable or several syllables, with the two syllables being the most typical.  Each syllable in MLT follows either one of the two underlying patterns (phonemes inside the bracket [] are optional):

*[Consonant] + [front nasal-sound] + vowel + [tone indicator]
*[Consonant] + vowel + [tone indicator] + [rear nasal-sound]

===Consonants===
* Bilabial: b, p, ph, m
* Alveolar: t, th, n, l
* Velar: g, k, kh, h
* Palatal: c, ch, s, j
* Dental: z, zh, s, j

===Vowels===
* Simple: a, i, u, e, o, ø, m, ng
* Compound: ai, au, ia, iu, iø, iau, ui, oa, oe, øe, oai
* Special High Tone (1st tone of i, u): y, w
* Special Shouting-Out Tone (2nd tone of ai, i, u, e, au): ae, {{Not a typo|ie}}, uo, ea, ao
* Front Nasal (indicator only, must be followed by a vowel): v
* Rear Nasal: m, n, ng

The nasals ''m'', ''n'', and ''ng'' can be appended to any of the vowels and some of the diphthongs.
In addition, ''m'' and ''ng'' can function as independent syllables by themselves.

The stops ''h/q'', ''k/g'', ''p/b'' and ''t/d'' can appear as the last letter in a syllable, in which case they are pronounced with [[no audible release]].  (The finals ''h'' and ''q'' stand for a [[glottal stop]] of high and low tone, respectively.)

TMSS originally prescribed two special characters: the Greek letter [[Nu (letter)|''ν'']] and an ''o'' crossed by a [[backslash]]. These were replaced with the Latin letter ''v'' and number ''0'', respectively. Because mixing numbers into words is problematic for [[spell checker]]s, ''0'' was subsequently replaced by [[ø]].

===Tones===
Not only consonants and vowel sounds, but also tones are represented by letters in the MLT system.  Certain letters have no sound of their own and are merely used as tone indicators.  Others letters represent vowels or vowel combinations which have certain tones.
For example, "f", "r", and "x" are tone indicators only, and have no sound of their own in MLT.  "Af" represents the "a" sound with a "high" tone, "ar" represents the same vowel sound but with a "shouting" tone, "ax" is the "a" sound with the low falling tone.  A "y" or "w" indicates a high tone "i" and "u", respectively, while certain diphthongs, such as "ie" and "uo", are treated as "shouting" tones.  The basic tone is represented by a normal, simple vowel (or voiced consonant—e.g. the nasals, "m" or "ng") without any special spelling modification.

====High Tone====
A high tone is derived by raising the pitch of the voice to a level somewhat above the basic tone and is normally represented by adding the tone indicator "f" after a vowel, with the exception of the “i” and “u” sounds in a syllable. A high tone "i" and a high tone "u" are denoted by "y" and "w", respectively.

(The high tone would be near the top of one's normal speaking register.  It may possibly be compared to the sort of high intonation used by English speakers when imitating a singer warming up with a high but level "mi, mi, mi, mi, mi".)

====Shouting-out Tone====
A shouting-out [or just "shouting"] tone is derived from shouting out a basic tone, and is normally represented by adding a tone indicator "r" after a vowel. When compound vowels are present in the shouting tone, however, sounds which by the normal rule would otherwise be written (“air”, “ir”, “ur”, “er”, and “aur”) are instead spelled "ae", "ie", "uo", "ea", and "ao", respectively. Exceptions occur when this rule overlaps with other rules. For example, the shouting tone of "lin" is written "lirn", not "lien" (interpreted as a compound vowel in basic tone) even though "lie" is the "shouting" counterpart to "li".

(Note that the so-called "shouting" tone is not literally a shout, but refers to the sort of quick, falling tone used, e.g., in shouting out a single-syllable word.  It may be understood by English speakers by comparing the neutral tone in the normal pronunciation of the vowel in the name "Bob" with the quick, falling tone used when shouting the name (or saying the name quietly but with urgency), "Bob!"  Similarly, saying "No!" achieves the same quick, downward tone in English.)

====Low-falling tone====
The low-falling tone is always marked by appending an "x" to the rearmost vowel.  (Think of the low, almost guttural tone used in  muttering a flat "Huh." or "Hmph." in English.)

====Rising tone====
The rising tone is denoted according to the following rules:
* Simple vowel: simply repeat the vowel. (E.g., "guu".)
* Compound vowel: repeat the last vowel letter except when it contains an “a”, then just repeat the “a”. (E.g., "zoaa".) In the case of ø, use øo rather than øø.

(Just as an urgent, quick "No!" can provide an example of the "shouting" tone in English, a questioning "No?" may represent the rising tone.)

====Short tone====
The low stopping tones are indicated by switching the final stops with the high stopping tones' as follows: h-&gt;q, t-&gt;d, p-&gt;b, k-&gt;g.

====Examples====
Examples for the seven tones:
* 1 (High): ty (豬, pig)
* 2 (Shouting-out): bea (馬, horse)
* 3 (Low-falling): pax (豹, leopard)
* 4 (Low stop): aq (鴨, duck)
* 5 (Rising): zoaa (蛇, snake)
* 7 (Basic): chviu (象, elephant)
* 8 (High stop): lok (鹿, deer)

===Special Symbols===
The [[apostrophe]] (', [[Apostrophe#Typewriter_apostrophe_and_ASCII_encoding|typewriter apostrophe]]) is used to demarcate syllables when there is ambiguity. A [[hyphen]] (-) is used to join two or more isolated words to make a new compound word with its own meaning. When a word contains a [[grave accent]] (`), all the syllables after this mark are accented in the low tone (low-falling for the long tones, and low-short for short tones).

==History of MLT==
The [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī]] (POJ) system, introduced in the 19th century, provides a basis for phonetic transcription of the Taiwanese language using the Latin alphabet.  It initially developed a significant user base, but the number of users declined during the period of [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese colonization of Taiwan]], when the use of POJ was suppressed in preference to [[katakana]], and also during the [[Martial law in Taiwan|era of martial law]], during which [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] was promoted.

Prof. Liim Keahioong, formerly of the [[National Cheng Kung University]] in [[Tainan City|Tainan]], Taiwan, pioneered the Taiwanese Modern Spelling System (TMSS) in 1943, with the intent to avoid the [[diacritical]] markings of POJ as well as the cumbersome difficulty of inputting [[Chinese character]]s with the available technology.  TMSS served as the basis for Modern Literal Taiwanese (MLT), also known as Modern Taiwanese Language (MTL).&lt;ref name=Lin1999&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lin, A. | year = 1999

'''Motion graphic design''' is a subset of [[graphic design]] in that it uses graphic design principles in a [[filmmaking]] or [[video production]] context (or other temporally evolving visual medium) through the use of [[animation]] or [[Film techniques|filmic techniques]]. Examples include the [[kinetic typography]] and graphics used in film and television opening sequences, and the spinning, three-dimensional [[station identification]] logos of some [[television channel]]s. The art form has been around for decades, and has advanced in technical sophistication over time.

A motion graphic designer may be a person trained in traditional graphic design who has learned to integrate additional elements into their existing skill set of design knowledge, though motion designers can also come from [[film]]making or animation backgrounds, and may use tools or training from those fields as well. 

Popular use of motion graphic design is used in the film industry. Openings to movies, television shows, and news programs can use photography, typography, and motion graphics to make the introduction more entertaining. The graphics used in television show introductions will usually represent the tone of the program. For example, high action television shows will contain fast-paced and bold graphics in the openings.

==Technology==
Technological advancements during the 20th and 21st centuries have greatly impacted the field; chief among these are improvements in modern computing technology, as [[computer program]]s for the film and video industries became more powerful and more widely available during this period. Modern motion graphic design typically involves any of several computerized tools and processes.

One of the leading computer programs used by modern motion graphic designers has been [[Adobe After Effects]], which allows the user to create and modify graphics over time. Another relatively recent product used in the market is [[Apple Inc.]] [[Motion (software)|Motion]], now a part of [[Final Cut Studio]]. Software such as Maxon Cinema4D has integrated tools to create motion graphics, such as the native MoGraph plugin, or ICE of Softimage, which can also be used for similar purposes.

[[Adobe Flash]] has also been widely used to create motion graphic design, particularly for the web, where it is sometimes used in [[web design]], but also in some animation products, such as animated [[web television]] productions like [[Homestar Runner]].

'''Mycenaean Greek''' is the most ancient attested form of the [[Greek language]], on the Greek mainland, [[Crete]] and [[Cyprus]] in [[Mycenaean Greece]] (16th to 12th centuries BC), before the hypothesised [[Dorian invasion]], often cited as the ''[[terminus post quem]]'' for the coming of the Greek language to Greece. The language is preserved in inscriptions in [[Linear B]], a script first attested on Crete before the 14th century. Most inscriptions are on clay tablets found in [[Knossos]], in central [[Crete]], as well as in [[Pylos]], in the southwest of the [[Peloponnese]]. Other tablets have been found at [[Mycenae]] itself, [[Tiryns]] and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and at [[Chania]], in Western Crete.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |author=Chadwick, John|title=The Mycenaean World |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge UP]] |year=1976 |isbn=0-521-29037-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language is named after Mycenae, one of the major centres of Mycenaean Greece.

The tablets long remained undeciphered, and many languages were suggested for them, until [[Michael Ventris]] deciphered the script in 1952.

The texts on the tablets are mostly lists and inventories. No prose narrative survives, much less myth or poetry. Still, much may be glimpsed from these records about the people who produced them and about Mycenaean Greece, the period before the so-called [[Greek Dark Ages]].

==Orthography==
[[File:Linear B Musée archéologique de Mycènes.jpg|thumb|Inscription of Mycenaean Greek written in [[Linear B]]. Archaeological Museum of Mycenae.]]
The Mycenaean language is preserved in [[Linear B]] writing, which consists of about 200 syllabic signs and logograms. Since Linear B was derived from [[Linear A]], the script of an undeciphered [[Minoan language|Minoan]], the sounds of Mycenaean are not fully represented. In essence, a limited number of syllabic signs must represent a much greater number of produced syllables that would be better represented phonetically by the letters of an [[alphabet]].

[[Orthography|Orthographic]] simplifications therefore had to be made:&lt;ref&gt;Ventris and Chadwick (1973) pages 42–48.&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is no disambiguation for the Greek categories of [[voice (phonetics)|voice]] and [[aspirated consonant|aspiration]] except the dentals ''d'', ''t'': {{lang|gmy|𐀁𐀒}}, ''e-ko'' may be either ''egō'' ("I") or ''ekhō'' ("I have").
* Any ''m'' or ''n'', before a consonant, and any syllable-final ''l'', ''m'', ''n'', ''r'', ''s'' are omitted. {{lang|gmy|𐀞𐀲}}, ''pa-ta'' is ''panta'' ("all"); {{lang|gmy|𐀏𐀒}}, ''ka-ko'' is ''khalkos'' ("copper").
* Consonant clusters must be dissolved orthographically, creating apparent vowels: {{lang|gmy|𐀡𐀵𐀪𐀚}}, ''po-to-ri-ne'' is ''ptolin'' (classical ''polin'', "city" &lt;small&gt;[[accusative case]]&lt;/small&gt;).
* ''R'' and ''l'' are not disambiguated: {{lang|gmy|𐀣𐀯𐀩𐀄}}, ''qa-si-re-u'' is ''gʷasileus'' (classical ''basileus'', "king").
* [[Rough breathing]] is not indicated: {{lang|gmy|𐀀𐀛𐀊}}, ''a-ni-ja'' is ''hāniai'' ("reins").
* Length of vowels is not marked.
* The consonant usually transcribed ''z'' probably represents *dy, initial *y, *ky, *gy.&lt;ref name=VC389&gt;Ventris and Chadwick (1973) page 389.&lt;/ref&gt;
* q- is a [[Labialized velar consonant|labio-velar]] kʷ or gʷ and in some names ghʷ:&lt;ref name=VC389/&gt; {{lang|gmy|𐀣𐀄𐀒𐀫}}, ''qo-u-ko-ro'' is ''gʷoukoloi'' (classical ''boukoloi'', "cowherds").
* Initial ''s'' before a consonant is not written: {{lang|gmy|𐀲𐀵𐀗}}, ''ta-to-mo'' is ''stathmos'' ("station, outpost").
* Double consonants are not represented: {{lang|gmy|𐀒𐀜𐀰}}, ''ko-no-so'' is ''Knōsos'' (classical [[Knossos]]).
In addition to the spelling rules, signs are not polyphonic (more than one sound), but sometimes are homophonic (a sound can be represented by more than one sign), which are not "true homophones" but are "overlapping values."&lt;ref&gt;Ventris &amp; Chadwick (1973) page 390.&lt;/ref&gt; Long words may omit a middle or final sign.

Mycenaean preserves some archaic [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] and [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]] features not present in later [[Ancient Greek]].

One archaic feature is the set of labiovelar consonants {{IPA|[ɡʷ, kʷ, kʷʰ]}}, written {{angbr|q}}, which split into {{IPA|/b, p, pʰ/}}, {{IPA|/d, t, tʰ/}}, or {{IPA|/g k kʰ/}} in Ancient Greek, depending on the context and the dialect.

Another set is the semivowels {{IPA|/j w/}} and the glottal fricative {{IPA|/h/}} between vowels. All were lost in standard [[Attic Greek]], but {{IPA|/w/}} was preserved in some Greek dialects and written as [[digamma]] {{angbr|{{lang|grc|ϝ}}}} or [[beta]] {{angbr|{{lang|grc|β}}}}.

It is unclear how the sound transcribed as {{angbr|z}} was pronounced. It may have been a voiced or voiceless affricate {{IPAslink|dz}} or {{IPAslink|ts}}, marked with asterisks in the table above. It derives from {{IPAblink|ʲ|kʲ}}, {{IPAblink|ʲ|ɡʲ}}, {{IPAblink|ʲ|dʲ}} and some initial {{IPAblink|j}} and was written as [[ζ]] in the Greek alphabet. In Attic, it may have been pronounced {{IPA|[zd]}} in many cases, but it is {{IPA|[z]}} in Modern Greek&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Zeta|date=2018-08-18|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zeta&amp;oldid=855499021|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

There were at least five vowels {{IPA|/a e i o u/}}, which could be both short and long.

As noted above, the syllabic [[Linear B]] script used to record Mycenaean is extremely [[defective script|defective]] and distinguishes only the [[semivowel]]s {{angbr|j w}}; the [[sonorant]]s {{angbr|m n r}}; the [[sibilant]] {{angbr|s}}; the [[stop consonant|stops]] {{angbr|p t d k q z}}; and (marginally) {{angbr|h}}. Voiced, voiceless and aspirate occlusives are all written with the same symbols except that {{angbr|d}} stands for {{IPA|/d/}} and {{angbr|t}} for both {{IPAslink|t}} and {{IPAslink|tʰ}}). Both {{IPAslink|r}} and {{IPAslink|l}} are written {{angbr|r}}; {{IPA|/h/}} is unwritten unless followed by {{IPA|/a/}}.

The length of vowels and consonants is not notated. In most circumstances, the script is unable to notate a consonant not followed by a vowel. Either an extra vowel is inserted (often echoing the quality of the following vowel), or the consonant is omitted. (See above for more details.)

Thus, determining the actual pronunciation of written words is often difficult, and using of a combination of the PIE etymology of a word, its form in later Greek and variations in spelling is necessary. Even so, for some words the pronunciation is not known exactly especially when the meaning is unclear from context, or the word has no descendants in the later dialects.

== Morphology ==
Nouns likely [[Declension|decline]] for 7 [[grammatical case|cases]]: [[nominative case|nominative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[dative case|dative]], [[vocative case|vocative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]] and [[locative case|locative]]; 3 [[grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine, feminine, neuter; and 3 [[grammatical number|numbers]]: [[grammatical number#singular vs plural|singular]], [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]], [[plural]]. The last two [[grammatical case|cases]] had merged with other cases by [[Ancient Greek|Classical Greek]]. In [[Modern Greek]], only [[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]] and [[vocative]] remain as separate cases with their own morphological markings.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Garrett, "Convergence in the formation of Indo-European subgroups: Phylogeny and chronology", in ''Phylogenetic methods and the prehistory of languages'', ed. Peter Forster and Colin Renfrew (Cambridge: McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research), 2006, p. 140, citing Ivo Hajnal, ''Studien zum mykenischen Kasussystem''. Berlin, 1995, with the proviso that "the Mycenaean case system is still controversial in part".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adjective]]s [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] with nouns in [[grammatical case|case]], [[grammatical gender|gender]], and [[grammatical number|number]].

Verbs probably [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugate]] for 3 [[grammatical tense|tenses]]: [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], [[future tense|future]]; 3 [[grammatical aspect|aspects]]: [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], [[perfective aspect|perfective]], [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]]; 3 [[grammatical number|numbers]]: [[grammatical number#singular vs plural|singular]], [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]], [[plural]]; 4 [[grammatical mood|moods]]: [[indicative mood|indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], [[optative mood|optative]]; 3 [[grammatical voice|voices]]: [[active voice|active]], [[middle voice|middle]], [[passive voice|passive]]; 3 [[grammatical person|persons]]: first, second, third; [[infinitive]]s, and [[verbal adjective]]s.

The [[augment (linguistics)|verbal augment]] is almost entirely absent from Mycenaean Greek with only one known exception, {{lang|gmy|𐀀𐀟𐀈𐀐}}, ''a-pe-do-ke'' ([[Pylos|PY]] Fr 1184), but even that appears elsewhere without the augment, as {{lang|gmy|𐀀𐀢𐀈𐀐}}, ''a-pu-do-ke'' ([[Knossos|KN]] Od 681). The augment is sometimes omitted in [[Homer]].&lt;ref&gt;Hooker 1980:62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek features==
{{main|Proto-Greek language}}
Mycenaean had already undergone the following sound changes peculiar to the Greek language and so is considered to be Greek:&lt;ref&gt;Ventris &amp; Chadwick (1973) page 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phonological changes===
* Initial and intervocalic ''*s'' to /h/.
* Voiced aspirates devoiced.
* Syllabic liquids to /ar, al/ or /or, ol/; syllabic nasals to /a/ or /o/.
* ''*kj'' and ''*tj'' to /s/ before a vowel.
* Initial ''*j'' to /h/ or replaced by ζ (exact value unknown, possibly [dz]).
* ''*gj'' and ''*dj'' to ζ.

===Morphological changes===
* The use of ''-eus'' to produce agent nouns
* The third-person singular ending ''-ei''
* The infinitive ending ''-ein'', contracted from ''-e-en''

===Lexical items===
* Uniquely Greek words: 
** {{lang|gmy|[[wikt:𐀷𐀩𐀏|𐀷𐀩𐀏]]}}, ''wa-na-ka'', *''[[wanax]]'' (later Greek: {{lang|grc|ἄναξ}}, ''ánax'', "lord")
** {{lang|gmy|[[wikt:𐀣𐀯𐀩𐀄|𐀣𐀯𐀩𐀄]]}}, ''qa-si-re-u'', *''[[basileus|gʷasileus]]'' (later Greek: {{lang|grc|βασιλεύς}}, ''basiléus'', "king")
** {{lang|gmy|[[wikt:𐀏𐀒|𐀏𐀒]]}}, ''ka-ko'', *''kʰalkos'' (later Greek: {{lang|grc|χαλκός}}, ''chalkos'', "[[bronze]]")
* Greek forms of words known in other languages:
**{{lang|gmy|[[wikt:𐀁𐀨𐀺|𐀁𐀨𐀺]]}}, ''e-ra-wo'' or {{lang|gmy|[[wikt:𐀁𐁉𐀺|𐀁𐁉𐀺]]}}, ''e-rai-wo'', *''elaiwon'' (later Greek: {{lang|grc|ἔλαιον}}, ''élaion'', "[[olive oil]]")
** {{lang|gmy|[[wikt:𐀳𐀃|𐀳𐀃]]}}, ''te-o'', *''tʰehos'' (later Greek: {{lang|grc|[[wikt:θεός|θεός]]}}, theos, "god")
** {{lang|gmy|[[wikt:𐀴𐀪𐀠|𐀴𐀪𐀠]]}}, ''ti-ri-po'', *''[[tripod|tripos]]'' (later Greek: {{lang|grc|τρίπους}}, ''tripous'', "tripod")

==Corpus==
{{Update|section|date=March 2014|inaccurate=yes|Since e.g. Thomas G. Palaima (2002-3), a source cited herein, there have been many more discoveries; see for example the [https://www2.hf.uio.no/damos/ Dāmos database] which lists many more items.}}
{{main|Linear B#Corpus}}
The corpus of Mycenaean-era Greek writing consists of some 6,000 tablets and potsherds in Linear B, from [[Minoan chronology|LMII]] to [[Helladic period|LHIIIB]]. No Linear B monuments or non-Linear B transliterations have yet been found.

If it is genuine, the [[Kafkania pebble]], dated to the 17th century BC, would be the oldest known Mycenean inscription, and hence the earliest preserved testimony of the Greek language, but it is likely a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas G. Palaima]], "OL Zh 1: ''QVOVSQVE TANDEM?''" ''Minos'' '''37-38''' (2002-2003), p. 373-85 [http://www.utexas.edu/research/pasp/publications/pdf/kafkania.pdf full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Survival==
While the use of Mycenaean Greek may have ceased with the fall of the Mycenaean civilization, some traces of it are found in the later Greek dialects. In particular, [[Arcadocypriot Greek]] is believed to be rather close to Mycenaean Greek. Arcadocypriot was an [[ancient Greek dialects|ancient Greek dialect]] spoken in [[Arcadia]] (central [[Peloponnese]]), and in [[Cyprus]].

Ancient [[Pamphylian Greek|Pamphylian]] also shows some similarity to Arcadocypriot and to Mycenaean Greek.

===Variation within corpus===
While the Mycenaean dialect is relatively uniform at all the centres where it is found, there are also a few traces of dialectal variants:

* ''i'' for ''e'' in the dative of consonant stems
* ''a'' instead of ''o'' as the reflex of ''ṇ'' (e.g. ''pe-ma'' instead of ''pe-mo'' &lt; ''*spermn'')
* the ''e/i'' variation in e.g. ''te-mi-ti-ja/ti-mi-ti-ja''

Based on such variations, [[Ernst Risch]] (1966) postulated the existence of some dialects within Linear B.&lt;ref&gt;RISCH, Ernst (1966), ''Les differences dialectales dans le mycenien''. CCMS pp.l50-160&lt;/ref&gt; The "Normal Mycenaean" would have been the standardized language of the tablets, and the "Special Mycenaean" represented some local vernacular dialect (or dialects) of the particular scribes producing the tablets.&lt;ref name="A DORIC FIFTH COLUMN"&gt;Lydia Baumbach (1980), [http://www.casa-kvsa.org.za/1980/AC23-02-Baumbach.pdf A DORIC FIFTH COLUMN?] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, "a particular scribe, distinguished by his handwriting, reverted to the dialect of his everyday speech"&lt;ref name="A DORIC FIFTH COLUMN"/&gt; and used the variant forms, such as the examples above.

It follows that after the collapse of Mycenaean Greece, while the standardized Mycenaean language was no longer used, the particular local dialects reflecting local vernacular speech would have continued, eventually producing the various Greek dialects of the historic period.&lt;ref name="A DORIC FIFTH COLUMN"/&gt;

Such theories are also connected with the idea that the Mycenaean language constituted a type of a special ''koine'' representing the official language of the palace records and the ruling aristocracy. When the 'Mycenaean linguistic koine' fell into disuse after the fall of the palaces because the script was no longer used, the underlying dialects would have continued to develop in their own ways. That view was formulated by Antonin Bartonek.&lt;ref&gt;Bartoněk, Antonín, [https://digilib.phil.muni.cz/bitstream/handle/11222.digilib/119936/SpisyFF_127-1968-1_6.pdf?sequence=1 Greek dialectology after the decipherment of Linear B.] Studia Mycenaea : proceedings of the Mycenaean symposium, Brno, 1966. Bartoněk, Antonín (editor). Vyd. 1. Brno: Universita J.E. Purkyně, 1968, pp. [37]-51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BARTONEK, A. 1966 'Mycenaean Koine reconsidered', Cambridge Colloquium on Mycenaean Studies' (CCMS) ed. by L. R. Palmer and John Chadwick, C.U.P. pp.95-103&lt;/ref&gt; Other linguists like [[L.R. Palmer]] (1980),&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, L.R. (1980), The Greek Language, London.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[:de:Yves Duhoux]] (1985)&lt;ref&gt;Duhoux, Y. (1985), ‘Mycénien et écriture grecque’, in A. Morpurgo Davies and Y. Duhoux (eds.), Linear B: A 1984 Survey (Louvain-La-Neuve): 7–74&lt;/ref&gt; also support this view of the 'Mycenaean linguistic koine'.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Colvin, [https://www.ucl.ac.uk/classics/staff/fulltimestaff/stephencolvin/Greek_koine.pdf ‘The Greek koine and the logic of a standard language’], in M. Silk and A. Georgakopoulou (eds.) Standard Languages and Language Standards: Greek, Past and Present (Ashgate 2009), 33-45&lt;/ref&gt; (The term 'Mycenaean koine' is also used by archaeologists to refer to the material culture of the region.) However, since the Linear B script does not indicate several possible dialectical features, such as the presence or absence of word-initial aspiration and the length of vowels, it is unsafe to extrapolate that Linear B texts were read as consistently as they were written.

The evidence for "Special Mycenaean" as a distinct dialect has, however, been challenged. Thompson argues that Risch's evidence does not meet the diagnostic criteria to reconstruct two dialects within Mycenaean.&lt;ref&gt;
Thompson, R. (2006) ‘Special vs. Normal Mycenaean Revisited.’ Minos 37–38, 2002–2003 [2006], 337–369.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, more recent paleographical study, not available to Risch, shows that no individual scribes consistently writes "Special Mycenaean" forms.&lt;ref&gt;Palaima, T. (1988) The Scribes of Pylos, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; This inconsistency makes the variation between "Normal Mycenaean" and "Special Mycenaean" unlikely to represent dialectical or sociolectical differences, as these would be expected to concentrate in individual speakers, which is not observed in the Linear B corpus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6366">In [[linguistics]], the '''orthographic depth''' of an [[alphabet]]ic [[orthography]] indicates the degree to which a written language deviates from simple one-to-one [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]]–[[phoneme]] correspondence. It depends on how easy it is to predict the pronunciation of a word based on its spelling: shallow orthographies are easy to pronounce based on the written word, and deep orthographies are difficult to pronounce based on how they are written.

In shallow orthographies, the spelling-sound correspondence is direct: from the rules of pronunciation, one is able to pronounce the word correctly.&lt;ref&gt;Besner, D., Smith, M. C. (1992). Basic processes in reading: Is the orthographic depth hypothesis sinking? In R. Frost &amp; L. Katz (Eds.), Orthography phonology morphology and meaning Advances in psychology Vol 94 (pp. 45-66). North-Holland, Oxford, England. Retrieved from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=1993-97079-003&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, shallow (transparent) orthographies, also called [[phonemic orthography|phonemic orthographies]], have a one-to-one relationship between its graphemes and phonemes, and the spelling of words is very consistent. Such examples include [[Spanish language|Spanish]], Italian, Finnish, and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

In contrast, in deep (opaque) orthographies, the relationship is less direct, and the reader must learn the arbitrary or unusual pronunciations of irregular words. In other words, deep orthographies are writing systems that do not have a one-to-one correspondence between sounds (phonemes) and the letters ([[grapheme]]s) that represent them. They may be irregular (English), reflect etymology (Hungarian, Faroese or French) or be [[Morpho-phonemic orthography|morphophonemic]] (Korean).

Written Korean represents an interesting hybrid; each phoneme in the language is represented by a letter but the letters are packaged into "square" units of two to four phonemes, each square representing a syllable. Korean is not completely shallow but has some exceptions in which the written word is not pronounced exactly as the individual letter-phoneme correspondences would otherwise require. English has many such instances: compare the pronunciation of the letter "c" in the words "magic" and "magician" or the pronunciation of the letter "i" in "pint" and "mint".

==Orthographic depth hypothesis==
According to the orthographic depth hypothesis, shallow orthographies are more easily able to support a word recognition process that involves the language phonology. In contrast, deep orthographies encourage a reader to process printed words by referring to their morphology via the printed word's visual-orthographic structure (see also [[Ram Frost]]).&lt;ref&gt;Frost, R., Katz,L., &amp; Bentin, S. (1987). Strategies for visual word recognition and orthographical depth: A multilingual comparison. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 13, 104 –115. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Katz, L. &amp; Frost, R. (1992). The reading process is different for different orthographies: The orthographic depth hypothesis. In Frost, R. &amp; Katz, L., (Eds.). Orthography, Phonology, Morphology, and Meaning, pp. 67-84. Amsterdam: Elsevier North Holland Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For languages with relatively deep orthographies such as [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Arabic]] or [[Hebrew]], new readers have much more difficulty learning to decode words. As a result, children learn to read more slowly.&lt;ref name="goswami"&gt;
Goswami, Usha (2005-09-06). "Chapter 28: Orthography, Phonology, and Reading Development: A Cross-Linguistic Perspective". in Malatesha, Joshi. Handbook of orthography and literacy. Lawrence Erlbaum Assoc Inc. pp. 463–464. {{ISBN|0-8058-4652-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For languages with relatively shallow orthographies, such as [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]], new readers have few problems learning to decode words. As a result, children learn to read relatively quickly.&lt;ref name="goswami" /&gt;

The phonetic writing systems of [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ([[hiragana]] and [[katakana]]) are another example of shallow orthography, but Japanese also uses [[logograph]]s ([[kanji]]), which are significantly more complicated. Additionally, Latinization known as [[rōmaji]] is increasingly common but not used traditionally. However, in contrast to alphabetic orthographies (English, French, Italian, Turkish, etc.), the Japanese hiragana and katakana orthographies are based on the open syllables of speech (consonant-vowel) or, more precisely, on the [[mora (linguistics)|mora]], with one written symbol for each of the syllables/moras in the language. While Japanese has only 3 graphemes for six phonemes like in the word '''katana''' (Japanese hiragana:かたな, Japanese katakana: カタナ IPA: /ka ta na/) Japanese kana is divided into syllables/morae with a simple V or C+V structure (with one -C mora that typically only appears at the ends of syllables), rather than by individual vowels and consonants; fewer graphemes are needed to write a word. Since Japanese phonology is relatively simple compared to many other languages, writing Japanese using syllables rather than alphabetic letters is a feasible option. 

Bosch et al.&lt;ref&gt;Van den Bosch, A., Content, A., Daelemans, W., and De Gelder, B. (1994). Analysing orthographic depth of different languages using data-oriented algorithms. available at http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.48.9845&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt; consider orthographic depth to be the composition of at least two separate components. One of these relates to the complexity of the relations between the elements at the graphemic level (graphemes) to those at the phonemic level (phonemes), i.e., how difficult it is to convert graphemic strings (words) to phonemic strings. The second component is related to the diversity at the graphemic level, and to the complexity of determining the graphemic elements of a word (graphemic parsing), i.e.,  how to align a [[Phonetic transcription|phonemic transcription]] to its [[spelling]] counterpart.

'''Preminder Singh Sandhawalia''' is a [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] author. 

His first book, published in 1999, was ''Noblemen and Kinsmen History of a Sikh Family''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20001210/spectrum/books.htm#1 |title=Book review on '&amp;#39;Noblemen and Kinsmen: History of a Sikh Family'&amp;#39; |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His second book ''Beyond Identity'' was released in 2007, and is about his people. It attempts to describe a new path that the Sikh community should follow in the years to be a model people.&lt;ref name="beyond-identity1"&gt;[http://www.beyond-identity.org/authorinfo.html Author info]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at Sandhawalia's website&lt;/ref&gt; Preminder Singh Sandhawalia’s third book, ''CELEBRITY: Its Changing Face in India Through the Ages'' was published in May 2012, and it examines the idea of celebrity in Indian culture through the ages. Sandhawalia explores why celebrity, an honour once accorded to those who performed great feats or provided great service, is now given to entertainers, and hopes his book will encourage readers to “… move away from being mere spectators who indolently look to entertainers to amuse them and return to appreciation of meritocracy and morality.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Singh |first=Preminder |url=http://www.authorhouse.co.uk/Bookstore/BookDetail.aspx?BookId=SKU-000567513 |title=Book Details |publisher=Authorhouse.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1982">'''Psychical inertia''' is a term introduced by [[Carl Jung]] to describe the psyche's resistance to development and change.  He considered it one of the main reason for the neurotic opposing, or shrinking from, his/her age-appropriate tasks in life.&lt;ref&gt;M. Jacoby, ''Individuation and Narcissism'' (2013) p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freudian and other developments==
[[Freud]] argued that such psychic inertia played a part in the lives of the normal, as well as of the neurotic,&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 358-9&lt;/ref&gt; and saw its origins in [[Fixation (psychology)|fixation]] between early instincts and their first impressions of significant objects.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 157-8&lt;/ref&gt; As late as ''[[Civilization and its Discontents]]'', he considered as a major obstacle to cultural development "the inertia of the [[libido]], its disinclination to give up an old position for a new one".&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 129) p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Jungians have seen psychic inertia as a force of nature reflecting both internal and outer determinants;&lt;ref&gt;K. Evera-Fahey, ''Towards a Jungian Theory of the Ego'' (2016) p. 68-9&lt;/ref&gt; while others have seen it as the product of social pressures, especially in relation to ageing.&lt;ref&gt;L. Woodward ed., ''Figuring Age'' (1999) p. 133 and 141&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag of UNESCO.svg|thumb|UNESCO flag]]
The '''Red Book of Endangered Languages''' was published by [[UNESCO]] and collected a comprehensive list of the world's [[endangered language]]s. It has been replaced by the UNESCO '''Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger'''.

==History==
In 1992 the International Congress of Linguists (CIPL) meeting in [[Canada]] discussed the topic of endangered languages, as a result of which it formed the Endangered Languages Committee. It held an international meeting also in 1992 in [[Paris]] to place the topic before the world and initiate action. The meeting was considered important enough to come under the authority of [[UNESCO]].

At the instigation of [[Stephen Wurm]] the committee resolved to create a research center, the International Clearing House for Endangered Languages (ICHEL) and to publish the UNESCO Red Book of Endangered Languages based on the data it collected. Shigeru Tsuchida was to start the research center. It began in 1994 at the [[University of Tokyo]] with Tasaka Tsunoda as its director.

Meanwhile, the initial reports on endangered languages had already been collected and submitted to UNESCO by regional experts in 1993. These were now turned over to ICHEL, which created [http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/ a website] for the red book. It continues to be updated regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language diversity endangered|first=Matthias|last=Brenzinger|pages=206–207|location=Berlin, New York|publisher=[[Mouton de Gruyter]]|year=2007|id={{ISBN|3110170493}}, {{ISBN|978-3-11-017049-8}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Last updates==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2014}}
In February 2009, UNESCO launched an online edition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=new edition of the Atlas of endangered languages|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/endangered-languages/atlas-of-languages-in-danger/|title=Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=30 April 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Atlas of endangered languages which covers the whole world, contains much more information than previous printed editions and offers the possibility to users to provide online feedback, in view of its constant updating.

'''Roger Gougenot des Mousseaux''' (1805–76) was a French writer and journalist. In 1860 he wrote ''La magie au dix-neufième siècle'', and in 1864 ''Les hauts phénomènes de la magie''.

An [[ultramontane]] antisemite, des Mosseaux's ''Le Juif, le judaïsme et la judaïsation des peuples chrétiens'' (1869) argued that Jews had manipulated the ideals of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] to subvert and destroy Catholic France, and held them responsible for the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Rubenstein, Richard L., and John K. Roth. Approaches to Auschwitz: The Legacy of the Holocaust. London: SCM, 1987, p.74&lt;/ref&gt; Gougenot des Mousseaux maintained that Jews engaged in ritual murder, conspired with [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Freemasons]] to control the world, and that the French Revolution was wrong to grant them equal rights.&lt;ref name="Michael"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=R. |title=A History of Catholic Antisemitism: The Dark Side of the Church |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Pius IX]] blessed the work and Nazi ideologue [[Alfred Rosenberg]] edited and published the first German edition in 1921.&lt;ref name="Michael" /&gt; It was also heavily cited in [[Édouard Drumont]]'s popular anti-Semitic screed ''La France juive''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Socialism of Fools: Capitalism and Modern Anti-Semitism|last=Battini|first=Michele|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Say Goodnight to Illiteracy''' is a children's bedtime storybook series, published annually by [[Half Price Books]], Records, Magazines, Incorporated through their publishing entity [[Hackberry Press]].  All proceeds from the sales of the book are donated by [[Half Price Books]] to [[literacy]] organizations across the nation such as [[Reach Out and Read]].

The [[Retail Advertising and Marketing Association]] (RAMA) honored [[Half Price Books]] with the [[Peter Glen Award]] in 2004 for the "Say Good Night to Illiteracy" project.  It was recognized as a public service that has fostered dreams and creativity of hundreds of writers, raising awareness and funds for the cause of [[literacy]].

Annual release occurs in October. A current edition of the "Say Good Night to Illiteracy" bedtime storybook collection can be purchased at any [[Half Price Books]]. All proceeds of new book sales made at [[Half Price Books]] benefit non-profit family literacy groups. Some used copies are sold on auction sites such as [[Abebooks]] and [[Amazon.com]].

Children's stories in the book are a result of the annual writing contest held by the used bookstore chain. Twenty entries are selected each year for publication. Each children's story or poem is matched up with simple, four-color illustrations, provided by professional and student illustrators.

The theme of the book each year is centered on quotations about books, reading and learning. Overall, the theme and purpose of the "Say Good Night to Illiteracy" project is summarized by this [[Emilie Buchwald]] quotation: "Children are made readers in the laps of their parents."

Talking shit can be used as a tactic in fighting or brawling, used to draw attention to the matter among onlookers.&lt;ref name="Ferrell Hayward Morrison Presdee 2004"/&gt; This is a term that has been coined more recently and is used in reference when someone talks negatively or spreads false ideas about another person, concept, organization, or entity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9474">'''Two-dimensionalism''' is an approach to [[semantics]] in [[analytic philosophy]]. It is a theory of how to determine the [[sense and reference]] of a [[word]] and the [[truth-value]] of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. It is intended to resolve the puzzle: How is it possible to discover empirically that a [[logical truth|necessary truth]] is [[Truth|true]]? Two-dimensionalism provides an analysis of the semantics of words and sentences that makes sense of this possibility. The theory was first developed by [[Robert Stalnaker]], but it has been advocated by numerous philosophers since, including [[David Chalmers]].

==Two-dimensional semantic analysis==
Any given sentence, for example, the words,

:"Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O"

is taken to express two distinct [[proposition]]s, often referred to as a ''primary intension'' and a ''secondary intension'', which together compose its [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]].&lt;ref&gt;for a fuller explanation see Chalmers, David. ''The Conscious Mind''. Oxford UP: 1996. Chapter 2, section 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary [[intension]] of a word or sentence is its [[sense and reference|sense]], i.e., is the idea or method by which we find its referent. The primary intension of "water" might be a description, such as ''watery stuff''. The thing picked out by the primary intension of "water" could have been otherwise. For example, on some other world where the inhabitants take "water" to mean ''watery stuff'', but, where the chemical make-up of watery stuff is not H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, it is not the case that water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O for that world.

The ''secondary intension'' of "water" is whatever thing "water" happens to pick out in ''this'' world, whatever that world happens to be. So, if we assign "water" the primary intension ''watery stuff'', then the secondary intension of "water" is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, since H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is ''watery stuff'' in this world. The secondary intension of "water" in our world is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in every world because unlike ''watery stuff'' it is impossible for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to be other than H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. When considered according to its secondary intension, "Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O" is true in every world.

==Impact==
If two-dimensionalism is workable it solves some very important problems in the philosophy of language. [[Saul Kripke]] has argued that "Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O" is an example of a necessary truth which is true ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'', since we had to discover that water was H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, but given that it is true (which it is) it cannot be false. It would be absurd to claim that something that is water is not H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, for these are known to be ''identical''.

However, this contention that one and the same proposition can be both [[a posteriori (epistemology)|a posteriori]] and necessary is considered absurd by some philosophers (as is Kripke's paired claim that the same proposition can be both [[a priori (epistemology)|a priori]] and [[contingent]]).

For example, Robert Stalnaker's account of knowledge represents knowledge as a [[relation (philosophy)|relation]] on [[possible world]]s, which entails that it is impossible for a proposition to fail to be a priori given that it is necessary. This can be proven as follows: If a proposition ''P'' is necessary it is true in all possible worlds. If ''P'' is true at all possible worlds and what we know are sets of possible worlds, then it is not possible ''not'' to know that ''P'', for ''P'' is the case at all possible worlds in the set of worlds that we know. So if ''P'' is necessary then we know it necessarily, and ''ipso facto'' we know it a priori.&lt;ref name="Stalnaker propositions"&gt;Stalnaker, Robert. "Propositions." ''Issues in the Philosophy of Language''. Yale UP, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under two-dimensionalism, the problem disappears. The primary intension of "Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O" is the ''a posteriori'' component, since it is contingent that the referent of "water" is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, while the secondary intension is the ''necessary'' component of the sentence, since it is necessary that the stuff we in fact call water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Neither intension gives us both a necessary and an ''a posteriori'' component. But one gets the false impression that the sentence expresses a ''necessary a posteriori'' proposition because this single sentence expresses two propositions, one ''a posteriori'' and one ''necessary''.&lt;ref name="Stalnaker propositions" /&gt;

===In the philosophy of mind===

Two-dimensional semantics has been used by David Chalmers to counter objections to the various arguments against [[Cartesian materialism|materialism in the philosophy of mind]]. Specifically, Chalmers deploys two-dimensional semantics to "bridge the (gap between) [[epistemic]] and [[modal logic|modal]] domains" in arguing from knowability or epistemic conceivability to what is necessary or possible (modalities).&lt;ref name=Chalmers2010 /&gt;

The reason Chalmers employs two-dimensional semantics is to avoid objections to conceivability implying possibility. For instance, it's claimed that we can conceive of water not having been {{chem|H|2|O}}, but it's not possible that water isn't {{chem|H|2|O}}. Chalmers replies that it ''is'' 1-possible that water wasn't {{chem|H|2|O}} because we can imagine another substance XYZ with watery properties, but it's not 2-possible. Hence, objections to conceivability implying possibility are unfounded when these words are used more carefully.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2010 /&gt;

Chalmers then advances the following "two-dimensional argument against materialism".&lt;ref name=Chalmers2010&gt;{{cite book|author1=David J. Chalmers|title=The Character of Consciousness|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195311112|url=http://consc.net/papers/2dargument.html|accessdate=4 September 2014|chapter=The Two-Dimensional Argument Against Materialism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Define P as all physical truths about the universe and Q as a truth about [[phenomenal consciousness|phenomenal experience]], such as that someone is conscious. Let "1-possible" refer to possibility relative to primary intension and "2-possible" relative to secondary intension.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# P&amp;~Q is conceivable [i.e., [[Philosophical zombie|zombies]] are conceivable]
# If P&amp;~Q is conceivable, then P&amp;~Q is 1-possible
# If P&amp;~Q is 1-possible, then P&amp;~Q is 2-possible or [[Neutral monism|Russellian monism]] is true.
# If P&amp;~Q is 2-possible, materialism is false.
# Materialism is false or Russellian monism is true.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Scott Soames]] is a notable opponent of two-dimensionalism, which he sees as an attempt to revive [[Bertrand Russell|Russelian]]-[[Frege]]an [[descriptivist theory of names|descriptivism]] and to overturn what he sees as a "revolution" in semantics begun by [[Saul Kripke|Kripke]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Soames | first = Scott | title = Reference and Description | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-691-13099-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soames argues that two-dimensionalism stems from a misreading of passages in Kripke (1980) as well as [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|Kaplan]] (1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Almog | first1 = Joseph | last2 = Perry | first2 = John | last3 = Wettstein | first3 = Howard K. | last4 = Kaplan | first4 = David | title = Themes from Kaplan | date = 1989 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York  | isbn = 0-19-505217-X | pages = 481–564  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wanker''', literally "one who wanks ([[Masturbation|masturbates]])", is a general insult. It is a [[pejorative]] term of English origin common in Britain and other parts of the English-speaking world (mainly [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]]), including Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. It initially referred to an "[[wikt:onanist|onanist]]" and is [[synonym]]ous with the word ''[[Wiktionary:tosser|tosser]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Words, Meaning And Vocabulary: An Introduction to Modern English Lexicology. Howard Jackson, Etienne Zé Amvela. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
[[Image:Fingers and thumb in circle downward motion.jpg|thumb|right|"Wanker" hand gesture]]
The terms ''wank'' and ''wanker'' originated in British [[slang]] during the late 19th and early 20th century.&lt;ref name="early"&gt;A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English: Colloquialisms and Catch Phrases, Fossilised Jokes and Puns, General Nicknames, Vulgarisms and Such Americanisms As Have Been Naturalised. Eric Partridge, Paul Beale. Routledge, 15 Nov 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=wank&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 ''wank'']. [[Online Etymology Dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; In modern usage it is usually a general term of contempt rather than a commentary on sexual habits. ''Wanker'' has similar meanings and overtones to American pejoratives like ''jerk'' or ''jerk-off''.&lt;ref name="effingpot.com"&gt;Etherington, Mike: [http://www.effingpot.com/slang.shtml The very Best of British The American's guide to speaking British]&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, ''wanker'' can carry suggestions of [[egotist]]ical and [[Selfishness|self-indulgent]] behaviour and this is the dominant meaning in Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Ludowyk, Frederick: [http://andc.anu.edu.au/ozwords/April%202001/Swearing.html Anatomy of Swearing]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Wanker'' may be indicated by a one-handed gesture,&lt;ref&gt;How to make a [http://jeroenarendsen.nl/2007/07/gesture-wellformedness/ Wanker gesture] and how not to make it&lt;/ref&gt; usually to an audience out of hearing range.&lt;ref name="effingpot.com" /&gt; It is performed by curling the fingers of the hand into a loose fist and moving the hand back and forth to mime male masturbation, which is equivalent to saying, "that person is a wanker".&lt;ref&gt;Rude Hand Gestures of the World: A Guide to Offending Without Words. Lefevre, Romana. Chronicle Books, 17 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the term is understood, but rarely used, and then more in a way suggesting the target is an [[idiot]].

Related are terms such as "wanker's colic", for an undiagnosed visceral pain, and "wanker's doom", for excessive masturbation, from slang used in the [[RAF]] and [[British prisons]] since the 1920s.&lt;ref name="early" /&gt;

==Differences in perceived levels of offensiveness==
In December 2000, the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] published research on attitudes of the British public to pejoratives. It ranked ''wanker'' as the fourth most severe pejorative in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delete expletives? |work=Advertising Standards Authority, accessed via Wayback Machine |url=http://www.asa.org.uk/~/media/Files/ASA/Reports/ASA_Delete_Expletives_Dec_2000.ashx |format=PDF |accessdate=14 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308152410/http://www.asa.org.uk/~/media/Files/ASA/Reports/ASA_Delete_Expletives_Dec_2000.ashx |archivedate=8 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC]] describes it as "moderately offensive" and "almost certain" to generate complaints if used before the [[Watershed (television)|watershed]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/editorialguidelines/advice/offensivelanguage/index.shtml BBC - Editorial guidelines, definition of offensive language] . Retrieved 20 January 2007.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221101517/http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/editorialguidelines/advice/offensivelanguage/index.shtml |date=21 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, it is considered mildly offensive but is widely accepted and used in the media.&lt;ref name=whinger&gt;[[Karen Stollznow]], 2004. ''[http://www.als.asn.au/proceedings/als2003/stollznow.pdf Whinger! Wowser! Wanker! Aussie English: Deprecatory language and the Australian ethos]''. In Christo Moskovsky (ed), [http://www.als.asn.au/proceedings/als2003.html Proceedings of the 2003 Conference of the Australian Linguistic Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Cresswell, an American [[etymologist]], describes "wanker" as "somewhat more offensive in British use than Americans typically realize".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | title = Word Of The Day: November 19, 1996
  | url=http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=19961119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The word was used twice to comic effect in the ''[[Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Trash of the Titans]]", which caused no offence to American audiences, but prompted complaints on occasions when the episode was broadcast unedited in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dowell|first=Ben|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jun/09/channel4.ofcom|title=The Simpsons: Channel 4 apologises for pre-watershed swearing|publisher=The Guardian|date=9 June 2008|accessdate=9 June 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
"[[The Winker's Song (Misprint)]]" by [[Ivor Biggun]] is one of many songs about masturbation. It describes the singer: "I'm a wanker, I'm a wanker. And it does me good like it bloody well should", and it reached number 22 in the 1978 [[UK Singles Chart|UK charts]]. It was banned by [[BBC Radio 1]] and every national radio and television service.&lt;ref&gt;The encyclopedia of popular music: Indexes, Volume 10. Colin Larkin. Oxford University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phil Collins]] used the word in his 1984 cameo appearance on ''[[Miami Vice]]'' and has sometimes been credited with introducing the word to America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philcollins.co.uk/playboy1086.htm Phil Collins interview, Playboy magazine October 1986]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206135705/http://www.philcollins.co.uk/playboy1086.htm |date=6 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'', [[David St. Hubbins]] and [[Nigel Tufnel]] both use the word out of earshot to describe fellow rock star Duke Fame after a chance encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088258/trivia?tab=qt |title=This Is Spinal Tap (1984) - Quotes|work=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the American television show ''[[Married... with Children]]'', Peggy Bundy's family is from the fictional Wanker County.

On the British television quiz show ''[[Countdown (game show)|Countdown]]'', contestants have to form the longest word possible from nine randomly selected letters. On one occasion the letters permitted the spelling of "wanker" (or "wankers") and both contestants replied with the word, leading one to quip "we've got a pair of wankers". The sequence was edited out of the show (as is common with [[wikt:risqué|risqué]] words), but has been shown as an outtake on other shows.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120912001233/http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/countdwn.htm] &lt;/ref&gt; However, on a later occasion, "wanker" was offered, and this instance was left in and broadcast unedited.

The comedy show ''[[Mork &amp; Mindy]]'' featured a character named Mr. Wanker who was Mindy's landlord.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was broadcast on American TV and later British TV.

Australian band [[TISM]] released an album in 1998 entitled ''[[www.tism.wanker.com]]'' (which was an active website for a few months after its release). One of the themes in its lyrics is breaking down male society into two distinct cultures: [[Yobbo|Yobs]] (the subject of the [[Yob (song)|first single]] released from the album) and wankers. Its third single, "[[Whatareya?]]", offers examples of differences between the types and tells the listener to decide which one he is.

In February 2009, [[U2]] member [[Bono]] called [[Chris Martin]] a wanker live on air during [[Jo Whiley]]'s [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bono Calls Chris Martin A Wanker|publisher=Music-News.com|url=http://music-news.com/ShowNews.asp?nItemID=24741|accessdate=1 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a live radio debate on 28 May 2010, the future [[President of Ireland]], [[Michael D. Higgins]], urged conservative American radio host [[Michael Graham (radio personality)|Michael Graham]] to "be proud to be a decent American rather than being just a wanker whipping up fear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstalk.ie/2010/programmes/all-programmes/the-right-hook/the-two-michaels/ |title=Michael Graham v Michael D. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227230214/http://www.newstalk.ie/2010/programmes/all-programmes/the-right-hook/the-two-michaels/ |archive-date=27 February 2012  |work=Newstalk.ie |date=28 May 2010 |at=15 min 25 sec}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOxKnsT-XZg Newstalk Radio debate] "The fact if the matter is, look, young people from the United States are travelling all over the world again. They're welcome in Europe, they're backpackers in hostels, people are talking to them because the image of the United States – we've got away from this war mongering – is getting better. The many mistakes Obama is making...at least 47 million people that the likes of you condemn to no health care in a country that I was proud to work in – these people are going to have some health care, so this is the issue, so therefore be proud to be a decent American rather than being just a wanker whipping up fear."&lt;/ref&gt;

When acting as the ombudsman on ''[[Red Eye w/Greg Gutfeld]]'' in 2011, [[Mike Baker (CIA officer)|Mike Baker]] presented a graph of the "wanker gap" for the first half of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Halftime Report: 12/28/11|url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/red-eye/index.html#/v/1352205221001/halftime-report-122911/?playlist_id=86926|accessdate=29 December 2011 | work=Fox News|date=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Baker has never given an explanation of the meaning of the "wanker gap."

[[Jack Vance]] wrote a science fiction book entitled ''[[Servants of the Wankh]]'' in 1969. The title was changed to ''The Wannek'' due to its sounding like wanker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starling.us/wankh_vs_wannek.html|title=Wankh versus Wannek|website=Starling.us|accessdate=10 April  2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413123247/http://starling.us/wankh_vs_wannek.html|archivedate=13 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iron Maiden]]'s song "[[El Dorado (song)|El Dorado]]" contains a veiled reference to the term in the line "I'm a clever banker's face, with just a letter out of place.” In live performances, singer [[Bruce Dickinson]] would change to an explicit mention: "I'm a clever wanker's face, just a banker out of place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=[[En Vivo! (Iron Maiden album)|En Vivo!]]|people=[[Iron Maiden]]|date=2012|publisher=EMI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015 the then [[Mayor of London]] [[Boris Johnson]] described British-born [[jihadists]] as "pornography-obsessed inadequates who only turn to radical Islam when they fail to make it with girls...They are literally wankers".&lt;ref name=Boris&gt;
{{cite news |last=Gardner |first=Bill |date=30 January 2015 |title=Boris Johnson: Porn-obsessed Isil jihadis are 'literally w***ers' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/11378700/Boris-Johnson-Porn-obsessed-Isil-jihadis-are-literally-wers.html |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |location=London |access-date=30 January 2015}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cockney Wanker]] is a long running character in ''[[Viz (comics)|Viz]]'', based on a [[stereotype|stereotypical]] male [[Cockney]].

[[Hard rock]] (formerly [[glam metal]]) band [[Vixen (band)|Vixen]]'s 1998 album ''[[Tangerine (Vixen album)|Tangerine]]'' contains an instrumental track titled "Swatting Flies in Wanker County", written by then-member [[Gina Stile]].

A '''word wall''' is [[literacy]] tool composed of an organized (typically in alphabetical order) collection of words which are displayed in large visible letters on a wall, [[bulletin board]], or other display surface in a classroom. The word wall is designed to be an interactive tool for students or others to use, and contains an array of words that can be used during [[writing]] and/or [[reading (activity)|reading]].

Although typically associated with reading/writing instruction, word walls are becoming commonplace in classrooms for all subject areas due to their ability to foster [[phonemic awareness]], display connections throughout word "families" (such as "-ick" words), serve as a support/reference for students, as well as create meaningful/memorable experiences with new vocabulary words.

Due to their flexible nature and ability to "grow" alongside the students, word walls can be used in classrooms ranging from [[pre-school]] through [[high school]].
Word walls are considered to be interactive and collaborative tools, as they are a student-created and student-centered artifact. Many variations of the word wall are currently in existence, including those featuring illustrations of the words and color-coded lists. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Lynn | last=Thompson | coauthors= | title=Schools Take Teens Back to 2 of the R's | date=2004-10-27 | publisher= | url =http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/snohomishcountynews/2002073401_reading27n.html | work =The Seattle Times | pages = | accessdate = 2008-02-06 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
