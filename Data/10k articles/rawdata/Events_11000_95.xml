The '''2016 Southern Aleppo campaign''' was a series of [[military operation]]s that started on 1 April when the [[Islamist]] rebel coalition [[Army of Conquest]], led by the [[al-Nusra Front]], launched a surprise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/khan-touman-recapture-becomes-inevitable-due-syrian-army-high-ground/|title=Khan Touman recapture becomes inevitable due to Syrian Army high ground|first=Chris|last=Tomson|date=9 May 2016|work=Al-Masdar News|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Offensive (military)|offensive]] south of [[Aleppo]]. The main objective of the operation was to recapture territory they had lost during the [[Aleppo offensive (October–December 2015)|large-scale government offensive]] in late 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/world/fierce-fighting-kills-35-around-syria-s-aleppo-monitor/story-soLx7oL5U1y6pV0J5D9e5I.html|title=Fierce fighting kills 35 around Syria's Aleppo: monitor|work=AFP|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tides"/&gt;

===First offensive (April 2016)===
In the afternoon of 1 April, rebel forces launched the offensive, targeting the strategic village of Tel el-Ais,&lt;ref name="important"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/rebels-launch-important-offensive-southern-aleppo/|title=Rebels launch important offensive in southern Aleppo|author=Leith Fadel|date=1 April 2016|work=[[Al-Masdar News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that overlooks the Damascus–Aleppo highway.&lt;ref name="capture"/&gt; The operation started with preparatory shelling&lt;ref name="important"/&gt; hitting the village's southwestern flank.&lt;ref name="storm"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/rebels-storm-strategic-town-southern-aleppo/|title=Rebels storm strategic village in southern Aleppo|author=Leith Fadel|date=1 April 2016|work=[[Al-Masdar News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed up by a ground assault that included an attack conducted by three suicide car bombers against government positions.&lt;ref name="gain"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-aleppo-idUSKCN0WZ0O5|title=Nusra Front, Syrian rebels attack government forces near Aleppo, gain ground|author=Reuters Editorial|date=2 April 2016|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one report, the bombers did not reach their targets,&lt;ref name="storm"/&gt; while according to another, they managed to clear the way for the rebel infantry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/04/al-nusrah-front-allies-launch-offensive-south-of-aleppo.php|title=Al Nusrah Front, allies launch offensive south of Aleppo|work=The Long War Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the attack on Tel el-Ais was eventually repelled. However, soon after, the rebels launched a second assault,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/breaking-rebels-capture-strategic-town-southern-aleppo/|title=Breaking: Rebels capture strategic town in southern Aleppo|author=Leith Fadel|date=2 April 2016|work=[[Al-Masdar News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and early on 2 April, they captured Tel el-Ais.&lt;ref name="capture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/04/02/al-qaida-other-insurgents-capture-syrian-village.html|title=Al-Qaida, other insurgents capture Syrian village|work=[[Fox News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Al-Nusra Front claimed they ambushed government troops as they were withdrawing from the village.&lt;ref name="gain"/&gt;

After securing the village, the rebels proceeded to attack and seize the Jabal Al-'Eiss (Mount Eiss) area, with the Army withdrawing towards Hader.&lt;ref name="heavy"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/rebels-advance-southern-aleppo-amid-heavy-casualties/|title=Rebels advance in southern Aleppo amid heavy casualties|author=Leith Fadel|date=3 April 2016|work=[[Al-Masdar News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, elsewhere along the frontline, the rebels captured the villages of Abu Ruwayl, Hawbar and Birnah as the offensive started, however they were recaptured by the military by the following morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=ThomasVLinge|author=Thomas van Linge|number=716270493528158208|date=2 April 2016|title=#Syria: map by opposition media, where rebels/jihadists captured al-Eis the regime recaptured Abu Ruwayl &amp;amp; Hawbar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=DPRKJones|author=Jason Jones|number=716336469246234624|date=2 April 2016|title=#SAA/Allies retake Birnah and Abu Ruwayl South #Aleppo.

As of early 3 April, a counter-attack had not yet started as government forces were awaiting the arrival of the final batch of ammunition and vehicles. Later in the day, a rebel source stated 100 government vehicles were seen heading towards the southern countryside of Aleppo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/IvanSidorenko1/status/716506574500532224|title=Ivan Sidorenko|work=Twitter}}{{dead link|date=January 2018|fix-attempted=yes|bot=TweetCiteBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 10 p.m. that evening,&lt;ref name="strategic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/hezbollah-syrian-army-storm-strategic-town-southern-aleppo/|title=Hezbollah, Syrian Army storm strategic town in southern Aleppo|author=Leith Fadel|date=4 April 2016|work=[[Al-Masdar News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Army counter-attack started and government forces reportedly captured several points on the eastern and northern perimeter of Tel el-Ais, coming to within a few hundred meters of the village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-begins-counter-offensive-southern-aleppo-russia-pounds-al-eis/|title=Syrian Army begins counter-offensive in southern Aleppo as Russia pounds al-Eis|author=Chris Tomson|date=4 April 2016|work=[[Al-Masdar News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, by the morning, two attacks to breach the village itself had been repelled, although the main assault had not yet taken place as airstrikes continued.&lt;ref name="strategic"/&gt;

On 5 April, a Syrian Air Force plane was shot down in the area of Tel el-Ais by the Al-Nusra Front,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/syria-monitor-rebels-shoot-down-warplane-south-of-aleppo|title=Syrian jet downed near Aleppo as fighting picks up across country|author=Kareem Shaheen|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the pilot captured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/al-nusra-aircraft-captures-pilot-aleppo/|title=Al-Nusra downs aircraft, captures pilot in Aleppo (Video)|author=Paul Antonopoulos|date=5 April 2016|work=[[Al-Masdar News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/islamist-rebels-shoot-down-syrian-warplane-1459872490|title=Islamist Rebels Shoot Down Syrian Warplane|author=Sam Dagher|date=5 April 2016|work=WSJ|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the day, members of the Iranian 65th Airborne Special Forces Brigade reportedly arrived in Hader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/iranian-special-forces-arrive-aleppo/|title=Iranian Special Forces arrive in Aleppo|author=Leith Fadel|date=5 April 2016|work=[[Al-Masdar News]]|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time since February, Russian air-strikes were conducted in the southern Aleppo countryside, in preparation for the Army counter-attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/breaking-russian-fighter-jets-pound-southern-aleppo/|title=Breaking: Russian fighter jets pound southern Aleppo|author=Leith Fadel|date=5 April 2016|work=[[Al-Masdar News]]|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''52246 Donaldjohanson''', provisional designation {{mp|1981 EQ|5}}, is a carbonaceous Erigonian [[asteroid]] from the inner regions of the [[asteroid belt]], approximately {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=off|sigfig=2|sp=us}} in diameter. It was discovered on 2 March 1981, by American astronomer [[Schelte Bus]] at the [[Siding Spring Observatory]] in Australia. The [[C-type asteroid]] is a target of the [[Lucy (spacecraft)|''Lucy'' mission]] and was aptly named after American paleoanthropologist [[Donald Johanson]].&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

''Donaldjohanson'' is a member of the [[Erigone family]] ({{small|[[FIN tbl#406|406]]}}),&lt;ref name="Levison-2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferret" /&gt; a large carbonaceous [[asteroid family]] of nearly 2,000 known members, which is named after its [[parent body]] [[163&amp;nbsp;Erigone]]. It is a relatively old family that was created approximately 130 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny-2014" /&gt;

It orbits the Sun in the [[Kirkwood gap|inner]] asteroid belt at a distance of 1.9–2.8&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 3 years and 8 months (1,345 days; [[semi-major axis]] of 2.38&amp;nbsp;AU). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.19 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 4[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; A first [[precovery]] was taken at the discovering observatory in February 1981, extending the body's [[observation arc]] by 2 weeks prior to its official discovery observation.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

== ''Lucy'' mission target ==

''Donaldjohanson'' is planned to be visited by the [[Lucy (spacecraft)|''Lucy'' spacecraft]] which will launch in 2021. The flyby is scheduled for 20 April 2025, and will approach the asteroid to a distance of 922 kilometers at a velocity of 13.4 kilometers per second.&lt;ref name="Levison-2017" /&gt; The mission's targets with their flyby dates are:&lt;ref name="Levison-2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="planetary.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2017/pdf/2025.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''52246 Donaldjohanson''' — 20 April 2025: 4&amp;nbsp;km diameter C-type asteroid in the inner main-belt, member of the Erigone family;
* [[3548 Eurybates]] — 12 August 2027: 64&amp;nbsp;km diameter C-type Jupiter Trojan in the Greek camp at {{L4}}, largest member of the only confirmed disruptive collisional family in the Trojans;
* [[15094 Polymele]] — 15 September 2027: 21&amp;nbsp;km diameter P-type Trojan at {{L4|nolink=yes}}, likely collisional fragment;
* [[11351 Leucus]] — 18 April 2028: 34&amp;nbsp;km diameter D-type [[List of slow rotators (minor planets)|slow rotator]] Trojan at {{L4|nolink=yes}};
* [[21900 Orus]] — 11 November 2028: 51&amp;nbsp;km diameter D-type Trojan at {{L4|nolink=yes}}; 
* [[617 Patroclus]] — 2 March 2033: P-type [[binary asteroid|binary]] Trojan. The primary, Patroclus, has a mean diameter of 113&amp;nbsp;km and its companion, Menoetius, has a diameter of 104&amp;nbsp;km. The pair orbit at a separation of 680&amp;nbsp;km. The binary resides in the [[Trojan camp]] at {{L5}}.

== Physical characteristics ==

''Donaldjohanson'' has been characterized as a carbonaceous [[C-type asteroid]],&lt;ref name="Levison-2017" /&gt; in-line with the C and [[C-type asteroid|X]] overall [[Asteroid spectral type|spectral type]] for Erigonian asteroids.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny-2014" /&gt;{{rp|23}} It has an [[absolute magnitude]] of 15.5.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; As of 2018, the asteroid's [[rotation period|period]], [[Poles of astronomical bodies|pole]] and shape remain unknown.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the survey carried out by NASA's [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] with its subsequent [[NEOWISE]] mission, ''Donaldjohanson'' measures 3.895 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] of 0.103.&lt;ref name="Masiero-2011" /&gt;

== Naming ==

This [[minor planet]] is planned to be visited by the ''[[Lucy (spacecraft)|Lucy]]'' spacecraft, which would observe it en route to its main target of several [[Jupiter trojans]].&lt;ref name="planetary.org" /&gt; The Lucy probe is named after the [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|"Lucy" hominid fossil]], while Donaldjohanson is named for that fossil's co-discoverer [[Donald Johanson]] (born 1943), an American [[paleoanthropologist]]. The approved naming citation was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 25 December 2015 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 97569}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

The '''Advanced Telescope for High ENergy Astrophysics''' ('''ATHENA''') is a future [[X-ray telescope]] of the [[European Space Agency]], under development for launch around 2028.  It is the second (L2) large class mission within ESA [[Cosmic Vision]] Program.&lt;ref name="l2mission"&gt;{{Cite web | title = ESA's new vision to study the invisible universe| publisher = ESA | url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ESA_s_new_vision_to_study_the_invisible_Universe |accessdate = 29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ATHENA will be one hundred times more sensitive than the best of existing X-ray telescopes—the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] and [[XMM-Newton]].&lt;ref name="BBCAthenaBuild"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-28053831|title=Athena: Europe plans huge X-ray space telescope|author=Jonathan Amos|date=27 June 2014|accessdate=22 October 2014|work=BBC News Online|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary goals of the mission are to map hot gas structures, determining their physical properties, and searching for [[supermassive black hole]]s.

==History and development==
The mission has its roots in two mission concepts from the early 2000s, for the ESA [[XEUS]] and NASA [[Constellation-X]] missions. 
In around 2008, these two proposals were merged into the joint NASA/ESA/JAXA [[International X-ray Observatory]] (IXO) proposal. However, 
in 2011 NASA withdrew from IXO due to funding issues, mainly due to large cost overruns on [[JWST]].  ESA then decided to proceed with a less costly modification of IXO, which became known as ATHENA. ATHENA was shortlisted for the first (L1) L-class Cosmic Vision selection in 2012, but lost to the [[Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17917102 |title=ESA selects 1bn-euro Juice probe to Jupiter |author=Jonathan Amos |date=2 May 2012|accessdate= 13 May 2012|work=[[BBC News Online]] |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; after some modifications ATHENA was selected in 2014 as the second (L2) mission &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sci.esa.int/ixo/48729-about-athena/|title=About ATHENA|publisher=[[ESA]]|date=2 April 2012|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="athenaReboot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sci.esa.int/cosmic-vision/54241-athena-to-study-the-hot-and-energetic-universe/|title=ESA Science &amp; Technology: Athena to study the hot and energetic Universe|publisher=[[ESA]]|date=27 June 2014|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final decision about rebooting the [[International X-ray Observatory]] took place on the 27 of June 2014.&lt;ref name="athenaReboot"/&gt; The selected science topic is "Hot and Energetic Universe" with an objective of answering two questions from [[astrophysics]]: How does ordinary matter assemble into the large-scale structures we see today? And how do [[black hole]]s grow and shape the [[universe]]?

The science team was appointed on 16 July 2014.&lt;ref name="teamAppointed"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://athena2.irap.omp.eu/spip.php?article64| title=ESA appointed Science Study Team| publisher=ATHENA website| date=16 July 2014| accessdate=19 October 2014| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005114832/http://athena2.irap.omp.eu/spip.php?article64| archivedate=5 October 2015| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial vibration testing of a silicon pore optics mirror module took place in August 2014.&lt;ref name="MirrorModuleVibrationTests"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sci.esa.int/cosmic-vision/54518-vibration-testing-of-silicon-pore-optics-module/| title=Vibration testing of silicon pore optics module| publisher=ESA| date=19 August 2014| accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESA's  Science Programme Committee will meet in 2019 for a full review and final approval of the project before construction to begin in the same year.&lt;ref name="BBCAthenaBuild"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25818-biggest-xray-eye-in-space-to-hunt-hot-cosmic-objects.html| title=Biggest X-ray eye in space to hunt hot cosmic objects| publisher=[[New Scientist]]| author=Jacob Aron| date=30 June 2014| accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orbit==
An [[Ariane 6]] launch vehicle will lift ATHENA in 2028 into a large amplitude [[halo orbit]] around {{L2|pt=yes}} of the Sun-Earth system through a direct transfer burn. {{L2|nolink=yes}} was selected due to its stable thermal environment, good sky visibility and high observing efficiency. ATHENA is planned to perform scheduled observations of up to 300 celestial locations per year, each lasting from half an hour up to 11 days, though it can be repointed to observe transient events.&lt;ref name="L2CosmicVision"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sci.esa.int/cosmic-vision/54517-athena/| title=ESA Science &amp; Technology: ATHENA| publisher=[[ESA]]| date=19 August 2014| accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Optics and instruments==
ATHENA will utilize a telescope with 12 m [[focal length]], and two primary instruments: high resolution X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU), and the Wide Field Imager (WFI) featuring a moderate resolution and a large field of view.&lt;ref name="L2CosmicVision"/&gt;

The telescope will use ESA-developed silicon pore optics providing combination of large field of view and high angular resolution. Each pore is a [[Wolter telescope|Wolter Type-I telescope]] only few mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in cross-section, with two reflections inside of each pore bringing X-ray in focus. In total, 1.5 million pores will be used. The telescope will be manufactured in 60&amp;nbsp;mm-wide arrays using commercially available silicon wafers.&lt;ref name="L2CosmicVision"/&gt;

;X-ray Integral Field Unit
X-IFU utilizes an array of cryogenically cooled [[transition edge sensor]]s with a detection range of 0.2–12 keV. Total field of view is 5 [[arcminute]]s.&lt;ref name="Xifu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://x-ifu.irap.omp.eu/spip.php?rubrique1 |title=The X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) |publisher=ATHENA website |accessdate=19 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005132533/http://x-ifu.irap.omp.eu/spip.php?rubrique1 |archivedate=5 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://x-ifu-resources.irap.omp.eu/PUBLIC/PUBLICATIONS/2014_SPIE_Montreal/2014_Ravera_SPIE2014_X-IFU_v5.pdf |title=The X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) for Athena}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Wide Field Imager
The Wide Field Imager (WFI) is an [[X-ray spectroscopy|X-ray spectrometer]] utilizing five arrays of [[Field-effect transistor#p-channel|p-channel field-effect transistor]]s with a detection range of 0.1–15 keV. Its central chip has a resolution of 256 × 256 px and a field of view 7.5 [[arcminute]]s.

'''Argentina v England''', played on 22 June 1986, was a [[Association football|football]] match between [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and [[England national football team|England]] in the quarter-finals of the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] at the [[Estadio Azteca]] in Mexico City. The game was held four years after the [[Falklands War]] between Argentina and the United Kingdom, and was a key part in the already intense [[Argentina–England football rivalry]]. It was also a match which included two of the most famous goals in football history, both scored by [[Diego Maradona]].

The first goal, after 51 minutes, was to become known as the "Hand of God goal", which Maradona scored by using his hand. His second, four minutes after his first, saw him dribble past five England players, Beardsley, Reid, Butcher, Fenwick, Butcher (again), and finally goalkeeper Peter Shilton, and became known as the "Goal of the Century".  Argentina won the game 2–1 and went on to win the 1986 World Cup with a victory over [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup Final|final match]]. Maradona won the [[FIFA World Cup awards|golden ball]] for player of the tournament; England's goalscorer on the day, [[Gary Lineker]], won the [[FIFA World Cup awards|golden boot]] for being the tournament's top scorer.

Despite the popularity of [[Osvaldo Ardiles]] and [[Ricardo Villa]], Argentines who played with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in England in an era before it was commonplace for clubs to have non-British players,&lt;ref name="OSM"/&gt; the rivalry remained strong.

Outside football, the [[Falklands War]] in 1982 increased the mistrust between England and Argentina.  Britain administrates the [[Falkland Islands]], a small archipelago in the [[South Atlantic Ocean|South Atlantic]], as a British overseas territory; Argentina [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|claims]] the islands as Islas Malvinas. On 2 April 1982, Argentina's forces invaded the islands. Britain considered this an invasion of its territory and sent a naval [[task force]] that recaptured the Islands on 14 June 1982. Though the two nations were never officially at war, the conflict resulted in 258 British and 655 Argentine deaths. As a result, the match taking place four years after the war was emotionally charged. Following the game, Maradona stated: "Although we had said before the game that football had nothing to do with the Malvinas war, we knew they had killed a lot of Argentine boys there, killed them like little birds. And this was revenge."&lt;ref name="OSM"/&gt;

===1986 FIFA World Cup===

The [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] was held in Mexico after the original hosts, [[Colombia]], were unable to host the tournament. England qualified for the finals undefeated, topping [[1986 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|Group 3]] in the [[UEFA]] zone; Argentina also topped [[1986 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|their qualifying group]] in [[CONMEBOL]]. In the early stages of the tournament, Argentina had been comfortable, winning two and drawing one in the group stage. England had qualified more narrowly, with a 3–0 win over [[Poland national football team|Poland]] in the final match putting them into the round of 16. Both teams won comfortably against South American opposition in that round, Argentina against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] and England against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]].&lt;ref name="FIFA review"/&gt; Although neither team began the tournaments as favourites,&lt;ref name="Eng caps"&gt;[http://www.englandcaps.co.uk/1986EnglandVSArgentina.html 1986 England:Argentina] Englandcaps.co.uk; Retrieved 27 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; England's form had been improving throughout the World Cup and Argentina were buoyed by the skill of Maradona.

===Argentina kit change===
Argentina beat Uruguay 1{{endash}}0 in the round of 16 wearing blue cotton shirts that coach [[Carlos Bilardo]] believed would prove too uncomfortable in the searing Mexico City heat.&lt;ref name=shirts&gt;{{cite web|title=Curious tales of World Cup shirts|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2014/m=5/news=curious-tales-of-world-cup-shirts-2340153.html|work=FIFA.com|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bilardo asked Argentina's kit manufacturer to come up with lighter blue shirts for the quarter-final, an impossible request given the short deadline.  With three days to go before the match, he sent out Ruben Moschella, a member of his coaching staff, to scour the shops of the Mexican capital for a suitable kit. He returned with two different blue shirts, which they subsequently weighed but were unable to choose between. It was then that Diego Maradona appeared and said: "That’s a nice jersey. We’ll beat England in that."&lt;ref name="shirts"/&gt;  Moschella returned to the shop and bought 38 of the shirts for the side to wear against England. A designer fashioned some makeshift [[Argentine Football Association]] (AFA) badges, which were then sewn on to each jersey, with silvery American Football shirt numbers hurriedly ironed on to the backs.&lt;ref name="shirts"/&gt;

==Match==

===Previous incidents===
Before the [[Argentina and England football rivalry#1986 World Cup|1986 game]] fans from both countries had a fight in [[Mexico City]] streets and into the stadium too.&lt;ref name="Clarin"&gt;{{cite news |title=No podemos impedir que viajen|publisher=''Clarín'' |date=16 May 2006|url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2006/05/16/deportes/d-05501.htm|accessdate=6 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, several English fans were hospitalised while some of their flags were stolen by Argentine [[barra brava|barrabravas]]. Those flags would be then exhibited by [[Boca Juniors]]'s supporters during some [[Argentine Primera División|Argentine league]] matches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdf.diariohoy.net/1998/06/23/cla6y7.pdf "Pánico en St. Etienne: Hooligans go home"], 23 June 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===First half===
The game started with both teams exchanging chances.&lt;ref name="Eng caps"/&gt; Argentina began to dominate, with England's [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Peter Shilton]] saving several good chances, many created by Maradona. [[Peter Beardsley]] had England's best chance after 13 minutes, following a slip from [[Nery Pumpido]] in Argentina's goal, but failed to take it.&lt;ref name="FIFA review"/&gt; At half time, the score was 0{{endash}}0, Argentina having had much more of the possession and territory – and done a great deal more of the running – but having failed to get through England's defence.

===Second half===
It was the second half of the match that was to see the two incidents for which the game was to become both famous and infamous.&lt;ref name="Kuper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eng caps"/&gt;

====The "Hand of God"====

Six minutes into the second half, Maradona cut inside from the left and played a diagonal low pass to the edge of the area to teammate [[Jorge Valdano]] and continued his run in the hope of a one-two movement. Maradona's pass was played slightly behind Valdano and reached England's [[Steve Hodge]], the [[midfielder|left midfielder]] who had dropped back to defend.

Hodge tried to hook the ball clear but miscued it. The ball looped off his foot and into the penalty area, toward Maradona, who had continued his run. England goalkeeper [[Peter Shilton]] came out of his goal to punch the ball clear. Maradona, despite being 8 inches (20&amp;nbsp;cm) shorter than the 6-foot-1 (1.85&amp;nbsp;m) Shilton, reached it first with his outside left hand. The ball bounced into the goal. [[referee (association football)|Referee]] [[Ali Bin Nasser]] of [[Tunisia]] said he did not see the infringement and allowed the goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/08/world-cup-moments-maradona-hand-god|title= World Cup: 25 stunning moments … No9: Diego Maradona's Hand of God|date=8 April 2014|work=Guardian|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maradona later said, "I was waiting for my teammates to embrace me, and no one came... I told them, 'Come hug me, or the referee isn't going to allow it.'"&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, Mark. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/mark_bechtel/08/24/daily.blog/index.html "The Right Way to Cheat: Pulling a Fast One Is Sometimes Part of the Game"]. CNNSI. 24 August 2005. Retrieved 19 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the post-game press conference, Maradona facetiously commented that the goal was scored ''"un poco con la cabeza de Maradona y otro poco con la mano de Dios"'' ("a little with the head of Maradona and a little with the hand of God"), after which it became known as the "Hand of God" goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/07/26/diego-maradona-admits-video-replay-would-have-erased-his-hand-of-god-goal/?noredirect=on|title=Diego Maradona admits video replay would have erased his ‘Hand of God’ goal - The Washington Post|last=Bonesteel|first=Mark|date=26 July 2017|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal helped intensify the footballing rivalry between the two nations.&lt;ref name="goal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/diego-maradona-the-hand-of-god-the-most-infamous-goal-in/15sev9f2t2sn814f2n8d2ah3zc|title=Diego Maradona &amp; the Hand of God: The most infamous goal in World Cup history|work=[[Goal (website)|Goal]]|accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cesar Luis Menotti]] said, "People said, 'Great! Better, much better, that the goal was so unjust, so cruel, because it hurt the English more.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2002/may/19/worldcupfootball2002.football2|title=England v Argentina - A history|last=Carlin|first=John|date=19 May 2002|work=[[TheGuardian.com]]|accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Goal of the Century====

[[File:Maradona vs england.jpg|thumb|right|Maradona celebrating the goal. Butcher (6) is seated on the field.]]

Four minutes after the ''Hand of God'' goal came ''The Goal of the Century'', which is often said to be the greatest individual goal of all time.&lt;ref name="FIFA review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New chapter in an historic rivalry"/&gt; Midfielder [[Héctor Enrique]] passed the ball to Maradona inside his own half. Maradona then began his 60-yard, 10-second dash towards the English goal, passing four English outfield players: [[Peter Beardsley]], [[Peter Reid]], [[Terry Butcher]] (twice) and [[Terry Fenwick]]. Maradona finished the move with a [[Dummy (football)|feint]] that left goalkeeper [[Peter Shilton]] on his bottom, before slotting the ball into the net to make the score 2–0 to Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/6700645/Top-10-World-Cup-goals.html?mobile=basic "Top 10 World Cup goals"]. The Telegraph. Retrieved 19 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

About the goal, Maradona said, "I made the play to give it to [[Jorge Valdano|Valdano]], but when I got to the area they surrounded me and I had no space. Therefore, I had to continue the play and finish it myself."&lt;ref&gt;Maradona, D. ''Maradona: The Autobiography of Soccer's Greatest and Most Controversial Star'', p.129. Skyhorse Publishing, 2007. {{ISBN|1-60239-027-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He later complimented the fair play of the English team, saying, "I don't think I could have done it against any other team because they all used to knock you down; they are probably the noblest in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rediff.com/sports/football/2002/may/30mara.htm|title=Maradona's strike is goal of century|publisher=Rediff.com|date=30 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the goal was voted 'Goal of the Century' as part of the buildup to the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] tournament on the [[FIFA]] [[website]].&lt;ref name=top10&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/newscentre/news/newsid=82406/index.html |title=Diego Maradona goal voted the FIFA World Cup Goal of the Century |date=30 May 2002 |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It beat a goal scored by England's [[Michael Owen]] against Argentina in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], which came second, whilst another 1986 FIFA World Cup goal by Maradona, from the semi-final match against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], came fourth.

In Spanish-speaking countries, this goal is usually associated with the live commentary by Uruguayan journalist [[Víctor Hugo Morales]] (translation from Spanish):

{{quotation|He's going to pass it to Diego, there's Maradona with it, two men on him, Maradona steps on the ball, there goes down the right flank the genius of world football, he leaves the wing and he's going to pass it to Burruchaga...

It is to cry for, excuse me! Maradona, in a memorable run, in the best play of all times! Little cosmic kite, which planet did you come from, to leave so many Englishmen behind, so that the country becomes a clenched fist crying for Argentina? Argentina 2, England 0! Diegoal, Diegoal, Diego Armando Maradona! Thank you, God, for football, for Maradona, for these tears, for this Argentina 2, England 0.|Víctor Hugo Morales&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7404jcxTu0o|title=Maradona Gol a los ingleses por V H morales|editor=Youtube|date=25 April 2007|accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Lineker's goal and Argentine victory====

Argentina's lead forced England into a double-attacking substitution, bringing on Barnes and Waddle, and it nearly paid off: as the Argentine team began to tire after their earlier efforts, England began to push further up the pitch, looking to get back into the game. Driven by [[Glenn Hoddle]] and [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]], they created chances, and [[Gary Lineker]] scored his sixth goal of the tournament in the 80th minute from a Barnes cross.&lt;ref name="FIFA review"/&gt; Argentina had further chances as well, with [[Carlos Daniel Tapia|Carlos Tapia]] hitting the inside of the post immediately after England's goal.&lt;ref name="Eng caps"/&gt; England were unable to score an equaliser and Argentina won the match 2–1.

==Aftermath==
Hodge swapped shirts with Maradona after the game; Hodge lent out the Argentine's jersey to the [[National Football Museum]] in the 2000s. The game added hugely to the rivalry between the two teams.&lt;ref name="goal"/&gt; In Argentina, the game was seen as revenge for the [[Falklands War]] and for what they still see as [[Argentina–England football rivalry#1966 World Cup|the unfair game]] in the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]]. The former Argentine international [[Roberto Perfumo]] stated that "In 1986, winning that game against England was enough. Winning the World Cup was secondary for us. Beating England was our real aim".&lt;ref name="OSM"/&gt;

Although the first goal proved highly controversial in England, Maradona's second goal was nevertheless recognized all over the world for its brilliance. A notable example of the English appreciation of his genius occurred in a 2002 poll conducted by [[Channel 4]], where the UK public voted Maradona's performance sixth in the list of the [[100 Greatest (UK TV series)|100 Greatest Sporting Moments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest_sporting/results.html |title=100 Greatest Sporting Moments – Results |work=[[Channel 4]] |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the Estadio Azteca a statue of Maradona scoring the goal was erected to commemorate the moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldrec.info/2007/04/28/messis-goal-better-than-maradonas-goal-of-the-century/ |title=Messi's goal better than Maradona's goal of the century? |date=28 April 2007 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Argentina went on to win the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] by defeating [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup Final|final match]], as well as finishing runners-up in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]. England's Lineker won the Golden Boot for being top scorer in the 1986 FIFA World Cup. With a similar squad, England finished fourth in the 1990 FIFA World Cup, their highest finish since 1966.

The two teams have since met twice in World Cup matches. Argentina won a round-of-16 match in the shootout at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], after one [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] was awarded to each side, [[David Beckham]] was sent off, [[Sol Campbell]] had a goal disallowed and [[Michael Owen]] scored his famous goal. At the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], the teams met in the group stage, and the match, which began at 12:30 PM UK time, was described as the "longest lunch break in history" as millions in England stopped their jobs and activities to watch the game on TV. England won 1–0 courtesy of a foul by [[Mauricio Pochettino]] on Michael Owen. David Beckham's penalty kick won the match for England and Argentina later failed to advance to the knockout round.&lt;ref name=top10/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O_EyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pwgGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5479,1886237&amp;dq=longest+lunch+break+england+argentina&amp;hl=en|title=The Free Lance-Star - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 August 2015, Maradona visited [[Ali Bin Nasser]], the referee of the 1986 World Cup quarter-final, at his home in Tunisia, and paid tribute to him by giving him an Argentine jersey bearing his signature, and referred to him as "my eternal friend".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marca.com/en/2015/08/17/en/football/international_football/1439845054.html|title=International football: Maradona holds up his hands in apology - MARCA.com (English version)|first=|last=MARCA.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/459978/Argentine-Diego-Maradona-ref-Ali-Bennaceur-Hand-of-God-goal|title='My eternal friend': Diego Maradona meets infamous ref who gave 'Hand of God' goal|date=18 August 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/08/18/inenglish/1439899213_516413.html|title=Maradona visits Tunisian referee who awarded him 1986 “Hand of God” goal|first=Alejandro|last=Rebossio|date=18 August 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/sports/2015/08/18/Soccer-Hugged-by-the-hands-of-God-infamous-ref-meets-Maradona.html|title=Maradona meets infamous ‘hand of God’ referee in Tunisia|website=english.alarabiya.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third '''Battle of Ramla''' (or '''Ramleh''') took place on 27 August 1105 between the [[Crusade]]r [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the [[Fatimids]] of [[Egypt]]. The town of [[Ramla]] lay on the road from [[Jerusalem]] to [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]], the latter of which was the largest Fatimid fortress in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. From Ascalon the Fatimid vizier, [[Al-Afdal Shahanshah]], launched almost annual attacks into the newly founded Crusader kingdom from 1099 to 1107. Of the three battles the Crusaders fought at Ramla early in the twelfth century, the third was the most bloody.

Egyptian armies of the period relied on masses of Sudanese bowmen supported by Arab and Berber [[cavalry]]. Since the archers were on foot and the horsemen awaited attack with lance and sword, an Egyptian army provided exactly the sort of immobile target that the Frankish heavy cavalry excelled in attacking. Whereas the Crusaders developed a healthy respect for the harass and surround tactics of the Turkish [[horse archer]]s, they tended to discount the effectiveness of the Egyptian armies. While overconfidence led to a Crusader disaster at the second battle of Ramla, the more frequent result was a Fatimid defeat. "The Franks never, until the reign of [[Saladin]], feared the Egyptian as they did the armies from Muslim [[Syria]] and [[Mesopotamia]]."&lt;ref&gt;Smail, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

As at Ramla in 1101, in 1105 the Crusaders had both [[cavalry]] and [[infantry]] under the leadership of [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]]. At the third battle, however, the Egyptians were reinforced by a [[Seljuks|Seljuk Turkish]] force from [[Damascus]], including [[mounted archery]], the great menace of the Crusaders. After they withstood the initial Frankish cavalry charge the battle raged for most of the day. Although Baldwin was once again able to drive the Egyptians from the field of battle and loot the enemy camp he was unable to pursue them any further: "the Franks appear to have owed their victory to the activity of Baldwin. He vanquished the Turks when they were becoming a serious threat to his rear, and returned to the main battle to lead the decisive charge which defeated the Egyptians."&lt;ref&gt;Smail, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the victory the Egyptians continued to make annual raids into the Kingdom of Jeruselum with some reaching the walls of Jerusalem itself before being pushed back. The next major engagement between Fatimids and Crusaders was the [[Battle of Yibneh]] in 1123.

The '''Broadway Theatre''' (formerly '''Universal's Colony Theatre''', '''B.S. Moss' Broadway Theatre''', '''Earl Carroll's Broadway Theatre''', and '''Ciné Roma''') is a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Theater (building)|theatre]] located in [[midtown Manhattan]]. It has a large [[seating capacity]] of 1,761, and unlike most Broadway theaters, it is actually located on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], at number 1681.

Designed by architect [[Eugene De Rosa]] for Benjamin S. Moss, it opened as ''B.S. Moss's Colony Theatre'' on [[Christmas Day]] 1924 as a venue for [[vaudeville]] shows and motion pictures. The theater has operated under many names and owners. It was renamed ''Universal's Colony Theatre'', ''B.S. Moss' Broadway Theatre'', and ''Earl Carroll's Broadway Theatre'' before becoming a [[legitimate theater]] house simply called ''Broadway Theatre'' on December 8, 1930. In 1937, known as ''Ciné Roma'', it showed [[Italian film]]s.&lt;ref name="NYTix"/&gt; For a short time during the 1950s it showed [[Cinerama]] films.&lt;ref name="BTHistory"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Broadway Theater History | work =New York City Theater | year =2011 | url =http://www.newyorkcitytheatre.com/theaters/broadwaytheater/history.php| accessdate =February 14, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 18, 1928 the first [[Mickey Mouse]] cartoon released to the public, [[Steamboat Willie]], debuted at the Colony. Producer [[Walt Disney]] returned on November 13, 1940 to debut the feature film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' in [[Fantasound]], an early stereo system.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} 

The legitimate theater opened in 1930 with ''[[The New Yorkers]]'' by [[Cole Porter]]. Stars such as [[Milton Berle]], [[Alfred Drake]], [[José Ferrer]], [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Vivien Leigh]], [[Zero Mostel]], and [[Mae West]] have appeared on stage.&lt;ref name="NYTix"&gt;{{cite web | title =The Broadway Theatre|publisher =New York TV Show Tickets Inc. | year =2008  | url =http://www.nytix.com/Links/Broadway/Theaters/broadway.html| accessdate =February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Shubert Organization]] bought the theater in 1939 and renovated it extensively in 1956 and 1986. It has long been a popular theatre for producers of [[musical theatre|musicals]] because of large seating capacity, and the large stage, which is nearly sixty feet deep. Often plays that have become successful in smaller theaters have transferred to the Broadway Theatre.&lt;ref name="NYTix"/&gt;

The '''Central Park jogger case''' was a major news story that involved the [[assault]] and [[rape]] of Trisha Meili, a [[White Americans|white]] female jogger, and attacks on others in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Central Park]] on the night of April 19, 1989. The attack on the jogger left her in a coma for 12 days. Meili was a 28-year-old investment banker at the time. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the attack was "one of the most widely publicized crimes of the 1980s".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/17/nyregion/smart-driven-woman-overcomes-reluctance.html|title='Smart, Driven' Woman Overcomes Reluctance|date=July 17, 1990|work=The New York Times|first=M. A. |last=Farber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of the attack, five juvenile males – four African American and one Hispanic – were apprehended in connection with a number of attacks in Central Park committed by around 30 teenage perpetrators. The defendants were tried variously for assault, robbery, riot, rape, sexual abuse, and attempted murder relating to Meili's and other attacks in the park, based solely on confessions that they said were coerced and false. Before the trial, the FBI tested the DNA of the rape kit and found it did not match to any of the tested suspects. The office of District Attorney [[Robert Morgenthau]] presented these findings to the press as "inconclusive".&lt;ref name="Schanberg"/&gt; They were convicted in 1990 by juries in two separate trials. Subsequently, known as the '''Central Park Five''', they received sentences ranging from 5 to 15 years. Four of the convictions were appealed and the convictions were affirmed by appellate courts. The defendants spent between 6 and 13 years in prison.

In 2002, Matias Reyes, a convicted murderer and [[serial rapist]] in prison, confessed to raping the jogger, and [[DNA evidence]] confirmed his guilt. He knew facts about the crime that only the offender could have known, and also said he committed the rape alone.&lt;ref&gt;ABC Nightline - December 3, 2002, "The verdict."&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his confession, Reyes was already serving a [[life sentence]]. He was not prosecuted for raping Meili, because the [[statute of limitations]] had passed by the time he confessed. Morgenthau suggested to the court that the five men's convictions related to the assault and rape of Meili and to attacks on others to which they had confessed be [[vacate]]d (a legal position in which the parties are treated as though no trial has taken place) and withdrew the charges. Their convictions were vacated in 2002.

The five convicted men sued New York City in 2003 for malicious prosecution, racial discrimination, and emotional distress. The city refused to settle the suits for a decade under then-Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]], because the city's lawyers felt they would win. However, after [[Bill de Blasio]] became mayor and supported the settlement, the city settled the case for $41&amp;nbsp;million in 2014. As of December 2014, the five men were pursuing an additional $52&amp;nbsp;million in damages from New York State in the [[New York Court of Claims]].

== Attacks ==
At 9 p.m. on the night of April 19, 1989, a group of over 30 teenagers who lived in [[East Harlem]] entered [[Manhattan]]'s [[Central Park]] at an entrance in [[Harlem]], near Central Park North.&lt;ref name="harvard.edu"&gt;Jim Dwyer and Kevin Flynn, [http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/dnabook/NY-HOW%20CENT%20PK%20CASE%20COLLPSD.1st "New Light on Jogger's Rape Calls Evidence Into Question"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051718/http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/dnabook/NY-HOW%20CENT%20PK%20CASE%20COLLPSD.1st|date=March 4, 2016}}, ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; They committed several attacks, assaults, and robberies in the northernmost part of Manhattan's Central Park.&lt;ref name="Morgenthau" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/21/nyregion/youths-rape-and-beat-central-park-jogger.html|title=Youths Rape and Beat Central Park Jogger|date=April 21, 1989|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The New York Times'', the attacks committed that night were "one of the most widely publicized crimes of the 1980s".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com2" /&gt; According to a police investigation, the main suspects were gangs of teenagers who would assault strangers as part of an activity that became known as "wilding". New York City detectives said the term was used by the suspects themselves to describe their actions to police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jogger's Attackers Terrorized at Least 9 in 2 Hours|last=Pitt|first=David E.|date=April 22, 1989|work=[[The New York Times]]|quote=The youths who raped and savagely beat a young investment banker as she jogged in Central Park Wednesday night were part of a loosely organized gang of 32 schoolboys whose random, motiveless assaults terrorized at least eight other people over nearly two hours, senior police investigators said yesterday.

=== Assault on Trisha Meili ===
Trisha Meili was going for a run on her usual path in Central Park shortly before 9&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesleader.com/archive/206239/stories-lccc-grads-hear-healing-story-from-central-park-jogger94247|title=LCCC grads hear healing story from Central Park jogger|first=Camille|last=Fioti|date=May 28, 2010|work=Times Leader|accessdate=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prenhall.com"&gt;[http://wps.prenhall.com/wps/media/objects/13023/13335893/downloadables/NYDA%20motion%20in%20Jogger%20case.pdf Wps.prenhall.com]&lt;/ref&gt; While [[jogging]] in the park, she was knocked down, dragged or chased nearly {{convert|300|ft|m}}, and violently assaulted.&lt;ref name="harvard.edu" /&gt; She was raped and almost beaten to death.&lt;ref name="stephenrobinson"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3593471/She-was-so-badly-beaten-the-priest-administered-last-rites.html|title=She was so badly beaten, the priest administered last rites|first=Stephen |last=Robinson|date=April 27, 2003|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; About four hours later at 1:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., she was found naked, gagged, tied up, and covered in mud and blood.

Meili was a [[Phi Beta Kappa]] economics major at [[Wellesley College]], where she received a [[B.A.]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="google.com2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nydailynews.com1" /&gt; The chairman of Wellesley's economics department said: "She was brilliant, probably one of the top four or five students of the decade."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com2" /&gt; In 1986, she earned an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] from [[Yale]] and an [[Master of Business Administration|M.B.A.]] in finance from the [[Yale School of Management]].&lt;ref name="post-gazette.com" /&gt;  She worked from the summer of 1986 until the attack as an associate and then a vice president in the corporate finance department and energy group of [[Salomon Brothers]].&lt;ref name="google.com2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="post-gazette.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn.com1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="harvard.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3080126/ns/dateline_nbc-books/t/i-am-central-park-jogger/#.VPUtYi7QNm0|title=‘I am the Central Park Jogger’|publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meili lived on East 83rd Street between [[York Avenue|York]] and [[East End Avenue]]s on the [[Upper East Side]] of Manhattan.  At the time of the attack, she was 28 years old and weighed less than 100 pounds (45&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name="google.com2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="post-gazette.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn.com1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3080126/ns/dateline_nbc-books/t/i-am-central-park-jogger/|title=I am the Central Park Jogger|publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harvard.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;

In most media accounts of the incident at that time, Meili was simply referred to as the "Central Park Jogger". However, two local TV stations violated media policy of not publicly identifying the victims of sex crimes and released her name in the days immediately following the attack. Two newspapers aimed at the African-American community—''[[The City Sun]]'' and the ''[[The New York Amsterdam News|Amsterdam News]]''—and the black-owned [[talk radio]] station [[WLIB]] continued to do so as the case progressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/women-under-assault-206518|title=Women Under Assault|date=1990-07-15|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="didion" /&gt; The [[Aton Edwards#Ready UP!

In April 2003, Meili confirmed her identity to the media and published a memoir entitled  ''I Am the Central Park Jogger''. She then began a career as an inspirational speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=I am the Central Park Jogger|last=Meili|first=Trisha|publisher=Scribner|year=2003|isbn=0-7432-4437-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also works with victims of sexual assault and brain injury in the Mount Sinai sexual assault and violence intervention program.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com1" /&gt; She continues to manifest some physiological after-effects of the assault, including [[memory loss]].&lt;ref name="post-gazette.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/Oprah-Interviews-the-Central-Park-Jogger|title=Oprah Talks to the Central Park Jogger|work=Oprah.com|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/27/style/a-night-out-with-trisha-meili-something-to-celebrate.html|title=A Night Out With/Trisha Meili – Something to Celebrate|date=April 27, 2003|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday.com" /&gt;

== Arrests and investigation ==

=== Arrest of five youths ===
[[File:Centralpark_map.png|link=Central Park#Attractions|right|thumb|upright=1.7|Map of [[Central Park]] and its attractions]]
The police were dispatched at 9:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. and responded with scooters and unmarked cars. They apprehended Raymond Santana and Kevin Richardson along with other teenagers at approximately 10:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. on [[Central Park West]] and 102nd Street.&lt;ref name="harvard.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prenhall.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nymag.com" /&gt; Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam, and Korey Wise were brought in for questioning later, after having been identified by other youths as participants in or present at some of the attacks.&lt;ref name="prenhall.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nymag.com" /&gt;

The five juveniles were interviewed for hours. Santana, McCray, and Richardson all made video statements in the presence of their respective parents or guardians.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/19/decoding-the-crime-of-the-century-the-real-story-of-the-central-park-five.html|title=The Myth of the Central Park Five|work=The Daily Beast|date=October 19, 2014|first=Edward |last=Conlon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wise made a number of statements on his own, in accordance with the law.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast.com" /&gt; Salaam told the police he was 16 years old and showed them identification to prove it. If a suspect had reached 16 years of age, his parents or guardians no longer had a right to accompany him during police questioning, or to refuse to permit him to answer any questions.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast.com" /&gt; After Salaam's mother arrived, the police stopped the questioning, but Salaam's admissions were admitted into testimony.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast.com" /&gt;

Additionally, before the raped jogger was found, one of the other boys the police had rounded up, sitting in the back of a police car, blurted that he "didn't do the murder" and named Antron McCray as the perpetrator. Kevin Richardson, who was sitting beside him, immediately agreed, saying "Antron did it".&lt;ref name="thedailybeast.com" /&gt; Later, after Raymond Santana was interrogated about the rape and while he was being driven to another precinct, he on his own exclaimed: "I had nothing to do with the rape. All I did was feel her tits."&lt;ref name="thedailybeast.com" /&gt;

Normal police procedure stipulated that the names of criminal suspects under the age of 16 were to be withheld from the media and the public. This policy was ignored when the names of the arrested juveniles were released to the press before any of them had been formally [[arraignment|arraigned]] or [[indictment|indicted]], including one 14-year-old who was ultimately not charged.&lt;ref name="didion" /&gt; The media's decision to print the names, photos, and addresses of the juvenile suspects while withholding Meili's identity was cited by the editors of the ''City Sun'' and the ''Amsterdam News'' to explain their own continued use of Meili's name in their coverage of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Not Just Race, Not Just Gender: Black Feminist Readings|last=Smith|first=Valerie|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=0-415-90325-4|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Confessions ===
Four of the five [[Confession (legal)|confessed]] to a number of the attacks committed in the park that night, and implicated one or more of the others.&lt;ref name="prenhall.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thedailybeast.com"/&gt; None of the five said they themselves actually raped the jogger, but each confessed to being an accomplice to the rape.&lt;ref name="prenhall.com"/&gt; All five said that they themselves had only helped restrain the jogger, or touched her, while one or more others raped her.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast.com"/&gt; Antron McCray said that a "Puerto Rican kid with a hoodie" had been the one who raped the jogger.&lt;ref name="prenhall.com"/&gt; While he was incarcerated in the [[Rikers Island]] jail, Korey Wise told the older sister of a friend of his, according to her testimony, that he had only held the jogger down.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast.com"/&gt;

Yusef Salaam made verbal admissions, but refused to sign a confession or make one on videotape. However, Salaam was implicated by all of the other four, and convicted at trial. Six others were charged with committing crimes in the park that night as well. They pleaded guilty and received sentences of six months to four and a half years.&lt;ref name="prenhall.com" /&gt; On appeal, Salaam's supporters and attorneys charged that he had been held by police without access to parents or guardians. The majority appellate court decision noted that Salaam had initially lied to police in claiming to be 16, and he had backed up his claim with a transit pass that indeed (falsely, as it turned out) indicated that he was 16. When Salaam informed police of his true age, police permitted his mother to be present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Detective Cites Coercion of Teen|date=July 24, 1990|newspaper=[[Albany Times Union]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|page=B6|quote=Justice Thomas B. Galligan allowed the statements as evidence because Salaam gave police a student transit pass with a false birth date written in. The false birth date indicated Salaam was a year older that he was.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis indicated that the [[Genetic fingerprinting|DNA]] collected at the crime scene did not match any of the suspects, and that it had come from a single, as yet unknown person.&lt;ref name="Schanberg" /&gt; Since no DNA evidence tied the suspects to the crime, the prosecution's case rested almost entirely on the confessions.&lt;ref name="didion" /&gt; One of the suspects' supporters, Reverend [[Calvin O. Butts]] of the [[Abyssinian Baptist Church]] in [[Harlem]], told ''The New York Times'', "The first thing you do in the United States of America when a white woman is raped is round up a bunch of black youths, and I think that's what happened here."&lt;ref name="didion" /&gt;

Although the suspects (except Salaam) had confessed on videotape in the presence of a parent or guardian, they retracted their statements within weeks, claiming that they had been intimidated, lied to, and coerced into making [[false confession]]s.&lt;ref name="Schanberg"&gt;{{cite news |first=Sydney  |last=Schanberg |authorlink=Sydney Schanberg|title=A Journey Through the Tangled Case of the Central Park Jogger |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/a-journey-through-the-tangled-case-of-the-central-park-jogger-6436053 |quote=Every now and again, we get a look, usually no more than a glimpse, at how the justice system really works.

==Trials==

=== Recommendation to vacate charges ===
[[File:NLN Yusef Salaam.jpg|thumb|Yusef Salaam in 2009, seven years after his conviction was vacated]]

Reyes's confession, plus DNA evidence confirming his participation in the rape, led the office of [[District Attorney]] [[Robert M. Morgenthau]] to recommend [[vacated judgment|vacating]] the convictions of the defendants originally found guilty and sentenced to prison.&lt;ref name="Morgenthau" /&gt; Supporters of the five defendants again claimed that their confessions had been coerced by police. An examination of the inconsistencies between their confessions led the prosecutor to question the veracity of their confessions. DA Morgenthau's office wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A comparison of the statements reveals troubling discrepancies. ... The accounts given by the five defendants differed from one another on the specific details of virtually every major aspect of the crime—who initiated the attack, who knocked the victim down, who undressed her, who struck her, who held her, who raped her, what weapons were used in the course of the assault, and when in the sequence of events the attack took place. ... In many other respects the defendants' statements were not corroborated by, consistent with, or explanatory of objective, independent evidence. And some of what they said was simply contrary to established fact.&lt;ref name="Morgenthau"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/wise.pdf |title=Affirmation in Response to Motion to Vacate Judgment of Conviction: The People of the State of New York -against- Kharey Wise, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam, and Raymond Santana, Defendants |date=December 5, 2002 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Robert M. Morgenthau]], [[District Attorney]], [[New York County]] |accessdate=June 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In light of the "extraordinary circumstances" of the case, DA Morgenthau also recommended that the court also vacate the convictions for the other crimes that night to which the defendants had confessed. His rationale was that the defendants' confessions to the other crimes were made at the same time and in the same statements as those related to the attack on Meili. Had the newly discovered evidence been available at the original trials, it might have made the juries question whether any part of the defendants' confessions were trustworthy.&lt;ref name="Morgenthau" /&gt;

Morgenthau's recommendation to vacate the convictions was strongly opposed by [[Linda Fairstein]], who had overseen the original prosecution but had since left the District Attorney's Office.&lt;ref name="Schanberg" /&gt; Despite the analysis conducted by the District Attorney's Office, New York City detectives maintained that the defendants had "most likely" been Reyes' accomplices in the assault and rape of Meili.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/28/nyregion/boys-guilt-likely-in-rape-of-jogger-police-panel-says.html?pagewanted=all |first=Robert D. |last=McFadden |authorlink=Robert D.

== Aftermath of vacated convictions ==

===Armstrong Report===

In 2002, [[New York City Police Commissioner]] [[Raymond Kelly]] commissioned a panel of three lawyers to review the case.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/28/nyregion/boys-guilt-likely-in-rape-of-jogger-police-panel-says.html|title=Boys' Guilt Likely in Rape of Jogger, Police Panel Says|last=McFadden|first=Robert D.|date=2003|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panel was made up of two prominent lawyers, [[Michael F. Armstrong]], the former chief counsel to the [[Knapp Commission]] that had investigated [[corruption within the New York City Police Department|New York City police corruption]] in the 1970s, and Jules Martin, a [[New York University]] Vice President, as well as Stephen Hammerman, deputy police commissioner for legal affairs.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/LAW/01/27/nyjogger.report/index.html?iref=mpstoryview|first=Phil |last=Hirschkorn|title=Police panel slams decision to absolve men in Central Park jogger case|date=January 28, 2003|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GR5zAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60|title=Encyclopedia of Street Crime in America|first=Jeffrey Ian |last=Ross|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/02/nyregion/2-prominent-lawyers-to-review-police-inquiry-into-central-park-jogger-case.html The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; The panel issued a 43-page report in January 2003.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The panel disputed Reyes's claim that he alone had raped the jogger.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt; It insisted there was "nothing but his uncorroborated word" that he acted alone.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Armstrong said the panel believed "the word of a serial rapist killer is not something to be heavily relied upon."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The report concluded that the five men whose convictions had been vacated had "most likely" participated in the beating and rape of the jogger and that the "most likely scenario" was that "both the defendants and Reyes assaulted her, perhaps successively."&lt;ref name="thedailybeast.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;  The report said Reyes had most likely "either joined in the attack as it was ending or waited until the defendants had moved on to their next victims before descending upon her himself, raping her and inflicting upon her the brutal injuries that almost caused her death."&lt;ref name="thedailybeast.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

As to the five defendants, the report said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We believe the inconsistencies contained in the various statements were not such as to destroy their reliability. On the other hand, there was a general consistency that ran through the defendants' descriptions of the attack on the female jogger: she was knocked down on the road, dragged into the woods, hit and molested by several defendants, sexually abused by some while others held her arms and legs, and left semiconscious in a state of undress.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"It seems impossible to say that they weren't there at all, because they knew too much," Armstrong said in an interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-12-06/news/sns-rt-us-usa-crime-centralparkbre8b51j8-20121206_1_central-park-jogger-case-korey-wise-raymond-santana|title=Two decades later, Central Park Jogger rape case lives on|work=Chicago Tribune|date= December 6, 2012|first=Joseph |last=Ax }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawyers for the five defendants said that Trump's advertisement had inflamed public opinion. After Reyes confessed to the crime and said he acted alone, one of the defendants' lawyers, Michael W. Warren, said, "I think Donald Trump at the very least owes a real apology to this community and to the young men and their families."&lt;ref name="NYT Oct 2002"/&gt; Protests were held outside [[Trump Tower]] in October 2002 with protestors chanting, "Trump is a chump!"&lt;ref name="NYT Oct 2002"/&gt; Trump was unapologetic at the time, saying, "I don't mind if they picket. I like pickets."&lt;ref name="NYT Oct 2002"/&gt;

After the city announced in June 2014 that they would settle with the defendants for more than $40 million, Trump wrote an [[op-ed|opinion article]] for the ''[[New York Daily News]]''. He called the settlement "a disgrace" and said that the group's guilt was still likely: "Settling doesn't mean innocence. ... Speak to the detectives on the case and try listening to the facts. These young men do not exactly have the pasts of angels."&lt;ref name="NYDN Jun 2014"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/donald-trump-central-park-settlement-disgrace-article-1.1838467 | title = Donald Trump: Central Park Five settlement is a 'disgrace' | work = New York Daily News | location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Yusef Salaam, Trump "was the fire starter", as "common citizens were being manipulated and swayed into believing that we were guilty." Salaam and his family received death threats after papers ran Trump's full-page ad. Warren argued that Trump's advertisements played a role in securing conviction, saying that "he poisoned the minds of many people who lived in New York City and who, rightfully, had a natural affinity for the victim," and that "notwithstanding the jurors' assertions that they could be fair and impartial, some of them or their families, who naturally have influence, had to be affected by the inflammatory rhetoric in the ads." ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote in 2016 that the case and the media attention reflected the racial dynamics at the time; a similar attack took place soon after in [[Brooklyn]] on May 2, 1989,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/02/nyregion/2-men-get-6-to-18-years-for-rape-in-brooklyn.html&lt;/ref&gt; involving a black woman who was raped and thrown from the roof of a four-story building, but received little media attention.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Her case was brought to Trump's attention.

In October 2016, when [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump campaigned to be president]], he declared that the Central Park Five were guilty and stated that their convictions should never have been vacated. Trump told CNN: "They admitted they were guilty. The police doing the original investigation say they were guilty. The fact that that case was settled with so much evidence against them is outrageous. And the woman, so badly injured, will never be the same."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/06/politics/reality-check-donald-trump-central-park-5/ |first=Steven A. |last=Holmes |date=October 7, 2016 |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |work=CNN |title=Reality Check: Donald Trump and the Central Park 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ann Coulter presented an argument describing the actions of the attack, Trump's ad, and the nuances of the case within the prism of DNA knowledge of the 1980s.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2018-07-25.html |first=Ann |last=Coulter |date=July 25, 2018 |accessdate=July 28, 2018 |work=Ann Coulter |title=Central Park Rapists: Trump Was Right}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump's statement attracted criticism from the Central Park Five themselves&lt;ref&gt;Patters, Brandon Ellington, [https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/central-park-five-blast-donald-trump-exclusive Exclusive: Central Park Five Members Blast Trump for Insisting They're Guilty], ''Mother Jones'' (October 7, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as others, including Republican U.S. Senator [[John McCain]], who called Trump's responses "outrageous statements about the innocent men in the Central Park Five case" and cited it as one of many causes prompting him to retract his endorsement of Trump.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, Matt, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-mccain-unendorses-trump_us_57f95fc1e4b0e655eab4f273 John McCain Unendorses Donald Trump], ''Huffington Post'' (October 8, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Salaam said that he had falsely confessed out of coercion, after having been mistreated by police while in custody, deprived of food, drink or sleep for over 24 hours.&lt;ref name=salaam-speaks-out&gt;{{cite web | last = Salaam | first = Yusuf | date = October 12, 2016 | title = I'm one of the Central Park Five.

'''Chako Paul City''' (or '''Shakebao''') is a fictional town of 25,000 all-female residents located in northern [[Sweden]], reports of which surfaced in [[China|Chinese]] press agencies [[Xinhua]] and [[Harbin News]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/22476/20091005/ Landes, David.

The '''Daily Telegraph Affair''' was the uproar that followed the 28 October 1908 publication in British newspaper ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' of comments by [[German Emperor|German Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] intended to improve [[Germany–United Kingdom relations|German-British relations]]. It was a major diplomatic blunder that worsened relations and badly hurt the Kaiser's reputation; after that he played a much smaller role in deciding foreign policy. The episode had a far greater impact in Germany than overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher M. Clark, ''Kaiser Wilhelm II'' (2000) pp. 172-80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John C. G. Röhl|title=Wilhelm II: Into the Abyss of War and Exile, 1900–1941|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FN9GAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA662|year=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=662–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamar Cecil, ''Wilhelm II: Emperor and Exile, 1900–1941'' (1996) vol. 2, pp. 123-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Telegraph'' presented what appeared to be an interview with the Kaiser. It was in fact the reworked notes by [[British Army]] officer [[Edward Montagu-Stuart-Wortley]] of conversations he had with Wilhelm II in 1907.&lt;ref name="MacMillan 2013, Ch 5"&gt;{{cite book |last=MacMillan|first=Margaret |author-link=Margaret MacMillan |title=The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914 |chapter=Ch 5. Dreadnought: The Anglo-German Naval Rivalry |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=2013 |isbn=978-0812994704 | edition=Kindle| ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Telegraph'' sent the "interview" to Wilhelm II for approval, who in turn passed it to [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Bernhard von Bülow]], who later stated that he was too busy to edit the document, though Bülow's critics charged that he did not wish to challenge the Kaiser. Instead Bülow passed it on to the [[Federal Foreign Office|Foreign Ministry]] for their review, which apparently did not happen.&lt;ref name="MacMillan 2013, Ch 5"/&gt; It included wild statements and diplomatically damaging remarks, the most infamous of which was 

&lt;blockquote&gt;You English are [[Mad as a March hare|mad, mad, mad as March hares]]. What has come over you that you are so completely given over to suspicions quite unworthy of a great nation?&lt;ref&gt;The World War One Document Archive. The Daily Telegraph Affair , https://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/The_Daily_Telegraph_Affair, quoted in Ham, p.148-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wilhelm had seen the interview as an opportunity to promote his views and ideas on Anglo-German friendship, but due to his emotional outbursts during the course of the interview, he ended up further alienating not only the British, but also the French, Russians, and Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Otte, "‘An altogether unfortunate affair’: Great Britain and the daily telegraph affair." ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'' 5#2 (1994): 296-333.&lt;/ref&gt;  He implied, among other things, that the Germans cared nothing for the British; that the French and Russians had attempted to incite Germany to intervene in the [[Second Boer War]]; and that the German naval buildup was targeted against the Japanese, not Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/The_Daily_Telegraph_Affair partial text of "The interview of the Emperor Wilhelm II on October 28, 1908"]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The British leadership had already decided that Wilhelm was somewhat mentally disturbed, and saw this as further evidence of his unstable personality, as opposed to an indication of official German hostility.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Otte, "'The Winston of Germany': The British Foreign Policy Élite and the Last German Emperor." ''Canadian Journal of History ''36.3 (2001): 471-504.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Daily Telegraph'' crisis deeply wounded Wilhelm's previously unimpaired self-confidence, and he soon suffered a severe bout of depression from which he never fully recovered. He lost much of the influence he had previously exercised in domestic and foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil, ''Wilhelm II: Emperor and Exile, 1900–1941'' (1996) vol. 2, pp. 138–41&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect in Germany was quite significant; severe embarrassment was followed by serious calls for the Kaiser's abdication. The conservative Junker politician [[Elard von Oldenburg-Januschau]] was the only member of the Reichstag to defend the Kaiser throughout the Affair. Wilhelm kept a very low profile for many months after the ''Daily Telegraph'' fiasco, slumping into a deep depression, never fully recovering from the humiliation. He later exacted his revenge by forcing the resignation of the Chancellor Bülow{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, who had abandoned the Emperor to public scorn by not having the transcript edited before its German publication.&lt;ref&gt;Lamar Cecil, ''Wilhelm II: Emperor and Exile, 1900–1941'' (1996) vol. 2, pp. 135–7, 143–45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald E. Shepardson, "The 'Daily Telegraph' Affair," ''Midwest Quarterly'' (1980) 21#2 pp 207–220&lt;/ref&gt; Bülow recalled in his Memoirs that: 
:A dark foreboding ran through many Germans that such... stupid, even puerile speech and action on the part of the Supreme Head of State could lead to only one thing - catastrophe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernhard Bülow (Fürst von)|title=Memoirs of Prince Von Bülow vol 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uFYmAQAAMAAJ|year=1972|publisher=AMS Press|page=396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''David Bek''''' ({{lang-hy|Դավիթ Բեկ}}; {{lang-ru|Давид Бек}}) is an opera composed by [[Armen Tigranian]] based on the [[Raffi (novelist)|Raffi]] novel ''David Bek'' (1880–82). After the composer's death, the opera was completed by Levon Khoja-Eynatov, G. Budaghyan, and the [[libretto]] was developed by A. Ter-Hovhannisyan.&lt;ref&gt;Энциклопедический музыкальный словарь, Москва 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera describes events surrounding the historical figure of [[David Bek]] in the early 18th century and the struggle of the [[Armenian people]] against [[Persia]]. 

''David Bek'' was first performed in [[Yerevan]] in 1950.

{{Politics of Algeria}}
Algeria elects on national level a [[head of state]] - the [[President of Algeria|president]] - and a [[legislature]]. The president is elected for a five-year term by the people. [[People's National Assembly]] (''al-Majlis al-Sha'abi al-Watani/Assemblé Populaire Nationale'') has 462 members, elected for a five-year term in multi-seat constituencies by [[proportional representation]]. Eight seats in the national assembly are reserved for Algerians abroad. The [[Council of the Nation]] (''Majlis al-Umma/Conseil de la Nation'') has 144 members, 96 members elected by communal councils and 48 members appointed by the president. 
Algeria has a [[multi-party]] system, with numerous [[political parties|parties]] in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and [[political parties|parties]] must work with each other to form [[coalition government]]s.   According to a [[United States diplomatic cables leak|US Embassy cable]], the 2009 presidential elections were "carefully choreographed and heavily controlled", with the official turnout figure "exaggerated" by at least 45%.&lt;ref name="09ALGIERS370"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pearce |first=David D. |authorlink=David D. Pearce |coauthors= |title=Bouteflika reelected in heavily managed contest |id={{WikiLeaks cable|09ALGIERS370}} |work= |publisher=[[WikiLeaks]] |date=2009-04-13 |url=http://wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/04/09ALGIERS370.html |doi= |accessdate=2012-01-11 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64bGMZqc9?url=http://wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/04/09ALGIERS370.html |archivedate=2012-01-11 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 12 November 2008, presidents were limited to two terms; on this date, amendments to the constitution were passed which removed the term limits. Term limits were later reinstated in the 2016 constitution reform by President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]].

The last legislative election was held in May 2017.

These elections were marked by a turnout of 35%, the lowest of any Algerian election to date (&lt;ref&gt;http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/EAD77C49-59FD-420E-B17E-39554B3DB923.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=308765&amp;area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__africa/ {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930202353/http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=308765&amp;area=%2Fbreaking_news%2Fbreaking_news__africa%2F |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The former ruling party, the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN), obtained the largest number of seats, with 136. It was followed by its two governing partners, the [[National Rally for Democracy (Algeria)|National Rally for Democracy]] (RND), with 61, and the Islamist [[Movement of Society for Peace]] (MSP), with 52 seats. The latter parties gained seats at the expense of the FLN, which lost 38 seats in comparison with its result in 2002.

The radical leftist [[Workers' Party (Algeria)|Workers' Party]] (PT) led by Louiza Hannoune obtained 26 seats, becoming the largest force in parliament after the governing coalition; the secularist Berber [[Rally for Culture and Democracy]] (RCD) obtained 19 seats, reentering parliament after a boycott in 2002 had left the party without representation there. The other Islamist party, [[Movement for National Reform|Islah]] (split, with one wing calling for a boycott of the election), lost heavily, maintaining only 3 seats, versus 43 in the previous parliament. Independents, with 33 seats (3 more than in the previous parliament), and a number of smaller parties shared the rest of the seats.

Several groups, notably the leftist [[Front of Socialist Forces]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ffs-dz.com/article.php?id_article=419&lt;/ref&gt; leading members of the former [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (notably [[Abbassi Madani]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/features/2007/05/16/feature-01&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ali Belhadj]]), and the newly formed organisation [[Rachad]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.rachad.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=69&amp;Itemid=37 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070521052819/http://en.rachad.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=69&amp;Itemid=37 |archivedate=2007-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; called on their supporters to boycott these elections. The [[Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb]] also issued a video calling participation in the elections "a great sin".

[[File:Enduro 4 cylinder ISS at Columbus 151 Speedway.jpg|thumb|right|4 cylinder cars racing in the Impact Survival Series]]
An '''enduro race''' is an inexpensive type of automobile [[racing]] that takes place mostly on oval tracks.&lt;ref name="Barracuda Magazine" /&gt; Enduro takes its name from "Endurance racing" since it consists of hundreds of laps around the oval.

==Vehicle==
It involves [[Stock car racing|stock based cars]] that had their interior and side or rear windows removed but mostly stock mechanically.&lt;ref name="Barracuda Magazine" /&gt; A driver is disqualified if post-race inspection finds that their auto had major racing enhancements.&lt;ref name="Barracuda Magazine" /&gt; Some enduros, often called '[[jalopy]] enduros', feature cars rescued from a wrecking yard and repaired to barely running condition solely for the purpose of the race.&lt;ref name="Barracuda Magazine" /&gt;  In this case, the prize may be awarded to the last man standing, if all the other competitors break down during the event.

Enduro racing is sometimes divided into two classes: big-car and small-car. Big-car races feature full-size (usually American) cars with larger 6- and 8-cylinder engines, while small-car races feature mid-size to sub-compact (often Japanese) 4-cylinder makes and models.

==Format==
The races are usually long ones with many often 100 competitors who start three wide.&lt;ref name="Burlington Free Press" /&gt; The cars often take up most of the oval and they start from a standing start.&lt;ref name="Burlington Free Press" /&gt; It is common for races to be hundreds of laps or over 50 miles (90&amp;nbsp;km) long.&lt;ref name="Barracuda Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|title=How to beat the High Cost of Stock Car Racing|url=http://www.barracudamagazine.com/howtobeat.html|publisher=Barracuda Magazine|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most enduro races occur at the amateur level and often feature up to $1,000 (U.S.) prize money,&lt;ref name="Barracuda Magazine" /&gt; with some of the bigger races having prizes of $10,000. (U.S.) Events rarely are canceled even in bad weather (rain or snow).&lt;ref name="New England Racing News"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jay|title="Halloween at 100 MPH" for Devil’s Bowl Speedway’s Vermonster 150 Enduro|url=http://newenglandracingnews.com/blog/2012/10/halloween-at-100-mph-for-devils-bowl-speedways-vermonster-150-enduro/#more-10932|publisher=New England Racing News|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The race is not stopped except for an emergency or if the track is completely blocked.&lt;ref name="Burlington Free Press"&gt;{{cite news|last=St. Louis |first=Justin |title=Vt Speed: Need an alternative? Try an Enduro |url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20120803/SPORTS13/308030006/Vt-Speed-Need-an-alternative-Try-an-Enduro-at-Thunder-Road-in-Vermont |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130118164727/http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20120803/SPORTS13/308030006/Vt-Speed-Need-an-alternative-Try-an-Enduro-at-Thunder-Road-in-Vermont |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 18, 2013 |accessdate=October 28, 2012 |newspaper=[[Burlington Free Press]] |date=August 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When an auto breaks down, the race is temporarily halted to remove the driver.&lt;ref name="Barracuda Magazine" /&gt; The auto is left in its position on the racing surface and it becomes an obstacle that the other drivers must drive around.&lt;ref name="Barracuda Magazine" /&gt;  Often the fastest car is not the winner, rather longevity is the key to winning.&lt;ref name="Barracuda Magazine" /&gt;

U.S. Senator [[Chris Murphy (Connecticut politician)|Chris Murphy]] accused the [[United States]] of complicity in Yemen's humanitarian crisis, saying: "Thousands and thousands inside Yemen today are dying. ...

On 11 December 2017, Jamie McGoldrick, the UN's humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, affirmed that 8 million in the country are in danger of famine unless access to immediate humanitarian is allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Al Jazeera News. (11 December 2017). "More than 8 million 'a step away' from famine in Yemen". [http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/8-million-step-famine-yemen-171211185321446.html Al Jazeera website] Retrieved 11 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. (11 December 2017).

On 13 December 2017, [[USAID]] administrator, [[Mark Andrew Green]], stated that there are no signs that blockade had been in any way eased and Yemeni ports are still fully blocked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-usa-aid/u-s-aid-chief-says-no-sign-yemen-port-blockade-easing-to-allow-aid-in-idUSKBN1E6327|title=U.S. aid chief says no sign Yemen port blockade easing to allow aid in|date=12 December 2017|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldnews.easybranches.com/regions/asia/us-aid-chief-says-no-sign-yemen-port-blockade-easing-to-allow-aid-in-524346|title=US aid chief says no sign Yemen port blockade easing to allow aid in|website=www.worldnews.easybranches.com|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 5 November 2017, the Saudi-led coalition began blocking all [[fuel]] shipments to Yemen, causing farmers to abandon modern equipment like tractors and forcing hospitals to function without generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-blockade-exclusive/exclusive-saudi-led-blockade-cuts-fuel-lifeline-to-yemen-idUSKBN1E02FP|title=Exclusive: Saudi-led blockade cuts fuel lifeline to Yemen|date=6 December 2017|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/yemen-hospitals-and-water-pumps-3699406-Nov2017/|title=17 million in Yemen need food - now hospitals and water pumps will run out of fuel in three weeks|first=|last=AFP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Economist]]'', another major cause of the famine is the popularity of the cultivation and consumption of [[khat]], which requires a significant amount of water to grow in addition to being the most popular drug in Yemen.&lt;ref name="ec"/&gt; Khat cultivation is monopolised by the Houthi rebels.&lt;ref name="ec"/&gt;
More than 50,000 children in Yemen died from [[starvation]] during 2017.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

In July 2018, a 25% increase of severe hunger cases in Yemen compared to 2017 has been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-hunger-famine/yemen-close-to-famine-after-port-offensive-aid-groups-warn-idUSKBN1KE04B|title=Yemen close to famine after port offensive, aid groups warn|first=Heba|last=Kanso|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September 2018 column in ''The New York Times'', [[Nicholas Kristof]] stated that the United States is supporting [[crimes against humanity]] in Yemen, adding that "America is helping to kill, maim and starve Yemeni children. At least eight million Yemenis are at risk of starvation from an approaching famine caused not by crop failures but by our actions and those of our allies. The United Nations has called it the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, and we own it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Kristof|first=Nicholas|date=September 26, 2018|title=Be Outraged by America’s Role in Yemen’s Misery|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/opinion/yemen-united-states-united-nations.html|work=[[The New York Times]] |location= |access-date=October 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 October 2018, the United States and [[United Kingdom|the United Kingdom,]] Saudi Arabia's biggest arm suppliers, called for a ceasefire in the conflict in Yemen. A press release from the [[United States Secretary of State]], [[Mike Pompeo|Michael Pompeo]], stated "A cessation of hostilities and vigorous resumption of a political track will help ease the humanitarian crisis as well. It is time to end this conflict, replace conflict with compromise, and allow the Yemeni people to heal through peace and reconstruction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2018/10/287018.htm|title=Ending the Conflict in Yemen|work=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 10, 2018, the U.S. announced it would no longer refuel coalition aircraft operating over Yemen.&lt;ref name=cnn-20181110&gt;{{cite news |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/09/politics/us-yemen-houthis-missile/index.html |title=US to stop air refueling of Saudi-led coalition in Yemen |author=Ryan Browne, Barbara Starr |publisher=CNN |date=10 November 2018 |accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. continues its backing of the Saudi-led intervention with weapons sales and intelligence sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date=November 5, 2018 |title=U.N.: A Yemeni Child Dies Every 10 Min. from War-Caused Disease, Hunger|url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/11/5/headlines/un_a_yemeni_child_dies_every_10_min_from_war_caused_disease_hunger|work= [[DemocracyNow!]]|location= |access-date=November 7, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Van den Driessche won the [[European Cyclo-cross Championships]] in the women's under-23 category, and in 2016 she became Belgian champion in the same category, but both titles were stripped later.

She became the first cyclist to officially be charged with [[mechanical doping]], which arose from an incident that occurred at the [[2016 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships]]. On 26 April 2016, she was retroactively banned from the sport for six years from 11 October 2015 until 10 October 2021, and all her results since that time shall be disqualified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/van-den-driessche-handed-six-year-ban-for-mechanical-doping/ Van den Driessche handed six-year ban for mechanical doping]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
As a junior, she became national cyclo-cross champion in 2011 and junior national mountain bike champion in 2013. At the junior cyclocross championships she won the silver medal in 2013, winning in 2014 the silver medal at the junior national mountain bike championships. She was also active as a road cyclist and won the provincial time trial championships in the novices category in 2012 after finishing second in the same race the year before.

In the ''Middelkerke'' cyclocross race in February 2015 she finished third behind [[Sanne Cant]] and the British rider  [[Helen Wyman]].

Van den Driessche competed between May and July 2015 on the road in international races in Belgium and the Netherlands. She competed in the national road race championships, [[BeNe Ladies Tour]], [[Diamond Tour]] and [[Gooik-Geraardsbergen-Gooik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.procyclingstats.com/mob/rider.php?id=192077|title=Femke van den Driessche|website=www.procyclingstats.com|access-date=28 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2015-16 cyclosross season Van den Driessche was beaten at the ''Koppenberg'' race by [[Jolien Verschueren]] in November 2015. Later that month she won her biggest race in her career, the [[European Cyclo-cross Championships]] in the women's under-23 category. In January 2016 she became Belgian cyclocross champion in the same category.

===Allegations of mechanical doping===
Van den Driessche started as one of the favorites during the women's under-23 race at the [[2016 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships|2016 World Championships]], but failed to finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3425863/Secret-motor-frame-race-bike-Officials-discover-concealed-device-cyclo-cross-championship-event-competitor-withdrew-mechanical-problems.html |title=Secret electric MOTOR is discovered inside cyclist's bike at women's world championship race after competitor pulls out with 'mechanical problem' |quote=Femke Van den Driessche was at the world cyclo-cross championship.

During the race, the [[Union Cycliste Internationale|UCI]] checked the bicycles of Van den Driessche and found a motor in a bicycle that was in her pit. Almost six years since the first allegations of "[[mechanical doping]]" in cycling, this was the first time in cycling history that evidence of technological fraud had been found. The UCI had been testing a new detection system. The offence carries a minimum six-month suspension and a fine of between [[Swiss franc|SFr]]20,000 and 200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2016/01/news/uci_detains_bike_cyclocross_worlds_394233_394233%20%E2%80%98 |title=Technological fraud discovered at Zolder cyclocross worlds |first1=Dan |last1=Seaton |date=30 January 2016 |newspaper=[[VeloNews]] |accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/30/hidden-motor-bike-world-cyclo-cross-championships |title=Rider implicated after motor found on bike at world cyclo-cross championships |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van den Driessche denies she intended to cheat, and maintains that the bicycle was owned by a friend and was taken to the pit in error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/cycling/35452791 |title=UCI confirms motorised bike at Cyclo-cross World Championships |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=31 January 2016 |accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/femke-van-den-driessche-denies-using-motor-at-cyclo-cross-world-championships/ |title=Femke van Den Driessche Denies Using Motor at Cyclo-cross World Championships |date=31 January 2016  |work=[[Cycling News]] |accessdate=29 February  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some sources were openly incredulous. {{cite news |url=https://gizmodo.com/cycling-has-moved-from-actual-doping-to-mechanical-dopi-1756312660 |title=Cycling Has Moved From Actual Doping to 'Mechanical Doping' |work=[[Gizmodo]] |first1=Chris |last1=Mills |date=31 January 2016 |accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the days following the incident, the friend who was claimed by Van den Driessche, Nico Van Muylder, said to ''[[Het Nieuwsblad]]'' that the bike was his. However, UCI technical regulation 12.1.013, bars the presence of motors on the bike, regardless of intent or whether the bike was actually used, going to be used or even belonged to anyone on the team.  Riders are responsible under [[strict liability]].&lt;ref name="Redford"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first1=Kirsten |last1=Frattini|title = Van den Driessche’s friend claims ownership of motorised bike |date=2 February 2016 |url = http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/van-den-driessches-friend-claims-ownership-of-motorised-bike/ |publisher=Cyclingnews.com |newspaper=[[Cycling News]] |access-date = 4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frattini"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/uci-investigates-possible-bike-fraud-at-cyclo-cross-worlds/ |first1=Kirsten |last1=Frattini |date=30 January 2016 |title=Race: UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships {{mdash}} UCI investigates possible bike fraud at cyclo-cross Worlds: Bike detained after inaugural U23 women's race in Zolder |newspaper=Cycling News|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a clip that was later analyzed from the ''Koppenbergcross'' cyclo-cross race in November 2015 some moments look amiss. At one point she pulls away from the break on a cobble climb; apparently with little effort and still sitting on the saddle while others look laboured. At another point where she misses a couple of pedal strokes as she fiddles with her gears, it doesn't seem to take too much from her momentum despite being on an incline at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stickybottle.com/offroad/video-was-van-den-driessche-using-motor-in-this-race-clip-take-a-look/|title=Video: Was Van den Driessche using motor in this race clip? Take a look|access-date=28 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions to the mechanical doping allegations===

On 31 January 2016, Brian Cookson of the UCI held a press conference.  He said “It is no secret that a motor was found.” He used three different phrases to characterize use of the motor as "technological doping", "mechanical doping" and "technological fraud".  'Legal' proceedings would be commenced, which could result in sanctions of the rider, team or staff.  Possible penalties for the rider can be fines up to [[Swiss franc|SFr]]200,000, and a lifetime ban from the sport.  the team could be fined up to [[Swiss franc|SFr]]1 million.&lt;ref name="Andrew"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cxmagazine.com/motor-mechanical-doping-femke-van-den-driessche-suspected-2016-cyclocross-world-championships-update |title=UCI Confirms Mechanical Doping at 2016 Cyclocross World Championships |date=31 January 2016|author=Andrew |work=[[Cyclocross Magazine]] |accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The matter will be heard by an independent Disciplinary Commission that is charged to hear evidence from "all relevant parties" and render its decision on whether a rule violation is proved and the amount of sanctions, if any, for breaches of the UCI Regulations.&lt;ref name="MacKay"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/cycling/uci-refer-femke-van-den-7346880 |title=Mechanical doping in cycling |newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] |date=10 February  2016 |first1=Hamish |last1=MacKay |accessdate=29 February  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of her culpability {{mdash}} given her age, experience, and the responsibility of her team {{mdash}} is an issue.  Size of any sanction is controversial, as some riders are deeply affronted by the alleged infraction.&lt;ref name="Slater"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/cycling/35560841 |title=Evie Richards: Van den Driessche merits long ban for mechanical doping |date=12 February 2016 |first1=Matt |last1=Slater |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |quote=New British cycling star [[Evie Richards]] believes Belgian rival Femke Van den Driessche should be banned for at least two years for mechanical doping. "Six months is pretty short as it's only a season off the bike - I think a couple of years.  But because she is such a young age I think there should be more penalties for the coaches and support team around her.  Belgium is so into cyclo-cross that it's quite upsetting there wasn't the right support around her. So I think the penalties should not just be on her." |accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Claims have been made that she would receive the minimum sanction, as the weight of full sanctions might be unjust.  That matter was referred to [[Philippe Muyters]], the Flemish Minister for Sport.&lt;ref name="Curtin"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cxmagazine.com/rumors-and-rumblings-mechanical-doping-femke-van-den-driessche |title=Rumors &amp; Rumblings: Femke Van den Dreissch May Only Get 6 Month Suspension and Fine |first1=Daniel, Jr. |last1=Curtin |work=Cyclocross Magazine |date=10 February 2016 |quote=Flemish MP Lionel Bajart has indicated in a press release that whether mechanical or biological, the idea behind the sanction is the same, to discourage cheating and punish those who are caught. However, he also cautioned that without explicit mention in the country’s anti-doping charter, there are questions as to whether full sanctions are just. |accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Etixx]] team manager Patrick Lefevere thought a "lifetime suspension for the cheat" was appropriate.&lt;ref name="McMahon2"/&gt;

"I never thought that such schemes were possible. It's a scandal that Femke's entourage have deceived the Belgian federation," he said.
Her sponsors expressed outrage at her breach of trust, and said that they would start their own legal actions.&lt;ref name="McMahon2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/bike-investigated-technological-fraud-cycling-world-championships-cyclocross-2016-1 |title=A 19-year-old Belgian cyclist got caught cheating at the world championships after racing a bike that had a motor hidden in the frame

We work every day to bring worldwide the quality of our products and when we know that a Wilier Triestina’s bike is meanly tampered we’re very sad. Our Company will take legal action against the athlete and against any responsible for this very serious matter, in order to safeguard the good name and image of the company, marked by professionalism and seriousness in 110 years of history. |accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "We thought that we had in Femke a great talent in the making but it seems that she fooled everyone." One cyclocross veteran, [[Sven Nys]] expressed shock and disappointment. Managing director Andrea Gastaldello, said he was "stunned" by the news that Van den Driessche competed with a concealed motor in her [[Wilier Triestina]] bike, "Our company will take legal action against the athlete and against any (person) responsible for this very serious matter to safeguard the reputation and image of the company," he said.&lt;ref name="McMahon2"/&gt;

===Aftermath and end of career===
On 14 March 2016, Van den Driessche announced she would not be defending herself in front of the disciplinary committee on March 15.  She cited the heavy suspension demanded by the prosecution and the prohibitive cost of such a procedure in Switzerland.  She said she was being denied the chance of getting a fair trial, as she had already been tried and convicted in the court of public opinion. Van den Driessche also announced her immediate retirement from cycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20160314_02181600 |title=Femke Van den Driessche: 'Mijn proces was overal al gevoerd' |newspaper=[[De Standaard]] |accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 April 2016, it was announced by the UCI that Driessche had been banned for six years and would forfeit all results since 10 October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.uci.ch/pressreleases/the-uci-announces-disciplinary-commission-decision-the-case-femke-van-den-driessche/ |title=The UCI announces Disciplinary Commission decision in the case of Femke Van den Driessche |work=[[Union Cycliste Internationale]] |publisher=[[Union Cycliste Internationale]] |date=26 April 2016 |accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ghost Dance at Pine Ridge.png|300px|thumb|The Ghost Dance of 1889–1891 by the [[Oglala Lakota]] at Pine Ridge. Illustration by western artist [[Frederic Remington]], 1890.]]

The '''Ghost Dance''' ([[Caddo language|Caddo]]: '''Nanissáanah''',&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Randlett. ''Nusht'uhti?ti? Hasinay: Caddo Phrasebook.'' Richardson, TX: Various Indian Peoples Publishing, 2003: 19. {{ISBN|1-884655-00-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; also called the '''Ghost Dance of 1890''') was a [[new religious movement]] incorporated into numerous [[Native American religion|Native American belief systems]]. According to the teachings of the [[Northern Paiute]] spiritual leader [[Wovoka]] (renamed Jack Wilson), proper practice of the dance would reunite the living with spirits of the dead, bring the spirits to fight on their behalf, make the white colonists leave, and bring peace, prosperity, and unity to Native American peoples throughout the region.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; 

The basis for the Ghost Dance is the [[circle dance]], a traditional dance done by many Native Americans. The Ghost Dance was first practiced by the [[Nevada]] [[Northern Paiute]] in 1889. The practice swept throughout much of the [[Western United States]], quickly reaching areas of [[California]] and [[Oklahoma]]. As the Ghost Dance spread from its original source, different tribes synthesized selective aspects of the ritual with their own beliefs.

The Ghost Dance was associated with Wilson's (Wovoka's) prophecy of an end to white expansion while preaching goals of clean living, an honest life, and cross-cultural cooperation by Indians. Practice of the Ghost Dance movement was believed to have contributed to [[Lakota people|Lakota]] resistance to assimilation under the [[Dawes Act]]. In the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] in December 1890, [[United States Army]] forces killed at least 153 [[Miniconjou]] and [[Hunkpapa]] from the Lakota people.&lt;ref&gt;Utley, Robert, ''The Last Days of the Sioux Nation'', Yale University Press, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; The Lakota variation on the Ghost Dance tended towards [[millenarianism]], an innovation that distinguished the Lakota interpretation from Jack Wilson's original teachings. The [[Caddo]] still practice the Ghost Dance today.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, Phil.

== History ==

=== Paiute influence ===
[[File:Chufa.jpg|thumb|''[[Cyperus esculentus]]'']]
The Northern Paiutes living in [[Mason Valley (Nevada)|Mason Valley]], in what is now the [[U.S. state]] of [[Nevada]], were known collectively as the Tövusi-dökadö (''Tövusi-'': "''[[Cyperus]]'' bulb" and ''dökadö'': "eaters") at the time of [[European colonization of the Americas|European contact]]. The Northern Paiute community at this time was thriving upon a subsistence pattern of fishing, hunting wild game, and foraging for [[pine nut]]s and roots such as ''[[Cyperus esculentus]]''.

The Tövusi-dökadö during this period lacked any permanent [[political organisation]] or officials, and tended to follow various spiritual leaders and community organizers. Community events centered on the observance of seasonal ceremonies such as harvests or hunting. In 1869, [[Wodziwob|Hawthorne Wodziwob]], a Paiute man, organized a series of community dances to announce a vision. He spoke of a journey to the land of the dead and of promises made to him by the souls of the recently deceased. They promised to return to their loved ones within a period of three to four years.&lt;ref name="Kehoe, B Alice pp. 32"&gt;[[Alice Beck Kehoe|Kehoe, Alice Beck]] (1989). ''The Ghost Dance: Ethnohistory and Revitalization''. Washington, DC: Thompson Publishing. pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wodziwob's peers accepted this vision, likely due to his reputable status as a [[traditional medicine|healer]]. He urged the populace to dance the common circle dance as was customary during a time of celebration. He continued preaching this message for three years with the help of a local "weather doctor" named Tavibo, father of Jack Wilson.&lt;ref name="Kehoe, B Alice pp. 32" /&gt;

Prior to Wodziwob's religious movement, a devastating [[typhoid fever]] epidemic struck in 1867. This and other European diseases killed approximately one-tenth of the total population,&lt;ref&gt;Kehoe, ''The Ghost Dance'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in widespread psychological and emotional trauma. The disruption brought disorder to the [[economic system]] and society. Many families were prevented from continuing their [[nomad]]ic lifestyle.

=== Round Dance influence ===
A [[Circle dance|round dance]] is a circular community dance held, usually around an individual who leads the ceremony. Round dances may be ceremonial or purely social. Usually the dancers are accompanied by a group of singers who may also play hand [[drum kit|drums]] in unison. The dancers join hands to form a large circle. The dancers move to their left with a side-shuffle step to reflect the long-short pattern of the [[drum beat]], bending their knees to emphasize the pattern.

During his studies of the [[Pacific Northwest]] tribes the [[anthropologist]] [[Leslie Spier]] used the term "[[Prophetic dance|prophet dances]]" to describe ceremonial round dances where the participants seek [[trance]], exhortations and [[prophecy]]. Spier studied peoples of the [[Columbia Plateau|Columbia plateau]] (a region including [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], [[Idaho]], and parts of western [[Montana]]). By the time of his studies the only dances he was allowed to witness were social dances or ones that had already incorporated [[Christian]] elements, making investigation of the round dance's origin complicated.

== The Prophet ==
[[File:Wovoka Paiute Shaman.jpg|thumb|Wovoka—[[Northern Paiute]] spiritual leader and creator of the Ghost Dance]]

Jack Wilson, the prophet otherwise known as ''[[Wovoka]]'', was believed to have had a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] during a [[solar eclipse]] on January 1, 1889. It was reportedly not his first time experiencing a vision; but as a young adult, he claimed that he was then better equipped, spiritually, to handle this message. Jack had received training from an experienced holy man under his parents' guidance after they realized that he was having difficulty interpreting his previous visions. Jack was also training to be a "weather doctor", following in his father's footsteps. He was known throughout [[Mason Valley (Nevada)|Mason Valley]] as a gifted and blessed young leader. Preaching a message of universal love, he often presided over circle dances, which symbolized the sun's heavenly path across the sky.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

[[Anthropologist]] [[James Mooney]] conducted an interview with Wilson prior to 1892. Mooney confirmed that his message matched that given to his fellow Indians.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;*Mooney, James. ''The Ghost Dance Religion and Wounded Knee''. New York: Dover Publications; 1896&lt;/ref&gt; This study compared letters between tribes. According to Mooney, Wilson's letter said he stood before God in heaven and had seen many of his ancestors engaged in their favorite pastimes, and that God showed Wilson a beautiful land filled with wild game and instructed him to return home to tell his people that they must love each other and not fight. He also stated that [[Jesus]] was being reincarnated on earth in 1892, that the people must work, not steal or lie, and that they must not engage in the old practices of war or the traditional self-mutilation practices connected with mourning the dead. He said that if his people abided by these rules, they would be united with their friends and family in the other world, and in God's presence, there would be no sickness, disease, or old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghostdance.us/history/history-messiahletter.html|title=Ghost Dance – The Messiah Letter from Wovoka|website=www.ghostdance.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mooney writes that Wilson was given the Ghost Dance and commanded to take it back to his people. He preached that if the five-day dance was performed in the proper intervals, the performers would secure their happiness and hasten the reunion of the living and deceased. Wilson said that the Creator gave him powers over the weather and that he would be the deputy in charge of affairs in the western United States, leaving current [[Benjamin Harrison|President Harrison]] as God's deputy in the East. Jack claims that he was then told to return home and preach God's message.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Jack Wilson claimed to have left the presence of God convinced that if every Indian in the West danced the new dance to "hasten the event", all evil in the world would be swept away, leaving a renewed Earth filled with food, love, and faith. Quickly accepted by his Paiute brethren, the new religion was termed "Dance In A Circle". Because the first European contact with the practice came by way of the Lakota, their expression "Spirit Dance" was adopted as a descriptive title for all such practices. This was subsequently translated as "Ghost Dance".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

== Spread of the prophet's message ==
[[File:Sioux ghost dance, 1894.ogv|thumb|[[Great Sioux Nation]] tribe dancers, in dance regalia, 1894]]

Through Indians and some white settlers, Wilson's message spread across much of the western portion of the United States. Early in the religious movement, many tribes sent members to investigate the self-proclaimed prophet, while other communities sent delegates only to be cordial. Regardless of their initial motivations, many left as believers and returned to their homeland preaching his message. The Ghost Dance was also investigated by many [[Mormons]] from [[Utah]], for whom the concepts of the Indian prophet were familiar and often accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Kehoe, ''The Ghost Dance'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; While many followers of the Ghost Dance believed Wovoka to be a teacher of pacifism and peace, others did not.

An elaboration of the Ghost Dance concept was the development of [[ghost shirt]]s, which were special [[clothing]] that warriors could wear. They were rumored to repel bullets through spiritual power. It is uncertain where this belief originated. Scholars believe that in 1890 chief [[Kicking Bear]] introduced the concept to his people, the Lakota,&lt;ref&gt;Kehoe, ''The Ghost Dance'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; while James Mooney argued that the most likely source is the [[Mormons|Mormon]] [[temple garment]] (which Mormons believe protect the pious wearer from evil).&lt;ref&gt;Hittman, Michael, ''Wovoka and the Ghost Dance'', pp. 84-88, University of Nebraska Press, 1997 {{ISBN|0-8032-7308-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lakota interpretation drew from their traditional idea of a "renewed Earth" in which "all evil is washed away". This Lakota interpretation included the removal of all European Americans from their lands:&lt;ref&gt;John Fire/Lame Deer &amp; Richard Erdoes, ''Lame Deer, Seeker of Visions'', Chapter 14: Roll Up the World; Simon &amp; Schuster, NY, 1972 {{ASIN|B010EUWHDS}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|They told the people they could dance a new world into being. There would be landslides, earthquakes, and big winds. Hills would pile up on each other. The earth would roll up like a carpet with all the white man's ugly things – the stinking new animals, sheep and pigs, the fences, the telegraph poles, the mines and factories. Underneath would be the wonderful old-new world as it had been before the white fat-takers came. ...The white men will be rolled up, disappear, go back to their own continent. (p.228)|[[Lame Deer]]}}

== Political influence ==

In February 1890, the United States government broke a Lakota treaty by adjusting the [[Great Sioux Reservation]] of [[South Dakota]] (an area that formerly encompassed the majority of the state) and breaking it up into five smaller reservations.&lt;ref&gt;Kehoe, ''The Ghost Dance'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The government was accommodating white homesteaders from the eastern United States; in addition, it intended to "break up tribal relationships" and "conform Indians to the white man's ways, peaceably if they will, or forcibly if they must".&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Anthony F. C. "Revitalization Movements: Some Theoretical Considerations for Their Comparative Study", ''American Anthropologist'' n.s. 58(2):264-81. 1956&lt;/ref&gt; On the reduced reservations, the government allocated family units on {{convert|320|acre|km2|sing=on}} plots for individual households. The Lakota were expected to farm and raise livestock, and to send their children to [[Native American boarding school|boarding schools]]. With the goal of assimilation, the schools taught English and Christianity, as well as American cultural practices. Generally, they forbade inclusion of Indian traditional culture and language.

To help support the Lakota during the period of transition, the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) was to supplement the Lakota with food and to hire white farmers as teachers for the people. The farming plan failed to take into account the difficulty that Lakota farmers would have in trying to cultivate crops in the semi-arid region of South Dakota. By the end of the 1890 growing season, a time of intense heat and low rainfall, it was clear that the land was unable to produce substantial agricultural yields. Unfortunately, this was also the time when the government's patience with supporting the so-called "lazy Indians" ran out. They cut rations for the Lakota in half. With the [[bison]] having been virtually eradicated a few years earlier, the Lakota were at risk of starvation.

The people turned to the Ghost Dance ritual, which frightened the supervising agents of the BIA. Those who had been residing in the area for a long time recognized that the ritual was often held shortly before battle was to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Recent Indian Wars|last=Boyd|first=James|publisher=[Philadelphia] Publishers Union|year=1891|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kicking Bear was forced to leave Standing Rock, but when the dances continued unabated, [[James McLaughlin (Indian agent)|Agent James McLaughlin]] asked for more troops. He claimed the [[Hunkpapa]] spiritual leader [[Sitting Bull]] was the real leader of the movement. A former agent, [[Valentine McGillycuddy]], saw nothing extraordinary in the dances and ridiculed the panic that seemed to have overcome the agencies, saying: "The coming of the troops has frightened the Indians. If the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-Day Adventists]] prepare the ascension robes for the Second Coming of the Savior, the United States Army is not put in motion to prevent them. Why should not the Indians have the same privilege? If the troops remain, trouble is sure to come."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brands |first=H.W. |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pOBpgsNQMwQC&amp;pg=PA18 |title=The Reckless Decade: America in the 1890s |publisher=University of Chicago Press |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, thousands of additional U.S. Army troops were deployed to the reservation. On December 15, 1890, Sitting Bull was arrested for failing to stop his people from practicing the Ghost Dance.&lt;ref&gt;Kehoe, ''The Ghost Dance'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; During the incident, one of Sitting Bull's men, Catch the Bear, fired at Lieutenant "Bull Head", striking his right side. He instantly wheeled and shot Sitting Bull, hitting him in the left side, between the tenth and eleventh ribs;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/WWsittingB.htm |title=Sitting Bull: Biography |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date= |accessdate=May 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525001229/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/WWsittingB.htm |archivedate=May 25, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; this exchange resulted in deaths on both sides, including that of Sitting Bull.

== Wounded Knee ==

{{Main|Wounded Knee Massacre|Ghost Dance War}}
December 29, 1890 - [[Spotted Elk]] ([[Lakota language|Lakota]]: ''Unpan Glešká'' – also known as Big Foot) was a [[Miniconjou]] leader on the U.S. Army's list of 'trouble-making' Indians. He was stopped while ''en route'' to convene with the remaining Lakota chiefs. U.S. Army officers forced him to relocate with his people to a small camp close to the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation|Pine Ridge]] Agency. Here the soldiers could more closely watch the old chief. That evening, December 28, the small band of Lakota erected their tipis on the banks of [[Wounded Knee Creek]]. The following day, during an attempt by the officers to collect weapons from the band, one young, deaf Lakota warrior refused to relinquish his arms. A struggle followed in which somebody's weapon discharged into the air. One U.S. officer gave the command to open fire, and the Lakota responded by taking up previously confiscated weapons; the U.S. forces responded with [[carbine]] firearms and several rapid-fire light-artillery [[Hotchkiss gun|(Hotchkiss) guns]] mounted on the overlooking hill. When the fighting had concluded, 25 U.S. soldiers lay dead, many killed by friendly fire. Among the 153 dead Lakota, most were women and children.&lt;ref name="keh8"&gt;Kehoe, ''The Ghost Dance'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the massacre, chief [[Kicking Bear]] officially surrendered his weapon to General [[Nelson A. Miles]].

=== Aftermath ===

Outrage in the eastern United States emerged as the public learned about the deaths. The U.S. government had insisted on numerous occasions that the Indian had already been successfully pacified. Many Americans felt the U.S. Army actions were unduly harsh; some related the massacre at Wounded Knee Creek to the "ungentlemanly act of kicking a man when he is already down". Public uproar played a role in the reinstatement of the previous treaty's terms, including full rations and more monetary compensation for lands taken away.

Twenty U.S. soldiers received [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]] for their actions (some sources state the number as 18 or 23).&lt;ref name=NebHistMedals&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Medals of Wounded Knee|url=http://nebraskahistory.org/publish/publicat/history/full-text/NH1994MedalsWKnee.pdf|first=Jerry|last=Green|year=1994|work=Nebraska History|publisher=[[Nebraska State Historical Society]]|page=207|volume=75|accessdate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Wars Period|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/indianwars.html|work=Medal of Honor Recipients|publisher=[[U.S. Army Center of Military History]]|accessdate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Indian and human rights activists have referred to these as "Medals of Dis-Honor" and called for the awards to be rescinded, but none of them have ever been revoked.&lt;ref name=NebHistMedals /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Support the Action to Revoke the Congressional Medals of Honor to the Soldiers of the 7th Cavalry at Wounded Knee |url=http://www.ncai.org/ncai/data/resolution/2001annual/163.pdf |date=November 30, 2001 |publisher=National Congress of American Indians |accessdate=September 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328055336/http://www.ncai.org/ncai/data/resolution/2001annual/163.pdf |archivedate=March 28, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Action: Rescind Wounded Knee Medals of Dis Honor|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/02/09/942397/-Action:-Rescind-Wounded-Knee-Medals-of-Dis-Honor|date=February 9, 2011|last=Winter Rabbit|work=[[Daily Kos]]|accessdate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Massacre: Wounded Knee, South Dakota, USA, December 29, 1890|url=http://www.danielnpaul.com/WoundedKnee.html|work=We Were Not the Savages: First Nation History|editor-first=Daniel N.|editor-last=Paul|accessdate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Wounded Knee Massacre, interest and participation in the Ghost Dance movement dropped dramatically for fear of continued violence against practitioners. Like most Indian ceremonies, it became clandestine rather than dying out completely.

== Rejection ==
Despite the widespread acceptance of the Ghost Dance movement, [[Navajo]] leaders described the Ghost Dance as "worthless words" in 1890.&lt;ref name="keh8" /&gt; Three years later, [[James Mooney]] arrived at the Navajo reservation in northern [[Arizona]] during his study of the Ghost Dance movement and found the Navajo never incorporated the ritual into their society.

Kehoe believed the movement did not gain traction with the tribe due to the Navajo's higher levels of social and economic satisfaction at the time. Another factor was cultural norms among the Navajo, which inculcated a [[fear of ghosts]] and spirits, based on religious beliefs.

== The Ghost Dance today ==
The Wounded Knee massacre was not the end of the Ghost Dance religious movement. Instead, it went underground. Wovoka continued to spread its message, along with [[Kicking Bear]], [[Arnold Short Bull|Short Bull]] and other spiritual leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Renee Sansom Flood, ''Lost Bird of Wounded Knee'' (Scribner, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Wounded Knee incident]] of 1973, Lakota men and women, including [[Mary Brave Bird]], did the ghost dance ceremony on the site where their ancestors had been killed. In her book, Ms. Brave Bird writes  that ghost dances continue as private ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Crow Dog with Richard Erdoes, ''[[Lakota Woman]]'' (Grove Weidenfeld, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hedgpeth''' was an [[Alternative rock|alternative]]/[[Indie rock|indie]] [[music festival]] held in [[Twin Lakes, Wisconsin]], on July 28/29, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/hedgpeth-festival/Content?oid=922746|title=Hedgpeth Festival|work=Chicago Reader|date=July 27, 2006|accessdate=June 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Helena Modrzejewska National Stary Theater''' in [[Kraków]] (Polish: ''Narodowy Stary Teatr im. Heleny Modrzejewskiej'') is one of the oldest public stages in Poland and a national [[cultural institution|institution of culture]], first opened in 1781. It was named after renowned Shakespearean actress [[Helena Modjeska|Helena Modrzejewska]].

== History ==
The Theatre was created by [[Feliks Oraczewski]], a member of the Polish Parliament ([[Sejm]]), and the actor [[Mateusz Witkowski]]. On October 17, 1781 the Cracow city authorities gave Witkowski permission to ''perform comedy under the condition that he pay fifty Polish zloty a month to the municipal treasury.&lt;ref name="stary"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.stary-teatr.pl/content.php?url=page/informacje-o-teatrze| title = History| publisher = Narodowy Stary Teatr im.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18186">The '''International Charter "Space and Major Disasters"''' is a non-binding [[charter]] which provides for the [[charity (practice)|charitable]] and [[humanitarian]] retasked acquisition of and transmission of space [[artificial satellite|satellite]] data to relief organizations in the event of major disasters.  Initiated by the [[European Space Agency]] and the French space agency [[CNES]] after the [[United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space|UNISPACE III]] conference held in Vienna, [[Austria]] in July 1999, it officially came into operation on November&amp;nbsp;1, 2000 after the [[Canadian Space Agency]] signed onto the charter on October&amp;nbsp;20, 2000.  Their space assets were then, respectively, [[European Remote-Sensing Satellite|ERS]] and [[ENVISAT]], [[SPOT (satellites)|SPOT]] and [[Formosat]], and [[RADARSAT]].

The assorted satellite assets of various corporate, national, and international [[space agency|space agencies]] and entities provide for humanitarian coverage which is wide albeit contingent.  First activated for floods in northeast France in December 2001,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disasterscharter.org/web/charter/activation_details?p_r_p_1415474252_assetId=ACT-014 Disaster Charter – Activation Details]. Disasterscharter.org. Retrieved on 2011-03-13.&lt;/ref&gt; the Charter has since brought space assets into play for numerous floods, earthquakes, oil spills, forest fires, tsunamis, major snowfalls, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes and landslides,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disasterscharter.org/web/charter/activations Disaster Charter – Recent Activations].

Furthermore, specific agreements with other entities, including corporations, allow the Charter access to additional products of high and very high resolution from satellites such as the [[Formosat]] series, [[GeoEye]], [[IKONOS]], [[QuickBird]], and [[WorldView]].&lt;ref name="disasterscharter.org"/&gt;

In 2014 the charter was activated 41 times for disasters in 30 countries. In that year the live satellites and their instrumentalities included: The high and very high resolution [[radar]] sensors of Risat-1, [[RADARSAT]]-2, [[TerraSAR-X]], and [[TanDEM-X]] and [[Sentinel-1A]]; the optical high and very high resolution sensors of [[UK-DMC]] 2, [[Landsat]] 7 and 8, [[SPOT (satellite)|SPOT]] series 5, 6, and 7, [[Pleiades (satellite)|Pléiades]] 1A and 1B, [[PROBA]] 1, SJ-9A, GF-1, [[KOMPSAT-2]], IRS-P5 ([[Cartosat]]-1), Cartosat-2, [[Resourcesat-2]], [[Oceansat-2]], [[RapidEye]], [[Kanopus]]-V, and [[Resurs-P]], and the [[HDTV]] camera mounted the [[Kibo (ISS module)|Kibo]] module of the [[International Space Station]]; and the medium and low optical sensors of [[POES]], [[GOES]], FY-3C, the [[Metop]] series, the first two [[Meteosat]] generations, and [[Meteor-M]]. Specific agreements with other entities allow for the usage of the [[Formosat]], [[GeoEye]], [[IKONOS]], [[QuickBird]], and [[WorldViews]] satellites, which have high and very high resolution. Archival data from defunct satellites such as [[ALOS]], [[ENVISAT]], [[European Remote-Sensing Satellite|ERS]], [[CBERS]], [[IRS-1C]], [[Astra 1D]], IRS P4, P6, [[IMS-1]], [[RADARSAT]]-1, SAC-C, SPOT 1-3 &amp; 4, [[UK-DMC]], [[Landsat]]-5 and NigeriaSat are also available.&lt;ref name="2014 Satellites and Instrumentalities"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.disasterscharter.org/documents/10180/66908/14thAnnualReport | title=14th Annual Report | publisher=International Charter Space &amp; Major Disasters | date=2015-12-31 | accessdate=2016-05-07 | pages=4–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''L'Escalade''''', or '''''Fête de l'Escalade''''' (from [[escalade]], the act of scaling defensive walls), was a notable attempt by [[Catholic]] [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy]] to conquer [[Protestant]] [[Geneva]], now commemorated by an annual festival each December celebrating the defeat of the surprise attack by troops sent by [[Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy]] during the night of 11&amp;ndash;12 December 1602. The celebrations and other commemorative activities are usually held on 12 December or the closest weekend.  

After fending off the Savoyard attack, with the help of Swiss Protestant cities, Geneva joined the [[Swiss Confederation]].

==Background==
For years, the duke coveted the wealth of the self-governing, independent, republican, Protestant city-state.  When Charles Emmanuel came to the throne of the [[House of Savoy]] in 1580, he longed to make Geneva his capital north of the Alps and crush Protestantism. [[Pope Clement VIII]] offered encouragement; in 1602 he appointed as Catholic bishop of Geneva [[Francis de Sales]], an effective preacher who had recently been successful in re-Catholicizing the [[Chablais]] district of [[Savoy]] on the south side of Lake Geneva.

==Attack==

On December 11 and December 12 ([[Old Style]]) 1602 — the darkest night of the year — the forces of the Duke of Savoy, under the command of the seigneur d'Albigny, and those of Charles Emmanuel's brother-in-law, [[Philip III of Spain]], launched an attack on the city-state of Geneva.&lt;ref name = "Mercurius"&gt;Gaspare Lorchano, ''[[Mercurius Gallobelgicus]]'', vol. 4 (Cologne, Wilhelm Lutzenkirch, 1603), p. 465f. [https://books.google.com/books?id=if07AAAAcAAJ Available on Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; The troops marched along the [[Arve River]] at night and assembled at Plainpalais, just outside the walls of Geneva, at 2 o'clock in the morning.  The original plan was to send in a group of commandos to open the city gate and let the other troops in.  The Geneva citizens defeated the invaders by preventing them from scaling the wall using cannon fire, and by fighting in the streets against the few who managed to climb over (a climb in [[French language|French]] is an ''escalade''). The alarm was raised, the church bells were rung and the Genevese were alerted. The night guard Isaac Mercier succeeded in cutting the rope holding up the portcullis, thus foiling the plan to open the main city gate. The populace fought alongside their town militia and the duke's 2000-plus mercenaries were defeated. The Genevese lost 18 men in the fighting; the Savoyards suffered 54 fatalities and the troops had to retreat. Thirteen invaders who had been taken prisoner, including several well-born gentlemen, were summarily hanged the following day as brigands, since they could not be treated as prisoners of war, peace having been repeatedly sworn on the part of Savoy.&lt;ref name = "Compagnie1602"&gt;[http://www.1602.ch/  Compagnie de 1602].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Genevese legend, Catherine Cheynel ("''Mère Royaume''"), originally from Lyon and the wife of Pierre Royaume, a mother of 14 children, seized a large cauldron of hot soup and poured it on the attackers. The Royaume family lived just above the La Monnaie town gate. The heavy cauldron of boiling soup landed on the head of a Savoyard attacker, killing him. The commotion that this caused also helped to rouse the townsfolk to defend the city.

After the defeat (and after a retaliation campaign by Geneva against Savoy, known as the contre-Escalade, that failed to meet its objectives), the Duke of Savoy accepted a lasting peace, sealed by the [[Treaty of St. Julien]] of July 12, 1603.

The story of L'Escalade is told in a song called "Cé qu'è l'ainô", written in a [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]] dialect around 1603 by an unknown author. The song has become the "national" [[anthem]] of Geneva; while the complete version comprises 68 stanzas, only four of them are usually sung.&lt;ref&gt;''Cé qu'è lainô'': National hymn of Geneva [http://un2sg4.unige.ch/athena/helvetia/cqlaino.html Lyrics and French translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also celebrated in verse by [[Samuel Chappuzeau]] in his "Genève Délivrée", the manuscript of which was presented to Geneva after his death in 1701.

==Celebration==

Although the armed conflict actually took place after midnight, in the early morning on December 12, celebrations and other commemorative activities are usually held on December 11 or the closest weekend. Celebrations include a large ''marmite'' (cauldron) made of chocolate and filled with [[marzipan]] vegetables and candies wrapped in the Geneva colours of red and gold. It is customary for the eldest and youngest in the room to smash the ''marmite'', while reciting, "''Ainsi périrent les ennemis de la République!'' " (Thus perished the enemies of the Republic), referring to how Catherine Cheynel, better known as "''Mère Royaume''," poured boiling hot vegetable soup on soldiers climbing up the walls of the city. Other traditions include [[mulled wine]], a large serving of soup, and children in various types of costumes knocking on people's doors and singing Escalade songs for money. It is also common for children in school to prepare vegetable soup, which is served to parents and families that night. Teenagers tend to throw eggs, shaving cream, and flour at each other as part of the celebration. The high school students parade together by first going to "conquer" each other and end up in the central square of the old town after walking through the "rues basses" to the plaine de Plainpalais and back.&lt;ref name = "l'Escalade Festival Tourist Information"&gt;[http://www.geneva.info/events/escalade/]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a parade on Friday evening: the names of the eighteen who died&amp;mdash;Jacques Billon finally died of his wounds a year later&amp;mdash;are called out, one after another. The historical procession on Sunday features more or less 800 people (from old Genevese families) with historical costumes, the remaining fragments of the ladders used by the Savoyards, and horses. This parade - organised since 1926 by the [[Compagnie de 1602]] - attracts every year generally tens of thousand spectators.

==Escalade Run==
Since 1978 there has been another element to the celebration of the Escalade, with a [[road running]] event being held the weekend of or preceding the night of the 11th (depending on whether or not the 11th falls on a weekend).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcat.org/title/escalade-son-origine-et-ses-consequences/oclc/715050789&lt;/ref&gt; The run traditionally starts in the ''[[park|parc]] des Bastions'' and goes through the Old City of Geneva, before finishing near the start again. It is one of the most significant annual events in Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/multimedia/video/Fete_de_lEscalade.html?cid=28995618&amp;itemId=28995606&lt;/ref&gt; To partake in the Escalade race, people register and pay online or by mail. When registering, people have to specify which race they want to run. There are options for male races and female races for different age groups classified under year of birth and in some cases with which institution (for example with Ecolint at different grade levels). Besides the regular runs, there are three other major races: the Duke's race which is exclusive for adults and it costs 45 CHF, the Walking and Nordic Walking races for the ages of 10+ cost 27 CHF and the Marmite adults and youth races, in which participants wear costumes, which cost 26 CHF and 16 CHF respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.escalade.ch/cms/index.php/en/categories-and-schedule&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, participants in the races started wearing group T-shirts and creative costumes to the run, thus making it a continuation of the parade. After each race the results are announced and the best results of each race get published in the Tribune de Genève.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.escalade.ch/cms/index.php/en/results&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10676">'''Animals used by laboratories for testing purposes''' are largely supplied by dealers who specialize in selling them to universities, medical and veterinary schools, and companies that provide contract [[Animal testing|animal-testing]] services. It is comparatively rare that animals are procured from sources other than specialized dealers,&lt;ref name=library&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.libraryindex.com/pages/2183/Research-Animals-SOURCES-RESEARCH-ANIMALS.html|title=Sources of Research Animals|publisher=Library Index Science Encyclopedia|accessdate=April 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as this poses the threat of introducing disease into a colony and confounding any data collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aclam.org/education/guidelines/position_adequatecare.html|title=Adequate Veterinary Care Guidelines|publisher=American College of Laboratory Animal Medicine|accessdate=April 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, suppliers of laboratory animals may include [[breeder]]s who supply purpose-bred animals, businesses that trade in wild animals, and dealers who supply animals sourced from pounds, auctions, and newspaper ads. Animal shelters may also supply the laboratories directly. Some animal dealers, termed Class B dealers, have been reported to engage in kidnapping pets from residences or illegally trapping strays, a practice dubbed as '''bunching'''.&lt;ref name=bunching&gt;Salinger, Lawrence and Teddlie, Patricia. [http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/3/3/8/8/p33882_index.html "Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Criminology, Royal York, Toronto"], October 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillham&gt;Gillham, Christina. [http://www.newsweek.com/id/57139 "Bought to be sold"], ''Newsweek'', February 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HSUSDealers&gt;[http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/pets_experiments/ Class B dealers], Humane Society of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dealers in the United States==
All laboratories using vertebrate lab animals in the United States are required by law to have a licensed veterinarian on staff and to adhere to the NIH Guide for the Use and Care of Laboratory Animals, which further stipulates that all protocols, including the sources for obtaining the animals, must be reviewed by an [[Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee|independent committee]].&lt;ref&gt;http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/olaw.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class A dealers===
Class A breeders are licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to sell animals bred specifically for research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/14mar20010800/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2003/9cfr1.1.htm USDOA 9CFR1.1 Definitions]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2004, there were 4,117 licensed Class A dealers in the United States.&lt;ref name=library/&gt;

===Class B dealers===
Class B dealers are licensed by the USDA to buy animals from "random sources". This refers to animals who were not purpose-bred or raised on the dealers' property.&lt;ref name=HSUSDealers/&gt; Animals from "random sources" come from auctions, pounds, newspaper ads (including "free-to-home" ads), and some may be stolen pets or illegally trapped strays.&lt;ref name=bunching/&gt; As of February 2013, there were only seven active Class B dealers remaining in the United States. However, these sources round up "thousands" of cats and dogs each year for sale.&lt;ref name=HSUSDealers/&gt;

====Animal shelters====
Animals are also sold directly to laboratories by shelters. According to the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA), Iowa, Minnesota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Utah require publicly funded shelters to surrender animals to any Class B dealer who asks for them.&lt;ref name=ASPCAdealers&gt;[http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=kids_ri_animaltesting_comefrom Animal Testing: Where Do the Animals Come From?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627163237/http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=kids_ri_animaltesting_comefrom |date=2008-06-27 }} ASPCA&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen states prohibit the practice,&lt;ref&gt;According to the ASPCA,{{cite web|url=http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename%3Dkids_ri_animaltesting_comefrom |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627163237/http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=kids_ri_animaltesting_comefrom |archivedate=2008-06-27 |df= }} these states prohibit shelters from providing animals for research: Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, and West Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt; and the remainder either have no relevant legislation, or permit the practice in certain circumstances.&lt;ref name=ASPCAdealers/&gt;&lt;ref name=HSUS1&gt;[http://www.hsus.org/animals_in_research/species_used_in_research/dog.html Dog profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226113001/http://www.hsus.org/animals_in_research/species_used_in_research/dog.html |date=2008-02-26 }}, The Humane Society of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There is a discrepancy between the Humane Society and the ASPCA in the specific states requiring and prohibiting the practice; according to the former, 3 states require, while 17 states prohibit.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bunching====
According to a paper presented to the [[American Society of Criminology]] in 2006, an illegal economy in the theft of pets, mostly dogs, has emerged in the U.S. in recent years, with the thieves known as "bunchers". The bunchers sell the animals to Class B animal dealers, who pay $25 per animal. The dealers then sell the animals to universities, medical and veterinary schools, and companies providing animal-testing services. Lawrence Salinger and Patricia Teddlie of [[Arkansas State University]] told the conference that these institutions pay up to $500 for a stolen animal, who is often accompanied by forged documents and fake health certificates. Salinger and Teddlie argue that the stolen animals may affect research results, because they come from unknown backgrounds and have an uncertain health profile.&lt;ref name=bunching/&gt; Conversely the [[Foundation for Biomedical Research]] claim that pets being stolen for animal research is largely an [[Urban legend|urban myth]] and that the majority of stolen dogs are most likely used for [[dog fighting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbresearch.org/survivors/PetTheftMyth.htm|title=Foundation for Biomedical Research|work="The Pet Theft Myth|accessdate=2007-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest Class B dealer in dogs in the U.S. was investigated for bunching by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 2005. Chester C. Baird, of Martin Creek Kennels and Pat's Pine Tree Farms in Willifore, [[Arkansas]], lost his licence after being convicted of 100 counts of animal abuse and neglect, and of stealing pets for laboratories and forging documentation. The criminal charges were filed after an eight-year investigation by an animal protection group, [[Last Chance for Animals]]. The group filmed over 72 hours of undercover video at Martin Creek Kennels, which included footage of dogs being shot.&lt;ref&gt;Crews, Chip, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/20/AR2006022001591.html ''HBO's 'Dogs': A Gnawing Portrait of Despair''], Washington Post,
February 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HSUSBaird&gt;[http://www.hsus.org/animals_in_research/animals_in_research_news/animal_dealer_loses_license_and_pays_record_fine.html Notorious Animal Dealer Loses License and Pays Record Fine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325225027/http://www.hsus.org/animals_in_research/animals_in_research_news/animal_dealer_loses_license_and_pays_record_fine.html |date=2008-03-25 }}, The Humane Society of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[HBO]] produced '''''Dealing Dogs''''', a documentary film based on this footage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbo.com/docs/programs/dealingdogs/synopsis.html ''Dealing Dogs''], [[HBO]] Documentary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Felicia R., [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/21/arts/television/21dogs.html?pagewanted=all ''How Dogs Are Abused in a Scheme for Profit''], [[The New York Times]], February 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Baird's customers included the [[University of Missouri]], [[University of Colorado Health Sciences Center]], and [[Oregon State University]]. According to the Humane Society of the United States, Missouri was experiencing such a high rate of pet theft that animal protection groups had dubbed it the "Steal Me State". In a 2008 article, Last Chance for Animals estimated that around two million pets are stolen in the U.S. each year.&lt;ref name=HSUSBaird/&gt;

==Dealers in the European Union ==
Animal dealers in the [[European Union]] (EU) are governed by Council Directive 86/609/EEC.&lt;ref name=direct1&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31986L0609:EN:HTML Council Directive 86/609/EEC of 24 November 1986]&lt;/ref&gt; This directive sets forth specific requirements regulating the supply and breeding of animals intended for use by testing facilities within the EU. The directive defines 'breeding establishment' as a facility engaged in breeding animals for their use in experiments, and 'supplying establishment' as a facility other than a breeding establishment, which supplies animals for experiments.

Article 15 of the directive requires supplying establishments to obtain animals only from approved breeding or other supplying establishments, "unless the animal has been lawfully imported and is not a feral or stray animal." Nonetheless, the directive allows
exemptions from this sourcing requirement "under arrangements determined by the authority."&lt;ref name=direct1/&gt;

Animal rights supporters have raised concerns that these rules allow strays and pets to be used for experimentation, either by exemptions or by importing animals from non-EU countries, where the rules may be more lax.&lt;ref&gt;Langley, Chris et al. [http://www.experimentation-animale.org/english/gbchiens_chats_ch3.html ''Experiments on cats and dogs in France''], One Voice, France, March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a new EU directive was published on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes, repealing the old directive 86/609/EEC on January 1, 2013, with the exception of Article 13 (statistical information on the use of animals in experiments) which has been repealed on May 10, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:276:0033:0079:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47627">[[Food]] may be accidentally or deliberately contaminated by [[microbiology|microbiological]], chemical or physical hazards.

In contrast to microbiologically caused foodborne illness, the link between exposure and effect of chemical hazards in foods is usually complicated by cumulative low doses and the delay between exposure and the onset of symptoms. Chemical hazards include environmental contaminants, food ingredients (such as iodine), heavy metals, [[mycotoxins]], natural toxins, improper storage, processing contaminants, and veterinary medicines.

Incidents have occurred because of poor harvesting or storage of grain, use of banned veterinary products, industrial discharges, [[human error]] and deliberate adulteration and fraud.&lt;ref name=Thomson2012&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1757-837X.2012.00129.x |title=Incidents and impacts of unwanted chemicals in food and feeds |year=2012 |last1=Thomson |first1=Barbara |last2=Poms |first2=Roland |last3=Rose |first3=Martin |journal=Quality Assurance and Safety of Crops &amp; Foods |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=77–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition of an incident ==
An "incident" of chemical food contamination may be defined as an episodic occurrence of adverse health effects in humans (or animals that might be consumed by humans) following high exposure to particular chemicals, or instances where episodically high concentrations of chemical hazards were detected in the food chain, and traced back to a particular event.&lt;ref name=Thomson2012/&gt;

== Socio-economic impacts ==
Information on the impacts of these incidents is fragmentary and unsystematic, ranging from thousands of dollars to meet the cost of monitoring analysis, to many millions of dollars due to court prosecutions, bankruptcy, product disposal, compensation for revenue loss, damage to brand or reputation, or loss of life.&lt;ref name=Thomson2012/&gt;

==List of notable incidents==

===Ancient times===
*Roman Empire – There is speculation that the Romans, in particular the elite, suffered chronic to severe lead poisoning due to the ubiquity of lead in e.g. lined pots in which acidic foodstuffs were boiled, over and above any mere exposure to lead in water pipes. They also used [[Lead(II) acetate|sugar of lead]] to sweeten their wines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://io9.com/5877587/the-first-artificial-sweetener-poisoned-lots-of-romans|title=The first artificial sweetener poisoned lots of Romans|first=Keith |last=Veronese|date=Jan 20, 2012|work=io9.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
*Europe - numerous incidents of human poisoning due to the consumption of rye bread made from grain [[Ergot#History|infected with ergot fungi]]

===19th century===
*1850s - [[Swill milk scandal]] in New York
*1857 – adulteration of bread with [[alum]] in London, causing rickets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/injepidemiology32_336_337_2003.pdf |title=On the adulteration of bread as a cause of rickets |publisher=Ph.ucla.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1857 - poisoning of bread with arsenic in Hong Kong targeting the colonial community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lowe|first1=Kate|title='Caution!

*1858 – [[1858 Bradford sweets poisoning|sweets poisoned with arsenic]] in Bradford, England.
&lt;!--*1890's Routine incorporation of hydrogenated vegetable oils has caused a range of health issues such as obesity and increase in coronary and related diseases (Cf. [[Trans fat]]).--&gt;

===1900 to 1949===
*1900 - [[1900 English beer poisoning]] - Beer contaminated with [[arsenic]]. Traced to sugar manufactured with sulphuric acid that was naturally contaminated with arsenic from Spanish [[pyrites]]. An epidemic of 6070 cases in London, including 70 deaths&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)81229-0 |title=An Account of the Epidemic Outbreak of Arsenical Poisoning Occurring in Beer-Drinkers in the North of England and the Midland Counties in 1900 |year=1901 |last1=Septimus Reynolds |first1=Ernest |journal=The Lancet |volume=157 |issue=4038 |pages=409–52 }} Also printed as {{cite journal|pmid=20896969 |pmc=2036791 | volume=84 | title=An Account of the Epidemic Outbreak of Arsenical Poisoning occurring in Beer Drinkers in the North of England and the Midland Counties in 1900 |year=1901 |journal=Med Chir Trans |pages=409–52 | last1 = Reynolds | first1 = ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1910–45 – [[Cadmium]] from mining waste contaminated rice irrigation water in Japan. Illness known as [[Itai-itai disease]] affected more than 20% of women aged over 50 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kasuya |first=M |title=Water pollution by cadmium and the onset of Itai-itai disease |journal=Water Science and Technology |year=1992 |volume=26 |pages=149–56 |last2=Teranishi |first2=M |last3=Aoshima |first3=K |last4=Katoh |first4=T |last5=Horiguchi |first5=H |last6=Morikawa |first6=Y |last7=Nishijo |first7=M |last8=Iwata |first8=K |url=http://www.iwaponline.com/wst/02511/wst025110149.htm |access-date=2013-11-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006194252/http://www.iwaponline.com/wst/02511/wst025110149.htm |archive-date=2014-10-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1920 – In South Africa, 80 people suffered poisoning from eating bread contaminated with naturally occurring [[pyrrolizidine alkaloid]]s.&lt;ref name=Kakar2010/&gt;
*1900–47 – Severe and widespread [[neurological disorder]]s due to bread flour bleached with [[Nitrogen trichloride|agene]], a process no longer in use. The denatured protein in the treated flour is toxic and causes a condition of hysteria in dogs eating biscuits made from the flour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10052866 |year=1998 |last1=Shaw |first1=CA |last2=Bains |first2=JS |title=Did consumption of flour bleached by the agene process contribute to the incidence of neurological disease? |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=477–81 |journal=Medical Hypotheses |doi=10.1016/S0306-9877(98)90067-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1930s – A striking example of OPIDN [[Organophosphate poisoning]] occurred during the 1930s Prohibition Era when thousands of men in the American South and Midwest developed arm and leg weakness and pain after drinking a "medicinal" alcohol substitute called "[[Jamaica ginger|Ginger Jake]]", which contained an adulterated Jamaican ginger extract containing [[tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate]] (TOCP), which resulted in partially reversible neurologic damage. The damage resulted in the limping "Jake Leg" or "Jake Walk" which were terms frequently used in the blues music of the period. Europe experienced outbreaks of TOCP poisoning from contaminated [[abortifacient]]s. Morocco experienced outbreaks of TOCP poisoning from contaminated cooking oil.

===1950 to 2000===
*1951 - [[1951 Pont-Saint-Esprit mass poisoning]] in France, probably caused by [[Ergot]].
*1950s – [[Minamata disease]]: [[Mercury (metal)|Mercury]] poisoning in fish in Japan, contaminated by industrial discharge. By 2010 more than 14,000 victims had received financial compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1-link=Timothy S.

*1955 – [[Morinaga Milk arsenic poisoning incident]]: Arsenic in milk powder in Japan. An industrial grade of [[Monosodium phosphate]] additive which inadvertently contained 5–8% [[arsenic]], was added to milk fed to infants. Over 600 died, and over 6,000 people suffered health effects such as severe mental retardation. Those health effects have continued in the remaining survivors today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/uu35ie/uu35ie09.htm|title=Chapter - 3 The arsenic milk poisoning incident|website=archive.unu.edu|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dakeishi|first=Miwako|last2=Murata|first2=Katsuyuki|last3=Grandjean|first3=Philippe|date=2006|title=Long-term consequences of arsenic poisoning during infancy due to contaminated milk powder|journal=Environmental Health|volume=5|page=31|doi=10.1186/1476-069X-5-31|issn=1476-069X|pmc=1635412|pmid=17076881}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1957 – Chicken feed and thence chickens were contaminated with [[dioxin]]s from [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] treated cow hides in the United States. 300,000 chickens were killed or destroyed to avoid consumption&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Firestone |first1=David |year=1973 |title=Etiology of chick edema disease |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=5 |issue= |pages=59–66 |jstor=3428114 |pmid=4201768 |doi=10.1289/ehp.730559 |pmc=1474955}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1959 – [[Moroccan oil poisoning disaster]]: several thousand people in [[Meknes]] suffer flaccid [[paralysis]] caused by deliberate contamination of cooking oil with jet engine lubricating oil containing [[tricresyl phosphate]] got as surplus from a US airbase at [[Nouaceur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=British Journal of Industrial Medicine|title=Book Reviews: Triaryl-Phosphate Poisoning in Morocco 1959.

*1965 - Mass poisoning resulting from contamination of flour with [[4,4'-Methylenedianiline]] in Epping, Essex, United Kingdom
*1968 - [[Yushō disease]]; mass poisoning resulting from rice bran oil contaminated with [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s in [[Kyūshū]], Japan

*1974–1976 – Afghanistan: widespread poisoning (an estimated 7800 people affected with hepatic veno-occlusive disease (liver damage) and about 1600 deaths) was attributed to wheat contaminated with weed seeds known as charmac (''[[Heliotropium]] popovii''. H Riedl) that contain [[pyrrolizidine alkaloid]]s.&lt;ref name=Kakar2010/&gt;
*1976 – [[Seveso disaster|Seveso dioxin]] contamination in Italy.

*1981 – Spanish [[Toxic Oil Syndrome]]. Thousands permanently damaged by eating industrial [[colza oil]] denatured with [[aniline]] and sold as olive oil. There was strong suspicion that the cause was in fact insecticide in Spanish tomatoes, and that official agencies actively supported the contaminated oil position, suppressing evidence contradicting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/aug/25/research.highereducation |title=The Spanish cooking oil scandal |newspaper=The Guardian |date=25 August 2001  |author=Bob Woffinden |accessdate= 28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Italian Wine and Food Institute]], which represents Italian wine exporters in New York, was quoted here as saying that all Italian wine shipped to the United States is subjected to strict quality control in order to win the Italian government's seal of approval. Italy ships more wine to the United States than any other wine-producing nation, but most of its wine exports go to France and Germany, in that order, much of it in bulk for use in cutting domestic wines with higher-alcohol Italian varieties. It is far worse in scale than the scandal that virtually eliminated Austrian wines from the market last year. Some Austrian wine makers were found to have added ethylene glycol, a toxic, sweetening element, to their wines, and the discovery wiped out export sales. Ethylene glycol is also used in antifreeze. There were no known fatalities from the tainted Austrian wine.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1987 – [[Beech-Nut Nutrition Corporation]] paid $2.2 million, then the largest fine issued, for violating the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] by selling artificially flavored sugar water as apple juice. John F. Lavery, the company's vice president for operations was convicted in criminal court and sentenced to a year and a day in jail; Niels L. Hoyvald, the president of the company, also convicted, served six months of [[community service]]. Each of them also paid a $100,000 fine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Traub, James|date=July 24, 1988|title=Into the Mouths of Babes|work=The New York Times|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE4DB1E38F937A15754C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all. |accessdate=2008-10-28|quote=It is well within the reach of most white-collar criminals to assume an air of irreproachable virtue, especially when they're about to be sentenced.

Platt]] of the United States District Court in Brooklyn last month – especially in light of what they were being sentenced for. As president and vice president of the [[Beech-Nut]] Nutrition Corporation, Hoyvald and Lavery had sold millions of bottles of apple juice that they knew to contain little or no apple juice at all – only sugars, water, flavoring and coloring. The consumers of this bogus product were babies.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*1998 – [[1998 Delhi oil poisoning]]. In [[New Delhi]], India, edible [[mustard oil]] [[wikt:adulterate|adulterated]] with ''[[Argemone mexicana]]'' seed oil caused [[epidemic dropsy]] in thousands of people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/pgmj.75.889.657 |title=Classic diseases revisited: Epidemic dropsy in India |year=1999 |last1=Sharma |first1=B D |last2=Malhotra |first2=S. |last3=Bhatia |first3=V. |last4=Rathee |first4=M. |journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal |volume=75 |issue=889 |pages=657–61 |pmid=10621875 |pmc=1741391}}&lt;/ref&gt; because ''[[Argemone mexicana]]'' seed oil contains the toxic alkaloids [[sanguinarine]] and [[dihydrosanguinarine]]. The epidemic in 1998 at New Delhi is the largest so far, in which over 60 people died and more than 3000 were hospitalized.

*1998 – In Germany and the [[Netherlands]], meat and milk were found with elevated [[dioxin]] concentrations. The dioxin was traced to citrus pulp from Brazil that had been neutralized with lime contaminated with dioxin. 92,000 tons of citrus pulp was discarded. The citrus pulp market collapsed in some European countries. A tolerance level for dioxins in citrus pulp was set by the European Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0045-6535(99)00352-5 |title=Increase of the PCDD/F-contamination of milk, butter and meat samples by use of contaminated citrus pulp |year=2000 |last1=Malisch |first1=Rainer |journal=Chemosphere |volume=40 |issue=9–11 |pages=1041–53 |pmid=10739045}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1999 – In Belgium, animal feed contaminated with dioxins and [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s affected more than 2500 poultry and pig farms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6186">A '''mass mortality event''' (MME) is an incident that kills a vast number of a single species in a short period of time.&lt;ref name="fey"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fey|first1=Samuel B.|last2=Siepielski|first2=Adam M.|last3=Nusslé|first3=Sébastien|last4=Cervantes-Yoshida|first4=Kristina|last5=Hwan|first5=Jason L.|last6=Huber|first6=Eric R.|last7=Fey|first7=Maxfield J.|last8=Catenazzi|first8=Alessandro|last9=Carlson|first9=Stephanie M.|title=Recent shifts in the occurrence, cause, and magnitude of animal mass mortality events|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=27 January 2015|volume=112|issue=4|pages=1083–1088|doi=10.1073/pnas.1414894112|pmid=25583498|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/4/1083|accessdate=26 February 2018|pmc=4313809}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event may put a species at risk of [[extinction]] or upset an [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name="DD"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Derbyshire|first1=David|title=The terrifying phenomenon that is pushing species towards extinction|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/25/mass-mortality-events-animal-conservation-climate-change?CMP=fb_us#link_time=1519565187|accessdate=25 February 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=25 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is distinct from the mass die-off associated with short lived and synchronous emergent insect [[taxa]] which is a regular and non-catastrophic occurrence.&lt;ref name="HoI"&gt;{{cite book|first1=|editor1-last=Rasnitsyn|editor1-first=Alexandr P.|title=History of insects|date=2002|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht, The Netherlands|isbn=9781402000263|page=28|edition=Reprint.|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=qTA_Qee-unYC&amp;pg=PA28|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Causes of MME's include disease and human-related activities such as pollution. Climatic extremes and other environmental influences such as oxygen stress in aquatic environments play a role, as does starvation. In many MME's there are multiple stressors.&lt;ref name="DD" /&gt; An analysis of such events from 1940 to 2012 found that these events have become more common for birds, fish and marine invertebrates, but have declined for amphibians and reptiles and not changed for mammals.&lt;ref name="JJL"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Jane J.|title=Mass Animal Die-Offs Are on the Rise, Killing Billions and Raising Questions|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/01/150113-mass-die-off-disease-animals-environment-science/|accessdate=25 February 2018|publisher=[[National Geographic]]|date=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Known mass mortality events==

'''Harbour Seals (1988)'''

In 1988, the death of 20,000 [[harbour seals]] in the [[North Sea]] was found to be due to [[phocine distemper virus]]. Ten years later two bacteria were implicated in the death of 1600 [[New Zealand sea lion]]s. On [[Marion Island]] in 2007, some 250–300 adult male [[Subantarctic fur seal]] died in a two-week period. It was suggested but not proven that this gender-biased mortality was caused by  [[Streptococcus sanguinis]] which was carried by the [[house mouse]], an alien species accidentally introduced in the 1800s.&lt;ref name="dB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Bruyn|first1=P.

'''Mule Deer (2003)'''

In the [[Inyo National Forest]] there are several records of large numbers of migrating [[mule deer]] falling to their deaths by slipping on ice while crossing mountain passes. This has occurred when heavy snowfalls have persisted until fall, and have been turned to ice by frequent thawing and freezing.&lt;ref name="SR"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rea|first1=Sarah|title=A Slippery Slope|url=http://thesheetnews.com/2017/11/22/a-slippery-slope/|accessdate=25 February 2018|work=The Sheet|date=22 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 a rain-on-snow event encased the ground in ice, resulting in the starvation of 20,000 [[muskoxen]] on [[Banks Island]] in the Canadian Arctic.&lt;ref name="JP"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Putkonen|first1=Jaakko|last2=Grenfell|first2=Thomas C.|last3=Rennert|first3=Kevin|last4=Bitz|first4=Cecilia|last5=Jacobson|first5=Paul|last6=Russell|first6=Don|title=Rain on Snow: Little Understood Killer in the North|journal=[[Eos (magazine)|Eos]]|date=30 June 2009|volume=90|issue=26|pages=221–222|doi=10.1029/2009EO260002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berger|first1=J.|last2=Hartway|first2=C.|last3=Gruzdev|first3=A.|last4=Johnson|first4=M.|title=Climate Degradation and Extreme Icing Events Constrain Life in Cold-Adapted Mammals|journal=Scientific Reports|date=18 January 2018|volume=8|issue=1|pages=1156|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-19416-9|pmid=29348632|pmc=5773676|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-19416-9|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saiga Antelope (2015)'''

In 2015, some 200,000 [[saiga antelope]] died within a period of one week in a 20 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area of the [[Betpak-Dala]] desert region of [[Kazakhstan]]. They had gathered in large groups for their annual calving. It was determined that warm and humid temperatures had caused [[Pasteurella multocida]], a bacteria that normally live harmlessly in their tonsils, to cross into their bloodstream and cause [[Hemorrhagic septicemia]]. This event wiped out 60% of the population of this [[critically endangered]] species. Mass mortality events are not uncommon for saiga. In 1981, 70,000 died, in 1988 there were 200,000 deaths and more recently in 2010 12,000 died.&lt;ref name="UNE"&gt;{{cite web|title=Catastrophic Collapse of Saiga Antelopes in Central Asia|url=https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/press-release/catastrophic-collapse-saiga-antelopes-central-asia|website=UN Environment|accessdate=25 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DD" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1982">The '''Miklós Schweitzer Competition''' (''Schweitzer Miklós Matematikai Emlékverseny'' in Hungarian) is an annual [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[mathematics]] competition for [[university]] undergraduates, established in 1949.

It is named after Miklós Schweitzer (1 February 1923 – 28 January 1945), a young Hungarian mathematician who died under the [[Siege of Budapest]] in the [[Second World War]].

The Schweitzer contest is uniquely high-level among mathematics competitions. The problems, written by prominent Hungarian mathematicians, are challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the fields represented. The competition is open-book and competitors are allowed ten days to come up with solutions.

The problems on the competition can be classified roughly in the following categories: 
1. Algebra 
2. Combinatorics 
3. Theory of Functions
4. Geometry
5. Measure Theory
6. Number Theory
7. Operators
8. Probability Theory
9. Sequences and Series
10. Topology 
11. Set Theory

Recently a [https://concourssmf2018.sciencesconf.org/ similar competition] has been started in France.

'''Orphan Wisdom''' is a philosophical system invented and promoted by Stephen Jenkinson that believes what modern people "suffer from most is culture failure, amnesia of ancestry and deep family story, phantom or sham rites of passage, no instruction on how to live with each other or with the world around us or with our dead or with our history."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://orphanwisdom.com/teachings/making-wisdom/ Making Wisdom]" on the [http://orphanwisdom.com/ Orphan Wisdom] website.

[[Ortigueira]], a seaport and borough in County [[Ferrolterra]] ([[A Coruña]]) in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], celebrates its patron saint day -'''Saint Martha of Ortigueira's Day'''- on 29 July.

Held during Saint Martha's day, '''Ortigueira's Festival of Celtic World''' (Festival Internacional do Mundo Celta de Ortigueira) is the highlight of the borough's summertime festival calendar. The festival lasts for four days, Thursday to Sunday, and is free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =Festival internacional do Mundo Celta de Ortigueira | work = Camiño da música | publisher =Xacobeo | url =http://programacion2010.xacobeo.es/gl/eventos/festival-internacional-do-mundo-celta-de-ortigueira | accessdate =16 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =Festival Internacional do Mundo Celta de Ortigueira | work =Festivals | publisher =Last.fm | url =http://www.last.fm/festival/140122+Festival+Internacional+do+Mundo+Celta+de+Ortigueira | accessdate =16 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main stage is located in the port, and it has hosted performances by Celtic music groups of great level and international fame, such as [[Alan Stivell]] or [[The Chieftains]], among many others. Since the 2000 edition in the surroundings of the port rises a smaller stage, the Runas stage, where a jury competition is held between new groups. The prize to the winner is the performance in the main stage in the edition of the following year. Free campsites are available on the beach of Morouzos and in the pine grove for people who go to the festival.

It is considered a Festival of International Tourist Interest and is one of the largest folk festivals in terms of number of attendees from all over Europe, having occasionally surpassed 100,000 attendees per edition.

==History==
The inaugural festival was organised in 1978 by the ''Escola de Gaitas de Ortigueira''. It was held from 1978 to 1987 and has been held since 1995.

[[Air Marshal]] '''Sir Beresford Peter Torrington Horsley''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|KCB|CBE|LVO|AFC}} (25 March 1921 – 20 December 2001) was a senior [[Royal Air Force]] commander.

==Early life==
Horsley was the youngest of seven children of a West Hartlepool merchant, who shot himself in 1922 after the collapse of the family business. He was educated at the [[Dragon School]], Oxford, and [[Wellington College (Berkshire)|Wellington College]].

==Military career==
In 1939, he became a deck boy on the TSS ''Cyclops'', a [[Blue Funnel Line]] steamer sailing to [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. He transferred to the homeward-bound TSS ''Menelaus'' when the [[Second World War]] was declared, but then deserted ship. As a member of the [[British Merchant Navy|Merchant Navy]] Horsley would not have been able to join the RAF, which was his ambition. 

Horsley served briefly in the [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]] before joining the RAF, initially as an air gunner, as this was the only vacancy then available. However, he managed to get a transfer to pilot training, and was soon himself an instructor at [[RAF Cranwell]].

He was transferred to the [[Flying Training School]] at Penfold, [[Alberta]] in 1942, and then to the [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] Conversion Unit at Greenwood, [[Nova Scotia]], 1943–1944. He then joined 21 Squadron&lt;ref name=air&gt;[http://www.rafweb.org/Biographies/Horsley.htm Air of Authority — A History of RAF Organisation — Air Marshal Horsley]&lt;/ref&gt; of 140 Wing, [[RAF Hunsdon]], flying [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquitoes]] on night fighter intruder missions over [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Germany]]. After [[D-Day]] he was shot down over the [[English Channel]] near [[Cherbourg]] and was picked up by an Air-Sea Rescue launch after three days. His navigator was killed, and he spent time in hospital and the RAF rehabilitation centre at [[Loughborough]].  

Horsley then was attached to the communications squadron of the 2nd Tactical Air Force in [[France]], and was personal pilot to [[Major-General]] Sir Miles Graham during the [[Normandy invasion]]. He returned to the [[United Kingdom]] in 1947 and joined the staff of the [[Central Flying School]], 23 Training [[Group (air force unit)|Group]]. He received a permanent commission and was appointed [[adjutant]] to the Oxford [[University Air Squadron]] in 1948.&lt;ref name=air/&gt;

He joined the [[Royal Household]] in July 1949, as a Squadron Leader, as Extra [[Equerry]] to [[Her Royal Highness]] the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh]] and [[His Royal Highness]] the [[Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=air/&gt; He was also concurrently Officer Commanding 29 Squadron, [[RAF Tangmere]], [[Sussex]], flying [[Gloster Meteor|Meteor]] IX fighters. In 1952 he became a [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] and Temporary Equerry to Her Majesty [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|The Queen]],&lt;ref name=air/&gt; and in 1953 he became full-time as Equerry to the Duke of Edinburgh,&lt;ref name=air/&gt; relinquishing the second appointment in command of his squadron. He remained the Duke’s Equerry until 1956. 

In the late 1950s he became senior instructor at the RAF Flying College, [[Manby]] in [[Lincolnshire]] and was then made Station Commander at [[RAF Wattisham]] in [[Suffolk]] in 1959.&lt;ref name=air/&gt; He went on to be [[Group Captain]] Near East Air Force (NEAF) operations based in [[Cyprus]] on 1962.&lt;ref name=air/&gt;

Horsley attended the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]], and was then appointed Deputy Commandant at the [[Joint Warfare Establishment]] at [[Old Sarum]] in [[Wiltshire]] in 1966.&lt;ref name=air/&gt; 

He became an [[Air Vice Marshal]] and was made [[Assistant Chief of the Air Staff|Assistant Chief of Air Staff]] (Operations) in 1968, then Commanding Officer [[No. 1 Group RAF|No. 1 Group]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=air/&gt; His last appointment in the RAF was as Deputy [[Commander-in-Chief]] [[RAF Strike Command]] in 1973 before he retired in 1975.&lt;ref name=air/&gt;

==Later life==
Sir Peter wrote an autobiography, ''Sounds From Another Room'' (1997), which described his interest in [[UFO]]s, which began when Equerry to His Royal Highness the [[Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]], and a close encounter with an "[[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]" in [[London]] in 1954. He died in 2001.

==Honours==
Horsley received the French [[Croix de guerre 1939–1945|Croix de Guerre]] in 1944, and the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]] in 1945. He was made a [[Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order]] in 1956, and a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1964.

[[File:Puppy mill02.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A puppy mill in the rural [[United States]]]]

A '''puppy mill''', sometimes known as a '''puppy farm''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://montereycountydemocrats.org/node/621|title=Farr Introduces Bill to Regulate Puppy Farms|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of commercial [[dog breeding]] facility.  Although no standardized legal definition for "puppy mill" exists, a definition was established in ''Avenson v. Zegart'' in 1984 as "a dog breeding operation in which the health of the dogs is disregarded in order to maintain a low overhead and maximize profits".&lt;ref name="Avenson"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Avenson v.

The term "mill" is also applied to operations involving other animals commercially bred for profit, including cats.&lt;ref name="aspca_glossary"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.aspca.org/animal-cruelty/puppy-mills|title = ASPCA: Fight Animal Cruelty: Puppy Mills|author = ASPCA|year = 2007|accessdate = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; For-profit breeding on a smaller scale may be referred to as [[backyard breeding]], although this term has negative connotations and may also refer to unplanned or non-commercial breeding.

== Differences in breeding conditions ==

[[The Kennel Club]] and the [[American Kennel Club]] state that responsible breeders should raise their animals with the intent to produce healthy dogs and to ensure that all animals are provided responsible homes and [[socialization]]. However, there is no way to enforce these wishes or records kept to prove this is the case.&lt;ref name="akc_breed_to_improve"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/breeders/resources/guide_to_breeding_your_dog/step_2.cfm |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-12-13 |title=Step Two - Breed to Improve |author=American Kennel Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wkc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/2008/show/news/breeders.html |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-12-13 |title=Buy Dogs from a Breeder |author=Westminster Kennel Club |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122023455/http://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/2008/show/news/breeders.html |archivedate=2008-01-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The socialization period in a puppy occurs between the ages of 4 weeks up to 14 weeks of age.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Draper|first1=Donald|title=Improper Puppy Socialization and Subsequent Behavior|journal=Iowa State University Veterinarian|date=1976|volume=38|issue=2|pages=Article 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period is crucial for adult development as almost all adult abilities are learned during this stage. With puppy mills essentially skipping the process of socialization, it can result in social problems when the puppy matures to an adult.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In puppy mills, female dogs are sometimes bred every time they are [[estrous cycle|in heat]], which results in gradually-decreasing sizes of litters.&lt;ref name="aspca_puppy_mills"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CREB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=11D0B2F033A603F0&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Buy or adopt?

== Common problems ==

The ASPCA states that some puppy mills can have up to 1,000 dogs under one roof. Because of the high volume of animals, the mill runner will often resort to housing them in wire cages. This results in the animals having poor locomotion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|first=|date=2010|year=|title=United States: A dog's life; "Puppy mills"|url=http://www.economist.com/node/17468228|journal=The Economist|volume=397|issue=8708|pages=36–39|via=|last1=Anonymous|accessdate=November 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Keeping dogs in wire kennels can lead to injury and damage to the dogs' paws and legs. It's also fairly common for these kennels to be stacked on top of each other in columns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The conditions in these mills are so unsanitary that the animals are often coated in their own urine and feces, causing mats in their fur.  Due to unsanitary conditions, puppies from mills will often have internal parasites, affecting their health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gadahi|first=J.A.|year=2008|title=Prevalence of Blood parasites in stray and pet Dogs in Hyderabad Area : Comparative sensitivity of different Diagnostic techniques for the detection of microfilaria|url=http://veterinaryworld.org/2008/August/Prevalence%20of%20Blood%20parasites%20in%20stray%20and%20pet%20Dogs%20in%20Hyder.pdf|journal=Veterinary World|volume=8|pages=229–232|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puppy mills are often unheated and this increases the number of deaths due to cold among the dogs used for breeding.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Conversely, the mills can also be too hot in warmer weather leading to [[hyperthermia]].&lt;ref name="Merck 207–232"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118704738.ch11/summary|title=Veterinary Forensics: Animal Cruelty Investigations|last=Merck|first=Melinda D.|last2=Miller|first2=Doris M.|last3=Reisman|first3=Robert W.|date=2012-01-01|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.,|isbn=9781118704738|editor-last=DVM|editor-first=Melinda D. Merck|pages=207–232|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118704738.ch11/summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other common conditions in mills include malnutrition and untreated injuries.&lt;ref name="Merck 207–232"/&gt;

Due to the frequently poor breeding conditions in puppy mills &lt;ref name="charitypaws"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://charitypaws.com/puppy-mills/ |title=The Real Cost of Buying a Puppy |author=CharityPaws |accessdate=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, puppies bred there often suffer from health and/or social problems. Puppies raised in a cramped environment shared by many other dogs become poorly socialized to other dogs and to humans. Dogs are then transported over long distances in poor conditions, sometimes resulting in animal stress and death. As the surviving mill dogs grow older, they are more prone to developing respiratory ailments and [[pneumonia]], as well as hereditary defects such as [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]].&lt;ref name="aspca_puppy_mills" /&gt; In addition, mill dogs are more prone to having problems with their temperament due to lack of socialization, enrichment, and positive human contact. Puppies from mills are usually sold as purebred dogs in an attempt to attract the higher prices associated with purebreds. However, due to the indiscriminate breeding practices of puppy mills, the dog may not actually be a purebred puppy.&lt;ref name="kennel_club_uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/208 |title=Where NOT to buy a puppy or a dog |author=The Kennel Club (UK) |date=2006-05-16 |accessdate=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A high population of puppies from mills are inbred due to uncontrolled breeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mixon|first1=Craig|title=Puppy Mills|url=http://newanimalcontrol.org/pupmill.shtml|website=New Animal Control|accessdate=November 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of puppy mill animals are sold to pet stores by "dealers" or "brokers". Some puppies are sold by dealers masquerading as authentic breeders.

Puppy mills in the US often start with hundreds of female dogs which serve their entire lives in the establishment. The females are bred until they can no longer conceive puppies, and are often euthanized after that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aspca.org/fight-cruelty/puppy-mills/puppy-mill-faq|title=A Closer Look at Puppy Mills|work=ASPCA|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conditions in puppy mills are considered inhumane because all of the dogs are in a small, dirty area which is confined with disease and bacteria. Because of the poor living conditions, dogs are often sick and malnourished. Food is often found crawling with bugs and feces is almost everywhere. Health issues that are prevalent in puppy mills consist of giardia, mange, heartworm, respiratory infections, and much more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peta.org/issues/companion-animal-issues/pet-trade/puppy-mills/|title=Puppy Mills|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
According to Chanis Major V. publications, puppy mills originated in the post-[[World War II]] era. Midwestern farmers looking for an alternative crop reacted to a growing demand for puppies, resulting in the development of the first commercial puppy business. As the industry grew, both small and large retail outlets began to sell puppies through pet departments. At around the same time, the first pet store chains were born.&lt;ref name="canis_major_dilemma" /&gt;

Puppy mill dogs are usually housed in a small, wire cages similar to rabbit hutches and chicken coops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.aspca.org/animal-cruelty/puppy-mills/closer-look-puppy-mills-old | title =A Closer Look at Puppy Mills | publisher = [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, veterinary care for these puppies was often overlooked because of an inability to pay. As a result, organizations such as the [[Humane Society of the United States]] began to investigate breeding kennels, leading to the passage of the [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]] of August 24, 1966.&lt;ref name="canis_major_dilemma" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usda"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/legislat/usdaleg1.htm |title=Animal Welfare Act |author=United State Department of Agriculture |date=2003-08-21 |accessdate=2007-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416104435/http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/legislat/usdaleg1.htm |archivedate=2009-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==

According to the Humane Society of the United States, there are an estimated 10,000 licensed and unlicensed puppy mills in the United States, in total selling more than 2,000,000 puppies annually.&lt;ref name="hsus_pm_faq"/&gt;

A high concentration of both puppy mills and breeders has been reported in the states of [[Pennsylvania]], [[Arkansas]], [[Kansas]], and [[Missouri]].&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1137662,00.html |title=Curbing the Puppy Trade: Dog lovers are divided over new efforts to ensure that all breeders treat their pooches humanely |accessdate=2012-10-07 |date=2005-12-04 |author=Hamilton, Anita |publisher=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pennsylvania, and in particular, [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]], has been labeled the "Puppy Mill Capital of the East" due to its high volume of puppy mills.&lt;ref name="cbs_pm_pa"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/06/11/national/main6572767.shtml | title=New Pa.

Missouri has been labeled the "Puppy Mill Capital of the U.S." by animal welfare and consumer protection groups.&lt;ref name=aspca_laws/&gt;&lt;ref name="hsus_ny"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.humanesociety.org/news/news/2011/11/ny_puppy_mill_110911.html | title=HSUS Undercover Investigation Exposes the Suffering Behind New York Pet Stores | publisher=Humane Society of the United States | date=November 9, 2012 | accessdate=October 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbb_study"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://stlouis.bbb.org/storage/142/documents/Puppy%20Mills%20study.pdf | title=The Puppy Mill Industry In Missouri | publisher=Better Business Bureau | date=March 2010 | accessdate=October 7, 2012 | author=Teuscher, Robert H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study by the [[Better Business Bureau]] concluded that the southwest corner of Missouri is the hub of the nation's puppy mill industry, and termed it the "national hot spot of the puppy industry."&lt;ref name="bbb_study" /&gt;

== Hobby breeders ==
[[File:Puppy mill 01.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Miniature breeds at a US puppy mill]]

The term "puppy mill" has been widely used by [[list of animal rights groups|animal rights group]]s in protests against breeders who have substandard breeding conditions. Critics in the breeder community claim that emotional rhetoric, sensationalism and pictures of dirty kennels are used to justify additional legislation or additional restrictive licensing that travels well beyond the initial goal of removing dogs from truly deplorable conditions,&lt;ref name="canis_major_dilemma"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canismajor.com/dog/puppymil.html |title=Just what is a puppy mill? |accessdate=2007-12-14 |year=2007 |author=Canis Major Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that attempts to legislate puppy mills would put them out of business. They argue the laws requiring additional costs in updating and maintaining their facility and licensing would be detrimental to the dogs in their care. They cite existing [[lemon law]]s for puppies as sufficient protection for both dogs and prospective buyers.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;

== Media coverage ==

On May 1st, 2008, [[MSNBC]] aired a report about puppy mills, in which talk show host [[Oprah Winfrey]] revealed an industry fraught with problems and apparent cruelty. The broadcast showed puppy mills with small cages, with [[chicken wire]] floors, stacked in rows from floor to ceiling, and stated that many dogs spend their entire lives within these tiny cages. Many of these dogs are sold on the [[internet]] or by [[pet store|pet retailers]] to buyers who are unaware of the dogs' background. The report claimed that customers who object to this treatment of puppies unknowingly allow the industry to thrive.{{Clarify|date=February 2010}} It also pointed out that many of the puppy mill bred dogs suffer long-term health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alv.org.au/issues/puppyfactories.php |title=Puppy Factories / Animal Liberation Victoria |publisher=Alv.org.au |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627000028/http://www.alv.org.au/issues/puppyfactories.php |archivedate=2012-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislative response ==

=== United States ===
{{over-coverage|section|region=the state of Missouri|date=January 2014}}
In the [[United States]], some elements of the dog breeding industry are regulated by the [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]] of August 24,&amp;nbsp;1966.&lt;ref name="awa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/legislat/usdaleg1.htm |date=2003-08-21 |accessdate=2008-01-03 |title=Animal Welfare Act and Regulations |author=Animal Welfare Information Center - United States Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service - National Agricultural Library |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416104435/http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/legislat/usdaleg1.htm |archivedate=2009-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, state legislatures have passed new laws aimed at eliminating the worst abuses at puppy mills. New laws include limits on the number of breeding females, requirements that facilities be licensed and inspected, and requirements that dogs be given proper veterinary care. Louisiana, Pennsylvania and Virginia passed puppy mill laws in 2008, and 10 states passed laws in 2009 to crack down on abusive puppy mills. In 2010, Missouri voters passed Proposition B, the "Puppy Mill Cruelty Prevention Act", which establishes minimum standards of humane care and limits breeders to 50 intact dogs.&lt;ref name="new laws"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2010/03/iowa_puppy_mill_bill_signed_030910.html |date=2010-03-09 | accessdate=2009-03-18 |title=Iowa Gov. Culver Signs Bill to Combat Puppy Mills | author=The Humane Society of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, voters experienced push-back from the industry in the state of Missouri.  Dog breeders and other farmers, worried about costly animal welfare measures spreading to their farms, pressured the state to repeal the law.  In April 2011 Proposition B was repealed.&lt;ref name="puppy mill politics"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2015150141_webanimal.html|date=2011-05-25 | title=Missouri's puppy mill politics: dog breeders outmaneuver animal-rights movement | author=Pamela M. Prah, stateline.org |work=The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A compromise, dubbed the ''Missouri Solution'', was signed by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon.&lt;ref name="missouri solution"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/article_6e5b5f7e-96ad-11e0-982f-0019bb30f31a.html|date=2011-06-14 | title=State Officials Outline New Dog Breeding Law | author=Joel Currier St. Louis Post Dispatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It retained some of the provisions of Proposition B, and made available some state funding for inspections.  Humane Society of Missouri President Kathy Warnick reacted favorably, seeing a step in the right direction for animal welfare.&lt;ref name="missouri solution"/&gt;

Detractors, which include the President and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, point to the "shameful" overturn of the voter's will to weaken Proposition B.&lt;ref name="shameful"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kplr11.com/news/kplr-humane-society-president-prop-b-pacelle-061511,0,7162016.story|date=2011-06-15 | title=Humane Society President Calls Prop B Overturn, "Shameful" | author=KPLR.11.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“Lawmakers should never have substituted their judgment for the people of Missouri and gutted core provisions of Prop B,” said Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States. "The so-called compromise was not about protecting animals, it was about placating agri-business."&lt;ref name="missouri solution"/&gt;

Below is a set of lists describing some of the key differences between Proposition B and the so-called ''Missouri Solution''.&lt;ref name="puppy mill politics"/&gt;

'''Proposition B''' (approved by Missouri voters in November, 2010)	
''Wire flooring for cages eliminated by November 2011; ''	
''Maximum allowable breeding females per business = 50; ''
''Cage height = taller than any dog standing erect; ''	
''Maximum number of times a female may be bred within 18 months time = 2; ''	
''Larger enclosures by November 2011.''	

'''the “Missouri Solution”''' (compromise law signed by Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, April 2011, after repealing Proposition B)
''No wire flooring for new enclosures in  2016, existing wire flooring permitted to remain indefinitely; ''
''No limit on number of breeding females; ''
''No restriction on cage height; ''
''No restrictions on how often females are impregnated; ''
''Larger enclosures in 2016.''

=== Australia ===

Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore has responded to the problem of puppy mills in [[Australia]] by proposing the Animals Regulation of Sale Bill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leadtheway.org.au/aboutthebill.html About the Bill | Lead The Way | Support the Animals (Regulation of Sale) Bill | Animal Welfare | Against Puppy Farms&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325223228/http://www.leadtheway.org.au/aboutthebill.html |date=March 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It would ban the sale of dogs through pet shops, the internet or newspapers. The aim is to crack down on [[impulse purchase]]s and shut down unregistered backyard breeders. These breeders should no longer easily profit from the sale of the dogs and the number of unwanted and abandoned animals could drop.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.leadtheway.org.au/clovermoore.html Clover Moore | Lead The Way | Support the Animals (Regulation of Sale) Bill | Animal Welfare | Against Puppy Farms&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325223232/http://www.leadtheway.org.au/clovermoore.html |date=March 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also recently there were a few bold initiatives to fight against puppy mills. Namely RSPCA (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) strategy, Oscar's law (The organization’s name originates from the story of a dog called Oscar, who was rescued from a puppy factory in central Victoria), and Victorian Labor Party Efforts that restrict the number of dogs per breeding facility and require that pet shop owners to keep records of every dog sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://snowyswan.com/puppy-mills-in-australia|title = Puppy Mills in Australia|date = |access-date = 18 February 2016|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===

In 1996, Britain passed [[List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, 1980–1999|the Breeding and Sale of Dogs Act]] which requires annual veterinary inspections for anyone breeding five or more litters in one year. Breeding females are restricted to one litter per year and four per lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfhs.ca/info/puppy_mill_victory_in_uk/|title=Puppy Mill Victory in UK|date=Spring 2000|accessdate=2009-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breeders who choose to be members of the UK [[Kennel club|Kennel Club]] are required to register purebred puppies for sale with that organization and must certify the conditions under which the puppies were raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/download/375/form1.pdf|title=Litter registration form|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breeders who sell puppies by misrepresenting these standards may be liable to prosecution under the Sale of Goods Act 1979.

Members of the UK public frequently buy puppies and kittens without knowing the conditions under which the animals were reared, the [[Blue Cross (animal charity)|Blue Cross]] estimates from 40,000 to 80,000 puppies are sold that way per year.  To prevent this a new law is planned banning the sale of puppies and kittens below the age of 6 months in England except by licensed breeders and rehoming centres.  Paula Boyden, of the [[Dogs Trust]], approves of the ban but advised, "potential loopholes" needed to be addressed. She maintains rehoming organisations need regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45266357 Puppy and kitten sales at pet shops set to be banned] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal cases ==
In July 2014, the [[Animal Legal Defense Fund]] and three Pennsylvania residents filed a lawsuit against the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, alleging illegal expenditure of state tax dollars on unlawful regulatory activity. According to ALDF, the Pennsylvania General Assembly amended the Dog Law in 2008 to strengthen standards of care for dogs housed in commercial breeding facilities known as “puppy mills.” Just two years later, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture weakened those minimum standards by creating regulatory exemptions for nursing mothers and their puppies. The lawsuit asks the court to order the Department of Agriculture to follow the law and end the suffering of mother dogs and their puppies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aldf.org/press-room/press-releases/animal-legal-defense-fund-sues-pennsylvania-ag-department-over-weak-puppy-mill-regulations-2/Animal|title=Animal Abandonment is a Crime|work=Animal Legal Defense Fund|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Puppy mill raids ==

=== Clewiston, Florida === 
According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty towards Animals ([[ASPCA]]), on November 17, 2015 over 100 dogs were rescued from a puppy mill raid in Clewiston, Florida.  Found in overcrowded and untidy pens with limited access to food or water, 116 dogs, including Huskies, Chihuahuas, and Poodles, were found having several ailments and untreated medical conditions that called for immediate veterinary care.  According to Tim Rickey, the Vice President of ASPCA's Field Investigations and Response team, "[ASPCA's] goal is to remove these dogs from a life of neglect, help them become healthy and eventually find them safe and loving homes."  Reports state that the two puppy mill owners, Beatriz Perez, 46, and Alexei Fernandez, 47, have been arrested on charges of animal cruelty while the [[ASPCA]] transported the 116 dogs to a safe and secure location.  The [[ASPCA]] is currently asking for donations to fund the medical treatments that many of the dogs need as well as to help these dogs find a forever home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aspca.org/secure/201511ea2-nd-ms-p1?ms=em_ea2_nd-c-p1-20151117&amp;initialms=em_ea2_nd-c-p1-20151117&amp;pcode=AFBNDWEB2P1|title=Donate to the ASPCA and Help Animals|work=ASPCA|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/2572642/clewiston-puppy-mill-bad-breeders-busted-over-100-dogs-seized-from-facility/|title=Clewiston Puppy Mill: Bad Breeders Busted, Over 100 Dogs Seized From Facility|work=The Inquisitr News|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gibson County, Tennessee ===
On November 5, 2014, the Animal Rescue Corps rescued about 100 dogs from what was said to be severely neglectful conditions.  Both adult and newborn dogs were found in extremely crowded cages exposed to ammonia with limited access to any water or food. According to the Animal Rescue Corps's spokesman, Michael Cunningham, "the dogs were suffering from untreated, painful eye infections, respiratory conditions, dental issues, severe matting that limited their mobility and vision, and urine-soaked, feces-caked fur."  Since the owners could not be reached, no criminal charges have been filed. However, the dogs were taken for thorough veterinary screenings and care followed by their transportation to in-state and out-of-state dog adoption centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jacksonsun.com/story/news/local/2014/11/05/alleged-puppy-mill-raided-in-gibson-county/18537295/|title=UPDATED: Alleged puppy mill raided in Gibson County|date=5 November 2014|work=The Jackson Sun|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== White Hall, Arkansas === 
On February 28, 2014, 15 [[Humane Society of the United States]] workers rescued 183 animals from a puppy mill, including 121 dogs, 20 horses, 19 chickens, 11 exotic birds, and several  cats, rabbits, and turtles.  30 miles south of [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], White Hall puppy mill was found with severe stenches of ammonia from the uncleaned urine and feces from the numerous neglected animals. Many animals were found without any access to food or water.  Humane Society workers stated that many of the animals required emergency veterinary care while still others suffered from severe eye conditions, dental problems, and severe dietary deficiencies.  One humane worker said, "I held dogs that were trembling and shaking and with heavy mats."  The puppy mill owners, James and Tara Best, were both charged with animal cruelty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/02/28/arkansas-puppy-mill-raid/5905591/|title=183 animals seized from suspected Ark. puppy mill|date=28 February 2014|work=USA TODAY|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1590">The '''Qing Shan King Sacrificial Ceremony''' is a festival held annually in [[Wanhua District|Wanhua]], [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]. It is held between the 20 and 22 October ([[Lunar Calendar]]) and is used to celebrate the birth of the [[deity]] [[Qing Shan King]]. During this festival, the [[Bodhisattva]]s of several other temples (including [[Qingshui Temple]]) are invited to celebrate within Wanhua.&lt;ref name="wanhua district"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chin Shan King Sacrificial Ceremony|url=http://wanhuadistrict.blogspot.tw/2013/05/qingshan-king-sacrificial-ceremony.html|work=Wanhua District|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The visiting Bodhisattvas tour Wanhua for 2 nights and then hold a birthday celebration for Qing Shan King. The purpose of touring Wanhua is to eliminate the evil spirits that bring locals bad luck and suffering. During this period, all windows and doors must be shut to prevent evil spirits from entering the locals’ households. There are three different tour routes, the first route runs from Huan He Road to Zhong Hua Road, the second starts from [[Wanhua Station]] and the last route begins from Ting Han Kou Road in [[Ximending]]. The parade usually lasts throughout the night and ends around 3 or 4am.&lt;ref name="wanhua district" /&gt;

Between 2-3 million pieces of a traditional biscuit known as "Xian Guang Bing" are given out during each celebration.&lt;ref name="wanhua district" /&gt;

The '''Royal Naval Hospital Gibraltar (RNH Gibraltar)''', formerly the '''British Military Hospital Gibraltar (BMH Gibraltar)''', was a [[military hospital]] founded c. 1903 to provide [[healthcare]] for [[British Armed Forces|British military personnel]] and [[Gibraltar Squadron|local sailors]]. The facility, located on [[Europa Road]] in the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]'s South District, comprised three buildings. The hospital was transferred to the [[Royal Navy]] in 1963. It closed in 2008, and underwent residential conversion that began prior to the hospital's closure.

During 1915 there was a continuous stream of Australian, British and New Zealander wounded who arrived in Gibraltar, via hospital ship, from Gallipoli. Many of the wounded were carried on stretchers onto the Rock by the [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment|Gibraltar Volunteer corps]] but there were far too many to fit in the hospital. Satellite hospitals were created as the only other choice was a long sea voyage.&lt;ref name=jackson&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Sir William G. F.|title=The rock of the Gibraltarians : a history of Gibraltar|year=1990|publisher=Gibraltar Books|location=Grendon|isbn=0948466146|page=265|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Military Hospital cared for casualties of the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936-1939). Among the casualties were 55 men from the [[Germany|German]] cruiser ''[[German cruiser Deutschland|Deutschland]]'' which had been bombed while at anchor off the [[Spain|Spanish]] island of [[Ibiza]]. The hospital had already been at capacity due to casualties from {{HMS|Hunter|H35}}, a Royal Navy ship that had hit a [[naval mine|mine]] while on patrol near [[Almería]] in May 1937. At the same time, staff were tending to casualties from [[HM Maine]], a [[hospital ship]]. Many of the casualties had sustained burn injuries. The influx of casualties was such that four nurses from [[Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps|Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service]] arrived at Gibraltar by [[flying boat]] to assist in the care of the German casualties. The following year, one of those nurses was awarded the [[German Red Cross Decoration]], as well as a certificate from [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref name=qaranc/&gt;

During [[Military history of Gibraltar during World War II|World War II]], casualties from the [[Malta]] area were treated at BMH Gibraltar while their ships were serviced at the [[Gibdock|Naval dockyard]]. Injuries were again most commonly burns. During the course of WWII, a second hospital, Gort's Hospital, was built in Gibraltar, in tunnel systems deep within [[Rock of Gibraltar|The Rock]]. There was concern that BMH Gibraltar could be compromised by an air raid or an invasion through [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=qaranc/&gt; Teams of [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Canadian]] engineers  prepared the tunnels and [[St. Michael's Cave]], and filled it with beds and medical equipment, even flush toilets and an operating theatre.&lt;ref name=qaranc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Military Hospital Gibraltar|url=http://www.ww2museums.com/article/24551/Former-Military-Hospital-Gibraltar.htm|work=ww2museums.com|publisher=STIWOT (Stichting Informatie Wereldoorlog Twee)|accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operating room was said to have been better than that at the conventional hospital as it had been equipped by the [[United States]]. Other underground Hospitals were Gort's Hospital (opposite the BMH) Fordham's Hospital, Monkey's Cave Convalescent Hospital and Flat Bastion Road Hospital. The [[rubble]] stone from tunneling was utilised to construct an [[Gibraltar International Airport|airstrip]] into the [[Bay of Gibraltar]].&lt;ref name=qaranc/&gt;

===Military care of the barbary macaques===
{{main|Barbary macaques in Gibraltar}}
[[Barbary macaques in Gibraltar|Gibraltar's barbary macaque population]] was under the care of the [[British Army]] and later the [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment|Gibraltar Regiment]] from 1915 to 1991, who carefully controlled a population that initially consisted of a single troop. An officer was appointed to supervise their welfare, and a food allowance of fruit, vegetables and nuts was included in the budget. Births were gazetted in true military fashion, and each new arrival was named. They were named after [[Governor of Gibraltar|governors]], [[brigadier]]s and high-ranking officers. Any ill or injured monkey needing surgery or any other form of medical attention was taken to Royal Naval Hospital Gibraltar and received the same treatment as would an enlisted service man. Following the withdrawal of the British garrison, the Government of Gibraltar took over responsibility for the monkeys.&lt;ref name=monkeys&gt;{{cite web|title=Gib Monkeys|url=http://gibraltarevents.com/gib-monkeys|publisher=gibraltarevents.com|accessdate=5 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710065341/http://gibraltarevents.com/gib-monkeys/|archivedate=10 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apes&gt;{{cite web|title=When the Apes leave the Rock, so will the British|url=http://www.llanito.net/Images/apes2/index.html|publisher=Llanito.net|accessdate=5 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185229/http://www.llanito.net/Images/apes2/index.html|archivedate=29 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Salle Ventadour''', a former Parisian theatre in the rue Neuve-Ventadour, now the rue Méhul ([[2nd arrondissement of Paris]]), was built between 1826 and 1829 for the [[Opéra-Comique]], to designs by [[Jacques-Marie Huvé]], a prominent architect. The original theatre had a capacity of 1,106, but was subsequently taken over by the [[Théâtre-Italien (1801–1878)|Théâtre-Italien]] and expanded to a capacity of 1,295 in 1841, thereafter becoming perhaps most noteworthy as the theatre in which the majority of the operas of the Italian composer [[Giuseppe Verdi]] were first performed in France. When the Théâtre-Italien company went out of business in 1878, the theatre was converted to offices.

==Opéra-Comique==
The Opéra-Comique first performed at the Salle Ventadour on 20 April 1829. The opening night audience was a distinguished one and found the new theatre luxurious and comfortable.&lt;ref name=Chouquet/&gt; The program included the one-act opera ''Les deux mousquetaires'' by [[Henri Montan Berton]], the overture to [[Étienne Méhul]]'s opera ''[[Le jeune Henri]]'', and the three-act opera ''La fiancée'' with music by [[Daniel Auber]] and a libretto by [[Eugène Scribe]]. The Opéra-Comique presented 32 premieres during its time at the Salle Ventadour, including one of [[François-Adrien Boieldieu]]'s last operas ''Les deux nuits'' on 20 May 1829, Auber's ''[[Fra Diavolo (opera)|Fra Diavolo]]'' (as ''L'hôtellerie de Terracine'') on 28 January 1830, and [[Ferdinand Hérold]]'s ''[[Zampa]]'' on 3 May 1831.&lt;ref name=Chouquet/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wild and Charlton (2005), pp.  77&amp;ndash;78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Simeone&gt;Simeone (2000), p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; After 22 March 1832 the Opéra-Comique left the Salle Ventadour and moved to the [[Salle de la Bourse]], where it opened on 24 September 1832.&lt;ref name=Chouquet/&gt;&lt;ref name=Charlton&gt;Charlton, David. "Paris. 4. 1789&amp;ndash;1870." in Sadie (1992) '''3''': 867, 869, 871.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Théâtre Nautique==
The Salle Ventadour was reopened on 10 June 1834&lt;ref name=Chouquet/&gt; as the Théâtre Nautique&amp;nbsp;— "nautique" since some of the main attractions were works performed in a basin of water on the stage. The programs included the [[ballet]]-[[pantomime]] ''Les ondines'', which was based on [[Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué|Fouqué]]'s novella ''[[Undine (novella)|Undine]]'', about a water sprite who marries a knight in order to save her soul, and used music from [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s [[Undine (Hoffmann)|opera of the same name]]; a full-length ballet ''William Tell'' with music by the German composer Jacques Strunz; a one-act ballet ''Le nouveau Robinson'' which also utilized the water; and a [[chinoiserie]]&lt;!--entr'acte?--&gt; entitled ''Chao-Kang''. These were interspersed with choruses by [[Carl Maria von Weber]] and others, sung by the members of a German company that was being formed in Paris at that time. The [[entr'acte]] was the overture to Weber's opera ''[[Oberon (Weber)|Oberon]]''. The reviews were not good, and the size of the audience decreased over time.

[[Harriet Smithson]], the Irish actress who had married the French composer [[Hector Berlioz]] on 3 October 1833,&lt;ref&gt;Cairns (1999), p.  11.&lt;/ref&gt; appeared with the Théâtre Nautique, opening on 22 November 1834 in a one-act pantomime put together by the resident choreographer Louis Henry. He called the concoction ''La derniére heure d'un condamné'', and it used music by [[Cesare Pugni]]. The scenario took advantage of her talent for mad scenes: she had previously performed Ophelia in an English-language production of Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'' at the [[Théâtre de l'Odéon]] to great acclaim in 1827. The new piece was a pantomime, since Smithson's French was far from perfect (and remained so for the rest of her life).&lt;ref&gt;Cairns (1969), pp.  619&amp;ndash;620; Barzun (1969) '''1''': 264; '''2''': 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, this new performance was not as favorably received. Jules Janin, writing in the ''[[Journal des débats]]'' described it as consisting of "the two or three dozen contortions that are known as the art of mime" and complained that "they have cut Miss Smithson's tongue out".&lt;ref name=Cairns36&gt;Cairns (1999), pp.  36&amp;ndash;40.&lt;/ref&gt; Berlioz anonymously wrote a positive review that appeared in the ''Gazette musicale'' but spent half of its time describing her previous appearance as Ophelia and the important influence it had had on the French style of acting. Not all the reviews were entirely negative: the English-language ''[[Giovanni Antonio Galignani|Galignani's Messenger]]'' praised Smithson, saying that the "single feature worth naming of this piece is the performance of Madame Berlioz, as the wife of the ''condamné'', in which the agony and despair of such a situation is depicted with the fidelity and painful truth only within the reach of a perfect artiste."&lt;ref name=Cairns36/&gt; But apparently her performances were not enough to rescue the enterprise, and the Théâtre Nautique closed in 1835.&lt;ref name=Chouquet/&gt;

==A short visit by the Théâtre-Italien==
The Salle Ventadour was used for a brief time by the [[Théâtre-Italien (1801–1878)|Théâtre-Italien]] (30 January 1838 to 31 March 1838) after the destruction of the company's previous home, the Salle Favart, by fire on 15 January 1838. Only one opera new to Paris was presented, Gaetano Donizetti's ''[[Parisina (opera)|Parisina]]''. The company moved to the Odéon for three years before returning to the Salle Ventadour in 1841.&lt;ref name=Chouquet/&gt;&lt;ref name=Charlton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Levin&gt;Levin, Alicia C. "A documentary overview of musical theaters in Paris, 1830&amp;ndash;1900" in Fauser (2009), pp.  379&amp;ndash;402.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Théâtre de la Renaissance==
While the Théâtre-Italien company was at the Odéon, the Salle Ventadour was rented by Anténor Joly, who with the encouragement of the two great French romantic dramatists [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Alexandre Dumas]], remodeled the theatre and renamed it the [[Théâtre de la Renaissance]]. Their aim was to bring together in one theatre the elitist and popular audiences of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Londré 1991, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; The new company opened on 8 November 1838 with the premiere of Hugo's drama ''[[Ruy Blas]]'' with [[Frédérick Lemaître]] in the title role. It ran for 48 performances. Two new plays by Dumas were also presented, ''Bathilde'' (14 January 1839) and ''L'alchimiste'' (10 April 1839), although these were less successful.&lt;ref&gt;Hochman 1984, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The repertoire of the company was not limited to plays: Joly also mounted three new operas by [[Friedrich von Flotow]], including ''Lady Melvil'' on 15 November 1838 (with some music also written by [[Albert Grisar]]&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Malcolm; Lindgren, Lowell. "Grisar, Albert" in Sadie (1992) '''2''': 546&amp;ndash;547.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sophie Anne Thillon]] as Lady Melvil&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. "Thillon [née Hunt], Sophie Anne" in Sadie (1992) '''4''': 725.&lt;/ref&gt;), ''L'eau merveilleuse'' on 30 January 1839, and ''Le naufrage de la Méduse'' on 31 May 1839;&lt;ref name=Levin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Peter. "Flotow, Friedrich (Adolph Ferdinand)" in Sadie (1992) '''2''': 242&amp;ndash;246.&lt;/ref&gt; and on 6 August 1839 the premiere of Donizetti's ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor#Lucie de Lammermoor|Lucie de Lammermoor]]'', a French version of his ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'', with Thillon as Lucia and Achille Ricciardi as Edgardo.&lt;ref&gt;Ashbrook, William. "''Lucia di Laamermoor''" in Sadie (1992) '''3''': 69&amp;ndash;72.&lt;/ref&gt; Joly's venture was short-lived however, closing on 16 May 1841.

==The Théâtre-Italien settles in==
[[File:Salle Ventadour interior 1843 NGOp871.jpg|thumb|270px|A performance by the Théâtre-Italien at the Salle Ventadour (ca. 1843).]]
After the Théâtre de la Renaissance closed in 1841 the theater was expanded to a capacity of 1,294&lt;ref name=Charlton/&gt; and was again used by the Théâtre-Italien company from 2 October 1841 to 28 June 1878.&lt;ref name=Levin/&gt; During this time the company presented the premiere of Donizetti's ''[[Don Pasquale]]'' (3 January 1843) and the Paris premieres of 15 of Verdi's operas, including ''[[Nabucco]]'' (1845),&lt;ref name=Charlton/&gt; ''[[Ernani]]'' (1846, as ''Il Proscritto''),&lt;ref&gt;Budden, Julian (1973). ''The operas of Verdi: from Oberto to Rigoletto'', p.  146. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-520030-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Il trovatore]]'' (23 December 1854), ''[[La traviata]]'' (6 December 1856), ''[[Rigoletto]]'' (19 January 1857), ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]'' (13 January 1861),&lt;ref name=Simeone/&gt; and ''[[Aida]]'' (22 April 1876) with Verdi conducting.&lt;ref&gt;Busch, Hans, ed. and translator (1978). ''Verdi's Aida: the history of an opera in letters and documents'', p.  395n. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8166-0798-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the important singers appearing in Verdi's operas were [[Giorgio Ronconi]], [[Adelaide Borghi-Mamo]], and [[Gaetano Fraschini]].&lt;ref name=Charlton/&gt; Verdi is reported to have referred to the Salle Ventadour as his favorite opera house in Paris.&lt;ref name=Simeone/&gt;&lt;ref name=Charlton/&gt;

Besides opera, the Salle Ventadour was also sometimes used for concerts. [[Stabat Mater (Rossini)|Giaocchino Rossini's ''Stabat Mater'']] received its premiere there on 7 January 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Rossini, Gioacchino; Tomlleri, Luciano, editor (1957). ''Stabat Mater per due soprani, tenore, basso, coro ed orchestra''. Mainz: Eulenberg. {{OCLC|632707761}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Wagner]] conducted three concerts devoted to his own music, including extracts from ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]'', ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]'', ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', and ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'', on 25 January, 1 and 8 February 1860.&lt;ref name=Simeone/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Richard (1860). ''Concert de Richard Wagner'' [25 janvier, 1er et 8 février 1860, salle Ventadour]. ''Dans l'impossibilité de faire entendre en entier ses opéras'' [Le Vaisseau-fantôme, Tannhaeuser, Tristan et Isolde, Lohengrin]'', l'auteur se permet d'offrir au public quelques lignes d'explication qui lui feront mieux comprendre le sens des morceaux détachés qu'il lui soumet aujourd'hui.'' Paris: Aubusson et Kugelmann. {{OCLC|458820627}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Verdi conducted the Paris premiere of his ''[[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]]'' on 30 May 1876.&lt;ref name=Chouquet/&gt;

The Théâtre-Italien shared the theater briefly, from 26 June to 4 July 1853, with the Opéra-Comique,&lt;ref&gt;Wild and Charlton (2005), p.  85.&lt;/ref&gt; and from 16 March 1868 to 5 May 1868 the theater was shared with a new company directed by [[Léon Carvalho]], which was an extension of his [[Théâtre Lyrique]] on the Place du Châtelet. The name [[Théâtre de la Renaissance]] was revived for the use of Carvalho's venture, in order to distinguish it from the Théâtre-Italien. Carvalho had overextended himself, however, and soon went bankrupt.&lt;ref name=Levin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walsh 1981, pp. 235–238.&lt;/ref&gt; The Théâtre-Italien also shared the theater with the [[Paris Opéra]] from 19 January to December 1874 (in the period after the Opéra's [[Salle Le Peletier]] burned down on 28 October 1873 and before the opening of the Opéra's new [[Palais Garnier]] on 5 January 1875).&lt;ref&gt;Langham Smith, Richard. "Paris. 5. 1870&amp;ndash;1902." in Sadie (1992) '''3''': 874.&lt;/ref&gt; Companies sharing the theatre usually performed on alternate nights.&lt;ref&gt;Apthorp, William F. (1892). "Paris theatres and concerts. II. The Opéra, the Opéra-Comique, and the Conservatoire." ''Scribner's Magazine'' '''11''': 350&amp;ndash;365.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the instigation of the French tenor [[Victor Capoul]] the first professional public performance of the opera ''Les amants de Vérone'' with text and music by the {{Ill|Paul, Marquis d'Ivry|lt=marquis d'Ivry|fr|Paul de Richard d'Ivry}} was mounted at the Salle Ventadour on 12 October 1878. The libretto follows Shakespeare's ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' more closely than that of the [[Roméo et Juliette|opera by Gounod]], but the marquis d'Ivry's opera suffered in comparison. Capoul sang Romeo, and the Belgian soprano [[Marie Heilbronn]] sang Juliet. The same singers later appeared in a production at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] which was performed three times beginning on 24 May 1879. The text was considered "coarse", and the music received a lukewarm response.&lt;ref name=Chouquet/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Elizabeth. "Ivry, Paul Xavier Désiré, Marquis d' [Yrvid, Richard]" in Sadie (1992) '''2''': 862&amp;ndash;863.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Théâtre-Italien company went out of business in 1878, the Salle Ventadour was sold on 20 January 1879 and transformed into offices. The building has been primarily occupied by the [[Banque de France]] since 1893.&lt;ref name=Simeone/&gt; [[Gustave Chouquet]], writing in the 1900 edition of George Grove's ''Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', described the renovated building as follows: "its pediment, still decorated with statues of the Muses, now bears the words 'Banque d'escompte de Paris,' a truly exasperating sight".&lt;ref name=Chouquet/&gt;

'''Saṅghamittā''' ('''Saṅghamitrā''' in [[Sanskrit]]) was the eldest daughter of Emperor [[Ashoka]] (304 BC – 232 BC) and his first wife, [[Devi (Ashoka's wife)|Devi]]. Together with her brother [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Mahinda]], she entered an order of [[Buddhist monk]]s. The two siblings later went to [[Sri Lanka]] to spread the teachings of [[Buddha]] at the request of King [[Devanampiya Tissa of Sri Lanka|Devanampiya Tissa]] (250 BC – 210 BC) who was a contemporary of Ashoka. Ashoka was initially reluctant to send his daughter on an overseas mission. However, because of the insistence of Sangamitra herself, he finally agreed. She was sent to Sri Lanka together with several other nuns to start the nun-lineage of [[Bhikkhuni]]s (a fully ordained female [[Buddhist]] [[monastic]]) at the request of King Tissa to ordain queen Anulā and other women of Tissa's court at [[Anuradhapura]] who desired to be ordained as nuns after Mahindra converted them to [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=Sangha&gt;{{cite web|url=http://What-Buddha-Said.net/library/DPPN/sa/sanghamitta_theri.htm|title= Sanghamittā Therī|accessdate=2010-04-28|publisher= What the Buddha said in plain English!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thailand&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thaibhikkhunis.org/eng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=21 |title=A brief history of Sanghamitta |accessdate=2010-05-02 |publisher=Bodhistav Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725205251/http://www.thaibhikkhunis.org/eng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=21 |archivedate=25 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=more&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:e0KJ_d4Xa9UJ:dhammatimes.blogspot.com/2007/06/mahindagamanaya-was-more-than.html+Thera+Samanera+son+of+Sangamitta&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=in|title=Mahindagamanaya was more than a diplomatic mission|accessdate=2010-05-02|publisher=Daily Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sangamitta&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usamyanmar.net/Buddha/Article/The%20Theri%20Arahant%20Sanghamitta.pdf

After Sanghamittā’s contribution to the propagation of Buddhism in Sri Lanka and her establishing the ''Bikhhunī Sangha'' or ''Meheini Sasna'' (Order of Nuns) there, her name became synonymous with "Buddhist Female Monastic Order of Theravāda Buddhism" that was established not only in Sri Lanka but also in [[Burma]], [[China]] and [[Thailand]], in particular. The day the most revered tree, the [[Bodhi tree]], a sapling of which was brought by her to Sri Lanka and planted in [[Anuradhapura]], and which still survives, is also celebrated every year on the [[Full Moon]] day of December as "Uduvapa Poya" or "Uposatha Poya" and "Sanghamittā Day" by Theravāda Buddhists in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=Thailand/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sangamitta/&gt;&lt;ref name=festival&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://What-Buddha-Said.net/drops/III/Unduwap_Poya_Day.htm|title= How to be Real Buddhist through Observance?|accessdate=2010-05-02|publisher=What Buddha Said Net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Sanghamitra is known for the [[Proselytism|proselytisation]] activity among women that she pursued as her lifetime goal in Sri Lanka, along with her brother, Mahendra (called [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Mahinda]] in Sri Lanka) at the initiation of her father, Emperor Ashoka of the [[Maurya dynasty]] who ruled in India in the 3rd century BC.  Ashoka, after adopting Buddhism, took to spreading tenets of Buddhism in nine other countries of the region. His contemporary in Sri Lanka, King Devanampiya Tissa, in close alliance with Ashoka, saw the [[Anuradhapura Kingdom|arrival of Buddhism]] in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=more/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sangamitta/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harishchandra/&gt;

However, before deputing missions abroad in the region around India, Ashoka, in consultation with Venerable [[Moggaliputta Tissa]] convened a meeting of the [[Third Buddhist Council]] in which 1,000&amp;nbsp;[[Arahants]] participated. The purpose of this council meeting was not only to purge the Sangha of undesirable elements but also to take a view on the proselytisation of Buddhism in view of the strong challenge faced from the [[Brahmins]] of [[Hindu religion]]. Moggaliputta presided over the Council meeting where it was decided to send nine delegations to different regions to spread Buddhism.&lt;ref name=Sangamitta/&gt;

King Ashoka then sent out missionaries in nine different directions. The delegation that was sent south to Sri Lanka, at the request of Tissa, was led by Ashoka's son Mahendra. Before taking the long journey, Mahendra sought blessings of his mother. The delegation (considered a diplomatic mission) comprised six other Arhats, namely Ittiya, [[Uttiya]], [[Sambala]], Bhaddasala, young [[Samanera]] (nephew of Mahendra) and a Bhanduka (also a cousin of Mahendra). All members of the mission belonged to the royal family, indicating the importance Ashoka attached to spreading Buddhism in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=Thailand/&gt;&lt;ref name=more/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sangamitta/&gt;

This was also considered an opportune moment to spread Buddhism in Sri Lanka since Buddha himself had created awareness of his philosophy and precepts of Buddhism among the royalty and the common people during his three visits to Sri Lanka undertaken in the eight years following his enlightenment. Buddha, during his lifetime, had also created a social structure for the practice of [[Dhammavinaya]] or [[Dhamma]] (in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: [[Dharma]]), which comprised the Sangha – order of [[bhikkhus]] (monks) and [[bhikkuni]]s (nuns) to preserve his teachings for posterity.&lt;ref name=Sangamitta/&gt; However, it was only King Tissa, realising the poor status of the religion in his country, desired fresh efforts by a delegation from India.&lt;ref name=Thailand/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sangamitta/&gt;

Mahendra arrived with his delegation at Anuradhapura where King Tissa, accompanied by his sister-in-law (brother's wife) Princess Anula with her entourage of 500 women, met him at the Mahamegha Garden. The Mahendra mission was very successful in introducing Buddhism to Sri Lanka. He established the Bhikkhu Order for men. However, thousands of women, starting with Anula, who had converted to Buddhism along with the King Tissa, wished to be ordained into the Bhikkuni Order. Thera Mahindra expressed his inability to do so since this ordination had to be performed by a priestess or a Theri Arahat. He therefore advised the King to write to Emperor Ashoka and seek the services of his younger sister Theri Sangamitta, who was "profoundly learned", to be deputed to Sri Lanka for the purpose. He also desired that a sapling of the right branch of the Bodhi-Tree (where the [[Tathagata]] got his enlightenment) from [[Bodh Gaya]] should also be brought by her to Sri Lanka. King Tissa then chose his Minister Prince [[Arittha]] (his nephew) for the purpose since the minister had volunteered to go to India on the condition that on his return he would also be ordained into the Bhikkhu Sasana by Thera Mahindra. This was agreed.&lt;ref name=Sangamitta/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harishchandra/&gt;

==Early life==
Sangamitta's parents were the Emperor Ashoka and his first wife, Devi, who was a [[Buddhist]]. Her birth in 285 BC, as popularly known in published texts was as the second child of Ashoka and younger sister of brother [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Mahindra]]. She was born in [[Ujjain|Ujjeini]] (present day Ujjain in [[Madhya Pradesh]] in [[India]]). Her mother did not join Ashoka when he was crowned and her two children had embraced Buddhism. She was married at the age of 14 to [[Agribrahmi]], a nephew of Emperor Ashoka, who was also an Arhant. She had a son, Saamanera Sumana who also later became an Arhant and went along with his uncle Mahindra to Sri Lanka to preach Buddhism. Her teacher was [[Ayupala]]. She was ordained at the age of 18 into Theravada Buddhism Order by their preceptor [[Dhammapala]]. Her brother was also ordained at the same time. With her dedicated perseverance to Dhamma she became an Arhant Theri and resided in [[Pataliputra]] (now known as [[Patna]]).&lt;ref name=Thailand/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sangamitta/&gt;&lt;ref name=early&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://What-Buddha-Said.net/library/DPPN/sa/sanghamitta_theri.htm|title=Sangamitta Teri|accessdate=2010-05-02|publisher=What Buddha Said Net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Malalasekera&gt;{{Cite book|last=Malalasekera|first= G.P.|title= Dictionary of Pali Proper Names: Pali-English|page=990|accessdate=2010-05-02|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x8ObMQ1GGsUC&amp;pg=PA990&amp;dq=Sanghamitta#v=onepage&amp;q=Sanghamitta&amp;f=false|publisher= Asian Educational Services|year=2003|isbn=81-206-1823-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle life==
Mahindra’s mission in Sri Lanka was very successful. Among his new converts was Princess Anula, King Tissa’s sister-in-law who became [[Sotapanna]] and requested ordination. King Tissa wrote to Emperor Ashoka to depute Sangamitta for the purpose. Mahindra also wrote to his father to depute his sister Sanghamitta to Sri Lanka as requested by King Tissa.&lt;ref name=Sangamitta/&gt;

Following this invitation from the King and also the request made by his son Mahindra, Ashoka sent Sanghamitta with a retinue of 10 other learned bhikkunis (priestesses) to accompany her and to give ordination to the Sri Lanka's princess Anula and other women. Ashoka was initially distraught at the prospect of sending his daughter away but Sangamitta herself persisted that she would like to go to Sri Lanka. She appealed to her father stating:{{quotation|"Great King! the injunction of my brother is imperative and the females who are to be ordained in Lanka are many; on that account it is absolutely essential that I should go there.&lt;ref name=Harishchandra/&gt;}} The purpose was also to establish the Bhikkuni Order to spread Buddhism in that country with the devoted participation and assistance of women. Ashoka finally agreed to send her. She travelled to Sri Lanka by sea carrying a sapling of Bodhi-Tree in a golden vase. She landed at Jambukola in the North.&lt;ref name=Malalasekera/&gt; King Tissa himself received Sangamitta and the sapling of the Bodhi-Tree with deep veneration. They were then ceremonially escorted by the king and his people to Anuradhapura. They entered at the northern gate of Anuradhapura along a road sprinkled with white sand. The Bodhi sapling was planted with great fanfare in the Mahāmeghavana Grove in Aunradhapura. It is still seen at the same location.&lt;ref name=Thailand/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sangamitta/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harishchandra/&gt;

In Dipavamsa chronicle, the  number of nuns who accompanied Sangamitta has been mentioned differently – three figures have been quoted but the figure of 11 including Sangamitta is inferred as the plausible number. The names of the young nuns who accompanied here on the ship were: Uttara, Hema, Pasadpala, Aggimitta, Dasika, Pheggu, Pabbata, Matta, Malla, and Dhammadasiya.&lt;ref name=Law&gt;{{Cite book|last=Law|first=B.C|title= On the Chronicles of Ceylon|accessdate=2010-05-03|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3Cg9f6PygkC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Sanghamitta#v=onepage&amp;q=Sanghamitta&amp;f=false|publisher= Asian Educational Services|year=1994|isbn=81-206-0907-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the delegation headed by the Sri Lankan Ambassador Prince Athitha, which returned to Sri Lanka, comprised the Chief priestess Sangamitta and ten other priesteses, eight people of royal lineage of [[Magadha]] (Bogut, Sumitta, Sangot, Devgot, Damgot, Hirugot, Sisigot and Jutindhara), eight members of nobility (families of ministers), eight Brahmins, eight Vaishyas (traders), herdsmen, Hyaenna, Sparrow-hawk, Nagas, Yakkas, craftsmen, weavers, potters and many members of other castes.&lt;ref name=Sarkar&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sarkar|first= Jayanta|author2=G.

A legend mentioned related to the journey of Sangamitta to Sri Lanka is that [[Nāga|Nagas]] encircled the Bodhi tree. Sangamitta drove them away by assuming the form of [[Garuda]] (half-man half-bird form).&lt;ref name=Malalasekera/&gt; Sanghamitta was 32 years of age when she took this journey. Her son Samanera was already in Sri Lanka as he had joined his uncle Mahindra's mission to spread Buddhism.&lt;ref name=Thailand/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sangamitta/&gt; Sangamitta performed the formal ''[[Pabbajja]]'' ordination of Princess Anula. Anula was the first Sri Lankan woman to be ordained as a bhikkuni; concurrently her companions numbering more than 1000 who were also observing ''Dasa Sil'' were bestowed with ''Pabbajja'' ordination. This formally created the "first ecclesiastical life of the Bhikkuni Sasana in Sri Lanka".&lt;ref name=poya&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2008/12/full-moon-poya-day-of-unduvap-2552.html|title=Full Moon Poya Day of Unduvap|accessdate=2010-05-02|publisher=Sri Lanka Guardian|date=2008-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ordination covered not only the royalty but also common people of various strata of the society. She pursued every effort to enhance the status of woman, with sustained devotion, dedication and diligence.&lt;ref name=poya/&gt;

Sangamitta, on arrival at Anuradhapura, was put up initially at the ‘Upasika Viharaya’ along with the bhikkunis who had accompanied her. An additional 12 buildings ([[ashramas]]) were built to accommodate the bhikkunis. Subsequently, the King also built a separate house for Sangamitta known as 'Hathalakha-Vihara' acceding to the request of the nuns to reside in a secluded place where they could exclusively concentrate on devotional religious pursuits.&lt;ref name= Obeyesekere/&gt;

Dipavamsa, a chronicle written in 400 BC, records that after the Bhikkuni Sangha was established, there was widespread following in the country among women of all ages and from all levels of society. The women who ordained were highly learned in the scriptures and they readily taught their knowledge of the [[Vinaya]] or rules of discipline to others.&lt;ref name=women&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buddhismtoday.com/english/sociology/029-WomeninIndia.htm |title=Buddhist Women in India and Pre-Colonial Sri Lanka |author=Lorna DeWaraja |accessdate=2010-05-02 |publisher=Buddhism Today |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820023050/http://www.buddhismtoday.com/english/sociology/029-WomeninIndia.htm |archivedate=20 August 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Bodhi tree and celebrations
[[File:Photograph of Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi Anuradhapura Sri Lanka.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Revered Bodhi tree brought by Sangamitta and planted at [[Anuradhapura]], [[Sri Lanka]] -Oldest surviving [[Bodhi Tree]]]]
Sangamittā carried the right south branch of the Bodhi-Tree (selected by Ashoka from the Maha Bodhi-Tree in Gaya) on a ship to Anurādhapura, during the 12th year of Ashoka's reign. The sapling was planted by Devānāmpiya Tissa in the Mahāmeghavana in Anurdhapura. It seems that "the Buddha, on his death bed, had resolved five things, one being that the branch which should be taken to [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] should detach itself". The journey route followed by Sangamitta who carried the tree branch was from Gayā to Pātaliputta and then to Tāmalittī  in [[Bengal]]. Here, it was placed in a golden vase in the ship and transported to Jambukola across the sea. The entourage reached Anurādhapura, staying en route at Tivakka.&lt;ref name=Bodhi&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://What-Buddha-Said.net/library/DPPN/b/bodhirukka.htm|title=Bodhirukka|accessdate=2010-05-02|publisher=What Buddha Said Net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Relics&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/chap017.html|title= Chapter XVII: The Arrival Of The Relics|accessdate=2010-05-02|publisher=Lakdiva Org.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The planting of the Bodhi Tree was a grand ceremony performed by the king himself with assistance from the nobles of Kājaragāma, Candanagāma and Tivakka, in the presence of Sangamitta and her brother Mahindra. The tree took eight roots, yielded fruits and seeds. As fresh eight saplings emerged, they were moved and planted at Jambukola (present Colombogaon in north Sri Lanka), in the village of Tivakka, at Thūpārāmā, at Issaramanārāma, in the court of the Pathamacetiya, in Cetiyagiri, in Kājaragāma and in Candanagāma.&lt;ref name= Obeyesekere/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bodhi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Relics/&gt;

The tree, as it stands, is on raised mound. In 1907, it was {{convert|32|ft|m}} in height with {{convert|8.17|ft|m}} in girth. Th tree and the shrine have been built around a compound wall measuring {{convert|61|ft|m}} x {{convert|57|ft|m}} and {{convert|21|ft|m}} in height, primarily to protect the tree and the shrine built around it. Ten more trees of the same species are also seen within precincts of the enclosure. A damaged Buddha statue made in bricks (attributed its creation during Tissa's rule) is a marker to locate the main Bodhi-Tree here.&lt;ref name=Harishchandra/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bodhi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Relics/&gt; 32 more saplings, from four other fruits, were also planted in the near vicinity.&lt;ref name=Bodhi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Relics/&gt;

The Bodhi-Tree at Anuradhapura was well tended by successive royal family members of Sri Lanka over the centuries, so much so that a village near Anurādhapura was also earmarked to provide for maintenance of the tree.&lt;ref name=Bodhi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Relics/&gt;

A recent comment by Historian [[H. G. Wells]] on this oldest historical tree in the world, which is well maintained states:{{quotation|In Ceylon there grows to this day a tree, the oldest historical tree in the world, which we know certainly to have been planted as a cutting from the Bodhi-Tree in the year 245 BC. From that time to this it has been carefully tended and watered.&lt;ref name=Sangamitta/&gt;}}

==Later life==
Sangamitta died at the age of 79 in the ninth year of the reign of King [[Uttiya]] at her residence in Hatthaloka Upasikaramaya Anuradhapura. Uttiya performed her last rites. The occasion was also marked with observances in her honour throughout Sri Lanka, for one week.&lt;ref name=early/&gt; She was cremated to the east of the Thūpārāma near the Cittasālā, in front of the Bodhi-Tree. The location for the cremation had been selected by the Therī herself before her death. A stupa was erected by Uttiya over her ashes.&lt;ref name=early/&gt;&lt;ref name=poya/&gt;

==Bhikkhuni Sangha==
[[File:Venerabletzuchuang-cropped.JPG|right|thumb|A [[bhikkuni]] of the Chinese Mahayana tradition]]
The Bhikkhuni Sangha (a Dhamma-vinaya heritage started by Lord Buddha during his lifetime in India), locally known as "Bikhhuni Sasana" or "Meheini Sasna" (Order of Priestesses or Nuns) that was established by Sangamitta in Sri Lanka prospered for over 1000 years, till it disappeared in 1017 AD. The reason for such an end is attributed to the invasion of [[Chola]]s, [[Hindu]] rulers from [[South India]], whereafter Bhikkhus and Bhikkunis were not seen in Sri Lanka for quite some years.&lt;ref name=Thailand/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sangamitta/&gt;

Bhikkuni ordination is the third and ultimate stage of ordination of nuns; the earlier two stages are the ''sramanerika'' (novice) and ''siksamana'' (probationary). In India, the Bhikkuni Order was established by Buddha six years after the Bhikkhu Order was established, in the 6th century BC. It was spread to Sri Lanka by Sangamitta in the 3rd BC. Initially, with spread of Buddhism in ancient India, 18 (eighteen) Vinaya schools developed. However, now only three are extant. These are the Theravada practiced in Sri Lanka and [[Southeast Asia]]; the [[Dharmaguptaka]] that is practiced in [[Taiwan]], China, [[Korea]], and [[Vietnam]]; and the third school is the [[Mulasarvastivada]] adopted in [[Tibet]].&lt;ref name=Chodron&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.congress-on-buddhist-women.org/index.php?id=30|title=A New Possibility: Introducing Full Ordination for Women into the Tibetan Buddhist Tradition|author=Bhikshuni Thubten Chodron|accessdate=2010-05-03|publisher=International Congress on Buddhist Women’s Role in the Sangha Bhikshuni Vinaya and Ordination Lineages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 429 AD, Bhikkuni Devasara had realised that Bhikkuni Sanga, on account of war and famine, could vanish from Sri Lanka. She, therefore, had led a mission to China to establish the Bhikkuni Sasana. The original Theravada Bhikkuni lineage established in China since 429 AD has continued to function to this day.&lt;ref name=Thailand/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sangamitta/&gt; However, [[Asarana Sarana Saranankara Maha Thera]] re-introduced the Higher Ordination from Thailand. He is credited with re-establishing the Order of Monks in Sri Lanka in 1753 AD. It is now said that there are more than 400 Bhikkunis in the country.&lt;ref name=Sangamitta/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chodron/&gt;

In Thailand, the lineage is well established. A clay statue of Sanghamitta made by Dhammananda in 2002, is deified in a shrine room at Songdhammakalyani Monastery in Nakhonpathom. Her image is flanked by images of 13 Arahat Theris.&lt;ref name=Thailand/&gt;

It is also reported that a few women from western countries practising the Theravada tradition and a few women from Thailand have been ordained to bhikkuni order in Sri Lanka in recent years.&lt;ref name=Chodron/&gt;

==Uduvapa Poya festival==
Unduvapa Poya festival is observed in Sri Lanka on the Full Moon of December to commemorate two specific events namely, Theri Sangamitta day of arrival from India to establish the Order of Nuns and to also mark her bringing a sapling of the sacred Bodhi-Tree from Bodh Gaya and planting it in Aunradhapura. The festival day has been designated as "Sanghamitta Day". On this day, ten ordained nuns initiate the festive celebrations every year.&lt;ref name=Sangamitta/&gt;&lt;ref name=festival/&gt; This observance was revived in 1903 at the suggestion of the Mahabodhi Society of Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=Harishchandra/&gt;

This Observance is performed by Buddhists by first following the 'Five Precepts'; bathing, shaving, wearing white robes, and kneeling with clean bare feet in a shrine before a Buddha-statue. The kneeling and bowing is done first three times with feet, hands, elbows, knees and head touching the floor. This is followed by reciting loudly the memorised prayers, with folded hands (palms at the heart). The prayers offered from sunrise until the next dawn starting with the words are: {{quotation|As long as this life lasts.&lt;br /&gt;
I hereby take refuge in the Buddha.&lt;br /&gt;  
I hereby take refuge in the Dhamma.&lt;br /&gt;
I hereby take refuge in the Sangha.&lt;br /&gt; 
I hereby seek shelter in the Buddha for the 2nd time.&lt;br /&gt;
I hereby seek shelter in the Dhamma for the 2nd time.&lt;br /&gt;
I hereby seek shelter in the Sangha for the 2nd time.&lt;br /&gt;
I hereby request protection from the Buddha for the 3rd time.&lt;br /&gt;
I hereby request protection from the Dhamma for the 3rd time.&lt;br /&gt;
I hereby request protection from the Sangha for the 3rd time.&lt;br /&gt;
I will hereby respect these Three Jewels the rest of my life! &lt;br /&gt;
I accept to respect &amp; undertake these 5 training rules: &lt;br /&gt; 
I hereby accept the training rule of avoiding all Killing.&lt;br /&gt;
I hereby accept the training rule of avoiding all Stealing.&lt;br /&gt;
I hereby accept the training rule of avoiding all Sexual Abuse.&lt;br /&gt;
I hereby accept the training rule of avoiding all Dishonesty.&lt;br /&gt;
I hereby accept the training rule of avoiding all Alcohol &amp; Drugs.&lt;br /&gt;
As long as this life lasts, I am thus protected by these 5 precepts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ref name=festival/&gt;}}

It is also a prayer offered on this day for the revival of Bhikkuni Sasana in Sri Lanka and with the hope that it will flourish in the future. It is proposed that the day should also be celebrated as the [[International Women’s Day]], as a mark of honour to Sangamitta who established the women's Order.&lt;ref name=Sangamitta/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3282">The '''Shōchō uprising''' ({{lang|ja|正長の土一揆}} {{transl|ja|Shōchō no Do Ikki}} or {{transl|ja|Shōchō no Tsuchi Ikki}}) was one of the many armed rebellions in Japan during the [[Muromachi Period]] and the first launched by the peasants. It occurred between August and September of the year 1428, which in the old Japanese calendar was the 1st year of [[Shōchō]], and is also known as the ''Shōchō no Tokusei Ikki'', the Shocho debt cancellation revolt.

As social anxiety increased as a result of the death of [[Ashikaga Yoshimochi]], of bad harvests due to poor weather since the last year, and of an epidemic of three-day disease (likely [[cholera]] &lt;ref&gt;Akira Nakamura, "中世の流行病「三日病(やみ)」についての検討", 日本医史学雑誌, 1987, 308–316.&lt;/ref&gt;), the [[bashaku]] of Otsu and Sakamoto in [[Ōmi Province]] demanded a debt moratorium.

This revolt spread and extended to all of [[Kinai]] as peasants throughout the region who were struggling to repay their debts undertook "independent debt relief" by attacking and looting sake merchants, storehouse money brokers, and temples. The grounds for the so-called "independent debt relief" is supposed to be "daigawari no tokusei", or debt relief at the time when power passes from one shōgun to another.

The shogunate was hard-pressed by this and set about quelling it under the orders of the [[kanrei]] Mitsuie Hatakeyama. The head of the ''[[samurai-dokoro]]'', Akamatsu Mitsusuke, also sent troops. However, the strength of the insurrection did not diminish but rather it even invaded Kyoto in September and also spread to [[Nara, Nara|Nara]].

The monk Jinson recorded the following entry about the uprising in the Daijoin nikki mokuroku, his daily journal. "The first year of Shocho, in the ninth month, an uprising of commoners broke out. They claimed debt relief and went on to destroy wine shops, pawn shops, and temples which engaged in usury. They took anything they could lay their hands on, and cancelled the debts. Kanrei Mitsuie Hatakeyama suppressed this. There is nothing more than this incident to bring about the ruin of our country. This is the first time since the founding of Japan that an uprising of commoners ever occurred."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Japan: a documentary history (Armonk, New York: ME Sharpe, 1996), 165, edited by David J. Lu.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, the Muromachi shogunate did not release a debt cancellation order, but because proof of the farmers' debts had been destroyed during the looting, the "independent debt relief" had effectively achieved the same situation. Furthermore, [[Kōfuku-ji]] in [[Yamato Province]] formally cancelled debts and because it had turned almost all the territory in the province into its own ''[[shōen]]'' and exercised power as its ''[[shugo]]'', these orders had official binding power and were implemented. An example of one such order is the Yagyū no Tokusei Hibun which was inscribed on a stone monument.

'''The BFGoodrich/Skip Barber National Presented by Mazda''' was an entry-level professional race series run by [[Skip Barber Racing School]]. Initially formed as the Formula Dodge National Championship, From 2006 to 2011 the Skip Barber National was the initial open-wheel race series in the MAZDASPEED Motorsports Development ladder, which includes the Cooper Tires [[U.S. F2000 National Championship]] and the [[Pro Mazda Championship]]. The Skip Barber National has run in support of the [[American Le Mans Series]], [[Grand-Am Road Racing|Grand-Am]] [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] and [[A1 Grand Prix|A1GP]] and is designed to give young drivers transitioning from [[Kart racing|karting]] to race cars their first experience of professional level road racing.

==History==

===Formula Dodge National Championship Presented by RACER===
The Skip Barber National was developed to fill the gap between the Skip Barber Regional Race Series and the [[Barber Pro Series|Barber Dodge Pro Series]]. The first season was in fact a one-race shootout for top drivers from the four Regional Race Series. Held at [[Lime Rock Park]] in Connecticut, the race (and championship) was won by [[2012 IndyCar Series season|2012]] [[Izod|IZOD]] [[IndyCar Series]] champion [[Ryan Hunter-Reay]].

For the first several years of its existence, the Skip Barber National schedule was made up of what were deemed to be the best tracks scheduled for each of the four Skip Barber Regional Race Series. The Skip Barber National was run as a separate run group within each race weekend, with a separate fleet of cars. The National made its professional support series debut at the 2003 [[12 Hours of Sebring]]. The Skip Barber National Champion during this era earned a $100,000 career enhancement award to help them pick up a ride in the next level of open-wheel racing.

===BFGoodrich/Skip Barber National Presented by Mazda===
When Mazda replaced Dodge as automotive partner with Skip Barber Racing School at the end of 2006, the Skip Barber National was renamed, with BFGoodrich taking over title sponsorship of the series. As part of this new partnership with Mazda, the Skip Barber National joined the MAZDASPEED Motorsports Development ladder, with the Skip Barber National Champion earning a fully funded season in the following year's Star Mazda Championship. The original ladder included the Skip Barber National, Star Mazda, and the [[Atlantic Championship]]. In 2010 this was changed with the replacement of the top of the ladder Atlantic Championship with the newly reformed U.S. F2000 Championship slotted between the Skip Barber National and the now top rung Star Mazda Championship. This overlaps with the [[Indy Racing League]]'s new [[Road to Indy]] development ladder that includes U.S. F2000, Star Mazda, and [[Indy Lights]].

====Championship format====
Drivers in the Skip Barber National earned points in 14 races, held over seven double-race weekends, with their worst single result dropped. Drivers also received a point for earning a pole position.

The Skip Barber Cup Championship was a separate class running with the BFGoodrich/Skip Barber National Presented by Mazda. Named in honor of company founder and former owner [[Skip Barber]], the Skip Barber Cup Championship was open to drivers aged 26 and older who would like to race against the younger drivers at the marquee events offered in the 2010 National schedule, but were not eligible for the MAZDASPEED Motorsports Development system. Skip Barber Cup drivers competed for a separate championship and prize fund.

==Karting Shootout==
Since 1998, every winter Skip Barber Racing School holds the Skip Barber Racing School Karting Scholarship Shootout, where karters gather to compete for scholarships for the upcoming season of racing, courtesy of MAZDASPEED Motorsports Development and FIA Motor Sport Safety Development Fund. Competitors learn everyday driving skills, attend media and motorsports seminars, practice interview skills and perform a series of sessions on track in Formula Skip Barber Race Cars. In the 2010 Shootout, the prizes consisted two scholarships for the entire 2011 race season of the BFGoodrich/Skip Barber National presented by Mazda, becoming MAZDASPEED Motorsports Development Scholarship Drivers. Other prizes typically include one half season in the Skip Barber National, one full season and three half seasons in the Skip Barber Regional Race Series.

The final and complete withdrawal of [[40th Army (Soviet Union)|Soviet combatant forces]] from [[Republic of Afghanistan (1987-1992)|Afghanistan]] began on 15 May 1988 and ended on 15 February 1989 under the leadership of [[Colonel general|Colonel-General]] [[Boris Gromov]].

Planning for the withdrawal of the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) from the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Afghanistan War]] began soon after [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. Under the leadership of Gorbachev, the Soviet Union attempted to consolidate the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|PDPA]]'s hold over power in the country, first in a genuine effort to stabilize the country, and then as a measure to save face while withdrawing troops. During this period, the military and intelligence organizations of the USSR worked with the government of [[Mohammad Najibullah]] to improve relations between the government in [[Kabul]] and the leaders of [[Mujahideen#Afghanistan|rebel factions]].

The [[Soviet Union–United States relations|diplomatic relationship]] between the USSR and the [[United States]] improved at the same time as it became clear to the Soviet Union that this policy of consolidating power around Najibullah's government in Kabul would not produce sufficient results to maintain the power of the PDPA in the long run. The [[Geneva Accords (1988)|Geneva Accords]], signed by representatives of the USSR, the USA, the [[Islamic Republic of Pakistan]] and the Republic of Afghanistan (thus renamed in 1987) on 14 April 1988, provided a framework for the departure of Soviet forces, and established a multilateral understanding between the signatories regarding the future of international involvement in Afghanistan. The military withdrawal commenced soon after, with all Soviet forces leaving Afghanistan by 15 February 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ariananews.co/news/26-%D8%AF%D9%84%D9%88-%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B2-%D8%AE%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AC-%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AA%D8%B4-%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%AE-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%A7%D9%81.html/|title=The anniversary of the withdrawal of the Red Army from Afghanistan|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events leading up to military withdrawal ==
Understanding that the Soviet Union's troublesome economic and international situation was  complicated by its involvement in the Afghan War, Gorbachev "had decided to seek a withdrawal from Afghanistan and had won the support of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] to do so [by October 1985]".&lt;ref name="baker"&gt;{{Cite book|title=War in Afghanistan: A Short History of 80 Wars and Conflicts in Afghanistan and the Northwest Frontier 1839 to 2011|last=Baker|first=Kevin|publisher=Rosenberg Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781921719127|location=Kenthurst|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|193}}&lt;ref name="kalinovsky"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Long Goodbye: The Soviet Withdrawal from Afghanistan|last=Kalinovsky|first=Artemy M.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780674058668|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|74}} He later strengthened his support base at the top level of Soviet government further by expanding the Politburo with his allies.&lt;ref name="ch"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Out of Afghanistan: The Inside Story of the Soviet Withdrawal|last=Cordovez|first=Diego|last2=Harrison|first2=Selig S.|publisher=Oxford University Press (US)|year=1995|isbn=9780195062946|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|248}} To fulfill domestic and foreign expectations, Gorbachev aimed to withdraw having achieved some degree of success. At home, Gorbachev was forced to satisfy the hawkish military-industrial complex, military leadership, and intelligence agencies&lt;ref name="ewans"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conflict in Afghanistan: Studies in Asymetric Warfare (1)|last=Ewans|first=Martin|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=9780415341608|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|119}} (later, Gorbachev would tell UN Envoy [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/30/world/americas/diego-cordovez-envoy-and-conflict-mediator-dies-at-78.html?_r=0 Diego Cordovez] that the impact of the war lobby should not be overestimated; Cordovez recalls that Gorbachev's advisors were not unanimous in this pronouncement, but all agreed that disagreements with the US, Pakistan, and realities in Kabul played a bigger role in delaying withdrawal).&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;{{rp|245}} Abroad, Gorbachev aimed to retain prestige in the eyes of [[Third World|third-world]] allies. He, like Soviet leaders before him, considered only a dignified withdrawal to be acceptable.&lt;ref name="ewans"/&gt;{{rp|117}} This necessitated the creation of stability within Afghanistan, which the Soviet Union would attempt to accomplish until its eventual withdrawal in 1988-9.&lt;ref name=kalinovsky/&gt;{{rp|75}}&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;{{rp|208}} Three objectives were viewed by Gorbachev as conditions needed for withdrawal: internal stability, limited foreign intervention, and international recognition of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan's Communist government.&lt;ref name=kalinovsky/&gt;{{rp|93}}

=== Policy of National Reconciliation ===
After the death of [[Leonid Brezhnev]], the political will for Soviet involvement in Afghanistan dwindled. The level of Soviet forces in the country was not adequate to achieve exhaustive military victory, and could only prevent the allied DRA from losing ground.&lt;ref name="barfield"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Afghanistan: A Cultural and Political History|last=Barfield|first=Thomas|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780691154411|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|238}} The Soviet Union began the gradual process of withdrawal from Afghanistan by instating Muhammed Najibullah Ahmadzai as the General Secretary of the Afghan Communist Party, seeing him to be capable of ruling without serious involvement from the Soviet Union. [[Babrak Karmal]], Najibullah's predecessor, was deemed by the Soviet leadership to be an obstacle to both military withdrawal and the diplomatic process.&lt;ref name=ewans/&gt;{{rp|120}} Although Soviet military, diplomatic and intelligence agencies were not singleminded about his appointment, Najibullah was seen as a leader that could work with the Soviet Union in order to find a negotiated settlement.&lt;ref name=barfield/&gt;{{rp|238}}&lt;ref name=ewans/&gt;{{rp|121}} Mirroring shifts within the USSR itself, the Soviet effort in Afghanistan placed "a much greater emphasis on pacification through winning over rebel commanders" rather than transforming "Afghanistan along [[Marxism|Marxist]] lines [,] winning over the population through economic incentives and establishing a party and government influence in the cities and countryside".&lt;ref name=kalinovsky/&gt;{{rp|100}} As a whole, the policies the Soviet Union and their allies powers in Afghanistan pursued after the transition of power from Babrak to Najibullah were referred to as the Policy of National Reconciliation

To achieve reconciliation, the Soviet Union dedicated a serious effort to helping the Najibullah government establish relations with rebel factions, sent record packages of aid, and promised that "absolutely all of the military infrastructure would be handed over to the DRA armed forces" upon Soviet withdrawal.&lt;ref name=kalinovsky/&gt;{{rp|101}} Najibullah achieved considerable success in reinvigorating the government security apparatus, and consolidating his power within the state. This, however, may have encouraged the Soviets to place excessive trust in Najibullah, and did not achieve the primary objective: meaningfully incorporating the opposition into Najibullah's support base. Kalinovsky writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Vadim Kirpichenko]], deputy chief of the KGB First Directorate, later wrote that Najibullah's success in establishing more control within Kabul and some sectors of the government led them to believe that they had found a solution that could be replicated everywhere in Afghanistan: "Faith in Najibullah and in the dependability of his security organs created illusions on the part of the KGB leadership. . . . These dangerous illusions, the unwillingness to look truth in the face, delayed the withdrawal of Soviet troops by several years." (99)&lt;ref name=kalinovsky/&gt;{{rp|99}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Soviet-led attempts to encourage reconciliation were also complicated by mid-level military commanders, both Soviet and Afghan. While the military and political leadership of the USSR worked with the Najibullah government on raising the level of cooperation with rebel and tribal leaders, Soviet "mid-ranking officers sometimes failed to grasp the political significance of their operations" and the Afghan army had to be convinced "to stop calling the opposition "a band of killers," "mercenaries of imperialism," "skull-bashers,"'.&lt;ref name=kalinovsky/&gt;{{rp|103–104}} Nevertheless, some progress was achieved by Soviet intelligence agencies, military and diplomats in improving relations with rebel factions. The canonical example is the establishment of tentative collaboration with noted rebel commander and Afghan National Hero (posthumously) [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]]. Here too, however, relations were complicated by mid-level military realities, and even by Najibullah himself. Although the Soviet military leadership and diplomats had been in contact with Massoud since the early 80's, military operations against his troops, the DRA's insistence on his disarmament, and information leaks about his relations with the Soviets derailed progress towards achieving a formal ceasefire with him.&lt;ref name=kalinovsky/&gt;{{rp|107, 104}} Conversely, Najibullah was in ostensibly regular contact with unnamed rebel leaders "through certain channels", as Cordovez found out during his first meeting with the Afghan leader.&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;{{rp|239}}

=== Political reform and Soviet disenchantment ===
Political reforms were enacted by the DRA government and their Soviet allies as part of the Policy of National Reconciliation. Generally, these reforms can be characterised as seeking to allow rebel factions to align with the government and state order in Afghanistan by stripping it of its Marxist-revolutionary agenda. Throughout 1987 the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan was renamed the Republic of Afghanistan, participation of all political parties in government was permitted conditional on their non-violence towards each other, and Afghanistan's Islamic identity was reassumed.&lt;ref name=kalinovsky/&gt;{{rp|105}} These political reforms were met by scepticism from rebel leaders and PDPA members alike, and were generally unproductive. Cordovez and Harrison write:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Najibullah's policy of "national reconciliation" went just far enough to antagonize hard-liners in the PDPA but not far enough to win over significant local tribal and ethnic leaders to support of his government.&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;{{rp|252}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within the ruling party, the Policy of National Reconciliation was criticised by those who believed it would result in the PDPA losing power over the country, while the opponents of the PDPA and the Soviet Union dismissed the efforts as propaganda. Hampered by the slow pace at which top-level policy decisions were implemented on the ground, and realising that the Policy of National Reconciliation by itself would not result in a favourable outcome, the Soviet leadership began looking for alternate ways to create the necessary degree of stability in Afghanistan for a withdrawal to be permissible.

Beginning in early 1987, Soviet faith in the Policy of National Reconciliation in the format in which it was initially conceived began to falter. While previously the preeminence of the PDPA in leadership, and the desired identity of Najibullah as the party leader was indisputable for the Soviet leadership, now the "emerging consensus in the Politburo was that the PDPA would be but one of the political forces in power after Soviet troops left. Even [[Vladimir Kryuchkov|Kryuchkov]] and [[Andrei Gromyko|Gromyko]] agreed that reconciliation would mean accepting that the PDPA would lose its leading position".&lt;ref name="kalinovsky" /&gt;{{rp|116}} In a personal meeting on the July 20, 1987, Gorbachev again attempted to impress on Najibullah the need to incorporate opposition leaders into the Afghan government, but this effort, like earlier, was weakened by Najibullah's biliateral conversations with [[Eduard Shevardnadze|Shevarnadze]] and Kryuchkov.&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;{{rp|251}} Najubullah retained a strong hold over Kabul and the government apparatus&lt;ref name="kalinovsky"/&gt;{{rp|117}} – bar internal divisions within the PDPA – but was not able to incorporate the opposition into the government in any meaningful way, instead giving out "relatively powerless posts to prominent non-PDPA personalities who had until then neither supported nor opposed the government."&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;{{rp|252}}

=== Negotiations about non-interference of foreign actors ===
Faced by the failure of the Policy of National Reconciliation to stabilise the country by itself, and hoping to benefit from the gradually thawing relationship with the United States, the Soviet Union pushed forward with its effort to attain a diplomatic solution that would limit Pakistani and American interference in Afghanistan. Throughout 1987, Soviet diplomats attempted to convince the United States to stop supplying the [[mujahideen]] with weaponry as soon as Soviet forces withdrew, and to reach an agreement on a power-sharing proposal that would permit the PDPA to remain a key actor in Afghan politics.&lt;ref name=kalinovsky/&gt;{{rp|128}} Najibullah was receptive to the prior, but the Soviet Union did not manage to come to this agreement with the United States. From statements made by [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[George P. Shultz|Shultz]], the Soviet leadership came under the impression that the US would cease military shipments to the mujahideen immediately after Soviet withdrawal, with the condition that the USSR "front-loaded" its withdrawal (i.e. withdrew the majority of its troops in the beginning of the process, thereby complicating redeployment).&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;{{rp|261}} This was conveyed to the Najibullah government, managing to convince him that the Soviet-American diplomatic effort would benefit the Kabul government.

This impression made by Shultz was false – though mixed signals were sent by various US officials at and around time of the summit, Reagan could not agree to stop arms shipments immediately .&lt;ref name="kalinovsky" /&gt;{{rp|132}} In late 1987, when this US commitment was conveyed to the Soviet Union, negotiations came to a halt, but proceeded tentatively as the [[White House]] and [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] continued to make contradictory statements on the issue. The issue dissipated when the Department of State suggested that an immediate cessation of US military aid could occur if the Soviets did the same (prior, the US had agreed to an asymmetric cessation of aid, whereby the USSR would be allowed to continue supporting Kabul).&lt;ref name="ch" /&gt;{{rp|263}} On February 8, 1988, the Soviet leadership to announce a conditional date for the beginning of the military withdrawal (which the United States had insisted on for years) in an attempt to encourage the US to compromise on ceasing military shipments.&lt;ref name="kalinovsky" /&gt;{{rp|137}} This announcement failed to change the American position on shipments, and simultaneously decreased Soviet bargaining power at the negotiations.&lt;ref name="ch" /&gt;{{rp|265}} Nevertheless, Gorbachev decided that 

&lt;blockquote&gt;it was desirable to withdraw within the framework of an international agreement, however flawed, rather than to proceed independently. "We weren't thinking only of Afghanistan," recalled [[Vadim Zagladin]]. "There were many processes taking place at that time. The [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|INF]] agreement on missiles in Europe was particularly important, and all of these things were interconnected."&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;{{rp|265}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This factor complicated convincing Najibullah to agree to the Geneva Accords, but he was eventually placated by Soviet promises to dramatically expand aid and assistance measures post-withdrawal.&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;{{rp|265}} Although the USA was not bound under the Geneva Accords to cease its military aid, Pakistan (through which this aid flowed) was obligated to prevent cross-border armament flows to Afghanistan (Kalinovsky 149). On April 14, 1988 the Geneva Accords were signed between Pakistan and Afghanistan, with the USSR and US acting as guarantors, stating provisions for the withdrawal of Soviet forces and mutual non-interference between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

==Process of military withdrawal==
The withdrawal of Soviet military forces began on May 15, 1988, under the leadership of [[General of the army (Russia)|General of the Army]] [[Valentin Varennikov]] (with General Gromov commanding the 40th Army directly).&lt;ref name="ch" /&gt;{{rp|368}} As agreed, the withdrawal was "front-loaded", with half of the Soviet force leaving by August. The withdrawal was complicated, however, by the rapid deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan. While the US was not bound to stop arms shipments, and continued to supply the mujahideen in Pakistan, Pakistan did not deliver on its commitment to prevent weaponry and troops from flowing into Afghanistan. The mujahideen also continued their attacks on withdrawing Soviet forces.&lt;ref name="kalinovsky" /&gt;{{rp|150}} The Soviet Union repeatedly reported these violations of the Geneva Accords to UN monitoring bodies, and even pleaded with the US to influence the factions they supplied. The desire of the Soviet Union to withdraw, however, coupled with the United States' inability to control the behaviour of the mujahideen, meant that the Soviet objections did not bring any results. The following conversation between a Soviet diplomat and the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] Islamabad [[station chief]] (as told by the latter in a book he co-authored), is cited by Kalinovsky: 

{{quote|Botshan-Kharchenko: You must understand, Mr. ''Buurdon'', that these attacks against our troops as they withdraw must stop.

Bearden: And if they don't?

Botshan-Kharchenko: Then perhaps we will halt our withdrawal. Then what will you do?

Bearden: It is not what I will do, Counselor; it is what the Afghans will do. And I think they will simply keep on fighting and killing your soldiers until you finally just go home.

Botshan-Kharchenko: But you have some control over such matters.

Bearden: No one has control over such matters, Counselor, except the Soviet Union.

Botshan-Kharchenko: Mr. ''Buurdon'', you must still understand that there will be consequences if these attacks continue.

Bearden: I am sure there will be, Counselor.&lt;ref name="kalinovsky" /&gt;{{rp|153}} &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB|last=Bearden|first=Milton|last2=Risen|first2=James|publisher=Presidio|year=2003|isbn=|location=Novato|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|354}}}}

As the Soviet withdrawal and rebel attacks continued, the deteriorating security of the Najibullah government caused policy disagreements between the different services of the Soviet Union. For example: while the Soviet military had succeeded in establishing a de facto cease-fire with Ahmad Shah Massoud's forces as Soviet troops withdrew through territories under his control, the KGB and Shevarnadze attempted to convince Gorbachev that an attack on Massoud was necessary to guarantee Najibullah's survival. In the words of Soviet military commanders, Najibullah himself also aimed to retain the Soviet military in Afghanistan – Generals Varennikov (in charge of the withdrawal operation), Gromov (commander of the 40th Army), and Sotskov (chief Soviet military advisor in Afghanistan) all pleaded with top Soviet military and political leadership to control Najibullah's attempts to use Soviet troops to achieve his own security, and to convey to him that the Soviet military would not stay in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="kalinovsky" /&gt;{{rp|161}} After the departure of Yakovlev from the Politburo in the fall of 1988, Gorbachev adopted the Shevarnadze-KGB line of policy regarding supporting Najibullah at the cost of antagonising rebel factions, and a halt of the withdrawal was ordered on November 5, 1988.&lt;ref name="kalinovsky" /&gt;{{rp|167}} In December, Gorbachev decided to resume the withdrawal, but also to carry out an operation against Massoud, ignoring arguments from his advisors and military commanders on the ground. In January 1989, the Soviet withdrawal continued, and on January 23 Operation Typhoon began against the forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud.&lt;ref name="kalinovsky" /&gt;{{rp|170}}Up until the end of the military withdrawal, Shevarnadze and the head of the KGB unsuccessfully attempted to convince Gorbachev to retain a contingent of Soviet military volunteers in Afghanistan to defend land routes to Kabul. On February 15, the 40th Army finished their withdrawal from Afghanistan. General Gromov walked across the "Bridge of Friendship" between Afghanistan and the USSR last. When Gromov was met by Soviet TV crews while crossing the bridge, he swore at them profusely when they tried to interview him. Recalling the events in an interview with a Russian newspaper in 2014, Gromov said that his words were directed at "the leadership of the country, at those who start wars while others have to clean up the mess."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mk.ru/social/interview/2014/02/13/984698-glavnyiyvyivod-borisa-gromova.html|title=Главный вывод Бориса Громова|last=Абрамов|first=Юрий|date=February 14, 2014|website=MK.ru|language=Russian|access-date=May 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Soviet support for the Najibullah government did not end with the withdrawal of the regular troops. Aid totalling several billion dollars was sent by the Soviet Union to Afghanistan, including military aircraft ([[Mikoyan MiG-27|MiG-27]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s) and [[Scud]] missiles.&lt;ref name="ewans"/&gt;{{rp|123}} Due primarily to this aid, the Najibullah government held onto power for much longer than the CIA and State Department expected. The mujahideen made considerable advances following the withdrawal of the Soviet contingent, and were even able to take and control several cities; nevertheless, they failed to unseat Najibullah until the spring of 1992.&lt;ref name="ewans"/&gt;{{rp|124}} Following the coup of August 1991, the Soviet Union (and later the Russian Federation under [[Boris Yeltsin]]) cut aid to their Afghan allies. This had a severe impact on the Hizb-i Watan (formerly known as the PDPA), and on the armed forces, already weakened by their fight against the mujahideen and internal struggles – following an abortive coup attempt in March 1990, the Army (already encountering a critical lack of resources and critical rates of desertion) was purged. Ultimately, the cessation of Soviet aid and the instability that it caused allowed to the mujahideen to storm Kabul.&lt;ref name=barfield/&gt;{{rp|248}} &lt;ref&gt;Marshall, A.(2006); ''Phased Withdrawal, Conflict Resolution and State Reconstruction''; Conflict research Studies Centre; {{ISBN|1-905058-74-8}} {{cite web|url=http://www.defac.ac.uk/colleges/csrc/document-listings/ca/06%2829%29AM.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201033319/http://www.defac.ac.uk/colleges/csrc/document-listings/ca/06%2829%29AM.pdf |archivedate=2007-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}  Najibullah was removed from power by his own party, after which the mujahideen futilely attempted to form a stable coalition government.&lt;ref name=barfield/&gt;{{rp|251}} Disagreements and infighting between the likes of Massoud and Hekmatyar set the stage for the eventual rise of the [[Taliban]].

'''TORC: The Off-Road Championship''' (TORC) is an [[United States|American]] national short course [[off-road racing]] series. It tours throughout the United States featuring professional four and two-wheel-drive [[Trophy Truck]]s along with a Pro Light class. TORC was founded by off-road racing driver [[Ricky Johnson]] in 2009. It was known as the '''Traxxas TORC Series''', owing to title sponsor [[Traxxas]], from 2009–2013. It was purchased by The Armory in August 2013.&lt;ref name="The Armory New Owner Announcement"&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Allison|title=The Armory Acquires Off-Road Racing Series TORC|url=http://torcseries.com/the-armory-acquires-off-road-racing-series-torc-the-off-road-championship-usac-remains-sanctioning-body/|accessdate=November 23, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112083422/http://torcseries.com/the-armory-acquires-off-road-racing-series-torc-the-off-road-championship-usac-remains-sanctioning-body/|archivedate=November 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been sanctioned and officiated by the [[United States Auto Club]] (USAC) since its inception.&lt;ref name="WhoWon20090511"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whowon.com/sResults.asp?SanctionID=257&amp;StoryID=269572|title=TRAXXAS TORC Series Hosts Season Opener at Texas Motor Speedway Dirt Track|date=2009-05-11|publisher=WhoWon.com|accessdate=2009-07-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928221629/http://www.whowon.com/sResults.asp?SanctionID=257&amp;StoryID=269572|archivedate=2011-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TORCNewDirection"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torcseries.com/news10009.php|title=TRAXXAS Off Road Championship Under New Direction|date=March 12, 2010|publisher=Traxxas TORC Series|accessdate=2 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410072153/http://www.torcseries.com/news10009.php|archivedate=10 April 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A multi-year deal between TORC and [[NBC Sports]] was announced in 2014 where it was confirmed that NBC would carry not only the series' on-track events but its docu-reality series as well.&lt;ref name="TORC Series"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torcseries.com/torc-road-championship-reaches-multi-year-agreement-nbc-sports-race-broadcasts-behind-scenes-programming/|title=TORC Reaches Multi-Year Agreement with NBC Sports|date=2014-02-11|publisher=TORC Series|accessdate=2014-02-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310165525/http://torcseries.com/torc-road-championship-reaches-multi-year-agreement-nbc-sports-race-broadcasts-behind-scenes-programming/|archivedate=2014-03-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the series returned to [[Fox Sports]] in 2015.  Coverage of events for 2016 and 2017 was broadcast by BeIN Sports. In March, 2018, the series announced that it would hold no events in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tirebusiness.com/article/20180327/NEWS/180329947/lucas-oil-supports-off-road-series-to-replace-torc|title=Lucas Oil supports off-road series to replace TORC|last=|first=|date=2018-03-27|website=Tire Business|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.performanceracing.com/news/lucas-oil-fills-void-new-road-racing-platform|title=Lucas Oil Fills Void With New Off-Road Racing Platform|work=Lucas Oil Fills Void With New Off-Road Racing Platform {{!}} Performance Racing Industry|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The series was founded in time for the 2009 season by former [[motocross]] racer and [[Motorcycle Hall of Fame]] member [[Ricky Johnson (racer)|Ricky Johnson]] as the Traxxas TORC Series&lt;ref name="Offroad20090516" /&gt; after hosting an off-road racing event at his [[Perris Auto Speedway]] in 2008. There were two large sanctioning bodies in short course off-road racing for 2008: [[Championship Off-Road Racing|CORR]] and [[World Series of Off-Road Racing|WSORR]].&lt;ref name="Offroad20090516" /&gt; CORR had been sanctioning events on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and WSORR had sanctioned [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] events.&lt;ref name="Offroad20090516" /&gt; CORR closed before the end of the 2008 season and canceled its final two racing weekends.&lt;ref name="Offroad20090516" /&gt; TORC took over the sanctioning of most of the Midwest events.&lt;ref name="Offroad20090516" /&gt; 

USAC assumed complete management of the series starting in 2010.&lt;ref name="TORCNewDirection" /&gt; The Armory took over ownership of the series in late 2013 to handle all marketing and operations of the series.&lt;ref name="The Armory New Owner Announcement" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/8/prweb11076082.htm&lt;/ref&gt; USAC remained on board as the sanctioning body. One of The Armory's first acts was securing an exclusive 5-year agreement landing the series championship weekend at [[Crandon International Off-Road Raceway]] starting in 2014, ensuring no competing sanctions can race at the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crandon to Remain Exclusive Home to the TORC Series|url=http://torcseries.com/crandon-to-remain-exclusive-home-to-the-torc-series/|publisher=TORC: The Off-Road Championship|accessdate=November 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2015, Mountain Sports International took over managing the series.&lt;ref name=MSI2015&gt;{{cite web|title=New Schedule and Management Announced for 2016 TORC|url=http://www.torcseries.com/new-schedule-and-management-announced-for-2016-torc/|publisher=TORC: The Off-Road Championship|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSI immediately announced adding sportsman racing back under its sanction starting in 2016.&lt;ref name=MSI2015 /&gt;

It also has a two-wheel drive trophy truck class or PRO 2WD and a light-duty two-wheel drive [[pickup truck]] class or PRO Light.

The series began with a Sportsman truck division, consisting of four- and two-wheel drive truck classes plus a stock truck class. Sportsman buggies featured regular 70 horsepower buggies plus a light class with [[restrictor plate|restricted]] 55 horsepower engines.&lt;ref name="Divisions" /&gt; It had three grassroots classes all featuring stock vehicles. The Formula 4x4 trucks were stock 4x4 trucks or [[sport utility vehicles|SUVs]], Classix race cars were stock cars with modified suspensions, and the Enduro trucks were two wheel drive 3/4 ton pickup chassis.&lt;ref name="Divisions" /&gt; The Sportsman division later weren't sanctioned by TORC and a separate entity named called Midwest Off Road Racing (MORR). TORC restored the sportsman classes for the 2016 season after MSI took over its sanction.&lt;ref name=MSI2015 /&gt;

==Television coverage==

In 2009, PRO events were televised on national television in the United States with [[ESPN2]] covering the 2009 events at Texas, Crandon's spring event, both Bark River events, and the second Perris event.&lt;ref name="2009Schedule"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torcseries.com/|title=2009 Official schedule|publisher=Traxxas TORC Series|accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] televised the first 2009 event at Perris and it broadcast Crandon's World Championship Off-Road Races race live.&lt;ref name="2009Schedule" /&gt; [[Marty Reid]] was the lead play by play announcer along with Tes Sewell. Former [[Miss USA]] [[Kimberly Pressler]] was the pit reporter.&lt;ref name="ESPNABCPressRelease"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crandonoffroad.com/espn_and_traxxas_torc_truck_series_team-up_with.html|title=ESPN and Traxxas TORC Truck Series Team-Up with ABC Networks for Extreme Truck Racing Inaugural Season|date=2009-05-07|publisher=Official Press Release reprinted by [[Crandon International Off-Road Raceway]]|accessdate=2009-07-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617070453/http://www.crandonoffroad.com/espn_and_traxxas_torc_truck_series_team-up_with.html|archivedate=2009-06-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010 through 2012, ''The Off Road Championship'' aired on Discovery HD Theatre (now Velocity) and was produced by The Armory (www.thearmoryagency.com) with executive producer B.J. Birtwell. Season 1 consisted of twenty 1-hour episodes which aired from Sept 2010 to March 2011. Four seasons of the program have been produced. These shows featured a style which TORC refers to as docu-reality, the distinguishing feature of which consists of more talk and less live-style racing action coverage.

For 2013, Speed TV broadcast live coverage of the Saturday evening PRO truck events for all the race weekends, excepting the final September event at Primm which was scheduled for NBC. Speed covered two races live, which coverage was also reaired on Fuel.  NBC also broadcast one event. The Armory continued to produce TORC's Television programming in 2014 and 2015 on NBC Sports and Fox Sports, respectively. Bobby Gerould and National Sprint Car Hall of Famer Brady Doty were the broadcast host and PXP announcers while noted motorsports broadcaster Tony Bokhoven was the Pit Reporter.

[[File:IMiklos.JPG|upright|thumb|Minister of Finance [[Ivan Mikloš]] is widely regarded as the main architect of economic reforms.]]
"'''Tatra Tiger'''" is a [[nickname]] that refers to the [[economy of Slovakia]] in period 2002 &amp;ndash; 2007&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jn4Om5Zad44C&amp;pg=PA525&amp;dq=%22tatra+tiger%22&amp;hl=sk&amp;ei=zwepTtXPIuTk4QShyZwL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22tatra%20tiger%22&amp;f=false Jens Jungmann,Bernd Sagemann. 2011. p. 525]&lt;/ref&gt; and after 2010&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/eastern-approaches/2011/10/slovakia-and-euro-crisis The economist. Oct 12th 2011, 15:45 by K.M]&lt;/ref&gt; following the ascendance of a [[right-wing]] [[Coalition government|coalition]] in September 2002 which engaged in a program of [[economic liberalism|liberal economic]] reforms. The name "Tatra Tiger" derives from the local [[Tatra Mountains|Tatra mountain range]].

In 2004 and 2005, [[Slovakia]] had one of the highest [[gross domestic product]] growth rates in the [[European Union]] after some of the [[Baltic countries]], reaching 6%. In 2006, the year-over-year growth amounted to an unexpected 9.8% in the 3rd quarter, which helped to increase the overall annual economy growth expectation for 2006 from 6%-6.5% to 8.2%. This 9.8% growth (a low estimate) can be partly ascribed to the launch of production at a new [[PSA Peugeot Citroën|Peugeot SA]] plant. The growth came as a surprise to local analysts, given that another big foreign investor, [[Kia Motors|Kia]], launched its production in late 2006. In 4Q of 2007 the growth was 14.3%.

However, public polling shows that despite the resultant high growth rates, the public does not universally approve of the reforms, because they are associated with a drastic loss of the (previously high) government programs (reform of the previously government-run health system, complete reform of the pension system, etc.), the replacement of progressive taxation with a [[flat tax]], rapid changes of laws and other legal regulations, and rising property prices. Moreover, unemployment jumped to very high levels immediately after the reforms began in 1998, although it decreased back to its 1998 level in 2006 and even below later on.

In the first quarter of 2009 the fall of GDP was -5.7% but in the 2010 the GDP growth was a 4.8% for a first quarter.

These days Slovakia GDP still grows faster than the EU average, in period 2005-2011 the Slovakia GDP growth increased about 38.3% which is the highest growth between all EU countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do;jsessionid=9ea7974b30dd8549af6fd90a4215b5a4bd09638f55ac.e34SbxiPb3uSb40Lb34LaxqRb30Ne0?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsieb020 Epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu. 11 March 2011.

'''Vive Latino - Festival Iberoamericano de Cultura Musical''' is an annual music festival held in [[Mexico City]]. It is one of the most important music festivals in Mexico, featuring a great variety of groups of many genres.

The event takes place in [[Estadio Foro Sol|Foro Sol]] usually in between the months of March and April. The duration of the festival has been either one or two days, depending on the number of live acts, but since 2010 the festival's length is between 2 or 3 days. The first edition was in 1998, and has been repeated yearly ever since (except for 1999 and 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vivelatino.com.mx/info_festival/historia_del_festival_vive_latino/ |title=Esta pagina no se encuentra (404) - Vive Latino 2014 &amp;#124; Festival Iberoamericano de Cultura Musical |publisher=Vivelatino.com.mx |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of stages has changed over the time, ranging from 2 to 4.

The festival's concept is to every year gather important and newcoming bands from all over [[Ibero-America]] for three days to create a  space for alternative music and new proposals from different Spanish-speaking bands. In the history of the festival there's been a series of important musical performances by many arstists from Latin America and Spain, such as [[Café Tacuba]], [[Enrique Bunbury]], [[Charly Garcia]], [[Aterciopelados]], [[Los Tres]], [[Caifanes]], [[Bersuit]], [[El Cuarteto de Nos]], [[Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas]],  [[Los Planetas]], [[Gustavo Cerati]], [[Los Amigos Invisibles]], [[Babasónicos]], [[Miguel Ríos]], [[Celso Piña]], [[Los Jaigüey]], [[El Tri]], [[Los Ratones Paranoicos]], [[Nortec Collective]], [[Sepultura]], [[Divididos]], [[Transmetal (band)|Transmetal]], [[Ángeles del Infierno]], [[2 Minutos]], [[Control Machete]], [[Los Bunkers]], etc.

Besides Ibero-American musical acts, the festival has been opened for proposals from all over the world, with special appearances by Latin bands located in the [[United States|U.S.]] such as  [[Los Lobos]], [[Tito &amp; Tarantula]], [[Devendra Banhart]], [[Ill Niño]], [[Brujeria (band)|Brujeria]], [[The Mars Volta]], [[Los Straitjackets]], [[Rodrigo y Gabriela]], [[Ozomatli]], and [[Los Abandoned]]. The festival bill has also had non-Spanish speaking acts like [[The Magic Numbers]], [[Black Rebel Motorcycle Club]], [[The Chemical Brothers]], [[Urlaub in Polen]], [[Blasted Mechanism]], [[Calexico (band)|Calexico]], [[Jane's Addiction]], [[The National (band)|The National]], [[DeVotchKa]], [[Deftones]], and [[Marky Ramone]] among others.

Every year the festival's line up has a strong presence in the [[ska]] and [[reggae]] acts, having big figures of the genre such as [[The Wailers]], [[The Skatalites]], [[Desmond Dekker]], [[Fishbone]], [[Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra]], [[Steel Pulse]], [[Reel Big Fish]], and [[Save Ferris]], besides the performances from important ibero-American bands like [[Panteón Rococó]], [[Los Fabulosos Cadillacs]], [[Ska-P]], [[Los Autenticos Decadentes]], [[Desorden Público]], and [[Maldita Vecindad]].

As the festival itself is not limited to rock acts, it has often acts of entirely unrelated music genres. This, however, proved to be disastrous in the 2007 edition, which included a [[Reggaeton|Reggaetón]] act by [[Calle 13 (band)|Calle 13]], that angered a big section of the public, which booed and even threw bottles and objects at the stage forcing the band to leave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shoutcastblog.com/2010/04/22/calle-13-return-to-vive-latino/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520062519/http://www.shoutcastblog.com/2010/04/22/calle-13-return-to-vive-latino/ |date=May 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1000000th beatle.jpg|thumb|The [[Volkswagen Beetle]] was an icon of post-war West German reconstruction. The pictured example was a one-off version manufactured to celebrate the production of a million cars of the type.]]
The term '''''Wirtschaftswunder''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈvɪʁtʃaftsˌvʊndɐ|lang|De-Wirtschaftswunder.ogg}}, "economic miracle"), also known as the '''Miracle on the Rhine''', describes the rapid reconstruction and development of the [[Economy|economies]] of [[West Germany]] and [[Austria]] after [[World War II]] (adopting an [[ordoliberalism]]-based [[social market economy]]). The expression referring to this phenomenon was first used by ''[[The Times]]'' in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/272445|title = Wirtschaftswunder, n.|date = September 2009|accessdate = 16 October 2014|website = Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher = |last = |first = |subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the [[Monetary reform|replacement]] of the [[German reichsmark|Reichsmark]] with the [[Deutsche Mark]] in 1948 as legal tender (the [[Austrian schilling|Schilling]] was similarly re-established in Austria), a lasting period of low inflation and rapid industrial growth was overseen by the government led by [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|West German Chancellor]] [[Konrad Adenauer]] and his Minister of Economics, [[Ludwig Erhard]], who went down in history as the "father of the German economic miracle." In Austria, efficient labor practices led to a similar period of [[economic growth]].

The era of economic growth raised West Germany and Austria from total wartime devastation to developed nations in modern [[Europe]]. At the founding of the [[European Common Market]] in 1957 West Germany's economic growth stood in contrast to the struggling conditions at the time in the [[United Kingdom]].

==West Germany==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1974-152-14, Berlin, Flüchtlinge aus Ostzone.jpg|thumb|German refugees from the east in [[Berlin]] in 1945]]
The fundamental reason for the quick economic recovery of West Germany can be found in the ordoliberal growth model. West Germany had a skilled workforce and a high technological level in 1946, but its capital stock had largely been destroyed during and after the war. This small capital stock was compounded by the difficulty in converting the German economy to the production of civilian goods, as well as rampant monetary and regulatory problems, leading to an unusually low economic output during the first post-war years.

These initial problems were overcome by the time of the [[Monetary reform|currency reform]] of 1948, which replaced the [[German reichsmark|Reichsmark]] with the [[Deutsche Mark]] as legal tender, halting rampant inflation. This act to strengthen the West German economy had been explicitly forbidden during the two years that [[Morgenthau Plan#JCS 1067|JCS 1067]] was in effect. JCS 1067 had directed the U.S. forces of occupation in West Germany to "take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany".

At the same time, the government, following Erhard's advice, cut taxes sharply on moderate incomes. [[Walter Heller]], a young economist with the U.S. occupation forces who was later to become chairman of President Kennedy's Council of Economic Advisers, wrote in 1949 that to "remove the repressive effect of extremely high rates, Military Government Law No. 64 cut a wide swath across the German tax system at the time of the currency reform." Individual income tax rates, in particular, fell dramatically. Previously the tax rate on any income over 6,000 Deutschmark had been 95 percent. After tax reform, this 95 percent rate applied only to annual incomes above 250,000 Deutschmark. For the West German with an annual income of about 2,400 Deutschmark in 1950, the marginal tax rate fell from 85 percent to 18 percent.

The Allied dismantling of the West German coal and steel industries decided at the [[Potsdam Conference]] was virtually completed by 1950; equipment had then been removed from 706 [[manufacturing plants]] in the west and steel production capacity had been reduced by 6,700,000 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gareau |first=Frederick H. |author-link= |year=1961 |title=Morgenthau's Plan for Industrial Disarmament in Germany |journal=Western Political Quarterly |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=517–534|doi=10.2307/443604 |publisher=University of Utah |jstor=443604 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the industrially important [[Saarland]] with its rich coal fields was returned to West Germany in 1957, it remained economically integrated in a customs union with [[France]] until 1959 and [[France]] extracted coal from the area until 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Saar+area|title=Saar area|author=|date=|website=thefreedictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

West Germany proceeded quickly after 1948 to rebuild its capital stock and thus to increase its economic output at stunning rates. The very high capital investment rate thanks to low consumption and a very small need for replacement capital investments (due to the still small capital stock) drove this recovery during the 1950s. Living standards also rose steadily,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/economicHistory/pdf/wp5600.pdf|title=Department of Economic History|first=London School of Economics and Political|last=Science|date=|website=lse.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the purchasing power of wages increasing by 73% from 1950 to 1960. As noted by the British journalist [[Terence Prittie]] in the early Sixties:

{{quote|Today the German working-man leads a comfortable life and wears a well-filled waistcoat. He eats well, and his food – although German cooking lacks the elegance of French – is wholesome and appetizing. He buys good clothes, and he dresses his wife and children well. He generally has money to spare for television sets, week-end excursions and football matches. And he is not afraid of celebrating occasionally on a grander scale.&lt;ref&gt;Life World Library: Germany by Terence Prittie and the editors of LIFE, 1963, pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Productivity growth in West Germany enabled most workers to obtain significant improvements in their living standards and 'security of life.' In addition, as noted by David Eversley,

{{quote|As real incomes rose, so public authorities were enabled (and indeed encouraged) to raise funds, both from taxation and through borrowing, to accelerate the rate of investment and current spending in projects which are partly immediately productive, partly conducive to the creation of the good life, as seen in Germany ... Any superficial examination of the German townscape, let alone perusal of the statistics, shows that Germany has spent sums on hospitals, libraries, theatres, schools, parks, railway-stations, socially-aided housing, underground railways, airports, museums, and so on which are simply not to be compared with British efforts in this direction.&lt;ref&gt;Poverty and Inequality in Common Market Countries edited by Victor George and Roger Lawson.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Reparations===
{{Further|World War II reparations}}
In addition to the physical barriers that had to be overcome for the West German economic recovery, there were also intellectual challenges. The Allies confiscated intellectual property of great value, all German patents, both in Germany and abroad, and used them to strengthen their own industrial competitiveness by licensing them to Allied companies.&lt;ref&gt;C. Lester Walker [http://www.scientistsandfriends.com/files/secrets.doc ''"Secrets By The Thousands"''], [[Harper's Magazine]]. October 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the German surrender and for the next two years, the [[United States|U.S.]] pursued a vigorous program to harvest all technological and scientific know-how as well as all patents in Germany. [[John Gimbel]]'s book "''Science Technology and Reparations: Exploitation and Plunder in Postwar Germany''" concludes the "intellectual reparations" taken by the U.S. and the [[UK]] amounted to close to $10 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Norman M. Naimark, The Russians in Germany, p. 206. (Naimark refers to Gimbel's book.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The $10 billion compares to the U.S. annual GDP of $258 billion in 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The $10 billion compares to the total Marshall plan expenditure (1948–1952) of $13 billion, of which West Germany received $1.4 billion (partly as loans).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the more than two years this policy was in place, new industrial research in Germany was hampered because it was unprotected and freely available to overseas competitors, encouraged by occupation authorities to access all records and facilities.

===Marshall Plan===
{{Main|Marshall Plan}}
[[File:Marshallplanhilfe.gif|thumb|Builders in [[West Berlin]] working on a project funded with Marshall Aid, 1952]]
Meanwhile, thousands of the best German researchers and engineers were working in the [[Soviet Union]] and in the [[United States|U.S.]] See [[Operation Osoaviakhim]], [[Operation Paperclip]].

The Marshall Plan was only extended to Western Germany after it was realized the suppression of its economy was holding back the recovery of other European countries and was not the main force behind the ''Wirtschaftswunder''.&lt;ref name="Pas de Pagaille!"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,887417,00.html  "Pas de Pagaille!"], 28 July 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stern"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.germany.info/relaunch/culture/history/marshall.html |title="''Marshall Plan 1947–1997 A German View"'' by Susan Stern |accessdate=2007-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709055340/http://www.germany.info/relaunch/culture/history/marshall.html |archivedate=9 July 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Had that been the case, other countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], which received much greater economic assistance than West Germany, should have experienced the same phenomenon. However, often overlooked is the effect of the "unofficial contributions" of 150,000 U.S. occupation troops, earning as much as 4 Deutschmark to the dollar. These marks were spent within West Germany to buy food, luxury items, beer and cars, as well as entertaining the locals and for prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;"Deployment of Military Personnel by Country," U.S. Department of Defense, Washington Headquarters Services.&lt;/ref&gt; During exercises such numbers of soldiers would swell to over 250,000. Nonetheless, the amount of monetary aid, which was mainly in the form of loans, about $1.4 billion, was greatly overshadowed by the amount the Germans had to pay back as [[war reparations]] and by the charges the Allies made on the Germans for the ongoing cost of the occupation, about $2.4 billion per year. In 1953 it was decided that Germany would repay $1.1 billion of the aid it had received. The last repayment was made in June 1971.&lt;ref name="stern"/&gt;

The demands of the [[Korean War]] in 1950–53 led to a global shortage of goods that helped overcome lingering resistance to the purchase of West German products. At the time West Germany had a large pool of skilled labour, partly as a result of the [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|deportations and migrations]] which affected up to 16.5 million Germans. This helped West Germany to more than double the value of its exports during and shortly after the war. Apart from these factors, hard work and long hours at full capacity among the population in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s and extra labour supplied by thousands of ''[[Gastarbeiter]]'' ("guest workers", since the late 1950s) provided a vital base for the sustainment of the economic upturn with additional workforce.

From the late 1950s onwards, West Germany had one of the world's strongest economies. The [[East Germany|East German]] economy also showed strong growth, but not as much as in West Germany, due to the bureaucratic system, emigration of working-age East Germans to West Germany and continued reparations to the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] in terms of resources. Unemployment hit a record low of 0.7–0.8% in 1961–1966 and 1970–1971.

[[Ludwig Erhard]], who served as Minister of the Economy in [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Konrad Adenauer|Adenauer]]'s cabinet from 1949 until 1963 and would later rise to Chancellor himself, is often associated with the West German ''Wirtschaftswunder''.

==Austria==
[[File:Stausee Moserboden-1968 25.jpg|thumb|Moserboden reservoir, Kaprun, 1968]]
Austria was also included in the [[Marshall Plan]] and can thus be included in any consideration of the ''Wirtschaftswunder''. Through the nationalisation of key industries ([[Voestalpine AG|VOEST]], [[Austria Metall AG|AMAG]], [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch|Steyr-Puch]]) and yet more long working hours,{{clarify|date=December 2014}} full economic capacity was reached. Using West Germany as a guide, the currency was stabilised when the [[Austrian Schilling|Schilling]] was reintroduced in place of the [[German reichsmark|Reichsmark]]. This economic policy was known in journalistic circles as the ''Raab-Kamitz-Kurs'', named after [[Julius Raab]], Austrian [[Chancellor of Austria|chancellor]] from 1953, and his Finance Minister [[Reinhard Kamitz]] similar to the West German ''Adenauer-Erhard-Kurs''.

By state major projects such as the [[Kaprun]] hydroelectric plant or the [[West Autobahn]], unemployment fell and social peace was ensured. In the 1950s the first ''Gastarbeiter'' from [[Southern Italy]] and [[Greece]] arrived in the country, as more manual labour was required to maintain the economic upswing.

The '''Yes California Independence Campaign''' is an American [[political action committee]], founded by [[Louis J. Marinelli]], that promotes the [[Partition and secession in California|secession of the state of California]] from the [[United States]].

The organization promoted a proposed [[initiative]] to be placed on the 2018 California state ballot, which, if it had passed, would have required an [[Independence referendum|independence plebiscite]] to be held in March 2019 on the question of California's independence. In order to comply with federal law, however, it would have still required an amendment to the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tech Insider |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/calexit-explainer-california-plans-to-secede-2016-11 |title=What is 'Calexit' and how can California secede from the US? |publisher=Business Insider |date=2016-11-09 |accessdate=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, the office of [[California Secretary of State]] [[Alex Padilla]] gave its approval for the organization to gather petition signatures to put the initiative on the ballot.&lt;ref name="CNBC20170127"/&gt; The organization then halted their efforts later in April, stating that they want to re-tool their proposal and campaign.{{sfn|Miller|2017}}

== "Yes California" and "Calexit" ==
Yes California formed in August 2015, succeeding the Sovereign California campaign.{{sfn|Richardson|2016}}  The campaign adopted its name and logo from [[Yes Scotland]], a campaign group from the [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|2014 independence referendum in Scotland]].{{sfn|The Scotsman staff|2016}}  The campaign has earned the nicknames ''Caleavefornia'', ''Califrexit'',{{sfn|Solon|2016}} and ''Calexit'' (after [[Brexit]], the [[United Kingdom]]'s withdrawal from the European Union).{{sfn|Robinson|2016}}

== Background ==
There have been more than 200 proposals for the secession of California over the state's history.{{sfn|Gutierrez|Floum|2016}}  The last instance of [[secession in the United States]] happened in 1861, when 11 states left the Union and formed the [[Confederate States of America]].  These states returned to the Union in 1865 after the Confederacy was defeated in the [[American Civil War]].  The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decided in [[Texas v. White]] in 1869 that no state had the right to unilaterally leave the Union.{{sfn|Robinson|2016b}}  Secession would thus require the approval of 38 state legislatures and two-thirds majorities in both the [[United States House of Representatives|US House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]],{{sfn|McPhate|2016}} to pass a [[Constitutional amendment]], as the Constitution provides no mechanism for state secession.{{sfn|Gutierrez|Floum|2016}}  Analysts consider California's secession improbable.{{sfn|McPhate|2016}}

==History==

[[File:Yes Scotland logo.svg|thumb|alt=|The Yes California campaign borrows its name and logo from the [[Yes Scotland]] campaign of 2014.]]

The [[hashtag]] #Calexit trended in social media as the campaign gained attention{{sfn|McPhate|2016}} in the wake of [[United States presidential election, 2016|the election]] of [[Donald Trump]] to the presidency in November 2016;{{sfn|Robinson|2016}} California gave [[Hillary Clinton]] 61.5% of the vote to Trump's 33.2%.{{sfn|Hamblin|2016}}  Marinelli asserted this was evidence of the political divide between the state and nation, saying California is more progressive than the rest of the country and that Californians were offended by Trump's statements about minorities.{{sfn|Associated Press staff|2016}}

The campaign staged protests outside the Capitol building in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] after the November 2016 election, though its organizers asserted the protests had been planned months in advance and would have been held, regardless of who won the election.{{sfn|Bollag|2016}} Immediately following the election, the campaign received 11,000 emails.{{sfn|Gutierrez|Floum|2016}}

On November 21, 2016, the Yes California campaign submitted an [[initiative]] for signature gathering, with an amendment sent later on December 23 to correct a typo. If passed by voters in November 2018, it would have repealed Article III, Section 1 of the [[Constitution of California|California Constitution]], which states California is "an inseparable part" of the U.S., and require an [[Independence referendum|independence plebiscite]] to be held on March 5, 2019, on the question of California's independence, the passage of which would have required at a minimum 50% voter turnout and 55% voting yes. If the proposed 2019 independence referendum were to pass, the [[Governor of California]] would have then been required to apply for California to join the [[United Nations]].{{sfn|Evans|2016}}

On January 26, 2017, the office of [[California Secretary of State]] [[Alex Padilla]] gave its approval for the signature gathering process to begin.&lt;ref name="CNBC20170127"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/27/california-succession-movement-starts-gathering-petition-signatures.html | title=California secession movement starts gathering petition signatures | publisher=CNBC | date=January 26, 2017 | accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported on February 18 that the Yes California campaign had opened up to 53 chapters across the state, but had not yet reported contributions to the California Secretary of State's office.{{sfn|Zezima|2017}}

The campaign then ran into controversy due to its president, [[Louis J. Marinelli]], a New Yorker living in [[Russia]],&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-12-07/how-to-make-california-great-secede-with-a-little-help-from-putin|title=How to Make California Great: Secede, With a Little Help From Putin|publisher=|accessdate=29 December 2016|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was reported to have received significant assistance from the Russian government to promote his efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ww2.kqed.org/news/2016/12/13/from-his-home-in-russia-calexit-leader-plots-california-secession/|title=From His Home in Russia, #Calexit Leader Plots California Secession|date=13 December 2016|work=kqed.org|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marinelli announced on December 18, 2016, that the Yes California campaign had opened an "embassy" in [[Moscow]] as a cultural centre to help educate Russians about California's history, boost trade, and promote tourism.{{sfn|Barnes|2016}} The Moscow office was partially funded by a [[Kremlin]]-backed charity linked to Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]], while the Anti-Globalization Movement of Russia provided the office space rent-free.{{sfn|Kramer|2017}}{{sfn|Noyes|2017}}

On April 17, in the context of the alleged [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference in the 2016 elections]], the Yes California organization announced that it had decided to halt its efforts to seek a clean break from the controversy surrounding Marinelli's connections to Russia, and to re-tool its proposal and campaign. Marinelli also announced that he would seek permanent residence in Russia.{{sfn|Miller|2017}} Still, [[BBC News]] reported in November 2017 that it found evidence that social media accounts with ties to Russia had pushed a huge Twitter trend in favor of an independent California on election night 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-41853131 | title='Russian trolls' promoted California independence | date=November 4, 2017 | accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis of the initial proposed proposition==
===By the California Legislative Analyst's Office===
As per the [[California ballot proposition]] process, the [[California Legislative Analyst's Office]] filed a report on the proposed initiative's estimated fiscal effects. This report noted that the proposed initiative could be challenged in California courts on grounds that it would be "an unconstitutional revision of California's basic governmental framework". Under the California Constitution, such proposals that would make "far reaching changes in the nature of [California's] basic governmental plan" or "substantially alter the basic governmental framework set forth in the [California] Constitution" can only be placed before voters by either the [[California Legislature]] or a state constitutional convention, and not via a voter initiative.{{sfn|CA Legislative Analyst's Office|2017}} For example, a California court could consider whether the repealing of Article III, Section 1, stating that California is "an inseparable part" of the U.S., would be such a major revision. Yes California argues that this not a major revision, based on the California Supreme Court's test in ''Legislature v. Eu'' that a revision "must necessarily or inevitably appear from the face of the challenged provision that the measure will substantially alter [California's] basic governmental framework".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Yes California | title=The Calexit ballot measure is an amendment to, not revision of, the California Constitution | url=http://www.yescalifornia.org/calexit_amendment_not_revision_california_constitution | date=December 26, 2016 | accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Legislative Analyst's report also noted the tens of millions of dollars that would have to be spent by state and local governments to hold an additional statewide election on March 2019.{{sfn|CA Legislative Analyst's Office|2017}}

Were California to actually become its own separate nation, the major economic and budgetary impacts for both the current state and local governments are unknown. Among these would be the "sorting out of the liabilities, property holdings, border arrangements, military infrastructure, and other details" relevant to not only a relationship with the U.S., but also dealing with the military, trade, customs, and other relationships with other countries.{{sfn|CA Legislative Analyst's Office|2017}}

Furthermore, even if the Governor of California were to apply for California to join the United Nations, the Legislative Analyst's report cites
[[Chapter II of the United Nations Charter]]: new member applications must go through the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]], and that the United States, as a permanent member, has [[United Nations Security Council veto power|the ability to block]] such applications.{{sfn|CA Legislative Analyst's Office|2017}}

California has the sixth largest economy in the world and a population larger than [[Poland]].{{sfn|Nevett|2016}}  The Yes California campaign argues that the state suffers under federal overregulation, that the state contributes more federal tax than it receives in federal funding, that the state feels isolated from political power in [[Washington, D.C.]],{{sfn|Lee|2016}} and that there is a wide gap between the political and cultural differences of California and the rest of the country.{{sfn|Robinson|2016}} For example, California disagrees with much of the rest of the country on immigration and environmental policies.{{sfn|Zezima|2017}}

In an op-ed piece published by the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', Marcus Ruiz Evans of Yes California wrote that, "No one is going to pull money out of California if it secedes, no one is going to invade, no one is going to stop trading – there is too much money invested here, too many deals already going on. The world will not let the California economy be disrupted."{{sfn|Evans|2017}}

At a forum held by the campaign in Los Angeles on February 13, 2017, led by Evans and Marinelli, they argued that California annually loses about $70 billion by subsidizing other states and military overseas, which could instead be used elsewhere. Marinelli also stated that taxes could be lowered enough so that "we may not need to have a state income tax anymore".{{sfn|Edwards|2017}}

However, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported on February 18 that the Yes California campaign does not have exact policy positions, nor do they exactly know how a new independent California government would be set up: "The group's goal is to first have the state secede and then figure out how it should run".{{sfn|Zezima|2017}}

In a January 2017 interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', businessman, philanthropist, and PayPal cofounder [[Peter Thiel]] endorsed Calexit, saying, "I think it would be good for California, good for the rest of the country. It would help [U.S. President] Trump's re-election campaign."{{sfn|Dowd|2017}}

In July 2018, the objectives of the Calexit initiative were expanded upon by including a plan to carve out an “autonomous Native American nation”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stanforddaily.com/2018/09/27/final-hf-calexit-supporters-relaunch-campaign-with-proposals-to-create-a-north-american-nation/|title=Calexit supporters relaunch campaign with proposals to create Native American nation|date=2018-09-27|work=The Stanford Daily|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; that would take up the eastern part of California, and "postponing its ballot referendum approach in favor of convincing Republican states to support their breakaway efforts."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===By opponents===
An op-ed piece published by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated that California independence "would be a disaster for progressive values" because the [[Democratic Party (United States)|U.S. Democratic Party]] would lose California's 55 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]], its two U.S. senators and its [[United States congressional delegations from California|delegation to the House of Representatives]], and without California, [[Donald Trump]] would have won the popular vote of the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]]: "For decades California has exerted more influence on American politics and culture than vice versa ... it would practically ensure that the rest of the U.S. would drift farther away from our laid-back tolerance and easygoing diversity ... if the United States minus California continues to do little or nothing to combat climate change, Californians — along with the rest of the world — will suffer."{{sfn|Friedersdorf|2017}}

In an editorial, the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' called Calexit, "a colossally stupid idea ... [that] will start us down a costly, intellectually draining, dead-end path into a world of overwhelming unknowns".{{sfn|Mercury News Editorial Board|2017}} The editorial board of ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' wrote that it is "a waste of time ... [that] reflects a defeatist attitude — that instead of fighting to shape this country’s future, we should just quit. It also reflects a willingness to give up on America".{{sfn|San Diego U-T Editorial Board|2017}}

Los Angeles Mayor [[Eric Garcetti]] has stated that he opposes Calexit, saying, "I want to be a part of an America that continues to stand up for all of us, not bail on all our friends across the country."{{sfn|Edwards|2017}}

Before the Yes California campaign withdrew their initial proposal, former Secretary of Defense [[Leon Panetta]] had warned [[KGO-TV]] about Russia's connections to Marinelli: "We're a big state. With a tremendous impact in terms of this country's economy and politics ... If you can weaken the leadership of the United States in the world, Russia can be able to get away with a lot more of what they want to do."{{sfn|Noyes|2017}}
