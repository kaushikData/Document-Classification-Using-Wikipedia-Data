'''All My Movies''' is a movie collection organizer software for establishing a personal database of media collections ([[Blu-ray Disc]]s, [[DVD]]s, [[VHS| VHS tapes]], etc.) developed by Bolide Software.

Initially developed by Max Smirnoff (now Bolide Software [[Chief executive officer|CEO]]) for his personal usage, the program was published on Bolide Software web site as a [[shareware]]. All My Movies uses [[Amazon Web Services]] and a dozen of other [[Application programming interface|APIs]] provided by the online movie databases for automatical movie details retrieval. It supports almost any [[Barcode reader]] including the cheap [[CueCat]] for a fast movie lookup.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2274">'''Articles of partnership''' is a voluntary [[contract]] between/among two or more persons to place their [[Capital (economics)|capital]], labor, and skills into business, with the understanding that there will be a sharing of the profits and losses between/among partners.  Outside of North America, it is normally referred to simply as a '''partnership agreement'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Sullivan |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) |first2=Steven M. |last2=Sheffrin |title=Economics: Principles in Action |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |date=2003 |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458 |pages=191 |isbn=0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A partnership agreement is the written and legal agreement between/among business partners. It is always recommended but not essential for partners to have such an agreement.

==Articles of partnership==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
Multiple sections are often included in articles of partnership, based on the circumstances:
* the granting of the partner the rights to manage and administer the business or a specific department.
* the authorization of a majority of partners to manage the affairs of the entire partnership. This is particularly common where there are numerous partners.
* provisions to account for, annually, the property and debts of the business.
* the forbidding of any partner to carry out business unrelated to the partnership. This is usually implied in articles of partnership.

The '''Best German Novels of the Twentieth Century''' is a list of books compiled in 1999 by [[Literaturhaus München]] and [[Bertelsmann]], in which 99 prominent German authors, literary critics, and scholars of [[German language|German]] ranked the most significant German-language novels of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=Headlines&gt;{{cite web|date=1999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010607003313/http://www.literaturhaus.at/headlines/1999/01/142/ |archivedate=June 7, 2001 |title=Musils "Mann ohne Eigenschaften" ist "wichtigster Roman des Jahrhunderts"|url = http://www.literaturhaus.at/headlines/1999/01/142/|publisher= LiteraturHaus |language= German|accessdate= August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bettina "Nina" Burr''' (born c. 1946) is vice president of the board of trustees of the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], to which she and other members of her family made a major donation of Rothschild family heirlooms that is known as The Rothschild Collection.

==Family==
Burr was born Bettina Looram, around 1946.&lt;ref name=artery&gt;[http://artery.wbur.org/2015/02/23/mfa-rothschild-gift-nazi-stolen-art "MFA Receives Trove Of Art Seized By The Nazis."] Andrea Shea, TheArtery, 90.9wbur, 23 February 2015.

She is the granddaughter of Baron and Baroness Alphonse and Clarice de Rothschild of the Vienna branch of the Rothschild family.&lt;ref name=teleg&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/art-obituaries/9715373/Bettina-Looram.html "Bettina Looram".] ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 30 November 2012.

Retrieved 3 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Burr is a former teacher.&lt;ref name=artery/&gt;

==Museum of Fine Arts, Boston==
Burr's association with the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, began after she became a tour guide there. She later helped to catalog the museum's [[Woodblock printing in Japan|Japanese woodblock prints]]. She first became an overseer, then in 2006 a trustee of the museum.&lt;ref name=Blou&gt;[http://blogs.artinfo.com/realcleararts/2015/02/22/mfas-gets-a-load-of-rothschild-loot/ "MFA’s Gets A Load of Rothschild Loot."] Judith H.

Retrieved 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time after 2012, Burr and other heirs of Bettina Looram donated a collection of 186 objects, originally in the collection of Alphonse and Clarice de Rothschild, that were looted by the Nazis following the Austrian ''[[Anschluss]]'' with Germany in 1938. The museum has named the gift The Rothschild Collection. It includes, paintings, jewellery, prints and drawings, furniture, and books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.org/news/restoring-a-legacy-rothschild-family-treasures "Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Announces Major Gift from Rothschild Heirs, Including Family Treasures Recovered from Austria after WWII."] Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. 22 February 2015. Retrieved 3 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis seized nearly 3,500 items from the Vienna Rothschilds, many intended for Adolf Hitler's planned ''[[Führermuseum]]'' that would have been located in the Austrian city of Linz had it been built. The looted items were stored in the Austrian salt mines of [[Altaussee]] where they were discovered by the Allies after the war.&lt;ref name=Bost/&gt;

In order to export the bulk of the collection to the United States, where Clarice de Rothschild then lived, she was required to donate around 250 items to the Austrian government. These items were not recovered by the family until a change in Austrian law in 1999, long after Alphonse and Clarice de Rothschild had died. Many of the recovered items were then sold at auction in London in a sale that realised a record at that time of over £57m.&lt;ref name=teleg/&gt; The items donated to the Boston museum come mainly from the items recovered in 1999 that were not sold because they had particular family meaning. The jewellery included in the donation was never in Nazi hands because Clarice de Rothschild and her husband had been in London at the time of the ''Anschluss'' and she had had the jewellery with her.&lt;ref name=Bost&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2015/02/22/rothschild-heirs-donate-works-once-looted-nazis-mfa/64Axq5tuhcHrKxR4kVI0sI/story.html "Nazi-looted Rothschild art goes to MFA."] Malcolm Gay, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', 23 February 2015. Retrieved 4 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the items given to the Museum was [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]]'s ''Portrait of Emma Hart'', later [[Lady Hamilton]], mistress of [[Lord Nelson]] and muse to Romney.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/23/arts/design/rothschild-family-treasures-find-a-resting-place-in-boston.html?_r=0 "Rothschild Family Treasures Find a Resting Place in Boston."] Judith H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4230">'''Bloque Meta''' (English: Meta Block) was a [[Colombia]]n drug trafficking, [[Paramilitarism in Colombia|neo-paramilitary]] organization engaged in the [[Colombian armed conflict]]. Bloque Meta's history can be traced back to the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia]], or AUC. When the AUC demobilized in 2006, many former members of the organization formed ERPAC, which would later partly become the Bloque Meta, to continue the counterrevolutionary struggle against the [[FARC]] in Colombia's eastern plains. Above all, the Bloque Meta is considered one of Colombia's most brutal drug trafficking organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/justicia/ARTICULO-WEB-NEW_NOTA_INTERIOR-13003734.html |title=Guerra de capos en los Llanos Orientales - Noticias de Justicia en Colombia |publisher=Eltiempo.Com |date=2013-08-19 |accessdate=2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group could have some 260 members in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/after-failed-demobilization-erpac-factions-join-colombias-larger-war |title=After Failed Demobilization, ERPAC Factions Join Colombia's Larger War - InSight Crime &amp;#124; Organized Crime in the Americas |publisher=InSight Crime |date=2012-06-08 |accessdate=2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last leader of the criminal group, Arnulfo Hernandez Guzman, also known as Tigre, was captured September 22, 2017, in Villavicencio (Meta). With this capture, according to statements by the [[Ministry of National Defense (Colombia)|Ministry of Defence]], the organization is completely dismantled. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.infobae.com/america/colombia/2017/09/25/le-decia-tigre-y-manejaba-las-rutas-narco-en-los-llanos-orientales-de-colombia-cayo-por-sus-citas-con-una-modelo/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent history==
The Bloque Meta is believed to have been created by former members of the AUC who refused to demobilize together with the rest of the AUC coalition. These members formed ERPAC, which disintegrated in 2009, after which two factions arose; Bloque Meta and [[Libertadores del Vichada]]. These groups fight each other over the control of drug trafficking in the eastern [[Meta department]]. The leader of Bloque Meta, alias ‘Orozco’, claimed in a recent interview the struggle against [[Libertadores del Vichada]] was political and not about drug trafficking.&lt;ref name="canalrcnmsn1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canalrcnmsn.com/noticias/guerra_de_bandas_criminales_en_meta_deja_decenas_de_muertos |title=Guerra de bandas criminales en Meta deja decenas de muertos |publisher=www.canalrcnmsn.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020114532/http://www.canalrcnmsn.com/noticias/guerra_de_bandas_criminales_en_meta_deja_decenas_de_muertos |archivedate=2013-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the capture of criminals known as El Loco Barrera and Jhonatan, in addition to the death of Pijarvey; the two blocs were in the hands of the drug trafficker Mauricio Pachón Rozo, also known as "Puntilla", reunited the two groups; This time with a new name: "Los Puntilleros", with base of operations in the Eastern Plains. The last leader of the Puntilleros, Arnulfo Hernandez Guzman, also known as Tigre, was captured September 22, 2017, in Villavicencio (Meta). With this capture, according to statements by the Ministry of Defence, the organization is completely dismantled. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.infobae.com/america/colombia/2017/09/25/le-decia-tigre-y-manejaba-las-rutas-narco-en-los-llanos-orientales-de-colombia-cayo-por-sus-citas-con-una-modelo/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modus operandi==
The Bloque Meta uses AK-47 rifles, heavy machine-guns and light mortars.&lt;ref name="canalrcnmsn1"/&gt;

The project was initiated to provide greater access to some of the 100,000 images within its collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/12162/A-way-of-life-overtaken.3976167.jp | title=A Way of Life Overtaken by Modern Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[website]] was launched in February 2008 with an accompanying [[art exhibition|exhibition]], entitled “Edinburgh Past and Present”, featuring images chosen by personalities connected with the city.&lt;ref name="Stars Choose Favourite Pictures"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7263655.stm Stars Choose Favourite Pictures]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the celebrities who selected and commented on images from the collection included swimmer [[Kirsty Balfour]], impressionist [[Rory Bremner]], former [[Bishop of Edinburgh]] [[Richard Holloway]], and children’s author [[Aileen Paterson]]. Six years later, nearly 35,000 images have been digitised and more than 8000 images are available to view online.

==World Heritage Site==
The [[digitisation]] project was part-funded by Edinburgh World Heritage Trust,&lt;ref name="Capital Collections"&gt;[http://www.ewht.org.uk/Capital-Collections-Goes-Live.aspx Capital Collections] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704181917/http://www.ewht.org.uk/Capital-Collections-Goes-Live.aspx |date=July 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow users access to the rare and unique material relating to the Old and New Towns of the UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]. The website gives people all over the globe an educational tool to learn more about their family history and cultural roots.&lt;ref name="Auld Reekie in New Light"&gt;[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/scotland/Website-that-shows-Auld-Reekie.3818303.jp Auld Reekie in New Light]&lt;/ref&gt;

The photographer involved with the project have the opportunity to take contemporary photographs of the city. The modern images compliment and provide comparisons with the early photographs of Edinburgh, as well as providing a valuable record of the changes occurring in the city.&lt;ref name="The Scots Magazine"&gt;{{cite news | last=Simpson | first=Roddy | title=Edinburgh illustrated | publisher=[[D.C. Thomson &amp; Co.]] | work=[[The Scots Magazine]] |date=January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
The Special Collections within the departments of Central Library contain materials representing [[Edinburgh]] and [[Scotland| Scotland’s]] social, cultural and architectural heritage. They contain items of international importance in a variety of media, including paintings, Japanese prints, engravings and drawings. Capital Collections displays a particularly strong collection of early [[photography]], most notably including work by the founding fathers of modern photography  [[Hill &amp; Adamson]] &lt;ref name="Edinburgh Evening News"&gt;{{cite news | last=Vallely | first=Joanna | title=Pioneers’ images in the public eye | publisher=[[The Scotsman Publications]] | work=[[Edinburgh Evening News]] | date=21 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as lesser known pioneers, Archibald Burns, Thomas Keith and Thomas Begbie. Other artists of note include [[Walter Geikie]], [[John Kay (caricaturist)|John Kay]], [[Alexander Nasmyth]] and James Skene.

==New Developments==
Capital Collections is also represented on [[Flickr]] giving further digital access to otherwise hard to reach resources. By adopting this alternative approach to digital media, the project is attempting to engage with new online audiences through the principles of [[photo sharing]] and [[user-generated content]].

==Timezone effects==
When files are transferred across time zones and between Microsoft [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] and [[NTFS]] [[file system]]s, the timestamp displayed by the same file may change, so that identical files with different storage histories are deemed different by a comparer that requires the timestamps to match. The difference is an exact number of quarters of an hour up to 95 (same minutes modulo 15 and seconds) if the file was transported across zones; there is also a one-hour difference within a single zone caused by the transition between standard time and [[daylight saving time]] (DST). Some, but not all, file comparison and synchronisation software can be configured to ignore the DST and time-zone differences.&lt;ref&gt;Example: "Beyond Compare" help describes a user setting "timezone differences – ignores timestamp differences that are multiples of an exact hour."&lt;/ref&gt; Software known to have daylight-saving compensation is marked in the [[#Aspects|Aspects]] table.

A '''country code second-level domain''' is a [[second-level domain]] to a [[country code top-level domain]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Such a domain may be reserved by a [[domain name registry]] for the registration of third-level domains, or assigned to a third party as a [[subdomain]].

Many country code domain registries implement domain name classes at the second level underneath their ccTLD, such as are present in the original generic [[top-level domain]]s &lt;tt&gt;com&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;net&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;org&lt;/tt&gt;, which were intended for commercial entities, network operators, and non-profit organizations, respectively.

Many countries implement additional classes. For example, the [[United Kingdom]] ([[.uk|uk]]) uses &lt;tt&gt;[[.co.uk|co.uk]]&lt;/tt&gt; for commercial purposes and &lt;tt&gt;[[.ac.uk|ac.uk]]&lt;/tt&gt; for academic registrants. Brazil ([[.br|br]]) has a high number of restricted second-level domains, 67 as of 2011;&lt;ref&gt;[http://registro.br/info/dpn.html Registro.br] 4 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; they range from &lt;tt&gt;com.br&lt;/tt&gt; for commercial activities and &lt;tt&gt;vet.br&lt;/tt&gt; for veterinarians to &lt;tt&gt;wiki.br&lt;/tt&gt; for wikis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://registro.br/info/dpn.html|title=Registro.br|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture24 is based in [[Brighton]], southern England, and has ten employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://weareculture24.org.uk/about-us/meet-the-team/ |title=Meet the team |publisher=Culture24 |accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Culture24 Director is Jane Finnis, who contributed a chapter to ''Learning to Live: Museums, young people and education''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ippr.org.uk/publicationsandreports/publication.asp?id=665 |title=Learning to Live: Museums, young people and education |editor=Kate Bellamy and Carey Oppenheim |date=13 May 2009 |work= |publisher=[[Institute for Public Policy Research]] |accessdate=14 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524173815/http://www.ippr.org.uk/publicationsandreports/publication.asp?id=665 |archivedate=24 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2010 was named as one of 50 "Women to Watch" in the United Kingdom cultural and creative sectors by the Cultural Leadership Programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.culturalleadership.org.uk/women-to-watch/w2w/jane-finnis/ |title=Women to Watch: Jane Finnis, Director, Culture24 |publisher=Cultural Leadership Programme |accessdate=14 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129134318/http://www.culturalleadership.org.uk/women-to-watch/w2w/jane-finnis/ |archivedate=29 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Culture24 chairman is John Newbigin, who was named as one of [[Wired Magazine]]'s top 100 people shaping the digital world in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/the-wired-100-positions-51-to-100 |title=The Wired 100 |date=1 April 2010 |work=[[Wired UK]] |publisher=Conde Nast |accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charity was founded in 2001 as the ''24 Hour Museum'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/5b8ea24735dcdb90c75e9d21418e9642/compdetails |title=Culture24 company information |publisher=[[Companies House]] |accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the website of the same name&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/342954.stm |title=24 Hour Museum Goes Live |date=13 May 1999 |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; became an independent company.

The organisation changed its name to ''Culture24'' in November 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/jun/09/museums.culture |title=Virtually the best of British heritage |author=Jack Schofield |date=9 June 2008 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=24 June 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the website followed suit on 11 February 2009.&lt;ref name=gov/&gt; Culture24 is a registered charity and is funded by the [[UK government]] through [[Arts Council England]] (ACE).

==Purpose==
The (now defunct) [[Museums, Libraries and Archives Council]] was working with Culture24 as one of its partners in furthering the council's digital agenda, specifically helping to deliver:

{{quote|More and better quality information on cultural opportunities to the public&lt;br/&gt;
A coherent portal for cultural resources for teachers and learners&lt;br/&gt;
Greater interaction with individuals and communities through use of Web 2.0 and social networking tools&lt;br /&gt;
High quality standards in the management and preservation of digital resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=MLA's approach to the digital agenda | publisher=[[Museums, Libraries and Archives Council]] | year=2008 | accessdate=24 November 2009 | url=http://www.mla.gov.uk/what/programmes/digital | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113043405/http://www.mla.gov.uk/what/programmes/digital | archivedate=13 November 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Culture24 also administers [[Museums at Night (UK)]], the annual weekend of late openings at museums, galleries and heritage sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/museumsatnight |title=Museums at Night homepage |publisher=Culture24 |accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Websites==
The main ''Culture24'' website is a guide to museums, public galleries, libraries, archives, heritage sites and science centres. It has a database of over 5,000 cultural institutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/search%20results?f1=Type&amp;t1=3O&amp;d=List&amp;n=20&amp;s=alphabetical&amp;sd=ascending |title=Culture24 venue search results |publisher=Culture24 |accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are able to update the information about their activities. It features daily arts, museum, history and heritage news, and exhibition reviews. News stories are available as [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] [[newsfeed]].

Culture24 also runs a site for children, ''Show Me'', which has online activities related to UK museums and galleries, including interactive games, quizzes and competitions. A section of the site contains guidance for parents and teachers about using online resources from museums and galleries.

In 2009, Culture24 was runner-up in the [[Nominet]] Trust Best Practice Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nominet.org.uk/digitalAssets/36431_BestPracticeChallenge_winners2009.pdf |title=Nominet Best Practice Challenge 2009 Winners |publisher=[[Nominet UK]] |accessdate=14 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003210055/http://www.nominet.org.uk/digitalAssets/36431_BestPracticeChallenge_winners2009.pdf |archivedate=3 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Culture24 suite of websites won the 2010 "best of the web" award (long lived category) at the Museums and the Web Conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conference.archimuse.com/forum/congratulations_mw2010_best_web_winners "Congratulations to the MW2010 Best of the Web Winners!"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120708174632/http://www.museumsandtheweb.com/forum/congratulations_mw2010_best_web_winners |date=8 July 2012 }} 16 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Culture24 is also listed as one of the [[The Guardian|Guardian]]'s top 100 essential websites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/dec/09/best-websites-internet |title=The 100 essential websites |date=9 December 2009 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=14 June 2010 | location=London | first1=Jack | last1=Schofield | first2=Bobbie | last2=Johnson | first3=Charles | last3=Arthur | first4=Stuart | last4=O'Connor | first5=Mercedes | last5=Bunz | first6=Victor | last6=Keegan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the [[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times]]' top 10 museum websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/the_web/article7016077.ece |title=The 10 best museum websites |author=Mike Peake |date=7 February 2010 |work=The Sunday Times |accessdate=14 June 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], ''dharma'' signifies behaviours that are considered to be in accord with ''[[Ṛta]]'', the order that makes life and universe possible,&lt;ref name="ODWR-Dharma" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="ODWR-Dharma"|From the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of World Religions]]'': "In Hinduism, dharma is a fundamental concept, referring to the order and custom which make life and a universe possible, and thus to the behaviours appropriate to the maintenance of that order."&lt;ref name="ODWR-Dharma"&gt;"[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/dharma.aspx#1 Dharma]", ''The Oxford Dictionary of World Religions''.&lt;/ref&gt;}} and includes duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and "right way of living".&lt;ref name=srdtce&gt;see:

However, he was always careful to define this ''dharma'' as "dependently arisen phenomena" (''paticca-samuppanna-dhamma'') ... In order to distinguish this notion of ''dhamma'' from the Indian conception where the term ''dharma'' meant reality (''atman''), in an ontological sense, the Buddha utilised the conception of result or consequence or fruit (''attha'', Sk. ''artha'') to bring out the pragmatic meaning of ''dhamma''."&lt;ref name=david /&gt;}} [[Dharma (Jainism)|Dharma in Jainism]] refers to the teachings of ''[[tirthankara]]'' (''Jina'')&lt;ref name="ODWR-Dharma" /&gt; and the body of doctrine pertaining to the purification and moral transformation of human beings. For [[Sikh]]s, the word ''dharm'' means the path of righteousness and proper religious practice.&lt;ref name=rinehart138/&gt;

The word ''dharma'' was already in use in the [[historical Vedic religion]], and its meaning and conceptual scope has evolved over several millennia.&lt;ref name=phph/&gt; The [[antonym]] of dharma is ''[[adharma]]''.

==Etymology==
[[File:Dhamma inscription.jpg|thumb|The [[Prakrit]] word "''Dha-ṃ-ma''"/[[wikt:𑀥𑀁𑀫|𑀥𑀁𑀫]] ([[Sanskrit]]: Dharma [[wikt:धर्म#Sanskrit|धर्म]]) in the [[Brahmi script]], as inscribed by Emperor [[Ashoka]] in his [[Edicts of Ashoka]] (3rd century BCE).]]
The [[Classical Sanskrit]] noun ''dharma'' ([[wikt:धर्म#Sanskrit|धर्म]]) or the [[Prakrit]] Dhaṃma ([[wikt:𑀥𑀁𑀫|𑀥𑀁𑀫]]) are a derivation from the root ''dhṛ'', which means "to hold, maintain, keep",{{refn|group=note|name="Monier Williams"|Monier Williams, ''A Sanskrit Dictionary'' (1899): "to hold , bear (also bring forth) , carry , maintain , preserve, keep , possess , have , use , employ , practise , undergo"&lt;ref&gt;Monier Willams.&lt;/ref&gt;}} and takes a meaning of "what is established or firm", and hence "law". It is derived from an older [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''n''-stem ''dharman-'', with a literal meaning of "bearer, supporter", in a [[Historical Vedic religion|religious sense]]  conceived as an aspect of [[Rta]].{{sfn|Day|1982|pp=42–45}}

In the [[Rigveda]], the word appears as an ''n''-stem, ''{{IAST|dhárman-}}'', with a range of meanings encompassing "something established or firm" (in the literal sense of prods or poles). Figuratively, it means "sustainer" and "supporter" (of deities). It is semantically similar to the Greek ''[[Themis]]'' ("fixed decree, statute, law").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brereton|first=Joel P.|date=December 2004|title=Dhárman In The Rgveda|journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy|language=English|volume=32|issue=5–6|pages=449–489|doi=10.1007/s10781-004-8631-8|issn=0022-1791|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Classical Sanskrit]], the noun becomes thematic: ''{{IAST|dharma-}}''.

The word ''dharma'' derives from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root 
*''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/dʰer-|*dʰer-]]'' ("to hold"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-first=Helmut |editor-last=Rix |editor-link=Helmut Rix |title=Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben |year=2001 |language=German |page=145 |publisher=Dr. Ludwig Reichert Verlag |edition=2nd |location=Wiesbaden|title-link=Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben }}&lt;/ref&gt; which in Sanskrit is reflected as class-1 root{{clarify|date=January 2018|What is a "class-1 root"? I find no article on that topic and no mention of it in the article about Sanskrit. Does that correspond with the numbering in the "Sonority hierarchy" section of the "Proto-Indo-European root" article?}} ''[[wikt:धरति#Sanskrit|dhṛ]]''. Etymologically it is related to [[Avestan language|Avestan]] dar- ("to hold"), Latin ''[[wikt:firmus#Latin|firmus]]'' ("steadfast, stable, powerful"), Lithuanian ''[[wikt:derėti#Lithuanian|derė́ti]]'' ("to be suited, fit"), Lithuanian ''dermė'' ("agreement")&lt;ref&gt;Karl Brugmann, ''Elements of the Comparative Grammar of the Indo-Germanic languages'',  Volume III, B. Westermann &amp; Co., New York, 1892, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''darna'' ("harmony") and [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''[[wikt:дръжати#Old Church Slavonic|drъžati]]'' ("to hold, possess").
*Classical Sanskrit word ''dharmas'' would formally match with Latin o-stem ''[[wikt:firmus#Latin|firmus]]'' from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''dʰer-mo-s'' "holding", were it not for its historical development from earlier Rigvedic n-stem.

In Classical Sanskrit, and in the [[Vedic Sanskrit]] of the [[Atharvaveda]], the stem is thematic: ''{{IAST|dhárma-}}'' ([[Devanāgarī]]: धर्म). In [[Prakrit]] and [[Pāli]], it is rendered ''dhamma''. In some [[Indo-Aryan languages#Contemporary languages|contemporary Indian languages]] and dialects it alternatively occurs as ''dharm''.

;Ancient translations
When the [[Mauryan Empire|Mauryan Emperor]] [[Ashoka]] wanted in the 3rd century BCE to translate the word "Dharma" (he used [[Prakrit]] word ''[[Dhamma|Dhaṃma]]'') into Greek and Aramaic, he used the Greek word ''[[Eusebeia]]'' (εὐσέβεια,  piety, spiritual maturity, or godliness) in the [[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription]] and the [[Kandahar Greek Edict of Ashoka|Kandahar Greek Edicts]], and the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word ''Qsyt'' ("Truth") in the [[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hiltebeitel |first1=Alf |title=Dharma: Its Early History in Law, Religion, and Narrative |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=9780195394238 |pages=36–37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4NF8pYxdvIC&amp;pg=PA36 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Dharma is a concept of central importance in [[Indian philosophy]] and [[Indian religions|religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dhand|first=Arti|date=17 December 2002|title=The Dharma of Ethics, the Ethics of Dharma: Quizzing the Ideals of Hinduism|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9795.00113/abstract|journal=Journal of Religious Ethics|language=en|volume=30|issue=3|page=351|doi=10.1111/1467-9795.00113|issn=1467-9795|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has multiple meanings in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is difficult to provide a single concise definition for ''dharma'', as the word has a long and varied history and straddles a complex set of meanings and interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. B. Van Buitenen, "Dharma and Moksa", ''Philosophy East and West'', Volume 7, Number 1/2 (April–July 1957), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no equivalent single-word synonym for ''dharma'' in western languages.&lt;ref name=lraw&gt;See:

There have been numerous, conflicting attempts to translate ancient Sanskrit literature with the word ''dharma'' into German, English and French. The concept, claims Paul Horsch,&lt;ref name=paulhorsch/&gt; has caused exceptional difficulties for modern commentators and translators. For example, while Grassmann's&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Grassmann, ''Worterbuch zum Rig-veda'' (German Edition), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120816367}}&lt;/ref&gt; translation of Rig-veda identifies seven different meanings of dharma, [[Karl Friedrich Geldner]] in his translation of the Rig-veda employs 20 different translations for dharma, including meanings such as "law", "order", "duty", "custom", "quality", and "model", among others.&lt;ref name=paulhorsch/&gt; However, the word ''dharma'' has become a widely accepted [[loanword]] in English, and is included in all modern unabridged English dictionaries.

The root of the word ''dharma'' is "dhri", which means "to support, hold, or bear". It is the thing that regulates the course of change by not participating in change, but that principle which remains constant.&lt;ref name=stevenrosen&gt;Steven Rosen (2006), ''Essential Hinduism'', Praeger, {{ISBN|0-275-99006-0}}, pp. 34–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Monier-Williams, the widely cited resource for definitions and explanation of Sanskrit words and concepts of Hinduism, offers&lt;ref&gt;see:

Yet, each of these definitions is incomplete, while combination of these translations do not convey the total sense of the word. In common parlance, ''dharma'' means "right way of living" and "path of rightness".&lt;ref name=stevenrosen/&gt;

The meaning of the word ''dharma'' depends on the context, and its meaning has evolved as ideas of Hinduism have developed through history. In the earliest texts and ancient myths of Hinduism, ''dharma'' meant cosmic law, the rules that created the universe from chaos, as well as rituals; in later [[Vedas]], [[Upanishads]], [[Puranas]] and the [[Indian epic poetry|Epics]], the meaning became refined, richer, and more complex, and the word was applied to diverse contexts.&lt;ref name=phph&gt;see:

In certain contexts, ''dharma'' designates human behaviours considered necessary for order of things in the universe, principles that prevent chaos, behaviours and action necessary to all life in nature, society, family as well as at the individual level.&lt;ref name="ODWR-Dharma" /&gt;&lt;ref name=phph/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see:

In Buddhism, ''dharma'' incorporates the teachings and doctrines of the founder of Buddhism, [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]].

==History==
According to the authoritative book ''[[History of Dharmasastra (P.V. Kane)|History of Dharmasastra]]'', in the hymns of the Rigveda the word dharma appears at least fifty-six times, as an adjective or noun. According to Paul Horsch,&lt;ref name=paulhorsch&gt;Horsch, Paul, "From Creation Myth to World Law: the Early History of Dharma", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', December 2004, Volume 32, Issue 5-6, pp. 423–448.&lt;/ref&gt; the word dharma has its origin in the myths of Vedic Hinduism. The Brahman (whom all the gods make up), claim the hymns of the Rig Veda, created the universe from chaos, they hold (dhar-) the earth and sun and stars apart, they support (dhar-) the sky away and distinct from earth, and they stabilise (dhar-) the quaking mountains and plains.&lt;ref name=paulhorsch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RgVeda 6.70.1, 8.41.10, 10.44.8, for secondary source see [[Karl Friedrich Geldner]], Der Rigveda in Auswahl (2 vols.), Stuttgart; and [[Harvard Oriental Series]], 33–36, Bd. 1–3: 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; The gods, mainly [[Indra]], then deliver and hold order from disorder, harmony from chaos, stability from instability – actions recited in the Veda with the root of word dharma.&lt;ref name=phph/&gt; In hymns composed after the mythological verses, the word dharma takes expanded meaning as a cosmic principle and appears in verses independent of gods. It evolves into a concept, claims Paul Horsch,&lt;ref name=paulhorsch/&gt; that has a dynamic functional sense in [[Atharvaveda]] for example, where it becomes the cosmic law that links cause and effect through a subject. Dharma, in these ancient texts, also takes a ritual meaning. The ritual is connected to the cosmic, and "dharmani" is equated to ceremonial devotion to the principles that gods used to create order from disorder, the world from chaos.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Horsch, "From Creation Myth to World Law: the Early History of Dharma", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', December 2004, Volume 32, Issue 5-6, pp. 430–431.&lt;/ref&gt; Past the ritual and cosmic sense of dharma that link the current world to mythical universe, the concept extends to ethical-social sense that links human beings to each other and to other life forms. It is here that dharma as a concept of law emerges in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;P. Thieme, Gedichte aus dem Rig-Veda, Reclam Universal-Bibliothek Nr. 8930, pp. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Horsch, "From Creation Myth to World Law: the Early History of Dharma", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', December 2004, Volume 32, Issue 5-6, pp. 430–432.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dharma and related words are found in the oldest Vedic literature of Hinduism, in later Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, and the Epics; the word dharma also plays a central role in the literature of other Indian religions founded later, such as Buddhism and Jainism.&lt;ref name="phph"/&gt; According to Brereton,&lt;ref name=jbrereton/&gt; ''Dharman'' occurs 63 times in [[Rigveda|Rig-veda]]; in addition, words related to Dharman also appear in Rig-veda, for example once as dharmakrt, 6 times as ''satyadharman'', and once as ''dharmavant'', 4 times as ''dharman'' and twice as ''dhariman''. 

[[Indo-European studies|Indo-European]] parallels for "Dharma" are known, but the only Iranian equivalent is Old Persian ''darmān'' "remedy", the meaning of which is rather removed from [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] ''dhárman'', suggesting that the word "Dharma" did not have a major role in the [[Indo-Iranian period|Indo-Iranian]] period, and was principally developed more recently under the Vedic tradition.&lt;ref name=jbrereton&gt;Joel Brereton (2004), "Dharman in the RgVeda", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'',  Vol. 32, [https://www.academia.edu/5993798/Dh_rman_In_The_Rgveda pp. 449–489]. "There are Indo-European parallels to dhárman (cf. Wennerberg 1981: 95f.), but the only Iranian equivalent is Old Persian darmān ‘remedy’, which has little bearing on Indo-Aryan dhárman. There is thus no evidence that IIr. *dharman was a signiﬁcant culture word during the Indo-Iranian period." (p.449) "The origin of the concept of dharman rests in its formation. It is a Vedic, rather than an Indo-Iranian word, and a more recent coinage than many other key religious terms of the Vedic tradition. Its meaning derives directly from dhr ‘support, uphold, give foundation to’ and therefore ‘foundation’ is a reasonable gloss in most of its attestations." (p.485)&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is thought that the ''[[Daena]]'' of [[Zoroastrianism]], also meaning the "eternal Law" or "religion", is related to Sanskrit "Dharma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morreall |first1=John |last2=Sonn |first2=Tamara |title=The Religion Toolkit: A Complete Guide to Religious Studies |date=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781444343717 |page=324 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aM461tmUDe4C&amp;pg=PT324 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideas in parts overlapping to ''Dharma'' are found in other ancient cultures: such as Chinese [[Tao]], Egyptian [[Maat]], Sumerian [[Me (mythology)|Me]].&lt;ref name="stevenrosen"/&gt;

===Eusebeia and dharma===
&lt;!-- "Merit § Merit-making in Buddhist societies" links here --&gt;
[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|220px|The [[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription]] is from Indian [[Emperor Asoka]] in 258 BC, and found in [[Afghanistan]]. The inscription renders the word ''Dharma'' in Sanskrit as [[Eusebeia]] in Greek, suggesting ''dharma'' in ancient India meant spiritual maturity, devotion, piety, duty towards and reverence for human community.&lt;ref name=paulhacker/&gt;]]
In mid-20th century, an inscription of the Indian [[Emperor Asoka]] from the year 258 BC was discovered in Afghanistan, the [[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription]]. This rock inscription contains [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] text. According to [[:de:Paul Hacker|Paul Hacker]],&lt;ref name=paulhacker/&gt; on the rock appears a Greek rendering for the Sanskrit word dharma: the word [[eusebeia]].&lt;ref name=paulhacker&gt;Paul Hacker (1965), "Dharma in Hinduism", ''[[Journal of Indian Philosophy]]'', Volume 34, Issue 5, pp. 479–496 (English translated version by Donald R. Davis (2006)).&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars of Hellenistic Greece explain eusebeia as a complex concept. Eusebia means not only to venerate gods, but also spiritual maturity, a reverential attitude toward life, and includes the right conduct toward one's parents, siblings and children, the right conduct between husband and wife, and the conduct between biologically unrelated people. This rock inscription, concludes Paul Hacker,&lt;ref name=paulhacker/&gt; suggests dharma in India, about 2300 years ago, was a central concept and meant not only religious ideas, but ideas of right, of good, of one's duty toward the human community.&lt;ref&gt;[[Etienne Lamotte]], Bibliotheque du Museon 43, Louvain, 1958, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rta, maya and dharma===
The evolving literature of Hinduism linked ''dharma'' to two other important concepts: ''Ṛta'' and ''Māyā''. [[Ṛta]] in Vedas is the truth and cosmic principle which regulates and coordinates the operation of the universe and everything within it.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Holdrege (2004), "Dharma" in: Mittal &amp; Thursby (Editors) The Hindu World, New York: Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-21527-7}}, pp. 213–248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=koller/&gt; [[Māyā]] in Rig-veda and later literature means illusion, fraud, deception, magic that misleads and creates disorder,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0800/mw__0844.html Māyā] Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, {{ISBN|978-8120603691}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus is contrary to reality, laws and rules that establish order, predictability and harmony. Paul Horsch&lt;ref name=paulhorsch/&gt; suggests Ṛta and dharma are parallel concepts, the former being a cosmic principle, the latter being of moral social sphere; while Māyā and dharma are also analogous concepts, the former being that which corrupts law and moral life, the later being that which strengthens law and moral life.&lt;ref name=koller&gt;Koller, J. M. (1972), "Dharma: an expression of universal order", ''Philosophy East and West'', 22(2), pp. 136–142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Northrop, F. S. C. (1949), "Naturalistic and cultural foundations for a more effective international law", ''Yale Law Journal'', 59, pp. 1430–1441.&lt;/ref&gt;

Day proposes dharma is a manifestation of Ṛta, but suggests Ṛta may have been subsumed into a more complex concept of dharma, as the idea developed in ancient India over time in a nonlinear manner.{{sfn|Day|1982|pp=42–44}} The following verse from the [[Rigveda]] is an example where ''rta'' and dharma are linked:
{{quote|O Indra, lead us on the path of Rta, on the right path over all evils...|[[Mandala 10|RV 10]].133.6}}

==Hinduism==
{{Hinduism small}}
Dharma is an organising principle in Hinduism that applies to human beings in solitude, in their interaction with human beings and nature, as well as between inanimate objects, to all of cosmos and its parts.&lt;ref name=stevenrosen/&gt; It refers to the order and customs which make life and universe possible, and includes behaviours, rituals, rules that govern society, and ethics.&lt;ref name="ODWR-Dharma" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="ODWR-Dharma"}} Hindu dharma includes the religious duties, moral rights and duties of each individual, as well as behaviours that enable social order, right conduct, and those that are virtuous.&lt;ref&gt;"Dharma", ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', 6th Ed. (2013), Columbia University Press, Gale, {{ISBN|978-0787650155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dharma, according to Van Buitenen,&lt;ref name=vanbuitenen&gt;J. A. B. Van Buitenen, "Dharma and Moksa", ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. – Jul., 1957), pp. 33–40&lt;/ref&gt; is that which all existing beings must accept and respect to sustain harmony and order in the world. It is neither the act nor the result, but the natural laws that guide the act and create the result to prevent chaos in the world. It is innate characteristic, that makes the being what it is. It is, claims Van Buitenen, the pursuit and execution of one's nature and true calling, thus playing one's role in cosmic concert. In Hinduism, it is the dharma of the bee to make honey, of cow to give milk, of sun to radiate sunshine, of river to flow.&lt;ref name=vanbuitenen/&gt; In terms of humanity, dharma is the need for, the effect of and essence of service and interconnectedness of all life.&lt;ref name=stevenrosen/&gt;&lt;ref name=paulhacker/&gt;

In Hinduism, ''dharma'' includes two aspects – ''[[sanātana dharma]]'', which is the overall, unchanging and abiding principals of dharma and is not subject to change, and ''[[yuga dharma]]'', which is valid for a [[yuga]], an epoch or age as established by Hindu tradition.

===In Vedas and Upanishads===
The [[Dharma#History|history section]] of this article discusses the development of dharma concept in Vedas. This development continued in the Upanishads and later ancient scripts of Hinduism. In Upanishads, the concept of dharma continues as universal principle of law, order, harmony, and truth. It acts as the regulatory moral principle of the Universe. It is explained as law of righteousness and equated to ''[[satya]]'' (Sanskrit: सत्यं, truth),&lt;ref name=chjo/&gt;&lt;ref name=paulh/&gt; in hymn 1.4.14 of Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, as follows:

{{quote| 
धर्मः तस्माद्धर्मात् परं नास्त्य् अथो अबलीयान् बलीयाँसमाशँसते धर्मेण यथा राज्ञैवम् ।&lt;br&gt;
यो वै स धर्मः सत्यं वै तत् तस्मात्सत्यं वदन्तमाहुर् धर्मं वदतीति धर्मं वा वदन्तँ सत्यं वदतीत्य् एतद्ध्येवैतदुभयं भवति ।।

Nothing is higher than dharma. The weak overcomes the stronger by dharma, as over a king. Truly that dharma is the Truth (''Satya''); Therefore, when a man speaks the Truth, they say, "He speaks the Dharma"; and if he speaks Dharma, they say, "He speaks the Truth!" For both are one.|[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]|1.4.xiv&lt;ref name=chjo&gt;[[Charles Johnston (Theosophist)|Charles Johnston]], The Mukhya Upanishads: Books of Hidden Wisdom, Kshetra, {{ISBN|978-1495946530}}, p. 481, for discussion: pp. 478–505.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=paulh&gt;Horsch, Paul (translated by Jarrod Whitaker), "From Creation Myth to World Law: The early history of Dharma", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', Vol 32, pp. 423–448, (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===In the Epics===
The Hindu religion and philosophy, claims [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr.|Daniel Ingalls]],&lt;ref&gt;Daniel H. H. Ingalls, "Dharma and Moksa", ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. – Jul., 1957), pp. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; places major emphasis on individual practical morality. In the Sanskrit epics, this concern is omnipresent.

In the Second Book of [[Ramayana]], for example, a peasant asks the King to do what dharma morally requires of him, the King agrees and does so even though his compliance with the law of dharma costs him dearly. Similarly, dharma is at the centre of all major events in the life of Rama, Sita, and Lakshman in Ramayana, claims Daniel Ingalls.&lt;ref name=danielingalls&gt;Daniel H. H. Ingalls, "Dharma and Moksa", ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (April – July 1957), pp. 41–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Each episode of Ramayana presents life situations and ethical questions in symbolic terms. The issue is debated by the characters, finally the right prevails over wrong, the good over evil. For this reason, in Hindu Epics, the good, morally upright, law-abiding king is referred to as "dharmaraja".&lt;ref&gt;The Mahābhārata: Book 11: The Book of the Women; Book 12: The Book of Peace, Part 1 By Johannes Adrianus Bernardus Buitenen, James L. Fitzgerald p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mahabharata]], the other major Indian epic, similarly, dharma is central, and it is presented with symbolism and metaphors. Near the end of the epic, the god Yama, referred to as dharma in the text, is portrayed as taking the form of a dog to test the compassion of Yudishthira, who is told he may not enter paradise with such an animal, but refuses to abandon his companion, for which decision he is then praised by dharma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m17/m17003.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 17: Mahaprasthanika Parva: Section 3|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value and appeal of the Mahabharata is not as much in its complex and rushed presentation of metaphysics in the 12th book, claims Ingalls,&lt;ref name=danielingalls/&gt; because Indian metaphysics is more eloquently presented in other Sanskrit scriptures; the appeal of Mahabharata, like Ramayana, is in its presentation of a series of moral problems and life situations, to which there are usually three answers given, according to Ingalls:&lt;ref name=danielingalls/&gt; one answer is of [[Bhima]], which is the answer of brute force, an individual angle representing materialism, egoism, and self; the second answer is of [[Yudhishthira]], which is always an appeal to piety and gods, of social virtue and of tradition; the third answer is of introspective [[Arjuna]], which falls between the two extremes, and who, claims Ingalls, symbolically reveals the finest moral qualities of man. The Epics of Hinduism are a symbolic treatise about life, virtues, customs, morals, ethics, law, and other aspects of dharma.&lt;ref&gt;There is considerable amount of literature on dharma-related discussion in Hindu Epics: of Egoism versus Altruism, Individualism versus Social Virtues and Tradition; for examples, see:
* Johann Jakob Meyer (1989), Sexual life in ancient India, {{ISBN|8120806387}}, Motilal Banarsidass, pp. 92–93; Quote – "In Indian literature, especially in Mahabharata over and over again is heard the energetic cry – Each is alone. None belongs to anyone else, we are all but strangers to strangers; (...), none knows the other, the self belongs only to self. Man is born alone, alone he lives, alone he dies, alone he tastes the fruit of his deeds and his ways, it is only his work that bears him company. (...) Our body and spiritual organism is ever changing; what belongs, then, to us? (...) Thus, too, there is really no teacher or leader for anyone, each is his own Guru, and must go along the road to happiness alone. Only the self is the friend of man, only the self is the foe of man; from others nothing comes to him. Therefore what must be done is to honor, to assert one's self..."; Quote – "(in parts of the epic), the most thoroughgoing egoism and individualism is stressed..."
* Raymond F. Piper (1954), "In Support of Altruism in Hinduism", ''Journal of Bible and Religion'', Vol. 22, No. 3 (Jul., 1954), pp. 178–183
* J Ganeri (2010), A Return to the Self: Indians and Greeks on Life as Art and Philosophical Therapy, Royal Institute of Philosophy supplement, 85(66), pp. 119–135.&lt;/ref&gt; There is extensive discussion of dharma at the individual level in the Epics of Hinduism, observes [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr.|Ingalls]]; for example, on free will versus destiny, when and why human beings believe in either, ultimately concluding that the strong and prosperous naturally uphold free will, while those facing grief or frustration naturally lean towards destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel H. H. Ingalls, "Dharma and Moksa", ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. – Jul., 1957), pp. 44–45; Quote – "(...)In the Epic, free will has the upper hand. Only when a man's effort is frustrated or when he is overcome with grief does he become a predestinarian (believer in destiny)."; Quote – "This association of success with the doctrine of free will or human effort (purusakara) was felt so clearly that among the ways of bringing about a king's downfall is given the following simple advice: 'Belittle free will to him, and emphasise destiny.{{'"}} (Mahabharata 12.106.20).&lt;/ref&gt; The Epics of Hinduism illustrate various aspects of dharma, they are a means of communicating dharma with metaphors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Huston Smith]], The World Religions, {{ISBN|978-0061660184}}, HarperOne (2009); For summary notes: [http://staff.gps.edu/montgomery/World%20Religions/Faiths/hinduism/Background%20to%20Hindu%20Literature.htm Background to Hindu Literature] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040922160422/http://staff.gps.edu/montgomery/World%20Religions/Faiths/hinduism/Background%20to%20Hindu%20Literature.htm |date=2004-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===According to 4th century Vatsyayana===
According to [[Klaus Klostermaier]], 4th century Hindu scholar [[Vātsyāyana]] explained dharma by contrasting it with adharma.&lt;ref name=klausk&gt;Klaus Klostermaier, A survey of Hinduism, SUNY Press, {{ISBN|0-88706-807-3}}, Chapter 3: "Hindu dharma".&lt;/ref&gt; Vātsyāyana suggested that dharma is not merely in one's actions, but also in words one speaks or writes, and in thought. According to Vātsyāyana:&lt;ref name=klausk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jha, Nyayasutras with Vatsyayana Bhasya, 2 vols, Oriental Books (1939).&lt;/ref&gt;

# Adharma of body: hinsa (violence), steya (steal, theft), pratisiddha maithuna (sexual indulgence with someone other than one's partner)
# Dharma of body: dana (charity), paritrana (succor of the distressed) and paricarana (rendering service to others)
# Adharma from words one speaks or writes: mithya (falsehood), parusa (caustic talk), sucana (calumny) and asambaddha (absurd talk)
# Dharma from words one speaks or writes: satya (truth and facts), hitavacana (talking with good intention), priyavacana (gentle, kind talk), svadhyaya (self study)
# Adharma of mind: paradroha (ill will to anyone), paradravyabhipsa (covetousness), nastikya (denial of the existence of morals and religiosity)
# Dharma of mind: daya (compassion), asprha (disinterestedness), and sraddha (faith in others)

===According to Patanjali Yoga===
In the Yoga system the dharma is real; in the Vedanta it is unreal.&lt;ref name="The yoga-system of Patanjali"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft The yoga-system of Patanjali] The ancient Hindu doctrine of concentration of mind, embracing the mnemonic rules, called Yoga-sutras, James Haughton Woods (1914), Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Dharma is part of [[yoga]], suggests Patanjali; the elements of Hindu dharma are the attributes, qualities and aspects of yoga.&lt;ref name="The yoga-system of Patanjali"/&gt; Patanjali explained dharma in two categories: ''yama'' (restraints) and ''niyama'' (observances).&lt;ref name=klausk/&gt;

The five yama, according to Patanjali, are: abstain from injury to all living creatures ([[ahimsa]]), abstain from falsehood (satya), abstain from unauthorised appropriation of things-of-value from another (acastrapurvaka), abstain from coveting or sexually cheating on your partner, and abstain from expecting or accepting gifts from others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft The yoga-system of Patanjali] Yoga-sutras, James Haughton Woods (1914), Harvard University Press, pp. 178–180.&lt;/ref&gt; The five yama apply in action, speech and mind. In explaining yama, Patanjali clarifies that certain professions and situations may require qualification in conduct. For example, a fisherman must injure a fish, but he must attempt to do this with least trauma to fish and the fisherman must try to injure no other creature as he fishes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft The yoga-system of Patanjali] Yoga-sutras, James Haughton Woods (1914), Harvard University Press, pp. 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt;

The five niyama (observances) are cleanliness by eating pure food and removing impure thoughts (such as arrogance or jealousy or pride), contentment in one's means, meditation and silent reflection regardless of circumstances one faces, study and pursuit of historic knowledge, and devotion of all actions to the Supreme Teacher to achieve perfection of concentration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft The yoga-system of Patanjali] Yoga-sutras, James Haughton Woods (1914), Harvard University Press, pp. 181–191.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources===
Dharma is an empirical and experiential inquiry for every man and woman, according to some texts of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=paulhacker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kumarila, Tantravarttika, Anandasramasamskrtagranthavalih, Vol. 97, pp. 204–205; For an English Translation, see Jha (1924), Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. 161, Vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Apastamba|Apastamba Dharmasutra]] states:

{{quote| ''Dharma'' and ''Adharma'' do not go around saying, "That is us." Neither do gods, nor gandharvas, nor ancestors declare what is ''Dharma'' and what is ''Adharma''.| ''Apastamba Dharmasutra''&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Olivelle|Olivelle, Patrick]]. ''Dharmasūtras: The Law Codes of Ancient India''. Oxford World Classics, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other texts, three sources and means to discover dharma in Hinduism are described. These, according to [[:de:Paul Hacker|Paul Hacker]], are:&lt;ref name=ph79/&gt; First, learning historical knowledge such as Vedas, Upanishads, the Epics and other Sanskrit literature with the help of one's teacher. Second, observing the behavior and example of good people. The third source applies when neither one's education nor example exemplary conduct is known. In this case, "[[atmatusti]]" is the source of dharma in Hinduism, that is the good person reflects and follows what satisfies his heart, his own inner feeling, what he feels driven to.&lt;ref name=ph79&gt;Paul Hacker (1965), "Dharma in Hinduism", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', Volume 34, Issue 5, pp. 487–489 (English translated version by Donald R. Davis (2006)).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dharma, life stages and social stratification===
{{main article|Ashrama (stage)|Puruṣārtha|l1=Āśrama}}
Some texts of Hinduism outline ''dharma'' for society and at the individual level. Of these, the most cited one is ''[[Manusmriti]]'', which describes the four ''Varnas'', their rights and duties.&lt;ref name=alfh&gt;[[Alf Hiltebeitel]] (2011), ''Dharma: Its Early History in Law, Religion, and Narrative'', {{ISBN|978-0195394238}}, Oxford University Press, pp. 215–227.&lt;/ref&gt; Most texts of Hinduism, however, discuss ''dharma'' with no mention of ''Varna'' ([[Caste system in India|caste]]).&lt;ref&gt;Thapar, R. (1995), The first millennium BC in northern India, Recent perspectives of early Indian history, 80–141.&lt;/ref&gt; Other dharma texts and Smritis differ from Manusmriti on the nature and structure of Varnas.&lt;ref name=alfh/&gt; Yet, other texts question the very existence of varna. [[Bhrigu]], in the Epics, for example, presents the theory that dharma does not require any varnas.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas R. Trautmann (1964), "On the Translation of the Term Varna", ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient'', Vol. 7, No. 2 (Jul., 1964), pp. 196–201.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, medieval India is widely believed to be a socially stratified society, with each social strata inheriting a profession and being endogamous. Varna was not absolute in Hindu dharma; individuals had the right to renounce and leave their Varna, as well as their [[Ashrama (stage)|asramas]] of life, in search of moksa.&lt;ref name=alfh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see:

(1972), "Dharma: an expression of universal order", ''Philosophy East and West'', 22(2), pp. 131–144.&lt;/ref&gt; While neither Manusmriti nor succeeding Smritis of Hinduism ever use the word varnadharma (that is, the dharma of varnas), or varnasramadharma (that is, the dharma of varnas and asramas), the scholarly commentary on Manusmriti use these words, and thus associate dharma with varna system of India.&lt;ref name=alfh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kane, P.V. (1962), History of Dharmasastra (Ancient and Medieval Religious and Civil Law in India), Volume 1, pp. 2–10.&lt;/ref&gt; In 6th century India, even Buddhist kings called themselves "protectors of varnasramadharma" – that is, dharma of varna and asramas of life.&lt;ref name=alfh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olivelle, P. (1993). ''The Asrama System: The history and hermeneutics of a religious institution'', New York: [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

At the individual level, some texts of Hinduism outline [[Ashrama (stage)|four āśrama]]s, or stages of life as individual's dharma. These are:&lt;ref&gt;Alban G. Widgery, "The Principles of Hindu Ethics", ''International Journal of Ethics'', Vol. 40, No. 2 (Jan., 1930), pp. 232–245.&lt;/ref&gt; (1) [[Brahmacharya|brahmacārya]], the life of preparation as a student, (2) [[Grihastha|gṛhastha]], the life of the householder with family and other social roles, (3) [[Vanaprastha|vānprastha]] or aranyaka, the life of the forest-dweller, transitioning from worldly occupations to reflection and renunciation, and (4) [[sannyāsa]], the life of giving away all property, becoming a recluse and devotion to moksa, spiritual matters.

The four stages of life complete the four human strivings in life, according to Hinduism.&lt;ref name=jkkpwg/&gt; Dharma enables the individual to satisfy the striving for stability and order, a life that is lawful and harmonious, the striving to do the right thing, be good, be virtuous, earn religious merit, be helpful to others, interact successfully with society. The other three strivings are [[Artha]] – the striving for means of life such as food, shelter, power, security, material wealth, etc.; [[Kama]] – the striving for sex, desire, pleasure, love, emotional fulfillment, etc.; and [[Moksa]] – the striving for spiritual meaning, liberation from life-rebirth cycle, self-realisation in this life, etc. The four stages are neither independent nor exclusionary in Hindu dharma.&lt;ref name=jkkpwg&gt;see:

===Dharma and poverty===
Dharma while being necessary for individual and society, is dependent on poverty and prosperity in a society, according to Hindu dharma scriptures. For example, according to Adam Bowles,&lt;ref name=adambowles&gt;Adam Bowles (2007), Dharma, Disorder, and the Political in Ancient India, Brill's Indological Library (Book 28), {{ISBN|978-9004158153}}, Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] 11.1.6.24 links social prosperity and ''dharma'' through water. Waters come from rains, it claims; when rains are abundant there is prosperity on the earth, and this prosperity enables people to follow Dharma – moral and lawful life. In times of distress, of drought, of poverty, everything suffers including relations between human beings and the human ability to live according to dharma.&lt;ref name=adambowles/&gt;

In Rajadharmaparvan 91.34-8, the relationship between poverty and dharma reaches a full circle. A land with less moral and lawful life suffers distress, and as distress rises it causes more immoral and unlawful life, which further increases distress.&lt;ref name=adambowles/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Derrett, J. D. M. (1959), "Bhu-bharana, bhu-palana, bhu-bhojana: an Indian conundrum", Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, 22, pp. 108–123.&lt;/ref&gt; Those in power must follow the raja dharma (that is, dharma of rulers), because this enables the society and the individual to follow dharma and achieve prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Gonda]], "Ancient Indian Kingship from the Religious Point of View", ''Numen'', Vol. 3, Issue 1 (Jan., 1956), pp. 36–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dharma and law===
{{main article|Hindu law}}
The notion of ''dharma'' as duty or propriety is found in India's ancient legal and religious texts. In Hindu philosophy, justice, social harmony, and happiness requires that people live per dharma. The [[Dharmashastra]] is a record of these guidelines and rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gächter|first=Othmar|title=Anthropos|journal=Anthropos institute|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The available evidence suggest India once had a large collection of dharma related literature (sutras, shastras); four of the sutras survive and these are now referred to as Dharmasutras.&lt;ref name=polivelle/&gt; Along with laws of Manu in Dharmasutras, exist parallel and different compendium of laws, such as the laws of Narada and other ancient scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Davis, Jr., "A Realist View of Hindu Law", ''Ratio Juris''. Vol. 19 No. 3 September 2006, pp. 287–313.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lariviere, Richard W. (2003), The Naradasmrti, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass&lt;/ref&gt; These different and conflicting law books are neither exclusive, nor do they supersede other sources of dharma in Hinduism. These Dharmasutras include instructions on education of the young, their rites of passage, customs, religious rites and rituals, marital rights and obligations, death and ancestral rites, laws and administration of justice, crimes, punishments, rules and types of evidence, duties of a king, as well as morality.&lt;ref name=polivelle&gt;Patrick Olivelle (1999), ''The Dharmasutras: The law codes of ancient India'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-283882-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{anchor|Buddhism}}
{{Buddhism}}
In Buddhism ''dharma'' means cosmic law and order,&lt;ref name="ODWR-Dharma" /&gt; but is also applied to the teachings of the Buddha.&lt;ref name="ODWR-Dharma" /&gt; In [[Buddhist philosophy]], ''dhamma/dharma'' is also the term for "[[phenomena]]".&lt;ref name="david"/&gt; In East Asia, the translation for dharma is [[wiktionary:法|法]], pronounced ''fǎ'' in Mandarin, ''choe ཆོས་'' in Tibetan, ''beop'' in Korean, ''hō'' in Japanese, and ''pháp'' in Vietnamese. However, the term dharma can also be transliterated from its original form.  

===Buddha's teachings===
&lt;!--"Sacca-kiriya" links here. Please adjust link there if this section is removed or renamed. Thanks.--&gt;
For practicing Buddhists, references to "dharma" (''dhamma'' in Pali) particularly as "the Dharma", generally means the teachings of the Buddha, commonly known throughout the East as Buddha-Dharma. It includes especially the discourses on the fundamental principles (such as the [[Four Noble Truths]] and the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]), as opposed to the parables and to the poems.

The status of Dharma is regarded variably by different Buddhist traditions. Some regard it as an ultimate truth, or as the fount of all things which lie beyond the "[[three realms]]" (Sanskrit: ''tridhatu'') and the "wheel of becoming" (Sanskrit: ''[[bhavachakra]]''), somewhat like the pagan Greek and Christian [[logos]]: this is known as ''[[Dharmakaya]]'' (Sanskrit). Others, who regard the Buddha as simply an enlightened human being, see the Dharma as the [[essence]] of the "84,000 different aspects of the teaching" (Tibetan: ''chos-sgo brgyad-khri bzhi strong'') that the Buddha gave to various types of people, based upon their individual propensities and capabilities.

Dharma refers not only to the sayings of the Buddha, but also to the later traditions of interpretation and addition that the various [[schools of Buddhism]] have developed to help explain and to expand upon the Buddha's teachings. For others still, they see the Dharma as referring to the "truth", or the ultimate reality of "the way that things really are" (Tib. Cho).

The Dharma is one of the [[Three Jewels]] of Buddhism in which practitioners of Buddhism seek refuge, or that upon which one relies for his or her lasting happiness. The Three Jewels of Buddhism are the [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], meaning the mind's perfection of enlightenment, the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]], meaning the teachings and the methods of the Buddha, and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], meaning the monastic community who provide guidance and support to followers of the Buddha.

===Chan Buddhism===
Dharma is employed in [[Ch'an]] in a specific context in relation to transmission of authentic doctrine, understanding and bodhi; recognised in [[Dharma transmission]].

==Jainism==
{{Main article|Dharma (Jainism)}}
[[File:Jain Prateek Chihna.svg|thumb|140px|Jainism]]

The word Dharma in Jainism is found in all its key texts. It has a contextual meaning and refers to a number of ideas. In the broadest sense, it means the teachings of the Jinas,&lt;ref name="ODWR-Dharma" /&gt; or teachings of any competing spiritual school,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John E. |last=Cort|title=Jains in the World: Religious Values and Ideology in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PZk-4HOMzsoC&amp;pg=PA192 |year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803037-9|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; a supreme path,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter B. Clarke|author2=Peter Beyer|title=The World's Religions: Continuities and Transformations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rBgn3xB75ZcC |year=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-135-21100-4|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt; socio-religious duty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Torkel |last=Brekke|title=Makers of Modern Indian Religion in the Late Nineteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D6YUDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124 |year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-925236-7|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that which is the highest ''mangala'' (holy).&lt;ref name="Cort2001p192"&gt;{{cite book|first=John E. |last=Cort|title=Jains in the World: Religious Values and Ideology in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PZk-4HOMzsoC&amp;pg=PA192 |year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803037-9|pages=192–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''dharma'' also has a specific [[ontology|ontological]] and soteriological meaning in Jainism, as a part of its theory of six [[dravya (Jainism)|dravya]] (substance or a reality). In the Jain tradition, existence consists of ''jiva'' (soul, atman) and ''ajiva'' (non-soul), the latter consisting of five categories: inert non-sentient atomic matter (pudgala), space (akasha), time (kala), principle of motion (dharma), and principle of rest (adharma).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John E. |last=Cort|title=Open Boundaries: Jain Communities and Cultures in Indian History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WWfnXbVWjKcC |year=1998|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-3786-5|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dundas2003p93"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas|authorlink=Paul Dundas|title=The Jains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93 |year=2003|edition=2|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415266055|pages=93–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term ''dharma'' to mean motion and to refer to an ontological sub-category is peculiar to Jainism, and not found in the metaphysics of Buddhism and various schools of Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Dundas2003p93"/&gt;

The major [[Jain text]], ''Tattvartha Sutra'' mentions ''Das-dharma'' with the meaning of "ten righteous virtues". These are forbearance, modesty, straightforwardness, purity, truthfulness, self-restraint, austerity, renunciation, non-attachment, and celibacy.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=128}} Acārya Amṛtacandra, author of the Jain text, ''Puruṣārthasiddhyupāya'' writes:{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=22}}
{{quote|A right believer should constantly meditate on virtues of dharma, like supreme modesty, in order to protect the soul from all contrary dispositions. He should also cover up the shortcomings of others.|''Puruṣārthasiddhyupāya'' (27)}}

==Sikhism==
[[File:Khanda Orange.jpg|thumb|140px|Sikhism]]
{{main article|Sikhism}}
For [[Sikh]]s, the word ''Dharm'' means the path of righteousness and proper religious practice.&lt;ref name=rinehart138&gt;Rinehart, Robin (2014), in Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech (Editors), ''The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies'', {{ISBN|978-0199699308}}, [[Oxford University Press]], pp. 138–139.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guru Granth Sahib]] in hymn 1353 connotes dharma as duty.&lt;ref&gt;W. Owen Cole (2014), in Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech (Editors), ''The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies'', {{ISBN|978-0199699308}}, Oxford University Press, pp. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[3HO]] movement in Western culture, which has incorporated certain Sikh beliefs, defines Sikh Dharma broadly as all that constitutes religion, moral duty and way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Verne Dusenbery (2014), in Pashaura Singh and Louis E. Fenech (Editors), ''The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies'', {{ISBN|978-0199699308}}, Oxford University Press, pp. 560–568.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dharma in symbols==
[[File:Flag of India.svg|thumb|200px|The wheel in the centre of India's flag symbolises Dharma.]]
The importance of ''dharma'' to Indian sentiments is illustrated by India's decision in 1947 to include the [[Ashoka Chakra]], a depiction of the ''[[dharmachakra]]'' ( the "wheel of dharma"),  as the central motif on its flag.&lt;ref&gt;Narula, S. (2006), ''International Journal of Constitutional Law'', 4(4), pp. 741–751.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3356">'''Dow Jones News/Retrieval''' was an [[online service]] offered by [[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] beginning in 1973, which greatly expanded its subscriber numbers during the 1980s. It focused on financial information offering access to securities prices including quotes on stocks, bonds, options and mutual funds as well as a news data base with items culled from [[The Wall Street Journal]], [[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]] and other sources, as well as sports reports, movie reviews, encyclopedia, electronic shopping, and email.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iC4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA54 Review: Dow Jones News/Retrieval], ''[[Infoworld]]'', April 30, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;James C.

In the 1990s it also provided access to articles from ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/07/business/times-news-service-on-line.html Times News Service on Line], ''The New York Times'', December 7, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Westlaw]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/18/business/company-news-dow-jones-and-west-to-link-data-services.html Dow Jones and West to Link Data Services], ''The New York Times'', May 18, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fees for using the service were relatively expensive. It cost $30 to subscribe followed by a $12 annual membership fee. Additionally, prime-time usage charges were $2.30 per minute&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt; and after-hours access was 44 cents a minute for basic services and general information, and $1.76 a minute for detailed reports such as S.E.C. filings. "Blue Chip" and "Executive" discount plans were available for users who spent a lot of time on the service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/01/business/the-executive-computer-headlines-and-stock-quotes-on-call.html?pagewanted=all The Executive Computer: Headlines and Stock Quotes on Call], ''The New York Times'', November 1, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 1990s, the strategy was changed to provide access to the service to a broader business audience and the pricing was simplified, new software and web-based access was launched and the company became more customer-focused under Timothy M. Andrews, a longtime Dow Jones editorial, technology and marketing executive.  The name was changed to Dow Jones Interactive, and the $125 million revenue business was later merged into [[Factiva]].

Dow Jones Interactive was shut down on June 30, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/News/News-Item/Factiva-Completes-Upgrade-of-Customers-To-New-Factiva-Products-4646.htm Factiva Completes Upgrade of Customers To New Factiva Products], ''[[EContent]]'', July 8, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Arkansas}}
The '''''Encyclopedia of Arkansas History &amp; Culture''''' ('''''EOA''''') is a [[World Wide Web|web]]-based [[encyclopedia]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Arkansas]], described by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) as "a free, authoritative source information about the [[History of Arkansas|history]], [[Politics and government of Arkansas|politics]], [[Geography of Arkansas|geography]], and [[Culture of Arkansas|culture]] of the state of Arkansas."&lt;ref&gt;[http://edsitement.neh.gov/websites/encyclopedia-arkansas-history-and-culture  EDSITEment: The Best of the Humanities on the Web: Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture], [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The encyclopedia is a project of the [[Butler Center for Arkansas Studies]] at the  [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]]-based [[Central Arkansas Library System]].&lt;ref name="Millar"&gt;Lindsey Millar, [http://www.arktimes.com/arkansas/from-civil-rights-to-slime-molds-the-encyclopedia-of-arkansas-has-all-of-arkansas-covered/Content?oid=3403218 From civil rights to slime molds, the Encyclopedia of Arkansas has all of Arkansas covered with more than 3,600 entries], ''[[Arkansas Times]]'' (July 30, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  CALS has pledged to keep the EOA in operation in perpetuity.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

The project was officially launched in 2006 with 700 entries and 900 [[multimedia]] items.&lt;ref name="Millar"/&gt; By June 2014, it had grown to more than 3,600 entries and 5,000 multimedia items;&lt;ref name="Millar"/&gt; {{as of|2017|lc=y}}, the site had more than 5,000 entries and 6,700 pieces of media.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/about/ | title=About the Encyclopedia | publisher=Butler Center for Arkansas Studies at the Central Arkansas Library System (CALS) | accessdate=January 24, 2018 | location=Little Rock, Arkansas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has a staff of five,&lt;ref name="Staff"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/about/staff.aspx  | title=Staff | publisher=Butler Center for Arkansas Studies at the Central Arkansas Library System (CALS) | accessdate=January 24, 2018 | location=Little Rock, Arkansas}}&lt;/ref&gt; from four in 2014; articles are written by volunteer contributors who receive a payment of 5 cents per word.&lt;ref name="Millar"/&gt; Tom W.

'''''Từ điển bách khoa Việt Nam''''' (Literally ''Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Vietnam'')  is a state-sponsored [[Vietnamese language]] encyclopedia that was published in [[Vietnam]] in 2005.

It is the first state encyclopedia of the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]]. The compilation process began in 1987 and was completed in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;E. Ulrich Kratz Southeast Asian Languages and Literatures: A Bibliographic Guide ... 1996 - Page 393 ''Từ điển bách khoa Việt Nam''.&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition, published in 2005 by [[Vietnam's Encyclopedia Publishing House]], has four volumes consisting of 40,000 entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://english.vov.vn/culture/vietnamese-encyclopedia-published-38850.vov |publisher=VOVNews |accessdate=2018-08-14 |title=Vietnamese encyclopedia published |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727022603/http://english.vovnews.vn/Home/Vietnamese-encyclopedia-published/20061/38850.vov |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arranged by [[Vietnamese alphabet|Vietnamese-alphabet]] order, the encyclopedia covers topics from historical to child rearing. Since then, it has been converted to electronic versions (CD and ebook) and a free online version.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2874">'''''Enderûn''''' ({{lang-ota|اندرون}}, from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''andarûn'', "inside") was the term used in the [[Ottoman Empire]] to designate the "Interior Service" of the Imperial Court, concerned with the private service of the [[Ottoman Sultans]], as opposed to the state-administrative "Exterior Service" (''[[Birûn]]'').{{sfn|Parry|1965|pp=697–698}} Its name derives from the location of the Sultan's apartments in the inner courts of the [[Topkapi Palace]]; its head was the [[Kapi Agha]].{{sfn|Parry|1965|pp=697–698}}

The Inner Service was divided into four departments. In descending order of importance, these were the Privy Chamber (''Hass Oda''), the Treasury (''Hazine''), the Privy Larder (''Kilar-ı Hass''), and the Great and Little Chambers (''Büyük ve Küçük Odalar'').{{sfn|Bosworth|1965|p=1097}} Among the responsibilities of the Inner Service was also the running of the [[Enderun School|palace school]],{{sfn|Parry|1965|pp=697–698}} where selected young Christian boys, gathered through the ''[[devşirme]]'' system (from the 17th century, however, Muslim boys were also admitted) were trained for the highest state offices. These boys served then as pages in the Inner Service, and were known as ''[[içoğlan]]ı'' ("lads of the interior").{{sfn|Lewis|Ménage|Pellat|Schacht|1971|p=1006}}

The Inner Service was also notable for its employment of [[deaf-mute]]s (''dilsiz''), at least from the time of [[Mehmed II]], to the end of the empire. They acted as guards and attendants, and due to their particular nature were often entrusted with highly confidential assignments, including executions.{{sfn|Lewis|1965|p=277}} Their number varied but they were never numerous; they had their own uniforms, their own heads (''başdilsiz''), and although many were literate, they also communicated in their own special [[sign language]].{{sfn|Lewis|1965|p=277}}

'''Espacenet''' (formerly often written as ''esp@cenet'')&lt;ref&gt;''esp@cenet'' is a trademark of the European Patent Organisation (see community trade marks No: 001123876, 000881896, 000881813 on [http://oami.europa.eu/CTMOnline/RequestManager/en_SearchBasic_NoReg ''CTM-ONLINE – Trade mark consultation service – Basic'']).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.epo.org/projects/babylon/eponet.nsf/0/9BA3D3AA8CE3B9BBC125785700578B40/$File/Patentinfo_News_1101_en.pdf The "@" in esp@cenet – an old friend retires], [[Patent Information News]] issue 1/2011, March 2011, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; is a free [[Internet|online]] service for searching patents and [[patent application]]s. Espacenet was developed by the [[European Patent Organisation|European Patent Office]] (EPO) together with the member states of the [[European Patent Organisation]].  Most member states have an Espacenet service in their national [[language]], and access to the EPO's worldwide [[database]], most of which is in English. In 2015, the Espacenet worldwide service claimed to have records on more than 90 million patent publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epo.org/searching/free/espacenet.html |title=Espacenet |website=EPO web site |publisher=European Patent Office (EPO) |quote=Espacenet offers free access to more than 90 million patent documents worldwide, containing information about inventions and technical developments from 1836 to today. |accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

By launching Espacenet in 1998, the EPO is said to have "revolutionized public access to international patent information, releasing patent data from its paper prisons and changing forever how patents are disseminated, organized, searched, and retrieved."&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. White, [http://www.istl.org/06-summer/electronic3.html "''Espacenet'' Europe's Network of Patent Databases"], Issues in Science &amp; Technology Librarianship ({{ISSN|1092-1206}}), Number 47, Summer 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, i.e. in the early years of Espacenet, Nancy Lambert considered that, although free, Espacenet, like the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) database of US patents, "still tend[ed] to have primitive search engines and in some cases rather cumbersome mechanisms to download patents."&lt;ref name="Lambert 2004"&gt;Lambert, N. (2004). ''[https://www.infonortics.com/chemical/ch04/slides/lambert-new.pdf Internet patent information in the 21st century: A comparison of Delphion, Micropatent, and QPAT]'', 2004 International Chemical Information Conference &amp; Exhibition, Annecy, France, 17–20 October 2004, pp 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; She reported it as being deliberate, on the part of the USPTO and EPO, "who have said they do not wish to compete unfairly with commercial vendors".&lt;ref name="Lambert 2004"/&gt; In 2009, Espacenet offered the so-called SmartSearch which allows a query to be composed using a subset of [[Contextual Query Language]] (CQL).&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.epo.org/projects/babylon/eponet.nsf/0/D5FC4FA7011B38ADC12577FC00383121/$File/Patentinfo_News_1004_en.pdf Patentinfo News issue 4 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the EPO launched "Patent Translate", a free online automatic translation service for patents. Created in partnership with [[Google]], the translation engine was "specifically built to handle complex and technical patent vocabulary", using "millions of official, human-translated patent documents" to train the translation engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/about-us/annual-reports-statistics/annual-report/2012/highlights/patenttranslate.html|title=Highlights of 2012, Launch of Patent Translate|date=4 March 2013|publisher=European Patent Office|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covers translations between English and 31 other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/searching/free/patent-translate.html|title=Patent Translate|date=20 December 2013|publisher=European Patent Office|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Patent Information News]]''' magazine published by the EPO, a 2013 independent study compared Espacenet with DepatisNet, Freepatentsonline, [[Google Patent]] and the public search facility at the [[USPTO]]. In that study, Espacenet reportedly obtained the highest score for both data coverage and customer support, and the best overall aggregated score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Espacenet comes out top in study |journal=Patent Information News |issue=2, June 2013 |page=2 |publisher=European Patent Office |url=http://documents.epo.org/projects/babylon/eponet.nsf/0/56B4E29D008538E9C1257B8D0058BD48/$FILE/Patentinfo_News_0213_en.pdf |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, Espacenet began offering [[full-text search]] through its collection of English, French and German patent documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2016|title=Full-text searching in Espacenet|journal=Patent Information News|publisher=European Patent Office|issue=1/2016|page=6|url=http://documents.epo.org/projects/babylon/eponet.nsf/0/10397BC8E8C8FE2BC1257F7A0047E766/$File/patent_information_news_0116_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fatwā''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|æ|t|w|ɑː}}; {{lang-ar|فتوى}}; plural '''''fatāwā''''' {{lang|ar| فتاوى}}) in the [[Islamic]] faith is a nonbinding but authoritative legal opinion or learned interpretation that the [[Sheikhul Islam]], a qualified jurist or [[mufti]], can give on issues pertaining to the [[Sharia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hallaq|first=Wael B.|title=Fatwa|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3424600948.html|work=Encyclopedia of the Modern Middle East and North Africa|publisher=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The person who issues a fatwā is called, in that respect, a ''mufti'', i.e. an issuer of fatwā, from the verb أَفْتَى ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;aftā'' = "he gave a formal legal opinion on". This is not necessarily a formal position since most Muslims argue that anyone trained in Islamic law may give an opinion (fatwā) on its teachings. If a fatwā does not break new ground, then it is simply called a ''ruling''.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar, Neil. "The media relations department of Hizbollah wishes you to die: Unexpected encounters in the changing Middle East", PublicAffairs, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-58648-635-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analogy might be made to the issue of [[legal opinion]]s from courts in [[common law|common-law]] systems. Fatwās generally contain the details of the scholar's reasoning, typically in response to a particular case, and are considered binding precedent by those Muslims who have bound themselves to that scholar, including future muftis; mere rulings can be compared to [[memorandum opinion]]s. The primary difference between common-law opinions and fatwās, however, is that fatwās are not universally binding; as [[Sharia]] is not universally consistent and Islam is very non-hierarchical in structure, fatwās do not carry the sort of weight as that of secular common-law opinion.

==Practice==

In a religious context, the word fatwā can carry more meaning. Oftentimes, when a Muslim has a question that they need to be answered from an Islamic point of view, they ask an Islamic scholar this question. The answer is commonly known as a fatwā, which typically carries more weight than the opinion of a lay Muslim. Muslim scholars are expected to give their fatwā based on religious scripture as opposed to personal belief. Therefore, their fatwā is sometimes regarded as a religious ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.islamicsupremecouncil.org/understanding-islam/legal-rulings/44-what-is-a-fatwa.html|title=What is a Fatwa?|last=Administrator|website=www.islamicsupremecouncil.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a fatwā may be the following: Muslims are expected to pray five times every day at specific times during the day. A practicing Muslim who is going to be on a 12-hour flight may not feel that they are able to perform their prayers on time; therefore, they might ask a Muslim scholar for a fatwā on what is the appropriate thing to do. The scholar would provide a response and support it with Muslim scripture. The fatwā is not legally binding or final; it is a respected interpretation of the sharia given by a mufti on a particular case. If the individual is not content with the fatwā given, they can seek out another Mufti or Qadi for a second opinion which might have the desired outcome.

In Islam, there are four sources from which Muslim scholars extract religious law or rulings, and upon which they base their fatwā. The first is the [[Quran]], which is the holy book of Islam, and which Muslims believe is the direct and literal word of God, revealed to Prophet Mohammad. The second source is the [[Sunnah]], which incorporates anything that the Prophet Mohammad said, did or approved of. The third source is the consensus of the scholars, meaning that if the scholars of a previous generation have all agreed on a certain issue, then this consensus is regarded as representing Islam. Finally, if no scripture is found regarding a specific question from the three first sources, then an Islamic scholar performs what is known as [[ijtihad]]. This means that they use their own logic and reasoning to come up with the best answer according to the best of their ability.
Muslims believe that any given action that they perform in their lives falls into one of five categories:
# [[Fard|واجب / فرض (farḍ/wājib)]] – "Compulsory"/"duty"
# [[mustahabb|مستحب (mustaḥabb)]] – Recommended, "desirable"
# [[mubah|مباح (mubāḥ)]] – Neutral, "permissible"
# [[makruh|مكروه (makrūh)]] – Disliked, "hated"
# حرام (ḥarām) – Sinful, "prohibited"
All actions fall into the "permissible" category, unless there is evidence from one of the four sources previously mentioned (Quran, Sunnah, Consensus, Ijtihad) that proves otherwise. Here are some examples:

* The five daily prayers are obligatory upon Muslims. Those who do not perform them are committing a sin, and they will be accountable for that on the day of judgment.
* Performing additional voluntary prayers is commendable. Those who perform them will be rewarded, but those who do not are not committing a sin.
* Driving an electric car is permissible, meaning that the action of driving is not good or bad in itself. There is no sin or reward attached to it. Most things fall under this category.
* Divorce is a despised action. Although there is no sin associated with it, it must only be considered as a last resort when all other means of solving the problems between the spouses have been exhausted.
* Drinking alcoholic drinks is not permitted. Those who do so are committing a sin, and will be held accountable for it on the day of judgment.
When someone asks a Muslim scholar about performing a specific action, the reply will be a fatwa explaining which of these five categories this action would fall under. So if you ask a Muslim scholar to give a fatwa about adultery, they would tell you that it is "Not Permitted". If you ask about fasting in Ramadan, they would answer that it is "Obligatory". Muslims are usually encouraged to ask for reasoning and evidence behind any fatwa, and should avoid blindly following the opinions of Muslim scholars without understanding the reasons behind them. This is because Muslims should always feel that they are practicing Islam to gain the pleasure of God, and not to gain the pleasure of acceptance of any human being.  
Different scholars frequently have different opinions regarding any given question. This is why there is usually more than one fatwa regarding any one question. In fact, there are a number of methodologies for how to understand evidence gathered from the previously mentioned sources of Islamic law. Scholars who follow different methodologies will frequently arrive at different answers to the same question. It is well known that in Islam there are four [[schools of thought]], and each of them differ with respect to certain aspects. However, these differences are usually about minor issues. For example, in terms of beliefs, the vast majority of Muslims agree on most aspects of belief, most importantly the concept of monotheism, and belief in the angels, Prophets, holy books and the [[Day of Judgment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.questionsaboutislam.com/shariah-islamic-law/what-is-a-fatwa.php|title=What is a fatwa?

==History==
In the early days of [[Islam]], fatwās were pronounced by distinguished scholars to provide guidance to other scholars, judges and citizens on how subtle points of Islamic law should be understood, interpreted or applied. There were strict rules on who was eligible to issue a valid fatwā and who could not, as well as on the conditions the fatwā must satisfy to be valid.

According to the ''[[usul al-fiqh]]'' (principles of jurisprudence), the fatwā must meet the following conditions in order to be valid:
# The fatwā is in line with relevant legal proofs, deduced from Qur'anic verses and a hadith; provided the hadith was not later abrogated by [[Muhammad]].
# It is issued by a person (or a board) having due knowledge and sincerity of heart;
# It is free from individual opportunism, and not depending on political servitude;
# It is adequate with the needs of the contemporary world.

With the existence of modern independent states, each with its own legislative system, or its own body of [[ulama]]s, each country develops and applies its own rules, based on its own interpretation of religious prescriptions. Many [[Majority Muslim countries|Muslim countries]] (such as [[Egypt]] and [[Tunisia]]) have an official [[mufti]] position; a distinguished expert in the [[sharia]] is appointed to this position by the civil authorities of the country. But his fatwās are binding on no one: neither the state that appoints him, nor any citizen.

===Online fatwa===
Fatwas have been transmitted by publication, "in collections of individual muftis, in annual fatwa collections, ... or in special religious columns of periodicals and newspapers".&lt;ref name="Marcotte-31"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marcotte|first1=Roxanne D.|editor1-last=Coleman|editor1-first=Elizabeth Burns|editor2-last=White|editor2-first=Kevin|title=Medicine, Religion, and the Body|date=2010|publisher=BRILL|pages=31–2|accessdate=4 November 2015|chapter=2.  The 'Religionated' Body: Fatwas and Body Parts}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Starting in the 1990s, online fatwa services such as [[IslamQA.info]], fatwa-online.com, and AskImam.org became available, making the searching and finding of fatwas on different subjects even easier. According to at least one source ([[Sadakat Kadri]]), these sources reintroduced the advice of trained scholars to many Muslims who had turned to do-it-yourself religious interpretation, but also changed the nature of fatwa advice giving, which had traditionally been local and so "relatively confidential and conditioned by customs familiar to both parties".&lt;ref name="kadri-208"/&gt; Scholars from Cairo and Saudi Arabia exported their views to mostly (over 80%) non-Arab Muslim world. Muslims are able to observe differences in opinions among scholars of different fatwa sites and to "contemplate previously unimagined dilemmas and temptations".&lt;ref name="kadri-208"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kadri|first1=Sadakat|title=Heaven on Earth: A Journey Through Shari'a Law from the Deserts of Ancient Arabia ...|date=2012|publisher=macmillan|isbn=9780099523277|page=208|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztCRZOhJ10wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Heaven+on+Earth:+A+Journey+Through+Shari%27a+Law&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMIob7syrnZxwIVhg6SCh0fYg3Z#v=onepage&amp;q=Heaven%20on%20Earth%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Shari'a%20Law&amp;f=false|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issuer qualifications==
{{see also|Ijazah|Madrasah}}

During what is often referred to as the [[Islamic Golden Age]], in order for a scholar to be qualified to issue a fatwā, it was required that he obtained an ''[[Ijazah|ijazat attadris wa'l-ifta]]'' ("license to teach and issue legal opinions") from a [[Madrasah]] in the medieval Islamic [[legal education]] system, which was developed by the 9th century during the formation of the ''[[Madh'hab]]'' legal schools.&lt;ref name=Makdisi&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Makdisi|first=George|title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=109|issue=2|date=April–June 1989|pages=175–182 [175–77]|doi=10.2307/604423|jstor=604423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the primary issuers of fatwas were [[Muftis]], who were scholars in [[Islam]]. Their job was to interpret [[Shari'a]] and they did so within their own communities. Their authority in law and their ability to issue fatwas was entirely based on their reputation and social standing.

In post-colonial Middle Eastern states, the issuing of Fatwas moved away from the [[Ancien Regime]] practice of coming from a [[Mufti]] and instead became much more centralized as governments did so. The state department gained the control over appointing [[Muftis]] and the fatwas they were allowed to issue to the public. This did cause some discourse among the public, because of the governments involvement in religious matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cleveland |first=William L. |authorlink= |title=A History of the Modern Middle East |year=2013 |publisher=Westview Press |page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National level==
In nations where [[sharia|Islamic law]] is the basis of civil law, but has not been codified, as is the case of some Arab countries in the [[Middle East]], fatāwā by the national religious leadership are debated prior to being issued. In theory, such fatāwā should rarely be contradictory. If two fatāwā are potentially contradictory, the ruling bodies (combined civil and religious law) would attempt to define a compromise interpretation that will eliminate the resulting ambiguity. In these cases, the national theocracies expect fatwā to be settled law.

In the majority of Arab countries, however, Islamic law has been codified in each country according to its own rules, and is interpreted by the judicial system according to the national jurisprudence. Fatāwā have no direct place in the system, except to clarify very unusual or subtle points of law for experts (not covered by the provisions of modern civil law), or to give [[moral authority]] to a given interpretation of a rule.
 
In nations where Islamic law is not the basis of law (as is the case in various Asian and African countries), different [[mujtahid]]s can issue contradictory fatāwā. In such cases, Muslims would typically honour the fatwā deriving from the leadership of their religious tradition. For example, [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Muslims would favor a Sunni fatwā whereas [[Shi'a Islam|Shiites]] would follow a Shi'a one.

There exists no international Islamic authority to settle [[fiqh]] issues today, in a legislative sense. The closest such organism is the [[International Islamic Fiqh Academy, Jeddah|Islamic Fiqh Academy]], (a member of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC)), which has 57 member states. But it can only render fatwā that are not binding on anyone.

==Legal implications==
There is a binding rule that saves the fatwā pronouncements from creating judicial havoc, whether within a Muslim country or at the level of the Islamic world in general: it is unanimously agreed that a fatwā is only binding on its author. This was underlined by Sheikh Abdul Mohsen Al-Obeikan, vice-minister of Justice of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with the Arabic daily [[Asharq Al-Awsat]], as recently as on July 9, 2006, in a discussion of the legal value of a fatwā by the Islamic Fiqh Academy (IFA) on the subject of [[misyar marriage]], which had been rendered by IFA on April 12, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Huda al Saleh |url=http://www.asharqalawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=3&amp;id=5572 |title=Loading |publisher=Asharqalawsat.com |date=2009-02-15 |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205150644/http://www.asharqalawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=3&amp;id=5572 |archivedate=2009-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said, "Even the decisions of the official Ifta authority [the official Saudi fatwā institute] is binding on no one, whether for the people or the state." Al-Obeikan, however, was subsequently removed from his position as advisor to the royal cabinet in May 2012 after opposing moves to relax gender segregation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18042467|title=Saudi King Abdullah sacks conservative adviser|author=|date=11 May 2012|publisher=|accessdate=12 December 2016|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in August 2012, Obeikan’s morning radio show "Fatwas on Air", in which he would issue daily fatwas, was canceled after a royal decree that authorizes only members of the [[Council of Senior Scholars (Saudi Arabia)|Council of Senior Scholars]] to issue fatwās.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sandels|first=Alexandra|title=SAUDI ARABIA: Cleric who urged grown men to drink breast milk of unrelated women taken off air|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2010/08/saudi-arabia-breastmilk-fatwa-cleric-taken-off-air.html|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, sometimes, even leading religious authorities and theologians misleadingly present their fatwā as obligatory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503546692 |title=Boycotting Products of the US &amp; Its Allies: Obligatory? - IslamonLine.net - Ask The Scholar |publisher=IslamonLine.net |date=2003-03-22 |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717082127/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503546692 |archivedate=2009-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or try to adopt some "in-between" position.

Thus, the [[Sheikh]] of [[Al-Azhar Mosque|al-Azhar]] in [[Cairo]], [[Muhammad Sayid Tantawy]], who is the leading religious authority in the Sunni Muslim establishment in [[Egypt]], alongside the [[Grand Mufti]] of Egypt, said the following about fatwās issued by ''himself'' or the entire Dar al-Ifta:

"Fatwā issued by [[Al-Azhar]] are not binding, but they are not just whistling in the wind either; individuals are free to accept them, but Islam recognizes that extenuating circumstances may prevent it. For example, it is the right of Muslims in [[France]] who object to the [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools|law banning the veil]] to bring it up to the legislative and judicial authorities. If the judiciary decides in favor of the government because the country is secular, they would be considered to be Muslim individuals acting under compelling circumstances." Otherwise, in his view, they would be expected to adhere to the fatwā.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Middle East Information Center |url=http://middleeastinfo.org/article4171.html |title=Middle East Information - MEIC Issues and analysis of the Middle East: Conflicts, News, History, Religions and Discussions |publisher=Middleeastinfo.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722104106/http://middleeastinfo.org/article4171.html |archivedate=2009-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Morocco]], where king [[Mohammed VI of Morocco|Mohammed VI]] is also [[Amir al-Muminin]] (Commander of the Faithful), the authorities have tried to organize the field by creating a scholars' council (''conseil des oulémas'') composed of Muslim scholars ([[ulama]]), which is the only one allowed to issue fatwā.{{Citation needed|date= August 2012}} In this case, a national theocracy could in fact compel intra-national compliance with the fatwā, since a central authority is the source. Even then, however, the issue would not necessarily be religiously binding for the residents of that nation. For, the state may have the power to put a fatwā in effect, but that does not mean that the fatwā is to be religiously accepted by all. For instance, if a state fatwā council made abortion acceptable in the first trimester without any medical reason, that would have direct impact on official procedures in hospitals and courts in that country. Yet, this would not mean that the Muslims in that nation has to agree with that fatwā, or that the fatwā is religiously binding for them.{{Citation needed|date= August 2012}}

==Contemporary examples==
{{Further|List of fatwas}}
Fatwā are expected to deal with religious issues, subtle points of interpretation of the fiqh as exemplified by the cases cited in the archives linked below. In certain cases, religious issues and political ones seem to be inextricably intertwined. The term fatwā is sometimes used by some Muslims to mean to "give permission" to do a certain act that might be illegal under Islamic law; other Muslims view this to be incorrect.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Despite the word "fatwā" not being included in the Qur'an, individuals commonly obtain fatwā to guide them in everyday life. Due to the lack of a central unifying rulemaker, different sheiks may give different answers to the same question. This leaves an opportunity for the controversial practice of "fatwā shopping", in which an individual asks the same question of different sheiks until they receive an answer they like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103769811|title=A Reporter Translates Middle East Customs|work=[[NPR]] Morning Edition|date= 4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of famous or controversial fatwā include the following:

On December 2, 1947, the University of Al-Azhar religious scholars, the most respected in the Sunni Muslim world, called for holy war against the Zionists.&lt;ref&gt;"Partition of Palestine and Declaration of Jihad", cited in Benny Morris, "1948 as Jihad", page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1974 the [[Muslim World League]] issued a fatwa stating that followers  of the [[Ahmadiyyah]] movement are to be considered "non-Muslims".&lt;ref&gt;Yohanan Friedmann: Prophecy Continuous. Aspects of Ahmadi Religious Thought and Its Medieval Background. 2 Auflage. Oxford University Press, Neu-Delhi 2003, S. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] in 1989 pronounced a death sentence on [[Salman Rushdie#The Satanic Verses and the fatwā|Salman Rushdie]], the author of ''[[The Satanic Verses (novel)|The Satanic Verses]]''.

In 2001, religious authorities in the [[United Arab Emirates]] issued a fatwā against the children's game [[Pokémon]], after finding that it encouraged gambling, and was based on the theory of [[evolution]], "a Jewish-Darwinist theory, that conflicts with the truth about humans and with Islamic principles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/new_media/1269050.stm|title=Pokemon faced with fatwa|date=2001-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Egypt's [[Grand Mufti]] issued a fatwā stating that the show "Who will Win the Million?" (modelled on the British show [[Who Wants to be a Millionaire?]]) was un-Islamic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1457145.stm|title='Millionaire' fatwā rejected|date=2001-07-26|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sheikh of Cairo's [[Al-Azhar University]] later rejected the fatwā, finding that there was no objection to such shows since they spread general knowledge.

In Syria, Grand Mufti Ahmad Badruddin Hassoun issued a fatwa prohibiting every type of smoking, including cigarettes and narghile, as well as the selling and buying of tobacco and any affiliation with tobacco distribution (see also [[Smoking in Syria]]).

[[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] released a fatwā on April 14, 2004, stating that the boycott of American and Israeli products was an obligation for all who are able. The fatwā reads in part:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If people ask in the name of religion we must help them. The vehicle of this support is a complete boycott of the enemies' goods. Each riyal, dirham&amp;nbsp;... etc. used to buy their goods eventually becomes bullets to be fired at the hearts of brothers and children in Palestine. For this reason, it is an obligation not to help them (the enemies of Islam) by buying their goods. To buy their goods is to support tyranny, oppression and aggression. Buying goods from them will strengthen them; our duty is to make them as weak as we can. Our obligation is to strengthen our resisting brothers in the Sacred Land as much as we can. If we cannot strengthen the brothers, we have a duty to make the enemy weak. If their weakness cannot be achieved except by boycott, we must boycott them.

American goods, exactly like the great Israeli goods, are forbidden. It is also forbidden to advertise these goods, even though in many cases they prove to be superior. America today is a second Israel. It totally supports the Zionist entity. The usurper could not do this without the support of America. "Israel's" unjustified destruction and vandalism of everything has been using American money, American weapons, and the American veto. America has done this for decades without suffering the consequences of any punishment or protests about their oppressive and prejudiced position from the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503543874 |title=Boycotting Israeli and American Goods - IslamonLine.net - Ask The Scholar |publisher=IslamonLine.net |date=2004-04-18 |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717080127/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503543874 |archivedate=2009-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?cid=1119503545220&amp;pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaEAskTheScholar |title=Ulama’s Fatwa on Boycotting Israeli and American Products - IslamonLine.net - Ask The Scholar |publisher=IslamonLine.net |date=2003-06-30 |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717082116/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?cid=1119503545220&amp;pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaEAskTheScholar |archivedate=2009-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1992, Egyptian writer [[Farag Foda]] was assassinated following a fatwa issued by [[ulama]]s from [[Al-Azhar University|Al-Azhar]] who had adopted a previous fatwa by Sheikh al-Azhar, [[Gad al-Haq|Jadd al-Haqq]], accusing secularist writers such as Foda of being "enemies of Islam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bar |first=Shmuel |authorlink= |title=Warrant for Terror: The Fatwas of Radical Islam and the Duty to Jihad |year=2008 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |page=16, footnote 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The jihadist group [[Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]] claimed responsibility for the murder.&lt;ref name="deWaal"&gt;{{cite book |last=de Waal |first=Alex |authorlink=Alex de Waal |title=Islamism and Its Enemies in the Horn of Africa |year=2004 |publisher=C.

In September 1951, the mufti of Egypt issued a fatwa stating that both Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola were permissible for Muslims to drink.  In order to arrive at that decision, the Department of Fatwas had the Ministry of Public Health analyze the composition of the two drinks. As they did not find the pepsin or any narcotic or alcoholic substances to be present, nor any "microbes harmful to health", the mufti found that it was not forbidden under Islamic law.&lt;ref name="Coke Fatwa"&gt;Liebesny, Herbert J., ''The law of the Near and Middle East readings, cases, and materials'', Albany: State University of New York Press, 1975, 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally the debate regarding whether or not Coca-Cola or Pepsi is drinkable by Muslims does continue to appear, notably recently in 2012 when a French study was released declaring that Coca-Cola contained a small amount of alcohol. Muslims are not permitted to drink alcohol, however the amount of alcohol found in the beverage was discovered so small as to be permissible according to the fatwa system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.60millions-mag.com/2012/06/27/coca-pepsi-et-autres-colas-ces-ingredients-qu-vous-cache-7803 |title=Coca, Pepsi et autres colas : ces ingrédients qu’on vous cache |website=60millions-mag.com |publisher= 60 Millions de Consommateurs|accessdate=7 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Osama bin Laden]] issued two fatwās—[[Fatāwā of Osama bin Laden|in 1996 and then again in 1998]]—that [[Muslim]]s should kill [[civilian]]s and [[combatant|military personnel]] from the [[United States]] and allied countries until they withdraw support for [[Israel]] and withdraw military forces from [[Muslim world|Islamic countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html |title=Bin Laden'S Fatwa |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313114637/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html |archivedate=13 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1998.html|title=Online NewsHour: Al Qaeda's 1998 Fatwa|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|accessdate=2006-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, on his television show ''[[John Safran Vs God]]'', Australian comedian [[John Safran]] tricked [[Sheikh Omar Bakri]] into placing a fatwā on Safran's colleague [[Rove McManus]] by showing him falsified evidence seeming to indicate that McManus had been making fun of Islam.

In 2005, the Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, issued a fatwā that the production, stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons are forbidden under Islam and that Iran shall never acquire these weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathaba.net/0_index.shtml?x=302258 |title=Iran, holder of peaceful nuclear fuel cycle technology |publisher=Mathaba.net |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061106194110/http://www.mathaba.net/0_index.shtml?x=302258 |archivedate=2006-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfa.gov.za/foreign/Multilateral/inter/iaea_iran/200508_iran_statement1.doc|title=Department of International Relations and Cooperation - South Africa|website=www.dfa.gov.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of a fatwā is forbidding the smoking of cigarettes by Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islam.about.com/od/law/g/fatwa.htm |title=Islamic Glossary: Fatwa |publisher=Islam.about.com |date=2008-07-06 |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, the Central Java division and Jepara branch of the Indonesian organisation [[Nahdlatul Ulama]] (the Awakening of the Religious Scholars) declared the government's proposal to build a nuclear power station nearby at Balong on the Muria peninsula ''haram'' or forbidden. The fatwā was issued following a two-day meeting of more than a hundred ''ulama'' to consider the pros and cons of the proposal addressed by government ministers, scientists and critics. The decision cited both positive and negative aspects of the proposal, which it had balanced to make its judgment. Key concerns were the question of long-term safe disposal and storage of radioactive waste, the potential local and regional environmental consequences of the plant’s operation, the lack of financial clarity about the project, and issues of foreign technological dependence.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tanter, "Nuclear fatwa: Islamic jurisprudence and the Muria nuclear power station proposal", ''Austral Policy Forum'', 13 December 2007, 07-25A.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, undercover reporting by a private TV channel in India showed several respected clerics demanding and receiving cash for issuing fatwās. In response, some were suspended from issuing fatwās and Indian Muslim leaders announced that they would create a new body that will monitor the issuing of fatwās in India.&lt;ref name= TOI&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-09-18/india/27822241_1_fatwas-clerics-girls-in-muslim-run-institutes|title=Clerics issue fatwas for cash|work= [[The Times of India]]|date= September 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1537516,00.html |title=India's Cash-for- Fatwa Scandal|work= [[Time Magazine]]|date= September 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a Pakistani religious leader issued a fatwā on President Asif Ali Zardari for "indecent gestures" toward Sarah Palin, U.S. Vice Presidential candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CJ: Rohini Verma |url=http://www.merinews.com/article/zardari-gets-fatwa-for-flirting-with-palin/143115.shtml |title=Zardari gets Fatwa for flirting with Palin |publisher=Merinews.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Indian Ulama from the world-renowned seminary of Deoband have categorically issued a fatwā against terrorism and mentioned that any sort of killing of innocent people or civilians is ''[[haraam|haram]]'' (forbidden).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/06/02/stories/2008060255231200.htm |title=Front Page News : Monday, June 28, 2010 |publisher=The Hindu |date= 2008-06-02|accessdate=2010-06-28 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fatwā also clarified that there is no jihad in Kashmir or against India as freedom of religion is guaranteed by the state as any state that guarantees freedom of religion cannot have jihad sanctioned against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Not Specified |url=http://www.jammu-kashmir.com/archives/archives2008/kashmir20080228d.html |title=Deoband fatwa ruffles feathers of Kashmiri separatists |publisher=Jammu-kashmir.com |date=2008-02-28 |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fatwā was reiterated in 2009 where Indian Home Minister P. Chidrambram hailed the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=TNN, Nov 4, 2009, 04.33am IST |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-11-04/india/28104654_1_communalism-terrorism-fatwa |title=Chidambaram reaches out, seeks Deoband support in war on terrorism |publisher=The Times of India |date=2009-11-04 |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfsd.org/fatwaenglish.htm |title=Muslims for Secular Democracy |publisher=Mfsd.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726004900/https://www.mfsd.org/fatwaenglish.htm |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deoband Ulama in India have repeatedly mentioned that the Taliban government in Afghanistan was un-Islamic. This was most recently reiterated at a convention in Karachi in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawnnews.net/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/12-deoband-ulema-term-all-taliban-actions-un-islamic--bi |title=DAWN.COM &amp;#124; Pakistan &amp;#124; Deoband ulema term all Taliban actions un-Islamic |publisher=Dawnnews.net |date=2009-06-20 |accessdate=2010-06-28 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
These include the idea of establishing shariah rule with force in the name of Jihad and levying of ''jizya'' on Sikh citizens of Pakistan, which was termed as nothing more than extortion by armed gangs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/indian-clerics-flay-imposition-of-jizya-on/454905/ |title=Indian clerics flay imposition of 'Jizya' on Pakistani Sikhs |publisher=Indianexpress.com |date=2009-05-05 |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The stand was explained by Maulana Abu Hassan Nadvi as below
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This can't be called a war in the name of Islam. Even during a legitimate jihad, which is fought not by a rag-tag army of misguided youth but by the state against identified aggressors, Islam has set certain principles like you can't harm the old, sick, women and children. You can't attack any place of worship. But terrorists kill people indiscriminately. They are earning Allah's punishment.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Suicide bombing in any form has also been declared ''haram'' by Indian ulama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-10-17/india/28110543_1_taliban-threat-clerics-hakimullah-mehsud | work=The Times Of India | first1=Mohammed | last1=Wajihuddin | title=Muslim clerics denounce Taliban threat | date=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stand is also supported by Saudi scholars such as Shaykh Muhammad Bin Saalih al-'Uthaymeen, who have issued fatawā declaring suicide bombings are haram and those who commit this act are not ''shaheed'' (martyrs).&lt;ref&gt;Shaykh Muhammad Bin Saalih al-'Uthaymeen&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversial fatwas==
Fatwas have the role of explaining religion and guiding the faithful in modern matters that were not previously tackled by scholars or specifically addressed by the [[Quran]] or the [[hadith]] of [[Mohammed]]. Some fatwas stand out as controversial and often lead to hardship and violence.

In 2012, Sheikh Murgan Salem al-Gohary of Egypt, a former Taliban, issued a fatwa calling for "the destruction of the Sphinx and the Giza Pyramids in Egypt", because "God ordered Prophet Mohammed to destroy idols."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Destroy the idols&lt;!-- sic - no quotation marks --&gt; Egyptian jihadist calls for removal of Sphinx, Pyramids|url=https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/2012/11/12/Destroy-the-idols-Egyptian-jihadist-calls-for-removal-of-Sphinx-Pyramids.html|work=Al Arabiya|date=12 November 2012|accessdate=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt is host to thousands of ancient statues and drawings that mainstream Muslims have not been bothered by for the past 1400 years.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} These monuments are a major attraction to tourists and scientists interested in ancient Egyptian culture, and not worship. It is unclear why the pyramids were added to the fatwa because they are tombs of pharaohs and not statues or idols.

In 2012, [[Abdul-Azeez ibn Abdullaah Aal ash-Shaikh]], the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, issued a religious edict prohibiting contact and cooperation with foreign media outlets because they seek  to "spread chaos and strife in Muslim lands". He added that contacting foreign media outlets to "divulge the country's secrets or address various matters" was tantamount to "treason and major crime". He said that "It is not permissible and is considered betrayal and assistance to the enemies of Islam." Also, "A believer has to help keeping security, that of his nation and community, and protecting his religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Talking to foreign media is 'haram': Saudi Grand Mufti|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/11/11/248823.html|access-date=2012-11-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115002057/http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/11/11/248823.html|archive-date=2012-11-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fatwā is vague and itself is in need of another explanatory fatwā. Foreign media appears to have been singled out because it is mostly free and does not conform to Saudi Arabian government censorship. The fatwā uses the extremely strong terms (i.e., "haram" or forbidden, "treason", "betrayal", and "major crime") for the simple act of contacting the press. This fatwa has the potential to endanger the lives of ordinary citizens and members of the media due to the connotation of its language and overall ambiguity. It also threatens the financial interests of legitimate global business. In democratic societies, journalism and the media play an indispensable role in educating the public and combating corruption.

In 2011–2012, [[Abdel-Bari Zamzami]] of Morocco issued a series of religious edicts that a man has the right to engage in sexual intercourse with his wife up to six hours after her death.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.moroccoboard.com/news/5238 Necrophilia fatwa]". {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015225516/http://www.moroccoboard.com/news/5238 |date=October 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite recognizing that such an action is despicable in mainstream society, Zamzami persisted in backing his original fatwā, claiming marriage does not end in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alkhabar.ma/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%AE-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D9%85%D8%B2%D9%85%D9%8A-%D9%84%D9%80-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%B1-%D9%86%D8%B9%D9%85-%D9%85%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%86%D8%B3-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AC%D8%AB%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%AC%D8%A9_a36869.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514192814/http://www.alkhabar.ma/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%AE-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D9%85%D8%B2%D9%85%D9%8A-%D9%84%D9%80-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%B1-%D9%86%D8%B9%D9%85-%D9%85%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%86%D8%B3-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AC%D8%AB%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%AC%D8%A9_a36869.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 May 2011|title=الشيخ عبد الباري الزمزمي لـ"الخبر": نعم ممارسة الجنس على جثة الزوجة حلال، لكنه فعل مشين|first=عزيز باطراح - صحيفة|last=الخبر|date=|work=alkhabar.ma|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zamzami also announced that it is against the religion to take to the streets after the [[Mohammed VI of Morocco|King]] delivers a speech; this fatwā made the population, as well as the media, question his intentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2012/04/33484/what-abdelbari-zamzami-missed-in-his-lastest-queer-fatwa/|title=What Abdelbari Zamzami Missed in his Lastest, &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; Queer Fatwa|date=1 April 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[Indonesian Ulema Council]] issued an edict for Muslims not to wish Christians a happy Christmas. The edict said that wishing a happy Christmas was akin to confirming the "misguided" teachings of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christmas greetings chime despite edict |url=http://www2.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/12/26/christmas-greetings-chime-despite-edict.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101011140/https://www2.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/12/26/christmas-greetings-chime-despite-edict.html |archivedate=2016-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the grand mufti in Kashmir issued a fatwā terming singing as un-Islamic, forcing Kashmir's only all-girls rock band to abandon it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Times of India|date=4 February 2013|title=A day after fatwa, Kashmir's all-girl band calls it quits|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-02-04/india/36741962_1_rock-band-noma-nazir-online-threats}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [[Supreme Court of India]] ruled that Sharia courts have no legal sanction and no one is bound to accept a fatwā in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shariat courts have no legal sanction and no one is bound to accept a fatwa|url=http://www.patrika.com/news/hariat-courts-have-no-legal-sanction-and-no-one-is-bound-to-accept-a-fatwa-supr/1016459|accessdate=7 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714191202/http://www.patrika.com/news/hariat-courts-have-no-legal-sanction-and-no-one-is-bound-to-accept-a-fatwa-supr/1016459|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1117667| title=India's Supreme Court sets rules for Sharia courts| accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Excerpts from an interview given by Sheikh Abdul Mohsen Al-Obeikan, vice-minister of Justice of Saudi Arabia, to the Arabic daily ''Asharq al awsat'' on July 9, 2006, in which he discusses the legal value of a fatwā by the Islamic Fiqh Academy (IFA) on the subject of ''[[misyar]]'' marriage, which had been rendered by IFA on April 12, 2006:
{{quote|
''Asharq Al-Awsat:'' From time to time and through its regular meetings, the Islamic Fiqh Academy usually issues various fatwās dealing with the concerns of Muslims. However, these fatwās are not considered binding for the Islamic states. What is your opinion of this?

''Obeikan:'' Of course, they are not binding for the member Islamic states.

''Asharq Al-Awsat:'' But, what is the point of the Islamic Fiqh Academy's consensus on fatwās that are not binding for the member states?

''Obeikan:'' There is a difference between a judge and a mufti. The judge issues a verdict and binds people to it. However, the mufti explains the legal judgment but he does not bind the people to his fatwā. The decisions of the Islamic Fiqh Academy are fatwā decisions that are not binding for others. They only explain the legal judgment, as the case is in fiqh books.

''Asharq Al-Awsat:'' Well, what about the Ifta House [official Saudi fatwā organism]? Are its fatwās not considered binding on others?

''Obeikan:'' I do not agree with this. Even the decisions of the Ifta House are not considered binding, whether for the people or the state.}}
}}

==Other meanings==
Some fatwās have drawn a great deal of attention in Western media, giving rise to the term ''fatwā'' being used loosely for statements by non-Muslims that advocate an extreme religious or political position, and loosely or as [[slang]] for other sorts of decrees. Examples of such uses include the statements "The [[pope]] issued a fatwā"&lt;ref&gt;D. Bartles-Smith, ''Signs Of The Times, Number 26'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and "According to sources in today's Tibetan resistance, the Chinese Communist 'fatwā' to silence Patterson has never been rescinded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mounteverest.net/news.php?id=17256|title=Everest K2 News ExplorersWeb - He rode across the Himalayas in the winter of 1949: George Patterson's final contribution to the people of Tibet|author=|date=|work=mounteverest.net|accessdate=12 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510163516/http://www.mounteverest.net/news.php?id=17256|archive-date=2008-05-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GAL''' (an acronym for ''Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación'',  "Antiterrorist Liberation Groups") were [[death squad]]s established illegally by officials of the [[Spanish government]] to fight [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], the principal [[Basque separatism|Basque separatist]] [[Militant (word)|militant]] group. They were active from 1983 until 1987, under [[Spanish Socialist Workers Party]] (PSOE)-led governments. It was proven at trial that they were financed by important officials within the [[Spain|Spanish]] Interior Ministry. The Spanish daily newspaper ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'' played an important role in revealing the plot when it ran a comprehensive series of articles on the matter.

== General history ==
GAL operated mainly in the portion of the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque country]] on the [[France|French]] side of the Spanish-French border, but kidnappings and tortures were also performed at various places in Spain. The victims (at least 27 dead and 26 injured) were either members of ETA or Basque nationalist activists, but some victims were not known to have links to ETA or [[political violence]] at all. The GAL was active from 1983 until 1987, a period often referred to as ''La guerra sucia'' ("the [[Dirty War (disambiguation)|Dirty War]]") in [[History of Spain|Spanish history]].

The GAL did not have a coherent ideology. Its sole purpose was to attack ETA members and Basque nationalist targets, even at random, to spread confusion and put pressure on the French government. In this regard, the actual perpetrators were never militants, ''per se'', and certainly not militants in the political sense. Rather they were [[mercenary|mercenaries]].

When the whole operation came to an end, in addition to GAL operatives, a few Spanish policemen and government officials were also convicted. The scandalous revelations eventually led to terms in prison. For instance, the Interior Minister, [[José Barrionuevo]], and his associate [[Rafael Vera]], were convicted of the kidnapping of [[Segundo Marey]], and [[General Galindo]] and the civil governor of [[Gipuzkoa]], [[Julen Elgorriaga]], were found guilty of the [[Murder of Lasa and Zabala|murder of Joxe Antonio Lasa and Joxe Ignacio Zabala]] in October 1983 [https://web.archive.org/web/20061106211340/http://www.web.amnesty.org/web/ar2001.nsf/webeurcountries/SPAIN?OpenDocument]. General Galindo, condemned to a 75-year prison sentence, served only 4, and was released on "mental health" grounds.

Prosecutors proved that the policemen who recruited mercenaries and the government officials who organized the dirty war's operations also embezzled large amounts of public money. Rafael Vera, among others, was sentenced for illegal appropriation of funds from the Ministry. Also, in order to buy their silence, the PSOE government bribed the individuals first jailed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Reports by [[Investigative journalism|investigative journalists]] from ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'' newspaper held [[Felipe González]], then [[President of the Government of Spain|prime minister of Spain]] and leader of the PSOE, as suspect of being involved with the GAL. During several years, after hearing the defendants and scrutiny of evidence, the proceedings concluded a so-called ''Señor X'' was the chief official of the organization's hierarchy over Barrionuevo and Vera, who could not be other than Felipe Gonzalez according to the Spanish Socialist governmental cabinet of the period. However, his name was not made explicit and proceedings did not go any further. Some claim he was not brought to trial because it would discredit Spanish political institutions.

The GAL was one of the main issues of the campaign during the [[Spanish legislative election, 1996|elections of 1996]] in which the PSOE was defeated by [[José María Aznar]]'s [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP) for the first time. González then resigned as leader of the PSOE. With the exception of [[Ricardo García Damborenea]], PSOE leaders have never acknowledged responsibility for the GAL, or condemned their crimes. González himself has never been charged with a GAL-related offence, but he has called publicly for pardons for his former subordinates. PSOE leaders campaigned for leniency towards their former colleagues, and the Aznar government pardoned some of them.

After 1987, when the GAL disbanded, the [[French government]] adopted a harsher attitude towards [[Basque refugee]]s, by denying [[political refugee]] status to new applicants, and facilitating [[extradition]]s requested by Spanish judges. This change weakened ETA's veterans.

== Convicted GAL members ==

The actual attacks were carried by members of the Spanish ''[[Cuerpo Nacional de Policía (Spain)|Policía Nacional]]'' or, most frequently, by Portuguese or French [[mercenary|mercenaries]].

The convicted members of GAL's leadership are:
*[[José Barrionuevo]], Interior minister in PSOE's cabinets from 1982 to 1988.
*[[Rafael Vera]], director for the Security of the State.
*[[Ricardo García Damborenea]], secretary general of PSE-PSOE in Biscay.

*''[[Anti-Terrorismo ETA]]'' (ATE)
*''[[Batallón Vasco Español]]'' (BVE)

Members of [[Batasuna]] gave the name "Green GAL" to a group of the [[Guardia Civil (Spain)|Guardia Civil]] (who wear green uniforms) based in the [[San Sebastián#Intxaurrondo|Intxaurrondo barracks in San Sebastián]], because this political party allege that they would attack ETA members illegally.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4833">The '''Inhofe Amendment''' was an amendment to the [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006]], a [[United States Senate]] bill that would have changed current immigration law allowing more immigrants into the United States.  The amendment was passed by the Senate on May 18, 2006 by a vote of 62-35.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00131 Roll Call Vote]&lt;/ref&gt;  The bill did not pass the [[United States House of Representatives]].

According to the amendment, written by Sen. [[James M. Inhofe]] (R-Okla.), the Federal government will no longer provide [[multilingual]] communications and services, except for those already guaranteed by law. It would also make [[English language|English]] the "[[national language]]" and require new citizens to pass a test of their English proficiency and knowledge of American history.

Key portion of the final amendment, section 767 of the bill:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Government of the United States shall preserve and enhance the role of English as the national language of the United States of America. Unless otherwise authorized or provided by law, no person has a right, entitlement, or claim to have the Government of the United States or any of its officials or representatives act, communicate, perform or provide services, or provide materials in any language other than English. If exceptions are made, that does not create a legal entitlement to additional services in that language or any language other than English. If any forms are issued by the Federal Government in a language other than English (or such forms are completed in a language other than English), the English language version of the form is the sole authority for all legal purposes.[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:S.2611.ES:]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shortly after the approval of the Inhofe amendment, the Senate voted for another bill by Sen. [[Ken Salazar]] (D-Colo.), according to which English is the "common unifying language of the United States," but mandated that nothing in that declaration "shall diminish or expand any existing rights" regarding multilingual services. It passed 58-39. 

==Supporting reasons for the amendment==
Inhofe proposed his amendment, saying that there should not be a right to demand that government business be conducted in any other language, that there is a unifying effect with a common language, and indicating the importance of knowing English to get ahead in America.

==Criticism of the amendment==
Senator [[Harry Reid]], [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] from [[Nevada]], called the amendment "racist" in a speech before the Senate, arguing that it targeted speakers of Spanish.

'''John Tipper''' (1663–1713) was an [[English people|English]] [[mathematician]] and [[almanac]]-maker, now known as the founder of ''[[The Ladies' Diary]]'', in which some important mathematical results were first published.

==Life==

He was born at [[Coventry]]. In 1699 he was elected master of Bablake school in that city in the place of Richard Butler. It is thought that he founded it to promote Bablake School in Coventry where he was master and to make some money but he also thought it important to promote women who he saw as being unfairly treated by society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Albree|first=John|last2=Brown|first2= Scott H.|title="A valuable monument of mathematical genius": The Ladies' Diary (1704–1840|journal=Historia Mathematica|date=February 2009 |volume=36|issue=1|pages=10–47|doi=10.1016/j.hm.2008.09.005|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0315086008000967|accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1704 he commenced an [[almanac]] and a serial collection of mathematical papers, under the title of ''[[The Ladies' Diary]]'', which he continued to edit until his death. It was carried on until 1840, when it was united with the ''[[Gentleman's Diary]]'', under the title ''[[The Lady's and Gentleman's Diary]]'', and continued to appear until 1871. In 1710 he also founded ''Great Britain's Diary'', which continued to be issued until 1728. Tipper was a mathematician of some ability, and to the typical contents of astrological almanacs he added mathematical problems of a difficult nature which his readers were invited to solve. Among those who exercised their ingenuity in attempting these was [[Thomas Simpson]], the well-known mathematician. In 1711 Tipper started ''Delights for the Ingenious'', a monthly magazine treating of mathematical questions and enigmas, and more recreational in its character. It did not, however, survive the year. Tipper died in 1713.

==Notes==
Letters from Tipper to [[Humphrey Wanley]], relating to the inception of the ''Diary'', are in Ellis's ''Letters of Eminent Literary Men'' (Camden Soc. pp.&amp;nbsp;304–15).

'''Morphology''' is a branch of [[biology]] dealing with the study of the form and structure of organisms and their specific structural features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/morphology|title=Morphology|last=|first=|date=|website=Oxford Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This includes aspects of the outward appearance ([[shape]], [[structure]], [[colour]], [[pattern]], [[size]]), i.e. '''external morphology''' (or [[eidonomy]]), as well as the form and structure of the internal parts like [[bones]] and [[organs]], i.e. '''internal morphology''' (or [[anatomy]]). This is in contrast to [[physiology]], which deals primarily with function. Morphology is a branch of [[List of life sciences|life science]] dealing with the study of gross structure of an [[organism]] or [[taxon]] and its component parts.

== History ==
The word "morphology" is from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''μορφή'', ''morphé'', meaning "form", and ''λόγος'', ''lógos'', meaning "word, study, research".

While the concept of form in biology, opposed to [[Function (biology)|function]], dates back to Aristotle (see [[Aristotle's biology]]), the field of morphology was developed by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1790) and independently by the German anatomist and physiologist [[Karl Friedrich Burdach]] (1800).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Karl|last= Mägdefrau|year= 1992|title= Geschichte der Botanik [History of Botany]|edition= 2|publisher= Gustav Fischer Verlag|location= Jena|isbn= 3-437-20489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other important theorists of morphology are [[Lorenz Oken]], [[Georges Cuvier]], [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], [[Richard Owen]], [[Karl Gegenbaur]] and [[Ernst Haeckel]].&lt;ref&gt;Richards, R. J. (2008). A Brief History of Morphology. In: ''The Tragic Sense of Life. Ernst Haeckel and the Struggle over Evolutionary Thought''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Di Gregorio, M. A. (2005). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=aZK004HREqgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=morphology&amp;f=false From Here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and Scientific Faith].'' Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1830, Cuvier and E.G.Saint-Hilaire engaged in [[Cuvier–Geoffroy debate|a famous debate]], which is said to exemplify the two major deviations in biological thinking at the time – whether animal structure was due to function or evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Appel, Toby (1987). ''The Cuvier-Geoffroy Debate: French Biology in the Decades Before Darwin''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Divisions of morphology ==
* [[Comparative anatomy|Comparative morphology]] is analysis of the patterns of the locus of structures within the body plan of an organism, and forms the basis of taxonomical categorization.
* [[Functional morphology]] is the study of the relationship between the structure and function of morphological features.
* Experimental morphology is the study of the effects of external factors upon the morphology of organisms under experimental conditions, such as the effect of genetic mutation.
* "[[Anatomy]]" is a "branch of morphology that deals with the structure of [[organisms]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anatomy|title=Anatomy – Definition of anatomy by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Molecular Morphology is a term used in [[English-speaking countries]] for describing the structure of compound [[molecules]], such as [[polymers]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eng.uc.edu/~gbeaucag/Classes/Morphology.html|accessdate=2010-06-24|publisher=ceas.uc.edu/|title= Polymer Morphology}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ribonucleic acid ([[RNA]]).
* Gross Morphology refers to the collective structures of an organism as a whole as a general description of the form and structure of an organism, taking into account all of its structures without specifying an individual structure.

== Morphology and classification ==
Most taxa differ morphologically from other taxa. Typically, closely related taxa differ much less than more distantly related ones, but there are exceptions to this. [[Cryptic species]] are [[species]] which look very similar, or perhaps even outwardly identical, but are reproductively isolated. Conversely, sometimes unrelated taxa acquire a similar appearance as a result of [[convergent evolution]] or even [[mimicry]]. In addition, there can be morphological differences within a species, such as in ''[[Apoica flavissima]]'' where queens are significantly smaller than workers. A further problem with relying on morphological data is that what may appear, morphologically speaking, to be two distinct species, may in fact be shown by [[DNA analysis]] to be a single species. The significance of these differences can be examined through the use of [[allometric engineering]] in which one or both species are manipulated to phenocopy the other species.

A step relevant to the evaluation of morphology between traits/features within species, includes an assessment of the terms: [[Homology (biology)|homology]] and [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/a-z/Homoplasies.asp homoplasy]. Homology between features indicate that those features have been derived from a common ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36011744|title=A dictionary of ecology, evolution, and systematics|last=J.|first=Lincoln, Roger|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Boxshall, Geoffrey Allan., Clark, P. F.|isbn=052143842X|edition=2nd|location=Cambridge|oclc=36011744}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, homoplasy between features describes those that can resemble each other, but derive independently via [[Parallel evolution|parallel]] or [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/184829042|title=Vertebrate life|last=Harvey.|first=Pough, F.|date=2009|publisher=Benjamin Cummings|others=Janis, Christine M. (Christine Marie), 1950-, Heiser, John B.|isbn=0321545761|edition=8th|location=San Francisco|oclc=184829042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==3D cell morphology: classification==

The '''National Institution for the Promotion of Science''' organization was established in Washington, D.C. in May, 1840, and was heir to the mantle of the earlier ''Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences''. The National Institution for the Promotion of Science was later renamed the ''National Institute'' and eventually became a part of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

The National Institute was the initial repository for collections of artifacts brought to the US by the [[United States Exploring Expedition]], as well as various other object accumulated by the government, such as items owned by early American politicians, patent models, and natural objects.  Housed in the Patent Office Building, these were the precursor to the Smithsonian Institution collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/baird/bairdb.htm |title=Planning a National Museum |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Archives |accessdate=2 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803084613/http://siarchives.si.edu//history/exhibits/baird/bairdb.htm |archivedate=3 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cabinet was managed by a group of scientists in 1840 and others to secure control of the [[James Smithson|Smithson]] bequest and create a National Museum in Washington.

Among those who were elected as corresponding members were such distinguished men as:

* [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]] 1st superintendent of the [[United States Naval Observatory]] in Washington, D.C.,
* [[Jacob Whitman Bailey]], professor of [[chemistry]] and [[mineralogy]] at the U.S. Military Academy at [[West Point]];
* Professor [[Joseph Henry]], of the College of New Jersey, at Princeton;
* [[Alexander Dallas Bache]], president of Girard College of Orphans, Philadelphia;
* [[Denison Olmsted]], professor of natural history at Yale College;
Foreign scientists were also represented:
*Professor [[Charles Wheatstone]] of [[King's College London|King's College, London]]
*[[Adolphe Quetelet]], the astronomer royal of Belgium;
* Professor [[Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve]], director of the Russian Imperial Central Observatory near St. Petersburg.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8935">'''Ogyges''', also spelled '''Ogygos''' or '''Ogygus''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ὠγύγης}} or Ὤγυγος), is a primeval [[mythology|myth]]ological ruler in [[Classical antiquity|ancient]] [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], generally of [[Boeotia]],&lt;ref&gt;Hammond and Scullard, "OGYGUS" p. 748; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+9.5.1 9.5.1].&lt;/ref&gt; but an alternative tradition makes him the first king of [[Attica]].

==Etymology==
Though the original etymology and meaning are "uncertain",&lt;ref&gt;Hammond and Scullard, "OGYGUS", p. 748.&lt;/ref&gt; the name ''Ogyges'' may be related with the Greek [[Okeanos]] (Ὠκεανός), the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] who personified the great world [[ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;Fontenrose, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wqeVv09Y6hIC&amp;pg=PA236 p. 236].&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek word ''Ogygios'' (Ὠγύγιος), meaning ''Ogygian'', came to mean "primeval, primal," or "from earliest ages" and also "gigantic".&lt;ref&gt;[[Liddell &amp; Scott]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=*)wgu/gios "Ὠγύγιος"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient sources==
Ogyges is also known as king of the [[Ectenes]], who according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] were the first inhabitants of Boeotia, where the city of [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] would later be founded.&lt;ref name="Seyffert"&gt;Entry "Ogyges" in Oskar Seyffert, ''A Dictionary of Classical Antiquities'', Revised and edited by Henry Nettleship and J.E. Sandys, New York: Meridian Books, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, he became the first ruler of Thebes, which was, in that early time, named ''Ogygia'' (Ὠγυγία) after him. Subsequently, poets referred to the Thebans as ''Ogygidae'' (Ὠγυγίδαι).&lt;ref name="Blakeney"&gt;Entry "Ogyges" in [[E. H. Blakeney]], ''Smith's Smaller Classical Dictionary'', Everyman's Library, London: J. M. Dent and Sons Ltd., 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], writing from his travels in Boeotia in the 2nd century CE, said: "The first to occupy the land of Thebes are said to have been the Ectenes, whose king was Ogygus, an aboriginal. From his name is derived Ogygian, which is an epithet of Thebes used by most of the poets."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+9.5.1 9.5.1].&lt;/ref&gt;

In yet another version of the story, the Boeotian tradition is combined with that of another part of Greece: Ogyges was king of the Ectenes, who were the first people to occupy Boeotia, but he and his people later settled the area then known as [[Mount Athos|Acte]] (''Akte''). The land was subsequently called Ogygia in his honor but later known as Mount Athos. [[Sextus Julius Africanus]], writing after 221 CE, adds that Ogyges founded [[Eleusis]].&lt;ref name="Chronography"&gt;Africanus, ''Chronography'', quoted in [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], ''[[Praeparatio Evangelica]]'', [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_pe_10_book10.htm 10.10].&lt;/ref&gt;

Stories of his descent also differ widely. Besides Ogyges being one of the aborigines of Boeotia, there are tales that regard him as the son of [[Poseidon]], [[Boeotus]] or even [[Cadmus]]. [[Theophilus of Antioch|Theophilus]], in the 2nd century (''Apologia ad Autolycum''), says he was one of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]].

He was the husband of [[Thebe (daughter of Zeus and Iodame)|Thebe]], from whom the land of Thebes in Greece is said to derive its name. His children are listed variously as two sons: Eleusinus (for whom the city Eleusis was named) and Cadmus (noted above as his father in other traditions); and three daughters: [[Aulis (daughter of Ogyges)|Aulis]], [[Alalcomenia]], and Thelvinia.

According to Africanus, he lived at the time of the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] of the House of Israel from Egypt.&lt;ref name="Chronography"/&gt;

Ogyges is possibly the namesake for the [[phantom island]] [[Ogygia]], mentioned in [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]].  Another possibility for the island is the Niobid named [[Niobids|Ogygia]].

The historian [[Josephus]] mentions Ogyges as the name of the oak by which the [[Hebrew]] patriarch [[Abraham|Abram]] dwelt while he lived near [[Hebron]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus. ''Antiquities of the Jews.''  Book I. Chapter 10. Verse 4.  Retrieved from: http://sacred-texts.com/jud/josephus/ant-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, [[Og]], also called "Ogias the Giant", who was king of [[Bashan]] in the [[Old Testament]]; was described as a giant in Deut 3:11, viewed by the [[Hebrews]] as having aided [[Noah]] in building the [[Noah's Ark|Ark]], thus Noah allowed him to stay on the deck of the Ark.

==The deluge of Ogyges==
[[File:Boeotia ancient-en.svg|thumb|Map of ancient Boeotia.The area around the [[Lake Copais]] down to [[Attica]] is related with the [[Ancient Greek flood myths#Ogyges|Ogygian deluge]]]]
The first worldwide flood in Greek mythology, the [[Ancient Greek flood myths#Ogyges|Ogygian deluge]] occurred during his reign and derives its name from him, though some sources regard it as a local flood, such as an inundation of [[Lake Copais]], a large lake once in the center of Boeotia.&lt;ref name="Seyffert"/&gt; Other sources see it as a flood associated with Attica.&lt;ref name="Blakeney"/&gt; This latter view was accepted by Africanus, who says "that great and first flood occurred in Attica, when [[Phoroneus]] was king of [[Argos]], as [[Acusilaus]] relates."

When this deluge has been considered global, a similarity is noticed with [[Noah]]'s flood in the [[Bible]]. Various dates have been assigned to the event, including 9500 BCE ([[Plato]]),&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (22), ''[[Critias (Plato)|Critias]]'' (111-112), and ''[[Laws (dialogue)|The Laws]]'' Book III.&lt;/ref&gt; 2136 BCE ([[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]]), and 1793 BCE (Africanus).&lt;ref name="Chronography"/&gt;

Ogyges survived the deluge but many people perished. After his death, the devastated Attica was without kings for 189 years, until the time of [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]] (Cecrops Diphyes).&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodor Gaster|Gaster, Theodor H.]] [http://home.earthlink.net/~misaak/floods.htm#Gaster Myth, Legend, and Custom in the Old Testament] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020204111850/http://home.earthlink.net/~misaak/floods.htm |date=2002-02-04 }}, Harper &amp; Row, New York, 1969.''&lt;/ref&gt; Africanus says, "But after Ogyges, on account of the great destruction caused by the flood, what is now called Attica remained without a king one hundred and eighty-nine years until the time of Cecrops. For [[Philochorus]] asserts that that [[Actaeus|Actaeon]] who comes after Ogyges, and the fictitious names, never even existed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eusebius|title=The Preparation for the Gospel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1SzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA320&amp;lpg=PA320&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rGjVjqkpib&amp;sig=VnLN-HeW25elfGs5B_XZQQIk7VM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRk6zGkeDQAhWCTCYKHd-sC74Q6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems the [[deluge myth|deluge]] of [[Deucalion]] of Greek-mythology is the Greek version of the older legend. [[Deucalion]] and [[Pyrrha]] were the only survivals after the great deluge. Their son [[Hellen]], who became ruler of [[Phthia]] in southern [[Thessaly]], was the patriarch of the [[Hellenes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31407">Executive '''oversight of [[United States]] [[covert operations]]''' has been carried out by a series of sub-committees of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] (NSC).

==Birth of covert operations in the Cold War==
At the beginning of the [[Cold War]], it was not inevitable that covert operations would become the dominion of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA).{{sfn|Corke|2006|pages=102–104}} The [[National Security Act of 1947]] did not explicitly authorize the CIA to conduct covert operations, although Section 102(d)(5) was sufficiently vague to permit abuse.{{sfn|Prados|2006|page=[https://books.google.no/books?id=3OCDelYICIsC&amp;pg=PA35 35]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Houston|first=Lawrence R.|editor=[[Office of the Historian]]|title=CIA Authority to Perform Propaganda and Commando Type Functions|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1945-50Intel/d241|website=history.state.gov|language=en|date=25 September 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the very first meetings of the NSC in late 1947, the perceived necessity to "stem the flow of communism" in [[Western Europe]]—particularly [[Italy]]—by overt and covert "psychological warfare" forced the issue.{{sfn|Corke|2006|pages=102–104}} The actual responsibility for these operations was a hot potato, and when it was decided that the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] would be in charge, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[George Marshall]] sharply opposed it, fearing it would tarnish the international credibility of his department. The upshot was that responsibility for covert operations was passed on to the CIA; this was codified in a NSC [[National security directive#Truman and Eisenhower administrations|policy paper]] called NSC{{nbsp}}4-A,&lt;ref name="NSC 4-A"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Foreign Relations of the United States (book series)|FRUS]]|title=NSC 4-A – National Security Council Directive to Director of Central Intelligence Hillenkoetter|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1945-50Intel/d257|website=history.state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; approved in December 1947.{{sfn|Corke|2006|pages=102–104}} NSC{{nbsp}}4-A provided the authorization for the intervention of the CIA in the [[Italian general election, 1948|Italian elections of April 1948]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitrovich|first=Gregory|title=Undermining the Kremlin: America's Strategy to Subvert the Soviet Bloc, 1947-1956|date=2000|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0801437113|page=[https://books.google.no/books?id=w6TVdT-q7vcC&amp;pg=PA17 17]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed NSC 4-A Panel===
A draft&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Foreign Relations of the United States (book series)|FRUS]]|title=NSC 4-A – Draft Directive to Director of Central Intelligence Hillenkoetter|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1945-50Intel/d253|website=history.state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; of NSC{{nbsp}}4-A envisioned the creation of a NSC-designated "panel" to approve operations. The executive secretary of the NSC, [[Sidney Souers]], recommended that the panel be composed of representatives from the departments of State, [[United States Department of the Army|Army]], [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy]] and [[United States Department of the Navy|Air Force]], as well an "observer" representative from the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Foreign Relations of the United States (book series)|FRUS]]|title=Memorandum From the Executive Secretary (Souers) to the National Security Council|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1945-50Intel/d255|website=history.state.gov|date=16 December 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provision was dropped in the final version, which simply stated that the [[Director of Central Intelligence]] (DCI) "is charged with ensuring that [covert] psychological operations are consistent with U.S. foreign policy and overt foreign information activities, and that appropriate agencies of the U.S. Government, [...], are kept informed of such operations which will directly affect them."&lt;ref name="NSC 4-A"/&gt;
==From NSC 10/2 to NSC 5412 (June 1948–March 1955)==
According to the [[Church Committee]], throughout the period June 1948 to March 1955, "NSC directives provided for consultation with representatives of State and Defense". But "these representatives had no approval function. There was no formal procedure or committee to consider and approve projects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Church Committee]]|title=Final Report, Book I|date=26 April 1976|url=https://archive.org/details/pdfy-UM4X5C4pdvn8FqLd|page=[https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-UM4X5C4pdvn8FqLd#page/n59/mode/2up 49]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===NSC 10/2 Panel===
The arrangement in NSC{{nbsp}}4-A did not please the influential [[Director of Policy Planning|director]] of the State Department's [[Policy Planning Staff (United States)|Policy Planning Staff]] (S/P), [[George F. Kennan]].{{sfn|Corke|2006|pages=108–109}} Under his leadership, a S/P paper titled "The inauguration of organized political warfare"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The inauguration of organized political warfare.|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1945-50Intel/d269|website=history.state.gov|language=en|date=4 May 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; was circulated in the NSC in early May 1948, which said that "there are two major types of political warfare—one overt and the other covert. Both, from their basic nature, should be directed and coordinated by the Department of State." Yet Kennan wanted to have his cake and eat it too: the paper made it clear that the State Department should not be formally associated with the conduct of covert operations.{{sfn|Corke|2006|pages=108–109}} Then the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] entered the fray by guarding its prerogatives, particularly in wartime, especially in theatres of war.{{sfn|Lilly|1951|pages=[https://archive.org/stream/THEDEVELOPMENTOFAMERICANPSYCHOLOGICALOPERATIONS1945-1951BYEDWARDPLILLYRDP86B00269R000900020001-9#page/n43/mode/2up 45–47]}} As a result of the controversy spurred by Kennan, NSC{{nbsp}}4-A was replaced by NSC{{nbsp}}10/2,&lt;ref name="NSC 10/2"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Foreign Relations of the United States (book series)|FRUS]]|title=NSC 10/2 – National Security Council Directive on Office of Special Projects|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1945-50Intel/d292|website=history.state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; approved by President [[Harry Truman]] on 18 June 1948, creating the [[Office of Policy Coordination]] (OPC). Kennan was still not satisfied and continued to press for State control, hoping that his choice for OPC director, [[Frank Wisner]], would be loyal to the State Department—he was not.{{sfn|Corke|2006|pages=111–112}}

NSC{{nbsp}}10/2 was the first presidential document which specified a mechanism to approve and manage covert operations, and also the first in which the term "covert operations" was defined.{{sfn|Prados|2006|pages=[https://books.google.no/books?id=3OCDelYICIsC&amp;pg=PA40 40–41]}} NSC{{nbsp}}10/2 charged the DCI with "Ensuring, through designated representatives of the Secretary of State and of the Secretary of Defense, that covert operations are planned and conducted in a manner consistent with US foreign and military policies and with overt activities."&lt;ref name="NSC 10/2"/&gt; The representatives to this "10/2 Panel", also known as the "OPC Consultants",{{sfn|Gustafson|2012|page=149}} were Kennan for State (1948–1950) and [[Joseph McNarney]] for Defense (1948–1949).{{sfn|Karalekas|1976|pages=[https://archive.org/stream/finalreportofsel04unit#page/34/mode/2up 34–35]}} The panel, which met about once a week, was supplanted from January 1950 on by the regular attendance of a representative from the Joint Chiefs of Staff.{{sfn|Lilly|1951|page=[https://archive.org/stream/THEDEVELOPMENTOFAMERICANPSYCHOLOGICALOPERATIONS1945-1951BYEDWARDPLILLYRDP86B00269R000900020001-9#page/n87/mode/2up 89]}} According to Anne Karalekas, a [[Church Committee]] staffer, it did not constrain the OPC:

{{Quote|[The 10/2 Panel was] not an approval body, and there was no formal mechanism whereby individual projects had to be brought before [it] for discussion. Because it was assumed that covert action would be exceptional, strict provisions for specific project authorization were not considered necessary. With minimal supervision from State and Defense and with a shared agreement on the nature of the OPC mission, individuals in OPC could take the initiative in conceiving and implementing projects.{{sfn|Karalekas|1976|pages=[https://archive.org/stream/finalreportofsel04unit#page/34/mode/2up 34–35]}}}}

In the first half of its existence, OPC was not really under CIA's control. In the words of [[Edward P. Lilly]], DCI [[Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter]], "although authorized by NSC-10/2 to supervise OPC, had allowed OPC to go its own way." OPC was brought under CIA control in October 1950, when [[Walter Bedell Smith]] became DCI.{{sfn|Lilly|1951|page=[https://archive.org/stream/THEDEVELOPMENTOFAMERICANPSYCHOLOGICALOPERATIONS1945-1951BYEDWARDPLILLYRDP86B00269R000900020001-9#page/n89/mode/1up 90]}} OPC was merged on 1 August 1952 with the CIA branch responsible for [[espionage]], the Office of Special Operations (OSO), to form the [[Directorate of Plans]] (DDP).

===NSC 10/5 Panel===
Truman swelled the bureaucracy on 4 April 1951 when he established the [[Psychological Strategy Board]] (PSB). DCI Smith, seeking more high-level policy guidance, wanted the PSB "to replace the 10/2 Panel as approval body";{{sfn|Prados|2006|page=[https://books.google.no/books?id=3OCDelYICIsC&amp;pg=PA81 81]}} this proposal was adopted by the NSC.{{sfn|Karalekas|1976|pages=[https://archive.org/stream/finalreportofsel04unit#page/34/mode/2up 34–35]}} NSC{{nbsp}}10/5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Foreign Relations of the United States (book series)|FRUS]]|title=NSC 10/5 – SCOPE AND PACE OF COVERT OPERATIONS|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1950-55Intel/d90|website=history.state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; tried to specify the purpose of the PSB. The 10/2{{nbsp}}Panel, which continued to function,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allen|first=Raymond B.|authorlink=Raymond B.

According to John Prados, the CIA cut the PSB out of the loop, establishing instead an internal mechanism for approval of operations.{{sfn|Prados|2006|pages=[https://books.google.no/books?id=3OCDelYICIsC&amp;pg=PA80 80–82]}} In 1953, DCI Smith said that the PSB was "incompetent
and its work irrelevant".{{sfn|Gustafson|2012|page=155}}

"As the Truman administration ended", writes the [[Office of the Historian]],

{{Quote|CIA was near the peak of its independence and authority in the field of covert action. Although CIA continued to seek and receive advice on specific projects from the NSC, the PSB, and the departmental representatives originally delegated to advise OPC, no group or officer outside of the DCI and the President himself had authority to order, approve, manage, or curtail operations.&lt;ref name=FRUS_note/&gt;}}

===Enter Eisenhower===
The [[Eisenhower administration]] took office on 20 January 1953. When Eisenhower replaced the PSB with the [[Operations Coordinating Board]] (OCB) on 2 September 1953, he also did away with the 10/5{{nbsp}}Panel, reverting to "a smaller group identical to the former 10/2{{nbsp}}Panel, without OCB staff participation."&lt;ref name=CIA1967/&gt; On 15 March 1954, Eisenhower approved NSC{{nbsp}}5412,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Foreign Relations of the United States (book series)|FRUS]]|title=NSC 5412 – NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL DIRECTIVE ON COVERT OPERATIONS|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1950-55Intel/d171|website=history.state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; which required CIA to consult with OCB.&lt;ref name=CIA1967/&gt; Although Eisenhower would later congratulate the CIA with [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état|its success in deposing]] [[Guatemala]]'s democratically elected President, [[Jacobo Árbenz]], he was privately irked by CIA's unauthorized bombing of [[SS Springfjord|SS ''Springfjord'']]. According to Prados, that incident "convinced Eisenhower of the need for more rigorous control over covert action".{{sfn|Prados|2006|pages=[https://books.google.no/books?id=3OCDelYICIsC&amp;pg=PA148 148], [https://books.google.no/books?id=3OCDelYICIsC&amp;pg=PA121 121] (quoted)}}

==Planning Coordination Group (March 1955–December 1955)==
The arrangement in NSC{{nbsp}}5412 suffered the same problem as the 10/5{{nbsp}}Panel;&lt;ref name=CIA1967/&gt; OCB "included more officials than ought to be concerned with secret war."{{sfn|Prados|2006|page=[https://books.google.no/books?id=3OCDelYICIsC&amp;pg=PA150 150]}} So on 12 March 1955, Eisenhower approved NSC{{nbsp}}5412/1,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Foreign Relations of the United States (book series)|FRUS]]|title=NSC 5412/1 – Covert Operations|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1950-55Intel/d212|website=history.state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a more senior Planning Coordination Group (PCG) within OCB. Significantly, the directive explicitly charged PCG with ''approving'' covert operations.&lt;ref name=Church50&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Church Committee]]|title=Final Report, Book I|date=26 April 1976|url=https://archive.org/details/pdfy-UM4X5C4pdvn8FqLd|pages=[https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-UM4X5C4pdvn8FqLd#page/n61/mode/2up 50–51]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PCG proved to be a failure; its chairman, [[Nelson Rockefeller]], recommended the abolishment of PCG before year's end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rockefeller|first1=Nelson|authorlink1=Nelson Rockefeller|title=Report of the Planning Coordination Group|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1950-55Intel/d246|language=en|date=14 December 1955|work=Planning Coordinating Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Prados, the problem was that CIA had not been forthcoming with details, latching on to a mention of "need-to-know" in NSC{{nbsp}}5412/1. The next directive would solve this by creating a committee "so high-powered there could be no question" of its need to know.{{sfn|Prados|2006|page=[https://books.google.no/books?id=3OCDelYICIsC&amp;pg=PA150 150]}}

==Special Group/303 Committee (December 1955–February 1970)==
NSC{{nbsp}}5412/2&lt;ref name="NSC 5412/2"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Foreign Relations of the United States (book series)|FRUS]]|title=NSC 5412/2 – Covert Operations|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1950-55Intel/d250|website=history.state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; was approved by Eisenhower on 28 December 1955, a directive which remained in force for 15 years.&lt;ref name=Church50/&gt; Paragraph 7 specified the new oversight mechanism:

{{Quote|Except as the President otherwise directs, designated representatives of the Secretary of State and of the Secretary of Defense of the rank of [[Assistant Secretary#United States|Assistant Secretary]] or above, and a representative of the President designated for this purpose, shall hereafter be advised in advance of major covert programs initiated by CIA under this policy or as otherwise directed, and shall be the normal channel for giving policy approval for such programs as well as for securing coordination of support therefor among the Departments of State and Defense and the CIA.&lt;ref name="NSC 5412/2"/&gt;}}

The resulting body became known as the '''5412 Committee''' or, from 1957, the '''Special Group'''.{{sfn|Jackson|1973|page=[https://archive.org/stream/HistoryOfAllenWelshDullesAsCIADirectorVolumeIIICovertActivities#page/n165/mode/2up 162]}}{{refn|group=note|It had many similar designations.

In late 1956, the newly formed [[PBCFIA]], which had turned a candid eye towards covert operations, took issue with the "very informal" procedures of the Special Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Studies in Intelligence]]|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|date=Summer 1969|title=The President's Board: 1956–1960, Overseeing the intelligence community|first=Philip K.|last=Edwards|page=126|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/cia-rdp89b00980r000400120002-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Prados|2006|pages=[https://books.google.no/books?id=3OCDelYICIsC&amp;pg=PA160 160–161]}} Consequently, an annex&lt;ref&gt;For the text of the annex: {{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/MemoonCovertOperationsbyJPatrickCoynecovops|title=Covert Operations|date=9 May 1961|first=J.

Eisenhower himself saw the proper functioning of the Special Group as crucial to fend off initiatives for meaningful congressional oversight of covert operations.{{sfn|Prados|2006|pages=[https://books.google.no/books?id=3OCDelYICIsC&amp;pg=PA180 180–182].

===Kennedy administration===
The Special Group fell by the wayside when new administration of [[John F. Kennedy]] took office on 20 January 1961; although it remained "in theory intact", in practice it "took a backseat to meetings at which JFK personally presided".{{sfn|Prados|2006|page=[https://books.google.no/books?id=3OCDelYICIsC&amp;pg=PA241 241]}}{{refn|group=note|Some sources actually claim the Special Group was disbanded at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daugherty|first1=William|title=Executive Secrets: Covert Action and the Presidency|date=2004|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0813123348|pages=[https://books.google.no/books?id=4NgTQuw8uUEC&amp;pg=PA151 151ff]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Rebecca R.|title=Crisis Management at the Dead Center: The 1960-1961 Presidential Transition and the Bay of Pigs Fiasco|journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly|date=17 March 2011|volume=41|issue=2|page=324|doi=10.1111/j.1741-5705.2011.03856.x|issn=0360-4918}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} After the failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], the Special Group returned to prominence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Church Committee]]|title=Final Report, Book I|date=26 April 1976|url=https://archive.org/details/pdfy-UM4X5C4pdvn8FqLd|page=[https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-UM4X5C4pdvn8FqLd#page/n63/mode/2up 52]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and new procedures were set out in July 1961.{{sfn|Jackson|1973|page=[https://archive.org/stream/HistoryOfAllenWelshDullesAsCIADirectorVolumeIIICovertActivities#page/n83/mode/2up 81]}} In the wake of the scandal, [[Deputy Director for Plans|DDP]] [[Richard M. Bissell Jr.]] suggested the name and workings of the Special Group be made public to demonstrate to the American people that the CIA was under effective executive oversight; that did not happen.{{sfn|Prados|2006|page=[https://books.google.no/books?id=3OCDelYICIsC&amp;pg=PA241 375]}}

A second '''Special Group (Augmented)''' existed from November 1961 to the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of October 1962.&lt;ref name=FRUS_note/&gt; The only difference was that it was specifically dedicated to managing the [[Cuban Project]] which sought to overthrow [[Fidel Castro]]'s regime, and was headed by [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Robert Kennedy]].{{sfn|Prados|2006|page=[https://books.google.no/books?id=3OCDelYICIsC&amp;pg=PA286 286]}} After the Missile Crisis brought the world to the brink of destruction, management of the war against Castro was transferred to discussions in the [[EXCOMM]] and NSC proper, before being handed over to an "obscure NSC appendage" known as the '''Standing Group''' chaired by [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[McGeorge Bundy]].{{sfn|Prados|2006|page=[https://books.google.no/books?id=3OCDelYICIsC&amp;pg=PA313 313]}}

===Johnson administration===
The Special Group was renamed to the '''303 Committee''' on 2 June 1964, in response to the publication of the book ''The Invisible Government'' by [[David Wise (journalist)|David Wise]] and Thomas B. Ross, which made the old name public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Church Committee]]|title=Final Report, Book I|date=26 April 1976|url=https://archive.org/details/pdfy-UM4X5C4pdvn8FqLd|page=[https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-UM4X5C4pdvn8FqLd#page/n63/mode/2up 53n19]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A NSC staffer had recommended the new name be "something utterly drab and innocuous" to deflect away attention.&lt;ref name=Jessup&gt;{{cite web|first=Peter|last=Jessup|title=Proposed Name Change for Special Group (5412)|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v33/d203|date=19 May 1964|work=[[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number refers to the [[national security directive]] which effected the change, [[National Security Directive|NSAM]]{{nbsp}}303.&lt;ref name=Jessup/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NSAM 303|date=2 June 1964|website=discoverlbj.org|url=https://www.discoverlbj.org/item/nsf-nsam303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==40 Committee==
On 17 February 1970, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved [[National Security Decision Memorandum|NSDM]]{{nbsp}}40,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Security Decision Memoranda 40 |url=https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/nsdm-nixon/nsdm-40.pdf |website=fas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; superseding and revoking NSC{{nbsp}}5412/2, and replacing the 303 Committee with the 40 Committee. Among the few substantive changes introduced by Nixon was the inclusion of Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell]] and a requirement to review covert programs annually.{{sfn|Prados|2006|pages=[https://books.google.no/books?id=3OCDelYICIsC&amp;pg=PA385 385–387]}} Like earlier, public exposure was the motive for changing the name; National Security Adviser [[Henry Kissinger]] explained to Nixon that "In view of recent mention of the 303 Committee in the public media, the directive changes the committee name to coincide with the number assigned to the NSDM itself, which is 40."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Henry Kissinger|authorlink=Henry Kissinger|title=Responsibility for the Conduct, Supervision and Coordination of Covert Action Operations|date=16 February 1970|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/LOC-HAK-513-1-1-9.pdf#page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nixon and Kissinger, who was charged with overseeing all covert operations on Nixon's behalf,{{sfn|Prados|2006|page=[https://books.google.no/books?id=3OCDelYICIsC&amp;pg=PA382 382]}} kept the 40 Committee out of the loop on almost all the major and sensitive decisions, and the 40 Committee stopped having meetings; in 1972 it only met once.{{sfn|Prados|2006|pages=[https://books.google.no/books?id=3OCDelYICIsC&amp;pg=PA385 385–387]}}

==Operations Advisory Group==
On February 18, 1976, 40 committee was replaced by the '''Operations Advisory Group''', in accordance with [[Executive Order 11905]] issued by [[Gerald Ford]].  The new group was composed of the [[National Security Advisor (United States)|President's Assistant for National Security Affairs]], the Secretaries of [[United States Secretary of State|State]] and [[United States Secretary of Defense|Defense]], the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], and the [[Director of Central Intelligence]].&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/39313.pdf|format=PDF|title=Proposals for Intelligence Reorganization, 1949-2004|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NSC Special Coordination Committee==
The following year, on May 13, 1977, President [[Jimmy Carter]] issued Executive Order 11985 which updated the previous order, and renamed the Operations Advisory Group to the '''NSC Special Coordination Committee''' (SCC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/eo/eo-11985.htm|title=Executive Order 11985|date=May 13, 1977|publisher=Federation of American Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Security Planning Group==
Under the Reagan administration, the Special Coordination Committee was replaced by the '''National Security Planning Group''' (NSPG) which included the Vice-President, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, the Assistant for National Security Affairs, and the Director of the CIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Covert Action and Accountability: Decision-Making for America's Secret Foreign Policy
|author=Loch K. Johnson|journal=International Studies Quarterly|date=March 1989|jstor=2600495}}&lt;/ref&gt; One level below the NSPG was the Policy Coordination Group (PCG), first known as the Crisis Pre-Planning Group (CPPG); one source describes the PCG as the actual successor to the Special Coordination Committee.{{sfn|Prados|2006|page=[https://books.google.no/books?id=3OCDelYICIsC&amp;pg=PA496 496]}}

==Special Intelligence Office==
In 2002–2003, during the [[George W Bush|Bush Administration]], [[Under Secretary of Defense for Policy]] [[Douglas Feith]] created a special-purpose group encompassing and focusing on all military and intelligence efforts involving [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], and other [[Near East|Near East countries]], as well as all activities falling under the rubric of the [[Global War on Terror]]. This group has been said to have been responsible for [[stovepiping]] selective raw intelligence data, bypassing [[intelligence analysis|analysis processes]] as well as bypassing customary cooperation and coordination with [[NSA]], [[Mossad]], and other intelligence entities in order to shape decisions as to the war with Iraq. Its functions were morphed in the [[Office of Special Plans]], which was subsequently investigated for manipulations of intelligence, unlawful activities, and [[espionage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Palace of Versailles''' ({{lang-fr|Château de Versailles}}; {{IPAc-en|lang|v|ɛər|ˈ|s|aɪ|,_|v|ɜːr|-}} {{respell|vair|SY|,_|vur|-}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LPD|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|vɛʁsaj|lang}}) was the principal royal residence of France from 1682 under [[Louis XIV]] until the start of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789 under [[Louis XVI]]. It is located in the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Yvelines]], in the [[Regions of France|region]] of [[Île-de-France]], about {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=none}} southwest of the centre of [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;''point zero'' at square in front of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The palace is now a ''[[Monument historique]]'' and [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]], notable especially for the ceremonial [[Hall of Mirrors]], the jewel-like [[Royal Opera of Versailles|Royal Opera]], and the royal apartments; for the more intimate royal residences, the [[Grand Trianon]] and [[Petit Trianon]] located within the park; the small rustic [[Hameau de la Reine|Hameau]] (Hamlet) created for [[Marie Antoinette]]; and the vast [[Gardens of Versailles]] with fountains, canals, and geometric flower beds and groves, laid out by [[André le Nôtre]]. The Palace was stripped of all its furnishings after the French Revolution, but many pieces have been returned and many of the palace rooms have been restored.

In 2017 the Palace of Versailles received 7,700,000 visitors, making it the second-most visited monument in the [[Île-de-France]] region, just behind the [[Louvre]] and ahead of the [[Eiffel Tower]].&lt;ref&gt;Annual Report of the Regional Committee on Tourism of the Ile-de-France Region, cited in ''La Croix'', 22 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of the Palace of Versailles}}

===The hunting lodge and château of Louis XIII===
[[File:Le château de Versailles en 1660-1664, par Israël Silvestre - Versailles.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The garden facade of the chateau of [[Louis XIII]] in 1660-64. (Engraving by [[Israël Silvestre]])]]

[[File:Zuidgevel Corps de logis rond 1675 Anonieme schilder.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The facade of the palace facing the garden in 1675. The terrace was replaced by the [[Hall of Mirrors]]]]

The site of the Palace was first occupied by a small village and church, surrounded by forests filled with abundant game. It was owned by the [[Gondi family]] and the priory of Saint Julian. King [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] went hunting there in 1589, and returned in 1604 and 1609, staying in the village inn. His son, the future [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], came on his own hunting trip there in 1607. After he became King in 1610, Louis XIII returned to the village, bought some land, and in 1623-24 built a modest two-story hunting lodge the site of the current marble courtyard.&lt;ref name=Hoog369&gt;Hoog 1996, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt; He was staying there in November 1630 during the event known as the [[Day of the Dupes]], when the enemies of the King's chief minister, [[Cardinal Richelieu]], aided by the King's mother, [[Marie de' Medici]], tried to take over the government. The King defeated the plot and sent his mother into exile.{{Sfn|Lacaille|2012|page=3}}

After this event, Louis XIII decided to make his hunting lodge at Versailles into a château. The King purchased the surrounding territory from the Gondi family, and in 1631–1634 had the architect [[Philibert Le Roy]] replace the hunting lodge with a château of brick and stone with classical pilasters in the doric style and high slate-covered roofs, surrounding the courtyard of the original hunting lodge. The gardens and park were also enlarged, laid out by [[Jacques Boyceau]] and his nephew, Jacques de Menours (1591–1637), and reached essentially the size they have today.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Under Louis XIV the garden and park were enlarged further, eventually reaching 2,473 [[Hectare|ha]]; they are now only 815 ha (Hoog 1996, p. 372).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoog369/&gt;{{Sfn|Lacaille|2012|pages=4-5}}&lt;ref&gt;Garriques 2001, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The palace of Louis XIV===
Louis XIV first visited the château on a hunting trip in 1651 at the age of twelve, but returned only occasionally until his marriage to [[Maria Theresa of Spain]] in 1660 and the death of [[Cardinal Mazarin]] in 1661, after which he suddenly acquired a passion for the site.&lt;ref&gt;Constans 1998, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; He decided to rebuild, embellish and enlarge the château and to transform it into a setting for both rest and for elaborate entertainments on a grand scale.{{Sfn|Lacaille|2012|pages=4-5}}&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Palace-of-Versailles|title=Palace of Versailles {{!}} palace, Versailles, France|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=28 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first phase of the expansion (c. 1661–1678) was designed and supervised by the architect [[Louis Le Vau]]. Initially he added two wings to the forecourt, one for servants quarters and kitchens, the other for stables.&lt;ref&gt;Hoog 1996, p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1668 he added three new wings built of stone, known as the ''envelope'', to the north, south and west (the garden side) of the original château. These buildings had nearly-flat roofs covered with lead. The king also commissioned the landscape designer [[André Le Nôtre]] to create the most magnificent gardens in Europe, embellished with fountains, statues, basins, canals, geometric flower beds and groves of trees. He also added two grottos in the Italian style and an immense orangerie to house fruit trees, as well as a zoo with a central pavilion for exotic animals.{{Sfn|Lacaille|2012|pages=4-5}} After Le Vau's death in 1670, the work was taken over and completed by his assistant [[François d'Orbay]].&lt;ref&gt;Ayers 2004, pp. 334–336.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main floor (above the ground floor) of the new palace contained two symmetrical sets of apartments, one for the king and the other for the queen, looking over the gardens. The two apartments were separated by a marble terrace, overlooking the garden, with a fountain in the center. Each set of apartments was connected to the ground floor with a ceremonial stairway, and each had seven rooms, aligned in a row; a vestibule, a room for the guards, an antechamber, chamber, a large cabinet or office; a smaller bedroom, and a smaller cabinet. On the ground floor under the King's apartment was another apartment, the same size, designed for his private life, and decorated on the theme of Apollo, the Sun god, his personal emblem. Under the Queen's apartment was the apartment of the Grand Dauphin, the heir to the throne.{{Sfn|Lacaille|2012|page=3-6}}

The interior decoration was assigned to [[Charles Le Brun]]. Le Brun supervised the work of a large group of sculptors and painters, called the ''Petite Academie'', who crafted and painted the ornate walls and ceilings.{{Sfn|Lacaille|2012|page=3=6}} Le Brun also supervised the design and installation of countless statues in the gardens.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1985a, pp. 17–19.&lt;/ref&gt; The grand stairway to the King's apartment was soon redecorated almost as soon as it was completed with plaques of colored marble and trophies of arms, tapestries, and balconies, so the members of the court could observe the processions of the King.{{Sfn|Lacaille|2012|page=3=6}}

In 1670, Le Vau added a new pavilion northwest of the chateau, called the [[Grand Trianon|Trianon]], for the King's relaxation in the hot summers. It was surrounded by flowerbeds and decorated entirely with blue and white [[porcelain]], in imitation of the Chinese style.{{Sfn|Lacaille|2012|page=8}}

===Enlargement of the Palace (1678-1715)===
The King increasingly spent his days in Versailles, and the government, court, and courtiers, numbering six to seven thousand persons, crowded into the buildings. The King ordered a further enlargement, which he entrusted to the young architect [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]]. Hadouin-Mansart added two large new wings on either side of the original Cour Royale (Royal Courtyard). He also replaced Le Vau's large terrace, facing the garden on the west, with what became the most famous room of the palace, the [[Hall of Mirrors]]. Mansart also built the Petites Écuries and Grandes Écuries (stables) across the Place d'Armes, on the eastern side of the château. The King wished a quiet place to relax away from the ceremony of the Court. In 1687 Hardouin-Mansart began the [[Grand Trianon]], or Trianon de Marbre (Marble Trianon), replacing Le Vau's 1668 Trianon de Porcelaine in the northern section of the park. In 1682 Louis XIV was able to proclaim Versailles his principal residence and the seat of the government and was able to give rooms in the palace to almost all of his [[courtiers]].{{Sfn|Lacaille|2012|pages=15-20}}

After the death of [[Maria Theresa of Spain]] in 1683, Louis XIV undertook the enlargement and remodeling of the royal apartments in the original part of the palace, within the former hunting lodge built by his father. He instructed Mansart to begin the construction of the [[Royal Chapel of Versailles]], which towered over the rest of the palace. Hardouin-Mansart died in 1708 and so the chapel was completed by his assistant [[Robert de Cotte]] in 1710.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers 2004, pp. 336–339; Maral 2010, pp. 215–229.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Palace of Louis XV===
[[File:Nicolas Cochin Masked Ball 1745.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A masked ball in the [[Hall of Mirrors]] (1745) by [[Nicolas Cochin]]]]
Louis XIV died in 1715, and the young new King, [[Louis XV]], just five years old, and his government were moved temporarily from Versailles to Paris under the regency of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]]. In 1722, when the King came of age, he moved his residence and the government back to Versailles, where it remained until the French Revolution in 1789.{{sfn|Lacaille|2012|pages=15-20}} Louis XV remained faithful to the original plan of his great-grandfather, and made few changes to the exteriors of Versailles. His main contributions were the construction of the [[Salon d'Hercule|Salon of Hercules]], which connected the main building of the Palace with the north wing and the chapel (1724–36); and the royal opera theater, designed by [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]], and built between 1769 and 1770. The new theater was completed in time for the celebration of the wedding of the Dauphin, the future [[Louis XVI]], and Archduchess [[Marie Antoinette]] of Austria. He also made numerous additions and changes to the royal apartments, where he, the Queen, his daughters, and his heir lived. In 1738, Louis XV remodeled the [[Petit appartement du roi|king's ''petit appartement'']] on the north side of the Cour de Marbre, originally the entrance court of the old château. He discreetly provided accommodations in another part of the palace for his famous mistresses, [[Madame de Pompadour]] and later [[Madame du Barry]].

The extension of the King's ''petit appartement'' necessitated the demolition of the Ambassador's Staircase, one of the most admired features of Louis XIV's palace, which left the Palace without a grand staircase entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Versailles| author=Tony Spawforth| p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Louis XV ordered the demolition of the north wing facing onto the ''Cour Royale'', which had fallen into serious disrepair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Versailles| author=Tony Spawforth| p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commissioned Gabriel to rebuild it in a more neoclassical style. The new wing was completed in 1780.

===Louis XVI, and the Palace during the Revolution===
[[File:La Fayette and Marie Antoinette 6th october 1789.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Louis XVI]] and [[Marie Antoinette]], with [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]], face the angry crowd from their balcony at Versailles, October 6, 1789]]
Louis XVI was constrained by the worsening financial situation of the kingdom from making major changes to the palace, so that he primarily focused on improvements to the royal apartments.&lt;ref name=Hoog&gt;Hoog 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Louis XVI gave Marie Antoinette the Petit Trianon in 1774. The Queen made extensive changes to the interior, and added a theater, the Théâtre de la Reine. She also totally transformed the arboretum planted during the reign of Louis XV into what became known as the [[Hameau de la Reine]]. This was a picturesque collection of buildings modeled after a rural French hamlet, where the Queen and her courtiers could play at being peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Hoog 1996, pp. 373–374.&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen was at the Petit Trianon in 1789 when she first learned of the beginning of the [[French Revolution]] in July 1789.

In 1783, the Palace was the site of the signing of three treaties of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)]], in which the United Kingdom recognized the independence of the United States.

The King and Queen learned of the storming of the [[Bastille]] in Paris on July 14, 1789. while they were at the Palace, and remained isolated there as the Revolution in Paris spread. The growing anger in Paris led to the [[Women's March on Versailles]] on 5 October 1789. A crowd of several thousand men and women, protesting the high price and scarcity of bread, marched from the markets of Paris to Versailles. They took weapons from the city armory, besieged the Palace, and compelled the King and Royal family and the members of the National Assembly to return with them to Paris the following day.{{Sfn|Lacaille|2012|pages 16-17}}

As soon as the royal family departed, the Palace was closed, awaiting their return. In 1792, the [[National Convention|Convention]], the new revolutionary government, ordered the transfer of all the paintings and sculptures from the Palace to the [[Louvre]]. In 1793, the Convention declared the abolition of the monarchy, and ordered all of the royal property in the Palace to be sold at auction. The auction took place between 25 August 1793 and 11 August 1794. The furnishings and art of the Palace, including the furniture, mirrors, baths and kitchen equipment, were sold in seventeen thousand lots. All fleurs-de-lys and royal emblems on the buildings were chambered or chiseled off. The empty buildings were turned into a storehouse for furnishings, art and libraries confiscated from the nobility. The empty grand apartments were opened for tours beginning in 1793, and a small museum of French paintings and art school was opened in some of the empty rooms.{{Sfn|Lacaille|2012|pages 18}}

===19th century - history museum and government venue ===
[[File:L'Opéra-visite de la reine Victoria 1855.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Banquet for Queen Victoria hosted by [[Napoleon III]] in the [[Royal Opera of Versailles]], August 1855]] 
[[File:Wernerprokla.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Proclamation of the [[German Empire]], 18 January 1871'', 1877 by [[Anton von Werner]]]]
When Napoleon Bonaparte became Emperor of the French in 1804, he considered making Versailles his residence, but abandoned the idea because of the cost of the renovation. Prior to his marriage with Marie-Louise in 1810, he had the Grand Trianon restored and refurnished as a springtime residence for himself and his family, in the style of furnishing that it is seen today.{{Sfn|Lacaille|2012|page=19}}

In 1815, with the final downfall of Napoleon, [[Louis XVIII]], the younger brother of Louis XVI, became King, and considered returning the royal residence to Versailles, where he had been born. He ordered the restoration of the royal apartments, but the task and cost was too great. Neither he nor his successor [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] lived at Versailles.{{Sfn|Lacaille|2012|page=19}}

The [[French Revolution of 1830]] brought a new monarch, [[Louis Philippe I|Louis-Philippe]] to power, and a new ambition for Versailles. He did not reside at Versailles, but began the creation of the Museum of the History of France, dedicated to "all the glories of France", located in the south wing of the Palace, which had been used to house some members of the royal family. The museum was begun in 1833 and inaugurated on 30 June 1837. Its most famous room is the [[Galerie des Batailles]] (Hall of Battles), which lies on most of the length of the second floor.&lt;ref name=Hoog/&gt; Louis Philippe had the far end of the south wing of the ''Cour Royale'' demolished and rebuilt to match the Gabriel wing of 1780 opposite, which gave greater uniformity of appearance to the front entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Versailles| author=Tony Spawforth| p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum project largely came to a halt when Louis Philippe was overthrown in 1848, though the paintings of French heroes and great battles still remain in the south wing.

Emperor [[Napoleon III]] used the Palace on occasion as a stage for grand ceremonies. One of the most lavish was the banquet that he hosted for [[Queen Victoria]] in the [[Royal Opera of Versailles]] on August 25, 1855.

During the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870-1871, the Palace was occupied by the general staff of the victorious German Army. Parts of the chateau, including the Gallery of Mirrors, were turned into a military hospital. The creation of the [[German Empire]], combining Prussia and the surrounding German states under [[William I, German Emperor|William I]], was formally proclaimed in the Hall of Mirrors on January 18, 1871. The Germans remained in the Palace until the signing of the armistice in March 1871. In that month, the government of the new [[Third French Republic]], which had departed Paris during the War for Tours and then Bordeaux, moved into the Palace. The National Assembly held its meetings in the Opera House.{{Sfn|Lacaille|2012|page=12}}

The uprising of the [[Paris Commune]] in May, 1871, prevented the French government, under [[Adolphe Thiers]], from returning immediately to Paris. The military operation which suppressed the Commune at the end of the month was directed from Versailles, and the prisoners of the Commune were marched there and put on trial in military courts. In 1875 a second parliamentary body, the [[French Senate]], was created, and held its meetings for the election of a President of the Republic in a new hall created in 1876 in the south wing of the Palace. The [[French Senate]] continues to meet in the Palace on special occasions, such as the amendment of the French Constitution. {{Sfn|Lacaille|2012|page=20}}

===20th century===
[[File:William Orpen - The Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[The Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors, Versailles, 28 June 1919]]'' by [[William Orpen]]]]
The end of the 19th and the early 20th century saw the beginning of restoration efforts at the Palace, first led by [[Pierre de Nolhac]], poet and scholar and the first conservator, who began his work in 1892. The conservation and restoration was interrupted by two world wars, but has continued until the present day.{{Sfn|Lacaille|2013|page 13}}

The Palace briefly returned to the world stage in June, 1919, when the [[Treaty of Versailles]], formally ending the First World War, was signed in the [[Hall of Mirrors]]. Between 1925 and 1928, the American philanthropist and multi-millionaire [[John D. Rockefeller]] gave $2,166,000, the equivalent of about thirty million dollars today, to restore and refurnish the palace.&lt;ref&gt;Iverson, Jeffrey, ''France Today'', July 19, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

More work took place after World War II, with the restoration of the [[Royal Opera of Versailles]]. The theater was reopened in 1957, in the presence of Queen [[Elizabeth II of Britain]].

In 1978, parts of the Palace were heavily damaged in a [[1978 Palace of Versailles bombing|bombing committed by Breton terrorists]].

The restoration initiatives launched by the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] have proven to be perhaps more costly than the expenditures of the palace in the [[Ancien Régime]]. Starting in the 1950s, when the museum of Versailles was under the directorship of [[Gérald van der Kemp]], the objective was to restore the palace to its state&amp;nbsp;– or as close to it as possible&amp;nbsp;– in 1789 when the royal family left the palace. Among the early projects was the repair of the roof over the Hall of Mirrors; the publicity campaign brought international attention to the plight of post-war Versailles and garnered much foreign money including a grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. Concurrently, in the [[Soviet Union]] ([[Russia]] since 26 December 1991), the restoration of the [[Pavlovsk Palace]] located 25 kilometers from the center of Leningrad&amp;nbsp;– today's [[Saint Petersburg]]&amp;nbsp;– brought the attention of French [[Ministry of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]], including that of the curator of Versailles.&lt;ref name="Massie 1990"&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1990}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war when Soviet authorities were restoring the palace, which had been gutted by the retreating Nazi forces, they recreated the silk fabrics by using preserved 18th-century remnants.&lt;ref name="Massie 1990"/&gt;

When these results and the high quality achieved were brought to the attention of the French Minister of Culture, he revived 18th-century weaving techniques so as to reproduce the silks used in the decoration of Versailles.&lt;ref name="Massie 1990"/&gt; The two greatest achievements of this initiative are seen today in wall hangings used in the restoration of the ''chambre de la reine'' in the ''grand appartement de reine'' and the ''chambre du roi'' in the ''appartement du roi''. While the design used for the ''chambre du roi'' was, in fact, from the original design to decorate the ''chambre de la reine'', it nevertheless represents a great achievement in the ongoing restoration at Versailles. Additionally, this project, which took over seven years to achieve, required several hundred kilograms of silver and gold to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyer|1989}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more costly endeavours for the museum and France's Fifth Republic has been to repurchase as much of the original furnishings as possible. Consequently, because furniture with a royal provenance&amp;nbsp;– and especially furniture that was made for Versailles&amp;nbsp;– is a highly sought after commodity on the international market, the museum has spent considerable funds on retrieving much of the palace's original furnishings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kemp|1976}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===

In 2003, a new restoration initiative&amp;nbsp;– the "Grand Versailles" project&amp;nbsp;– was started, which began with the replanting of the gardens, which had lost over 10,000 trees during [[Cyclone Lothar and Martin|Hurricane Lothar]] on 26 December 1999. One part of the initiative, the restoration of the [[Hall of Mirrors]], was completed in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leloup|2006}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major project was the further restoration of the backstage areas [[Royal Opera of Versailles]], which was completed in 2009.

==Ownership and management==
The Palace of Versailles is owned by the French state. Its formal title is the [[Public Establishment of the Palace, Museum and National Estate of Versailles]] Since 1995, it has been run as a Public Establishment, with an independent administration and management supervised by the French [[Ministry of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]]. The current Chairperson of the Public Establishment is [[Catherine Pégard]].&lt;ref&gt;Site of the Public Establishment of the Chateau of Versailles (en.chateauversailles.fr)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Palace of Versailles offers a visual history of French architecture from the 17th century to the end of the 18th century. It began with the original château, with the brick and stone and sloping slate mansard roofs of the [[Louis XIII style]] used by architect [[Philibert Le Roy]]. It then became grander and more monumental, with the addition of the colonnades and flat roofs of the new royal apartments in the French classical or [[Louis XIV style]], as designed by [[Louis Le Vau]] and later [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]]. It concluded in the lighter and more graceful neoclassical [[Louis XVI style]] of the [[Petit Trianon]], completed by [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]] in 1768.

The palace was largely completed by the death of Louis XIV in 1715. The eastern facing palace has a U-shaped layout, with the [[corps de logis]] and symmetrical advancing secondary wings terminating with the Dufour Pavilion on the south and the Gabriel Pavilion to the north, creating an expansive [[cour d'honneur]] known as the Royal Court (Cour Royale). Flanking the Royal Court are two enormous asymmetrical wings that result in a facade of {{convert|402|m|ft}} in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=History of Art|newspaper=Visual Arts Cork|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/versailles-palace.htm|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Encompassing {{convert|721182|sqft|m2|0|order=flip}} the palace has 700 rooms, more than 2,000 windows, 1,250 fireplaces and 67 staircases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Palace of Versailles|newspaper=Dimensions Info|url=http://www.dimensionsinfo.com/what-is-the-size-of-versailles-castle/|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The façade of Louis XIII's original château is preserved on the entrance front. Built of red brick and cut stone embellishments, the U-shaped layout surrounds a black-and-white marble courtyard. In the center, a 3-storey ''[[avant-corps]]'' fronted with eight red marble columns supporting a gilded wrought-iron balcony is surmounted with a triangle of lead statuary surrounding a large clock, whose hands were stopped upon the death of Louis XIV. The rest of the façade is completed with columns, painted and gilded wrought-iron balconies and dozens of stone tables decorated with consoles holding marble busts of Roman emperors. Atop the mansard slate roof are elaborate dormer windows and gilt lead roof dressings that were added by Hardouin-Mansart in 1679–1681. 
 
Inspired by the architecture of baroque Italian villas, but executed in the French classical style, the garden front and wings were encased in white cut [[ashlar]] stone known as the ''enveloppe'' in 1668-1671 by Le Vau and modified by Hardouin-Mansart in 1678–1679.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers 2004, pp. 334–335, 337.&lt;/ref&gt; The exterior features an arcaded, [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] ground floor, supporting a main floor with round-headed windows divided by reliefs and pilasters or columns. The attic storey has square windows and pilasters and crowned by a balustrade bearing sculptured trophies and flame pots dissimulating a flat roof.

==Royal Apartments==
[[File:Versailles - Plan du premier étage de l'avant corps - Architecture Françoise Tome4 Livre7 Pl8 (apts colored).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Plan of the main floor in the central part of the palace (c. 1742),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blondel|1752–1756}}, vol. 4 (1756), book 7, plate 8; {{harvnb|Nolhac|1898}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=biMoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA49 p. 49] (dates Blondel's plan to c. 1742).&lt;/ref&gt; showing the ''[[grand appartement du roi]]'' in dark blue, the ''[[appartement du roi]]'' in medium blue, the ''[[petit appartement du roi]]'' in light blue, the ''[[grand appartement de la reine]]'' in yellow, and the ''[[petit appartement de la reine]]'' in red]]

The construction in 1668–1671 of [[Louis Le Vau|Le Vau's]] ''enveloppe'' around the outside of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII's]] red brick and white stone château added state apartments for the king and the queen. The addition was known at the time as the ''château neuf'' (new château). The ''grands appartements'' (Grand Apartments, also referred to as the State Apartments&lt;ref&gt;Saule &amp; Meyrer 2000, pp. 18, 22; Michelin Tyre 1989, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;) include the ''[[grand appartement du roi]]'' and the ''[[grand appartement de la reine]]''. They occupied the main or principal floor of the ''château neuf'', with three rooms in each apartment facing the garden to the west and four facing the garden parterres to the north and south, respectively. The private apartments of the king (the ''[[appartement du roi]]'' and the ''[[petit appartement du roi]]'') and those of the queen (the ''[[petit appartement de la reine]]'') remained in the ''château vieux'' (old château). Le Vau's design for the state apartments closely followed Italian models of the day, including the placement of the apartments on the main floor (the ''[[piano nobile]]'', the next floor up from the ground level), a convention the architect borrowed from Italian palace design.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berger|1985b|ps=24–25}}; {{harvnb|Ayers|2004|pg=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The king's State Apartment consisted of an [[enfilade]] of seven rooms, each dedicated to one of the known [[Solar System|planets]] and their associated titular [[Roman deity]]. The queen's apartment formed a parallel enfilade with that of the ''grand appartement du roi''. After the addition of the [[Hall of Mirrors]] (1678–1684) the king's apartment was reduced to five rooms (until the reign of Louis XV, when two more rooms were added) and the queen's to four.

The queen's apartments served as the residence of three queens of France - Marie-Thérèse d'Autriche, wife of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XIV]], [[Maria Leszczyńska|Marie Leczinska]], wife of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], and [[Marie-Antoinette]], wife of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]. Additionally, Louis XIV's granddaughter-in-law, [[Princess Marie-Adélaïde of Savoy]], ''duchesse de Bourgogne'', wife of the [[Louis, Duke of Burgundy|Petit Dauphin]], occupied these rooms from 1697 (the year of her marriage) to her death in 1712.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Six kings were born in this room: [[Philip V of Spain]], [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], [[Louis XVII of France|Louis XVII]], [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], and [[Charles X of France|Charles X]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the Hall of Mirrors between 1678 and 1686 coincided with a major alteration to the State Apartments. They were originally intended as his residence, but the King transformed them into galleries for his finest paintings, and venues for his many receptions for courtiers. During the season from [[All-Saints Day]] in November until [[Easter]], these were usually held three times a week, from six to ten in the evening, with various entertainments.{{Sfn|Saule|2013|page=20}}

====The Salon of Hercules====
This was originally a chapel. It was rebuilt beginning in 1712 as a showcase for the painting ''Meal at the House of Simon the Pharisee'' by [[Paolo Veronese]], which was a gift to Louis XIV from the [[Republic of Venice]] in 1664. The painting on the ceiling, ''The Apotheosis of Hercules'', by [[François Lemoyne]], was completed in 1712, and gave the room its name. {{Sfn|Saule|2013|page=20}}

====The Salon of Abundance====
The Salon of Abundance was the antechamber to the Cabinet of Curios (now the Games Room), which displayed Louis XIV's collection of precious jewels and rare objects. Some of the objects in the collection are depicted in [[René-Antoine Houasse]]'s painting ''Abundance and Liberality'' (1683), located on the ceiling over the door opposite the windows.

====The Salon of Venus====
This salon was used for serving light meals during evening receptions. The principal feature in this room is [[Jean Warin]]'s life-size statue of Louis XIV in the costume of a Roman emperor. On the ceiling in a gilded oval frame is another painting by Houasse, ''Venus subjugating the Gods and Powers'' (1672-1681). [[Trompe l'oeil]] paintings and sculpture around the ceiling illustrate mythological themes.{{Sfn|Saule|2013|page=22}}

====The Salon of Mercury====
The Salon of Mercury was the original State Bedchamber when Louis XIV officially moved the court and government to the Palace in 1682. The bed is a replica of the original commissioned by King Louis-Philippe in the 19th century when he turned the Palace into a Museum. The ceiling paintings by the Flemish artist [[Jean Baptiste de Champaigne]] depicts the god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] in his chariot, drawn by a rooster, and [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Ptolemy]] surrounded by scholars and philosophers. The Automaton Clock was made for the King by the royal clockmaker Antoine Morand in 1706. When it chimes the hour, figures of Louis XIV and Fame descend from a cloud.{{Sfn|Saule|2013|page=25}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====The Salon of Mars====
The Salon of Mars was used by the royal guards until 1782, and was decorated on a military theme with helmets and trophies. It was turned into a concert room between 1684 and 1750, with galleries for musicians on either side. Portraits of [[Louis XV]] and his Queen, [[Marie Leszczinska]], by the Flemish artist [[Carle Van Loo]] decorate the room today.

====The Salon of Apollo====
The Salon of Apollo was the royal throne room under Louis XIV, and was the setting for formal audiences. The eight-foot high silver throne was melted down in 1689 to help pay the costs of an expensive war, and was replaced by a more modest throne of gilded wood. The central painting on the ceiling, by [[Charles de la Fosse]], depicts the Sun Chariot of [[Apollo]], the King's favorite emblem, pulled by four horses and surrounded by the four seasons.

====The Salon of Diana====
The Salon of Diana was used by Louis XIV as a billiards room, and had galleries from which courtiers could watch him play. The decoration of the walls and ceiling depicts scenes from the life of the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. The celebrated [[Bust of Louis XIV (Bernini)|bust of Louis XIV by Bernini]] made during the famous sculptor's visit to France in 1665, is on display here. {{Sfn|Saule|2013|page=23}}

====Private apartments of the King====
{{Main|Appartement du roi|Petit appartement du roi}}

The apartments of the King were the heart of the chateau; they were in the same location as the rooms of Louis XIII, the creator of the chateau, on the first floor (second floor US style). They were set aside for the personal use of [[Louis XIV]] in 1683. He and his successors [[Louis XV]] and [[Louis XVI]] used these rooms for official functions, such as the ceremonial ''lever'' ("waking up") and the ''coucher'' ("going to bed") of the monarch, which were attended by a crowd of courtiers.

The King's apartment was accessed from the Hall of Mirrors from the ''Oeil de Boeuf'' antechamber past the Guardroom and the ''Grand Couvert'', the ceremonial room where Louis XIV often took his evening meals, seated alone at a table in front of the fireplace. His spoon, fork, and knife were brought to him in a golden box. The courtiers could watch as he dined.{{Sfn|Saule|2016|page=32}}

The King's bedchamber had originally been the State Drawing Room and had been used by Queen Marie-Theresa, but after her death in 1701 Louis XIV took it over to use as his own bedroom and died there on September 1, 1715. Both Louis XV and Louis XVI continued to use the bedroom for their official awakening and going to bed. On October 6, 1789, from the balcony of this room Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, joined by the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], looked down on the hostile crowd in the courtyard, shortly before the King was forced to return to Paris.{{Sfn|Saule|2016|page=32}}

The bed of the King is placed beneath a carved relief by [[Nicolas Coustou]] entitled '' France watching over the sleeping King''. The decoration includes several paintings set into the paneling, including a self-portrait of [[Antony Van Dyck]].{{Sfn|Saule|2016|page=32}}

====Private apartments of The Queen====
{{Main|Petit appartement de la reine}}

The ''petit appartement de la reine'' is a suite of rooms that were reserved for the personal use of the queen. Originally arranged for the use of the [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Marie-Thérèse]], consort of [[Louis XIV]], the rooms were later modified for use by [[Maria Leszczyńska|Marie Leszczyńska]] and finally for [[Marie-Antoinette]]. The Queen's apartments and the King's Apartments were laid out on the same design, each suite having seven rooms. Both suites had ceilings painted with scenes from mythology; the King's ceilings featured male figures, the Queen's featured females.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Grand Gallery is a set of three highly decorated reception rooms, dedicated to the celebration of the political and military successes of Louis XIV, and used for important ceremonies, celebrations and receptions.

===The War Salon===
The War Salon commemorates the victorious campaign of Louis XIV against the Dutch, which ended in 1678. The centerpiece is an enormous sculpted medallion of Louis XIV, on horseback, crossing the Rhine in 1672, created by [[Antoine Coysevox]]. Above the fireplace is a painting of [[Clio]], the Muse of History, recording the exploits of the King.

===The Hall of Mirrors===
{{Main|Hall of Mirrors}}
The Galerie des Glaces (Hall of Mirrors), is perhaps the most famous room in the château of Versailles. It took the place of the rooftop terrace overlooking the gardens which formerly connected the apartments of the King and Queen. The construction of the room began in 1678 and finished in 1689. The gallery is more than {{convert|70|m|ft}} long, and it is lined with 17 wide arcaded mirrors, designed to match and reflect the windows opposite facing the gardens. [[Charles Le Brun]] painted thirty scenes of the early reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] on the ceiling. The centerpiece is a painting of the King titled, "The King Governing Alone". It shows Louis XIV, facing the powers of Europe, turning away from his pleasures to accept a crown of immortality from Glory, with the encouragement of Mars.{{Sfn|Saule|2013|page=30}}

The hall was originally furnished with solid silver furniture designed by Le Brun, but these furnishings were melted down in 1689 to help pay for war expenses. The King kept a silver throne, usually located in the Salon of Apollo, which was brought to the Hall of Mirrors for formal ceremonies, such as the welcome of foreign ambassadors, including a delegation from the [[King of Siam]] in 1686. It was also used for large events, such as full-dress and masked balls. Light was provided by candelabra on large gilded ''guerdirons'' lining the hall. Those on display today were made in 1770 for the marriage of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, based on the moldings of earlier silver versions made by LeBrun that had been melted down. The twenty-four crystal chandeliers were hung only for special occasions. Courtiers gathered in the Hall to watch the King walk from his apartments to the chapel, and sometimes took the occasion to present him with requests.
{{Sfn|Saule|2013|page=30}}

===The Peace Salon===
The Peace Salon is decorated to illustrate the role of France as the arbiter and peacemaker of Europe under [[Louis XV]]. The painting on the ceiling by [[François Lemoyne]], ''Louis XV offering an olive branch to Europe'', illustrates this theme. During the reign of Louis XV, the Queen, [[Marie Leszczyńska]], used this salon as a music room, organizing concerts of secular and religious music each Sunday.{{Sfn|Saule|2013|page=31}}

==Royal Chapel==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Chapel was the last building at Versailles to be completed during the reign of Louis XIV. It was consecrated in 1710, and was dedicated to [[Louis IX of France]], the ancestor and patron saint of the King. Construction was begun by [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart|Hardouin-Mansart]] in 1699, and was completed by de Corte. Daily services, wedding ceremonies, and baptisms were held in this chapel until 1789. Like other royal chapels, it had two levels: the King and family worshipped in the Royal Gallery on the upper level, while ordinary courtiers stood on the ground level.&lt;ref&gt;"Encyclopedia Britannica"&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings on the ceiling display scenes depicting the three figures of the trinity. In the center is ''The Glory of the Father Announcing the Coming of the Messiah'' by [[Antoine Coypel]], above the altar is ''The Resurrection of Christ'', and above the royal gallery is ''The Holy Spirit Descending Upon the Virgin and the Apostles''. The corridor and vestibule that connected the Chapel and the State Apartments included later art, commissioned by Louis XV, intended to portray the link between Divinity and the King: a statue of ''Glory Holding the Medallion of Louis XV'', by Antoine Vassé; and ''Royal Magnanimity'' by Jacques Bousseau.{{Sfn|Saule|2013|page=16}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The [[Royal Opera of Versailles]] was originally commissioned by Louis XIV in 1682 and was to be built at the end of the North Wing with a design by Mansart and Vigarani. However, due to the expense of the King's continental wars, the project was put aside. The idea was revived by Louis XV with a new design by [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]] in 1748, but this also was temporarily put aside. The project was revived and rushed ahead for the planned celebration of the marriage of the Dauphin, the future [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], and [[Marie-Antoinette]]. For economy and speed, the new opera was built almost entirely of wood, which also gave it very high quality acoustics. The wood was painted to resemble marble, and the ceiling was decorated with a painting of the Apollo, the god of the arts, preparing crowns for illustrious artists, by [[Louis Jean-Jacques Durameau]]. The sculptor [[Augustin Pajou]] added statuary and reliefs to complete the decoration. The new Opera was inaugurated on May 16, 1770, as part of the celebration of the royal wedding.{{Sfn|Saule|2013|page=60}}

In October 1789, early in the [[French Revolution]], the last banquet for the royal guardsmen was hosted by the King in the opera, before he departed for Paris. Following the [[Franco-German War]] in 1871 and then the [[Paris Commune]] until 1875, the French National Assembly met in the opera, until the proclamation of the Third French Republic and the return of the government to Paris.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Shortly after becoming King in 1830, [[Louis Philippe I]] decided to transform the Palace, which was empty of furnishings and in poor repair, into a museum devoted to "All the Glories of France," with paintings and sculpture depicting famous French victories and heroes. The walls of the apartments of the courtiers and lesser members of the royal family on the first floor (second floor U.S. style) were demolished, and turned into a series of several large galleries: the Coronation Room, which displays the celebrated painting of the coronation of Napoleon I by [[Jacques-Louis David]]; the Hall of Battles; commemorating French victories with large-scale paintings; and the 1830 room, which celebrated Louis-Philippe's own coming tol power in the [[French Revolution of 1830]]. Some paintings were brought from the Louvre, including works depicting events in French history by [[Philippe de Champaigne]], [[Pierre Mignard]], [[Laurent de La Hyre]], [[Charles Le Brun]], [[Adam Frans van der Meulen]], [[Nicolas de Largillière]], [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]], [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]], [[Jean-Marc Nattier]], [[Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun]], [[Hubert Robert]], [[Thomas Lawrence]], [[Jacques-Louis David]], and [[Antoine-Jean Gros]]. Others were commissioned especially for the museum by prominent artists of the early 19th century, including [[Eugène Delacroix]], who painted [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]] at the French victory over the British in the [[Battle of Taillebourg]] in 1242. Other painters featured include [[Horace Vernet]] and [[François Gérard]]. A monumental painting by Vernet features Louis Philippe himself, with his sons, posing in front of the gates of the Palace.{{Sfn|Saule|2013|pages=18-19}}

The overthrow of Louis Philippe in 1848 put an end to his grand plans for the museum, but the Gallery of Battles is still as it was, and is passed through by many visitors to the royal apartments and grand salons. Another set of rooms on the first floor has been made into galleries on Louis XIV and his court, displaying furniture, paintings, and sculpture. In recent years, eleven rooms on the ground floor between the Chapel and the Opera have been turned into a history of the palace, with audiovisual displays and models.{{Sfn|Saule|2013|pages=18–19}}

==Gardens and fountains==
{{Main|Gardens of Versailles}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[André Le Nôtre]] began transforming the park and [[gardens of Versailles]] in the early 1660s.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1985b, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; They are the finest example of the ''[[jardin à la française]]'', or the French formal garden. They were originally designed to be viewed from the terrace on the west side of the palace, and to create a grand perspective that reached to the horizon, illustrating the king's complete dominance over nature.

===The Parterre d'Eau and the Parterre and Fountain of Latona===
The features closest to the Palace are the two water [[parterres]], large pools which reflect the facade of the palace. These are decorated with smaller works of sculpture, representing the rivers of France, which are placed so as not to interfere with the reflections in the water. Down a stairway from the Parterre d'Eau is the [[Latona Fountain]], created in 1670, illustrating the story of [[Latona]] taken from the [[Metamorphoses]] of [[Ovid]]. According to the story, when the peasants of [[Lycia]] insulted Latona, the mother of [[Apollo (mythology)|Apollo]] and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], the god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] transformed the peasants into frogs. The fountain was begun in 1670 by Le Nôtre, then enlarged and modified by Hardouin-Mansart, who placed the statue of Latona atop a marble pyramid.{{Sfn|Saule|2013|page=68}}

===Fountain of the Chariot of Apollo and the Grand Canal===
The Grand Perspective of the palace continues from the Fountain of Latona south along a grassy lane, the ''Tapis Vert'' or green carpet, to the '''Basin of the Chariot of Apollo'''. Apollo, the sun god, was the emblem of Louis XIV, featured in much of the decoration of the palace. The chariot rising from the water symbolized the rising of the sun. It was designed by Le Brun and made by the sculptor [[Jean-Baptiste Tuby]] between 1668 and 1670, cast in iron and then gilded. Beyond the fountain, the Grand Canal extends 1800 meters to the south end of the park.{{Sfn|Saule|2013|page=68}}

===North Parterre, Dragon Basin, and Basin of Neptune===
Another group of formal gardens is located on the north side of the water parterre. It includes two ''bosquets'' or groves: the grove of the Three Fountains, The Bosquet of the Arch of Triumph, and north of these, three major fountains, the '''Pyramid Fountain''', '''Dragon Fountain''', and the '''Neptune Fountain'''. The fountains in this area all have a maritime or aquatic theme; the Pyramid Fountain is decorated with [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]], [[Siren (mythology)|Sirens]], dolphins and [[nymph]]s. The Dragon Fountain is one of the oldest at Versailles and has the highest jet of water, twenty-seven meters. It is not actually a dragon, but a [[Python (mythology)|python]], a mythical serpent that was killed by Apollo. The Neptune Fountain was originally decorated only with a circle of large lead basins jetting water; Louis XV added statues of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] and other gods of the sea.{{Sfn|Saule|2013|page=73}}

===South Parterre and the Orangerie===
The South Parterre is located beneath the windows of the queen's apartments and on the roof of the [[Versailles Orangerie|Orangerie]]. It is decorated with box trees and flowers in arabesque patterns. The underground orangerie was designed to hold over a thousand citrus fruit, palms and oleanders, and other southern-climate trees during winter. They are taken out into the gardens from mid-May until mid-October.{{Sfn|Saule|2013|page=73}}

===The Fountains and the Shortage of Water===
Supplying water for the fountains of Versailles was a major problem for the royal government. The 18th-century waterworks at [[Château de Marly|Marly]]— the [[Machine de Marly]] that fed the fountains— was possibly the biggest mechanical system of its time. The water came in from afar on monumental stone [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueducts]] which have long ago fallen into disrepair or been torn down. Some aqueducts, such as the unfinished [[Canal de l'Eure]], which passes through the gardens of the [[Château de Maintenon]], were never completed for want of resources or due to the exigencies of war. Despite enormous investment in canals and machinery for hoisting water, Versailles never had a sufficient water supply for its hundreds of fountains. When the King promenaded in the gardens, fountains were turned on only when the King was approaching them, and turned off after he departed. Today, only a few fountains are supplied with water, and only operate on a very limited schedule.

==The ''Bosquets'' or Groves==

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The largest part of the garden is divided into geometric ''bosquets'', compartment-like groves; eight on the north side of the garden, and six to the south. The ''bosquets'' were created for Louis XIV between 1680 and 1690. They were bordered with high trees and carefully trimmed in cubic forms to resemble rooms with walls of greenery. Each ''bosquet'' had its own theme and fountains, statuary, grottoes, and other decoration. Some were highly formal, like Hardouin-Mansart's Bosquet de la Colonnade, with a circle of columns alternating with fountains, while others imitated nature. They were often used for concerts or theatrical performances. Some of the early groves were altered beyond recognition by later monarchs, but the most famous ''bosquets'', Le Nôtre's Salle de Bal (literally, "ballroom"), also known as the Bosquet des Rocailles (c. 1685), and Hardouin-Mansart's Bosquet de la Colonnade, have both been restored to the way they were under Louis XIV. Other notable groves include Les Dômes, the Bosquet d'Encelade (after [[Enceladus (giant)|Enceladus]], c. 1675), the Théâtre d'Eau (Water Theater), and the Bains d'Apollon (Baths of Apollo). Some are now decorated with contemporary works of art.{{Sfn|Saule|2013|page=78-85}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In 1668 Louis XIV decided to build a smaller palace some distance from the main palace, where he could spend quieter time away from the crowds and formality of his Court. He purchased a village called Trianon which adjoined the park, and constructed a pavilion covered with blue and white porcelain in the fashionable Chinese style; it was finished in 1670, and became known as the Porcelain Trianon. In 1687, he replaced it with the [[Grand Trianon]], a larger and more classical pavilion designed by Mansart, with a terrace and walls faced with different colored slabs of marble. After the Revolution, the Trianon served as a residence for both [[Napoleon I]] and later for King [[Louis-Philippe]] when they visited Versailles. It is decorated today largely as it was under Napoleon and Louis-Philippe.{{Sfn|Saule|2013|page=78-85}}

The [[Petit Trianon]] was created between 1763 and 1768 by [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]] for Louis XV. The square shaped building, with each facade different, was a prototype of [[Neoclassicism in France]]. The most ornate facade, with Corinthian columns, faced the French landscape garden. Louis XVI gave the Petit Trianon as a gift to his bride, Marie-Antoinette. She asked the architect [[Richard Mique]] and painter [[Hubert Robert]] to design a new English-style landscape garden to replace the formal French garden. Not far from the [[Petit Trianon]] she had the Rock Pavilion constructed, and added the classical rotunda of the Temple of Love, built in 1777. In 1780, she built a small theater at the Petit Trianon. In her theater she played a part in one of the first performances of the play ''The [[The Marriage of Figaro (play)|Marriage of Figaro]]'' by [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], which helped ensure its success. She was at the Petit Trianon in July 1789 when she first heard the news from Paris of the storming of the [[Bastille]] and the beginning of the [[French Revolution]].{{Sfn|Saule|2013|page=78-85}}

==The Hamlet of Marie Antoinette==

{{main|Hameau de la Reine}}
[[File:Marie Antoinette amusement at Versailles.JPG|Thumb|right|200px|The Hamlet of the Queen]]
One of the most celebrated features of the park is the [[Hameau de la Reine]], a small rustic hamlet near the Petit Trianon created for Queen Marie Antoinette between 1783 and 1785 by the royal architect [[Richard Mique]] with the help of the painter [[Hubert Robert]]. It replaced a botanical garden created by Louis XV, and consisted of twelve structures, ten of which still exist, in the style of villages in [[Normandy]]. It was designed for the Queen and her friends to amuse themselves by playing peasants, and included a farmhouse with a dairy, a mill, a boudoir, a pigeon loft, a tower in the form of a lighthouse from which one could fish in the pond, a belvedere, a cascade and grotto, and a luxuriously furnished cottage with a billiard room for the Queen.{{Sfn|Saule|2014|page=92}}

==Modern Political and ceremonial functions==
{{See also|Treaty of Versailles (disambiguation){{!}}Treaties of Versailles}}

The palace still serves political functions. Heads of state are regaled in the Hall of Mirrors; the bicameral [[French Parliament]]&amp;mdash;consisting of the [[Senate (France)|Senate]] (''Sénat'') and the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] (''Assemblée nationale'')&amp;mdash;meet in joint session (a [[congress of the French Parliament]]) in Versailles&lt;ref name="Safran"&gt;William Safran, "France" in ''Politics in Europe'' (M. Donald Hancock et al., CQ Sage: 5th ed. 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Constitutional amendments under the French Fifth Republic|revise or otherwise amend]] the [[Constitution of France|French Constitution]], a tradition that came into effect with the promulgation of the 1875 Constitution.{{#tag:ref|Article 9: ''Le siège du pouvoir exécutif et des deux chambres est à Versailles.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/textes/constitution/c1875.htm|title=Constitution of 1875|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} For example, the Parliament met in joint session at Versailles to pass constitutional amendments in June 1999 (for domestic applicability of [[International Criminal Court]] decisions and for gender equality in candidate lists), in January 2000 (ratifying the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]]), and in March 2003 (specifying the "decentralized organization" of the French Republic).&lt;ref name="Safran"/&gt;

In 2009, President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] addressed the [[global financial crisis]] before a congress in Versailles, the first time that this had been done since 1848, when [[Charles-Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]] gave an address before the [[French Second Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2009-06-22-sarkozy-parliment_N.htm Breaking tradition, Sarkozy speaks to parliament] (22 June 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerry M. Rosenberg, "France" in The Concise Encyclopedia of The Great Recession 2007-2012 (Scarecrow Press: 2012), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/11/16/world/europe/ap-eu-france-paris-attacks-the-latest.html The Latest: US Basketball Player James Not Going to France] (16 November 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]], President [[François Hollande]] gave a speech before a rare [[joint session]] of parliament at the Palace of Versailles.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/11/16/world/europe/ap-eu-france-paris-attacks-the-latest.html The Latest: Brother Linked to Paris Attacks in Disbelief] (16 November 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; This was the third time since 1848 that a French president addressed a joint session of the French Parliament at Versailles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2015/11/16/francois-hollande-speech-parliament-france-war-isis.cnn Francois Hollande: 'France is at war'], CNN (16 November 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of Presidents of the National Assembly of France|president of the National Assembly]] has an [[Official residence|official apartment]] at the Palace of Versailles.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Bergougnous, ''Presiding Officers of National Parliamentary Assemblies: A World Comparative Study'' ([[Inter-Parliamentary Union]]: Geneva, 1997), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost==
One of the most baffling aspects to the study of Versailles is the cost&amp;nbsp;– how much [[Louis XIV]] and his successors spent on Versailles. Owing to the nature of the construction of Versailles and the evolution of the role of the palace, construction costs were essentially a private matter. Initially, Versailles was planned to be an occasional residence for Louis XIV and was referred to as the "king's house".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|La Varende|1959}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, much of the early funding for construction came from the king's own purse, funded by revenues received from his ''appanage'' as well as revenues from the province of [[New France]] (Canada), which, while part of France, was a private possession of the king and therefore exempt from the control of the Parliaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bluche|1986|ps=}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}; {{harvnb|Bluche|1991|ps=}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}; {{harvnb|Chouquette|1997}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once [[Louis XIV]] embarked on his building campaigns, expenses for Versailles became more of a matter for public record, especially after [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] assumed the post of finance minister. Expenditures on Versailles have been recorded in the compendium known as the ''Comptes des bâtiments du roi sous le règne de Louis XIV'' and which were edited and published in five volumes by Jules Guiffrey in the 19th century. These volumes provide valuable archival material pursuant to the financial expenditure on all aspects of Versailles such as the payments disbursed for many trades as varied as artists and mole catchers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvnb|Guiffrey|1880–1890}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To counter the costs of Versailles during the early years of Louis XIV's personal reign, Colbert decided that Versailles should be the "showcase" of France.&lt;ref name="Bluche 1991"&gt;{{harvnb|Bluche|1991}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, all materials that went into the construction and decoration of Versailles were manufactured in France. Even the [[mirror]]s used in the decoration of the Hall of Mirrors were made in France. While [[Venice]] in the 17th century had the monopoly on the manufacture of mirrors, Colbert succeeded in enticing a number of artisans from Venice to make the mirrors for Versailles. However, owing to Venetian proprietary claims on the technology of mirror manufacture, the Venetian government ordered the assassination of the artisans to keep the secrets proprietary to the Venetian Republic.&lt;ref name="Bluche 1991"/&gt; To meet the demands for decorating and furnishing Versailles, Colbert nationalised the tapestry factory owned by the [[Gobelin]] family, to become the [[Gobelins Manufactory|Manufacture royale des Gobelins]].&lt;ref name="Bluche 1991"/&gt;

[[File:Louis14-H.jpg|upright|thumb|Louis XIV visits the [[Gobelins Manufactory|Gobelins]] with Colbert, 15 October 1667. [[Tapestry]] from the series, "Histoire du roi" designed by [[Charles Le Brun]] and woven between 1667 and 1672. Articles of Louis XIV's silver furniture are seen in this tapestry.]]

In 1667, the name of the enterprise was changed to the Manufacture royale des Meubles de la Couronne. The Gobelins were charged with all decoration needs of the palace, which was under the direction of Charles Le Brun.&lt;ref name="Bluche 1991"/&gt;

One of the most costly elements in the furnishing of the ''grands appartements'' during the early years of the personal reign of Louis XIV was the silver furniture, which can be taken as a standard&amp;nbsp;– with other criteria&amp;nbsp;– for determining a plausible cost for Versailles. The ''Comptes'' meticulously list the expenditures on the silver furniture&amp;nbsp;– disbursements to artists, final payments, delivery&amp;nbsp;– as well as descriptions and weight of items purchased. Entries for 1681 and 1682 concerning the silver balustrade used in the salon de Mercure serve as an example:

* Year 1681
&lt;blockquote&gt;II. 5 In anticipation: For the silver balustrade for the king's bedroom: 90,000 ''livres''&lt;br&gt;
II. 7 18 November to Sieur du Metz, 43,475 ''livres'' 5 sols for delivery to Sr. Lois and to Sr. de Villers for payment of 142,196 ''livres'' for the silver balustrade that they are making for the king's bedroom and 404 ''livres'' for tax: 48,861 ''livres'' 5 sol.&lt;br&gt;
II. 15 16 June 1681&amp;nbsp;– 23 January 1682 to Sr. Lois and Sr. de Villers silversmiths on account for the silver balustrade that they are making for the king's use (four payments): 88,457 ''livres'' 5 sols.&lt;br&gt;
II. 111 25 March&amp;nbsp;– 18 April to Sr. Lois and Sr. de Villers silversmiths who are working on a silver balustrade for the king, for continued work (two payments): 40,000 ''livres''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Year 1682
&lt;blockquote&gt;II. 129 21 March to Sr. Jehannot de Bartillay 4,970 ''livres'' 12 sols for the delivery to Sr. Lois and de Villers silversmiths for, with 136,457 ''livres'' 5 sol to one and 25,739 ''livres'' 10 sols to another, making the 38 balusters, 17 pilasters, the base and the cornice for the balustrade for the château of Versailles weighing 4,076 ''marc'' at the rate of 41 ''livres'' the ''marc''&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The ''marc'', a unit equal to 8 ounces, was used to weigh silver and gold.&lt;/ref&gt; including 41 ''livres'' 2 sols for tax: 4,970 ''livres'' 12 sols.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Accordingly, the silver balustrade, which contained in excess of one ton of silver, cost in excess of 560,000 ''livres''. It is difficult&amp;nbsp;– if not impossible&amp;nbsp;– to give an accurate rate of exchange between 1682 and today.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;As of 4 April 2008, silver has been trading in New York at US$17.83 an ounce.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Frances Buckland provides valuable information that provides an idea of the true cost of the expenditures at Versailles during the time of Louis XIV. In 1679, Mme de Maintenon stated that the cost of providing light and food for twelve people for one day amounted to slightly more than 14 ''livres''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buckland|1983}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1689, to defray the cost of the [[War of the League of Augsburg]], Louis XIV ordered all the silver furniture and articles of silver at Versailles – including [[chamber pot]]s – sent to the mint to be melted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dangeau|1854–1860}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearly, the silver furniture alone represented a significant outlay in the finances of Versailles. While the decoration of the palace was costly, certain other costs were minimised. For example, labour for construction was often low, due largely to the fact that the army during times of peace and during the winter, when wars were not waged, was pressed into action at Versailles. Additionally, given the quality and uniqueness of the items produced at the Gobelins for use and display at Versailles, the palace served as a venue to showcase not only the success of Colbert's mercantilism, but also to display the finest that France could produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bluche|1986|ps=}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}; {{harvnb|Bluche|1991}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates of the amount spent to build Versailles are speculative. An estimate in 2000 placed the amount spent during the Ancien Régime as US$2&amp;nbsp;billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Littell|2000}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; this figure being, in all probability, an under-evaluation. France's Fifth Republic expenditures alone, directed to restoration and maintenance at Versailles, may have surpassed those of the [[Louis XIV of France|Sun King]].

'''''Peacock'''''  is a British [[narrowboat]]. She was built as a [[Flyboat#Canal carrying company fly-boat|flyboat]] for [[Fellows Morton and Clayton]] (FMC) at [[Saltley]], [[Birmingham]] in 1915, as fleet number 102. FMC had been using a fleet of steam fly boats (including [[President (narrowboat)|''President'']]) since 1889, but in 1912 introduced motor boats such as ''Peacock'' into their fleet. 'Fly' boats work day and night non-stop, and with an all-male crew the cabins were more spartan than those of long distance family crewed boats.

''Peacock'' worked with FMC's northern fleet until nationalisation in 1948. She was then sold and used as a [[tugboat|tug]] and a [[houseboat]] between 1952 and 1993 when she was bought by the [[Birmingham Museum of Science and Industry]], part of the [[Birmingham Museums Trust]]. ''Peacock'' has been described as being in the most original condition of any of the FMC boats: never converted or altered, she still has most of the original fittings. The current engine dates from the 1920s and is a 15&amp;nbsp;hp Bolinder.

''Peacock'' is on loan to the [[Black Country Living Museum]], where she can be seen dockside at the [[Black Country Living Museum boat dock]], in the [[Dudley Canal|Lord Ward’s Canal Arm]] at [[Dudley]].

''Peacock'' is registered by [[National Historic Ships]] as part of the [[National Historic Fleet]].

[[File:Queer Review - 05 - 2011-05-20 - Queers Against Israeli Apartheid (QuAIA).vorb.oga|thumb|right|Discussion on Queers Against Israeli Apartheid with Tony Souza on Queer Review.]]

'''Queers Against Israeli Apartheid''' ('''QuAIA''') was a [[Toronto]]-based grassroots [[LGBT]] group involved in the movement against what the organization see as [[Israeli apartheid]] and is a member of the Coalition Against Israeli Apartheid.  The group has been involved in [[Israeli Apartheid Week]] as well as [[Pride Week (Toronto)|Toronto Pride Week]].  QuAIA formed shortly after the 2008 iteration of Israeli Apartheid Week at which queer activists had a discussion about "[[pinkwashing (LGBT)|pinkwashing]]", or the use of gay rights as a propaganda tool to justify Israel’s policy toward [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].&lt;ref name=who&gt;http://queersagainstapartheid.org/who QuAIA website: Who We Are&lt;/ref&gt;  The group went on to form contingents for the 2008-2010 and 2012 Pride parades, as well as holding forums, discussion panels and cultural events in Toronto.&lt;ref name=who /&gt;

The group announced in February 2015 that it was disbanding after seven years of activity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2015/02/26/queers-against-israeli-apartheid-disbands.html "Queers Against Israeli Apartheid disbands"]. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', February 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pride 2010: Banning from parade and fallout ==

In 2010, the group was initially banned from marching in the Pride Toronto Parade,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/813053--pride-prohibits-phrase-israeli-apartheid "Pride prohibits phrase ‘Israeli apartheid’"]. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', May 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; despite receiving statements of support from queer organizations within and outside Canada, including the three major Palestinian queer rights organizations.&lt;ref&gt;http://queersagainstapartheid.org/2010/04/26/citys-threat-to-pride-toronto-condemned-internationally City’s Threat to Pride Toronto Condemned Internationally&lt;/ref&gt;
However, following a backlash from the local queer community,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/819813--backlash-grows-against-pride-s-israeli-apartheid-ban "Backlash grows against Pride’s ‘Israeli apartheid’ ban"]. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', June 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
Pride Toronto reversed their decision to ban the words "Israeli Apartheid" as of June 23, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xtra.ca/blog/national/post/2010/06/23/Pride-Toronto-reverses-ban-on-Israeli-apartheid.aspx "Pride Toronto Reverses ban on 'Israeli Apartheid'"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626105545/http://www.xtra.ca/blog/national/post/2010/06/23/Pride-Toronto-reverses-ban-on-Israeli-apartheid.aspx |date=June 26, 2010 }}.''[[Xtra!|Xtra]]'', June 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yakov M. Rabkin]], professor of history at the [[Université de Montréal]], spoke out in favor of QuAIA's message and their right to march in the parade in the pages of the National Post, saying,

{{blockquote|One may sympathize with Israel fans in this country who find it hard to present the state of Israel in an attractive light. By campaigning to ban the QUAIA, they only confirm what many have long suspected: that Israel is indeed an apartheid state...
Wise men of South Africa extricated their country from a violent conundrum. This should show Israel and its supporters a way to lasting peace. A prohibition of the QUAIA will be remembered as a ridiculous and irrelevant act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://network.nationalpost.com/NP/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2010/05/07/counterpoint-yakov-rabkin-on-pride-parade.aspx "Counterpoint: Yakov Rabkin on Pride parade"]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. ''[[National Post]]'', May 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Gil Troy]], professor of History at [[McGill University]], has criticized Queers against Israeli Apartheid:

{{blockquote|Perverse groups such as Queers against Israeli Apartheid pop up which, considering how free democratic Israel is and how unfree much of the Arab world is, makes as much sense as Doctors against Anti-Smoking Campaigns or Liberals for [[Islamism]]. Israel's harsh critics fail to see that if they were less relentless and more credible they could have more impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgis.jpost.com/Blogs/troy/entry/how_intellectuals_enable_islamism_posted |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801203217/http://cgis.jpost.com/Blogs/troy/entry/how_intellectuals_enable_islamism_posted |archivedate=August 1, 2010 }} Center Field: How intellectuals enable Islamism&lt;/ref&gt;}}

QuAIA marched in the parade on July 4, 2010, along with their allies in the Pride Coalition for Free Speech, largely without incident.

== Pride 2011: City Manager's report and decision to pull out of parade ==

=== City Manager's report ===

On April 13, 2011 the non-partisan Toronto City Manager, [[Joe Pennachetti]], released a report for the City Council Executive Committee concluding that "the participation of QUAIA in the Pride Parade based solely on the phrase 'Israeli Apartheid' does not violate the City’s Anti-Discrimination Policy. The City also cannot therefore conclude that the use of term on signs or banners to identify QuAIA constitutes the promotion of hatred or seeks to incite discrimination contrary to the Code."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2011/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-37384.pdf Report from the City Manager: Compliance with the City of Toronto's Anti-Discrimination Policy - Pride Toronto]. City of Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking to the Toronto Star, QuAIA spokesperson Tim McCaskell stated that the city manager and staff had “obviously done their homework, and talked to lawyers, and not made this a political decision but one that’s based on a reasonable look at the facts of the matter and of Canadian law... It basically vindicates everything we’ve been saying for the last two years.”  Toronto mayor [[Rob Ford]] indicated that he plans to defund the parade regardless of the City Manager report.&lt;ref name=TorontoStar2011-04-13/&gt;&lt;ref name=HardApartheid/&gt;

=== Pride funding battle ===

Two days later on April 15, 2011, citing the City Manager's report QuAIA announced that it will not march in the 2011 Toronto Pride Parade for the stated purpose of "pos[ing] a challenge for Mayor Rob Ford."  QuAIA spokesperson Elle Flanders elaborated by stating "Rob Ford wants to use us as an excuse to cut Pride funding, even though he has always opposed funding the parade, long before we showed up.  By holding our Pride events outside of the parade, we are forcing him to make a choice: fund Pride or have your real homophobic, right-wing agenda exposed."  QuAIA's press release further stated that the organization would instead host a community event in support of the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;http://queersagainstapartheid.org/2011/04/15/quaia-to-mayor-find-another-pretext-for-your-anti-pride-agenda "QuAIA to Mayor: Find another pretext for your anti-Pride agenda"&lt;/ref&gt;

The announcement was generally considered a surprise, even by media that had been following the story closely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/04/15/quaia-pulls-out-of-pride-parade-challenges-mayor-ford "QuAIA pulls out of Pride Parade, challenges Mayor Ford"]. ''[[National Post]]'', April 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Toronto Star, "QuAIA’s decision [not to march] represents a significant tactical shift for the group, which fought intensely last year for the right to participate in Pride." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/article/975242--queers-against-israeli-apartheid-pulls-out-of-pride-parade "Councillor demands Pride promise to ban Queers Against Israeli Apartheid"]. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', April 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a May 24, 2011 meeting of the executive committee, City Hall voted unanimously to accept the city manager's report, which made it likely that Pride Toronto would receive funding &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torontosun.com/2011/05/24/pride-toronto-clears-city-hurdle "Pride Toronto clears city hurdle"]. ''[[Toronto Sun]]'', May 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Deputations were given on the issue by over 50 speakers, which included QuAIA itself that had made a short video specifically for the purpose. The video can be seen here.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/24222860 "QuAIA Deputation - Pride 2011"], May 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternative plans to parade ===

In mid June it was revealed that the community event QuAIA planned to host would feature prominent writer and anti-AIDS activist [[Sarah Schulman]] speaking in favor of the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) campaign from an LGBT perspective.  
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xtra.ca/public/National/Meet_writer_and_activist_Sarah_Schulman-10282.aspx "Meet writer and activist Sarah Schulman: How an expert on homophobia became a QuAIA supporter"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612203808/http://www.xtra.ca/public/National/Meet_writer_and_activist_Sarah_Schulman-10282.aspx |date=June 12, 2011 }}.''[[Xtra!|Xtra]]'', June 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
The event was held June 22, 2011 at Toronto's historic [[Gladstone Hotel (Toronto)|Gladstone Hotel]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://queersagainstapartheid.org/2011/06/15/queers-against-israeli-apartheid-quaia-presents-an-evening-of-political-dialogue-performance-and-dancing "Queers Against Israeli Apartheid (QuAIA) Presents: an evening of political dialogue, performance and dancing"], June 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The following evening, June 23, a second event was held that featured Sarah Schulman speaking on her history of fighting homophobia and AIDS activism in the [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power|ACT UP!]] organization in [[New York City]].  The second event was cosponsored with numerous queer and AIDS activist organizations.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://queersagainstapartheid.org/2011/06/15/learning-tactics-and-strategies-with-act-up "LEARNING TACTICS AND STRATEGIES WITH ACT UP!"], June 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

During her visit, Schulman was also interviewed by local queer media [[Xtra!]], primarily focusing on how she came to support the BDS campaign as a queer activist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZWfPeQbUok "Sarah Schulman on QuAIA and Activism"], YouTube, June 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In lieu of participation in the actual Parade, QuAIA dropped a 40-foot banner from above Toronto's [[Wellesley (TTC)|Wellesley subway station]] promoting a campaign to boycott LGBT leisure tourism to Israel.  The banner drop occurred on July 3, the day of the 2011 Pride Parade, in the heart of Toronto's historic [[Church and Wellesley|LGBT district]].  The banner read "Support Palestinian Queers, Boycott Israeli Tourism."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xtra.ca/public/Toronto/QuAIA_drops_banner_from_Wellesley_subway_station-10428.aspx "QuAIA drops banner from Wellesley subway station: Queers Against Israeli Apartheid makes statement on parade day"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706070454/http://www.xtra.ca/public/Toronto/QuAIA_drops_banner_from_Wellesley_subway_station-10428.aspx |date=July 6, 2011 }}.''[[Xtra!|Xtra]]'', July 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pride 2012: Return to pride parade ==

In June 2012, the Toronto city council voted to condemn the phrase "Israeli apartheid," as part of a resolution recognizing the [[gay]] Pride Toronto parade as a “significant cultural event that strongly promotes the ideals of tolerance and diversity.” The resolution said it slams the term Israel Apartheid for undermining the values of Pride and diminishing “the suffering experienced by individuals during the apartheid regime in South Africa.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torontosun.com/2012/06/07/council-votes-to-condemn-use-of-term-israeli-apartheid  Council votes to condemn use of term 'Israeli apartheid']&lt;/ref&gt;

Pride Toronto's Dispute Resolution Committee, composed of lawyers with experience in arbitration and mediation in human rights matters, rejected a complaint against QuAIA by [[B'nai Brith Canada]] that sought to ban the group from the parade. The panel dismissed the complaint, stating that “the activities of QUAIA are not contrary to the core missions or policies of Pride Toronto,” and that it is “not likely to present images or messages that promote, condone or may promote or condone violence, hatred, degradation or negative stereotypes of a person or group, contrary to the City of Toronto’s Anti-Discrimination Policy.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kauri|first=Vidya|title=Queers Against Israeli Apartheid allowed to march in Pride parade|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/06/30/queers-against-israeli-apartheid-allowed-to-march-in-pride-parade/|accessdate=July 7, 2012|newspaper=National Post|date=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pride 2013: City staff reports and further Pride funding debates ==

=== City staff reports ===

In response to a September 10, 2012 request from Toronto city council's executive committee, city staff released a series of three reports on April 9, 2013, regarding the city's anti-discrimination policy and grants policy 
.&lt;ref&gt;[http://app.toronto.ca/tmmis/viewAgendaItemHistory.do?item=2013.EX31.2 Agenda Item History - 2013.EX31.2: Amendments to City of Toronto Anti-Discrimination Policies]. City of Toronto&lt;/ref&gt;  These staff reports built on and largely reiterated the 2011 report from the city manager.  Regarding the city's grants policy, one of these reports stated:

{{blockquote|On June 14, 2011, City Council considered City staff's conclusions that neither QuAIA's participation itself, nor its signs or banners, violated the City's anti-discrimination policies and do not appear to violate the Ontario Human Rights Code. For that reason, Council was advised that there were no grounds to withdraw City funding for Pride in order to prevent or restrict QuAIA's participation based on the anti-discrimination policy. Nor was there a policy rationale to justify the imposition of the condition that the term "Israeli Apartheid" not be permitted at a City-funded event on City property. This conclusion and advice remains appropriate in the view of staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2013/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-57439.pdf "Report on Amendments to the City of Toronto Grants Policy"]. ''Toronto City Staff Report'', April 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

QuAIA's Tim McCaskell was quoted in response saying, "The law is clear to everyone except a handful of right-wing councillors: you can’t ban the phrase ‘Israeli apartheid.'"  Meanwhile, Councillor [[James Pasternak]] was quoted, "Stopping QuAIA is like trying to hammer jelly against the wall."  
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/04/22/mayor_rob_fords_executive_will_consider_israeli_apartheid_group_again.html Mayor Rob Ford’s executive will consider ‘Israeli Apartheid’ group again]. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', April 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also pointed out in the media that no such funding restrictions had been attempted against the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] or [[Toronto International Film Festival]], which had also held events at which the phrase "Israeli Apartheid" was supposedly employed.  Finally, the third report in the series from city staff was not publicly released, but dealt with "litigation or potential litigation affecting the City of Toronto," according to its author Chris Brillinger, executive director of social development, finance and administration for the city.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xtra.ca/public/Toronto/Israeli_apartheid_decision_heads_back_to_citys_executive_committee-13449.aspx "'Israeli apartheid' decision heads back to city's executive committee"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425081254/http://www.xtra.ca/public/Toronto/Israeli_apartheid_decision_heads_back_to_citys_executive_committee-13449.aspx |date=April 25, 2013 }}.''[[Xtra!|Xtra]]'', April 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Executive committee deputations and motion to defer ===

At an April 23, 2013 meeting, the city's executive committee heard deputations from 27 individuals, most of whom reportedly spoke in favor of recommendations from city staff.  This included one Holocaust Survivor, Suzanne Weiss, who stated, "A sweeping ban on disrespectful speech will threaten every citizen’s rights."  Meanwhile, national director of legal affairs for B’nai Brith Canada, Anita Bromberg, argued instead that the parade is not a political demonstration, saying, "This is a city-wide celebration. I am deeply offended."

QuAIA member Elle Flanders spoke on her experience living in [[Ramallah]] for a year, saying, "My partner and I traveled every day for six months on a segregated road system; they are known as the apartheid roads because they are segregated by your ethnic identity. Roads for Jewish Israelis, roads for Palestinians."   &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/137606733/Elle-Flanders-deputation-on-QuAIA "Executive Committee deputation re: QuAIA"]. ''[[Elle Flanders]]'', April 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

CEO and director of Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) also commented on the issue; discussing the usage of the phrase 'Israeli Apartheid' at TIFF, he said

{{blockquote|As long as something is not hate speech, that’s all we are concerned about, and there are already laws around that. . . The festival is about open dialogue, open conversation and providing new avenues to understand extremely complicated situations, and we are fully in favour of that. . . We obviously want to talk to Councillor Shiner and some of the other city councillors about what the intent of their motion would be, and hopefully it will not pass. I hope good sense will prevail."}}

However, following a motion from Councillor [[David Shiner (politician)|David Shiner]], the committee voted to defer recommendations from city staff until a May 28 meeting, after which the item could proceed to full council in June.  In response, Councillor [[Kristyn Wong-Tam]] was quoted as saying, "Perhaps what [Councillor James Pasternak and Shiner] are trying to do is mobilize and organize the opposing side... We have Councillor Pasternak, who is actively trying to defund Pride, who is actively lobbying councillors to swing his way. So this could be the political strategy he needs to defund Pride."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xtra.ca/public/Toronto/Move_to_defund_Pride_Toronto_deferred_to_May_28-13461.aspx "Move to defund Pride Toronto deferred to May 28"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427205156/http://www.xtra.ca/public/Toronto/Move_to_defund_Pride_Toronto_deferred_to_May_28-13461.aspx |date=April 27, 2013 }}.''[[Xtra!|Xtra]]'', April 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the deferred motion, Councilor Pasternak suggested that instead of facing the possibility of being defunded, Pride should be offered the possibility of additional funding if it chooses to ban QuAIA from participation in the Pride festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/04/24/to0425-alco-pride/ "Pride should get bonus money if it rejects Queers Against Israeli Apartheid: Toronto councillor"]. ''[[National Post]]'', April 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Acknowledging there was reluctance on the part of city council to defund Pride, Pasternak stated, "What you do is allow Pride to keep their existing grant and provide a diversity bonus after the parade should QuAIA not participate. So we are changing the conversation to a diversity bonus."  Pride co-chair Francisco Alvarez responded by calling the offer, "desperate and insincere." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xtra.ca/public/Toronto/Pasternak_offers_Pride_diversity_bonus_if_it_excludes_QuAIA-13475.aspx "Pasternak offers Pride 'diversity bonus' if it excludes QuAIA"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427205049/http://www.xtra.ca/public/Toronto/Pasternak_offers_Pride_diversity_bonus_if_it_excludes_QuAIA-13475.aspx |date=April 27, 2013 }}.''[[Xtra!|Xtra]]'', April 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns and activism==

===LGBT tourism boycott===

In September 2009, a statement was released on the QuAIA website calling for a boycott of [[LGBT tourism|LGBT leisure tourism]] to Israel. 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://queersagainstapartheid.org/2009/09/09/apartheid-israel-is-no-place-for-lgbt-leisure-tourism Apartheid Israel is no place for LGBT leisure tourism] QuAIA website, Sept. 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  This campaign was prominently promoted in a [[banner drop]] at the 2011 Pride Parade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://queersagainstapartheid.org/2011/07/03/queers-against-israeli-apartheid-drops-a-massive-banner-during-toronto-pride Queers Against Israeli Apartheid drops a massive banner during Toronto Pride] QuAIA website, July 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom Flotilla===

Filmmaker and QuAIA member [[John Greyson]] has been listed as one of the participants in the 2011 [[Freedom Flotilla II]].  Greyson is reported to be a passenger aboard the Canadian boat "Tahrir."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tahrir.ca/fr/content/john-greyson John Greyson] Blogs from Tahrir, Canadian boat to Gaza website, June 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Greyson's participation in the Flotilla came to the public spotlight in the aftermath of a hoax video in which an Israeli actor claimed that gays weren't welcome to participate in the flotilla.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/gaza-flotilla-activists-queers-welcome-aboard-aid-ships-1.370467 Gaza flotilla activists: Queers welcome aboard aid ships], Ha'aretz, June 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural events==

At the 2011 [[Inside Out Film and Video Festival|Inside Out]] LGBT film festival QuAIA jointly sponsored a program consisting of film shorts produced by artists in Lebanon, Palestine and their diasporas.  The program was titled "With Love from Le(z)Banon and Pa(lez)tine" and was followed by a talk by Professor Samar Habib on queer representation in Egyptian cinema.  QuAIA co-sponsored the program with Queer Ontario.  
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insideout.ca/21/program_details.php?id=741 "Program Details: With Love from Le(z)Banon and Pa(lez)tine"], Inside Out Film Festival, Presented in Toronto, May 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Local Toronto alternative media company Deviant Productions conducted an interview with Professor Habib after the event, in which she further discussed queer representation in Arab cinema.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcYHjUODIkc "Interview With Samar Habib - With Love From Le(z)banon and Pale(z)tine"], YouTube, June 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, QuAIA partnered with the Toronto Palestine Film Festival to present lesbian filmmaker [[Barbara Hammer]]'s ''Witness: Palestine'', which Hammer had created in response to her experiences on the first LGBTQ Solidarity Tour of Palestine in 2012.  The film was presented at Toronto's [[Images Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://imagesfestival.com/calendar.php?event_id=938&amp;month=n "Witness : Palestine - Barbara Hammer"], Images Festival, Presented in Toronto, April 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, the '''Skolem problem''' is the problem of determining whether the values of a [[constant-recursive sequence]] include the number zero. The problem can be formulated for recurrences over different types of numbers, including [[integer]]s, [[rational number]]s, and [[algebraic number]]s. It is not known whether there exists an [[algorithm]] that can solve this problem.&lt;ref name="ow"&gt;{{citation

A linear recurrence relation expresses the values of a sequence of numbers as a linear combination of earlier values; for instance, the [[Fibonacci number]]s may be defined from the recurrence relation
:{{math|1=''F''(''n'') = ''F''(''n'' &amp;minus; 1) + ''F''(''n'' &amp;minus; 2)}}
together with the initial values {{math|1=''F''(0) = 0}} and {{math|1=''F''(1) = 1}}.
The Skolem problem is named after [[Thoralf Skolem]], because of his 1933 paper proving the [[Skolem–Mahler–Lech theorem]] on the zeros of a sequence satisfying a linear recurrence with constant coefficients.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Skolem|first=Th.|title=Einige Sätze über gewisse Reihenentwicklungen und exponentiale Beziehungen mit Anwendung auf diophantische Gleichungen|journal=Oslo Vid. akad. Skrifter|volume=I|number=6|year=1933}}. {{harvtxt|Ouaknine|Worrell|2012}} instead cite a 1934 paper of Skolem for this result.&lt;/ref&gt; This theorem states that, if such a sequence has zeros, then with finitely many exceptions the positions of the zeros repeat regularly. Skolem proved this for recurrences over the [[rational number]]s, and Mahler and Lech extended it to other systems of numbers. However, the proofs of the theorem do not show how to test whether there exist any zeros.

There does exist an algorithm to test whether a constant-recursive sequence has infinitely many zeros, and if so to construct a decomposition of the positions of those zeros into periodic subsequences, based on the algebraic properties of the roots of the characteristic polynomial of the given recurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Partial solutions to the Skolem problem are known, covering the special case of the problem for recurrences of degree at most four. However, these solutions do not apply to recurrences of degree five or more.&lt;ref name="ow"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

[[Image:Tacuinum sanitatis-garlic.jpg|thumb|Harvesting [[garlic]], from ''Tacuinum Sanitatis'', ca. 1400 ([[Bibliothèque nationale]], Paris)]]

The '''''Tacuinum''''' (sometimes '''''Taccuinum''''') '''''Sanitatis'''''&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Andrew ; Henley, Daniel; Henley, David (2013). 'Tacuinum Sanitatis' in: ''Health and Well Being: A Medieval Guide''. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. ASIN:B00DQ5BKFA&lt;/ref&gt; is a medieval handbook mainly on [[health]], based on the ''Taqwīm as‑siḥḥah'' {{lang|ar|تقويم الصحة}} ("Maintenance of Health"), an eleventh-century Arab medical treatise by [[Ibn Butlan]] of [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Wickersheimer, "Les ''Tacuini Sanitatis'' et leur traduction allemande par Michel Herr", ''Bibliothèque d'Humanisme et Renaissance'' '''12''' 1950:85-97.&lt;/ref&gt; Aimed at a cultured lay audience, the text exists in several variant Latin versions, the manuscripts of which are characteristically so profusely illustrated that one student called the ''Tacuinum'' "a [300] picture book", only "nominally a medical text".&lt;ref&gt;Brucia Witthoft, ''The Tacuinum Sanitatis: A Lombard Panorama'' ''Gesta'' '''17'''.1 (1978:49-60) p 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though describing in detail the beneficial and harmful properties of foods and plants, it is far more than a [[herbal]]. Listing its contents organically rather than alphabetically, it sets forth the six essential elements for well-being:

*sufficient food and drink in moderation,
*fresh air,
*alternations of activity and rest,
*alternations of sleep and wakefulness,
*secretions and excretions of [[humours]], and finally
*the effects of states of mind.
 
''Tacuinum Sanitatis'' says that illnesses result from imbalance of these elements.
[[Image:1-albero, Taccuino Sanitatis, Casanatense 4182..jpg|thumb|left|''Tacuinum Sanitatis'', Lombardy, late 14th century ([[Biblioteca Casanatense]], Rome).]]

The terse paragraphs of the treatise were freely translated into Latin in mid-thirteenth-century [[Palermo]] or Naples,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which continued an [[Italo-Norman]] tradition as one of the prime sites for peaceable inter-cultural contact between the Islamic and European worlds. "Magister Faragius" (Ferraguth) in Naples took responsibility for one translation into Latin, in a manuscript in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]], Paris, MS Lat. 15362 (noted by Witthoft 1978:58 note 9).

Four handsomely illustrated complete late fourteenth-century manuscripts of the ''Tacuinum'', all produced in [[Lombardy]], survive, in Vienna, Paris, Liège and Rome, as well as scattered illustrations from others, as well as fifteenth-century [[codex|codices]].&lt;ref&gt;Witthoft 1978 discusses the ''Tacuina'' in the national libraries of Paris and Vienna, and the Biblioteca Casanatense, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; Carmelia Opsomer published a commented facsimile of the ms 1041 held in the library of the university of Liège.&lt;ref&gt;''L’Art de vivre en santé. Images et recettes du Moyen Âge. Le « Tacuinum sanitatis » (ms 1041) de la Bibliothèque universitaire de Liège'', éd. de C. Opsomer, Liège, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Unillustrated manuscripts present a series of tables, with a narrative commentary on the facing pages. The ''Tacuinum'' was first printed in 1531.

The ''Tacuinum'' was very popular in Western Europe in the [[Late Middle Ages]]; an indication of that popularity is the use of the word ''taccuino'' in modern Italian to mean "notebook".

In addition to its importance for the study of [[medieval medicine]], the ''Tacuinum'' is also of interest in the study of agriculture and cooking; for example, one of the earliest identifiable images of the [[carrot]]&amp;mdash;a modern plant&amp;mdash;is found in it. Carrot also appears in The Greek Herbal of [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides]]: Illustrated by a Byzantine A.D. 512

In 2008, the Spanish publishing house [[M. Moleiro Editor]] published the first and only facsimile of the ''Tacuinum Sanitatis'' kept at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], in an edition limited to 987 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Albino Mallo, "Moleiro clona códices de los siglos XI y XII con el arte de la perfección", ''Xornal'', January 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This edition was accompanied by a commentary volume by Alain Touwaide ([[Smithsonian]]), Eberhard König ([[Freie Universität Berlin]]) and Carlos Miranda García-Tejedor (Doctor in History).

==Digitization process==
The digitization of the archive is done by audio engineer George Blood and his team, at a rate of 5,000 to 6,000 sides per month,&lt;ref name="WP" /&gt; or 100 sides (50 singles) per engineer per day.&lt;ref name="PI"&gt;{{cite web|last1=DeLuca|first1=Dan|title='The Great 78 Project' is giving history digital life, in Chestnut Hill|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/music/great-78-project-vinyl-archive-chestnut-hill-20170915.html|website=The Philadelphia Inquirer|accessdate=November 2, 2017|date=September 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood had previously been responsible for the digitization of 10,000 singles for the National Jukebox, a similar project organized by the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name="PI" /&gt; Each song is recorded in 16 different versions (using four different styluses, recording both sides of the groove wall, and with/out [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]]), the best of which is highlighted by the engineer to aid the listener.&lt;ref name="PI" /&gt;

==Collections==
The bulk of the project's singles are sourced from private collections, some which had previously been donated to libraries or even abandoned. These include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Great 78 Project - Collections|url=https://great78.archive.org/about/|website=The Great 78 Project|publisher=[[Internet Archive]]|accessdate=November 2, 2017|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Joe Terino Collection, a collection of 70,000 78 rpm singles stored in a warehouse for 40 years.
*The Barrie H. Thorpe Collection, which had been deposited at the [[Batavia,_Illinois#Library|Batavia Public Library]] in Batavia, Illinois, in 2007 by Barrie H. Thorpe (1925–2012). It contains 48,000 singles.
*The Daniel McNeil Collection, with 22,359 singles.
*The Charles Stratton Collection, containing over 8,000 singles, previously donated to [[Kansas State University]] by Charles William Stratton's (1906-1966) estate in 1968.
*The David Chomowicz and Esther Ready Collection, with 4,000 LPs and singles, focused on Latin American and Caribbean music.
*The Daniel Jan Walikis Polka Collection, with 2,000 LPs and singles devoted to [[polka]] and Eastern European music.
*The Richard Thayer Skidmore Collection, which includes 1,400 78s and over a hundred LPs of [[jazz]] music.
*The [[KUSF (University of San Francisco)|KUSF]] Collection, donated by the University of San Francisco’s online radio station, including all of its 78 rpm singles.
*The Jules Vandersarl Collection, with 1,675 singles.

In addition, the project has received 78s donated to the ARChive of Contemporary Music, which however focuses on more recent music. The ARChive contains over 5 million items, but only a small fraction of these are 78 rpms.

'''The Library Corporation (TLC)''' creates and distributes automation and cataloging software to [[Public library|public]], [[School library|school]], [[Academic library|academic]], and [[Special library|special]] library systems worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Breeding. "Automation Marketplace 2011." Library Journal, [http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/home/889533-264/automation_marketplace_2011_the_new.html.csp], April 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Inwood, West Virginia|Inwood, W.Va.]], with additional offices in [[Denver]], [[Singapore]], and [[Ontario]], the company is owned and operated by the same family that established it in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;American Libraries, [http://americanlibrariesbuyersguide.com/productshowcase.php?ps_id=2287], Nov. 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, it became the first organization in the world to successfully use [[CD-ROM]] technology for [[data storage device|data storage]] when it released its BiblioFile Cataloging software. The CD-ROM drive used to read those first commercially produced discs, as well as the original BiblioFile Cataloging CD-ROMs, are now in the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;TLC History, [http://www.tlcdelivers.com/tlc/who-we-are/company-history.asp], Jan. 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

TLC, a [[General Services Administration|GSA]]-certified company, earned a 2009 Best in Tech Award from Scholastic Administrator magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Scholastic Administrator, [http://www2.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=3751738], March/April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2009, its senior product developer, Matt Moran, was selected by [[Library Journal]] magazine as one of the library industry's top 51 "Movers and Shakers."&lt;ref&gt;Library Journal, [http://www.libraryjournal.com/csp/cms/sites/LJ/LJInPrint/MoversAndShakers/profiles2009/moversandshakersmoran.csp], March 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Library Automation Systems ==

The company offers three [[integrated library system]]s: Library•'''Solution''' for public, academic, and special libraries; Library•'''Solution''' ''for Schools'' for public and private school libraries; and CARL•'''X''', the next-generation version of the [[Legacy system|legacy]] CARL•'''Solution''' automation system.

Each system automates the standard operations of a library, including the [[Library circulation|check-in/check-out process]], [[Library catalog|cataloging]], [[Inventory (library)|inventory]], [[authority control]], reports, and management of floating collections.  Facilities that utilize a TLC ILS include [[Los Angeles Public Library]] in California, [[Dallas Independent School District]] in Texas, [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] in Singapore, [[Anchorage School District]] in Alaska, [[Chicago Public Schools]] in Illinois, and National Society of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] Library in Washington, D.C.

== Online Public Access Catalog Products ==

TLC adds [[Web application|Web-based]], [[touchscreen]]-optimized functionality to its ILS products with a series of software patches referred to as the LS2 suite of [[Online public access catalog|OPAC]]s: LS2 PAC, LS2 Kids, and LS2 Staff.
:* LS2 PAC works with all three of TLC's automation systems to give patrons online access to [[library catalog]]s, including downloadable [[e-book]]s, [[audiobook]]s, and other digital resources. It includes a customizable display of library titles, [[RSS]] news and information feeds, [[Google Analytics]]™ integration, [[federated search]]ing of in-house and online content, integrated searching of subscription databases, list creation and sharing capabilities, and patron ratings, reviews, and search tags.&lt;ref&gt;Library Journal, [http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6639337.html?nid=3302], March 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
:* LS2 Kids is the children's version of LS2 PAC, designed to enable young readers to independently explore a library's online catalog. It includes quick links to popular book series, [[User interface|interactive]] title displays with enlarged book jackets, a search box that provides spelling suggestions and corrections, and a category wheel with [[Computer icon|icons]] that link to appropriate titles.&lt;ref&gt;School Library Journal, [http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6703703.html?industryid=47061&amp;], Nov. 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
:* LS2 Staff allows libraries to perform basic [[Library circulation|circulation]] functions from any computer with Internet access.

== Library Automation Enhancements ==

The company also created [[Computer process|standalone]] [[Library catalog|cataloging]] and [[Library acquisitions|acquisitions]] products that work with any ILS. 
* eBiblioFile is a cataloging service that offers complete [[MARC standards|MARC records]] for [[e-book]]s and other [[Digital distribution|digital materials]].
* RDAExpress is a catalog conversion service for eBiblioFile users that upgrades a library's [[MARC standards|MARC records]] to the new [[Resource Description and Access]] (RDA) standard.
* BiblioFile is a cataloging program from the 1970s that accesses and processes [[MARC standards|MARC records]] for printed library materials from online databases.
* ITS•'''MARC''' offers [[Z39.50]] and Internet access to [[MARC standards|MARC records]].  The [[metadata]] is processed by cataloging programs like BiblioFile.
Additionally, TLC is the exclusive distributor of [[SocialFlow]] to the library marketplace. SocialFlow is a [[social media optimization]] tool that uses [[algorithm]]s and key [[Metrics (networking)|metrics]] to determine the best time to publish content for the widest possible audience.

The Touring Club Ciclistico Italiano (TCCI) was founded on November 8, 1894 by a group of [[bicycle|bicyclists]] to promote the values of cycling and travel; its founding president was {{illm|Luigi Vittorio Bertarelli|it}}.  It published its first maps in 1897.  By 1899, it had 16,000 members. With the new century, it promoted tourism in all its forms – including auto tourism – and the appreciation of the natural and urban environments.  Under [[Fascism]], starting in 1937, it was forced to [[Linguistic purism|Italianize]] its name to the '''Consociazione Turistica Italiana'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Through the years, it has produced a wide variety of maps, guidebooks, and more specialized studies, and is known for its high standard of [[cartography]].  Its detailed road maps of Italy are published at 1:200,000, one per [[Regions of Italy|region]].

Its most prestigious guidebooks are the "Guide Rosse" (not to be confused with the [[Michelin]] [[Red Guide]]s), which cover Italy in 23 highly detailed volumes printed on bible paper; the TCI also produces a wide variety of other guides to Italy. During the Fascist period, the red guides were also extended to cover Italian colonies and overseas territories.

The TCI also publishes translations of foreign guidebooks such as the French [[Guide Bleu]].

Janis rented a house to Orlando, who Janis should have known would use the house for his illegal gambling ring.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;{{rp|762}} 
Janis was prosecuted as an accomplice to the illegal gambling.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;{{rp|762}} The trial court gave the ostrich defense that "you may infer knowledge from a combination of suspicion and indifference to the truth".&lt;ref&gt;''Giovanetti'', 919 F.2d at 1226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge [[Richard Posner]] wrote the court's opinion, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The most powerful criticism of the ostrich instruction is, precisely, that its tendency is to allow juries to convict upon a finding of negligence [in knowing] for crimes that require intent... The ostrich instruction is designed for cases in which there is evidence that the defendant, knowing or strongly suspecting that he is involved in shady dealings, takes steps to make sure that he does not acquire full or exact knowledge of the nature and extent of those dealings. A deliberate effort to avoid guilty knowledge is all the guilty knowledge the law requires.&lt;ref&gt;''Giovanetti'', 919 F.2d at 1228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Yearbook on International Communist Affairs''''' is a series of 25 books published annually between 1966 and 1991, which chronicle the activities of [[Communist party|communist parties]] throughout the world.&lt;ref name ="Pacific Affairs 1968"/&gt; It was published by the [[Hoover Institution]] Press, [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name ="APSR 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Soviet Studies 1979"/&gt; [[Richard Felix Staar|Richard F. Staar]] served as its editor in chief for most of its editions.&lt;ref name="Hoover Staar"/&gt;

The Yearbook was widely regarded as an objective, comprehensive, very detailed, and reliable reference work, with high quality editorial work. Reviewers noted that no other similar vast compilation of worldwide Communist activities had existed prior to the creation of this book series, and becoming "the most authoritative word on the subject".&lt;ref name="Washington Post 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Studies in Soviet Thought 1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="The Slavonic and East European Review 1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Foreign Affairs 1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Il Politico 1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Canadian Slavonic Papers 1972"/&gt;

Glenn Campbell, Director of [[Hoover Institution|The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace]], stated the following reasons for creating such a volume: &lt;blockquote&gt;the international communist movement has had a profound impact inupon the modern world. In the half-century since the Bolshevik Revolution the movement has expanded steadily. Communist parties now rule in fourteen countries and are active in some 75 others. At the same time, the movement has become more complex and fragmented, particularly as divergent tendencies have arisen in the past dozen years. For these reasons, the Hoover Institution decided to begin publication of a ''Yearbook on International Communist Affairs'', a project designed to provide an annual compendium and reference work for scholars, teachers, students, policymakers, journalists, and others.&lt;ref name ="YICA 1966"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1971 the ''Il Politico'' journal noted that the publication of that year's volume had been possible with the financial support from the [[Mary Reynolds Babcock]] Foundation, the Carthage Foundation, the [[Earhart Foundation]], and the Esso Education Foundation.&lt;ref name ="Il Politico 1971"/&gt;

====Companion retrospective publication====

The first edition of the yearbook appeared in conjunction with another publication by the Hoover Institution: ''World Communism: A Handbook 1918–1965'', which surveyed the historical and structural developments of all communist parties, from their foundation until the end of 1965. The Yearbook then took over to offer documentation for 1966 (and onwards).&lt;ref name ="YICA 1966"/&gt;

===Editors and contributors===
With some variations, each book had a chief editor, an assistant editor (aided by a "small full-time team" working at the Hoover Institution), an [[editorial board]] or area editors (depending on which edition, at times also called "foreign correspondents"), and an [[advisory board]] ("of distinguished scholars in the field of communism and international affairs from both the United States and Western Europe").&lt;ref name ="YICA 1966"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Il Politico 1971"/&gt; There was also a large number of expert contributors in covering each of the countries in the Yearbook; these were initially uncredited, but identified in later editions.&lt;ref name ="YICA 1966"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="YICA 1979"/&gt;

The lead editors at inception of the series for the 1966 year volume were [[Milorad M. Drachkovitch]] and [[Lewis H. Gann]].&lt;ref name ="YICA 1966"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WorldCat"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Canadian Slavonic Papers 1972"/&gt; They were followed by [[Richard V. Allen|Richard Allen]] and Milorad Popov.&lt;ref name ="The Slavonic and East European Review 1971"/&gt; Since 1969 and until the end of the series in 1991, [[Richard Felix Staar|Richard F. Staar]] was its main editor.&lt;ref name="WorldCat"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="The Slavonic and East European Review 1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoover Staar"/&gt;

===Discontinuation===
As the Soviet Union [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–91)|weakened]], leading to its [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution in 1991]], Communism as a major global geopolitical factor also faded. As Gerald Segal writing for the ''[[International Affairs (journal)|International Affairs]]'' put it in 1990, the Yearbook while still a "reliable" and "essential" reference work, with all the changes in the Communist world, including "the breaching of the Berlin Wall and the coming of political pluralism to most of Eastern Europe", it was becoming a repository of "esoteric history"&lt;ref name ="International Affairs 1990"/&gt;

In this context, the Yearbook saw its last edition published covering the year 1991, its 25th anniversary edition. The ''[[Washington Post]]'' noted how the discontinuation of the Yearbook was a sign of the times, by stating: &lt;blockquote&gt;In addition to trying to take an active role in the changes sweeping the Soviet Union, American experts also are seeking new directions for scholarship that long focused exclusively on communism and the Cold War. In a symbolic underscoring of how outmoded those topics suddenly have become, the Hoover Institution has decided that its just published Yearbook of International Communist Affairs will be the last edition of a work long regarded as the most authoritative word on the subject. Still, Richard F. Starr, editor of the Yearbook, thinks it is not yet time to abandon the strategic studies that long were the underpinning of Soviet scholarship. He now is concentrating his research on efforts to reform and restructure the Soviet armed forces.&lt;ref name="Washington Post 1991"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Scope and contents==
The books series was conceived to be a "continuing publication in English on the international political activities of the various communist parties, or on the relations among communists themselves."&lt;ref name ="Foreign Affairs 1968"/&gt;

According to the 1979 edition (and representative of the entire series), the purpose was to provide basic data concerning organizational and personnel changes, attitudes towards domestic and foreign policies, and activities of communist parties and international front organizations through the world. Much of the information came from primary source materials in the native languages. Profiles on each party included founding date, legal or proscribed status, membership, electoral and parliamentary (if any) strength, leadership, auxiliary organizations, domestic activities, ideological orientation, views on international issues, attitude toward the Sino-Soviet dispute, and principal news media.&lt;ref name ="YICA 1979"/&gt;

The criterion for a party to be included in the books was its identity as a Marxist–Leninist party,&lt;ref name ="YICA 1979"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Pacific Affairs 1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Slavic Review 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="The Hispanic American Historical Review 1972"/&gt;  and recognized by authoritative communist publications such as the ''[[Problems of Peace and Socialism|World Marxist Review]]''.&lt;ref name ="YICA 1966"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Pacific Affairs 1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Slavic Review 1970"/&gt;  That is, parties that were pro-Soviet, pro-Chinese, Castroite, Trostkyist, as well as other rival communist movements.&lt;ref name ="YICA 1979"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Pacific Affairs 1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="The Hispanic American Historical Review 1972"/&gt; Every edition in the book series covered around 100 parties.&lt;ref name ="YICA 1979"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="YICA 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="YICA 1966"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Studies in Soviet Thought 1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Soviet Studies 1979"/&gt; International mass organizations under communist leadership were also included.&lt;ref name ="YICA 1966"/&gt;

With some variations over the years, the books included the following sections:&lt;ref name ="Studies in Soviet Thought 1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="YICA 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="YICA 1966"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Pacific Affairs 1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Pacific Affairs 1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Il Politico 1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Canadian Slavonic Papers 1972"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Slavic Review 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="The Slavonic and East European Review 1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Canadian Slavonic Papers 1972"/&gt;
*Introduction/Overview
*Profiles of Individual Communist Parties (by country, constituting the majority of the content of each book)

The Yearbook averaged over 950 pages in its first few editions, and continuing to oscillate between about 500 to over 1000 pages throughout the duration of the series.&lt;ref name ="Canadian Slavonic Papers 1972"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="YICA 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="YICA 1966"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="YICA 1979"/&gt;

==Reception==
===Accolades===
The book series was generally very well regarded by scholars.&lt;ref name ="Pacific Affairs 1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Studies in Soviet Thought 1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Africa Today 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="APSR 1978"/&gt; Talking about the first volume [[Józef Maria Bocheński|J.M. Bocheński]] noted that "the reviewer does not believe that anything comparable in scope, wealth of information and exactness has been produced by any Communist organization. It will certainly be a standard reference by all scholars interested in Communism, Communist and non-Communist alike. It is hoped that similar volumes will be published for subsequent years." further adding "it would be difficult to exaggerate the importance and usefulness of this work"&lt;ref name ="Studies in Soviet Thought 1968"/&gt; Similarly Avakumovic writing for ''[[Pacific Affairs]]'' concurred, calling it a pioneering work.&lt;ref name ="Pacific Affairs 1968"/&gt; 

In subsequent volumes, the series continued to be praised, with multiple [[Peer review|academic reviewers]] describing the book series as being a "monumental study"&lt;ref name ="APSR 1978"/&gt; having "inestimable value for anyone interested in international affairs",&lt;ref name ="Journal of Asian History 1972"/&gt; a scholarly tool very rich in detail&lt;ref name ="Journal of Asian History 1972"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="The Hispanic American Historical Review 1972"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Foreign Affairs 1968"/&gt; and comprehensive in scope,&lt;ref name ="Il Politico 1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Canadian Slavonic Papers 1972"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="The Hispanic American Historical Review 1972"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="The Slavonic and East European Review 1971"/&gt; free of cold war jargon,&lt;ref name ="Journal of Asian History 1972"/&gt; detached and impartial&lt;ref name ="Canadian Slavonic Papers 1972"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Canadian Slavonic Papers 1972"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="APSR 1978"/&gt;, and overall being a good distillation of the prior year's events into a single volume,&lt;ref name ="Il Politico 1971"/&gt; and "best available Reference on the contemporary communist world".&lt;ref name ="Il Politico 1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Soviet Studies 1979"/&gt;

The ''[[Washington Post]]'' reporting on the discontinuation of the book series in 1991, praised it as "a work long regarded as the most authoritative word on the subject."&lt;ref name="Washington Post 1991"/&gt;

===Challenges, limitations, and criticisms===
in 1970 the ''[[Slavic Review]]'' noted that in the 1960s new challenges arose in identifying communist parties and movements, with the scene having become "more confused by by the appearance of Marxist- oriented-guerrilla and 'New Leftist' movements which also might be designated 'Communist'."&lt;ref name ="Slavic Review 1970"/&gt; The authors coped with the multiplicity and divergence of communist branches by focussing their coverage on those self-described as [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] and those recognized by authoritative Communist publications, such as the [[World Marxist Review]]. However, the editors did still not "face up to (...) the concept of the 'international Communist movement.'"&lt;ref name ="Slavic Review 1970"/&gt;

Similarly Karl Schmitt writing for [[The Hispanic American Historical Review]] in 1972 also shared his concerns that the definition of communist parties had become inadequate.&lt;ref name ="The Hispanic American Historical Review 1972"/&gt;

Early in the series some reviewers pointed that the wealth of compiled objective data in the book would have benefitted from providing more interpretation, analysis, and theoretical considerations.&lt;ref name ="Slavic Review 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="The Hispanic American Historical Review 1972"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="APSR 1978"/&gt; Some reviewers concluded that the work reads more like an encyclopedia,&lt;ref name ="The Hispanic American Historical Review 1972"/&gt; dictionary,&lt;ref name ="APSR 1978"/&gt; or "catalogue"&lt;ref name ="APSR 1978"/&gt; than an "analytical perspective".&lt;ref name ="APSR 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="The Hispanic American Historical Review 1972"/&gt; On that regard, the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' further noted that the work contained "too much factual summary",&lt;ref name ="APSR 1978"/&gt; however "within the framework and strictures of this probably insoluble problem, Staar and his able editorial staff did an outstanding job in offering us invaluable raw materials"&lt;ref name ="APSR 1978"/&gt; that are of value to further study of the movement and literature of contemporary international Communist affairs.&lt;ref name ="APSR 1978"/&gt;

in 1970, the reviewer for that year's book for ''[[Africa Today]]'' noted that the Africanists would find the coverage on Africa to be weak, while still noting that the sections with Communist parties in the rest of the world were quite valuable.&lt;ref name ="Africa Today 1970"/&gt; On the other hand, in 1972 the ''Journal of Asian History'' remarked that the Asian countries were thoroughly covered.&lt;ref name ="Journal of Asian History 1972"/&gt;

Some commentators also noted the high price of the first volumes may have put the book out of reach of many, but later that was changed by making it more affordable.&lt;ref name ="Journal of Asian History 1972"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Canadian Slavonic Papers 1972"/&gt; Also it was noted that some data from year to year might have been repetitive, as some basic facts about the parties remained the same.&lt;ref name ="Slavic Review 1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Canadian Slavonic Papers 1972"/&gt; The reviewer for ''[[Canadian Slavonic Papers]]'' wondered "Would it not be wiser to prepare revised volume every five or six years and keep it up to date with annual supplements which included only new material?" &lt;ref name ="Canadian Slavonic Papers 1972"/&gt; As the new editions changed a bit their format from prior ones, some reviewers lamented the shortening or removal of some sections such as documentation, chronicle, or introduction.&lt;ref name ="Canadian Slavonic Papers 1972"/&gt;

[[w:pl:Ryszard Szawłowski|Ryszard Szawłowski]] writing for ''[[Soviet Studies]]'' in 1979 opined that some contributing authors for the Yearbook were based far away from their target countries of study, and believing that recruiting contributors closer to their geographical areas of study that would enable them to provide a more nuanced and on-the-ground recounting of facts.&lt;ref name ="Soviet Studies 1979"/&gt;

A minority of reviewers also questioned some of the relevance of the Yearbook. Charles B. McLane, writing for the ''Canadian Slavonic Papers'' asserted in 1972 that there was some irony in the appearance of the series "two decades after it was most urgently needed",&lt;ref name ="Canadian Slavonic Papers 1972"/&gt; as "In the years after World War II, when intense anti-Communist sentiment in Western Europe and the United States coloured the reporting of developments in the Communist world scholars, government officials and the public at large would have profited greatly by the dispassionate appraisals which characterize the Yearbooks".&lt;ref name ="Canadian Slavonic Papers 1972"/&gt; However, the by the time the Yearbook series appeared, the world communist movement was already "a less formidable force in international politics than it once was, or appeared to be.", with a small number of countries with significant but already well-studied movements, and many others being marginal and of no meaningful impact in international affairs.&lt;ref name ="Canadian Slavonic Papers 1972"/&gt;

Near the end of the series, and shortly after the [[Berlin Wall|fall of the Berlin Wall]], Gerald Segal writing in 1990 for the ''[[International Affairs (journal)|International Affairs]]'' journal, commented on the declining relevance of the book series as communism as a major geopolitical factor was fading; for "those who dare to retain an interest in comparative communism" the 1990 volume may continue to offer them an "essential"&lt;ref name ="International Affairs 1990"/&gt; "meticulous report" on the prior year's events,&lt;ref name ="International Affairs 1990"/&gt; but for most, the events in the communist world had become "[[wikt:esoteric|esoteric]] history".&lt;ref name ="International Affairs 1990"/&gt;

The ''World Strength of the Communist Party Organizations'', was an annual report on communism of more limited scope, published by the [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]] of the U.S. Department of State since 1948. It was initially conceived as an "in-house" text on Communist parliamentary and party strength. It received favorable notice and was subsequently issued as a public document.&lt;ref name ="Slavic Review 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Canadian Slavonic Papers 1972"/&gt; Some editions are available on-line.&lt;ref name="Hathi Trust"/&gt;

Within the last decade, however, the scene has been confused by the appearance of Marxist- oriented-guerrilla and 'New Leftist' movements which also might be designated 'Communist.' The editors of the yearbook have coped with this development by treating as Communist parties only those that describe themselves as Marxist- Leninist and are so recognized by authoritative Communist publications, such as the World Marxist Review.

In the years after World War II, when intense anti-Communist sentiment in Western Europe and the United States coloured the reporting of developments in the Communist world scholars, government officials and the public at large would have profited greatly by the dispassionate appraisals which characterize the Yearbooks. Today these appraisals are less crucial to a grasp of world affairs. The world Communist movement itself, wracked by its own internal convolutions, is a less formidable force in international politics than it once was, or appeared to be. Most of the parties dealt with in meticulous detail in the Yearbooks are now almost without significance in their local political setting and are not likely to gain stature in the years immediately ahead; their leverage in international affairs is negligible. The parties that are important – that is, those in power and a dozen or so others which play an active part in democratic systems (as in Italy and France) – are better understood today through wider and more exacting research.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
