The '''1993 Storm of the Century''' (also known as the '''{{'}}93 Superstorm''', '''The No Name Storm''', or the '''Great Blizzard of 1993''') was a large [[cyclone|cyclonic]] storm that formed over the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on March 12, 1993. The storm was unique and notable for its intensity, massive size, and wide-reaching effects; at its height, the storm stretched from Canada to [[Honduras]].&lt;ref name=NOAA&gt;{{cite web|last1=Armstrong|first1=Tim|title=Superstorm of 1993: "Storm of the Century"|url=http://www.weather.gov/ilm/Superstorm93|website=NOAA|accessdate=February 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cyclone moved through the Gulf of Mexico and then through the eastern United States before moving on to Canada. The storm eventually dissipated in the North Atlantic Ocean on March 15, 1993.

Heavy snow was first reported in highland areas as far south as Alabama and northern Georgia, with Union County, Georgia reporting up to 35 inches of snow in the north Georgia mountains. [[Birmingham, Alabama]], reported a rare {{convert|13|in|cm}} of snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Birmingham Cold Weather Facts (updated Nov. 24, 2015)|url=https://www.weather.gov/bmx/climo_bhmcoldwxfacts|website=National Weather Service-Birmingham|accessdate=February 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ajc.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ajc.com/news/local/years-ago-atlanta-slammed-rare-blizzard/o73EFo56ljUslA8zfawsbL/ | title=21 years ago, Atlanta slammed by rare blizzard | work=ajc.com | date=March 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Florida Panhandle]] reported up to {{convert|4|in|cm}} of snow,&lt;ref name="ncdc-event-details"&gt;{{cite web|title=Event Details|author=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~194933|accessdate=December 22, 2010|year=1993|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416060920/http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~194933|archive-date=April 16, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Wind#Wind force scale|hurricane-force]] wind gusts and record low [[barometric pressure]]s. Between [[Louisiana]] and Cuba, the hurricane-force winds produced high [[storm surge]]s across the [[Big Bend (Florida)|big bend]] of Florida which, in combination with scattered [[tornado]]es, killed dozens of people.

Record cold temperatures were seen across portions of the south and east of the US in the wake of this storm. In the United States, the storm was responsible for the loss of [[electricity|electric power]] to more than 10&amp;nbsp;million households. An estimated 40&amp;nbsp;percent of the country's population experienced the effects of the storm&lt;ref name="assessment" /&gt; with a total of 208 fatalities.&lt;ref name="NOAA" /&gt;

==Meteorological history==
[[File:1993 storm century.jpg|thumb|left|A satellite image of the Storm of the Century on March 13, 1993.]]
During March 11 and 12, 1993, temperatures over much of the eastern United States began to drop as an [[arctic]] [[high pressure area|high pressure system]] built over the [[Midwest]] and [[Great Plains]]. Concurrently, an [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] [[low pressure area|area of low pressure]] formed over Mexico along a [[stationary front]] draped west to east. By the afternoon of March 12, a defined airmass boundary was present along the deepening low. An initial burst of convective precipitation off the southern coast of Texas (facilitated by the transport of tropical moisture into the region) enabled initial intensification of the surface feature on March 12. Supported by a strong split-polar [[jet stream]] and a [[shortwave (meteorology)|shortwave trough]], the nascent system [[bomb cyclone|rapidly deepened]].&lt;ref name="American"/&gt; The system's central pressure fell to {{convert|991|mbar|inHg|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} by 00:00&amp;nbsp;UTC on March 13. A powerful low-level jet over eastern Cuba and the Gulf of Mexico enhanced a [[cold front]] extending from the low southward to the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]]. Furthermore, the [[subtropical jet stream]] was displaced unusually far south, reaching into the Pacific Ocean near Central America and extending toward Honduras and Jamaica. Intense [[ageostrophic]] flow was noted over the southern United States, with winds flowing perpendicular to [[Isobar (meteorology)|isobars]] over [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref name="American"/&gt;

As the area of low pressure moved through the central Gulf of Mexico, a short wave trough in the northern branch of the jet stream fused with the system in the southern stream, which further strengthened the surface low. A [[squall line]] developed along the system's [[cold front]], which moved rapidly across the eastern Gulf of Mexico through Florida and Cuba.&lt;ref name="American"/&gt; The cyclone's center moved into north-west Florida early on the morning of March 13, with a significant [[storm surge]] in the northwestern Florida peninsula that drowned several people.

[[Barometric pressure]]s recorded during the storm were low. Readings of {{convert|976.0|mb|inHg}} were recorded in [[Tallahassee, Florida]], and even lower readings of {{convert|960.0|mb|inHg|lk=on}} were observed in New England. Low pressure records for March were set in areas of twelve states along the Eastern Seaboard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/research/roth/MarchWhenRecordLowSLPs.gif|author=David M. Roth|publisher=[[Weather Prediction Center]]|title=Occurrence of March Record Low SLPs|date=March 2016|accessdate=March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with all-time low pressure records set between Tallahassee and Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/research/roth/AllTimeWhenRecordLowSLPs.gif|author=David M. Roth|publisher=[[Weather Prediction Center]]|title=Months when All-Time Record Low SLPs Were Set|year=2016|accessdate=March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snow began to spread over the eastern United States, and a large squall line moved from the Gulf of Mexico into Florida and Cuba. The storm system tracked up the East Coast during Saturday and into Canada by early Monday morning. In the storm's wake, unseasonably cold temperatures were recorded over the next day or two in the [[Southeastern_United_States|Southeast]].

===Forecasting===
The 1993 Storm of the Century marked a milestone in the [[weather forecasting]] of the United States. By March 8, 1993, several operational [[numerical weather prediction]] models and medium-range [[Meteorologist|forecasters]] at the United States [[National Weather Service]] recognized the threat of a significant [[snowstorm]]. This marked the first time National Weather Service meteorologists were able to predict accurately a system's severity five days in advance. Official [[blizzard warning]]s were issued two days before the storm arrived, as shorter-range models began to confirm the predictions. Forecasters were finally confident enough of the computer-forecast models to support decisions by several northeastern states to declare a [[State of Emergency]] even before the snow started to fall.&lt;ref name="nws200"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Forecasting the "Storm of the Century"  | url = http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/events/storm/welcome.html#firsts  | date=December 14, 2006 |accessdate =March 14, 2007|author=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storm complex was large and widespread, affecting at least 26 US states and much of eastern Canada.  It brought in cold air along with heavy precipitation and hurricane-force winds which, ultimately, caused a [[blizzard]] over the affected area; this also included [[thundersnow]] from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to [[Pennsylvania]] and widespread [[Whiteout (weather)|whiteout]] conditions. Snow flurries were seen in the air as far south as [[Jacksonville, Florida]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KNIP/1993/3/13/DailyHistory.html?req_city=NA&amp;req_state=NA&amp;req_statename=NA |title=History &amp;#124; Weather Underground |publisher=Wunderground.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some areas of [[central Florida]] received a trace of snow. The storm severely impacted both ground and air travel. Airports were closed all along the eastern seaboard, and flights were cancelled or diverted, thus stranding many passengers along the way. Every airport from [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], to [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], was closed for some time because of the storm. Highways were also closed or restricted all across the affected region, even in states generally well prepared for snow emergencies.

Some affected areas in the Appalachian Mountain region saw {{convert|5|ft|m}} of snow, and snowdrifts as high as {{convert|35|ft|m}}. [[Mount Leconte, Tennessee]] recorded 60 inches of snowfall and Mount Mitchell, N.C. recorded 49 inches.  The [[volume]] of the storm's total snowfall was later computed to be {{convert|12.91|mi3|km3}}, an amount which would weigh (depending on the variable [[density]] of snow) between 5.4 and 27&amp;nbsp;billion tons.

The weight of the record snowfalls [[collapse (structural)|collapse]]d several factory roofs in the [[Southern United States|South]]; and [[snowdrift]]s on the [[windward]] sides of buildings caused a few [[deck (building)|decks]] with substandard [[anchor]]s to fall from homes. Though the storm was forecast to strike the snow-prone [[Appalachian Mountains]], hundreds of people were nonetheless [[rescue]]d from the Appalachians, many caught completely off guard on the [[Appalachian Trail]] or in [[Hunting cabin|cabin]]s and lodges in remote locales. Snow drifts up to {{convert|14|ft|m}} were observed at [[Mount Mitchell]]. Snowfall totals of between {{convert|2|and|3|ft|m}} were widespread across northwestern North Carolina.  [[Boone, North Carolina]]—in a high-elevation area accustomed to heavy snowfalls—was nonetheless caught off-guard by more than 30 inches of snow and 24&amp;nbsp;hours of temperatures below {{convert|11|°F|°C}}. Boone's Appalachian State University closed that week, for the first time in its history. Stranded motorists at [[Deep Gap, North Carolina|Deep Gap]] broke into Parkway Elementary School to survive, and National Guard helicopters dropped hay in fields to keep livestock from starving in northern N.C. mountain counties. 

In Virginia, the LancerLot sports arena in [[Vinton, Virginia|Vinton]] collapsed due to the weight of the record snowfall, as did the roofs of a [[Lowe's]] store in [[Christiansburg, Virginia|Christiansburg]] and the [[Dedmon Center]], at [[Radford University]]. Thousands of travelers were stranded along interstate highways in [[Southwest Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.roanoke.com/weather/region-s-blizzard-of-still-widely-remembered/article_66ef8b52-7e24-5f2c-be1c-b1fafd7d39ed.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Electricity was not restored to many isolated rural areas for up to three weeks, with power outages occurring all over the east.  Nearly 60,000 lightning strikes were recorded as the storm swept over the country for a total of 72 hours.  As one of the most powerful, complex storms in recent history, this storm was described as the "Storm of the Century" by many of the areas affected.

===Gulf of Mexico===
The [[United States Coast Guard]] dealt with "absolutely incredible, unbelievable" conditions within the Gulf of Mexico.  The 200-ft. freighter ''Fantastico'' sank 70 miles off [[Ft. Myers, Florida]], and seven of her crew died when a Coast Guard helicopter was forced back to base due to low fuel levels after rescuing three of her crew.  The 147-ft. freighter ''Miss Beholden'' ran aground on a [[coral reef]] ten miles from [[Key West, Florida]].  Several other smaller vessels sank in the rough seas.  In all, the Coast Guard rescued 235&amp;nbsp;people from over 100&amp;nbsp;boats across the Gulf of Mexico during the tempest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/natural-disasters/4219886|title=Superstorm: Eastern and Central U.S., March 1993|author=John Galvin|journal=Popular Mechanics|date=December 18, 2009|publisher=Hearst Communication, Inc.|page=1| accessdate= November 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides producing record-low barometric pressure across a swath of the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]] and [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] states, and contributing to one of the nation's biggest snowstorms, the low produced a potent squall line ahead of its [[weather front|cold front]]. The [[squall line]] produced a serial [[derecho]] as it moved into Florida and Cuba shortly after midnight on March 13.  Straight-line winds gusted above 100&amp;nbsp;mph ({{convert|100|mph|kn|disp=output only}}, {{convert|100|mph|km/h|disp=output only}}) at many locations in Florida as the [[squall line]] moved through. A substantial tree fall was seen statewide from this system. The [[supercell]]s in the derecho produced eleven tornadoes. The first tornado was an F2 that touched down in [[Chiefland, Florida|Chiefland]] at 04:38&amp;nbsp;UTC on March 13, damaging several mobile and downing trees and power lines. Three people were killed and seven people sustained injures. Around the same time, an F1 tornado was spawned near [[Crystal River, Florida|Crystal River]]. After moving eastward into the town, the twister damaged 15&amp;nbsp;homes, several of them severely. A total of three people were injured. The next tornado was a waterspout that moved ashore over [[Treasure Island, Florida|Treasure Island]] around 05:00&amp;nbsp;UTC. Rated F0, the tornado deroofed one home, damaged several others, and impacted a few boats.&lt;ref name="sd"&gt;{{cite journal|volume=35|number=3|journal=Storm Data|title=Storm Data and Unusual Weather Phenomena|date=March 1993|issn=0039-1972|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|accessdate=March 12, 2018|url=https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/orders/IPS/IPS-2BDEEC96-FD2E-47CC-855E-9D2A39ACDD98.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6xsEtWTaJ?url=https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/orders/IPS/IPS-2BDEEC96-FD2E-47CC-855E-9D2A39ACDD98.pdf|archivedate=March 12, 2018|location=Asheville, North Carolina|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Around 05:04&amp;nbsp;UTC, an F0 tornado was reported in [[New Port Richey, Florida|New Port Richey]], damaging several homes and injuring 11&amp;nbsp;people. About 16&amp;nbsp;minutes later, an F2 tornado formed to the southwest of [[Ocala, Florida|Ocala]]. Many trees fell and several storage buildings and a warehouse suffered extensive damage, while one hangar was destroyed and two others received major damage at the [[Ocala International Airport]]. At 05:20&amp;nbsp;UTC, approximately the same time as the Ocala tornado, another twister &amp;ndash; rated F1 &amp;ndash; touched down near [[LaCrosse, Florida|LaCrosse]]. Several trees and power lines were downed and a few homes were destroyed, one from a propane explosion. One person was killed and four others received injuries. About 10&amp;nbsp;minutes later, another F2 twister was spawned near [[Howey-in-the-Hills, Florida|Howey-in-the-Hills]]. It moved through [[Mount Dora, Florida|Mount Dora]], destroying 13&amp;nbsp;homes, substantially damaging 80&amp;nbsp;homes, and inflicting minor damage on 266&amp;nbsp;homes. One person, a 5-month-old baby, was killed, while two others were injured.&lt;ref name="sd"/&gt;

At 05:30&amp;nbsp;UTC, a waterspout-turned F0 tornado tossed a {{convert|23|ft|m|abbr=on}} sailboat about {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=on}} at the [[Davis Islands (Tampa)|Davis Islands]] yacht club in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], while five other boats broke loose from their cradles and twelve were smashed into the seawall. About 30&amp;nbsp;minutes later,
an F1 tornado formed in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], demolishing four dwellings and damaging sixteen others.&lt;ref name="sd"/&gt; Also at 06:00&amp;nbsp;UTC, an F0 tornado spawned near [[Bartow, Florida|Bartow]] snapped a few trees and damaged a few doors. The eleventh and final tornado developed in Jacksonville at 06:10&amp;nbsp;UTC. The twister damaged a few trees near the [[Jacksonville International Airport]]. At the airport itself, the tornado damaged several jetways and service vehicles, while a [[Boeing 737]] was pushed about {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="sd"/&gt;

A substantial [[storm surge]] was also generated along the gulf coast from [[Apalachee Bay]] in the Florida Panhandle to north of [[Tampa Bay]]. Due to the angle of the coast relative to the approaching squall, [[Taylor County, Florida|Taylor County]] along the eastern portion of [[Apalachee Bay]] and [[Hernando County]] north of [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] were especially hard-hit.&lt;ref name="ncdc-event-details"/&gt;

Storm surges in those areas reached up to {{convert|12|ft|m}},&lt;ref name="superstorm-march-1993" /&gt; higher than many hurricanes. With little advance warning of incoming severe conditions, some coastal residents were awakened in the early morning of March 13 by the waters of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] rushing into their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.sptimes.com/weather/SW.3.3.html|title=Losing a home, then losing a life|author=Rick Gershman|publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=March 18, 1993|accessdate=December 22, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723153944/http://www2.sptimes.com/weather/SW.3.3.html|archivedate=July 23, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; More people died from drowning in this storm than during [[Hurricane Hugo|Hurricanes Hugo]] and [[Hurricane Andrew|Andrew]] combined.&lt;ref name="assessment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/assessments/superstorm/superstorm.pdf|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=December 21, 2010|title=Assessment of the Superstorm of March 1993|author=Office of Meteorology|date=August 24, 2000| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110104132301/http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/assessments/superstorm/superstorm.pdf| archivedate=January 4, 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the storm's surge, winds, and tornadoes damaged or destroyed 18,000&amp;nbsp;homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.sptimes.com/weather/SW.3.html|title=A storm with no name|author=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|year=1999|accessdate=December 22, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723153951/http://www2.sptimes.com/weather/SW.3.html|archivedate=July 23, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 47&amp;nbsp;lives were lost in Florida due to this storm.&lt;ref name="ncdc-event-details"/&gt;

===Cuba===
In Cuba, wind gusts reached {{convert|100|mph|km/h}} in the [[Havana]] area. A survey conducted by a research team from the Institute of Meteorology of Cuba suggests that the maximum winds could have been as high as {{convert|130|mph|km/h}}.  It is the most damaging squall line ever recorded in Cuba.

There was widespread and significant damage in Cuba, with damage estimated as intense as [[Fujita scale|F2]].&lt;ref name="American"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Arnaldo P. Alfonso  |author2=Lino R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4288">'''Alkali metal halides''' (also known as '''alkali halides''') are the family of [[inorganic compound]]s with the chemical formula MX, where M is an [[alkali metal]] and X is a [[halogen]]. These compounds are the often commercially significant sources of these metals and halides.  The best known of these compounds is [[sodium chloride]], [[table salt]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, N. N.; &amp; Earnshaw, A. (1997). Chemistry of the Elements (2nd Edn.), Oxford:Butterworth-Heinemann. {{ISBN|0-7506-3365-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Halit-Kristalle.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Halide is the mineral form of sodium chloride.]]

==Structure==
Most alkali metal halides crystallize with the [[face centered cubic]] lattices. In this structure both the metals and halides feature [[octahedral coordination geometry]], in which each ion has a [[coordination number]] of six.  Caesium chloride, bromide, and iodide crystallize in a [[body-centered cubic]] lattice that accommodates coordination number of eight for the larger metal cation (and the anion also).&lt;ref&gt;Wells, A.F. (1984) Structural Inorganic Chemistry, Oxford: Clarendon Press. {{ISBN|0-19-855370-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:NaCl polyhedra.png|180px|left|thumb|Ball-and-stick model of the coordination of Na and Cl in NaCl.  Most alkali metal halides adopt this structure.]]
[[File:CsCl polyhedra.png|180px|left|thumb|Ball-and-stick model of the coordination of Cs and Cl in CsCl]]

==Properties==
The alkali metal halides exist as colourless [[crystalline]] solids, although as finely ground powders appear white.  They melt at high temperature, usually several hundred degrees to colorless liquids.  Their high melting point reflects their high [[lattice energy|lattice energies]].  At still higher temperatures, these liquids evaporate to give gases composed of diatomic molecules.

These compounds dissolve in polar solvents to give ionic solutions that contain highly solvated anions and cations. Alkali halides dissolve large amounts of the corresponding alkali metal: caesium is completely miscible at all temperatures above the melting point.&lt;ref name="HKK4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huheey|first1=James E.|last2=Keiter|first2=Ellen A.|last3=Kieter|first3=Richard L.|title=Inorganic chemistry : principles of structure and reactivity|date=1993|publisher=Harper|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts [u.a.]|isbn=006042995X|pages=377|edition=4.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The table below provides links to each of the individual articles for these compounds. The numbers beside the compounds show the electronegativity difference between the elements based on the [[Pauling scale]]. The higher the number is, the more ionic the solid is.

&lt;!-- more useful would be properties - lattice parameters, melting point, solubility in water, other solvents and molten salts. The focus on electronegativity is something that young chem students adhere to, but is not particularly useful or even interesting in the "adult world"--&gt;

'''''Americathon''''' (also known as '''''Americathon 1998''''') is a 1979 [[United States|American]] [[comedy film]] starring [[John Ritter]], [[Fred Willard]], [[Peter Riegert]], [[Harvey Korman]], and [[Nancy Morgan]], with narration by [[George Carlin]], based on a play by [[Firesign Theatre]] [[alumni]] [[Phil Proctor]] and [[Peter Bergman (comedian)|Peter Bergman]]. The film also includes appearances by [[Jay Leno]], [[Meat Loaf]], [[Tommy Lasorda]], and [[Chief Dan George]], with a musical performance by [[Elvis Costello]].

Being set 20 years into the future, the film contains many prophetic elements, such as: predicting the demise of the [[Soviet Union]], the prevalence of reality television, and the sale of public assets to the [[private sector]] (a trend starting shortly after the film's release).  Also, [[The Beach Boys]] are shown still together and recording in 1998.

==Plot==
In the (then-near future) year 1998, the United States has run out of [[oil]], and many Americans are living in their now-stationary cars and using nonpowered means of transportation such as jogging, riding bicycles and rollerskating.  Many Americans wear sweatsuits.  Paper money has become completely worthless, with all business transactions being conducted in [[gold]]; even a coin-operated elevator warns, "Gold Coins Only".  In search of leadership, Americans elect Chet Roosevelt (Ritter) as [[President of the United States|President]].  Roosevelt, a "cosmically inspired" former [[governor of California]], proves to have little in common with [[Theodore Roosevelt|Teddy Roosevelt]] or [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|FDR]] other than his name.  Roosevelt, an overly-optimistic man who quotes positive affirmation slogans, stages a number of highly publicized fund raising events, all of which fail.  He becomes interested in having a relationship with [[Vietnamese American]] pop superstar Mouling Jackson.  Real money comes in the form of loans from a [[cartel]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], led by billionaire Sam Birdwater (George), in control of [[Nike Inc.|Nike]] (which has been renamed "National Indian Knitting Enterprise").

The [[United States government|federal government]], now housed in "The Western [[White House]]" (a [[Sublease|sub-leased]] [[condominium]] in [[Marina del Rey, California]]), finds itself facing [[Sovereign default|national bankruptcy]] and in danger of being foreclosed and repossessed when Birdwater goes public on national television with the fact that he lent America billions of dollars and now wants the money back, the alternative being [[foreclosure]] and the country reverting to its original owners, stating, "Hey, I have to eat, too.  Does that make me a bad guy?".

In desperation, Roosevelt hires a young television consultant Eric McMerkin (Riegert) to help produce a national raffle. Instead, they decide that the only way enough money can be raised to save America is instead to run a national [[telethon]], and hire vapid TV celebrity Monty Rushmore (Korman) to host it.  However, Presidential adviser Vincent Vanderhoff (Willard) is secretly plotting to have the telethon fail so that representatives of the United Hebrab Republic (formed by the merger of [[Israel]] and the [[Arab states]]) can purchase what is left of the country when Birdwater forecloses.

==Production notes==

===Music===
The [[Americathon (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] features "It's a Beautiful Day" by [[The Beach Boys]], "Crawling to the USA" by [[Elvis Costello]] and "Get a Move On" by [[Eddie Money]].

===Cast===
[[Dorothy Stratten]] appears, uncredited and in a brief non-speaking role, in a [[Playboy bunny]] style outfit during a scene where Meat Loaf's character donates blood. The [[Del Rubio triplets]] can be seen performing "[[America the Beautiful]]" behind several posing bodybuilders. [[John Carradine]] was to have played "Uncle Sam" in this film, but his scenes did not make the final cut edit. Director [[Neal Israel]] has a cameo as a protesting [[Rabbi]] holding a picket sign reading "The President Is A Yutz" ([[Yiddish]] for "a stupid, clueless person").

===Playwrights===
In a scene where Eric McMerkin is reading a list of "Government Approved" performers, the names of "Proctor &amp; Bergman" (the co-authors of the original play) can be seen fifth on the list, credited as "Comics." Peter Bergman and Phil Proctor were members of the satirical comedy performance group Firesign Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nightflight.com/americathon-the-prescient-1979-absurd-comedy-that-predicted-americas-unfunny-future/|title=“Americathon”: The prescient 1979 absurd comedy that predicted America’s unfunny future|website=nightflight.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion==
To promote the movie, in 1979 [[Ted Coombs]] roller skated across the United States and back and gained a place in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]].'' A [[photo novel]] of the film was also released in 1979, and the musical soundtrack was released on both [[LP record|vinyl]] and [[audiocassette]] by Lorimar Records.

==Home media==
The film was made available on VHS and laserdisc in the 1980s by Lorimar Home Video, both of which are now out of print. The home video rights passed to Warner Bros. in the late 1980s as part of their purchase of Lorimar.  [[Warner Home Video]] made the film available in January 2011 on DVD in widescreen (1.85:1) format as part of their [[Warner Archive]] Manufacture-on-demand collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbshop.com/Americathon/1000180062,default,pd.html?cgid=|title=Americathon|work=www.WBShop.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1984, [[New York City]] [[public radio]] station [[WNYC]] sponsored a marathon of American music dubbed "Americathon '84."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html|title=WNYC 'AMERICATHON,' FREE CONCERT AT PUBLIC|first=Edward|last=Rothstein|date=17 February 1984|publisher=|accessdate=23 September 2016|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predictions==
Referencing the movie's futuristic premise itself,  there were many societal or political forecasts woven into the storyline, and a number of these have become reality, including:
   
*The [[People's Republic of China]] embracing [[capitalism]] and becoming a global economic [[superpower]].&lt;ref name=mainst&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-movies-predicted-future|title=10 Movies That Predicted the Future|author=Joe Mont|date=5 August 2011|work=MainStreet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cracked /&gt;

Ardcanaght Stones are located {{Convert|1.7|km}} west of [[Castlemaine, County Kerry|Castlemaine]], to the north of the [[River Maine (County Kerry)|River Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=4jgaAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Ardcanaght%22+ogham&amp;dq=%22Ardcanaght%22+ogham&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9rdKqtfPVAhUBIMAKHUYvBJUQ6AEILDAB|title=Corpus Inscriptionum Insularum Celticarum|first=Robert Alexander Stewart|last=Macalister|date=25 August 2017|publisher=Stationery office|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=L9v-wo0DWUoC&amp;q=%22Ardcanaght%22+ogham&amp;dq=%22Ardcanaght%22+ogham&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9rdKqtfPVAhUBIMAKHUYvBJUQ6AEIMTAC|title=AA touring guide to Ireland|first1=Automobile Association (Great|last1=Britain)|first2=Russell|last2=Beach|date=1 January 1976|publisher=AA|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The inscriptions are too fragmentary to give them a precise date. Ogham carvings were made in Ireland between the 4th and 10th centuries. They were rediscovered in the 1940s and moved here in recent years from a [[cillín]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ogham.celt.dias.ie/site.php?lang=en&amp;site=Ardcanaght&amp;stoneinfo=description|title=Ogham in 3D - Ardcanaght|website=ogham.celt.dias.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.megalithicmonumentsofireland.com/COUNTIES/KERRY/Ardcanaght_OghamStones.html|title=ARDCANAGHT OGHAM STONES/MEGALITHIC MONUMENTS OF IRELAND.COM|first=PIP|last=2010.|website=www.megalithicmonumentsofireland.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The two stones are accompanied by a large [[menhir|standing stone]], 1.6&amp;nbsp;m (5&amp;nbsp;ft 3&amp;nbsp;in) tall.

The stones are:
* 246a: 90&amp;nbsp;cm (3 feet) tall with the inscription &lt;small&gt;LMCBLTCL  LT&lt;/small&gt;
* 246b: a small fragment with the inscription &lt;small&gt;V MAQỊ&lt;/small&gt;. "MAQI" commonly appears on Ogham inscriptions; it means "son [of]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8591">An '''axial turbine''' is a [[turbine]] in which the flow of the working fluid is parallel to the shaft, as opposed to [[radial turbine]]s, where the fluid runs around a shaft, as in a [[watermill]]. An axial turbine has similar construction as an [[axial compressor]], but it operates in the reverse, converting flow of the fluid into rotating mechanical energy. 

A set of static guide vanes or nozzle vanes accelerates and adds swirl to the fluid and directs it to the next row of turbine blades mounted on a turbine rotor.

==Stage velocity triangle==
The angles in the absolute system are noted by alpha (α) and the angles in the relative system are noted by beta (β). Axial and tangential components of both absolute and relative velocities are shown in the figure. Static and [[Stagnation point|stagnation]] values of pressure and [[enthalpy]] in the absolute and relative systems are also shown.

[[File:Velocity triangle for an axial turbine stage.jpg|center|upright=1.3|Velocity triangle for a turbine stage]]

It is often assumed that the axial velocity component remains constant through the stage. From this condition we get,&lt;br/&gt;
c&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; cos α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cos α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:= w&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cos β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = c&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cos α&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = w&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cos α&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
Also, for constant axial velocity yields a useful relation:

tan α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + tan α&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = tan β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + tan β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

==Single impulse stage==
A single-stage impulse turbine is shown in Figure

[[File:Single stage Impulse Turbine.jpg|thumb|center|upright=1.3|Single-stage impulse turbine]]

There is no change in the static pressure through the rotor of an impulse machine. The variation of pressure and velocity of the fluid through the stage is also shown in Figure.

The absolute velocity of the fluid increases corresponding to the pressure drop through the nozzle blade row in which only transformation of energy occurs. The transfer of energy occurs only across the rotor blade row. Therefore, the absolute fluid velocity decreases through this as shown in the figure.
In the absence of any pressure drop through the rotor blades the relative velocities at their entry and exit are the same for fricitionless flow. To obtain this condition the rotor blade angles must be equal. Therefore, the utilization factor is given by

:&lt;math&gt;E = U \frac{(c_{y2} + c_{y3})}{\frac{1}{2} c_{2}} &lt;/math&gt;

==Multi stage velocity compounded impulse==

When the pressure drop available is large, it cannot all be used in one turbine stage. A single stage utilizing a large pressure drop will have an impractically high peripheral speed of its rotor. This would lead to either a larger diameter or a very high rotational speed. Therefore, machines with large pressure drops employ more than one stage.

One of the methods to employ multi-stage expansion in impulse turbines is to generate high velocity of the fluid by causing it to expand through a large pressure drop in the nozzle blade row. This high velocity fluid then transfers its energy in a number of stages by employing many rotor blade rows separated by rows of fixed guide blades. A two-stage velocity compounded impulse turbine is shown in Figure

[[File:Two stage velocity compounded impulse turbine.jpg|thumb|center|upright=1.3|Two-stage velocity-compounded impulse turbine]]

The decrease in the absolute velocity of the fluid across the two rotor blade rows (R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is due to the energy transfer; the slight decrease in the fluid velocity through the fixed guide blades (F) is due to losses. Since the turbine is of the impulse type, the pressure of the fluid remains constant after its expansion in the nozzle blade row. Such stages are referred to as velocity or Curtis stages.

==Multi stage pressure compounded impulse==
There are two major problems in velocity-compounded stages:
*The nozzles have to be of the convergent-divergent type for generating high (supersonic) steam velocity. This results in a more expensive and difficult design of the nozzle blade rows.
*High velocity at the nozzle exit leads to higher cascade losses. Shock waves are generated if the flow is supersonic which further increase the losses.

To avoid these problems, another method of utilizing a high pressure ratio is employed in which the total pressure drop is divided into a number of impulse stages. These are known as pressure-compounded or Rateau stages. On account of the comparatively lower pressure drop, the nozzle blade rows are subsonic (M &lt; 1). Therefore, such a stage does not suffer from the disabilities of the velocity stages.

[[File:Two stage pressure compounded impulse turbine.jpg|thumb|center|upright=1.3|Two-stage pressure-compounded impulse turbine]]

Figure shows the variation of pressure and velocity of steam through the two pressure stages of an impulse turbine. The nozzle blades in
each stage receive flow in the axial direction.

Some designers employ pressure stages up to the last stage. This gives a turbine of shorter length as compared to the reaction type, with a penalty on efficiency.

==Reaction stages==
Figure shows two reaction stages and the variation of pressure and velocity of the gas in them. The gas pressure decreases continuously over both fixed and moving rows of blades. Since the pressure drop in each stage is smaller as compared to the impulse stages, the gas velocities are relatively low. Besides this the flow is accelerating throughout. These factors make the reaction stages aerodynamically more efficient though the tip leakage loss is increased on account of the relatively higher pressure difference across the rotor blades.

[[File:Two stage reaction turbine.jpg|thumb|center|upright=1.3|Two-stage reaction turbine]]

Multi-stage reaction turbines employ a large pressure drop by dividing it to smaller values in individual stages. Thus the reaction stages are like the pressure-compounded stages with a new element of “reaction” introduced in them, i.e. of accelerating the flow through rotor blade rows also.

==Blade-to-gas speed ratio==
[[File:Variation of utilization factor and stage efficiency with blade-to-gas speed ratio.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|Variation of utilization factor and stage efficiency with blade-to-gas speed ratio]]

The blade-to-gas speed ratio parameter (velocity ratio) σ = u/c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Efficiencies of the turbine stages can also be plotted against this ratio. Such plots for some impulse and reaction stages are shown in the figure.

The performance of steam turbines is often presented in this form. The curves in Figure also show the optimum values of the velocity ratio and the range of off-design for various types of stages. The fifty per cent reaction stage shows a wider range. Another important aspect that is depicted here is that in applications where high gas velocities (due to high pressure ratio) are unavoidable, it is advisable to employ impulse stages to achieve practical and convenient values of the size and speed of the machine. Sometimes it is more convenient to use an isentropic velocity ratio. This is the ratio of the blade velocity and the isentropic gas velocity that would be obtained in its isentropic expansion through the stage pressure ratio.

==Losses and efficiencies==

The losses occur in an actual turbine due to disc and bearing friction. Figure shows the energy flow diagram for the impulse stage of an axial turbine. Numbers in brackets indicate the order of energy or loss corresponding to 100 units of isentropic work (h&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; – h&lt;sub&gt;03ss&lt;/sub&gt;).

[[File:Energy flow diagram for the impulse stage of an axial turbine.jpg|center|upright=1.8|Energy flow diagram for the impulse stage of an axial turbine]]

It is seen that the energy reaching the shaft after accounting for stage cascade losses (nozzle and rotor blade aerodynamic losses) and leaving loss is about 85% of the ideal value; shaft losses are a negligible proportion of this value.

      <comment>Used to say HFC replaced CFC.  Used to say HFC is an ozone depleter. HFC is not an ozone depleter and didn’t originally replace CFC.  HCFC was replacement for CFC, and although much much lower in destructiveness, still has OFP value greater than 0. 


HFC was corrected to HCFC. HCFC (Hydrochlorofluorocarbon) was the replacement and is an ozone depleter.</comment>

A '''blowing agent''' is a substance which is capable of producing a [[Cell (biology)|cellular structure]] via a [[foaming]] process in a variety of materials that undergo hardening or [[phase transition]], such as [[polymer]]s, [[plastic]]s, and [[metal]]s. They are typically applied when the blown material is in a [[liquid|liquid stage]]. The cellular structure in a matrix reduces density, increasing thermal and acoustic insulation, while increasing relative stiffness of the original polymer.

Blowing agents (also known as 'pneumatogens') or related mechanisms to create holes in a matrix producing cellular materials, have been classified as follows: 

Physical blowing agents e.g. [[chlorofluorocarbon|CFCs]] (however, these are ozone depletants,  banned by [[Montreal Protocol]] of 1987), [[hydrochlorofluorocarbon|HCFCs]] (replaced CFCs, but are still ozone depletants, therefore being phased out), hydrocarbons (e.g. [[pentane]], [[isopentane]], [[cyclopentane]]), liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The bubble/foam-making process is irreversible and endothermic, i.e. it needs heat (e.g. from a melt process or the chemical exotherm due to cross-linking), to volatilize a liquid blowing agent. However, on cooling the blowing agent will condense, i.e. a reversible process.

Chemical blowing agents include [[isocyanate]] and water for [[polyurethane]], [[azodicarbonamide]] for vinyl, hydrazine and other nitrogen-based materials for thermoplastic and elastomeric foams, and [[sodium bicarbonate]] for thermoplastic foams. Gaseous products and other byproducts are formed by a chemical reaction of the chemical blowing agent, promoted by the heat of the foam production process or a reacting polymer's [[exothermic]] heat. Since the blowing reaction occurs forming low molecular weight compounds acting as the blowing gas, additional [[exothermic]] heat is also released.  Powdered [[titanium hydride]] is used as a [[foaming agent]] in the production of [[metal foam]]s, as it decomposes to form [[hydrogen]] gas and [[titanium]] at elevated temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banhart |first1=John |last2= |first2= |year=2000 |title=Manufacturing Routes for Metallic Foams |journal= JOM |volume=52 |issue=12 |pages=22–27 |publisher=Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society |doi= 10.1007/s11837-000-0062-8|url=http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/0012/Banhart-0012.html |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zirconium(II) hydride]] is used for the same purpose. Once formed the low molecular weight compounds will never revert to the original blowing agent; the reaction is irreversible.

Mixed physical/chemical blowing agents are used to produce flexible PU foams with very low densities. Here both the chemical and physical blowing are used in tandem to balance each other out with respect to thermal energy released and absorbed, minimizing temperature rise. Otherwise excessive exothermic heat because of high loading of a physical blowing agent can cause thermal degradation of a developing thermoset or [[polyurethane]] material. For instance, to avoid this in polyurethane systems isocyanate and water (which react to form [[carbon dioxide]]) are used in combination with liquid [[carbon dioxide]] (which boils to give gaseous form) in the production of very low density flexible PU foams for mattresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cannonviking.com/minisiti/news/house/cannonNews.asp?id=201&amp;lingua=uk|title=CarDio CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Technology Leaps Forward|accessdate=2012-01-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507050721/http://www.cannonviking.com/minisiti/news/house/cannonNews.asp?id=201&amp;lingua=uk|archivedate=2006-05-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanically made foams and froths, involves methods of introducing bubbles into liquid polymerisable matrices (e.g. an unvulcanised elastomer in the form of a liquid latex). Methods include whisking-in air or other gases or low boiling volatile liquids in low viscosity lattices, or the injection of a gas into an extruder barrel or a die, or into injection molding barrels or nozzles and allowing the shear/mix action of the screw to disperse the gas uniformly to form very fine bubbles or a solution of gas in the melt. When the melt is molded or extruded and the part is at atmospheric pressure, the gas comes out of solution expanding the polymer melt immediately before solidification. Frothing (akin to beating egg whites making a meringue), is also used to stabilize foamed liquid reactants, e.g. to prevent slumping occurring on vertical walls before cure – (i.e. avoiding foam collapse and sliding down a vertical face due to gravity).

Soluble fillers, e.g. solid sodium chloride crystals mixed into a liquid urethane system, which is then shaped into a solid polymer part, the sodium chloride is later washed out by immersing the solid molded part in water for some time, to leave small inter-connected holes in relatively high density polymer products, (e.g. Porvair synthetic leather materials for shoe uppers).

Hollow spheres and porous particles (e.g. glass shells/spheres, epoxide shells, PVDC shells, [[fly ash]], [[vermiculite]], other reticulated materials) are mixed and dispersed in the liquid reactants, which are then shaped into a solid polymer part containing a network of voids.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2565">'''Brisance''' {{IPAc-en|b|r|ɪ|ˈ|z|ɑ:|n|s}} is the shattering capability of a [[high explosive]], determined mainly by its [[detonation]] pressure.  The term can be traced from the [[French language|French]] verb "briser" (to break or shatter) ultimately derived from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] word "brissim" (to break).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brisance|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Brisance|work=Dictionary.com Unabridged|publisher=Random House, Inc.|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brisance is of practical importance for determining the effectiveness of an explosion in [[fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmenting]] shells, [[bomb]] casings, [[grenade]]s, structures, and the like. The [[sand crush test]] and [[Trauzl lead block test]] are commonly used to determine the relative brisance in comparison to [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] (which is considered a standard reference for many purposes).

Fragmentation occurs by the action of the transmitted shock wave, the strength of which depends on the detonation pressure of the explosive. Generally, the higher this pressure, the finer the fragments generated. High detonation pressure correlates with high [[detonation velocity]], the speed at which the detonation wave propagates through the explosive, but not necessarily with the explosive's total energy (or work capacity), some of which may be released after passage of the detonation wave. A more brisant explosive, therefore, projects smaller fragments but not necessarily at a higher velocity than a less brisant one.

One of the most brisant of the conventional explosives is cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (also known as [[RDX]] or Hexogen).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=TM 9-1300-214|publisher=US Army}}[http://www.freepyroinfo.com/Pyrotechnic/Pyrotechnic_Books/Tm_9_1300_214_U_S_Military_Explosives.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816140250/http://www.freepyroinfo.com/Pyrotechnic/Pyrotechnic_Books/Tm_9_1300_214_U_S_Military_Explosives.pdf |date=August 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RDX is the explosive agent in the plastic explosive commonly known as [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]], constituting 91% RDX by mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Global Security |title=Explosives – Compounds |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/explosives-compositions.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Calcium aluminates''' are a range of minerals&lt;ref&gt;Taylor H.F.W (1990) ''Cement Chemistry'', Academic Press, {{ISBN|0-12-683900-X}}, pp. 34–38.&lt;/ref&gt; obtained by heating [[calcium oxide]] and [[aluminium oxide]] together at high temperatures.  They are encountered in the manufacture of [[refractory|refractories]] and [[cement]]s.

The stable phases shown in the [[phase diagram]] (formed at [[atmospheric pressure]] under an atmosphere of [[relative humidity|normal humidity]]) are:

* [[Tricalcium aluminate]], 3CaO·Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (C3A)
* [[Dodecacalcium hepta-aluminate]], 12CaO·7Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (C12A7) (once known as mayenite &lt;ref&gt;https://www.mindat.org/min-43612.html&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Monocalcium aluminate]], CaO·Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (CA) (known in the nature as krotite and dmitryivanovite - two polymorphs &lt;ref&gt;https://www.mindat.org/min-40468.html&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Monocalcium dialuminate]], CaO·2Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (CA2) (occurring in the nature as grossite &lt;ref&gt;https://www.mindat.org/min-1754.html&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Monocalcium hexa-aluminate]], CaO·6Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (CA6) (known in the nature as hibonite, a representative of magnetoplumbite group &lt;ref&gt;https://www.mindat.org/min-1897.html&lt;/ref&gt;)

In addition, other phases include:

* [[Dicalcium aluminate]], 2CaO·Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (C2A), which exists only at pressures above 2500&amp;nbsp;MPa.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor H.F.W (1990) ''Cement Chemistry'', Academic Press, {{ISBN|0-12-683900-X}}, pp. 28, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;  The crystal is [[orthorhombic]], with density 3480&amp;nbsp;kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;. The natural dicalcium aluminate, brownmillerite, may form at normal pressure but elevated temperature in pyrometamorphic zones, e.g., in burning coal-mining heaps.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mindat.org/min-790.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pentacalcium trialuminate]], 5CaO·3Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (C5A3), forms only under an [[anhydrous]] and [[Wikt:anaerobic|oxygen free]] atmosphere.  The crystal is orthorhombic, with a density of 3067&amp;nbsp;kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;. It reacts rapidly with water.
* [[Tetracalcium trialuminate]], 4CaO·3Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (C4A3), is a [[metastable]] phase formed by [[dehydration|dehydrating]] 4CaO·3Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (C4A3H3).

==Medical uses==
Ceftazidime is used to treat lower respiratory tract, skin, urinary tract, blood-stream, joint, and abdominal infections, and meningitis.&lt;ref name="Sagent"/&gt; 
The drug is given [[intravenous|intravenously (IV)]] or [[intramuscular|intramuscularly (IM)]] every 8–12 hours (two or three times a day), with dose and frequencing varying by the type of infection, severity, and/or renal function of the patient. Ceftazidime is also commonly prescribed off-label for nebulization in Cystic Fibrosis patients for the suppression of Pseudomonas in the lungs as well as the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations. Those with kidney disease are dosed less frequently.&lt;ref name="Sagent"/&gt;

Ceftazidime is the first-line treatment for the tropical infection, [[melioidosis]], an important cause of sepsis in Asia and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=White NJ |title=Melioidosis |journal=Lancet |year=2003| volume=361| pages=1715–722| pmid=12767750 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13374-0 |issue=9370}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 2570956| year = 1989| author1 = White| first1 = N. J.| title = Halving of mortality of severe melioidosis by ceftazidime| journal = Lancet| volume = 2| issue = 8665| pages = 697–701| last2 = Dance| first2 = D.

Labeled indications include the treatment of patients with: 
* ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' infections
* other Gram-negative, aerobic infections
* neutropenic fever&lt;ref name="Lexi"/&gt;

As a class, cephalosporins have activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.  The balance of activity tips toward Gram-positive organisms for earlier generations; later generations of cephalosporins have more Gram-negative coverage.  Ceftazidime is one of the few in this class with activity against ''Pseudomonas''.  It is not active against methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus''.

=== Spectrum of activity ===
Clinically relevant organisms against which ceftazidime has activity include:
*'''Gram-negative aerobes''', such as ''Enterobacter'', ''E. coli'', ''H. influenzae'', ''Klebsiella'', ''Proteus'', ''Pseudomonas'', and ''N. meningitidis''
*'''Gram-positive aerobes''', such as group B streptococci, ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'', and ''Streptococcus pyogenes''
*'''Anaerobes''', such as ''Bacteroides''&lt;ref name="Sagent"/&gt;
The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few clinically significant pathogens:
* ''Escherichia coli'' – 0.015&amp;nbsp;µg/mL – 512&amp;nbsp;µg/mL
* ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' – ≤0.03&amp;nbsp;µg/mL – 1024&amp;nbsp;µg/mL &lt;ref&gt;http://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/Ceftazidime%20pentahydrate.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Side effects ==
Ceftazidime is generally well-tolerated.  When side effects do occur, they are most commonly local effects from the intravenous line site, allergic reactions, and gastrointestinal symptoms. According to one manufacturer, in clinical trials, allergic reactions including itching, rash, and fever, happened in fewer than 2% of patients. Rare but more serious allergic reactions, such as [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]], [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]], and [[erythema multiforme]], have been reported with this class of antibiotics, including ceftazidime. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, were reported in fewer than 2% of patients.&lt;ref name="Sagent"/&gt;

Another source reported, in addition, blood tests of patients may show increased eosinophils (8%), increased lactate dehydrogenase (6%), increased gamma-glutamyl transferase (5%), positive direct Coombs test (4%), increased platelets (thrombocythemia) (2%), increased ALT (7%), increased AST (6%), or increased alkaline phosphatase (4%).&lt;ref name="Lexi"&gt;Lexicomp Online, Lexi-Drugs, Hudson, Ohio: Lexi-Comp, Inc.; 2014; April 20, 2014. {{cite web |url=http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/patch_f/6560 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423041750/http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/patch_f/6560 |archivedate=2014-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contraindications ===
Ceftazidime is contraindicated in people with a known allergy to ceftazidime or to any other cephalosporin antibiotic.&lt;ref name="Sagent"/&gt;

=== Precautions ===
Ceftazidime is mainly eliminated by the kidneys into the urine.  As such, drug levels in the blood may build up in persons with kidney injury or kidney disease.  This includes those on dialysis.  In these cases of renal impairment, the drug is dosed less frequently.&lt;ref name="Lexi"/&gt;  No dose adjustment is needed for those with liver disease.

=== Pregnancy ===
Ceftazidime falls under the [[pregnancy category]] B.&lt;ref name="Lexi"/&gt;  According to the manufacturer, research studies in mice and rats showed no evidence of harm to the fetus, even at up to 40 times the human dose of ceftazidime.  Importantly, though, no high-quality research studies of the effects of the drug in pregnant women were conducted.&lt;ref name="Sagent"&gt;Ceftazidime for Injection(R) [package insert]. Schaumburg, IL: Sagent; 2012.  [http://www.sagentpharma.com/Products/Ceftazidime/Catalog/Ceftazidime_PI1.pdf PDF of insert] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423022408/http://www.sagentpharma.com/Products/Ceftazidime/Catalog/Ceftazidime_PI1.pdf |date=2014-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
Third-generation cephalosporins differ from earlier generations in the presence of a C=N-OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group in their chemical structure ([[cefuroxime]] &amp; [[cefuzonam]] also bear this [[functional group]] but are only listed as class II). This group provides improved stability against certain [[beta-lactamase]] enzymes produced by Gram-negative bacteria. These bacterial enzymes rapidly destroy earlier-generation cephalosporins by breaking open the drug's beta-lactam chemical ring, leading to antibiotic resistance. Though initially active against these bacteria, with widespread use of third-generation cephalosporins, some Gram-negative bacteria that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are even able to inactivate the third-generation cephalosporins. Infections caused by ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacteria are of particular concern in hospitals and other healthcare facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sharma M, Pathak S, Srivastava P |title=Prevalence and antibiogram of Extended Spectrum β-Lactamase (ESBL) producing Gram negative bacilli and further molecular characterization of ESBL producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp |journal=J Clin Diagn Res |volume=7 |issue=10 |pages=2173–7 |date=October 2013  |pmid=24298468 |pmc=3843424 |doi=10.7860/JCDR/2013/6460.3462 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
In addition to the ''syn''-configuration of the [[imino]] [[side chain]], compared to other third-generation cephalosporins, the more complex moiety (containing two [[methyl]] and a [[carboxylic acid]] group) confers extra stability to [[beta-lactamase|β-lactamase]] enzymes produced by many [[Gram-negative]] bacteria. The extra stability to β-lactamases increases the activity of ceftazidime against otherwise resistant Gram-negative organisms including ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''. The charged [[pyridine|pyridinium]] moiety increases water-solubility. Ceftazidime shares the same variable R-group side chain with [[aztreonam]], a [[monobactam]] antibiotic; the two drugs share a similar spectrum of activity, including activity against ''Pseudomonas''.

A '''centripetal force''' (from [[Latin]] ''centrum'', "center" and ''petere'', "to seek"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A new universal etymological, technological and pronouncing dictionary of the English language: embracing all terms used in art, science, and literature, Volume 1 |first1=John |last1=Craig |publisher=Harvard University |year=1849 |page=291 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nxBAAAAYAAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=0nxBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA291 Extract of page 291]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[force]] that makes a body follow a curved path. Its direction is always [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] to the motion of the body and towards the fixed point of the instantaneous [[osculating circle|center of curvature]] of the path. [[Isaac Newton]] described it as "a force by which bodies are drawn or impelled, or in any way tend, towards a point as to a centre".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=Isaac|title=The principia : mathematical principles of natural philosophy|year=2010|publisher=Snowball Pub.|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1-60796-240-3|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Newtonian mechanics, gravity provides the centripetal force responsible for astronomical orbits.

One common example involving centripetal force is the case in which a body moves with uniform speed along a circular path. The centripetal force is directed at right angles to the motion and also along the radius towards the centre of the circular path.&lt;ref name=Hibbeler&gt;{{cite book |title=Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics |author=Russelkl C Hibbeler |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=tOFRjXB-XvMC&amp;pg=PA131 |page=131 |chapter=Equations of Motion: Normal and tangential coordinates |isbn=978-0-13-607791-6 |year=2009 |edition=12 |publisher=Prentice Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tipler0&gt;{{cite book |title=Physics for scientists and engineers |page=129 |author1=Paul Allen Tipler |author2=Gene Mosca |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2HRFckqcBNoC&amp;pg=PA129 |isbn=978-0-7167-8339-8 |edition=5th |publisher=Macmillan |year=2003 }}

where &lt;math&gt;a_c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[centripetal acceleration]].
The direction of the force is toward the center of the circle in which the object is moving, or the [[osculating circle]] (the circle that best fits the local path of the object, if the path is not circular).&lt;ref&gt;

The speed in the formula is squared, so twice the speed needs four times the force. The inverse relationship with the radius of curvature shows that half the radial distance requires twice the force. This force is also sometimes written in terms of the [[angular velocity]] ''ω'' of the object about the center of the circle, related to the tangential velocity by the formula

: &lt;math&gt;v = \omega r&lt;/math&gt;

so that

: &lt;math&gt;F = m r \omega^2 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Expressed using the [[orbital period]] ''T'' for one revolution of the circle,

: &lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} \,&lt;/math&gt;

the equation becomes

: &lt;math&gt;F = m r \left(\frac{2\pi}{T}\right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Colwell|first=Catharine H.|title=A Derivation of the Formulas for Centripetal Acceleration|url=http://dev.physicslab.org/Document.aspx?doctype=3&amp;filename=CircularMotion_CentripetalAcceleration.xml|work=PhysicsLAB|accessdate=31 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particle accelerators, velocity can be very high (close to the speed of light in vacuum) so the same rest mass now exerts greater inertia (relativistic mass) thereby requiring greater force for the same centripetal acceleration, so the equation becomes:

: &lt;math&gt;F = \frac{\gamma m v^2}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

is called the [[Lorentz factor]].

More intuitively:

: &lt;math&gt;F = \gamma m v \omega&lt;/math&gt;

which is the rate of change of [[relativistic momentum]] (&lt;math&gt;\gamma m v&lt;/math&gt;)

[[File:Centripetal force diagram.svg|thumb|A body experiencing [[uniform circular motion]] requires a centripetal force, towards the axis as shown, to maintain its circular path.]]
In the case of an object that is swinging around on the end of a rope in a horizontal plane, the centripetal force on the object is supplied by the tension of the rope. The rope example is an example involving a 'pull' force. The centripetal force can also be supplied as a 'push' force, such as in the case where the normal reaction of a wall supplies the centripetal force for a [[wall of death (motorcycle act)|wall of death]] rider.

[[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s idea of a centripetal force corresponds to what is nowadays referred to as a [[central force]]. When a [[satellite]] is in [[orbit]] around a [[planet]], gravity is considered to be a centripetal force even though in the case of eccentric orbits, the gravitational force is directed towards the focus, and not towards the instantaneous center of curvature.&lt;ref&gt;

Another example of centripetal force arises in the helix that is traced out when a charged particle moves in a uniform [[magnetic field]] in the absence of other external forces. In this case, the magnetic force is the centripetal force that acts towards the helix axis.

== Analysis of several cases ==

Below are three examples of increasing complexity, with derivations of the formulas governing velocity and acceleration.

=== Uniform circular motion ===
{{See also|Uniform circular motion}}

Uniform circular motion refers to the case of constant rate of rotation. Here are two approaches to describing this case.

=== Calculus derivation ===

In two dimensions, the position vector &lt;math&gt;\textbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;, which has magnitude (length) &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and directed at an angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; above the x-axis, can be expressed in [[Cartesian coordinates]] using the [[unit vectors]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math alt="y-hat"&gt;\hat{y}&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt; \textbf{r} = r \cos(\theta) \hat{x} + r \sin(\theta) \hat{y}. &lt;/math&gt;

Assume [[uniform circular motion]], which requires three things.
# The object moves only on a circle.
# The radius of the circle &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; does not change in time.
# The object moves with constant [[angular velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; around the circle. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\theta = \omega t&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is time.

Now find the [[velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\textbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; and [[acceleration]] &lt;math&gt;\textbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; of the motion by taking derivatives of position with respect to time.

:::: &lt;math&gt; \textbf{r} = r \cos(\omega t) \hat{x} + r \sin(\omega t) \hat{y} &lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; \dot{\textbf{r}} = \textbf{v} = - r \omega \sin(\omega t) \hat{x} + r \omega \cos(\omega t) \hat{y} &lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; \ddot{\textbf{r}} = \textbf{a} = - r \omega^2 \cos(\omega t) \hat{x} - r \omega^2 \sin(\omega t) \hat{y} &lt;/math&gt;
:::: &lt;math&gt; \textbf{a} = - \omega^2 (r \cos(\omega t) \hat{x} + r \sin(\omega t) \hat{y}) &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the term in parenthesis is the original expression of &lt;math&gt;\textbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; in [[Cartesian coordinates]]. Consequently,

:: &lt;math&gt; \textbf{a} = - \omega^2 \textbf{r}. &lt;/math&gt;

negative shows that the acceleration is pointed towards the center of the circle (opposite the radius), hence it is called "centripetal" (i.e. "center-seeking"). While objects naturally follow a straight path (due to [[inertia]]), this centripetal acceleration describes the circular motion path caused by a centripetal force.

==== Derivation using vectors ====
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}

[[File:Circular motion vectors.svg|right|thumb|Vector relationships for uniform circular motion; vector '''Ω''' representing the rotation is normal to the plane of the orbit with polarity determined by the [[right-hand rule]] and magnitude ''dθ'' /''dt''.]]
The image at right shows the vector relationships for uniform circular motion. The rotation itself is represented by the angular velocity vector '''Ω''', which is normal to the plane of the orbit (using the [[right-hand rule]]) and has magnitude given by:
: &lt;math&gt; |\mathbf{\Omega}| = \frac {\mathrm{d} \theta } {\mathrm{d}t} = \omega \ , &lt;/math&gt;

with ''θ'' the angular position at time ''t''. In this subsection, d''θ''/d''t'' is assumed constant, independent of time. The distance traveled '''dℓ''' of the particle in time d''t'' along the circular path is
: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\ell} = \mathbf {\Omega} \times \mathbf{r}(t) \mathrm{d}t \ , &lt;/math&gt;

which, by properties of the [[vector cross product]], has magnitude ''r''d''θ'' and is in the direction tangent to the circular path.

Consequently,
: &lt;math&gt;\frac {\mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \lim_{{\Delta}t \to 0} \frac {\mathbf{r}(t + {\Delta}t)-\mathbf{r}(t)}{{\Delta}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{\ell}}{\mathrm{d}t} \ .&lt;/math&gt;

In other words,
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v}\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{ = }\ \frac {\mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac {\mathrm{d}\mathbf{\boldsymbol{\ell}}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf {\Omega} \times \mathbf{r}(t)\ . &lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating with respect to time,
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{ = }\ \frac {\mathrm{d} \mathbf{v}} {d\mathrm{t}} = \mathbf {\Omega} \times \frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{\Omega} \times \left[ \mathbf {\Omega} \times \mathbf{r}(t)\right] \ .&lt;/math&gt;

[[Triple product#Vector triple product|Lagrange's formula]] states:
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} \times \left ( \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} \right ) = \mathbf{b} \left ( \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} \right ) - \mathbf{c} \left ( \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} \right ) \ .&lt;/math&gt;

Applying Lagrange's formula with the observation that '''Ω • r'''(''t'') = 0 at all times,
:: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} = - {|\mathbf{\Omega|}}^2 \mathbf{r}(t) \ .&lt;/math&gt;

In words, the acceleration is pointing directly opposite to the radial displacement '''r''' at all times, and has a magnitude:
:: &lt;math&gt; |\mathbf{a}| = |\mathbf{r}(t)| \left ( \frac {\mathrm{d} \theta}{\mathrm{d}t} \right) ^2 = r {\omega}^2\ &lt;/math&gt;

where vertical bars |...| denote the vector magnitude, which in the case of '''r'''(''t'') is simply the radius ''r'' of the path. This result agrees with the previous section, though the notation is slightly different.

When the rate of rotation is made constant in the analysis of [[Centripetal force#Nonuniform circular motion|nonuniform circular motion]], that analysis agrees with this one.

A merit of the vector approach is that it is manifestly independent of any coordinate system.

==== Example: The banked turn ====
{{Main|Banked turn}}
{{See also|Reactive centrifugal force}}

[[File:Banked turn.svg|thumb|Upper panel: Ball on a banked circular track moving with constant speed ''v''; Lower panel: Forces on the ball]]

The upper panel in the image at right shows a ball in circular motion on a banked curve. The curve is banked at an angle ''θ'' from the horizontal, and the surface of the road is considered to be slippery. The objective is to find what angle the bank must have so the ball does not slide off the road.&lt;ref name = Lerner&gt;{{cite book |title = Physics for Scientists and Engineers |author = Lawrence S. Lerner |page = 128 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=kJOnAvimS44C&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=centripetal+%22banked+curve%22
|isbn = 978-0-86720-479-7 |year = 1997 |location = Boston |publisher = Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intuition tells us that, on a flat curve with no banking at all, the ball will simply slide off the road; while with a very steep banking, the ball will slide to the center unless it travels the curve rapidly.

Apart from any acceleration that might occur in the direction of the path, the lower panel of the image above indicates the forces on the ball. There are ''two'' forces; one is the force of gravity vertically downward through the center of mass of the ball ''m'''''g''', where ''m'' is the mass of the ball and '''g''' is the [[gravitational acceleration]]; the second is the upward [[normal force]] exerted by the road at a right angle to the road surface ''m'''''a'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. The centripetal force demanded by the curved motion is also shown above. This centripetal force is not a third force applied to the ball, but rather must be provided by the [[net force]] on the ball resulting from [[vector addition]] of the [[normal force]] and the [[force of gravity]]. The resultant or [[net force]] on the ball found by [[vector addition]] of the [[normal force]] exerted by the road and vertical force due to [[gravity]] must equal the centripetal force dictated by the need to travel a circular path. The curved motion is maintained so long as this net force provides the centripetal force requisite to the motion.

The horizontal net force on the ball is the horizontal component of the force from the road, which has magnitude |'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;| = ''m''|'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;|sin''θ''. The vertical component of the force from the road must counteract the gravitational force: |'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;| = ''m''|'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;|cos''θ'' = ''m''|'''g'''|, which implies |'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;|=|'''g'''| / cos''θ''. Substituting into the above formula for |'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;| yields a horizontal force to be:

: &lt;math&gt; |\mathbf{F}_\mathrm{h}| = m |\mathbf{g}| \frac { \mathrm{sin}\ \theta}{ \mathrm {cos}\ \theta} = m|\mathbf{g}| \mathrm{tan}\ \theta \ . &lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, at velocity |'''v'''| on a circular path of radius ''r'', kinematics says that the force needed to turn the ball continuously into the turn is the radially inward centripetal force '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; of magnitude:

: &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{F}_\mathrm{c}| = m |\mathbf{a}_\mathrm{c}| = \frac{m|\mathbf{v}|^2}{r} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, the ball is in a stable path when the angle of the road is set to satisfy the condition:

: &lt;math&gt;m |\mathbf{g}| \mathrm{tan}\ \theta = \frac{m|\mathbf{v}|^2}{r} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

or,

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{tan}\ \theta = \frac {|\mathbf{v}|^2} {|\mathbf{g}|r} \ .&lt;/math&gt;

As the angle of bank ''θ'' approaches 90°, the [[tangent function]] approaches infinity, allowing larger values for |'''v'''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''r''. In words, this equation states that for faster speeds (bigger |'''v'''|) the road must be banked more steeply (a larger value for ''θ''), and for sharper turns (smaller ''r'') the road also must be banked more steeply, which accords with intuition. When the angle ''θ'' does not satisfy the above condition, the horizontal component of force exerted by the road does not provide the correct centripetal force, and an additional frictional force tangential to the road surface is called upon to provide the difference. If [[friction]] cannot do this (that is, the [[coefficient of friction]] is exceeded), the ball slides to a different radius where the balance can be realized.&lt;ref name = Schaum&gt;{{cite book |title = Schaum's Outline of Applied Physics |author = Arthur Beiser |page = 103 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=soKguvJDgmsC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=friction+%22banked+turn%22

=== Nonuniform circular motion ===
{{See also|Circular motion|Non-uniform circular motion}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}

[[File:Nonuniform circular motion.svg|thumb|Velocity and acceleration for nonuniform circular motion: the velocity vector is tangential to the orbit, but the acceleration vector is not radially inward because of its tangential component '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; that increases the rate of rotation: ''d''ω / ''dt'' = &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; / ''R''.]]

As a generalization of the uniform circular motion case, suppose the angular rate of rotation is not constant. The acceleration now has a tangential component, as shown the image at right. This case is used to demonstrate a derivation strategy based on a [[polar coordinate system]].

Let '''r'''(''t'') be a vector that describes the position of a [[point mass]] as a function of time. Since we are assuming [[circular motion]], let '''r'''(''t'') = ''R''·'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''R'' is a constant (the radius of the circle) and '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[unit vector]] pointing from the origin to the point mass. The direction of '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is described by ''θ'', the angle between the x-axis and the unit vector, measured counterclockwise from the x-axis. The other unit vector for polar coordinates, '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; is perpendicular to '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; and points in the direction of increasing ''θ''. These polar unit vectors can be expressed in terms of [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] unit vectors in the ''x'' and ''y'' directions, denoted '''i''' and '''j''' respectively:&lt;ref&gt;Note: unlike the Cartesian unit vectors '''i''' and '''j''', which are constant, in [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] the direction of the unit vectors '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;'''r'''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;'''θ'''&lt;/sub&gt; depend on ''θ'', and so in general have non-zero time derivatives.&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = cos''θ'' '''i''' + sin''θ'' '''j'''

and

: '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; = -sin''θ'' '''i''' + cos''θ'' '''j'''.

One can differentiate to find velocity:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = r \frac {\mathrm{d} \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{r}}{\mathrm{d}t} = r \frac {\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left( \mathrm{cos}\ \theta \ \mathbf{i} + \mathrm{sin}\ \theta \ \mathbf{j}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; = r \frac {d \theta} {dt} \left( -\mathrm{sin}\ \theta \ \mathbf{i} + \mathrm{cos}\ \theta \ \mathbf{j}\right)\, &lt;/math&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt; = r \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{\theta} \, &lt;/math&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt; = \omega r \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{\theta} \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''ω'' is the angular velocity d''θ''/d''t''.

This result for the velocity matches expectations that the velocity should be directed tangentially to the circle, and that the magnitude of the velocity should be ''rω''. Differentiating again, and noting that

: &lt;math&gt;{\frac {\mathrm{d}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{\theta}}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{r} = - \omega \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{r}} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

we find that the acceleration, '''a''' is:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = r \left( \frac {\mathrm{d}\omega}{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{\theta} - \omega^2 \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{r} \right) \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the radial and tangential components of the acceleration are:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{r}} = - \omega^{2} r \ \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{r} = - \frac{|\mathbf{v}|^{2}}{r} \ \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{r} \ &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{\theta}} = r \ \frac {\mathrm{d}\omega}{\mathrm{d}t} \ \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{\theta} = \frac {\mathrm{d} | \mathbf{v} | }{\mathrm{d}t} \ \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{\theta} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where |'''v'''| = ''r'' ω is the magnitude of the velocity (the speed).

These equations express mathematically that, in the case of an object that moves along a circular path with a changing speed, the acceleration of the body may be decomposed into a [[perpendicular component]] that changes the direction of motion (the centripetal acceleration), and a parallel, or [[tangential component]], that changes the speed.

Their rotation in time ''dt'' is ''d''θ, just the same angle as the rotation of the trajectory '''r''' ( ''t'' ).]]

==== Polar coordinates ====
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2009}}

The above results can be derived perhaps more simply in [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]], and at the same time extended to general motion within a plane, as shown next. Polar coordinates in the plane employ a radial unit vector '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; and an angular unit vector '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;, as shown above.&lt;ref name = polar&gt;Although the polar coordinate system moves with the particle, the observer does not. The description of the particle motion remains a description from the stationary observer's point of view.&lt;/ref&gt; A particle at position '''r''' is described by:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = \rho \mathbf{u}_{\rho} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where the notation ''ρ'' is used to describe the distance of the path from the origin instead of ''R'' to emphasize that this distance is not fixed, but varies with time. The unit vector '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; travels with the particle and always points in the same direction as '''r'''(''t''). Unit vector '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; also travels with the particle and stays orthogonal to '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; and '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; form a local Cartesian coordinate system attached to the particle, and tied to the path traveled by the particle.&lt;ref&gt;Notice that this local coordinate system is not autonomous; for example, its rotation in time is dictated by the trajectory traced by the particle. Note also that the radial vector '''r'''(''t'') does not represent the [[Osculating circle|radius of curvature]] of the path.&lt;/ref&gt; By moving the unit vectors so their tails coincide, as seen in the circle at the left of the image above, it is seen that '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; and '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; form a right-angled pair with tips on the unit circle that trace back and forth on the perimeter of this circle with the same angle ''θ''(''t'') as '''r'''(''t'').

When the particle moves, its velocity is

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = \frac {\mathrm{d} \rho }{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{u}_{\rho} + \rho \frac {\mathrm{d} \mathbf{u}_{\rho}}{\mathrm{d}t} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

To evaluate the velocity, the derivative of the unit vector '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; is needed. Because '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; is a unit vector, its magnitude is fixed, and it can change only in direction, that is, its change d'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; has a component only perpendicular to '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt;. When the trajectory '''r'''(''t'') rotates an amount d''θ'', '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt;, which points in the same direction as '''r'''(''t''), also rotates by d''θ''. See image above. Therefore, the change in '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d} \mathbf{u}_{\rho} = \mathbf{u}_{\theta} \mathrm{d}\theta \ , &lt;/math&gt;

or

: &lt;math&gt; \frac {\mathrm{d} \mathbf{u}_{\rho}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{u}_{\theta} \frac {\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

In a similar fashion, the rate of change of '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; is found. As with '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt;, '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; is a unit vector and can only rotate without changing size. To remain orthogonal to '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; while the trajectory '''r'''(''t'') rotates an amount d''θ'', '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;, which is orthogonal to '''r'''(''t''), also rotates by d''θ''. See image above. Therefore, the change d'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; is orthogonal to '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; and proportional to d''θ'' (see image above):

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{u}_{\theta}}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac {\mathrm{d} \theta} {\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{u}_{\rho} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

The image above shows the sign to be negative: to maintain orthogonality, if d'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; is positive with d''θ'', then d'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; must decrease.

Substituting the derivative of '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; into the expression for velocity:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = \frac {\mathrm{d} \rho }{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{u}_{\rho} + \rho \mathbf{u}_{\theta} \frac {\mathrm{d} \theta} {\mathrm{d}t} = v_{\rho} \mathbf{u}_{\rho} + v_{\theta} \mathbf{u}_{\theta} = \mathbf{v}_{\rho} + \mathbf{v}_{\theta} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

To obtain the acceleration, another time differentiation is done:
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} = \frac {\mathrm{d}^2 \rho }{\mathrm{d}t^2} \mathbf{u}_{\rho} + \frac {\mathrm{d} \rho }{\mathrm{d}t} \frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{u}_{\rho}}{\mathrm{d}t} + \frac {\mathrm{d} \rho}{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{u}_{\theta} \frac {\mathrm{d} \theta} {\mathrm{d}t} + \rho \frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{u}_{\theta}}{\mathrm{d}t} \frac {\mathrm{d} \theta} {\mathrm{d}t} + \rho \mathbf{u}_{\theta} \frac {\mathrm{d}^2 \theta} {\mathrm{d}t^2} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the derivatives of '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; and '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;, the acceleration of the particle is:&lt;ref name = Taylor&gt;{{cite book |title = Classical Mechanics |author = John Robert Taylor |pages = 28–29 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=P1kCtNr-pJsC&amp;printsec=index&amp;dq=isbn=189138922X

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} = \frac {\mathrm{d}^2 \rho }{\mathrm{d}t^2} \mathbf{u}_{\rho} + 2\frac {\mathrm{d} \rho}{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{u}_{\theta} \frac {\mathrm{d} \theta} {\mathrm{d}t}-\rho \mathbf{u}_{\rho}\left( \frac {\mathrm{d} \theta} {\mathrm{d}t}\right)^2 + \rho \mathbf{u}_{\theta} \frac {\mathrm{d}^2 \theta} {\mathrm{d}t^2} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; = \mathbf{u}_{\rho} \left[ \frac {\mathrm{d}^2 \rho }{\mathrm{d}t^2}-\rho\left( \frac {\mathrm{d} \theta} {\mathrm{d}t}\right)^2 \right] + \mathbf{u}_{\theta}\left[ 2\frac {\mathrm{d} \rho}{\mathrm{d}t} \frac {\mathrm{d} \theta} {\mathrm{d}t} + \rho \frac {\mathrm{d}^2 \theta} {\mathrm{d}t^2}\right] \ &lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; = \mathbf{u}_{\rho} \left[ \frac {\mathrm{d}v_{\rho}}{\mathrm{d}t}-\frac{v_{\theta}^2}{\rho}\right] + \mathbf{u}_{\theta}\left[ \frac{2}{\rho}v_{\rho} v_{\theta} + \rho\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{v_{\theta}}{\rho}\right] \ .&lt;/math&gt;

As a particular example, if the particle moves in a circle of constant radius ''R'', then d''ρ''/d''t'' = 0, '''v''' = '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;, and:

:: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{u}_{\rho} \left[ -\rho\left( \frac {\mathrm{d} \theta} {\mathrm{d}t}\right)^2 \right] + \mathbf{u}_{\theta}\left[ \rho \frac {\mathrm{d}^2 \theta} {\mathrm{d}t^2}\right] \ &lt;/math&gt;
::: &lt;math&gt; = \mathbf{u}_{\rho} \left[ -\frac{v^2}{r}\right] + \mathbf{u}_{\theta}\left[ \frac {\mathrm{d} v} {\mathrm{d}t}\right] \ &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; v = v_{\theta}. &lt;/math&gt;

These results agree with those above for [[Centripetal force#Nonuniform circular motion|nonuniform circular motion]]. See also the article on [[non-uniform circular motion]]. If this acceleration is multiplied by the particle mass, the leading term is the centripetal force and the negative of the second term related to angular acceleration is sometimes called the [[Euler force]].&lt;ref name = Lanczos&gt;{{cite book |author = Cornelius Lanczos |title = The Variational Principles of Mechanics |url = https://books.google.com/?id=ZWoYYr8wk2IC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=%22Euler+force%22

For trajectories other than circular motion, for example, the more general trajectory envisioned in the image above, the instantaneous center of rotation and radius of curvature of the trajectory are related only indirectly to the coordinate system defined by '''u&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''u&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;''' and to the length |'''r'''(''t'')| = ''ρ''. Consequently, in the general case, it is not straightforward to disentangle the centripetal and Euler terms from the above general acceleration equation.&lt;ref name = Curtis&gt;See, for example, {{cite book |title = Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students |author = Howard D.

==== Local coordinates ====

[[File:Local unit vectors.PNG|thumb |Local coordinate system for planar motion on a curve. Two different positions are shown for distances ''s'' and ''s'' + ''ds'' along the curve. At each position ''s'', unit vector '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; points along the outward normal to the curve and unit vector '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; is tangential to the path. The radius of curvature of the path is ρ as found from the rate of rotation of the tangent to the curve with respect to arc length, and is the radius of the [[osculating circle]] at position ''s''.

Local coordinates mean a set of coordinates that travel with the particle,&lt;ref name = observer&gt;The ''observer'' of the motion along the curve is using these local coordinates to describe the motion from the observer's ''frame of reference'', that is, from a stationary point of view. In other words, although the local coordinate system moves with the particle, the observer does not. A change in coordinate system used by the observer is only a change in their ''description'' of observations, and does not mean that the observer has changed their state of motion, and ''vice versa''.&lt;/ref&gt; and have orientation determined by the path of the particle.&lt;ref name = Ito&gt;{{cite book |title = The immersed interface method: numerical solutions of PDEs involving interfaces and irregular domains |author1=Zhilin Li |author2=Kazufumi Ito |page = 16 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=_E084AX-iO8C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=%22local+coordinates%22

Distance along the path of the particle is the arc length ''s'', considered to be a known function of time.

: &lt;math&gt; s = s(t) \ . &lt;/math&gt;

A center of curvature is defined at each position ''s'' located a distance ''ρ'' (the [[Osculating circle#Mathematical description|radius of curvature]]) from the curve on a line along the normal '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (''s''). The required distance ''ρ''(''s'') at arc length ''s'' is defined in terms of the rate of rotation of the tangent to the curve, which in turn is determined by the path itself. If the orientation of the tangent relative to some starting position is ''θ''(''s''), then ''ρ''(''s'') is defined by the derivative d''θ''/d''s'':

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1} {\rho (s)} = \kappa (s) = \frac {\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}s}\ . &lt;/math&gt;

The radius of curvature usually is taken as positive (that is, as an absolute value), while the ''[[Curvature#Local expressions|curvature]]'' ''κ'' is a signed quantity.

A geometric approach to finding the center of curvature and the radius of curvature uses a limiting process leading to the [[osculating circle]].&lt;ref name = osculating&gt;The osculating circle at a given point ''P'' on a curve is the limiting circle of a sequence of circles that pass through ''P'' and two other points on the curve, ''Q'' and ''R'', on either side of ''P'', as ''Q'' and ''R'' approach ''P''.

Using these coordinates, the motion along the path is viewed as a succession of circular paths of ever-changing center, and at each position ''s'' constitutes [[non-uniform circular motion]] at that position with radius ''ρ''. The local value of the angular rate of rotation then is given by:

: &lt;math&gt; \omega(s) = \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}s} \frac {\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{\rho(s)}\ \frac {\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{v(s)}{\rho(s)}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;
with the local speed ''v'' given by:

: &lt;math&gt; v(s) = \frac {\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}t}\ . &lt;/math&gt;

As for the other examples above, because unit vectors cannot change magnitude, their rate of change is always perpendicular to their direction (see the left-hand insert in the image above):&lt;ref name = Gregory&gt;{{cite book |title = Classical Mechanics: An Undergraduate Text |author = R.

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{n}(s)}{ds} = \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s)\frac{d\theta}{ds} = \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s)\frac{1}{\rho} \ ; &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s)}{\mathrm{d}s} = -\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{n}(s)\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}s} = - \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{n}(s)\frac{1}{\rho} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

===== Alternative approach =====

Looking at the image above, one might wonder whether adequate account has been taken of the difference in curvature between ''ρ''(''s'') and ''ρ''(''s'' + d''s'') in computing the arc length as d''s'' = ''ρ''(''s'')d''θ''. Reassurance on this point can be found using a more formal approach outlined below. This approach also makes connection with the article on [[Curvature#Local expressions|curvature]].

To introduce the unit vectors of the local coordinate system, one approach is to begin in Cartesian coordinates and describe the local coordinates in terms of these Cartesian coordinates. In terms of arc length ''s'', let the path be described as:&lt;ref name = curvature&gt;The article on [[curvature]] treats a more general case where the curve is parametrized by an arbitrary variable (denoted ''t''), rather than by the arc length ''s''.&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}(s) = \left[ x(s),\ y(s) \right] \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Then an incremental displacement along the path d''s'' is described by:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}(s) = \left[ \mathrm{d}x(s),\ \mathrm{d}y(s) \right] = \left[ x'(s),\ y'(s) \right] \mathrm{d}s \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where primes are introduced to denote derivatives with respect to ''s''. The magnitude of this displacement is d''s'', showing that:&lt;ref name = Shabana&gt;{{cite book |title = Railroad Vehicle Dynamics: A Computational Approach |author1=Ahmed A. Shabana |author2=Khaled E. Zaazaa |author3=Hiroyuki Sugiyama |page = 91 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=YgIDSQT0FaUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA207&amp;dq=%22generalized+coordinate%22
|isbn = 978-1-4200-4581-9 |publisher = CRC Press |year = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\left[ x'(s)^2 + y'(s)^2 \right] = 1 \ . &lt;/math&gt; {{anchor|Eq. 1}}(Eq. 1)

This displacement is necessarily a tangent to the curve at ''s'', showing that the unit vector tangent to the curve is:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s) = \left[ x'(s), \ y'(s) \right] \ , &lt;/math&gt;

while the outward unit vector normal to the curve is
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{n}(s) = \left[ y'(s),\ -x'(s) \right] \ , &lt;/math&gt;

[[Orthogonality]] can be verified by showing that the vector [[dot product]] is zero. The unit magnitude of these vectors is a consequence of [[#Eq. 1|Eq. 1]]. Using the tangent vector, the angle ''θ'' of the tangent to the curve is given by:
: &lt;math&gt;\sin \theta = \frac{y'(s)}{\sqrt{x'(s)^2 + y'(s)^2}} = y'(s) \ ;&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta = \frac{x'(s)}{\sqrt{x'(s)^2 + y'(s)^2}} = x'(s) \ .&lt;/math&gt;

The radius of curvature is introduced completely formally (without need for geometric interpretation) as:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\rho} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}s}\ . &lt;/math&gt;

The derivative of ''θ'' can be found from that for sin''θ'':
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d} \sin\theta}{\mathrm{d}s} = \cos \theta \frac {\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}s} = \frac{1}{\rho} \cos \theta \ = \frac{1}{\rho} x'(s)\ . &lt;/math&gt;

Now:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d} \sin \theta }{\mathrm{d}s} = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}s} \frac{y'(s)}{\sqrt{x'(s)^2 + y'(s)^2}}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; = \frac{y''(s)x'(s)^2-y'(s)x'(s)x''(s)} {\left(x'(s)^2 + y'(s)^2\right)^{3/2}}\ , &lt;/math&gt;

in which the denominator is unity. With this formula for the derivative of the sine, the radius of curvature becomes:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac {\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}s} = \frac{1}{\rho} = y''(s)x'(s) - y'(s)x''(s)\ &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; = \frac{y''(s)}{x'(s)} = -\frac{x''(s)}{y'(s)} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

where the equivalence of the forms stems from differentiation of [[#Eq. 1|Eq. 1]]:
: &lt;math&gt;x'(s)x''(s) + y'(s)y''(s) = 0 \ . &lt;/math&gt;
With these results, the acceleration can be found:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}(s) = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\mathbf{v}(s) &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left[\frac{\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}t} \left( x'(s), \ y'(s) \right) \right]\ &lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; = \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}^2s}{\mathrm{d}t^2}\right)\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s) + \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}t}\right) ^2 \left(x''(s),\ y''(s) \right) &lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; = \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}^2s}{\mathrm{d}t^2}\right)\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s) - \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}t}\right) ^2 \frac{1}{\rho} \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{n}(s) \ , &lt;/math&gt;
as can be verified by taking the dot product with the unit vectors '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') and '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(''s''). This result for acceleration is the same as that for circular motion based on the radius ''ρ''. Using this coordinate system in the inertial frame, it is easy to identify the force normal to the trajectory as the centripetal force and that parallel to the trajectory as the tangential force. From a qualitative standpoint, the path can be approximated by an arc of a circle for a limited time, and for the limited time a particular radius of curvature applies, the centrifugal and Euler forces can be analyzed on the basis of circular motion with that radius.

This result for acceleration agrees with that found earlier. However, in this approach, the question of the change in radius of curvature with ''s'' is handled completely formally, consistent with a geometric interpretation, but not relying upon it, thereby avoiding any questions the image above might suggest about neglecting the variation in ''ρ''.

===== Example: circular motion =====
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}

To illustrate the above formulas, let ''x'', ''y'' be given as:
: &lt;math&gt;x = \alpha \cos \frac{s}{\alpha} \ ; \ y = \alpha \sin\frac{s}{\alpha} \ .&lt;/math&gt;

Then:
: &lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 = \alpha^2 \ , &lt;/math&gt;

which can be recognized as a circular path around the origin with radius ''α''. The position ''s'' = 0 corresponds to [''α'', 0], or 3 o'clock. To use the above formalism, the derivatives are needed:

: &lt;math&gt;y^{\prime}(s) = \cos \frac{s}{\alpha} \ ; \ x^{\prime}(s) = -\sin \frac{s}{\alpha} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y^{\prime\prime}(s) = -\frac{1}{\alpha}\sin\frac{s}{\alpha} \ ; \ x^{\prime\prime}(s) = -\frac{1}{\alpha}\cos \frac{s}{\alpha} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

With these results, one can verify that:
: &lt;math&gt; x^{\prime}(s)^2 + y^{\prime}(s)^2 = 1 \ ; \ \frac{1}{\rho} = y^{\prime\prime}(s)x^{\prime}(s)-y^{\prime}(s)x^{\prime\prime}(s) = \frac{1}{\alpha} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

The unit vectors can also be found:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s) = \left[-\sin\frac{s}{\alpha} \ , \ \cos\frac{s}{\alpha} \right] \ ; \ \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{n}(s) = \left[\cos\frac{s}{\alpha} \ , \ \sin\frac{s}{\alpha} \right] \ , &lt;/math&gt;

which serve to show that ''s'' = 0 is located at position [''ρ'', 0] and ''s'' = ''ρ''π/2 at [0, ''ρ''], which agrees with the original expressions for ''x'' and ''y''. In other words, ''s'' is measured counterclockwise around the circle from 3 o'clock. Also, the derivatives of these vectors can be found:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}s}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s) = -\frac{1}{\alpha} \left[\cos\frac{s}{\alpha} \ , \ \sin\frac{s}{\alpha} \right] = -\frac{1}{\alpha}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{n}(s) \ ; &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}s}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{n}(s) = \frac{1}{\alpha} \left[-\sin\frac{s}{\alpha} \ , \ \cos\frac{s}{\alpha} \right] = \frac{1}{\alpha}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s) \ . &lt;/math&gt;

To obtain velocity and acceleration, a time-dependence for ''s'' is necessary. For counterclockwise motion at variable speed ''v''(''t''):
: &lt;math&gt;s(t) = \int_0^t \ dt^{\prime} \ v(t^{\prime}) \ , &lt;/math&gt;
where ''v''(''t'') is the speed and ''t'' is time, and ''s''(''t'' = 0) = 0. Then:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = v(t)\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s) \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s) + v\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s) = \frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s)-v\frac{1}{\alpha}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{n}(s)\frac{\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}t} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s)-\frac{v^2}{\alpha}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{n}(s) \ , &lt;/math&gt;
where it already is established that α = ρ. This acceleration is the standard result for [[non-uniform circular motion]].

[[Image:B-H loop.png|thumb|A family of hysteresis loops for grain-oriented electrical steel. ''B''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; denotes ''[[retentivity]]'' and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''coercivity''.  The wider the outside loop is, the higher the coercivity. Movement on the loops is counterclockwise.]]

In [[electrical engineering]] and [[materials science]], the '''coercivity''', also called the '''magnetic coercivity''', '''coercive field''' or '''coercive force''', is a measure of the ability of a [[ferromagnetic]] material to withstand an external [[magnetic field]] without becoming [[Magnetization|demagnetized]].  An analogous property, '''electric coercivity''', is the ability of a [[ferroelectric]] material to withstand an external [[electric field]] without becoming [[polarization density|depolarized]].

For [[ferromagnet|ferromagnetic material]] the coercivity is the intensity of the applied [[magnetic field]] required to reduce the [[magnetization]] of that material to zero ''after'' the magnetization of the sample has been driven to [[saturation (magnetic)|saturation]]. Thus coercivity measures the resistance of a ferromagnetic material to becoming demagnetized.  Coercivity is usually measured in [[oersted]] or [[ampere]]/meter units and is denoted ''H''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;.  It can be measured using a [[B-H analyzer]] or [[magnetometer]].

Ferromagnetic materials with high coercivity are called magnetically ''hard'' materials, and are used to make [[permanent magnet]]s.  Materials with low coercivity are said to be magnetically ''soft''.  The latter are used in  [[transformer]] and [[inductor]] [[magnetic core|cores]], [[recording head]]s, [[microwave]] devices, and [[magnetic shielding]].

Typically the coercivity of a magnetic material is determined by measurement of the [[magnetic hysteresis]] loop, also called the ''magnetization curve'', as illustrated in the figure. The apparatus used to acquire the data is typically a [[vibrating-sample magnetometer|vibrating-sample]] or alternating-gradient [[magnetometer]]. The applied field where the data line crosses zero is the coercivity. If an [[antiferromagnet]] is present in the sample, the coercivities measured in increasing and decreasing fields may be unequal as a result of the [[exchange bias]] effect.

The coercivity of a material depends on the time scale over which a magnetization curve is measured.  The magnetization of a material measured at an applied reversed field which is nominally smaller than the coercivity may, over a long time scale, slowly [[Relaxation (physics)|relax]] to zero.  Relaxation occurs when reversal of magnetization by domain wall motion is [[Arrhenius equation|thermally activated]] and is dominated by [[magnetic viscosity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gaunt|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing value of coercivity at high frequencies is a serious obstacle to the increase of [[Bit rate|data rates]] in high-[[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] magnetic recording, compounded by the fact that increased storage density typically requires a higher coercivity in the media.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
{{clear}}

==Theory==
[[Image:Coercivity.png|thumb|The coercivity is a horizontal intercept of the hysteresis loop.]]
At the coercive field, the [[vector (geometry)|vector component]] of the magnetization of a ferromagnet measured along the applied field direction is zero.  There are two primary modes of [[magnetization reversal]]: [[single domain (magnetic)|single-domain]] rotation and [[Domain wall (magnetism)|domain wall]] motion. When the magnetization of a material reverses by rotation, the magnetization component along the applied field is zero because the vector points in a direction orthogonal to the applied field. When the magnetization reverses by domain wall motion, the net magnetization is small in every vector direction because the moments of all the individual domains sum to zero.  Magnetization curves dominated by rotation and [[magnetocrystalline anisotropy]] are found in relatively perfect magnetic materials used in fundamental research.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Genish|Kats|Klein|Reiner|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domain wall motion is a more important reversal mechanism in real engineering materials since defects like [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]] and [[impurity|impurities]] serve as [[nucleation]] sites for reversed-magnetization domains.  The role of domain walls in determining coercivity is complicated since defects may ''pin'' domain walls in addition to nucleating them.  The dynamics of domain walls in ferromagnets is similar to that of grain boundaries and [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] in [[metallurgy]] since both domain walls and grain boundaries are planar defects.

==Significance==
As with any [[hysteresis|hysteretic]] process, the area inside the magnetization curve during one cycle represents the [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] that is performed on the material by the external field in reversing the magnetization, and is dissipated as heat. Common dissipative processes in magnetic materials include [[magnetostriction]] and domain wall motion. The coercivity is a measure of the degree of magnetic hysteresis and therefore characterizes the lossiness of soft magnetic materials for their common applications.

The ''squareness'' ([[Remanence|saturation remanence]] divided by [[saturation magnetization]]) and coercivity are figures of merit for hard magnets although ''energy product'' (saturation magnetization times coercivity) is most commonly quoted. The 1980s saw the development of [[rare-earth magnet]]s with high energy products but undesirably low [[Curie temperature]]s. Since the 1990s new [[exchange spring magnet|exchange spring]] hard magnets with high coercivities have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kneller|Hawig|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mount Storm Power Plant, Areial.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mount Storm Lake]] is a {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} cooling pond for a power plant in [[Grant County, West Virginia]].]]
A '''cooling pond''' is a man-made body of [[water]] primarily formed for the purpose storing heated water and/or supplying [[cooling water]] to a nearby [[power plant]] or industrial facility such as a [[petroleum refining|petroleum refinery]], [[pulp and paper mill]], [[chemical plant]], [[steel mill]] or [[smelter]].

==Overview==
Cooling ponds are used where sufficient land is available, as an alternative to [[cooling tower]]s or discharging of heated water to a nearby [[river]] or [[coastal waters|coastal bay]], a process known as “once-through cooling.” The latter process can cause [[thermal pollution]] of the receiving waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Environmental Science |last1=Mongillo |first1=John F. |last2=Zierdt-Warshaw |first2=Linda |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2000 |publisher=[[University of Rochester Press]] |location=Rochester, NY |isbn=978-1-57356-147-1 |page=93 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Water in Environmental Planning |last1=Dunne |first1=Thomas |last2=Leopold |first2=Luna B. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1978 |publisher=[[W.H.

The pond receives [[thermal energy]] in the water from the plant’s [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condensers]] during the process of energy production and the thermal energy is then dissipated mainly through [[evaporation]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

New water is added to the system (“make-up” water) to replace the water lost through evaporation.

A 1970 cooling pond research study done by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] stated cooling ponds as having a lower overall electrical cost than [[Cooling tower|cooling towers]] while providing the same benefits. They also concluded that a cooling pond will work optimally within 5 degrees Fahrenheit of natural water temperature with an area encompassing approximately 4 acres per megawatt of dissipated thermal energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springerreference_32156|work=SpringerReference|publisher=Springer-Verlag|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Lake Anna is a cooling pond in Virginia, which provides cooling water for the North Anna Nuclear Generating Station. This pond has recreational uses such as  fishing, swimming, boating, camping, and picnicking as well as being a cooling pond for the nuclear plant. Chernobyl's cooling pond has abundant wildlife, despite the radiation present in the area. Some accounts of wels catfish ''(Silurus glanis)'' growing up to 350 pounds and having a lifespan of up to 50 years in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.earthtouchnews.com/wtf/wtf/yes-there-are-giant-catfish-in-chernobyls-cooling-pond-but-theyre-not-radiation-mutants/|title=Yes, there are giant catfish in Chernobyl's cooling pond – but they're not radiation mutants|work=Earth Touch News Network|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Columbia station in Pardeeville, Wisconsin is a coal fired power plant with a capacity of 1000 MW. A duel cooling system is used for heat rejection that consists of a cooling pond and two cooling towers. The pond and towers are connected in a parallel arrangement to help dissipate thermal energy at expedited rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Joerg |first=Kirchhoff |date=1995|title=Optimized Combination of a Cooling Pond and Cooling Tower System for Condenser Cooling at a Steam Cycle Power Plant |url=https://minds.wisconsin.edu/handle/1793/7801|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |

'''1,1,1,2-tetrafluorodisulfane''', also known as '''1,2-difluorodisulfane 1,1-difluoride''' or just difluorodisulfanedifluoride ('''FSSF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''') is an unstable molecular compound of [[fluorine]] and [[sulfur]]. The molecule has a pair of sulfur atoms, with one fluorine atom on one sulfur, and three fluorine atoms on the other. It has the uncommon property that all the [[bond length]]s are different.&lt;ref name=Lind&gt;{{cite thesis|last1=Lindquist|first1=Beth Anne|title=insights into the chemistry of sulfur-containing molecules|url=https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/49568/Beth_Lindquist.pdf?sequence=1|location=Urbana, Illinois|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[bond strength]] is not correlated with [[bond length]] but is inversely correlated with the [[force constant]] ([[Badger's rule]]).&lt;ref name=Lind/&gt; The molecule can be considered as [[sulfur tetrafluoride]] in which a sulfur atom is inserted into a S-F bond.&lt;ref name=Lind/&gt;

Atoms are labelled with the sulfur atom connected to three fluorine atoms as S&lt;sub&gt;''hyp''&lt;/sub&gt; (for hypervalent) and S&lt;sub&gt;''top''&lt;/sub&gt;. The fluorine atoms are labelled F&lt;sub&gt;''top''&lt;/sub&gt; attached to S&lt;sub&gt;''top''&lt;/sub&gt;, and on the hypervalent S atom: F&lt;sub&gt;''cis''&lt;/sub&gt;, the closest F atom to F&lt;sub&gt;''top''&lt;/sub&gt;, F&lt;sub&gt;''trans''&lt;/sub&gt; the furthest away F atom from F&lt;sub&gt;''top''&lt;/sub&gt;, and F&lt;sub&gt;''eq''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name=Lind/&gt;

F&lt;sub&gt;''eq''&lt;/sub&gt; is 90° from F&lt;sub&gt;''trans''&lt;/sub&gt;, and 84° from F&lt;sub&gt;''cis''&lt;/sub&gt;, and the torsion compared to F&lt;sub&gt;''top''&lt;/sub&gt; is about 95°.&lt;ref name=recal/&gt;

==Reactions==
The dimerization reaction 2SF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} FSSF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is reversible.&lt;ref name=seel/&gt; It also disproportionates: SF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + FSSF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → FSSF + SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=seel/&gt; A side reaction also produces the intermediate F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SSSF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Losking|first1=O.|last2=Willner|first2=H.|title=Lower sulfur fluorides|volume=16|pages=140–141|doi=10.1016/S0065-2792(08)60294-0|series=Advances in Inorganic Chemistry and Radiochemistry|year=1974|isbn=9780120236169}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hydrogen fluoride]] catalyses disproportionation to sulfur and sulfur tetrafluoride by forming a reactive intermediate HSF molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seel|first1=F.|last2=Stein|first2=R.|title=Darstellung des 1,2-difluordisulfan-1,1-difluorids aus difluordisulfan in einer glimmentladung|journal=Journal of Fluorine Chemistry|date=October 1979|volume=14|issue=4|pages=339–346|language=de|doi=10.1016/S0022-1139(00)82977-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When FSSF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; dissociates, the F&lt;sub&gt;''cis''&lt;/sub&gt; atom forms a new bond to the S&lt;sub&gt;''top''&lt;/sub&gt; atom, and the S-S bond breaks.&lt;ref name=Lind/&gt;
As a gas, at ambient and totally clean conditions, FSSF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; decomposes with a half life of about 10 hours. Disproportionation to SSF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; catalysed by metal fluorides can take place in under one second. However it is indefinitely stable at -196&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=recal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carlowitz|first1=Michael V.|last2=Oberhammer|first2=Heinz|last3=Willner|first3=Helge|last4=Boggs|first4=James E.|title=Structural determination of a recalcitrant molecule (S2F4)|journal=Journal of Molecular Structure|date=July 1983|volume=100|pages=161–177|doi=10.1016/0022-2860(83)90090-X|bibcode=1983JMoSt.100..161C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A symmetrical molecule F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SSF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is calculated to be 15.1&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol higher in energy than FSSF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Lind/&gt;

FSSF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is easily hydrolysed with water.&lt;ref name="seel74"/&gt;

FSSF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; spontaneously reacts with oxygen gas to make [[thionyl fluoride]], the only sulfur fluoride that does not need any assistance to do this.&lt;ref name="seel74"/&gt;
FSSF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with copper at high temperatures producing copper fluoride and copper sulfide.&lt;ref name="seel74"/&gt;

==Formation==
SF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SF can be made in the laboratory when low pressure (10mm) [[sulfur dichloride|SCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] vapour is passed over [[potassium fluoride]] or [[mercuric fluoride]] heated to 150&amp;nbsp;°C. Byproducts include FSSF, SSF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, SF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SCl, and FSSCl.&lt;ref name="seel74"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seel|first1=F.|title=Lower Sulfur Fluorides|journal=Advances in Inorganic Chemistry and Radiochemistry|date=1974|volume=16|pages=297–333|doi=10.1016/S0065-2792(08)60294-0|series=Advances in Inorganic Chemistry and Radiochemistry|isbn=9780120236169}}&lt;/ref&gt; SF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SCl can be removed from this mixture in a reaction with mercury.&lt;ref name="seel74"/&gt; Separation of the sulfur fluorides can be achieved by low temperature distillation. SF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SF distills just above -50&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seel|first1=F.|last2=Roth|first2=J.|title=Untersuchung von Schwefel-Fluor-Verbindungen durch Codestillation und Cosublimation im Cady-Rohr|journal=Fresenius' Zeitschrift für analytische Chemie|date=1984|volume=319|issue=8|pages=910–914|language=de|doi=10.1007/BF00487070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SF is also made in small amounts by reacting sulfur with [[silver fluoride]], or photolysis of [[disulfur difluoride]] and SSF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="seel74"/&gt;
The molecule is formed by the dimerization of [[sulfur difluoride]].&lt;ref name=Lind/&gt;

==Properties==
The [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectrum of FSSF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; shows four bands, each of eight lines at  -53.2, -5.7, 26.3 and 204.1&amp;nbsp;ppm.&lt;ref name=seel/&gt;

FSSF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is stable as a solid, as a liquid below -74&amp;nbsp;°C and dissolved in other sulfur fluoride liquids.&lt;ref name="seel74"/&gt; This is in contrast to SF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which is only stable as a dilute gas.&lt;ref name="seel74"/&gt;

Infrared vibration bands for FSSF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are at 810, 678, 530, 725, and 618(S-S) cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="seel74"/&gt;

The related compound FSSSF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has a similar structure. Thiothionyltetrafluoride, S=SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; may exist as a gas. It is less energetically favourable to FSSF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; by 37&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, but has a high energy barrier of 267&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol.&lt;ref name=yana&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steudel|first1=Yana|last2=Steudel|first2=Ralf|last3=Wong|first3=Ming Wah|last4=Lentz|first4=Dieter|title=An ab initio MO Study of the Gas-Phase Reactions 2 SF2 → FS−SF3 → S=SF4 − Molecular Structures, Reaction Enthalpies and Activation Energies|journal=European Journal of Inorganic Chemistry|date=September 2001|volume=2001|issue=10|pages=2543–2548|doi=10.1002/1099-0682(200109)2001:10&lt;2543::AID-EJIC2543&gt;3.0.CO;2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it may disproportionate rapidly to sulfur and sulfur tetrafluoride.&lt;ref name=yana/&gt; The other known sulfur fluorides are [[sulfur difluoride]], [[sulfur tetrafluoride]], [[sulfur hexafluoride]], [[disulfur decafluoride]], [[disulfur difluoride]] and [[1,1-difluorodisulfane]], [[difluorotrisulfane]], and [[difluorotetrasulfane]].&lt;ref name=yana/&gt; The F&lt;sub&gt;''top''&lt;/sub&gt; atom can be substituted with Cl to yield ClSSF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluorodisulfane).&lt;ref name=seel&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seel|first1=Fritz|last2=Budenz|first2=Rudolf|last3=Gombler|first3=Willy|title=1.2-Difluor-disulfan-1.1-difluorid und 1-Fluor-2-chlor-disulfan-1.1-difluorid|journal=Chemische Berichte|date=June 1970|volume=103|issue=6|pages=1701–1708|doi=10.1002/cber.19701030606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8965">'''Faith McNulty''' (November 28, 1918 – April 10, 2005) was an [[United States|American]] [[non-fiction]] author, probably best known for her 1980 literary journalism genre book ''[[The Burning Bed]]''. She is also known for her authorship of wildlife pieces and books, including children's books.

Faith Trumbull Corrigan was born in [[New York City]],&lt;ref name=NYSLTree/&gt; the daughter of a judge. She attended [[Barnard College]] for one year,&lt;ref name=NYSLTree/&gt; then attended [[Rhode Island State College]]. But she dropped out of college once she got a job as a copy girl at the ''[[New York Daily News]]''. She later went to work for [[Life magazine|''Life'' magazine]]. She worked for the U.S. [[Office of War Information]] in [[London]] during [[World War II]].

McNulty was a staff writer at ''[[The New Yorker]]'' [[magazine]] from 1953 to 1994.&lt;ref name=NYSLTree/&gt; In 1980, a collection of her ''New Yorker'' work was published as ''The Wildlife Stories of Faith McNulty''.&lt;ref name=NYSLTree/&gt; For many years, she edited the annual ''New Yorker'' compilation of the year's best children's books.

She also frequently wrote [[children's literature|children's books]] on wildlife, including ''How to Dig a Hole to the Other Side of the World'' in 1979 and ''When I Lived With Bats'' in 1998. Her 1966 book ''The Whooping Crane: The Bird that Defies Distinction'' was written for adults.

Her husband, [[John McNulty (journalist)|John McNulty]], was also a writer&lt;ref name=NYSLTree/&gt; for ''The New Yorker'' and with [[Thomas Wolfe]], [[Truman Capote]], [[Gay Talese]] and [[James Baldwin]], a major figure in the development of the literary genre of [[Creative nonfiction]], which is also known as [[literary journalism]] or literature in fact. As earlier here noted, having herself been years exposed to [[Harold Ross]]' New Yorker magazine's rarefied environment, which was then so promoting of this evolving genre, Faith's own major nonfiction work, ''The Burning Bed'', is, itself, a quintessential and quality example of the genre of literary journalism or, as Thomas Wolfe once labeled it, the “[[New Journalism]]”.  After her husband John died in 1956, Faith remarried, to Richard Martin, a set designer and an inventive designer of set props.

''The Burning Bed'' told the true story of Francine Hughes, who set fire to the bedroom in which her husband was sleeping. Hughes defended herself by saying that her husband had been [[domestic abuse|abusing]] her for 13 years. The jury at her trial ruled that she had been temporarily insane, and she was found not guilty.

Faith had fonder memories of life with kinder family, however. ''"I can remember my father in his nightshirt, digging for worms for the baby robin in the bathroom. That's the kind of household it was; I had [[woodchuck]]s in the bathroom, [[cat]]s, [[squirrel]]s, [[chipmunk]]s"'', McNulty once said.

Towards the end of her life, she wrote a weekly column for ''[[The Providence Journal]]'' on a local [[animal shelter]] run by the [[Animal Welfare League]]. Her mother had founded the Animal Welfare League in southern [[Rhode Island]]. McNulty had long been known for taking in stray animals at her farm.

She suffered a stroke in 2004. She died at her farm in [[Wakefield, Rhode Island]].

McNulty's last book was illustrated by [[Steven Kellogg]] and published by [[Scholastic Books]] in 2005, ''If You Decide to Go to the Moon''—a picture book written in the second person.&lt;ref name=LCC/&gt; Next year (after McNulty's death) it won a major "year's best" children's literary award, the [[Boston Globe–Horn Book Award]] for Nonfiction.&lt;ref name=bghb2011/&gt;

      <comment>/* Lighthouse lens sizes */Changed descrpt for image from "third" to "fourth" order as it appeared much too small to be third (compared to light assy. next to it). Japanese wiki repeatedly refers to the image and lighthouse as a fourth. Re-ordered images to place btwn 3rd and 4th order.

A '''Fresnel lens''' ({{IPAc-en|'|f|r|ɛ|z|n|əl}} {{respell|FREZ|nəl}} or {{IPAc-en|f|r|eɪ|ˈ|n|ɛ|l}} {{respell|fray|NEL|'}}) is a type of compact [[lens (optics)|lens]] originally developed by [[French physicist]] [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] for [[lighthouse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fresnel%20lens |title=Fresnel lens |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |accessdate=19 March 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217120005/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fresnel%20lens |archivedate=17 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design allows the construction of lenses of large [[aperture]] and short [[focal length]] without the mass and volume of material that would be required by a lens of conventional design.  A Fresnel lens can be made much thinner than a comparable conventional lens, in some cases taking the form of a flat sheet. A Fresnel lens can capture more oblique light from a light source, thus allowing the light from a lighthouse equipped with one to be visible over greater distances.

==History==
The idea of creating a thinner, lighter lens in the form of a series of annular steps is often attributed to [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9035385 |title=Fresnel lens |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |date=2012 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc |accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Buffon proposed grinding such a lens from a single piece of glass, the [[Marquis de Condorcet]] (1743–1794) proposed making it with separate sections mounted in a frame.&lt;ref name=appleton&gt;{{cite journal| title =Fresnel lens |work=[[Appleton's dictionary]] of machines, mechanics, engine-work, and engineering|volume=2  |location=New York |date=1874|page=609 |url =https://books.google.com/?id=ti9VAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA609 |publisher=D. Appleton and Co|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
French physicist and engineer [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] is most often given credit for the development of the multi-part lens for use in lighthouses.  According to ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]'' magazine, the first Fresnel lens was used in 1823 in the [[Cordouan lighthouse]] at the mouth of the [[Gironde estuary]]; its light could be seen from more than {{convert|20|mi|km}} out.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Bruce. "Science Makes a Better Lighthouse Lens." ''Smithsonian''. August 1999 v30 i5 p30.
produced in ''Biography Resource Center''. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Thomson Gale. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scottish physicist Sir [[David Brewster]] is credited with convincing the United Kingdom to adopt these lenses in their lighthouses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9016395 "Brewster, Sir David."] ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 2005.

[[File:Flat flexible plastic sheet lens.JPG|thumb|Close-up view of a flat Fresnel lens shows concentric circles on the surface]]

The Fresnel lens reduces the amount of material required compared to a conventional lens by dividing the lens into a set of concentric annular sections. An ideal Fresnel lens would have an infinite number of sections. In each section, the overall thickness is decreased compared to an equivalent simple lens. This effectively divides the continuous surface of a standard lens into a set of surfaces of the same curvature, with stepwise discontinuities between them.

In some lenses, the curved surfaces are replaced with flat surfaces, with a different angle in each section. Such a lens can be regarded as an array of prisms arranged in a circular fashion, with steeper prisms on the edges, and a flat or slightly convex center. In the first (and largest) Fresnel lenses, each section was actually a separate prism.  'Single-piece' Fresnel lenses were later produced, being used for automobile headlamps, brake, parking, and turn signal lenses, and so on.  In modern times, [[CNC|computer-controlled milling equipment (CNC)]] might be used to manufacture more complex lenses.

Fresnel lens design allows a substantial reduction in thickness (and thus mass and volume of material), at the expense of reducing the imaging quality of the lens, which is why precise imaging applications such as photography usually still use larger conventional lenses.

Fresnel lenses are usually made of glass or plastic; their size varies from large (old historical lighthouses, meter size) to medium (book-reading aids, OHP viewgraph projectors) to small ([[Twin-lens reflex camera|TLR]]/[[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] camera screens, micro-optics). In many cases they are very thin and flat, almost flexible, with thicknesses in the {{convert|1|to|5|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} range.

Modern Fresnel lenses usually consist of all refractive elements.  However many of the lighthouses have both refracting and reflecting elements, as shown in the photographs and diagram.  That is, the outer elements are sections of reflectors while the inner elements are sections of refractive lenses.  [[Total internal reflection]] was often used to avoid the light loss in reflection from a silvered mirror.

=== Lighthouse lens sizes ===
[[File:Makapuu point light.JPG|thumb|Makapuu Point Light]]
[[File:Cape Meares Lighthouse lens - Oregon.jpg|thumb|[[Cape Meares Lighthouse]]; first-order Fresnel lens]]
Fresnel produced six sizes of lighthouse lenses, divided into four ''orders'' based on their size and focal length.&lt;ref name=Baiges/&gt; In modern use, these are classified as first through sixth order. An intermediate size between third and fourth order was added later, as well as sizes above first order and below sixth.

A first-order lens has a focal length of 920&amp;nbsp;mm (36&amp;nbsp;in) and a maximum diameter 2590&amp;nbsp;mm (8.5&amp;nbsp;ft) high.  The complete assembly is about 3.7&amp;nbsp;m (12&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and 1.8&amp;nbsp;m (6&amp;nbsp;ft) wide.  The smallest (sixth-order) has a focal length of 150&amp;nbsp;mm (5.9&amp;nbsp;in) and an optical diameter 433&amp;nbsp;mm (17&amp;nbsp;in) high.&lt;ref name=Baiges&gt;{{cite web

The largest Fresnel lenses are called [[hyperradiant Fresnel lens]]es. One such lens was on hand when it was decided to build and outfit the [[Makapuu Point Light]] in Hawaii.  Rather than order a new lens, the huge optic construction, {{convert|12|ft|m|order=flip}} tall and with over a thousand prisms, was used there.&lt;ref name="LHF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=141|title=Makapu`u, HI|publisher=Anderson, Kraig.

==Types==
There are two main types of Fresnel lens: ''imaging'' and ''non-imaging''. Imaging Fresnel lenses use segments with curved cross-sections and produce sharp images, while non-imaging lenses have segments with flat cross-sections, and do not produce sharp images.&lt;ref&gt;''Nonimaging Optics'' by R. Winston, J. C. Miñano, and P. G. Benítez, (Academic, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  As the number of segments increases, the two types of lens become more similar to each other. In the abstract case of an infinite number of segments, the difference between curved and flat segments disappears.

===Imaging===
;Spherical: A spherical Fresnel lens is equivalent to a [[simple lens|simple]] [[spherical lens]], using ring-shaped segments that are each a portion of a sphere, that all focus light on a single point. This type of lens produces a sharp image, although not quite as clear as the equivalent simple spherical lens due to diffraction at the edges of the ridges.

;Cylindrical: A cylindrical Fresnel lens is equivalent to a simple [[cylindrical lens]], using straight segments with circular cross-section, focusing light on a single line.  This type produces a sharp image, although not quite as clear as the equivalent simple cylindrical lens due to diffraction at the edges of the ridges.

===Non-imaging===
;Spot: A non-imaging spot Fresnel lens uses ring-shaped segments with cross sections that are straight lines rather than circular arcs. Such a lens can focus light on a small spot, but does not produce a sharp image. These lenses have application in solar power, such as focusing sunlight on a solar panel.

[[File:SinclairFTV1fresnellens1.JPG|thumb|The Fresnel lens used in the [[TV80|Sinclair FTV1]] portable CRT TV, which enlarges the vertical aspect of the display only]]
Fresnel lenses are used as simple hand-held [[Magnifying glass|magnifiers]]. They are also used to correct several visual disorders, including ocular-motility disorders such as [[strabismus]]. Fresnel lenses have been used to increase the visual size of [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] displays in pocket [[television]]s, notably the [[Sinclair Research Ltd.|Sinclair]] [[TV80]]. They are also used in [[traffic light]]s.

Fresnel lenses are used in left-hand-drive European [[Lorry|lorries]] entering the UK and Republic of Ireland (and vice versa, right-hand-drive Irish and British trucks entering mainland Europe) to overcome the blind spots caused by the driver operating the lorry while sitting on the wrong side of the cab relative to the side of the road the car is on. They attach to the passenger-side window.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XG4du9fwEUYC&amp;lpg=PA321&amp;ots=Or4ojoSr80&amp;dq=vosa%20fresnel%20lenses&amp;pg=PA321#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Lowe's Transport Manager's and Operator's Handbook 2012|last=Lowe|first=David|date=2011-12-03|publisher=[[Kogan Page Publishers]]|year=|isbn=9780749464103|location=|pages=|language=en|quote=|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215093401/https://books.google.com/books?id=XG4du9fwEUYC&amp;lpg=PA321&amp;ots=Or4ojoSr80&amp;dq=vosa%20fresnel%20lenses&amp;pg=PA321#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=15 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another automobile application of a Fresnel lens is a rear view enhancer, as the [[Wide-angle lens|wide view angle]] of a lens attached to the rear window permits examining the scene behind a vehicle, particularly a tall or bluff-tailed one, more effectively than a [[rear-view mirror]] alone.

Multi-focal Fresnel lenses are also used as a part of [[retinal scan|retina identification]] cameras, where they provide multiple in- and out-of-focus images of a fixation target inside the camera. For virtually all users, at least one of the images will be in focus, thus allowing correct eye alignment.

Fresnel lenses have also been used in the field of popular entertainment. The British rock artist [[Peter Gabriel]] made use of them in his early solo live performances to magnify the size of his head, in contrast to the rest of his body, for dramatic and comic effect. In the [[Terry Gilliam]] film ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', plastic Fresnel screens appear ostensibly as magnifiers for the small CRT monitors used throughout the offices of the Ministry of Information. However, they occasionally appear between the actors and the camera, distorting the scale and composition of the scene to humorous effect. The [[Pixar]] movie [[Wall-E]] features a fresnel lens in the scenes where the protagonist watches the musical [[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]] magnified on an [[iPod]].

====Photography====

[[Canon Inc.|Canon]] and [[Nikon]] have used Fresnel lenses to reduce the size of telephoto lenses. Photographic lenses that include Fresnel elements can be much shorter than corresponding conventional lens design. Nikon calls their technology ''Phase Fresnel''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nikon.com/news/2015/0106_lens_02.htm Nikon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215091950/http://www.nikon.com/news/2015/0106_lens_02.htm |date=15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-digital-picture.com/News/News-Post.aspx?News=14218 The Digital Picture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114054256/http://www.the-digital-picture.com/News/News-Post.aspx?News=14218 |date=14 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Polaroid SX-70]] camera used a Fresnel reflector as part of its viewing system.

[[View camera|View]] and [[large format]] cameras can utilize a Fresnel lens in conjunction with the [[ground glass]], to increase the perceived brightness of the image projected by a lens onto the ground glass, thus aiding in adjusting focus and composition.

===Illumination===
[[File:Inchkeith lighthouse Fresnel lens.JPG|thumb|upright=0.3|Inchkeith lighthouse lens and drive mechanism]]
High-quality glass Fresnel lenses were used in lighthouses, where they were considered state of the art in the late 19th and through the middle of the 20th centuries; most are now retired from service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terrypepper.com/lights/closeups/illumination/fresnel/fresnel.htm Terry Pepper, Seeing the Light, The Incredible Fresnel Lens.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529060347/http://www.terrypepper.com/lights/closeups/illumination/fresnel/fresnel.htm |date=29 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lighthouse Fresnel lens systems typically include extra annular [[Prism (optics)|prismatic]] elements, arrayed in faceted domes above and below the central planar Fresnel, in order to catch all light emitted from the light source.  The light path through these elements can include an [[internal reflection]], rather than the simple [[refraction]] in the planar Fresnel element.  These lenses conferred many practical benefits upon the designers, builders, and users of lighthouses and their illumination.  Among other things, smaller lenses could fit into more compact spaces.  Greater light transmission over longer distances, and varied patterns, made it possible to triangulate a position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terrypepper.com/lights/closeups/illumination/fresnel/fresnel.htm Terry Pepper, Seeing the Light, Fresnel lens.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529060347/http://www.terrypepper.com/lights/closeups/illumination/fresnel/fresnel.htm |date=29 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most widespread use of Fresnel lenses, for a time, occurred in [[automobile]] [[headlamp]]s, where they can shape the roughly parallel beam from the parabolic reflector to meet requirements for dipped and main-beam patterns, often both in the same headlamp unit (such as the European [[H4 lamp|H4]] design). For reasons of cost, weight, and impact resistance, newer cars have dispensed with glass Fresnel lenses, using [[multifaceted reflector]]s with plain [[polycarbonate]] lenses.  However, Fresnel lenses continue in wide use in automobile tail, marker, and backup lights.

Glass Fresnel lenses also are used in lighting instruments for [[theatre]] and [[motion pictures]] (see [[Fresnel lantern]]); such instruments are often called simply ''Fresnels''. The entire instrument consists of a metal housing, a reflector, a lamp assembly, and a Fresnel lens. Many Fresnel instruments allow the lamp to be moved relative to the lens' [[Focus (optics)|focal point]], to increase or decrease the size of the light beam. As a result, they are very flexible, and can often produce a beam as narrow as 7° or as wide as 70°.&lt;ref&gt;Mum, Robert C., ''Photometrics Handbook''. Broadway Press. 2nd Edition. Page 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fresnel lens produces a very soft-edged beam, so is often used as a wash light. A holder in front of the lens can hold a colored plastic film (''gel'') to tint the light or wire screens or frosted plastic to diffuse it. The Fresnel lens is useful in the making of motion pictures not only because of its ability to focus the beam brighter than a typical lens, but also because the light is a relatively consistent intensity across the entire width of the beam of light.

[[File:Optical Landing System, night, aboard USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69).jpg|thumb|Optical Landing System on US Navy aircraft carrier [[USS Dwight D. Eisenhower|USS ''Dwight D. Eisenhower'']]]]

[[Aircraft carrier]]s and naval air stations typically use Fresnel lenses in their [[optical landing system]]s.  The "meatball" light aids the pilot in maintaining proper glide slope for the landing. In the center are amber and red lights composed of Fresnel lenses. Although the lights are always on, the angle of the lens from the pilot's point of view determines the color and position of the visible light. If the lights appear above the green horizontal bar, the pilot is too high. If it is below, the pilot is too low, and if the lights are red, the pilot is very low.

The Fresnel lens has seen applications for enhancing passenger reading lights on Airbus aircraft: in a dark cabin, the focused beam of light does not dazzle neighboring passengers.

===Projection===
The use of Fresnel lenses for image projection reduces image quality, so they tend to occur only where quality is not critical or where the bulk of a solid lens would be prohibitive. Cheap Fresnel lenses can be stamped or molded of transparent plastic and are used in [[overhead projector]]s and [[projection television]]s.

Fresnel lenses of different focal lengths (one [[collimator]], and one collector) are used in commercial and [[DIY]] projection. The collimator lens has the lower focal length and is placed closer to the light source, and the collector lens, which focuses the light into the triplet lens, is placed after the projection image (an [[active matrix LCD]] panel in [[LCD projector]]s). Fresnel lenses are also used as collimators in [[overhead projector]]s.

===Solar power===
Since plastic Fresnel lenses can be made larger than glass lenses, as well as being much cheaper and lighter, they are used to concentrate sunlight for heating in [[solar cooker]]s, in solar forges, and in [[Solar thermal collector|solar collectors]] used to heat water for domestic use. They can also be used to generate steam or to power a [[Stirling engine]].

Fresnel lenses can concentrate sunlight onto [[solar cell]]s with a ratio of almost 500:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soitec.com/en/technologies/concentrix/ |title=Soitec's Concentrix technology |accessdate=3 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417051836/http://www.soitec.com/en/technologies/concentrix/ |archivedate=17 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the active solar-cell surface to be reduced, lowering cost and allowing the use of more efficient cells that would otherwise be too expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 21st century, Fresnel reflectors began to be used in [[concentrating solar power]] (CSP) plants to concentrate solar energy. One application was to preheat water at the coal-fired [[Liddell Power Station]], in Hunter Valley Australia.

Fresnel lenses can be used to sinter sand, allowing [[3D printing]] in glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/this-3d-printer-runs-on-sand-and-sun |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508131048/https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/this-3d-printer-runs-on-sand-and-sun |archivedate=8 May 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In fiction===
The English children's fantasy television series ''[[Shadows (TV series)|Shadows]]'' features an episode "The Other Window", in which a scientist places a Fresnel lens on a window of his home, and his children and his mother are able to see visions of their ancestors in previous centuries in it.

In the horror manga ''[[Uzumaki]]'' by [[Junji Ito]], the concentric patterns of the Fresnel lens of a lighthouse are melted by heat and form a spiral.

A subplot in [[Jimmy Buffett]]'s novel ''[[A Salty Piece of Land]]'' follows the characters' efforts to find a Fresnel lens to refurbish a Bahamian lighthouse.

A Fresnel lens is featured in the 2016 film ''To Keep the Light'' wherein a lighthouse keeper's wife fulfills her husband's duties.

The '''grapefruit''' (''Citrus'' × ''paradisi'') is a [[subtropics|subtropical]] [[citrus]] tree known for its sour to semi-sweet, somewhat bitter [[fruit]]. Grapefruit is a [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] originating in [[Barbados]] as an accidental cross between two introduced species, [[orange (fruit)|sweet orange]] (''C. sinensis'') and [[pomelo]], or shaddock (''C. maxima''), both of which were introduced from Asia in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="Carrington &amp; Fraser"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carrington |first1=Sean |last2=Fraser |first2=HenryC |title=A~Z of Barbados Heritage |edition= |series= |year=2003 |publisher=Macmillan Caribbean |location= |isbn=0-333-92068-6 |pages=90–91 |chapter=Grapefruit |quote=One of many citrus species grown in Barbados. This fruit is believed to have originated in Barbados as a natural cross between sweet orange (''C. sinesis'') and Shaddock (''C. grandis''), both of which originated in Asia and were introduced by Europeans in the seventeenth century. The grapefruit first appeared as an illustration entitled "The Forbidden Fruit Tree" in ''The Natural History of Barbados'' (1750) by Rev. Griffith Hughes. This accords with the scientific name which literally is "citrus of paradise". The fruit seems to have been fairly commonly available around that time, since George Washington in his Barbados Journal (1750-1751) mentions "the Forbidden Fruit" as one of the local fruit available at a dinner party he attended. The plant was later described in the 1837 ''Flora of Jamaica'' as the Barbados Grapefruit. The historical arguments and experimental work on leaf enzymes and oils from possible parents all support a Barbadian origin for the fruit.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When found, it was named the "[[forbidden fruit]]";&lt;ref name="Forbidden_Fruit"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dowling, Curtis F. |author2=Morton, Julia Frances |author2-link=Julia Morton |title=Fruits of warm climates |publisher=J.

The grapefruit was brought to Florida by Count [[Odet Philippe]] in 1823 in what is now known as [[Safety Harbor]]. Further crosses have produced the [[tangelo]] (1905), the [[Minneola tangelo]] (1931), and the [[oroblanco]] (1984).

An early pioneer in the American citrus industry was Kimball Atwood, a wealthy entrepreneur who founded the Atwood Grapefruit Company in the late nineteenth century. The Atwood Grove became the largest grapefruit grove in the world, with a yearly output of 80,000 boxes of fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20040816/NEWS/408160323?tc=ar |title=Manatee County a big part of citrus history |publisher=HeraldTribune.com |date=2004-08-16 |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that pink grapefruit was first discovered in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/grapefruit.html|title=Grapefruit|website=www.hort.purdue.edu|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruby Red===
The 1929 Ruby Red patent was associated with real commercial success, which came after the discovery of a red grapefruit growing on a pink variety. [[Atomic gardening|Using radiation to trigger mutations]], new varieties were developed to retain the red tones which typically faded to pink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=William J Broad |title=Useful Mutants, Bred With Radiation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/28/science/28crop.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;oref=slogin |work=New York Times |date=28 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rio Red variety is the current (2007) Texas grapefruit with registered trademarks Rio Star and Ruby-Sweet, also sometimes promoted as "Reddest" and "Texas Choice". The Rio Red is a [[mutation breeding|mutation bred]] variety that was developed by treatment of bud sticks with thermal neutrons. Its improved attributes of mutant variety are fruit and juice color, deeper red, and wide adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mvgs.iaea.org/Search.aspx?ID=282|title=MVD|website=mvgs.iaea.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Star Ruby===
The Star Ruby is the darkest of the red varieties.

==Colors and flavors==
[[File:Grapefruit-mercaptan-2D-skeletal-vertical.png|80px|thumb|Grapefruit mercaptan]]
Grapefruit comes in many varieties. One way to differentiate between varieties is by the flesh color of fruit they produce.&lt;ref name="WHF"/&gt; The most popular varieties currently cultivated are [[red]], [[white]], and [[pink]] hues, referring to the internal pulp color of the fruit. The family of flavors range from highly acidic and somewhat sour, to sweet and tart.&lt;ref name="WHF"/&gt; [[Grapefruit mercaptan]], a [[sulfur]]-containing [[terpene]], is one of the substances which has a strong influence on the taste and odor of grapefruit, compared with other citrus fruits.&lt;ref name="Andrea_Buettner_and_Peter_Schieberle"&gt;{{cite journal

==Drug interactions==
{{Main|Grapefruit–drug interactions}}

Grapefruit and [[grapefruit juice]] have been found to [[drug interaction|interact]] with numerous [[drugs]] and in many cases, to result in adverse direct and/or side effects (if dosage is not carefully adjusted.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bailey DG, Dresser G, Arnold JM |title=Grapefruit-medication interactions: forbidden fruit or avoidable consequences? |journal=CMAJ |volume=185 |issue=4 |pages=309–16 |date=March 2013 |pmid=23184849 |pmc=3589309 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.120951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This happens in two very different ways. In the first, the effect is from [[bergamottin]], a natural [[furanocoumarin]] in both grapefruit flesh and peel that inhibits the [[CYP3A4]] [[enzyme]], (among others from the [[P450]] enzyme family responsible for metabolizing 90% of drugs). The action of the CYP3A4 enzyme itself is to [[metabolism|metabolize]] many medications.&lt;ref name="CYP3A4 inhibition"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Renee|first1=Janet|title=Does Grapefruit Inhibit Liver Enzymes?|url=http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/grapefruit-inhibit-liver-enzymes-10445.html|website=sfgate.com|publisher=SF Gate|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell May 2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mitchell|first1=Steve|title=Why Grapefruit and Medication Can Be a Dangerous Mix|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/health/grapefruit-and-medications-can-be-a-dangerous-mix/|website=Consumer Reports|accessdate=4 May 2016|date=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the drug's breakdown for removal is lessened, then the level of the drug in the blood may become too high or stay too long, leading to [[adverse effect]]s.&lt;ref name="Mitchell May 2016"/&gt; On the other hand, some drugs must be broken down to become active, and inhibiting CYP3A4 may lead to reduced drug effects.

The other effect is that grapefruit can block the absorption of drugs in the intestine.&lt;ref name="Mitchell May 2016"/&gt; If the drug is not absorbed, then not enough of it is in the blood to have a therapeutic effect.&lt;ref name="Mitchell May 2016"/&gt; Each affected drug has either a specific increase of effect or decrease.

One whole grapefruit, or a glass of {{convert|200|mL|usoz|abbr=on}} of grapefruit juice may cause drug overdose toxicity.&lt;ref name="BaileyDresser2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bailey|first1=D.

&lt;/ref&gt; performed at MSNW LLC from 2005 through 2012. This system theoretically operates at 1&amp;nbsp;Hz, injecting plasma, compressing it to fusion conditions, expanding it and directly recovering the energy to provide electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/next-generation/is-fusion-power-finally-for-real|title = Is Fusion Power Finally For Real?|date = 21 June 2011|website = [[Popular Mechanics]] |last1 = Svoboda|first1 = Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPA experiments claimed 300&amp;nbsp;km/s velocities, deuterium neutron production, and 2 keV deuterium ion temperatures.&lt;ref name="Slough_IAEA" /&gt;

=== Fuel ===
Helion intends to use helium-3/[[deuterium]] fuel. This fuel allows essentially [[aneutronic fusion]], releasing only 5% of its energy in the form of neutrons. The helium is captured and reused, eliminating supply concerns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Fusion reaction: [[deuterium|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;D]] + [[helium-3|&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He]] → [[helium-4|&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He]] + [[proton|&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;p]] + 18.3 [[electronvolt|MeV]]

The IPA experiments used deuterium-deuterium fusion, which produces a 2.4 MeV neutron per reaction. Helion and MSNW published articles describing a deuterium-[[tritium]] implementation which is the easiest to achieve but generate 14 MeV neutrons.

=== Containment ===
This fusion approach uses the magnetic field of a [[Field-reversed configuration|Field Reversed Configuration (FRC)]] [[plasmoid]] (operated with solid state electronics derived from power switching electronics in [[wind turbines]]) to prevent plasma losses. An FRC is a magnetized plasma configuration notable for its closed field lines, high Beta and lack of internal penetrations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Compression ===
To inject the plasmoid into the fusion ‘burn’ chamber two plasmoids are accelerated at high velocity with pulsed magnetic fields and merge into a single plasmoid at high pressure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their experiments achieved plasmas of 1.5 Tesla and 2 keV temperatures. Published records show plans to compress fusion plasmas to 12 Tesla.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21128251-400-star-power-small-fusion-start-ups-aim-for-break-even/|title=Star Power: Small Fusion Startups Aim for Breakeven|last=Hambling|first=David|date=16 August 2011|website=[[New Scientist]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy Generation ===
Energy is captured by [[direct energy conversion]] that translates high-energy [[alpha particles]] directly into a voltage. This eliminates the need for steam turbines and cooling towers (and the associated energy losses).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Funding ==
Helion Energy received $7 million in funding from [[NASA]], the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]] and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]],&lt;ref name="The Alvin Weinberg Foundation"&gt;{{cite web
 |last = Halper|first = Mark|title = The nearness of fusion: The materials and coolant challenges facing one fusion company mirror fission|date = 30 April 2013|website = [[The Alvin Weinberg Foundation]]|url = http://www.the-weinberg-foundation.org/2013/04/30/the-nearness-of-fusion-the-materials-and-coolant-challenges-facing-one-fusion-company-mirror-fission/}}
&lt;/ref&gt; followed by $1.5 million from the [[private sector]] in August 2014, through the [[seed accelerator]]s [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]] and Mithril Capital Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/14/y-combinator-and-mithril-invest-in-helion-a-nuclear-fusion-startup/|title=Y Combinator And Mithril Invest In Helion, A Nuclear Fusion Startup|date=14 August 2014|website=[[TechCrunch]]|last1=Russell|first1=Kyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company raised an additional $10.6 million in July, 2015. 


== Revenue Model ==
Helion Energy’s strategy is to generate revenue based on a royalty model of electricity produced with projected electricity prices of 40-60 $/MWhr (4 to 6 cents per kwh). Penetration of the new capacity market is estimated at 20% of market growth (2.5%) per annum eventually reaching 50% of new power generation worldwide – $52 B/yr. Gradual displacement of existing supplies enables continued growth to 20% of world electrical generation after 20 years with a net return of over $300 billion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8587">An '''inert gas'''/noble gas is a gas which does not undergo chemical reactions under a set of given conditions. The [[noble gases]] often do not react with many substances&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef | file = I03027 | title = inert gas}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and were historically referred to as the inert gases. Inert gases are used generally to avoid unwanted chemical reactions degrading a sample. These undesirable chemical reactions are often [[oxidation]] and [[hydrolysis]] reactions with the oxygen and moisture in [[air]]. The term ''inert gas'' is context-dependent because several of the noble gases can be made to react under certain conditions.

Purified [[argon]] and [[nitrogen]] gases are most commonly used as inert gases due to their high natural abundance (78.2% N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1% Ar in air) and low relative cost.

Unlike [[noble gas]]es, an inert gas is not necessarily elemental and is often a [[Chemical compound|compound]] gas. Like the noble gases the tendency for non-reactivity is due to the valence, the outermost [[electron shell]], being complete in all the inert gases.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Jasvinder. ''The Sterling Dictionary of Physics.'' New Delhi, India: Sterling, 2007. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a tendency, not a rule, as noble gases and other "inert" gases can react to form compounds.

==Production==
The inert gases are obtained by [[air separation|fractional distillation of air]], with the exception of [[helium]] which is separated from a few [[natural gas]] sources rich in this element,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.qatargas.com/english/operations/ras-laffan-helium|title=Qatargas - Operations|last=|first=|date=|website=www.qatargas.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; through cryogenic distillation or membrane separation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sepuran.com/product/sepuran/en/Helium/|title=SEPURAN® Noble for helium recovery - SEPURAN® - Efficient gas separation|website=www.sepuran.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For specialized applications, purified inert gas may be produced by [[specialized generators]] on-site. They are often used aboard chemical tankers and product carriers (smaller vessels). Benchtop specialized generators are also available for laboratories.

==Applications==
Because of the non-reactive properties of inert gases they are often useful to prevent undesirable [[chemical reaction]]s from taking place. Food is packed in inert gas to remove oxygen gas. This prevents bacteria from growing.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, Clive &amp; Teresa Calafut. ''Polypropylene: The Definitive User's Guide and Databook.'' Norwich, New York: Plastics Design Library, 1998. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; It also prevents chemical oxidation by oxygen in normal air. An example is the rancidification (caused by oxidation) of edible oils. In food packaging, inert gases are used as a passive preservative, in contrast to active preservatives like [[sodium benzoate]] (an [[antimicrobial]]) or [[butylated hydroxytoluene|BHT]] (an [[antioxidant]]).

Historical documents may also be stored under an inert gas to avoid degradation. For example, the original documents of the [[U.S. Constitution]] is stored under humidified argon. Helium was previously used, but it was less suitable because it diffuses out of the case more quickly than argon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Charters of Freedom Re-encasement Project | publisher = National Archives | url = https://www.archives.gov/press/press-kits/charters.html | accessdate = 2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inert gases are often used in the chemical industry. In a chemical manufacturing plant, reactions can be conducted under inert gas to minimize fire hazards or unwanted reactions. In such plants and in oil refineries, transfer lines and vessels can be [[purging (gas)|purged]] with inert gas as a fire and explosion prevention measure. At the bench scale, chemists perform experiments on [[air-sensitive compound]]s using [[air-free technique]]s developed to handle them under inert gas.

===Inert gas systems on ships===
Inert gas is produced on board crude oil carriers (above 8,000 tonnes)(from Jan 1, 2016) by using either a [[flue gas system]] or by burning kerosene in a dedicated [[inert gas generator]]. The inert gas system is used to prevent the atmosphere in cargo [[tank]]s or [[bunker]]s from coming into the explosive range.&lt;ref&gt;International Maritime Organization. ''Tanker Familiarization'' London: Ashford Overload Services, 2000. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; IG keeps the [[oxygen]] content of the tank atmosphere below 5% (on crude carriers, less for product carriers and gas tankers), thus making any air/hydrocarbon gas mixture in the tank too rich (too high a fuel to oxygen ratio) to ignite. IG is most important during discharging and during the ballast voyage when more [[hydrocarbon]] vapour is likely to be present in the tank atmosphere. Inert gas can also be used to purge the tank of the volatile atmosphere in preparation for gas freeing - replacing the atmosphere with breathable air - or vice versa. 

The flue gas system uses the boiler exhaust as its source, so it is important that the fuel/air ratio in the boiler burners is properly regulated to ensure that high quality inert gases is produced. Too much air would result in an oxygen content exceeding 5%, too much fuel oil would result in carryover of dangerous hydrocarbon gas. The flue gas is cleaned and cooled by the scrubber tower. Various safety devices prevent overpressure, return of hydrocarbon gas to the engine room, or supply of IG with too high oxygen content. 

Gas tankers and product carriers cannot rely on flue gas systems (because they require IG with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content of 1% or less) and so use inert gas generators instead. The inert gas generator consists of a combustion chamber and scrubber unit supplied by fans and a refrigeration unit which cools the gas. A drier in series with the system removes moisture from the gas before it is supplied to the deck. Cargo tanks on gas carriers are not inerted, but the hold space around them is. This arrangement allows the tanks to be kept cool using a small heel of cargo while the vessel is in ballast while retaining the explosion protection provided by the inert gas.

===Welding===
In gas tungsten [[arc welding]] (GTAW), inert gases are used to shield the tungsten from contamination. It also shields the fluid metal (created from the arc) from the reactive gases in air which can cause porosity in the solidified weld puddle. Inert gases are also used in [[gas metal arc welding]] (GMAW) for welding non-ferrous metals.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, J.R., ed. ''Corrosion: Understanding the Basics.'' Materials Park, Ohio: ASM International, 2000. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Some gases which are not usually considered inert but which behave like inert gases in all the circumstances likely to be encountered in some use can often be used as a substitute for an inert gas. This is useful when an appropriate pseudo-inert gas can be found which is inexpensive and common. For example, [[carbon dioxide]] is sometimes used in gas mixtures for GMAW because it is not reactive to the weld pool created by arc welding. But it is reactive to the arc. The more carbon dioxide that is added to the inert gas, such as argon, will increase your penetration. The amount of carbon dioxide is often determined by what kind of transfer you will be using in GMAW. The most common is spray arc transfer, and the most commonly used gas mixture for spray arc transfer is 90% argon and 10% carbon dioxide. (Listed as many different names depending on the gas supplier).

===Diving===
In [[underwater diving]] an inert gas is a component of the breathing mixture which is not metabolically active, and serves to dilute the gas mixture. The inert gas may have effects on the diver, but these are thought to be mostly physical effects, such as tissue damage caused by bubbles in [[decompression sickness]]. The most common inert gas used in breathing gas for commercial diving is helium.

'''Jojoba esters''' are the [[hydrogenation]] or [[transesterification]] product of [[Jojoba oil]].  Jojoba Esters are commonly used in [[cosmetics|cosmetic]] formulations as an [[emollient]], due to its remarkable similarity to the natural [[sebum|oils produced by the human skin]], and its high oxidative stability.  Fully hydrogenated jojoba esters are most often small beads used to [[exfoliation (cosmetology)|exfoliate]] the skin.

==Chemical structure==
Jojoba esters are proper waxes; there is no [[triglyceride]] component of jojoba esters.
Chemically, jojoba esters are a complex mixture of long chain (C36-C46) [[fatty acid]]s and [[fatty alcohol]]s joined by an ester bond. Jojoba esters are produced by the interesterification of jojoba oil, [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] jojoba oil, or a mixture of the two. Pure jojoba oil and pure [[Hydrogenated Jojoba Oil|hydrogenated jojoba oil]] are also correctly described as jojoba esters. The [[Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association|CTFA]] does not regard ''partially''-hydrogenated jojoba oil as jojoba esters. For this reason, jojoba esters must not contain any trans-unsaturation. Jojoba esters' chemical structure is very similar to that of human [[sebum]] and of [[whale oil]].

==Physical properties==
Physically, jojoba esters are an odourless, colourless liquid, white cream, or hard white wax, with melting points ranging from 15°C to 70°C. Their texture and crystallinity may be modified by rapid cooling, thus altering their cosmetic properties. Jojoba esters are very resistant to [[oxidation]], more so than [[castor oil]], [[coconut oil]], [[macadamia|macadamia oil]], even many fractions of [[mineral oil]].

==Uses==
Jojoba esters are mainly used as emollients in [[cosmetics]] such as [[lipstick]]s, [[shampoos]] and moisturizing lotions. Jojoba esters may be [[Ethoxylation|ethoxylated]] to form such water-soluble materials as [[PEG-150 Jojoba]], [[PEG-120 Jojoba]] or [[PEG-80 Jojoba]].  Jojoba esters are excellent botanical substitutes for [[whale oil]] and its derivatives, such as [[cetyl alcohol]] and [[spermaceti]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kapton is used in, among other things, flexible printed circuits ([[flexible electronics]]) and [[space blanket|thermal blankets used on spacecraft, satellites, and various space instruments]].

The chemical name for Kapton K and HN is poly (4,4'-oxydiphenylene-pyromellitimide). It is produced from the condensation of [[pyromellitic dianhydride]] and [[4,4'-Oxydianiline|4,4'-oxydiphenylamine]]. Kapton synthesis is an example of the use of a [[wikt:dianhydride|dianhydride]] in [[step polymerization]]. The intermediate polymer, known as a "poly(amic acid)", is soluble because of strong [[hydrogen bond]]s to the [[polar solvent]]s usually employed in the reaction. The [[ring closure]] is carried out at high temperatures ({{convert|200|–|300|C|F K|0}}).

==Usage==
The thermal conductivity of Kapton at temperatures from 0.5 to 5 Kelvin is rather high for such low temperatures, κ = 4.638×10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; ''T''&lt;sup&gt;0.5678&lt;/sup&gt; W·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

This, together with its good dielectric qualities and its availability as thin sheets have made it a favorite material in [[cryogenics]], as it provides electrical insulation at low thermal gradients. Kapton is regularly used as an insulator in ultra-high vacuum environments due to its low [[outgassing]] rate.&lt;ref name="Kittel1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Kittel|title=Advances in Cryogenic Engineering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pU7ewTiwiWMC&amp;pg=PA1366|accessdate=29 April 2012|date=30 September 1998|publisher=Birkhäuser|isbn=978-0-306-45807-1|pages=1366–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aircraft===
Kapton-insulated electrical wiring has been widely used in civil and military aircraft because it is lighter than other insulators and has good insulating and temperature characteristics. 
However, Kapton insulation ages poorly: an FAA study shows degradation in under 100 hours in a hot, humid environment,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tc.faa.gov/its/worldpac/techrpt/ar082.pdf FAA insulation aging test results]. DOT/FAA Tech Report AR-08/2, January 2008. Retrieved on 2013-08-23&lt;/ref&gt; or in the presence of seawater. It was found to have very poor resistance to mechanical wear, mainly abrasion within cable harnesses due to aircraft movement. Many aircraft models have had to undergo extensive rewiring modifications—sometimes completely replacing all the Kapton-insulated wiring—because of short circuits caused by the faulty insulation.  Kapton-wire degradation and chafing due to vibration and heat has been implicated in multiple crashes of both fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft, with loss of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.military.com/daily-news/2014/09/08/inquiry-frayed-wire-led-to-fatal-navy-helo-crash.html Fatal helicopter crash caused by Kapton wiring] www.military.com Retrieved 2015-02-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spacecraft ===

The descent stage of the [[Apollo Lunar Module]], and the bottom of the ascent stage surrounding the ascent engine, were covered in blankets of aluminized Kapton foil to provide thermal insulation. During the return journey from the Moon, [[Apollo 11]] astronaut [[Neil Armstrong]] commented that during the launch of the Lunar Module ascent stage, he could see "Kapton and other parts on the LM staging scattering all around the area for great distances." &lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap11fj/21day6-tei.html Apollo 11 Flight Journal – Day 6 part 4: Trans-Earth Injection]. History.nasa.gov (2011-03-15). Retrieved on 2012-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a [[NASA]] internal report, [[Space Shuttle program|space shuttle]] "wires were coated with an insulator known as Kapton that tended to break down over time, causing short circuits and, potentially, fires."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/25/science/space/25shuttle.html High Tech in the 1970s, Shuttles Feel Their Age]. New York Times (2005-07-25)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NASA]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] has considered Kapton as a good plastic support for [[solar sail]]s because of its long duration in the space environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerome L. Wright|title=Space Sailing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KH5jTAzVw5MC&amp;pg=PA100|accessdate=28 April 2012|date=1 January 1992|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis US|isbn=978-2-88124-842-9|pages=100–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA's [[New Horizons]] spacecraft used Kapton in an innovative "[[vacuum flask|Thermos bottle]]" insulation design to keep the craft operating between {{convert|10|-|30|C|F}} throughout its more than nine-year, 3 billion mile journey to rendezvous with the dwarf planet Pluto on July 14, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;NASA New Horizons Pluto Mission, ''[http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Mission/The-Path-to-Pluto/Mission-Design.php Mission Design]'' Retrieved April 23, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The main body is covered in lightweight, gold-colored, multilayered thermal insulation which holds in heat from operating electronics to keep the spacecraft warm. The thermal blanketing–18 layers of [[Dacron]] mesh cloth sandwiched between aluminized [[BoPET|Mylar]] and Kapton film–also helped to protect the craft from micrometeorites.&lt;ref&gt;NASA, New Horizons Mission, [http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Mission/Spacecraft/Systems-and-Components.php Thermal Control]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sunshield (JWST)|sunshield]] of the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] is also made of aluminized Kapton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ngst.gsfc.nasa.gov/coating.html "Sunshield Membrane Coatings" page at the JWST website]. Ngst.gsfc.nasa.gov. Retrieved on 2017-05-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crew aboard the [[International Space Station]] used Kapton tape to temporarily repair a slow leak in a [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] spacecraft attached to the Russian segment of the orbital complex in August, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2018/08/30/international-space-station-status-2/ "ISS Status blog" at NASA website]. blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2018/08/30/international-space-station-status-2/ Retrieved on 2018-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-rays ===

Kapton is also commonly used as a material for windows of all kinds at [[X-ray]] sources ([[synchrotron]] beam-lines and [[X-ray tube]]s) and X-ray detectors. Its high mechanical and thermal stability and high transmittance to X-rays make it the preferred material. It is also relatively insensitive to [[radiation damage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Janez Megusar | year = 1997 | title = Low temperature fast-neutron and gamma irradiation of Kapton polyimide films | journal = Journal of Nuclear Materials | volume = 245 | pages = 185–190 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-3115(97)00012-3 | issue = 2–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronics manufacturing===
Due to its large range of temperature stability, and its electrical isolation ability, Kapton tape is usually used in electronic manufacturing as an insulation and protection layer on electrostatic sensitive and fragile components. As it can sustain the temperature needed for a reflow soldering operation, its protection is available throughout the whole production process, and Kapton is often still present in the final consumer product.

===3D printing===

Kapton and [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] adhere to each other very well, which has led to widespread use of Kapton as a build surface for [[3D printer]]s. Kapton is laid down on a flat surface and the ABS is extruded on to the Kapton surface. The ABS part being printed will not detach from the build platform as it cools and shrinks, a common cause of print failure by warping of the part.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In [[non-equilibrium physics]],  the '''Keldysh formalism''' is a general framework for describing the [[quantum mechanical]] evolution of a system in a non-equilibrium state, e.g. in the presence of time varying fields ([[electrical field]], [[magnetic field]] etc.). Keldysh formalism is named after [[Leonid Keldysh]]. It is sometimes called '''Schwinger–Keldysh''' formalism, referring to [[Julian Schwinger]]. However, many physicists, like [[Leo Kadanoff]], [[Gordon Baym]], [[O. V. Konstantinov]] and [[V. I. Perel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/721888724|title=Field theory of non-equilibrium systems|last=Kamenev|first=Alex|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521760829|location=Cambridge|pages=|oclc=721888724}}&lt;/ref&gt; made significant contributions to developing the method that is now called Keldysh formalism.

To study non-equilibrium systems, one is interested in one-point functions or average values of quantum operators, two-point functions and so on. These quantities are calculated using Keldysh formalism. The main mathematical object in the Keldysh formalism is the non-equilibrium [[Green's function]] (NEGF), which is related to the two-point function of operators in the system we are looking at.

== Time evolution of a quantum system  ==

Consider a general quantum mechanical system. This system has the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt;. Let the initial state of the system be &lt;math&gt;|n \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, which can either be a pure state or a mixed state. If we now add a time-dependent perturbation to this Hamiltonian, say &lt;math&gt;H'(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the full Hamiltonian is &lt;math&gt;H(t) = H_0+H'(t)&lt;/math&gt; and hence the system will evolve in time under the full Hamiltonian. In this section, we will see how time evolution actually works in quantum mechanics.

Let us consider a [[Hermitian]] operator &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt;. In the [[Heisenberg Picture]] of quantum mechanics, this operator is time-dependent and the state is not. The expectation value of the operator &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is given by

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\langle \mathcal{O}(t) \rangle &amp;= \langle n | {U}^{\dagger}(t,0) \, \mathcal{O}(0) \, U(t,0) | n \rangle\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Where, due to time evolution of operators in the Heisenberg Picture, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(t) = U^{\dagger}(t,0) \mathcal{O}(0) U(t, 0)&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Time evolution|time-evolution unitary operator]] &lt;math&gt;U(t_2, t_1)&lt;/math&gt;is the [[time-ordered]] exponential of an integral &lt;math&gt;U(t_2,t_1)=T(e^{-i\int_{t_1}^{t_2} H(t') dt'})&lt;/math&gt; (Note that if the Hamiltonian at one time commutes with the Hamiltonian at different times, then this can be simplified to &lt;math&gt;U(t_2,t_1)=e^{-i\int_{t_1}^{t_2} H(t') dt'}&lt;/math&gt;)

For perturbative quantum mechanics and [[quantum field theory]], it is often more convenient to use the [[interaction picture]]. The interaction picture operator is

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \mathcal{O_I}(t)  &amp;=  {U_0}^{\dagger}(t,0) \, \mathcal{O}(0) \, U_0(t,0)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; U_0(t_1,t_2) = e^{-iH_0(t_1-t_2)}
&lt;/math&gt;. Then defining &lt;math&gt; S(t_1,t_2) = U_0^{\dagger}(t_1,t_2)U(t_1, t_2)
&lt;/math&gt; we have

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\langle \mathcal{O}(t) \rangle &amp;= \langle n | {S}^{\dagger}(t,0) \mathcal{O_I}(t) S(t,0) | n \rangle\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the time-evolution unitary operators satisfy &lt;math&gt;U(t_3, t_2) U(t_2, t_1) = U(t_3, t_1)&lt;/math&gt;, the above expression can be rewritten as

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\langle \mathcal{O}(t) \rangle &amp;= \langle n | {S}^{\dagger}(\infty,0) S(\infty, t) \mathcal{O_I}(t) \, S(t,0) | n \rangle\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

or with &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; replaced by any time value greater than &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

== Path ordering on the Keldysh contour ==
We can write the above expression more succinctly by, purely formally, replacing each operator &lt;math&gt;X(t)&lt;/math&gt; with a contour-ordered operator &lt;math&gt;X(c)
&lt;/math&gt; , such that &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; parametrizes the contour path on the time axis starting at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;, proceeding to &lt;math&gt;t=\infty&lt;/math&gt;, and then returning to &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;. This path is known as the Keldysh contour. &lt;math&gt;X(c)&lt;/math&gt;  has the same operator action as &lt;math&gt;X(t)&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the time value corresponding to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;) but also has the additional information of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; (that is, strictly speaking &lt;math&gt;X(c_1) \neq X(c_2)   &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;c_1 \neq c_2   &lt;/math&gt;, even if for the corresponding times &lt;math&gt;X(t_1) = X(t_2)    &lt;/math&gt;).

Then we can introduce notation of [[Path-ordering|path ordering]] on this contour, by defining  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T_c} ( X^{(1)}(c_1) X^{(2)}(c_2)\ldots X^{(n)}(c_n) ) = (\pm 1)^{\sigma}X^{(\sigma(1))}(c_{\sigma(1)}) X^{(\sigma(2))}(c_{\sigma(2)})\ldots X^{(\sigma(n))}(c_{\sigma(n)})   &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a permutation such that &lt;math&gt;c_{\sigma(1)} &lt; c_{\sigma(2)} &lt; \ldots c_{\sigma(n)}   &lt;/math&gt;, and the plus and minus signs are for [[Bosonic field|bosonic]] and [[Fermionic field|fermionic]] operators respectively. Note that this is a generalization of [[Time-ordering|time ordering]].

With this notation, the above time evolution is written as

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\langle \mathcal{O}(t) \rangle &amp;= \langle n | \mathcal{T_c}( \mathcal{O(c)} e^{-i\int dc' H'(c')} | n \rangle
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; on the forward branch of the Keldysh contour, and the integral over &lt;math&gt;c'&lt;/math&gt; goes over the entire Keldysh contour. For the rest of this article, as is conventional, we will usually simply use the notation &lt;math&gt;X(t)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;X(c)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the time corresponding to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, and whether &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is on the forward or reverse branch is inferred from context.

== Keldysh diagrammatic technique for Green's functions ==
The non-equilibrium Green's function is defined as &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
iG(x_1, t_1, x_2, t_2)= \langle n |  T \psi(x_1,t_1) \psi(x_2,t_2) | n \rangle
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;.

Or in the interaction picture  &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
iG(x_1, t_1, x_2, t_2)= \langle n |  \mathcal{T_c} (e^{-i\int_c H'(t')dt'}  \psi(x_1,t_1) \psi(x_2,t_2)) | n \rangle
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; . We can expand the exponential as a Taylor series to obtain the perturbation series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\langle n |  \mathcal{T_c} ((-i\int_t (H'(t', +)+ H'(t',-) )dt')^j  \psi(x_1,t_1) \psi(x_2,t_2)) | n \rangle / j! &lt;/math&gt;. This is the same procedure as in equilibrium diagrammatic perturbation theory, but with the important difference that both forward and reverse contour branches are included.

If, as is often the case, &lt;math&gt; H' &lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial or series as a function of the elementary fields &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, we can organize this perturbation series into monomial terms and apply all possible [[Wick's Theorem|Wick pairings]] to the fields in each monomial, obtaining a summation of [[Feynman diagrams]]. However, the edges of the Feynman diagram correspond to different propagators depending on whether the paired operators come from the forward or reverse branches. Namely,

:&lt;math&gt; \langle n | \mathcal{T_c} \psi (x_1, t_1, +) \psi (x_2, t_2, +)|n \rangle \equiv G_0^{++}(x_1,t_1 , x_2, t_2)= \langle n|\mathcal{T}\psi (x_1,t_1) \psi (x_2,t_2)|n \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \langle n | \mathcal{T_c} \psi (x_1, t_1, +) \psi (x_2, t_2, -)|n \rangle \equiv G_0^{+-}(x_1,t_1 , x_2, t_2)= \langle n|\psi (x_1,t_1) \psi (x_2,t_2)|n \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \langle n | \mathcal{T_c} \psi (x_1, t_1, -) \psi (x_2, t_2, +)|n \rangle \equiv G_0^{-+}(x_1,t_1 , x_2, t_2)= \pm \langle n| \psi (x_2,t_2)\psi (x_1,t_1)|n \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \langle n | \mathcal{T_c} \psi (x_1, t_1, -) \psi (x_2, t_2, -)|n \rangle \equiv G_0^{--}(x_1,t_1 , x_2, t_2)= \langle n|\mathcal{\overline{T}}\psi (x_1,t_1) \psi (x_2,t_2)|n \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

where the anti-time ordering &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\overline{T}}&lt;/math&gt; orders operators in the opposite way as time ordering and the &lt;math&gt; \pm &lt;/math&gt; sign in &lt;math&gt; G_0^{-+} &lt;/math&gt;  is for bosonic or fermionic fields. Note that &lt;math&gt;G_0^{--}&lt;/math&gt; is the propagator used in ordinary ground state theory.

Thus, Feynman diagrams for correlation functions can be drawn and their values computed the same way as in ground state theory, except with the following modifications to the Feynman rules: Each internal vertex of the diagram is labeled with either &lt;math&gt; + &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; - &lt;/math&gt;, while external vertices are labelled with &lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;. Then each (unrenormalized) edge directed from a vertex &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; (with position &lt;math&gt;x_a&lt;/math&gt;, time &lt;math&gt;t_a&lt;/math&gt; and sign &lt;math&gt; s_a&lt;/math&gt;) to a vertex &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; (with position &lt;math&gt;x_b&lt;/math&gt;, time &lt;math&gt;t_b&lt;/math&gt; and sign &lt;math&gt;s_b&lt;/math&gt;) corresponds to the propagator &lt;math&gt;G_0^{s_as_b}(x_a,t_a , x_b, t_b)&lt;/math&gt;. Then the diagram values for each choice of &lt;math&gt; \pm &lt;/math&gt; signs (there are &lt;math&gt;2^{v}&lt;/math&gt; such choices, where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the number of internal vertices) are all added up to find the total value of the diagram.

'''Khimera''' is a software product from Kintech Lab intended for calculation of the kinetic parameters of microscopic processes, thermodynamic and transport properties of substances and their mixtures in gases, plasmas and also of heterogeneous processes.
The development of a kinetic mechanism is a key stage of present-day technologies for the creation of hi-tech devices and processes in a wide range of fields, such as microelectronics, chemical industry, and the design and optimization of combustion engines and power stations.
Khimera with [[Chemical WorkBench]], another software product from [[Kintech Lab]], allows both the development of complex physical and chemical mechanisms and their validation. Essential feature of Khimera is its user-friendly interface for importing and utilizing the results of quantum-chemical calculations for estimating rate constants of elementary processes and thermodynamic and transport properties.

==Fields of Application==
Khimera incorporates up to date achievements in the development of the wide range of models of elementary physicochemical processes; these models are of particular importance for hi-tech applications in:
*microelectronics
*materials science
*chemical industry
*automobile and aviation industry
*power engineering.

==Basic Capabilities==
The computation modules of Khimera allow one to calculate the kinetic parameters of elementary processes and thermodynamic and transport properties from the data on the molecular structures and properties obtained from quantum-chemical calculations or from an experiment. The molecular properties and the parameters of molecular interactions can be calculated using quantum-chemical software ([[Gaussian (software)|Gaussian]], [[GAMESS (disambiguation)|GAMESS]], [[Jaguar (software)|Jaguar]], [[Amsterdam Density Functional|ADF]]) and directly imported into Khimera in an automatic mode.  The results of calculations can be presented visually and exported for the further use in kinetic modeling and CFD packages.

The '''Lambda point''' is the [[temperature]] at which normal fluid [[helium]] (helium I) makes the transition to [[superfluid]] helium II (approximately 2.17 [[Kelvin|K]] at 1 [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]]).  The lowest pressure at which He-I and He-II can coexist is the vapor−He-I−He-II [[triple point]] at {{convert|2.1768|K|C}} and {{convert|5.048|kPa|atm|abbr=on}}, which is the "saturated [[vapor pressure]]" at that temperature (pure helium gas in thermal equilibrium over the liquid surface, in a [[Hermetic seal|hermetic]] container).&lt;ref name=Donnelly&gt;{{cite journal| title=The Observed Properties of Liquid Helium at the Saturated Vapor Pressure | first1=Russell J.| last1=Donnelly| first2=Carlo F.| last2=Barenghi | journal=[[Journal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data]]| year=1998| volume=27| issue=6| pages=1217–1274| doi=10.1063/1.556028|bibcode = 1998JPCRD..27.1217D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest pressure at which He-I and He-II can coexist is the [[Body-centered cubic|bcc]]−He-I−He-II triple point with a helium solid at {{convert|1.762|K|C}}, {{convert|29.725|atm|kPa|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Hoffer&gt;{{cite journal| title=Thermodynamic properties of &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He.

The point's name derives from the graph (pictured) that results from plotting the [[specific heat capacity]] as a function of [[temperature]] (for a given pressure in the above range, in the example shown, at 1 atmosphere), which resembles the [[Greek language|Greek]] letter [[lambda]]. The specific heat capacity tends towards [[infinity]] as the temperature approaches the lambda point.  The tip of the peak is so sharp that a critical exponent characterizing the divergence of the heat capacity can be measured precisely only in zero gravity, to provide a uniform density over a substantial volume of fluid.  Hence the heat capacity was measured within 2&amp;nbsp;nK below the transition in an experiment included in a [[Space Shuttle]] payload in 1992.&lt;ref name=JPL&gt;{{cite journal| title=Heat Capacity and Thermal Relaxation of Bulk Helium very near the Lambda Point | first1=J.A.| last1=Lipa| first2=D.

Sometimes these rains are referred to generically as ‘April rains’ or ‘Summer showers’. They are notable across much of South and Southeast Asia, including India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/04/06/stories/2007040613960300.htm |title=Karnataka / Bangalore News : Mango growers a worried lot |publisher=The Hindu |date=2007-04-06 |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;Sunderland, T., Sayer, J., Hoang, M. and Laurance, W. (2012) Evidence-based Conservation: Lessons from the Lower Mekong. Earthscan&lt;/ref&gt; In southern Asia, these rains greatly influence human activities because the control the rains have on crops that are culturally significant like mangoes and coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gunnell|first=Yanni|date=18 March 1997|title=Relief and Climate in South Asia: The Influence of the Western Ghats on the Current Climate Pattern of Peninsular India|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yanni_Gunnell/publication/230131802_Relief_and_climate_in_South_Asia_the_influence_of_the_Western_Ghats_on_the_current_climate_pattern_of_Peninsular_India/links/0deec5371bad2e851c000000.pdf|journal=International Journal of Climatology|volume=17|pages=1169–1182|doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-0088(199709)17:11&lt;1169::aid-joc189&gt;3.0.co;2-w|bibcode=1997IJCli..17.1169G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These rains normally occur from March to April, although their arrival is often difficult to predict. Their intensity can range from light showers to heavy and persistent thunderstorms. In [[India]], the mango showers occurs as the result of [[thunderstorm]] development over the [[Bay of Bengal]].They are also known as '[[Nor'wester (Bangladesh)|Kalbaishakhi]]' in [[Bengal]], as [[Bordoisila]] in [[Assam]] and as Cherry Blossom shower or Coffee Shower in [[Kerala]].

Towards the close of the summer season, pre-monsoon showers are common, especially in Kerala, Karnataka and parts of Tamil Nadu in India. They help in the early ripening of mangoes, thus often referred to as 'mango showers'.

[[Image:MSRR-1.png|thumb|MSRR-1 (NASA)]]
The '''Materials Science Laboratory''' (MSL) of the [[European Space Agency]] is a [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]] on board the [[International Space Station]] for [[materials science]] experiments in low gravity.

It is installed in [[NASA|NASA's]] first Materials Science Research Rack which is placed in the [[Destiny (ISS module)|Destiny]] laboratory on board the ISS. Its purpose is to process material samples in different ways: directional solidification of metals and alloys, crystal growth of semi-conducting materials, thermo-physical properties and diffusion experiments of alloys and glass-forming materials, and investigations on polymers and ceramics at the liquid-solid phase transition.&lt;ref name=DLR_MP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlr.de/mp/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-3107/4903_read-7060/|title=MSL-LGF: High temperature materials research on board the ISS by means of resistance heated furnaces|publisher=DLR|accessdate=August 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MSL was built for ESA by [[Astrium|EADS Astrium]] in Friedrichshafen, Germany. It is operated and monitored by the [[Microgravity User Support Center]] (MUSC) of the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR) in Cologne, Germany.

==Mission summary==
MSL was launched with [[Space Shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]] on its [[STS-128]] mission at the end of August 2009. It was transferred from the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module to the Destiny Laboratory shortly after the shuttle docked to the International Space Station some two days after launch. 
After that the commissioning activities started to check out first the functionality of the Materials Science Research Rack and MSL inside MSRR. The commissioning included the processing of the first two samples which took place at the beginning of November. After bringing those two samples back to ground for analysis by the scientists the rest of the samples from batch 1 will be processed in early 2010.

==Core facility==
The '''Materials Science Laboratory''' (MSL) facility is the contribution of the European Space Agency to NASA's MSRR-1. It occupies one half of an [[International Standard Payload Rack]].

The MSL consists of a '''Core Facility''', together with associated support sub-systems. The '''Core Facility''' consists mainly of a vacuum-tight stainless steel cylinder ('''Process Chamber''') capable of accommodating different individual '''Furnace Inserts''' (FIs), within which sample processing is carried out. The processing chamber provides an accurately controlled processing environment and measurement of microgravity levels. It can house several different '''Furnace Inserts'''. During the first batch of experiments the [[LGF (ISS Facility)|Low Gradient Furnace (LGF)]] is installed. Another furnace, the [[SOF ISS Facility|Solidification and Quenching Furnace (SQF)]] is already produced and waiting on ground for future operations. The FI can be moved with a dedicated drive mechanism, to process each sample according to requirements from the scientists. Processing normally takes place under vacuum.

The '''Core Facility''' supports FIs with up to eight heating elements, and provides the mechanical, thermal and electrical infrastructure necessary to handle the FIs, the [[SCA (ISS Facility)|Sample Cartridge Assembly (SCA)]], together with any associated experiment-dedicated electronics that may be required.

A FI is an arrangement of heating elements, isolating zones and cooling zones contained in a thermal insulation assembly. On the outer envelope of this assembly is a water-cooled metal jacket forming the mechanical interface to the '''Core Facility'''.

The major characteristics of the two produced Furnace Inserts are:

* '''Low Gradient Furnace (LGF)'''
The LGF is designed mainly for Bridgman crystal growth of semiconductor materials. It consists of two heated cavities separated by an adiabatic zone. This assembly can establish low and precisely controlled gradients between two very stable temperature levels.

* '''Solidification and Quenching Furnace (SQF)'''
The SQF is designed mainly for metallurgical research, with the option of quenching the solidification interface at the end of processing by quickly displacing the cooling zone. It consists of a heated cavity and a water-cooled cooling zone separated by an adiabatic zone. It can establish medium to steep temperature gradients along the experiment sample. For creating large gradients, a Liquid Metal Ring enhances the thermal coupling between the SCA and the cooling zone.&lt;ref name=ERASMUS_MSL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/downloads/factsheets/fs022_11_msl.pdf|title=Material Science Laboratory|publisher=ERASMUS User Centre and Communication Office - Directorate of Human Spaceflight - European Space Agency|accessdate=August 9, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051106004842/http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/downloads/factsheets/fs022_11_msl.pdf|archivedate=November 6, 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sample cartridge assembly==
The samples to be processed are contained in experiment cartridges, the SCAs, that consist of a leak-tight tube, crucible, sensors for process control, sample probe and cartridge foot (i.e. the mechanical and electrical interface to the process chamber). The MSL safety concept requires that experiment samples containing toxic compounds are contained in SCAs that support the detection of potential leaks. The volume between the experiment sample and the cartridge tube is filled with a pre-defined quantity of krypton, allowing leak detection by mass spectrometry. However the first batch of experiments does not contain any toxic substances.

Up to 12 scientific thermocouples provide the sample's temperature profile and allow differential thermal analysis.&lt;ref name=ERASMUS_MSL /&gt;

==Experiments==
[[CETSOL and MICAST (ISS Experiment)|Materials Science Laboratory - Columnar-to-Equiaxed Transition in Solidification Processing (CETSOL)]] and [[CETSOL and MICAST (ISS Experiment)|Microstructure Formation in Casting of Technical Alloys under Diffusive and Magnetically Controlled Convective Conditions (MICAST)]] are two investigations which will examine different growth patterns and evolution of microstructures during crystallization of metallic alloys in microgravity.

MICAST studies microstructure formation during casting of technical alloys under diffusive and magnetically controlled convective conditions. The experimental results together with parametric studies using numerical simulations, will be used to optimize industrial casting processes. MICAST identifies and controls experimentally the fluid-flow patterns that affect microstructure evolution during casting processes, and to develop analytical and advanced numerical models. The microgravity environment of the International Space Station is of special importance to this project because only there are all gravity-induced convections eliminated and well-defined conditions for solidification prevail that can be disturbed by artificial fluid flow being under full control of the experimenters. Design solutions that make it possible to improve casting processes and especially [[aluminium alloy]]s with well-defined properties will be provided. MICAST studies the influence of pure diffusive and convective conditions on '''aluminium-silicon''' (AlSi) and '''aluminium-silicon-iron''' (AlSiFe) cast alloys on the microstructure evolution during directional solidification with and without rotating magnetic field.

The major objective of CETSOL is to improve and validate the modelling of [[Columnar-Equiaxed Transition|Columnar-Equiaxed Transition (CET)]] and of the grain microstructure in solidification processing. This aims to give industry confidence in the reliability of the numerical tools introduced in their integrated numerical models of casting, and their relationship. To achieve this goal, intensive deepening of the quantitative characterization of the basic physical phenomena that, from the microscopic to the macroscopic scales, govern microstructure
formation and CET will be pursued.
CET occurs during columnar growth when new grains grow ahead of the columnar front in the undercooled liquid. Under certain conditions, these grains can stop the columnar growth and then the solidification microstructure becomes equiaxed. Experiments have to take place on the ISS due to the long-duration required to solidify samples with the objective to study the CET. Indeed, the length scale of the grain structure when columnar growth takes place is of the order of the casting scale rather than the microstructure scale. This is due to the fact that, to a first approximation, it is the heat flow that controls the transition rather than the solute flow. Experimental programs are being carried out on aluminium-nickel and aluminium-silicon alloys.&lt;ref name=MICAST_CETSOL&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20090014815_2009014348.pdf|title=MSL-CETSOL and MICAST|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate=November 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Metronome Nikko.jpg|Mechanical metronome|thumb|right]]
A '''metronome''', from [[ancient Greek]] μέτρον (''métron'', "measure") and νέμω (''némo'', "I manage", "I lead"), is a device that produces an audible click or other sound at a regular interval that can be set by the user, typically in [[beats per minute|beats per minute (BPM)]]. Musicians use the device to practice playing to a regular [[pulse (music)|pulse]]. Metronomes typically include synchronized visual motion (e.g., swinging pendulum or blinking lights).

A kind of metronome was among the inventions of Andalusian polymath [[Abbas ibn Firnas]] (810–887). In 1815, [[Johann Maelzel]] patented it as a tool for musicians, under the title "Instrument/Machine for the Improvement of all Musical Performance, called Metronome".&lt;ref name=maelzel /&gt;

Musicians practice with metronomes to improve their timing, especially the ability to stick to a [[tempo]]. Metronome practice helps internalize a clear sense of timing and tempo. [[Composers]] often use a metronome as a standard tempo reference—and may play or sing their work to the metronome to derive beats per minute if they want to indicate that in a composition.

When interpreting emotion and other qualities in music, performers seldom play exactly on every beat. Typically, every beat of a musically expressive performance does not align exactly with each click of a metronome.&lt;ref name="AndrewRobertsonTimingVariations"&gt;Andrew Robertson.

==Etymology==
The word metronome first appeared in English {{circa}} 1815 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Oxford English Dictionary online | url=http://dictionary.oed.com | accessdate=2009-01-16 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625103623/http://dictionary.oed.com/ | archivedate=2006-06-25 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is Greek in origin: ''metron'' "measure" and ''nomos'' "regulating, law".

==History==
[[File:Wittner metronome.jpg|A Wittner mechanical wind-up metronome in motion|thumb|right]]

According to [[Lynn Townsend White, Jr.]], the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] [[Inventions in the Islamic world|inventor]], [[Abbas Ibn Firnas]] (810–887), made the earliest attempt at creating     a metronome.&lt;ref name=White-100&gt;[[Lynn Townsend White, Jr.]] (Spring, 1961). "Eilmer of Malmesbury, an Eleventh Century Aviator: A Case Study of Technological Innovation, Its Context and Tradition", ''Technology and Culture'' '''2''' (2), p. 97–111 [100]: "Ibn Firnas was a polymath: a [[Islamic medicine|physician]], a rather bad [[Islamic poetry|poet]], the first to make [[glass]] from [[Rock (geology)|stones]] ([[quartz]]), a student of [[Islamic music|music]], and inventor of some sort of metronome."&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo Galilei first studied and discovered concepts involving the [[pendulum]] in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. In 1696, [[Etienne Loulié]] first successfully used an adjustable pendulum to make the first mechanical metronome—however, his design produced no sound, and did not have an [[escapement]] to keep the pendulum in motion.&lt;ref name="franzmfg.com"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.franzmfg.com/history.htm | title = A Brief History of the Metronome | publisher = Franz Manufacturing Company, Inc. | accessdate = 2010-04-02 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100324143043/http://www.franzmfg.com/history.htm | archivedate = 2010-03-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; To get the correct pulse with this kind of visual device, the musician watches the pendulum as if watching a conductor's baton.

The more familiar mechanical musical chronometer was invented by [[Dietrich Nikolaus Winkel]] in [[Amsterdam]] in 1814. Through questionable practice,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HugqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA17 The Metronome]; The Harmonicon, Volume 8, 1830&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Nepomuk Maelzel|Johann Maelzel]], incorporating Winkel's ideas, added a scale, called it a metronome and started manufacturing the metronome under his own name in 1816: "Maelzel's Metronome." The original text of Maelzel's patent in England (1815) can be downloaded.&lt;ref name=maelzel&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dO80AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA7 Maelzel's patent of the Metronome] The Repertory of patent inventions: and other discoveries and improvements in arts, manufactures, and agriculture ... published by T. and G. Underwood, 1818 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=-b8-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA7 alternative])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] was maybe the first notable composer to indicate specific metronome markings in his music. This was done in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;Kolisch, R. and Mendel, A. (1943) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/739519 "Tempo and Character in Beethoven's Music"], pg. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
[[Musician]]s practice playing to metronomes to develop and maintain a sense of timing and tempo. For example, a musician fighting a tendency to speed up might play a phrase repeatedly while slightly slowing the BPM setting each time. Even pieces that do not require a strictly constant tempo (such as with [[rubato]]) sometimes provide a BPM marking to indicate the general tempo.

Tempo is almost always measured in beats per minute (BPM). A metronome's tempo typically is adjustable from 40 to 208 BPM. Another mark that denotes tempo is M.M. (or MM), or Mälzel's Metronome. The notation M.M. is often followed by a note value and a number that indicates the tempo, as in {{nowrap|M.M. ♩ {{=}} 60}}.
Specific uses include:
* Learning to play tempos and beats consistently
* Practising technique (setting the metronome progressively to higher speeds or to expose slow-downs due to technical challenges)
* ''[[Click track]]s'' that recording musicians use to help audio-engineers synchronize audio tracks
*To maintain desired cadence in different physiological laboratory based tests&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mondal|first=Himel|last2=Mondal|first2=Shaikat|date=2018-07-01|title=Applicability of android application-based metronome in physiological tests|url=http://www.ijhas.in/article.asp?issn=2278-344X;year=2018;volume=7;issue=3;spage=159;epage=164;aulast=Mondal|journal=International Journal of Health &amp; Allied Sciences|language=en|volume=7|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standard appearance==
Metronome makers typically mark the speed adjustment for these common tempos:
* 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 54 56 58 60 63 66 69 72 76 80 84 88 92 96 100 104 108 112 116 120 126 132 138 144 152 160 168 176 184 192 200 208 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hindson.com.au/info/?s=metronome|title=Search Results for "metronome" – Matthew Hindson|author=|date=|website=hindson.com.au|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426212500/http://hindson.com.au/info/?s=metronome|archivedate=2014-04-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{listen|filename=50BPMclicktrack.ogg|title=Click track at 50 BPM, subdivided into sixteenth notes|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}

===Mechanical metronomes===
A mechanical metronome uses an adjustable weight on the end of an inverted [[pendulum]] rod to control tempo. The weight slides up the pendulum rod to decrease tempo, or down to increase tempo. (This mechanism is also called a double-weighted pendulum, because there is a second, fixed weight on the other side of the pendulum pivot, inside the metronome case.) The [[pendulum]] swings back and forth in tempo, while a mechanism inside the metronome produces a clicking sound with each oscillation. Mechanical metronomes don't need a [[electric battery|battery]], but run from a [[Mainspring|spring]]-wound [[clockwork]] escapement.

===Electronic metronomes===
[[File:Electronic-metronome(scale).jpg|200px|thumb|Electronic metronome, Wittner model]]
Most modern metronomes are [[Electronics|electronic]] and use a [[Crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]] to maintain accuracy, comparable to those used in wristwatches. The simplest electronic metronomes have a dial or buttons to control the tempo; some also produce tuning notes, usually around the range of [[A440 (pitch standard)|A440]] (440 [[hertz]]). Sophisticated metronomes can produce two or more distinct sounds. Tones can differ in pitch, volume, and/or timbre to demarcate [[Beat (music)#Downbeat|downbeats]] from other beats, as well as [[Time signature#Compound time signatures|compound]] and [[Unusual time signatures|complex]] [[time signature]]s.

Many [[Synthesizer|electronic musical keyboards]] have built-in metronome functions.

===Software metronomes===
Software metronomes run either as stand-alone applications on computers and smart phones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robertinventor.com/bmwiki/Big_list_of_Online_and_Desktop_Software_Metronomes|title=Big list of Windows and Online Metronomes - Bounce Metronome|author=|date=|website=robertinventor.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724223017/http://robertinventor.com/bmwiki/Big_list_of_Online_and_Desktop_Software_Metronomes|archivedate=2012-07-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in [[Music sequencer|music sequencing]] and audio [[Multitrack recording|multitrack]] software packages. In [[recording studio]] applications, such as [[film score|film scoring]], a software metronome may provide a [[click track]] to synchronize musicians.

====Metronome apps and click tracks====
Users of [[iPod]]s and other portable [[MP3 player]]s can use prerecorded MP3 metronome click tracks, which can use different sounds and samples instead of just the regular metronome beep. Users of smartphones can install a wide range of metronome apps. Either method avoids the need to bring a physical metronome along to lessons or practice sessions.

==Use of the metronome as an instrument==
Perhaps the most famous, and most direct, use of the metronome as an instrument is [[György Ligeti]]'s 1962 composition, ''[[Poème Symphonique for 100 metronomes]]''. Two years earlier, [[Toshi Ichiyanagi]] wrote ''[[Music for Electric Metronomes]]''. [[Maurice Ravel]] used three metronomes at different speeds for the opening of his opera ''[[L'heure espagnole]]'' (1911).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/17/ravels-parents-at-heart-of-his-operas "Getting to the heart of Ravel's opera double bill"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909185545/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/17/ravels-parents-at-heart-of-his-operas |date=2017-09-09 }} by Sanjoy Roy, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 17 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The clicking sounds of mechanical metronomes have sometimes been used to provide a soft [[rhythm]] track without using any [[Percussion instrument|percussion]]. [[Paul McCartney]] did this on "Distractions" (''[[Flowers in the Dirt]]''). Following the metronome, McCartney performed a rhythm track by hitting various parts of his body.&lt;ref&gt;''Flowers in the Dirt'' 1993 Reissue CD booklet; credited as "Metronome and body percussion".&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in [[Ennio Morricone]]'s theme "Farewell to Cheyenne" (featured on ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West (soundtrack)|Once Upon a Time in the West]]''), the steady clip-clop beat is provided by the deliberately distorted and slowed-down sound of a mechanical metronome.&lt;ref&gt;1995 Remastered and Expanded Edition CD booklet liner notes.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Kentridge]]'s "The Refusal of Time" (2012) features five metronomes in the video installation.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Kenneth, [http://www.sfgate.com/art/article/In-out-of-sync-with-William-Kentridge-s-Time-4961744.php "In, out of sync with William Kentridge's 'Time'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213164156/http://www.sfgate.com/art/article/In-out-of-sync-with-William-Kentridge-s-Time-4961744.php |date=2013-12-13 }}, ''SFGate.com'', November 6, 2013. Retrieved 2013-12-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on the metronome==

=== Positive view of the metronome ===
In the 20th century the metronome is usually positively viewed by performers, musicologists (who spend considerable time analyzing metronome markings), teachers and conservatories. The common view is reflected in the following quote:
{{quote|Because its beat is perfectly steady, the metronome is an excellent practice tool for musicians. Practicing with a metronome is extremely useful for developing and maintaining rhythmic precision, for learning to keep consistent tempos, for countering tendencies to slow down or speed up in specific passages, and for developing evenness and accuracy in rapid passages. Most music teachers consider the metronome indispensable, and most professional musicians, in fact, continue to practice with a metronome throughout their careers.|''The NPR Classical Music Companion'' (2005) &lt;ref name="The NPR Classical Music Companion 2005"&gt;{{Cite book

{{quote|Often, the metronome by itself may not be enough to learn complex rhythms. However, its importance for all types of practicing and all genres cannot be understated. The infallibility of the machine is a blessing since it removes guesswork; thus, the player can use the metronome to learn to play evenly and to resist the temptation to take extra time when playing a difficult passage. The player must begin with the premise that the metronome is mathematically perfect and categorically correct. From there, s/he must make a personal commitment to play exactly together with this perfect "chamber music partner."&lt;ref&gt;[http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-05132004-154411/ A Practical Guide To Twentieth-Century Violin Etudes With Performance And Theoretical Analysis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628013008/http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-05132004-154411/ |date=2010-06-28 }}; by Aaron M. Farrell&lt;/ref&gt;|''A Practical Guide To Twentieth-Century Violin Etudes With Performance And Theoretical Analysis''. Doctoral thesis (2004) by Aaron M. Farrell}}

Metronomes are often recommended to students without reservation:
{{quote|Before a student can be persuaded to use a metronome, he or she has to know why it is important. The most obvious answer is to help keep rhythms even and clean. Another reason is to keep the meter consistent, placing beats in their proper positions in the music. Metronomes can also help a student to find and fix problems. [...] The metronome quickly alerts the player to these problems by suddenly not clicking in time with the player's beats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.ithaca.edu/mauk/docs/makemetronomefriend.pdf|title=Make the Metronome Your Friend |author=Steven Mauk|date=|website=ithaca.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616093241/http://faculty.ithaca.edu/mauk/docs/makemetronomefriend.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;|"Make the Metronome Your Friend" by Professor Dr. Steven Mauk}}

{{quote|The objection, sometimes heard, that using a metronome tends to make a player mechanical, is not founded on facts. Indeed, the students who play the most artistically are those who have been the most faithful in the use of their metronome when learning their pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franzmfg.com/mtbook/MTBOOKch2.htm#c41|title=Metronome Techniques - Uses of the Metronome|author=|date=|website=www.franzmfg.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711023055/http://www.franzmfg.com/mtbook/MTBOOKch2.htm#c41|archivedate=2011-07-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Josephine Menuez, Etude, April, 1932}}

===Metronome, strict rhythm: modern performance practice===
The quotations above show the importance of the metronome in the 20th century ("Most music teachers consider the metronome indispensable, and most professional musicians, in fact, continue to practice with a metronome throughout their careers"&lt;ref name="The NPR Classical Music Companion 2005"/&gt;).

In the early 19th century the metronome was ''not'' used for ticking all through a piece, but only to check the tempo and then set it aside. This is in great contrast with many musicians today:

Heintze (Pendragon Press, 2000)}}

The metronome has been largely unquestioned in musical pedagogy or scholarship since the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781317156437/chapters/10.4324%2F9781315575308-13 Refashioning Rhythm: Hearing, Acting and Reacting to Metronomic Sound in Experimental Psychology and Beyond, c.1875–1920] by Alexander Bonus (see [https://books.google.com/books?id=qxiHDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT14&amp;lr&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PT104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false also])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of metronome use===
A metronome only provides a fixed, rigid, relentless pulse. Therefore, metronome markings on [[sheet music]] provide a reference, but cannot accurately communicate the [[pulse (music)|pulse]], [[swung note|swing]], or [[groove (music)|groove]] of music. The pulse is often irregular,&lt;ref&gt;Justin London. "[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/45964 Pulse]." In Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, (accessed July 28, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; e.g., in accelerando, rallentando, or in musical expression as in [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]] ([[Tempo rubato|rubato]], etc.).

Some argue that a metronomic performance stands in conflict with an expressive culturally-aware performance of music, so that a metronome is in this respect a very limited tool. Even such highly rhythmical musical forms as [[Samba]], if performed in correct cultural style, cannot be captured with the beats of a metronome.&lt;ref name="Batista" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Analyzing the earliest (pre-1930) samba recordings (e.g. Pelo Telefone from 1917), reveals strong differences with many of today's "samba" performances, many of which have a very different – sterile, modernist, metronomic ("corrupted") rhythm.&lt;/ref&gt; A style of performance that is unfailingly regular rhythmically might be criticized as being "metronomic."

Many notable composers, including [[Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Richard Wagner]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]] and [[Johannes Brahms]], criticised use of the metronome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.whitwellessays.com/docs/DOC_94.doc | title = Thoughts on Tempi | work = Essays on the Origins of Western Music | publisher = David Whitwell | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409172631/http://www.whitwellessays.com/docs/DOC_94.doc | archivedate = 2008-04-09 | df =  }}; quotes from Beethoven, Berlioz, and Liszt are referenced here.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many youngsters are surrounded by popular music that is rigid and inflexible in its rhythm, characterized by a relentless beat that is often synthesized or computerized.

==Metronome technique==

Metronome technique is extensive and has been the subject of several books.&lt;ref name="FranzBook"&gt;Frederick Franz, revised by Jon Truelson [http://www.franzmfg.com/mt.htm Metronome Techniques] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603054622/http://www.franzmfg.com/mt.htm |date=2012-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lewis's [http://www.rhythmsource.com/book/ Rhythm, What it is and how to improve your sense of it] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206024715/http://www.rhythmsource.com/book/ |date=2012-12-06 }} especially his book 2 [http://www.rhythmsource.com/booklets/ How to improve your sense of rhythm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206210357/http://www.rhythmsource.com/booklets/ |date=2012-12-06 }} {{ISBN|0975466704}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mac Santiago [http://www.inchronicity.com/ "Beyond the metronome"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221112557/http://www.inchronicity.com/ |date=2012-12-21 }} {{ISBN|1450731945}}&lt;/ref&gt; So this short section just summarizes some of the main ideas and approaches. &lt;!-- This section summarizes the material in the books and other sources. Most of this material can be found in the three books referred to above and other online sources. Will add a few links to particular chapters and pages in the books to make it easier to find the source material. If you know any other good references to add be sure to do so!--&gt; The "intuitive" approach to metronome practise, is to simply play along with a metronome. With metronome technique however, musicians do separate exercises to strengthen and steady their sense of rhythm and tempo, and increase their sensitivity to musical time and precision.

===Playing "in the pocket"===
[[File:Video for 2o4 at 60 bpm.ogv|thumb|2/4 at a tempo of 60 bpm. Following the visual bounce can help you to play in the pocket in a relaxed way]]
The basic skill required is the ability to play precisely in the pocket with the metronome in a relaxed fashion. This first step helps the musician to relate to the time of the metronome clearly and precisely at the millisecond level, to help internalize a similarly precise sense of time in yourself. It is not a goal in itself, and the aim is not particularly to be able to play like a metronome.

It is harder to play in the pocket with the metronome than one might expect, especially with piano or percussion. That's because the metronome click may seem to vanish when you hit the click exactly – or may be heard less distinctly. The further you are away from the click the more easily you hear the metronome. Musicians who attempt to play in the pocket with a metronome without use of the established techniques for doing this may find that it introduces tension and effort into their instrument technique.

To address these issues, musicians start by learning to play consistently ahead or behind the beat whenever they want to. As a result, they develop a clear sense of "where the click is" and so can also play to hit the click as well, in a relaxed way.

The other thing they do is to listen out to hear how the sound of their playing merges with the metronome to create a new sound when you play precisely in the pocket with the metronome. By listening in this way (and through other exercises) it is possible to play precisely in the pocket with the metronome in a relaxed fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Mac Santiago [http://www.inchronicity.com/ "Beyond the metronome"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221112557/http://www.inchronicity.com/ |date=2012-12-21 }} – see Lesson 4: Rhythmony&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Hess music corporation [http://tomhess.net/PracticingGuitarWithAMetronome.aspx How To Practice Guitar Effectively With And Without A Metronome] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028161446/http://tomhess.net/PracticingGuitarWithAMetronome.aspx |date=2012-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;StudyBass interactive online lessons: [http://www.studybass.com/lessons/rhythm/keeping-the-beat/ Keeping The Beat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119102227/http://www.studybass.com/lessons/rhythm/keeping-the-beat/ |date=2012-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Krimmel (guitar builder) [http://www.maxkrimmel.com/ShonaMusic/Misc.Music/MetronomeCourse.html Online Metronome Course] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106234409/http://www.maxkrimmel.com/ShonaMusic/Misc.Music/MetronomeCourse.html |date=2012-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time as they work on playing in the pocket, they also work on flexibility and the ability to play in the same precise way anywhere in the beat.

===Precision of timing and sensitivity to musical time===

[[File:Video-of-2o4-at-60-bpm-with-go-silent-briefly.theora.ogv|thumb|2/4 at 60 bpm. Plays 5 measures then goes silent for 2, 3, 4, and 8 measures (alternating with 2 measures played). Play in the pocket with the click. Are you still in the pocket when the metronome comes back on? One of the exercises in metronome technique to help internalize a precise sense of time and tempo.]]

Many exercises are used to help with precision of timing and sensitivity to time, also independence, to make sure you don't become too dependent to the metronome. These exercises include:

* Set the metronome to go silent for a number of measures, and see if you are still in time when it comes back on again
* Set it to go silent for increasingly longer time periods and see if you are still in time&lt;ref&gt;Mac Santiago [http://www.inchronicity.com/ "Beyond the metronome"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221112557/http://www.inchronicity.com/ |date=2012-12-21 }} – see Chapter 3: The Diminishing Click particularly&lt;/ref&gt;
* Play through music in your mind's ear, and try to do keep in time with the metronome as you do so
* Practise subdividing the beat, with the metronome set to a slow tempo, including set to click on the measure beat, every second measure, the second beat of the measure instead of the first (or the second and fourth, technique used for jazz), set to click every 5 beats for a rhythm in 4/4, and so on.
* Playing displaced clicks&lt;ref&gt;Mac Santiago [http://www.inchronicity.com/ "Beyond the metronome"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221112557/http://www.inchronicity.com/ |date=2012-12-21 }} – see Lesson 7: Being Inchronouse around the Click&lt;/ref&gt;
* Playing polyrhythmically with the metronome

And many other exercises. Much of modern metronome technique is to do with various methods to help resolve timing issues, and to encourage and develop a clear sense of musical time and to help with precision of timing.

This steadiness and precision you can develop and encourage through metronome technique does no harm to musical expression in timing and rhythm; indeed one of the motivations is to help with nuances of timing and tempo. An analogy with art may help. It's like [[Giotto#Early years|Giotto's circle]], or [[Apelles#Biography|Apelles' straight line]], if you can play a perfectly steady and precise beat, it helps with nuances of timing., It doesn't mean that you can only play perfectly steady beats, just as Giotto or Apelles impressive displays of technique didn't mean that they could only draw circles and straight lines. 
&lt;!-- Hope it is okay to use this circle drawing analogy here. So far I haven't yet found a book or article that uses this analogy except for one reference – but it helps to explain the approach so well. The only ref I found is this one: "Then and only then, after they had learned to draw a perfect circle, they were permitted to make certain changes which brought about expression. At this point I had them get Christiani's Principles of Expression and work out their own conception of expression according to their original ideas, always giving them counsel." which is a rather different approach too.

===Musically expressive rhythms===

Modern metronome technique addresses the issues of expressive musical rhythms in many ways. For instance, much of the focus of modern metronome technique is on encouraging and developing a good sense of tempo and timing in your playing, and in your mind. So you may work with the metronome in separate exercises to achieve this. When you have a more precise sense of the passage of time, you can then choose for yourself how to use this in your musical performance. You still play in a musically expressive fashion with continually changing tempo and beat; the only difference is that as a result of your work on precision of timing with use of a metronome, you are more aware of what you are doing..

 {{quotation| To be an artist one must be able to play in perfect time – slow, fast, or anywhere between. Then one must be able to leave the time at will. This is not the same as having the time leave the player, and that is the effect if one is not able to play with the metronome.&lt;ref&gt;''M.L. Carr, Violin World, March, 1896''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Special metronome exercises are used to help keep this fluid sense of rhythm and timing as you work with the metronome. There are many of them, they include:

* Drift gradually from one beat to the next and play polyrhythmically with the metronome
* Play beats ahead or behind the click – and get comfortable with playing anywhere relative to the metronome click.
* As you play with the metronome start from a pulse unison and gradually push your notes ahead of the click then pull back again to pulse unison (also the other way pulling behind the pulse) &lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lewis [http://www.rhythmsource.com/booklets/ Book 4: Rhythm in Performance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206210357/http://www.rhythmsource.com/booklets/ |date=2012-12-06 }} – see the section on Fluidity and Flexibility and the various Flexibility exercises particularly&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time you can work on developing a higher level of awareness of the many natural rhythms in your everyday life and use exercises to help bring those rhythms into your music.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lewis [http://www.rhythmsource.com/booklets/ Book 2: How to Improve your Sense of Rhythm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206210357/http://www.rhythmsource.com/booklets/ |date=2012-12-06 }} – see the section on "Improving Pulse and Rhythm Through Motion and Action" particularly&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Time Feel, the subject of Chapter 7, is one of the great keys to musicality for rhythm section instruments. But being able to play behind or ahead of the pulse can also add expression to a melodic line. This, along with slight changes in dynamics, creates phrasing in music. The ability to hear the pulse and yet accelerate or decelerate slightly is a great way to incorporate human feeling into a musical performance. Of course, this is all relative to the tempo, and is best achieved relative to a steady tempo. In other words, the more definite your sense of pulse, the better your capability to manipulate it. This also works for the actions of ritardando and accelerando, as they are relative to a steady pulse and are best performed gradually rather than in sudden shifts"&lt;ref&gt;Mac Santiago "Beyond the Metronome" 2010, Chapter 8, page 39&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In this way, with suitable metronome techniques, use of a metronome helps you to improve your sense of time and exact timing without causing any of the expected issues for musicality and expressive timing. The thing to bear in mind all the way through is that you use the metronome to help with exact timing – but that the sense of rhythm and musically expressive timing is something that comes from yourself. Rhythm is natural to human beings and pervades our lives, though you may need help to bring that rhythm into music. As Andrew Lewis says in his book:

{{quotation | Rhythm is everywhere. Be sensitive to it, and stay aware of spontaneous occurrences that can spur rhythmic development. Listen all the time and use your imagination. Become a rhythm antenna.&lt;ref name="RhythmSourceBookII"/&gt;}}

An exact sense of the passage of time doesn't come to humans so naturally (sometimes time may seem to pass quickly and sometimes more slowly) and that's where the metronome can help most. That's how the teachers of metronome technique referenced here think of the tool – as a way to increase your sensitivity to musical time, and develop greater precision of timing and a clearer sense of the passage of musical time – relative to which musicians can then use expressive, natural and fluid rhythms, with as much rubato and tempo variance as they wish for.

==Alternatives to metronome use==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2012}} &lt;!-- I've done the best I can - but found surprisingly little on it in my reference searches. Do say if you have any extra citations. Especially useful if you know of is any material available specifically on how you work on rhythms and tempo without use of a metronome - or any more on the interesting ideas of Entasis etc in the second half of this section --&gt;
If a musician decides not to use a metronome, other methods are required to deal with timing and tempo glitches, and rushing and dragging without its help. These ideas may also be useful as a complementary approach along with metronome technique.

One starting point is to notice that we rely on a sense of rhythm to perform ordinary activities such as walking, running, hammering nails or chopping vegetables. Even speech and thought has a rhythm of sorts. So one way to work on rhythms is to work on bringing these into music, becoming a "rhythm antenna" in Andrew Lewis's words.&lt;ref name="RhythmSourceBookII"&gt;Andrew Lewis [http://www.rhythmsource.com/book/ Rhythm – What it is and How to Improve Your Sense of It] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206024715/http://www.rhythmsource.com/book/ |date=2012-12-06 }}, book II How to Improve Your Sense of Rhythm – A practical step-by-step guide to developing and strengthening rhythm and inner pulse, page 55 "Improving Pulse and Rhythm Using Nature and Aspects of Daily Life"&lt;/ref&gt; Until the nineteenth century in Europe, people used to sing as they worked, in time to the rhythms of their work. Musical rhythms were part of daily life, [[Cecil Sharp]] collected some of these songs before they were forgotten. For more about this see [[Work song]] and [[Sea shanty|Sea shanties]]. In many parts of the world music is an important part of daily life even today. There are many accounts of people (especially tribal people) who sing frequently and spontaneously in their daily life, as they work, and as they engage in other activities.

{{quotation|"Benny Wenda, a Lani man from the highlands, is a Papuan leader now in exile in the UK, and a singer. There are songs for everything, he says: songs for climbing a mountain, songs for the fireside, songs for gardening. "Since people are interconnected with the land, women will sing to the seed of the sweet potato as they plant it, so the earth will be happy." Meanwhile, men will sing to the soil until it softens enough to dig." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/2011/mar/15/west-papua-singing-freedom-indonesia|title=Songs and freedom in West Papua|first=Jay|last=Griffiths|date=15 March 2011|website=the Guardian|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010010616/https://www.theguardian.com/global/2011/mar/15/west-papua-singing-freedom-indonesia|archivedate=10 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Musicians may also work on strengthening their sense of pulse using inner sources, such as breath, and subdividing breaths. Or work with the imagination, imagining a pulse. They may also work with their heart beat, and rhythms in their chest muscles in the same way.&lt;ref name="RhythmSourceBookII" /&gt;

Another thing they do is to play music in their mind's ear along with the rhythms of walking or other daily life rhythms. Other techniques include hearing music in ones mind's ear first before playing it. Musicians can deal with timing and tempo glitches by learning to hear a perfect performance in their mind's ear first.

In some styles of music such as early music notes inégales (according to one minority view interpretation) it can be appropriate to use a different approach that doesn't work so much with a sense of inner pulse and instead works on ideas of gestures and is more closely related to rhythms of speech and poetry. Ideas from this approach can be useful for all styles of music.

The basic ideas are:
* Notes should be subtly unequal – having no three notes the same helps to keep the music alive and interesting and helps prevent any feeling of sameness and boredom in the music – the idea of "Entasis"
{{quotation|This technique is especially challenging in its application, because musicians today are so rigidly trained in metrical regularity. Yet, like the beating of the heart, the musical pulse needs to fluctuate in speed as the emotional content of the music fluctuates. Like the natural shifting accents in speech, musical accents need to shift according to the meaning being expressed. To feel perfect, music must be metrically imperfect. }}
* Notes and musical phrases can be organized in gestures – particular patterns of rhythm that come naturally – rather than strict measures.
* Individual notes can be delayed slightly – when you expect a particular note e.g. at the end of a musical phrase – just waiting a moment or two before playing the note:
{{quotation|The cognitive partner of hesitation is anticipation: anticipation is created by building up assumption on assumption about what will happen. When the event which should occur fails to happen at the expected time, there exists a moment of disappointment. Disappointment, however, is soon transformed into a rush of pleasure when the anticipated event is consummated. The art is always in the timing.}}
* Notes played together can be allowed to go somewhat out of time with each other in a care-free fashion "Sans souci".
{{quotation | When the alignment of notes in the score suggests that they be performed strictly and simultaneously, they may be purposely jumbled or played in an irregular or a staggering manner to create a careless (sans souci) effect. This technique gives music a feeling of relaxed effortlessness}}

This just touches on some of the ideas; for more details, see "The Craft of Musical Communication".&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Ploger and Keith Hill [http://www.musicalratio.com/gpage.html The Craft of Musical Communication] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121135320/http://www.musicalratio.com/gpage.html |date=2013-01-21 }} Orphei Organi Antiqui 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a minority view on interpretation of this style of music, but well worth a mention here because of its different approach to musical time and rhythm, and its relevance to the way rhythms can be practised. The more generally accepted view is that [[Notes inégales]] were played with the same amount of swing nearly all the time, like modern Jazz.

'''Natural-gas processing''' is a complex industrial process designed to clean raw natural gas by separating impurities and various [[volatile organic compound|non-methane hydrocarbons]] and fluids to produce what is known as ''pipeline quality'' dry natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/FactSheets/FSNaturalGasProcessingPlants.htm|title=PHMSA: Stakeholder Communications - NG Processing Plants|author=|date=|website=primis.phmsa.dot.gov|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural-gas processing begins at the well head. The composition of the raw natural gas extracted from producing wells depends on the type, depth, and location of the underground deposit and the geology of the area. Oil and natural gas are often found together in the same reservoir. The natural gas produced from oil wells is generally classified as ''associated-dissolved'', meaning that the natural gas is associated with or dissolved in crude oil. Natural gas production absent any association with crude oil is classified as “non-associated.” In 2009, 89 percent of U.S. wellhead production of natural gas was non-associated.&lt;ref&gt;https://mitei.mit.edu/system/files/NaturalGas_Chapter2_Supply.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural-gas processing plants purify raw [[natural gas]] by removing common contaminants such as water, [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S). Some of the substances which contaminate natural gas have economic value and are further processed or sold. A fully operational plant delivers pipeline-quality dry natural gas that can be used as [[fuel]] by residential, commercial and industrial consumers.

==Types of raw-natural-gas wells==
Raw natural gas comes primarily from any one of three types of wells: crude oil wells, gas wells, and condensate wells.

Natural gas that comes from crude oil wells is typically called ''associated gas''. This gas can have existed as a gas cap above the crude oil in the underground formation, or could have been dissolved in the crude oil.

Natural gas from gas wells and from condensate wells, in which there is little or no crude oil, is called ''non-associated gas''. Gas wells typically produce only raw natural gas, while condensate wells produce raw natural gas along with other low molecular weight hydrocarbons. Those that are liquid at ambient conditions (i.e., [[pentane]] and heavier) are called ''[[natural-gas condensate]]'' (sometimes also called ''[[natural gasoline]]'' or simply ''condensate'').

Natural gas is called ''sweet gas'' when relatively free of [[hydrogen sulfide]]; gas that does contain hydrogen sulfide is called ''[[sour gas]]''. Natural gas, or any other gas mixture, containing significant quantities of hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide or similar acidic gases, is called ''[[acid gas]].''

Raw natural gas can also come from methane deposits in the pores of coal seams, and especially in a more concentrated state of [[adsorption]] onto the surface of the coal itself. Such gas is referred to as ''coalbed gas'' or ''[[coalbed methane]]'' (''[[coal seam gas]]'' in Australia). Coalbed gas has become an important source of energy in recent decades.

==Contaminants in raw natural gas==
{{see also|Natural-gas condensate}}
Raw natural gas typically consists primarily of [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), the shortest and lightest [[hydrocarbon]] molecule. It also contains varying amounts of:
* Heavier gaseous hydrocarbons: [[ethane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), [[propane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;), [[butane|normal butane]] (n-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;), [[isobutane]] (i-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;), [[pentane]]s and even higher [[molecular weight]] hydrocarbons. When processed and purified into finished by-products, all of these are collectively referred to as Natural Gas Liquids or '''NGL'''.
* [[Acid gas]]es: [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) and [[mercaptan]]s such as [[methanethiol]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SH) and [[ethanethiol]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;SH).
* Other gases: [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[helium]] (He).
* Water: [[water vapor]] and liquid water. Also dissolved salts and dissolved gases (acids).
* Liquid hydrocarbons: perhaps some [[natural-gas condensate]] (also referred to as ''casinghead gasoline'' or ''natural gasoline'') and/or [[crude oil]].
* [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]: very small amounts of mercury primarily in elemental form, but chlorides and other species are possibly present.&lt;ref name=UOPHg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uop.com/objects/87MercuryRemoval.pdf|title=Mercury Removal from Natural Gas and Liquids|publisher=UOP LLC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101194809/http://www.uop.com/objects/87MercuryRemoval.pdf|archivedate=2011-01-01|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Naturally occurring radioactive material]] (NORM): natural gas may contain [[radon]], and the [[produced water]] may contain dissolved traces of [[radium]], which can accumulate within piping and processing equipment.{{cn|date = September 2013}}  This can render piping and equipment radioactive over time.

The raw natural gas must be purified to meet the quality standards specified by the major [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] transmission and distribution companies. Those quality standards vary from pipeline to pipeline and are usually a function of a pipeline system's design and the markets that it serves. In general, the standards specify that the natural gas:
* Be within a specific range of heating value (caloric value). For example, in the United States, it should be about 1035 ± 5% [[British thermal unit|BTU]] per cubic foot of gas at 1 atmosphere and 60°F (41 [[Megajoule|MJ]] ± 5% per cubic metre of gas at 1 atmosphere and 15.6°C).
* Be delivered at or above a specified [[hydrocarbon dew point]] temperature (below which some of the hydrocarbons in the gas might condense at pipeline pressure forming liquid slugs that could damage the pipeline).
* Dew-point adjustment serves the reduction of the concentration of water and heavy hydrocarbons in natural gas to such an extent that no condensation occurs during the ensuing transport in the pipelines
* Be free of particulate solids and liquid water to prevent erosion, corrosion or other damage to the pipeline.
* Be dehydrated of water vapor sufficiently to prevent the formation of methane hydrates within the gas processing plant or subsequently within the sales gas transmission pipeline. A typical water content specification in the U.S. is that gas must contain no more than seven pounds of water per million [[Standard cubic foot|standard cubic feet]] (MMSCF) of gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipt.ntnu.no/~jsg/undervisning/naturgass/parlaktuna/Chap7.pdf Dehydration of Natural Gas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224110924/http://www.ipt.ntnu.no/~jsg/undervisning/naturgass/parlaktuna/Chap7.pdf |date=2007-02-24 }} by Prof. Jon Steiner Gudmundsson, Norwegian University of Science and Technology&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ProcessGroup&gt;[http://www.processgroup.com.au/Technologies/GasProcessing/GlycolDehyrdation/tabid/84/Default.aspx Glycol Dehydration] (includes a flow diagram)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Contain no more than trace amounts of components such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, mercaptans, and nitrogen. The most common specification for hydrogen sulfide content is 0.25 [[Grain (unit)|grain]] H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S per 100 cubic feet of gas, or approximately 4 ppm. Specifications for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; typically limit the content to no more than two or three percent.
* Maintain mercury at less than detectable limits (approximately 0.001 [[Parts per billion|ppb]] by volume) primarily to avoid damaging equipment in the gas processing plant or the pipeline transmission system from mercury amalgamation and embrittlement of aluminum and other metals.&lt;ref name=UOPHg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tigg.com/ACTIVATED-CARBON/desulfurization.html ''Desulfurization of and Mercury Removal From Natural Gas''] by Bourke, M.J. and Mazzoni, A.F., Laurance Reid Gas Conditioning Conference, Norman, Oklahoma, March 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaschem.com/mercur.html Using Gas Geochemistry to Assess Mercury Risk], OilTracers, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of a natural-gas processing plant==

There are a great many ways in which to configure the various [[unit process]]es used in the processing of raw natural gas. The [[Process flow diagram|block flow diagram]] below is a generalized, typical configuration for the processing of raw natural gas from non-associated gas wells. It shows how raw natural gas is processed into sales gas pipelined to the end user markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/feature_articles/2006/ngprocess/ngprocess.pdf ''Natural Gas Processing: The Crucial Link Between Natural Gas Production and Its Transportation to Market''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304003407/http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/feature_articles/2006/ngprocess/ngprocess.pdf |date=2011-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uop.com/gasprocessing/6070.html ''Example Gas Plant''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201015907/http://uop.com/gasprocessing/6070.html |date=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axens.net/upload/presentations/fichier/axens_gpagcc_2004v2.pdf ''From Purification to Liquefaction Gas Processing''] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5nhzCYCzS?url=http://www.axens.net/upload/presentations/fichier/axens_gpagcc_2004v2.pdf |date=2010-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spe.org/specma/binary/files/5804785Syn10682.pdf|title=''Feed-Gas Treatment Design for the Pearl GTL Project''|author=|date=|website=spe.org|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lnglicensing.conocophillips.com/EN/publications/documents/AICHELNGNGLIntegrationPaper.pdf''Benefits of integrating NGL extraction and LNG liquefaction''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626080757/http://lnglicensing.conocophillips.com/EN/publications/documents/AICHELNGNGLIntegrationPaper.pdf |date=2013-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also shows how processing of the raw natural gas yields these byproducts:

*[[Natural-gas condensate]]
*[[Sulfur]]
*Ethane
*[[Natural gas liquids]] (NGL): propane, butanes and C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;+  (which is the commonly used term for pentanes plus higher molecular weight hydrocarbons)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conocophillips.com/sustainable-development/Documents/SMID_213_Natural%20Gas%20Liquids.pdf|title=MSDS: Natural gas liquids|publisher=ConocoPhillips}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=5930|title=What are natural gas liquids and how are they used?|date=April 20, 2012|publisher=United States Energy Information Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://setxind.com/energy-markets/guide-to-understanding-natural-gas-and-natural-gas-liquids/|title=

Raw natural gas is commonly collected from a group of adjacent wells and is first processed at that collection point for removal of free liquid water and natural gas condensate. The condensate is usually then transported to an oil refinery and the water is disposed of as wastewater.

The raw gas is then pipelined to a gas processing plant where the initial purification is usually the removal of acid gases (hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide). There are many processes that are available for that purpose as shown in the flow diagram, but [[Amine gas treating|amine treating]] is the process that was historically used. However, due to a range of performance and environmental constraints of the amine process, a newer technology based on the use of polymeric membranes to separate the carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide from the natural gas stream has gained increasing acceptance.  Membranes are attractive since no reagents are consumed.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, R. W.  "Future Directions of Membrane Gas Separation Technology" Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2002, volume 41, pages 1393-1411. {{DOI|10.1021/ie0108088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acid gases, if present, are removed by membrane or amine treating can then be routed into a sulfur recovery unit which converts the hydrogen sulfide in the acid gas into either elemental sulfur or sulfuric acid. Of the processes available for these conversions, the [[Claus process]] is by far the most well known for recovering elemental sulfur, whereas the conventional [[Contact process]] and the WSA ([[Wet sulfuric acid process]]) are the most used technologies for recovering [[sulfuric acid]]. 

The residual gas from the Claus process is commonly called ''tail gas'' and that gas is then processed in a tail gas treating unit (TGTU) to recover and recycle residual sulfur-containing compounds back into the Claus unit. Again, as shown in the flow diagram, there are a number of processes available for treating the Claus unit tail gas and for that purpose a WSA process is also very suitable since it can work autothermally on tail gases.

The next step in the gas processing plant is to remove water vapor from the gas using either the regenerable [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] in liquid [[triethylene glycol]] (TEG),&lt;ref name=ProcessGroup/&gt; commonly referred to as [[glycol dehydration]], deliquescent chloride desiccants, and or a [[Pressure Swing Adsorption]] (PSA) unit which is regenerable [[adsorption]] using a solid adsorbent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uop.com/objects/96%20MolecularSieves.pdf Molecular Sieves] (includes a flow diagram of a PSA unit)&lt;/ref&gt; Other newer processes like [[Membrane technology|membrane]]s may also be considered.

Mercury is then removed by using adsorption processes (as shown in the flow diagram) such as [[activated carbon]] or regenerable [[molecular sieve]]s.&lt;ref name=UOPHg/&gt;

Although not common, nitrogen is sometimes removed and rejected using one of the three processes indicated on the flow diagram:

*[[Cryogenic]] process ([[Nitrogen Rejection Unit]]),&lt;ref&gt;''Gas Processes 2002'', Hydrocarbon Processing, pages 84–86, May 2002 (schematic flow diagrams and descriptions of the Nitrogen Rejection and Nitrogen Removal processes)&lt;/ref&gt; using low temperature [[continuous distillation|distillation]]. This process can be modified to also recover helium, if desired (see also [[industrial gas]]).
*Absorption process,&lt;ref name=GPTechnologies&gt;[http://www.aet.com/gtip1.htm ''Market-Driven Evolution of Gas Processing Technologies for NGLs ''] Advanced Extraction Technology Inc. website page&lt;/ref&gt; using lean oil or a special solvent&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aet.com/aetnrubig.pdf AET Process Nitrogen Rejection Unit] Advanced Extraction Technology Inc. website page&lt;/ref&gt; as the absorbent.
*Adsorption process, using activated carbon or molecular sieves as the adsorbent. This process may have limited applicability because it is said to incur the loss of butanes and heavier hydrocarbons.

The next step is to recover the natural gas liquids (NGL) for which most large, modern gas processing plants use another cryogenic low temperature distillation process involving expansion of the gas through a [[turbo-expander]] followed by distillation in a demethanizing [[fractionating column]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aet.com/turbo.htm ''Cryogenic Turbo-Expander Process''] Advanced Extraction Technology Inc. website page&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Gas Processes 2002'', Hydrocarbon Processing, pages 83–84, May 2002 (schematic flow diagrams and descriptions of the NGL-Pro and NGL Recovery processes)&lt;/ref&gt; Some gas processing plants use lean oil absorption process&lt;ref name=GPTechnologies/&gt; rather than the cryogenic turbo-expander process.

The recovered NGL stream is sometimes processed through a fractionation train consisting of three distillation towers in series: a deethanizer, a depropanizer and a debutanizer. The overhead product from the deethanizer is ethane and the bottoms are fed to the depropanizer. The overhead product from the depropanizer is propane and the bottoms are fed to the debutanizer. The overhead product from the debutanizer is a mixture of normal and iso-butane, and the bottoms product is a C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;+ mixture. The recovered streams of propane, butanes and C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;+ may be "sweetened" in a [[Merox]] process unit to convert undesirable mercaptans into [[disulfide]]s and, along with the recovered ethane, are the final NGL by-products from the gas processing plant. Currently, most cryogenic plants do not include fractionation for economic reasons, and the NGL stream is instead transported as a mixed product to standalone fractionation complexes located near refineries or chemical plants that use the components for [[feedstock]]. In case laying pipeline is not possible for geographical reason,or the distance between source and consumer exceed 3000&amp;nbsp;km, natural gas is then transported by ship as [[LNG]] (liquefied natural gas) and again converted into its gaseous state in the vicinity of the consumer.

The residue gas from the NGL recovery section is the final, purified sales gas which is pipelined to the end-user markets. Rules and agreements are made between buyer and seller regarding the quality of the gas. These usually specify the maximum allowable concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O as well as requiring the gas to be commercially free from objectionable odours and materials, and dust or other solid or liquid matter, waxes, gums and gum forming constituents, which might damage or adversely affect operation of the buyers equipment. When an upset occurs on the treatment plant buyers can usually refuse to accept the gas, lower the flow rate or re-negotiate the price.

===Helium recovery===
If the gas has significant helium content, the helium may be recovered by fractional distillation. Natural gas may contain as much as 7% helium, and is the commercial source of the noble gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Winter, Mark| title = Helium: the essentials| publisher = University of Sheffield|year = 2008| url = http://www.webelements.com/helium/| accessdate = 2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the [[Hugoton Gas Field]] in Kansas and Oklahoma in the United States contains concentrations of helium from 0.3% to 1.9%, which is separated out as a valuable byproduct.&lt;ref&gt;Dwight E. Ward and Arthur P. Pierce (1973) "Helium" in ''United States Mineral Resources'', US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 820, p.285-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumption==
Natural gas consumption patterns, across nations, vary based on access. Countries with large reserves tend to handle the raw-material natural gas more generously, while countries with scarce or lacking resources tend to be more economical. Despite the considerable findings, the predicted availability of the natural-gas reserves has hardly changed.

==Applications of natural gas==
*Fuel for industrial heating and [[desiccation]] process
*Fuel for the operation of public and industrial power stations
*Household fuel for cooking, heating and providing hot water
*Fuel for environmentally friendly compressed or liquid natural gas vehicles
*Raw material for [[chemical synthesis]]
*Raw material for large-scale fuel production using [[gas-to-liquid]] (GTL) process (e.g. to produce sulphur-and aromatic-free diesel with low-emission combustion)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9044">The '''Pacific Manuscripts Bureau''' is a non-profit organisation sponsored by an international consortium of libraries specialising in Pacific research. The Pacific Manuscripts Bureau was formed in 1968 to copy archives, manuscripts and rare printed material relating to the Pacific Islands. The aim of the Bureau is to help with long-term preservation of the documentary heritage of the Pacific Islands and to make it accessible.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/pambu/|title=Pacific Manuscripts Bureau ANU College of Asia &amp; the Pacific|last=|first=|date=|website=Pacific Manuscripts Bureau|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Background ===
Pacific scholar [[Henry Evans Maude|Harry E. Maude]], Department of Pacific History at the [[Australian National University]] from 1958, was the first to conceptualise the workings of the Bureau when he discussed the need for interlibrary co-operation in the copying of documents of Pacific interest for Pacific researchers with Dr Floyd Cammack, [[University of Hawaii]] in December 1962.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pacific Manuscripts Bureau: pros and cons of its continuance after 15 April 1986|last=Langon|first=Robert|publisher=Pacific Manuscripts Bureau|year=1985|isbn=|location=Canberra|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=PAMBU: 40 years of archival collaboration in the Pacific Islands|last=Maidment|first=Ewan|publisher=Paper for PARBICA, ARANZ, ASA Conference, Brisbane, 12–17 October 2009|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr Cammack proposed an association of Pacific research libraries and contacted potential members, winning support from Gordon Richardson, Mitchell Librarian and Principal Librarian of the [[State Library of New South Wales|NSW Public Library]]. In 1966 Richardson pursued the idea of a joint copying scheme and with the University of Hawaii requested Maude produce a paper to make the scheme a reality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Maude’s Paper entitled: The Documentary Basis for Pacific Studies: a Report on Progress and Desiderata, was released in March 1967. It proposed setting up a Pacific Islands Manuscripts Clearing Centre to identify and obtain microfilm copies of unpublished documents on the [[Pacific Islands]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cunningham|first=Adrian|date=19 May 1995|title=The Pacific Manuscripts Bureau: History and Recent Developments|url=|journal=Australian Academic &amp; Research Libraries|volume=26:4|pages=237–242|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Establishment ===
Maude’s Paper recommended the proposed Pacific Islands Manuscripts Clearing Centre be established at the Australian National University (ANU), the only institution in the world at that time with a Department of Pacific History. The Australian National University supported Maude’s proposal and invited the [[National Library of Australia]], [[National Library of New Zealand]], the Mitchell Library ([[State Library of New South Wales]]), and the [[Center for Pacific Islands Studies|University of Hawaii]] to sponsor and establish the Centre effective 1 January 1968.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Pacific Islands Manuscripts Clearing Centre was declared fully operational under the name Pacific Manuscripts Bureau on 1 July 1968 with [[Robert Adrian Langdon|Robert Langdon]], then editor of the ''[[Pacific Islands Monthly]]'', appointed to manage the Bureau.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The aim of the Bureau is to help with long-term [[Media preservation|preservation]] of the documentary heritage of the Pacific Islands and to make it accessible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Pacific Islands Archives ===
To this end the Bureau undertakes [[fieldwork]] in the Pacific Islands to copy archives, manuscripts and rare printed material, particularly when the material is in danger of loss or destruction. Island based records have been identified as most at risk due to climatic factors and lack of trained staff to care for them.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Fieldwork reports can be found on the Bureau’s website.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== International Pacific Island Collections ===
The Bureau has an interest in copying archives relating to the Pacific in major collections throughout the world, including member libraries. An earlier co-operative [[microfilm]]ing project, The Australian Joint Copying Project, achieved some success. In its 45 year history it microfilmed a large number of Pacific manuscripts in the United Kingdom, many identified by Mitchell Librarian, [[Phyllis Mander-Jones]] during the 1960’s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manuscripts in the British Isles relating to Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific|last=Mander-Jones|first=Phyllis|publisher=Australian National University Press|year=1972|isbn=0708104509|location=Canberra|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==
The Bureau is based at the Australian National University in the College of Asia and the Pacific and is sponsored by an international consortium of Pacific research libraries. Each member Library has the complete PMB Collection.

The Libraries are:

* [[State Library of New South Wales|Mitchell Library, State Library of NSW, Sydney]]
* [[National Library of Australia]], Canberra
* [[Australian National University Library|The Library, Australian National University]], Canberra
* [[Alexander Turnbull Library]], Wellington
* [[University of Auckland Library]]
* [[Hocken Library]], [[University of Otago]], Dunedin
* Library of the University of Hawaii, Honolulu
* [[Geisel Library|Library of the University of California, San Diego]]
* [[Yale University Library]], New Haven
* [[University of Michigan Library]], Ann Arbor
* [[University of Bergen|University of Bergen Library]], Bergen
* [[University of the South Pacific]]
* [[National University of Samoa]], Apia &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Collections ==

=== Content ===
The Pacific Manuscripts Bureau collection is the most extensive collection of non-government primary documentation on the Pacific Islands available to researchers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Archive includes in excess of 4000 microfilm reels comprising a diverse range of records, copied from following documents:

* Community associations and NGO's
* Genealogies and family records
* Grammars, vocabularies, dictionaries
* Letters diaries notebooks
* Mission and church records
* Newspapers, newsletters and other serials
* Papers of political parties, trade unions, environmental organisations, women’s groups
* Papers of regional organisations
* Plantation, mining, trading, shipping and other business records
* Scientific and medical papers &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Format ===
The Pacific Manuscripts Bureau microfilm collection is divided into three series:

==== Manuscript Series (PMB) ====
Unpublished records of organisations and people associated with the Pacific Islands. Records include manuscripts, diaries, minutes, correspondence, linguistic materials and research papers.

==== Printed Document Series (PMB Doc) ====
Published material including newspapers, newsletters and other serials published by organisations with interests in the Pacific Islands.

==== Oceania Marist Province Archives Series (OMPA) ====
Records of the Catholic Church in islands of the Western Pacific. Includes all six dioceses: Tonga, Samoa and Tokelau, Wallis and Futuna, Port Vila, Noumea, Suva. The records are indexed in the guide: ''The Catholic Church in the Western Pacific: a guide to records on microfilm''. The catalogue has been digitised and can be accessed on the Bureau's website.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Pacific Manuscripts Bureau collection also includes audio and photographic collections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Access to the Records ==

=== Online catalogue ===
Access to the collection is via the Pacific Manuscripts Bureau online catalogue. This can be freely searched on the Internet by researchers to find relevant documents. Most of these documents are microfilm copies of originals held in archives and libraries throughout the Pacific. However, the Bureau is in the process of digitising its microfilm collections. Member libraries have access to these digital collections via the PMB catalogue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Finding Aids ===
The Bureau publishes finding aids to assist researchers in accessing PMB collections. These include subject guides and country specific guides including Fiji, Vanuatu and the Cook Islands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Publications ===
The newsletter, Pambu, has been published since the Bureau’s inception in 1968. Pambu reports on the Bureau’s microfilming projects and fieldtrips as well as advertising books on the Pacific and publishing articles by Pacific scholars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A '''phasor measurement unit''' (PMU) is a device used to estimate the magnitude and phase angle of an electrical Phasor quantity like voltage or current in the [[Grid (electricity)|electricity grid]] using a common time source for synchronization. Time synchronization is usually provided by GPS and allows synchronized real-time measurements of multiple remote measurement points on the grid. PMUs are capable of capturing samples from a waveform in quick succession and reconstruct the Phasor quantity. The resulting measurement is known as a '''synchrophasor'''. These devices can also be used to measure the frequency in the power grid. A typical commercial PMU can report measurements with very high temporal resolution in the order of 30-60 measurements per second. This helps engineers in analyzing dynamic events in the grid which is not possible with traditional [[SCADA]] measurements that generate one measurement every 2 or 4 seconds. Therefore, PMUs equip utilities with enhanced monitoring and control capabilities and are considered to be one of the most important measuring devices in the future of power systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==History==
In 1893, [[Charles Proteus Steinmetz]]&lt;!--Steinmetz article should tie to phasor theory, and mention this article jjm --&gt; presented a paper on simplified mathematical description of the waveforms of alternating current electricity.  Steinmetz called his representation a [[phasor (sine waves)|phasor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the invention of phasor measurement units (PMU) in 1988 by [[Arun G. Phadke|Dr. Arun G. Phadke]] and [[James Thorp|Dr. James S. Thorp]] at Virginia Tech, Steinmetz’s technique of phasor calculation evolved into the calculation of real time phasor measurements that are synchronized to an absolute time reference provided by the [[Global Positioning System]]. We therefore refer to synchronized phasor measurements as ''synchrophasors''. Early prototypes of the PMU were built at [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|Virginia Tech]], and Macrodyne&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macrodyneusa.com/model_1690.htm Macrodyne model 1690]&lt;/ref&gt; built the first PMU (model 1690) in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

With the growth of increasingly more distributed energy resources on the power grid, more observability and controls systems will be needed to monitor power flow. Historically, power has been delivered in a uni-directional fashion through passive components to customers. With an increasingly more complex network of generation and loads, it is imperative that the electrical conditions of transmission and distribution networks are continuously being observed through advanced sensor technology––PMUs and uPMUs.

In simple terms, the public electrical grid that a power company operates was originally designed to take power from a single source: the operating company's generators and power plants, and feed it into the grid, where the customers consume the power. Now, some customers are operating power generating devices (solar panels, windmills, etc.) and to save costs (or to generate income) are also feeding power back into the grid. As the electric utility is required by law to buy power produced by customers, the utility wants to make sure this does not damage the grid. The grid must now be measured and controlled in order to ensure the power going into the grid from other sources is of the same quality and standards that customer equipment has been expecting from it, or, if this is not done, as Rob Landley put it, "people's light bulbs start exploding."&lt;ref&gt;"Optimizing a new processor architecture ", Rob Landley, Linux Conf Australia, January 2017, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0milqmt4ao (Retrieved May 20, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; This measurement function is what these devices do.

==Operation==
A PMU can measure 50/60&amp;nbsp;Hz AC waveforms (voltages and currents) typically at a rate of 48 samples per cycle. The analog AC waveforms are digitized by an [[analog-to-digital converter]] for each phase. A phase-locked oscillator along with a [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) reference source provides the needed high-speed synchronized sampling with 1 microsecond accuracy. However, PMUs can take in multiple time sources including non-GPS references as long as they are all calibrated and working synchronously. The resultant time-stamped phasors can be transmitted to a local or remote receiver at rates up to 120 samples per second. Historically, only small numbers of PMUs have been used to monitor transmission lines with acceptable errors of around 1%. These were simply coarser devices installed to prevent catastrophic blackouts. Now, with the invention of micro-synchronous phasor technology, many more of them are desired to be installed on distribution networks where power can be monitored at a very high degree of precision. This high degree of precision creates the ability to drastically improve system visibility and implement smart and preventative control strategies. No longer are PMUs just required at sub-stations, but are required at several places in the network including tap-changing transformers, complex loads, and PV generation buses.&lt;ref name=CERTS&gt;{{cite web|title=Phasor Advanced FAQ|url=http://www.phasor-rtdms.com/phaserconcepts/phasor_adv_faq.html|publisher=CERTS|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical overview ==
A [[phasor (sine waves)|phasor]] is a complex number that represents both the magnitude and phase angle of the sine waves found in electricity. Phasor measurements that occur at the same time are called "synchrophasors". While it is commonplace for the terms "PMU" and "synchrophasor" to be used interchangeably they actually represent two separate technical meanings. A synchrophasor is the metered value whereas the PMU is the metering device. In typical applications, phasor measurement units are sampled from widely dispersed locations in the power system network and synchronized from the common time source of a [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS)  [[radio clock]]. Synchrophasor technology provides a tool for system operators and planners to measure the state of the electrical system and manage [[power quality]]. &lt;!-- Such as?  Tie to real world situations jjm  --&gt;

PMUs measure voltages and currents at principal intersecting locations (critical substations) on a power grid and can output accurately time-stamped voltage and current phasors. Because these phasors are truly synchronized, synchronized comparison of two quantities is possible in real time. These comparisons can be used to assess system conditions-such as; frequency changes, MW, MVARs, kVolts, etc.{{Clarify|date=April 2015}} The monitored points are preselected through various studies to make extremely accurate phase angle measurements to indicate shifts in system (grid) stability. The phasor data is collected either on-site or at centralized locations using Phasor Data Concentrator technologies. The data is then transmitted to a regional monitoring system which is maintained by the local Independent System Operator (ISO). These ISO's will monitor phasor data from individual PMU's or from as many as 150 PMU's — this monitoring provides an accurate means of establishing controls for power flow from multiple energy generation sources (nuclear, coal, wind, etc.).

The technology has the potential to change the economics of power delivery by allowing increased power flow over existing lines. Synchrophasor data could be used to allow power flow up to a line's dynamic limit instead of to its worst-case limit.{{Clarify|date=April 2015}} &lt;!-- RJS ---&gt; Synchrophasor technology will usher in a new process for establishing centralized and selective controls for the flow of electrical energy over the grid. These controls will affect both large scale (multiple-states) and individual transmission line sections at intersecting substations. Transmission line congestion (over-loading), protection, and control will therefore be improved on a multiple region scale (US, Canada, Mexico) through interconnecting ISO's. &lt;!-- RJS expand control philosophies ---&gt;

== Phasor networks ==
A phasor network consists of phasor measurement units (PMUs) dispersed throughout the electricity system, [[Phasor Data Concentrator|Phasor Data Concentrators (PDC)]] to collect the information and a [[SCADA|Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition]] (SCADA) system at the central control facility.  Such a network is used in Wide Area Measurement Systems (WAMS), the first of which began in 2000 by the [[Bonneville Power Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The complete network requires rapid data transfer within the frequency of sampling of the phasor data.  GPS time stamping can provide a theoretical accuracy of synchronization better than 1 [[microsecond]].

==Installation==
Installation of a typical 10 Phasor PMU is a simple process. A phasor will be either a 3 phase voltage or a 3 phase current. Each phasor will, therefore, require 3 separate electrical connections (one for each phase). Typically an electrical engineer designs the installation and interconnection of a PMU at a substation or at a generation plant. Substation personnel will bolt an equipment rack to the floor of the substation following established seismic mounting requirements. Then the PMU along with a modem and other support equipment will be mounted on the equipment rack. They will also install the Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) antenna on the roof of the substation per manufacturer instructions. Substation personnel will also install "shunts" in all [[Current transformer]] (CT) secondary circuits that are to be measured. The PMU will also require communication circuit connection ([[Modem]] if using 4-wire connection or [[Ethernet]] for network connection).&lt;ref name=CERTS /&gt;

==Implementations==
*The [[Bonneville Power Administration]] (BPA) is the first utility to implement comprehensive adoption of synchrophasors in its wide-area monitoring system.  Today there are several implementations underway.
*The [[FNET]] project operated by Virginia Tech and the University of Tennessee utilizes a network of approximately 80 low-cost, high-precision Frequency Disturbance Recorders to collect syncrophasor data from the U.S. power grid.  [http://powerit.utk.edu/fnet.html]
*The [[NYISO#NYISO|New York Independent System Operator]] has installed 48 PMUs throughout New York State, partly in response to a [[Northeast blackout of 2003|devastating 2003 blackout]] that originated in Ohio and affected regions in both the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Matthew L. |last=Wald |title=New Tools for Keeping the Lights On |newspaper=New York Times |date=31 July 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/business/new-tools-for-keeping-the-lights-on.html?ref=science}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2006, China's Wide Area Monitoring Systems (WAMS) for its 6 grids had 300 PMUs installed mainly at 500 kV and 330 kV substations and power plants.  By 2012, China plans to have PMUs at all 500kV substations and all powerplants of 300MW and above.  Since 2002, China has built its own PMUs to its own national standard.  One type has higher sampling rates than typical and is used in power plants to measure rotor angle of the generator, reporting excitation voltage, excitation current, valve position, and output of the power system stabilizer (PSS).  All PMUs are connected via private network, and samples are received within 40 ms on average.&lt;ref name="Yang" /&gt;
*The [http://www.naspi.org North American Synchrophasor Initiative] (NASPI), previously known as The Eastern Interconnect Phasor Project (EIPP), has over 120 connected phasor measurement units collecting data into a "Super Phasor Data Concentrator" system centered at [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA). This data concentration system is now an open source project known as the [[openPDC]].
*The [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] has sponsored several related research projects, including GridStat [http://www.gridstat.net] at [[Washington State University]].

==Standards==
The [[IEEE 1344]] standard for synchrophasors was completed in 1995, and reaffirmed in 2001. In 2005, it was replaced by [[IEEE C37.118-2005]], which was a complete revision and dealt with issues concerning use of PMUs in electric power systems. The specification describes standards for measurement, the method of quantifying the measurements, testing &amp; certification requirements for verifying accuracy, and data transmission format and protocol for real-time data communication.&lt;ref name="ESPRI-1" /&gt; This standard was not comprehensive- it did not attempt to address all factors that PMUs can detect in power system dynamic activity.&lt;ref name=WAMS-1 /&gt;  A new version of the standard was released in December 2011, which split the IEEE C37.118-2005 standard into two parts: C37.118-1 dealing with the phasor estimation &amp; C37.118-2 the communications protocol. It also introduced two classifications of PMU, M — measurement &amp; P — protection. M class is close in performance requirements to that in the original 2005 standard, primarily for steady state measurement. P class has relaxed some performance requirements and is intended to capture dynamic system behaviour.

Other standards used with PMU interfacing:
*[[OLE for process control|OPC-DA / OPC-HDA]] — A [[Microsoft Windows]] based interface protocol that is currently being generalized to use [[XML]] and run on non Windows computers.
*[[IEC61850|IEC 61850]] a standard for electrical substation automation
*BPA PDCStream — a variant of IEEE 1344 used by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) PDCs and user interface software.&lt;ref name=WAMS-1 /&gt;

In physics, '''phenomenology''' is the application of [[theoretical physics]] to [[experimental data]] by making quantitative predictions based upon known theories. It is in contrast to experimentation in the [[scientific method]], in which the goal of the experiment is to test a scientific hypothesis instead of making predictions. Phenomenology is related to the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|philosophical notion]] in that these predictions describe anticipated behaviors for the phenomena in reality. 

Phenomenology is commonly applied to the field of [[particle physics]], where it forms a bridge between the [[Mathematical_model#Significance_in_the_natural_sciences|mathematical models]] of theoretical physics (such as [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] and theories of the structure of [[space-time]]) and the results of the high-energy particle experiments. It is sometimes used in other fields such as in [[condensed matter physics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|date=2010-11-30|pages=611–631|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470949955.ch20|isbn=9780470949955|title = Condensed Matter Physics|chapter = Phenomenological Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malcherek|first=T.|last2=Salje|first2=E.

==Applications in particle physics==

===Standard Model consequences===

Within the well-tested and generally accepted [[Standard Model]], [[Phenomenological model|phenomenology]] is the calculating of detailed predictions for experiments, usually at high precision (e.g., including [[renormalization|radiative corrections]]).

Examples include:

* [[Next-to-leading order]] calculations of [[particle production rate]]s and distributions.
* [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo simulation]] studies of physics processes at [[collider]]s.
* Extraction of [[Parton (particle physics)#Parton distribution functions|parton distribution functions]] from data.

====CKM matrix calculations====
{{main|CKM matrix}}

The CKM matrix is useful in these predictions:

* Application of [[heavy quark effective field theory]] to extract [[CKM matrix]] elements.
* Using [[Lattice gauge theory|lattice QCD]] to extract quark masses and CKM matrix elements from experiment.

{{expand section|date=March 2017}}

===Theoretical models===

In physics [[Beyond the Standard Model]], phenomenology addresses the experimental consequences of new [[model building (particle physics)|model]]s: how their new particles could be searched for, how the model parameters could be measured, and how the model could be distinguished from other, competing models.

====Phenomenological analysis====

'''Phenomenological analyses''', in which one studies the experimental consequences of adding the most general set of beyond-the-Standard-Model effects in a given [[sector of the Standard Model]], usually parameterized in terms of anomalous [[Coupling constant|couplings]] and higher-dimensional operators.  In this case, the term "[[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]]" is being used more in its [[philosophy of science]] sense.

The adoption of '''plug-in electric vehicles in the France''' is actively supported by the French government through a [[bonus-malus]] system and other incentives. The government provides subsidies towards the purchase of [[all-electric car|all-electric vehicles]] and [[plug-in hybrid]]s with low {{CO2}} emissions.&lt;ref name=ACEA3/&gt;&lt;ref name=bonus2016/&gt; The French government also set up a national purchase incentive scheme for all-electric utility vans.&lt;ref name=FRAtopEvan/&gt;

{{As of|2017|12}}, the stock of light-duty [[plug-in electric vehicles]] registered in France since 2010 totaled almost 150,000 units.&lt;ref name=France2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=France100K/&gt; The country,  {{as of|2016|12|lc=y}}, ranked as the second largest plug-in market in Europe after Norway, and the world's fifth.&lt;ref name=France100K/&gt;&lt;ref name=FRA100KVE/&gt; {{As of|2017|12}}, the French plug-in electric stock consisted of 92,256 all-electric passenger cars, 25,269 all-electric utility vans, and 32,272 plug-in hybrids.&lt;ref name=France2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=France2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=France100K/&gt; The split among type of powertrain is influenced by the rules of the government subsidies, which favors pure electric vehicles over plug-in hybrids.&lt;ref name=France2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=France2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=France100K/&gt;

The market share of all-electric passenger cars increased from 0.30% of new car registered in 2012, to 0.49% in 2013, and reached 0.59% in 2014.&lt;ref name=SalesFR2010_16/&gt;&lt;ref name=FRSales2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=FR2013share/&gt; Until 2013, most plug-in cars sold in France were pure electric cars, but from 2015, sales of plug-in hybrid cars rose significantly. After the introduction of super-bonus for the scrappage of old diesel-power cars in 2015, sales of both segments of plug-in cars surged, and for the first time the French plug-in market share passed the 1% mark, ending 2015 with a market share of 1.17% of total new car registrations that year.&lt;ref name=SalesFR2010_16/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fra2015VHR/&gt;&lt;ref name=TopSix2015/&gt; The plug-in market share climbed to 1.40% of new car registrations in 2016,&lt;ref name=SalesFR2010_16/&gt;&lt;ref name=France2016/&gt; and achieved a record market share of 1.98% in 2017.&lt;ref name=France2017/&gt;

{{As of |2015|12}}, France ranked as the country with the world's largest market for light-duty electric commercial vehicles. Nearly half of the vans sold in the [[European Union]] are sold in the country.&lt;ref name=FRAtopEvan/&gt; The market share of all-electric utility vans reached a market share of 1.22% of new vans registered in 2014, and 1.30% in 2015.&lt;ref name=SalesFRvans2014_16/&gt;

== Government incentives ==
{{See also|Government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles#France|l1=Government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles in France}}

Since 2008 France has a [[bonus-malus]] system offering a financial incentive, or bonus, for the purchase of cars with low [[carbon emissions]], and a fee, or malus, for the purchase of high-emission vehicles. The bonus applies to private and company vehicles purchased on or after 5 December 2007 and is deducted from the purchase price of the vehicle. The malus penalty applies to all vehicles registered after 1 January 2008, and is added at the time of registration. Since 2009, every family with more than two children receives a deduction from the malus of 20 g of {{CO2}} per km per child.&lt;ref name=EUenvironTax&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ieep.eu/assets/1398/ETR_in_Europe_-_Annex_2_3_4.pdf | title=Environmental Tax Reform in Europe: Opportunities for the Future | author=[[Institute for European Environmental Policy]] (IEEP) | publisher=IEEP | date=2014-05-30 | accessdate=2016-10-08 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009191722/http://www.ieep.eu/assets/1398/ETR_in_Europe_-_Annex_2_3_4.pdf | archivedate=2016-10-09 | df= }}'' See Chapter 3 - Car Registration Tax (‘Bonus-Malus’ system) in France pp. 15-21.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saint Étienne-Autolib-20140127.jpg|thumb|[[Electric car]]s purchase under a battery leasing contract, such as the [[Renault Zoe]], are eligible for the full {{euro|6300}} bonus for zero {{CO2}} emission vehicles.]]

Until July 31, 2012, a premium up to {{euro|5,000}}, under the bonus-malus system, was granted for the purchase of new cars with {{CO2}} emissions of 60 g/km or less which benefited [[battery electric vehicle|all-electric cars]] and any [[plug-in hybrid]] with such low emissions. Vehicles emitting up to 125 g/km or less, such as [[hybrid electric vehicle|conventional hybrids]] and [[natural gas vehicle]]s, were granted up to {{euro|2,000}}.&lt;ref name=ACEA3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abccarbon.com/50000-electric-vehicles-france-commits-to-infrastructure-production/|title=50,000 Electric Vehicles: France Commits to Infrastructure &amp; Production|publisher=ABC Carbon|date=2010-04-13|accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incentive could not exceed 20% of the sales price including [[VAT]], increased with the cost of the battery if it is rented.&lt;ref name=ACEA3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20100420_EV_tax_overview.pdf|title=Overview of Tax Incentives for Electric Vehicles in the EU|publisher=[[European Automobile Manufacturers Association]]|date=2010-04-20|accessdate=2010-05-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611201348/http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20100420_EV_tax_overview.pdf|archivedate=2011-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective on August 1, 2012, the government increased the bonus for electric cars up to {{euro|7,000}} but capped at 30% of the vehicle price including [[VAT]]. The price includes any battery leasing charges, and therefore, electric cars which need a battery leasing contract also are eligible for the bonus. For example, an electric car sold for {{euro|23 333}} including VAT was eligible for the maximum bonus of {{euro|7000}}. The emission level for the maximum bonus was raised to 20 g/km or less. Cars with emission levels between 20 and 50 g/km were eligible to a bonus of up to {{euro|5,000}}, and between 50 and 60 g/km were eligible to a bonus of up to {{euro|4,500}}. After this limit, the bonus dropped  to {{euro|550}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.automobile-propre.com/france-consumer-bonuses-for-electric-and-hybrid-cars/|title=France: Consumer bonuses for electric and hybrid cars|author=Yoann Nussbaumer|publisher=Automobile Propre|date=2012-08-10|accessdate=2013-02-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110165813/http://en.automobile-propre.com/france-consumer-bonuses-for-electric-and-hybrid-cars/|archivedate=2012-11-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fee schedule for the bonus-malus was modified in 2013. Effective November 1, 2013, the bonus was reduced from {{euro|7,000}} to {{euro|6300}} for all-electrics and any other vehicle with {{CO2}} emissions of less than 21 g/km. Vehicles emitting between 21 and 60 g/km, such as [[plug-in hybrid]]s and [[hybrid electric vehicle|conventional hybrids]], were eligible to a bonus up to {{euro|4,000}}, and for emissions between 61 and 90 g/km up to {{euro|150}}, down from {{euro|550}}. Effective January 1, 2014, the fee schedule for the malus was increased to a maximum penalty of {{euro|8,000}} from {{euro|6,300}} for vehicles emitting over 200 g/km. A neutral class applied to vehicles emitting between 91-130 g/km.&lt;ref name=EUenvironTax/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bioethanolcarburant.com/actualite/de-nouveaux-baremes-bonus-malus-en-2014/ |title=De nouveaux barèmes bonus-malus en 2014 | language=French |trans-title=New bonus-malus scales in 2014 | author=Staff |publisher=Bioéthanol | date=2014-01-17 | accessdate=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2015-2016 ===

From April 1, 2015, a super-bonus was introduced, increasing the financial incentive to a cumulative total of {{euro|10,000}}, consisting of the regular bonus of {{euro|6300}} for purchasing a pure electric car, plus up to {{euro|3700}} for customers [[Scrappage program#France|scrapping]] a diesel-powered car in circulation before 1 January 2001. In the case of plug-in hybrids with {{CO2}} emission levels between 21 and 60 g/km, the purchase bonus is {{euro|4000}} plus the scrapping premium of {{euro|3700}}. Also a specific {{euro|500}} grant was introduced for families which are below the income tax threshold who buy an ordinary new or second hand car below certain {{CO2}} emission thresholds or a hybrid or electric car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.connexionfrance.com/April-petrol-mutuelles-depassements-electric-cars-16798-view-article.html| title=What is new for April 1?| publisher=The Connexion| date=2015-04-01|accessdate=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective January 4, 2016, the {{euro|6300}} purchase bonus limited to 27% of the purchase price for vehicles emitting up to 20 g/km was kept. This bonus corresponds to pure electric vehicles and those equipped with a [[range extender (vehicle)|range extender]]. Vehicles emitting between 21 and 60 g/km were entitled to a {{euro|1000}} bonus. This bonus corresponds to the majority of plug-in hybrids. Conventional hybrid passenger cars emitting between 61 and 110 g/km with sufficient level of hybridization, with an electric motor with an output power of not be less than 10 [[kW]], are entitle to a {{euro|750}} bonus.

=== 2017 proposal ===
{{As of|2016|09}}, the government proposal to be in force from 1 January 2017 provides that the {{euro|10,000}} super-bonus for scrapping a diesel vehicle over 10 years-old will be renewed. However, the bonus for the purchase of a pure electric car will drop to {{euro|6000}} from {{euro|6300}} in 2016, but to compensate, the additional scrappage bonus will be increased to {{euro|4000}} from {{euro|3700}} in 2016. Also, the government plans to introduce a purchase price cap to the vehicles eligible for the bonus, and to introduce a new bonus for two-wheeled motor vehicles. For the more polluting vehicles, the government intends to increase the maximum malus fee to {{euro|10000}} from {{euro|8000}} in 2016 for vehicles emitting more than 191 g/km, lowering the limit from  200 g/km in 2016.&lt;ref name=bonus2017&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avem.fr/actualite-projet-de-loi-de-finances-2017-decryptage-6212.html | title= Projet de loi de finances 2017 : décryptage |language=French |trans-title=Bill 2017 Finance: deciphering |first=Tiphaine |last=Leurent |publisher= Association pour l'Avenir du Véhicule Electrique Méditerranéen (AVEM)|date=2016-09-29 |accessdate=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government intends to maintain the  {{euro|1000}} purchase bonus for plug-in hybrids with a {{CO2}} emission level between 21 and 60 g/km. However, the proposal does not include anything about the conversion premium for scrapping a 10-year-old diesel car for the purchase of a plug-in hybrid. The purchase bonus for non-rechargeable hybrid vehicles will be eliminated.&lt;ref name=bonus2017/&gt;

=== Controversies ===

;Piggyback on French subsidies

In September 2013, several French news outlets reported that according to the Norwegian newspaper [[Dagens Næringsliv]], some car dealers in Norway have been buying electric cars in France and earning the {{euro|7,000}} (~ {{USD|9,465}}) [[Government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles#France|government subsidy]]. These cars are then imported to Norway and after discounting the freight costs, they are sold at a discount. Dagens Næringsliv cited the case of one dealer near Oslo with 70% of its electric car sales corresponding to vehicles imported from France, and with at least 40 Leafs imported, totaling {{euro|280,000}} ( ~ {{USD|378,600}}) in benefits at a cost of the French taxpayers.

[[Image:Radioisotope heater unit.gif|thumb|right|Diagram of a radioisotope heater unit]]
'''Radioisotope heater units''' (RHU) are small devices that provide heat through [[radioactive decay]]. They are similar to tiny [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s (RTG) and normally provide about one watt of heat each, derived from the decay of a few grams of [[plutonium-238]]—although other [[radioactive isotopes]] could be used. The heat produced by these RHUs is given off continuously for several decades and, theoretically, for up to a century or more.&lt;ref name=doe1&gt;{{Cite web  | last =   | first =   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Department of Energy Facts: Radioisotope Heater Units
  | work =   | publisher = U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Space and Defense Power Systems  | date = December 1998   | url = https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/system/downloadable_items/291_rhu.pdf | format =  | doi = | accessdate = March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spacecraft, RHUs are necessary to heat critical components and subsystems. RHUs also reduce spacecraft complexity by making heater subsystems unnecessary. By having as few heating subsystems as possible, the overall complexity of the spacecraft can be reduced.&lt;ref name=doe1/&gt;

While both RHUs and RTGs use the decay heat of a radioactive isotope (usually Pu-238), RHUs are generally much smaller as a result of omitting the [[thermocouple]]s and heat sinks/radiators required to generate electricity from heat. Both RHUs and RTGs feature rugged, heat-resistant casings to safely contain the radioisotope in the event of a launch vehicle failure or an accidental collision with the earth from deep space. The total mass of a single RHU (including shielding) is about 40&amp;nbsp;grams. Similar schemes, such as thermo-ionic generators, have also been used.

== Spacecraft use ==
[[File:RHU parts.jpg|right|thumb|'''RHU''' Photo of a disassembled RHU. RHUs use Pu-238 to generate about 1 watt of heat each.]] Most lunar and Martian surface probes use RHUs for heat, including many probes that use solar panels rather than RTGs to generate electricity. Examples include the [[ALSEP#Apollo_11_.28EASEP.29|seismometer deployed]] on the Moon by Apollo 11 in 1969, which contained 1.2&amp;nbsp;ounces (34 grams) of plutonium-238; [[Mars Pathfinder]]; and the [[Mars Exploration Rovers]] ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity''. RHUs are especially useful on the Moon because of its lengthy and cold two-week night.

Virtually every [[outer space|deep space]] mission beyond [[Mars]] uses both RHUs and RTGs. Solar [[insolation]] decreases with the square of the distance from the [[Sun]], so additional heat is needed to keep spacecraft components at nominal [[operating temperature]]. Some of this heat is produced electrically because it is easier to control, but electrical heaters are far less efficient than a RHU because RTGs convert only a few percent of their heat to electricity and reject the rest to space.

The [[Cassini–Huygens]] spacecraft sent to [[Saturn]] contained eighty-two of these units (in addition to three main RTGs for power generation). The associated Huygens probe contained thirty-five.

The [[United States Department of Energy]] has developed the [[General Purpose Heat Source]] (GPHS) primarily for space use. These GPHSes can be used individually or in groups of up to eighteen for component heating and sources for RTGs. Each GPHS contains four [[iridium]]-clad Pu-238 fuel pellets, standing 5&amp;nbsp;cm tall, 10&amp;nbsp;cm square and weighs 1.44&amp;nbsp;kg.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4191">'''Silk waste''' includes all kinds of raw [[silk]] which may be unwindable, and therefore unsuited to the [[Silk throwing|throwing process]]. Before the introduction of machinery applicable to the spinning of silk waste, the refuse from [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]] reeling, and also from silk winding, which is now used in producing spun silk fabrics, was nearly all destroyed as being useless, with the exception of that which could be hand-combed and spun by means of the [[distaff]] and [[spinning wheel]], a method which is still practised by some of the peasantry in [[India]] and other countries in [[Asia]].

==Sources==
The supply of waste silk is drawn from the following sources:

* The [[silkworm]], when commencing to spin, emits a dull, lustreless and uneven thread with which it suspends itself from the twigs and leaves of the tree upon which it has been feeding, or  the straws provided for it by attendants in the worm-rearing establishments: this first thread is unreelable, and, moreover, is often mixed with straw, leaves and twigs.
* The outside layers of the true [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]] are too coarse and uneven for reeling; and as the worm completes its task of spinning, the thread becomes finer and weaker, so both the extreme outside and inside layers are put aside as waste.
* Pierced cocoons, that is, those from which the moth of the silkworm has emerged-and damaged cocoons.
* During the process of reeling from the cocoon the silk often breaks; and both in finding a true and reliable thread, and in joining the ends, there is unavoidable waste.
* Raw silk skeins are often re-reeled; and in this process part has to be discarded: this being known to the trade as gum-waste. The same term—gum-waste—is applied to "waste" made in the various processes of silk throwing; but manufacturers using threads known technically as organzines and trams call the surplus "manufacturer's waste."

==Processing==
A silk "[[wiktionary:throwster|throwster]]" receives the silk in skein form, the thread of which consists of a number of silk fibres wound together to make a certain diameter or size, the separate fibre having actually been spun by the worm. The silk-waste spinner receives the silk in quite a different form: merely the raw material, packed in [[:wikt:bale#Etymology 3|bales]] of various sizes and weights, the contents being a much-tangled mass of all lengths of fibre mixed with much foreign matter, such as ends of straws, twigs, leaves, worms and [[chrysalis]]. It is the spinner's business to straighten out these fibres, with the aid of machinery, and then to so join them that they become a thread, which is known as spun silk.

All silk produced by the worm is composed of two substances: [[fibroin]], the true thread, and [[sericin]], which is a hard, gummy coating of the fibroin. Before the silk can be manipulated by machinery to any advantage, the gum coating must be removed, really dissolved and washed away. Where the method used in achieving this operation is through fermentation, the product is called '''schappe'''. The former, schapping, is the French, Italian and Swiss method, from which the silk when finished is neither so bright nor so good in colour as the discharged silk; but it is very clean and level, and for some purposes essential, as, for instance, in [[velvet]] manufacture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4584">'''Sunrayce 99''' was an intercollegiate solar car race sponsored by [[General Motors]], [[Electronic Data Systems|EDS]], and the [[US Department of Energy]]. The race began on June 20, 1999 in Washington, D.C. and finished on June 29, 1999 at Epcot Center in Orlando, Florida.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dnr.louisiana.gov/index.cfm?md=pagebuilder&amp;tmp=home&amp;pid=479 Louisiana DNR article]&lt;/ref&gt; The event was won by the University of Missouri at Rolla (now Missouri S&amp;T). Sunrayce 99 was the fifth and final race in the Sunrayce series and was followed by the first [[American Solar Challenge]] in 2001. The overall success of the event was limited by difficult weather conditions. Teams battled clouds and rain throughout the race, and no team avoided having to trailer their car for at least part of the race route.

Teams were allowed deviate from the traditional [[lead–acid battery]] technology for the first time in Sunrayce 99 when [[nickel–metal hydride batteries]] were approved for use. The new battery technology offered equivalent capacity to lead acid batteries but weighed several hundred pounds less. Nickel–metal hydride batteries were very expensive at the time, so only the most well funded teams could afford them.  Unfortunately the rainy weather and slow speeds neutralized the advantage of the new battery technology.

The '''top quark''', also known as the '''t quark''' (symbol: t) or '''truth quark''', is the most massive of all observed [[elementary particle]]s. Like all [[quark]]s, the top quark is a [[fermion]] with [[spin (physics)|spin]] [[spin-½|{{sfrac|1|2}}]], and experiences all four [[fundamental interaction]]s: [[gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], [[weak interaction]]s, and [[strong interaction]]s. It has an [[electric charge]] of +{{sfrac|2|3}}&amp;nbsp;[[elementary charge|''e'']]. It has a [[Quark#Mass|mass]] of 172.44 ± 0.13 (stat) ± 0.47 (syst){{val|ul=GeV/c2}},&lt;ref name="CMSRunImass2016"/&gt; which is about the same mass as an [[atom]] of [[tungsten]].&lt;!--172.9 GeV/c^2 * 0.931494061 u/GeV/c^2 = 185.3 u. --&gt; The [[antiparticle]] of the top quark is the '''top antiquark''' (symbol: {{overline|t}}, sometimes called ''antitop quark'' or simply ''antitop''), which differs from it only in that some of its properties have [[additive inverse|equal magnitude but opposite sign]].

The top quark interacts primarily by the [[strong interaction]], but can only decay through the [[weak force]]. It decays to a [[W boson]] and either a [[bottom quark]] (most frequently), a [[strange quark]], or, on the rarest of occasions, a [[down quark]]. The [[Standard Model]] predicts its [[mean lifetime]] to be roughly {{val|5|e=-25|u=s}}.&lt;ref name=Quadt&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is about a twentieth of the timescale for strong interactions, and therefore it does not [[Hadronization|form hadrons]], giving physicists a unique opportunity to study a "bare" quark (all other quarks [[Hadronization|hadronize]], meaning that they combine with other quarks to form [[hadron]]s, and can only be observed as such). Because it is so massive, the properties of the top quark allow predictions to be made of the mass of the [[Higgs boson]] under certain [[Beyond the Standard Model|extensions of the Standard Model]] (see [[#Mass and coupling to the Higgs boson|Mass and coupling to the Higgs boson]] below). As such, it is extensively studied as a means to discriminate between competing theories.

Its existence (and that of the [[bottom quark]]) was postulated in 1973 by [[Makoto Kobayashi (physicist)|Makoto Kobayashi]] and [[Toshihide Maskawa]] to explain the observed [[CP violation]]s in [[kaon]] [[particle decay|decay]],&lt;ref name="M. Kobayashi, T. Maskawa 1973 652"&gt;

The proposal of Kobayashi and Maskawa heavily relied on the [[GIM mechanism]] put forward by [[Sheldon Lee Glashow]], [[John Iliopoulos]] and [[Luciano Maiani]],&lt;ref&gt;

When in [[November Revolution (physics)|November 1974]] teams at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] (BNL) and the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]] (SLAC) simultaneously announced the discovery of the [[J/ψ meson]], it was soon after identified as a bound state of the missing charm quark with its antiquark. This discovery allowed the GIM mechanism to become part of the Standard Model.&lt;ref&gt;

It was in fact not long until a fifth quark, the bottom, was discovered by the [[E288 experiment]] team, led by [[Leon Lederman]] at [[Fermilab]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;

Early searches for the top quark at [[SLAC]] and [[DESY]] (in [[Hamburg]]) came up empty-handed. When, in the early eighties, the [[Super Proton Synchrotron]] (SPS) at [[CERN]] discovered the [[W&amp;nbsp;boson]] and the [[Z&amp;nbsp;boson]], it was again felt that the discovery of the top was imminent. As the SPS gained competition from the [[Tevatron]] at Fermilab there was still no sign of the missing particle, and it was announced by the group at CERN that the top mass must be at least {{val|41|u=GeV/c2}}. After a race between CERN and Fermilab to discover the top, the accelerator at CERN reached its limits without creating a single top, pushing the lower bound on its mass up to {{val|77|u=GeV/c2}}.&lt;ref name=LissTipton1997/&gt;

The Tevatron was (until the start of [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] operation at [[CERN]] in 2009) the only hadron collider powerful enough to produce top quarks. In order to be able to confirm a future discovery, a second detector, the [[DZero experiment|DØ detector]], was added to the complex (in addition to the [[Collider Detector at Fermilab]] (CDF) already present). In October 1992, the two groups found their first hint of the top, with a single creation event that appeared to contain the top. In the following years, more evidence was collected and on April&amp;nbsp;22, 1994, the CDF group submitted their paper presenting tentative evidence for the existence of a top quark with a mass of about {{val|175|u=GeV/c2}}. In the meantime, DØ had found no more evidence than the suggestive event in 1992. A year later, on March&amp;nbsp;2, 1995, after having gathered more evidence and a reanalysis of the DØ data (who had been searching for a much lighter top), the two groups jointly reported the discovery of the top at a mass of {{val|176|18|u=GeV/c2}}.&lt;ref name=CDF-1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=D0-1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=LissTipton1997/&gt;

In the years leading up to the top quark discovery, it was realized that certain precision measurements of the electroweak vector boson masses and couplings are very sensitive to the value of the top quark mass. These effects become much larger for higher values of the top mass and therefore could indirectly see the top quark even if it could not be directly detected in any experiment at the time. The largest effect from the top quark mass was on the [[S and T parameters|T&amp;nbsp;parameter]] and by 1994 the precision of these indirect measurements had led to a prediction of the top quark mass to be between {{val|145|u=GeV/c2}} and {{val|185|u=GeV/c2}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lphe.epfl.ch/~mtran/seminaires/Cours_Master_Bordeaux/Articles/SciAmTop.pdf The Discovery of the Top Quark], Tony M. Liss and Paul L. Tipton&lt;/ref&gt; It is the development of techniques that ultimately allowed such precision calculations that led to [[Gerardus 't Hooft]] and [[Martinus Veltman]] winning the [[Nobel Prize]] in physics in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;

A first measurement of the top quark charge has been published, resulting in approximately 90% confidence limit that the top quark charge is indeed +{{frac|2|3}}.&lt;ref&gt;

==Production==
Because top quarks are very massive, large amounts of energy are needed to create one. The only way to achieve such high energies is through high energy collisions. These occur naturally in the Earth's upper atmosphere as [[cosmic ray]]s collide with particles in the air, or can be created in a [[particle accelerator]]. In 2011, after the [[Tevatron]] ceased operations, the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]] became the only accelerator that generates a beam of sufficient energy to produce top quarks, with a [[center-of-mass frame|center-of-mass energy]] of 7&amp;nbsp;TeV. There are multiple processes that can lead to the production of top quarks, but they can be conceptually divided in two categories.

=== Top-quark pairs ===
{{Multiple image

}}The most common is [[pair production|production of a top–antitop pair]] via [[strong interaction]]s. In a collision, a highly energetic [[gluon]] is created, which subsequently decays into a top and antitop. This process was responsible for the majority of the top events at Tevatron and was the process observed when the top was first discovered in 1995.&lt;ref name="D0-2009" /&gt; It is also possible to produce pairs of top–antitop through the decay of an intermediate [[photon]] or [[Z-boson]]. However, these processes are predicted to be much rarer and have a virtually identical experimental signature in a [[hadron collider]] like Tevatron.

=== Single top quarks ===
{{Multiple image

}}
A distinctly different process is the production of single top quarks via [[weak interaction]]. This can happen in several ways (called channels): either an intermediate [[W-boson]] decays into a top and antibottom quark ("s-channel") or a bottom quark (probably created in a pair through the decay of a gluon) transforms to a top quark by exchanging a W-boson with an up or down quark ("t-channel"). A single top quark can also be produced in association with a W boson, requiring an initial state bottom quark ("tW-channel"). The first evidence for these processes was published by the DØ collaboration in December 2006,&lt;ref name="D0-2006"&gt;{{cite journal

==Decay==
[[File:Ttbar decay channels.png|alt=ttbar-decay final states|thumb|upright=1.5|All possible final states of the decay of a top-quark pair]]
Because of its enormous [[mass]], the top quark is extremely short-lived with a predicted lifetime of only {{val |5|e=-25|u=s}}.&lt;ref name=Quadt /&gt; As a result, top quarks do not have time before they decay to [[hadronization|form hadrons]] as other quarks do, which provides physicists with the unique opportunity to study the behavior of a "bare" quark.  The only known way the top quark can decay is through the weak interaction producing a W-boson and a down-type quark (down, strange, or bottom).

In particular, it is possible to directly determine the [[branching ratio]] Γ(W&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;b)&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;Γ(W&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''q''&amp;nbsp;(''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;b,s,d)). The best current determination of this ratio is {{val|0.91|0.04}}.&lt;ref name="PDG2013"&gt;

The Standard Model also allows more exotic decays, but only at one loop level, meaning that they are extremely suppressed. In particular, it is possible for a top quark to decay into another up-type quark (an up or a charm) by emitting a photon or a Z-boson.&lt;ref&gt;

The branching ratios for these decays have been determined to be less than 5.9 in 1,000 for photonic decay and less than 2.1 in 1,000 for Z-boson decay at 95% [[confidence level|confidence]].&lt;ref name=PDG2013/&gt;

==Mass and coupling to the Higgs boson==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2009}}
The Standard Model describes fermion masses through the [[Higgs mechanism]]. The [[Higgs boson]] has a [[Yukawa coupling]] to the left- and right-handed top quarks. After electroweak symmetry breaking (when the Higgs acquires a [[vacuum expectation value]]), the left- and right-handed components mix, becoming a mass term.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = y_\text{t} h q u^c \rightarrow \frac{y_\text{t} v}{\sqrt{2}}( 1 + h^0/v) u u^c&lt;/math&gt;

The top quark Yukawa coupling has a value of

:&lt;math&gt;y_\text{t} = \sqrt{2} m_\text{t}/v \simeq 1&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''v'' {{=}} }}246&amp;nbsp;GeV is the value of the Higgs [[vacuum expectation value]].

===Yukawa couplings===
{{See also|Beta function (physics)}}
In the Standard Model, all of the quark and lepton Yukawa couplings are small compared to the top quark Yukawa coupling. Understanding this hierarchy in the fermion masses is an open problem in theoretical physics. Yukawa couplings are not constants and their values change depending on the energy scale (distance scale) at which they are measured. The dynamics of Yukawa couplings are determined by the renormalization group equation.

One of the prevailing views in particle physics is that the size of the top quark Yukawa coupling is determined by the [[renormalization group]], leading to the "quasi-[[infrared fixed point]]."

The Yukawa couplings of the up, down, charm, strange and bottom quarks, are hypothesized to have small values at the extremely high energy scale of grand unification, 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;GeV. They increase in value at lower energy scales, at which the quark masses are generated by the Higgs. The slight growth is due to corrections from the [[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] coupling. The corrections from the Yukawa couplings are negligible for the lower mass quarks.

If, however, a quark Yukawa coupling has a large value at very high energies, its Yukawa corrections will evolve and cancel against the QCD corrections. This is known as a (quasi-) [[infrared fixed point]]. No matter what the initial starting value of the coupling is, if it is sufficiently large it will reach this fixed point value. The corresponding quark mass is then predicted.

The top quark Yukawa coupling lies very near the infrared fixed point of the Standard Model. The renormalization group equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu \frac{\partial}{\partial\mu} y_\text{t} \approx \frac{y_\text{t}}{16\pi^2}\left(\frac{9}{2}y_\text{t}^2 - 8 g_3^2- \frac{9}{4}g_2^2 - \frac{17}{20} g_1^2 \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|size=120%|''g''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the color gauge coupling, {{math|size=120%|''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the weak isospin gauge coupling, and {{math|size=120%|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the weak hypercharge gauge coupling. This equation describes how the Yukawa coupling changes with energy scale&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|μ}}. Solutions to this equation for large initial values {{math|size=120%|''y''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;}} cause the right-hand side of the equation to quickly approach zero, locking {{math|size=120%|''y''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;}} to the QCD coupling {{math|size=120%|''g''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The value of the fixed point is fairly precisely determined in the Standard Model, leading to a top quark mass of 230&amp;nbsp;GeV. However, if there is more than one Higgs doublet, the mass value will be reduced by Higgs mixing angle effects in an unpredicted way.

In the [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model|minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model]] (MSSM), there are two Higgs doublets and the renormalization group equation for the top quark Yukawa coupling is slightly modified:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu \frac{\partial}{\partial\mu} y_\text{t} \approx \frac{y_\text{t}}{16\pi^2}\left(6y_\text{t}^2 +y_\text{b}^2- \frac{16}{3} g_3^2- 3g_2^2 -\frac{13}{15} g_1^2 \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''y''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; is the bottom quark Yukawa coupling. This leads to a fixed point where the top mass is smaller, 170–200&amp;nbsp;GeV. The uncertainty in this prediction arises because the bottom quark Yukawa coupling can be amplified in the MSSM. Some theorists believe this is supporting evidence for the MSSM.

The quasi-infrared fixed point has subsequently formed the basis of [[top quark condensation]] theories of electroweak symmetry breaking in which the Higgs boson is composite at ''extremely'' short distance scales, composed of a pair of top and antitop quarks.

In chemistry, '''triiodide''' usually refers to the triiodide ion, {{chem|I|3|−}}.  This anion, one of the [[polyhalogen ions|polyhalogen ion]]s, is composed of three [[iodine]] atoms. It is formed by combining [[aqueous solution]]s of [[iodide]] salts and [[iodine]].  Some salts of the anion have been isolated, including [[thallium triiodide|thallium(I) triiodide]] (Tl&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[ammonium triiodide]] ([NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). Triiodide is observed to be a red colour in solution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group7/halogensasoas.html |title= Halogens as oxidising agents - Chemguide}}&lt;/ref&gt;
.

==Nomenclature==
Other chemical compounds with "triiodide" in their name may contain three iodide centers that are not bonded to each other as the triiodide ion, but exist instead as separate iodine atoms or iodide ions. Examples include [[nitrogen triiodide]] (NI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[phosphorus triiodide]] (PI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), where individual iodines  are covalently bonded to a central atom. As some cations have the theoretical possibility to form compounds with both triiodide and iodide ions, such as [[ammonium]], compounds containing iodide anions in a 3:1 [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] ratio should only be referred to as triiodides in cases where the triiodide anion is present. It may also be helpful to indicate the oxidation number of a metal cation, where appropriate. For example, the covalent molecule [[gallium(III) iodide|gallium triiodide]] (Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) is better referred to as gallium(III) iodide to emphasise that it is iodide anions that are present, and not triiodide.

==Structure and bonding==
The ion is linear and symmetrical.  According to [[VSEPR theory]], the central iodine atom has three equatorial lone pairs, and the terminal iodines are bonded axially in a linear fashion, due to the three lone pairs bonding to the central iodine-atom. In the [[Molecular orbital theory|molecular orbital model]], a common explanation for the [[hypervalent]] bonding on the central iodine involves a [[three-center four-electron bond]]. The I−I bond is longer than in diatomic iodine, [[Iodine|I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].

In [[ionic compound]]s, the bond lengths and angles of triiodide vary depending on the nature of the [[cation]]. The triiodide anion is easily polarised and in many salts, one I−I bond becomes shorter than the other. Only in combination with large cations, e.g. a [[Quaternary ammonium cation|quaternary ammonium]] such as [N(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, may the triiodide remain roughly symmetrical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Inorganic Chemistry |edition = 5th |last = Atkins|year = 2010 |publisher = Oxford University Press |isbn = 9780199236176 |page = 431|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dimensions of the triiodide [I&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;−I&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;−I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; bonds in a few sample compounds are shown below:

==Properties==
The triiodide ion is the simplest [[polyiodide]]; several higher polyiodides exist.  In solution, it appears yellow in low concentrations, and brown at higher concentrations.  The triiodide ion is responsible for the well-known blue-black color which arises when iodine solutions interact with [[Starch#Tests|starch]]. Iodide does not react with starch; nor do solutions of iodine in nonpolar [[solvent]]s.  

[[Lugol's iodine]] contains potassium iodide and a stoichiometric amount of elemental iodine, so that significant amounts of triiodide ion exist in this solution.

[[Tincture of iodine]], although nominally a solution of elemental iodine in ethanol, also contains significant amounts of triiodide, due to its content of both iodide and water.

==Preparation==

The following [[exergonic]] equilibrium gives rise to the triiodide [[ion]]:
:I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ⇌ {{chem|I|3|−}}
In this reaction, iodide is viewed as a [[Lewis base]], and the [[iodine]] is a [[Lewis acid]].  The process is analogous to the reaction of [[octasulfur|S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]] with [[sodium sulfide]], except that the higher polyiodides have branched structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wells|first=A. F.|date=1984|title=Structural Inorganic Chemistry|location=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|ISBN=0-19-855370-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Vandal''''' was a river [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]] designed by [[Karl Hagelin]] and Johny Johnson for [[Branobel]]. Russian ''Vandal'' and French ''[[Petite-Pierre (ship)|Petite-Pierre]]'', launched in 1903, were the world's first [[Diesel engine|diesel-powered]] ships (sources disagree over which of the two, ''Vandal'' or ''Petite-Pierre'', was ''the'' first&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 207: ''Petite-Pierre'' was the first diesel ship. Gardiner and Greenway, p. 160: ''Vandal'' was the first diesel ship.&lt;/ref&gt;). ''Vandal'' was the first equipped with fully functional [[diesel-electric transmission]].

In the 1890s oil industry searched for an economical oil-burning engine, and the solution was found by German engineer [[Rudolph Diesel]].&lt;ref name=T168&gt;Tolf, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Diesel marketed his technology to oil barons around the world;&lt;ref&gt;His first licensees included [[Vickers]], [[MAN B&amp;W Diesel|Burmeister and Vain]] and [[Adolphus Busch]].&lt;/ref&gt; in February 1898 he granted exclusive licenses to build his engines in [[Sweden]] and [[Russia]] to [[Emanuel Nobel]] of the [[Nobel family]].&lt;ref name=T169&gt;Tolf, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian licence cost Nobel 800,000 [[Deutsche Mark|marks]] in cash and stock of the newly founded Russian Diesel Company.&lt;ref name=T169/&gt; The [[Saint Petersburg]] engine plant was a quick success; it started with diesel-powered industrial pumps for [[Pipeline transport|oil pipelines]] and soon grabbed the mass market for [[Gristmill|flour mill]] engines.&lt;ref name=T170&gt;Tolf, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; It produced more diesel engines than any other concern in the world.&lt;ref name=T171&gt;Tolf, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902 Karl Hagelin, "a veteran of the [[Volga River|Volga]] and sometime visionary",&lt;ref name=T171/&gt; suggesting mating diesel engines to river barges. He envisioned direct shipment of oil through a 1,800-mile route from the lower Volga to Saint Petersburg and [[Finland]].&lt;ref name=T171/&gt; The canals of the [[Volga–Baltic Waterway]] dictated use of relatively small barges, making use of steam engines uneconomical. Diesel engine seemed a natural choice. Hagelin believed that reversing the engine and regulating its speed could be done with an electrical transmission, and contracted Swedish [[Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget|ASEA]] to test the electrical drive system.&lt;ref name=T171/&gt; Hagelin then recruited [[naval architect]] Johny Johnson of [[Gothenburg]] to design the ship. Johnson placed the diesel engine and electric generator in the middle, and the electric motors in the stern, driving the propellers directly.&lt;ref name=T172&gt;Tolf, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The holds were separated by longitudinal (rather than transverse) bulkheads running the length of the ship, a feature that became common on ocean-going tankers.&lt;ref 
name=T172/&gt;

[[File:Gorskii 04417u.jpg|thumb|left|''Vandal'' was designed for the canals of the Russian North ([[Ladoga Canal]] pictured. Photo of 1909).]]

The ship's powerplant (3×120 horsepowers) was built by Sweden by Swedish Diesel (Aktiebolaget Diesels Motorer) and ASEA.&lt;ref name=T172/&gt; Each engine had three cylinders with a bore of 290&amp;nbsp;mm and stroke of 430&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name=MS/&gt; They ran at a constant 240 rpm,&lt;ref name=MS&gt;''[http://www.motorship.com/news101/trials-and-tribulations-of-the-marine-diesel-a-look-back-at-the-history-of-diesel-ships Trials and tribulations of the marine diesel]''. The Motorship. November 01, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and the electrical transmission, controlled by a [[tram]]-like lever, varied propeller speed from 30 to 300 rpm.&lt;ref name=T172/&gt; The hull was built at [[Krasnoye Sormovo Factory No. 112|Sormovo shipyard]] in [[Nizhny Novgorod]] and towed to Saint Petersburg for the final assembly. Its size (244.5 × 31¾ × 8 feet) was taylored to the [[Volga–Baltic Waterway|canals of the North]] rather than the Volga.&lt;ref name=T172/&gt; Named ''Vandal'', it commenced commercial operation in the spring of 1903.&lt;ref name=T172/&gt; ''Vandal'' was accidentally damaged on its [[maiden voyage]], repaired and served on the Volga route for ten years.

The larger ''[[Sarmat (ship)|Sarmat]]'', with four 180 h.p. engines, was launched next summer. Unlike ''Vandal'', ''Sarmat'''s engines could be coupled to the propellers directly, bypassing the electrical drive&lt;ref name=T172/&gt; and saving up to 15% of engine power that would be otherwise lost in the electric transmission. ''Sarmat'' operated until 1923; the [[hulk (ship)|hulk]] was moored in [[Nizhny Novgorod]] until the 1970s.

The new ships attracted public and professional interest and brought in new orders. Plant payroll expanded to more than a thousand men, but growth brought in management problems.&lt;ref name=T173&gt;Tolf, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Rolf Nobel, Ludwig Nobel Jr. and Hagelin split with Emanuel over the future of diesel-powered shipping.&lt;ref name=T173/&gt; Hagelin's proposal to convert existing steam-powered fleet to diesel engines was rejected by Emanuel. Hagelin quit, and accepted the post of Swedish [[Consul (representative)|consul general]] in Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref name=T173/&gt; In 1907 Hagelin and Johnson designed a 4,500-ton tanker, and again Emanuel Nobel rejected the proposal. The inventors sold their blueprints to Merkulyev Brothers of [[Kolomna]] who built the world's first true seagoing diesel-powered tanker, ''Mysl'', in 1908.&lt;ref name=T173/&gt; This, at last, compelled Emanuel to grant Hagelin sweeping rights to modernize the company fleet that reached 315 vessels in 1915.&lt;ref name=T173/&gt;

Neuendorf, ''Glossary of Geology'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=yD79FqfECCYC&amp;pg=PA723 p. 723]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[rock (geology)|rock]] that has been abraded, pitted, etched, grooved, or polished by wind-driven sand or ice crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Julie E. |last=Laity |chapter=19. Landforms, landscapes, and processes of aeolian erosion |editor-last=Parsons|editor-first=Anthony J.|title=Geomorphology of desert environments|date=2009|publisher=Springer|location=[Dordrecht]|isbn=9781402057199|pages=597–628|edition=2nd.|editor2-last=Abrahams |editor2-first=Athol D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These geomorphic features are most typically found in arid environments where there is little vegetation to interfere with [[aeolian processes|aeolian]] particle transport, where there are frequently strong winds, and where there is a steady but not overwhelming supply of sand.

[[File:Weisse Wüste.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Impressively carved mushrooms are the centerpiece of [[White Desert]] national park, Egypt]]Ventifacts can be abraded to eye-catching natural sculptures such as the main features of the [[White Desert]] near Farafra oasis in Egypt. In moderately tall, isolated rock outcrops, mushroom shaped pillars of rock may form as the outcrop is eroded by [[Saltation (geology)|saltating]] sand grains. This occurs because, even in strong winds, sand grains can't be continuously held in the air. Instead, the particles bounce along the ground, rarely reaching higher than a few feet above the earth. Over time, the bouncing sand grains can erode the lower portions of a ventifact, while leaving a larger less eroded cap. The results can be fantastic stone mushrooms.

Individual stones, such as those forming [[desert pavement]], are often found with grooved, etched, or polished surfaces where these same wind-driven processes have slowly worn away the rock.

Stones with a small number of wind facets have names reflecting this number, e.g.,  [[dreikanter]] is a pyramidal-shaped stone with 3 wind facets (and one buried, rounded side).

When ancient ventifacts are preserved without being moved or disturbed, they may serve as a paleo-wind indicators. The wind direction at the time the ventifact formed will be parallel to grooves or [[Striation (geology)|striations]] cut in the rock. 

Ventifacts have also been discovered on Mars, where such sharp immobile rocks have caused significant damage to the wheels of the [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'' rover]].&lt;ref name=llis&gt;NASA, [https://llis.nasa.gov/lesson/22401 Premature Wear of the MSL Wheels], 2017-09-26&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a [[Mars|Martian]] ventifact was named [[Jake Matijevic (rock)|Jake Matijevic]]. By analyzing its shape, it was possible to reconstruct the main wind direction which sculpted the rock.&lt;ref name="PZ13"&gt;Patrick Zasada (2013) ''Entstehung des Mars-Gesteins "Jake Matijevic"''. [http://www.sternzeit-online.de/ Sternzeit], [http://www.sternzeit-online.de/?p=archiv&amp;q=2%2F2013 issue 2/2013]: pp. 98–101. (German language).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11783">[[Image:LaNina.png|thumb|A schematic diagram of the quasi-equilibrium and [[El Niño|La Niña]] phase of the southern oscillation. The '''Walker circulation''' is seen at the surface as easterly trade winds which move water and air warmed by the sun towards the west. The western side of the equatorial Pacific is characterized by warm, wet low pressure weather as the collected moisture is dumped in the form of typhoons and thunderstorms. The ocean is some 60 cm higher in the western Pacific as the result of this motion. The water and air are returned to the east. Both are now much cooler, and the air is much drier. An El Niño episode is characterised by a breakdown of this water and air cycle, resulting in relatively warm water and moist air in the eastern Pacific.]]
The '''Walker circulation''', also known as the '''Walker cell''', is a conceptual model of the air flow in the [[tropics]] in the lower atmosphere ([[troposphere]]).  According to this model, parcels of air follow a closed circulation in the   [[zonal and meridional|zonal]] and vertical directions. This circulation, which is roughly consistent with observations, is caused by differences in heat distribution between ocean and land.  It was discovered by [[Gilbert Walker]].  In addition to motions in the zonal and vertical direction the tropical atmosphere also has considerable motion in the [[meridional]] direction as part of, for example, the [[Hadley Circulation]].

The term "Walker circulation" was coined in 1969 by the Norwegian-American meteorologist [[Jacob Bjerknes]].&lt;ref&gt;Bjerknes, J. (March 1969) "Atmospheric teleconnections from the equatorial Pacific," ''Monthly Weather Review'', '''97''' (3) :  163–172.  From pp. 167–168:  "It seems reasonalble to assume that it is the gradient of sea temperature along the Equator which is the cause of the thermal circulation entered in figure 8.  Hereafter, in the present article that circulation will be referred to as the "Walker Circulation" since it can be shown to be an important part of the mechanism of Walker's "Southern Oscillation."

==Walker's methodology==
[[Gilbert Walker]] was an established applied mathematician at the [[University of Cambridge]] when he became director-general of observatories in India in 1904.&lt;ref name="IndianBio"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Indian Biographical Dictionary|editor=Rao, C. Hayavando|publisher=Pillar &amp; Co. |location=Madras |date=1915 |page=456 |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Indian_Biographical_Dictionary_%281915%29/Walker,_Gilbert_Thomas|accessdate=2010-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he studied the characteristics of the [[Indian Ocean]] [[monsoon]], the failure of whose rains had brought severe [[famine]] to the country in 1899. Analyzing vast amounts of weather data from India and the rest of the world, over the next fifteen years he published the first descriptions of the great seesaw oscillation of [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] pressure between the Indian and [[Pacific Ocean]], and its correlation to [[temperature]] and rainfall patterns across much of the Earth's tropical regions, including India.  He also worked with the [[Indian Meteorological Department]] especially in linking the monsoon with Southern Oscillation phenomenon. He was made a Companion of the [[Order of the Star of India]] in 1911.&lt;ref name="IndianBio" /&gt;

Walker determined that the time scale of a year (used by many studying the atmosphere) was unsuitable because geospatial relationships could be entirely different depending on the season. Thus, Walker broke his temporal analysis into December–February, March–May, June–August, and September–November.

Walker then selected a number of "centers of action", which included areas such as the Indian Peninsula. The centers were in the hearts of regions with either permanent or seasonal high and low pressures. He also added points for regions where rainfall, wind or temperature was an important control.

He examined the relationships of the summer and winter values of pressure and rainfall, first focusing on summer and winter values, and later extending his work to the spring and autumn.

He concludes that variations in temperature are generally governed by variations in pressure and rainfall. It had previously been suggested that sunspots could be the cause of the temperature variations, but Walker argued against this conclusion by showing monthly correlations of sunspots with temperature, winds, cloud cover, and rain that were inconsistent.

Walker made it a point to publish all of his correlation findings, both of relationships found to be important as well as relationships that were found to be unimportant. He did this for the purpose of dissuading researchers from focusing on correlations that did not exist.

==Oceanic effects==
[[File:Mean sst equatorial pacific.gif|thumb|right|200 px|Average equatorial Pacific temperatures]]
[[File:THERMOCLINE.png|thumb|right|Graph showing a tropical ocean thermocline (depth vs. temperature). &lt;!-- from data collected during the [[International Geophysical Year]]; the data for this plot was collected on May 17, 1957, at roughly 8N, 44W, in the tropical Atlantic. --&gt; Note the rapid change between 100 and 1000 meters. The temperature is nearly constant after 1500 meters depth.]]
The Walker Circulations of the tropical Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic basins result in westerly surface winds in Northern Summer in the first basin and easterly winds in the second and third basins.  As a result, the temperature structure of the three oceans display dramatic asymmetries.  The equatorial Pacific and Atlantic both have cool surface temperatures in Northern Summer in the east, while cooler surface temperatures prevail only in the western Indian Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/watl/about-weather-and-climate/australian-climate-influences.shtml?bookmark=walkercirculation|title=The Walker Circulation|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|author=Bureau of Meteorology|accessdate=2014-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes in surface temperature reflect changes in the depth of the thermocline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2523.1|title=Relationship Between Sea Surface Temperature and Thermocline Depth in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific|author=Zelle, Hein, Gerrian Appledoorn, Gerritt Burgers, and Gert Jan Van Oldenborgh|journal=Journal of Physical Oceanography|volume=34|issue=3|page=643|date=March 2004|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2014-07-01|doi=10.1175/2523.1|bibcode = 2004JPO....34..643Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in the Walker Circulation with time occur in conjunction with changes in surface temperature.  Some of these changes are forced externally, such as the seasonal shift of the Sun into the Northern Hemisphere in summer.  Other changes appear to be the result of coupled ocean-atmosphere feedback in which, for example,  easterly winds cause the sea surface temperature to fall in the east, enhancing the zonal heat contrast and hence intensifying easterly winds across the basin. These enhanced easterlies induce more equatorial upwelling and raise the thermocline in the east, amplifying the initial cooling by the southerlies. This coupled ocean-atmosphere feedback was originally proposed by Bjerknes. From an oceanographic point of view, the equatorial cold tongue is caused by easterly winds. Were the earth climate symmetric about the equator, cross-equatorial wind would vanish, and the cold tongue would be much weaker and have a very different zonal structure than is observed today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=2154325 Ocean-atmosphere interaction in the making of the Walker circulation and equatorial cold tongue]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Walker cell is indirectly related to [[upwelling]] off the coasts of [[Peru]] and [[Ecuador]]. This brings [[nutrient]]-rich cold water to the surface, increasing fishing stocks.&lt;ref name="Jennings"&gt;Jennings, S., Kaiser, M.J., Reynolds, J.D. (2001) "Marine Fisheries Ecology." Oxford: Blackwell Science Ltd. {{ISBN|0-632-05098-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==El Niño==
{{Main|El Niño Southern Oscillation}}
The Walker circulation is caused by the [[pressure gradient force]] that results from a [[High pressure area|high pressure system]] over the eastern Pacific Ocean, and a [[low pressure system]] over [[Indonesia]].  When the Walker circulation weakens or reverses, an [[El Niño]] results, causing the ocean surface to be warmer than average, as upwelling of cold water occurs less or not at all.  An especially strong Walker circulation causes a [[La Niña]], resulting in cooler ocean temperatures due to increased upwelling.

A scientific study published in May 2006 in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' indicates that the Walker circulation has been slowing since the mid-19th Century. The authors argue that [[global warming]] is a likely causative factor in the weakening of the wind pattern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/research/climate/highlights/index.html#walker A tropical atmospheric circulation slow-down]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a new study from The Twentieth Century Reanalysis Project shows that the Walker circulation has not been slowing (or increasing) from 1871–2008.&lt;ref&gt;The Twentieth Century Reanalysis Project. Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 137: 1–28. {{doi|10.1002/qj.776}}, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.776/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;
