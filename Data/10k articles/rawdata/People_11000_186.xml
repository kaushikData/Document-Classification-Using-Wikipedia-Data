      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18571">'''Billy Thompson''', sometimes known as '''Texas Billy Thompson''' (1845 – September 6, 1897) was an [[Old West]] [[gunfighter|gunman]] and [[gambler]], and the younger brother of the famous gunman and [[police officer|lawman]] [[Ben Thompson (lawman)|Ben Thompson]]. The younger Thompson brother never achieved the fame that his brother achieved, and in his own lifetime was mainly referred to as the unpredictable and troubled younger brother of Ben Thompson. Factually, however, while a dangerous man, he also was a formidable opponent in a gunfight.

==Early life, first gunfight==

Born William Thompson in [[Knottingley]], [[Yorkshire]], [[England]], immigrating with his family and older brother to the [[United States of America|United States]] as a child. His family settled in [[Texas]], and during the [[American Civil War]], both his brother and he volunteered for the [[Confederate Army]]. His older brother went on to fame as a gunman and later as a lawmen and [[chief of police]] for [[Austin, Texas]]. Ben Thompson was more stable than his younger brother, having an even temperament, albeit accompanied by a deadly side if need be. Known as having a violent and quick temper, the younger Thompson often found himself in trouble, usually from violence.

His first known gunfight was on March 31, 1868. That day, while attending a fist fight between a [[Caucasian race|White]] man and an [[African American]] man, a US soldier named William Burke became upset that the townspeople favored the black man, this being partly because the army was seen by locals as an occupying force following the war. When he lashed out verbally at Billy, the two argued, then later Burke apologized, asking to buy Billy a drink. The two men spent two hours drinking, then went to a [[bordello]] together. They argued a few times over minor things during their time together, but for the most part, they seemed to have gotten along. After they entered the bordello, Billy Thompson went upstairs with a [[prostitute]], and for reasons unknown, William Burke again flared his temper against Thompson, and began walking the halls shouting threats against him. Finding the room in which Billy had entered, Burke kicked in the door armed with a pistol, and after the two exchanged shots, Burke fell badly wounded, and died the next day. Feeling he would certainly [[Hanging|hang]] for killing a soldier, Thompson fled.

==Notoriety as a killer==
Thompson quickly ran out of money, and sent word to his older brother, a habit he would never break. Two months after the Burke killing, while in [[Rockport, Texas]], Billy Thompson killed another man, Remus Smith, and again fled to avoid arrest. In that instance, Smith, an 18-year-old stable hand, slapped Billy's horse when it tried to nose in on some feed, which enraged Thompson. When he yelled at the boy, Smith, who was unarmed, told him to take off his pistols and come on, at which point Billy Thompson drew his gun and shot the boy twice. Remus Smith was well liked in the area, and some of the county residents hunted for Billy Thompson for the remainder of his lifetime.

For five years, he stayed on the run, often contacting his brother to help him with money. On April 18, 1873, Billy Thompson checked into the Grand Central Hotel in [[Ellsworth, Kansas]]. His older brother Ben joined him two months later, and the two set themselves up in the [[Western saloon|saloon]], Joe Brennan’s, as house gamblers. At the time, Ellsworth was an extremely busy cattle town. [[Sheriff]] [http://www.odmp.org/officer/14118-sheriff-chauncey-belden-whitney Chauncey Whitney] was both well liked in the county, and extremely effective as a lawman. Within a short time of their arrival in town, both Thompson brothers became good friends with Whitney, but at the same time, often had bad experiences with local police officer [[John Morco|John "Happy Jack" Morco]]. Officer Morco was well known for his boasting about how many men he had killed, often heard to say he had shot 12 men dead.

On June 30, 1873, Morco arrested Billy Thompson for carrying a weapon in town limits. Though angered, Thompson paid his fine. On August 15, 1873, Billy Thompson was drinking heavily, and had become extremely intoxicated and vocal. Sheriff Whitney had planned to leave town that day with his family, but feeling Billy might get himself into trouble, he chose to remain in town. That day, Ben Thompson introduced John Sterling into a high-stakes game, on the pretense that due to his introduction, Thompson would take a percentage of any winnings. When Sterling left the saloon with over $1,000, without offering Ben Thompson his share, the latter sought him out. He found Sterling in another saloon, in the company of John Morco.

When Thompson demanded his cut of the winnings, Sterling, aware that Thompson was unarmed, slapped him. John Morco then pulled his pistol and backed Thompson away. Morco and Sterling then stood outside the saloon, yelling for Ben Thompson to come out and fight. Billy Thompson, hearing of his brother's troubles, ran to help him. Both brothers armed themselves, and walked out into the street. Hearing of the trouble, Sheriff Whitney responded, unarmed, and confronted the Thompsons, imploring them to accompany him for a drink and talk the situation over, to which they agreed.

As they walked to Brennan's, Morco and Sterling moved to intercept them. When another Texan yelled a warning to Ben Thompson, the latter turned and fired a rifle shot at the pair, and heard his brother fire his shotgun from behind him. Turning, Ben Thompson saw his friend Sheriff Whitney wither to the ground, shot. Believed to have been accidental, Billy Thompson did not rush to flee. Ben Thompson, upon seeing what had happened, stated, "My God Billy, you have shot your best friend", to which Billy responded, "I'm sorry", followed by Whitney stating, "He did not intend to do it, it was an accident, send for my family". According to later witnesses, Billy Thompson was not looking at Whitney, as Whitney was standing to his side, and had his shotgun cocked, with one barrel suddenly going off.

In later versions of that shooting, it was said his response to his brother Ben, when the latter said, "you've shot your best friend", was, "I'd have shot him if he'd been Jesus Christ". That never happened, nor was it ever said, a fact verified by witnesses years later at his trial. It would be the main fact of Billy Thompson's life that over the decades since has become completely distorted from what actually happened. However, rumors such as that fueled his notoriety, in the shadow of his older brother's fame.

Despite the shooting being accidental, Ben Thompson forced Billy on a horse and ordered him to flee town, but instead of riding fast, he simply rode slowly through, yelling for anyone who wanted to fight to come get him. Ben feared, probably wisely, that regardless of the circumstances surrounding the shooting, Billy would be [[Lynching|lynch]]ed. Sheriff Whitney died on August 18, 1873, resulting in a $500 reward being placed on Billy Thompson. Morco and Officer Ed Hogue ran Neil Cain, a Texas cowboy and friend to the Thompson brothers, out of town at gun point.

John "Happy Jack" Morco was fired over his having instigated the trouble, but not before he issued a warrant against Ben Thompson for assault, resulting in officer Ed Hogue arresting Ben. A short time later, the town council dismissed the entire police force, replacing it with new personnel. Citizens vocally expressed their anger toward visiting Texas cowboys in town from cattle drives. Town Marshal Ed Crawford instigated a dispute, then beat one Texas cowboy, Cad Pierce, to death with his pistol during an arrest, after first shooting him in the side, and groups of [[vigilante]]s roamed the streets looking to run out of town any Texans they found causing trouble.

Not long after the Whitney killing, Morco, during a rant of boasting during a dispute with one Texan, was shot and killed by newly appointed Ellsworth police officer J. C. Brown in front of the Lizzie Palmer Dancehall. Ed Crawford was shot and killed a short time afterward by friends of Pierce, and Ed Hogue left town. With the shooting deaths of Sheriff Whitney and Remus Smith, Thompson became known as the troubled and dangerous younger brother of Ben Thompson, although this was not exactly the truth. With the exception of Remus Smith, which was a clear case of cold-blooded murder, his other two shootings had been one in self defense and another accidental.

==Life on the run==

For the next several years, Billy Thompson lived on the run from lawmen and [[bounty hunter]]s. The [[Aransas County, Texas]], Sheriffs Office regularly sent out warrants to Texas lawmen around the state, seeking Thompson for the murder of Remus Smith. In June 1874, Billy Thompson narrowly escaped capture in Austin, Texas. Later that same year, he was captured in [[Mountain City, Texas]], but escaped and fled to [[San Antonio, Texas]], where he entered the Long Horse brothel with a friend. While there, he hit a prostitute across the face, fleeing when two city police officers responded, resulting in a foot pursuit in which he again escaped.

He avoided lawmen for another two years, until [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] [[Police captain|Captain]] John Sparks caught up to him in October, 1876, in [[Travis County, Texas]]. Sparks was leading a small Ranger unit that was actually seeking rancher Neal Cain for [[cattle rustling]]. While raiding the Cain ranch, they came into contact with Billy Thompson. Ben Thompson was notified of his brother's arrest, and immediately sought an attorney to represent him. Ben Thompson also notified Aransas County, in the hopes that they would [[extradite]] him to stand trial for that murder, rather than being sent to Kansas.

A number of Ben Thompson's allies boarded a [[train]] in [[Corsicana, Texas]], and word of this was passed to Ranger Sparks. By this time, Ranger Sparks was feeling that an attempt would be made to free his prisoner by friends of Ben Thompson, so while in [[Dallas County, Texas]], he requested additional guards from the county sheriff, and received several. With this overwhelming show of force, all rescue attempts to keep Billy Thompson out of Kansas were thwarted. Initially, the town of Ellsworth sought to have Billy jailed in [[Salina, Kansas]], feeling the jail there was more secure. However, with several more Thompson partisans showing up in town, the decision was made instead to house him at [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|Leavenworth]].

==Trial and release==

Ben Thompson hired local Kansas attorney Robert Gill to represent Billy. He later added Captain J. D. Mohler, Phillip T. Pendelton, and A. H. Case to the legal team. Court convened on September 3, 1874, with [[Judge]] John Prescott presiding. The [[prosecution]] had over a dozen witnesses to the shooting, while the defense had only six, one of whom was from Texas, with the other five being from Kansas. As it turned out, the defense witness William Purdy, from [[Atchison County, Kansas]], emerged as the most dependable witness presented.

Purdy, standing nearby, was an [[Witness|eye witness]] to the shooting, and heard clearly everything said by all those involved. His testimony was;

"Billy was standing still or trying to do so, as he was intoxicated. He had his eyes fixed on the party advancing on Ben and him. The shot of Ben did not stop them and they continued the same as before, and when being within about 20 feet of Billy Thompson, his gun being down below his breast, it went off, one barrel of it only, and the shot took effect on the shoulder and side of Whitney. Billy's gun was cocked, he did not bring the gun up, took no aim, nor was he looking at Whitney, who stood at his left. As the gun discharged, Ben said, 'My God Billy you have shot your best friend', Billy replied, 'I'm sorry', Whitney said, 'He did not intend to do it, it was an accident, send for my family'. There was no indication at any time that Whitney and the Thompson's weren't on the best of terms."

Others also testified of Whitney's statement after being shot, with the only difference being that some said he stated, "send for my wife and child" rather than "for my family". The prosecution objected many times, claiming certain things were "irrelevant" or [[hearsay]], but they did not object to Whitney's dying declaration. A rumor that Billy Thompson stated after the shooting, "I'd have shot him if he were Jesus Christ", rather than "I'm sorry", was never mentioned, nor did it ever happen.

In a trial that lasted nine days, Billy Thompson was [[acquitted]]. Although that case was proven to have been accidental, amazingly, he was not held to be extradited to Aransas County, Texas, for the clear-cut murder of Remus Smith, but instead was released. For the next three years, his whereabouts were mostly rumors, but he is known to have arrived in [[Dodge City, Kansas]], in May 1878. He is known to have been arrested by lawman [[Mart Duggan]] in [[Leadville, Colorado]], in December 1879, for disturbing the peace, serving only one night in jail. Aransas County, in the meantime, continued its pursuit of him.

==Another shooting==

On June 21, 1880, Billy Thompson was in [[Ogallala, Nebraska]]. A saloon owner named Bill Tucker and he had developed strong resentment for one another, supposedly over the affections of a prostitute named "Big Alice". Billy Thompson, drunk, stood in front of the saloon and fired two shots inside. The second of the shots hit Tucker in the hand, taking off one finger and mutilating others. Enraged, Tucker grabbed a shotgun and ran after the now-fleeing Billy. Tucker fired two shots, missing, reloaded and fired two more, this time riddling Billy Thompson in the back, from his heels to his neck. Billy Thompson was arrested, but allowed to remain under guard at the Ogallala House Hotel to heal. Knowing his brother Ben's reputation, the local sheriff ordered a heavy guard.

Ben Thompson, hearing of his brother's arrest, felt his intervening would result in bloodshed. Instead, he asked his friend [[Bat Masterson]] to travel to Ogllala to see if he could assist. Masterson did so, first meeting with Billy, then meeting with the ailing Tucker, who was bitter, but willing to drop charges, for a price. Unfortunately, Ben Thompson did not have access to the amount Tucker wanted, so Bat Masterson eluded the guards and helped Billy escape, with them taking a train south. After the escape, a [[Keith County, Nebraska]], [[grand jury]] indicted Billy for assault with intent to kill. Those charges were eventually dropped, and the matter forgotten.

==Arrest and trial for Smith murder==

On October 23, 1882, Texas Ranger Captain George W. Baylor captured Billy for the Remus Smith murder in [[El Paso, Texas]], and turned him over to the [[El Paso County, Texas|El Paso County]] Sheriff, where he was remanded to the custody of Deputy Frank Manning to be returned to Rockport. Foolishly, Deputy Manning allowed Billy Thompson a night of freedom before his return, on the pretense he would return the next morning. He did not. On May 10, 1883, Aransas County Deputy P.P. Court captured Thompson in Arkansas, and finally he was returned to stand trial for the Smith murder.

However, it had been 15 years since the murder. Witnesses were sparse, and facts distorted due to poor records, with all of the lawmen who were serving at the time having long since moved on. The trial took only one day, with Thompson being acquitted. This was the one killing committed by Billy Thompson that should have been an iron-clad case of murder, but due to the many years that had passed, the prosecution could not prove their case. The case against him for the murder of soldier William Burke had never been pressed, with the general feeling that it was self defense. For the first time since his first killing, Billy Thompson was not wanted by the law for anything.

==Later life==

On March 11, 1884, his older brother Ben Thompson was killed in [[San Antonio, Texas]], in what became referred to as the [[Vaudeville Theater Ambush]]. For a time, newspapers speculated that Billy Thompson would seek revenge for his brother's death, but he never did. He roamed for a number of years, making his living as a gambler, and is believed to have never held any other employment, passing through [[Cripple Creek, Colorado]], and often spending long periods in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] and [[Galveston, Texas]].

He died of a stomach ailment in Houston, on September 6, 1897.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/32173337 Billy Thompson at Find a grave]&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, Billy Thompson had killed four men, and wounded a fifth, with one killing being the shooting of the unarmed Remus Smith, another the accidental shooting of Sheriff Chauncey Whitney, and the other two killings and one wounding being during gunfights.

The role of Thompson was played by the character actor [[Hal Baylor]] in a 1955 episode of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Desilu]] Western [[television series]], ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'', with [[Hugh O'Brian]] in the title role. [[Denver Pyle]] played Ben Thompson in eight ''Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp'' episodes, which aired from 1955 to 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0631764/?ref_=tt_ep_ep3|title=Bill Thompson Gives In", September 20, 1955|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Percy of Scandia''', also known as the original '''[[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]]''', is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He was a [[medieval]] [[knight]] created by [[writer]]-[[editing|editor]] [[Stan Lee]] and [[artist]] [[Joe Maneely]].

== Publication history ==
Marvel Comics' first Black Knight, Sir Percy of [[Scandia]], [[first appearance|first appeared]] in the medieval-adventure series ''Black Knight'' #1-5 (May-Dec. 1955) from [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], the 1950s precursor to Marvel Comics. The five-issue series was written by Stan Lee, with art by Joe Maneely in the first three interiors and all five covers. [[Fred Kida]] and the team of [[penciller]] [[Syd Shores]] and [[inker]] [[Christopher Rule]] drew stories in the latter two issues.&lt;ref name=gcd&gt;[https://www.comics.org/series/1120/ ''Black Knight'' (Marvel, 1955 series)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]. Accessed on August 22, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Percy appeared in [[Mystic Arcana]], representing the element of earth.

== Fictional character biography ==
The original Black Knight is '''Sir Percy of [[Scandia]]''', a 6th-century knight who serves at the court of [[King Arthur (Marvel Comics)|King Arthur Pendragon]] as his greatest warrior and one of the Knights of the Round Table. Recruited by the wizard [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)#Merlin of Legend|Merlin]], Percy adopts a double identity, and pretends to be totally incompetent until changing into the persona of the Black Knight. As the Black Knight, Percy wields the '''[[Ebony Blade]]''', which Merlin forged from a meteorite.&lt;ref&gt;''Black Knight'' vol. 1, #1-5 (May-Dec. 1955), [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], the 1950s precursor of Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; A constant foe of the evil knight [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred the Evil]] (Arthur's traitorous "nephew") and [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]], in time Sir Percy retired his dual identity and married Lady Rosamund.

Percy is eventually killed at Castle Scandia by Mordred during the fall of Camelot when stabbed from behind with an enchanted blade made of the same material as his own Ebony Blade - although Mordred then dies himself of wounds inflicted by Arthur during the [[Battle of Camlann]] earlier that day.&lt;ref name="msh"&gt;''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #17 (Nov. 1968)&lt;/ref&gt;  Merlin ensures that Percy's spirit will live on by casting a spell that will revive his ghost if Mordred should ever return.

Sir Percy was survived by a son, Geoffrey. Lady Rosamund later gave birth to his second son, Edward the Posthumous, who reportedly became ancestor of "a proud lineage". Several of Sir Percy's descendants adopted the identity of the Black Knight: '''Sir Raston''', active during the late 6th and early 7th century, who eventually became an agent of the [[time travel]]er [[Kang the Conqueror]]; and '''Sir Eobar Garrington''', a 12th-century knight serving under [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] during the [[Third Crusade]].

Percy's spirit has appeared several times to counsel his descendant, [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Dane Whitman]]. He first appeared as a ghost to act as a mentor to Dane, revealing the circumstances of his death,&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #17 (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared a number of times subsequently as a ghost, summoned to give advice.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers''#71; ''Avengers''#84; ''Avengers''#100&lt;/ref&gt; Percy was eventually released from the mortal plane by [[Doctor Strange]].&lt;ref&gt;''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 2 #2&lt;/ref&gt;

His spirit again appeared to Dane Whitman, revealing how he wed Lady Rosamund. His spirit then took possession of Dane's body.&lt;ref&gt;''Black Knight'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; With Doctor Strange, he fought Morgan le Fay and Balor, and was rescued by [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]]. He then made [[Bloodwraith|Sean Dolan]] his squire.&lt;ref&gt;''Black Knight'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; His spirit then took possession of the Ebony Blade itself.&lt;ref&gt;''Black Knight'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
The Black Knight was an athletic man with no superhuman powers.  He was a master of swordsmanship, horseback riding and all forms of combat known in Britain at the time of Camelot. He was also a talented poet, singer and musician with the lute.

Percy wielded the [[Ebony Blade]], and [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)|Merlin]]'s spells rendered the Black Knight invulnerable to physical harm as long as he held the Ebony Blade. However, the spells were ineffective against a weapon made of the same metal as the Ebony Blade. He also wore body armor and a helmet which were similarly rendered impenetrable by Merlin's spells.

==In other media==
===Television===
Sir Percy appeared in the ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' episode "Knights &amp; Demons" (which was scripted by [[Don Glut]]), voiced by [[Vic Perrin]].{{cn|date=May 2016}} Dane Whitman was also to appear, but was rejected to avoid confusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/spider-man-and-his-amazing-friends/knights-andamp-demons/episode/223004/summary.html TV.com episode entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video game===
Sir Percy appears in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ign.com/wikis/lego-marvel-super-heroes-2/Characters&lt;/ref&gt; He resides in the Medieval England section of Chronopolis where his castle was taken over by Enchantress and Nathan Garrett who imprison him. Nathan Garrett impersonated Sir Percy until Captain Avalon exposed his identity. After Captain America, Captain Avalon, Doctor Strange, and Star-Lord defeat Enchantress and Nathan Garrett, Sir Percy is freed by Doctor Strange who thanks the heroes for helping to reclaim his kingdom.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3622">'''Caroline Eden''' (''née'' Calvert; born {{circa|1745}}) was the daughter of [[Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore]], and sister of [[Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore]]. She married [[Sir Robert Eden, 1st Baronet, of Maryland|Sir Robert Eden]], the last colonial Governor of Maryland, and was the mother of [[Sir Frederick Eden, 2nd Baronet]].

==Early life==
She was a daughter of [[Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore]], and wife Mary Janssen. She had an older brother, [[Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore|Frederick Calvert]] (1731–1771) who succeeded his father to become the 6th and final [[Baron Baltimore]], and a sister, Hon. Louisa Calvert. The Barons Baltimore were lords proprietors of the [[Province of Maryland|Maryland Colony]] of [[British America]], granting them semi-feudal control of the province, including the right to collect taxes, establish courts and appoint the governor.

==American Revolution==
On 26 April 1763 Caroline married [[Sir Robert Eden, 1st Baronet, of Maryland|Robert Eden]] (1741–1784).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lundy |first=Darryl |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p7644.htm#i76439 |title= Caroline Calvert at www.thepeerage.com |publisher= The Peerage}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y |date=February 2013}}&lt;!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--&gt; Retrieved 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1769, Eden was appointed governor of Maryland; he would be the last colonial governor of the province.

Upon the death of her brother, [[Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore]], the colony of Maryland passed to Frederick's illegitimate son, [[Henry Harford]]. Despite his illegitimacy, the people of Maryland initially supported Harford and welcomed him as their new Lord Proprietor, even naming [[Harford County, Maryland]] after him in 1773. However, Governor [[Sir Robert Eden, 1st Baronet, of Maryland|Robert Eden]] disputed Harford's inheritance, and in 1774 tried to claim a part of the estate on behalf of his wife Caroline.

Before the English courts could rule on the case, the [[American Revolution]] broke out. Caroline Eden would however lose her claim - Harford succeeded in winning his father's inheritance; the rents from the Calvert estates in Britain were awarded to Harford by Act of Parliament - the Estate Act of 1780. But in 1781 the new [[State of Maryland]] confiscated all of Henry Harford's estates and used their income to help finance the cash-strapped revolutionary government and its militia. After the war Harford made strenuous efforts to win compensation but without success.

==Legacy==
In 1773 [[Caroline County, Maryland]], was named in her honor. The county was formed from land belonging to [[Dorchester County, Maryland|Dorchester County]] and [[Queen Anne's County]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carolinemd.org/ www.carolinemd.org] Retrieved September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Chinese name|[[Chen (surname)|Chen]]}}

'''Chen Zuyi''' ({{zh|t=陳祖義|w='''''Ch'en Tsu-i'''''}}; died 1407) was a 15th-century Chinese [[pirate]] from [[Guangdong]], and was one of the most feared pirates to ever infest the seas of Southeast Asia. He ruled the city of [[Palembang]], and raided the [[Strait of Malacca]] to plunder shipping and prey on both native and foreign merchants for several years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/hero-of-the-ming-dynasty-the-man-who-mapped-the-world-417584.html |title=Hero of the Ming Dynasty: The man who mapped the world - Asia - World |publisher=The Independent |date=2006-09-26 |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7066/is_28/ai_n28437719/pg_2/&lt;/ref&gt; until his defeat by Admiral [[Zheng He]] in 1407. Chen was executed at [[Nanjing]] later the same year.

==Early career==
According to Ming records &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/features/world/asia/china/zheng-he-text/3 |title=China's Great Armada, Admiral Zheng He - National Geographic Magazine |publisher=Ngm.nationalgeographic.com |date=2012-05-15 |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; his name is first recorded after 1400, when a Ming convoy was attacked by pirates commanded by Chen Zuyi.
At Palembang Chen had 5,000 men and 10 ships under his command, and was the strongest pirate of Southeast Asia at the time. The island of [[Sumatra]] had a diverse ethnicity of people from different parts of Asia, including a large minority of Han Chinese population (mostly male migrants, traders and merchants), and as well as the majority Sumatrans. A [[Hui people|Hui Chinese]], [[Shi Jinqing]], reported the atrocities committed by the pirate chieftains, and requested assistance to help get rid of Chen Zuyi.

== Defeat by Zheng He ==
In 1407 Chen was confronted at Palembang by the returning [[Treasure voyages|Imperial treasure fleet]] under Admiral [[Zheng He]].  
Zheng made the opening gambit, demanding Chen's surrender,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2005/07/china-armada/viviano-text/5 |title=China's Great Armada - National Geographic Magazine |publisher=Ngm.nationalgeographic.com |date=2012-05-15 |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the pirate quickly signalled agreement—while preparing for a surprise pre-emptive strike. But details of his plan had been provided to Zheng by a local Chinese informant, and in the fierce battle that ensued, the Ming soldiers and Ming superior armada finally [[Treasure voyages#First voyage|destroyed the pirate fleet and killed 5,000 of its men]]. Chen was captured and held for public execution in Nanjing in 1407. Peace was finally restored to the Strait of Malacca as Shi Jinqing was installed as Palembang's new ruler and incorporated into what would become a far-flung system of allies who acknowledged Ming supremacy in return for diplomatic recognition, military protection, and trading rights. By the end of the Yongle reign, the kings or ambassadors of more than 30 foreign states had paid official visits to the emperor bearing tribute. They were ferried to China in luxurious staterooms on the [[Chinese treasure ship]]s.

== In popular culture ==
Chen Zuyi is portrayed by the actor Hou Xiangling in the 2009 Chinese television series ''[[Zheng He Xia Xiyang (TV series)|Zheng He Xia Xiyang]]'', which marked the 600th anniversary of Zheng He's voyages; actor [[Gallen Lo]] starred as Zheng He. Chen's defeat was considered the most famous of all Zheng He's military achievements.

'''Daniella Cicarelli Lemos''' (born November 6, 1978) is an [[Italy|Italian]]-[[Brazil]]ian former fashion model and TV show hostess for [[MTV Brasil]]'s ''[[Beija Sapo]]''. She was engaged to Brazilian footballer [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] for three months in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-05/12/content_441435.htm |title=China Daily |publisher=China Daily |date=2005-05-12 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==YouTube controversy==
In September 2006, a video of Cicarelli having sex with her boyfriend on a beach in [[Tarifa]], Spain&lt;ref&gt;[http://oglobo.globo.com/cultura/mat/2006/09/28/285875345.asp Justiça mantém liminar que obriga sites a tirar vídeo de Cicarelli com namorado do ar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308025739/http://oglobo.globo.com/cultura/mat/2006/09/28/285875345.asp |date=March 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was shot by [[paparazzi|paparazzo]] Miguel Temprano and broadcast on the TV show ''Dolce Vita'' on the Spanish station [[Telecinco]]. The video was spread around the internet, with Cicarelli being granted legal injunctions against [[YouTube]] and other websites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://idgnow.uol.com.br/internet/2006/09/21/idgnoticia.2006-09-21.3066359412 |title=Cicarelli processa Globo, iG e YouTube por causa de vídeo de paparazzo - Internet - IDG Now! |publisher=Idgnow.uol.com.br |date=2006-09-21 |accessdate=2012-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618180255/http://idgnow.uol.com.br/internet/2006/09/21/idgnoticia.2006-09-21.3066359412/ |archivedate=2012-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to several Brazilian ISPs blocking YouTube. In January 2007 after a legal decision, YouTube was blocked in Brazil for two days, resulting in 5.7 million users being blocked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6233693.stm | work=BBC News | title=Brazil model wins YouTube battle | date=January 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was criticized by internet watch groups for being an extremely selfish act. This happened when Cicarelli worked as a host on MTV Brasil, provoking a torrent of nearly 80,000 emails protesting against the blockade and her legal actions. Some people even went to the building of the TV station to protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulp.com.br/noticia/protesto-na-mtv-contra-cicarelli |title=Protesto na MTV contra Cicarelli Gulp Â¬ Links Â¬Â¬ by Gulp Â¬ Links Â¬Â¬ |publisher=Gulp.com.br |date=2007-01-13 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Louis Belanger, Canada |url=http://globalvoices.org/2007/01/12/cicarelli-case-censorship-and-boycott-dialectics-in-the-brazilian-blogosphere |title=Cicarelli Case: Censorship and Boycott Dialectics in the Brazilian Blogosphere · Global Voices |publisher=Globalvoices.org |date=2007-01-12 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terra.com.br/istoegente/386/reportagens/capa_cicarelli.htm |title=ISTOÉ Gente |publisher=Terra.com.br |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, YouTube won the case, based on the fact that there is no expectation of privacy on a public beach. Cicarelli appealed and in 2008 the Supreme Court of the state of São Paulo changed the decision, on grounds of lack of public interest and invasion of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://idgnow.uol.com.br/internet/2008/06/12/daniella-cicarelli-ganha-acao-contra-youtube-em-bloqueio-de-video |title=Daniella Cicarelli ganha ação contra YouTube em bloqueio de vídeo - Internet - IDG Now! |publisher=Idgnow.uol.com.br |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615181704/http://idgnow.uol.com.br/internet/2008/06/12/daniella-cicarelli-ganha-acao-contra-youtube-em-bloqueio-de-video/ |archivedate=2008-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit isn't finished yet, because YouTube appealed and now wait for the judgment by the Federal Supreme Court. YouTube remains active in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=a_17Uu0NazR0&amp;refer=exclusive Sex Video of Merrill Banker, MTV Host Eclipses Brazil Election], Bloomberg.com, September 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6233693.stm Brazil model wins YouTube battle ], BBC News, January 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Pt_icon}} [http://conjur.estadao.com.br/static/text/51792,1 A Dona da Ação - Cicarelli é autora do processo contra o YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson |first=Nate |url=https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070627-youtube-wins-privacy-case-against-brazilian-supermodel.html |title=YouTube wins "supermodel sex on the beach" case |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=2007-06-28 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Charles Haddon Hunt''' (September 30, 1926 – April 5, 2013) was an American [[Christian]] [[apologist]], speaker, radio commentator and author. He was in full-time ministry from 1973 until his death. ''The Berean Call'', which highlights Hunt's material, was started in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/bold-loving-christian-apologist-dave-hunt-passes-away-at-age-87-93846/ |title='Bold, Loving' Christian Apologist Dave Hunt Passes Away at Age 87 |publisher=The Christian Post |accessdate=2015-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1999 to 2010, he also hosted ''Search the Scriptures Daily'' radio ministry alongside T.A. McMahon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thebereancall.org/radio|publisher=The Berean Call | title=Radio | date=2013-10-24| accessdate=2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt traveled to the [[Near East]], lived in Egypt, and wrote numerous books on theology, prophecy, cults, and other religions, including critiques of [[Catholicism]], [[Islam]], [[Mormonism]], and [[Calvinism]], among others. 
Hunt's Christian theology was [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Dispensationalism#|dispensational]] and he was associated with the [[Plymouth Brethren]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chick.com/information/authors/hunt.asp |title=About Dave Hunt |publisher=Chick.com |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
David Charles Haddon Hunt was born on September 30, 1926, in [[Riverside, California]], to Lillie and Albert Hunt. He was raised in a Christian family, with two other siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thebereancall.org/content/about-dave-hunt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202060641/https://www.thebereancall.org/content/about-dave-hunt|dead-url=no|archive-date=2018-02-02|title=About Dave Hunt|publisher=The Berean Call|accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young man, he also spent time in the military, at the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowtheendbegins.com/end-times-prophecy-author-dave-hunt-has-died|title=End Times Prophecy Author Dave Hunt Has Died|publisher=Now The End Begins.com|date=2013-04-06|accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an alumnus of [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. From June 24, 1950, until his death, Hunt was married to his college sweetheart, Ruth Klaussen (1926&amp;ndash;2013), who together raised four children: David Jr., Janna, Karen and Jon. He worked as a [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]] before his entry into full-time ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebereancall.org/content/about-dave-hunt-0 |title=The Berean Call: About Dave Hunt |publisher=The Berean Call |accessdate=2015-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229054159/http://www.thebereancall.org/content/about-dave-hunt-0 |archivedate=2014-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions==
Hunt believed occult or pagan influences are pervasive in modern culture - this includes evolution, as well as all forms of psychology, some forms of entertainment, yoga, and some forms of medicine. His book ''Occult Invasion'' is dedicated to this area, while several other books mention it in part.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebereancall.org/sites/2011.thebereancall.org/files/Occult%20Invasion%20Chapter%20One.pdf Chapter One] Hunt, Dave (2010). ''Occult Invasion'' The Berean Call. {{ISBN|978-1-928660-60-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creationism===
Hunt was a strict Biblical [[Creationist]] - refutations of [[evolution]] and [[theistic evolution]] were a frequent topic of his radio programs, ''Search the Scriptures Daily'' and ''According to God's Word''.

{{quote|...I think you’ve got to be very stubborn to reject God and to say evolution—it all happened by chance. No rational person could support that thesis. And I would challenge anybody....—you know the more they get down—when we discovered electron microscopes and we got down to the molecular level of life, we found that it was far more complex than Darwin realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = The Berean Call | title = Can You Believe in the Bible and Evolution? | url=http://www.thebereancall.org/content/can-you-believe-bible-and-evolution | accessdate = 2015-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Calvinism===
Hunt addressed [[Calvinism]] in a book called ''What Love is This? Calvinism's Misrepresentation of God'', published in 2002 and revised in 2004 and 2006. He sought to refute many alleged misconceptions of Calvinism without taking an [[Arminian]] stance. He outlined a theological middle ground between Calvinism and Arminianism, where, according to Hunt, one can believe in eternal security but reject Calvinistic teaching.  
Also published in 2004 was ''Debating Calvinism: Five Points, Two Views'', co-written in a point-counterpoint debate format by Hunt and Calvinist apologist [[James White (theologian)|James White]].

===Catholicism===
In ''A Woman Rides the Beast'', he identified the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as the [[Whore of Babylon]] from the prophecies in chapters 17 and 18 of the [[Book of Revelation]].

===Mormonism===
The book ''[[The God Makers (film)|The Godmakers]]'' (1984), which Dave Hunt co-wrote with [[Ed Decker]], and the accompanying film ''[[The God Makers (film)|The God Makers]]'' (1982) by Jeremiah Films were an exposé of [[Mormonism]], highlighting the Mormon belief that Jesus is the spirit brother of Lucifer and many other disturbing facts. The book and film have been criticized not only by Mormons themselves as inaccurate portrayals of their religion but also as inaccurate by other non-Mormon groups that are critical of Mormonism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPPx-WM3KTw |title=The Godmakers |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-11-20 |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
In 1973 he wrote the screenplay for ''Time to Run,'' a Christian film produced for the [[Billy Graham]] Evangelistic Association (Hunt later criticized Graham's ministry for its open [[ecumenism]]).

''The Seduction of Christianity'' (co-written with Tom A. McMahon), which categorized [[Word of Faith]] teachings, meditation, and psychology-based counseling as [[New Age]] heresies, generated much debate in the 1980s. Responses from meditation proponents and from Calvinist re-constructionist writers include ''Seduction?? A Biblical Response'' and ''The Reduction of Christianity''. Hunt has written a rejoinder to the latter critics in his ''Whatever Happened to Heaven?''

Hunt wrote about [[Y2K]] with the intent of refuting the fearful predictions being made by other Christian fundamentalist writers (Y2K: A Reasoned Response To Mass Hysteria).

In his final book, "Cosmos, Creator and Human Destiny", Hunt supported the Creationist viewpoint and alleged that there were deficiencies in both the Big Bang theory and the theory of evolution.

The '''Duru''' (singular Al Darai ) is a tribe of the [[United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates (UAE)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64689681|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=1941-|first=Heard-Bey, Frauke,|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|year=|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=525|oclc=64689681}}&lt;/ref&gt; A relatively small tribe, they nevertheless managed to intersperse themselves in a number of territorial conflicts which broke out throughout the Trucial States in the 20th Century.

== Conflict with Awamir ==
Although the Duru were on good terms with the [[Al Bu Shamis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64689681|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=1941-|first=Heard-Bey, Frauke,|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|year=|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=64|oclc=64689681}}&lt;/ref&gt; and considered themselves dependents of [[Dubai]], they were in conflict with the warlike [[Awamir]], who encroached on their ''dar'' or territory. In the 1920s, in [[Liwa Oasis|Liwa]] and [[Al Buraimi Governorate|Buraimi]], fighting broke out between the [[Bedouin]] tribes, with the [[Manasir (tribe)|Manasir]] and [[Bani Yas]] fighting a southern confederation of Awamir, Duru and Al Bu Shamis. An ally of the [[Saudi Arabia|Wahhabis]], Hamdan managed to broker an uneasy truce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/945874284|title=The Origins of the United Arab Emirates : a Political and Social History of the Trucial States.|last=Said.|first=Zahlan, Rosemarie|date=2016|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=|isbn=9781317244653|location=|pages=82|oclc=945874284}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, fighting broke out again in the Buraimi oasis, between the Duru, Manasir and [[Bani Qitab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/945874284|title=The Origins of the United Arab Emirates : a Political and Social History of the Trucial States.|last=Said.|first=Zahlan, Rosemarie|date=2016|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=|isbn=9781317244653|location=|pages=82|oclc=945874284}}&lt;/ref&gt; The escalating conflict provided an early challenge for the new Ruler of [[Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi,]] [[Sultan bin Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan|Sheikh Sultan bin Zayed Al Nahyan]], who marched against the Duru in December 1923.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/945874284|title=The Origins of the United Arab Emirates : a Political and Social History of the Trucial States.|last=Said.|first=Zahlan, Rosemarie|date=2016|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=|isbn=9781317244653|location=|pages=83|oclc=945874284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Word got out of his movement and the Duru and Awamir raised a force, together with the Bani Qitab of [[Al Falayah Fort|Falayah]], which met a party of 20 riders from Abu Dhabi and killed seven of them and captured the rest. Raising a force of 200 men, the Northern confederation raided Buraimi while Sultan's forces raided Falayah. The Duru, understanding that men from Dubai had been supporting Sultan, raided Dubai in revenge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Saudi influence ==
A concerted effort at conciliation followed, as the various Trucial Rulers recognised that the ongoing conflicts were threatening to descend into a state of general war. The Duru, as well as the Al Bu Shamis, sought the protection of the Wahhabi agent, Ibn Jaluwi, who was only too pleased to extend his influence among the tribes of the Trucial States and Oman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/945874284|title=The Origins of the United Arab Emirates : a Political and Social History of the Trucial States.|last=Said.|first=Zahlan, Rosemarie|date=2016|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=|isbn=9781317244653|location=|pages=84|oclc=945874284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This led to an ongoing and bloody conflict and in the 1940s, fighting led the headman of the Bedouin Awamir, Salim bin Hamad bin Rakkad, to lead his people to [[Al-Hasa|Al Hasa]] in 1943. They returned in 1948, but in subsequent years were constantly drawn back to Hasa.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64689681|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=1941-|first=Heard-Bey, Frauke,|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|year=|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=40|oclc=64689681}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the tribe remained at Buraimi and petitioned the [[Al Nahyan family|Al Bu Falah]] for protection. One of [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan|Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s first acts when he was appointed ''[[wali]]'' of Al Ain was to call for Salim bin Mussalam bin Hamm and appoint him as head of the Bedouin Awamir. The portion of the tribe which had moved south under Salim bin Hamad became [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] citizens and this schism within the Awamir, driven by the Duru, was later to form part of the territorial arguments put forward in the [[Buraimi Dispute]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Political career==
At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|1906 general election]], Fiennes was elected as [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Banbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Banbury]] and with a brief interruption in 1910, held the seat until the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|1918 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;Who's Who&lt;/ref&gt; He was also [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to [[Winston Churchill]] (then [[First Lord of the Admiralty]]) from 1912–14. Created a [[baronet]] in 1916, Fiennes left the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Commons]] two years later to become [[List of Governors of the Seychelles|Governor of the Seychelles]] and was then [[Governor of the Leeward Islands]] from 1921-29.&lt;ref&gt;Who's Who&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiennes died in 1943 aged 78 and his title was inherited by his son who died the same year. His grandson, the famous explorer Sir [[Ranulph Fiennes]], inherited the title on his birth in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Who's Who&lt;/ref&gt; Through his grandfather the [[Frederick Fiennes, 16th Baron Saye and Sele|16th Baron Saye and Sele]], Fiennes is also related to the actors [[Ralph Fiennes|Ralph]] and [[Joseph Fiennes]].

'''Florentino López Alonso-Cuevillas''' (November 14, 1886 - July 30, 1958) was a Spanish [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] and prehistorian, although in the course of his life he also became involved in writing, primarily essays and fiction. Like several other Galician intellectuals of his generation, he was a member of ''[[Xeración Nós]]'', of the [[Seminario de Estudos Galegos|Seminar of Galician Studies]] and the [[Irmandades da Fala]], combining the cultural and linguistic activities he carried out in those institutions with a discrete participation in [[Galicianism|pro-Galican]] politics. However, his social and political activities were profoundly disrupted by the victory of nationalists in the [[Spanish Civil War]], although in the 1940s he returned to his commitment to the spread of Galician culture as a full member of the [[Royal Galician Academy]], and of the [[Instituto de Estudios Gallegos Padre Sarmiento]].

Like the other members of his generation, he contributed to the maturation of Galician literature, but he was renown as a result of his efforts in the field of science. Galvanized by [[Hugo Obermaier|Hugo Obermaier's]] book (''Impresiones de un viaje prehistórico por Galicia''), Cuevillas undertook the complicated task of developing the field of archeology in Galicia with the aim of reconstructing and studying a period of history that had been hitherto forgotten. His field research, mostly directed at the study of [[megalithic art]] and the [[celts|celtic]] [[Castro culture]], as well as his systematization of Galician prehistory, lead him to be crowned as the most important figure in Galicia in the field of prehistory. Indirectly, his scientific work contributed to the normalization of the [[Galician language|Galician]] language.

== Biography ==
Florentino López Alonso-Cuevillas was born on November 14, 1886 at 77 Progress Street, Ourense. He was the only son of don Florentino López Barbán, an agent of the tax office who practiced his profession in Ourense as well as [[Lugo]], and doña Vicenta Alonso-Cuevillas Álvarez, daughter of a famous brigadier who carried out many important military duties in Ourense and who belonged to the prestigious Seara family.

Cuevillas's father's death in Lugo before his birth quickly caused his mother to  move in with her family in Ourense. From that moment on, Florentino Cuevillas was raised and educated by his maternal family, receiving an education few people would have been able to afford at that time. As a preschooler he attended a girl's school, which accepted very young children, and later attended the Colegio León XIII. It was at this time that he began to develop an interest in music, and he went on to learn the violin in his youth. Between 1896 and 1901 he studied at the Instituto de Orense where he was taught by teachers of great renown, such as the professor of rhetoric and poetry, [[Marcelo Macías]]. After five years of study he completed his baccalaureate studies (at the time still regulated by the Ley Moyano), and subsequently attended the University of Santiago de Compostela to study pharmacology, although he never went on to practice that profession. During the course of his college years, he displayed a great interest in literature and during this time he attended literary outings of the Ateneo León XIII as well as conferences organized by the alumni of the medical and legal departments. He was licensed in June 1906, and five years later he moved to Madrid to take classes in the social sciences. In the capital he came into contact with [[Otero Pedrayo]], [[Primitivo Rodríguez Sanjurjo]] and [[Urbano Feijoo de Sotomayor]], attended meetings in the Ateneo, theatrical and opera performances, and frequented social gatherings of the most famous Madrilenians of the era. In Madrid he worked as a functionary of the government, returning for brief spells to Galicia. Feeling lost in Madrid, he returned to Ourense. Upon his return to the city of his birth, he abandoned the field of pharmacology to work as a tax official. Afterwards he wed Milagros Rodríguez, which whom he had three daughters.

Cuevillas's first writings were political articles and articles of literary criticism that were published in the newspaper ''[[El Miño]]'', a newspaper which Risco also frequently contributed to. Cuevillas also contributed to other publications like  ''[[La Zarpa]]'', ''[[El Pueblo Gallego]]'', ''[[Diario de Orense]]'', ''[[Heraldo de Aragón|El Heraldo]]'', ''{{ill|Misión (magazine)|lt=Misión|gl|Misión (Ourense)}}'', ''[[Faro de Vigo]]'', [[La Noche (Santiago de Compostela)|''La Noche'']] and [[La Región (Santander)|''La Región'']].&lt;ref name="GALEGOS"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.galegos.info/es/florentino-lopez-alonso-cuevillas |title= Florentino López Alonso-Cuevillas | access-date= 10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, members of a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] church called ''Roso de Luna'' (Rodríguez Sanjurjo, Vicente Risco y Cuevillas) decided to found the magazine ''La Centuria''. Cuevillas was a contributor to this new literary project, with a sociopolitical slant manifesting itself more and more in his lectures and works. In the same year, and due to the influence of [[Antón Losada Diéguez]], Cuevillas got involved in Galicianism. In addition he joined las Irmandades da Fala, and was involved in the founding of the magazine Nós as well as the [[Republican Nationalist Party of Ourense]] and he was appointed minister of the Irmandade Nazonalista Galega. In 1922 he published his first work of archeology in Nós, the article ''Dos nosos tempos'' which forms along with the works of Otero Pedrayo and Vicente Risco a generational manifesto of the Ourensian group.

After the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]], like many other Galician nationalists, he was forced to abandon his political activities. In 1939 he continued his archeological studies, but later as a result of worsening of rheumatism in his joints he had to abandon fieldwork and dedicated himself to the systematization of Galician prehistory. On July 7, 1941, Cuevillas was admitted as a full member of the Royal Galician Academy at the proposition of [[Ramón Otero Pedrayo]], [[Ángel del Castillo López]] y [[Alejandro Barreiro Noya]].&lt;ref name="CULTURA.GALEGA"&gt;{{Cite web |author= Xosé Ramón Fandiño Veiga |url= http://www.culturagalega.org/albumdaciencia/detalle.php?id=58 |title= Florentino López Cuevillas | access-date=8 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RAG"&gt;{{Cite web |author= Real Academia Galega |url= http://www.realacademiagalega.org/academy/FindNumeraryAcademic.do?academicIdentifier=510&amp;card=ACA_CARD&amp;day=19&amp;month=9&amp;year=1943&amp;from=COMP&amp;startIndex=1&amp;count=10 |title= Florentino López Cuevillas | access-date=8 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, in 1944, he was admitted to the Instituto de Estudios Padre Sarmiento. That same year he wrote ''Prehistoria'' which would become the third volume of ''Historia de Galiza'', edited by Otero Pedrayo.&lt;ref name="CULTURA.GALEGA" /&gt;

On July 30, 1958 he died in his house on Santo Domingo in Ourense, as a result of a worsening of the rheumatism from which he suffered. He was interred at the Cementerio de San Francisco de Orense. At the moment of his interment, ''Requiem a Cuevillas'', written for him by Fermín Bouza Brey, was sung. The sixth celebration of [[Galician Literature Day]], in 1968, was dedicated to his memory.&lt;ref name="CULTURA.GALEGA" /&gt;

== Archeological and Historical Work ==
[[File:Aquis Querquennis.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The Roman camp of [[Aquis Querquennis]].]]
Cuevillas's archeological work, which grew with the assistance of the people associated with the [[Museo da Comisión de Monumentos]], is reflected in the study ''A mansión de Aquis Querquernis'' (1921) contained a vast amount of work on pre-Roman Galicia.&lt;ref name= "DicCulGal"&gt;{{cite book | author = Iris Cochón | editor = Galaxia| title =  Diccionario da Literatura Galega (I. Autores)| date = November 1995| page = 332 | isbn = 84-8288-019-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it was him and his group of collaborators that began a brief excavation in the early 1920s on the site of the Roman encampment of [[Aquis Querquennis]], discovering the wall of the encampment, although they didn't this short wall as the principle wall of the complex, and other walls of small size related to habitable structures.

Cuevillas was a great scholar of the Castro culture, with his initial work on that topic appearing in the magazine Nós. The first Castro site he studied was located in the parish of San Cibrao de Las (Orense), consisting of a fortress nine hectares in area, and one of the largest sites in Galicia. The excavations, overseen at all times by Cuevillas, began in 1922 and continuing until 1925, when they came to a halt. Although the investigation lasted only three years, (in the 1940s he would resume the excavation), it served as a source of data for his works, published in Nós (which also published his Catálogo dos Castros Galegos) under the title ''A Edade de Ferro no Galiza''.

After being founded in 1923, López Cuevillas joined the [[Seminario de Estudos Galegos]] and began to collaborate closely with [[Fermín Bouza Brey]]. Out of this professional relationship came the study and excavation of the Castro de O Neixón in 1925, the site where Cuevillas discovered the remains of a [[Punic]] [[aryballos]] that was produced in Carthaginian workshops in the Mediterranean, consequently bringing to light the existence of commercial relationships between the ancient settlers of Galicia and merchants on the edges of the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name="Arybalos"&gt;{{Cite web |author= Redacción de Santiago de Compostela|url= http://www.culturagalega.org/noticia.php?id=1630|title= Nace o Centro Arqueolóxico do Barbanza como espacio pioneiro para a divulgación da prehistoria |access-date= 10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work on this site formed a major part of the work ''Os oestrymnios, os saefes e a ofiolatría en Galicia'' (1929). [[File:Casa circular croa San Cibrao de Las.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Circular house in the Castro de San Cibrao de Las.]] In 1927 he undertook the first archaeological journey across all of Galicia, along with Fermín Bouza Brey, through the financial support of the Comisión de Estudios de Galicia. The journey resulted in the study of archaeological sites in Sobroso and Briteiros.

In 1929 Cuevillas worked with the archeologist [[Lluís Pericot]] on the excavation of the Castro de Troña, removing numerous pieces of handicrafts and coins of both Celtic and Roman origin from the complex.  Furthermore, in their initial work in the area they discovered around 30 circular structures, the moat and defensive walls on the eastern side.

On some occasions, Cuevillas limited himself to only the search and exploration of the Castro culture without doing any excavation in the areas in which they had settled. This is what happened in el Outeiro do Castro, a diminutive site in the parish of Canda.

He, along with [[Otero Pedrayo]] and [[Vicente Risco]], argued against the theory that held that there was a possibility that the ruins of the Castro culture and the [[dolmen]]s were contemporaneous structures, thinking the prior were produced by a Celtic culture, and had no relation to the [[stone age]].

=== Historical study of the birth of Ourense in the Roman period ===
In 1934, Cuevillas carried out a historical study regarding the possible origin of Ourense, in which he considered the transportation infrastructure as a determining factor in the birth of the city. During the Roman period an imperial road of notable importance passed through the city, as well as a confluence of various secondary roads and natural passageways like the Miño, Loña and Barbaña-Barbadás rivers.&lt;ref name="PDF"&gt;{{Cite web |author= José Somoza Medina (Doctor en Geografía e Historia por la USC)|url= http://descargas.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/01937074651258255210035/006840_2.pdf|title= Desarollo urbano en Ourense 1895 - 2000) |access-date= 10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main defining idea of Cuevillas's theory was the belief that the original population nucleus in the region developed nearby As Burgas and not along the path of the Miño river, to argue for an indigenous foundation tied to the thermal springs and not to the Romans. The existence of these hot springs made Cuevillas think of them as a possible site of pilgrimage for the nearby members of the Castro culture before the Roman conquest, which lead to the appearance of small markets and other structures of a commercial nature. Therefore, upon Roman arrival they would have discovered a limited existing community, to which they would have added a certain degree of development.&lt;ref name="PDF" /&gt;

== Works ==

=== ''Prosas Galegas, 1920 - 1958'' ===
''Prosas Galegas, 1920 – 1958'', a posthumous collection of 32 essays, was published in 1962, and is not strictly about science, but also literature. Although some of these essays had already come to light earlier, for example ''Como nasceu a cidade de Ourense'', and ''O Trasno na vila'', these essays reveal an unpublished Cuevillas, a creator who coexisted with the investigator.

Beginning even in the prologue of the collection, written by [[Marino Dónega]], critics increasingly came to appreciate his magnificent and serene prose, even though in his time it hadn't gained much attention.

The book is divided into four untitled sections. The first two sections contain the prose that most praises the nature and values of Galicia, introducing the countryside, the cities and traditions, while others serve as critical commentary on current society (such as ''Dos nosos tempos'', in which the intellectual evolution of society is reflected in the same way as it occurred to the other members of his generation).

The third group, characterized by its short length, contains three biographical sketches of Galician writers (specifically [[Curros Enríquez]], [[Valentín Lamas Carvajal]] and [[Otero Pedrayo]])and a commentary on the work of [[Castelao]] ''As cruces de pedra na Galiza''. All of the essays were written in the period after the Spanish Civil War.

Finally, the fourth group of essays deals more with his work in the study and exploration of Galician pre-history, featuring works with significant names such as ''Relaciós prehistóricas entre Galicia e as Illas Británicas''. In this last block, the prose usually has an informative value typical of essays (some of the pieces can be considered studies, like ''Paleopaisaxe'' and ''Mitoloxía e historia da paisaxe de Trasalba'').

==== Characterization of ''Prosas galegas'' ====
In the words of [[Ricardo Carballo Calero]], ''Prosas galegas'' is characterized by its conviction and rhetorical harmony, evident sincerity and idealism.

=== ''Miscelánea'' ===
Various investigative works Cuevilla produced over the course of his life that were published in ''[[Nós]]'', ''Boletín de la Real Academia Gallega'', the ''Arquivos do Seminario de Estudos Galegos'', the ''Boletín da Comisión Provincial de Monumentos de Ourense'', the ''Cuadernos de Estudios Gallegos'' as well as other publications, were partially compiled in the volume ''Miscelánea'' (1987).

'''Francis Ng Chun-yu''' (born 21 December 1961) is a Hong Kong actor and director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ycwb.com/ePaper/ycwb/html/2009-08/03/content_558494.htm |title=吴镇宇：当导演，我是新人_羊城晚报数字报刊 |website=Ycwb.com |date=3 August 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his roles in the [[TVB]] series ''[[Triumph in the Skies]]'' and in films such as ''[[Young and Dangerous]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time in Triad Society]]'' and ''[[The Mission (1999 film)|The Mission]]''.

==Early life==
Ng was born in Hong Kong to a family with ancestry from [[Panyu District|Panyu]], [[Guangzhou]], Guangdong, China. He is the uncle of a member of the [[Hong Kong national football team]], [[Ng Wai Chiu]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160820051828/http://sports.sohu.com/20090316/n262807282.shtml ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ng revealed in a stand-up comedy, saying that when he was a child he told his mother that his dream was to get a job that does not need any academic qualification, without a fixed working hours and high pay. Then, his mother asked him to become a beggar. So, he went to [[Wong Tai Sin, Hong Kong|Wong Tai Sin]], a famous temple in Hong Kong, to observe those beggars there. He realised that becoming beggar is too busy and need to perform manual labour, which does not suit his free and unconstrained attitude. Consequently, he gave up and decided to become a movie star because being a movie star fulfilled all the condition he requested.&lt;ref name="iqiyi.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iqiyi.com/zongyi/20101120/n127098.html |title=非常静距离 20101120 -视频在线观看-综艺-爱奇艺 |website=Iqiyi.com |date=19 November 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During that time, the only way to become a movie star was to get into TVB Training Classes, so Ng signed up. After failing thrice entering the training classes, he eventually gave up. He went for a short period [[Pabbajja]] for seven days,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130812053737/http://tv.jschina.com.cn/html/ItemId76/2012-04-01/82451.html]&lt;/ref&gt; shaved his head bald. After the event, he decided to try applying for the training classes again and this time he succeeded. He said in an interview that he succeeded because the interviewer thought that he Knew [[Shaolin Kung Fu]] due to his bald head.&lt;ref name="iqiyi.com"/&gt;

==Television career==
He graduated from [[Television Broadcasts Limited|TVB]]'s training classes in 1982 along with [[Stephen Chow]] and [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ent.daqi.com/article/3307173_5.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610032035/http://ent.daqi.com/article/3307173_5.html |date=10 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He acted in minor roles for the first few years in his television career. Until 1985, he started to involve in a great deal of TV Series, he was very outstanding in playing villainous roles in TV series such as ''[[The Price of Growing Up]]'' and ''[[The Final Combat]]''. Later on, he played as a protagonist in situation comedies such as ''[[Everybody Loves Somebody (TV series)|Everybody Loves Somebody]]'' and ''[[The Family Squad]]'', which make him gradually disengage from being the stereotypical villain.

His contract with TVB ended in 1993 and he broke into the movie industry. In 1997, he returned to TVB to star a nostalgic comedy series ''[[Old Time Buddy]]'' with [[Gallen Lo]], [[Maggie Cheung Ho-yee|Maggie Cheung]] and [[Jessica Hsuen]], which was one of the highest rating TV series that year. Later in 2003, he was invited back to TVB again to film ''[[Triumph in the Skies]]'' casting an airline pilot. He was the leading man role of the series, that series was cited as one of the best serial drama in TVB. He also involved in the sequel of the series ''[[Triumph in the Skies II]]'' which was aired on 15 July 2013.

==Film career==

After becoming a freeman in 1993, he had the chance to be involved in bigger production film such as  ''[[Flirting Scholar]]'' with [[Stephen Chow]] and ''[[Kung Fu Cult Master]]'' with [[Jet Li]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Ng's turning point in his filming career came in ''[[Young and Dangerous]]'' (1995), as villain Ugly Kwan, which was so popular that it spun an unofficial spin-off in ''[[Once Upon a Time in Triad Society]]'' (1996).  His output has steadily increased since then. During 1999, he has won the ''[[Golden Horse Awards]]'' Best Actor for ''[[The Mission (1999 film)|The Mission]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://past.people.com.cn/BIG5/channel6/33/20001215/350825.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403022253/http://past.people.com.cn/BIG5/channel6/33/20001215/350825.html |date=3 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hong Kong Film Critics Society]] Best Actor for ''[[Bullets Over Summer]]''.

[[File:Frederick Mahomed.jpg|thumb|The only known photograph of Dr Mahomed]]
'''Frederick Henry Horatio Akbar Mahomed''' (11 April 1849 – 22 November 1884) was an internationally known [[United Kingdom|British]] [[physician]] from [[Brighton]], [[England]] in the late 19th century.

== Family and Personal life ==
Frederick Henry Horatio Akbar Mahomed was born on 11 April 1849 in [[Brighton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=QhMooy34OHypWNdtj6fbAQ&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=6 September 2018|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the eldest son of Frederick Mahomed (1818–1888) and his second wife, Sarah Hodgkinson (1816–1905). He was also the grandson of  the [[Bengali people|Bengali]] traveller [[Sake Dean Mahomed]].&lt;ref name=Cameron&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cameron JS, Hicks J |title=Frederick Akbar Mahomed and his role in the description of hypertension at Guy's Hospital |journal=Kidney Int. |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=1488–506 |date=May 1996 |pmid=8731118 |doi= 10.1038/ki.1996.209|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick Akbar Mahomed's father, Frederick Mahomed, ran a [[fencing]], [[gymnastics]] and [[callisthenics]] academy in [[Hove]], which included [[boxing]] instruction.&lt;ref name="Cameron" /&gt; Cameron and Hicks&lt;ref name="Cameron" /&gt; dispute the suggestion that he ran [[Turkish bath]]s at Brighton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lives of the Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians of London, 1826-1925 |volume=4 |oclc=752408006 |contribution=Frederick Henry Horatio Akbar Mahomed |page=276 }}&lt;/ref&gt; attributing this to a confusion of Mahomed's father Frederick with his uncle, Arthur. Mahomed had three brothers (Arthur George Suleiman, James Deen Kerriman and Henry), and one sister (Adeline). He was educated privately in Brighton prior to attending medical school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shaw AB |title=Frederick Akhbar Mahomed and his contribution to the study of Bright's disease |journal=Guys Hosp Rep |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=153–73 |year=1952 |pmid=12989629 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 14, 1873 at the parish church of St Nicholas', Brighton, Mahomed married Ellen (Nellie) Chalk. The couple had two children, a son, Archibald in 1874 &lt;ref&gt; {{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=Rp9KeNvv8L1kLMmtY7z35Q&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=6 September 2018|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a daughter, Ellen in 1876&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=k8YexAx4tnHPKs59%2FR8sOg&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=6 September 2018|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Only a month after the birth of Ellen in 1876, his wife, Ellen, died suddenly of septicemia &lt;ref&gt; {{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=rQBKe%2FUcwfVd3uL3nXqK7w&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=6 September 2018|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mahomed and his family moved in with his uncle, Horatio, also a widower, in Seymour Street near [[Portman Square]], London.&lt;ref name="Cameron" /&gt; In 1879 Mahomed married Ada Chalk, the younger sister of his first wife. As such a marriage was not legal under English law, the couple married in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000098/18790419/008/0005&lt;/ref&gt; They lived at 12 [[Park End Street|St Thomas' Street]], close to [[Guy's Hospital]]. The couple had two daughters, Dorothy in 1880,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=a6amTf%2BtmpCE123oqYX3OA&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=6 September 2018|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Janet in 1881,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=g%2BycTH1mP84LDskWOQXh%2BA&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=6 September 2018|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a son, Humphry in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=ks0idyQO0frFHAMh6ESSBg&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=6 September 2018|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884 the family moved from St Thomas' Street into a six-story Georgian house at 24 [[Manchester Square]]. Sadly, later that year, Mahomed contracted [[typhoid fever]], presumably from a patient at the [[London Fever Hospital]], where he was working.

In 1867, aged 18, Mahomed began to study medicine at the [[Sussex County Hospital]], Brighton. Two years later in October 1869, he entered Guy's Hospital, London as a medical student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Wilks, G.T. Bettany |title=A biographical history of Guy's Hospital |location=London |publisher=Ward, Lock, Bowden |url=https://archive.org/details/biographicalhist00wilkuoft |ol=22852056M  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an outstanding student and, in 1871, won the student Pupils' Physical Society prize for his work on the [[sphygmograph]], having been runner-up the previous year.&lt;ref name="Cameron" /&gt; Mahomed qualified as a Member of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] in 1872. Following qualification, Mahomed worked at Highgate Infirmary (St Pancras' North Infirmary, Central London Sick Asylum) for a year. In 1873, he was appointed as resident medical officer at the [[London Fever Hospital]] in Liverpool Street, [[Islington]]. In 1874 Mahomed became a member of the [[Royal College of Physicians]] and was appointed as Student Tutor and Pathologist at [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]], [[Paddington]]. In 1875, Mahomed gained a doctorate (M.D.) from the [[University of Brussels]]. In 1877, he returned to Guy's Hospital as a Registrar (Senior Resident). He was elected as a Fellow of the [[Royal College of Physicians]] in 1880, and in 1881, he was awarded an [[Bachelor of Medicine|M.B.]] from [[Cambridge University]] for his thesis on "Chronic [[Bright's disease]] without albuminuria". In the same year, he was appointed Assistant Physician at Guy's Hospital and, in 1882, he was appointed as a Demonstrator in Morbid Anatomy at Guy's Hospital.[[File:Hand-book of physiology (1892) (14762065691).jpg|thumb|''Diagram of the formation of the pulse (Mahomed)'']]Mahomed‘s earliest contribution, while still a [[Medical school|medical student]], was to improve the [[sphygmograph]], a device for measuring [[blood pressure]] that had originally been devised by [[Karl von Vierordt]] and further developed by [[Étienne-Jules Marey]]. Mahomed’s major innovation was to make the sphygmograph quantitative, so that it was able to measure arterial blood pressure (in [[Troy weight|Troy ounces]]). The description of the modified instrument was published in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mahomed|first=Frederick|date=1873|title=The physiology and clinical use of the sphygmograph|url=|journal=Medical Times and Gazette|volume=2 (9 August)|pages=141–143|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his graduation in the same year, Mahomed took up an appointment at the Central London Sick Asylum, where he worked with [[William Broadbent|Sir William Broadbent]], who became a strong supporter and friend.&lt;ref name="Cameron" /&gt; Several of Mahomed’s pulse tracings are contained in Broadbent’s classic book, The Pulse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/982879476|title=PULSE (CLASSIC REPRINT).|last=H.|first=BROADBENT, W|date=2016|publisher=FORGOTTEN BOOKS|isbn=9781331197980|location=[S.l.]|oclc=982879476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahomed used the new sphygmograph to measure arterial tension (blood pressure) in [[Bright's disease]] and a range of other conditions, including [[pregnancy]], [[scarlet fever]], [[gout]], [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] and [[lead poisoning]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MAHOMED|first=F|title=ON CHRONIC BRIGHT'S DISEASE, AND ITS ESSENTIAL SYMPTOMS.|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673602459363|journal=The Lancet|volume=113|issue=2899|pages=399–401|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(02)45936-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that in some individuals blood pressure was elevated before there was evidence of [[kidney disease]], assessed by measurement of protein in the urine ([[proteinuria]]).  He also made the association between the elevated blood pressure and various [[Autopsy|post-mortem]] changes, including  enlargement of the [[heart]] ([[Ventricular hypertrophy|cardiac hypertrophy]]), thickening and [[fibrosis]] of the [[Artery|arterial wall]], [[aneurysm]] formation, and damage to the [[microcirculation]] (arterio-capillary fibrosis). In effect, Mahomed was describing most of the key pathological effects of [[essential hypertension]] for the first time. Initially he termed this condition "Bright's disease without albuminuria" but later he described it as “high pressure diathesis”. His description of the condition is worth citing:&lt;blockquote&gt;‘…the existence of this abnormally high pressure does not necessarily mean disease, but only a tendency towards disease. It is a functional condition, not necessarily a permanent one, though it is generally more or less so in these individuals. These persons appear to pass on through life pretty much as others do… As age advances the enemy gains accessions of strength; perhaps the mode of life assists him - good living and alcoholic beverages make secure his position, or head work, mental anxiety, hurried meals, constant excitement, inappropriate or badly cooked food, or any other of the common but undesirable circumstances of everyday life, tend to intensify the existing condition, or, if not previously present, perhaps produce it. Now under this greatly increased arterial pressure, hearts begin to hypertrophy and arteries to thicken; what has previously been a functional condition tends to become more of the nature of an organic one…’&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Mahomed also proposed that reducing blood pressure would prolong life,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; although the means of doing that  in his era were in the main limited to lifestyle advice.

In 1880 Mahomed made a first foray into [[public health]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Alun D.|date=2013-06-01|title=Commentary: ‘On the cards’: Collective investigation of disease and medical life histories in the nineteenth century|url=https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/42/3/683/912097|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=683–688|doi=10.1093/ije/dyt062|issn=0300-5771}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote to the [[The BMJ|British Medical Journal]] to advocate undertaking the comprehensive systematic documentation of disease in Britain; he termed this idea, Collective Investigation. Mahomed’s proposals were warmly supported by [[George Murray Humphry|Sir George Murray Humphry]], the President of the [[British Medical Association]], and a Collective Investigation Committee was formed in 1881 with Mahomed as secretary.  Around this time Mahomed became acquainted with the British polymath, [[Francis Galton]], who shared an interest in factors predisposing to disease. Mahomed and Galton collaborated to produce [[Compositing|composite photographs]]  of over 400 patients with phthisis ([[Tuberculosis]]), which they compared with composite photographs based on 200 individuals without evidence of phthisis to test whether, as was widely believed, appearance or looks indicated a predisposition to disease. They found no evidence of a characteristic facial appearance associated with tuberculosis beyond some evidence of emaciation.

In 1882 Mahomed advocated expanding Collective Investigation to include a general collection of detailed family life histories:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;'for encouraging patients to keep carefully prepared records of their lives and of the chief incidents therein, both medical and otherwise. These records  would prove of very great value, alike to the patient, to the doctor, and to medical science.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;A life-history subcommittee of the Collective Investigation Committee, including both Mahomed and Galton was formed in 1882.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Initially the Collective Investigation Committee was very successful with 54 local Collective Investigation Committees being formed to collect data. Their preliminary findings were published in 1883 as a 76-page single volume called 'The Collective Investigation Record' and included results based on more than 2000 patients. In 1884, a Life History Album was published to allow parents to record details of family circumstances and child development. It was advertized in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] and Galton offered prizes of £500 to people who submitted the most complete family records -  within 5 months he had received in excess of 150 records.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Over the subsequent 5 years data based on over 300 family records were published, with the main  findings summarised in Galton’s book, Natural Inheritance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, Mahomed  would not see these achievements as he died in November 1884 from typhoid fever.

==Contribution==
Michael F. O'Rourke summarizes the contributions of Frederick Akbar Mahomed as follows:&lt;ref name=Rourke&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Rourke|first=Michael F.|title=Frederick Akbar Mahomed|journal=Hypertension|year=1992|volume=19|publisher=[[American Heart Association]]|pages=212–217|pmid=1737655|issue=2|doi=10.1161/01.hyp.19.2.212|pmc=2308176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|In detailed clinical studies, he separated chronic [[nephritis]] with [[secondary hypertension]] from what we now term [[Hypertension|essential hypertension]]. He described the constitutional basis and natural history of essential hypertension and pointed out that this disease could terminate with [[Hypertensive nephropathy|nephrosclerosis]] and [[renal failure]]. His clinical studies were done without the benefit of a [[sphygmomanometer]] but with the aid of a quantitative sphygmogram that he had initially developed while a medical student. He described characteristic features of the [[Pulse pressure|pressure pulse]] in patients with high blood pressure and in persons with [[arteriosclerosis]] consequent on aging. These [[P-wave|pressure wave]] changes have recently been verified and explained. He contributed to a number of other advances in medical care, including [[blood transfusion]] and [[Appendicectomy|appendectomy]] for [[appendicitis]]. He initiated the Collective Investigation Record for the [[British Medical Association]]; this organization collected data from physicians practicing outside the hospital setting and was the precursor of modern collaborative [[clinical trial]]s.}}

== Early life ==

Yeh attended [[Montgomery County Public Schools (Maryland)|Montgomery County Public Schools]], including [[Thomas Sprigg Wootton High School|Thomas S. Wootton High School]], and graduated from [[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[Duke University]].&lt;ref name=paul /&gt;&lt;ref name=german /&gt;&lt;ref name=bf /&gt; In 2007, Yeh discovered that [[endangered sea turtles]] on [[Hainan|Hainan island, China]], were being sold illegally for their meat and shell.&lt;ref name=fyeh1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=fyeh3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=paul /&gt;&lt;ref name=german /&gt;&lt;ref name=bf /&gt; During an interview with [[CNN]], Yeh described, "I felt really hopeless at that time ... You would see land turtles and freshwater turtles (in the market) and some of those are legal, but when you see a sea turtle it's clearly not supposed to be there and that's shocking to see."&lt;ref name=cnn /&gt; This finding was emotionally disturbing to Yeh and became a turning point in his life, which led to the founding of the first non-profit organization working for the advancement of sea turtle protection and conservation in China.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

Despite the desperate state of sea turtles in China, Yeh was inspired in 2008 when he saw wild sea turtles undisturbed by people as the animals were naturally basking on public beaches in Hawaii.&lt;ref name=basking1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/time-year-turtle-beach-oahu-106738.html|title=The Best Time of the Year for Turtle Beach, Oahu|author=|date=|website=usatoday.com|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=basking2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpir.noaa.gov/PRD/prd_volunteer_opps.html|title=Home page of NOAA Fisheries Service - Pacific Islands Regional Office|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Marine Fisheries|last=Service|date=|website=www.fpir.noaa.gov|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Yeh said on a CNN interview, "When you see the sea turtles in Hawaii, how great they are, it's worth it when you can envision that and hope that one day it will happen in Hainan, one day, in China."&lt;ref name=cnn /&gt;  This experience led Yeh to believe that sea turtles and people could live in harmony and that there was still hope in China because of the successful sea turtle conservation efforts in Hawaii.  According to the global authority on nature conservation, [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), the sea turtles of the Hawaiian Islands were also once under the threat of near [[extinction]], but are now thriving&lt;ref name=sbalazs&gt;http://www.whatsonsanya.com/news-20205-iucn-sea-turtles-911-release-tagged-sea-turtle-in-sanya.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mbalazs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2012/0306-pod-seaturtle911.html#|title=Animal photos of the day: green sea turtle saved in China|author=|date=6 March 2012|website=mongabay.com|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their conservation status reclassified as "Least Concern" according to the [[IUCN Red List]].&lt;ref name=iucnred&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/16285718/0|title=Chelonia mydas (Hawaiian subpopulation) (Green Turtle, Hawaiian Green Turtle, Tortuga Blanca)|author=|date=|website=www.iucnredlist.org|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, Yeh established Sea Turtles 911 under Hawaiian jurisdiction, and changed the course of his life by moving to China to save the sea turtles he had hopelessly witnessed being sold, earning him the nickname "The unlikely sea turtle savior" by the [[BBC]].&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn /&gt; Building a floating sea turtle hospital in a Chinese fishing village known for its extensive sea turtle [[poaching]], Yeh makes a point to work with people of all types to support sea turtle conservation in the area, including government officials, academia, fishermen and poachers, community members, local and international volunteers.&lt;ref name=cnn /&gt;&lt;ref name=hospital1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/environment/2013-09/04/content_29924143.htm|title=Floating hospital saves sea turtles - China.org.cn|first=|last=弓迎春|date=|website=www.china.org.cn|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hospital2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2013/09/03/Floating-hospital-in-China-dedicated-to-caring-for-sea-turtles/UPI-18231378254043/|title=Floating hospital in China dedicated to caring for sea turtles|author=|date=|website=upi.com|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hospital3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/xinhua/2013-09-03/content_10025472.html|title=Around China: Floating hospital saves sea turtles-chinadaily.com.cn|author=|date=|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inouye&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii247.com/2012/09/04/chinese-police-rescue-inouye-the-turtle/|title=Chinese police rescue Inouye the turtle|author=|date=4 September 2012|website=hawaii247.com|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a sea turtle release event held at the [[Ritz-Carlton]], [[Sanya]], Yeh stated, "For our release events, if we can bring multiple sectors in our community together, it will be very beneficial to sea turtle conservation in China.

Yeh promotes environmental conservation through publicized sea turtle release events in China, and is vocal about ending sea turtle [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]] in Chinese media.&lt;ref name=cm1&gt;http://hi.people.com.cn/n/2012/0327/c231190-16881075.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cm2&gt;http://ep.chinaluxus.com/Act/20120828/215894.html#picview&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cm3&gt;http://roll.sohu.com/20120328/n339138562.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cm4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.hainan.net/newshtml08/2012w3r27/855570f0.htm|title=海南新闻-海南新闻中心-海南在线 海南一家|author=|date=|website=news.hainan.net|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cm5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.hexun.com/2012-03-27/139763126.html|title=两百多斤海龟陵水搁浅 国际海龟保护组织放生-新闻频道-和讯网|author=|date=|website=news.hexun.com|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cm6&gt;{{cite web|url=http://v.hinews.cn/page-51659.html|title=3000斤鲸鲨误撞渔网 水生野生动物保护分会组织放生- 海网宽频|author=|date=|website=v.hinews.cn|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cm7&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hi.chinanews.com/hnnew/2012-07-05/244719.html|title=3000斤鲸鲨误撞渔网 海南动物保护会组织放生|author=|date=|website=www.hi.chinanews.com|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cm8&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngdsb.hinews.cn/html/2012-07/05/content_495225.htm|title=南国都市报·数字报刊|author=|date=|website=ngdsb.hinews.cn|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=releasemedia1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hnrb.hinews.cn/html/2013-08/11/content_2_5.htm|title=海南日报数字报-"大海才是你们的家"|author=|date=|website=hnrb.hinews.cn|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=releasemedia2&gt;http://bbs.tianya.cn/post-838-34922-1.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; As he has said, "Their survival is our responsibility; we must create hope."&lt;ref name=createhope&gt;http://ep.chinaluxus.com/Glv/20120828/215879.html&lt;/ref&gt; During interviews with journalists, he is known to use metaphors to facilitate the understanding of environmental conservation to the public.  Yeh cautioned the Chinese public not to delay the increased protection efforts of sea turtles until they decline to the same population level as China's cherished [[Giant panda]].&lt;ref name=interview1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hnrb.hinews.cn/html/2013-08/14/content_4_1.htm|title=海南日报数字报-海龟濒危连问4个为什么|author=|date=|website=hnrb.hinews.cn|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addressing [[marine pollution]] problems in China, he reminds the public not to treat the ocean as an enormous toilet and garbage dump.&lt;ref name=interview1 /&gt;

In China, poached sea turtles include endangered [[Green sea turtles]] raised primarily for consumption of their meat, and the [[critically endangered]] [[Hawksbill sea turtle]] raised for the trade in shell products such as jewelry, combs, eyeglass frames, and preserved trophies.&lt;ref name=paul /&gt;&lt;ref name=world&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.org/2012/02/china-turtle-poaching/|title=Sea Turtle Poaching and High Demand in China|author=|date=|website=theworld.org|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pri&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/science/environment/high-demand-for-sea-turtles-in-china-sends-poachers-toward-philippines-8358.html|title=High demand for sea turtles in China sends poachers toward Philippines|author=|date=|website=pri.org|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a speech condemning the use of sea turtle products, Yeh echoed [[Yao Ming]]'s famous quotation, "When the buying stops, the killing can too."&lt;ref name=sbalazs /&gt;&lt;ref name=mbalazs /&gt;

Declaring July 4, 2012, as a day of freedom for all marine animals, Yeh led the release of an endangered [[Whale shark]] that had been caught accidentally by a Chinese fishing boat as [[bycatch]], as well as two Green sea turtles.&lt;ref name=freedom&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii247.com/2012/07/05/freedom-release-whale-shark-and-sea-turtles-in-china/|title=Freedom release: Whale shark and sea turtles in China|author=|date=5 July 2012|website=hawaii247.com|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shark&gt;http://www.whatsonsanya.com/news-22425-sea-turtles-911-releases-whale-shark-and-sea-turtles-in-hainan.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hotel&gt;http://hotelhainan.com/sea-turtles-whale-shark-released-in-hainan/&lt;/ref&gt; At this event, he proclaimed, "Sea turtle conservation does not only involve sea turtles.

On March 23, 2013, Yeh spoke out on [[climate change]] and [[global warming]] during [[Earth Hour]], the one hour when the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) encourages businesses and households worldwide to switch off their lights to raise awareness on climate change.  Sea turtle eggs are influenced by a biological process known as [[Temperature-dependent sex determination]], meaning that their gender is determined by the environmental temperature.&lt;ref name=tsd&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7079758 | volume=216 | issue=4551 | title=Temperature-dependent sex determination: current practices threaten conservation of sea turtles | year=1982 | journal=Science | pages=1245–7 | last1 = Morreale | first1 = SJ | last2 = Ruiz | first2 = GJ | last3 = Spotila | first3 = JR | last4 = Standora | first4 = EA | doi=10.1126/science.7079758}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yeh reminded the public, “As the global climate’s average temperature increases, more females will be hatched, jeopardizing sea turtle populations with an unbalanced sex ratio.”&lt;ref name=earthhourmonga&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.mongabay.com/2013/04/05/sea-turtles-released-during-earth-hour/|title=Sea Turtles Released During Earth Hour|author=|date=|website=blog.mongabay.com|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=earthhourroar&gt;http://roarhawaii.org/sea-turtles-released-during-earth-hour/&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with China's official state-run news agency, [[Xinhua News Agency]], Yeh called for a celebrity to help save endangered sea turtles by raising public awareness.&lt;ref name="fyeh3" /&gt;  In 2014, Yeh was answered by former [[NBA]] basketball superstar [[Yao Ming]], who consistently ranked #1 on the [[Forbes China Celebrity 100]].&lt;ref name="yaoming6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/03/18/chinese-celebrities-beijing-olympics-yao-ming-business-media-chinas-top-celebrities.html|title=Forbes China Celebrity List|first=Russell|last=Flannery|date=|website=forbes.com|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yaoming7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-03/19/content_7594549.htm|title=Yao tops Forbes China Celebrity list for the 6th time|author=|date=|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yaoming8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/NM-e/86932.htm|title=Yao Ming Tops Forbes' China Celebrity List|author=|date=|website=www.china.org.cn|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yao Ming joined Yeh in his public sea turtle release events and the duo set free rescued turtles back into the wild, raising awareness together that leads people to "an epiphany that turtles belong in the wild, and not in the market.”&lt;ref name="yaoming1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1534600/former-basketball-star-yao-ming-calls-protection-sea-turtles|title=Former basketball star Yao Ming calls for protection of sea turtles|author=|date=|website=scmp.com|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yaoming2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.looktothestars.org/news/12172-nba-star-yao-ming-saves-endangered-sea-turtles|title=NBA Star Yao Ming Saves Endangered Sea Turtles|author=|date=17 June 2014|website=looktothestars.org|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn /&gt;&lt;ref name="yaoming3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sci-news.com/biology/science-yao-ming-green-turtles-02025.html|title=Basketball Star Saves Endangered Green Turtles - Biology - Sci-News.com|author=|date=|website=sci-news.com|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yaoming4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecorazzi.com/2014/06/18/former-nba-star-yao-ming-saves-sea-turtles/|title=Former NBA Star Yao Ming Saves Sea Turtles : Ecorazzi|author=|date=|website=www.ecorazzi.com|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yaoming5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ortablu.org/news/world-news/former-nba-star-yao-ming-saves-sea-turtles|title=Former NBA Star Yao Ming Saves Sea Turtles «  Orta Blu|author=|date=|website=Orta Blu|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 8, 2015, Yeh led a large-scale event in which five (5) rescued sea turtles were released from different beaches around the island of Hainan to maximize conservation awareness for [[World Oceans Day]] as recognized by the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World Oceans Day - 8 June|url = https://www.un.org/en/events/oceansday/|website = www.un.org|accessdate = 2015-10-16|language = EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yeh said, "The emotional experience of watching a sea turtle swim for freedom back to nature reminds us that we are all connected to the vast ocean expanse, and thus have the responsibility to protect them for our future generations.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sea Turtle 911 - World Ocean Day 2015 - World Ocean Network|url = http://www.worldoceannetwork.org/portfolio-posts/sea-turtle-911-world-ocean-day-2015/|website = World Ocean Network|accessdate = 2015-10-16|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 15, 2016, [[United States Ambassador to China]] and [[List of United States Senators from Montana|former U.S. Senator]] [[Max Baucus]] joined Yeh in the release of two rescued turtles named [[Harvard]] and [[Yale]] into the South China Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/4282-shell-game|title=Shell game|author=|date=|website=yalealumnimagazine.com|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2016-02/03/content_23373150.htm|title=US ambassador sends New Year greetings in video-Americas-chinadaily.com.cn|author=|date=|website=usa.chinadaily.com.cn|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Yeh, the U.S. Ambassador’s charitable act was recognized as symbolic because "Sea turtles are charismatic, migratory animals that serve as natural ambassadors of the ocean; as communities and countries work together to preserve this flagship species for future generations, our shared mission to save sea turtles nurtures a peaceful platform of common grounds to improve community and international relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ecopartnerships.lbl.gov/news/sea-turtles-911-and|title=Sea Turtles 911 and U.S. Ambassador Release Endangered Sea Turtles in the South China Sea - EcoPartnerships|author=|date=|website=ecopartnerships.lbl.gov|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Harrison'''{{refn|group=nb|Some published sources give Harold as Harrison's middle name;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Everett|2001|p=36}}; {{harvnb|Giuliano|Giuliano|1998|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; others dispute that, based on the absence of any middle name on his birth certificate.}} {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MBE}} (25 February 1943&amp;nbsp;– 29 November 2001) was an English musician, singer-songwriter, music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of [[the Beatles]]. Often referred to as "the quiet Beatle", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of [[popular music]] through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and [[Hinduism|Hindu]]-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work.{{sfn|Gilmore|2002|pp=34, 36}} Although the majority of the band's songs were written by [[Lennon–McCartney|John Lennon and Paul McCartney]], most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included "[[Taxman]]", "[[Within You Without You]]", "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]", "[[Here Comes the Sun]]" and "[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]".

Harrison's earliest musical influences included [[George Formby]] and [[Django Reinhardt]]; [[Carl Perkins]], [[Chet Atkins]] and [[Chuck Berry]] were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into [[folk rock]] through his interest in [[Bob Dylan]] and [[the Byrds]], and towards [[Indian classical music]] through his use of the [[sitar]] on "[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]". Having initiated the band's embracing of [[Transcendental Meditation]] in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna movement]]. After [[Break-up of the Beatles|the band's break-up]] in 1970, Harrison released the triple album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, "[[My Sweet Lord]]", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the [[slide guitar]]. He also organised the 1971 [[The Concert for Bangladesh|Concert for Bangladesh]] with Indian musician [[Ravi Shankar]], a precursor for later [[benefit concert]]s such as [[Live Aid]]. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' [[Apple Records|Apple]] record label before founding [[Dark Horse Records]] in 1974 and co-founding [[HandMade Films]] in 1978.

Harrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the [[RIAA certification|platinum-selling]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by [[Badfinger]], [[Ronnie Wood]] and [[Billy Preston]], and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, [[Eric Clapton]], [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Tom Petty]], among others. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time". He is a two-time [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] inductee – as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radio.com/2014/12/16/green-day-joan-jett-ringo-starr-lead-rock-hall-2015-inductees|title=2015 Rock Hall inductees|publisher=Radio.com|accessdate=16 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217154623/http://radio.com/2014/12/16/green-day-joan-jett-ringo-starr-lead-rock-hall-2015-inductees/|archivedate=17 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison's first marriage, to model [[Pattie Boyd]] in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977. The following year he married [[Olivia Harrison|Olivia Arias]], with whom he had a son, [[Dhani Harrison|Dhani]]. Harrison died from lung cancer in 2001 at the age of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his [[Friar Park]] home. His remains were cremated and the ashes were scattered according to [[Ganges in Hinduism|Hindu tradition]] in a private ceremony in the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] rivers in India.

[[File:12ArnoldGrove.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Harrison's first home, a red brick building|Harrison's place of birth and first home – [[12 Arnold Grove]]]]
Harrison was born at [[12 Arnold Grove]] in [[Wavertree]], Liverpool, on 25 February 1943.{{sfn|Harrison|2002|p=20}} He was the youngest of four children of Harold Hargreaves (or Hargrove) Harrison (1909–1978) and Louise (née French;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatlesireland.info/Irish%20Heritage/georgeheritage.html |title=Beatles Ireland – George Harrison Irish Heritage |publisher=Beatlesireland.info |date= |accessdate=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1911–1970). Harold was a bus conductor who had worked as a ship's steward on the [[White Star Line]],{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=55}} and Louise was a shop assistant of [[Irish Catholic]] descent.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=6}} He had one sister, Louise (born 16 August 1931), and two brothers, Harold (born 1934) and Peter (20 July 1940 – 1 June 2007).{{sfn|Harry|2000|p=492}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2000|p=492}}; {{harvnb|Leng|2006|p=24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Boyd, Harrison's mother was particularly supportive: "All she wanted for her children is that they should be happy, and she recognized that nothing made George quite as happy as making music."{{sfn|Boyd|2007|p=82}} Louise was an enthusiastic music fan, and she was known among friends for her loud singing voice, which at times startled visitors by rattling the Harrisons' windows.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=120}} When Louise was pregnant with George, she often listened to the weekly broadcast ''Radio India''. Harrison's biographer Joshua Greene wrote, "Every Sunday she tuned in to mystical sounds evoked by sitars and [[tabla]]s, hoping that the exotic music would bring peace and calm to the baby in the womb."{{sfn|Greene|2006|p=2}}

Harrison lived the first four years of his life at 12 Arnold Grove, a terraced house on a [[cul-de-sac]].{{sfn|Harrison|2002|pp=20–21}} The home had an outdoor toilet and its only heat came from a single coal fire. In 1949, the family was offered a [[council house]] and moved to 25 Upton Green, [[Speke]].{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=7}} In 1948, at the age of five, Harrison enrolled at [[Dovedale Primary School]].{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=xiii}} He passed the [[eleven-plus exam]] and attended [[Liverpool Institute High School for Boys]] from 1954 to 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Everett|2001|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greene|2006|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the institute did offer a music course, Harrison was disappointed with the absence of guitars, and felt the school "moulded [students] into being frightened".{{sfn|Harrison|2002| pp= 22–23}}

Harrison's earliest musical influences included [[George Formby]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Django Reinhardt]] and [[Hoagy Carmichael]];{{sfn|Leng|2006|pp=302, 303–04}} by the 1950s, [[Carl Perkins]] and [[Lonnie Donegan]] were significant influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rockhall.com/inductees/george-harrison/bio/|title=Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame: George Harrison Biography|publisher=rockhall.com|accessdate=29 October 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912010920/https://rockhall.com/inductees/george-harrison/bio/|archivedate=12 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1956 he had an epiphany: while riding his bicycle, he heard [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]" playing from a nearby house, and the song piqued his interest in [[rock and roll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/nov/30/guardianobituaries1 |title=George Harrison, 1943–2001: Former Beatle George Harrison dies from cancer aged 58 |last=Laing |first=Dave |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=30 November 2001 |accessdate=25 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227122516/http://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/nov/30/guardianobituaries1 |archivedate=27 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}; {{harvnb|Leng|2006|pp=302–304}}: Harrison's earliest musical influences.&lt;/ref&gt; He often sat at the back of the class drawing guitars in his schoolbooks, and later commented, "I was totally into guitars."{{sfn|Lange|2001|p=6}} Harrison cited [[Slim Whitman]] as another early influence: "The first person I ever saw playing a guitar was Slim Whitman, either a photo of him in a magazine or live on television.

Although Harold Harrison was apprehensive about his son's interest in pursuing a music career, in 1956 he bought George a Dutch Egmond flat top acoustic guitar, which according to Harold, cost £3.10 (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|3.10|1956|r=-2}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Babiuk|2002|p=17}}: Dutch Egmond; {{harvnb|Boyd|2007|p=82}}: His father was apprehensive about his interest in pursuing a music career.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/beatles/beatlesbrowser-four3.shtml |title=The Beatles Browser: Part Four – Bill Harry – Mersey Beat |publisher=Triumphpc.com |date=1964-08-12 |accessdate=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his father's friends taught Harrison how to play "[[Whispering (song)|Whispering]]", "Sweet Sue" and "[[Dinah (song)|Dinah]]", and, inspired by Donegan's music, Harrison formed a skiffle group called the Rebels with his brother Peter and a friend, Arthur Kelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Babiuk|2002|p=17}}; {{harvnb|Everett|2001|p=36}}: A friend of his father's taught Harrison some chords; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=120}}; {{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article2106466.ece |title=Lives in Brief: Peter Harrison |date=20 July 2007 |work=[[The Times]] |accessdate=22 July 2007 |first=Sadie |last=Gray |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810114350/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article2106466.ece |archivedate=10 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the bus to school, Harrison met [[Paul McCartney]], who also attended the Liverpool Institute, and the pair bonded over their shared love of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Inglis|2010|pp=xiii–xiv}}; {{harvnb|Miles|2001|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison became part of the Beatles with McCartney and [[John Lennon]] when the band were still a skiffle group called [[the Quarrymen]]. In March 1958, he auditioned for the Quarrymen at [[Rory Storm]]'s Morgue Skiffle Club, playing [[Arthur "Guitar Boogie" Smith]]'s "[[Guitar Boogie (song)|Guitar Boogie Shuffle]]", but Lennon felt that Harrison, having just turned 15, was too young to join the band.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=125–126}} McCartney arranged a second meeting, on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, during which Harrison impressed Lennon by performing the lead guitar part for the instrumental "[[Raunchy (instrumental)|Raunchy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=47}}; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=127}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He began socialising with the group, filling in on guitar as needed,{{sfn|Davies|2009|pp=44–45}} and then became accepted as a member.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=13}} Although his father wanted him to continue his education, Harrison left school at 16 and worked for several months as an apprentice electrician at [[Blacklers]], a local department store.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyd|2007|p=82}}: (secondary source); {{harvnb|Davies|2009|p=55}}: (secondary source); {{harvnb|Harrison|2002|p=29}}: (primary source).&lt;/ref&gt; During the group's first tour of Scotland, in 1960, Harrison used the pseudonym "Carl Harrison", in reference to Carl Perkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewisohn |first=Mark |title=The Beatles: All These Years: Volume I: Tune In |year=2013|publisher=Crown Archetype|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4000-8305-3|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, promoter [[Allan Williams]] arranged for the band, now calling themselves the Beatles, to play at the [[Indra]] and [[Kaiserkeller]] clubs in [[Hamburg]], both owned by [[Bruno Koschmider]].{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=57–58}} Their first residency in Hamburg ended prematurely when Harrison was deported for being too young to work in nightclubs.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=27}} When [[Brian Epstein]] became their manager in December 1961, he polished up their image and later secured them a recording contract with [[EMI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Babiuk|2002|p=59}}; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|pp=84–88}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The group's first single, "[[Love Me Do]]", peaked at number seventeen on the ''[[Record Retailer]]'' chart, and by the time their debut album, ''[[Please Please Me]]'', was released in early 1963, [[Beatlemania]] had arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greene|2006|p=34}}; {{harvnb|Lewisohn|1992|pp=59–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Often serious and focused while on stage with the band, Harrison was known as "the quiet Beatle".&lt;ref name="guardianobit"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Laing |first=Dave |title=George Harrison 1943–2001 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/nov/30/guardianobituaries1 |date=30 November 2001 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=18 August 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227122516/http://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/nov/30/guardianobituaries1 |archivedate=27 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/1432634.stm |title=George Harrison: The quiet Beatle |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=18 August 2018|date=30 November 2001 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303201645/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/1432634.stm |archivedate=3 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had two lead vocal credits on the LP, including the [[Lennon–McCartney]] song "[[Do You Want to Know a Secret?]]", and three on their second album, ''[[With the Beatles]]'' (1963).{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|pp=66, 79, 82, 87}} The latter included "[[Don't Bother Me]]", Harrison's first solo writing credit.{{sfn|Everett|2001|p=193}}

Harrison served as the Beatles' scout for new American releases, being especially knowledgeable about [[soul music]].{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=148fn}} By 1965's ''[[Rubber Soul]]'', he had begun to lead the other Beatles into [[folk rock]] through his interest in [[the Byrds]] and [[Bob Dylan]], and towards [[Indian classical music]] through his use of the sitar on "[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Unterberger|2002|pp=180–181}}; {{harvnb|Leng|2006|p=19}}; {{harvnb|Everett|2001|pp=313–315}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Harrison also contributed the songs "[[If I Needed Someone]]" and "[[Think for Yourself]]" to ''Rubber Soul''.{{sfn|Womack|2007|pp=124–125}}}} He later called ''Rubber Soul'' his "favourite [Beatles] album".{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=194}} ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' (1966) included three of his compositions: "[[Taxman]]", selected as the album's opening track, "[[Love You To]]" and "[[I Want to Tell You]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leng|2006|p=19}}; {{harvnb|Schaffner|1980|pp=75–78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His drone-like [[Tanpura|tambura]] part on Lennon's "[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]" exemplified the band's ongoing exploration of non-Western instruments,{{sfn|Everett|1999|pp=35–36}} while the sitar- and [[tabla]]-based "Love You To" represented the Beatles' first genuine foray into Indian music.{{sfn|Everett|1999|pp=40–42}} According to the [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologist]] David Reck, the latter song set a precedent in popular music as an example of Asian culture being represented by Westerners respectfully and without parody.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leng|2006|p=22}}: (secondary source); {{cite journal|last=Reck|first=D.B.|title=Beatles Orientalis: Influences from Asia in a Popular Song Form|journal=Asian Music|volume=XVI|issue=1|year=1985|pages=83–150|doi=10.2307/834014|jstor=834014}}: (primary source)&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Nicholas Schaffner]] wrote in 1978 that following Harrison's increased association with the sitar after "Norwegian Wood", he became known as "the maharaja of [[raga-rock]]".{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=66}} Harrison continued to develop his interest in non-Western instrumentation, playing [[swarmandal]] on "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]".{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=74}}

By late 1966, Harrison's interests had moved away from the Beatles. This was reflected in his choice of Eastern [[guru]]s and religious leaders for inclusion on the album cover for ''[[Sgt.

In January 1968, he recorded the basic track for his song "[[The Inner Light (song)|The Inner Light]]" at EMI's studio in [[Mumbai|Bombay]], using a group of local musicians playing traditional Indian instruments.{{sfn|Tillery|2011|p=63}} Released as the B-side to McCartney's "[[Lady Madonna]]", it was the first Harrison composition to appear on a Beatles single.{{sfn|Tillery|2011|p=63}} Derived from a quotation from the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'', the song's lyric reflected Harrison's deepening interest in Hinduism and [[Transcendental Meditation|meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrison|2002|p=118}}; {{harvnb|Tillery|2011|p=87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the recording of ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' that same year, tensions within the group ran high, and drummer [[Ringo Starr]] quit briefly.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=295–296}} Harrison's four songwriting contributions to the double album included "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]", which featured [[Eric Clapton]] on lead guitar, and the [[Horn section|horn]]-driven "[[Savoy Truffle]]".{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=115}}

Dylan and [[the Band]] were a major musical influence on Harrison at the end of his career with the Beatles.{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=52}} While on a visit to [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]] in late 1968, he established a friendship with Dylan and found himself drawn to the Band's sense of communal music-making and to the creative equality among the band members, which contrasted with Lennon and McCartney's domination of the Beatles' songwriting and creative direction. This coincided with a prolific period in his songwriting and a growing desire to assert his independence from the Beatles.{{sfn|Leng|2006|pp=39–52}} Tensions among the group surfaced again in January 1969, at [[Twickenham Film Studios|Twickenham Studios]], during the filmed rehearsals that became the 1970 documentary ''[[Let It Be (film)|Let It Be]]''.{{sfn|Leng|2006|pp=39–52}} Frustrated by the cold and sterile film studio, by Lennon's creative disengagement from the Beatles, and by what he perceived as a domineering attitude from McCartney, Harrison quit the group on 10 January. He returned twelve days later, after his bandmates had agreed to move the film project to their own [[Apple Studio]] and to abandon McCartney's plan for making a return to public performance.{{sfn|Doggett|2009|pp=60–63}}

Relations among the Beatles were more cordial, though still strained, when the band recorded their 1969 album ''[[Abbey Road]]''.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=354}} The LP included what Lavezzoli describes as "two classic contributions" from Harrison – "[[Here Comes the Sun]]" and "[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]" – that saw him "finally achieve equal songwriting status" with Lennon and McCartney.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=185}} During the album's recording, Harrison asserted more creative control than before, rejecting suggestions for changes to his music, particularly from McCartney.{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=15}} "Something" became his first A-side when issued on a [[A-side and B-side#Double A-side|double A-side]] single with "[[Come Together]]"; the song was number one in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and West Germany,{{sfn|Sullivan|2013|p=563}} and the combined sides topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in the United States.{{sfn|Bronson|1992|p=262}} In the 1970s [[Frank Sinatra]] recorded "Something" twice (1970 and 1979) and later dubbed it "the greatest love song of the past fifty years".{{sfn|Fricke|2002|p=178}} Lennon considered it the best song on ''Abbey Road'', and it became the Beatles' second most covered song after "[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spignesi|Lewis|2009|p=97}}: "Something" is the Beatles' second most covered song after "Yesterday"; {{harvnb|Gilmore|2002|p=39}}: Lennon considered "Something" the best song on ''Abbey Road''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Harrison received an [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello award]] in July 1970 for "Something", as "The Best Song Musically and Lyrically of the Year".{{sfn|Badman|2001|p=12}}}}

In May 1970 Harrison's "[[For You Blue]]" was coupled on a US single with McCartney's "[[The Long and Winding Road]]" and became Harrison's second chart-topper when the sides were listed together at number one on the Hot 100.{{sfn|Bronson|1992|p=275}} His increased productivity meant that by the time of [[Break-up of the Beatles|their break-up]] he had amassed a stockpile of unreleased compositions.{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=36–37}} While Harrison grew as a songwriter, his compositional presence on Beatles albums remained limited to two or three songs, increasing his frustration, and significantly contributing to the band's break-up.{{sfn|George-Warren|2001|p=413}} Harrison's last recording session with the Beatles was on 4 January 1970, when he, McCartney and Starr recorded his song "[[I Me Mine]]" for the ''[[Let It Be]]'' soundtrack album.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=195}}

Before the Beatles' break-up, Harrison had already recorded and released two solo albums: ''[[Wonderwall Music]]'' and ''[[Electronic Sound]]'', both of which contain mainly instrumental compositions.

In 2000, Apple Records released a thirtieth anniversary edition of the album, and Harrison actively participated in its promotion.

You know, it's hard to go back to anything thirty years later and expect it to be how you would want it now."{{sfn|Harry|2003|pp=12–13}}

Harrison responded to a request from Ravi Shankar by organising a charity event, the Concert for Bangladesh, which took place on 1 August 1971. The event drew over 40,000 people to two shows in New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].&lt;ref name="ConcertforBangladesh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concertforbangladesh.com/|title=Concert for Bangladesh|publisher=Concert For Bangladesh|accessdate=1 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116114838/http://www.concertforbangladesh.com/|archivedate=16 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the event was to raise money to aid starving refugees during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].{{sfn|Harry|2003|pp=132–136}} Shankar opened the show, which featured popular musicians such as Dylan, Clapton, [[Leon Russell]], Badfinger, Preston and Starr.{{sfn|Harry|2003|pp=132–136}}

A triple album, ''[[The Concert for Bangladesh (album)|The Concert for Bangladesh]]'', was released by Apple in December, followed by a [[The Concert for Bangladesh (film)|concert film]] in 1972.{{refn|group=nb|In November 1971 Harrison appeared on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'', performing "Two-Faced Man" with [[Gary Wright]].{{sfn|Rodriguez|2010|pp=319–20}} In his subsequent interview with [[Dick Cavett|Cavett]], he used the opportunity to complain about Capitol's delay in releasing the live album and seeking a percentage of the funds intended for the Bangladeshi refugees.{{sfn|Tillery|2011|p=100}}}} Credited to "George Harrison and Friends", the album topped the UK chart and peaked at number 2 in the US,&lt;ref name="Dooley/Gibson" /&gt; and went on to win the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]].{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=194}} Tax troubles and questionable expenses later tied up many of the proceeds, but Harrison commented: "Mainly the concert was to attract attention to the situation&amp;nbsp;... The money we raised was secondary, and although we had some money problems&amp;nbsp;... they still got plenty&amp;nbsp;... even though it was a drop in the ocean. The main thing was, we spread the word and helped get the war ended."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doggett|2009|pp=181–206}}; {{harvnb|Harry|2003|pp=132–138}}; {{harvnb|Harry|2003|p=135}}: "Mainly the concert was to attract attention to the situation".&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Living in the Material World'' to ''George Harrison'': 1973–1979===

Harrison's 1973 album ''[[Living in the Material World]]'' held the number one spot on the ''Billboard'' albums chart for five weeks, and the album's single, "[[Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)]]", also reached number one in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bronson|1992|p=336}}: Peak US chart position for "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)"; {{harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=162}}: US chart data on ''Living in the Material World''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the LP peaked at number two and the single reached number 8.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=227}} The album was lavishly produced and packaged, and its dominant message was Harrison's Hindu beliefs.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|pp=158–159}} In Greene's opinion it "contained many of the strongest compositions of his career".{{sfn|Greene|2006|p=194}} [[Stephen Holden]], writing in ''Rolling Stone'', felt the album was "vastly appealing" and "profoundly seductive", and that it stood "alone as an article of faith, miraculous in its radiance".{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=195}} Other reviewers were less enthusiastic, describing the release as awkward, sanctimonious and overly sentimental.{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=43}}

In November 1974, Harrison became the first ex-Beatle to tour North America when he began his 45-date [[George Harrison and Ravi Shankar's 1974 North American tour|Dark Horse Tour]].{{sfn|Leng|2006|pp=166, 195}} The shows included guest spots by his band members Billy Preston and [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]], and traditional and contemporary Indian music performed by "Ravi Shankar, Family and Friends".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Inglis|2010|pp=48–49}}; {{harvnb|Leng|2006|p=167}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite numerous positive reviews, the consensus reaction to the tour was negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doggett|2009|pp=224–228}}; {{harvnb|Greene|2006|p=213}}; {{harvnb|Huntley|2006|p=115}}; {{harvnb|Inglis|2010|p=49}}; {{harvnb|Leng|2006|p=162}}: "an excellent show"; {{harvnb|Tillery|2011|pp=114–115}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some fans found Shankar's significant presence to be a bizarre disappointment, and many were affronted by what Inglis described as Harrison's "sermonizing".{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=49}} Further, he reworked the lyrics to several Beatles songs,{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=49}} and his [[laryngitis]]-affected vocals led to some critics calling the tour "dark hoarse".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greene|2006|pp=213–214}}; {{harvnb|Doggett|2009|pp=224–226}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The author Robert Rodriguez commented: "While the Dark Horse tour might be considered a noble failure, there were a number of fans who were tuned-in to what was being attempted. They went away ecstatic, conscious that they had just witnessed something so uplifting that it could never be repeated."{{sfn|Rodriguez|2010|p=258}} Simon Leng called the tour "groundbreaking" and "revolutionary in its presentation of Indian Music".{{sfn|Leng|2006|pp=173, 177}}

In December, Harrison released ''[[Dark Horse (George Harrison album)|Dark Horse]]'', which was an album that earned him the least favourable reviews of his career.{{sfn|Greene|2006|p=213}} ''Rolling Stone'' called it "the chronicle of a performer out of his element, working to a deadline, enfeebling his overtaxed talents by a rush to deliver a new 'LP product', rehearse a band, and assemble a cross-country tour, all within three weeks".{{sfn|Huntley|2006|p=114}} The album reached number 4 on the ''Billboard'' chart and the single "[[Dark Horse (George Harrison song)|Dark Horse]]" reached number 15, but they failed to make an impact in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greene|2006|p=213}}: failed to reach the UK top 30; {{harvnb|Harry|2003|pp=142–143}}: Peak US chart positions, failure to impact UK charts.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|In December 1974 the single, "[[Ding Dong, Ding Dong]]", reached number 38 in the UK.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=227}}}} The music critic [[Mikal Gilmore]] described ''Dark Horse'' as "one of Harrison's most fascinating works – a record about change and loss".{{sfn|Gilmore|2002|p=46}}

Harrison's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records, the [[soul music]]-inspired ''[[Extra Texture (Read All About It)]]'' (1975),{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=180}} peaked at number 8 on the ''Billboard'' chart and number 16 in the UK.{{sfn|Huntley|2006|p=129}} Harrison considered it the least satisfactory of the three albums he had recorded since ''All Things Must Pass''.{{sfn|Inglis|2010|pp=54–55}} Leng identified "bitterness and dismay" in many of the tracks; his long-time friend Klaus Voormann commented: "He wasn't up for it&amp;nbsp;... It was a terrible time because I think there was a lot of cocaine going around, and that's when I got out of the picture&amp;nbsp;... I didn't like his frame of mind".{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=179}} He released two singles from the LP: "[[You (George Harrison song)|You]]", which reached the ''Billboard'' top 20, and "[[This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)]]", Apple's final original single release.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|pp=209–210}}

''[[Thirty Three &amp; 1/3]]'' (1976), Harrison's first album release on his own Dark Horse Records label, produced the hit singles "[[This Song]]" and "[[Crackerbox Palace]]", both of which reached the top 25 in the US.{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=187}}{{refn|group=nb|Released during the same month, ''[[The Best of George Harrison]]'' combined several of his Beatles songs with a selection of his solo Apple work.{{sfn|Harry|2003|pp=28–29}} After Harrison's departure from the label, Capitol was able to license releases featuring Beatles and post-Beatles work on the same album.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=188}}}} The [[surreal humour]] of "Crackerbox Palace" reflected Harrison's association with [[Monty Python]]'s [[Eric Idle]], who directed a comical music video for the song.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=192}} With an emphasis on melody and musicianship, and a more subtle subject matter than the pious message of his earlier works, ''Thirty Three &amp; 1/3'' earned Harrison his most favourable critical notices in the US since ''All Things Must Pass''.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=192}} The album peaked just outside the top ten there, but outsold his previous two LPs.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|pp=192, 195}}{{sfn|Woffinden|1981|pp=103–04}} As part of his promotion for the release, Harrison performed on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' with [[Paul Simon]].{{sfn|Glazer|1977|p=41}}

In 1988, Harrison formed the Traveling Wilburys with Jeff Lynne, [[Roy Orbison]], Bob Dylan and Tom Petty.

The LP, ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1]]'', was released in October 1988 and recorded under pseudonyms as half-brothers, supposed sons of Charles Truscott Wilbury, Sr.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greene|2006|p=240}}; {{harvnb|Tillery|2011|p=133}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It reached number 16 in the UK and number 3 in the US, where it was certified [[RIAA certification|triple platinum]].&lt;ref name="RIAA G&amp;P"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?artist=%22Traveling+Wilburys%22|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130201104412/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?artist=%22Traveling+Wilburys%22|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 February 2013|title=RIAA – Gold &amp; Platinum Searchable Database|accessdate=1 January 2013|publisher=Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison's pseudonym on the album was "Nelson Wilbury"; he used the name "Spike Wilbury" for their second album.{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=267}}

Following Orbison's death in December 1988, the Wilburys recorded as a four-piece.{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=379}} Their second album, issued in October 1990, was mischievously titled ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3]]''.

==Musicianship==
===Guitar work===
[[File:Harrison - guitare.jpg|thumb|left|Harrison's burgundy Les Paul]]

Harrison's guitar work with the Beatles was varied and flexible. Although not fast or flashy, his lead guitar playing was solid and typified the more subdued lead guitar style of the early 1960s; his rhythm guitar playing was as innovative, such as using a [[capo]] to shorten the strings on an acoustic guitar, as on the ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' album and "[[Here Comes the Sun]]", to create a bright, sweet sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.acousticguitar.com/issues/ag122/feature122.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010121901/http://www.acousticguitar.com/issues/ag122/feature122.html

He played exquisitely in the service of the song".{{sfn|Harrison|2002|p=15}} The [[guitar picking]] style of [[Chet Atkins]] and Carl Perkins influenced Harrison, giving a [[country music]] feel to many of the Beatles' recordings.{{sfn|Kitts|2002|p=17}} He identified [[Chuck Berry]] as another early influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2003|pp=294–95}}: Perkins; {{harvnb|Harry|2000|pp=140–41}}: Berry.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961 the Beatles recorded "[[Cry for a Shadow]]", a blues-inspired instrumental co-written by Lennon and Harrison, who is credited with composing the song's lead guitar part, building on unusual chord voicings and imitating the style of other English groups such as [[the Shadows]].{{sfn|Leng|2006|pp=4–5}} Harrison's liberal use of the [[diatonic scale]] in his guitar playing reveals the influence of [[Buddy Holly]], and his interest in Berry inspired him to compose songs based on the [[blues scale]] while incorporating a [[rockabilly]] feel in the style of Perkins.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=13}}{{refn|group=nb|Within this framework he often used [[syncopation]], as during his guitar solos for the Beatles' covers of Berry's "[[Roll Over Beethoven]]" and "[[Too Much Monkey Business]]".{{sfn|Everett|2001|pp=62–63, 136}}}} Another of Harrison's musical techniques was the use of guitar lines written in [[octave]]s, as on "[[I'll Be on My Way]]".{{sfn|Everett|2001|pp=134–135}}

By 1964 he had begun to develop a distinctive personal style as a guitarist, writing parts that featured the use of nonresolving tones, as with the ending chord arpeggios on "[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]]".{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=13}} On this and other songs from the period, he used a [[Rickenbacker 360/12]] – an electric guitar with twelve strings, the low eight of which are tuned in pairs, one octave apart, with the higher four being pairs tuned in unison.{{sfn|Everett|2001|pp=134–135}} His use of the Rickenbacker on ''[[A Hard Day's Night (album)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' helped to popularise the model, and the jangly sound became so prominent that ''[[Melody Maker]]'' termed it the Beatles' "secret weapon".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Babiuk|2002|p=120}}: "secret weapon"; {{harvnb|Leng|2006|p=14}}: Harrison helped to popularise the model.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|[[Roger McGuinn]] liked the effect so much that it became his signature guitar sound with the Byrds.{{sfn|Doggett|Hodgson|2004|p=82}}}} In 1965 Harrison used an [[Expression pedal#Guitars and digital effects|expression pedal]] to control his guitar's volume on "[[I Need You (The Beatles song)|I Need You]]", creating a syncopated [[String instrument#Contact points along the string|flautando]] effect with the melody resolving its [[Consonance and dissonance#Dissonance|dissonance]] through tonal displacements.{{sfn|Everett|2001|pp=284–285}} He used the same volume-swell technique on "[[Yes It Is]]", applying what Everett described as "ghostly articulation" to the song's [[Harmonic|natural harmonics]].{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=13}}

In 1966 Harrison contributed innovative musical ideas to ''Revolver''. He played [[Backmasking|backwards]] guitar on Lennon's composition "[[I'm Only Sleeping]]" and a guitar [[counter-melody]] on "[[And Your Bird Can Sing]]" that moved in parallel octaves above McCartney's bass downbeats.{{sfn|Everett|1999|pp=47, 49–51}} His guitar playing on "[[I Want to Tell You]]" exemplified the pairing of altered chordal colours with descending chromatic lines and his guitar part for ''Sgt Pepper''{{'}}s "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]" mirrors Lennon's vocal line in much the same way that a [[sarangi]] player accompanies a [[khyal]] singer in a Hindu [[bhajan|devotional song]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Everett|1999|p=58}}: "I Want to Tell You"; {{harvnb|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=179–180}}: Harrison's guitar part for "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds",&lt;/ref&gt;

Everett described Harrison's guitar solo from "[[Old Brown Shoe]]" as "stinging [and] highly Claptonesque".{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=243}} He identified two of the composition's significant [[Motif (music)|motifs]]: a bluesy [[trichord]] and a [[diminished triad]] with roots in A and E.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=244}} Huntley called the song "a sizzling rocker with a ferocious&amp;nbsp;... solo".{{sfn|Huntley|2006|p=35}} In Greene's opinion, Harrison's demo for "Old Brown Shoe" contains "one of the most complex lead guitar solos on any Beatles song".{{sfn|Greene|2006|p=140}}

Harrison's playing on ''Abbey Road'', and in particular on "Something", marked a significant moment in his development as a guitarist. The song's guitar solo shows a varied range of influences, incorporating the blues guitar style of Clapton and the styles of Indian [[Gamaka (music)|gamakas]].{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=42}} According to author and musicologist Kenneth Womack: "'Something' meanders toward the most unforgettable of Harrison's guitar solos&amp;nbsp;... A masterpiece in simplicity, [it] reaches toward the sublime".{{sfn|Womack|2006|p=189}}

After [[Delaney Bramlett]] inspired him to learn slide guitar, Harrison began to incorporate it into his solo work, which allowed him to mimic many traditional Indian instruments, including the sarangi and the [[Esraj|dilruba]].{{sfn|Leng|2006|pp=84–85}} Leng described Harrison's slide guitar solo on Lennon's "[[How Do You Sleep? (John Lennon song)|How Do You Sleep?"]] as a departure for "the sweet soloist of 'Something'", calling his playing "rightly famed&amp;nbsp;... one of Harrison's greatest guitar statements".{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=109}} Lennon commented: "That's the best he's ever fucking played in his life."{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=109}}

A [[Music of Hawaii|Hawaiian]] influence is notable in much of Harrison's music, ranging from his slide guitar work on ''Gone Troppo'' (1982) to his televised performance of the [[Cab Calloway]] standard "[[Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea (song)|Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea]]" on [[ukulele]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2003|pp=29–30}}: Performing "Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea" with Holland; {{harvnb|Leng|2006|p=232}}: Hawaiian influence on ''Gone Troppo''.&lt;/ref&gt; Lavezzoli described Harrison's slide playing on the Grammy-winning instrumental "Marwa Blues" (2002) as demonstrating Hawaiian influences while comparing the melody to an Indian [[sarod]] or [[veena]], calling it "yet another demonstration of Harrison's unique slide approach".{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=198}} Harrison was an admirer of [[George Formby]] and a member of the Ukulele Society of Great Britain, and played a ukulele solo in the style of Formby at the end of "[[Free as a Bird]]".{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=279}} He performed at a Formby convention in 1991, and served as the honorary president of the George Formby Appreciation Society.{{sfn|Huntley|2006|pp=149, 232}} Harrison played bass guitar on numerous tracks, including the Beatles songs "[[She Said She Said]]", "[[Golden Slumbers]]", "[[Birthday (The Beatles song)|Birthday]]" and "[[Honey Pie]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Everett|1999|pp=65: "She Said She Said", 268: "Golden Slumbers", 196: "Birthday", 190: "Honey Pie"}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played bass on several solo recordings, including "[[Faster (George Harrison song)|Faster]]", "[[Wake Up My Love]]" and "[[Bye Bye Love (The Everly Brothers song)#George Harrison's version|Bye Bye Love]]".{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=205: "Faster", 230: "Wake Up My Love", 152: "Bye Bye Love"}}

===Sitar and Indian music===
[[File:Ravi Shankar.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Ravi Shankar]], who taught Harrison the [[sitar]] (taken in 1969)]]

During the Beatles' American tour in August 1965, Harrison's friend [[David Crosby]] of the Byrds introduced him to [[Indian classical music]] and the work of [[sitar]] maestro [[Ravi Shankar]].{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=147}} Harrison described Shankar as "the first person who ever impressed me in my life&amp;nbsp;... and he was the only person who didn't try to impress me."{{sfn|Harrison|2011|p=216}} Harrison became fascinated with the sitar and immersed himself in [[Music of India|Indian music]].{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=172}} According to Lavezzoli, Harrison's introduction of the instrument on the Beatles' song "Norwegian Wood" "opened the floodgates for Indian instrumentation in rock music, triggering what Shankar would call 'The Great Sitar Explosion' of 1966–67".{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=171}} Lavezzoli recognises Harrison as "the man most responsible for this phenomenon".{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=171–172}}{{refn|group=nb|Harrison was influential in the decision to have Shankar included on the bill at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] in 1967, and at [[Woodstock]] in 1969.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=106, 172}}}}

In June 1966 Harrison met Shankar at the home of Mrs Angadi of the Asian Music Circle, asked to be his student, and was accepted.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=176}} Before this meeting, Harrison had recorded his ''Revolver'' track "[[Love You To]]", contributing a sitar part that Lavezzoli describes as an "astonishing improvement" over "Norwegian Wood" and "the most accomplished performance on sitar by any rock musician".{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=175}} On 6 July, Harrison travelled to India to buy a sitar from Rikhi Ram &amp; Sons in New Delhi.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=176}} In September, following the Beatles' final tour, he returned to India to study sitar for six weeks with Shankar.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=176}} He initially stayed in Bombay until fans learned of his arrival, then moved to a houseboat on a remote lake in [[Kashmir]].{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=176}} During this visit, he also received tutelage from Shambhu Das, Shankar's protégé.{{sfn|Clayson|2003|p=206}}{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=71}}

Harrison studied the instrument until 1968, when, following a discussion with Shankar about the need to find his "roots", an encounter with Clapton and [[Jimi Hendrix]] at a hotel in New York convinced him to return to guitar playing. Harrison commented: "I decided&amp;nbsp;... I'm not going to be a great sitar player&amp;nbsp;... because I should have started at least fifteen years earlier."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrison|2002|p=57}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=184–185}}: (secondary source).&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison continued to use Indian instrumentation occasionally on his solo albums and remained strongly associated with the genre.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=172–173, 197}} Lavezzoli groups him with [[Paul Simon]] and [[Peter Gabriel]] as the three rock musicians who have given the most "mainstream exposure to non-Western musics, or the concept of '[[world music]]'".{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=81}}

===Songwriting===
Harrison wrote his first song, "Don't Bother Me", while sick in a hotel bed in Bournemouth during August 1963, as "an exercise to see if I ''could'' write a song", &lt;!--emphasis in original--&gt;as he remembered.{{sfn|Harrison|2002|p=84}} His songwriting ability improved throughout the Beatles' career, but his material did not earn full respect from Lennon, McCartney and producer [[George Martin]] until near the group's break-up.{{sfn|Gilmore|2002|pp=38–39}} In 1969, McCartney told Lennon: "Until this year, our songs have been better than George's. Now this year his songs are at least as good as ours".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=554}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Fawcett|1977|p=96}}: (secondary source).&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison often had difficulty getting the band to record his songs.{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2008|p=174}}{{sfn|George-Warren|2001|p=413}} Most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contain at least two Harrison compositions; three of his songs appear on ''Revolver'', "the album on which Harrison came of age as a songwriter", according to Inglis.{{sfn|Inglis|2010|pp=xv: most Beatles albums contain at least two Harrison compositions, 7:''Revolver''}}

{{Listen|filename= "Within You Without You" by the Beatles, written by George Harrison, 1967.ogg |title="Within You Without You"|description=An audio sample of Harrison's "Within You Without You", 1967}}

Harrison wrote the [[chord progression]] of "Don't Bother Me" almost exclusively in the [[Dorian mode]], demonstrating an interest in exotic tones that eventually culminated in his embrace of Indian music.{{sfn|Everett|2001|pp=193–94}} The latter proved a strong influence on his songwriting and contributed to his innovation within the Beatles. According to [[Mikal Gilmore]] of ''Rolling Stone'', "Harrison's openness to new sounds and textures cleared new paths for his rock and roll compositions. His use of dissonance on&amp;nbsp;... 'Taxman' and 'I Want to Tell You' was revolutionary in popular music – and perhaps more originally creative than the avant-garde mannerisms that Lennon and McCartney borrowed from the music of [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[Edgard Varèse]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]]&amp;nbsp;..."{{sfn|Gilmore|2002|p=37}}

Of the 1967 Harrison song "Within You Without You", author Gerry Farrell said that Harrison had created a "new form", calling the composition "a quintessential fusion of pop and Indian music".{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=31}} Lennon called the song one of Harrison's best: "His mind and his music are clear. There is his innate talent, he brought that sound together."{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=243}} In his next fully Indian-styled song, "The Inner Light", Harrison embraced the [[Carnatic music|Karnatak]] discipline of Indian music, rather than the [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] style he had used in "Love You To" and "Within You Without You".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrison|2002|p=118}}; {{harvnb|Lavezzoli|2006|p=183}}; {{harvnb|Tillery|2011|p=87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1997, Farrell commented: "It is a mark of Harrison's sincere involvement with Indian music that, nearly thirty years on, the Beatles' 'Indian' songs remain the most imaginative and successful examples of this type of fusion – for example, '[[Blue Jay Way]]' and 'The Inner Light'."{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=316}}

Beatles biographer Bob Spitz described "Something" as a masterpiece, and "an intensely stirring romantic ballad that would challenge 'Yesterday' and 'Michelle' as one of the most recognizable songs they ever produced".{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=837}} Inglis considered ''Abbey Road'' a turning point in Harrison's development as a songwriter and musician. He described Harrison's two contributions to the LP, "Here Comes the Sun" and "Something", as "exquisite", declaring them equal to any previous Beatles songs.{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=15}}

In 1974 Harrison founded [[Dark Horse Records]] as an avenue for collaboration with other musicians.{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=147}} He wanted Dark Horse to serve as a creative outlet for artists, as Apple Records had for the Beatles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doggett|2009|p=224}}; {{harvnb|Inglis|2010|p=59}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Idle commented: "He's extremely generous, and he backs and supports all sorts of people that you'll never, ever hear of."{{sfn|Doggett|2009|p=262}} The first acts signed to the new label were Ravi Shankar and the duo [[Splinter (band)|Splinter]].

==Film production and HandMade Films==
{{Main|HandMade Films}}

Harrison helped finance Ravi Shankar's documentary ''[[Raga (film)|Raga]]'' and released it through [[Apple Films]] in 1971.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=187}} He also produced, with Apple manager [[Allen Klein]], the ''Concert for Bangladesh'' film.{{sfn|Dawtrey|2002|p=204}} In 1973, he produced the feature film ''[[Little Malcolm]]'',{{sfn|Badman|2001|p=90}} but the project was lost amid the litigation surrounding the former Beatles ending their business ties with Klein.{{sfn|Clayson|2003|p=346, 370}}

In 1973 [[Peter Sellers]] introduced Harrison to [[Denis O'Brien (producer)|Denis O'Brien]]. Soon after, the two went into business together.{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=211}} In 1978, in an effort to produce ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'', they formed the film production and distribution company HandMade Films.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2009|pp=362–363}}; {{harvnb|Doggett|2009|p=262}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their opportunity for investment came after [[EMI Films]] withdrew funding at the demand of their chief executive, [[Bernard Delfont]].{{sfn|Harry|2003|pp=211–212}} Harrison financed the production of ''Life of Brian'' in part by mortgaging his home, which Idle later called "the most anybody's ever paid for a cinema ticket in history".{{sfn|Doggett|2009|p=262}} The film grossed $21&amp;nbsp;million at the box office in the US.{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=211}} The first film distributed by HandMade Films was ''[[The Long Good Friday]]'' (1980), and the first they produced was ''[[Time Bandits]]'' (1981), a co-scripted project by [[Monty Python]]{{'}}s [[Terry Gilliam]] and [[Michael Palin]].{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=212}} The film featured a new song by Harrison, "[[Dream Away (George Harrison song)|Dream Away]]", in the closing credits.{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=83}} ''Time Bandits'' became one of HandMade's most successful and acclaimed efforts; with a budget of $5&amp;nbsp;million, it earned $35&amp;nbsp;million in the US within ten weeks of its release.{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=83}}

Harrison served as [[Film producer|executive producer]] for 23 films with HandMade, including ''[[A Private Function]]'', ''[[Mona Lisa (1986 film)|Mona Lisa]]'', ''[[Shanghai Surprise]]'', ''[[Withnail and I]]'' and ''[[How to Get Ahead in Advertising]]''.{{sfn|Dawtrey|2002|p=204}} He made [[cameo appearance]]s in several of these films, including a role as a [[nightclub singer]] in ''Shanghai Surprise'', for which he recorded five new songs.{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=244}} According to Ian Inglis, Harrison's "executive role in HandMade Films helped to sustain British cinema at a time of crisis, producing some of the country's most memorable movies of the 1980s."{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=xvi}} Following a series of [[box office bomb]]s in the late 1980s, and excessive debt incurred by O'Brien which was [[loan guarantee|guaranteed]] by Harrison, HandMade's financial situation became precarious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sellers |first=Robert |date=2013 |title=Very Naughty Boys: The Amazing True Stories of HandMade Films |url= |location=London |publisher=Titan Books |page= |isbn=9781781167083}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dawtrey|2002|p=207}} The company ceased operations in 1991 and was sold three years later to Paragon Entertainment, a Canadian corporation.{{sfn|Harry|2003|pp=214–15}} Afterwards, Harrison sued O'Brien for $25&amp;nbsp;million for fraud and negligence, resulting in an $11.6&amp;nbsp;million judgement in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Chris.

==Humanitarian work==
Harrison was involved in humanitarian and political activism throughout his life. In the 1960s, the Beatles supported the [[civil rights movement]] and protested against the [[Vietnam War]]. In early 1971, Ravi Shankar consulted Harrison about how to provide aid to the people of Bangladesh after the [[1970 Bhola cyclone]] and the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].&lt;ref name="theconcertforbangladesh1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theconcertforbangladesh.com/|title=The Concert For Bangladesh|publisher=The Concert For Bangladesh |accessdate=13 October 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012112816/http://www.theconcertforbangladesh.com/|archivedate=12 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison hastily wrote and recorded the song "[[Bangla Desh (song)|Bangla Desh]]", which became pop music's first [[charity single]] when issued by Apple Records in late July.{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=112}}{{sfn|Frontani|2009|pp=158–59}} He also pushed Apple to release Shankar's ''[[Joi Bangla]]'' EP in an effort to raise further awareness for the cause.&lt;ref name="Dooley/Gibson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/spotlight-0801-2011.aspx|title=This Day in Music Spotlight: George Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh|date=1 August 2011|last=Dooley|first=Sean Patrick|accessdate=1 January 2013|publisher=[[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131153846/http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/spotlight-0801-2011.aspx|archivedate=31 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shankar asked for Harrison's advice about planning a small charity event in the US.

==Personal life==

===Hinduism===
[[File:George Harrison Vrindavan.jpg|thumb|alt=Harrison with two Hare Krishna devotees, 1996|Harrison, with [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] devotees Shyamasundar Das and [[Mukunda Goswami]], in [[Vrindavan]], India, in 1996]]

By the mid-1960s Harrison had become an admirer of [[Culture of India|Indian culture]] and mysticism, introducing it to the other Beatles.{{sfn|Schaffner|1980|pp=77–78}} During the filming of ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'' in the Bahamas, they met the founder of [[Sivananda Yoga]], [[Vishnudevananda Saraswati|Swami Vishnu-devananda]], who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, ''The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga''.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=173}} Between the end of the last Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the ''Sgt Pepper'' recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his wife Pattie; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several [[guru]]s, and visited various holy places.{{sfn|Doggett|2009|p=33}} In 1968 he travelled to [[Rishikesh]] in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]].{{sfn|Doggett|2009|p=33}}{{refn|group=nb|Harrison credited English sculptor [[David Wynne (sculptor)|David Wynne]] as the person who first recommended the Mararishi as a "remarkable" yogi, after which the Beatles attended a lecture he gave in London in August 1967.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=260}}}} Harrison's use of [[psychedelic drug]]s encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: "For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]], it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time – these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music."{{sfn|Glazer|1977|p=41}}

In line with the Hindu [[yoga]] tradition, Harrison became a vegetarian in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greene|2006|p=69}}: In line with the Hindu yoga tradition; {{harvnb|Clayson|2003|p=208}}; {{harvnb|Greene|2006|p=158}}: Harrison became a vegetarian in the late 1960s.&lt;/ref&gt; After being given various religious texts by Shankar in 1966, he remained a lifelong advocate of the teachings of [[Swami Vivekananda]] and [[Paramahansa Yogananda]] – yogis and authors, respectively, of ''[[Raja Yoga (book)|Raja Yoga]]'' and ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greene|2006|pp=68–73}}; {{harvnb|Tillery|2011|pp=56–58}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1969, he produced the single "[[Hare Krishna Mantra (song)|Hare Krishna Mantra]]", performed by members of the London [[Radha Krishna Temple]].{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=153}} Having also helped the Temple devotees become established in Britain, Harrison then met their leader, [[A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]], whom he described as "my friend ... my master" and "a perfect example of everything he preached".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clayson|2003|pp=267–70}}; {{harvnb|Chant and Be Happy|1997|pp=26–27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison embraced the Hare Krishna tradition, particularly ''[[Japa|japa-yoga]]'' chanting with beads, and became a lifelong devotee.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=153}}{{refn|group=nb|In 1972 he bequeathed to the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] his [[Letchmore Heath]] mansion north of London. It was later converted to a temple and renamed [[Bhaktivedanta Manor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huntley|2006|p=87}}; {{harvnb|Tillery|2011|p=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Regarding other faiths he once remarked: "All religions are branches of one big tree. It doesn't matter what you call Him just as long as you call."{{sfn|Tillery|2011|p=78}} He commented on his beliefs:

{{quote|Krishna actually was in a body as a person&amp;nbsp;... What makes it complicated is, if he's God, what's he doing fighting on a battlefield? It took me ages to try to figure that out, and again it was Yogananda's spiritual interpretation of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' that made me realise what it was. Our idea of Krishna and [[Arjuna]] on the battlefield in the chariot. So this is the point – that we're in these bodies, which is like a kind of chariot, and we're going through this incarnation, this life, which is kind of a battlefield. The senses of the body&amp;nbsp;... are the horses pulling the chariot, and we have to get control over the chariot by getting control over the reins. And Arjuna in the end says, "Please Krishna, you drive the chariot" because unless we bring [[Jesus|Christ]] or Krishna or [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] or whichever of our spiritual guides&amp;nbsp;... we're going to crash our chariot, and we're going to turn over, and we're going to get killed in the battlefield. That's why we say "''Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna''", asking Krishna to come and take over the chariot.{{sfn|Glazer|1977|pp=39–40}}}}

Before his religious conversion, the only British performer known for similar activities had been [[Cliff Richard]], whose conversion to Christianity in 1966 had gone largely unnoticed by the public. "By contrast," wrote Inglis, "Harrison's spiritual journey was seen as a serious and important development that reflected popular music's increasing maturity&amp;nbsp;... what he, and the Beatles, had managed to overturn was the paternalistic assumption that popular musicians had no role other than to stand on stage and sing their hit songs."{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=11}}

===Family and interests===
[[File:Kinfauns George Harrison house.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Kinfauns, a white house | Harrison and [[Pattie Boyd]]
 lived in [[Kinfauns]] in Surrey from 1964 to 1970]]

Harrison married model [[Pattie Boyd]] on 21 January 1966, with McCartney serving as [[Groomsman#Best man|best man]].{{sfn|Miles|2007|p=210}} Harrison and Boyd had met in 1964 during the production of the film ''A Hard Day's Night'', in which the 19-year-old Boyd had been cast as a schoolgirl.{{sfn|Boyd|2007|p=60}} They separated in 1974 and their divorce was finalised in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Badman|2001|p=210}}: Divorce date; {{harvnb|Doggett|2009|p=209}}: separated in 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd said her decision to end the marriage was due largely to George's repeated infidelities. The last infidelity culminated in an affair with Ringo's wife [[Maureen Starkey Tigrett|Maureen]], which Boyd called "the final straw".{{sfn|Boyd|2007|pp=179–180}} She characterised the last year of their marriage as "fuelled by alcohol and cocaine", and she stated: "George used coke excessively, and I think it changed him&amp;nbsp;... it froze his emotions and hardened his heart."{{sfn|Boyd|2007|p=181}} She subsequently moved in with [[Eric Clapton]], and they married in 1979.{{sfn|Doggett|2009|p=261}}{{refn|group=nb|Harrison had formed a close friendship with Clapton in the late 1960s, and he wrote one of his compositions for the ''Abbey Road'' album, "[[Here Comes the Sun]]", in Clapton's back garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2003|p=227}}; {{harvnb|Leng|2006|p=53}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Harrison married Dark Horse Records' secretary [[Olivia Harrison|Olivia Trinidad Arias]] on 2 September 1978. They had met at the [[A&amp;M Records]] offices in Los Angeles in 1974, and together had one son, [[Dhani Harrison]], born on 1 August 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2003|pp=217–218, 223–224}}; {{harvnb|Inglis|2010|pp=50, 82}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He restored the English manor house and grounds of Friar Park, his home in [[Henley-on-Thames]], where several of his music videos were filmed including "[[Crackerbox Palace]]"; the grounds also served as the background for the cover of ''All Things Must Pass''.{{sfn|Greene|2006|pp=226–227}}{{refn|group=nb|The house had once belonged to the Victorian eccentric Sir [[Frank Crisp]].

Harrison had an interest in [[sports car]]s and [[Motorsport|motor racing]]; he was one of the 100 people who purchased the [[McLaren F1]] road car.{{sfn|Buckley|2004|p=127}} He had collected photos of racing drivers and their cars since he was young; at 12 he had attended his first race, the [[1955 British Grand Prix]] at [[Aintree Racecourse#Motor racing|Aintree]].{{sfn|Buckley|2004|p=127}}&lt;ref&gt;

===Relationships with the other Beatles===
[[File:The Beatles in America.JPG|thumb|alt=The Beatles in New York City in 1964, waving to a large crowd|Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr on arrival in New York City at the height of [[Beatlemania]], February 1964]]
For most of the Beatles' career the relationships in the group were close. According to [[Hunter Davies]], "the Beatles spent their lives not living a communal life, but communally living the same life. They were each other's greatest friends." Harrison's ex-wife Pattie Boyd described how the Beatles "all belonged to each other" and admitted, "George has a lot with the others that I can never know about. Nobody, not even the wives, can break through or even comprehend it."{{sfn|Davies|2009|p=325}} Starr said, "We really looked out for each other and we had so many laughs together. In the old days we'd have the biggest hotel suites, the whole floor of the hotel, and the four of us would end up in the bathroom, just to be with each other". He added, "there were some really loving, caring moments between four people: a hotel room here and there – a really amazing closeness. Just four guys who loved each other. It was pretty sensational."{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=357}}

Lennon stated that his relationship with Harrison was "one of young follower and older guy&amp;nbsp;... [he] was like a disciple of mine when we started."{{sfn|Sheff|1981|p=148}} The two later bonded over their [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] experiences, finding common ground as seekers of spirituality. They took radically different paths thereafter, Harrison finding God and Lennon coming to the conclusion that people are the creators of their own lives.{{sfn|Tillery|2011|p=122}} In 1974 Harrison said of his former bandmate: "John Lennon is a saint and he's heavy-duty, and he's great and I love him. But at the same time, he's such a ''bastard'' – but that's the great thing about him, you see?"{{sfn|Harrison|1975|page=event occurs at 30 minutes 3–15 seconds}}

Harrison and McCartney were the first of the Beatles to meet, having shared a school bus, and often learned and rehearsed new guitar chords together.{{sfn|Inglis|2010|pp=xiii–xiv}} McCartney stated that he and Harrison usually shared a bedroom while touring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Joan|last=Goodman|title=Playboy interview: Paul and Linda McCartney|journal=[[Playboy]]|date=December 1984|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney has referred to Harrison as his "baby brother".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first1=Oliver|last1=Poole|first2=Hugh|last2=Davies|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1363989/Ill-always-love-him-hes-my-baby-brother-says-tearful-McCartney.html|title=I'll always love him, he's my baby brother, says tearful McCartney|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=1 December 2001|accessdate=22 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507033014/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1363989/Ill-always-love-him-hes-my-baby-brother-says-tearful-McCartney.html|archivedate=7 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1974 BBC radio interview with [[Alan Freeman]], Harrison stated: "[McCartney] ruined me as a guitar player".{{sfn|Badman|2001|pp=138–139}} Perhaps the most significant obstacle to a Beatles reunion after the death of Lennon was Harrison and McCartney's personal relationship, as both men admitted that they often got on each other's nerves.{{sfn|Gilmore|2002|p=48}} Rodriguez commented: "Even to the end of George's days, theirs was a volatile relationship".{{sfn|Rodriguez|2010|p=24}}

'''George Patrick Lee''' (March 23, 1943 – July 28, 2010) was the first [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] to become a [[general authority]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church).&lt;ref name = nytimes/&gt; He was a member of the church's [[First Quorum of Seventy]] from 1975 to 1989, when he was excommunicated from the church.&lt;ref name = nytimes/&gt;&lt;ref name = sltrib&gt;[[Peggy Fletcher Stack]] and Kristen Moulton, [http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/50019546-78/lee-george-lds-church.html.csp "Ousted LDS leader dies"], ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'', 2010-08-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Lee was born in [[Towaoc, Colorado|Towaoc]], [[Colorado]], to Mae K. Lee ({{spell-nv|Asdzą́ą́ Łichííʼ}}) of the {{spell-nv|Tódíchʼíiʼnii}} clan, and to a Medicine Man, Peter Lee ({{spell-nv|Hastiin Jaanééz Yee Biyeʼ}}), of the Under the Flat-Roofed House People clan. One of 17 children from his parents' marriages, Lee was called {{spell-nv|Ashkii Yázhí}} (Little Boy), until he was given a sacred name, {{spell-nv|Ashkii Hoyáanii}} (Boy Who is Well Behaved and Good).

When he was 12 years old, Lee became one of the first children to participate in an official Indian foster placement program sponsored by the LDS Church.&lt;ref name=Ensign&gt;[http://www.lds.org/ensign/1975/11/news-of-the-church/elder-george-patrick-lee-of-the-first-quorum-of-the-seventy "Elder George Patrick Lee of the First Quorum of the Seventy"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', November 1975, pp. 136–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Lee was transported to [[Orem, Utah|Orem]], [[Utah]], where he lived with the Glen and Joan Harker family. Lee remained in their home for seven years, returning to his Navajo family during summer vacations, until he graduated from [[Orem High School]] in 1962.

==Early adulthood==
Lee attended [[Brigham Young University]], where he earned a [[bachelor's degree]] and later a [[doctorate]] in Educational Administration, and [[Utah State University]], where he completed a [[master's degree|master's]] degree.&lt;ref name=Ensign/&gt; In [[Arizona]], Lee taught at the [[Rough Rock Community School|Rough Rock Demonstration School]] and later served as president of the [[Ganado, Arizona|Ganado]] campus of [[Diné College]]. Lee married Katherine Hettich and they became the parents of seven children.

==Church service==
After graduating from high school, Lee served as a [[Mormon missionary|missionary]] for the LDS Church to the [[Navajo Nation]], known then as the "Southwest Indian [[Mission (LDS Church)|Mission]]".

Prior to his call as an LDS [[general authority]], Lee held a number of [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] leadership callings, including [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|elders quorum president]], [[branch president]], [[district president]], and [[Mission president|president]] of the Arizona [[Holbrook, Arizona|Holbrook]] [[Mission (LDS Church)|Mission]].

On October 3, 1975, LDS Church [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]] [[Spencer W. Kimball]] called the 32-year-old Lee to be a member of the [[Seventy (LDS Church)|First Quorum of the Seventy]], a position with church-wide responsibilities. He was the first Native American [[general authority]] in church history.

==Excommunication and criminal conviction==
On September 1, 1989, the Church announced that Lee had been [[excommunication|excommunicated]] for "[[apostasy]] and other conduct unbecoming a member of the Church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disciplinary action taken Sept. 1 against general authority|url=http://199.104.95.22/articles/19067/Disciplinary-action-taken-Sept-1-against-general-authority.html|accessdate=28 July 2014|agency=LDS Church News|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |date=9 September 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first [[general authority]] to be excommunicated since 1943,&lt;ref name = nytimes&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/03/us/mormons-oust-first-indian-in-the-hierarchy.html "Mormons Oust First Indian in the Hierarchy"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1989-09-03.&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[Richard R. Lyman]] was excommunicated for [[adultery]] and unlawful cohabitation.&lt;ref name = sltrib/&gt;

According to Lee, the action stemmed from his disagreement with LDS Church [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]] [[Ezra Taft Benson]] over the role of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the church. When he became church president, Benson had ended the church's [[Indian Placement Program]], which Lee cited as a key to his personal development. Lee argued that Benson was not treating [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Latter-day Saints]] in the way that [[Spencer W. Kimball|Kimball]] would have approved. Additionally, Lee claimed the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] had accused him of [[plural marriage|polygamy]], immorality and teaching false doctrine. Lee provided copies of letters he had written to leaders of the LDS Church to the news media.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Press coverage of Lee's Excommunication Ambivalent |url= https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/issues/072.pdf |journal= [[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]] |date=August 1989 |pages= 47–49 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= [https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/issues/072.pdf The Lee Letters]  |journal= Sunstone |date=August 1989 |pages= 50–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church did not publicly respond to Lee's letters or his public comments; it is the policy of the church not to publicize the details of an excommunicant's behavior which brought about the disciplinary action.

In 1993, the ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'' reported that Lee had attempted to [[child sexual abuse|sexually molest]] a minor girl in 1989, and that this was one of the reasons for Lee's excommunication. Initially, Lee denied the charges; however, on October 12, 1994, the ''Tribune'' reported:

{{quote|A year ago, former Mormon general authority George P. Lee proclaimed he was 'innocent before God' of sexually molesting a 12-year-old neighbor girl.

But Tuesday before a 3rd District judge, Lee humbly hung his head and admitted to touching the girl's breasts for sexual gratification ...

Lee, 51, pleaded guilty to attempted sexual abuse of a child, a third-degree [[felony]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'', 1994-10-12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On July 27, 2007, Lee was arrested in [[Washington County, Utah]], for failing to [[Sex offender registries in the United States|register as a sex offender]] in the state of [[Utah]].&lt;ref name = Spectrum&gt;St. George ''Spectrum'', 29 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Palmer, [http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695196389,00.html "Ex-LDS official arrested in sex-registry probe"], ''[[Deseret Morning News]]'', 2007-07-31, p. B5.&lt;/ref&gt; The police reported that Lee had not [[sex offender registry|registered]] since 2001 and that he had been "living in an area with several young children in close proximity."&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Coots, [http://washeriff.org/phpweb/index.php?module=announce&amp;ANN_user_op=view&amp;ANN_id=92 "New Sex Offender Program Nets Fourth Arrest"], 30 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Lee was booked into [[Purgatory Correctional Facility]] in [[Hurricane, Utah]] on $5,000 [[bail]].&lt;ref name = Spectrum/&gt; The case dragged on for many months due to Lee's health issues.  On March 19, 2008 the case was formally dropped&lt;ref&gt;Ben Winslow [http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695262990,00.html "Ex-LDS official's case is dropped by court"], ''[[Deseret Morning News]]'', 2008-03-19, online.&lt;/ref&gt; due to these issues and Lee eventually registered with the sex offender registry. One year later, on March 29, 2009, Lee was removed from Utah's sex offender registry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lapahie.com/George_Patrick_Lee.cfm#NoMore_Sex_Offender "George Patrick Lee"], lapahie.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Lee died in [[Provo, Utah|Provo]], [[Utah]] on July 28, 2010, from "a long battle with physical problems".&lt;ref&gt;Dan Metcalf Jr., [http://www.abc4.com/content/news/state/story/Former-LDS-general-authority-George-P-Lee-passes/5klYVFexmkKtuCn2VcqFug.cspx "Former LDS general authority George P. Lee passes away"], abc4.com, 2010-07-30.&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, Latter-day Saint sociologist [[Armand Mauss]] described Lee as "one of the truly tragic figures in modern Mormon history".&lt;ref name = sltrib/&gt;

}}'''Gustavo Brambila''' (1953 - ) is a Mexican-American winemaker in the [[Napa Valley]].   He was portrayed in the movie ''[[Bottle Shock]]'', although he was not actually involved with the 1976 [[Judgement of Paris (wine)|Judgement of Paris]] blind [[wine tasting]].

==Early life==
He was born in [[Jalisco, Mexico]] in 1953 and moved with his family to [[Rutherford, California|Rutherford]] in the [[Napa Valley]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="app"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wine.appellationamerica.com/wine-review/614/Bottle-Shocked.html|title=Bottle Shocked:  Uncorking the Real Gustavo Brambila|last=Goldfarb|first=Alan|date=August 27, 2008|publisher=Appellation America|accessdate=2009-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Brambila earned a degree in fermentation science at the [[University of California, Davis Department of Viticulture and Enology|University of California, Davis]], one of the first Latinos to do so.&lt;ref name="visimag"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3488/is_1_83/ai_82482104/pg_3?tag=content;col1|title=The changing face of the California wine industry|last=Caputo|first=Tina|date=January 2002|publisher=Bnet.com|accessdate=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1976 he was hired by [[Mike Grgich]] at [[Chateau Montelena]] where he assisted in quality control.  He joined just after the events covered in ''[[Bottle Shock]]''.   Brambila followed Grgich when [[Grgich Hills Cellar]] was created in 1977.  He worked there for 23 years before leaving in 1999 to become the general manager and winemaker at Peju Province Winery.&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taylorfamilyvineyards.com/TFV-%20Winemaker%20Bios.pdf |title=Winemaker Bios: Gustavo Brambila |publisher=Taylor Vinyards |accessdate=2009-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716193603/http://www.taylorfamilyvineyards.com/TFV-%20Winemaker%20Bios.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, he teamed up with Thrace Bromberger to form Gustavo Wine, which was making 3,800 cases in 2004 and 7,000 cases in 2008. &lt;ref name=app/&gt;&lt;ref name=sfgate/&gt;  They produce a mix of  Merlot, Zinfandel, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvignon.  They also own the Napa Wine Merchants cooperative tasting room as well as several thousand acres in the Chiles Valley.&lt;ref name=sfgate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/10/07/WIGJD94HQC1.DTL|title=Labels with roots in Mexico: 13 companies represent a groundswell of Latino winemakers|last=Emert|first=Carol|date=October 7, 2004|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|pages=F-3|accessdate=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilovenapa.com/paulfranson_article.php?articleId=38|title=Mexican families make name in wine business after toiling in the background|last=Franson|first=Paul|date=January 6, 2003|publisher=ilovenapa.com|accessdate=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2002, he has consulted with Taylor Family Vineyards on their [[Cabernet Sauvignon]].&lt;ref name=taylor/&gt;  In 2008, he began crafting private label wines for the Wine Pod, an automated wine presser and fermenter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prxinc.com/winepod_files/WinePod_GT.pdf|title=WinePod Announces Partnership with Napa’s Gustavo Thrace Winery|date=November 7, 2008|publisher=Winepod.com|accessdate=2009-03-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715125132/http://www.prxinc.com/winepod_files/WinePod_GT.pdf|archivedate=July 15, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bottle Shock==
Brambila was portrayed by [[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]] in the 2008 indie film ''[[Bottle Shock]]''.  In the film, the character is directly involved in the 1976 tasting although in reality, he was not.  He worked in the lab on quality control.&lt;ref name="app"/&gt;  Brambila spent time with Rodriguez before filming.&lt;ref name=visimag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visimag.com/exclusive/fb517_bs.htm|title=The Movie: Bottle Shock|last=Sloane|first=Judy|publisher=Visimag.com|accessdate=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Since the film was released, there has been a noticeable increase in business at his winery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freestylereleasing.com/news.htm|title=Indie Film Hit BOTTLE SHOCK" Defies Industry Expectations  &amp; Means Good Business For Wine Country|date=September 17, 2008|publisher=Freestyle Releasing|accessdate=2009-03-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221152506/http://www.freestylereleasing.com/news.htm|archivedate=February 21, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ijahnya Christian''' (born 1957) is an [[Afro-Anguillian]] social activist and noted member of the [[Rastafarian]] community. As a member of the [[pan-African]] and repatriation movements, Christian travels world wide to help preserve the African languages, traditions, and heritage of the [[African diaspora|diaspora]] and encourages study on the history and culture of [[Caribbean]] communities.

==Early life==
Carol Patricia Rey was born in 1957, in [[The Valley, Anguilla|The Valley]] in the [[Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla|British colony of Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla]] to Amethyst and Hugh Rey, a civil servant. Her childhood was spent on each of the three islands of the colony and she graduated from Basseterre High School on [[Saint Kitts|St. Kitts]] in 1976. While she was a teenager, she became interested in the Rastafarian movement, sweeping through the Caribbean after [[Haile Selassie]]'s 1966 visit to the region and [[Bob Marley]]'s music added visibility to the ideology. She joined the movement in 1980, changed her name to Ijahnya Christian, and went on to study social work at the [[University of the West Indies]] in [[Mona, Jamaica]], graduating with a bachelor's degree in 1984.{{sfn|Walicek|2016}} 

==Career==
Returning to Anguilla, Christian began her career as a high school teacher. Simultaneously, she began editing working on two [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] projects. She served as mentor and editor for Lottis Hodge's ''Ning Troubles'' and ''The Dictionary of Anguillian Language''. Lodge's autobiographical work, published in 1988, related the how she overcame the difficulties of her life and the Anguillian Dictionary, published in 1993, was the first work to focus on the linguistic heritage of the island. During the same time frame, Christian was pursuing a master's degree in education at the [[University of Southampton]], in [[Southampton]], England, which she completed in 1991.{{sfn|Walicek|2016}}

Returning to Anguilla, Christian founded the Athlyi Rogers Study Centre. The center, named after the Anguillian writer, [[Robert Athlyi Rogers]] who wrote the ''[[Holy Piby]]'', a text on Rastafari theology, was a [[pan-African]] cultural space. To further her aim of increasing both popular and scholarly attention on Anguillian identity and history, she served as Director of the Department of Youth and Culture from 2004 to 2006. Between 1998 and 2009, she also wrote a regular column for ''The Anguillian'', "Heartically Yours", which discussed cultural and political events on the island.{{sfn|Walicek|2016}}

Christian is a representative for the Caribbean Pan-African Network, speaking on the preservation of language, [[List of Caribbean music genres|Caribbean music]]—including a range from [[Calypso music|Calypso]], [[Chutney Soca]], [[Reggae]] to [[Gospel music|Gospel]]—and heritage.{{sfn|Baldacchino|2011|pp=xxxi, 294}} She was a founding member of the Caribbean Rastafari Organization{{sfn|Walicek|2016}} and became one of the principal organizers of worldwide gatherings of the Rastafari faithful.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=106}} Christian moved to [[Shashamane]], Ethiopia in 2010, to further her work in repatriating the [[African diaspora]] to the mother country, from where she continues her writing and social activism.{{sfn|Walicek|2016}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2014|p=228}} It is her belief that repatriation is protected under the [[United Nations]] principal and laws governing the [[right of return]].{{sfn|MacLeod|2014|p=228}}

'''Josef Allen Hynek''' (May 1, 1910 – April 27, 1986) was an [[United States|American]] [[astronomer]], [[professor]], and [[ufology|ufologist]].&lt;ref name=JAHYNEK&gt;{{cite web| title =The J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies | url=http://www.cufos.org/org.html | accessdate = 2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is perhaps best remembered for his [[UFO]] research. Hynek acted as scientific advisor to UFO studies undertaken by the [[U.S. Air Force]] under three consecutive projects: [[Project Sign]] (1947–1949),  [[Project Grudge]] (1949–1952), and [[Project Blue Book]] (1952–1969).

In later years he conducted his own independent UFO research, developing the [[Close encounter#Hynek's scale|"Close Encounter"]] classification system. He is widely considered{{by whom|date=July 2015}} the father of the concept of scientific analysis both of reports and especially of trace evidence purportedly left by UFOs.&lt;ref&gt;

== Early life ==
[[Image:Allen Hynek Jacques Vallee 1.jpg|thumb|Allen Hynek (left) and [[Jacques Vallée]]]]
Hynek was born in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] to [[Czechs|Czech]] parents. In 1931, Hynek received a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] from the [[University of Chicago]]. In 1935, he completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[astrophysics]] at [[Yerkes Observatory]]. He joined the Department of [[Physics]] and [[Astronomy]] at [[Ohio State University]] in 1936. He specialized in the study of [[stellar evolution]] and in the identification of [[Binary star#Spectroscopic binaries|spectroscopic binary stars]].

==Career==
During [[World War II]], Hynek was a civilian scientist at the [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] [[Applied Physics Laboratory]], where he helped to develop the [[United States Navy]]'s radio [[proximity fuze]].

After the war, Hynek returned to the Department of Physics and Astronomy at [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]], rising to full [[professor]] in 1950. In 1953, Hynek submitted a report on the fluctuations in the brightness and color of starlight and daylight, with an emphasis on daytime observations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/021921.pdf Starlight Fluctuation Studies - The Defense Technical Information Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, he left to join Professor [[Fred Lawrence Whipple|Fred Whipple]], the [[Harvard University|Harvard]] astronomer, at the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]], which had combined with the Harvard Observatory at Harvard. Hynek had the assignment of directing the tracking of an American space satellite, a project for the International Geophysical Year in 1956 and thereafter. In addition to over 200 teams of amateur scientists around the world that were part of [[Operation Moonwatch]], there were also 12 photographic [[Schmidt camera#Baker-Nunn|Baker-Nunn]] stations. A special camera was devised for the task and a prototype was built and tested and then stripped apart again when, on Oct. 4, 1957, the [[Soviet Union]] launched its first satellite, [[Sputnik 1]].

After completing his work on the satellite program, Hynek went back to teaching, taking the position of professor and chairman of the astronomy department at [[Northwestern University]] in 1960.

==Evolution of opinion on UFOs==

===Skepticism===
In response to numerous reports of "flying saucers", the [[United States Air Force]] established [[Project Sign]] in 1948 to examine sightings of unidentified flying objects. Hynek was contacted to act as a scientific consultant to Project Sign. He studied UFO reports and decided whether the phenomena described therein suggested known [[astronomical object]]s.

When Project Sign hired Hynek, he was skeptical of UFO reports. Hynek suspected that they were made by unreliable witnesses, or by persons who had misidentified man-made or natural objects. In 1948, Hynek said that "the whole subject seems utterly ridiculous," and described it as a fad that would soon pass.&lt;ref name="schneidman110"&gt;Schneidman and Daniels, 1987, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first few years of his UFO studies, Hynek could safely be described as a [[debunker]]. He thought that a great many UFOs could be explained as prosaic phenomena misidentified by an observer. In his 1977 book, Hynek admitted that he enjoyed his role as a debunker for the Air Force. He also noted that debunking was what the Air Force expected of him.

=== Change of opinion ===
Hynek's opinions about UFOs began a slow and gradual shift. After examining hundreds of UFO reports over the decades (including some made by credible witnesses, including astronomers, pilots, police officers, and military personnel), Hynek concluded that some reports represented genuine empirical evidence.

Another shift in Hynek's opinions came after conducting an informal poll of his astronomer colleagues in the early 1950s. Among those he queried was [[Clyde Tombaugh]], who discovered the dwarf planet [[Pluto]]. Of 44 astronomers, five (over 11 percent) had seen aerial objects that they could not account for with established, mainstream science.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Most of these astronomers had not widely shared their accounts for fear of ridicule or of damage to their reputations or careers (Tombaugh was an exception, having openly discussed his own UFO sightings){{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. Hynek also noted that this 11% figure was, according to most polls, greater than those in the general public who claimed to have seen UFOs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Furthermore, the astronomers were presumably more knowledgeable about observing and evaluating the skies than the general public, so their observations were arguably more impressive. Hynek was also distressed by what he regarded as the dismissive or arrogant attitude of many mainstream scientists towards UFO reports and witnesses.

Early evidence of the shift in Hynek's opinions appeared in 1953, when Hynek wrote an article for the April 1953 issue of the ''[[Journal of the Optical Society of America]]'' titled "Unusual Aerial Phenomena," which contained what would become perhaps Hynek's best known statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Ridicule is not part of the [[scientific method]], and people should not be taught that it is. The steady flow of reports, often made in concert by ''reliable'' observers, raises questions of scientific obligation and responsibility. Is there ... ''any'' residue that is worthy of scientific attention? Or, if there isn't, does not an obligation exist to say so to the public—not in words of open ridicule but seriously, to keep faith with the trust the public places in science and scientists?&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;{{cite book

|first=Jerome
|title=The UFO Book: Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial
|publisher=Visible Ink
|date=1998
|pages=305
|isbn=1-57859-029-9}} Emphasis in source.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1953, Hynek was an associate member of the [[Robertson Panel]], which concluded that there was nothing anomalous about UFOs, and that a [[public relations]] campaign should be undertaken to debunk the subject and reduce public interest. Hynek would later lament that the Robertson Panel had helped make UFOs a disreputable field of study.

When the UFO reports continued at a steady pace, Hynek devoted some time to studying the reports and determined that some were deeply puzzling, even after considerable study. He once said, "As a scientist I must be mindful of the lessons of the past; all too often it has happened that matters of great value to science were overlooked because the new phenomenon did not fit the accepted scientific outlook of the time."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Schneidman and Daniels, 110&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1985 interview, when asked what caused his change of opinion, Hynek responded, "Two things, really. One was the completely negative and unyielding attitude of the Air Force. They wouldn't give UFOs the chance of existing, even if they were flying up and down the street in broad daylight. Everything had to have an explanation. I began to resent that, even though I basically felt the same way, because I still thought they weren't going about it in the right way. You can't assume that everything is black no matter what. Secondly, the caliber of the witnesses began to trouble me. Quite a few instances were reported by military pilots, for example, and I knew them to be fairly well-trained, so this is when I first began to think that, well, maybe there was something to all this."

Regardless of his own private views, Hynek was, by and large, still echoing the post-Ruppelt line of Project Blue Book: There are no UFOs, and reports can largely be explained as misidentifications.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Hynek remained with Project Sign after it became [[Project Grudge]] (though he was far less involved in Grudge than he had been in Sign). Project Grudge was replaced with [[Project Blue Book]] in early 1952, and Hynek remained as scientific consultant. Air Force Captain [[Edward J. Ruppelt]], Blue Book's first director, held Hynek in high regard: "Dr. Hynek was one of the most impressive scientists I met while working on the UFO project, and I met a good many. He didn't do two things that some of them did: give you the answer before he knew the question; or immediately begin to expound on his accomplishments in the field of science."&lt;ref name="nicap"&gt;{{Cite web

|title=Chapter Three: The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects
|accessdate=2007-08-27
|publisher=[[NICAP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Hynek thought Ruppelt was a capable director who steered Project Blue Book in the right direction, Ruppelt headed Blue Book for only a few years. Hynek has also stated his opinion that after Ruppelt's departure, Project Blue Book was little more than a public relations exercise, further noting that little or no research was undertaken using the scientific method.

=== Turnaround ===
Hynek began occasionally disagreeing publicly with the conclusions of Blue Book. By the early 1960s—after about a decade and a half of study—Clark writes that "Hynek's apparent turnaround on the UFO question was an open secret."&lt;ref name="clark" /&gt; Only after Blue Book was formally dissolved did Hynek speak more openly about his "turnaround".

By his own admission, the soft-spoken Hynek was cautious and conservative by nature. He speculated that his personality was a factor in the Air Force keeping him on as a consultant for over two decades.

Some other ufologists thought that Hynek was being disingenuous or even duplicitous in his turnaround. Physicist [[James E. McDonald]], for example, wrote to Hynek in 1970, castigating him for what McDonald saw as his lapses, and suggesting that, when evaluated by later generations, retired [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] [[Donald Keyhoe|Major Donald E. Keyhoe]] would be regarded as a more objective, honest, and scientific ufologist.&lt;ref name="druffel"&gt;{{Cite book

It was during the late stages of Blue Book in the 1960s that Hynek began speaking openly about his disagreements and disappointments with the Air Force. Among the cases about which he openly dissented with the Air Force were the highly publicized [[Portage County UFO chase]], in which several police officers chased a UFO for half an hour, and the encounter of [[Lonnie Zamora incident|Lonnie Zamora]], a police officer who reported an encounter with a metallic, egg-shaped aircraft near [[Socorro, New Mexico]].

In late March 1966 in Michigan, two days of mass UFO sightings were reported, and received significant publicity. After studying the reports, Hynek offered a provisional hypothesis for some of the sightings: a few of about 100 witnesses had mistaken [[Biogas|swamp gas]] for something more spectacular. At the press conference where he made his announcement, Hynek repeatedly and strenuously stated that swamp gas was a plausible explanation for only a portion of the [[Michigan]] UFO reports, and certainly not for UFO reports in general. But much to his chagrin, Hynek's qualifications of his hypothesis were largely overlooked, and the term ''swamp gas'' was repeated [[ad infinitum]] in relation to UFO reports. The explanation was subject to national derision.

In his reply dated October 7, 1968, to a request for scientific recommendations regarding Blue Book from Colonel [[Raymond Sleeper]], commander of the USAF Foreign Technology Division, Hynek noted that Blue Book suffered from numerous procedural problems and a lack of resources, which rendered its efforts "totally inadequate". Hynek also noted that one wag had bestowed upon Blue Book the epithet of "Society for the Explanation of the Uninvestigated".&lt;ref name="hynek1"&gt;Hynek, 1972, pp. 167-180
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) ==
{{Main|Center for UFO Studies}}
Hynek was the founder and first head of the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS). Founded in 1973 in [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Illinois]] (but now based in Chicago), CUFOS advocates for scientific analysis of UFO cases. CUFOS's extensive archives include valuable files from civilian research groups such as [[NICAP]], one of the most popular and credible UFO research groups of the 1950s and 1960s.

== Speech before the United Nations ==
In November 1978, Hynek presented a statement on UFOs before the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on behalf of himself, [[Jacques Vallée]], and Claude Poher. The speech was prepared and approved by the three authors.&lt;ref name="un"&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://www.ufoevidence.org/documents/doc757.htm
|title=Dr. J. Allen Hynek Speaking at the United Nations, Nov. 27th 1978
|accessdate=2007-08-27
|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their objective was to initiate a centralized, United Nations authority on UFOs.

== UFO origin hypotheses ==
At the [[Mutual UFO Network|MUFON]] annual symposium in 1973, held in [[Akron, Ohio]], Hynek first expressed his doubts regarding the extraterrestrial (formerly ''interplanetary'' or ''intergalactic'') hypothesis, in a speech titled "The Embarrassment of the Riches". He was aware that the number of UFO sightings was much higher than was reflected in the Project Blue Book statistics. "A few good sightings a year, over the world, would bolster the extraterrestrial hypothesis—but many thousands every year? From remote regions of space? And to what purpose? To scare us by stopping cars, and disturbing animals, and puzzling us with their seemingly pointless antics?"&lt;ref name="stringfield1"&gt;Stringfield, 1977, pp. 40–42&lt;/ref&gt;

In a paper presented to the Joint Symposium of the [[AIAA|American Institute of Aeronautics &amp; Astronautics]] in Los Angeles in 1975, he wrote, "If you object, I ask you to explain—quantitatively, not qualitatively—the reported phenomena of materialization and dematerialization, of shape changes, of the noiseless hovering in the Earth's gravitational field, accelerations that—for an appreciable mass—require energy sources far beyond present capabilities—even theoretical capabilities, the well-known and often reported E-M (sc. electro-magnetic interference) effect, the psychic effects on percipients, including purported telepathic communications."&lt;ref name="stringfield2"&gt;Stringfield, 1977, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, at the First [[International UFO Congress]] in Chicago, Hynek presented his thoughts in his speech "What I Really Believe About UFOs". "I do believe", he said, "that the UFO phenomenon as a whole is real, but I do not mean necessarily that it's just one thing. We must ask whether the diversity of observed UFOs ... all spring from the same basic source, as do weather phenomena, which all originate in the atmosphere", or whether they differ "as a rain shower differs from a meteor, which in turn differs from a cosmic-ray shower." We must not ask, Hynek said, simply which hypothesis can explain the most facts, but rather which hypothesis can explain the most puzzling facts.&lt;ref name="fuller2"&gt;Fuller, 1980, pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding hypotheses of extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) and extradimensional intelligence (EDI), Hynek continued, "There is sufficient evidence to defend both". As evidence for the ETI hypothesis, he mentioned the cases involving radar as good evidence of something solid, as well as the cases of physical evidence. Then he turned to defending the EDI hypothesis: in addition to the observations of materialization and dematerialization, he cited the "poltergeist" phenomenon experienced by some people after a close encounter; the photographs of UFOs, sometimes in only one frame, and not seen by witnesses; the changing of form in front of witnesses; the puzzling question of telepathic communication; that in close encounters of the third kind, the creatures seem to be at home in Earth's gravity and atmosphere; the sudden stillness in the presence of the craft; levitation of cars or people; and the development by some of psychic abilities after an encounter. "Do we have two aspects of one phenomenon or two different sets of phenomena?" Hynek asked.&lt;ref name="fuller3"&gt;Fuller, 1980, pp. 157–163&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, he introduced a third hypothesis. "I hold it entirely possible", he said, "that a technology exists, which encompasses both the physical and the psychic, the material and the mental. There are stars that are millions of years older than the sun. There may be a civilization that is millions of years more advanced than man's. We have gone from Kitty Hawk to the moon in some seventy years, but it's possible that a million-year-old civilization may know something that we don't ... I hypothesize an 'M&amp;M' technology encompassing the mental and material realms. The psychic realms, so mysterious to us today, may be an ordinary part of an advanced technology."&lt;ref name="fuller4"&gt;Fuller, 1980, pp. 164–165&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hynek and Vallee's 1975 book ''The Edge of Reality'', Hynek published a [[stereoscopic]] photograph of a UFO he took during a flight. According to the book, the object stayed in sight long enough for Hynek to unpack his camera from his luggage and take two exposures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Oh, the subject has been so ridiculed that I would never report a UFO even if I did see one—not without a witness'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debunker.com/historical/HynekForgetsHisUFO.pdf |title=Close Encounter Still up in Air for UFO Expert|author= Michael Tenszen|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=1982-07-05 |accessdate=2011-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' ==
In his first book, Hynek published the "[[close encounter|Close Encounter]]" scale that he had developed to better catalog UFO reports. Hynek was later a consultant to [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Steven Spielberg]] for the popular 1977 UFO movie ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', named after a level of Hynek's scale. He made a non-speaking cameo appearance in the film&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =The J. Allen Hynek IMDb | url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0405251/ | accessdate = 21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (at the end of the film, after the aliens disembark from the "mother ship", he can be seen, bearded and with pipe in mouth, stepping forward to view the spectacle).

==Personal life==
Hynek and his wife, Miriam (Curtis) had five children.  Hynek's son [[Joel Hynek|Joel]] is an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning visual effects supervisor. He oversaw the design of the [[camouflage]] effect for the movie ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', and won the Best Visual Effects Oscar for his work on ''[[What Dreams May Come]]''.

== Death ==
On April 27, 1986, Hynek died of a malignant [[brain tumor]], at Memorial Hospital in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]].&lt;ref name="northwesternlib"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://findingaids.library.northwestern.edu/catalog/inu-ead-nua-archon-436 | title=J.

'''James Fraser Kasting''' (born  January 2, 1953) is an American [[Earth science|geoscientist]] and Distinguished Professor of Geosciences at [[Penn State University]]. Kasting is active in NASA’s search for habitable [[Exoplanet|extrasolar planets]].&lt;ref name="Ihrenes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="David"&gt;{{cite news|last1=David|first1=Leonard|title=How NASA's Kepler Will Seek Out Strange New Worlds|url=http://www.space.com/2270-nasa-kepler-seek-strange-worlds.html|accessdate=27 May 2016|work=[[Space.com]]|date=March 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered a world leader in the field of [[planetary habitability]], assessing habitable zones around stars.&lt;ref name="Seed"&gt;{{cite news|title=Earth-like Planets Aren’t Rare  10 Questions with...

==Education==
Kasting grew up in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], and credits the nearby [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] and the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo rockets for inspiring his interests in space and science.&lt;ref name="Seed"/&gt;

Kasting received a A.B. from [[Harvard University]] in 1975. He then went to the [[University of Michigan]], where he worked with Tom Donahue,&lt;ref name="Quest"/&gt; receiving his M.S. in physics and atmospheric science in 1978, and his Ph.D. in [[atmospheric science]] in 1979.&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=http://www3.geosc.psu.edu/~jfk4/PersonalPage/Kasting.htm|website=Department of Geosciences|quote="Click 'Vitae' to see Dr. Kasting's CV."|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ihrenes"&gt;{{cite web|title=ISE - Our Team|url=http://www.ihrenesspaceenterprises.com/james-kasting.php|website=Ihrenes Enterprises|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Kasting worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and at [[NASA]] [[Ames Research Center]] before accepting a position with the space science division at NASA Ames. He has served NASA in various capacities, including as a member of the scientific working group for the [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]]. Kasting joined [[Penn State University]] in 1988, but continues to collaborate with NASA.&lt;ref name="Quest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pugh"&gt;{{cite news|title=Three Penn State faculty members awarded Evan Pugh Professorships|url=http://news.psu.edu/story/149395/2012/04/26/academics/three-penn-state-faculty-members-awarded-evan-pugh-professorships|accessdate=27 May 2016|work=Penn State News|date=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is interested in atmospheric evolution, planetary atmospheres and paleoclimates.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; Kasting writes about the [[geophysical]] history and status of the [[Earth]], with a focus on atmospherics. According to Kasting's calculations, the [[Future of the Earth#Loss of oceans|Earth's oceans will evaporate in about a billion years]], while the Sun is still a main sequence star.

'''Jean-Joseph Rive''' (19 May 1730&lt;ref name="DicoJourn"&gt;[http://dictionnaire-journalistes.gazettes18e.fr/journaliste/692-jean-joseph-rive Dictionnaire des journalistes (1600-1789)]&lt;/ref&gt; – 20 October 1791&lt;ref name="DicoJourn" /&gt;) was an 18th-century French bibliographer, librarian and revolutionary leader.

== Biography ==
The son of a goldsmith, abbot Rive was gifted with a vast memory, a penetrating mind and the immense erudition that can give an infinite reading. He began to raise his literary treasures barely fourteen years old. After embracing the ecclesiastical state, he first taught philosophy at St. Charles College of [[Avignon]].

He then resigned in 1767 the cure of [[Mollégès]]&lt;ref name="DicoJourn" /&gt; which he had been provided, and came to live in Paris. The following year he became librarian of the [[Louis César de La Baume Le Blanc|Duke de la Valliere]],&lt;ref name="DicoJourn" /&gt; a position he held until the death of the Duke in 1780, who bequeathed him 6000 pounds. Although he increased the library which he had charge of with large number of rare and valuable books, he did not participate in drafting the catalog of the collection&lt;ref name="DicoJourn" /&gt; for the duchess of Châtillon, heir to the Duke of La Valliere commissioned Debure and Vanpraet to catalog the rare books of the library. This preference offended Rive who revenged himself by bitter criticisms against the two scientists. His pride and his irascible and annoying nature quarreled with those caring like him of bibliography, and whom he stigmatized with insulting epithets, to the point that his career was punctuated by continual disputes and debates, even if he was said to have been, in his interior, good parent and friend, and excellent master.&lt;ref&gt;In his ''Dictionnaire raisonné de Bibliographie'', [[Gabriel Peignot]] wrote about him that "He might have been entitled to the rank of first bibliographer of his time, had his pride and his penchant for satire not tarnished his glory. "&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Marquis de Méjanes bequeathed a considerable library to the {{Interlanguage link multi|États de Provence|fr}}, the [[Jean de Dieu-Raymond de Boisgelin de Cucé|archbishop of Aix]] proposed, on behalf of his fellow Provençaux, that abbot Rive be the librarian of the [[bibliothèque Méjanes]]. Rive accepted this post, but his exorbitant claims gave rise to endless disputes, that his presence at Aix, where he had returned, made even more difficult to close. Meanwhile, the [[French Revolution|Révolution]] broke out and put an end to this project.&lt;ref name="DicoJourn" /&gt;

Abbot Rive then founded in the Provençal capital, the faction of the Frères Anti-Politiques (Anti-Political Brethren), gathering little people who were sowing terror. Their misdeeds lead to the {{Interlanguage link multi|Émeutes de décembre 1790 à Aix-en-Provence|fr|3=Émeutes de décembre 1790 à Aix-en-Provence|lt=riots of December 1790 in Aix-en-Provence}} in which was notably murdered lawyer {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean Pierre Joseph Pascalis|fr}}, of which Rive was even accused of causing death. No one knows where he would have stopped had he not died in 1792 of a stroke at age 62.

'''Sir John Kenneth Tavener''' (28 January 1944 – 12 November 2013) was an English composer, known for his extensive output of religious works, including ''[[The Protecting Veil]]'', ''[[Song for Athene]]'' and ''[[The Lamb (Tavener)|The Lamb]]''.

Tavener first came to prominence with his cantata ''[[The Whale (Tavener)|The Whale]]'', premiered in 1968. Then aged 24, he was described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as "the musical discovery of the year",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Meirion Bowen|title=Two Tavener Works at the Queen Elizabeth Hall |url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/12/john-tavener-guardian-review|work=[[The Guardian]]| origyear=13 June 1968 |date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[The Times]]'' said he was "among the very best creative talents of his generation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockian.biz/linn/ckd378.htm Linn Records: "Carmina Celtica: Canty"]&lt;/ref&gt; During his career he became one of the best known and popular composers of his generation, most particularly for ''The Protecting Veil'', which as recorded by cellist [[Steven Isserlis]] became a bestselling album, and ''Song for Athene'' which was sung at the [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales|funeral of Princess Diana]].&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; ''The Lamb'' featured in the soundtrack for [[Paolo Sorrentino]]'s film ''[[The Great Beauty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://janusfilms.com/thegreatbeauty/ |title=Janus Films presents The Great Beauty (La Grande Bellezza) |publisher=Janusfilms.com |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tavener was [[British honours system|knight]]ed in 2000 for his services to music and won an [[Ivor Novello Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/gadgets_and_gaming/article6991720.ece|title=Not just a blip: Ivor Novello awards to recognise computer game music |author=Adam Sherwin|date=18 January 2010|work=The Times|accessdate=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tavener became a music scholar at [[Highgate School]] (where a fellow pupil was [[John Rutter]]).&lt;ref name=White2013p29/&gt; The school choir was often employed by the BBC in works requiring boys' voices, so Tavener gained choral experience singing in Mahler's [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Third Symphony]] and Orff's ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]''.&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt; He started to compose at Highgate, and also became a sufficiently proficient pianist to perform the second and third movements of Beethoven's [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Fourth Piano Concerto]] and, in 1961 with the [[National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain|National Youth Orchestra]], Shostakovich's [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Shostakovich)|Piano Concerto No. 2]].&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt; He also became organist and choirmaster in 1961 at St John's Presbyterian Church, Kensington (now St Mark's [[Coptic Orthodox]] Church),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stmark.org.uk/history/pre-1975-st-johns-presbyterian-church |title=Our History (Pre-1975) |publisher=Stmark.org.uk |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; a post he held for 14 years.&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt;&lt;!-- the St Mark's website says "appointed in 1952" which is obviously wrong, as he was only 8 years old then --&gt;

Tavener entered the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in 1962, where his tutors included Sir [[Lennox Berkeley]].&lt;ref name=Guardianobit&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael J Stewart|title=Sir John Tavener obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/12/john-tavener|work=The Guardian| date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt; During his studies there he decided to give up the piano and devote himself to composition.&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt;

==''The Whale'' and early career==
Tavener first came to prominence in 1968 with his dramatic cantata ''The Whale'', based on the Old Testament story of [[Book of Jonah|Jonah]].&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; It was premièred at the [[London Sinfonietta]]'s début concert,&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; which was also the opening concert of the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael White, "A Time for Reflection", ''[[BBC Music Magazine]]'', Vol. 22 No. 2 (December 2013), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Tavener's younger brother, Roger, was then doing some building work on [[Ringo Starr]]'s home and, gaining the musician's interest, persuaded [[the Beatles]] to have ''The Whale'' recorded by [[Apple Records]] and released in 1970.&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; The following year Tavener began teaching at [[Trinity College of Music]], London.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Other works by Tavener released by Apple included his ''[[A Celtic Requiem]]'', which impressed [[Benjamin Britten]] enough to persuade [[Covent Garden]] to commission an opera from Tavener:&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; the ultimate result, to a libretto by playwright [[Gerard McLarnon]], was ''Thérèse''. When staged in 1979 the opera was thought too static to be a successful drama.&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt;

Tavener had also been deeply affected by his brief 1974 marriage to the Greek dancer Victoria Maragopoulou.&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt; His chamber opera ''A Gentle Spirit'' (1977), with a libretto by McLarnon based on a story by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], concerns a pawnbroker whose marriage fails to the extent that his wife commits suicide. It has been deemed "far superior to ''Thérèse'', with the internal drama more suited to the stage".&lt;ref name= Guardianobit/&gt; Significantly, it also touched on [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]], to which McLarnon had been a convert for several years.&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt;

==Conversion to Orthodox Christianity==
Tavener converted to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1977.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2015}}&lt;!--Ivan Moody's NG article does not specify whether the Orthodox Church to which Tavener converted was Russian, Greek, or some other variety.--&gt; Orthodox theology and liturgical traditions became a major influence on his work. He was particularly drawn to its [[mysticism]], studying and setting to music the writings of [[Church Fathers]] and completing a setting of the [[Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom]], the principal eucharistic liturgy of the Orthodox Church: this was Tavener's first directly Orthodox-inspired music.&lt;ref name=nprobit&gt;{{cite news|author=Anastasia Tsioulcas|title=Remembering 'Holy Minimalist' Composer John Tavener |url= https://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2013/11/12/244788638/remembering-holy-minimalist-composer-john-tavener|work=[[NPR Music]]| date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
[[File:William Blake - Songs of Innocence and Experience - The Lamb.jpg|thumb|200px| John Tavener's choral arrangement of [[William Blake]]'s "[[The Lamb]]" from his collection ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'' is a continually popular work. This image represents copy C, object 8 of that original poem, currently held by the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=songsie.c.illbk.09&amp;java=no| title = Songs of Innocence and of Experience, copy C, object 9 (Bentley 8, Erdman 8, Keynes 8) "The Lamb"| publisher = [[William Blake Archive]]| editors = Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi| accessdate = 26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Tavener's subsequent explorations of Russian and Greek culture resulted in ''Akhmatova Requiem'': this failed to enjoy success either at its Edinburgh Festival premiere in 1981, or at its [[The Proms|Proms]]' performance the following week where many of the audience left before it finished.&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt; Of more lasting success was Tavener's short unaccompanied four-part choral setting of [[William Blake]]'s poem "[[The Lamb]]", written one afternoon in 1982 for his nephew Simon's third birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicsalesclassical.com/composer/work/11167 |title=John Tavener - The Lamb (1982) |publisher=Music Sales Classical |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This simple [[homophonic]] piece is usually performed as a [[Christmas carol]]. Later prominent works include ''The Akathist of Thanksgiving'' of 1987, written in celebration of the millennium of the Russian Orthodox Church; ''The Protecting Veil'', first performed by cellist Steven Isserlis and the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] at the 1989 Proms; and ''Song for Athene'' (1993). The two choral works were settings of texts by [[Mother Thekla]], a Russian Orthodox abbess who was Tavener's long-time spiritual adviser until her death in 2011.&lt;ref name=nprobit/&gt; ''Song for Athene'' in particular gained worldwide exposure when performed at the [[funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt;

Tavener's ''Fall and Resurrection'', first performed in 2000, used instruments such as [[Shofar|ram's horn]], [[Ney|ney flute]] and [[kaval]]. It was dedicated to the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]], with whom Tavener formed a lasting friendship.&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; In 2003 Tavener composed the exceptionally large work ''[[The Veil of the Temple]]'' (which was premièred at the [[Temple Church]], London), based on texts from a number of religions. Identified by Tavener as "the supreme achievement of my life",&lt;ref name=nprobit/&gt; it is set for four choirs, several orchestras and soloists and lasts at least seven hours.&lt;ref name=White2013p29/&gt; ''Prayer of the Heart'', written for and performed by [[Björk]], was premiered in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=John Tavener, composer and seeker, dies at 69 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/11/12/john-tavener-composer-and-seeker-dies-at-69/3508339/|work=[[USA Today]]| date=12 November 2013 |accessdate= 14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Tavener composed ''The Beautiful Names'', a setting of the 99 names of God in the Muslim tradition, sung in [[Arabic]].&lt;ref name=nprobit/&gt;

It had been reported, particularly in the British press, that Tavener left [[Orthodox Christianity]] to explore a number of other different religious traditions, including [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]], and became a follower of the [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalist]] philosopher [[Frithjof Schuon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Morrison|title=99 Names for God: John Tavener Turns his Back on Orthodoxy|publisher=BBC Music|date=November 2004}}: p. 30.

The interviewer also reported at the time that he "hasn’t abandoned Orthodoxy. He remains devotedly Christian."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/17/arts/music/17whit.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;ref=music&amp;pagewanted=print&amp; |title=Christian Composer, Inspired by Allah's 99 Names |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking on the [[BBC Four]] television programme ''Sacred Music'' in 2010, Tavener described himself as "essentially Orthodox".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00rs3w2 ''Sacred Music''], series 2, episode 4, broadcast in the UK on [[BBC Four]] on 2 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He reiterated both his desire to explore the musical traditions of other religions, and his adherence to the Orthodox Christian faith, on ''[[Start the Week]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006r9xr |title=BBC Radio 4 - Start the Week |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded only days before his death and broadcast on 11&amp;nbsp;November 2013.

==Music==
[[John Rutter]] describes Tavener as having the "very rare gift" of being able to "bring an audience to a deep silence."&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; According to Steven Isserlis, "he had his own voice. He wasn't writing to be popular – he was writing the music he had to write."&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

===Style and development===
While Tavener's earliest music was influenced by [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Olivier Messiaen]] – often invoking the sound world of Stravinsky, in particular ''Canticum Sacrum'',&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; and the ecstatic quality found in various works by Messiaen – his later music became more sparse, using wide [[Register (music)|registral space]] and was usually [[diatonic]]ally [[Tonality|tonal]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Tavener recognised [[Arvo Pärt]] as "a kindred spirit" and shared with him a common religious tradition and a fondness for textural transparency.&lt;ref name=White2013p29&gt;Michael White, "A Time for Reflection", [[BBC Music Magazine]], Vol. 22 No. 2 (December 2013): p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Peters Ringo''' (May 3, 1850 – July 13, 1882)—known as '''Johnny Ringo'''—was an American [[American frontier|Old West]] outlaw loosely associated with the [[Cochise County Cowboys]] in frontier [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]],  [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise County]], [[Arizona Territory]], United States. He took part in the [[Mason County War]] during which he committed his first murder. He was arrested and charged with murder, but escaped from jail. He was affiliated with Cochise County Sheriff [[Johnny Behan]], [[Ike Clanton]], and [[Frank Stilwell]] during 1881–1882. He got into a confrontation in Tombstone with [[Doc Holliday]] and was suspected by [[Wyatt Earp]] of having taken part in the attempted murder of [[Virgil Earp]] and the ambush and death of [[Morgan Earp]]. Ringo was found dead with a bullet wound to his temple. Modern writers have advanced various theories attributing his death to Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, Frank Leslie, and Michael O'Rourke.

== Early life ==
Johnny Ringo was born in [[Greens Fork, Indiana]], of distant [[Dutch people|Dutch]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehighchaparral.com/historic6.htm |title=The High Chaparral Johnny Ringo |publisher=Thehighchaparral.com |access-date=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family moved to [[Liberty, Missouri]] in 1856. He was a loosely related cousin to the [[James–Younger Gang|Younger brothers]] through his aunt Augusta Peters Inskip, who married Coleman P. Younger, uncle of the outlaws.&lt;ref name="dch"&gt;{{cite web |work=Gallatin North Missourian |url=http://www.daviesscountyhistoricalsociety.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=123&amp;mode=mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929155029/http://www.daviesscountyhistoricalsociety.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=123&amp;mode=mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0 |archive-date=2007-09-29 |title=Johnny Ringo Called Gallatin Home as a Boy |date=1992-07-22 |first=Darryl |last=Wilkinson |deadurl=yes |access-date=15 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1858, his family moved to [[Gallatin, Missouri]] where they rented property from the father of John W. Sheets (who became the first "official" victim of the [[James-Younger gang]] when they robbed the Daviess County Savings &amp; Loan Association in 1869).&lt;ref name="dch"/&gt;

On July 30, 1864, when Johnny was 14, his family was in [[Wyoming]] en route to [[California]]. His father Martin Ringo was killed when he stepped off their wagon holding a shotgun which accidentally discharged. The buckshot entered the right side of Martin's face and exited the top of his head. The family buried Martin on a hillside alongside the trail.&lt;ref name="cgc"&gt;{{cite web |work=Tombstone History |title=John Ringo Family History |url=http://clantongang.com/oldwest/ganringo.html |first=Terry |last=Clanton |year=1997 |access-date=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mason County War ==
{{main|Mason County War}}
By the mid-1870s, Ringo had migrated from [[San Jose, California]], to [[Mason County, Texas]]. Here he befriended an ex-[[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] named Scott Cooley, who was the adopted son of a local rancher named Tim Williamson.

Trouble started when two American [[rustler]]s, Elijah and Pete Backus, were dragged from the Mason jail and [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] by a predominantly German mob. Full-blown war began on May 13, 1875, when Tim Williamson was arrested by a hostile posse and murdered by a German farmer named [[Peter Bader|Peter “bad man” Bader]]. Cooley and his friends, including Johnny Ringo, conducted a terror campaign against their rivals. Officials called it the "[[Mason County War]]"; locally it was called the "Hoodoo War".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.texfiles.com/texashistory/hoodoowar.htm |title=The Mason County Texas Hoo Doo Wars |work=Texas History |first=Glenn |last=Hadeler}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooley retaliated by killing the local German ex-deputy sheriff, John Worley, shooting him, [[scalping]] him, and tossing his body down a well on August 10, 1875.

Cooley already had a reputation as a dangerous man, and was respected as a Texas Ranger. He killed several others during the "war". After Cooley supporter [[Moses Baird]] was killed, Ringo committed his first murder on September 25, 1875, when he and a friend named Bill Williams rode up in front of the house of James Cheyney, the man who led Baird into the ambush. Cheyney came out unarmed, invited them in, and began washing his face on the porch, when both Ringo and Williams shot and killed him. The two then rode to the house of Dave Doole and called him outside, but he came out with a gun so they fled back into town.

Some time later, Scott Cooley and Johnny Ringo mistook Charley Bader for his brother Pete and killed him. After that, both men were jailed in [[Burnet, Texas]] by [[Sheriff]] A. J. Strickland. Both Ringo and Cooley were broken out of jail by their friends shortly thereafter, and parted company to evade the law.

By November 1876, the Mason County War had petered out after about a dozen individuals had been killed. Scott Cooley was thought to be dead, and Johnny Ringo and his pal George Gladden were locked up once again. One of Ringo's alleged cellmates was the notorious killer [[John Wesley Hardin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote=Hardin Biography p. 124 claimed to have been cellmates with Ringo in September 1878. However Ringo was acquitted in May 1877! |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fri51 |title=Handbook of Texas bio |access-date=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Gladden was sentenced to 99 years, Ringo appears to have been [[acquittal|acquitted]]. Two years later, Ringo was a constable in [[Loyal Valley, Texas]]. Soon after this, he traveled to Arizona for the first time.

== Life in Tombstone ==
Ringo first appeared in [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise County]], [[Arizona Territory]] in 1879 with [[Joseph Graves Olney]] (alias "Joe Hill"), a friend from the Mason County War. In December 1879, a drunk Ringo shot unarmed Louis Hancock in a [[Safford, Arizona]] saloon when Hancock refused a complimentary drink of whiskey, stating that he preferred beer. Hancock survived his wound. In [[Tombstone, Arizona]], Ringo had a reputation as having a bad temper. He may have participated in robberies and killings with the [[Cochise County Cowboys]], a loosely associated group of outlaws. He was occasionally erroneously referred to as "Ringgold" by local newspapers.&lt;ref name=roberts&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Roberts | first1 = Gary L. | title = Doc Holliday: The Life and Legend | year = 2007 | publisher = Wiley, J | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-470-12822-0 | page = 544 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|238}}

=== Confrontation with Doc Holliday ===
On January 17, 1882, Ringo and [[Doc Holliday]] traded threats and seemed to be headed into a gunfight. Both men were arrested by Tombstone's chief of police, James Flynn, and hauled before a judge for carrying weapons in town. Both were fined. Judge William H. Stilwell followed up on charges outstanding against Ringo for a robbery in Galeyville and Ringo was re-arrested and jailed on January 20 for the weekend.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts (2007), p. 548&lt;/ref&gt;  Ringo was suspected by the Earps of taking part in the December 28, 1881, ambush of Virgil Earp, that crippled him for life, and the March 18, 1882, murder of [[Morgan Earp]] while he was shooting pool in a Tombstone saloon.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts (2007), pp. 551-2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Joins posse pursuing Earps ===
Deputy U.S. Marshal [[Wyatt Earp]] and his posse killed [[Frank Stilwell]] in Tucson on March 20, 1882. After the shooting, the Earps and a federal posse set out on a [[Earp Vendetta Ride|vendetta]] to find and kill the others they held responsible for ambushing Virgil and Morgan. Cochise County Sheriff [[Johnny Behan]] received warrants from a Tucson judge for arrest of the Earps and Holliday and deputized Ringo and 19 other men, many of them friends of Stilwell and the Cochise County Cowboys. The county posse pursued but never found the Earps' posse.&lt;ref name="historynet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/wyatt-earps-vendetta-posse.htm |title=Wyatt Earp's Vendetta Posse |date=January 29, 2007 |publisher=HistoryNet.com |accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="legends"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-earpvendetta.html |title=Earp Vendetta Ride |publisher=Legends of America |accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Earp Vendetta Ride, Wyatt Earp killed one of Ringo's closest friends, [[William Brocius|"Curly Bill" Brocius]], in a gunfight at [[Iron Springs (Cochise County, Arizona)|Iron Springs]] (later Mescal Springs) about {{convert|20|mi}} from Tombstone. Earp told his biographer, Stuart Lake, that Cruz confessed to being the lookout at Morgan's murder, and identified Ringo, Stilwell, Swilling, and Brocius as Morgan's killers,&lt;ref&gt;Lake, S. ''Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal''. Houghton Mifflin (1931), p. 277. ASIN B00085IQ0I&lt;/ref&gt; though modern researchers have cast doubt on Earp's account.&lt;ref name="historynet"/&gt;

== Death ==
[[File:RingoJohn Grave.jpg|thumb|400px|Memorial Plaque and Grave of Johnny Ringo]]
On July 14, 1882, Ringo's body was found lying against the trunk of a large tree in West Turkey Creek Valley, near [[Chiricahua Peak]] in Arizona Territory. A neighboring property owner heard a single gunshot on the afternoon of July 13 and discovered Ringo's body the following day. His feet were wrapped in strips of cloth torn from his undershirt, probably because his horse had gotten loose from its picket and bolted with his boots tied to the saddle—a method commonly used at that time to keep [[scorpion]]s out of them. There was a bullet hole in his right temple and an exit wound at the back of his head. His revolver had one round expended and was found hanging by one finger in his hand. His horse was found two miles away with his boots still tied to the saddle. A coroner's [[inquest]] officially ruled his death a [[suicide]].&lt;ref name = "thewildwest"&gt;[http://www.thewildwest.org/cowboys/wildwestoutlawsandlawmen/186-wildwestoutlawjohnringo John Ringo] at thewildwest.org, retrieved October 4, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ringo's body is buried near the base of the tree where it was discovered. The grave is located on private land and permission is needed to visit the site.&lt;ref name = "thewildwest"/&gt; Despite the coroner's ruling, and contemporaneous newspaper reports that "[Ringo had] frequently threatened to commit suicide, and that the event was expected at any time",&lt;ref&gt;''The Tombstone Epitaph'', July 18, 1882&lt;/ref&gt; alternative theories about Ringo's cause of death, of varying plausibility, have been proposed over the years by researchers and amateur enthusiasts.

=== Wyatt Earp theory ===
According to the book ''[[I Married Wyatt Earp]]'', which author and collector Glen Boyer claimed to have assembled from manuscripts written by Earp's third wife, [[Josephine Earp|Josephine Marcus Earp]], Earp and Doc Holliday returned to Arizona with some friends in early July and found Ringo camped in West Turkey Creek Valley. As Ringo attempted to flee up the canyon, Earp shot him with a rifle.&lt;ref name=ortega29may/&gt;  Boyer refused to produce his source manuscripts, and reporters wrote that his explanations were conflicting and not credible. ''New York Times'' contributor [[Allen Barra]] wrote that ''I Married Wyatt Earp'' "...is now recognized by Earp researchers as a hoax."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lubet |first=Steven |title=Murder in Tombstone: The Forgotten Trial of Wyatt Earp |year=2006 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn. |isbn=978-0-300-11527-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|154}}&lt;ref name=ortega29may&gt;{{cite web|last=Ortega|first=Tony |title=I Married Wyatt Earp |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1999-03-04/news/i-varied-wyatt-earp/|publisher=Phoenix New Times|accessdate=29 May 2011|date=March 4, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Tombstone historian Ben T. Traywick considers the Earp theory the most credible, as only Earp had sufficient motive, he was probably in the area at the time, and near the end of his life, reportedly told one historian "in circumstantial detail how he killed John Ringo".&lt;ref&gt;Lockwood, F. ''Pioneer Days in Arizona''. MacMillan (1932), p. 224. ASIN: B00085XW16&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with a reporter in Denver in 1896, Earp denied that he had killed Johnny Ringo.&lt;ref name=gattoringo&gt;{{cite web|last=Gatto|first=Steve|title=Johnny Ringo - The Death of Johnny Ringo|url=http://www.johnnyringo.com/jrdeath.html|accessdate=April 16, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406002032/http://www.johnnyringo.com/jrdeath.html|archivedate=April 6, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then flipped his story, claiming he had killed Ringo. In 1888, he was interviewed by an agent of California historian [[Hubert Howe Bancroft|Hubert H. Bancroft]],&lt;ref name=gattoringo/&gt; and then Frank Lockwood, who wrote ''Pioneer Days in Arizona'' in 1932'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Arizona Vendetta|url=http://tombstonehistory.tripod.com/fhmsin.html|format=manuscript|year=c. 1918|accessdate=April 16, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831071433/http://tombstonehistory.tripod.com/fhmsin.html|archivedate=August 31, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told them that he killed Johnny Ringo as he left Arizona in 1882. However, Earp included details that do not match what is known about Ringo's death. Earp repeated that claim to at least three other people.

=== Doc Holliday theory ===
The Holliday theory is similar to the Earp theory, except that Holliday is alleged to have killed Ringo.&lt;ref name=tanner&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holliday Tanner |first1=Karen |first2= Robert K. |last2=Dearment |title=Doc Holliday: a Family Portrait |year=2001 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |location=Norman |isbn=978-0-8061-3320-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variant, popularized in the movie ''Tombstone'', holds that Holliday stepped in for Earp in response to a gunfight challenge from Ringo and shot him.&lt;ref name=ortega29may/&gt; Records of the [[Pueblo County, Colorado]] District Court (located in [[Pueblo, Colorado]]) indicate that Holliday and his attorney appeared in court on July 11, 14, and 18, 1882 to answer charges of "larceny". However, a [[Capias ad respondendum|writ of capias]] was issued for him on the 11th, suggesting that he did not in fact appear in court on that date. Ringo's body was found on the 14th. Six days before Ringo's death, the ''Pueblo Daily Chieftain'' reported that Holliday was in [[Salida, Colorado]], about {{convert|670|mi}} from Turkey Creek, Arizona; and then in [[Leadville, Colorado|Leadville]], about {{convert|700|mi}} distant, on July 18.&lt;ref&gt;''Pueblo Daily Chieftain'', July 19, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;  There was still an arrest warrant outstanding on Holliday in Arizona for his part in Frank Stilwell's murder, making it unlikely that he would have entered Arizona at that time.&lt;ref name=tanner/&gt;{{rp|295–5}}

=== Michael O'Rourke theory ===
Some accounts attribute Ringo's death to [[Michael O'Rourke (gambler)|Michael O'Rourke]], an itinerant gambler who was arrested in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in January 1881 on suspicion of murdering a mining engineer named Henry Schneider. Wyatt Earp is said to have protected him from being lynched by a mob organized and led by Ringo. O'Rourke escaped from jail in April 1881 and never stood trial on the murder charges.&lt;ref name="bell"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bell|first1=Bob Boze|title=Gunfight at the Stilwell Corral|url=http://www.truewestmagazine.com/gunfight-at-the-stilwell-corral/|accessdate=24 March 2015|date=March 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last documented sighting of O'Rourke was in the [[Dragoon Mountains]] near Tombstone during May 1881, "well-mounted and equipped", and presumably on his way out of the territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tombstonehistory.tripod.com/weresign.html The Johnny Behind the Deuce Affair] tombstone history.com, retrieved October 7, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; From then on he is referenced only in unsubstantiated rumors and legends; according to one, a combination of the debt he owed Earp and the grudge he held against Ringo prompted him to return to Arizona in 1882, track Ringo down, and kill him. While some sources consider the story plausible,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wyattearp.net/duece.html "The Johnny Behind The Deuce Affair] at wyattearp.net, retrieved October 6, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; others point out that O'Rourke, like Holliday, would have been reluctant to re-enter Arizona with a murder warrant hanging over his head—particularly to commit another murder.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, GM. ''Keeping the Peace: Tales from the Old West''. Booklocker (2012), p. 123. {{ISBN|1614349029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Arizona ''Daily Star'', January 26, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Frank Leslie theory ===
A theory popular in the years immediately following Ringo's death named [[Franklin Leslie|"Buckskin" Frank Leslie]] as his killer.&lt;ref name = "death"/&gt;  Leslie apparently did tell a guard at the [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]] prison, where he was serving time for killing his wife, that he had shot Ringo.  While many believed his story, others thought he was simply claiming credit for it to curry favor with Earp's inner circle, or for whatever notoriety it might bring him. In a popular but unsubstantiated story, [[Billy Claiborne]]'s last words, after losing a gunfight to Leslie in November 1882, were, "Frank Leslie killed John Ringo. I saw him do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bell|first1=Bob Boze|title=Wyatt Earp vs. the Tombstone Mob|url=http://www.truewestmagazine.com/wyatt-earp-vs-tombstone-mob/|accessdate=October 6, 2016|date=March 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "death"&gt;[http://www.johnnyringo.com/jrdeath.html The Death of Johnny Ringo] at johnnyringo.com, retrieved October 6, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Kevin Elijah Burgess was born in St. Petersburg, Florida on July 21, 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amazing birthday by way of my lovely wife! |url=https://twitter.com/KB_HGA/status/491445999651815424|publisher=Twitter|author=KB official twitter account|accessdate=February 8, 2015|date=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  into a military family.&lt;ref name=behindthemusic&gt;{{cite web|title=KB – Weight &amp; Glory Behind the Music and More (@kb_hga @reachrecords)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt69Gzf2IZM&amp;feature=plcp|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=July 23, 2012|author=Reach Records|format=Video/Web|date=July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after his birth his parents moved to [[Southern Illinois]] where he was raised for eight years. When he was 8 years old, his parents divorced and he moved back with his mother to the south-side of St. Petersburg, which according to Burgess is "probably one of the worst areas in the state."&lt;ref name=behindthemusic /&gt; He did well in school and at age 15 was offered an opportunity to pursue college through a program called St. Petersburg Collegiate High School.&lt;ref name=behindthemusic /&gt; But despite this opportunity, he struggled with extreme depression and experimented with various drugs to try to relieve it.

The Most Illustrious [[Order of Saint Patrick]] is a British [[order of chivalry]] associated with Ireland. The Order was created in 1783&lt;ref name="royal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page4880.asp |title=Monarchy Today: Queen and Public: Honours: Order of St Patrick |accessdate=2008-12-15 |work=Official website of the British Monarchy }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] at the instigation of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], [[George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham|The 3rd Earl Temple]] (1753–1813; created The 1st [[Marquess of Buckingham]] in 1784). The regular creation of knights of Saint Patrick lasted until 1921, when most of Ireland became independent as the [[Irish Free State]].&lt;ref name="royal"/&gt; While the Order technically still exists, no knight of St Patrick has been created since 1936, and the last surviving knight, [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]], died in 1974.&lt;ref name="royal"/&gt; [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|The Queen]], however, remains the Sovereign of the Order. The position of King of Arms of the order was held by Ulster King of Arms; this office still exists, since 1943 it has been combined with Norroy King of Arms. [[Saint Patrick|St Patrick]] is [[patron saint|patron]] of the order; its motto is ''[[Quis separabit?]]'',&lt;ref name="royal"/&gt; [[Latin]] for "Who will separate us?": an allusion to the [[Vulgate]] translation of [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 8:35, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?"&lt;ref&gt;According to Galloway (pp 171–2), the motto was borrowed from the [[Order of the Friendly Brothers of St Patrick]], but was also appropriate politically in expressing a desire for unity&lt;/ref&gt;

The first appointments were made on 11 March 1783, and consisted of 15 Knight Founders, and in total there have been 145 appointments. The original Royal Warrant (dated 5 February 1783) specified that there were to be no more than fifteen knights of the Order at any one time, something that changed in 1821 when [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] appointed an extra six knights (although the royal warrant was not altered to reflect this change until 1830).&lt;ref name="lr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leighrayment.com/orders/patrick.htm|title=Leigh Rayment: Knights of St.Patrick|last=Rayment|first=Leigh|publisher=Leigh Rayment|date=24 April 2008|accessdate=2008-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] appointed an additional four knights at his coronation, and on 24 January 1833 increased the maximum number of knights to 22.&lt;ref name="lr"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8412">'''Maria Roda''' (1877–1958) was an Italian American [[anarchist]]-[[feminist]] activist, speaker and writer, who participated in the [[labour movement|labor struggles]] among [[textile industry|textile workers]] in [[Italy]] and the [[United States]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

==Early life==
Born in 1877 in [[Como]], Italy, Maria Roda was an activist in radical social movements from a young age. Her mother, Adele Parravicini, died when Roda was young, leaving her and her three sisters in the care of their father, Cesare Roda Balzarini, a weaver and activist in the local anarchist-inspired labor movements. After her mother's death, Roda and her sisters worked in the [[silk|silk mills]] of Como. It was through the influence of her radical father and the contacts she made at the mills that she became an anarchist.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Guglielmo, ''Living the Revolution: Italian Women's Resistance and Radicalism in New York City, 1880-1945'' (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 2010), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian government considered Cesare Roda to be one of the main anarchists in Como with connections to others in the movement abroad, and they monitored his activities and those of Maria throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

== Early arrest and trial ==
In 1891, Maria Roda was arrested and sent to prison for three months for her involvement in a labor strike in [[Milan]]. Roda had been accused of inciting the strikers to riot against the police.&lt;ref name = "daxa"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became famous among European activists for her spirit and her willingness to speak her mind. Even though she was only fourteen years old, she received this harsh sentence because of her defiant attitude towards the judge. When questioned about her role in inciting the riot by taunting a police officer, she said, "I pity [that] guard. I pity him because he barely earns his bread, because he's a poor devil. But it impresses me to see him go after other poor devils, his brothers...let him think about this."&lt;ref name = "daxa" /&gt;

==Activism in Italian American anarchist movement==
The Roda family immigrated to the United States in 1893 when Maria was 17. They settled in [[Paterson, New Jersey]], and quickly became active in the anarchist milieu there through one of the largest and more influential anarchist groups in the United States, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lOXr4cSzXL0C&amp;lpg=PA178&amp;ots=yv8i3oIolU&amp;dq=Gruppo%20Diritto%20all'Esistenza&amp;pg=PA178#v=onepage&amp;q=Gruppo%20Diritto%20all'Esistenza&amp;f=false Gruppo Diritto all'Esistenza] (Right to an Existence Group). Frustrated by the marginalization of women within the movement, Maria Roda and a few of the other activist women (including [[Ninfa Baronio]] and [[Ernestina Cravello]]) formed the Gruppo Emancipazione della Donna (Women's Emancipation Group) in 1897, so women in the anarchist movement could meet on their own and develop their own theories and methods of revolutionary working-class activism. As a result, Maria Roda and dozens of other women wrote, published and circulated anarchist-feminist writing through this and similar women's groups. Two of Roda's essays were published in ''La Questione Sociale'' (the Italian-language anarchist newspaper that was published in Paterson): "Alle operaie" (To women workers), September 15, 1897, and "Alle Madri" (To mothers), September 7, 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Guglielmo, ''Living the Revolution: Italian Women's Resistance and Radicalism in New York City, 1880-1945'' (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 2010), pp. 139, 162-72; Salvatore Salerno, "'No God, No Master': Italian Anarchists and the IWW" in Cannistraro and Meyer, eds., ''The Lost World of Italian American Radicalism'' (Prager, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roda and Emma Goldman==
[[Emma Goldman]] first heard Maria Roda give a speech at a large rally in 1894 at the [[Bowery Theatre|Thalia Theater]] in Manhattan, which celebrated Goldman's release from prison. Although it was in Italian and Goldman understood none of it, she wrote in her memoir how she was moved by Roda's charismatic presence. Goldman wrote, "Maria's strange beauty and the music of her speech roused the whole assembly to tensest enthusiasm. Maria proved a veritable ray of sunlight to me." She then pledged to become Maria Roda's "teacher, friend, comrade."&lt;ref&gt;Emma Goldman, ''Living My Life: Volume 1'' (Unabridged) (ReadaClassic.com, 2010), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roda and Pedro Esteve==
Roda's lifelong partner was Pedro Esteve, a [[Catalonia|Catalan]] anarchist, printer, typesetter, and newspaper editor who helped to establish ''La Questione Sociale'', one of the main Italian language anarchist newspapers in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn P. Boyd, "The Anarchists and Education in Spain, 1868-1909", ''The Journal of Modern History'', Vol. 48, No. 4, (Dec., 1976), pp. 125-170; Chris Ealham, ''Class, Culture and Conflict in Barcelona, 1898-1937'' (Routledge, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; When Esteve was editor of ''La Questione Sociale'', from 1899 to 1906, women's writing was at its peak in the paper.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Guglielmo, ''Living the Revolution: Italian Women's Resistance and Radicalism in New York City, 1880-1945'' (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 2010), 159.&lt;/ref&gt; While Roda and Esteve were based in Paterson until at least 1908, they also lived in [[Tampa, Florida]], [[Brooklyn]], and [[Weehawken, New Jersey]], to spread the cause and organize other marginalized workers. Their home at 611 Gregory Avenue in Weehawken was often a center of radical activism through the 1930s, with large gatherings on Sundays. They had ten children, though only eight survived to adulthood (Violet, Sensitiva, Sirio, Iris, Flora, Pedro, Helios and Zephyr); they lost their ten-year-old son in an explosion that they believed was an attempt on Esteve's life.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Avrich, ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America'', pp. 210-12, 143, 393&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Defence Guard Service''' ('''MGS''') is part of the [[Defence Infrastructure Organisation]] of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], and provides military establishments across the [[United Kingdom]] with unarmed [[security guard]]s and patrol services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/guidance/mod-guard-service MOD Guard Service], GOV.UK. Retrieved 8 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MGS deals with access and pass control, key control, vehicle and personnel searching, security patrols of buildings and [[perimeter fence]]s, dog patrols, [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]], and alarm monitoring. It also performs other duties like helicopter marshalling, first aid provision, mail and baggage scanning, security sweeps, and health and safety guidance.&lt;ref name=Mod&gt;http://www.mod.uk [http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/WhatWeDo/SecurityandIntelligence/MDPGA/MinistryOfDefenceGuardServicemgs.htm MGS Page at MoD website] Retrieved 16 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The MGS works alongside armed guard services—the [[Military Provost Guard Service]] in England, Scotland and Wales, and the [[Northern Ireland Security Guard Service]] in Northern Ireland.

==History==
From 2004 to 2013 MGS and [[Ministry of Defence Police]] worked in the [[Ministry of Defence Police and Guarding Agency]]. In April 2013, the MDPGA was disbanded and the MGS joined the [[Defence Infrastructure Organisation]].

==Uniforms and equipment==

Although the MGS are an unarmed security-officer organisation; they wear a similar uniform to police forces. This consists of (in an everyday working environment) a  white shirt, tie, NATO-type navy blue jumper, high visibility jacket and a black peaked cap. The shirts and jumpers have epaulettes with "MOD GUARD SERVICE" or "MOD SECURITY" printed on them and the same on jackets. The black peaked cap has the MGS badge on the front and can be worn with a clear or black waterproof cover for use in wet weather.

Any equipment carried will consist of a radio, torch, first aid kit, search equipment, security-infringement paperwork, fire safety management plans, notebook and pen.

'''Philip J. Fry''', commonly known simply by his surname '''Fry''', is a [[fictional character]] and the [[protagonist]] of the [[animated sitcom]] ''[[Futurama]]''. He is voiced by [[Billy West]] using a version of his own voice as he sounded when he was 25.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite news |author= |work=[[Fresh Air]] |title=Billy West: The Many (Cartoon) Voices In His Head |url=https://www.npr.org/2010/07/15/128490848/billy-west-the-many-cartoon-voices-in-his-head |quote='His voice is basically what I sounded like when I was 25.

[T]o try to do someone else's real voice is kind of tough.'|publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=July 15, 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Not in Springfield"/&gt;  He is a [[slacker]] [[delivery boy]] from the 20th century who becomes [[cryogenics|cryogenically frozen]] and reawakens in the 30th century to become a delivery boy there with an [[intergalactic travel|intergalactic]] delivery company run by his 30th great nephew, [[Professor Farnsworth|Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth]]. He is the best friend and roommate of [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] and the boyfriend and later husband of [[Leela (Futurama)|Turanga Leela]]. He is the father of Yancy Fry, Sr. (due to an affair with his soon-to-be paternal grandmother) and in comic only, Elena Fry as well as the stepfather of Kif's Offspring (due to Kif's pregnancy and Leela's accident motherhood).

==Character overview==
Born in the 20th century in [[New York City]], Fry is depicted as an unintelligent manchild in his 20s.&lt;ref&gt;Leela gives Fry's age in the first season episode "[[My Three Suns]]".&lt;/ref&gt; The episode "[[The Luck of the Fryrish]]" seems to imply he was 25 at the time of his freezing.&lt;ref&gt;At the beginning of the episode, a flashback goes back to his birth; the year is implied to be 1969 as a radio broadcast is heard with the [[New York Mets]] winning the [[1969 World Series|World Series]].&lt;/ref&gt; He is a [[pizza delivery]] boy who, during the last few seconds of the year 1999, falls into a [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] tank while delivering a pizza to Applied Cryogenics. He remains frozen until the last day of the year 2999. He then meets the one-eyed cryogenics counselor and his-soon-to-be wife, [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] and the cigar-smoking, [[alcoholic]], [[kleptomania]]c robot [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]]. Together, they are employed by Fry's distant nephew, the senile and demented old scientist [[Professor Farnsworth]], as the crew of his delivery company Planet Express.

Fry's parents are Yancy Fry, Sr., a strict [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] who believes in [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], and Sherri Fry (née Gleisner), an inattentive chain smoker and avid [[New York Mets]] fan. It is later revealed that Fry's family on his father's side is from [[New Mexico]]. In the past Fry had an older brother named Yancy; a dog named [[Jurassic Bark|Seymour]]; and a girlfriend named Michelle (who dumped him in the first episode, "[[Space Pilot 3000]]", just before he was frozen). Fry had a lifelong [[sibling rivalry]] with his older brother Yancy, due to Fry's perception that Yancy steals everything from him and vice versa. After dropping out of [[Coney Island]] Community College, he then got a job as a delivery boy at Panucci's Pizza. Depictions of Fry's family in early episodes showed them as extremely dysfunctional, with a neglectful mother and borderline-abusive father. Later seasons, however, depicted them as much closer and, while still dysfunctional, more loving and attentive, with Fry's father treating him harshly to ensure he grew up tough. He survived a heart attack.

===Personality and abilities===
Fry is characterized as simple, gullible, sweet, yet immature. Fry regards Bender as his closest friend. He also has strong feelings for Leela, although he lacks the intelligence required for articulating his emotions; thus, for most of the series his love remains (sometimes coldly) [[Unrequited love|unrequited]], though not entirely without hope. She does occasionally return his interest throughout the series, and in the movie ''[[Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder|Into the Wild Green Yonder]]'' she admits to loving him back. At the end of that film, they are seen sharing a kiss as they enter a wormhole, and subsequently begin dating. Despite his low intelligence, Fry is very kind-hearted, as he often goes out of his way to help his friends, even if he is sometimes oblivious to their problems. He tolerates all of his friends' quirks and is notable as the only staff member who accepts the ship's doctor, [[Zoidberg]]. Although at times lacking in self-awareness, Fry always tries to do the right thing and fix his mistakes. Fry has shown remarkable skill playing video games, (even mastering the 31st-century's version on the Internet), and in "[[Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV]]" is seen successfully playing a game despite not looking at the screen. This skill carries over to using Planet Express Ship's laser gun. Fry has also exhibited remarkable bravery and self-sacrifice on occasion and has even displayed flashes of stagnant intelligence. Also, despite his laziness and clumsiness, Fry has proved to be a competent fighter in "[[Law and Oracle]]" and "[[Fun on a Bun]]", the latter episode showing that Fry is skilled enough to hold his own against Leela in direct physical combat. He has also survived a heart attack intentionally caused by his best friend Bender.

In the episode "[[The Why of Fry]]", Leela's seemingly oblivious pet [[Nibbler (Futurama)|Nibbler]] reveals himself as the reason for Fry's freezing; because Fry lacks the [[Delta wave|Delta brainwave]]. Due to a time-travel incident in "[[Roswell That Ends Well]]", he is his own grandfather. He can withstand the intellect-draining onslaught of the evil [[Brainspawn]] and is immune to the Dark One's mind-reading in ''[[Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder|Into the Wild Green Yonder]]'' as well as the mind-controlling power of the Hypnotoad. Nibbler's race, the Nibblonians, dub him "The Mighty One". Through prediction (on the eve of 1999, as the Nibblonians lack the ability to travel through time), they guessed that Fry would be the one to save the world from the evil Brainspawn. Because his natural lifespan would not extend to the right millennium, however, Nibbler is sent to make the aforementioned delivery call to push an unsuspecting Fry into the cryogenic tube, to re-emerge December 31, 2999.

In several episodes, he feels nostalgic for the 20th century, and tries to convince his coworkers how good it was back then.

===Love life===

====Leela====
Leela is Fry's main love interest, and his love for her provides a major plot line throughout the series. Fry first begins to show a serious interest in her from the second season onwards, although she constantly turns him down for other dates due to his immaturity, though she says that she loves his boyish charm. Leela initially sees Fry as a friend and nothing more, but deeper affection for him appears occasionally, such as on the numerous occasions when he risks his life for hers ("[[Love and Rocket]]", "[[The Sting (Futurama)|The Sting]]", "[[Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences]]").

Fry's feelings for Leela are openly displayed throughout the series. In "The Sting", Fry throws himself in front of a baby Queen Bee to protect Leela, resulting in the bee's stinger completely penetrating his torso. In "Love and Rocket", upon noticing that Leela's oxygen tank was running on 'critical', he attaches her oxygen tube to his tank, giving her his oxygen and almost asphyxiating himself. In "[[Parasites Lost]]", Fry becomes infected with symbiotic "parasites" which enhance his muscles and intelligence, allowing him to attract Leela's romantic attention. However, fearing that Leela was attracted to him only for his worms, he rids himself of them in a failed bid to begin a genuine relationship. In "[[Time Keeps on Slippin']]", Fry moves the stars to write a love note to Leela, but the message is blown up before she can read it. In the final episode of the initial run, "[[The Devil's Hands are Idle Playthings]]", Fry trades hands with the Robot Devil in order to compose an opera about Leela in which they fall in love. When Fry returns the Robot Devil's hands to prevent him from forcing Leela to marry him, the opera deteriorates, causing the audience to leave. Fry sadly walks off the stage. Leela is the only one who remains behind, asking Fry not to stop because she wants to hear how it ends.  He picks up his holophonor and composes a crude ending in which the stage-Fry and stage-Leela share a single kiss.

In the film ''[[Futurama: Bender's Big Score]]'' Leela falls in love with a seemingly perfect man, Lars, and they soon become engaged. However, Lars leaves Leela on her wedding day explaining later that as a time paradox he is doomed, and that he wouldn't marry her only to have her lose him soon after. Through this he then reveals that he is in fact the time paradox of Fry, who had undergone physical changes due to an explosion and become more mature through 12 years of age and experience.

At the end of the film ''[[Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder]]'', Leela openly admits to loving Fry, and they commence an openly romantic relationship from the episode "[[Rebirth (Futurama)|Rebirth]]" onwards.  In "[[The Prisoner of Benda]]" they have "sex", albeit in differing bodies. The on-again, off again nature of their relationship causes Leela to leave Planet Express and Fry in "[[Overclockwise]]", however by the end of the episode, Leela returns to Planet Express and seemingly reunites with Fry. Bender reveals to both Fry and Leela their "ultimate fate" that he learned while he was overclocked. The audience is never shown the contents, but through their facial expressions it is clear that while the journey for them may be bumpy, Fry and Leela will ultimately end up happy.

In later episodes, such as "[[The Butterjunk Effect]]" and "[[Fun on a Bun]]", Fry and Leela are shown to be in a relationship, though the events of the series precipitate frequent arguments and breakups.  These issues are usually resolved within the episode, leaving Fry and Leela still together at the end.

During the series finale "[[Meanwhile (Futurama)|Meanwhile]]", Fry decides that it is time for him to propose to Leela. Wanting the moment of his proposal to last longer, he steals Professor Farnsworth's time machine remote that turns back time every 10 seconds. When Leela is late, he thinks she has rejected him and attempts suicide by jumping off the building; he sees her arriving just in time, however, and presses the reset button over and over again to keep from hitting the ground. He accidentally breaks the remote and freezes time, leaving himself and Leela as the only unfrozen beings in the universe. Leela accepts Fry's proposal, and they have a long, happy marriage. The Professor shows up during one of their anniversaries and repairs the time machine, but informs them it will reset their lives, leaving them with no memory of the lifetime they spent together. Fry asks Leela if she wants to go around again with him, and she replies that she does. But they are apparently still married in the video game ''[[Futurama: Worlds of Tomorrow]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

====Michelle====
Michelle (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]] in the first appearance, [[Sarah Silverman]] in the second appearance) is Fry's on-and-off girlfriend from the 20th century.  Shortly before Fry is frozen, she dumps him for a man named Constantine (called Charles in "[[The Cryonic Woman]]"), whom she later marries. They eventually split up, and she decides to freeze herself to try again in the distant future. She wakes up in 3002, meets Fry again, and restarts her relationship with him. However, she fails to fit into the 31st-century life to which Fry has become so accustomed, and so asks him to freeze himself with her for another thousand years. This plan fails, as does the rekindled relationship, so Fry leaves her. She later is shown in a limousine with the recently unfrozen [[Pauly Shore]]. In the episode "[[Proposition Infinity]]", she is again shown with Pauly Shore, and the implication is that they are now married.

====Amy Wong====
During a trip on the luxury [[starship|starliner]] ''Titanic'', [[Amy Wong]] passes Fry off as her boyfriend to avoid being set up by her parents with an unattractive potential husband. Unfortunately, [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] was also passing Fry off as her fake fiancé to ward off the attentions of [[Zapp Brannigan]].  Potential embarrassment is averted by catastrophic damage to the ship, and Amy wins the battle of the bogus boyfriends.

In "[[Put Your Head on My Shoulders]]", Fry and Amy are trapped together in a desert on [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and realize they have a lot in common. While being towed to the nearest gas station to refuel, they have sex in the car. They continue the relationship back home, but Fry intends to end it the day before [[Valentine's Day]] because he feels that they are spending too much time together. An accident ends with Fry's head being temporarily attached to Amy's body, causing much tension due to Fry's decision to break up and Amy's subsequent date, forcing Leela to step in and distract Amy's date to save Fry from an awkward situation. Despite their break-up, they remain good friends.

==Production==
[[File:Billy West by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Billy West provides the voice of Fry.]]
Although [[Billy West]] stated in an interview that the name "Philip" was given to Fry by [[Matt Groening]] as a homage to the late [[Phil Hartman]], for whom the role of [[Zapp Brannigan]] was created,&lt;ref name="TV Squad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/06/15/billy-west-the-tv-squad-interview/|title=Billy West: The TV Squad Interview|accessdate=2007-06-09|date=2006-06-15|author=Joel Keller|publisher=TV Squad.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groening said during the 2013 Futurama panel at the [[San Diego Comic-Con]] that Fry was in fact named after Groening's father, Homer Phillip Groening,&lt;ref name="Comedy Central"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/video-clips/iqfydq/futurama-comic-con-2013---futurama-panel|title=Comic-Con 2013 - Futurama Panel|accessdate=2014-02-03|date=2013-07-18|publisher=ComedyCentral.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was also the namesake for [[Homer Simpson]].

According to Groening, Fry's character developed over time while still keeping his qualities as a loser and the characteristics which writers hoped would make him appeal to the target young male audience.&lt;ref name="Sterngold" /&gt; Fry's character is essentially a bungling, stubborn slob with a heart of gold who cannot get ahead in the world, but still has a slight glimmer of hope.&lt;ref name="Sterngold"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDF173EF931A15754C0A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2| title=Bringing an Alien And a Robot to Life; The Gestation of the Simpsons' Heirs| author=Sterngold, James|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| date=1999-07-22| accessdate=2008-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fry's trademark outfit - a red [[windbreaker]] jacket, white [[t-shirt]] and blue [[jeans]] - is based on [[James Dean]]'s outfit from ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]''.&lt;ref name=1ACV01FryOutfit&gt;{{cite video|people=Cohen, David X.; Groening, Matt; Moore, Rich; Vanzo, Gregg; DiMaggio, John|date=2002|title=Futurama: Volume One DVD commentary for the episode "[[Space Pilot 3000]]"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox|quote=Matt Groening: Oh and, Fry's wearing James Dean's outfit in Rebel Without a Cause.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fry is voiced by Billy West, who also voices [[Zoidberg|Doctor Zoidberg]], [[Professor Farnsworth|Hubert J. Farnsworth]] and various other characters in the series. Although West auditioned for the part, it was originally given to [[Charlie Schlatter]];&lt;ref name="Futurama-rama"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/futurama-rama-welcome-back-to-the-world-of-tomorrow/| title=‘Futurama’-Rama: Welcome Back to the World of Tomorrow| author=[[Dave Itzkoff|Itzkoff, Dave]]|newspaper=The New York Times| date=2010-06-24| accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, after a casting change, West was offered the job.&lt;ref name="TV Squad" /&gt; The voice West uses for Fry has been described as that of a "generic Saturday-morning good guy".&lt;ref name="Not in Springfield"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04EED71730F935A15750C0A96F958260| title=A Feeling We're Not in Springfield . . .| author=Wertheimer, Ron|newspaper=The New York Times| quote=Originally I had auditioned for Dr. Zoidberg, Bender, the Professor and Fry. But I didn't get Fry&amp;nbsp;— it went to Charlie Schlatter, who's a heck of an actor and a great voice guy, but they just changed plans. They said to me, 'Fry’s 25, so bear that in mind.' It became a high-pitched version of me, trying to remember the dumb innocence of being 25. At that age I had no idea where I was going, I was working for U-Haul shoveling dirt out of trucks, I was washing dishes at nursing homes. I always thought I had this whiny, complaining voice&amp;nbsp;— this plain vanilla voice, but I guess if you're in neutral, you can go anywhere | date=1999-03-26| accessdate=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; West admits that he intentionally made Fry's sound similar to his own, claiming that keeping the "cartoony" aspects out of it would make it harder for someone else to imitate the same voice.&lt;ref name="TV Squad"/&gt; He notes that the voice is higher than his own and that he tried to duplicate the voice he had at age 25, which he describes as "this whiny, complaining voice&amp;nbsp;— this plain vanilla voice".&lt;ref name="Futurama-rama" /&gt; West also voices Lars Fillmore in ''[[Futurama: Bender's Big Score]]'', who is a time travel duplicate of Fry with an injured [[larynx]], and therefore, a slightly altered voice. The producers initially considered having a different [[voice actor]] do Lars' voice in order to keep viewers from guessing his true identity, but ultimately decided it would not make sense if anyone besides West did the voice.&lt;ref&gt;This is mentioned on the DVD commentary of ''Bender's Big Score''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Bender, a serving Detective with Simi Valley Police Department, started to re-investigate Coley's case in 1989 and discovered there were problems with the case.

In August 2001, Watkins alerted then-Enron [[CEO]] [[Kenneth Lay]] of [[accounting]] irregularities in [[financial report]]s.

He was educated at [[King Edward VI School, Stratford-upon-Avon]]. He succeeded to his father’s baronetcy in 1986 (see [[Lawrence Baronets]]).

Lawrence filled numerous roles in his political career, specialising in the promotion of tourism in the Midlands. He was a member of the [[Stratford-on-Avon District Council]] from 1982, on the South Warwickshire General Hospital NHS Trust, a member of the Heart of England Tourist Board from 1989 (and Chairman after 1991), a governor of King Edward VI School and of Stratford-on-Avon Girls Grammar School, and a Governor of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. He was also president of the British Toilet Association, campaigning for better toilet facilities for the disabled. 

He was made an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in 2003 for services to the tourist industry, and an honorary [[Master of Arts|MA]] of the [[University of Worcester]].

He contracted [[polio]] at the age of three, and used a wheelchair for the rest of his life. He married February 2005 Tamara  Bubashvili of [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], b. 1977.

'''William Butten''' was a young [[indentured servant]] of [[Samuel Fuller (Pilgrim)|Samuel Fuller]], a long-time leader of the [[Leiden]] Church. Butten died during the voyage of the ''[[Mayflower]]'' while traveling with Fuller, who had been appointed doctor for the group. At that time, children and young men were routinely rounded up from the streets of London or taken from poor families receiving church relief to be used as laborers in the colonies.&lt;ref name="Morison"&gt;Morison &amp; Commager, ''The Growth of the American Republic, Virginia, 1618-1622'' (in H.S.  vol. 1,(4th Ed., New York, 1950), p.40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.C. Johnson, ''The Transportation of Vagrant Children from London to Reinmuth'' (Ed.), Early Stuart Studies: Essays in Honor of David Harris Willson, (Minneapolis: 1970)&lt;/ref&gt; Butten was sick the entire voyage and died at sea when near the coast of New England.

==''Mayflower'' Voyage==
The ''Mayflower'' departed [[Plymouth]], England, on September 6/16, 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children.  On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.&lt;ref name= "Stratton p. 413"&gt;Eugene Aubrey Stratton, ''Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691,'' (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 413&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9/19, 1620, after about three months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was Cape Cod. And after several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the [[Colony of Virginia]], strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at [[Cape Cod]] hook, where they anchored on November 11/21. The [[Mayflower Compact]] was signed that day.  There were forty-one of the adult males, including the servants, who signed the Compact.&lt;ref name= "Stratton p. 413"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Ernest Bowman, '' The Mayflower Compact and its signers'',  (Boston: Massachusetts Society of ''Mayflower'' Descendants, 1920), Photocopies of the 1622, 1646 and 1669 versions of the document, pp. 7-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parentage==
William Butten's parentage is a mystery. His name is of an ancient French heritage introduced in England after Norman Conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Internet Archives Surname Database''[http://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Button'']''&lt;/ref&gt;  He seemed to be a long-time member of the Leiden congregation and therefore was probably one of the [[Separatism|Separatists]].  Upon the death of his father, his mother being too  poor to support him, he became an [[indentured servant]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald F. Harris, PhD., ''The Mayflower Descendant'', (July 1993), vol. 43 no. 2 p.124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morison"/&gt;  One theory is that he may have been the son of Robert Butten and baptized Austerfield 12 February 1598.&lt;ref&gt;William Bradford, ''History of Plymouth Plantation by William Bradford, the second Governor of Plymouth'', (Boston: 1856, Not in copyright), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Edward Banks, ''Original Narratives of Early American History'', (New York: Grafton Press, 1929), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Another version is that his family were members of the Separatist Community in [[Worksop]], [[Nottinghamshire]] and was baptized March 13, 1605 there, near [[William Bradford (Plymouth governor)|William Bradford]] and other Separatists.

Butten is memorialized on the ''Mayflower'' Passengers Who Died at Sea Memorial.&lt;ref&gt;Memorial of William Butten  ''Mayflower'' passengers who died at sea memorial [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=cr&amp;CRid=2190420]&lt;/ref&gt;
