The '''1771 Great Yaeyama Tsunami''' (also called 明和の大津波, the Great Tsunami of Meiwa) was caused by the '''Yaeyama Great Earthquake''' at about 8 A.M. on April 24, 1771, south-southeast of [[Ishigaki Island]], part of the former [[Ryūkyū Kingdom]] and now forming part of present-day [[Okinawa]], Japan. According to records, 8,439 persons were killed on [[Ishigaki Island|Ishigaki]] Island and 2,548 on [[Miyakojima|Miyako]] Island.

[[File:sawadanohama.jpg|thumb|180px|Sawada beach on Shimoji island. The rocks are believed to be remnants of the tsunami]]

==Earthquake analysis==
According to the Japanese government publication ''Rika-Nenpyō'' ([[:ja:理科年表|理科年表]]) or ''Chronological Scientific Tables'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rikanenpyo.jp/|title=理科年表-オフィシャルサイト|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the epicenter was 40&amp;nbsp;km south-southeast of [[Ishigaki Island]] with a magnitude of 7.4.  According to the Mamoru Nakamura Laboratory, University of the Ryukyus, the earthquake was due to the activity of the [[Fault (geology)|fault]] east of [[Ishigaki Island|Ishigaki]] and it is estimated that the magnitude was 7.5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seis.sci.u-ryukyu.ac.jp/hazard/EQ/1771yaeyama/]&lt;/ref&gt; Further simulation led to the activity of [[Fault (geology)|faults]] in the Ryukyu [[oceanic trench]] and the magnitude was 8.0. Also, there is a hypothesis that claims the magnitude was 8.5.&lt;ref name="Abe1999"&gt;[https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/zisin1948/52/3/52_3_369/_article/-char/ja/ 阿部勝征(1999)] 阿部勝征(1999): 遡上高を用いた津波マグニチュードMtの決定 -歴史津波への応用-, 地震, 第2輯, 第52巻, 369–377.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abe"&gt;阿部勝征 「津波地震とは何か」『月刊地球』Vol.25, No.5, p340&lt;/ref&gt; The depth was {{convert|6|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://seis.sci.u-ryukyu.ac.jp/hazard/EQ/1771yaeyama2/1771tsunami_2.html Meiwa earthquake was magnitude 8&lt;/ref&gt;  This trench lies between the [[Philippine Sea Plate]] and the [[Eurasian Plate]].

==Damage==

===Earthquake===
It is considered that the earthquake registered an intensity of 4(on the Japanese scale) in the [[Yaeyama Islands]], and the damage by the earthquake was not as serious as the tsunami.

===Tsunami===
The dead and missing amounted to 12,000 people, and more than 2,000 houses were destroyed on [[Ishigaki Island|Ishigaki]] and [[Miyakojima]]. Agriculture was severely damaged because of sea water invasion and the population decreased to about one third of what it was before the earthquake. On Ishigaki island, the wave was 40 to 80 meters high. There are many huge rocks believed to have been left by the [[earthquake]]. There was a legend that an [[islet]] disappeared, but this has never been verified.

On 25 May 2005 to 3 August 2005, [[Moscow]]'s ten-week-long in was a power supplies were the centre of a major incident,  restored 3 August 2005, which resulted in the supply being outed for several hours in many of City of Moscow districts, as well as [[Moscow Oblast|Moscow]], [[Tula Oblast|Tula]], [[Kaluga Oblast|Kaluga]] and [[Ryazan Oblast|Ryazan]] provinces. Some tens of thousands of people were trapped in stranded underground trains in the [[Moscow Metro]] and in [[elevator]]s, railway signaling was put out of action and many commercial and governmental organisations were paralysed.&lt;ref name="urlMoscow hit by power blackout - : news, world | euronews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euronews.net/2005/05/25/moscow-hit-by-power-blackout/ |title=Moscow hit by power blackout - : news, world &amp;#124; euronews |format= |work= |accessdate=19 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlChubais’ post and career on line for Moscow power failure | The Russia Journal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.russiajournal.com/node/19541 |title=Chubais’ post and career on line for Moscow power failure &amp;#124; The Russia Journal |format= |work= |accessdate=19 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlXinhua - English"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-05/25/content_3002837.htm |title=Xinhua - English |work= |accessdate=19 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occurrence ==
[[Image:2005 Moscow powerless trolleybus.jpg|thumb|right|The blackout day, Warshawskoe avenue, Moscow. People are heading home by foot. Note that the faces/billboards are covered by the photographer for security reasons.]]
The accident, which some accounts state affected more than 2 [[million]] people, started in powerstation no. 510 Chagino, situated in the south-east of Moscow in the Kuzminki district. Here, the high voltage (500 kV) current, going into the capital along the main power lines, is lowered via transformers for city usage to 220 kV and 110 kV.

The Chagino substation, built in 1964, is equipped with six high-to-low transformers. Another six substations situated around the [[MKAD]] carry out the same functions, and form the Moscow energy ring, which supply Moscow and neighbouring provinces with electricity.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

== Theories of cause ==
The immediate cause of the incident, some state, was a mixture of several factors, among which feature: equipment wear-and-tear, absence of back-up powers, the fact that Moscow had endured temperatures above 30&amp;nbsp;°C for a number of days. Moreover, Moscow is a very complex region and has the most complex electrical schemata, or "copper board", as it is known by those in the business. It is the only region in which there has been no automatic shut-off system installed since the fall of the [[Soviet Union]]. This increased vulnerability of Moscow's electrical network played an important role in what happened.

The '''2012 Tripoli airport clashes''' occurred on 4 June 2012, after members of the Al-Awfea militia stormed the [[Tripoli International Airport]] as a measure to prompt the government's release of its jailed leader, Abu Oegeila al-Hebshi.

==Background==
The [[Tarhuna|Tarhouna]] Al-Awfea [[militia]] group was enlisted under the command of the [[Libyan National Army]], and performed several missions tasked by military command. On the day before the clashes, Commander Abu-Alija Habshi travelled to Tripoli with two tanks that were to be given to the [[Army barracks#Military|army barracks]]. However, Habshi was stopped at a checkpoint outside of Tripoli and was asked to leave the tanks there instead; he was also informed that he needed to return to Tarhouna in order to obtain proper government documentation. However, that was the last time Habshi has been reported seen by anyone. The Libyan government has denied any involvement in Habshi's disappearance, but militiamen under the Commander's authority have alleged that the security forces are closely connected with the disappearance.&lt;ref name=lib&gt;{{cite news|title=Exclusive – New details emerge about Tripoli airport seizure as Libya Herald gains access to prisoners at Metiga airbase|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/exclusive-new-details-emerge-about-tripoli-airport-siege-as-libya-herald-gains-access-to-metiga-airbase/|accessdate=30 June 2012|newspaper=Libya Herald|date=6 June 2012|author=George Grant and Rida Akil|agency=Libya Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
200 gunmen belonging to the Al-Awfea militia took control of the [[Tripoli International Airport]] and stopped all flights, after Al-Awfea militiamen ignored the ultimatum given by Defence minister [[Osama Juwaili]] to surrender the SSC and MoD forces&lt;ref name=lib/&gt; that stormed the airport, destroyed one tank and captured the other and also arrested more than 172 Tarhouni militiamen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The airport fiasco|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/the-airport-fiasco/|accessdate=30 June 2012|newspaper=Libya Herald|date=8 June 2012|author=Umar Khan|agency=Libya Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The airport remained non-functional after the clashes. Government spokesman Nasser al-Manee said that "the airport will resume operation within 24 hours. [He] heard there were some injured". The next day, on 6 June, some airliners restarted their flights from Tripoli International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Update – Some flights resume at Tripoli airport|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/some-flights-resume-at-tripoli-airport|accessdate=30 June 2012|newspaper=Libya Herald|date=6 June 2012|author=Staff|agency=Libya Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2015 Corsican protests''' were a series of marches by several hundred [[Corsican nationalism|Corsican nationalists]] that began on 25 December, in [[Ajaccio]], capital of [[Corsica]].&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; During the initial demonstrations, a Muslim prayer hall was burned down and [[Quran desecration|Qur'ans were set alight]]. Further protests were organised after the initial march despite a government ban on protests until 4 January 2016. The protesters claimed to be acting in revenge for an incident that occurred the day prior when firefighters and police were assaulted in the neighbourhood of Jardins de l'Empereur;&lt;ref name=imported/&gt; however, outside observers labeled the ensuing riots as [[Anti-Arabism|anti-Arab]] and [[anti-Muslim sentiment|anti-Muslim]].&lt;ref name=France24/&gt;&lt;ref name=RT/&gt;&lt;ref name=SUR/&gt; The Corsican nationalist politicians have claimed their view does not legitimise [[xenophobia]], blaming the protest on [[French nationalism]] instead.&lt;ref name=imported/&gt; Scholarly opinions on this claim are divided.&lt;ref name=ibn/&gt;

==Background==
Over the past several decades, [[Corsican nationalism|Corsican nationalists]] have been calling for the island's recognition as a [[nation]] since [[French conquest of Corsica|French annexation]]. Following years of violence by the [[FLNC]] (stopped in 2014), a [[Corsican autonomy referendum, 2003|referendum]] on increased devolution failed by a narrow majority. The [[Corsican language]] is also labeled as a "definitely endangered language" by [[UNESCO]].
   
While racial tensions linger,&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|author=Craig Smith|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/26/world/racial-tensions-puncture-corsica-s-picturesque-setting.html?_r=0|title=Racial Tensions Puncture Corsica's Picturesque Setting|publisher=The New York Times|date=2004-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the December [[French regional elections, 2015]] in Corsica, the pro-autonomy party  [[Pè a Corsica]] got 35.34% of the vote, winning 24 seats out of 51. [[Gilles Simeoni]], already mayor of [[Bastia]], said: "It's a victory for Corsica and all the Corsicans. My first thoughts go to all those early campaigners who have battled for our cause for half a century – among them the youngsters, some of whom are in prison. It's a victory for an alternative policy to that which has failed Corsicans for decades. [Corsicans had a] thirst for democracy, economic development and social justice." The leader of the pro-independence group ''[[Corsica Libera]]'', Jean-Guy Talamoni, added: "It's been a 40-year-long march to arrive here. Corsica is not just a French administrative constituency – it's a country, a nation, a people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kim Willsher |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/14/corsican-nationalists-win-historic-victory-in-french-elections |title=Corsican nationalists win historic victory in French elections |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further noted the result of "those who have never accepted French rule... and have never ceased to fight for the survival of the Corsican nation" and also called for amnesty for "political prisoners" and "those still in hiding."

Negotiations were imminent for the creation of a single Corsican region by 2018 that would merge the executive with its two [[départements]]. [[The Republicans (France)|Republicans]] leader [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] said before the vote that "Mr Talamoni does not want the French Republic? Well, the French Republic does not want Mr Talamoni. This is France."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Lichfield |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/corsica-islands-new-nationalist-government-sparks-concern-in-paris-amid-renewed-calls-for-a6787016.html |title=Corsica: Installation of nationalist government sparks concern in Paris amid renewed calls for independence |publisher=The Independent |date= |accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the election, the former FLNC's Jean-Pierre Susini said: "This is the culmination of 40 years of struggle. I have always called for independence but after 200 years of (French) colonialism...the nationalists have an enormous amount of work to do." He added: "We have only two years before us. We must not disappoint, otherwise the valets of colonialism will take back control."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/save/http://en.arabstoday.net/home/pagenews/corsica-becomes-latest-european-territory |title=Corsica becomes latest European territory |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2015-12-24 |accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The election was said to play a part in the rise of nationalist sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Armstrong |first=Martin |url=http://www.armstrongeconomics.com/archives/41010 |title=Rising Separatist Movement in Corsica &amp; Riots Against Muslims |publisher=Armstrong Economics |date=2015-12-26 |accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arson and protests==
On 24 December in the poor neighbourhood of Jardins de l'Empereur, firefighters were ambushed by unidentified "hooded youths" with iron bars and baseball bats, resulting in injuries to two firefighters and a police officer.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; A local official, François Lalanne, said a fire was deliberately lit in the area and when the emergency services arrived they were attacked. An unnamed fireman said that about 20 men tried to break the windows of their truck with bars and bats.&lt;ref name="tele"/&gt; According to ''[[Corse Matin]]'', the firefighters were told "Sales Corses de merde, cassez-vous, vous n'êtes pas chez vous ici!" (Dirty shitty Corsicans, go fuck yourselves, you are not in your home here!).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Agression des pompiers : "Sales Corses, cassez-vous"|url=http://www.corsematin.com/article/ajaccio/agression-des-pompiers-sales-corses-cassez-vous.1940887.html|accessdate=28 December 2015|work=Corse Matin|date=26 December 2015|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 December, a Muslim prayer hall in Jardins de l'Empereur was burned with at least part of a [[Quran]] set on fire. It was raided by crowds the next day after accusations that the firefighters were attacked by local Arab residents.

On 27 December, following the initial arson, as well as a consequent protest ban, several hundred people marched in Corsica, though they avoided the affected neighbourhood, instead rallying in other areas. Previous marches had seen slogans such as : "Arabs get out!" On the day, they also rejected accusations that their rally was racist and chanted: "We fight against scum, not against Arabs!" and "We aren't thugs, we aren't racists!" Police were also deployed around Jardins de l'Empereur, home to many immigrants, to prevent any clashes.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

==Arrests==
Two men in their 20s were arrested for the initial attack and were due to be charged.&lt;ref name="tele"/&gt;

==Reactions==

===Politics===
Prime Minister [[Manuel Valls]] said the attack was "an unacceptable desecration," while Interior Minister [[Bernard Cazeneuve]] pledged that the perpetrators of the attacks on the firefighters and the prayer hall would be identified and arrested. He further commented that there was no place for "racism and xenophobia" in France. The French Council of the Muslim Faith denounced the violence. A ban was issued on protests in the mostly Muslim neighbourhood until at least 4 January 2016.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35187901 |title=Corsica march: Hundreds defy protest ban after Muslim prayer hall attack |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President of the [[Corsican Assembly]] Jean-Guy Talamoni blamed the "imported" ideology of the [[National Front (France)|National Front]] and claimed the protests and arson were anethema to [[Corsican nationalism]], which had established the [[Corsican Republic]].&lt;ref name=imported&gt;{{cite news|title=Corsica attack: Nationalist leader blames 'imported' racism|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35188634|accessdate=29 December 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said the perpetrators tended to support the National Front and were not nationalists.&lt;ref name="tele"/&gt; In response the National Front issued a statement that read "the unacceptable violence which shook Ajaccio on 25 December is the unfortunately expected consequence of lax and weak politics, which leaves neighbourhoods to become [[no-go area]]s where representatives of the emergency services are assaulted daily."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Communiqué de presse du Front National|url=http://www.frontnational.com/2015/12/corse-laffrontement-fruit-du-laxisme/|accessdate=29 December 2015|publisher=Front National|date=26 December 2015|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corsica's administrator [[Christophe Mirmand]] said: "This behaviour must stop. It hurts Corsica's image."&lt;ref name="tele"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chazan |first=David |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/12071632/Two-people-arrested-after-attack-on-firemen-sparks-racial-tension-in-Corsica.html |title=Two people arrested after attack on firemen sparks racial tension in Corsica |publisher=Telegraph |date=2015-12-28 |accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
[[Olivier de Germay]], [[Bishop of Ajaccio]], condemned the violence, stating that "those who commit violent acts in the name of the Christian faith are fooling themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=L'Éveque D'Ajaccio denonce les "actions violentes" commises au nom "de la foi Chretienne"|url=http://www.francesoir.fr/politique-france/leveque-dajaccio-denonce-les-actions-violentes-commises-au-nom-de-la-foi-chretienne|accessdate=29 December 2015|work=France Soir|date=29 December 2015|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academia===
Eugène Gherardi, a professor of Corsican culture and history, shares the view that xenophobic forms of nationalism reached the island through the National Front. However, Emmanuel Martin of the Institute for Economic Studies in Europe noted that the protesters were chanting in Corsican and displaying the island's flag, theorising that the alleged xenophobia would be stronger in Corsica where some locals already believe that their homeland has been colonised by the French.&lt;ref name=ibn&gt;{{cite news|title=After Anti-Muslim Protest In Corsica, Nationalism, High Unemployment, Slow Economic Growth Blamed|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/after-anti-muslim-protest-corsica-nationalism-high-unemployment-slow-economic-growth-2240947|accessdate=29 December 2015|work=International Business Times|date=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2017 Bojangles' Southern 500''', the 68th running of the [[Bojangles' Southern 500|event]], was a [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]] [[Bojangles' Southern 500|race]] held on September 3, 2017 at [[Darlington Raceway]] in [[Darlington, South Carolina]]. Contested over 367 laps on the {{convert|1.366|mi|km|adj=on}} egg-shaped oval, it was the 25th race of the [[2017 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]] season.

==Report==

===Background===
[[File:Darlington raceway.svg|thumb|left|Layout of Darlington Raceway, the track where the race is held.]]
'''Darlington Raceway''' is a [[race track]] built for [[NASCAR]] racing located near [[Darlington, South Carolina]]. It is nicknamed '''"The Lady in Black"''' and '''"The Track Too Tough to Tame"''' by many NASCAR fans and drivers and advertised as "A NASCAR Tradition." It is of a unique, somewhat egg-shaped design, an oval with the ends of very different configurations, a condition which supposedly arose from the proximity of one end of the track to a minnow pond the owner refused to relocate. This situation makes it very challenging for the crews to set up their cars' handling in a way that is effective at both ends.

The '''Sparta earthquake of 464 BC''' destroyed much of [[Sparta]], a [[city-state]] of [[ancient Greece]]. Historical sources suggest that the death toll may have been as high as 20,000, although modern scholars suggest that this figure is likely an exaggeration. The earthquake sparked a revolt of the [[helots]], the slave class of Spartan society. Events surrounding this revolt led to an increase in tension between Sparta and their rival [[Classical Athens|Athens]] and the cancellation of a treaty between them. After the troops of a relief expedition dispatched by conservative Athenians were sent back with cold thanks, Athenian democracy itself fell into the hands of reformers and moved toward a more populist and anti-Spartan policy. Therefore, this earthquake is cited by historical sources as one of the key events that led up to the [[First Peloponnesian War]].

==Effects==
Accounts of the earthquake and its consequences are based on only a few often unreliable historical sources, specifically the writings of [[Strabo]], [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [[Plutarch]], and [[Thucydides]]. It is difficult to judge the exact [[epicenter]] and [[Seismic scales#Magnitude scales|magnitude]] of the earthquake, as the science of [[seismology]] had not been developed and the historical sources are few, but it has been described as 'medium to large' by historians. It likely occurred due to vertical movement on a [[Fault (geology)|fault]] by the [[Taygetus|Taygetus Mountains]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilson | first = Nigel Guy | title = Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece | publisher = Routledge | year = 2006 |isbn = 0-415-97334-1 | page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1991 study attempted to locate the fault responsible for the event and estimate the magnitude of the [[earthquake]] based on satellite imagery and fieldwork. The authors of the study conclude that if the 464 BC event took place along the [[fault scarp]] that they identify, its magnitude would have been approximately 7.2 on the [[surface wave magnitude]] scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/351137a0 |author=Armijo, R. |author2=Lyon-Caen, H. |author3=Papanastassiou, D. | first1 = R. | title = A possible normal-fault rupture for the 464 BC Sparta earthquake | journal = Nature | volume = 351 | pages = 137–139 | date = May 9, 1991 | url = http://www.ipgp.fr/~armijo/ArmijoPDF/ArmijoNature91-N&amp;B.pdf| accessdate = 2009-10-18 | issue = 6322|bibcode = 1991Natur.351..137A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary sources estimate the dead at 20,000, although modern scholars have expressed doubt about that figure, suggesting that it may be exaggerated. They question whether such a large death toll could have happened in a city which at the time was relatively small and spread out, with most buildings being one floor and constructed from wood or sun-baked brick.&lt;ref name="Atkinson"&gt;{{cite book|last = Atkinson|first=Kathleen Mary Tyrer|title=Ancient Sparta: A Re-examination of the Evidence | publisher = Manchester University Press| year = 1952 | page = 352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings such as these would be unlikely to result in the large casualty figures ancient sources suggest. The lack of detailed population records, coupled with flight of survivors to other areas, may have contributed to the uncertainty, as it can today.&lt;ref name="Atkinson"/&gt; In such a catastrophic quake, it is also unlikely that a number of the anecdotal tales from the time could be true, such as the Spartan king [[Archidamus II|Archidamus]] leading the Spartan army out of the city to safety. Regardless of the exact death toll, there was some destruction, and the helots, the slave class in Spartan society, took advantage of this moment to rise in rebellion.&lt;ref name="Atkinson"/&gt;

==Historical significance==
The aftermath of the earthquake contributed to a growing distrust between Sparta and the increasingly powerful city-state of [[Athens]]. According to [[Thucydides]], the ancient Greek chronicler of the [[Peloponnesian War]], Sparta had already decided to invade [[Attica]] when the earthquake struck. In the aftermath of the earthquake, the helots and various [[Messenia (ancient region)|Messenian]] subjects of Sparta revolted; Sparta invoked the aid of other Greek cities to put down the rebellion, which were obliged to help in accordance with the alliance. Athens, whose aid the Spartans sought because of their "reputed experience in siege operations," sent approximately 4,000 [[hoplites]] under the leadership of [[Cimon]], but this contingent was sent back to Athens, while those from other cities were allowed to stay. By Thucydides's account (''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', I.101–102), the Spartans were concerned that the Athenians would switch sides and assist the helots; from the Spartan perspective, the Athenians had an "enterprising and revolutionary character," and by this fact alone posed a threat to the oligarchic regime of Sparta. The Athenians were insulted, and therefore repudiated their alliance with Sparta. Once the uprising was put down, some of the surviving rebels fled to Athens, which settled them at [[Naupactus]] on the strategically important [[Corinthian Gulf]]. The alliance would never be revived, as disagreements between Sparta and Athens would continue to intensify until the outbreak of war in 460 BC. Given that the Helot population seized upon the earthquake to rebel against the Spartans, they reformed their society after the Helots were gained control of again, becoming extremely austere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Warner | first = Rex (trans.) | title = Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War | publisher = Penguin Classics | year = 1954 | isbn = 0-14-044039-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albion Fairs''' was the general name for the second wave of [[East Anglia]]n Fairs, running from 1978 until 1982. There were further fairs in the same tradition most years until the end of the 1980s.

The East Anglian Fairs began with the [[Barsham, Suffolk|Barsham]] Medieval Faire in 1972, and developed into a significant feature of rural counterculture in Britain, drawing on aspects of pop festival culture, the reinvention of traditional rural or nomadic seasonal gatherings, and a back-to-the-land early green ethos. The voluntary organisers worked under the name of the East Anglian Arts Trust (EAAT). Barsham Faire ran annually on the August [[Bank Holiday]] until 1976. In 1976 EAAT revived the [[Bungay, Suffolk|Bungay]] May Horse Fair, which was also held in 1977. An ad hoc group of fair organisers and crew participated in the [[Eye, Suffolk|Eye]] Show in August 1977. This led to the formation, in the winter of 1977/1978, of Albion Fairs.

Some events used the spelling Fayre or Faire.

In the 1990s and 2000s a fairly vibrant if not quite as accessible successor to the Fairs in the region was organised as the mostly biennial gatherings of Dance Camp East.

'''Andre Chad Parenzee''' (born c. 1971)&lt;ref&gt;aged 36 at the time of the 2007 verdict&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[HIV-positive]] [[Australia]]n man convicted of three counts of endangering human life by exposing others to the risk of infection through unprotected sex as he claimed to them that he was HIV [[seronegative]]. In one instance he actually transmitted the virus.

Born in [[Cape Town, South Africa]], Parenzee moved to [[Adelaide, Australia]] at the age of 15, becoming a chef and settling in [[Port Pirie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://independentweekly.com.au/?article_id=10223958&amp;PHPSESSID=49a793fa898a739311aa7670845ac70b ''Independent Weekly'']  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225192916/http://independentweekly.com.au/?article_id=10223958&amp;PHPSESSID=49a793fa898a739311aa7670845ac70b |date=25 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2006, he was convicted on 3 counts of endangering life; the basis of the conviction was that he had [[unprotected sex]] with three women over a period of several years, despite being aware of the transmissibility of HIV, and had transmitted HIV to one of them.&lt;ref name="verdict"&gt;[http://www.courts.sa.gov.au/judgments/Judgments2007/0427-SASC-143.htm Supreme Court of South Australia: R v. Parenzee]. Decision on appeal, dated 27 April 2007. Accessed 9 May 2007.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430062920/http://www.courts.sa.gov.au/judgments/Judgments2007/0427-SASC-143.htm |date=30 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, Parenzee appealed his conviction, claiming that the existence and virulence of HIV have not been proven. He was supported by testimony from Valendar Turner and Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos, two [[AIDS denialist]]s from [[The Perth Group]] who question the existence of HIV. A number of prominent researchers, including [[Robert Gallo]], testified to the [[scientific consensus]] that HIV exists and causes AIDS. Ultimately, the judge rejected the qualifications and testimony of the AIDS dissident witnesses, finding that there is "no longer any genuine scientific dispute" that HIV exists and causes AIDS.&lt;ref name="shadow"&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/shadow-of-doubters/2007/05/04/1177788403414.html "Shadow of Doubters"] (5 May 2007) ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', Accessed 9 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Parenzee's appeal was denied.&lt;ref name="verdict"/&gt; Parenzee's lawyer, [[Kevin Borick]], stated that he planned to appeal to a three judge panel.

== Circumstances of the case ==
The first woman involved, known in court documents as "Ms KC", bore Parenzee two children (one in 1990 and one in 1994). Parenzee was diagnosed HIV positive on 21 September 1998; he married Ms KC on 7 November 1998, keeping his diagnosis from her, and continuing to have unprotected sex with her. They separated in 2000, at which time Parenzee began cohabiting with "Ms SMC", a mother of two, and having unprotected sexual intercourse with her. In July 2001 Parenzee was hospitalized with what he falsely claimed to be cancer, and Parenzee's sister informed Ms SMC that in fact, Parenzee was HIV positive.  Ms SMC took an HIV test of her own at that time and was determined to be HIV positive on 20 July 2001.

Ms KC did not learn of Parenzee's diagnosis until 21 July 2003, at a hearing over access to their children.  She testified that when confronted, he stated that he "did not give a shit about making [Ms SMC] ill."

The third victim, referred to as "Ms JB", had sexual intercourse with Parenzee from September to October 2004. Ms KC let her know that Parenzee was HIV positive by phone on 19 November 2004. Parenzee told her that was a lie; however JB confirmed it was true with Parenzee's mother, and by obtaining documentation from KC.

== Court proceedings ==
Parenzee's request to try the cases separately was denied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/sa/SASC/2006/127.html ''Regina v. Parenzee''] (2 May 2006) SASC 127, Supreme Court of South Australia&lt;/ref&gt;  He was tried and convicted on 3 counts of endangering human life on 31 January 2006. His lawyers appealed the case to the [[Supreme Court of South Australia]], claiming a miscarriage of justice, on the basis that there was no proof that HIV existed, could be sexually transmitted, caused AIDS, or could be tested for. At the hearing, the lawyers tried to present two members of the Perth Group, Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos and Valendar Francis Turner, as expert witnesses in support of their claims. David Albert Cooper, Martyn Andrew Haydon French, Elizabeth Mara Dax, Dominic Edmund Dwyer, David Llewellyn Gordon, John Martin Kaldor, [[Robert Gallo]], and Peter James McDonald were expert witnesses testifying against the claims.

The presiding Justice John Sulan found that Papadopulos-Eleopulos lacked training and expertise in the field of biology, and had misrepresented the positions of others in her testimony. His finding was that:
{{Quote|Ms Papadopulos-Eleopulos has no formal qualifications in medicine, biology, virology, immunology, epidemiology or any other medical disciplines. She has never treated or been directly involved in clinical trials of any kind relating to any disease. Her duties at the [[Royal Perth Hospital]] are to test people for sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has not read or she has chosen to ignore an enormous volume of recently published material on the diagnosis and treatment of HIV/AIDS.  She has been selective in the material upon which she relies.&lt;ref name="verdict"/&gt;}}

Justice Sulan also found that "her qualifications do not provide her with the academic study required to give opinions on medical and scientific matters unrelated to nuclear physics." He further noted that she had no practical experience or formal qualifications in virology, epidemiology, electron microscopy, biology or immunology. The judge found that:
{{Quote|...she [Papdopulos-Eleopulos] is not qualified to express opinions about the existence of HIV, or whether it has been established that it causes AIDS. Nor has she expertise to express opinions about whether the virus is transmissible. Nor is she qualified to express opinions about the tests that have been developed to diagnose the virus.&lt;ref name="verdict"/&gt;}}

Regarding the Perth Group, the judge found that the Perth Group will use whatever means available to promote debate, including encouragement of persons such as the applicant, to promote their theories in courts of law.

Regarding Dr. Turner, the judge found that his knowledge of the subject matter is limited to reading.  "He has no formal qualifications to give expert opinions about the virus.  He has no practical experience in the treatment of viral diseases. He has no practical experience in the disciplines of virology, immunology or epidemiology."

Despite the inadmissibility of Turner &amp; Papadopulos-Eleopulos's testimony, the Judge chose to consider the claims of the defence that HIV did not exist, that it was not sexually transmissible, that it did not cause AIDS, and that tests for HIV were unreliable.

== Findings ==
The judge found that, contrary to Turner &amp; Papadopulos-Eleopulos's assertions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/national/judge-dismisses-claim-hiv-does-not-exist/2007/04/27/1177459969110.html "Judge dismisses claim HIV does not exist"] (27 April 2007) ''Brisbane Times''&lt;/ref&gt;
# HIV has been isolated
# HIV exists and is identifiable.
# There is no longer any genuine scientific dispute about that proposition.
# Electron micrographs of HIV exist.
# The [[HIV test|genetic testing]] which has been developed is specific and accurate for the identification of HIV
# Endogenous retroviral sequences are distinguishable from HIV
# The method for [[HIV test|testing for HIV]] is extremely rigorous and is highly specific and sensitive, and provides a scientific basis for establishing HIV infection
# Antibody tests which are used throughout the world accurately test for the virus HIV.
# There is overwhelming evidence that HIV can be and is transmitted by sexual intercourse, including heterosexual contact
# HIV causes [[AIDS]]
# Though there is disagreement about the mechanism, HIV causes the depletion of [[CD4]] cells and causes the breakdown of the immune system, resulting in the various diseases which are defined as AIDS-related diseases

The judge also denied an extension of time to appeal on the basis that the woman who seroconverted after having sex with Parenzee might have contracted the virus elsewhere, citing studies demonstrating the similarities of the infective strains.

In September 2007, Parenzee was sentenced to nine years in prison. He will be eligible for parole in five years. The sentencing judge noted that, even at the time of sentencing, Parenzee had not yet come to terms with the damage he had wrought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article2547647.ece "HIV sufferer jailed for unprotected sex" (28 September 2007) ''The Times'', London]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, South Australia's Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed Parenzee's application for an extension of time to appeal and his application for leave to appeal, finding both applications incompetent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.smh.com.au/national/hiv-man-loses-appeal-against-conviction-20080916-4hpk.html "HIV man loses appeal against conviction"] (16 September 2008) ''The Sydney Morning Herald''&lt;/ref&gt; The finding was 2 to 1; the dissenter, Chief Justice John Doyle, said he would have granted leave to appeal, but would have rejected that final appeal anyway. An application to the High Court was expected; Parenzee was, with time off for good behaviour, eligible for parole in 2011.

The '''Arzamas explosion''', also known as the '''Arzamas train disaster''', was a [[railway accident]] that occurred on June 4, 1988 in [[Arzamas]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Gorky Oblast]], [[Soviet Union]], when an [[explosion]] at a [[railway crossing]] killed 91 people and injured 1,500.&lt;ref name=nyt-explo&gt;{{cite news |last1=Taubman |first1=Philip |title=Soviet Freight Train Explodes, Killing at Least 68 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/06/world/soviet-freight-train-explodes-killing-at-least-68.html |accessdate=August 18, 2015 |work=New York Times |date=June 6, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[freight train]] featuring three [[goods wagon]]s carrying 118 tons of [[explosives]] from [[Dzerzhinsk, Russia|Dzerzhinsk]] to the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]] exploded at a railway crossing near the [[Arzamas I railway station|Arzamas-1]] train station when [[hexogen]] included in the load detonated for unknown reasons, also detonating the other explosives stored in the wagons. The explosion also caused major damage to Arzamas, creating a 26&amp;nbsp;metre deep crater (85&amp;nbsp;ft), destroying 151 buildings including 2 hospitals, 49 [[kindergartens]], 14 schools, 69 stores, and around 823 families were left homeless. It destroyed 250 meters of railroad tracks, an [[electrical substation]], some [[power lines]], and damaged the [[gas pipeline]] and the railway station.

The officially accepted cause of the explosion is considered to be violation of the rules of loading and transportation of explosives. Alternative theories by some, including Nizhny Novgorod Oblast governor Gennady Khodyrev, have believed the explosion was planned as a [[terrorist]] act or as the actions of foreign [[special forces|special services]] with the purpose of forcing instability in the Soviet Union. The Arzamas train disaster occurred exactly a year before the [[Ufa train disaster]], one of the deadliest railway accidents in Soviet and Russian history.

The '''Bataclan''' ({{IPA-fr|bataklɑ̃}}) is a [[Theater (building)|theatre]] located at 50 [[Boulevard Voltaire]] in the [[11th arrondissement of Paris|11th arrondissement]] of [[Paris]], France. Designed in 1864 by the architect Charles Duval, its name refers to ''[[Ba-ta-clan]]'', an operetta by [[Jacques Offenbach]]. Since the early 1970s, it has been a venue for rock music.

On 13 November 2015, 89 people were killed in [[November 2015 Paris attacks|a coordinated terrorist attack]] in the theatre.

==History==

===Origin and use===
The Bataclan originated as a large ''[[café-concert]]'' in the [[Chinoiserie]] style, with the café and theatre on the ground floor and a large dance hall at first-floor level. Its original name was Grand Café Chinois.&lt;ref name =RS&gt;{{cite news |last=Browne |first=David |title=Le Bataclan: Attack Occurred at One of Paris' Most Legendary Clubs: Historic venue has hosted famous performances by Prince, Velvet Underground, Jeff Buckley and many more |newspaper=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=14 November 2015 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/le-bataclan-attack-occurred-at-one-of-paris-most-legendary-clubs-20151114 |accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French name "Bataclan" refers to [[Ba-ta-clan|the Offenbach operetta]], but it is also a pun on the expression ''tout le bataclan'' (the "kit and caboodle", or "all that jazz", or "the whole nine yards"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.languefrancaise.net/Bob/32521 “et tout le bataclan”] (Bob: Dictionnaire d'argot, de français familier et de français populaire).&lt;/ref&gt; the oldest written use of which predates Offenbach in a journal entry of 11 November 1761 by [[Charles Simon Favart]].

Concerts were held there but it was best known for putting on the [[vaudeville]]s of [[Eugène Scribe]], [[Jean-François Bayard]], [[Mélesville]], and [[Théophile Marion Dumersan]].&lt;ref name=israelvalley&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israelvalley.com/news/2015/11/13/48383/israel-valley-hyper-attentats-a-paris-11eme-10eme-60-morts-otages-au-bataclan |title=Hyper-attacks in Paris. 118 dead |publisher=Israel Valley News |date=13 November 2015 |accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bataclan.jpg|thumb|left|Postcard of the Bataclan with its original pagoda roof, {{circa}} 1900]]
The establishment, designed in 1864 by the architect Charles Duval, opened under the management of André Martin Paris on 3 February 1865 and was later bought by the singer Paulus in 1892.&lt;ref name=israelvalley/&gt; Also in 1892, [[Buffalo Bill|Buffalo Bill Cody]] performed there.&lt;ref name = PIB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityguide.paris-is-beautiful.com/en/paris/entertainment-en-2/bataclan-an-original-and-monumental-theatre/7050 |title=Bataclan: An original and monumental theatre |website=Paris-Is-Beautiful Cityguide | access-date =15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next several years the building experienced both good and bad luck, and many changes in ownership. New fashions after 1910 led to a restoration of the auditorium and a programme dedicated solely to revues, especially those put on by [[José de Bérys]]. [[Maurice Chevalier]] had his first theatrical success there, and [[Édith Piaf]] also performed there. Inspired by their new successes, the Bataclan troupe took big shows on a South American tour that proved financially disastrous.&lt;ref name=israelvalley/&gt;

In 1926 the auditorium was sold and transformed into a cinema. A fire broke out in the building in 1933. The original building was partially demolished in 1950 to bring it into compliance with new safety measures then in force. In 1969, the cinema closed and the auditorium again became a ''salle de spectacle'' (usually translated as ''theatre'', occasionally as ''exhibition hall'').&lt;ref name=israelvalley/&gt;

The venue started booking rock acts in the 1970s, and many famous performers have played there since. Among them are [[Soft Machine]], [[Kraftwerk]],&lt;ref name="Bataclan concert ticket"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/twingokraftwerk/photos/a.219861644784004.31252.217739824996186/627397637363734/?type=3&amp;theater |title=La Guimbarde presénte 2 concerts en Mars 1975|publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the terror attacks on 13 November 2015, during the concert by [[Eagles of Death Metal]], the theatre was closed.&lt;ref name = Guardian/&gt; [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] reopened the venue with a concert one year following the attack.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37962584 |title=Paris attacks: Bataclan reopens with Sting concert |publisher=BBC |accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bataclan is known today for a very eclectic programme of events, including rock and pop concerts, ''spectacles'', comedy, [[disco]]s and [[café-théâtre]]. Its façade was repainted in its original colours in 2006, but its [[pagoda]] roof has been removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/13/the-bataclan-theater-the-epicenter-of-the-terror-attack-in-paris/ |title=The Bataclan theater, the epicenter of the terror attacks in Paris |work=The Washington Post |date=13 November 2015 |accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, the theatre hosted a "Who Is Malcolm X" event, featuring Muslim rappers [[Médine (rapper)|Médine]], [[Kery James]], [[Disiz]] and [[Daara J|Faada Freddy]].&lt;ref name = Guardian/&gt;

[[Jeff Buckley]] recorded his EP ''[[Live from the Bataclan]]'' there in 1995. [[Progressive metal]] band [[Dream Theater]] recorded their 1998 live album ''[[Once in a LIVEtime]]'' at the Bataclan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gratefuldreams.com/releases/release-dt19980625.html |title=Once in a Lost Livetime |publisher=Grateful Dreams Remasters Series No. 75 |accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1972 performance by [[Lou Reed]], [[John Cale]] and [[Nico]] of the [[Velvet Underground]], long circulated as a bootleg, was officially released in 2004 as ''[[Le Bataclan '72]]''.  [[Camel (band)|Camel]]'s 2001 live album ''[[The Paris Collection (Camel album)|The Paris Collection]]'' was recorded there.

===Threats for pro-Israel activities===
For 40 years, Bataclan had Jewish owners, Pascal and Joel Laloux, who sold the theatre to new owners on 11 September 2015. The theatre was a target for anti-Zionist activists, since the venue often held pro-Israel events. One extremist group called "[[Army of Islam (Gaza Strip)|Army of Islam]]" threatened the Bataclan in 2011 because its owners were Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/jewish-owners-recently-sold-pariss-bataclan-theater-where-is-killed-dozens/ |title=Jewish owners recently sold Paris's Bataclan theater, where IS killed dozens |work=The Times of Israel |accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/92438-151114-was-the-bataclan-targeted-for-jewish-ownership-and-support-for-israel |title=Was the Bataclan targeted for Jewish ownership and support for Israel? |publisher=i24news.tv |accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pro-Palestinian activists have protested against the Bataclan's association with pro-Israel activities. A video posted on YouTube shows masked pro-Palestinian militant protesters at the Bataclan in 2008 stating: "We came here to pass along a small message. Be warned. Next time we won’t be coming here to talk.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Krol |first=Charlotte |title=Paris attacks: Militant gang warns of attack on Bataclan in chilling video from 2008 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=17 November 2015 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11999860/Paris-attacks-Militant-gang-warns-of-attack-on-Bataclan-in-chilling-video-from-2008.html |accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 terrorist attacks===
{{Main article|November 2015 Paris attacks}}
On 13 November 2015, as part of a series of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) terrorist attacks across Paris, three gunmen who were French nationals of Algerian descent  conducted a [[mass shooting]] at the Bataclan. An Austrian duo, the [[White Miles]], had completed their performance, and the American rock band [[Eagles of Death Metal]] were in the midst of their performance when three gunmen wearing suicide belts entered the theatre, firing at people at random, and taking hostages. The police later stormed the theatre, and two gunmen killed themselves during the police raid by detonating [[explosive belt|suicide vests]] they were wearing; a third was killed by police gunfire before he could detonate his vest.&lt;ref name="AFP summary"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/least-120-dead-paris-attacks-investigation-source-pta-013205822.html |title=More than 120 people killed in Paris 'terror' attacks |publisher=[[Yahoo!

====Aftermath of attack====
[[File:Paris Shootings - The day after (22593744177).jpg|thumb|left|The Bataclan the day after the mass shooting and explosive detonation]]

It was discovered shortly after the news broke of the attacks that the American rock band [[Deftones]] had members in attendance at the Eagles of Death Metal Show. The lead singer of Deftones, [[Chino Moreno]], was eating dinner nearby with his family. Deftones had been scheduled to perform at the Bataclan the following nights.

Irish rock band [[U2]] had been scheduled to perform two Paris concerts in the days following the attack, including one to be broadcast live on [[HBO]]. The French government cancelled the concert and the members of the band went to the Bataclan the day after the attack, leaving bouquets of flowers in memory of the victims. Lead singer [[Bono]] offered condolences, and the band pledged to reschedule their Paris shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Greene |first=Andy |title=Bono on Paris Terrorist Attack: 'This Could Be Me or You at a Show': "This is the first direct hit on music that we've had in this so-called War on Terror," U2 singer says.

On 16 November, the Bataclan management issued a statement that stated that the theatre was closed indefinitely. It read, "No words suffice to express the magnitude of our grief. Our thoughts go to the victims, to the wounded and to their loved ones. Many of you have wanted to gather in remembrance at the Bataclan. Unfortunately, the authorities still need to work at the site. We will keep you informed about when it will be possible to assemble in front of the hall.

Eagles of Death Metal issued a statement about the attacks on 18 November, expressing their horror about the attacks and their sympathy with friends and family of the victims, and thanking survivors, authorities, and French and American police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sisario |first=Ben |title=Eagles of Death Metal Make First Statement on Paris Attacks |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=18 November 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/19/arts/music/eagles-of-death-metal-make-first-statement-since-paris-attacks.html |accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; White Miles offered their condolences on that day as well, saying: "We are happy, but miserable at the same time.

{{Battles involving Assyria}}

The '''Battle of the Ulai River''' (called in modern times the Kerkha&lt;ref&gt;Roux, p. 333&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Karkheh River]]), also known as the Battle of Til-Tuba, in c. 653 BCE, was a battle between the invading [[Assyria]]ns, under their king [[Ashurbanipal]], and the kingdom of [[Elam]], which was a [[Babylon]]ian ally. The result was a decisive Assyrian victory. [[Teumman]],&lt;ref&gt;Roux, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; the king of Elam, and his son Tammaritu were killed in the battle.

==Background==
Under the reign of [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] (744-27 BCE) through [[Ashur-uballit II]] (611 BCE) Assyria led several campaigns across the known world. However Assyria struggled to maintain control over their closest neighbor Babylonia. In a rebellion against one of [[Sennacherib]]'s (704-681) rule in Babylon, [[Chaldea]]n [[Mushezib-Marduk]] seized the throne and formed a coalition including the Chaldeans, Aramaens, Elamites, and Babylonians and went to battle in 691 near the city of Halule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van De Mieroop|first1=Marc|title=A History of the Ancient Near East|date=2007|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-1-4051-4911-2|page=229|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The coalition was defeated and Sennacherib began a 15-month campaign against Babylonia, sacking palaces and burning temples. Sennacherib's son, [[Esarhaddon]] (680-69) attempted to rebuild Babylonia and establish himself as king. His successors Ashurbanipal (668-27) took the throne in [[Ninevah]] while [[Shamash-Shuma-Ukin]] claimed kingship in Babylon and continued to rebuild it. While Babylonia was technically independent of Assyria, the correspondence between the two brothers suggests that Ashurbanipal saw Babylonia as a vassal state and exercised control over it. Shamash-Shuma-Ukin began looking for a chance to rebel. 
A few years before, Teumman (or Te'uman, 664-653 BCE), a known enemy of Assyria, had usurped the Elamite throne, forcing the sons of Urtaki to flee to Nineveh, the Assyrian capital. Teumman demanded they be extradited,&lt;ref&gt;Roux, p.332&lt;/ref&gt; but Ashurbanipal refused. Teumman began a campaign against [[Na'id Marduk]], Assyria's puppet ruler in the Sealand, around 675 BCE. After pushing out the Assyrian influences, Teumman placed [[Nabo-usalim]] on the throne in [[Ur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waters|first1=Matthew| title=Te'umman in the Neo-Assyrian Correspondence |year=1999|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society| volume=119.3|publisher=University of Delaware}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle and aftermath==
Teumman, Nabo-Usallim and Shamash-Shuma-Ukin all formed a coalition and marched against Assurbanipal and met his forces on the banks of the Ulai River (hence the name "Battle of the Ulai River") where they were defeated. Teumman was killed in battle and his head was carried to Ninevah and placed on display in Ashurbanipal's court. Ashurbanipal began a 4-year campaign against Babylonia and placed [[Kandalanu]] on the throne to replace his brother. [[Susa]], the capital of Elam was sacked in 647 BCE and Elam never regained its power until the Persians conquered it a century later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van De Mieroop|first1=Marc|title=A History of the Ancient Near East|date=2007|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-1-4051-4911-2|page=229|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relief carvings===
The Battle of Ulai is well known because of the relief carvings found in Ashurbanipal's palace in Ninevah. These chaotic images portray the torture and death of countless enemy soldiers. The severed head of Teumman can be found in nearly every panel including the panel depicting the king's victory banquet. This is consistent with the Assyrian propaganda "which urges viewers to be both fearful and in awe of Assyrian might".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Battle of Til-Tuba (Battle of the River Ulai)|last=Bahrani|first=Zainab|url=http://www.learner.org/courses/globalart/work/154/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the annual [[Boston Marathon]] on April 15, 2013, two homemade pressure cooker bombs detonated 12 seconds and {{convert|210|yd|m}} apart at 2:49&amp;nbsp;p.m., near the finish line of the race, killing three people and injuring several hundred others, including 16 who lost limbs.&lt;ref name="NYDN-5/15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="globe-number-injured" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn-what-we-know" /&gt;

Three days later, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) released images of two suspects,&lt;ref name="Clark Estes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-5" /&gt; who were later identified as [[Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyz]]-American brothers [[Dzhokhar Tsarnaev]] and [[Tamerlan Tsarnaev]]. They killed an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department#Shooting by Boston Marathon bombing suspects|MIT policeman]], kidnapped a man in his car, and had a shootout with the police in nearby [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]], during which two officers were severely injured, one of whom died a year later. Tamerlan was shot several times, and his brother ran him over while escaping in the stolen car; Tamerlan died soon after.

An unprecedented [[Manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]] for Dzhokhar ensued on April 19, with thousands of law enforcement officers searching a 20-block area of Watertown;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-6" /&gt; residents of Watertown and surrounding communities were asked to stay indoors, and the transportation system and most businesses and public places closed.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoZ2-1" /&gt; Around 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., a Watertown resident discovered Dzhokhar hiding in a boat in his backyard.&lt;ref&gt;"Two unnamed officials say Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, did not have a gun when he was captured Friday in a Watertown, Mass. backyard. Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said earlier that shots were fired from inside the boat." The Associated Press Wednesday, April 24, 2013, 8:42 PM.&lt;/ref&gt; He was shot and wounded by police before being taken into custody.&lt;ref name="NY Times Standoff" /&gt;

During questioning, Dzhokhar said that he and his brother were motivated by extremist [[Islamism|Islamist]] beliefs and the [[Iraq War|wars in Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], that they were self-radicalized and unconnected to any outside terrorist groups, and that he was following his brother's lead. He said they learned to build explosive devices from an [[Inspire (magazine)|online magazine]] of the [[al-Qaeda]] affiliate in [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-8" /&gt; He also said they had intended to travel to [[New York City]] to bomb [[Times Square]]. On April 8, 2015, he was convicted of 30 charges, including use of a [[Weapon of mass destruction#Criminal (civilian)|weapon of mass destruction]] and malicious destruction of property resulting in death.&lt;ref name="DOJ affidavit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dzhokhar Tsarnaev: Boston Marathon bomber found guilty|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-32225787|accessdate=April 8, 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, he was sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/what-happened-dzhokhar-tsarnaev-update-boston-marathon-bomber-sentenced-death-2526052|title=What Happened To Dzhokhar Tsarnaev?

The [[2013 Boston Marathon|117th annual Boston Marathon]] was run on [[Patriots' Day]], April 15, 2013. At {{Nowrap |2:49&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]}} {{Nowrap|(18:49 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]])}}, two bombs detonated about {{convert|210|yd|m}} apart at the finish line on Boylston Street near [[Copley Square]].&lt;ref name="globe_explosions_rock" /&gt;&lt;ref name="globe-investigation-continues" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN_Levs" /&gt; The first exploded outside [[Marathon Sports (retailer)|Marathon Sports]] at 671–673 Boylston Street at 2:49:43&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="globe_explosions_rock" /&gt; At the time of the first explosion, the race clock at the finish line showed 04:09:43,&lt;ref name="AutoLC-13" /&gt;{{snd}}the elapsed time since the Wave 3 start{{explain|date=July 2018}} at 10:40&amp;nbsp;a.m. The second bomb exploded at 2:49:57&amp;nbsp;p.m.,&lt;ref name="globe-investigation-continues" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NBCNews" /&gt; about 14 seconds later and one block farther west at 755 [[Boylston Street]].&lt;ref name="cnn-what-we-know" /&gt; The explosions took place nearly three hours after the winning runner crossed the finish line,&lt;ref name="NBCNews" /&gt; but with more than 5,700 runners yet to finish.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-11" /&gt;

Windows on adjacent buildings were blown out but there was no structural damage.&lt;ref name="NBCNews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-marathon-blasts" /&gt; Runners continued to cross the line until 2:57&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-14" /&gt;

== Casualties and initial response ==
Rescue workers and medical personnel, on hand as usual for the marathon, gave aid as additional police, fire, and medical units were dispatched,&lt;ref name="AutoLC-29" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-30" /&gt; including from surrounding cities as well as private ambulances from all over the state. The explosions killed 3 civilians and injured an estimated 264 others, who were treated at 27 local hospitals. At least 14 people required amputations, with some suffering [[traumatic amputation]]s as a direct result of the blasts.&lt;ref name="globe-number-injured" /&gt;

Police, following emergency plans, diverted arriving runners to [[Boston Common]] and [[Kenmore Square]]. The nearby [[The Lenox Hotel|Lenox Hotel]] and other buildings were evacuated.&lt;ref name="CNN_Levs" /&gt; Police closed a 15-block area around the blast site; this was reduced to a 12-block crime scene on April 16.&lt;ref name="NYT-marathon-blasts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters_McLaughlin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN_Levs" /&gt; Boston police commissioner [[Edward F. Davis]] recommended that people stay off the streets.&lt;ref name="NYT-marathon-blasts" /&gt;

Dropped bags and packages, abandoned as their owners fled from the blasts,  increased uncertainty as to the possible presence of more bombs.&lt;ref name="globe_explosions_rock" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-31" /&gt; There were false reports of more bombs.&lt;ref name="Clark Estes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN_Levs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox News1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levitz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hines" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-33" /&gt; An unrelated electrical fire at the [[John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum|John F. Kennedy Presidential Library]] in nearby [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] was initially feared to be a bomb.

[[File:2013 Boston Marathon explosions aftermath emergency services.jpg|thumb|left|Emergency services at work after the bombing]]
The airspace over Boston was restricted, and departures halted from Boston's [[Logan International Airport]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-35" /&gt; Some local transit service was halted as well.&lt;ref name="NBCNews" /&gt;

The [[Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency]] suggested people trying to contact those in the vicinity use text messaging instead of voice calls because of crowded cellphone lines.&lt;ref name="NBCNews" /&gt; Cellphone service in Boston was congested but remained in operation, despite some local media reports stating that cell service was shut down to prevent cell phones from being used as detonators.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

The [[American Red Cross]] helped concerned friends and family receive information about runners and casualties.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-37" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ARC" /&gt; The [[Boston Police Department]] also set up a [[helpline]] for people concerned about relatives or acquaintances to contact and a line for people to provide information.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-38" /&gt; [[Google Person Finder]] activated their disaster service under ''Boston Marathon Explosions'' to log known information about missing people as a publicly viewable file.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-39" /&gt;

Due to the closure of several hotels near the blast zone, a number of visitors were left with nowhere to stay; many Boston-area residents opened their homes to them.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-40" /&gt;

== Investigation ==
[[File:Pressure cooker bomb.jpg|thumb|This [[pressure cooker]] fragment was part of one of the explosive devices.]]
The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] led the investigation, assisted by the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the [[National Counterterrorism Center]], and the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]],&lt;ref name="Hosenball" /&gt; and they named two official suspects.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-45" /&gt; It was initially believed by some that [[North Korea]] was behind the attack after escalating tensions and threats with the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/north-korea-blamed-for-boston-bombings-2013-4?IR=T&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibtimes.com/north-korea-denies-any-link-boston-marathon-bombs-says-it-still-may-strike-us-1211721&lt;/ref&gt;

United States government officials stated that there had been no intelligence reports suggesting such an attack. Representative [[Peter T. King|Peter King]], a member of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Intelligence Committee]], said: "I received two top secret briefings last week on the current threat levels in the United States, and there was no evidence of this at all."&lt;ref name="AutoLC-46" /&gt;

The father of the two suspects claimed that the FBI had been watching his family, and that they questioned his sons in Cambridge, Massachusetts five times in relation to possible explosions on the streets of Boston.{{explain|reason=possible explosions?|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref name="AutoLC-47" /&gt;

[[File:Tsarnaev Fireworks.jpg|thumb|left|Emptied fireworks from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's backpack, found in a landfill near the UMass Dartmouth campus]]
Evidence found near the blast sites included bits of metal, nails, ball bearings,&lt;ref name="McLaughlin" /&gt; black nylon pieces from a backpack,&lt;ref name="AutoLC-131" /&gt; remains of an electronic circuit board, and wiring.&lt;ref name="McLaughlin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lister" /&gt; A [[pressure cooker]] lid was found on a nearby rooftop.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-49" /&gt; Both of the [[improvised explosive device]]s were [[pressure cooker bomb]]s manufactured by the bombers.&lt;ref name="abc-pressure-cooker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-50" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-51" /&gt; Authorities confirmed that the brothers used bomb-making instructions found in [[Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]]'s ''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Auto9P-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="la-times-suspect-describes-plot" /&gt; After the suspects were identified, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' reported that Tamerlan purchased [[fireworks]] from a fireworks store in [[New Hampshire]].&lt;ref name="AutoQU-2" /&gt;

On April 19, the FBI, [[West New York]] Police Department, and [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson County]] Sheriff's Department seized computer equipment from the apartment of the Tsarnaevs' sister in [[West New York, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-52" /&gt; On April 24, investigators reported that they had reconstructed the bombs, and believed that they had been triggered by remote controls used for toy cars.&lt;ref name="la-times-bombs-triggered" /&gt;

[[Jeff Bauman]] was immediately adjacent to one of the bombs and lost both legs; he wrote while in the hospital: "Bag, saw the guy, looked right at me".&lt;ref name="Bauman evidence" /&gt; He later gave a detailed description which enabled the photo to be identified and circulated quickly.&lt;ref name="Bauman evidence" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-53" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-54" /&gt;

At 5:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. on April 18, the FBI released images of two suspects carrying backpacks, asking the public's help in identifying them.&lt;ref name="FBI18AprSuspectPics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FBI plea" /&gt; The FBI said that they were doing this in part to limit harm to people wrongly identified by news reports and on social-media.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-175" /&gt;
As seen on video, the suspects stayed to observe the chaos after the explosions, then walked away casually. The public sent authorities a deluge of photographs and videos, which were scrutinized by both authorities and online public [[social networking service|social networks]].&lt;ref name="FBI plea" /&gt;

A few hours after the photos were released, the Tsarnaev brothers shot Sean A. Collier of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department]] six times&lt;ref name="admits" /&gt; in an attempt to steal his gun, which they could not get out because of the holster's retention system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police believe Tsarnaev brothers killed officer for his gun|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-57581048/police-believe-tsarnaev-brothers-killed-officer-for-his-gun/|publisher=CBS News|date=April 23, 2013 |accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collier, aged 27, was seated in his police car near the [[Stata Center]] (Building 32) on the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] campus.&lt;ref name="NY Times Standoff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lowery" /&gt; He died soon after.&lt;ref name="NY Times Standoff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-58" /&gt;

The Tsarnaev brothers forced Meng to use his [[ATM card]]s to obtain $800 in cash.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-60" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WashPost04192013" /&gt; They transferred objects to the Mercedes-Benz and one brother followed it in their Honda Civic,&lt;ref name="wsjdetails" /&gt; for which an [[all-points bulletin]] was issued.

=== Watertown shootout ===
Shortly after midnight on April 19, [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]] police officer Joseph Reynolds identified the brothers in the [[Honda]] Civic and the stolen SUV. A gunfight followed between the brothers and police arriving at the scene on the 100 block of Laurel St.&lt;ref name="captured" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times Standoff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Watertown firefight, Globe" /&gt; An estimated 200 to 300 rounds of ammunition were fired and at least one further bomb and several "crude [[grenade]]s" were thrown.&lt;ref name="Watertown firefight, Globe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-65" /&gt;

According to Watertown Police Chief Edward Deveau, the brothers had an "[[arsenal]] of guns."&lt;ref name="Tucson Citizen" /&gt; Tamerlan ran out of ammunition and threw his empty pistol at Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese, who tackled him with help from Sergeant John MacLellan.&lt;ref name="DeWitt2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=DeWitt|first1=Vincent|title=Watertown Mass.

A 20-block area of Watertown was [[Cordon and search|cordoned off]] and residents were told not to leave their homes or answer the door, as officers scoured the area in tactical gear. Helicopters circled the area and [[SWAT]] teams in [[armored vehicles]] moved through in formation, with officers going door to door.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-76" /&gt; On the scene were the FBI, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]], [[United States Department of Homeland Security|the Department of Homeland Security]], [[National Guard of the United States|the National Guard]], the Boston and Watertown Police departments, and the [[Massachusetts State Police]].

The brothers' father spoke from his home in [[Makhachkala]], [[Dagestan]], encouraging his son to: "Give up. Give up. You have a bright future ahead of you. Come home to Russia." He continued, "If they killed him, then all hell would break loose."&lt;ref name="AutoLC-80" /&gt; On television, Dzhokhar's uncle from [[Montgomery Village, Maryland]], pleaded with him to turn himself in.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-81" /&gt;

David Henneberry, a Watertown resident outside the search area, noticed that the tarp was loose on his parked boat on the evening of April 19, two hours after the shelter-in-place order had been lifted.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-83" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCboat" /&gt; He then saw a body lying inside the boat in a pool of blood.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-84" /&gt; Authorities surrounded the boat and a police helicopter verified movement through a [[thermal imaging]] device.&lt;ref name="captured" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-85" /&gt; The figure inside the boat started poking at the tarp, and police shot at the boat.&lt;ref name="AutoG4-1" /&gt;

Initial reports that the neck wound represented a suicide attempt were contradicted by his being unarmed.&lt;ref name="AutoG4-2" /&gt; The situation was chaotic according to a police source quoted by the ''[[Washington Post]]'', and the firing of weapons occurred during "the fog of war".&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; A subsequent review by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts provided this more specific summary: "One officer fired his weapon without appropriate authority in response to perceived movement in the boat, and surrounding officers followed suit in a round of 'contagious fire', assuming they were being fired on by the suspect. Weapons continued to be fired for several seconds until on scene supervisors ordered a ceasefire and regained control of the scene. The unauthorized shots created another dangerous crossfire situation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mass.gov/eopss/docs/mema/after-action-report-for-the-response-to-the-2013-boston-marathon-bombings.pdf |title=After Action Report for the Response to the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombings |date=December 2014 |website=Government of Massachusetts |publisher=Executive Office of Public Safety and Security |access-date=October 10, 2017 |quote=Improvement Area 4, Lack of Weapons Discipline, page 114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal proceedings ==

=== Interrogation ===
United States Senators [[Kelly Ayotte]], [[Saxby Chambliss]], [[Lindsey Graham]], and [[John McCain]], and Representative [[Peter T. King]] suggested that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a U.S. citizen, should be tried as an [[unlawful combatant|unlawful enemy combatant]] rather than as a criminal, potentially preventing him from obtaining [[Assistance of Counsel Clause|legal counsel]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-91" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-92" /&gt; Others said that doing so would be illegal, including prominent American legal scholar and lawyer [[Alan Dershowitz]], and would jeopardize the prosecution.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-93" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-94" /&gt; The government decided to try Dzhokhar in the federal criminal court system and not as an enemy combatant.&lt;ref name="CNN220130423" /&gt;

Dzhokhar was questioned for 16 hours by investigators but stopped communicating with them on the night of April 22 after Judge Marianne Bowler read him a [[Miranda warning]].&lt;ref name="Gorman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-103" /&gt; Dzhokhar had not previously been given a Miranda warning, as federal law enforcement officials invoked the warning's [[public safety exception]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-90" /&gt; This raised doubts whether his statements during this investigation would be admissible as evidence and led to a debate surrounding Miranda rights.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- this article's misspelling of "Dzhokhar" is [sic] --&gt;{{cite news|title=The Right to Remain Silent: Dzokhar Tsarnaev, the Public Safety Exception, and Miranda in a post-911 World|url=http://www.marathonlawdenver.com/2013/04/22/dzokharpublicsafetyexceptionmiranda/|newspaper=Marathon Law|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613153900/http://www.marathonlawdenver.com/2013/04/22/dzokharpublicsafetyexceptionmiranda/|date=April 22, 2013|archivedate=June 13, 2013|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Andrew|title=Tsarnaev Without Tears: The Legal Way Forward|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/04/tsarnaev-without-tears-the-legal-way-forward/275160/|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=April 20, 2013 |accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bazelon|first=Emily|title=Why Should I Care That No One's Reading Dzhokhar Tsarnaev His Miranda Rights?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2013/04/dzhokhar_tsarnaev_and_miranda_rights_the_public_safety_exception_and_terrorism.html|newspaper=Slate|date=April 19, 2013 |accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, 2013, formal criminal charges were brought against Tsarnaev in the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts]] during a bedside hearing while he was hospitalized.

Jury selection began on January 5, 2015 and was completed on March 3, with a jury consisting of eight men and ten women (including six alternates).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/02/20/opening-statements-tsarnaev-trial-could-begin-early-march-official-says/4TZWH4KMZY2nXaHLPywTMN/story.html|title=Opening statements in Tsarnaev trial could begin in early March, official says – Metro – The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial began on March 4 with Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb describing the bombing and painting Dzhokhar as "a soldier in a holy war against Americans" whose motive was "reaching paradise". He called the brothers equal participants.&lt;ref name=trial&gt;{{cite proceedings|section-url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1681443/tsarnaev-dzkokhar-trial-transcript-3-4-2015.pdf|title=United States v.

Defense attorney [[Judy Clarke]] admitted that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had placed the second bomb and was present at the murder of Sean Collier, the carjacking of Dun Meng, and the Watertown shootout, but she emphasized the influence that his older brother had on him, portraying him as a follower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite proceedings|chapter-url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1681442/tsarnaev-dzkokhar-trial-transcript-3-4-2015-clarke.pdf |title=United States v.

== Motives and backgrounds of Tsarnaev brothers ==

=== Motives ===
According to FBI interrogators, Dzhokhar and his brother were motivated by Islamic beliefs but "were not connected to any known terrorist groups", instead learning to build explosive weapons from an online magazine published by [[al-Qaeda]] affiliates in Yemen.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-8" /&gt; They further alleged that "[Dzhokhar and] his brother considered suicide attacks and striking [the Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular] on the Fourth of July;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boston Plotters Said to Initially Target July 4 for Attack|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/us/Boston-bombing-suspects-planned-july-fourth-attack.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 2, 2013 |accessdate= April 11, 2015|first1=Eric|last1=Schmitt|first2=Mark|last2=Mazzetti|first3=Michael S.|last3=Schmidt|first4=Scott|last4=Shane}}&lt;/ref&gt; but ultimately decided to use pressure cooker bombs (capable of remote detonation) and other IEDs." Fox News reported that the brothers "chose the prestigious race as a 'target of opportunity' ...

Dzhokhar said that he and his brother wanted to defend Islam from the U.S., accusing the U.S. of conducting the [[Iraq War]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] against Muslims.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-98" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN220130423" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoG4-3" /&gt; A CBS report revealed that Dzhokhar had scrawled a note with a marker on the interior wall of the boat where he was hiding; the note stated that the bombings were "retribution for U.S. military action in Afghanistan and Iraq", and called the Boston victims "[[collateral damage]]", "in the same way innocent victims have been collateral damage in U.S. wars around the world."&lt;ref name="cbs20130516" /&gt;&lt;ref name="consortium_mcgovern"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consortiumnews.com/2013/05/17/boston-suspects-writing-on-the-wall/|title=Boston Suspect’s Writing on the Wall|work=consortiumnews.com|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs of the note were later used in the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=CBS Local Boston|url=http://boston.cbslocal.com/2015/03/10/jury-in-boston-bombing-trial-sees-photos-of-writing-in-boat/|accessdate=March 12, 2017|title=Boston Marathon Bombing Trial Jury Sees Photos Of Tsarnaev Boat Note|date=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT20130516&gt;{{cite news|title=Note by Boston Bombing Suspect Sheds Light on Motive, Officials Say|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/us/boston-bombing-developments.html|newspaper=The New York Times | first1=Scott|last1=Shane|first2=Ellen|last2=Barry|date=May 16, 2013 |accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some political science and public policy writers suggest that Islam may have played a secondary role in the attacks.&lt;ref name="Secondary"&gt;{{cite news |title= Islam might have had secondary role in Boston attacks |first= Lisa |last= Wangsness  |author2= Brian Ballou |url= https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/04/19/scholars-caution-against-drawing-easy-religious-conclusions-about-suspects-boston-marathon-bombings/a5Iucv4ntQHgSvXchQqKOM/story.html |newspaper= The Boston Globe |date= April 20, 2013 | accessdate= April 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These writers theorize that the primary motives might have been sympathy towards the political aspirations in the Caucasus region and Tamerlan's inability to become fully integrated into American society.&lt;ref name="Secondary" /&gt; According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', a law enforcement official said that Dzhokhar "did not seem as bothered about America's role in the Muslim world" as his brother Tamerlan had been.&lt;ref name="la-times-suspect-describes-plot" /&gt; Dzhokhar identified Tamerlan as the "driving force" behind the bombing, and said that his brother had only recently recruited him to help.&lt;ref name="CNN220130423" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-102" /&gt;

Some journalists and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's defense attorney have suggested that the FBI may have recruited or attempted to recruit Tamerlan Tsarnaev as an informant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2017/04/09/tamerlan-tsarnaev-fbi-informant/| author=Michele McPhee| title=Tamerlan Tsarnaev: Terrorist.

{{See also|Tamerlan Tsarnaev#Personal background|Dzhokhar Tsarnaev#Personal background}}
Tamerlan Tsarnaev was born in 1986 in the [[Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]], [[North Caucasus]].&lt;ref name="Wall Street Journal" /&gt; Dzhokhar was born in 1993 in [[Kyrgyzstan]], although some reports say that his family claims that he was born in [[Dagestan]].&lt;ref name="GuardianBirthplace" /&gt; The family spent time in [[Tokmok]], Kyrgyzstan, and in [[Makhachkala]], Dagestan.&lt;ref name="WashPost04192013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SullivanAP04192013" /&gt;
They are half [[Chechen people|Chechen]] through their father Anzor, and half [[Avar people (Caucasus)|Avar]]&lt;ref name=thestarCarus /&gt; through their mother Zubeidat. They never lived in [[Chechnya]], yet the brothers identified themselves as Chechen.&lt;ref name="GuardianBirthplace" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes04192013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPost04192013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPostNoronha04192013" /&gt;

The Tsarnaev family [[Immigration to the United States|immigrated]] to the United States in 2002&lt;ref name="NY Times Standoff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes04192013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-105" /&gt; where they applied for [[Asylum in the United States|political asylum]], settling in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="AtlanticWire04192013" /&gt; Tamerlan Tsarnaev attended [[Bunker Hill Community College]] but dropped out to become a boxer. His goal was to gain a place on the U.S. Olympic boxing team, saying that, "unless his native [[Chechnya]] becomes independent", he would "rather compete for the United States than for Russia".&lt;ref name="thecomment" /&gt;&lt;ref name="deadspin" /&gt; He married U.S. citizen Katherine Russell on July 15, 2010 in the Masjid Al Quran Mosque&lt;ref name="Auto9P-3" /&gt; in the [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] section of Boston; she was pregnant with their daughter.&lt;ref name="mailonline" /&gt; While initially quoted in a student magazine as saying, "I don't have a single American friend. I don't understand them," a later FBI interview report documents Tamerlan stating it was a misquote, and that most of his friends were American.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://vault.fbi.gov/tamerlan-tsarnaev|title=Tamerlan Tsarnaev|work=FBI|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/11/us/tamerlan-tsarnaev-fbi-boston-marathon-interview/index.html|title=Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev told FBI he never picked a fight|last=CNN|first=Eric Levenson,|work=CNN|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He had a history of violence, including an arrest in July 2009 for assaulting his girlfriend.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-107" /&gt;

The brothers were [[Muslim]]; Tamerlan's aunt stated that he had recently become a devout Muslim.&lt;ref name="HuffPost04192013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPostNoronha04192013" /&gt; Tamerlan became more devout and religious after 2009,&lt;ref name="cnn20130420" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyd20130421" /&gt; and a YouTube channel in his name linked to [[Salafi movement|Salafist]]&lt;ref name="cnn20130420" /&gt; and [[Islamism|Islamist]]&lt;ref name="mailonline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes20130420" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-108" /&gt; videos. The FBI was informed by the Russian [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|Federal Security Service]] (FSB) in 2011 that he was a "follower of radical Islam."&lt;ref name="NYTimes20130420" /&gt; In response, the FBI interviewed Tamerlan and his family and searched databases, but they did not find any evidence of "terrorism activity, domestic or foreign."&lt;ref name="AutoLC-109" /&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes20130420" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-110" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-111" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP FSB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Englund20130420" /&gt; During the 2012 trip to Dagestan, Tamerlan was reportedly a frequent visitor at a mosque on Kotrova Street in [[Makhachkala]],&lt;ref name="AutoLC-112" /&gt;&lt;ref name=dailybeastcaucasus /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-113" /&gt; believed by the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]] to be linked with radical Islam.&lt;ref name="dailybeastcaucasus" /&gt; Some believe that "they were motivated by their faith, apparently an anti-American, radical version of Islam" acquired in the U.S.,&lt;ref name="AutoLC-114" /&gt; while others believe that the turn happened in Dagestan.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-115" /&gt;

At the time of the bombing, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a student at the [[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth]] with a major in [[marine biology]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-116" /&gt; He became a naturalized U.S. citizen on September 11, 2012.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-117" /&gt; Tamerlan's boxing coach reported to NBC that the young brother was greatly affected by Tamerlan and admired him.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-118" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-119" /&gt;

Tamerlan was previously connected to [[2011 Waltham triple murder|the triple homicide]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], on the evening of September 11, 2011, but he was not a suspect at the time.&lt;ref name=probe&gt;{{cite news|url=http://boston.com/metrodesk/2013/04/22/police-probe-possible-link-between-marathon-bomber-and-unsolved-triple-homicide-waltham/T6MgaX0lur7plZrGj0HsvO/story.html|first=Michael|last=Rezendes|title=Police probe possible link between Marathon bomber and unsolved triple homicide in Waltham|work=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=April 22, 2013|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/boston-bombing-brings-twist-cold-murder-case/story?id=19063282&amp;page=2#.UYgiLLWkoXE |title=Boston Bombing Brings Twist to Cold Murder Case |publisher=ABC News |date=April 29, 2013 |accessdate=May 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brendan Mess]], [[Erik Weissman]], and [[Raphael Teken]] were murdered in Mess's apartment.

Some analysts claim that the Tsarnaev's mother Zubeidat Tsarnaeva is a radical extremist and supporter of jihad who influenced her sons' behavior.&lt;ref name="Auto9P-4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto9P-5" /&gt; This prompted the Russian government to warn the U.S. government on two occasions about the family's behavior. Both Tamerlan and his mother were placed on a terrorism watch list about 18 months before the bombing took place.&lt;ref name="AutoQU-8" /&gt;

== Other arrests, detentions, and prosecutions ==

=== People detained and released ===
On April 15, several people who were near the scene of the blast were taken into custody and questioned about the bombing, including a Saudi man whom police stopped as he was walking away from the explosion; they detained him when some of his responses made them uncomfortable.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-120" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-121" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-122" /&gt; Law enforcement searched his residence in a Boston suburb, and the man was found to have no connection to the attack. An unnamed U.S. official said, "he was just at the wrong place at the wrong time."&lt;ref name="Fox News1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN_FBI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-123" /&gt;

On the night of April 18, two men riding in a taxi in the vicinity of the shootout were arrested and released shortly thereafter when police determined that they were not involved in the Marathon attacks.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-124" /&gt; Another man was arrested several blocks from the site of the shootout and was forced to [[Strip search|strip naked]] by police who feared that he might have concealed explosives. He was released that evening after a brief investigation determined that he was an innocent bystander.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-125" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-126" /&gt;

=== Dias Kadyrbayev, Azamat Tazhayakov, and Robel Phillipos ===

==== Personal backgrounds ====
Robel Phillipos (19) was a U.S. citizen of [[Ethiopian American|Ethiopian descent]] living in Cambridge who was arrested and faced with charges of knowingly [[making false statements]] to police.&lt;ref name="businessinsider" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USA.Friend"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/05/01/boston-marathon-bombings-tsarnaev-phillipos/2127469/|title=Bomb suspect's friend Robel Phillipos: Who is he?|last=Winter|first=Michael|date=May 1, 2013|work=[[USA Today]] | accessdate=January 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from high school in 2011 with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.&lt;ref name="Auto9P-6" /&gt;
Dias Kadyrbayev (19) and Azamat Tazhayakov (20) were natives of [[Kazakhstan]] living in the U.S.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-127" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-128" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoQU-10" /&gt; They were Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's roommates in an off-campus housing complex in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]] at which Tsarnaev had sometimes stayed.&lt;ref name="businessinsider" /&gt;

Phillipos, Kadyrbayev, Tazhayakov, and Tsarnaev entered the [[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth]] in the fall of 2011 and knew each other well. After seeing photos of Tsarnaev on television, the three men traveled to his dorm room where they retrieved a backpack and laptop belonging to Tsarnaev. The backpack was discarded, but police recovered it and its contents in a nearby New Bedford landfill on April 26. During interviews, the men initially denied visiting the dorm room but later admitted their actions.&lt;ref name="businessinsider" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt;

==== Arrests and legal proceedings ====
Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were arrested by police at the off-campus housing complex during the night of April 18–19. An unidentified girlfriend of one of the men was also arrested,&lt;ref name="AutoLC-127" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-128" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoQU-10" /&gt; but all three were soon released.&lt;ref name="businessinsider" /&gt;

Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were re-arrested in New Bedford on April 20 and held on immigration-related violations. They appeared before a federal [[immigration judge]] on May 1 and were charged with overstaying their [[student visa]]s.&lt;ref name="AutoQU-11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-129" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-130" /&gt; That same day, Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were charged criminally with:

Tazhayakov pleaded not guilty and went to trial, arguing that "Kadyrbayev was the mastermind behind destroying the evidence and that Tazhayakov only 'attempted obstruction.'" Jurors returned a guilty verdict against him, however, and he was sentenced to 42 months in prison in June 2015, which equated to three and a half years.

=== Khairullozhon Matanov ===
A federal indictment was unsealed against Khairullozhon Matanov on May 30, 2014, charging him with "one count of destroying, altering, and falsifying records, documents, and tangible objects in a federal investigation, specifically information on his computer, and three counts of making materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements in a federal terrorism investigation." Matanov bought dinner for the two Tsarnaev brothers 40 minutes after the bombing.  After the Tsarnaev brothers' photos were released to the public, Matanov viewed the photos on the CNN and FBI websites before attempting to reach Dzhokhar, and then tried to give away his cell phone and delete hundreds of documents from his computer. Prosecutors said that Matanov attempted to mislead investigators about the nature of his relationship with the brothers and to conceal that he shared their philosophy of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/30/justice/boston-marathon-bombings-charges/|title=Massachusetts man charged with obstructing Boston bombings probe|first=Jason|last=Hanna|first2=Mariano|last2=Castillo|date=May 30, 2014|work=CNN|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LySentenceJune"&gt;{{cite news|first=Laura|last=Ly|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/18/us/tsarnaev-friend-sentence/|title=Friend of Boston marathon bombers gets 30-month sentence|work=CNN|date=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matanov was originally from Kyrgyzstan. He came to the U.S. in 2010 on a [[student visa]], and later claimed asylum.

Five years after the bombing, The Boston Globe reported all of the items from the memorials were being housed in a climate controlled environment, free of charge, by the storage company, [[Iron Mountain (company)|Iron Mountain]] in [[Northborough, Massachusetts]]. Some of the items are also being stored in Boston's city archives in [[West Roxbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ramos |first=Nestor |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/04/14/fragments-tragedy-and-our-best-selves/gtnbkn7MiT91kYzFL1MBOL/story.html |title=Fragments of tragedy, and of our best selves |work=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=2018-04-14 |accessdate=2018-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study conducted by the Institute for Public Service at [[Suffolk University]] in Boston, Massachusetts, records the mental health and emotional response of various survivors, for three years following the bombing. In doing so, it reviews the kinds of aid that were available in local hospitals and gives advice as to how a person or community may be healed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu:2048/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=5&amp;sid=3e680122-e67a-4fed-8ffc-a8b9572a7c67%40sessionmgr4007|title=The mental health response to the Boston bombing: A three-year review|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This study also mentions that after realizing the under coverage of people in the city being killed or injured on a daily basis, the city of Boston "applied for and received a grant from The Rockefeller Foundation to be part of their 100 resilient cities network and to develop a cross cutting resilience strategy".

However, there was rising [[anti-Muslim sentiment]] online and locally in the weeks following the bombing, causing distress in the local [[Muslim]] community and leaving some afraid of going out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhattacharyya|first1=Sriya|last2=Ashby|first2=Kimberly M.|last3=Goodman|first3=Lisa A.|title=Social Justice Beyond the Classroom|journal=The Counseling Psychologist|date=26 September 2014|volume=42|issue=8|pages=1136–1158|doi=10.1177/0011000014551420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National ===
President [[Barack Obama]] addressed the nation after the attack.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-137" /&gt; He said that the perpetrators were still unknown, but that the government would "get to the bottom of this" and that those responsible "will feel the full weight of justice".&lt;ref name="AutoLC-138" /&gt; He ordered flags to half-staff until April 20 on all federal buildings as "a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence perpetrated on April 15, 2013 in Boston, Massachusetts."&lt;ref name="AutoLC-140" /&gt;

=== International ===
[[File:US flag flying at half mast in Milan, 2013.JPG|thumb|upright|Flag flying at half staff at the American consulate in [[Milan]], Italy]]
The bombing was denounced and condolences were offered by many international leaders as well as leading figures from international sport. Security measures were increased worldwide in the wake of the attack.&lt;ref name="oregon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-144" /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph_wl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SI_1" /&gt;

In China, users posted condolence messages on [[Sina Weibo|Weibo]] in response to the death of Lü Lingzi.&lt;ref name="newyorkFan" /&gt; Chris Buckley of ''The New York Times'' said "Ms. Lu's death gave a melancholy face to the attraction that America and its colleges exert over many young Chinese."&lt;ref name="Buckley" /&gt; Laurie Burkitt of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' said "Ms. Lu's death resonates with many in China" due to the [[one-child policy]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-146" /&gt;

Organizers of the [[2013 London Marathon|London Marathon]], which was held six days after the Boston bombing, reviewed security arrangements for their event. Hundreds of extra police officers were drafted in to provide a greater presence on the streets, and a record 700,000 spectators lined the streets. Runners in London observed a 30-second silence in respect for the victims of Boston shortly before the race began, and many runners wore black ribbons on their vests. Organizers also pledged to donate US$3 to a fund for Boston Marathon victims for every person who finished the race.&lt;ref name="Katz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-147" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-148" /&gt;

Organizers of the 2013 [[Vancouver Sun Run]], which was held on April 21, 2013, donated $10 from every late entry for the race to help victims of the bombing at the Boston Marathon. Jamie Pitblado, vice-president of promotions for The Vancouver Sun and The Province, said the money would go to One Fund Boston, an official charity that collected donations for the victims and their families. Sun Run organizers raised anywhere from $25,000 to $40,000. There were over 48,000 participants, many dressed in blue and yellow (Boston colors) with others wearing Boston Red Sox caps.&lt;ref name="Auto9P-8" /&gt;

[[Petr Gandalovic]], ambassador of the Czech Republic, released a statement after noticing much confusion on Facebook and Twitter between his nation and the Chechen Republic. "The Czech Republic and Chechnya are two very different entities – the Czech Republic is a Central European country; Chechnya is a part of the Russian Federation."&lt;ref name="AutoLC-152" /&gt;

Security was also stepped up in Singapore in response to online threats made on attacking several locations in the city-state and the Singapore Marathon in December. Two suspects were investigated and one was eventually arrested for making false bomb threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/international/singapore-hit-by-bomb-hoaxes-after-boston-attacks/ |title=Singapore Hit By Bomb Hoaxes After Boston Attacks|accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Republican U.S. Senators [[Saxby Chambliss]] and [[Richard Burr]] reported that Russian authorities had separately asked both the FBI (at least twice: during March and November 2011) and the CIA (September 2011) to look carefully into Tamerlan Tsarnaev and provide more information about him back to Russia.&lt;ref name="BG-RUS"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2013/04/23/russia-contacted-fbi-multiple-times-concerns-about-alleged-boston-marathon-bomber/ND0bhUdq1Tp1mRuC8xlb8N/story.html |title = Russia contacted US government ‘multiple’ times|author1=Bender, Bryan |author2= Bierman, Noah|work=The Boston Globe|date= April 23, 2013|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RT-RUS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/usa/fbi-boston-senate-hearing-263/ |title= Senate grills FBI over Boston bombings intel failures|work=RT|date=April 23, 2013|accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB) secretly recorded phone conversations between [[Tamerlan Tsarnaev]] and his mother (they vaguely and indirectly discussed jihad) and sent these to the FBI as evidence of possible extremist links within the family.&lt;ref name="Boston-RUSS"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://rt.com/usa/tsarnaev-mother-wiretap-jihad-519/ |title=

In addition, subsequent U.S. requests for additional information about Tsarnaev went unanswered by the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Radia|first=Kirit|title=Lawmakers Traveling to Russia to Investigate Boston Bombing|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/05/lawmakers-traveling-to-russia-to-investigate-boston-bombing/|newspaper=ABC News|date=May 21, 2013 |accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chechen reactions ====
On April 19, 2013, the press-secretary of the [[head of the Chechen Republic]], [[Ramzan Kadyrov]], issued a statement that, inter alia, read: "The Boston bombing suspects have nothing to do with Chechnya".&lt;ref name="AutoLC-153" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-154" /&gt; On the same day, Kadyrov was reported by ''[[The Guardian]]'' to have written on [[Instagram]]:&lt;ref name="AutoLC-155" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Any attempt to make a link between Chechnya and the Tsarnaevs, if they are guilty, is in vain. They grew up in the U.S., their views and beliefs were formed there. The roots of evil must be searched for in America. The whole world must battle with terrorism. We know this better than anyone. We wish recover {{sic}} to all the victims and share Americans' feeling of sorrow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Akhmed Zakayev]], head of the secular wing of the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Chechen separatist movement]], now in exile in London, condemned the bombing as "terrorist" and expressed condolences to the families of the victims. Zakayev denied that the bombers were in any way representative of the Chechen people, saying that "the Chechen people never had and can not have any hostile feelings toward the United States and its citizens."&lt;ref name="AutoLC-156" /&gt;

The [[Caucasus Emirate|Mujahideen of the Caucasus Emirate Province of Dagestan]], the [[North Caucasian Federal District|Caucasian]] Islamist organization in both Chechnya and Dagestan, denied any link to the bombing or the Tsarnaev brothers and stated that it was at war with Russia, not the United States. It also said that it had sworn off violence against civilians since 2012.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-157" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-158" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-159" /&gt;

=== Criticism of "shelter-in-place" directive and house-to-house searches ===
During the manhunt for the perpetrators of the bombing, Governor [[Deval Patrick]] said "we are asking people to shelter in place." The request was highly effective; most people stayed home, causing Boston, Watertown, and Cambridge to come to a virtual standstill. According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, "media described residents complying with a 'lockdown order,' but in reality the governor's security measure was a request." [[Scott Silliman]], emeritus director of the Center on Law, Ethics and National Security at Duke Law School, said that the shelter-in-place request was voluntary.&lt;ref name="Rawlings"&gt;{{cite web|first=Nate|last=Rawlings|url=http://nation.time.com/2013/04/19/was-boston-actually-on-lockdown/|title=Was Boston Actually on Lockdown?|work=Time|date=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shelter-in-place directive was criticized by some commentators. Michael Cohen of ''[[The Observer]]'' said that Americans have little experience with daily terrorism compared to some countries and "are more primed to … assume the absolute worst."&lt;ref name="observerCriticalReaction" /&gt; Cohen wrote that it was not the first time dangerous murderers have been on the loose in a large American city (citing [[Christopher Dorner]] in 2013 and the [[Beltway sniper attacks]] in 2002), but noted that "lockdown" measures were not used in those cases.&lt;ref name="observerCriticalReaction" /&gt;  Former congressman and presidential candidate [[Ron Paul]], criticized what he described as a "military-style takeover of parts of Boston" during the investigation and wrote that "this unprecedented move should frighten us as much or more than the attack itself."&lt;ref name="RPaul" /&gt;

''[[Haaretz]]''{{-'}}s Chemi Salev wrote that "in terms of cost-benefit analysis, from the evil terrorist's point of view, the Boylston Street bombings and their aftermath can only be viewed as a resounding triumph" since the "relatively amateurish" terrorists managed to intimidate a vast number of people and got a maximum amount of publicity.&lt;ref name="Haaretz" /&gt; Responding to Salev in ''The New York Times'', [[Ross Douthat]] commented that the massive manhunt operation might deter other amateur terrorists, but not hard-core terrorists such as [[Mohammed Atta]].&lt;ref name="DouthatNYTimes" /&gt; Douthat argued that out-of-the-ordinary measures can only be used when terrorism itself is out-of-the-ordinary: if attacks started to occur more often, people would not be as willing to comply with shelter-in-place commands, yet once a terrorist has been hunted with such an operation, it is hard to justify why such measures should not be taken the next time.&lt;ref name="DouthatNYTimes" /&gt;

The [[National Lawyers Guild]] and some news outlets questioned the constitutionality of the door-to-door searches conducted by law enforcement officers looking for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://archive.boston.com/yourtown/news/watertown/2013/11/lawyers_to_speak_about_unconstitutional_watertown_home_searc.html| author=Jaclyn Reiss| title=Lawyers raising questions about Watertown home searches following Marathon bombings, shootout| publisher=Boston Globe| date=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/watertown-door-door-search-bombing-suspects-violation-fourth-140043137.html?ref=gs| author=Liz Klimas| title=Was Watertown’s Door-to-Door Search for Bombing Suspects a Violation of the Fourth Amendment?| publisher=Yahoo News| date=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/04/22/the-police-response-to-the-boston-marathon-bombing/| author=Radley Balko| title=Was the police response to the Boston bombing really appropriate?| publisher=The Washington Post| date=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflicting reports ==
[[File:Boston Marathon bombings news conference.jpg|thumb|left|[[Boston Police Department#List of Boston Police Commissioners|Boston Police Commissioner]] [[Edward F. Davis]] gives a [[news conference]] about the bombing on April 15. Governor [[Deval Patrick]] is second from right and Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley is at far left.]]

On the afternoon of the bombing, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that a suspect, a Saudi Arabian male, was under guard and being questioned at a Boston hospital.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-160" /&gt; That evening, Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said that there had not been an arrest.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-163" /&gt; The ''Post'' did not retract its story about the suspect, leading to widespread reports by CBS News, CNN, and other media that a Middle Eastern suspect was in custody.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-164" /&gt; The day after the bombing, a majority of outlets were reporting that the Saudi was a witness, not a suspect.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-165" /&gt;

The ''New York Post'' on its April 18 front page showed two men, and said they were being sought by the authorities. The two were not the ones being sought as suspects. They were a 17-year-old boy and his track coach. The boy, from [[Revere, Massachusetts]], turned himself over to the police immediately and was cleared after a 20-minute interview in which they advised him to deactivate his Facebook account.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-169" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; ''New York Post'' editor [[Col Allan]] stated, "We stand by our story. The image was emailed to law enforcement agencies yesterday afternoon seeking information about these men, as our story reported. We did not identify them as suspects." The two were implied to be possible suspects via [[crowdsourcing]] on the websites [[Reddit]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; and [[4chan]].&lt;ref name="Reconsidering the Internet detectives in Boston manhunt on Reddit and 4Chan: the benefits and pitfalls" /&gt;

Several other people were mistakenly identified as suspects.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-170" /&gt; Two of those wrongly identified as suspects on Reddit were a 17-year-old track star and [[Sunil Tripathi]], a [[Brown University]] student missing since March.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-171" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Missing Brown University student's family dragged into virally fueled false accusation in Boston" /&gt; Tripathi was found dead on April 23 in the [[Providence River]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-172" /&gt;

On April 17, the FBI released the following statement:
{{Quote|Contrary to widespread reporting, no arrest has been made in connection with the Boston Marathon attack. Over the past day and a half, there have been a number of press reports based on information from unofficial sources that has been inaccurate. Since these stories often have unintended consequences, we ask the media, particularly at this early stage of the investigation, to exercise caution and attempt to verify information through appropriate official channels before reporting.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-173" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-174" /&gt;}}

The decision to release the photos of the Tsarnaev brothers was made in part to limit damage done to those misidentified on the Internet and by the media, and to address concerns over maintaining control of the manhunt.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-175" /&gt;

== Film adaptation ==
A film about the Boston Marathon bombing and subsequent manhunt, ''[[Patriots Day (film)|Patriots Day]]'', was released in December 2016. Another film, ''[[Stronger (film)|Stronger]]'', which chronicles survivor [[Jeff Bauman]], was released in September 2017.

During the [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651), [[Bristol]] was a key port on the west coast of England and considered strategically important by both [[Cavaliers|Royalists]] and [[Roundheads|Parliamentarians]]. Initially, the leadership of Bristol wanted to keep the city neutral in the conflict. In 1642, city officials implored Thomas Essex not to occupy the city with his Parliamentarian forces. The city was weakly defended, and Essex entered without much resistance.{{sfn|Lynch|2013}}{{Page needed|date=May 2016}} During the conflict, Bristol was used as a receiving point for the Royalists to accept reinforcements from Ireland.{{sfn|Gaunt|2014|p=105}} The town was well fortified by the [[River Frome, Bristol|Frome]] and [[River Avon (Bristol)|Avon]] rivers, as well as a [[Bristol Castle|medieval castle]], which had been bought by the corporation when the [[First English Civil War]] broke out in 1642, and during the Parliamentary defense, earthen artillery forts.{{sfn|Gaunt|2014|p=147}}

In these years, Bristol failed to play the important role that might have been expected from a large and rich port. However, the populace had no relish for a civil war in which men were fighting for reasons which did not fill most citizens of Bristol with any great enthusiasm.{{sfn|Lynch|2013|p=3}}

[[Royal Fort House]] was built on the site of two [[bastion]]s on the inside of the lines and three on the outside which were fought over during the English Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Fort, St Michael’s Hill, Part 1|url=http://www.baras.org.uk/royal-fort-bristol-part-one|publisher=Bristol and Region Archaeological Services|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the strongest part of the defenses of Bristol, designed by Dutch military engineer [[Bernard de Gomme|Sir Bernard de Gomme]]. It was one of the few purpose-built defensive works of the war era. The fort was designed as the western headquarters of the Royalist army under [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bristol|url=http://www.fortified-places.com/bristol.html|publisher=Fortified Places|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was demolished in 1655.

For Bristol, the central event of the war was the [[Storming of Bristol]] by Royalist forces in 1643. The Royalist suffered heavy casualties taking the city, especially among regimental and brigade commanders. After the capture, the city became an important Royalist supply base, and center for communication, administration, and manufacture. The Royalists were dependent on foreign aid and the importation of weaponry. Ships laden with ordnance had to evade Parliamentarian patrols in order to offload their cargo at Bristol.{{sfn|Lynch|2013}}{{Page needed|date=May 2016}}

A typical myth about Bristol during the civil war concerns it capture by Prince Rupert in July 1643. Traditionally it has been accepted that Bristol was attacked by a Royalist army of up to 20,000 men and that William Walker had irresponsibly reduced the garrison to 1,500 infantry and 300 mounted troops, insufficient to man the defensive lines surrounding the city. It is further accepted that these defenses were inadequate and that their weakness was compounded by a serious shortage of ammunition. Despite these problems the Royalists breached the defenses by the chance of discovery of a weak point unknown to the defenders. Once the line was breached, the city was indefensible and the garrison commander, [[Nathaniel Fiennes]], surrendered the city to save his troops and civilian populations; although this account was shown to be inaccurate shortly after the event, it has retained some credibility.{{sfn|Lynch|2013|p=3}}

* Fiennes surrendered to Rupert. For this, he was court-martialled, convicted, and sentenced to death.

In the summer of 1645, Royalist forces were defeated by the [[New Model Army]] at the [[Battle of Langport]], in [[Somerset]].  Following further victories at [[Bridgwater]] and [[Sherborne]], [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Sir Thomas Fairfax]] marched on Bristol. Prince Rupert returned to organise the defence of the city. The Parliamentary forces besieged the city and after three weeks attacked, eventually forcing Rupert to surrender on 10 September.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1460">The '''Cruelty to Animals Act 1849''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] (12 &amp; 13 Vict. c. 92) with the [[long title]] ''An Act for the more effectual Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.'' 

The Act repealed two previous Acts, the [[Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822]] and the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1835]], and reiterated the offences of beating, ill-treating, over-driving, abusing and torturing animals with a maximum penalty of £5 and compensation of up to £10.
The Act was amended and including a prison sentence for the unlawful killing of any animals covers within the law and expanded by the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1876]], and repealed by the [[Protection of Animals Act 1911]].

The '''Dakar Series''' is an annual series of [[rally raid]] off-road races, organised by the [[Amaury Sport Organisation]]. The series groups together events similar in style to the [[Dakar Rally]] and was founded in 2008 after the cancellation of the [[2008 Dakar Rally|2008 edition]] of the rally.

Webb was a fugitive featured on the [[FBI]]'s 10 Most Wanted List until 2007, setting a record on that list in 1999, but he was never apprehended. In 2010, his record on that list was superseded by another criminal. The murder of Police Chief Adams was never solved by prosecution of the criminal; it was the longest-running cold case of a police officer in the country. In July 2017, Webb's remains were discovered in Massachusetts on the property of his wife Lillian Webb. She had hidden him in two of her homes for 17 years, until he died of a stroke in 1999.

== Background and family ==
Donald Eugene Perkins was born in [[Oklahoma City]] in 1931. He was raised by his paternal grandfather.&lt;ref name="walsh"&gt;{{cite web |first=Diane |last=Bartley |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-8971465.html |title=John Walsh: fighting back. |publisher=''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' |date=April 1, 1990 |format=Fee required |accessdate=September 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perkins enlisted in the [[United States Navy]], but received a [[dishonorable discharge]].&lt;ref name="search"&gt;{{cite web|first=Chuck |last=Biedka |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_400712.html |title=A frustrating search |publisher=''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' |date=December 4, 2005 |accessdate=September 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214182935/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_400712.html |archivedate=February 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perkins legally changed his name to Webb in 1956 in [[Bristol County, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="mystery"&gt;{{cite web |first=Jerry |last=Roberts |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=61ANAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-20DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1909,1569300|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130124154117/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=61ANAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-20DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1909,1569300|dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 24, 2013 |title=Saxonburg police chief slay suspect still a mystery man |publisher=''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' |date=June 10, 1981 |accessdate=September 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Webb worked as a [[butcher]], [[salesman]], restaurant manager, and vending machine repairman.&lt;ref name="toledo"&gt;{{cite web |first=Howard |last=Scripps |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PIIUAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2961,8203400|title=Gray fox of fugitive's slaying, theft suspect |publisher=''[[The Blade (Toledo)|Toledo Blade]]'' |date=December 25, 1996 |accessdate=September 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1979, Webb spent extended periods in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]], [[New England]], and on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].&lt;ref name="mystery"/&gt; After Webb's disappearance in 1980, his relatives and criminal associates consistently refused to cooperate with investigators.&lt;ref name="toledo"/&gt;

Webb had married Lillian and they had a son together. In 1981, Webb's wife Lillian lived in [[Dartmouth, Massachusetts|South Dartmouth, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="mystery"/&gt; She worked as a saleswoman for a now-defunct [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]] box company.&lt;ref name="search"/&gt;{{Dead link|date=July 2012}} In 1999, it was reported that Lillian, her son, and other relatives of Donald Webb were living in the Boston area.&lt;ref name="record"&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael A. |last=Fuoco |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0m0xAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5373%2C3526008 |title=Fugitive sets record on FBI's 10 Most Wanted list |publisher=''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' |date=September 14, 1999 |accessdate=September 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criminal career ==
Webb had convictions for burglary, possession of [[counterfeit money]], possession of a weapon and dangerous instruments, [[burglary|breaking and entering]], armed [[bank robbery]], grand [[larceny]] and car theft.&lt;ref name="mystery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="slayer"&gt;{{cite web |first=Jerry |last=Roberts |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WEUNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6830,4908702|title=Chief's slayer eluding police |publisher=''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' |date=July 30, 1981 |accessdate=September 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1970s, Webb served a two-year prison term in New York state prison.&lt;ref name="pittsburghpress"&gt;{{cite web |first=Matthew |last=Kennedy |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oIUqAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3523,2912282|title=Cop-Slaying Figure 'Career Criminal' |publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Press|The Pittsburgh Press]]'' |date=December 24, 1980 |accessdate=September 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI has considered Webb "a master of assumed identities".&lt;ref name="mystery"/&gt; New York and Pennsylvania police have described Webb as "an itinerant burglar well versed in the art of criminal impersonation".&lt;ref name="newdata"&gt;{{cite web |first=Chet |last=Wade |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4-sNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6905,2819077|title=New data on man charged in killing chief |publisher=''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' |date=January 20, 1981 |accessdate=September 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Webb was identified by the FBI as an associate of the [[Patriarca crime family]], who made a living robbing banks, jewelry stores, and high-end hotels up and down the East Coast. They fenced the goods through "the mob" in [[Providence, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wpri.com/2016/01/20/accused-of-killing-cop-ri-mob-associate-remains-on-the-lam/|title=Accused of killing cop, RI mob associate remains on the lam|first=Tim|last=White|date=20 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wpri.com/2017/06/02/widow-of-slain-police-chief-suing-ri-mob-associate-and-his-family/|title=Widow of slain police chief suing RI mob associate and his family|first=Diana|last=Pinzon|date=2 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also involved with an organized crime outfit in the Miami area, where he would also fence the goods.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1979, Webb and two accomplices allegedly burglarized suburban [[Albany, New York|Albany]] homes while posing as sewer and water inspectors. Webb and Frank Joseph Lach, one of the accomplices, were arrested in [[Colonie, New York]].&lt;ref name="mystery"/&gt; They were charged with attempted burglary, but after their bails were posted (bail of Webb was $35,000), they failed to appear at a December 1979 court date.&lt;ref name="pittsburghpress"/&gt;

=== Frank Lach ===
Frank Joseph Lach (born November 23, 1940) was closely associated with Webb. Lach is from [[Cranston, Rhode Island]]&lt;ref name="mystery"/&gt; and was believed to be involved with a Massachusetts-based gang responsible for a number of jewel thefts from residences and businesses in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as having ties to [[organized crime]] in New England and South Florida.&lt;ref name="federal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&amp;s_site=miami&amp;p_multi=MH&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB4D4214D271CE8&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D |title=Jewish federations celebrating successes |publisher=''[[Miami Herald]]'' |date=June 18, 1996 |format=Fee required |accessdate=September 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the last known connection of Webb and Lach was in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]] in July 1980, Lach was believed to be with Webb when he killed Police Chief Gregory Adams in December 1980 in Saxonburg. (See below)&lt;ref name="mystery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="justice"&gt;{{cite web |first=Jerry |last=Roberts |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=c-UNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7016,486780|title=2 years later, Saxonburg waits for justice |publisher=''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' |date=December 2, 1982 |accessdate=September 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lach was subsequently wanted by the FBI for interstate flight from justice; he was captured in [[South Miami, Florida]] in May 1982. He was extradited to New York, where he was convicted of burglary and bail-jumping.&lt;ref name="justice"/&gt; He was paroled in November 1985.&lt;ref name="DOC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nysdocslookup.docs.state.ny.us/ |title=Inmate Population Information Search |publisher=New York State Department of Correctional Services |accessdate=September 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420024026/http://nysdocslookup.docs.state.ny.us/ |archivedate=April 20, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1986, he was convicted by a federal jury of conspiracy to transport stolen property interstate,&lt;ref name="federal2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&amp;s_site=miami&amp;p_multi=MH&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB3648AA939691F&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D |title=Getaway car driver convicted in beating |publisher=''Miami Herald'' |date=February 28, 1986 |format=Fee required |accessdate=September 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[driving under the influence]] and parole violation in June 1996.&lt;ref name="federal"/&gt; Lach served time in federal prison and was released in October 2000.&lt;ref name="BOP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=IDSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;IDType=IRN&amp;IDNumber=12139-054&amp;x=60&amp;y=21 |title=Inmate Locator |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] |accessdate=September 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Murder of Gregory Adams ==
[[File:Gregory Adams.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Gregory Adams]]
On December 4, 1980, Gregory B. Adams, a 31-year-old [[Chief of police|police chief]] of [[Saxonburg, Pennsylvania]], and nine-year veteran of law enforcement, made a routine traffic stop in the [[parking lot]] of Agway Feed Store&lt;ref name="slayer"/&gt; on Butler Street.&lt;ref name="letter2"&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael A. |last=Fuoco |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lN0NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5448,2701157|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130124163646/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lN0NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5448,2701157|dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 24, 2013 |title=Police cautious of word from 'killer' |publisher=''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' |date=February 10, 1990 |accessdate=September 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams used his patrol car to stop the suspect by blocking the exit of the parking lot. When he asked the suspect for his driver's license, the suspect gave fraudulent [[identity document]]s and shot Adams. He returned fire, but the shots were not fatal.&lt;ref name="memorial"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://odmp.org/officer/1052-chief-of-police-gregory-b.-adams |title=Chief of Police Gregory B. Adams  |publisher=The Officer Down Memorial Page, Inc. |accessdate=September 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The man believed to be Donald Eugene Webb got out of the car and fought with Adams,&lt;ref name="toledo"/&gt; disarming him and [[pistol-whipping]] him with his own revolver.&lt;ref name="newdata"/&gt; Witnesses heard fired shots; four "pop" noises, presumably from a semiautomatic .25-caliber Colt pistol,&lt;ref name="mystery"/&gt; and a "boom" from Adams' revolver.&lt;ref name="toledo"/&gt; He was shot once in the arm and once in the chest at close range.&lt;ref name="newdata"/&gt; By another account, Adams was shot twice in the chest,&lt;ref name="memorial"/&gt; one bullet collapsing a [[lung]] and another tearing through the bottom of his [[heart]].&lt;ref name="search"/&gt;{{Dead link|date=July 2012}} Adams was not wearing his [[bulletproof vest]] at the time.&lt;ref name="memorial"/&gt; The killer took Adams' gun, ran to his patrol car, ripped out its microphone and took the keys before driving away in his own car.&lt;ref name="toledo"/&gt;

A nearby resident found the mortally wounded Adams, who told her that he did not know his attacker and that he thought he was not going to live.&lt;ref name="toledo"/&gt; Adams was so badly beaten he was almost unrecognizable.&lt;ref name="foxnews"&gt;{{cite web |first=Michelle |last=Maskaly |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,444213,00.html |title=WANTED: Donald Eugene Webb for the Murder of a Pennsylvania Police Chief |publisher=''[[Fox News]]'' |date=October 27, 2008 |accessdate=September 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams lost [[consciousness]] on the way to the hospital and died of his injuries.&lt;ref name="toledo"/&gt; He was survived by his wife Mary Ann Adams&lt;ref name="memorial"/&gt; and their two sons, Benjamin and Gregory, Jr.&lt;ref name="postgazette"/&gt; Adams is buried in St. Mary's Cemetery in [[Herman, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="memorial"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.odmp.org/officer/1052-chief-of-police-gregory-b-adams ODMP memorial Gregory Adams]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation ==
A .25-caliber Colt pistol, O-type blood (Webb's [[blood type]]), and a New Jersey [[driver's license]] bearing the name Stanley John Portas, an alias of Webb and the name of his wife Lillian's late prior husband, were among the evidence found at the murder scene. Portas had died in 1948.&lt;ref name="postgazette"/&gt;&lt;ref name="toledo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="slayer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pittsburghpress"/&gt; Webb is believed to have been in Saxonburg for a planned burglary of a jewelry store.&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;{{cite web |first=Robert |last=Baird |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QpQcAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3861,4374109|title=Letter stirs hope of surrender by suspect in Saxonburg police killing |publisher=''The Pittsburgh Press'' |date=February 9, 1990 |accessdate=September 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams' revolver was later found approximately {{convert|7|mi|km}} away along Cornplanter Road in [[Winfield, Pennsylvania]]. All six bullets of the weapon had been fired.&lt;ref name="search"/&gt;{{Dead link|date=July 2012}}

A white [[Mercury Cougar]], which Webb had rented, was allegedly used as a getaway car.&lt;ref name="search"/&gt;{{Dead link|date=July 2012}} Two weeks later, it was found abandoned at a [[Howard Johnson's]] motel in [[Warwick, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref name="newdata"/&gt; Significant amounts of O-type blood were found under the [[steering wheel]], suggesting that Webb was wounded by gunfire in the struggle with Adams.&lt;ref name="toledo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="record"/&gt;

Webb was named as a main suspect in the killing of Chief Adams, and a nationwide manhunt began.&lt;ref name="slayer"/&gt; He was charged ''in absentia'' with murder, attempted burglary, and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. A federal arrest warrant was issued for him on December 31. On May 4, 1981, Webb was named as the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, 1980s|375th fugitive to be placed]] on the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations|FBI]]'s [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|Ten Most Wanted list]].&lt;ref name="foxnews"/&gt;
[[File:Age-enhanced photograph of Donald Webb.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Age-enhanced photograph released by FBI in 1996.]]
Webb had strong ties to [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River]] and [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]], Massachusetts,&lt;ref name="mystery"/&gt; where the last confirmed sighting of him was made by an anonymous tipster in July 1981.&lt;ref name="postgazette"/&gt; It was reported to the Boston FBI office, but Webb had fled by the time investigators arrived.&lt;ref name="postgazette"/&gt; There were later unconfirmed sightings of Webb, or men resembling him, in Massachusetts, Washington, Canada and Costa Rica.&lt;ref name="search"/&gt;

In January 1990, FBI director [[William S. Sessions]] received a letter postmarked January 23&lt;ref name="letter2"/&gt; and  written by someone claiming to be Webb, asking for forgiveness from Adams' family. The letter suggested he might surrender to authorities,&lt;ref name="letter"/&gt; but only if he could talk directly to [[John Walsh (television host)|John Walsh]], host of the TV show ''[[America's Most Wanted]]''.&lt;ref name="walsh"/&gt; Walsh said on his show that the FBI's evidence technicians examined the letter and believed it was authentic.&lt;ref name="letter"/&gt; [[Handwriting test]]s were inconclusive&lt;ref name="letter2"/&gt; (They have now been discounted as accurate forensic evidence, anyway). On April 1, 1990, a man claiming to be Webb called John Walsh but when asked questions to confirm his identity, was unable to name two of Webb's closest relatives. The call was dismissed as an [[April Fools' Day|April Fools' joke]].&lt;ref name="walsh"/&gt; The murder case was featured in an episode of ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]''.&lt;ref name="letter"/&gt;

After more than 18 years on the list, on September 14, 1999, Webb was noted as the fugitive with the longest tenure on the FBI Ten Most Wanted list, surpassing the previous record held by [[Charles Lee Herron]].&lt;ref name="record"/&gt;

In April 2005, an unidentified man in [[Detroit]] was found using Webb's name, age and [[social security number]]. Detroit police tracked the address to a burned-out house in a poor section of town. Authorities considered this a case of [[identity theft]], however unusual.&lt;ref name="search"/&gt;

The FBI removed Webb from the Ten Most Wanted list on March 31, 2007. He was replaced by [[Shauntay Henderson]].&lt;ref name="[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1971762_1971761_1971745,00.html|title=Top 10 Notorious Fugitives|last=Romero|first=Frances|date=March 12, 2010|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Webb held the record of being on the FBI's wanted list longer than any other fugitive until 2010, when [[Víctor Manuel Gerena]] surpassed his record. Although Webb was still a fugitive considered armed and dangerous by the FBI, the significant lack of leads made some investigators believe Webb had died.&lt;ref name="toledo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="record"/&gt;

On December 4, 2015, the FBI increased their reward to $100,000 for information leading to the arrest of Webb, or to the location of his remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/pittsburgh/news/press-releases/on-the-35th-anniversary-of-the-murder-of-saxonburg-police-chief-gregory-adams-the-chiefs-killer-donald-eugene-webb-remains-a-fugitive|title=On the 35th Anniversary of the Murder of Saxonburg Police Chief Gregory Adams, the Chief’s Killer Donald Eugene Webb Remains a Fugitive|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key investigators, including the FBI special agent assigned to finding Webb, believed he was still alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/03/17/fbi-looking-to-heat-up-cold-trail-in-1980-murder-pennsylvania-police-chief.html|title=FBI looking to heat up cold trail in 1980 murder of Pennsylvania police chief|date=17 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

On June 1, 2017, Mary Ann Adams Jones, the police chief's widow (who had remarried), filed a lawsuit for civil damages against Donald Eugene Webb, his wife Lillian Webb, and their son Stanley Webb. FBI investigators had announced that in 2016 they had discovered a secret room hidden behind a closet in the basement of Lillian Webb's home in North Dartmouth, Massachusetts. The room had not existed when Lillian purchased the home. Agents also discovered a cane inside the room, which they believed may have been used by Webb after being shot in the leg by Adams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpxi.com/news/top-stories/local-police-chiefs-death-longest-running-unsolved-murder-in-country/528751441|title=Local police chief's death longest running unsolved murder in country|first=|last=EndPlay|date=1 June 2017|publisher=WPXI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

On June 15, 2017, the FBI released newly acquired photographs of Webb taken in the 1970s. They hoped these would aid in gaining the public's assistance in either capturing Webb or locating his remains. Faced with prosecution for harboring a criminal, Lillian Webb arranged to confess to police and the FBI. She told about sheltering Webb, and the strokes he suffered near the end of his life. He had been treated in a Massachusetts hospital under an assumed name for the serious injuries to his leg in 1980.&lt;ref name="APWarren"/&gt;

She led the FBI to his remains, found buried on the grounds of her Dartmouth home. This was announced on July 17, 2017, when they had been identified by FBI forensic investigators as belonging to Webb. The investigators found that Webb had died in 1999 after suffering multiple strokes. State police documents said that Webb had lived for nearly 17 years hidden by his wife in the two different houses where she lived in that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fox25boston.com/news/fbi-most-wanted-donald-webb-documents-reveal-how-the-gangster-avoided-capture/563154927 "How a suspected police chief murderer avoided capture for 37 years"], ''Boston 25 News,'' July 18, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APWarren"&gt;Victoria Warren, [http://whdh.com/news/fbi-remains-found-in-dartmouth-yard-are-those-of-fugitive-wanted-for-killing-police-chief "Remains found in Dartmouth yard are those of fugitive wanted for killing police chief"], The [[Associated Press]] via WHDH News, July 14, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural Dubai Music Week 2013 was presented in association with Dubai Calendar, official Partner Emirates and official sponsor Pepsi. It was the first industry trade show in MENA that brought together major music labels, artists and merchants to exhibit their products and launch initiatives to key industry stakeholders and consumers. Jumeirah Zabeel Saray was the official hotel partner.&lt;ref name=Jumeirah&gt;{{cite web|title=Dubai Music Week announces official hotel partnership with Jumeirah|url=http://www.jumeirah.com/en/jumeirah-group/press-centre/press-releases/press-releases-for-2013/dubai-music-week-announces-official-hotel-partnership-with-jumeirah-zabeel-saray/|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the activities included the ''Pepsi Band Slam'', ''The Music Exhibition'', ''Quincy Jones Seminars'', ''Live Concerts'', and ''Midem Music Conference and Workshops''.

Bands from Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and United Arab Emirates represented diversity in local musical talents. Some of the local bands included Nikotin, Run Junction, Adonis, Empty Chair,J-Fam, and Reset String.

The event was attended by musicians, producers, managers, journalists, labels, app developers and content creators from around the globe. The Michael Jackson Dream Team Seminar hosted [[Quincy Jones]], [[Rod Temperton]], and [[Bruce Swedien]], with music journalist [[Ben Fong-Torres]] moderating. The Producers Panel, also MC'd by Fong-Torres, included Quincy Jones, [[Timbaland]], and [[Will.i.am]], who discussed the subject of music production and judged a talent selection competition, the winner receiving a recording and production contract. Five artists were invited to take part in this exclusive showcase: Jay Wud, Hamdan Abri, DD Foxx, [[Xriss Jor]], and Nile.&lt;ref name=national /&gt;

'''''Elvis In Concert''''' is a [[Death|posthumous]] 1977 [[TV special]] starring [[Elvis Presley]]. It was Elvis' third and final TV special, following ''Elvis'' (a.k.a. ''The [[Elvis (1968 TV program)|'68 Comeback Special]]'') and ''[[Aloha From Hawaii]]''. It was filmed during Presley's final tour in the cities of [[Omaha, Nebraska]], on June 19, 1977, and [[Rapid City, South Dakota]], on June 21, 1977. It was broadcast on [[CBS]] on October 3, 1977, two months after Presley's death. It was transmitted by the [[BBC]] in the United Kingdom on June 9, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/71fbdb35ae4d4334820764e372f62f8d BBC Genome Project - Radio Times listings]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the majority of Elvis' programs, it is unlikely to be commercially released on home video and is only available in [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] form.&lt;ref name=fansonly&gt;[http://www.elvispresley.com.au/elvis/presley/elvis_in_concert.shtml For Elvis Fans Only: Press Release From Presley Estate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504105529/http://www.elvispresley.com.au/elvis/presley/elvis_in_concert.shtml |date=2009-05-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vcdreview&gt;[http://www.elvisinfonet.com/inconcertvcd.html Elvis Information Network: Elvis in Concert VCD Review].&lt;/ref&gt; This is because it showed Elvis near the end of his life when he was overweight and addicted to prescription drugs, and much of his performance reflects his poor health.&lt;ref name=fansonly/&gt; However, parts of the special were used in the video documentary ''Elvis: The Great Performances'' and the theatrical documentary ''[[This is Elvis]]'', both of which were released on home video.

==Description==
On June 1, 1977, it was announced that Elvis Presley had signed a deal with [[CBS]] for a new television special. It was agreed that CBS would videotape concerts during the summer of 1977. The final special was culled from footage from two performances on June 19, 1977, in Omaha, and June 21, 1977, in Rapid City, although much of the footage from Omaha was considered unusable due to sound and performance problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.online.no/~ov-egela/review77b.html |title=Focus on Elvis: Elvis on Tour 1977 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104055737/http://home.online.no/~ov-egela/review77b.html |archivedate=2006-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concert has been heavily edited and bootlegs have appeared on auction web sites over the years. The show was shot on NTSC videotape although many film conversions have appeared over the years. The crew also filmed footage of Elvis at the airport in Indianapolis, receiving a gold record from [[RCA Records]] for his final album, ''[[Moody Blue]],'' on June 26. This is the last known footage of Elvis ever filmed, and he can be seen wearing his favorite [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] jacket.

During the special, Presley performs a number of songs spanning his career.  During one song, "[[Are You Lonesome Tonight (song)|Are You Lonesome Tonight?]]," just before Elvis goes into the [[recitation song|recitation]] part of the song, the music is faded down and a devoted female fan is shown talking about her determination to see Elvis live in concert, then it switches back to Elvis after the recitation was finished.  This may have been done so that viewers would not have to see Elvis fumbling through the recitation, although this footage was included in the later documentary ''[[This Is Elvis]]'' to illustrate his poor condition at the time, and the recitation was left intact on the [[Elvis in Concert (album)|soundtrack album]] as well.  However, a strong case is made in Darrin Memmer's book "Elvis Presley - The 1977 CBS Television Special," published in 2001 by Morris Publishing, that Elvis regularly played around with the words during the recitation of the song when performing it onstage, rather than it being a case of poor memory. Indeed, a concert recording of Presley similarly joking around during the recitation of "Are You Lonesome Tonight?" dating from 1969 has been issued by RCA on numerous occasions. Dubbed the "Laughing Version" (due to Elvis breaking into fits of laughter during the recitation), it even made the UK charts after Presley's death; and he also poked fun at the song during his [[Elvis (1968 TV program)|1968 Comeback Special]], pretending to mumble the recitation instead of speaking it.

Presley also sings his much-performed "[[My Way]]," although he has to use a lyric sheet on this occasion, despite having performed the song several years through the 1970s without having to refer to a lyric sheet. Presley also left both of his then-current singles, “[[Moody Blue (song)|Moody Blue]]” and “[[Way Down]],” off the setlist; earlier in the tour, Presley had forgotten the lyrics to "Moody Blue" when attempting to perform it in North Carolina on February 20. Due to multiple audience requests the following night (also in North Carolina), Presley performed Moody Blue once again for the first and last time live and complete, lyrics in hand, the only time he would do so in his lifetime.

According to Roy Carr and Mick Farren in ''Elvis: The Illustrated Record'', CBS officials considered postponing broadcast of the special in hopes of obtaining better performance footage of Presley, but his death in August 1977 cancelled this plan.&lt;ref name=carrfarren&gt;Carr and Farren (1982), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Its broadcast received mixed reaction; Carr and Farren condemned it as a "travesty", adding, "Had it been shown during his lifetime, it would have caused more irrevocable damage to what was left of his career than almost a decade of starring in third-rate movies."&lt;ref name=carrfarren/&gt;

A misconception regarding ''Elvis in Concert'' stems from a statement broadcast by Presley's father, [[Vernon Presley]] at the program's conclusion (and also included on the soundtrack album) in which he told viewers that they had just witnessed Elvis' final performance. In fact, Presley made five more concert appearances before giving what would be his final show in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], on June 26.&lt;ref&gt;Carr and Farren (1982), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the CBS special was Elvis' last professionally recorded concert. The special actually contains two messages by Elvis' father: one taped in a hotel room during the tour in June when Elvis was still alive, and the other taped in the back office of Graceland shortly after his death, where Vernon thanks the many people who sent letters and cards after Elvis' death.

==Reviews==
[[Allmusic]] called it Presley's worst, saying, "it's hard to believe that CBS-TV actually would have aired the show if Presley hadn't died two months later, making it his final recorded performance (and making his records big sellers again)."&lt;ref&gt;allmusic.com, "[http://www.allmusic.com/album/elvis-in-concert-mw0000674304 Elvis in Concert]". Accessed 11 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The fan site Elvis Information Network deemed the program "a challenging special to watch... The pudginess of his face and his substantial girth is a long way from the panther like sleekness exhibited in ''[[Elvis: That's the Way It Is]]'', a [[documentary film|documentary]] about Presley released in 1970."&lt;ref name=vcdreview/&gt;

It was the highest rated prime time program of the week upon its airing, with a 33.0 Nielsen rating representing 24.1 million homes.&lt;ref name="ratings"&gt;(12 October 1977). [https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/47695964/ ABC Retains Grip on Audience], ''Abilene Reporter-News'' ([[Associated Press]] story) ("CBS' "Elvis in Concert," taped highlights of two of Elvis Presley's last live shows, was the week's most watched program.  Broadcast on the night of Oct. 3, it was seen in an estimated 24.1 million homes.")&lt;/ref&gt;

== Official release ==
This special has never been released on [[VHS]] or [[DVD]], and [[Elvis Presley Enterprises|Elvis' estate]] has issued a statement saying that they have "no plans" to release the special, due to the fact that Elvis was visibly "far from his best in the way he looked and the way he performed".&lt;ref name=fansonly/&gt;

Footage from this special has, however, appeared elsewhere on home video: the performances of "Are You Lonesome Tonight", "Love Me" and "My Way" were used in 1981's ''[[This Is Elvis]]'', and the performance of "[[Unchained Melody]]" (which was not featured on the original CBS telecast) appeared in the 1990 home video release ''The Great Performances, Volume One: Center Stage''.

==Soundtrack==
{{main|Elvis in Concert (album)}}

[[RCA Records]] released a soundtrack album in conjunction with the television special's broadcast. The album augments the televised performances with a second album of additional recordings made during the Omaha and Rapid City concerts. The concert soundtrack album was released in October 1977 and reached #5 on the Billboard album charts. The album, however, omitted many of the features from the TV show; including some of the fans' comments, audio of the stage setup and souvenir sales, the fan's comment during "Are You Lonesome Tonight?", and Vernon Presley's comment during "Can't Help Falling in Love".

'''Emergency Communities''' was a volunteer organization which formed after [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005. It provided meals and other relief to residents and emergency responders, first in [[Mississippi]], then in [[Louisiana]]. Emergency Communities ran sites in St. Bernard Parish, Plaquemines Parish, and Orleans Parish's Lower Ninth Ward, and then closed its doors on Thanksgiving of 2007. Nonprofit organization lowernine.org took the reins with regard to Emergency Communities' rebuild work, and continues to work on Eldorado Street rebuilding homes for residents of this devastated community. As of June 2009, lowernine.org has rebuilt twenty homes, in addition to working on hundreds of projects large and small across the community.

Over the course of its two years, Emergency Communities' sites hosted over 4,000 unique volunteers, including approximately 300 from [[AmeriCorps]]/[[National Civilian Community Corps|NCCC]] or others supported by grants from the [[Corporation for National and Community Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The organization also raised over $10 million in donations for the relief effort, including from [[Oxfam]], the [[Red Cross]], the [[United Way]], and hundreds of individuals across the country.  Its major corporate sponsors included [[Sanderson Farms]] Chicken, [[Organic Valley]], and [[Domino Sugar]].  Together, its volunteers served over 350,000 meals to over 50,000 unique residents, and gutted and helped rebuild hundreds of homes.  Among the additional services it provided over this period were laundry, daycare, food, clothing and household goods distribution, naturopathic healthcare, including massage and therapy, and warm, welcoming places to recover from the trauma of the storm.

On 1 June 2006, Emergency Communities shut down its outdoor operation in St. Bernard Parish.  As part of its exit strategy the nonprofit Community Center of St Bernard in Arabi, was founded. Using its Community Connections Model, the Center currently helps more than 5,300 clients every year receive basic resources like food, clothes, legal aid, basic medical care, computer classes, financial literacy programs, senior citizen employment training, income tax preparation, information and referrals, and much more. On the same date, Emergency Communities served its first meal at a new location in [[Buras, Louisiana|Buras]], Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On June 30, 2007, Emergency Communities closed the Y-Cafe in Buras and redeployed its resources to the Ninth Ward in New Orleans.  A new organization, People for Plaquemines, carried on the mission of rebuilding lower Plaquemines Parish.

Emergency Communities no longer accepts volunteers on the Gulf Coast. However, its sister organization, [[lowernine.org]], is continuing the work of rebuilding in the Lower Ninth Ward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''The Great Daffodil Appeal''' is [[Marie Curie (Charity)|Marie Curie]]'s biggest annual fundraising campaign.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mariecurie.org.uk/en-GB/fundraising-volunteering/great-daffodil-appeal/&lt;/ref&gt; Every March, millions of people across the UK support this fundraising event by giving a small donation to wear a daffodil pin. This makes it one of the UK’s most recognisable charity appeals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/humza-yousaf-marie-curie-cancer-3238034&lt;/ref&gt; Money raised through the appeal helps Marie Curie provide free care and support to people living with a terminal illnesses.

== History ==

The first Great Daffodil Appeal took place in 1986 with volunteers collecting donations and handing out fresh daffodils.

In 1995, Marie Curie replaced fresh flowers with fabric daffodil pins. Three million were given out and £1.2 million was donated. In 2005, the charity used the term ‘Great Daffodil Appeal’ for the first time.

In 2011, actress [[Alison Steadman]] appeared in the charity’s first TV advertising campaign for the appeal.  Alison has continued her support for the appeal, appearing in TV ads in 2012,2014 and 2015, as well as the 2016 radio advert with actor [[Dominic West]].

== Key facts ==

In 2014/15, the [[Charitable organization|charity]] provided care to more than 40,700 people with terminal illnesses, and is the largest provider of hospice beds outside the [[National Health Service|NHS]].
 
The millions raised by the Great Daffodil Appeal over the years have enabled Marie Curie to provide more free hands-on care to people living with a terminal illness, usually in their own homes or at one of the charity’s [https://www.mariecurie.org.uk/help/hospice-care/hospices nine hospices].

During the 2015 Great Daffodil Appeal, more than 22,000 collectors took on 34,000 collections.

As part of the 2016 appeal, supporters are also being encouraged to raise funds by doing something they love, such as hosting a [[bake sale]] or quiz night.

The '''Haifa International Film Festival''' is an annual [[film festival]] that takes place every [[autumn]] (between late September and late October&lt;ref name="jpost15"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Culture/Haifa-film-festival-announces-guest-list-415517 | title=Haifa film festival announces guest list | newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] | first=Hannah | last=Brown | date=7 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), during the week-long holiday of [[Sukkot]], in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]].

The '''Heysel Stadium disaster''' ({{IPA-fr|ɛizɛl|lang}}, {{IPA-nl|ˈɦɛizəl|lang|Nl-Heizel.ogg}}; {{lang-nl|Heizeldrama}}; {{lang-fr|Drame du Heysel}}; {{lang-it|Dramma dell' Heysel}}) occurred on 29 May 1985 when mostly [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] fans escaping from a breach by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] fans were pressed against a collapsing wall in the [[King Baudouin Stadium|Heysel Stadium]] in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], before the start of the [[1985 European Cup Final]] between the [[Italy|Italian]] and [[England|English]] clubs. 39 people—mostly Italians and Juventus fans—were killed and 600 were injured in the confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately an hour before the Juventus-Liverpool final was due to kick off, Liverpool supporters charged at Juventus fans and breached a fence that was separating them from a "neutral area". The cause of the rampage is disputed: many accounts, including Liverpool's official website, attribute blame to the Italian fans for sparking the violence, but this claim is contested by other eye-witnesses and has been criticized for being unsubstantiated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/27/heysel-stadium-disaster-30th-anniversary Heysel stadium disaster: ‘I saw the rows of bodies piled high’], ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt; Juventus fans ran back on the terraces and away from the threat into a concrete retaining wall. Fans already standing near the wall were crushed; eventually the wall collapsed, allowing others to escape.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/apr/02/championsleague200405.championsleague&lt;/ref&gt; Many people climbed over to safety, but many others died or were badly injured. The game was played despite the disaster, with Juventus winning 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2006/12/04/local_history_heysel_feature.shtml|title=Liverpool&amp;nbsp;— History&amp;nbsp;— Heysel disaster|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tragedy resulted in all English [[association football|football]] clubs being placed under an indefinite ban by [[UEFA]] from all European competitions (lifted in 1990–91), with Liverpool being excluded for an additional three years, later reduced to one,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tomkinstimes.com/2013/05/heysel-25-years-on-book-extract/ |title=Heysel, 27 Years On – Book Extract &amp;#124; The Tomkins Times &amp;#124; News, Opinion, Statistics and Discussion about Liverpool FC Football Club |publisher=The Tomkins Times |date= |accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fourteen Liverpool fans found guilty of [[manslaughter]] and each sentenced to three years' imprisonment. The disaster was later described as "the darkest hour in the history of the UEFA competitions".&lt;ref&gt;Quote from UEFA Chief Executive Lars-Christer Olsson in 2004, [http://www.uefa.com/uefa/Keytopics/kind=2/newsId=300034.html uefa.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events leading up to the disaster ==
In May 1985, Liverpool were the defending [[UEFA Champions League|European Champions' Cup]] winners, having won the competition after defeating [[AS Roma|Roma]] in the [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] in the [[1984 European Cup Final|final]] of the previous season. Again they would face Italian opposition, Juventus, who had won, unbeaten, the [[1983–84 European Cup Winners' Cup|1983–84 Cup Winners' Cup]]. Juventus had a team comprising many of [[Italy national football team|Italy]]'s [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] winning team–who played for Juventus for many years–and their [[playmaker]] [[Michel Platini]] was considered the best footballer in Europe, being named [[Ballon d'Or|Footballer of The Year]] by ''[[France Football]]'' [[magazine]] for the second year in a row in December 1984. Both teams were placed in the two first positions in the [[UEFA coefficient|UEFA club ranking]] at the end of the last season&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl/bert/uefa/data/method1/tcoef1984.html|title=UEFA Team Coefficients 1983/1984|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were regarded by the [[Sports journalism|specialist press]] as the best two sides on the continent at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Falkiner|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both teams had contested the [[1984 European Super Cup]] four months before, finishing with victory for the Italian side by 2–0.

Despite its status as Belgium's [[national stadium]], Heysel was in a poor state of repair by the time of the 1985 European Final. The 55-year-old stadium had not been sufficiently maintained for several years, and large parts of the stadium were literally crumbling. For example, the outer wall had been made of [[cinder block]], and fans who did not have tickets were seen kicking holes in it to get in.&lt;ref name="times3"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,762-1554603,00.html |title=Our day of shame | work=The Times |accessdate=24 May 2006 | location=London | first=Tony | last=Evans | date=5 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liverpool players and fans later said that they were shocked at Heysel's abject condition, despite reports from [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] fans that the ground was a "dump" when Arsenal had played there a few years earlier. They were also surprised that Heysel was chosen despite its poor condition, especially since [[Barcelona]]'s [[Camp Nou]] and [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium|Santiago Bernabéu]] in [[Madrid]] were both available. Juventus president [[Giampiero Boniperti]] and Liverpool CEO Peter Robinson urged [[UEFA]] to choose another venue, claiming that Heysel was not in any condition to host a European Final, especially a European Final involving two of the largest and most powerful clubs in Europe. However, UEFA refused to consider a move.&lt;ref name=Repubblica&gt;{{cite news|language=Italian |author=Enrico Sisti |url=http://www.saladellamemoriaheysel.it/Intervista_a_Ian_Rush.html |title=Il calcio cambiò per sempre |publisher=[[la Repubblica]] |date=28 May 2010 |accessdate=22 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322225627/http://www.saladellamemoriaheysel.it/Intervista_a_Ian_Rush.html |archivedate=22 March 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lfcstory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/lfc_story/a_1985.shtml |title=LFC Story 1985 |work=Liverpool Official Website |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520113640/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/lfc_story/a_1985.shtml |archivedate=20 May 2006 |accessdate=24 May 2006 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium was crammed with 58,000–60,000 supporters, with more than 25,000 for each team. The two ends behind the goals comprised all-standing terraces, each end split into three zones. The Juventus end was O, N and M and the Liverpool end was X, Y and Z as deemed by the Belgian court after the disaster. However, the tickets for the Z section were reserved for neutral Belgian fans in addition to the rest of the stadium. This meant the Juventus fans had more sections than the Liverpool fans with the Z section occupied by neutrals which is thought to have heightened prematch tensions. The idea of the large neutral area was opposed by both Liverpool and Juventus,&lt;ref name="times2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,428-1532782,00.html |title=Night of mayhem in Brussels that will never be forgotten |work=The Times |accessdate=24 May 2006 | location=London | first1=James | last1=Ducker | first2=Tom | last2=Dart | date=19 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it would provide an opportunity for fans of both clubs to obtain tickets from agencies or from [[Ticket resale|ticket touts]] outside the ground and thus create a dangerous mix of fans.

At the time Brussels, like the rest of Belgium, already had a large Italian community, and many expatriate Juventus fans bought the section Z tickets.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/championsleague200405/story/0,,1450632,00.html |title=Liverpool still torn over night that shamed their name|work=The Guardian | language= |accessdate=24 May 2006 | location=London | first=Paul | last=Kelso | date=2 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Added to this, many tickets were bought up and sold by travel agents, mainly to Juventus fans. A small percentage of the tickets ended up in the hands of Liverpool fans.

=== Confrontation ===
[[File:Heysel plan.png|300px|thumbnail|Heysel Stadium by section]]
At approximately 7 p.m. local time, an hour before kick-off, the trouble started.&lt;ref name="bbc 2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/768380.stm |title=The Heysel disaster|work=BBC News | language= |accessdate=15 June 2006 | date=29 May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Liverpool and Juventus supporters in sections X and Z stood merely yards apart. The boundary between the two was marked by temporary [[chain link fencing]] and a central thinly policed no-man's land.&lt;ref name="guardian5"&gt;
{{cite news|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,1563,1448505,00.html |title=Lost lives that saved a sport |work=The Guardian |accessdate=15 June 2006 | location=London | first=Andrew | last=Hussey | date=3 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooligans began to throw stones across the divide, which they were able to pick up from the crumbling terraces beneath them.

As kick-off approached, the throwing became more intense. Several groups of Liverpool hooligans broke through the boundary between section X and Z, overpowered the police, and charged at the Juventus fans. The fans began to flee toward the perimeter wall of section Z. The wall could not withstand the force of the fleeing Juventus supporters and a lower portion collapsed.

Contrary to reports at the time, and what is still assumed by many, the collapse of the wall did not cause the 39 deaths. Instead, the collapse relieved pressure and allowed fans to escape. Most died of suffocation after tripping or being crushed against the wall before the collapse. A further 600 fans were also injured. Bodies were carried out from the stadium on sections of iron fencing and laid outside, covered with giant football flags. As police and medical helicopters flew in, the down-draught blew away the modest coverings.

In retaliation for the events in section Z, many Juventus fans then rioted at their end of the stadium. They advanced down the stadium running track to help other Juventus supporters, but police intervention stopped the advance. A large group of Juventus fans fought the police with rocks, bottles and stones for two hours. One Juventus fan was also seen firing a [[starting pistol|starting gun]] at Belgian police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Italian fan firing a gun at Belgium police|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19850531&amp;id=PDc0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=S_UIAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5516,5515417|publisher=Ottawa Citizen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The match ===
Despite the scale of the disaster, UEFA officials, Belgian Prime Minister [[Wilfried Martens]], Brussels Mayor [[Hervé Brouhon]], and the city's police force felt that abandoning the match would have risked inciting further trouble and violence, and the match eventually kicked off after the captains of both sides spoke to the crowd and appealed for calm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Graham|1985|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juventus won the match 1–0 thanks to a penalty scored by Michel Platini, awarded by Swiss referee Daina for a foul against [[Zbigniew Boniek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport.pl/pilka/1,65083,8536356,Nie_kibicow_dla_Bonka_na_stadionie_Juventusu.html |title=Nie dla Bońka na stadionie Juventusu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213858/http://www.sport.pl/pilka/1%2C65083%2C8536356%2CNie_kibicow_dla_Bonka_na_stadionie_Juventusu.html |archivedate=3 March 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the game the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup|trophy]] was given in front of the stadium's Honor Stand by the confederation president [[Jacques Georges]] to Juventus captain [[Gaetano Scirea]]. Due to collective [[hysteria]] generated by the massive invasion of the pitch by journalists and fans at the end of the match,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reilly |first1=Thomas |title=Science and Soccer |url=http://www.gethitch.com.au/csf/Soccer%20Coaching/36865462-Science-and-Soccer-Thomas-Reilly.pdf |pages=316; 320 |publisher=E &amp; FN Spon |location=London |year=1996 |ISBN=0-419-18880-0 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106010508/http://www.gethitch.com.au/csf/Soccer%20Coaching/36865462-Science-and-Soccer-Thomas-Reilly.pdf |archivedate=6 November 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the chants of fans of both teams in the stands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|language=Portuguese|author=James Arangüera|title=Um trófeu para ser esquecido|publisher=[[Placar]]|page=29|date=7 June 1985|&lt;!--accessdate=21 March 2014--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; some Italian club players celebrated the title in the middle of the pitch among them and in front of their fans in the M section, while some Liverpool players applauded their fans between the X and Z sections, the stadium's section affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |language=Italian |title=Le verità sull'Heysel.

== Aftermath {{anchor|Ban}}==

===Criminal proceedings===
The blame for the incident was laid on the fans of Liverpool FC. On 30 May official [[UEFA]] observer Gunter Schneider said, "Only the English fans were responsible. Of that there is no doubt." UEFA, the organiser of the event, the owners of Heysel Stadium and the Belgian police were investigated for culpability. After an 18-month investigation, the dossier of top Belgian judge Marina Coppieters was finally published. It concluded that blame should rest solely with the English fans. 

The British police undertook a thorough investigation to bring to justice the perpetrators. Some 17 minutes of film and many still photographs were examined. ''[[This Week (ITV TV series)|TV Eye]]'' produced an hour-long programme featuring the footage and the British press also published the photographs.

A total of 34 people were arrested and questioned with 26 Liverpool fans being charged with manslaughter – the only [[Extradition|extraditable]] offence applicable to events at Heysel. An extradition hearing in London in February–March 1987 ruled all 26 were to be extradited to stand trial in Belgium for the death of Juventus fan Mario Ronchi. In September 1987 they were extradited and formally charged with manslaughter applying to all 39 deaths and further charges of assault. Initially, all were held at a Belgian prison but over the subsequent months judges permitted their release as the start of the trial became ever more delayed.

The trial eventually got underway in October 1988, with three Belgians also standing trial for their role in the disaster: Albert Roosens, the head of the Belgian Football Association, for allowing tickets for the Liverpool section of the stadium to be sold to Juventus fans; and two police chiefs - Michel Kensier and Johann Mahieu - who were in charge of policing at the stadium that night. Two of the 26 Liverpool fans were in custody in Britain at the time and stood trial later. In April 1989, 14 fans were convicted and given three-year sentences, that were half suspended for five years, allowing them to return to the UK.&lt;ref name="witnesses"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1448082,00.html |title=The witnesses |work=The Observer |accessdate=27 May 2006 | location=London | first=Jamie | last=Jackson | date=3 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Belgian prosecutors appealed the sentences as too lenient, an appeal took place in Spring 1990 that increased the sentences of 11 fans (to five or four years), with two having their sentences upheld and one being acquitted.{{Citation needed|reason=appeal info|date=April 2016}}

===English club ban===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2016}}
Pressure mounted to ban English clubs from European competition.  On 31 May 1985, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] asked [[the FA]] to withdraw English clubs from European competition before they were banned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fromthearchive/story/0,,1496054,00.html |title=Thatcher set to demand FA ban on games in Europe |work=The Guardian |accessdate=27 May 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; but two days later, UEFA banned English clubs for "an indeterminate period of time". On 6 June, [[FIFA]] extended this ban to all worldwide matches, but this was modified a week later to allow friendly matches outside of Europe to take place. In December 1985 FIFA announced that English clubs were also free to play friendly games in Europe, though the Belgian government banned any English clubs playing in their country.

Though the English national team was not subjected to any bans, English club sides were banned indefinitely from European club competitions, with Liverpool being provisionally subject to a further three years suspension as well. In April 1990, following years of campaigning from the English football authorities, UEFA confirmed the reintroduction of English clubs (with the exception of Liverpool) into its competitions from the 1990–91 season onward; in April 1991 UEFA's Executive Committee voted to allow Liverpool back into European competition from the 1991–92 season onward, a year later than their compatriots, but two years earlier than initially foreseen. In the end, all English clubs served a five-year-ban, while Liverpool were excluded for six years.

According to former Liverpool striker [[Ian Rush]], the institutional relationships between both clubs and their fans improved during his career in Italy.&lt;ref name=Repubblica/&gt;

The number of places available to English clubs in the UEFA Cup would however have been reduced had English teams been eliminated early in the competition. By the time of the readmittance of all English clubs except Liverpool in 1990–91, England was only granted one UEFA Cup entrant (awarded to the league runners-up); prior to the ban, they had had four entry slots, a number not awarded to England again until the 1994–95 UEFA Cup. Welsh clubs playing in the [[English football league system|English league system]], who could qualify for the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] through winning the [[Welsh Cup]], were unaffected by the ban.

In the meantime, many other clubs missed out on a place in the UEFA Cup due to the return of English clubs to European competitions only being gradual – in 1990 the league had no [[UEFA coefficient]] points used to calculate the number of teams, and even though [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] won the Cup Winners' Cup in the first season of returning in [[1990–91 European Cup Winners' Cup|1991]], it took four more years for England to build up the points to the previous level.

Liverpool's additional year of exclusion from Europe meant that there was no English representation in the [[1990–91 European Cup]], as they were [[1989–90 Football League]] champions. Due to the weak coefficient, [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]] winners [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] also missed out on UEFA Cup places in 1990–91, along with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].

The teams who missed out on the 1991–92 UEFA Cup for the same reason were [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]]. In 1992–93, Arsenal and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] were unable to take part. In 1993–94, the 'missing' teams were [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], and the final season of fewer teams gaining entry was 1994–95, when Leeds United missed out.

=== Impact on stadiums ===
After Heysel, English clubs began to impose stricter rules intended to make it easier to prevent troublemakers from attending domestic games, with legal provision to exclude troublemakers for three months introduced in 1986, and the Football (Offences) Act introduced in 1991.

Serious progress on legal banning orders preventing foreign travel to matches was arguably not made until the violence involving England fans (allegedly mainly involving [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] groups, such as [[Combat 18]]) at a match against [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]] [[Lansdowne Road football riot|on 15 February 1995]] and violent scenes at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]. Rioting at [[UEFA Euro 2000]] saw introduction of new legislation and wider use of police powers – by  2004, 2,000 banning orders were in place, compared to fewer than 100 before Euro 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimereduction.homeoffice.gov.uk/policing13.htm?w46 Crime | Home Office&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329231137/http://www.crimereduction.homeoffice.gov.uk/policing13.htm?w46 |date=29 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/reducing-crime/football-disorder/ [ARCHIVED CONTENT&amp;#93; Football disorder | Home Office&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318140521/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/reducing-crime/football-disorder/ |date=18 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main reforms to English stadiums came after the [[Taylor Report]] into the [[Hillsborough disaster]] in which 96 people died in 1989. All-seater stadiums became a requirement for clubs in the top two divisions while pitchside fencing was removed and [[closed-circuit camera]]s have been installed. Fans who misbehave can have their tickets revoked and be legally barred from attending games at any English stadium.

The Heysel Stadium itself continued to be used for hosting athletics for almost a decade, but no further football matches took place in the old stadium. In 1994, the stadium was almost completely rebuilt as the [[King Baudouin Stadium]]. On 28 August 1995 the new stadium welcomed the return of football to Heysel in the form of a friendly match between Belgium and Germany. It then hosted a major European final on 8 May 1996 when [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] defeated [[SK Rapid Wien|Rapid Vienna]] 1–0 to win the Cup Winners' Cup.

== Commemorations ==
In 1985, a memorial was presented to the victims at the Juventus headquarters in Piazza Crimea, [[Turin]]. The monument includes an [[epitaph]] written by Torinese journalist [[Giovanni Arpino]]. Since 2001 it has been situated in front of the current club's headquarters in Corso Galileo Ferraris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=Italian |url=http://www.saladellamemoriaheysel.it/Immagini/Lapide.jpg |title=Una foto del monumento a Torino |accessdate=3 June 2010 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 the band [[Revolting Cocks]], founded in part by [[Al Jourgensen]] of [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], released a song by the name of "38", in commemoration to the deaths of this tragic event on the album ''[[Big Sexy Land]]''. {{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

A memorial service for those killed in the disaster was held before Liverpool's match with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at Anfield on 18 August 1985, their first fixture after the disaster. However, according to ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', it was "drowned out" by chanting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Liverpool fans mar service for riot victims|date=19 August 1985|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=31 July 2013|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5jVWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yOcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3228%2C2937361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, a memorial monument for the 39 victims of the disaster, the only one on Italian soil, was inaugurated in [[Reggio Emilia]], the hometown of the victim Claudio Zavaroni, in front of [[Stadio Mirabello]]: every year the committee "Per non dimenticare Heysel" (In order not to forget Heysel) holds a ceremony on 29 May with relatives of the victims, representatives of Juventus, survivors and various supporters clubs from various football clubs, including Inter Milan, AC Milan, Reggiana and Torino.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saladellamemoriaheysel.it/ANNIVERSARI%20e%20CERIMONIE/Anniversari_e_Cerimonie_di_Reggio_Emilia.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amicizia.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Anfield#The Stands|The Kop]] creates a mosaic saying "Amicizia" ("Friendship")]]
During [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]], members of the Italian team left flowers on the site, in honour of the victims.

On 29 May 2005, a £140,000 sculpture was unveiled at the new Heysel stadium, to commemorate the disaster. The monument is a [[sundial]] designed by French artist Patrick Rimoux and includes Italian and Belgian stone and the poem "[[Funeral Blues]]" by Englishman [[W. H. Auden|W.&amp;nbsp;H.&amp;nbsp;Auden]] to symbolise the sorrow of the three countries.  Thirty-nine lights shine, one for each who died that night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2360360/Anniversary-monument-honours-Heysel-dead.html |title=Anniversary monument honours Heysel dead |work= [[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=30 May 2015 | location=London | first=Duncan | last=White | date=30 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juventus and Liverpool were drawn together in the quarter-finals of the [[UEFA Champions League 2004-05|2005 Champions League]], their first meeting since Heysel. Before the first leg at [[Anfield]], Liverpool fans held up placards to form a banner saying "''amicizia''" ("friendship" in Italian). Many of the Juventus fans applauded the gesture, although a significant number chose to turn their backs on it.&lt;ref name="bbc3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4409501.stm |title= Mixed reactions to Heysel homage |work=BBC News |accessdate=15 June 2006 | date=6 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the return leg in Turin, Juventus fans displayed banners reading ''Easy to speak, difficult to pardon: murders'' and ''15-4-89. Sheffield. God exists'', the latter a reference to the [[Hillsborough disaster]], in which 96 Liverpool fans were killed in a crush. A number of Liverpool fans were attacked in the city by Juventus ultras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moore|first=Glenn|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/taunts-and-trouble-mar-juves-attempts-to-deal-with-the-past-5344777.html|title=Taunts and trouble mar Juve's attempts to deal with the past|work=The Independent|date=14 April 2005|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British composer [[Michael Nyman]] wrote a piece called [[Memorial (composition)|"Memorial"]] which was originally part of a larger work of the same name written in 1985 in memory of the Juventus fans who died at Heysel Stadium.

On Wednesday 26 May 2010, a permanent plaque was unveiled on the Centenary Stand at Anfield to honour the Juventus fans who died 25 years earlier. This plaque is one of two permanent memorials to be found at Anfield, along with one for the 96 fans killed in the Hillsborough disaster in 1989.

In May 2012, a Heysel Memorial was unveiled in the [[Juventus Stadium#J-Museum|J-Museum]] at [[Turin]]. There is also a tribute to the disaster's victims in the club's ''Walk of Fame'' in front of the [[Juventus Stadium]]. Two years later Juventus' officials announced a [[memorial]] in the Continassa headquarter.

In February 2014, an exhibition in Turin was dedicated both to the Heysel tragedy and [[Superga air disaster]]. The name of the exhibition was "''Settanta angeli in un unico cielo – Superga e Heysel tragedie sorelle''" (70 angels in the one same heaven – Superga and Heysel sister tragedies) and gathered material from 4 May 1949 and 29 May 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serieaddicted.com/article/heysel-and-superga_juve-and-toro-s-pain-finally-united-in-an-exhibition.php Heysel and Superga: Juve and Toro's pain finally united in an exhibition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129081515/http://www.serieaddicted.com/article/heysel-and-superga_juve-and-toro-s-pain-finally-united-in-an-exhibition.php |date=29 November 2014 }} -''serieaddicted.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, during a [[2014-15 Serie A|Serie A]] match between Juventus and Napoli at Turin, Juventus fans held up placards to form a banner saying "''+39 Rispetto''" ("respect +39" in Italian) including the names of the victims of the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/football/eurobeat-dortmund-farewell-jurgen-klopp-party-time-for-league-winners-juventus-bayern-psg/story-e6frf423-1227367072169|title=EuroBeat: Dortmund farewell Jurgen Klopp, party time for league winners Juventus, Bayern, PSG|work=Fox Sports|accessdate=24 May 2015| date=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 November 2015 Italian Football Federation (FIGC), Juventus' representatives led by Mariella Scirea and J-Museum president Paolo Garimberti and members of the Italian victims association held a ceremony in front of the Heysel monument in King Baudouin Stadium for the 30th anniversary of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|language=Italian|url=http://www.juventus.com/it/news/news/2015/in-memoria-delle-vittime-dell-heysel.php|title=In memoria delle vittime dell'Heysel|publisher=juventus.com|date=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, FIGC president [[Carlo Tavecchio]] announced the retirement of ''Squadra Azzurra'''s number 39 shirt prior to the friendly match between [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|language=Italian|url=http://vivoazzurro.it/figcnews/azzurri-a-bruxelles-30-anni-dopo-la-tragedia-dellheysel-le-iniziative-della-figc/|title=Azzurri a Bruxelles 30 anni dopo la tragedia dell’Heysel: le iniziative della FIGC|work=Vivo Azzurri|publisher=Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio|date=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Il Ballo del Doge Arlecchino.JPG|thumb|A scene from Il Ballo del Doge]]
'''''Il Ballo del Doge''''' ("The [[Doge of Venice|Doge]]’s Ball") is a Venetian [[masquerade ball]], one of the many events held annually during the [[Carnival of Venice]]. The ball itself is held in the 15th-century Venetian palace of [[Palazzo Pisani Moretta]], situated on the [[Grand Canal of Venice|Grand Canal]] in [[Venice]]. The ball's name derives from the title of the elected heads (''[[Doge of Venice|Doge]]'', "Duke" in English) who ruled Venice up until the fall of the Venetian republic in the 18th century.  Every year the ball is attended by around four hundred guests dressed in [[period costume]] and masked.  

The event is a reconstruction of an 18th-century masquerade ball and includes a meal of [[Venetian cuisine]]. Over the years the entertainment has included performances by [[opera]] singers, musicians, [[burlesque]] artists and characters from the [[Commedia dell'Arte]].

==History==
Il Ballo del Doge was born in Venice in 1994, and takes place every year in Venice during the Carnival. Every edition of Il Ballo has a different theme that takes inspiration from the childlike dreams of her inventor, Antonia Sautter, fashion designer and luxury events manager in Venice and worldwide. 
The Press, the Media and the Guests that have succeeded one another throughout the years defined it as the most sumptuous, refined and exclusive masquerade event in the world, and one of the one-hundred things everyone should do at least once in their lifetime. 
Il Ballo del Doge has been described by ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' as "one of the most exclusive parties in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Vanity Fair no. 11 of 11 March 2004 p. 65 "Il Ballo del Doge è una delle feste più esclusive del mondo... Spegnete il telefonino, respirate i profumi e socchiudete gli ochi, abbandonatevi alla notte più bella della vostra vita."&lt;/ref&gt; Guests have included members of European, Middle Eastern and Asian royal families, celebrities, and leaders in international business and finance.

==About Il Ballo del Doge==
'''Il Ballo del Doge''' was born in Venice in 1994, and takes place every year in Venice during the Carnival. Every edition of Il Ballo has a different theme that takes inspiration from the childlike dreams of her inventor, Antonia Sautter, fashion designer and luxury events manager in Venice and worldwide. 
The iconic Palazzo Pisani Moretta is the renowned location that, overlooking the Grand Canal, hosts the event that has reached its XXV edition. 
The Press, the Media and the Guests that have succeeded one another throughout the years defined it as the most sumptuous, refined and exclusive masquerade event in the world, and one of the one-hundred things everyone should do at least once in their lifetime. 
Throughout the years, Il Ballo del Doge, the most famous signature event by '''Antonia Sautter''', has become an extraordinary production that goes beyond the simple party and a true international happening, celebrated by jet setters, celebrities and all dream seekers, thanks to the great consensus gained edition after edition. 
The Guests, wearing the costumes designed and hand-made by Antonia Sautter in her Atelier, which hosts over 1.500 creations she has realised over the years, reach the Palace by water, thus immediately immerging themselves in a  fantastic world made of luxurious decorations, set designs created specifically for every edition’s theme, seamless artistic spectacles with over a hundred performers, refined cuisine and drinks, music, dances and itinerary entertainment until late in the night. 

Il Ballo del Doge celebrated his twenty-fifth edition on Saturday, February 10th, 2018 and, for the occasion, the event had even more resonance than ever. The edition has been titled “Rebirth &amp; Celebration” the set designs, the shows, the menu and every moment of the event were dedicated to the theme of the constant renewal of rebirth and the celebration of emotions, creativity and passion.

Il Ballo del Doge is covered by the international press: TV programmes, newspapers and magazines from all over the world follow the event every year.

The '''Jersey International Air Display''' is an [[air show]] which is held every year on the island of Jersey, in the [[Channel Islands]]. It normally consists of one air display and two static displays - one at the airport and one in a park in St. Helier.

It is a non-profit making event, and relies upon sponsorship and government funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3201929.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - Air display under threat|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main display can be watched by the public, free of charge.

Some of the aircraft carry out displays over [[Guernsey]], as part of the [[Guernsey Air Display]] (formerly the Guernsey Battle of Britain Air Display), on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guernseyairdisplay.co.uk/introduction.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611012645/http://www.guernseyairdisplay.co.uk/introduction.htm |archivedate=June 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HMS Ocean off St Helier Jersey.JPG|thumb|right|HMS Ocean anchored off [[Saint Helier|St. Helier]] during the 2009 show.]]
In 1997, [[Mike Higgins (Jersey politician)|Mike Higgins]] became the display organiser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseyairdisplay.org.uk/whoswho.shtml|title=Jersey International Air Display - Who's Who|author=Darren Dupre|website=Jerseyairdisplay.org.uk|accessdate=2016-04-21|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[HMS Ocean (L12)]] was present, and participated in the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/jersey/8246471.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - Jersey - Island prepares for air display|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 air display was canceled, due to poor visibility, shortly before it was due to start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-14843267|title=Jersey air display is cancelled due to bad weather|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most aircraft which were due to take part had already arrived on the island.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2429">'''Julie Joell Gregory''' (born May 16, 1969 in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]]) is an American author of ''[[Sickened|Sickened: The Memoir of a Munchausen by Proxy Childhood]]'', an autobiographical account of the [[Münchausen syndrome by proxy]] [[child abuse|abuse]] she suffered as a child.

==Personal history==
According to ''Sickened'', Gregory's mother frequently took her to various doctors, coaching her to act sicker than she was and exaggerating her [[symptoms]], and demanding increasingly invasive procedures to [[medical diagnosis|diagnose]] the girl's imaginary illnesses. At home, her mother fed Gregory a diet based on foods a doctor had said Gregory shouldn't have, administered prescription medicine erratically, sometimes in double doses, and filled her days with strenuous physical labor. According to Gregory, her mother even became upset when one doctor would not perform [[open heart surgery]] on her daughter. Also, in the book, Gregory mentions being told by her mother that matches were suckers to eat.

When Gregory finally realized what her mother was doing to her, she attempted to tell several people about the situation, but those she told either expressed disbelief or paid no attention. Only upon telling her work counselor, a professional bound to disclose allegations of abuse to authorities, was the abusive behavior of her parents finally realized by others.

In addition, ''My Father's Keeper'' recounts allegations of [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[emotional abuse]] inflicted by Gregory's father.

==Film Appearances==
Julie Gregory starred in the film ''I Didn’t Think You Didn’t Know I Wasn’t Dead'' by Columbus, Ohio, independent filmmaker Jim Bihari.

The sponsoring organization, Las Madrinas, was founded on October 11, 1933 with 65 founding members including descendants of [[Californio]] land-grant families and local wealthy families,&lt;ref name = "Life" /&gt; mostly from areas like [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] and [[Hancock Park, Los Angeles|Hancock Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wl0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=Las+Madrinas+Ball&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KYPfUdbdB5TUyQHIgYEo&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Las%20Madrinas%20Ball&amp;f=false|title=Las Madrinas Debutante Ball|date=December 1996|work=Los Angeles Magazine|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's mission was to raise funds for what was then called the Convalescent Home of the Children's Hospital by putting on an annual charity ball. Las Madrinas held its first charity ball two months later, on December 15, 1933, at the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore Hotel]]. In 1939 the format was transformed into a debutante ball. The ball was suspended during [[World War II]] and resumed in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lasmadrinasla.org/La_Madrinas/About.html|title=About Las Madrinas|work=Las Madrinas website|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically the debutantes in the Las Madrinas Ball were required to come from families of "money and breeding and social position.”&lt;ref name = "Starr" /&gt;

For the first 25 years press photography was banned; the ban was lifted in 1958 to permit [[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]] to cover the event.&lt;ref name = "Life" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38196">Japan has the second-biggest music industry in the world, although 80 percent of sales are attributed to physical formats. Due to the numerous record companies present in Japan, launching music streaming services has grown difficult, with [[YouTube]] being one of the only prominent streaming services for Japanese music, within and outside the country. Most of the appeal of "homegrown pop idols" restricts access to most Japanese music to the domestic market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.inc.com/ilan-mochari/streaming-music-japan.html |title=Why Japan is resisting the streaming of music |last=Mochari |first=Ilan |date=2015-06-15 |website=[[Inc (magazine)|Inc]] |access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of [[J-pop]] (Japanese pop, rock, etc.) concerts and live appearances held outside of Asia.

'''''Literary Death Match''''' is a reading series co-created in 2006 by [[Todd Zuniga]], [[Elizabeth Koch (publisher)|Elizabeth Koch]], and Dennis DiClaudio. The series features four readers who read their own writing for seven minutes or less, and are then critiqued by three judges (oftentimes actors, comedians, authors, musicians or dancers) in the categories of literary merit, performance and intangibles. The winner is then decided by a literary-skewed, game show-type finale to decide who wins the Literary Death Match crown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kqed.org/arts/literature/article.jsp?essid=22422 KQED Arts], Public Media for Northern California, March 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In the coastal town of [[Minehead]], located in the southwest English county of [[Somerset]], there is a folk custom on May Day entailing the parading of a brightly decorated [[hobby horse]] around the locality.

The origins of the custom are unknown, some say it was used to scare off vikings to prevent attacks, although it was first described in 1830, but a record in a ledger of 1792 mentions paid 5s to hobby horse.

==Description==

The custom takes place during the evenings of the first three days of May, and involves the hobby horse perambulating the port of Minehead.{{sfnm|1a1=Patten|1y=1974|1p=11|2a1=Hutton|2y=1996|2p=82}} The hobby horse measures eight feet in length and three feet in breadth, and consists of a frame covered in a cloth that has been painted with brightly coloured roundels and decorated with ribbons affixed along the top.{{sfnm|1a1=Patten|1y=1974|1p=11|2a1=Hole|2y=1995|2p=201|3a1=Hutton|3y=1996|3p=82}} The wording "Sailors Horse" is written in large capital letters across the side of the cloth.{{sfn|Patten|1974|p=11}} The head of the man carrying the horse protrudes from the middle of the frame; he wears a painted mask with a crested conical hood affixed with coloured ribbons.{{sfnm|1a1=Patten|1y=1974|1p=11|2a1=Hutton|2y=1996|2p=82}} A tail made from rope is also affixed to the horse.{{sfn|Patten|1974|p=11}} The folklorist R. W. Patten observed that "if it were not for the tail, the whole contraption would resemble not so much a horse as a ship, and this perhaps is the key to the riddle".{{sfn|Patten|1974|p=11}}

==History==

The Minehead hobby horse custom was first recorded in 1830.{{sfnm|1a1=Cawte|1y=1978|1p=172|2a1=Hutton|2y=1996|2p=82}}
The folklorist E. C. Cawte suggested that the Minehead hobby horse custom may originally have been conducted around [[Christmas]] time before being transposed to May Day. As evidence, he noted that the majority of hobby horse customs in Britain—such as the [[Mari Lwyd]] in southern Wales and the [[hoodening]] of [[Kent]]—were associated with Christmas.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=77}}

Up until 1913, there was only one recorded hobby horse in active use within the local area.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=168}} The tradition was temporarily halted during the [[First World War]], although in that period some local children made their own variant of the hobby horse.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=168}} 
During the 1920s a second horse was reported as being in use, known as the Dunster Horse; Cawte thought that this was likely a copy of that at Minehead.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=174}}
Cawte also found two independent witnesses who reported that in living memory there had been a hobby horse custom at nearby [[Woodcombe]].{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=174}}

The second horse was incorporated into the custom during the 1960s, initially known as the Alcombe Horse after [[Alcombe, Somerset|Alcombe]], where it was housed.{{sfnm|1a1=Cawte|1y=1978|1p=171|2a1=Hutton|2y=1996|2p=82}} In 1967 the Alcombe Horse troupe introduced a team of Gullivers, and in 1973 they painted the words "Minehead Horse" on the side of the hobby horse.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=171}} 

As of the 1970s, there was a second horse known as the Town Horse, which was owned by a man known as L. Pidgeon who lived in Alcombe; this hobby horse was brought to dance outside of the Hobby Horse Hotel with a team of [[Morris dancing|Morris Men]].{{sfn|Patten|1974|p=12}}
In 1974, Patten stated that there had been a third hobby horse, the Dunster Horse, which had "died out" about fifty years previously but which had recently been revived.{{sfn|Patten|1974|p=12}}
In the 1970s, Patten observed that the tradition "does not appear to have altered in essentials" from its early accounts.{{sfn|Patten|1974|p=11}}

Minehead is located eighty miles away from the Cornish coastal town of [[Padstow]], which has a similar May Day custom involving the procession of a hobby horse.{{sfnm|1a1=Cawte|1y=1978|1p=168|2a1=Hutton|2y=1996|2p=82}} The folklorist [[Christina Hole]] stated that while the Minehead hobby horse was different in design from that of Padstow, it was "no less impressive".{{sfn|Hole|1995|p=201}} In 1978, Cawte noted that the Minehead custom had "never been so fashionable" as its Padstow counterpart, and that as such it had received less research from folklorists and historians.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=157}} He also reported that among Minehead locals there was a claim that the Padstow hobby horse had been created by Cornish sailors after they had observed that at Minehead.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=177}}

24 miles west of Minehead, in the [[North Devon]] coastal town of [[Combe Martin]], a hobby horse custom was recorded as existing in the early nineteenth century but which had ended in 1837.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|pp=174–175}} In this custom, a procession traversed the town on [[Ascension Day]]; it included not only the Hobby Horse but also Grenadiers, figures identified as the fool and the 'Early of Rone', and a real donkey.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|pp=174–175}} In the 1970s, Cawte reported that Minehead locals claimed that there had once been a rivalry between their hobby horse and that at Combe Martin, although he added that there was no corroborating evidence to suggest that this piece of folklore was historically accurate.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=177}}

{{Campaignbox Mongol invasions}}
The '''{{nihongo|Mongol invasions of Japan|元寇|Genkō}}''', which took place in 1274 and 1281, were major [[military]] efforts undertaken by [[Kublai Khan]] to conquer the [[Japanese archipelago]] after the submission of [[Goryeo]] ([[Korea]]) to vassaldom. Ultimately a failure, the invasion attempts are of [[Macrohistory|macro-historical]] importance because they set a limit on Mongol expansion and rank as nation-defining events in the [[history of Japan]].

The Mongol invasions are considered a precursor to [[early modern warfare]]. One of the most notable technological innovations during the war was the use of explosive, hand-thrown bombs.&lt;ref name="Turnbull2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Turnbull|title=The Mongol Invasions of Japan 1274 and 1281|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qo4amAg_ygIC&amp;pg=PT41|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=19 February 2013|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-4728-0045-9|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invasions are referred to in many works of fiction, and are the earliest events for which the word ''[[Kamikaze (typhoon)|kamikaze]]'' ("divine wind") is widely used, originating in reference to the two [[typhoon]]s faced by the Mongol fleets.

==Background==
After a series of [[Mongol invasions of Korea]] between 1231 and 1281, [[Goryeo]] signed a treaty in favor of the [[Mongols]] and became a [[vassal state]]. Kublai was declared [[Khagan]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] in 1260 (although this was not widely recognized by the Mongols in the west) and established his capital at [[Khanbaliq]] (within modern [[Beijing]]) in 1264.

Japan at the time was ruled by the [[Shikken]] (shogunate regents) of the [[Hōjō clan]], who had intermarried with and wrested control from [[Minamoto no Yoriie]], ''[[shōgun]]'' of the [[Kamakura shogunate]], after his death in 1203. The inner circle of the Hōjō clan had become so preeminent that they no longer consulted the council of the shogunate ({{nihongo||評定|Hyōjō}}), the Imperial Court of [[Kyoto]], or their [[gokenin]] vassals, and made their decisions at private meetings in their residences ({{nihongo||寄合|yoriai}}).

The Mongols also made attempts to subjugate the native peoples of [[Sakhalin]]—the [[Ainu people|Ainu]], [[Orok people|Orok]], and [[Nivkh people]]s—from 1260 to 1308.&lt;ref&gt;''The conquest of Ainu lands: ecology and culture in Japanese expansion, 1590–1800'' By Brett L. Walker, p.133&lt;/ref&gt;

Now stored in [[Tōdai-ji]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], [[Japan]].]]

In 1266, Kublai Khan dispatched emissaries to Japan with a letter saying:
{{quote|Cherished by the [[Mandate of Heaven]], the Great Mongol emperor sends this letter to the king of Japan. The sovereigns of small countries, sharing borders with each other, have for a long time been concerned to communicate with each other and become friendly. Especially since my ancestor governed at heaven's command, innumerable countries from afar disputed our power and slighted our virtue. Goryeo rendered thanks for my ceasefire and for restoring their land and people when I ascended the throne. Our relation is feudatory like a father and son. We think you already know this. Goryeo is my eastern tributary. Japan was allied with Goryeo and sometimes with China since the founding of your country; however, Japan has never dispatched ambassadors since my ascending the throne. We are afraid that the Kingdom is yet to know this. Hence we dispatched a mission with our letter particularly expressing our wishes. Enter into friendly relations with each other from now on. We think all countries belong to one family. How are we in the right, unless we comprehend this? Nobody would wish to resort to arms.&lt;ref&gt;Original text in Chinese: 上天眷命大蒙古國皇帝奉書日本國王朕惟自古小國之君境土相接尚務講信修睦況我祖宗受天明命奄有區夏遐方異域畏威懷德者不可悉數朕即位之初以高麗無辜之民久瘁鋒鏑即令罷兵還其疆域反其旄倪高麗君臣感戴來朝義雖君臣歡若父子計王之君臣亦已知之高麗朕之東藩也日本密邇高麗開國以來亦時通中國至於朕躬而無一乘之使以通和好尚恐王國知之未審故特遣使持書布告朕志冀自今以往通問結好以相親睦且聖人以四海為家不相通好豈一家之理哉以至用兵夫孰所好王其圖之不宣至元三年八月日&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kublai essentially demanded that Japan become a [[vassal]] and send tribute under a threat of conflict. However, the emissaries returned empty-handed. A second set of emissaries were sent in 1268, returning empty-handed like the first. Both sets of emissaries met with the [[Chinzei Bugyō]], or Defense Commissioner for the West, who passed on the message to [[Shikken]], [[Hōjō Tokimune]], Japan's ruler in Kamakura and to the [[Emperor of Japan]] in [[Kyoto]].

After discussing the letters with his inner circle, there was much debate, but the Shikken had his mind made up; he had the emissaries sent back with no answer. The Mongols continued to send demands, some through [[Koreans|Korean emissaries]] and some through Mongol ambassadors on March 7, 1269; September 17, 1269; September 1271; and May 1272. However, each time, the bearers were not permitted to land in Kyushu.

The Imperial Court suggested compromise,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Bradley ''Japan: A History in Art'' 1979 p.107&lt;/ref&gt; but really had little effect in the matter, due to political marginalization after the [[Jōkyū War]]. The uncompromising shogunate ordered all those who held fiefs in Kyūshū, the area closest to the [[Korean Peninsula]] and thus most likely to be attacked, to return to their lands and forces in Kyūshū moved west, further securing the most likely landing points.

After acknowledging its importance, the Imperial Court led great prayer services, and much government business was put off to deal with this crisis.

==First invasion preparations==
The Khan was willing to go to war as early as 1268 after having been rebuffed twice, but found that his empire did not have the resources to provide him with a sufficient navy at that time. With Mongol entry into the Korean court by marriage of the Korean crown prince to Kublai Khan's daughter, a mass construction of ships began on Korea's south-eastern shores, &lt;!-- http://www.taots.co.uk/content/view/25/30/ Mongol Invasion 1274–1281 -- Dead link --&gt; while the Mongols continued to demand Japan's surrender.

Kublai Khan founded the [[Yuan dynasty]] in 1271. In 1272, [[Chungnyeol of Goryeo|King Chungnyeol]] offered counsel to Kublai Khan. According to [[Goryeosa]],
''Japan is yet to know the world is hallowed. So dispatch emissaries and convey our military power to Japan. Battle ships and military rations are well prepared.

== First invasion (1274) ==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2017}}&lt;!--4 paragraphs have no citations--&gt;
According to the Yuanshi, the Yuan fleet set out with an estimated 15,000 Mongol and Chinese soldiers and 1,600–8,000 Korean soldiers in 300 large vessels and 400–500 smaller craft along with several thousand sailors, although figures vary considerably depending on the source and many modern historians consider the numbers exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; The primary port for the operation was [[Quanzhou]] in [[Fujian]], then the center of China's maritime trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=Zaiton |last=Allaire |first=Gloria |contribution-url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=-OmCfNI_SxAC&amp;pg=PA663 |title=Trade, Travel, and Exploration in the Middle Ages: An Encyclopedia |editor=John Block Friedman |editor2=Kristen Mossler Figg |display-editors=0 |editor3=Scott D. Westrem |editor4=Gregory G. Guzman |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon |date=2000 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; They landed on Komodahama beach on [[Tsushima Island]] on October 5, 1274. [[Sō clan|Sō]] Sukekuni, governor of Tsushima, led a cavalry unit of 80 to defend the island, but he and his outnumbered unit were killed in the engagement.

The Mongols and Koreans subsequently invaded [[Iki Island|Iki]]. Tairano Takakage, the Governor of Iki, fought the invaders with about 100 of his cavalrymen, but he [[Seppuku|killed himself]] after his unit was defeated.

The Mongol forces landed on November 19 in [[Hakata Bay]], a short distance from [[Dazaifu, Fukuoka|Dazaifu]], the ancient administrative capital of Kyūshū. The following day brought the [[Battle of Bun'ei]] (文永の役), also known as the "First Battle of Hakata Bay". The Japanese coalition force opposing them included 120 armed samurai each with a warband and likely numbered between 3,000 and 6,000 strong.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull 2013: "About 120 armed samurai received rewards for their participation in 1275... If the average warband was 50-strong then the Japanese defenders may have been about 6,000. Other non-rewarded samurai took part, some with as few as one follower, so perhaps a figure between 3,000 and 6,000 is most likely for 1274."&lt;/ref&gt; Later accounts have both sides believing themselves to be drastically outnumbered by the enemy; the Yuanshi provides an estimate of 102,000 for the Japanese force, while the Japanese ''Hachiman Gudokun'' describes the invaders as outnumbering the Japanese 10 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull 2013, p. 42: "For partial justification of their defeat in 1274, the number of Japanese warriors ranged against the invaders is given in the Yuan Shi as the very unlikely figure of 102,000&amp;nbsp;... Hachiman Gudokun, by contrast, sees the brave Japanese as being outnumbered by the Mongols by a factor of ten to one."&lt;/ref&gt; Conlan argues that the Yuanshi's account of the battle suggests that both the Japanese and Yuan forces were of similar size. Conlan estimated that both armies numbered around 3,000 each (not including the Yuan sailors).&lt;ref name="Conlan, p. 264"&gt;Conlan, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese were inexperienced in managing such a large force (all of North Kyūshū had been mobilized), and the Mongols made significant initial progress. It had been approximately 50 years since the last major combat event in Japan ([[Go-Toba]]'s adherents in 1221), leaving not a single Japanese general with adequate experience in moving large bodies of troops. In addition, the style of warfare that was customary within feudal Japan involved [[single combat]], even on large battlefields.

The Mongols possessed foreign weapons which included superior long-range armaments (the short composite bows that the Mongols were famous for, with poisoned arrows, fire arrows, bow-launched arrows with small rocket engines attached and gunpowder-packed exploding arrows and grenades with ceramic shells thrown by slings to terrify the enemy's horses), and easily had the upper hand in open land combat. The Japanese force at Hakata Bay needed time to await the arrival of reinforcements, with which they would be able to overwhelm the Mongol invaders.

Around nightfall, the Mongol ship captains suggested that the land force reembark in order to avoid the risk of being marooned on Japanese soil. Hong Dagu, the commander of the exhausted Mongolian army, further decided in a military meeting for withdrawal from Japan. For the ships at that time the navigation to north, i.e. from Hakata to Korea's south-eastern shores, was risky, if not in daytime and under south wind. However, they pressed ahead the retreating action in night and met a stormy wind. Some accounts offer casualty reports that suggest 200 Mongol ships were lost. However, small Japanese boats were much more swift and maneuverable than Mongol ships, and the Japanese were able to board the remaining ships of the crippled Mongol army. The samurai approached and boarded the ships under cover of darkness and fell on the invaders ferociously. In the small confines of the ships, during the predawn darkness, the Mongols (trained as cavalrymen and horse archers) were unable to bring their bows to bear effectively. However, the long, thin Japanese swords got stuck and snapped off in the thick, boiled leather armor of the Mongols, causing Japanese blacksmiths to reevaluate their swords after the first invasion. This led to the beginning of the divergence of the [[katana]] from existing [[tachi]] swords in the 13th and 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Sato 105&lt;/ref&gt;

A story widely known in Japan is that back in Kamakura, Tokimune was overcome with fear when the invasion finally came, and wanting to overcome his cowardice, he asked [[Mugaku Sogen]], his [[Zen master]] also known as Bukko, for advice. Bukko replied he had to sit in meditation to find the source of his cowardice in himself. Tokimune went to Bukko and said, "Finally there is the greatest happening of my life." Bukko asked, "How do you plan to face it?" Tokimune screamed, "''Katsu!''" ("Victory!") as if he wanted to scare all the enemies in front of him. Bukko responded with satisfaction, "It is true that the son of a lion roars as a lion!"&lt;ref name="Clements2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Clements|title=A Brief History of the Samurai|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MBaeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT93|date=7 February 2013|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=978-1-4721-0772-5|pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, Tokimune was instrumental in spreading [[Zen]] and [[Bushido]] in Japan among the samurai.

== Main battles of Battle of Bun'ei ==

=== Battle of Tsushima Island – Mongol victory ===
On October 5, About 1,000 soldiers of the Mongolian Army landed at [[Komoda Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;『八幡ノ蒙古記』「同十一年十月五日卯時に、對馬國府八幡宮假御殿の内より、火焔おひたゝしく、もえいつ、國府在家の人々、焼亡出来しよと見るに、もゆへき物もなきを、怪しみけるほとに、同日申時に、對馬の西おもて、佐須浦に、異國船見ゆ、」（１ウ）其数四五百艘はかりに、凡三四萬人もやあらんと、見るはかり寄来る、同日酉時、國府の地頭につく、即地頭宗馬允資國、八十餘騎、同日丑時、彼浦にゆきつく、翌日卯時、通人真継男を使者として、蒙古人に、事のしさいを尋る処に、散々に舟よりいる、大船七八艘より、あさち原へ、おりたつ勢、一千人もあらんと見ゆ、其時、宗馬允、陣をとりて戦ふ、いはなつ矢に異國人、数しらす、いとらる、此中に大将軍と、おほし」（２オ）き者四人、あし毛なる馬にのりて、一はんに、かけむかふ者、宗馬弥二郎に右の乳の上を、いられて、馬よりおつ、此時、馬允に射倒さるゝ者、四人、宗馬允かく戦ふといへとも、終にうたれぬ、同子息宗馬次郎、養子弥二郎、同八郎親頼、刑部丞郎等に三郎、庄太郎、入道源八、在廰左近馬允手人、肥後國御家人、口井藤三、源三郎、已上十二人、同時に討死す、蒙古、佐須浦に火をつけて、焼拂ふよし、宗馬允か郎等、小太郎、兵衛次郎」（２ウ）博多にわたりて告しらす、」&lt;/ref&gt; {{illm|Sō Sukekuni|ja|宗助国}} (宗助国), [[Shugodai]] of [[Tsushima Island]] was killed in action.
The Mongolians slaughtered many dwellers of Tsushima island.&lt;ref&gt;『高麗史』 巻一百四 列伝十七 金方慶「入對馬島、撃殺甚衆」&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Battle of Iki Island – Mongol victory ===
On October 14, {{illm|Taira no Kagetaka|ja|平景隆}}, Shugodai of Iki led about 100 soldiers. They were defeated by the Mongolian army and he committed suicide in [[Hizume Castle]] (樋詰城).&lt;ref&gt;『八幡ノ蒙古記』「同十四日申時に壱岐嶋の西おもてに蒙古の兵船つく、其中に二艘より四百人はかりおりて、赤旗をさして東の方を三度、敵の方を三度拜す、其時、守護代平内左衛門尉景隆并御家人百餘騎、庄三郎か城の前にて矢合す、蒙古人か矢は、二時はかりいる間に守護代か方にも二人手負、異敵は大勢なり、終に叶ふへくもなかりけれは、城のうちへ引退て合戦す、同十五日に、攻めおとされ」（３オ）て城の内にて自害す、」&lt;/ref&gt; About 1,000 Japanese soldiers were killed there.

=== Battle of Hirado Island , Taka Island and Nokono Island – Mongol victory ===
On October 16 to 17, the Mongolian army attacked the base of the [[Sashi clan]]. Hundreds of Japanese soldiers and {{illm|Sashi Fusashi|ja|佐志房}}, [[Sashi Tomaru]] (佐志留) and [[Sashi Isamu]] (佐志勇) were killed.&lt;ref&gt;『八幡ノ蒙古記』「同十六□（日カ）、十七日の間、平戸、能古、鷹嶋の男女多く捕らる、松浦黨敗す。」&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Battle of Akasaka – Japanese victory ===
[[File:Mōko Shūrai Ekotoba e2.jpg|center|thumb|upright=2|Kagesuke Shoni and his forces in Akasaka]]
The Mongolian Army landed on [[Sawara District]] and encamped at Akasaka.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;『蒙古襲来絵詞』詞四「たけふさ（武房）にけうと（凶徒）あかさか（赤坂）のちん（陣）をか（駆）けお（落）とされて、ふたて（二手）になりて、おほせい（大勢）はすそはら（麁原）にむ（向）きてひ（退）く。こせい（小勢）はへふ（別府）のつかハら（塚原）へひ（退）く、」&lt;/ref&gt; On seeing this situation, [[Kikuchi Takefusa]] surprised the Mongolian army.  The Mongolians escaped to [[Sohara]], after losing about 100 soldiers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

=== Battle of Torikai-Gata – Japanese victory ===
[[File:Mōko Shūrai Ekotoba4.JPG|center|thumb|upright=3.5|Suenaga and escaping Mongolians]]
Thousands of Mongolian soldiers were massed in [[Torikai-Gata]]. [[Takezaki Suenaga]] (竹崎季長), one of the Japanese commanders, attacked the Mongolian army and fought them.
Soon, reinforcements led by {{illm|Shiraishi Michiyasu|ja|白石通泰}} arrived and defeated the Mongolians soundly. The Mongolian casualties of this battle were about 3,500.&lt;ref&gt;『高麗史』 巻八十七　表巻第二「十月、金方慶與元元帥忽敦洪茶丘等征日本、至壹岐戰敗、軍不還者萬三千五百餘人」&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Withdrawal of Mongol army ===
Due to the defeat in battle of Torikai-Gata, the Mongolian army was exhausted and withdrew to their ships. On seeing this situation, the Japanese army engaged in night attacks and killed many soldiers.
Finally, [[Hong Dagu]] decided to withdraw to the Yuan-held continent. In the midst of withdrawal, they met a stromy wind, most of their ships sank and many soldiers drowned.&lt;ref&gt;『高麗史』巻一百四 列伝十七 金方慶「諸軍與戰、及暮乃解、方慶謂忽敦茶丘曰、『兵法千里縣軍、其鋒不可當、我師雖少、已入敵境、人自爲戰、即孟明焚船淮陰背水也、請復戰』、忽敦曰、『兵法小敵之堅、大敵之擒、策疲乏之兵、敵日滋之衆、非完計也、不若回軍』復亨中流矢、先登舟、遂引兵還、會夜大風雨(met a stromy wind at that night)、戰艦觸岩多敗、?堕水死、到合浦、」&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments leading to the second invasion==
[[File:Takezaki suenaga ekotoba bourui.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The defensive wall at [[Hakata-ku, Fukuoka|Hakata]]]]

Starting in 1274, the shogunate increased efforts to defend against the second invasion, which they thought was sure to come. In addition to better organizing the samurai of Kyūshū, they ordered the construction of forts and a large stone wall (石塁, Sekirui), and other defensive structures at many potential landing points, including Hakata Bay, where a two meter high wall was constructed in 1276.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sitereports.nabunken.go.jp/16694|title=福岡市今津元寇防塁発掘調査概報|last=福岡市教育委員会|first=|date=1969|website=Comprehensive Database of Archaeological Site Reports in Japan|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious services increased and the [[Hakozaki Shrine]], having been destroyed by the Yuan forces, was rebuilt. A coastal watch was instituted and rewards were given to some 120 valiant samurai. There was even a plan for a raid on Goryeo (modern-day [[Korea]]) to be carried out by Shōni Tsunesuke, a general from Kyūshū, though this was never executed.

After the failed invasion, Kublai Khan was tired of being ignored and not being allowed to land, so five Yuan emissaries were dispatched in September 1275 and sent to Kyūshū, refusing to leave without a reply. Tokimune responded by having them sent to Kamakura and then beheading them.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Edward J. (1881). {{Google books|sYsIAAAAIAAJ|''Japan: its History, Traditions, and Religions'', p. 291.|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graves of those five executed Yuan emissaries exist to this day at [[Jōryū-Ji|Jōryū Temple]] in [[Fujisawa, Kanagawa]], near the [[Tatsunokuchi]] Execution Place in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kamakura-burabura.com/meisyoenosimajyourituji.htm|title=常立寺|author=|date=|website=www.kamakura-burabura.com|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812201903/http://www.kamakura-burabura.com/meisyoenosimajyourituji.htm|archivedate=12 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then again on July 29, 1279, five more Yuan emissaries were sent in the same manner, and again beheaded, this time in [[Hakata-ku, Fukuoka|Hakata]]. Expecting another invasion, on Feb 21, 1280, the Imperial Court ordered all temples and shrines to pray for victory over the Yuan.

==Second invasion (1281)==
[[File:Takezaki suenaga ekotoba3.jpg|thumb|350px|Japanese [[samurai]] boarding Yuan ships in 1281.]]

In the spring of 1281, the Mongols sent two separate forces. Per the Yuanshi, an impressive force of 900 ships containing 17,000 sailors, 10,000 Korean soldiers, and 15,000 Mongols and Chinese set out from Masan, Korea, while an even larger force of 100,000 sailed from southern China in 3,500 ships, for a combined force of 142,000 soldiers and sailors. Japanese sources also mention 150,000 men in the invading force.&lt;ref name="Conlan, p. 264"/&gt; Many modern historians believe these to be exaggerated figures, as were common in medieval chronicles. Professor Thomas Conlan states that they were likely exaggerated by an order of magnitude (implying 14,000 soldiers and sailors), expressing skepticism that a medieval kingdom managed an invasion on the scale of [[D-Day]] during World War II across over ten times the distance, and questions if even 10,000 soldiers attacked Japan in 1281.&lt;ref name="Conlan, p. 264"/&gt; Morris Rossabbi states that Conlan was correct in his assertion that the invasion force was much smaller than traditionally believed, but argues that the expenditures lavished on the mission confirm that the fighting force was sizable and much larger than 10,000 soldiers and 4,000 sailors. He puts forward the alternative figure of 70,000 soldiers and sailors, half of what is spoken of in the Yuanshi and later Japanese claims.&lt;ref&gt;Rossabi, Morris. "Khubilai Khan: His Life and Times." 1988. Page xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Turnbull thinks that 140,000+ is an exaggeration, but does not offer his own precise estimate for the size of the army. Rather, he only states that given the contributions of the Southern Song, the second invasion should have been around three times larger than the first. As he earlier listed the common figure of 23,000 for the first invasion uncritically, unlike the estimate of 140,000+ for the second, that would imply an invasion force of ~70,000, on par with Rossabbi's estimate.&lt;ref&gt;Turbull 2013, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mongols' plan called for an overwhelming coordinated attack by the combined imperial Yuan fleets. The Chinese fleet of the Yuan was delayed by difficulties in provisioning and manning the large number of ships they had.&lt;ref name="Elements, p. 14"&gt;Winters, Harold ''et al.'' (2001). {{Google books|ZgUvVb0XXG8C|''Battling the Elements,'' p. 14.|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mongol fleet set sail, suffered heavy losses at Tsushima, and turned back. In the summer, the fleet took Iki-shima and moved on to Kyūshū, landing at several different locations. In a number of individual skirmishes, known collectively as the [[Battle of Kōan|Kōan Campaign]] (弘安の役) or the "Second Battle of Hakata Bay", the Mongol forces were driven back to their ships. The Japanese army was heavily outnumbered, but had fortified the coastal line with two-meter high walls, and was easily able to repulse the auxiliaries that were launched against it. Beginning August 15, the now-famous ''[[Kamikaze (typhoon)|kamikaze]]'', a massive typhoon, assaulted the shores of Kyūshū for two days straight, and destroyed much of the Mongol fleet.&lt;ref name="Elements, p. 14"/&gt; Sensing the oncoming typhoon, Korean and south Chinese mariners retreated and unsuccessfully docked in Imari Bay where they were destroyed by the storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=FvYRDAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP6&amp;dq=mongol+invasion+of+japan&amp;ots=LXeJrWKV1w&amp;sig=7_UJTM3ebQydVwZX-2kCp09qYrY#v=onepage&amp;q=mongol+invasion+of+japan&amp;f=false|title=Divine Wind: The History and Science of Hurricanes|first1=Kerry|last1=Emanuel|first2=Professor Department of Earth Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences Program in Atmospheres Oceans and Climate Kerry|last2=Emanuel|date=1 September 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|accessdate=30 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, it is now believed that the destruction of the Mongol fleet was greatly facilitated by an additional factor. Most of the invasion force was composed of hastily acquired flat-bottomed Chinese riverboats and ships built in Goryeo and all of a similar type. According to Goryeosa, [[Southern Song]]-type ships were too costly and their construction was too slow, so the traditional types were constructed instead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Goryeosa]] [http://kindai.ndl.go.jp/BIImgFrame.php?JP_NUM=50001638&amp;VOL_NUM=00003&amp;KOMA=125&amp;ITYPE=0 『高麗史』 列伝巻十七 「若依蛮様則工費多将不及期」「用本國船様督造」 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212114322/http://kindai.ndl.go.jp/BIImgFrame.php?JP_NUM=50001638&amp;VOL_NUM=00003&amp;KOMA=125&amp;ITYPE=0 |date=2009-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such ships (unlike ocean-going ships, which have a curved keel to prevent capsizing) were difficult to use on high seas, let alone during a massive typhoon.

== Main battles of the Kōan Campaign ==

=== Battle of Tsushima Island – Japanese victory ===
On May 21, the Mongolian Army landed on Tsushima island and invaded. They met fierce resistance there and later withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;『高麗史』 巻一百四 列伝十七 金方慶「方慶與忻都茶丘朴球金周鼎等發、至日本世界村大明浦」&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Battle of Shikano Island – Japanese victory ===
[[File:Mōko Shūrai Ekotoba e20(2).JPG|thumb|Japanese soldiers in Shikano Island]]

On June 3, the Mongolians attempted a landing on Shikano island, but were unable to make significant advances. By June 6, Mongolian forces had control of most of the island, but on the morning of June 8, the Japanese army divided their force into two and attacked along [[Umi no Nakamichi]].&lt;ref&gt;『高麗史節要』巻二十 十四葉 忠烈王七年六月壬申（八日）「六月壬申（八日）、金方慶金周鼎e朴球朴之亮荊萬戸等、與日本兵力戰、斬首三百餘級、官軍潰、茶丘乗馬走、王萬戸復横撃之、斬五十餘級、日本兵之退、茶丘僅免、翼日復戰敗績、」&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Japanese army lost 300 soldiers but defeated [[Hong Dagu]], who nearly died in this battle, and Zhang Cheng.&lt;ref&gt;『高麗史』巻一百四 列伝十七 金方慶「六月、方慶周鼎球之亮荊萬戸等、與日本兵合戰、斬三百餘級、日本兵突進、官軍潰、茶丘棄馬走、王萬戸復横撃之、斬五十餘級、日本兵之退、茶丘僅免、翼日復戰敗績、」&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 9 Zhang Cheng solidified the defense of his army but the Mongolian army was again defeated by the fierce Japanese attacks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;『元敦武校尉管軍上百戸張成墓碑銘』「（至元）十八年、樞密院檄君、仍管新附□□（軍百？）率所統、?千戸岳公琇、往征倭、四月□（發？）合浦登海州、以六月六日至倭之志賀島、夜将半、賊兵□□來襲、君與所部據艦戦、至暁、賊船廻退、八日、賊遵陸復來、君率纏弓弩、先登岸迎敵、奪占其□要、賊弗能前、日?、賊軍復集、又返敗之、明日、倭大會兵來戦、君統所部、入陣奮戦、賊不能□（支？）殺傷過□（當？）賊敗去。」&lt;/ref&gt; After this defeat the Mongolian army escaped to Iki Island.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Battle of Iki Island – Japanese victory ===
[[Image:Mooko-SamuraiShips.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|Tsunesuke Shoni and Hisatsune Shimazu]]

On June 29, a Japanese army of approximately 10,000, led by the [[Matsura clan]], [[Ryūzōji clan]] and [[Takagi clan]] began an all-out attack on Iki Island.&lt;ref&gt;『歴代鎮西要略』&lt;/ref&gt; 
On July 2, [[Ryōzōji Iekiyo]] landed on [[Setoura beach]] and defeated the Mongolian army. As a result, the Mongolian army abandoned Iki Island and withdrew to [[Hirado Island]].&lt;ref&gt;『元史』巻一百五十四　列傳第四十一 洪福源・附洪俊奇「十七年、授龍虎衞上將軍、征東行省右丞、十八年、與右丞欣都、將舟師四萬、由高麗金州合浦以進、時右丞范文虎等、將兵十萬、由慶元、定海等処渡海、期至日本一岐、平戸等島合兵登岸、兵未交、秋八月、風壞舟而還。」&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Battle of Taka Island – annihilation of Mongol army ===
[[File:Mōko Shūrai Ekotoba e17.JPG|thumb|Fierce battle in Taka Island]]

On July 7, there were about 100,000 soldiers of the Mongol army without commanders.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;『薩摩比志島文書』比志島時範軍忠状案「次月七月七日鷹嶋合戦之時、自陸地馳向事、爰時範依合戦之忠勤、爲預御裁許、粗言上如件、　弘安五年二月　日」&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;『薩摩比志島文書』島津長久證状「同閏七月七日鷹嶋合戦之時、五郎次郎自陸地馳向候之条、令見知候了、若此條僞申候者、日本國中大少神罸可罷蒙長久之身候、恐惶謹言、　弘安五年四月十五日　大炊助長久」&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;『江上系図』「西牟田彌次郎永家。弘安四年。大元大將督六万艘十万人。寇鎭西。此時永家戰于松浦之鷹島抽功。於是爲之賞。肥前國神崎郡中數箇。」&lt;/ref&gt; Upon realizing this situation, the Japanese army launched an attack. [[Togo Korechika]], [[Togo Koretoo]], [[Fujiwara Sukekado]] and [[Shimazu Nagahisa]]
annihilated the remaining Mongolian army and took 20,000 to 30,000 prisoners in this battle.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; At the completion of this battle, Japan's victory was confirmed.

==Military significance==
From a military perspective, the failed invasions of [[Kublai Khan]] were the first of only three instances when the samurai fought foreign troops rather than amongst themselves; the others being [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)]] and the Japanese [[invasion of Ryukyu]] (1609). It is also the first time samurai clans fought for the sake of Japan itself instead of for more narrowly defined clan interests. The invasions also exposed the Japanese to an alien fighting style which, lacking the [[single combat]] that characterized traditional samurai combat, they saw as inferior. This difference is noted in the ''Hachiman Gudōkun'':
{{quote|According to our manner of fighting we must first call out by name someone from the enemy ranks, and then attack in single combat. But the Mongols took no notice at all of such conventions. They rushed forward all together in a mass, grappling with any individuals they could catch and killing them.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, Stephen R. (2003). {{Google books|N2MMD0yfxyAC|''Genghis Khan and the Mongol Conquests 1190–1400'', p. 19.|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The Mongol method of advances and withdrawals accompanied by bells, drums and war cries was also unknown in Japan, as was the technique of Mongolian archers, which involved shooting arrows ''en masse'' into the air rather than long-ranged one-on-one combat. The Zen Buddhism of Hojo Tokimune and his Zen master Bukko had gained credibility beyond national boundaries, and the first mass followings of Zen teachings among samurai began to flourish.

The Mongol invasions of Japan facilitated a change in the designs of Japanese swords. Thin [[tachi]] and [[Chokutō|chokuto]] style blades were often unable to cut through the boiled leather armor of the Mongols, with the blades often chipping or breaking off.&lt;ref&gt;Satō, Kanzan. Kodansha International. 1983. Page 104&lt;/ref&gt; Tachi blades were shortened and thickened, with the katana eventually being introduced as a result.

The failed invasions also mark the first use of the word ''kamikaze'' ("Divine Wind").  The fact that the typhoon that helped Japan defeat the Mongol Navy in the first invasion occurred in late November, well after the normal Pacific typhoon season (May to October), perpetuated the Japanese belief that they would never be defeated or successfully invaded, which remained an important aspect of Japanese foreign policy until the very end of [[World War II]]. The failed invasions also demonstrated a weakness of the Mongols – the inability to mount naval invasions successfully&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/mongols/china/china4_a.htm|title=The Mongols in World History {{!}} Asia Topics in World History|website=afe.easia.columbia.edu|access-date=2018-04-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20070927181841/http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/mongols/china/china4_a.htm|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Mongol invasions of Vietnam]].) After the death of Kublai, his successor, [[Temür Khan]], unsuccessfully demanded the submission of Japan in 1295.

The Mongols and the Ashikaga shogunate of Japan made peace in the late 14th century during the reign of [[Toghon Temür]], the last Yuan emperor in Khanbaliq. Long before the peace agreement, there was stable trade in [[East Asia]] under the dominance of the Mongols and Japan.

As a consequence of the destruction of the Mongol fleets, Japan's independence was guaranteed. Simultaneously, a power struggle within Japan led to the dominance of military governments and diminishing Imperial power.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Paul K.

The Mongol invasions are an early example of gunpowder warfare. One of the most notable technological innovations during the war was the use of explosive bombs.&lt;ref name="Turnbull2013"/&gt; The bombs are known in Chinese as "thunder crash bombs" and were fired from catapults, inflicting damage on enemy soldiers. An illustration of a bomb is depicted in a Japanese scroll, showing their use by the Mongols against mounted samurai. Archaeological evidence of the use of gunpowder was finally confirmed when multiple shells of the explosive bombs were discovered in an underwater shipwreck off the shore of Japan by the Kyushu Okinawa Society for Underwater Archaeology. X-rays by Japanese scientists of the excavated shells provided proof that they contained gunpowder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Delgado|first=James|title=Relics of the Kamikaze|journal=Archaeology|date=February 2003|volume=56|issue=1|publisher=Archaeological Institute of America|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/0301/etc/kamikaze.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229155139/http://archive.archaeology.org/0301/etc/kamikaze.html|archivedate=2013-12-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38541">The '''Moscow Trials''' were a series of trials held in the [[Soviet Union]] at the instigation of [[Joseph Stalin]] between 1936 and 1938 against so-called [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] and members of [[Right Opposition]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. 

There were three Moscow Trials that included the Case of the Trotskyite-Zinovievite Terrorist Center ([[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]]-[[Lev Kamenev|Kamenev]] Trial, aka "Trial of the Sixteen," 1936), the Case of the Anti-Soviet Trotskyist Center ([[Yuri Pyatakov|Pyatakov]]-[[Karl Radek|Radek]] Trial, 1937), and the Case of the Anti-Soviet "Bloc of Rights and Trotskyites" ([[Nikolai Bukharin|Bukharin]]-[[Alexey Rykov|Rykov]] Trial, aka "Trial of the Twenty-One," 1938). 

The defendants of these were [[Old Bolshevik]] party leaders and top officials of the Soviet [[secret police]]. Most defendants were charged under [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)|Article 58 of the RSFSR Penal Code]] with conspiring with the western powers to assassinate Stalin and other Soviet leaders, dismember the Soviet Union, and restore [[capitalism]]. 

The Moscow Trials led to the execution of many of the defendants. They are generally seen as part of Stalin's [[Great Purge]], an attempt to rid the party of current or prior oppositionists, especially but not exclusively Trotskyists, and any leading Bolshevik cadre from the time of the [[Russian Revolution]] or earlier, who might even potentially become a figurehead for the growing discontent in the Soviet populace resulting from Stalin's mismanagement of the economy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Stalin's hasty [[industrialisation]] during the period of the First [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Five Year Plan]] and the brutality of the forced [[collectivisation]] of agriculture had led to an acute economic and political crisis in 1928-33, a part of the global problem known as the Great Depression, and to enormous suffering on the part of the Soviet workers and peasants. Stalin was acutely conscious of this fact and took steps to prevent it taking the form of an opposition inside the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] to his increasingly autocratic rule.&lt;ref&gt;Vadim  Z Rogovin, ''1937: Stalin's Year of Terror'' (Mehring books 1998; {{ISBN|0-929087-77-1}}): xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
&lt;!-- This was a major major mistake by me to go this far back. The "background" section, as I improperly named it, should be named Kirov's assassination and this could then steal, and alleviate, the Sergei Kirov article on Wikipedia from going where it should not go.--&gt;

[[Stalin]], [[Grigory Zinoviev]], and [[Lev Kamenev]] formed a ruling [[triumvirate]] (a so-called troika, not to be confused with the [[NKVD troika]]) in early 1923&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Chris|title=Stalin's Russia|year=1993|publisher=Edward Arnold|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=it was early 1923 but books are really sloppy here.}} after [[Vladimir Lenin]] had become incapacitated from a stroke.&lt;!--Tucker 289-290 --&gt; In the  context of the series of defeats of communist revolutions abroad (crucially the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German revolutions of 1919]] and 1923 but also later the Chinese Revolution of 1927) which left the Russian Revolution increasingly isolated in a backward country, enabled the troika to effect the marginalization of [[Leon Trotsky]] in an internal party political conflict over the issue of Stalin's theory of [[Socialism in One Country]]. It was Trotsky who most clearly represented the wing of the CPSU leadership which claimed that the survival of the revolution depended on the spread of communism to the advanced European economies especially Germany. This was expressed in his theory of [[permanent revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trotsky|first1=LD|title=The Permanent Revolution &amp; Results and Prospects|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1931/tpr/index.htm|website=Marxists Internet Archive|publisher=Progress Publishers|accessdate=6 July 2014|year=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later, Zinoviev and Kamenev joined the [[United Front]] in an alliance with Trotsky which favored [[Trotskyism]] and opposed Stalin specifically.&lt;ref&gt;Roginov: 24&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Stalin allied with [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and defeated Trotsky in a power struggle. Trotsky was expelled from the [[Soviet Union]] in 1929 and Kamenev and Zinoviev temporarily lost their membership in the Communist Party. Zinoviev and Kamenev, in 1932, were found to be complicit in the [[Ryutin Affair]] and again were temporarily expelled from the Communist Party. In December 1934, [[Sergey Kirov|Sergei Kirov]] was assassinated and, subsequently 15 defendants were found guilty of direct, or indirect, involvement in the crime and were executed.&lt;ref&gt;Lenoe: 345–371&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--this is a major problem, some were innocent--&gt; Zinoviev and Kamenev were found to be morally complicit in Kirov's murder and were sentenced to prison terms of ten and five years, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Orlov: 24–25; cf. Lenoe: 376–379.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Kamenev and Zinoviev had been secretly tried in 1935 but it appears that Stalin decided that, with suitable confessions, their fate could be used for propaganda purposes. [[Genrikh Yagoda]] oversaw the interrogation proceedings.

==Anti-Soviet Trotskyist Center==
===Conspiracy and investigation===
In December 1935, the original case surrounding Zinoviev began to widen into what was  called the ''Trotsky-Zinoviev Center''.&lt;ref&gt;Rogovin: 2–4&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin allegedly received reports that correspondences from Trotsky were found among the possessions of one of those arrested in the widened probe.&lt;ref name="Rogovin: 2"&gt;Rogovin: 2&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Stalin stressed the importance of the investigation and ordered [[Nikolai Yezhov]] to take over the case and ascertain if Trotsky was involved.&lt;ref name="Rogovin: 2"/&gt; The central office of [[NKVD]] that was headed by [[Genrikh Yagoda]] was shocked when it was known that Yezhov (at that time a mere party functionary){{efn|Yezhov headed the [[Central Control Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]}}&lt;ref name=aleksandrov&gt;Aleksandrov, K. ''[http://newtimes.ru/stati/syuzhetyi/nachalo-bolshogo-terrora.html The beginning of the Great Purge (Начало Большого террора)]''. Novoe vremya. 29 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; has discovered the conspiracy,&lt;ref name=aleksandrov/&gt; due to the fact that they (NKVD) had no relations to the case.&lt;ref name=aleksandrov/&gt; This would have led to inevitable conclusion about unprofessionalism of the NKVD leaders who completely missed the existence of the conspiratorial Trotskyist center.&lt;ref name=aleksandrov/&gt; In June 1936, Yagoda reiterated his belief to Stalin that there was no link between Trotsky and Zinoviev, but Stalin promptly rebuked him.&lt;ref name="Rogovin: 5"&gt;Rogovin: 5&lt;/ref&gt; Bewilderment was strengthened by the fact that both Zinoviev and Kamenev for a long time were under constant operational surveillance and after the [[Sergey Kirov|murder of Kirov]] were held in custody.&lt;ref name=aleksandrov/&gt; A key role in investigating played a chief of the Secret-political department of the NKVD Main Directory of State Security (a predecessor of [[KGB]]), State Security Commissar of the 2nd Class Georgiy Molchanov.&lt;ref name=aleksandrov/&gt;

The basis of the scenario was laid in confession testimonies of three arrested: NKVD agent Valentin Olberg ([[:ru:Ольберг, Валентин Павлович]]) who was teaching at the Gorky Pedagogic Institute and two former participants of the internal party opposition and Soviet statesmen Isaak Rejngold and Richard Pikel.&lt;ref name=aleksandrov/&gt; Wherein Rejngold firmly believed that participating in the case fabrication about mythical conspiracy he executes the party's task.&lt;ref name=aleksandrov/&gt; In relation to their composition, the testimonies looked standard conspiratorial activity, murder of Kirov, preparation to assassination attempts against the leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, seizure of power in the Soviet Union with the aim of "restoration of capitalism".&lt;ref name=aleksandrov/&gt;

In July 1936, Zinoviev and Kamenev were brought to Moscow from an unspecified prison.&lt;ref name="Rogovin: 5"/&gt; They were interrogated and denied being part of any Trotsky-led conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;Rogovin: 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; Yezhov appealed to Zinoviev's and Kamenev's devotion to the Soviet Union as old Bolsheviks and advised them that Trotsky was fomenting anti-Soviet sentiment amongst the proletariat in the world.&lt;!--Rogovin 7–8--&gt; Throughout spring and summer of 1936 the investigators were requesting from the arrested "to lay down arms in front the party" exerting a continuous pressure on them.&lt;ref name=aleksandrov/&gt; Furthermore, this loss of support, in the event of a war with Germany or Japan, could have disastrous ramifications for the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Rogovin: 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; To Kamenev specifically, Yezhov showed him evidence that his son was subject to an investigation that could result in his son's execution.&lt;ref name="Rogovin: 8"&gt;Rogovin: 8&lt;/ref&gt; According to one witness, at the beginning of the summer the central heating was turned on in Zinoviev's and Kamenev's cells. This was very unpleasant for both prisoners but particularly Zinoviev who was asthmatic and couldn't tolerate the artificially increased temperatures.&lt;ref name=aleksandrov/&gt; Finally the exhausted prisoners agreed to a deal with Stalin who promised them, on the behalf of Politburo, their lives in exchange for participation in the anti-Trotskyist spectacle.&lt;ref name=aleksandrov/&gt; Kamenev and Zinoviev agreed to confess on condition that they receive a direct guarantee from the entire Politburo that their lives and those of their families and followers would be spared.&lt;!--Rogovin: 8--&gt; When they were taken to the supposed Politburo meeting, they were met by only Stalin and [[Kliment Voroshilov]].&lt;ref name="Rogovin: 8"/&gt; Stalin explained that they were the "commission" authorized by the Politburo, and Stalin agreed to their conditions in order to gain their desired confessions.&lt;ref&gt;Rogovin: 9&lt;/ref&gt; After that the future defendants were given some medical treatment and food.&lt;ref name=aleksandrov/&gt;

===The Trial (aka Trial of the Sixteen)===
{{distinguish|Trial of the Sixteen}}
The trial was held from August 19 to August 24, 1936 in the small October Hall of the [[House of the Unions]] (chosen instead of the larger Hall of Columns, used for earlier trials)&lt;ref&gt;Robert Conquest, ''The Great Terror: A Reassessment'' (Oxford University Press, 1990; {{ISBN|0195071328}}), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; and there were 16 defendants.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Delap Sean, ''Dictatorship and Democracy''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main charge was forming a [[terror]] organization with the purpose of killing Joseph Stalin and other members of the Soviet government. They were tried by the [[Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR]], with [[Vasili Ulrikh]] presiding. The [[Procurator General of the Soviet Union|Prosecutor General]] was [[Andrei Vyshinsky]], a former member of the Mensheviks who in 1917 had signed an order to arrest Lenin.&lt;ref&gt;Rogovin: 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Defendant [[Ivan Nikitich Smirnov]] was blamed by his co-defendants for being the leader of the Center which planned Kirov's assassination.&lt;!--Roginov 23--&gt; He, however, had been in prison since January 1933 and refused to confess.&lt;ref&gt;Rogovin: 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Another defendant, the Old Bolshevik Eduard Holtzman, was accused at the Trial of the 16 of conspiring with Trotsky in Copenhagen at the Hotel Bristol in 1932, where Trotsky was giving a public lecture. A week after the trial it was revealed by a Danish Social Democratic newspaper that the hotel had been demolished in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Rogovin: 17&lt;/ref&gt;

All the defendants were sentenced to death and were subsequently shot in the cellars of [[Lubyanka Building|Lubyanka]] Prison in [[Moscow]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Parallel anti-Soviet Trotskyist Center==
[[File:Radek's action.jpg|thumb|[[Procurator General of the Soviet Union|Prosecutor General]] Vyshinskiy (centre), reading the indictment, in 1937]]
The second trial occurred between January 23 and January 30, 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Rogovin: 113&lt;/ref&gt;

This second trial involved 17 lesser figures including [[Karl Radek]], [[Yuri Piatakov]] and [[Grigory Sokolnikov]]. [[Alexander Beloborodov]] was also arrested and intended to be tried along with Radek, but did not make the confession required of him, and so he was not produced in court. Thirteen of the defendants were eventually executed by shooting. The rest received sentences in labour camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} Bernard Michal. Los Grandes Procesos de la Historia.

Radek was spared as he implicated others, including [[Nikolai Bukharin]], [[Alexei Rykov]], and Marshal [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], setting the stage for the Trial of Military and Trial of the Twenty One.

Radek provided the pretext for the purge on a massive scale with his testimony that there was a "third organization separate from the cadres which had passed through [Trotsky's] school"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;British Embassy Report: Viscount Chilston to Mr. Eden, February 6, 1937&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "semi-Trotskyites, quarter-Trotskyites, one-eighth-Trotskyites, people who helped us, not knowing of the terrorist organization but sympathizing with us, people who from liberalism, from a [[Fronde]] against the Party, gave us this help."&lt;ref&gt;Conquest 1990, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the third organization, he meant the last remaining former opposition group called [[Right Opposition|Rightists]] led by Bukharin, whom he implicated by saying: "I feel guilty of one thing more: even after admitting my guilt and exposing the organisation, I stubbornly refused to give evidence about Bukharin. I knew that Bukharin's situation was just as hopeless as my own, because our guilt, if not juridically, then in essence, was the same. But we are close friends, and intellectual friendship is stronger than other friendships. I knew that Bukharin was in the same state of upheaval as myself. That is why I did not want to deliver him bound hand and foot to the People's Commissariat of Home Affairs. Just as in relation to our other cadres, I wanted Bukharin himself to lay down his arms."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

At the time, many Western observers who attended the trials said that they were fair and that the guilt of the accused had been established. They based this assessment on the confessions of the accused, which were freely given in open court, without any apparent evidence that they had been extracted by torture or drugging. [[Joseph E. Davies]], the U.S. ambassador, wrote in ''Mission to Moscow'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In view of the character of the accused, their long terms of service, their recognized distinction in their profession, their long-continued loyalty to the Communist cause, it is scarcely credible that their brother officers&amp;nbsp;... should have acquiesced in their execution, unless they were convinced that these men had been guilty of some offense.{{ref label|evidence|*}} It is generally accepted by members of the Diplomatic Corps that the accused must have been guilty of an offense which in the Soviet Union would merit the death penalty.

----
{{note label|evidence|*}} The Bukharin trial six months later developed evidence which, if true, more than justified this action. Undoubtedly those facts were all full known to the military court at this time.&lt;ref name=MissMosc&gt;Davies, Joseph E. ''Mission to Moscow''. Garden City: Garden City Press, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Trial of the Generals and the Tukhachevsky Affair==
{{main|Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization}}

The [[Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization|Tukhachevsky Affair]] was a [[secret trial]] before a [[Military justice|military tribunal]] of a group of [[Red Army]] generals, including [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], in June 1937.

It featured the same type of frame-up of the defendants and it is traditionally considered one of the key trials of the [[Great Purge]]. [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] and the senior military officers [[Iona Yakir]], [[Ieronim Uborevich]], [[Robert Eideman]], [[August Kork]], [[Vitovt Putna]], [[Boris Feldman]], and [[Vitaly Primakov]] were accused of anti-Communist conspiracy and sentenced to death; they were executed on the night of June 11/June 12, immediately after the verdict delivered by a Special Session of the [[Supreme Court of the USSR]]. This trial triggered a massive purge of the Red Army.

==Trial of the Twenty-One==
{{refimprove|section|date=August 2018}}&lt;!--list of names and several paragraphs are not cited--&gt;
{{main|Trial of the Twenty One}}
The third show trial, in March 1938, known as [[The Trial of the Twenty-One]], tied together all the loose threads from earlier trials. It included 21 defendants alleged to belong to the so-called "Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites":

# [[Nikolai Bukharin]] – Marxist theoretician, former head of [[Communist International]] and member of Politburo
# [[Alexei Rykov]] – former premier and member of Politburo
# [[Nikolai Krestinsky]] – former member of Politburo and ambassador to Germany
# [[Christian Rakovsky]] – former ambassador to Great Britain and France
# [[Genrikh Yagoda]] – former head of [[NKVD]]
# [[Arkady Rosengolts]] – former People's Commissar for Foreign Trade
# [[Vladimir Ivanovich Ivanov|Vladimir Ivanov]] – former People's Commissar for Timber Industry
# [[Mikhail Alexandrovich Chernov]] – former People's Commissar for Agriculture
# [[Grigori Grinko]] – former People's Commissar for Finance
# [[Isaac Zelensky]] – former Secretary of Central Committee
# [[Sergei Bessonov]]
# [[Akmal Ikramov]] – Uzbek leader
# [[Fayzulla Khodzhayev]] – Uzbek leader
# [[Vasily Sharangovich]] – former first secretary in Belorussia
# Prokopy Zubarev
# [[Pavel Bulanov]] – NKVD officer
# Lev Levin – Kremlin doctor
# Dmitry Pletnev – Kremlin doctor
# Ignaty Kazakov – Kremlin doctor
# Venyamin Maximov-Dikovsky
# Pyotr Kryuchkov

The fact that Yagoda was one of the accused showed the speed at which the purges were consuming its own. Meant to be the culmination of previous trials, it now alleged that Bukharin and others had conspired to [[assassinate]] Lenin and Stalin numerous times after 1918 and had murdered Soviet writer [[Maxim Gorky]] by poison in 1936. The group also stood accused of [[espionage]]. Bukharin and others were claimed to have plotted the [[Coup d'état|overthrow]] and [[Partition (politics)|territorial partition]] of the [[Soviet Union]] in collusion with agents of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] governments, among other preposterous charges.

Even sympathetic observers who had stomached the earlier trials found it hard to swallow the new charges as they became ever more absurd, and the purge had now expanded to include virtually every living Old Bolshevik leader except Stalin.&lt;!--Wolfe, p. 10?--&gt;

The preparation for this trial was delayed in its early stages due to the reluctance of some party members to denounce their comrades. It was at this time that Stalin personally intervened to speed up the process and replaced Yagoda with Yezhov. Stalin also observed some of the trial in person from a hidden chamber in the courtroom. On the first day of the trial, Krestinsky caused a sensation when he repudiated his written confession and pleaded not guilty to all the charges. However, he changed his plea the next day after "special measures", which dislocated his left shoulder among other things.&lt;ref&gt;Conquest 1990, p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anastas Mikoyan]] and [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] later claimed that Bukharin was never tortured, but it is now known that his interrogators were given order, "beating permitted,"{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} and were under great pressure to extract confessions out of the "star" defendant. Bukharin held out for three months, but threats to his young wife and infant son, combined with "methods of physical influence" wore him down. But when he read his confession, amended and corrected personally by Stalin, he withdrew his whole confession. The examination started all over again, with a double team of interrogators.&lt;ref&gt;Conquest 1990, pp. 364–365.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bukharin's confession in particular became the subject of much debate among Western observers, inspiring Koestler's novel ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' and a philosophical essay by [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] in ''Humanism and Terror'' among others. His confessions were somewhat different from others in that, while he pleaded guilty to general charges, he denied knowledge of any specific crimes. Some astute observers noted that he would allow only what was in his written confession and refused to go any further. The fact that he was allowed to write in prison (he wrote four book-length manuscripts including an autobiographical novel, ''How It All Began'', a philosophical treatise, and a collection of poems – all of which were found in Stalin's archive and published in the 1990s) suggests that some kind of deal was reached as a condition for his confession. He also wrote a series of emotional letters to Stalin, protesting his innocence and professing his love for Stalin, which contrasts with his critical opinion of Stalin and his policies as expressed to others and with his conduct in the trial.

There are several possible interpretations of Bukharin's motivation (besides coercion) in the trial. Koestler and others viewed it as a true believer's last service to the Party (while preserving a modicum of personal honor), whereas Bukharin's biographers Stephen Cohen and Robert Tucker saw traces of [[Aesopian language]], with which Bukharin sought to turn the table into a trial of Stalinism (while keeping his part of the bargain to save his family). Bukharin himself speaks of his "peculiar duality of mind" in his last plea, which led to "semi-paralysis of the will" and Hegelian "[[unhappy consciousness]]".

The result was a curious mix of fulsome confessions and subtle criticisms of the trial. After disproving several charges against him (one observer noted that he proceeded to demolish, or rather showed he could very easily demolish, the whole case &lt;ref&gt;Report by Viscount Chilston (British ambassador) to Viscount Halifax, No. 141, Moscow, March 21, 1938&lt;/ref&gt;), Bukharin said that "the confession of accused is not essential. The confession of the accused is a medieval principle of jurisprudence", his point being that the trial was solely based on coerced confessions. He finished his last plea with "the monstrousness of my crime is immeasurable, especially in the new stage of the struggle of the U.S.S.R. May this trial be the last severe lesson, and may the great might of the U.S.S.R. become clear to all." &lt;ref&gt;Robert Tucker, "Report of Court Proceedings in the Case of the Anti-Soviet "Block of Rights and Trotskyites", pp. 667–8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Romain Rolland]] and others wrote to Stalin seeking clemency for Bukharin, but all the leading defendants were executed except Rakovsky and two others (they were killed in prison in 1941). Despite the promise to spare his family, Bukharin's wife, [[Anna Larina]], was sent to a labor camp, but she survived.

==Aftermath==
Communist Party leaders in most Western countries denounced criticism of the trials as capitalist attempts to subvert Communism.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Caute]],''The Fellow Travellers: a postscript to the Enlightenment.'' 
London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, (1973).
{{ISBN|0297995669}} (pp. 86, 115-26)&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of American communists and progressive "[[fellow traveller]]s" outside of the Soviet Union signed a ''Statement of American Progressives on the Moscow Trials''. These included [[Langston Hughes]]&lt;ref name="FFFaOWp9"&gt;Langston Hughes, ''Fight for Freedom and Other Writings'', 2001, [[University of Missouri Press]], {{ISBN|0-8262-1371-5}}, p. 9 (introduction)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]],&lt;ref name="AFIAAp90"&gt;Cecile M. Whiting, ''Antifascism in American Art'', 1989, [[Yale University Press]], {{ISBN|0-300-04259-0}}, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; who would later express regrets.

Some contemporary observers who thought the trials were inherently fair cite the statements of [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]], who while conceding that some of the confessions contain unlikely statements, said there may have been several reasons or motives for this – one being that the handful who made doubtful confessions were trying to undermine the Soviet Union and its government by making dubious statements in their confessions to cast doubts on their trial. Molotov postulated that a defendant might invent a story that he collaborated with foreign agents and party members to undermine the government so that those members would falsely come under suspicion, while the false foreign collaboration charge would be believed as well. Thus, the Soviet government was in his view the victim of false confessions. Nonetheless, he said the evidence of mostly out-of-power Communist officials conspiring to make a power grab during a moment of weakness in the upcoming war truly existed.{{citation needed|date=February 2008}} This defense collapsed after the release of [[Khrushchev's Secret Speech]] to the Twentieth Congress.

In Britain, the lawyer and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Denis Nowell Pritt]], for example, wrote: "Once again the more faint-hearted socialists are beset with doubts and anxieties," but "once again we can feel confident that when the smoke has rolled away from the battlefield of controversy it will be realized that the charge was true, the confessions correct and the prosecution fairly conducted",{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} while socialist thinker [[Beatrice Webb]] "was pleased that Stalin had 'cut out the dead wood'".&lt;ref&gt;Snyder 2010, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Communist Party leader [[Harry Pollitt]], in the ''Daily Worker'' of March 12, 1936, told the world that "the trials in Moscow represent a new triumph in the history of progress". The article was ironically illustrated by a photograph of Stalin with Yezhov, himself shortly to vanish and his photographs airbrushed from history by [[NKVD]] archivists.&lt;ref&gt;Redman 1958, pp. 44–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[left-wing]] advocates such as [[Corliss Lamont]] and [[Lillian Hellman]] also denounced criticism of the Moscow trials, signing ''An Open Letter To American Liberals'' in support of the trials for the March 1937 issue of ''Soviet Russia Today''.&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, Corliss et al., "An Open Letter to American Liberals", ''Soviet Russia Today'' (March 1937)&lt;/ref&gt; In the political atmosphere of the 1930s, the accusation that there was a conspiracy to destroy the Soviet Union was not incredible, and few outside observers were aware of the events inside the Communist Party that had led to the purge and the trials.

However, the Moscow trials were generally viewed negatively by most Western observers including many liberals. The ''[[New York Times]]'' noted the absurdity in an editorial on March 1, 1938: "It is as if twenty years after Yorktown somebody in power at Washington found it necessary for the safety of the State to send to the scaffold Thomas Jefferson, Madison, John Adams, Hamilton, [[John Jay|Jay]] and most of their associates. The charge against them would be that they conspired to hand over the United States to [[George III]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40F17FA3D5C1B7A93C3A91788D85F4C8385F9&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=%22The%20charge%20against%20them%20would%20be%20that%22&amp;st=cse MOSCOW'S NEW PURGE] - New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--highly specious that this belongs in this article--&gt;
For [[Bertram Wolfe]], the outcome of the Bukharin trial marked his break with Stalinism.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe 1990, pp. 10–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1937, the Commission of Inquiry into the Charges Made against [[Leon Trotsky]] in the Moscow Trials, commonly known as the [[Dewey Commission]], was set up in the United States by supporters of Trotsky, to establish the truth about the trials. The commission was headed by the noted American philosopher and educator [[John Dewey]], who led a delegation to Mexico, where Trotsky lived, to interview him and hold hearings from April 10 to April 17, 1937. The hearings were conducted to investigate the allegations against Trotsky who publicly stated in advance of them that if the commission found him guilty as charged he would hand himself over to the Soviet authorities. They brought to light evidence which established that some of the specific charges made at the trials could not be true.

The Dewey Commission published its findings in the form of a 422-page book titled ''Not Guilty''. Its conclusions asserted the innocence of all those condemned in the Moscow Trials. In its summary the commission wrote: "Independent of extrinsic evidence, the Commission finds:
* That the conduct of the Moscow Trials was such as to convince any unprejudiced person that no attempt was made to ascertain the truth.
* That while confessions are necessarily entitled to the most serious consideration, the confessions themselves contain such inherent improbabilities as to convince the Commission that they do not represent the truth, irrespective of any means used to obtain them."
* That Trotsky never instructed any of the accused or witnesses in the Moscow trials to enter into agreements with foreign powers against the Soviet Union [and] that Trotsky never recommended, plotted, or attempted the restoration of capitalism in the USSR.

The commission concluded: "We therefore find the Moscow Trials to be frame-ups."

For example, in Moscow, Pyatakov had testified that he had flown to [[Oslo]] in December 1935 to "receive terrorist instructions" from Trotsky. The Dewey Commission established that no such flight had taken place.

In Britain, the trials were also subject to criticism. A group called the
British Provisional Committee for the Defence of Leon Trotsky was set up. In 1936, the
Committee published an open letter in the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' calling for an international
inquiry into the Trials. The letter was signed  by several notable
figures, including [[H. N. Brailsford]], [[Harry Wicks]], [[Conrad Noel]], [[Frank Horrabin]] and
[[Eleanor Rathbone]].&lt;ref name="rja"&gt;[[Robert J. Alexander]], ''International Trotskyism, 1929-1985: A Documented Analysis of the Movement''.Durham,

''In the shadow of the dictators: the British Left in the 1930s''. London, Tauris Academic Studies, 2006, {{ISBN|1850438439}}, (p. 215).&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee also
supported the Dewey Commission.&lt;ref name="rja" /&gt; [[Emrys Hughes]], the British MP, also
attacked the Moscow Trials as unjust in his newspaper ''Forward''.&lt;ref name="rja" /&gt;

==Legacy==
All of the surviving members of the [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]-era party leadership except Stalin and Trotsky, were tried. By the end of the final trial Stalin had arrested and executed almost every important living Bolshevik from the Revolution. Of 1,966 delegates to the party congress in 1934, 1,108 were arrested. Of 139 members of the [[Central Committee of the CPSU|Central Committee]], 98 were arrested. Three out of five Soviet marshals ([[Alexander Ilyich Yegorov]], [[Vasily Blyukher]], [[Tukhachevsky]]) and several thousands of the [[Red Army]] officers were arrested or shot. The key defendant, [[Leon Trotsky]], was living in exile abroad, but he still did not survive Stalin's desire to have him dead and was assassinated by a Soviet agent in Mexico in 1940.

While Khrushchev's [[Secret Speech]] denounced Stalin's [[personality cult]] and purges as early as 1956, rehabilitation of [[Old Bolsheviks]] proceeded at a slow pace. Nikolai Bukharin and 19 other co-defendants were officially completely rehabilitated in February 1988. Yagoda, who was deeply involved in the great purge as the head of NKVD, was not included. In May 1988, rehabilitation of Zinoviev, Kamenev, Radek, and co-defendants was announced.

After the death of Stalin, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] repudiated the trials in a speech to the Twentieth Congress of the Russian Communist Party:

{{quote|The commission has become acquainted with a large quantity of materials in the NKVD archives and with other documents and has established many facts pertaining to the fabrication of cases against Communists, to glaring abuses of Socialist legality which resulted in the death of innocent people. It became apparent that many party, Government and economic activists who were branded in 1937–38 as 'enemies,' were actually never enemies, spies, wreckers, etc., but were always honest Communists ... They were only so stigmatized and often, no longer able to bear barbaric tortures, they charged themselves (at the order of the investigative judges – falsifiers) with all kinds of grave and unlikely crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Khruschev, Nikita, ''Speech to the Twentieth Communist Party Congress'' (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is now known that the confessions were given only after great psychological pressure and torture had been applied to the defendants. From the accounts of former [[Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie|GPU]] officer [[Aleksandr Mikhailovich Orlov|Alexander Orlov]] and others the methods used to extract the confessions are known: repeated beatings, torture, making prisoners stand or go without sleep for days on end, and threats to arrest and execute the prisoners' families. For example, Kamenev's teenage son was arrested and charged with terrorism. After months of such interrogation, the defendants were driven to despair and exhaustion.&lt;ref&gt;Orlov 1953, p. ?&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1989, the official newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'' reported that 25,000 persons had been posthumously rehabilitated.

The '''Palais Garnier''' ({{IPA-fr|palɛ ɡaʁnje|pron}} French {{Audio-IPA|Palais Garnier Pronunciation.ogg|}}) is a 1,979-seat [[opera house]], which was built from 1861 to 1875 for the [[Paris Opera]]. It was called the Salle des Capucines, because of its location on the [[Boulevard des Capucines]] in the [[9th arrondissement of Paris]], but soon became known as the Palais Garnier, in recognition of its opulence and its architect, [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]]. The theatre is also often referred to as the '''Opéra Garnier''' ({{IPA-fr|ɔpeʁa ɡaʁnje|pron}} French {{Audio-IPA|L'opera de Garnier.ogg|}}) and historically was known as the Opéra de Paris or simply the Opéra,&lt;ref&gt;Beauvert 1996, pp. 102–109 (capacity, theatre names); Hanser 2006, pp. 172 (dates of construction).&lt;/ref&gt; as it was the primary home of the Paris Opera and its associated [[Paris Opera Ballet]] until 1989, when the [[Opéra Bastille]] opened at the [[Place de la Bastille]].&lt;ref&gt;Ayers 2004, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris Opera now mainly uses the Palais Garnier for ballet.

The Palais Garnier has been called "probably the most famous opera house in the world, a symbol of Paris like [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]], the [[Louvre Palace|Louvre]], or the [[Sacré-Cœur, Paris|Sacré Coeur Basilica]]."&lt;ref name=Hanser&gt;Hanser 2006, pp. 172–179.&lt;/ref&gt; This is at least partly due to its use as the setting for [[Gaston Leroux]]'s 1910 novel ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'' and, especially, the novel's subsequent adaptations in films and the popular [[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|1986 musical]].&lt;ref name=Hanser/&gt; Another contributing factor is that among the buildings constructed in Paris during the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], besides being the most expensive,&lt;ref name=Simeone177&gt;Simeone 2000, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; it has been described as the only one that is "unquestionably a masterpiece of the first rank."&lt;ref name=Watkin&gt;Watkin 1996, pp. 391–392.&lt;/ref&gt;
This opinion is far from unanimous however: the 20th-century French architect [[Le Corbusier]] once described it as "a lying art" and contended that the "Garnier movement is a décor of the grave".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted and translated in Woolf 1988, pp. 220, 233. From Le Corbusier, ''Almanach d'Architecture Moderne, Collection de 'L'Esprit Nouveau'', [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]] 1938–9 (Paris, 1955), p. 120 ("art de mensonge", "événement Garnier est un décor d'enterrement").&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palais Garnier also houses the [[Bibliothèque-Musée de l'Opéra de Paris]] (Paris Opera Library-Museum), although the Library-Museum is no longer managed by the Opera and is part of the [[Bibliothèque-Musée de l'Opéra National de Paris|Bibliothèque Nationale de France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bnf.fr/fr/collections_et_services/dpts/s.bibliotheque-musee_opera.html?first_Art=non "Bibliothèque-Musée de l'Opéra"] (in French) at the BnF website. Retrieved 3 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is included in unaccompanied tours of the Palais Garnier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operadeparis.fr/cns11/live/onp/L_Opera/Palais_Garnier/PalaisGarnier.php?lang=en "Palais Garnier"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018070322/http://www.operadeparis.fr/cns11/live/onp/L_Opera/Palais_Garnier/PalaisGarnier.php?lang=en |date=18 October 2011 }} at the Paris Opera website.

==Architecture and style==
The opera was constructed in what Garnier himself is said to have told the [[Empress Eugenie]] was  "Napoleon III"&lt;ref&gt;Sarmant, Thierry, ''Histoire de Paris: Politique, Urbanisme, civilization'', (2012), pg. 191&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Napoleon III style]] was highly eclectic, and borrowed from many historical sources;  the opera house included elements from the [[Baroque]], the classicism of [[Palladio]], and [[Renaissance architecture]], artfully blended together.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, Robert, ''Caractéristique des Styles'' (1988), page 190&lt;/ref&gt;  These were combined with axial symmetry and modern techniques and materials, including the use of an iron framework, which had been pioneered in other Napoleon III buildings, including the [[Bibliotheque Nationale]] and the markets of [[Les Halles]].&lt;ref name="Texier, Simon 2012 page 95"&gt;Texier, Simon, ''Paris- Panorama de l'archirecture'' (2012) page 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, pp. 4–5; {{cite web|last1=Sveiven|first1=Megan|title=AD Classics: Paris Opera / Charles Garnier|url=http://www.archdaily.com/105785/ad-classics-paris-opera-charles-garnier/|website=ArchDaily|accessdate=19 March 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The facade and the interior followed the Napoleon III style principle of leaving no space without decoration.&lt;ref name="Texier, Simon 2012 page 95"/&gt;  Garnier used polychromy, or a variety of colors, for theatrical effect, achieved different varieties of marble and stone, [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], and gilded bronze.  The facade of the Opera used seventeen different kinds of material, arranged in very elaborate multicolored marble friezes, columns, and lavish statuary, many of which portray deities of [[Greek mythology]].&lt;ref name="Texier, Simon 2012 page 95"/&gt;

===Exterior===
====Main facade====
[[Image:Palais Garnier Statue.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Charles Gumery|Gumery]]'s ''L'Harmonie'' (1869), atop the left [[avant-corps]] of the façade, is 7.5 metres (25 ft) of gilt copper electrotype]]

The principal facade is on the south side of the building, overlooking the [[Place de l'Opéra]] and terminates the perspective along the [[Avenue de l'Opéra]]. Fourteen painters, mosaicists and seventy-three sculptors participated in the creation of its ornamentation.

The two gilded figural groups, [[Charles Gumery]]'s ''L'Harmonie'' (Harmony) and ''La Poésie'' (Poetry), crown the apexes of the principal facade's left and right [[avant-corps]]. They are both made of gilt copper electrotype.

The bases of the two avant-corps are decorated (from left to right) with four major multi-figure groups sculpted by [[François Jouffroy]] (''Poetry'', also known as ''Harmony''),&lt;ref&gt;Jouffroy's group is titled ''l'Harmonie'' in Nuitter 1878, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5708010j/f35.image.r=.langEN p. 11], and in Garnier 1875–81, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FJZZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA424 vol. 1, p. 424], [https://books.google.com/books?id=SZZZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA273 vol. 2, p. 273], but is identified as ''La Poésie'' in the "Table des planches" of the 1875 atlas folio ''Statues décoratives'' ([[:File:Durandelle Opera Statues decoratives 002.jpg|View at Wikimedia Commons]]), and according to Fontaine 2000, p. 82, is also sometimes referred to as ''Lyric Poetry''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Baptiste Claude Eugène Guillaume]] (''Instrumental Music''), [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux]] (''[[La Danse (Carpeaux)|The Dance]]'', criticised for indecency), and [[Jean-Joseph Perraud]] (''Lyrical Drama''). The facade also incorporates other work by Gumery, [[Alexandre Falguière]], and others.&lt;ref name=Fontaine2000/&gt;

Gilded [[galvanoplastic]] bronze busts of many of the great composers are located between the columns of the theatre's front façade and depict, from left to right, [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Daniel Auber|Auber]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Gaspare Spontini|Spontini]], [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]], and [[Fromental Halévy|Halévy]]. On the left and right lateral returns of the front facade are busts of the librettists [[Eugène Scribe]] and [[Philippe Quinault]], respectively.&lt;ref name=Fontaine2000&gt;Fontaine 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stage flytower====
The sculptural group ''Apollo, Poetry, and Music'', located at the apex of the south gable of the stage [[fly system|flytower]], is the work of [[Aimé Millet]], and the two smaller bronze [[Pegasus]] figures at either end of the south gable are by [[Eugène-Louis Lequesne]].

[[File:Opéra Garnier facade with sculpture labels.jpg|thumb|upright=3|centre|Facade of the Palais Garnier with labels indicating the locations of various sculptures]]

====Pavillon de l'Empereur====
Also known as the Rotonde de l'Empereur, this group of rooms is located on the left (west) side of the building and was designed to allow secure and direct access by the Emperor via a double ramp to the building. When the Empire fell, work stopped, leaving unfinished dressed stonework. It now houses the [[Bibliothèque-Musée de l'Opéra de Paris]] (Paris Opera Library-Museum) which is home to nearly 600,000 documents including 100,000 books, 1,680 periodicals, 10,000 programs, letters, 100,000 photographs, sketches of costumes and sets, posters and historical administrative records.

====Pavillon des Abonnés====
Located on the right (east) side of the building as a counterpart to the Pavillon de l'Empereur, this pavilion was designed to allow subscribers (''abonnés'') direct access from their carriages to the interior of the building.  It is covered by a 13.5-metre diameter dome. Paired obelisks mark the entrances to the rotunda on the north and the south.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Interior===
The interior consists of interweaving corridors, stairwells, alcoves and landings, allowing the movement of large numbers of people and space for socialising during intermission. Rich with velvet, gold leaf, and cherubim and nymphs, the interior is characteristic of Baroque sumptuousness.

====Grand staircase====

The building features a large ceremonial staircase of white marble with a balustrade of red and green marble, which divides into two divergent flights of stairs that lead to the Grand Foyer. Its design was inspired by [[Victor Louis]]'s grand staircase for the [[Théâtre de Bordeaux]]. The pedestals of the staircase are decorated with female torchères, created by [[Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse]].  The ceiling above the staircase was painted by [[Isidore Pils]] to depict ''The Triumph of Apollo'', ''The Enchantment of Music Deploying its Charms'', ''Minerva Fighting Brutality Watched by the Gods of Olympus'', and ''The City of Paris Receiving the Plan of the New Opéra''. When the paintings were first fixed in place two months before the opening of the building, it was obvious to Garnier that they were too dark for the space. With the help of two of his students, Pils had to rework the canvases while they were in place overhead on the ceiling and, at the age of 61, he fell ill. His students had to finish the work, which was completed the day before the opening and the scaffolding was removed.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland 2013, pp. 283—284.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grand foyer====
This hall, 18 meters high, 154 meters long and 13 meters wide, was designed to act as a drawing room for Paris society. It was restored in 2004. Its ceiling was painted by [[Paul-Jacques-Aimé Baudry]] and represents various moments in the history of music. The foyer opens onto an outside loggia and is flanked by two octagonal salons with ceilings painted by [[Jules-Élie Delaunay]] in the eastern salon and [[Félix-Joseph Barrias]] in the western salon. The octagonal salons open to the north into the Salon de la Lune at the western end of the Avant-Foyer and the Salon du Soleil at its eastern end.&lt;ref name=Fontaine2004p152&gt;Fontaine 2004, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Auditorium====
The auditorium has a traditional Italian horseshoe shape and can seat 1,979. The stage is the largest in Europe and can accommodate as many as 450 artists. The canvas house curtain was painted to represent a draped curtain, complete with tassels and braid.

The ceiling area which surrounds the chandelier was originally painted by [[Jules Eugène Lenepveu]].
In 1964 a new ceiling painted by [[Marc Chagall]] was installed on a removable frame over the original. It depicts scenes from operas by 14 composers – [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]], Mozart, [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau|Rameau]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Adolphe Adam|Adam]], [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]]. Although praised by some, others feel Chagall's work creates "a false note in Garnier's carefully orchestrated interior."&lt;ref&gt;Hanser 2006, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Palais Garnier auditorium chandelier - Nuitter 1875 p147.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Auditorium chandelier&lt;/center&gt;]]

The seven-ton bronze and crystal chandelier was designed by Garnier. Jules Corboz prepared the model, and it was cast and chased by Lacarière, Delatour &amp; Cie. The total cost came to 30,000 gold [[French franc|francs]]. The use of a central chandelier aroused controversy, and it was criticised for obstructing views of the stage by patrons in the fourth level boxes and views of the ceiling painted by Eugène Lenepveu.&lt;ref name=FontaineChandelier&gt;Fontaine 2004, p. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Garnier had anticipated these disadvantages but provided a lively defence in his 1871 book ''Le Théâtre'': "What else could fill the theatre with such joyous life? Who else could offer the variety of forms that we have in the pattern of the flames, in these groups and tiers of points of light, these wild hues of gold flecked with bright spots, and these crystalline highlights?"&lt;ref&gt;Garnier 1871, [https://books.google.com/books?id=l8wjAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA205 p. 205]; quoted and translated in Fontaine 2004, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 May 1896, one of the chandelier's [[counterweight]]s broke free and burst through the ceiling into the auditorium, killing a concierge. This incident inspired one of the more famous scenes in [[Gaston Leroux]]'s classic 1910 [[gothic novel]] ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]''.&lt;ref name=FontaineChandelier/&gt;

Originally the chandelier was raised up through the ceiling into the cupola over the auditorium for cleaning, but now it is lowered. The space in the cupola was used in the 1960s for opera rehearsals, and in the 1980s was remodelled into two floors of dance rehearsal space. The lower floor consists of the Salle Nureïev ([[Nureyev]]) and the Salle [[Balanchine]], and the upper floor, the Salle [[Marius Petipa|Petipa]].&lt;ref name=FontaineChandelier/&gt;

=====Organ=====
[[Image:MezzanineOpera2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|[[L'Opéra Restaurant]] opened in 2011]]

The grand organ was built by Aristide Cavaillé-Coll for use during lyrical works. It has been out of service for several decades.

====Restaurant====
{{Main|L'Opéra restaurant}}

Garnier had originally planned to install a restaurant in the opera house; however, for budgetary reasons, it was not completed in the original design.

On the third attempt to introduce it since 1875, a restaurant was opened on the eastern side of the building in 2011. [[L'Opéra Restaurant]] was designed by French architect [[Odile Decq]]. The chef was [[Christophe Aribert]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opera-restaurant.fr/presse/Communique_Annonce_Chef_EN_2.pdf Paris Opera Restaurant Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt; in October 2015, [[Guillame Tison-Malthé]] became the new head chef.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guillaume Tison-Malthé, aux fourneaux de L'Opéra Restaurant|url = http://cuisine.journaldesfemmes.com/gastronomie/1435074-l-opera-restaurant-chef-guillaume-tison-malthe/|website = cuisine.journaldesfemmes.com|accessdate = 21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restaurant, which has three different spaces and a large outside terrace, is accessible to the general public.

==History==
[[File:Two projected site sites for the new Paris Opera by Barnout - Gallica 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Two proposed sites for a new opera house, c. 1856, with alternative routes for a broad avenue leading from the [[Louvre Palace|Louvre]] to the new theatre (the future [[Avenue de l'Opéra]])]]

===Selection of a site===
In 1821 the Opéra de Paris had moved into the temporary building known as the [[Salle Le Peletier]] on the {{Interlanguage link multi|Rue Le Peletier|fr|lt=rue Le Peletier|vertical-align=sup}}. Since then a new permanent building had been desired. [[Charles Rohault de Fleury]], who was appointed the opera's official architect in 1846, undertook various studies in suitable sites and designs.&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1847, the [[Prefect (France)|Prefect]] of the [[Seine (department)|Seine]], [[Claude-Philibert de Rambuteau]], had selected a site on the east side of the Place du Palais-Royal as part of an extension of the [[Rue de Rivoli, Paris|Rue de Rivoli]]. However, with the [[French Revolution of 1848|Revolution of 1848]], Rambuteau was dismissed, and interest in the construction of a new opera house waned. The site was later used for the [[Grand Hôtel du Louvre]] (designed in part by Charles Rohault de Fleury).&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland 2014, pp. 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the establishment of the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] in 1852 and [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann]]'s appointment as Prefect of the Seine in June 1853, interest in a new opera house revived. There was an attempted assassination of [[Napoleon III of France|Emperor Napoleon III]] at the entrance to the Salle Le Peletier on 14 January 1858. The Salle Le Peletier's constricted street access highlighted the need for a separate, more secure entrance for the head of state. This concern and the inadequate facilities and temporary nature of the theatre gave added urgency to the building of a new state-funded opera house. By March Haussmann settled on Rohault de Fleury's proposed site off the Boulevard des Capucines, although this decision was not announced publicly until 1860. A new building would help resolve the awkward convergence of streets at this location, and the site was economical in terms of the cost of land.&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, pp. 53–56.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On 29 September 1860 an imperial decree officially designated the site for the new Opéra,&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, p. 58; Kirkland. Page 190.&lt;/ref&gt; which would eventually occupy {{convert|12000|m2|ha}}.&lt;ref&gt;Beauvert 1996, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; By November 1860 Rohault de Fleury had completed the design for what he thought would be the crowning work of his career and was also working on a commission from the city to design the facades of the other buildings lining the new square to ensure they were in harmony. However that same month [[Achille Fould]] was replaced as minister of state by Count [[Alexandre Colonna-Walewski]]. His wife Marie Anne de Ricci Poniatowska had used her position as mistress of Napoleon III to obtain her husband's appointment.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland 2013, pp. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt; Aware of competing designs and under pressure to give the commission to [[Viollet-le-Duc]], who had the support of [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]], Walewski escaped the need to make a decision by proposing to mount an [[architectural design competition]] to select the architect.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland 2013, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design competition===

On 30 December 1860 the Second Empire of Emperor [[Napoleon III]] officially announced an architectural design competition for the design of the new opera house.

Applicants were given a month to submit entries. There were two phases to the competition. [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]]'s project was one of about 170 submitted in the first phase.&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, p. 60 ("170 projects"); Kirkland 2013, p. 192 ("171 designs").&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the entrants were required to submit a motto that summarised their design. Garnier's was the quote "Bramo assai, poco spero" ("desire for much, hope for little") from the Italian poet [[Torquato Tasso]].
Garnier's project was awarded the fifth-place prize, and he became one of seven finalists selected for the second phase.&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, pp. 60–62. Only five projects were awarded prizes, but two were the result of collaborations.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Garnier, among the others were his friend Leon Ginain, Alphonse-Nicolas Crépinet and Joseph-Louis Duc (who subsequently withdrew due to other commitments).&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland 2013, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; To the surprise of many, both Viollet-le-Duc and Charles Rohault de Fleury missed out.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The second phase required the contestants to revise their original projects and was more rigorous, with a 58-page program, written by the director of the Opéra, [[Alphonse Royer]], which the contestants received on 18 April. The new submissions were sent to the jury in the middle of May, and on 29 May 1861 Garnier's project was selected for its "rare and superior qualities in the beautiful distribution of the plans, the monumental and characteristic aspect of the facades and sections".&lt;ref name=Mead76&gt;Quoted and translated in Mead 1991, pp. 76, 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

Garnier's wife Louise later wrote that the French architect [[Alphonse de Gisors]], who was on the jury, had commented to them that Garnier's project was "remarkable in its simplicity, clarity, logic, grandeur, and because of the exterior dispositions which distinguish the plan in three distinct parts—the public spaces, auditorium, and stage ... 'you have greatly improved your project since the first competition; whereas Ginain [the first-place winner in the first phase] has ruined his.'"&lt;ref name=Mead76/&gt;

Legend has it that the Emperor's wife, the [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]], who was likely irritated that her own favoured candidate, Viollet-le-Duc, had not been selected, asked the relatively unknown Garnier: "What is this? It's not a style; it's neither Louis Quatorze, nor Louis Quinze, nor Louis Seize!" "Why Ma'am, it's Napoléon Trois" replied Garnier "and you're complaining!"&lt;ref&gt;Translated and quoted by Ayers 2004, pp. 172–174. The architectural styles mentioned by the empress were those which prevailed during the reigns of Louis XIV, XV, and XVI. For more information, see the sections on Baroque, Rococo, and Neoclassicism in [[French architecture#Baroque|French architecture]].&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Ayers has written that Garnier's definition "remains undisputed, so much does the Palais Garnier seem emblematic of its time and of the Second Empire that created it. A giddy mixture of up-to-the-minute technology, rather prescriptive rationalism, exuberant eclecticism and astonishing opulence, Garnier's opera encapsulated the divergent tendencies and political and social ambitions of its era."&lt;ref name=Ayers/&gt; Ayers goes on to say that the judges of the competition in particular admired Garnier's design for "the clarity of his plan, which was a brilliant example of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|''beaux-arts'']] design methods in which both he and they were thoroughly versed."&lt;ref name=Ayers/&gt;

===Opéra Agence===
[[File:Louis-Emile Durandelle, Charles Garnier in the Drafting Room While Designing the New Paris Opera, ca. 1870.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The Opéra ''Agence'' drafting room: Garnier is second from the right, with Edmond Le Deschault on the far right, and Victor Louvet, second from the left&lt;ref&gt;Photo by {{Interlanguage link multi|Louis-Emile Durandelle|fr|3=Durandelle}}. Mead 1991, p. 138, reproduces a different print (fig. 187) of the same photograph (from the [[Bibliothèque nationale]], see [[:File:Opéra Agence drafting room - Mead 1991 p138.jpg|a copy at Commons]]) and identifies the three men. This particular print is from the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], whose annotator dates it to ca. 1870. The elevation of the opera house shown in the background is quite similar to a design dated to the spring of 1862 by Mead 1991, p. 90 (see [[:File:Palais Garnier elevation principal facade, spring 1862 - Bibliothèque de l'Opéra - Mead 1991 p90.jpg|copy]] at Commons).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

After the initial funds to begin construction were voted on 2 July 1861, Garnier established the Opéra ''Agence'', his office on the construction site, and hired a team of architects and draftsmen. He selected as his second-in-command, Louis-Victor Louvet, followed by Jean Jourdain and Edmond Le Deschault.&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laying of the foundation===
[[File:Palais Garnier foundation work 20 May 1862 - Mead 1991 p147.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Foundation work (20 May 1862)]]

The site was excavated between 27 August and 31 December.&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, pp. 146–147.&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 January 1862 the first concrete foundations were poured, starting at the front and progressing sequentially toward the back, with the laying of the substructure masonry beginning as soon as each section of concrete was cast. The opera house needed a much deeper basement in the substage area than other building types, but the level of the groundwater was unexpectedly high. Wells were sunk in February 1862 and eight steam pumps installed in March, but despite operating continuously 24 hours a day, the site would not dry up. To deal with this problem Garnier designed a double foundation to protect the superstructure from moisture. It incorporated a water course and an enormous concrete cistern (''cuve'') which would both relieve the pressure of the external groundwater on the basement walls and serve as a reservoir in case of fire. A contract for its construction was signed on 20 June. Soon a persistent legend arose that the opera house was built over a subterranean lake, inspiring Gaston Leroux to incorporate the idea into his novel ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]''. On 21 July the cornerstone was laid at the southeast angle of the building's facade. In October the pumps were removed,&lt;!--source needed--&gt; the brick vault of the ''cuve'' was finished by 8 November, and the substructure was essentially complete by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, p. 147; Hanser 2006, p. 174; Ayers 2004, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Model===
[[File:Palais Garnier model by Villeminot - Mead 1991 p150.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Villeminot model (May 1863)]]

The emperor expressed an interest in seeing a model of the building, and a plaster scale model (2&amp;nbsp;cm per meter) was constructed by Louis Villeminot between April 1862 and April 1863 at a cost of more than 8,000 francs. After previewing it, the emperor requested several changes to the design of the building, the most important of which was the suppression of a balustraded terrace with corner groups at the top of the facade and its replacement with a massive attic story fronted by a continuous frieze surmounted by imperial ''[[quadriga]]e'' over the end bays.&lt;ref name=Model&gt;Mead 1991, pp. 149–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the incorporated changes, the model was transported over specially installed rails to the [[Palais de l'Industrie]] for public display at the 1863 exhibition. [[Théophile Gautier]] wrote of the model (''Le Moniteur Universel'', 13 May 1863) that "the general arrangement becomes intelligible to all eyes and already acquires a sort of reality that better permits one to prejudge the final effect ... it attracts the crowd's curiosity; it is, in effect, the new Opéra seen through reversed opera glasses."&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; The model is now lost, but it was photographed by J. B. Donas in 1863.&lt;ref name=Model/&gt;

The emperor's quadrigae were never added, although they can be seen in the model. Instead [[Charles Gumery|Charles-Alphonse Guméry's]] gilded bronze sculptural groups ''Harmony'' and ''Poetry'' were installed in 1869.  The linear frieze seen in the model was also redesigned with alternating low- and high-relief decorative medallions bearing the gilded letters from the imperial monogram ("N" for Napoléon, "E" for Empereur). The custom-designed letters were not ready in time for the unveiling and were replaced with commercially available substitutes. After the fall of the empire in 1870, Garnier was relieved to be able to remove them from the medallions. Letters in Garnier's original design were finally installed during the restoration of the building in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Fontaine 2000, pp. 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Change in name===
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical |image1=Palais Garnier November 1866 covered facade - Delmaet and Durandelle - Mead 1991 p161.jpg |width1=220 |caption1=The facade in November 1866 |image2=Palais Garnier 15 August 1867 facade - Delmaet and Durandelle - Mead 1991 p185.jpg |width2=220 |caption2=The facade on 15 August 1867}}

The scaffolding concealing the facade was removed on 15 August 1867 in time for the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Paris Exposition of 1867]]. The official title of the Paris Opera was prominently displayed on the [[entablature]] of the giant [[Corinthian order]] of coupled columns fronting the main-floor [[loggia]]:  "ACADEMIE IMPERIALE DE MUSIQUE".&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; When the emperor was deposed on 4 September 1870 as a result of the disastrous [[Franco-Prussian War]], the government was replaced by the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]], and almost immediately, on 17 September 1870, the Opera was renamed Théâtre National de l'Opéra, a name it kept until 1939.&lt;ref name=Levin&gt;Levin, Alicia. "A documentary overview of musical theaters in Paris, 1830–1900" in Fauser (2009), p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, when it came time to change the name on the new opera house, only the first six letters of the word IMPERIALE were replaced, giving the now famous "ACADEMIE NATIONALE DE MUSIQUE", an official title which had actually only been used during the approximately two-year period of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] which had preceded the Second Empire.&lt;ref name=Levin/&gt;

===1870–1871===
All work on the building came to a halt during the Franco-Prussian War due to the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|siege of Paris]] (September 1870 – January 1871). Construction had so advanced that parts of the building could be used as a food warehouse and a hospital. After France's defeat Garnier became seriously ill from the deprivations of the siege and left Paris from March to June to recover on the [[Liguria]]n coast of Italy, while his assistant Louis Louvet remained behind during the turmoil of the [[Paris Commune]] which followed. Louvet wrote several letters to Garnier, which document events relating to the building. Because of the theatre's proximity to the fighting at the [[Place Vendôme]], troops of the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] bivouacked there and were in charge of its defence and distributing food to soldiers and civilians. The Commune authorities planned to replace Garnier with another architect, but this unnamed man had not yet appeared when Republican troops ousted the National Guard and gained control over the building on 23 May. By the end of the month the Commune had been severely defeated. The Third Republic had become sufficiently well established by the fall, that on 30 September construction work recommenced, and by late October a small amount of funds were voted by the new legislature for further construction.&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, pp. 142–143, 168–170.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1872–1873===
The political leaders of the new government maintained an intense dislike of all things associated with the Second Empire, and many of them regarded the essentially apolitical Garnier as a holdover from that regime. This was especially true during the presidency of [[Adolphe Thiers]] who remained in office until May 1873, but also persisted under his successor [[Marshal MacMahon]]. Economies were demanded, and Garnier was forced to suppress the completion of sections of the building, in particular the Pavillon de l'Empereur (which later became the home of the Opera Library Museum). However, on 28–29 October an overwhelming incentive to complete the new theatre came when the Salle Le Peletier was destroyed by a fire which raged the entire night.&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, pp. 143–145. 170–172.&lt;/ref&gt; Garnier was immediately instructed to complete the building as soon as possible.

===Completion===
[[File:Inauguration of the Paris Opera in 1875 by Detaille - Collections of the Château of Versailles (cropped).jpg|325px|thumb|''Inauguration of the Paris Opera in 1875'' ([[Édouard Detaille]], 1878)]]

The cost of completion of the new house during 1874 was more than 7.5&amp;nbsp;million francs, a sum that greatly exceeded the amounts spent in any of the previous thirteen years. The cash-strapped government of the Third Republic resorted to borrowing 4.9&amp;nbsp;million gold francs at an interest rate of six percent from [[François Blanc]], the wealthy financier who managed the [[Monte Carlo Casino]]. Subsequently (from 1876 to 1879) Garnier would oversee the design and construction of the Monte Carlo Casino concert hall, the Salle Garnier, which later became the home of the [[Opéra de Monte Carlo]].&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, pp. 145–146; Folli &amp; Merello 2004, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1874 Garnier and his construction team worked feverishly to complete the new Paris opera house, and by 17 October the orchestra was able to conduct an acoustical test of the new auditorium, followed by another on 2 December which was attended by officials, guests, and members of the press. The Paris Opera Ballet danced on the stage on 12 December, and six days later the famous chandelier was lit for the first time.&lt;ref name=Simeone&gt;Simeone 2000, pp. 177–180.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre was formally inaugurated on 5 January 1875 with a lavish gala performance attended by Marshal MacMahon, the Lord Mayor of London and King [[Alfonso XII]] of Spain. The program included the overtures to Auber's ''[[La muette de Portici]]'' and Rossini's ''[[William Tell (opera)|William Tell]]'', the first two acts of [[Ludovic Halévy|Halévy]]'s 1835 opera ''[[La Juive]]'' (with [[Gabrielle Krauss]] in the title role), along with "The Consecration of the Swords" from [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]]'s 1836 opera ''[[Les Huguenots]]'' and the 1866 ballet ''[[La source (Saint-Léon)|La source]]'' with music by [[Léo Delibes|Delibes]] and [[Ludwig Minkus|Minkus]].&lt;ref&gt;Huebner 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iqoVHY6OrjIC&amp;pg=PA303 p. 303].&lt;/ref&gt; As a soprano had fallen ill one act from [[Charles Gounod]]'s [[Faust (opera)|''Faust'']] and one from [[Ambroise Thomas]]'s [[Hamlet (opera)|''Hamlet'']] had to be omitted. During the intermission Garnier stepped out onto the landing of the grand staircase to receive the approving applause of the audience.

===History of the house since opening===
In 1881 electric lighting was installed. In the 1950s new personnel and freight elevators were installed at the rear of stage, to facilitate the movement of employees in the administration building and the moving of stage scenery.

In 1969, the theatre was given new electrical facilities and, during 1978, part of the original Foyer de la Danse was converted into new rehearsal space for the Ballet company by the architect [[Jean-Loup Roubert]].
During 1994, restoration work began on the theatre. This consisted of modernising the stage machinery and electrical facilities, while restoring and preserving the opulent décor, as well as strengthening the structure and foundation of the building. This restoration was completed in 2007.

==Stamps==
The French Post Office has issued two postage stamps on the building:
The first was issued in September 1998, for the centenary of the death of Charles Garnier. It was designed by Claude Andréotto grouping elements which recall the artistic activities of the Opera Garnier: the profile of a dancer, a violin and a red curtain.
The second, drawn and engraved by Martin Mörck, is issued in June 2006 and represents, in intaglio, the main facade.

==Influence abroad==
The building inspired many other buildings over the following thirty years.

Several buildings in [[Poland]] were based on the design of the Palais Garnier. these include the [[Juliusz Słowacki Theatre]] in [[Kraków]], built during 1893 and also the Warsaw Philharmony edifice in [[Warsaw]], built between 1900 and 1901.

In Ukraine, the influence of the Palais Garnier can be seen at the [[National Opera House of Ukraine]] in [[Kiev]], built in 1901, [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]] in [[Lviv]], built between 1897 and 1900.

The [[Thomas Jefferson Building]] of the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington, D.C. is modelled after the Palais Garnier, most notably the facade and Great Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Scott &amp; Lee 1993, pp. 142–145.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Teatro Municipal (Rio de Janeiro)|Theatro Municipal do Rio de Janeiro]] (1909) was also modelled after Palais Garnier, particularly and Great Hall and stairs.

The [[Amazon Theatre]] in Manaus (Brazil) built from 1884 to 1896. The overview is very similar, though the decoration is simpler.

The [[Hanoi Opera House]] in Vietnam is considered to be a typical French colonial architectural monument in Vietnam, and it is also a small-scale replica of the Palais Garnier. The [[Municipal Theatre, Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon Opera House]] is a smaller counterpart.

The Legends Hotel Chennai in India is also a small scale replica of Palais Garnier, especially the Facade and statues.

The '''Platte Bridge Railroad Tragedy''' was a [[bushwhacker]] attack on the [[Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad]] during the [[American Civil War]] on September 3, 1861, in which the train derailed on a bridge over the [[Platte River (Missouri River)|Platte River]] east of [[St. Joseph, Missouri]], killing between 17 and 20 and injuring 100. The bridge crosses the river in [[Buchanan County, Missouri|Buchanan County]], between [[Marion Township, Buchanan County, Missouri|Marion Township]] on the east, and [[Washington Township, Buchanan County, Missouri|Washington Township]] on the west.

[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Partisan (military)|partisan]]s planned to burn the lower timbers of the 160-foot bridge across the river, leaving the top looking intact.  At 11:15 p.m. on a moonless night, the westbound passenger train from [[Hannibal, Missouri]], to St. Joseph started to cross the bridge.  The supports cracked and gave way.  The [[locomotive]] flipped, falling 30 feet into the shallow river and bringing with it the freight cars, [[baggage car]], mail car and two [[Passenger car (rail)|passenger car]]s with 100 men, women and children. Bodies and the injured were taken to the [[Patee House]] near the St. Joseph depot.  [[Union Army|Union]] soldiers were ordered to track down and execute bushwhackers for their part in the incident.  
[[File:barclay coppock.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Barclay Coppock]].&lt;ref&gt;photo from: {{cite book| title=A topical history of Cedar County, Iowa| volume=Vol. 1| year=1910| first=Clarence Ray| last=Aurner| publisher=S.J. Clarke Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Confederate [[Major General]] [[Sterling Price]], who had been invading northern Missouri at the time, wrote Union commanding general [[Henry Wager Halleck]] to protest, stating the sabotage was "lawful and proper" according to the rules of warfare and that the captured men should be treated as prisoners of war.  Halleck replied that the bushwhackers were "spies, marauders, robbers, incendiaries, guerrilla bands...in the garb of peaceful citizens"  The bushwhackers were to also say that it was a military target because there were soldiers on it bound for [[Fort Leavenworth, Kansas]].  One of the soldiers killed was [[Barclay Coppock]], a member of John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry.  The bushwackers were also to claim that it was an attempt to assassinate former [[Governor of Missouri|Missouri Governor]] [[Robert Marcellus Stewart]].

The most prominent of the bushwhackers sought by the Federal troops was [[Silas M. Gordon]].  Union troops were to burn [[Platte City, Missouri]] twice (in December 1861 and July 1864) in unsuccessful attempts to force the townspeople to surrender him (see the [[Burning of Platte City]]).  

The railroad at the time was the first to cross the state of Missouri and it was used to deliver mail to and from the [[Pony Express]] terminus in St. Joseph, Missouri. [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s first commission in the Civil War had been guarding the trains.  In August he was promoted to [[brigadier general]] on a new assignment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2546">{{about|the metaphorical term "powder keg"|the 1998 Serbian film|Powder Keg (film)|the Marvel Comics supervillain|Powderkeg}}
A '''powder keg''' is a barrel of [[gunpowder]]. The powder [[keg]] was the primary method for storing and transporting large quantities of black powder until the 1870s and the adoption of the modern cased [[bullet]]. However, the barrels had to be handled with care, since a [[spark (fire)|spark]] or other source of heat could cause the contents to [[deflagrate]].

In practical use, powder kegs were small [[cask|casks]] to limit damage from accidental explosions. Today they are valued as collectibles. Specimens of early American kegs for [[gunpowder]] are found in sizes like 8.75" tall by 6.5" diameter and 13" tall by 11" diameter, often with strappings of reed or sapling wood rather than metal bands to avoid sparks.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Bacyk, David Bacyk, and Tom Rowe, ''Gun Powder Cans &amp; Kegs'', Andrew Mowbray, Volume 1 1998, Volume 2 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Kegs for [[gunpowder|blasting powder]] used for mining or quarrying were often larger than kegs for shipping and storing powder for firearms.

==Metaphor==
A powder keg is also a [[metaphorical]] term for a region that political, socioeconomic, historical or other circumstances have made prone to outbursts. The [[analogy]] is drawn from a perception that certain territories may seem peaceful and dormant until another event triggers a large outburst of [[violence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/2006-11-18-voa15.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120192041/http://www.voanews.com/english/2006-11-18-voa15.cfm |date=November 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most often used to simplify and help the understanding of what is often a complex set of circumstances that lead to conflicts, such as the [[powder keg of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoolhistory.co.uk/gcselinks/wars/firstwwlinks/worksheets/explosivewwi.pdf Diagram of World War I Powder Keg.'schoolhistory.co.uk']&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term can be used to designate the entire region of [[Europe]], it is often used specifically to refer to the [[Balkan]] countries, particularly the [[ex-Yugoslavian countries]]. The most cited event attributed to the use of the term was the [[assassination of Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1914, the immediate trigger of [[World War I]].

'''Protests in Sudan''', also nicknamed as the '''Sudanese Intifada''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201207060463.html]&lt;/ref&gt; began in January 2011 as part of the [[Arab Spring]] regional protest movement. Unlike in other Arab countries, popular uprisings in [[Sudan]] had succeeded in toppling the government prior to the Arab Spring in 1964 and 1985. Demonstrations in Sudan however were less common throughout the summer of 2011, during which [[South Sudan]] seceded from Sudan, but resumed in force later that year and again in June 2012, shortly after the government passed its much criticized austerity plan.

==Background==
[[File:Omar al-Bashir, 12th AU Summit, 090131-N-0506A-342.jpg|thumb|left|[[Omar al-Bashir]] has been in power since he led a [[1989 Sudanese coup d'état|bloodless coup in 1989]].]]
President [[Omar al-Bashir]] has been the [[List of heads of state of Sudan|Sudanese president]] since he led a bloodless coup in 1989. Bashir began instituting [[Sharia]] and abolished political parties in 1990. He appointed himself president in 1993, returned Sudan to civilian rule, and won a presidential election in 1996 as the only candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/focus/2010/03/201031013131107402.html|title=Profile: Omar al-Bashir|work=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the [[International Criminal Court]] called for his arrest for alleged genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in [[Darfur]]. But Sudan rejected the indictment, saying the decision was defiance against Sudan's sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/05/content_10944769.htm|title=Minister: Sudanese gov't rejects ICC's arrest warrant_English_Xinhua|publisher=|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political system of Sudan are widely considered by both domestic and international community to take place within an authoritarian system due to the control of the [[National Congress (Sudan)|National Congress Party]] of the judiciary, executive and legislative branches of government.

Sudan has lost billions of dollars in oil receipts since [[South Sudan]] gained independence in July 2011, about three quarters of Sudan's oil fields falling within the territory of the new country. The north has been left struggling for revenue, plagued by inflation, and with a severe shortage of dollars to pay for imports. The landlocked South depended on the north's pipeline and port to export its crude, but [[Khartoum]] and [[Juba]] could not agree on how much South Sudan should pay to use the infrastructure. Sudan's already depleted oil revenues shrank by a further 20 per cent after its main [[Heglig]] oil field was damaged and shut down in fighting with invading South Sudanese troops in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/06/201262673155203765.html |title=Sudan says no retreat on cuts despite protest |date=26 June 2012 |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to address the economic meltdown, the [[Sudanese government]] has announced a new austerity plan on 18 June 2012, which includes raising taxes on consumer goods, cutting the number of civil servants on its payroll, raising the price of a gallon of petrol by 5 [[Sudanese pound]]s, pushing it up to 13.5 pounds from 8.5 pounds, and lifting the fuel subsidies. The plan did not gain much acceptance among common Sudanese as it is believed that the prices of  every commodity will get hikes in effect from transport to domestically produced food and other goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/06/20/uk-sudan-protests-idUKBRE85J0ZL20120620 |title=Sudan police, protesters clash over austerity cuts |author=Khalid Abdelaziz and Alexander Dziadosz |date=20 June 2012 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protests in [[Sudan]] have been influenced by the [[revolutionary wave]] that started in [[Tunisian Revolution|Tunisia]] and later spread to other [[Arab Spring|Middle Eastern and North African nations]].  The protests followed shortly after a successful [[Southern Sudanese independence referendum, 2011|independence referendum]] in January 2011, on whether [[South Sudan]] should secede from Sudan and become an independent nation.

Following the self-immolation of [[Mohamed Bouazizi]] in Tunisia on 17 December 2010, Al-Amin Moussa Al-Amin set himself ablaze on 23 January 2011 in [[Omdurman]].&lt;ref name="Al-Amin Moussa Al-Amin"&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff |url=http://www.hurriyatsudan.com/?p=11386 |title=Al-Amin Moussa Al-Amin (Sudan Bouazizi): Will he ignite the spark of a revolution? |language=Arabic |publisher=Hurriyatsudan.com |date=23 January 2011 |accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests==
===Start of protests===
On 30 January 2011, protests took place in Khartoum and [[Al-Ubayyid]] (''el-Obeid'').&lt;ref name="aljaz30jan_Kh_Obeid"&gt;{{cite news | title=Sudan police clash with protesters | date=30 January 2011 | publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] | url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/2011130131451294670.html |accessdate=1 February 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wBMA5K94 |archivedate=1 February 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Khartoum, police clashed with demonstrators in the town centre and at least two universities. Demonstrators had organized on online social networking sites since the Tunisian protests the month before.  Hussein Khogali, editor in chief of the ''Al-Watan'' newspaper stated that his daughter had been arrested for organizing the protest via Facebook and opposition leader [[Mubarak al-Fadil]]'s two sons were arrested while on their way to the main protest. Pro-government newspapers had warned that protests would cause chaos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/01/30/uk-sudan-protests-demonstrators-idUKTRE70T0LE20110130 |title=Sudanese police clash with students in Khartoum |author=Khaled Abdelaziz |agency=Reuters |date=30 January 2011 | accessdate=30 January 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110209104254/http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/01/30/uk-sudan-protests-demonstrators-idUKTRE70T0LE20110130| archivedate= 9 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some protesters called for President [[Omar al-Bashir]] to step down. Activists said that dozens of people had been arrested. The protests came on the same day the preliminary results for the referendum indicated some 99% of [[South Sudan]]ese voted to secede.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12320534|title=Sudan protests 'echo Egypt unrest'|publisher=BBC News|date=30 January 2011|accessdate=30 January 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110131022518/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12320534| archivedate= 31 January 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; One student died in hospital the same night from injuries received in the clashes.&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite news |title=Sudanese student dies after protests |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/01/31/uk-sudan-protests-idUKTRE70U21620110131 |agency=Reuters |date=31 January 2011 |accessdate=31 January 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110209104317/http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/01/31/uk-sudan-protests-idUKTRE70U21620110131| archivedate= 9 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students threw rocks at police officers while chanting "No to high prices, no to corruption" and "Tunisia, Egypt, Sudan together as one."

In the Al-Ubayyid  30 January demonstration, about 500 people protested "against the government and demanding change" in the market. Police broke up the demonstration using tear gas.&lt;ref name="aljaz30jan_Kh_Obeid" /&gt;

On 1 February 2011, about 200 students demonstrated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/02/03/sudan-violent-response-peaceful-protests |title=Sudan: Violent Response to Peaceful Protests |date=3 February 2011 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in front of [[Al-Neelain University]] in Khartoum.

===Student protests in December 2011===
Students protested at the [[Red Sea University]] in [[Port Sudan]] after the arrest of several Darfuri student leaders on the night of 21 December, with many Darfuri student activists calling for a revolution and declaring their open support for the [[Sudan Revolutionary Front]] [[Sudan–SPLM-N conflict (2011)|fighting]] the government in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radiodabanga.org/node/22815|agency=Radio Dabanga|date=25 December 2011|accessdate=25 December 2011|title=Darfuri students threaten to leave university}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 December 42 Darfuri students left the Red Sea University in protest over their treatment, [[Radio Dabanga]] reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201112260327.html|publisher=allAfrica.com|title=Sudan: Darfuri Students Leave University in Protest|date=26 December 2011|accessdate=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students also clashed with riot police wielding batons after security forces stormed the [[University of Khartoum]] on 22 December to break up a rally by about 700 student demonstrators protesting the displacement of the [[Manasir]] community caused by the construction of the [[Merowe Dam]]. Twenty were injured and at least four were arrested, activists told media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radiodabanga.org/node/22547|agency=Radio Dabanga|date=22 December 2011|accessdate=25 December 2011|title=Khartoum University raided}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 December, approximately 16,000 students attempted to launch a sit-in at the university to protest the police, the university administration, and the federal government, but they were dispersed by riot police who deployed [[tear gas]], dealt out beatings, and arrested at least 73. Leaders of the student movement warned that they would continue to organize and demand the overthrow of the government despite security officers' violent tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-25/sudan-police-fire-tear-gas-arrest-73-students-at-anti-government-protests.html|agency=Bloomberg|title=Sudan Police Fire Tear Gas, Arrest 73 Students at Anti-Government Protests|date=25 December 2011|accessdate=25 December 2011|first=Salma|last=El Wardany}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 December, thousands of students successfully launched a sit-in protest, the [[Associated Press]] reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4169059,00.html|agency=Ynet News|date=30 December 2011|accessdate=30 December 2011|title=Sudanese students rally at University of Khartoum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Sudan University of Science and Technology]] in Khartoum, fighting between student supporters of [[Khalil Ibrahim]] and the ruling [[National Congress (Sudan)|National Congress Party]] broke out on 28 December, days after the Sudanese government announced Ibrahim's death in a battle between his Darfuri rebel group [[Justice and Equality Movement|JEM]] and the [[Sudan People's Armed Forces]]. Twelve were injured in the brawl, which police used [[tear gas]] to disperse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Sudan Tribune |url=http://www.sudantribune.com/Death-of-Darfur-rebel-leader,41122 |title=Death of Darfur rebel leader sparks student brawl in Sudan’s capital |date=28 December 2011 |accessdate=8 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109163235/http://www.sudantribune.com/Death-of-Darfur-rebel-leader,41122 |archivedate=9 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The student protests, in particular those at the University of Khartoum, have been blamed by police on the influence of unnamed Sudanese opposition parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/Sudan-Police-says-opposition,41101 |work=Sudan Tribune |date=27 December 2011 |accessdate=30 December 2011 |title=Sudan: Police says opposition parties behind student protests |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229105820/https://www.sudantribune.com/Sudan-Police-says-opposition,41101 |archivedate=29 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of female students in the University of Khartoum protested peacefully in the surroundings of their hostels at the central campus on the evening of 16 June. The protesters voice opposition against the escalation of prices and economic hardship in Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;http://allafrica.com/stories/201207130511.html&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, students took to the streets, denouncing the austerity measures one day ahead of plans announced by the Sudanese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201206180034.html |title=Sudan: Student Protests Erupt in Khartoum and Other Sudanese Towns |date=17 June 2012 |publisher=All Africa |accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/article/freedom-house-calls-end-repression-popular-protests-sudan |title=Freedom House Calls for End to Repression of Popular Protests in Sudan |date=18 June 2012 |publisher=Freedom House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Omar Al-Bashir has formally announced a series of deep budget cuts while addressing the [[National Assembly of Sudan|National Assembly]] in Khartoum, about 250 students held anti-austerity protest in the Khartoum University.&lt;ref name=reuters18June&gt;{{cite news|last=Abdelaziz |first=Khalid |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/18/us-sudan-reform-idUSBRE85H1GE20120618 |title=Protests erupt as Sudan's Bashir unveils austerity plan |agency=Reuters |date=18 June 2012 |accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riot police used tear gas and batons against the protesters who in turn threw stones at police.&lt;ref name=reuters18June/&gt; The clashes took place in front of the main campus of the University of Khartoum and in the suburb Omdurman against more than 300 student protesters.&lt;ref name=reuters18June/&gt; On 20 June, hundreds of students held anti-austerity protest for another day,&lt;ref name=reuters20June&gt;{{cite news|last=Abdelaziz |first=Khalid |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/20/us-sudan-protests-idUSBRE85J0ZG20120620 |title=Sudan police, protesters clash over austerity cuts |agency=Reuters |date=20 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; escalating their demands and started to chant slogans like "No, no to high prices" and "[[Ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam|The people want to overthrow the regime]]".&lt;ref name=reuters20June/&gt;

Shortly after the [[Jumu'ah|Friday prayers]] on 22 June, hundreds of Sudanese assembled to protest.&lt;ref name=reuters22June&gt;{{cite news|last=Dziadosz |first=Alexander |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/22/us-sudan-protest-idUSBRE85L12120120622 |title=Sudan austerity protests spread after Friday prayers |agency=Reuters |date=22 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the previous protest held during the past few days, this protest was not mainly a student-led one due to the protest spreading into many neighborhoods that had been quiet.&lt;ref name=reuters22June/&gt; Protests took place in Omdurman, Khartoum, Burri, Al-Daim, El Obeid, [[Sennar]], and [[Bahri]] saw demonstrations after noon prayers.&lt;ref name=reuters22June/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Agence France-Presse|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/kt-article-display-1.asp?xfile=data/international/2012/June/international_June531.xml&amp;section=international |title=Sudan food protests widen |work=Khaleej Times |date=22 June 2012 |accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police escalated the use of force during their clashes with the protesters and the smell of tear gas and broken rocks covered streets.&lt;ref name=reuters22June/&gt; Men in civilian clothes also attacked the demonstrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/06/201262217161471662.html |title=Austerity protests spread through Khartoum |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=22 June 2012 |accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students in [[Kassala]] protested on 27 June outside the local university against the austerity measures and called for regime change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-sudan-protest-idUSBRE85Q10820120627 |title=Police quell student protest in East Sudan: witnesses |author=Dziadosz, Alexander and Khalid Abdelaziz |date=27 June 2012 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 June, around 2,000 protesters gathered in the capital and chanted anti-government slogans. Hundreds of police and security forces attacked the demonstration with tear gas. Other protests in the area of north Kordofan were reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/06/2012629132411516156.html |title=Anti-government protests intensify in Sudan |date=30 June 2012|publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activists said that a man named Amir Bayoumi, from Omdurman, has reportedly died from the effects of inhaling tear gas.&lt;ref name="ibtimes.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/358033/20120629/sudan-revolts-down-bashir-protesters-despite-fresh.htm#ixzz1zHsHGuaF |title=Sudan Revolts: Protesters Defy Crackdown to Demand Omar al-Bashir Steps down |author=Anissa Haddadi |date=29 June 2012 |work=International Business Times |accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The largest protest so far erupted in Sudan on 6 July in which between 3,000 and 4,000 people protested at Al Ansar mosque in Wad Nubawi, Omdurman. Security forces and police blocked the roads leading to the Al Ansar mosque and surrounded the courtyard before the end of Friday prayers.

Sudanese university students armed with sticks and stones on Wednesday staged one of their largest protest on 11 July since unrest sparked by inflation began nearly a month ago. Security forces fired tear gas while students at the University of Khartoum were shouting and throwing stones after the protest began mid-afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/47471.aspx |title=Sudan university students hold major protest: Witness |date=11 July 2012 |agency=Agence France-Presse |publisher=Ahram Online |accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, Sudanese police surrounded the Imam Abdel Rahman Mosque in Omdurman and fired teargas when some 300 worshippers started a protest after noon prayers. Officers used batons to drive worshippers back inside the mosque where they continued their protest for more than an hour. On 16 July, a group of over 300 Sudanese lawyers protested outside Khartoum’s main courtroom on Monday against the government’s use of violence and arbitrary detention during last Friday's peaceful demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudantribune.com/Sudanese-lawyers-protest-against,43285] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115134812/http://www.sudantribune.com/Sudanese-lawyers-protest-against,43285 |date=15 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 July, more than 1,000 protesters, mostly students, threw rocks at police, burned tires and blocked roads in the market area of Nyala, on Tuesday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/08/201281145276112.html|title=Deaths in Sudan's biggest price protests|publisher=|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activists said police forces fired heavy teargas and live bullets, leading to the death of 12 protesters and injury of more than 50 and added that 9 of the victims' bodies have been received at Nyala Hospital.

'''''R v Savage''''' [1992] UKHL 1 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1992/1.html |title=R v Savage [1992&amp;#; UKHL 1 (7 Nov 1991) |publisher=Bailii.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[House of Lords]] case in [[English law]] on establishing [[mens rea]] of [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm|assault]]. 

== Facts == 
The defendant, Susan Savage, threw a beer over another woman, Tracey Beal, who was a former girlfriend of Mrs Savage's husband, in a pub on the evening of 31 March 1989. Mrs Savage had in her hand a full pint of beer before she threw the content over Miss Beal; in doing so the glass slipped from Savage's hand and cut Beal's wrist. The defendant claimed that she had only intended to throw the contents of the beer. It was never her intention or her realization that there was risk of injury in her action. The jury by their verdict concluded that Mrs Savage had deliberately thrown not only the beer but the glass at Miss Beal or while throwing the beer, the glass had slipped off her grip and had struck injured Miss Beal. In any of this instance, the jury concluded there was Mrs Savage had no intention that the glass would injure Miss Beal. Mrs Savage was convicted under s20 of [[Offences against the Person Act 1861|Offences against the Person Act 1861 (OAPA 1861)]] 1861.

== Judgment ==
The [[Court of Appeal]] quashed the conviction of s20 by substituting it with a conviction under s47 OAPA 1861 [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm]]. Mrs Savage appealed this decision to the [[House of Lords]] which dismissed her appeal.

[[File:London map showing Shakespearean theatres.png|thumb|The Salisbury Court Theatre is shown to the west of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in this London street map. [[:File:London map showing Shakespearean theatres.png|Enlarge]]]]
The '''Salisbury Court Theatre''' was a [[theatre (structure)|theatre]] in 17th-century [[London]].  It was in the neighbourhood of [[Salisbury Court]], which was formerly the London residence of the [[Bishop of Salisbury|Bishops of Salisbury]].  Salisbury Court was acquired by [[Richard Sackville (escheator)|Richard Sackville]] in 1564 during the last seven years of his life when he was [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] under [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]; when [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Thomas Sackville]] was created [[Earl of Dorset]] in 1604, the building was renamed Dorset House. (His grandson, [[Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset]], was Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria's]] Lord Chamberlain in the 1630s, and was a prime mover in theatre and drama in London in that era, including the force behind the founding of this theatre.)

According to contemporary chronicler Edmund Howes, "a new faire Play-house" was erected in 1629, just to the west of the medieval walls of the [[City of London]], between [[Fleet Street]] and the [[River Thames]], in a building converted from a barn or granary in the grounds of Dorset House. An enclosed "private" venue like the [[Blackfriars Theatre]], it was a successor to the earlier [[Whitefriars Theatre]] (which had been just on the other side of Water Lane) and the short-lived [[Porter's Hall Theatre]], and catered to an upscale and elite audience&amp;mdash;in contrast to the open-air theatres like the [[Globe Theatre|Globe]], [[Fortune Playhouse|Fortune]], and [[Red Bull Theatre|Red Bull]] theatres that served a mass audience (especially in the latter two cases).

Little is known about the actual form and shape of the Salisbury Court Theatre. Yet since it was on a plot of land 42 feet (13 meters) wide, it may have resembled, to some greater or lesser degree, the plan for a small theatre drawn by [[Inigo Jones]] in the later Jacobean or Caroline era, which adheres to a very similar scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew John Gurr|Andrew Gurr]] with [[John Orrell]], ''Rebuilding Shakespeare's Globe,'' New York, Routledge, 1989; p. 139. See also pp. 129-38.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Salisbury Court was built at a cost of £1,000 by [[Richard Gunnell]], a veteran actor and the manager of the Fortune, and William Blagrave, deputy to Sir [[Henry Herbert (Master of the Revels)|Henry Herbert]], [[Master of the Revels]]. At some point in the middle of the 1630s, control of the theatre passed to the "dictatorial management"&lt;ref&gt;Kinney, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; of Richard Heton, who was in charge by October 1635. (Gunnell died in late 1634 or early 1635, while Blagrave would die in 1636.) During the 1630s, the theatre was occupied at various times by the [[King's Revels Men]] (1630&amp;ndash;31 and 1633&amp;ndash;36), by [[Prince Charles's Men]] (1631&amp;ndash;33), and by [[Queen Henrietta's Men]] (1637&amp;ndash;42); for a time it was a major locus of dramatic activity, a main rival to the theatrical establishment run by [[Christopher Beeston]] at the [[Cockpit Theatre|Cockpit]] and Red Bull theatres. [See: [[Richard Brome]].]

Salisbury Court was the last theatre to be built before the [[closing of the theatres in 1642]], during the [[Puritan]] era.  After the theatres were closed, Salisbury Court was sometimes used for other purposes &amp;mdash; and sometimes, as through much of 1647, it was used for theatrical performances in contravention of the local authorities. (The players played when they could get away with doing so&amp;mdash;which was not always: the London authorities raided the Salisbury Court on 6 October 1647, breaking up a performance of ''[[A King and No King]]'' by [[Beaumont and Fletcher]].)  On 1 January 1649, the London authorities raided all four of the London theatres simultaneously; the actors at the Salisbury Court Theatre and the Cockpit Theatre were arrested, as was a "rope-dancer" or trapeze artist performing at the [[Fortune Playhouse|Fortune Theatre]]&amp;mdash;but the actors at the [[Red Bull Theatre]] managed to escape. In March 1649, the authorities destroyed the interior of the Salisbury Court theatre, and the Fortune and the Cockpit too, making them useless for public performances.

After years of being banned in the [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]], theatre was again permitted on the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1660, with the grant of two [[Letters patent]] to two companies to perform "legitimate drama" in London. The Salisbury Court Theatre was refurbished by [[William Beeston]] and used for a time by the [[Duke's Company]], patronised by the [[Duke of York]] (later [[James II of England|James II]]), from November 1660 to June 1661, when they moved to the nearby [[Lisle's Tennis Court]] next to [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], which they found a better venue. [[George Jolly]]'s troupe also played there for a time.  [[Samuel Pepys]] records visiting it several times in his diary for early 1661 (often calling it the Whitefriars Theatre).

Pepys' famous Diary provides information on the plays acted at the Salisbury Court Theatre immediately after the theatres re-opened. He saw [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher's]] ''[[The Mad Lover]]'' on 9 February 1661; [[Thomas Middleton|Middleton]] and [[William Rowley|Rowley's]] ''[[The Changeling (play)|The Changeling]]'' on 23 February ([[Thomas Betterton]] played De Flores); [[Philip Massinger|Massinger's]] ''[[The Bondman]]'' on 1 March (Betterton again); Fletcher and Massinger's ''[[The Spanish Curate]]'' on 16 March; [[Thomas Heywood|Heywood's]] ''Love's Mistress'' on 2 March; and Fletcher's ''[[Rule a Wife and Have a Wife]]'' on 1 April.&lt;ref&gt;John Downes, ''Roscius Anglicanus,'' 1708; Ayer Publishing (reprint), 1968; pp. 68-9.&lt;/ref&gt; (All dates [[Old Style and New Style dates|new style]].)

The building burned down in the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666.  It was replaced in 1671 by the [[Dorset Garden Theatre]], which was built slightly further south to a design by [[Christopher Wren]]. The theatre is commemorated by a plaque on the Dorset Rise (east) side of the corporate building on the south side of Salisbury Square.

The '''Samsung Galaxy Note 7''' (marketed as '''Samsung Galaxy Note7''') is&lt;!--WARNING: Do NOT change to "was". This violates [[MOS:TENSE]], which specifies that all articles on products are written in present tense, even if discontinued.--&gt; a now-discontinued [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[phablet]] [[smartphone]] that was produced and marketed by [[Samsung Electronics]]. Unveiled on 2 August 2016,&lt;ref name="verge-gn7"&gt;{{cite news |title=Samsung will announce the Galaxy Note 7 on August 2nd |url= https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/7/12/12158552/samsung-galaxy-note-7-event-august-2nd |website=The Verge |publisher=Vox Media |accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was officially released on 19 August 2016 as a successor to the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 5|Galaxy Note 5]]. It was Samsung's first phone with a symmetrical connector and the last phone in the Galaxy Note Series to have a home button. Although it is the sixth main device in the [[Samsung Galaxy Note series|Galaxy Note series]], Samsung branded its series number as "7" instead of "6", so that consumers would not perceive it as being inferior to the flagship [[Samsung Galaxy S7]].

The Galaxy Note 7 is an evolution of the Galaxy Note 5 that inherited hardware components and improvements from the Galaxy S7, including the restoration of expandable storage and [[IP68]] water resistance, and new features such as a dual-sided curved display, support for [[high-dynamic-range video|high-dynamic-range (HDR) color]], improvements to the bundled stylus and new software features which utilize it, an [[iris recognition]] system, and a [[USB-C]] port. Demand for the Galaxy Note 7 on-launch was high, breaking pre-order records in South Korea and causing international releases to be delayed in some markets due to supply shortages. The Galaxy Note 7 also received positive reviews from critics, praising the quality of its construction, HDR support, as well as its streamlined user interface, although it was panned for its high price and increasing similarities in overall specifications to the main [[Galaxy S series]] phones.

On 2 September 2016, Samsung suspended sales of the Galaxy Note 7 and announced an informal [[product recall|recall]], after it was found that a manufacturing defect in the phones' batteries had caused some of them to generate excessive heat, resulting in fires. A formal U.S. recall was announced on 15 September 2016.&lt;ref name="verge-recalled" /&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-officialrecall" /&gt; Samsung exchanged the affected phones for a new revision, which utilized batteries sourced from a different supplier. However, after reports emerged of incidents where these replacement phones also caught fire, Samsung recalled the Galaxy Note 7 worldwide on 10 October 2016, and permanently ceased production of the device on 11 October. Due to the recalls, Samsung has issued software updates in some markets that are intended to "[[Brick (electronics)|eliminate their ability to work as mobile devices]]", including restricting battery capacity, and blocking their ability to connect to wireless networks. Samsung has stated that it intends to recycle reusable silicon and components from the recalled models, and release refurbished models "where applicable".

The recall had a major impact on Samsung's business in the third quarter of 2016, with the company projecting that its operating profits would be down by 33% in comparison to the previous quarter. [[Credit Suisse]] analysts estimated that Samsung would lose at least US$17 billion in revenue from the production and recall of the Galaxy Note 7. The Note 7 had the shortest life span of any Samsung phone.

In July 2017, 9 months after the Note7 recall, Samsung released a refurbished version of the Galaxy Note 7 called '''Galaxy Note Fan Edition''' (marketed as '''Samsung Galaxy Note FE'''). It has a smaller battery of 3200 mAh and is supplied with [[Android Nougat]] with [[Samsung Experience]] UI, the operating system of the [[Samsung Galaxy S8|Galaxy S8]]. The successor to the Galaxy Note 7, the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 8|Galaxy Note 8]], was announced on 23 August 2017 and released almost a month later.

==Specifications==

===Hardware===
The Galaxy Note 7's hardware is similar in overall specifications and design to the [[Samsung Galaxy S7|Galaxy S7]], with a metal and glass chassis, [[IP68]] water resistance, and a [[microSD]] card slot.&lt;ref name="verge-s7unveil"/&gt; The Note 7 is equipped with an octa-core [[Exynos|Exynos 8890]] [[system-on-chip]] in most markets, and 4&amp;nbsp;GB of RAM. In China, Japan, and the United States, the Note 7 uses the quad-core [[Qualcomm]] [[Snapdragon 820]] instead (which supports older [[CDMA]] networks that are extensively used by wireless carriers in these markets),&lt;ref name="zdnet-s7exynos"&gt;{{cite news |title=Samsung-powered Galaxy S7 suffers from sluggish GPU |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-powered-galaxy-s7-suffers-from-sluggish-gpu/ |website=ZDNet |accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pcw-whichchip"&gt;{{cite news |title=What chip will your Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge have? |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/3035732/what-chip-will-your-galaxy-s7-or-s7-edge-have.html |website=PC World |accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pa-note7cpu"&gt;{{cite web |title=Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Snapdragon 820 vs Exynos 8890: the beasts clash |url=http://www.phonearena.com/news/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-7-Snapdragon-820-vs-Exynos-8890-the-beasts-clash_id84167 |website=PhoneArena |accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the S7, which uses Exynos chips in this market, Canadian models of the Note 7 also use the Snapdragon 820.&lt;ref name="ms-canadasnapdragon"&gt;{{cite web |title=Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 runs the Snapdragon 820 in Canada rather than the Exynos 8890 chip |url= http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/08/08/samsungs-galaxy-note-7-runs-the-snapdragon-820-in-canada-rather-than-the-exynos-8890-chip/ |website=MobileSyrup |accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Note 7 uses a USB Type-C port—marking Samsung's first mobile phone with the symmetrical connector.&lt;ref name="verge-s7unveil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnet-typec"&gt;{{cite news |title=Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 anoints USB-C as the king of ports |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/samsungs-galaxy-note-7-anoints-usb-c-as-the-king-of-ports/ |website=CNET |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-note7unveil"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/08/galaxy-note-7-hands-on-samsung-goes-full-sci-fi-with-an-iris-scanner/ |title=Galaxy Note 7 hands-on: Samsung goes full sci-fi with an iris scanner |work=Ars Technica |accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Galaxy Note 7 features a 5.7 inches (140&amp;nbsp;mm) [[1440p]] [[Super AMOLED]] display. Similarly to the "Edge" models of the S6 and S7, the display curves over the side bezels of the device; the curvature allows the Note 7 to be 2.2 millimetres (0.087&amp;nbsp;in) narrower than the Galaxy Note 5.&lt;ref name="verge-s7unveil"&gt;{{cite news |title=Samsung Galaxy Note 7 arrives August 19th with curved display, iris scanner |url= https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/8/2/12344688/samsung-galaxy-note-7-announced-price-release-date-specs |website=The Verge |publisher=Vox Media |accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The display supports [[high-dynamic-range video]],&lt;ref name="techradar-review" /&gt; and is coated in [[Gorilla Glass 5]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theverge.com/tech/2016/8/22/12588008/galaxy-note-7-screen-replacement-gorilla-glass-5 |title=Seriously, don't drop your Galaxy Note 7 |first=Chaim |last=Gartenberg |work=The Verge |publisher=Vox Media |accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with all Galaxy Note models, the device is supplied with an [[active pen|active stylus]] branded as "S Pen". The Note 7 stylus supports 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity and is water resistant.&lt;ref name="verge-s7unveil"/&gt; The Note 7 features the same 12-megapixel rear-facing camera as the S7,&lt;ref name="verge-s7unveil"/&gt; with a "Dual Pixel" [[image sensor]] and f/1.7 aperture lens.&lt;ref name="IMX378-XDA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-s7unveil"&gt;{{cite news |title=Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge: Curvier, faster, micro SD expansion—available March 11 |url= https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/02/samsung-galaxy-s7-and-s7-edge-curvier-faster-micro-sd-expansion-available-march-11/ |website=Ars Technica |accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Galaxy Note 7 also offers an [[iris recognition]] system, using a front-facing camera and infrared illumination. The iris scanner can be used for [[Lock screen|unlocking]], and as authentication for other features of the device (such as [[Samsung Pay]] and Secure Folder). A fingerprint reader is also embedded in the home button.&lt;ref name="verge-s7unveil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gsma-iris"&gt;{{cite web|title=Samsung outs detailed info on its Galaxy Note7 iris scanner|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_outs_detailed_info_on_its_galaxy_note7_iris_scanner-blog-19777.php|website=GSMArena|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-doubledown"&gt;{{cite web|title=Samsung doubles down on security with iris scanner in Galaxy Note 7|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/2/12348580/samsung-doubles-down-on-security-with-iris-scanner-in-galaxy-note-7|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software ===
The Galaxy Note 7 is supplied with [[Android Marshmallow|Android 6.0 "Marshmallow"]] and an updated version of Samsung's proprietary [[TouchWiz]] user interface and software suite codenamed "Project Grace". It features an "always-on display" mode, which can display a clock and notifications on-screen when the device is not in use; different clock styles and support for notifications from third-party apps were added for the "Grace" version. The Screen off memo feature also leverages this mode, allowing users to write notes on the always-on display. The OS also features several new tools supporting the S Pen stylus, including translation, a [[screen magnifier]], and a [[GIF]] recording tool. The previous suite of note-taking apps were also consolidated into a single Samsung Notes app.&lt;ref name="verge-s7unveil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="engadget-review"&gt;{{cite web|title=Samsung Galaxy Note 7 review: Sleeker, simpler, better than ever|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/08/16/samsung-galaxy-note-7-review/|website=Engadget|publisher=AOL|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pa-grace"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Note 7 TouchWiz interface features preview|url=http://www.phonearena.com/news/New-Note-7-TouchWiz-interface-features-preview_id83871|website=PhoneArena|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Galaxy Note 7 introduces a security feature known as "Secure Folder"; it allows users to create a private workspace, protected by an authentication method, with separate user data and apps that are [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandboxed]] from the main system. Installed apps can be cloned into Secure Folder, and users can designate whether notifications generated by apps in the Secure Folder are displayed from outside it. Secure Folder is based on the [[Samsung Knox]] 2.7 technology, which also added the ability for enterprises to control the distribution of system updates, and improvements to [[mobile device management]] and [[Microsoft Exchange Server]] integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Galaxy Note7 Security Enhanced with Updated Knox 2.7|url=https://news.samsung.com/global/galaxy-note7-security-enhanced-with-updated-knox-2-7|website=Samsung Newsroom|publisher=Samsung|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnet-securefolder"&gt;{{cite web|title=What you need to know about the Note 7's Secure Folder|url=https://www.cnet.com/how-to/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-note-7s-secure-folder/|website=CNET|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The device also introduces Samsung Pass, a platform allowing apps to provide biometric authentication using its iris scanner. Samsung reached partnerships with several major U.S. banks to explore the integration of Samsung Pass into their mobile apps.&lt;ref name="cnet-samsungpass"&gt;{{cite web|title=Samsung Pass to let you access your financial apps via your irises|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-pass-to-let-you-access-your-financial-apps-via-your-irises/|website=CNET|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Release ==
Pre-orders for the Galaxy Note 7 opened the day following its unveiling, with a U.S. release on 19 August 2016.&lt;ref name="verge-s7unveil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-s7unveil" /&gt; Samsung skipped the numbering of the Galaxy Note series directly from "[[Samsung Galaxy Note 5|5]]" to "7" to synchronize it with the flagship [[Samsung Galaxy S series|Galaxy S series]], and the [[Samsung Galaxy S7|Galaxy S7]] line. The company stated that consumers may have perceived the Galaxy Note models to be inferior in technology to Galaxy S models because the numbering in their names were one digit lower.&lt;ref name="verge-gn7" /&gt;

Pre-orders in South Korea already broke records with 200,000 plus units pre-ordered within 2 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-note-7-breaks-pre-order-records-708863/|title=(Update: huge demand in Canada too) Galaxy Note 7 breaks South Korean pre-order record|website=Android Authority|language=en-US|access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samsung Canada stated that pre-orders in Canada were "outstanding".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sammobile.com/2016/08/10/samsung-canada-says-galaxy-note-7-pre-orders-are-outstanding/|title=Samsung Canada says Galaxy Note 7 pre-orders are ‘outstanding’|last=SamMobile|website=SamMobile|access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demand also forced countries like Malaysia, Netherlands, Russia and Ukraine to delay their releases to September due to shortage in supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sammobile.com/2016/08/10/galaxy-note-7-delayed-in-malaysia-because-of-supply-shortage/|title=Galaxy Note 7 delayed in Malaysia because of supply shortage|last=SamMobile|website=SamMobile|access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sammobile.com/2016/08/11/samsung-delays-galaxy-note-7-release-in-the-netherlands/|title=Samsung delays Galaxy Note 7 release in The Netherlands|last=SamMobile|website=SamMobile|access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sammobile.com/2016/08/12/galaxy-note-7-release-delayed-in-russia-and-ukraine/|title=Galaxy Note 7 release delayed in Russia and Ukraine|last=SamMobile|website=SamMobile|access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
''[[TechRadar]]'' complimented that the Galaxy Note 7's "rich-looking, glass-and-metal-fused design" would "really wow people who are upgrading from those old, plastic-clad Note 4 and Note 3 handsets", but noted that the curved edges of the screen infrequently caused minor issues when using the stylus. The display was considered to be vibrant and well-suited for multimedia, especially due to its HDR support. Aspects of the software were also praised, including the continued trimming of Samsung's TouchWiz suite and its streamlined settings interface, and that it already included features introduced to the stock operating system as of [[Android Nougat|Android "Nougat"]] (although still being initially supplied with Android "Marshmallow"). Of the device's new stylus-oriented features, the consolidated S Notes app, GIF recorder, and always-on display functionality were commended, but the translation tool was considered to be inferior to [[Google Translate]]. The Galaxy Note 7's battery was judged as being capable of one-and-a-half days of normal use, and it was noted that the software also featured numerous estimation and power-saving features. ''Techradar'' concluded that "If you're going to get out of the stylus, the Note 7 is an obvious choice. The iris scanner doesn't make it a convincing enough buy on its own. Otherwise, save your money and stick with the S7 Edge."&lt;ref name="techradar-review"&gt;{{cite web|title=Samsung Galaxy Note 7 review|url=http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-note-7-1325876/review|website=Techradar|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Ars Technica]]'' was critical of the Note 7 due to its many similarities to the Galaxy S7. The Note 7's refreshed design was commended for being smoother and more ergonomic than previous Samsung devices with curved screens, although the company was panned for using glass on the rear panel rather than metal. The S Pen was also criticized for feeling "cheap", describing it as a "hollow plastic tube that would feel more at home in a 100-pack of disposable [[Bic (company)|Bic]] pens than in an ultra-premium $850 smartphone". The iris scanner's implementation was panned for adding additional steps to the process of unlocking the phone in comparison to the fingerprint reader, and that it does not integrate into Android's integrated authentication platforms (making it proprietary to Samsung components). Warnings regarding looking at the sensor for too long were also considered to be "just a little scary". TouchWiz on the Note 7 was panned for consisting mainly of "'different for the sake of being different' changes that don't add much to the software experience", and make the interface less consistent with third-party software by removing elements of [[Material design]] language. In conclusion, ''Ars Technica'' doubted whether the Galaxy Note series was even necessary anymore due to its increasing similarities to the main Galaxy S line, and felt that the device was priced too high, citing Chinese vendors capable of undercutting the prices of major brands while still producing phones of similar specifications.&lt;ref name="ars-review"&gt;{{cite web|title=Galaxy Note 7 review: What’s the opposite of "bang for your buck?"|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/08/galaxy-note-7-review-whats-the-opposite-of-bang-for-your-buck/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the original run of devices, the battery, produced by [[Samsung SDI]],&lt;ref name="cnet-defect"&gt;{{cite web|title=Samsung pins explosive Galaxy Note 7 on battery flaw|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-7-explosion-battery-manufacturing-error/|website=CNET|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; contained a design flaw that made electrodes on the top-right of the battery susceptible to bending. This weakened separation between positive and negative tabs of the battery, thus resulting in [[thermal runaway]] and [[short circuit]]s.&lt;ref name="verge-cause"/&gt;&lt;ref name="recode-cause"/&gt;

Following an official recall on 12 September 2016,&lt;ref name="verge-officialrecall"/&gt; the Galaxy Note 7 was re-versioned using batteries from China-based [[Contemporary Amperex Technology]](CATL or ATL), which also supplies batteries to the [[IPhone]]. &lt;ref name="cnet-defect"/&gt; Samsung stated on 23 January 2017 that these batteries had suffered from a manufacturing defect in the welding process, which pushed electrodes up and caused damage to the separation between the positive and negative tabs. Some batteries were also missing insulation tape entirely. Samsung reported that these oversights resulted from the vendor's push to ramp up production of batteries for the replacement phones in order to meet demand.&lt;ref name="verge-cause"/&gt;&lt;ref name="recode-cause"/&gt;

Due to the battery defects, the device is considered a [[Dangerous goods|hazmat product]], and is prohibited from being taken on-board at any airline or bus station, even if powered off.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

=== Initial reports ===
On 31 August 2016, it was reported that Samsung was delaying shipments of the Galaxy Note 7 in some regions to perform "additional tests being conducted for product quality"; this came alongside user reports of batteries exploding while charging.&lt;ref name=guard-delay-test&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/31/samsung-delays-galaxy-note-7-quality-testing Samsung delays shipments of Galaxy Note 7 for quality control testing], 31 August 2016. The Guardian. Retrieved 1 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 September 2016, South Korea's [[Yonhap News Agency]] reported that Samsung was preparing to [[product recall|recall]] the device worldwide due to these battery issues. On 2 September 2016, Samsung suspended sales of the Galaxy Note 7 and announced an informal [[product recall|recall]], after it was found that a manufacturing defect in the phones' batteries had caused some of them to generate excessive heat, resulting in fires and explosions. A formal U.S. recall was announced on 15 September 2016.&lt;ref name="verge-recalled" /&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-officialrecall" /&gt; Samsung exchanged the affected phones for a new revision, which utilized batteries sourced from a different supplier. However, after reports emerged of incidents where these replacement phones also caught fire, Samsung recalled the Galaxy Note 7 worldwide on 10 October 2016, and permanently ceased production of the device on 11 October. Due to the recalls, Samsung has issued software updates in some markets that are intended to "[[Brick (electronics)|eliminate their ability to work as mobile devices]]", including restricting battery capacity, and blocking their ability to connect to wireless networks.

A company spokesperson stated that it had received 35 reports of battery failure, which "account for less than 0.1 percent of the entire volume sold".&lt;ref name="verge-recalled"&gt;{{cite web|title=Samsung recalls Galaxy Note 7 worldwide due to exploding battery fears|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12767670/samsung-galaxy-note-7-recall-fire-risk|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guard-delay-test /&gt; Samsung stated that the hazard was limited to a small fraction of phones manufactured, and released a tool on its website on 19 September to identify affected units by their unique [[IMEI]] numbers.&lt;ref name="verge-imei"&gt;{{cite web|title=How to tell if a Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is safe|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/19/12900530/samsung-galaxy-note-7-imei-checker|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) issued an advisory on 8 September 2016, that passengers should not turn on or charge these devices on board aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FAA Statement on Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Devices |url=http://www.faa.gov/news/updates/?newsId=86424 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909021245/http://www.faa.gov/news/updates/?newsId=86424 |archivedate=9 September 2016 |website=FAA.gov |location=United States |accessdate=8 September 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Aviation Safety Agency made a similar statement on 9 September, stating that "passengers are reminded of the need to inform the cabin crew when a device is damaged, hot, produces smoke, is lost, or falls into the seat structure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Passenger information on Samsung Galaxy Note 7 |url= https://www.easa.europa.eu/newsroom-and-events/news/passenger-information-samsung-galaxy-note-7 |publisher=European Aviation Safety Agency |accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First recall ===
On 12 September 2016, the Galaxy Note 7 was officially recalled in the U.S. by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, who advised all owners to shut down and cease all usage of the device, and return them in exchange for a replacement.&lt;ref name="verge-officialrecall"&gt;{{cite news |title=Samsung formally recalls the Note 7 in the US |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/15/12933410/samsung-galaxy-note-7-recall-us-cpsc |website=The Verge |accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 September 2016, Samsung announced in newspaper advertisements that it would release a software patch to the affected Galaxy Note 7 devices in South Korea, which prevents the device from being charged beyond 60% capacity to reduce the risk of combustion.&lt;ref name="verge-60percent"&gt;{{cite news |title=Samsung software patch for Note 7 caps charge at 60 percent |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/13/12900970/samsung-note-7-patch-software-bad-battery |website=The Verge |accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-nofullcharge"&gt;{{cite news |title=Samsung Plans Software Update to Cut Galaxy Note 7 Fire Risk |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/samsung-china-recalls-early-release-galaxy-note-7s-1473853629 |website=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Galaxy Note 7 was subsequently re-issued with batteries supplied by the Chinese company [[Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL)|Amperex Technology Limited]] (which also serves as the main battery supplier for the [[iPhone]] line).&lt;ref name="cnet-defect"/&gt; These replacement models, which Samsung purportedly&lt;ref name="verge smoke inhalation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="verge girl" /&gt; classified as being safe, had a prominent marking on their packaging to distinguish them from the first wave of recalled units,&lt;ref name="verge-imeiblues"&gt;{{cite news |title=Samsung will mark replacement Note 7 devices with a blue S on the box |url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/9/9/12865966/samsung-note-7-recall-battery-mark-blue-s |website=The Verge |accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and render all software battery indicators with green icons. Samsung was granted special permission by [[Google]] to allow this change, as it would normally violate the requirements of the Android Compatibility Definition Document (which must be met to license [[Google Mobile Services]] software and Android trademarks)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google’s iron grip on Android: Controlling open source by any means necessary |url= https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/10/googles-iron-grip-on-android-controlling-open-source-by-any-means-necessary |work=Ars Technica |accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; for all status bar icons to only be rendered in white.&lt;ref name="ars-greenbattery"&gt;{{cite news |title=Samsung’s latest Note 7 battery fix violates Android compatibility docs |url= https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/09/samsungs-latest-note-7-battery-fix-violates-android-compatibility-docs/ |website=Ars Technica |accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the announcement of the recall, [[Verizon Wireless]] released a software update to Galaxy Note 7 units purchased from the carrier, which displays the aforementioned green icons on safe devices, and an embedded recall notice on affected devices when the device is plugged in. Unlike the South Korean update, it does not include a charging cut-off.&lt;ref name="zdnet-note7verizonbatupdate"&gt;{{cite news |title=Verizon releases Galaxy Note 7 software update with warning, new battery indicator |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/verizon-releases-samsung-galaxy-note-7-software-update-with-warning-new-battery-indicator/ |website=ZDNet |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samsung reported that 80% of devices had been replaced in South Korea, and roughly 50% in Europe and North America. Only 10%{{failed verification |date=October 2017}} of devices in the U.S. were returned, and about 50,000 devices were traded for a different model. However, Samsung stated that 95% of users chose to maintain their [[Brand loyalty|loyalty]] to the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Galaxy Note 7 recall: About 500,000 US buyers exchanged their phones |url=http://bgr.com/2016/09/23/galaxy-note-7-recall-us/ |website=BGR |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |title=Samsung: Have 'exploding' Galaxy Note 7s burned the brand?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37518681 |website=BBC News |accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Issues with replacement phones ===
In October 2016, several incidents occurred in which replacement Galaxy Note 7 phones still suffered from battery failure and combustion.  A Galaxy Note 7 owner in [[Kentucky]] was hospitalized with [[acute bronchitis]] due to [[smoke inhalation]], after his replacement device caught fire in the early morning of 4 October. The owner told a local television station that he had received a text message not meant for him from a Samsung customer service representative, which read "Just now got this. I can try and slow him down if we think it will matter, or we just let him do what he keeps threatening to do and see if he does it".&lt;ref name="verge smoke inhalation"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/9/13215728/samsung-galaxy-note-7-third-fire-smoke-inhalation | title=Samsung knew a third replacement Note 7 caught fire on Tuesday and said nothing | work=[[The Verge]] | date=9 October 2016 | agency=[[Vox Media]] | accessdate=9 October 2016 | author=Golson, Jordan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-blowingup"&gt;{{cite web|title=Samsung must act fast to keep an exploding phone from blowing up its brand|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/10/samsung-galaxy-note-7-exploding-phone-brand|website=The Guardian|accessdate=6 November 2016|date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 October 2016, a flight preparing to depart from [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] was evacuated prior to takeoff when a passenger's replacement Galaxy Note 7, obtained from an [[AT&amp;T]] retail outlet, began smoking and popping as they were turning it off. Samsung stated that they were working with [[Southwest Airlines]] to investigate the incident, but stated that they would be unable to confirm whether the device was a replacement model until it was recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bart|first1=Jansen|title=Smoking, popping Samsung Galaxy Note 7 prompts Southwest evacuation|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/10/05/samsung-galaxy-note-7-explodes-while-boarding-southwest-flight/91602698/|accessdate=5 October 2016|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these incidents involving replacement phones, the United States' five major wireless carriers ([[AT&amp;T Mobility]] and [[T-Mobile US]] on 9 October, along with [[Sprint Corporation]], [[Verizon Wireless]], and [[U.S. Cellular]] on 10 October) subsequently announced that they would suspend sales of the Galaxy Note 7 until further notice, pending an investigation.&lt;ref name="verge att stoping note 7 sales"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/9/13219054/att-samsung-galaxy-note-7-stop-sales | title=AT&amp;T halting Samsung Galaxy Note 7 sales following multiple fires with replacement phones | work=[[The Verge]] | date=9 October 2016 | agency=[[Vox Media]] | accessdate=9 October 2016 | author=Golson, Jordan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge t-mobile stoping note 7 sales"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/9/13220816/t-mobile-samsung-galaxy-note-7-stop-sale-recall | title=T-Mobile is second US carrier to halt Galaxy Note 7 sales, giving $25 credit to affected customers | work=[[The Verge]] | date=9 October 2016 | agency=[[Vox Media]] | accessdate=10 October 2016 | author=Golson, Jordan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge verizon stoping note 7 sales"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/10/13223972/verizon-samsung-galaxy-note-7-stop-sale-recall | title=Verizon will also stop issuing replacement Galaxy Note 7 phones | work=[[The Verge]] | date=10 October 2016 | agency=[[Vox Media]] | accessdate=10 October 2016 | author=Golson, Jordan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slashgear-allmajorcarriers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Galaxy Note 7 replacement device sales suspended by U.S. Cellular|url=http://www.slashgear.com/galaxy-note-7-replacement-device-sales-suspended-by-u-s-cellular-10459491/|website=SlashGear|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnet-allcarrierspulled"&gt;{{cite web|title=Verizon, Sprint join AT&amp;T, T-Mobile in pulling Galaxy Note 7|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/verizon-sprint-join-at-t-t-mobile-galaxy-note-7-replacement-fire-exploding-pull/|website=CNET|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 October 2016, Samsung officially announced that it had "[asked] all carrier and retail partners globally to stop sales and exchanges" of the Galaxy Note 7, and urged all owners to power them off and "take advantage of the remedies available, including a refund at their place of purchase".&lt;ref name="engadget-samsungshutdown"&gt;{{cite web|title=Samsung stops Galaxy Note 7 sales, owners should 'power down'|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/10/10/samsung-stops-galaxy-note-7-sales-owners-should-power-down/|website=Engadget|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 October 2016, Samsung announced that it would permanently cease production of the Galaxy Note 7 in the interest of customer safety.&lt;ref name="verge-note7isdead"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Galaxy Note 7 is dead|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/11/13202608/samsung-galaxy-note-7-discontinued|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-gn7done"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37618618|title=Samsung permanently stops Galaxy Note 7 production|date=11 October 2016|work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samsung began issuing special kits to package the devices for returns; they consist of an [[antistatic bag]] that the phone is to be inserted into, and three layers of boxes—the last of which is lined with [[High-temperature insulation wool|ceramic fibre]] paper for fire protection.

In December 2016, a [[Virgin America]] flight from San Francisco to Boston was nearly diverted mid flight after it was discovered that a passenger on the plane had been operating a Wi-Fi hotspot with the [[SSID]] "Samsung Galaxy Note7_1097".

==== Disabling of functionality ====
On 4 November 2016, the [[New Zealand Telecommunications Forum]] announced that all Galaxy Note 7 phones would be banned from use on local mobile networks (Vodafone NZ, Spark NZ, 2degrees and around a dozen MVNO's) beginning 18 November, enforced via IMEI blacklist.&lt;ref name="ars-nzban"&gt;{{cite web|title=Explosive Galaxy Note 7 gets blacklisted from New Zealand networks|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/11/explosive-galaxy-note-7-gets-blacklisted-from-new-zealand-networks/|website=Ars Technica|publisher=Conde Nast|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 November 2016, Samsung announced that Galaxy Note 7 devices would be banned from Australian wireless networks effective 15 December 2016.&lt;ref name="cnet-ausban"&gt;{{cite web|title=Samsung works with Australian carriers to cut Note 7 network access|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-australian-telcos-carriers-cut-note-7-network-access-telstra-optus-vodafone/|website=CNET|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gsmarena-note7ausdec15"&gt;{{cite web|title=Galaxy Note7 units still in use in Australia will be disconnected from the mobile networks on December 15|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/galaxy_note7_units_still_in_use_in_australia_will_be_disconnected_from_the_mobile_networks_on_decemb-news-21947.php|website=GSMArena|accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, Samsung announced its intent to cripple the functionality of unreturned Galaxy Note 7 phones in Canada and the United States via software updates. In Canada, an update restricted charge capacity, and blocked the phone from connecting to any wireless networks, nor use Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. In the United States, the update blocked the devices from being recharged in order to "[[Brick (electronics)|eliminate their ability to work as mobile devices]]".&lt;ref name="verge-canadaban"&gt;{{cite web|title=Samsung is basically making the Note 7 unusable in Canada|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/7/13876968/samsung-galaxy-note-7-canada-cutting-off-wireless-connections|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-cripplenote7"&gt;{{cite web|title=Samsung confirms it will render the US Note 7 useless with next update|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/12/9/13897794/samsung-galaxy-note-7-update-shut-down-inoperable|website=The Verge|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Verizon announced that it would refuse to distribute this update due to the "added risk this could pose to Galaxy Note 7 users that do not have another device to switch to" because it would "make it impossible to contact family, first responders or medical professionals in an emergency situation", especially during the holiday season. On 18 December 2016, Verizon announced that they would be distributing the update on 5 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/verizon-wireless-agrees-to-brick-samsung-galaxy-note-7/|title=Verizon Wireless agrees to brick Samsung Galaxy Note 7|newspaper=CNET|access-date=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sprint also stated that it would not distribute this update until January 2017.&lt;ref name="verge-notonverizon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Verizon refuses to release update that would kill Samsung’s Note 7|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/12/9/13899852/verizon-refuses-samsung-note-7-update|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verizon later announced that it would redirect all outgoing calls (excluding emergency calls) made on unreturned Galaxy Note 7 devices to a service hotline demanding that they be returned, and threatened to charge customers a fee equaling the total retail cost of the phone if they refused to comply.&lt;ref name="bbc-newaction"&gt;{{cite web|title=Galaxy Note 7 recall refuseniks face new action|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-38664325|website=BBC News|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 January 2017, Samsung released another update in South Korea, blocking the device from being charged beyond 15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/business/2017/01/04/59/0502000000AEN20170104004300320F.html|title=Samsung to limit Note 7 battery charge to 15 pct in S. Korea from Monday|publisher=Yonhap News|date=4 January 2017| access-date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 March 2017, Samsung released yet another update for South Korea users, barring charging of the Galaxy Note 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-7-charging-disabled/|title=Samsung disabling Galaxy Note 7's battery charging in South Korea|publisher=CNET|date=24 March 2017|access-date=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
''[[The Verge]]'' criticized Samsung's overall handling of the battery faults and recall, arguing that the company had initially delivered unclear messaging over whether the devices were still safe to use, as well as its slow communication with the U.S. [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]], which had the capacity to issue an official recall in the U.S. The arguments were based on data released on 13 September 2016 by the research firm [[Apteligent]], which stated that Galaxy Note 7 usage had been "almost exactly the same" since the announcement of the exchange program.&lt;ref name="verge-stillusing"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/15/12926308/galaxy-note-7-recall-samsung-fumbled-usage |title=Everyone is still using their Galaxy Note 7 as Samsung fumbles its global recall |first=James |last=Vincent |date=15 September 2016 |work=The Verge |publisher=Vox Media |accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Verge'' also noted that the U.S. government's ban on taking Galaxy Note 7 phones aboard airline flights was "perhaps unprecedented", acknowledging that only the ban of [[Self-balancing scooter|hoverboards]] by individual airlines for similar reasons—an entire class of products (albeit one that was "admittedly fire-prone because of cheap materials")—came close to a legal ban for a single consumer product in terms of overall magnitude.&lt;ref name="verge-ustravelban" /&gt; Kyle Weins of ''[[Wired.com]]'' felt that Samsung switched to non-removable batteries in order to imitate the industrial design of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], after having used removable batteries on many of its past models (such as the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 4|Galaxy Note 4]]). He argued that this design decision exacerbated the battery faults of the Note 7, by requiring users to replace the entire phone as opposed to just the battery. He suggested that in the future, Samsung could "lead the pack" by switching back to removable batteries, as with other "responsible" OEMs such as [[HP Inc.]] and [[LG Electronics]].&lt;ref name="wired-gluingdown"&gt;{{cite web |title=Opinion: Gluing Batteries Down Made It Worse For Samsung |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/10/samsung-exploding-note-7/ |website=Wired.com |accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysts argued that the recall had hurt Samsung's brand, and would likely cause the company to lose its market share to competitors, including [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Google]] (which had recently unveiled their [[iPhone 7]] and [[Pixel (smartphone)|Pixel]] models), and other Android vendors.&lt;ref name="verge-note7isdead"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-gn7done"/&gt; [[Credit Suisse]] analysts predicted that the recall and discontinuation would cause Samsung to lose nearly US$17 billion in revenue.&lt;ref name="newsweek-howmuch"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cuthbertson |first1=Anthony |title=How much money has the Galaxy Note 7 debacle cost Samsung? |url=http://www.newsweek.com/how-much-samsung-galaxy-note-7-cost-samsung-recall-508852 |accessdate=11 October 2016 |work=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 October 2016, Samsung revised its earnings forecast for the third quarter of 2016, estimating a 33% drop in operating profits in comparison to the second quarter of 2016, and revenue expectations cut by [[South Korean won|₩]]2 trillion to ₩47 trillion (US$41.8 billion).&lt;ref name="verge-q3cuts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Samsung slashes profit forecast by a third following Galaxy Note 7 debacle|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/12/13254634/samsung-earnings-forecast-cut-q3-2016|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 October 2016, McCuneWright LLP sued Samsung and filed a proposed class-action lawsuit over its handling of the recall, stating that the company had "failed to reimburse consumers for monthly costs associated with owning an unusable Note 7".&lt;ref name="cnet-classaction"&gt;{{cite web|title=Samsung sued over Galaxy Note 7 recall|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-lawsuit-galaxy-note-7-recall-class-action/|website=CNET|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samsung was also criticized by customers affected by the exploding phones, who alleged that the company was refusing to compensate them for property damage caused by the explosions.&lt;ref name="guardian-furiousowners"&gt;{{cite web|title=Samsung owners furious as company resists paying up for Note 7 fire damage|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/19/samsung-galaxy-note-7-fire-damage-owners-angry|website=The Guardian|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the recall, Samsung, as well as [[UL LLC]], [[Exponent (consulting firm)|Exponent]], and [[TÜV Rheinland]] performed internal testing and analysis to determine the exact causes of the defects. Samsung released its official findings on 23 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.samsung.com/global/infographic-galaxy-note7-what-we-discovered|title=[Infographic] Galaxy Note7: What We Discovered|date=23 January 2017|website=Samsung Newsroom|language=en|access-date=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, the company announced that all of its future battery-operated products would become subject to an "enhanced" eight-point inspection and testing protocol, including stricter visual inspections, as well as charge and discharge tests, Total Volatile Organic Compound tests, and accelerated usage tests. An advisory board of academics was also formed.&lt;ref name="verge-newtest"&gt;{{cite web|title=This is how Samsung plans to prevent future phones from catching fire|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/22/14353458/samsung-eight-step-battery-test-exploding-smartphones|website=The Verge|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns were also raised over the creation of [[electronic waste]] resulting from Samsung's announced plan to destroy all returned phones, rather than recycle and refurbish them into new products.&lt;ref name="verge-disposal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="techradar-disposal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Here's what Samsung is doing with all those recalled Galaxy Note 7s|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/heres-what-samsung-will-do-with-the-recalled-galaxy-note-7s|website=Techradar|publisher=Future plc|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, ''[[Korea Economic Daily]]'' reported that Samsung had been considering refurbishing the Galaxy Note 7 into a modified version with lower battery capacity, and targeted toward markets such as Vietnam. A representative of Samsung India denied these reports.&lt;ref name="ndtv-norefurb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Samsung Refutes Reports of Plans to Sell Refurbished Galaxy Note 7 Phones in India|url=http://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/samsung-refutes-reports-of-plans-to-sell-refurbished-galaxy-note-7-phones-in-india-1662060|website=Gadgets360|publisher=NDTV|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greenpeace]] disrupted a press conference by Samsung at [[Mobile World Congress]] to protest the company's unclear plans for the recalled devices. On 27 March 2017, Samsung announced that it now intends to extract reusable parts such as metal, semiconductors, and cameras from the recalled devices, and market refurbished devices "where applicable".&lt;ref name="verge-refurbishing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Samsung confirms the Note 7 is coming back as a refurbished device|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/27/15072560/samsung-note-7-refurbished-device-recyling-announced|website=The Verge|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-mwcinterrupted"&gt;{{cite web|title=Greenpeace protesters interrupted Samsung’s MWC presentation|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/26/14744524/greenpeace-protesters-interrupted-samsungs-mwc-presentation|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the discontinuation of the Note 7, some features in the device (such as Samsung Pass, Secure Folder, S Pen related features, and Grace UX) were eventually made available in Marshmallow (e.g. [[Samsung Galaxy A8 (2016)|Galaxy A8 (2016)]], [[Samsung Galaxy A series|Galaxy A (2017) series]] and Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2016)) and Nougat (e.g. [[Samsung Galaxy Note 5|Galaxy Note 5]] (via software update), [[Samsung Galaxy S8|Galaxy S8/S8+]] and Galaxy C Pro series)

[[File:Samsung Galaxy Note FE (3).png|thumb|Samsung Galaxy Note Fan Edition]]
In June 2017, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported on Samsung's plan to refurbish its inventory of recalled phones and release them with a new model designation of Galaxy Note FE, with the "FE" referencing "Fan Edition." The phone was also rumored to be named as the Note 7R, with the R referencing "refurbished".

==Mission and goals==
''The Prague Post'' was an English-language information source in the [[Czech Republic]] through its newspaper, and related products and services.

''The Prague Post'' newspaper was published by Prague Post, spol. s r.o. (spol. s r.o. = Ltd.).&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

==History==
In July 1991, Lisa Frankenberg and Kent Hawryluk, two employees of ''Prognosis'', an English-language monthly newspaper in [[Prague]] which began publication in March 1991,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.mattwelch.com/prognosis.html Matt Welch | Prognosis]". http://www.mattwelch.com. Retrieved 20 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; came to the realization that there was a ripe market in the then [[Czechoslovakia]] for a weekly broadsheet newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/2010.html Special Report - Dynamic Women in Business 2001- The Fast Track to the Top]". http://hbswk.hbs.edu. Retrieved 20 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;" Zaitchik, Alexander (2001) [http://www.thinkexpats.com/component/content/article/85-publications/190-let-the-kazoos-sound-a-decade-of-english-press-in-prague.html Let The Kazoos Sound A Decade of English Press in Prague]" http://www.thinkexpats.com Retrieved 22 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with Monroe Luther, an investor from [[Houston]], [[Texas]], they formed Lion’s Share Group, a privately held, Czech limited-liability company (spol s r.o.) that was created to be the information leader in the region. Kent Hawryluk served as Founding Publisher and Lisa Frankenberg as Founding General Manager. Other programs introduced at that time were the Business Network, Lion’s Share Group Publishing and the Prague Post Foundation (set up separately as a Czech-registered, non-profit foundation, and which later became The Prague Post Endowment Fund with the change in Czech nonprofit laws).

The mission of ''The Prague Post'' was simple and direct: to publish the best possible English-language newspaper for and about the rapidly changing Czechoslovakia and more broadly, Central Europe. The aim was to place particular emphasis on news, business, and cultural listings.

[[Alan Levy]], a foreign correspondent for the [[International Herald Tribune]] and author of ''So Many Heroes'', an eyewitness account of the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, was hired as the Founding Editor-in-Chief.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thinkexpats.com/component/content/article/309.html Alan Levy, The Pen of Prague]". http://www.thinkexpats.com. Retrieved on 20 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The original staff hired by Levy included former reporters and editors from a wide range of magazines and daily newspapers, including the ''Sacramento Bee'', ''Sacramento Union'', ''The New York Review of Books'', ''Business International'', the ''Grinnell Herald-Register'', ''Fortune'' magazine and the ''Tampa Tribune''.

Lion’s Share Group established the wholly owned subsidiary company Prague Post s.r.o. in March 1994 to take over the publishing of the newspaper, while Lion’s Share Group became a holding company.

===Chronological history===
'''1991'''

''The Prague Post'', located in a small room off Old Town Square in [[Prague]], debuted with a 12-page issue on 1 October 1991. The first paper covered news and business, offered a weekly calendar of listings and included a regular pub guide.

In late 1991, the paper moved to larger offices on Politických vězňů, off [[Wenceslas Square]], and increased to 16 pages.

'''1992'''
In February 1992, "Night &amp; Day", a redesigned and enlarged cultural listings section, was introduced. A regular features page concentrating on in-depth news, culture and lifestyle articles debuted in early May 1992.

The paper underwent extensive redesign, increased to 24 pages, switched street delivery days from Tuesdays to Wednesdays and moved printing operations to [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]], on 18 November 1992. This enabled it to offer color capability to advertisers, higher quality print resolution and more timely international distribution. Several new regular sections appeared at this time including sports, "The Big Picture", a page devoted to news from Central and Eastern European regions and "East View", a column of material from other English-language newspapers in Central and Eastern Europe.

Kent Hawryluk’s day-to-day involvement with the newspaper ended in December 1992, and Lisa Frankenberg took over the responsibilities of publisher.  An additional suite of rooms was added to the offices at Politických vězňů and the staff continued to expand, along with the company’s investment in computers and publishing equipment.

'''1993'''
A monthly supplement devoted to special news coverage about [[Slovakia]] and entertainment listings for [[Bratislava]] was introduced in January, 1993, but was later curtailed as reporting became more difficult in Slovakia. In July 1993, "Summer in the City" was published as a tabloid insert for the remaining weeks of the summer. The tabloid included up-to-the-minute travel information for tourists, filling in where the guidebooks left off.

''The Prague Post'' launched special pullout sections on 1 September 1993: "Money &amp; Markets," "Travel &amp; Leisure" and "Real Estate." These sections, aimed at providing expert, specialized coverage, appeared on the first, second and third weeks of the month, respectively. The remaining week(s) of each month were filled with a series of special topics, including "Computers &amp; Technology", "The Modern Office", "Human Resources" and "Fashion." The special sections have changed and evolved over the years in response to readers’ needs.

The newspaper moved into newly reconstructed offices in the historic YMCA building at Na Poříčí 12 on 1 December 1993.

'''1994'''
''The Prague Post'' underwent a significant redesign on January 19, 1994, transforming the second section into the tabloid-size pullout "Night &amp; Day". This newly designed pullout consisted of articles detailing culture, features, listings, and a Prague Profile. It also introduced several new additions such as the Service Page, Ask Eva (an advice column), My Gene Pool (a cartoon strip) and reviews. The front section of the paper, consisting of news, business, sports and opinion also received a design improvement at this time.

Later in 1994, "Night &amp; Day" increased in size to include the classifieds section. At this time, the business editorial department also began publishing weekly researched industry lists that are included in the annual Book of Lists.

'''1995'''
The 1995 ''Book of Lists'', under development throughout 1994, was published in early 1995. An updated version of the ''Book of Lists'' was published annually until 2000.

In 1995 the paper continued to grow in all areas as advertising revenue increased. The Prague Post began sponsoring two well-known events: the [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]] and the Valtice Arts Festival.

'''1996'''
''The Prague Post'' celebrated its 5th Anniversary on 28 September 1996, with a black-tie, gala evening at Národní Dům na Vinohradech, attended by over 1,000 guests with dignitaries, including five ambassadors, past and present employees and clients. This Gala event was a memorable evening, aptly marking a significant occasion in the life of the newspaper and its importance in the market.

''The Prague Post'' added sponsorship of the Prague International Marathon in the summer of 1996, and published a 12-page, four-color tabloid Holiday Shopping Guide for the month of December.

'''1997'''
In April 1997, ''The Prague Post'' was awarded first place for ‘Excellence in Newspaper Marketing’ by the International Newspaper Marketing Association for an in-house marketing campaign.

On 1 April 1997, ''The Prague Post'' launched its website at www.praguepost.cz (today it is "[http://www.praguepost.com www.praguepost.com]"). The initial site offered several top stories from the weekly newspaper as well as information for tourists and relocation information for people planning to move to Prague. It quickly gained a significant following, particularly with readers based outside the [[Czech Republic]].

'''1998'''
In May, 1998, Lisa Frankenberg returned from business school to resume an active role in the day-to-day operations of the newspaper as President and Publisher.

'''1999'''
The newspaper underwent another significant redesign near the end of 1999. Randy Stano, winner of two Pulitzer prizes for design, was recruited to undertake the process of re-designing the newspaper. ''The Prague Post'' was granted an Award of Excellence for re-design by the Society of News Design.

The offices of ''The Prague Post'' were relocated to a two-story office space at Štěpánská 20 in Prague 1.

'''2000'''
Since its strong debut, ''The Prague Post'' has attracted much international media coverage, with articles about the paper and its staff appearing in ''[[USA Today]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''Smithsonian'', ''Fortune'', ''The Columbia Journalism Review'', ''Advertising Age'', ''The European'' and ''Telegraph'' of London. In addition, the newspaper was profiled on [[BBC]], [[NBC]], [[CBS]] ([[60 Minutes]] and the [[CBS Evening News]]) and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (Prime Time Live and the ABC Evening News).

''The Prague Post'' was re-launched with its new design and format on 19 January 2000. Printing of the newspaper was moved from [[Frankfurt]] to a printing house in [[Prague]].

'''2001'''
''The Prague Post'' received three design awards from the Society of News Design in 2001. The website was re-designed and re-launched in the autumn 2001. Its new face attracted new and existing readers with an estimated 10,000 hits per day.

'''2002-2003'''
''The Prague Post'' introduced a successful new product – ''Dining Out Guide'' – first published in 2003. It is a guide to the finest culinary experiences in Prague.

'''2004'''
On 2 April 2004 [[Alan Levy]] died, aged 72. Two weeks later, ''The Prague Post'' said goodbye to its founding editor-in-chief in a public memorial service attended by numerous personalities of Czech political, business and cultural life.

'''2005'''
The company also worked toward improving the quality of the paper and the services provided, including the rest of its publishing portfolio – the ''Book of Lists'' and ''Dining Out Guide''.

'''2006'''
In 2006, ''The Prague Post'' proudly celebrated its 15th birthday. The night was in recognition of The Prague Post’s long-standing tradition as a reputable English-language newspaper in the [[Czech Republic]].

Former and current staff were recognized on the night for their contributions to the development and growth of the Czech Republic’s oldest and most popular English-language newspaper. [[Alan Levy]] was remembered and recognized on the night for his years of service and dedication to the paper.

'''2007'''
In 2007, two new supplements were added to the newspaper. The "Luxury Hotel Guide" was designed to provide an in-depth look into the luxury hotels around Prague, while the "Weddings" supplement offers insight into all facets of wedding planning.

In 2007, ''The Prague Post'' also helped with the revival of English-language theater in [[Prague]] with the launching of the first annual Prague Post Playwriting Contest.

'''2008'''
The Prague Post launches a digital edition for Amazon Kindle, the first paper in the Czech Republic to do so. Web vendor Amazon ranks it as the best-selling Czech newspaper in the Czech Republic on the device.&lt;ref&gt;" [https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/2237318011 Amazon.com Bestsellers - The most popular items in Czech Newspapers]" https://www.amazon.com Retrieved 22 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2010'''
The Prague Post Blogs section was launched, offering additional content not published in the newspaper on topics including politics, food, film, books, music, news and education.

'''2013'''
''The Prague Post'' stops issuing a print version and moves to online-only distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ian|last=Willoughby|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/end-of-an-era-as-prague-post-goes-online-only|title=End of an era as Prague Post goes online only|work=Radio Prague|date=30 July 2013|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outreach projects==

===The Prague Post Endowment Fund===
The Prague Post Endowment Fund began as the Prague Post Foundation, a local non-profit organization founded in 1992. The goals were to enrich education and foster a place for the non-profit sector in the [[Czech Republic]]. Originally the PPF published a weekly column, "Networking," which was the only source of news and information about the newly developing Czech Civil Society and non-profit sector. It also provided bi-weekly English-language education programs based on ''The Prague Post'' newspaper for secondary schools throughout the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]].

In 1997, Czech laws changed to recognize the increasing role of non-profit organizations. The Prague Post Foundation became The Prague Post Endowment Fund. Educational materials were sent along with ''The Prague Post'' to more than 60 schools throughout the [[Czech Republic]]. The Fund provided scholarships and supported young journalists.

===''The Prague Post'' Playwriting Contest===
''The Prague Post'' Playwriting Contest started in 2007 with the goal of bringing together artists and the theater-going community. For its inaugural year, more than 100 scripts were submitted. Organized in conjunction with [[The Prague Playhouse]], a local English-language theater company, the contest  theater entertainment for the expat community and also sought to help galvanize local writers, actors, producers and directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Coilin|last=O'Connor|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/the-prague-post-playwriting-contest-fostering-english-language-drama-in-prague|title=The Prague Post Playwriting Contest - fostering English-language drama in Prague|work=Radio Prague|date=15 January 2007|accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Week of Prayer for Christian Unity''' is an international [[Christian]] [[Christian ecumenism|ecumenical]] observance kept annually between 18 January and 25 January. It is an [[Octave (liturgical)|octave]], that is, an observance lasting eight days.

==Beginnings==
The Week of Prayer for Christian Unity began in 1908 as the '''Octave of Christian Unity''', and focused on prayer for church unity. The dates of the week were proposed by Father [[Paul Wattson]], cofounder of the [[Graymoor]] Franciscan Friars. He conceived of the week beginning on the [[Confession of Peter|Feast of the Confession of Peter]], the [[Protestant]] variant of the ancient Feast of the [[Chair of Saint Peter]], on 18 January, and concluding with the [[Conversion of Paul#Feast|Feast of the Conversion of Saint Paul]] on 25 January.&lt;ref name=Tristam &gt;''Exciting holiness: collects and readings for the festivals'' by B. Tristam {{ISBN|1-85311-479-0}} Canterbury Press 2003 pages 54–55&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;Needs Citation. Otherwise sentence must be deleted.&lt;/ref&gt;Pope [[Pius X]] officially blessed the concept, and [[Benedict XV]] "encouraged its observance throughout the entire Roman Catholic Church." For a while, the observance was renamed the "Chair of Unity Octave" by Wattson, in order to emphasize the relationship between Christian unity and the Petrine See (''i.e.'', the [[papacy]]).

Protestant leaders in the mid-1920s also proposed an annual octave of prayer for unity amongst Christians, leading up to [[Pentecost]] Sunday (the traditional commemoration of the establishment of the Church).&lt;ref name="oikoumene.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/fileadmin/files/wcc-main/2007pdfs/WPCU2008_Booklet_EN.pdf|title=Resources for 2008 Week of Prayer for Christian Unity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
Abbé [[Paul Couturier]] of Lyons, France, who has been called "the father of spiritual ecumenism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2005/august/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20050819_ecumenical-meeting_en.html|title=Apostolic Journey to Cologne: Ecumenical meeting at the Archbishopric of Cologne (August 19, 2005) – BENEDICT XVI|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; had a slightly different approach from that of Father Wattson, a convert to Roman Catholicism from [[Anglicanism]]. He advocated prayer "for the unity of the Church as Christ wills it, and in accordance with the means he wills", thereby enabling other Christians with differing views of the Petrine ministry to join in the prayer. In 1935, he proposed naming the observance "Universal Week of Prayer for Christian Unity", a proposal accepted by the Catholic Church in 1966. Father Couturier's message influenced a Sardinian nun, [[Maria Gabriella Sagheddu|Blessed Sister Maria Gabriella of Unity]], whose deep, prayerful, sacrificial devotion to the cause of unity is held up by Rome as an example to be followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2008/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20080125_week-prayer_en.html|title=25 January 2008: First Vespers for the conclusion of the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity – BENEDICT XVI|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, the Faith and Order Conference changed the date for observing the week of unity prayer to that observed by Catholics. In 1948, with the founding of the [[World Council of Churches]], the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity became increasingly recognised by different churches throughout the world.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

In 1958, the French Catholic group Unité Chrétienne and the [[Faith and Order Commission]] of the [[World Council of Churches]] (a body which includes, among others, most of the world's Orthodox churches as well as many Anglican, Baptist, Lutheran, Methodist, Reformed, United and Independent churches) begin co-operative preparation of materials for the Week of Prayer. The year 1968 saw the first official use of materials prepared jointly by the Faith and Order Commission and the [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]], representing the entire Catholic Church. Collaboration and cooperation between these two organizations has increased steadily since, resulting recently in joint publications in the same format.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

==Observation==
In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], where January is a vacation time, churches often find other days to celebrate the week of prayer, for example around [[Pentecost]] (as originally suggested by the Faith and Order movement in 1926,&lt;ref&gt;''Faith and Order Commission, World Council of Churches''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1894),&lt;ref name="oikoumene.org"/&gt; which is also a symbolic date for the unity of the church.

The 2008 Week of Prayer for Christian Unity was celebrated as the centennial. For the 2012 Week, the biblical text 1 [[Corinthians]] 15:51  was chosen with the theme "We will all be changed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecumenism.net/wpcu/index.htm|title=Ecumenism in Canada / Œcuménisme au Canada|first=Ecumenism in Canada / Œcuménisme au|last=Canada|website=ecumenism.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 Week is provided by the Churches of Latvia and the theme is that all Christians are 'Called to proclaim the mighty acts of the Lord'.&lt;ref&gt;1 Peter 2:9&lt;/ref&gt;

The series begins with [[politician]] Lydia Nance justifying why she's so strongly against [[Mutants (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] during a televised interview. Meanwhile, [[Kitty Pryde]] leads her new team of X-Men against [[Terrax]] as civilians gather to watch the battle. After the battle ends and Terrax is subdued Kitty attempts to address the onlookers with a speech about how the X-Men can be heroes for everyone, but is unsuccessful as the public view of the X-Men has been darkened ever since their [[Inhumans vs X-Men|feud with the Inhumans]]. Kitty faces even more hardships when the government provides her with an increasing amount of paperwork due to the X-Men now living in [[Central Park, New York|Central Park]]. After almost having an awkward reunion with [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Rachel Summers|Prestige]] informs the team that a group of mutants are attacking the city. The X-Men arrive at the [[United Nations]] building and find it under attack by a brand new [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], now including the X-Men's old ally [[Magma (comics)|Magma]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Gold'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; During the ensuing battle [[Mesmero]] captures [[Old Man Logan|Logan]] and the Brotherhood teleports away. [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] arrives on the scene and shows Kitty footage of Nance using the X-Men's fight against the Brotherhood as a means of stirring up paranoia of an impending race-war. The Brotherhood only fuels Nance's anti-mutant stance further when they announce that they kidnapped the mayor and intend to execute him in 24 hours, leading to Nance suggesting mutant-deportation.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Gold'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; Logan attempts to escape but ends up under Mesmero's mind-control. The X-Men find the Brotherhood's base and Logan attempts to ambush them until [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] manages to subdue him. Prestige manages to defeat Mesmero, and it's revealed that Magma was under his control. Not knowing what's real and what isn't anymore, she attacks Kitty and almost burns the whole building down. Kitty manages to get through to her and together they all escape the building and S.H.I.E.L.D. arrests the remainder of the Brotherhood. After Prestige realizes that the entire Brotherhood was under Mesmero's control after he was employed by Nance to stir up anti-mutant hysteria by any means necessary, the X-Men visit Nance personally and threaten to expose her if she continues her campaign.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Gold'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Techno Superior"===
[[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] is hired to steal a supposedly empty vial. Upon returning to his new employer he realizes that it's Olivia Trask, granddaughter of [[Bolivar Trask]]. Gambit then angrily discovers that the vial actually isn't empty and is home to a bunch of [[nanites]]. Gambit attempts to destroy the vial so Trask can't use them but the nanites escape and take on the form of a brand new breed of [[Sentinel (Marvel Comics)|Sentinel]]. Gambit calls the X-Men for help. Storm manages to rescue Gambit just before the Sentinel is able to kill him. While the rest of the X-Men clear civilians, Kitty uses her phasing power to disrupt the Sentinel. As it dissipates Prestige falls unconscious due to massive psychic backlash, revealing that this new Sentinel is [[self-aware]] and is capable of learning from past encounters. Lydia Nance uses this latest incident to label the X-Men as terrorists as their fight against the Sentinel caused major damage to a nearby skyscraper. Meanwhile, the Sentinel reforms and uses a telepathic attack to kill everyone with genetic differences instead of only mutants. [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and other heroes soon join the X-Men to help disperse the crowd and fight off the exponentially increasing onslaught. While unconscious, Prestige telepathically discusses her fears of what the future given her own history and legacy with astral versions of her deceased family. Upon waking up she unleashes the full magnitude of her powers to destroy the Sentinel's consciousness, leaving her unsure of how using her powers like that will affect her in the future. As the X-Men and other heroes leave after making sure all of the civilians are safe, the Sentinel begins to discreetly reform underneath the rubble.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Gold'' #4–6&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Secret Empire"===
Colossus took on critical injuries during the battle against the Sentinel that left him unable to change his body into steel. Prestige kisses Nightcrawler after having figured out his attraction to her given the stronger nature of her psychic powers. Before they can discuss their blossoming relationship further they realize that [[Secret Empire (comics)|Manhattan is becoming shrouded in the Darkforce dimension]]. After communing with [[Dr. Strange]] about what to do Kitty sends Storm, Logan, and Nightcrawler to handle crowd control. Nightcrawler immediately gets attacked by a frightened mob who thinks he's one of the Darkforce demons. Meanwhile, the X-Men learn that a serial killer has infiltrated the mansion in the chaos and has started killing the students. It's revealed that the killer is a new [[X-Cutioner]] and just as he's about to murder Eye-Boy he's discovered by Kitty, Colossus, and Prestige. X-Cutioner shoots directly at Colossus.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Gold'' #7&lt;/ref&gt; Prestige manages to divert his attack and allow Kitty a chance to fight him. Logan and Storm manage to disperse the mob beating Nightcrawler and find him miraculously alive despite the severe and lethal nature of his injuries; Nightcrawler claims that Heaven won't accept him after he escaped the first time. Kitty ends up fighting X-Cutioner on her own after everyone else is evacuated from the mansion. Before beating him she learns that mutants killed his wife and son and blames all mutants for fighting each other with no regard for humans in the crossfire. He shoots at Kitty but Colossus intercepts the shot with his shoulder. After X-Cutioner is arrested Kitty receives a congressional summons for a meeting about a new bill regarding mutant deportation.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Gold'' #8&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Kitty Goes to Washington"===
In Russia, a resurrection ritual begins taking place. Back in the States, Kitty and Colossus travel to [[Washington DC]] where they rendezvous with [[Stevie Hunter]], who now works in Congress. Stevie helps prepare Kitty and Peter for the meeting. Meanwhile, Rachel and Kurt finally go on their first date together and discuss Rachel's fears of what her heightened powers after the Sentinel incident may mean for her future. After Kitty speaks to the congressmen, Peter invites her to dinner where they acknowledge that there is still an attraction between them leading to Peter suggesting that if they were to get back together then the only way they could move forward is via eventual marriage. The next day Kitty returns to speak with Congress again but the meeting is interrupted by [[Whiplash (comics)#Anton Vanko|Whiplash]], who has a grudge against Congress and attempts to assassinate them. Even though Kitty and Peter manage to stop him and save the congressmen, Stevie later on regretfully inform them that it didn't change their minds and they're still going to pass the bill on mutant deportation. Back in Russia, it is revealed that [[Omega Red]] has come back to life.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Gold'' #9&lt;/ref&gt;

==="En'Kane"===
Omega Red adjusts to his newly resurrected life but knows that the resurrection is only temporary, causing him to seek out a way for the resurrection to remain permanent. A short while later Colossus receives a mysterious phone call from an uncle he never met named Anatoly Rasputin, who informs Colossus about Omega Red's mysterious resurrection. Colossus and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] take the X-Men to [[Russia]] with them to survey their meeting with Anatoly. Shortly after Colossus and Magik meet Anatoly, they are ambushed by monsters imbued with magic. As the rest of the X-Men reveal themselves and join in the fight, Illyana ends up captured as and the mob leaves. It is soon revealed that Omega Red needs Illyana's powers as Magik in order for his resurrection to remain permanent.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Gold'' #10&lt;/ref&gt; Peter agrees to let Anatoly lead him to the rest of the mob so they can find Magik, but once they find the mob Anatoly double crosses him. Peter and Nightcrawler manage to find Magik and free her. Omega Red meanwhile ambushes Logan, Storm, and Kitty. After easily defeating Storm and Kitty he fights Logan, seeking vengeance for Logan having killed him in the past. Logan manages to best Omega Red again. As Magik tries to interrogate Anatoly he uses his own magic abilities to fight back and almost kills her until Peter finally becomes able to reuse his abilities again and stops his uncle. After Anatoly is arrested for his crimes with the Russian mob, Kitty and Peter officially get back together as a couple.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Gold'' #11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
According to [[review aggregator]] [[Comic Book Roundup]], the first issue received an average score of 7.7 out of 10 based on 29 critical reviews.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://comicbookroundup.com/comic-books/reviews/marvel-comics/x-men-gold-(2017)/1 X-Men: Gold #1 Reviews (2017)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512003606/http://comicbookroundup.com/comic-books/reviews/marvel-comics/x-men-gold-(2017)/1 |date=2017-05-12 }}," [[Comic Book Roundup]]. Retrieved June 14, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
In the first issue, Colossus wears a shirt with "QS 5:51" printed on the chest.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/04/08/marvel-artist-ardian-syaf-hid-anti-christian-jewish-messages-weeks-x-men-comic/|title=Marvel Artist Ardian Syaf Hid Anti-Christian And Jewish Messages In This Week's X-Men Comic|date=2017-04-08|website=Bleeding Cool Comic Book, Movie, TV News|access-date=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It represents a verse from the [[Qur'an]], Surah Al-Ma'idah 5 verse 51, which reads: 	 
{{blockquote|O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you – then indeed, he is [one] of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people.}}
	 
The verse was topical at the time of printing in [[Jakarta]], Indonesia, where penciller Syaf lives. During the governor election in Jakarta, the sitting governor, [[Basuki Tjahaja Purnama]], was being attacked by opponents for being a minority [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]] Christian. The Qur'an verse QS 5:51 was being used as justification to pressure Muslim voters not to vote for a non-Muslim leader such as Basuki Tjahaja Purnama. Syaf admitted on [[Facebook]] to have participated in these protests and drew this scene after attending one.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;	 
	 
On April 8, 2017, Marvel released a statement via ComicBook.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/marvel/2017/04/08/marvel-releases-statement-on-controversial-x-men-gold-art/|title=Marvel Releases Statement On Controversial X-Men Gold Art|website=Marvel|access-date=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of his actions, Syaf was terminated from his position at Marvel.&lt;ref name=BBCNews11.4.17&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/39576705/marvel-fires-artist-ardian-syaf-over-religious-references-in-x-men-comic-book|title=Marvel fires artist Ardian Syaf over religious references in X-Men comic book|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
