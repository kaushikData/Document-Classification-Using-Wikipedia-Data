'''7-Aminoactinomycin D''' ('''7-AAD''') is a [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] [[chemical compound]] with a strong affinity for [[DNA]].  It is used as a fluorescent [[staining (biology)|marker]] for DNA in [[fluorescence microscopy]] and [[flow cytometry]].  It [[intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalates]] in double-stranded DNA, with a high affinity for GC-rich regions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Liu X |author2=Chen H |author3=Patel D |title=Solution structure of actinomycin-DNA complexes: drug intercalation at isolated G-C sites |journal=J Biomol NMR |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=323–47 |date=1991 |pmid=1841703 |doi=10.1007/BF02192858}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it useful for [[chromosome]] banding studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Latt S |title=Fluorescent probes of chromosome structure and replication |journal=Can J Genet Cytol |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=603–23 |date=1977 |pmid=76502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications==
With an absorption maximum at 546&amp;nbsp;nm, 7-AAD is efficiently excited using a 543&amp;nbsp;nm [[helium–neon laser]]; it can also be excited with somewhat lower efficiency using a 488&amp;nbsp;nm or 514&amp;nbsp;nm argon laser lines.  Its emission has a very large [[Stokes shift]] with a maximum in the deep red: 647&amp;nbsp;nm.  7-AAD is therefore compatible with most blue and green fluorophores &amp;ndash; and even many red fluorophores &amp;ndash; in multicolour applications.

7-AAD does not readily pass through intact [[cell membrane]]s; if it is to be used as a stain for imaging DNA fluorescence, the cell membrane must be permeabilized or disrupted. This method can be used in combination with formaldehyde fixation of samples.

7-AAD is also used as a [[Viability assay|cell viability stain]].  Cells with compromised membranes will stain with 7-AAD, while live cells with intact cell membranes will remain dark.

== Actinomycin D ==
{{main|Actinomycin}}
The related compound actinomycin D is nonfluorescent, but binds DNA in the same way as 7-AAD.  Its [[absorbance]] changes when bound to DNA, and it can be used as a stain in conventional transmission microscopy.

It exists in many cultures (China, India, Islam; in the Western world since Hellenistic times) under different specifications: aiming at the production of gold and/or other perfect substances from baser ones, or of the elixir that prolongs life, or even of life itself. Because of its purpose, the alchemists’ quest is always strictly linked to the religious doctrine of redemption current in each civilization where alchemy is practised.&lt;br&gt; In the Western world alchemy presented itself at its advent as a sacred art.

Islamic and European alchemists developed a structure of basic [[laboratory techniques]], theory, terminology, and [[experimental method]], some of which are still in use today. However, they continued [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]'s belief in [[four elements]] and guarded their work in secrecy including [[History of cryptography|cyphers]] and cryptic symbolism. Their work was guided by [[Hermeticism|Hermetic principles]] related to [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[mythology]], and [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Wouter J. Hanegraaff (Cambridge University Press: 2012), ''Alchemy between Science and Religion'',  [https://books.google.ro/books?id=02bfnhO0H8sC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=de&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Esotericism and the Academy: Rejected Knowledge in Western Culture'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its [[exoteric]] practical applications and its [[esoteric]] spiritual aspects, despite the arguments of scholars like [[Eric John Holmyard|Holmyard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marie-Louise von Franz|von Franz]]&lt;ref name="FRAALC97"&gt;{{harvp|von Franz|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that they should be understood as complementary. The former is pursued by [[History of the physical sciences|historians of the physical sciences]] who examine the subject in terms of [[History of chemistry|early chemistry]], [[History of medicine|medicine]], and [[charlatanism]], and the philosophical and religious contexts in which these events occurred. The latter interests historians of [[esotericism]], [[History of psychology|psychologists]], and some philosophers and [[Spirituality|spiritualists]]. The subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts. Despite this split, which von Franz believes has existed since the Western traditions' origin in a mix of [[Greek philosophy]] that was mixed with [[Ancient Egyptian technology|Egyptian]] and [[Mesopotamian science|Mesopotamian technology]],&lt;ref name="FRAALC97" /&gt; numerous sources have stressed an integration of esoteric and exoteric approaches to alchemy as far back as [[Pseudo-Democritus]]'s first-century&amp;nbsp;{{sc|ad}} ''On Physical and Mystical Matters'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Physika kai Mystika}}).&lt;ref&gt;Matteo Martelli, ''The Four Books of Pseudo-Democritus'' (Maney, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Although alchemy is popularly associated with magic, historian [[Lawrence M. Principe]] writes "Most readers probably are aware of several common claims about alchemy—for example, ... that it is akin to magic, or that its practice then or now is essentially deceptive. These ideas about alchemy emerged during the eighteenth century or after. While each of them might have limited validity within a narrow context, none of them is an accurate depiction of alchemy in general."&lt;ref&gt;Principe, Lawrence M. The secrets of alchemy. University of Chicago Press, 2012, 86&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Etymology}}

== Etymology ==
{{See also|Chemistry (etymology)}}
The word alchemy comes from [[Old French]] ''alquemie'', ''alkimie'', used in [[Medieval Latin]] as ''alchymia''. This name was itself brought from the [[Arabic]] word ''al-kīmiyā’'' ({{rtl-lang|ar|الكيمياء}} or {{rtl-lang|ar|الخيمياء}}) composed of two parts: the [[Late Greek]] term ''khēmeía'' (χημεία), ''khēmía'' (χημία), meaning 'to fuse or cast a metal',&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0017630#DWS-M_EN_GB-037342 alchemy], Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the etymology for χημεία in {{Cite book| edition = Eighth edition, revised throughout| publisher = Clarendon Press| last = Liddell| first = Henry George|author2=Robert Scott| title = A Greek-English Lexicon| location = Oxford| year = 1901| isbn = 978-0-19-910205-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Arabic [[definite article]] ''[[al-]]''  ({{rtl-lang|ar|الـ}}), meaning 'The'.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{OED|alchemy}} Or see {{OEtymD|alchemy|accessdate=April 7, 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Together this association can be interpreted as 'the process of [[Magnum opus (alchemy)|transmutation]] by which to fuse or reunite with the divine or original form'. Its roots can be traced to the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] name  ''kēme'' (hieroglyphic 𓆎𓅓𓏏𓊖 ''khmi'' ), meaning ‘black earth’ which refers to the fertile and auriferous soil of the Nile valley, as opposed to red desert sand.&lt;ref name=OED /&gt;

According to the Egyptologist [[Wallis Budge]], the Arabic word ''al-kīmiyaʾ'' actually means "the Egyptian [science]", borrowing from the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] word for "Egypt", ''kēme'' (or its equivalent in the Mediaeval [[Bohairic]] dialect of Coptic, ''khēme''). This Coptic word derives from [[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]] ''kmỉ'', itself from ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''kmt''. The ancient Egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour "black" (Egypt was the "Black Land", by contrast with the "Red Land", the surrounding desert); so this etymology could also explain the nickname "Egyptian black arts". However, according to [[Carl August Friedrich Mahn|Mahn]], this theory may be an example of [[folk etymology]].&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt; Assuming an Egyptian origin, chemistry is defined as follows:

:'''Chemistry''', from the ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] word "khēmia" meaning transmutation of earth, is the [[science]] of [[matter]] at the [[atom]]ic to [[molecular]] scale, dealing primarily with  collections of atoms, such as [[molecule]]s, [[crystal]]s, and [[metal]]s.

Thus, according to Budge and others, chemistry derives from an Egyptian word ''khemein'' or ''khēmia'', "preparation of black powder", ultimately derived from the name ''khem'', Egypt. A decree of [[Diocletian]], written about 300 AD in Greek, speaks against "the ancient writings of the Egyptians, which treat of the ''khēmia'' [[Chrysopoeia|transmutation]] of gold and silver".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary#Electronic versions|Oxford English Dictionary Online]],'' s.v. alchemy&lt;/ref&gt;

The Medieval Latin form was influenced by Greek ''chymeia'' (χυμεία) meaning ‘mixture’ and referring to [[pharmaceutical chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, both the etymology given in the Oxford English Dictionary and also that for χυμεία in {{Cite book| edition = A new edition, revised and augmented throughout| publisher = Clarendon Press| last = Liddell| first = Henry George|author2=Robert Scott|author3=Henry Stuart Jones| title = A Greek-English Lexicon| location = Oxford| year = 1940|url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=xumeia&amp;la=greek#lexicon| isbn = 978-0-19-910205-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Alchemy is several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents. These traditions' general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and "genetic" relationships. One can distinguish at least three major strands, which appear to be largely independent, at least in their earlier stages: [[Chinese alchemy]], centered in China and its zone of cultural influence; [[Rasayana|Indian alchemy]], centered on the [[Indian subcontinent]]; and Western alchemy, which occurred around the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and whose center has shifted over the millennia from [[Egypt (Roman province)|Greco-Roman Egypt]], to the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], and finally [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]]. Chinese alchemy was closely connected to [[Taoism]] and Indian alchemy with the [[Indian religions|Dharmic faiths]], whereas Western alchemy developed its own philosophical system that was largely independent of, but influenced by, various [[Western religion]]s. It is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin, or to what extent they influenced each other.

=== Hellenistic Egypt ===
[[File:Zosimosapparat.jpg|thumb|left|300px| Ambix, cucurbit and retort of [[Zosimos of Panopolis|Zosimos]], from [[Marcelin Berthelot]], ''Collection des anciens alchimistes grecs'' (3 vol., Paris, 1887–1888).]]

The start of Western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and [[Hellenistic Egypt]], where the city of [[Alexandria]] was a center of alchemical knowledge, and retained its pre-eminence through most of the Greek and Roman periods.&lt;ref&gt;''New Scientist'', 24–31 December 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Here, elements of technology, religion, mythology, and [[Hellenistic philosophy]], each with their own much longer histories, combined to form the earliest known records of alchemy in the West. [[Zosimos of Panopolis]] wrote the oldest known books on alchemy,{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} while [[Mary the Jewess]] is credited as being the first non-fictitious Western alchemist. They wrote in [[Greek language|Greek]] and lived in [[Egypt]] under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule.

'''Mythology''' – Zosimos of Panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to [[Ancient Egypt|Pharaonic Egypt]] where it was the domain of the priestly class, though there is little to no evidence for his assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garfinkel|first=Harold|title=Ethnomethodological Studies of Work|publisher=Routledge &amp;Kegan Paul|year=1986|pages=127|isbn=978-0-415-11965-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alchemical writers used Classical figures from Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Bonnefoy. 'Roman and European Mythologies'. University of Chicago Press, 1992. pp. 211–213&lt;/ref&gt;  These included the pantheon of gods related to the Classical planets, [[Isis]], [[Osiris]], [[Jason]], and many others.

The central figure in the mythology of alchemy is [[Hermes Trismegistus]] (or Thrice-Great Hermes). His name is derived from the [[deity|god]] [[Thoth]] and his Greek counterpart [[Hermes]]. Hermes and his [[caduceus]] or serpent-staff, were among alchemy's principal symbols. According to [[Clement of Alexandria]], he wrote what were called the "forty-two books of Hermes", covering all fields of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume II/CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA/The Stromata, or Miscellanies/Book VI/Chapter IV.|Clement, ''Stromata'', vi. 4.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Hermetica]]'' of Thrice-Great Hermes is generally understood to form the basis for Western alchemical philosophy and practice, called the [[hermeticism|hermetic philosophy]] by its early practitioners. These writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era.

'''Technology''' – The dawn of Western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of [[metallurgy]], extending back to 3500&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Linden|1996|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many writings were lost when the [[Roman Emperor|emperor]] [[Diocletian]] ordered the burning of alchemical books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Partington|first=James Riddick|title=A Short History of Chemistry|year=1989|pages=20|isbn=978-0-486-65977-0|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; after suppressing a revolt in Alexandria ({{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;292). Few original Egyptian documents on alchemy have survived, most notable among them the [[Stockholm papyrus]] and the [[Leyden papyrus X]]. Dating from {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;300–500, they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones, cleaning and fabricating pearls, and manufacturing of imitation gold and silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Linden|2003|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; These writings lack the mystical, philosophical elements of alchemy, but do contain the works of [[Bolus of Mendes]] (or [[Pseudo-Democritus]]), which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the [[classical elements]].&lt;ref name="Chemistry, Bensaude-Vincent 1996, p13"&gt;''A History of Chemistry'', Bensaude-Vincent, Isabelle Stengers, ''Harvard University Press'', 1996, '''p13'''&lt;/ref&gt; Between the time of Bolus and Zosimos, the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into a Hermetic art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Linden|1996|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philosophy''' – Alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of [[Pythagoreanism]], [[Platonism]], [[Stoicism]] and [[Gnosticism]] which formed the origin of alchemy's character.&lt;ref name="Chemistry, Bensaude-Vincent 1996, p13" /&gt; An important example of alchemy's roots in Greek philosophy, originated by [[Empedocles]] and developed by Aristotle, was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements: [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Water (classical element)|water]], and [[Fire (classical element)|fire]]. According to Aristotle, each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lindsay, Jack | title=The Origins of Alchemy in Graeco-Roman Egypt | location=London | publisher=Muller | year=1970 | isbn= 978-0-389-01006-7 | page=16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The four elements of the Greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter, not quantitative, as our modern elements are; "...True alchemy never regarded earth, air, water, and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present-day sense of the word. The four elements are simply the primary, and most general, qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Titus | last=Burckhardt | authorlink=Titus Burckhardt | title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul | location=Baltimore | publisher=Penguin | year=1967 | page=66 | others=Trans. William Stoddart | isbn=978-0-906540-96-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept.

Alchemy coexisted alongside emerging [[Christianity]]. [[Lactantius]] believed Hermes Trismegistus had prophesied its birth. [[Augustine of Hippo|St&amp;nbsp;Augustine]] later affirmed this in the 4th &amp; 5th centuries, but also condemned Trismegistus for idolatry.&lt;ref&gt;Fanning, Philip Ashley. ''Isaac Newton and the Transmutation of Alchemy: An Alternative View of the Scientific Revolution.'' 2009. p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of Pagan, Christian, and Jewish alchemists can be found during this period.

Most of the Greco-Roman alchemists preceding Zosimos are known only by pseudonyms, such as [[Moses of Alexandria|Moses]], Isis, [[Cleopatra the Alchemist|Cleopatra]], [[Pseudo-Democritus|Democritus]], and [[Ostanes]]. Others authors such as Komarios, and [[Chymes]], we only know through fragments of text. After {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;400, Greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in commenting on the works of these predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;F. Sherwood Taylor.

''Alchemy and early modern chemistry: papers from Ambix.'' p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; It was at that time that [[Khalid Ibn Yazid]] sparked its migration from Alexandria to the Islamic world, facilitating the translation and preservation of Greek alchemical texts in the 8th and 9th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Glen Warren Bowersock, Peter Robert Lamont Brown, Oleg Grabar.

The [[Vedas]] describe a connection between eternal life and gold.&lt;ref name=eb /&gt; The use of [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] for alchemy is first documented in the 3rd- or 4th-century ''[[Arthashastra]]''. [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] texts from the 2nd to 5th centuries mention the transmutation of base metals to gold. Greek alchemy may have been introduced to Ancient India through the invasions of [[Alexander the Great]] in 325&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, and kingdoms that were culturally influenced by the Greeks like [[Gandhāra]], although hard evidence for this is lacking.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;Multhauf, Robert P. &amp; Gilbert, Robert Andrew (2008).

The 11th-century [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|Persian chemist]] and [[Medicine in medieval Islam|physician]] [[Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī]], who visited Gujarat as part of the court of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], reported that they
{{bquote|have a science similar to alchemy which is quite peculiar to them, which in [[Sanskrit]] is called [[Rasayāna]] and in Persian [[Rasavātam]]. It means the art of obtaining/manipulating ''Rasa'': nectar, mercury, and juice. This art was restricted to certain operations, metals, drugs, compounds, and medicines, many of which have mercury as their core element. Its principles restored the health of those who were ill beyond hope and gave back youth to fading old age.}}
The goals of alchemy in India included the creation of a divine body (Sanskrit ''divya-deham'') and immortality while still embodied (Sanskrit ''jīvan-mukti'').  Sanskrit alchemical texts include much material on the manipulation of mercury and sulphur, that are homologized with the semen of the god Śiva and the menstrual blood of the goddess Devī.

Some early alchemical writings seem to have their origins in the [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kaula]] tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of [[Matsyendranath]].  Other early writings are found in the Jaina medical treatise ''Kalyāṇakārakam'' of Ugrāditya, written in South India in the early 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meulenbeld|first1=G.

Two famous early Indian alchemical authors were [[Nagarjuna (metallurgist)|Nāgārjuna Siddha]] and Nityanātha Siddha. Nāgārjuna Siddha was a Buddhist monk. His book, ''Rasendramangalam'', is an example of Indian alchemy and medicine. Nityanātha Siddha wrote ''Rasaratnākara'', also a highly influential work. In Sanskrit, ''rasa'' translates to "mercury", and Nāgārjuna Siddha was said to have developed a method of converting mercury into gold.&lt;ref&gt;See Dominik Wujastyk, "An Alchemical Ghost: The Rasaratnākara of Nāgarjuna" in ''Ambix'' 31.2 (1984): 70-83.

[[File:Jabir ibn Hayyan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jābir ibn Hayyān|Jabir ibn Hayyan]] (Geber), considered the "father of [[chemistry]]", introduced a [[Scientific method|scientific]] and [[experiment]]al approach to alchemy.]]

After [[The fall of the roman empire|the fall of the Roman Empire]], the focus of alchemical development moved to the Islamic World. Much more is known about [[Islam]]ic alchemy because it was better documented: indeed, most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as Arabic translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Titus | last=Burckhardt | authorlink=Titus Burckhardt | title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul | location=Baltimore | publisher=Penguin | year=1967 | page=46 | others=Trans. William Stoddart | isbn=978-0-906540-96-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''alchemy'' itself was derived from the Arabic word ''al-kīmiyā’'' (الكيمياء). The early Islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy. [[Plato]]nic and [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] thought, which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science, continued to be assimilated during the late 7th and early 8th centuries through [[Syriac language|Syriac]] translations and scholarship.

In the late 8th century, [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (Latinized as "Geber" or "Geberus") introduced a new approach to alchemy, based on [[scientific method]]ology and controlled [[experiment]]ation in the [[laboratory]], in contrast to the ancient Greek and Egyptian alchemists whose works were often allegorical and unintelligible, with very little concern for laboratory work.&lt;ref name=Kraus /&gt; Jabir is thus "considered by many to be the father of [[chemistry]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Zygmunt S.|last=Derewenda|year=2007|title=On wine, chirality and crystallography|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section A|volume=64|issue=Pt 1|pages=246–258 [247]|doi=10.1107/S0108767307054293|pmid=18156689|bibcode = 2008AcCrA..64..246D |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; albeit others reserve that title for [[Robert Boyle]] or [[Antoine Lavoisier]]. The science historian, Paul Kraus, wrote:

{{quote|To form an idea of the historical place of Jabir's alchemy and to tackle the problem of its sources, it is advisable to compare it with what remains to us of the alchemical literature in the [[Greek language]]. One knows in which miserable state this literature reached us. Collected by [[Byzantine science|Byzantine scientists]] from the tenth century, the corpus of the Greek alchemists is a cluster of incoherent fragments, going back to all the times since the third century until the end of the Middle Ages.

The efforts of Berthelot and Ruelle to put a little order in this mass of literature led only to poor results, and the later researchers, among them in particular Mrs. Hammer-Jensen, Tannery, Lagercrantz, von Lippmann, Reitzenstein, Ruska, Bidez, Festugiere and others, could make clear only few points of detail ....

The study of the Greek alchemists is not very encouraging. An even surface examination of the Greek texts shows that a very small part only was organized according to true experiments of laboratory: even the supposedly technical writings, in the state where we find them today, are unintelligible nonsense which refuses any interpretation.

It is different with Jabir's alchemy. The relatively clear description of the processes and the alchemical apparati, the methodical classification of the substances, mark an experimental spirit which is extremely far away from the weird and odd esotericism of the Greek texts. The theory on which Jabir supports his operations is one of clearness and of an impressive unity. More than with the other Arab authors, one notes with him a balance between theoretical teaching and practical teaching, between the ''[[Ilm (Arabic)|`ilm]]'' and the ''`amal''. In vain one would seek in the Greek texts a work as systematic as that which is presented, for example, in the ''Book of Seventy''.&lt;ref name=Kraus&gt;Kraus, Paul, Jâbir ibn Hayyân, ''Contribution à l'histoire des idées scientifiques dans l'Islam. I. Le corpus des écrits jâbiriens. II. Jâbir et la science grecque,''. Cairo (1942–1943). Repr. By Fuat Sezgin, (Natural Sciences in Islam. 67–68), Frankfurt. 2002:
(cf. {{cite web|author=[[Ahmad Y Hassan]]|title=A Critical Reassessment of the Geber Problem: Part Three|url=http://www.history-science-technology.com/geber/geber%2003.html|accessdate=16 September 2014}})&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jabir himself clearly recognized and proclaimed the importance of experimentation:

{{bquote|The first essential in chemistry is that thou shouldest perform practical work and conduct experiments,&lt;br /&gt; for he who performs not practical work nor makes experiments will never attain to the least degree of mastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1931|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Early Islamic chemists such as [[Jābir ibn Hayyān|Jabir Ibn Hayyan]], [[Al-Kindi]] ("Alkindus") and [[Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi]] ("Rasis" or "Rhazes") contributed a number of key chemical discoveries, such as the muriatic ([[hydrochloric acid]]), [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] and [[nitric acid]]s, and more. The discovery that [[aqua regia]], a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids, could dissolve the noblest metal, gold, was to fuel the imagination of alchemists for the next millennium.

Islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism. The most influential author in this regard was arguably Jabir. Jabir's ultimate goal was ''[[Takwin]]'', the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory, up to, and including, human life. He analyzed each Aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of ''hotness'', ''coldness'', ''dryness'', and ''moistness''.&lt;ref name=burckhardt29 /&gt; According to Jabir, in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior. For example, lead was externally cold and dry, while gold was hot and moist. Thus, Jabir theorized, by rearranging the qualities of one metal, a different metal would result.&lt;ref name=burckhardt29&gt;{{cite book | first=Titus | last=Burckhardt | authorlink=Titus Burckhardt | title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul | location=Baltimore | publisher=Penguin | year=1967 | page=29 | others=Trans. William Stoddart | isbn=978-0-906540-96-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this reasoning, the search for the [[philosopher's stone]] was introduced to Western alchemy. Jabir developed an elaborate [[numerology]] whereby the root letters of a substance's name in Arabic, when treated with various transformations, held correspondences to the element's physical properties.

The elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with Jabir. His original system consisted of seven elements, which included the five [[classical element]]s ([[aether (classical element)|aether]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], and [[Water (classical element)|water]]) in addition to two [[chemical element]]s representing the metals: [[Sulfur|sulphur]], "the stone which burns", which characterized the principle of combustibility, and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties. Shortly thereafter, this evolved into eight elements, with the Arabic concept of the three metallic principles: sulphur giving flammability or combustion, mercury giving volatility and stability, and [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] giving solidity.&lt;ref name="r8"&gt;Strathern, Paul. (2000), ''Mendeleyev's Dream – the Quest for the Elements'', New York: [[Berkley Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[atomic theory]] of [[corpuscularianism]], where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or corpuscles, also has its origins in the work of Jabir.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Distilling knowledge: alchemy, chemistry, and the scientific revolution|first=Bruce T.|last=Moran|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=978-0-674-01495-4|page=146|quote=a corpuscularian tradition in alchemy stemming from the speculations of the medieval author Geber (Jabir ibn Hayyan)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 9th to 14th centuries, alchemical theories faced criticism from a variety of practical Muslim chemists, including [[Al-Kindi|Alkindus]],&lt;ref&gt;Felix Klein-Frank (2001), "Al-Kindi", in [[Oliver Leaman]] &amp; [[Hossein Nasr]], ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', p. 174.

Whereas European alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble metals, Chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine. The [[philosopher's stone]] of European alchemists can be compared to the [[Elixir of life|Grand Elixir of Immortality]] sought by Chinese alchemists. However, in the hermetic view, these two goals were not unconnected, and the philosopher's stone was often equated with the [[Panacea (medicine)|universal panacea]]; therefore, the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears.

[[Black powder]] may have been an important invention of Chinese alchemists. As previously stated above, [[China|Chinese]] alchemy was more related to medicine. It is said that the Chinese invented gunpowder while trying to find a [[potion]] for eternal life. Described in 9th-century texts{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} and used in [[fireworks]] in China by the 10th century,{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} it was used in [[cannon]]s by 1290.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} From China, the use of [[gunpowder]] spread to Japan, the [[Mongol]]s, the Muslim world, and Europe. Gunpowder was used by the Mongols against the Hungarians in 1241, and in Europe by the 14th century.

Chinese alchemy was closely connected to [[Taoist]] forms of [[traditional Chinese medicine]], such as [[Acupuncture]] and [[Moxibustion]], and to martial arts such as [[T'ai chi ch'uan|Tai Chi Chuan]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} and [[Kung Fu]] (although some Tai Chi schools believe that their art derives from the philosophical or hygienic branches of Taoism, not Alchemical). In fact, in the early [[Song dynasty]], followers of this Taoist idea (chiefly the elite and upper class) would ingest [[cinnabar|mercuric sulfide]], which, though tolerable in low levels, led many to suicide.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} Thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the Taoist heavens, the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favor of external sources{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} (the aforementioned Tai Chi Chuan,{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} mastering of the [[qi]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} etc.)

[[File:WMS 446, R. Lullius, Ymage de Vie, late 15th Wellcome L0031726.jpg|thumb|"An illuminated page from a book on alchemical processes and receipts", ca. 15th century.]]

The introduction of alchemy to Latin Europe may be dated to 11 February 1144, with the completion of [[Robert of Chester]]'s translation of the Arabic ''Book of the Composition of Alchemy''. Although European craftsmen and technicians preexisted, Robert notes in his preface that alchemy was unknown in Latin Europe at the time of his writing. The translation of Arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in 12th-century [[Toledo, Spain]], through contributors like [[Gerard of Cremona]] and [[Adelard of Bath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|pp=105–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translations of the time included the [[Turba Philosophorum]], and the works of [[Avicenna]] and [[al-Razi]]. These brought with them many new words to the European vocabulary for which there was no previous Latin equivalent. Alcohol, carboy, elixir, and athanor are examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism, thereby priming Europe for the influx of alchemical thought. The 11th-century [[Anselm of Canterbury|St&amp;nbsp;Anselm]] put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a Christian context. In the early 12th century, [[Peter Abelard]] followed Anselm's work, laying down the foundation for acceptance of Aristotelian thought before the first works of Aristotle had reached the West. In the early 13th century, [[Robert Grosseteste]] used Abelard's methods of analysis and added the use of observation, experimentation, and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations. Grosseteste also did much work to reconcile Platonic and Aristotelian thinking.&lt;ref name=hollister294f&gt;{{cite book | author=Hollister, C.

Through much of the 12th and 13th centuries, alchemical knowledge in Europe remained centered on translations, and new Latin contributions were not made. The efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists. In the 13th century, [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Roger Bacon]] were the most notable of these, their work summarizing and explaining the newly imported alchemical knowledge in Aristotelian terms.&lt;ref&gt;John Read. ''From Alchemy to Chemistry.'' 1995 p.90&lt;/ref&gt; Albertus Magnus, a [[Dominican Order|Dominican monk]], is known to have written works such as the ''Book of Minerals'' where he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like Hermes and Democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time. Albertus critically compared these to the writings of Aristotle and Avicenna, where they concerned the transmutation of metals. From the time shortly after his death through to the 15th century, more than 28 alchemical tracts were misattributed to him, a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist.&lt;ref&gt;James A. Weisheipl. ''Albertus Magnus and the Sciences: Commemorative Essays.'' PIMS. 1980. p.187-202&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, alchemical texts have been attributed to Albert's student [[Thomas Aquinas]].

Roger Bacon, a [[Franciscan Order|Franciscan monk]] who wrote on a wide variety of topics including [[optics]], [[comparative linguistics]], and medicine, composed his ''[[Opus Majus|Great Work]]'' ({{lang-la|Opus Majus}}) for {{nowrap|[[Pope Clement IV]]}} as part of a project towards rebuilding the [[medieval university]] curriculum to include the new learning of his time. While alchemy was not more important to him than other sciences and he did not produce allegorical works on the topic, he did consider it and astrology to be important parts of both natural philosophy and theology and his contributions advanced alchemy's connections to [[soteriology]] and Christian theology. Bacon's writings integrated morality, salvation, alchemy, and the prolongation of life. His correspondence with Clement highlighted this, noting the importance of alchemy to the papacy.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Brehm. "Roger Bacon's Place in the History of Alchemy." ''Ambix.'' Vol. 23, Part I, March 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Greeks before him, Bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres. He noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of Aristotle, the natural philosophers, and all Latin writers of his time. The practical, however, confirmed the theoretical thought experiment, and Bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|pp=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later European legend, however, Bacon became an archmage. In particular, along with Albertus Magnus, he was credited with the forging of a [[brazen head]] capable of answering its owner's questions.

Soon after Bacon, the influential work of [[Pseudo-Geber]] (sometimes identified as [[Paul of Taranto]]) appeared. His ''Summa Perfectionis'' remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods. It was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur-mercury theory, and the unusual clarity with which they were described.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|pp=134–141}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 13th century, alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief. Adepts believed in the macrocosm-microcosm theories of Hermes, that is to say, they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body (for example, if one could learn the secret of purifying gold, one could use the technique to purify the [[soul|human soul]]). They believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above, and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded [[jargon]] set with traps to mislead the uninitiated. Finally, the alchemists practiced their art: they actively experimented with chemicals and made [[observation]]s and [[theory|theories]] about how the universe operated. Their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man's soul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam. By purifying the two parts of man's soul, man could be reunited with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Titus | last=Burckhardt | authorlink=Titus Burckhardt | title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul | location=Baltimore | publisher=Penguin | year=1967 | page=149 | others=Trans.

In the 14th century, alchemy became more accessible to Europeans outside the confines of Latin speaking churchmen and scholars. Alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Tara E. Nummedal. ''Alchemy and Authority in the Holy Roman Empire.'' University of Chicago Press, 2007. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dante]], [[Piers Plowman]], and [[Chaucer]] all painted unflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars. [[Pope John XXII]]'s 1317 edict, ''[[Spondent quas non exhibent]]'' forbade the false promises of transmutation made by pseudo-alchemists.&lt;ref&gt;John Hines, II, R. F. Yeager. ''John Gower, Trilingual Poet: Language, Translation, and Tradition.'' Boydell &amp; Brewer. 2010. p.170&lt;/ref&gt; In 1403, Henry IV of England banned the practice of multiplying metals (although it was possible to buy a licence to attempt to make gold alchemically, and a number were granted by Henry VI and Edward IV&lt;ref&gt;D. Geoghegan, "A licence of Henry VI to practise Alchemy" Ambix, volume 6, 1957, pages 10-17&lt;/ref&gt;). These critiques and regulations centered more around pseudo-alchemical charlatanism than the actual study of alchemy, which continued with an increasingly Christian tone. The 14th century saw the Christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of [[Petrus Bonus]], [[John of Rupescissa]], and in works written in the name of Raymond Lull and Arnold of Villanova.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leah DeVun]]. ''From Prophecy, Alchemy, and the End of Time: John of Rupescissa in the late Middle Ages.'' Columbia University Press, 2009. p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicolas Flamel]] is a well-known alchemist, but a good example of [[pseudepigraphy]], the practice of giving your works the name of someone else, usually more famous. Although the historical Flamel existed, the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in 1612.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Linden|2003|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Nicolas Flamel. Des Livres et de l'or" by Nigel Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; Flamel was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors, and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the [[philosopher's stone]]. His work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions, but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations. Most of 'his' work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him, especially as regarded the philosopher's stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Titus | last=Burckhardt | authorlink=Titus Burckhardt | title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul | location=Baltimore | publisher=Penguin | year=1967 | pages=170–181 | others=Trans. William Stoddart | isbn=978-0-906540-96-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the [[late Middle Ages|14th and 15th centuries]], alchemists were much like Flamel: they concentrated on looking for the philosophers' stone. [[Bernard Trevisan]] and [[George Ripley (alchemist)|George Ripley]] made similar contributions. Their cryptic allusions and [[symbol]]ism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art.

The word [[rubedo]], meaning "redness", was adopted by alchemists and signalled alchemical success, and the end of the great work.]]

During the [[Renaissance]], Hermetic and Platonic foundations were restored to European alchemy. The dawn of medical, pharmaceutical, occult, and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed.

In the late 15th century, [[Marsilo Ficino]] translated the [[Corpus Hermeticum]] and the works of Plato into Latin. These were previously unavailable to Europeans who for the first time had a full picture of the alchemical theory that Bacon had declared absent. [[Renaissance Humanism]] and [[Renaissance Neoplatonism]] guided alchemists away from physics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel.

Esoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into a broader occult Hermeticism, fusing it with magic, astrology, and Christian cabala.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Forshaw. '"Chemistry, That Starry Science" - Early Modern Conjunctions of Astrology and Alchemy' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Forshaw, 'Cabala Chymica or Chemia Cabalistica – Early Modern Alchemists and Cabala' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; A key figure in this development was German [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] (1486–1535), who received his Hermetic education in Italy in the schools of the humanists. In his ''De Occulta Philosophia'', he attempted to merge [[Kabbalah]], Hermeticism, and alchemy. He was instrumental in spreading this new blend of Hermeticism outside the borders of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Alexander Magee. ''Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition.'' Cornell University Press. 2008. p.30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke. ''The Western Esoteric Traditions: A Historical Introduction.'' Oxford University Press. 2008 p.60&lt;/ref&gt;

Philippus Aureolus [[Paracelsus]], (Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, 1493–1541) cast alchemy into a new form, rejecting some of Agrippa's occultism and moving away from [[chrysopoeia]]. Paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote, "Many have said of Alchemy, that it is for the making of gold and silver. For me such is not the aim, but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Edwardes, Michael | title=The Dark Side of History | location=New York | publisher=Stein and Day | year=1977 | page=47 | isbn=978-0-552-11463-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and Nature the macrocosm. He took an approach different from those before him, using this analogy not in the manner of soul-purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies, and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Debus, Allen G.]] |author2=Multhauf, Robert P. | title=Alchemy and Chemistry in the Seventeenth Century | location=Los Angeles | publisher=William Andrews Clark Memorial Library, University of California. | year=1966 | pages=6–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paracelsian practical alchemy, especially herbal medicine and plant remedies has since been named [[spagyric]] (a synonym for alchemy from the Greek words meaning ''to separate'' and ''to join together'', based on the Latin alchemic maxim: ''solve et coagula'').&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Needham. ''Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 5, Spagyrical Discovery and Invention: Physiological Alchemy.'' Cambridge University Press. P.9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iatrochemistry]] also refers to the pharmaceutical applications of alchemy championed by Paracelsus.

[[John Dee]] (13 July 1527 – December, 1608) followed Agrippa's occult tradition. Although better known for angel summoning, divination, and his role as [[astrologer]], cryptographer, and consultant to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], Dee's alchemical&lt;ref&gt;“''Monas hieroglyphica'' is not a traditional alchemical work, but has important theoretical insights about a cosmic vision, in which alchemy played an important part.”{{cite web | last = Szőnyi| first = György E.| year = 2015 | url = http://www.renesancni-texty.upol.cz/soubory/publikace/Latin_Alchemical_Literature_of_Czech_Provenance.pdf | title = 'Layers of Meaning in Alchemy in John Dee's Monas hieroglyphica and its Relevance in a Central European Context'| publisher =  Centre for Renaissance Texts, 2015, 118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Monas Hieroglyphica'', written in 1564 was his most popular and influential work.

''Secrets of Nature: Astrology and Alchemy in Early Modern Europe''. MIT Press, 2001. P.173.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 17th century, a short-lived "supernatural" interpretation of alchemy became popular, including support by fellows of the [[Royal Society]]: [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Elias Ashmole]]. Proponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the [[philosopher's stone]] might be used to summon and communicate with angels.&lt;ref&gt;* ''Journal of the History of Ideas, 41'', 1980, '''p. 293-318'''

Entrepreneurial opportunities were common for the alchemists of Renaissance Europe. Alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining, medical services, and the production of chemicals, medicines, metals, and gemstones.&lt;ref&gt;Tara E. Nummedal. ''Alchemy and authority in the Holy Roman Empire.'' p.4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]], in the late 16th century, famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in Prague, including Dee and his associate [[Edward Kelley]]. [[James IV of Scotland|King James IV of Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. iii, (1901), 99, 202, 206, 209, 330, 340, 341, 353, 355, 365, 379, 382, 389, 409.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], [[Henry V, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], [[Augustus, Elector of Saxony]], [[Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn]], and [[Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]] all contracted alchemists.&lt;ref&gt;Tara E. Nummedal. ''Alchemy and authority in the Holy Roman Empire.'' p.85-98&lt;/ref&gt; John's son [[Arthur Dee]] worked as a court physician to [[Michael I of Russia]] and [[Charles I of England]] but also compiled the alchemical book ''[[Fasciculus Chemicus]]''.
[[File:Alchemik Sedziwoj Matejko.JPG|thumb|left|250px|''Alchemist [[Sendivogius]]'' (1566–1636) by [[Jan Matejko]], 1867]]
Although most of these appointments were legitimate, the trend of pseudo-alchemical fraud continued through the Renaissance. ''Betrüger'' would use sleight of hand, or claims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage. Legitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as [[Michael Maier]] and [[Heinrich Khunrath]] wrote about fraudulent transmutations, distinguishing themselves from the [[con artist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tara E. Nummedal. ''Alchemy and authority in the Holy Roman Empire.'' p.171&lt;/ref&gt;  False alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud.

The terms "chemia" and "alchemia" were used as synonyms in the early modern period, and the differences between alchemy, chemistry and small-scale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day. There were important overlaps between practitioners, and trying to classify them into alchemists, chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic. For example, [[Tycho Brahe]] (1546–1601), an alchemist better known for his [[astronomical]] and [[astrological]] investigations, had a laboratory built at his [[Uraniborg]] observatory/research institute. [[Michał Sędziwój|Michael Sendivogius]] (''Michał Sędziwój'', 1566–1636), a [[Poland|Polish]] alchemist, philosopher, medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling [[oxygen]] in a lab sometime around 1600. Sendivogious taught his technique to [[Cornelius Drebbel]] who, in 1621, applied this in a submarine. [[Isaac Newton]] devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy (see [[Isaac Newton's occult studies]]) than he did to either optics or physics. Other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include [[Robert Boyle]], and [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]]. Their Hermeticism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science.

=== Late modern period ===
[[File:The Shannon Portrait of the Hon Robert Boyle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert Boyle]]]]
[[File:Alchemist.png|thumb|right|An alchemist, pictured in Charles Mackay's ''[[Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds]]''.]]
The decline of European alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for "ancient wisdom". Although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the 17th century, alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years, and in fact may have reached its peak in the 18th century. As late as 1781 [[James Price (chemist)|James Price]] claimed to have produced a powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold. Early modern European alchemy continued to exhibit a diversity of theories, practices, and purposes: "Scholastic and anti-Aristotelian, Paracelsian and anti-Paracelsian, Hermetic, Neoplatonic, mechanistic, vitalistic, and more—plus virtually every combination and compromise thereof."&lt;ref name="Alchemy Restored"&gt;Principe, Lawrence M. "Alchemy Restored." Isis 102.2 (2011): 305-12. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Boyle]] (1627–1691) pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations. He assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data. Boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out, the wind characteristics, the position of the Sun and Moon, and the barometer reading, all just in case they proved to be relevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Pilkington, Roger | title=Robert Boyle: Father of Chemistry | location=London | publisher=John Murray | year=1959 | page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries, based on revolutionary discoveries of [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]] and [[John Dalton]].

Beginning around 1720, a rigid distinction was drawn between "alchemy" and "chemistry" for the first time.&lt;ref name="NewmanPrincipe2002p37"&gt;{{Harvnb|Newman|Principe|2002|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PrincipeNewmanp386"&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1740s, "alchemy" was now restricted to the realm of gold making, leading to the popular belief that alchemists were charlatans, and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud.&lt;ref name="Alchemy Restored" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PrincipeNewmanp386" /&gt; In order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure of which alchemy was being subjected, academic writers during the scientific Enlightenment attempted, for the sake of survival, to divorce and separate the "new" chemistry from the "old" practices of alchemy. This move was mostly successful, and the consequences of this continued into the 19th and 20th centuries, and even to the present day.&lt;ref name="PrincipeNewmanpp386–7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|pp=386–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the occult revival of the early 19th century, alchemy received new attention as an occult science.&lt;ref name="PrincipeNewmanp387"&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KripalShuck2005p27"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kripal|Shuck|2005|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The esoteric or occultist school, which arose during the 19th century, held (and continues to hold) the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense, and it downplays the role of the alchemy as a practical tradition or protoscience.&lt;ref name="NewmanPrincipe2002p37" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eliade|1994|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PrincipeNewmanp388"&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation further forwarded the view that alchemy is an art primarily concerned with spiritual enlightenment or illumination, as opposed to the physical manipulation of apparatus and chemicals, and claims that the obscure language of the alchemical texts were an allegorical guise for spiritual, moral or mystical processes.&lt;ref name="PrincipeNewmanp388" /&gt;

In the 19th-century revival of alchemy, the two most seminal figures were [[Mary Anne Atwood]] and [[Ethan A. Hitchcock (general)|Ethan Allen Hitchcock]], who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy. Both forwarded a completely esoteric view of alchemy, as Atwood claimed: "No modern art or chemistry, notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims, has any thing in common with Alchemy."&lt;ref name="PrincipeNewmanp391"&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rutkin2001p143"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rutkin|2001|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atwood's work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including [[Eliphas Levi]], [[Arthur Edward Waite]], and [[Rudolf Steiner]]. Hitchcock, in his ''Remarks Upon Alchymists'' (1855) attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state. In 1845, Baron [[Carl Reichenbach]], published his studies on [[Odic force]], a concept with some similarities to alchemy, but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Merkur. ''Gnosis: An Esoteric Tradition of Mystical Visions and Unions.'' SUNY Press. 1993 p.55&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women in alchemy ===

Several women appear in the earliest history of alchemy. [[Michael Maier]] names [[Mary the Jewess]], [[Cleopatra the Alchemist]], [[Medera]], and [[Taphnutia]] as the four women who knew how to make the philosopher's stone.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Patai. ''The Jewish Alchemists: A History and Source Book.'' p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Zosimos' sister Theosebia (later known as Euthica the Arab) and [[Isis the Prophetess]] also played a role in early alchemical texts.

The first alchemist whose name we know is said to have been [[Mary the Jewess]] (c. 200 A.D.).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women in Chemistry: Their Changing Roles from Alchemical Times to the Mid-Twentieth Century|author1=Rayner-Canham, M  |author2=Rayner-Canham, G|publisher=Chemical Heritage Foundation|year=2005|isbn=9780941901277|location=|pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early sources claim that Mary (or Maria) devised a number of improvements to alchemical equipment and tools as well as novel techniques in chemistry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her best known advances were in heating and distillation processes. The laboratory water-bath, known eponymously (especially in France) as the [[bain-marie]], is said to have been invented or at least improved by her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jewish Alchemists: A History and Source Book|last=Patai|first=R|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995|isbn=9780691006420|location=|pages=60–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially a double-boiler, it was (and is) used in chemistry for processes that require gentle heating. The tribikos (a modified distillation apparatus) and the kerotakis (a more intricate apparatus used especially for sublimations) are two other advancements in the process of distillation that are credited to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The origins of alchemy in Graeco-Roman Egypt|last=Lindsay|first=J|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|year=1970|isbn=9780389010067|location=New York|pages=240–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; The occasional claim that Mary was the first to discover hydrochloric acid is not accepted by most authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1094-alchemy#anchor2|title=Alchemy|last=Gaster|first=Moses|date=2011|website=Jewish Encyclopedia|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company|access-date=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although we have no writing from Mary herself, she is known from the early-fourth-century writings of [[Zosimos of Panopolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jewish Alchemists: A History and Source Book|last=Patai|first=R|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1994|isbn=9780691006420|location=|pages=81–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the proliferation of [[pseudepigrapha]] and anonymous works, it is difficult to know which of the alchemists were actually women. After the Greco-Roman period, women's names appear less frequently in the alchemical literature. Women vacate the history of alchemy during the medieval and renaissance periods, aside from the fictitious account of [[Perenelle Flamel]]. [[Mary Anne Atwood]]'s ''A Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery'' (1850) marks their return during the nineteenth-century occult revival.

=== Modern historical research ===
The history of alchemy has become a significant and recognized subject of academic study.&lt;ref name="Antoine Faivre 1995. p.viii–xv"&gt;Antoine Faivre, Wouter J. Hanegraaff. ''Western esotericism and the science of religion.'' 1995. p.viii–xvi&lt;/ref&gt;   As the language of the alchemists is analyzed, historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of Western cultural history, such as the evolution of science and [[philosophy]], the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities, [[Kabbalah|kabbalism]], [[spiritualism]], [[Rosicrucianism]], and other mystic movements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://centres.exeter.ac.uk/exeseso/ See Exeter Centre for the Study of Esotericism website]&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions involved in this research include The Chymistry of Isaac Newton project at [[Indiana University]], the [[University of Exeter]] Centre for the Study of Esotericism (EXESESO), the [[European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism]] (ESSWE), and the [[University of Amsterdam]]'s Sub-department for the History of Hermetic Philosophy and Related Currents. A large collection of books on alchemy is kept in the [[Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica]] in Amsterdam. A recipe found in a mid-19th-century kabbalah based book features step by step instructions on turning copper into gold. The author attributed this recipe to an ancient manuscript he located.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishnews.com/2015/09/27/old-jewish-book-outlines-how-to-turn-copper-into-gold|title=Old Jewish Book Outlines how to Turn Copper into Gold|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journals which publish regularly on the topic of Alchemy include '[[Ambix]]', published by the Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry, and '[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]', published by The History of Science Society.

== Core concepts ==
[[File:Fotothek df tg 0006104 Theosophie ^ Alchemie ^ Judentum ^ Kabbala.jpg|thumb|Mandala illustrating common alchemical concepts, symbols, and processes. From ''Spiegel der Kunst und Natur''.]]
Western alchemical theory corresponds to the worldview of late antiquity in which it was born. Concepts were imported from [[Neoplatonism]] and earlier Greek [[cosmology]]. As such, the [[Classical elements]] appear in alchemical writings, as do the seven [[Classical planets]] and the corresponding seven [[metals of antiquity]]. Similarly, the gods of the Roman pantheon who are associated with these luminaries are discussed in alchemical literature. The concepts of [[prima materia]] and [[anima mundi]] are central to the theory of the [[philosopher's stone]].

=== Hermeticism ===
{{Hermeticism}}
In the eyes of a variety of esoteric and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] practitioners, alchemy is fundamentally spiritual. Transmutation of lead into gold is presented as an analogy for personal transmutation, purification, and perfection.&lt;ref name="Antoine Faivre 1995. p.96"&gt;Antoine Faivre, Wouter J. Hanegraaff. ''Western esotericism and the science of religion.'' 1995. p.96&lt;/ref&gt; The writings attributed to [[Hermes Trismegistus]] are a primary source of alchemical theory. He is named "alchemy's founder and chief patron, authority, inspiration and guide".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Linden|2003|pp=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early alchemists, such as [[Zosimos of Panopolis]] (c. AD 300), highlight the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest, symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul.&lt;ref&gt;Allen G. Debus. ''Alchemy and early modern chemistry.'' The Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry. p.34.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach continued in the Middle Ages, as metaphysical aspects, substances, physical states, and material processes were used as metaphors for [[spirit]]ual entities, spiritual states, and, ultimately, transformation. In this sense, the literal meanings of 'Alchemical Formulas' were a blind, hiding their true [[spiritual philosophy]]. Practitioners and patrons such as [[Melchior Cibinensis]] and [[Pope Innocent VIII]] existed within the ranks of the church, while [[Martin Luther]] applauded alchemy for its consistency with Christian teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Patai. ''The Jewish Alchemists: A History and Source Book.'' Princeton University Press. p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect, diseased, corruptible, and ephemeral state toward a perfect, healthy, incorruptible, and everlasting state, so the philosopher's stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible. Applied to the alchemist himself, the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment, and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal. In texts that are written according to this view, the cryptic [[alchemical symbol]]s, diagrams, and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings, allegories, and references to other equally cryptic works; and must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning.

In his 1766 ''Alchemical Catechism'', Théodore Henri de Tschudi denotes that the usage of the metals was merely symbolic:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Q. When the Philosophers speak of gold and silver, from which they extract their matter, are we to suppose that they refer to the vulgar gold and silver?
A. By no means; vulgar silver and gold are dead, while those of the Philosophers are full of life.&lt;ref&gt;Théodore Henri de Tschudi. Hermetic Catechism in his ''L'Etoile Flamboyant ou la Société des Franc-Maçons considerée sous tous les aspects.'' 1766.  (A.E. Waite translation as found in ''The Hermetic and Alchemical Writings of Paracelsus.'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The Great Work of Alchemy is often described as a series of four stages represented by colors.

*''[[nigredo]]'', a blackening or melanosis
*''[[Albedo (alchemy)|albedo]]'', a whitening or leucosis
*''[[citrinitas]]'', a yellowing or xanthosis
*''[[rubedo]]'', a reddening, purpling, or iosis&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Needham. ''Science &amp; Civilisation in China: Chemistry and chemical technology. Spagyrical discovery and invention: magisteries of gold and immortality.'' Cambridge. 1974. p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern alchemy ==
Due to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature, and the 18th-century disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry; the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those focusing on the exoteric, such as historians of science [[Lawrence M. Principe]] and [[William R. Newman]], have interpreted the 'decknamen' (or code words) of alchemy as physical substances. These scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Conniff. "Alchemy May Not Have Been the Pseudoscience We All Thought It Was." [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/alchemy-may-not-been-pseudoscience-we-thought-it-was-180949430/#ixzz2sYcrpZl7 Smithsonian Magazine.] February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the opposite end of the spectrum, focusing on the esoteric, scholars, such as George Calian&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last= Calian |first= George |title= Alkimia Operativa and Alkimia Speculativa. Some Modern Controversies on the Historiography of Alchemy |publisher= Annual of Medieval Studies at CEU |year= 2010 |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |bibcode= |asin= |jfm= |jstor= |lccn= |mr= |ol= |osti= |rfc= |ssrn= |zbl= |url= https://archive.org/stream/AlkimiaOperativaAndAlkimiaSpeculativa.SomeModernControversiesOnThe/FlorinGeorgeCalian-AlkimiaOperativaAndAlkimiaSpeculativa.SomeModernControversiesOnTheHistoriographyOfAlchemy#page/n0/mode/2up |accessdate= |ref= harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Anna Marie Roos,&lt;ref&gt;Anna Marie Roos (2013), Review of ''The Secrets of Alchemy'',  [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001143 ''Studies in History and Philosophy of Science'' '''44''']&lt;/ref&gt; who question the reading of Principe and Newman, interpret these same decknamen as spiritual, religious, or psychological concepts.

Today new interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated, sometimes merging in concepts from [[New Age]] or radical environmentalism movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups like the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucians]] and [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] have a continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism. Since the Victorian revival of alchemy, "occultists reinterpreted alchemy as a spiritual practice, involving the self-transformation of the practitioner and only incidentally or not at all the transformation of laboratory substances",&lt;ref name="Alchemy Restored" /&gt; which has contributed to a merger of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and alchemy in popular thought.

=== Traditional medicine ===
{{Main|Ayurveda|Traditional Chinese medicine}}
Traditional medicine can use the concept of the transmutation of natural substances, using pharmacological or a combination of pharmacological and spiritual techniques. In [[Ayurveda]], the [[Samskara (Ayurvedic)|samskaras]] are claimed to transform [[heavy metals]] and toxic herbs in a way that removes their toxicity. These processes are actively used to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Junius, Manfred M; ''The Practical Handbook of Plant Alchemy: An Herbalist's Guide to Preparing Medicinal Essences, Tinctures, and Elixirs''; Healing Arts Press 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Spagyrists of the 20th century, [[Frater Albertus|Albert Richard Riedel]] and Jean Dubuis, merged Paracelsian alchemy with occultism, teaching laboratory pharmaceutical methods. The schools they founded, ''Les Philosophes de la Nature'' and ''The Paracelsus Research Society'', popularized modern spagyrics including the manufacture of herbal tinctures and products.&lt;ref&gt;Joscelyn Godwin.  ''The Golden Thread: The Ageless Wisdom of the Western Mystery Traditions.'' Quest Books, 2007. p.120&lt;/ref&gt; The courses, books, organizations, and conferences generated by their students continue to influence popular applications of alchemy as a New Age medicinal practice.

=== Psychology ===
Alchemical symbolism has been important in depth and analytical psychology and was revived and popularized from near extinction by the Swiss psychologist [[Carl Jung|Carl Gustav Jung]]. Initially confounded and at odds with alchemy and its images, after being given a copy of the translation of ''The Secret of the Golden Flower'', a Chinese alchemical text, by his friend Richard Wilhelm, Jung discovered a direct correlation or parallels between the symbolic images in the alchemical drawings and the inner, symbolic images coming up in dreams, visions or imaginations during the psychic processes of transformation occurring in his patients. A process, which he called "process of individuation". He regarded the alchemical images as symbols expressing aspects of this "process of [[individuation]]" of which the creation of the gold or lapis within were symbols for its origin and goal.&lt;ref name="Jung, C. G. 1944"&gt;Jung, C. G. (1944). Psychology and Alchemy (2nd ed. 1968 Collected Works Vol. 12 {{ISBN|0-691-01831-6}}). London: Routledge. E.g. §41, §116, §427, §431, §448.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polly Young-Eisendrath, Terence Dawson. ''The Cambridge companion to Jung.'' Cambridge University Press. 1997. p.33"/&gt; Together with his alchemical ''mystica soror'', Jungian Swiss analyst [[Marie-Louise von Franz]], Jung began collecting all the old alchemical texts available, compiled a lexicon of key phrases with cross-references&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Stevens: ''On Jung.'' (A new and authoritiative introduction to Jung's life and thought), Penguin Books, London 1990, {{ISBN|0140124942}}, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; and pored over them. The volumes of work he wrote brought new light into understanding the art of transubstantiation and renewed alchemy's popularity as a symbolic process of coming into wholeness as a human being where opposites brought into contact and inner and outer, spirit and matter are reunited in the ''[[hieros gamos]]''  or divine marriage. His writings are influential in psychology and for persons who have an interest in understanding the importance of dreams, symbols and the unconscious archetypal forces ([[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]])&lt;ref name="Polly Young-Eisendrath, Terence Dawson. ''The Cambridge companion to Jung.'' Cambridge University Press. 1997. p.33"&gt;Polly Young-Eisendrath, Terence Dawson. ''The Cambridge companion to Jung.'' Cambridge University Press. 1997. p.33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.G. Jung Preface to [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]]'s translation of the [[I Ching]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.-G. Jung Preface to the translation of [[Secret of the Golden Flower|The Secret of The Golden Flower]].&lt;/ref&gt; that influence all of life.

Both von Franz and Jung have contributed greatly to the subject and work of alchemy and its continued presence in psychology as well as contemporary culture. Jung wrote volumes on alchemy and his magnum opus is Volume 14 of his Collected Works, ''[[Mysterium Coniunctionis|Mysterium Conuinctionis]].''

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Alchemy in art and entertainment}}
Alchemy has had a long-standing relationship with art, seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment. ''Literary alchemy'' appears throughout the history of English literature from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] to [[J. K. Rowling]], and also the popular Japanese manga [[Full Metal Alchemist]]. Here, characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus. In the 14th century, Chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of Terry Pratchett.

Visual artists had a similar relationship with alchemy. While some of them used alchemy as a source of satire, others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work. Music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers. In the last hundred years, alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction, film, television, novels, comics and video games.

The '''American Bar Foundation''' ('''ABF''') is an independent, [[nonprofit]] national [[research institute]] established in 1952 and located in [[Chicago]]. It conducts objective [[empirical]] research on [[law]] and legal institutions. This program of sociolegal research is conducted by an interdisciplinary staff of Research Faculty trained in such diverse fields as [[law]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[political science]], [[economics]], [[history]], and [[anthropology]].  

The ABF was initially located in [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] on the [[University of Chicago]] campus. It subsequently moved to the American Bar Association building in [[downtown Chicago]], and remained there after the ABA departed, now sharing the building with part of the [[Northwestern University]] downtown professional schools.  The most recent directors (beginning in the 1970s) of the ABF were Spencer L. Kimball (also a professor of law at the [[University of Chicago]] and a former dean of the [[University of Wisconsin Law School]]), John P. Heinz (professor at [[Northwestern University School of Law]]), [[Bill Felstiner|William "Bill" Felstiner]], Bryant Garth (now dean of [[Southwestern Law School]]),  Robert Nelson (also a professor in the Department of Sociology, Northwestern University and MacCrate Research Chair in the Legal Professions at the ABF), and current director Ajay Mehrotra (also a professor of law at Northwestern University School of Law).

The American Bar Foundation Research Faculty produces ''[[Law and Social Inquiry]]'' (LSI), a peer-reviewed academic journal that publishes empirical research about law, legal institutions, and legal processes.  LSI currently is published by [[Wiley-Blackwell]].

The American Bar Foundation is a resource for [[lawyers]], [[scholars]], and policy makers who seek analyses of the theory and functioning of law, legal institutions, and the legal profession. The Foundation's work is supported by the American Bar Endowment, by The Fellows of the American Bar Foundation, and by grants for particular research projects from private foundations and government agencies.

'''Audicom''' (from “'''Audi'''o en '''com'''putadora”, Spanish for “Audio in computer”), released in 1989, was the world's first [[personal computer|PC]]-based [[broadcast automation]] system to use [[audio compression (data)|audio data compression]] technology based on [[psychoacoustics]].

The audio card was designed with standard [[CMOS logic]] [[Integrated circuit|ICs]] and used hardware to perform an audio data compression algorithm named ECAM,  based on the critical bands masking principle, a property of the human ear. Today the same principle is used in all major [[lossy audio compression]] [[Audio codec|codecs]]. The audio card was plugged into an [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA slot]] of the PC and worked using [[direct memory access]] to the host memory. The driver and the client application were developed by Gustavo Pesci,&lt;ref name="solidyne4"&gt;[http://www.gustavopesci.com Gustavo Pesci Bio]&lt;/ref&gt; while the hardware was designed by Ricardo Sidoti and Elio Demaria.&lt;ref name="solidyne5"&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/187775-la-historia-de-un-pionero-del-audio-digital La historia del Audicom]&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all the radio stations in the world today are using some similar technology, now manufactured by a lot of companies around the world.&lt;ref name="solidyne3"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zD9WAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=solidyne+audicom&amp;dq=solidyne+audicom&amp;pgis=1 Audicom introduced at LAB]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Audicom's software versions==
[[File:Audicom66.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Solidyne's Audicom 6.6 running on Windows XP]]
Audicom (mid-1980s): first version, included a hardware compression audio card: ADX903

Audicom II (1989): most popular version for DOS systems, exported to more than 30 countries. Introduced the concept of [[Playlist]] for computer systems, and created the concept of [[Live Assist]]. When working in automatic mode, the music was selected from several directories with the /RANDOM command allowing the rotate styles along the day.

Audicom III &amp; 4: not released, but developed internally. Audicom 4 was the first version intended to be a Windows version (for 16 bit Windows), but due to problems in the Win16 platform it was canceled in favor of a Win32 system (Audicom 5). The change (including staff change) caused a delay to the project of two years.

Audicom 5 (Introduced at CAPER 96, commercially available at 1997): first Windows system available. There were two versions (both Win32 applications): ECAM and multimedia. The multimedia version included the option of an 'audio co-processor card' (a compressor-expanser for greater dynamic range with conventional sound cards). New ECAM cards allowd to perform the mixing on the same card. Multimedia version used two cards for mixing and 3 cards for mix and cue (which was pretty hard to install on a same PC). The Audicom 5 introduced a novel concept of [[Artificial intelligence]] for selecting music called [[AutoDJ]], which allowed for '1 second precision' to meet the spots schedule on real time (the operator can add or remove titles and the autoDJ will meet the schedule without cut any music). Other novelty was the virtual locator, which announces weather condition and time (based on a text to speech algorithm). A weather station was available as optional (SMT-100).

Audicom 6 (October 2000): Only a multimedia version. It introduced a new play engine based on DirectX, allowing mixing on the same audio card. First broadcasting audio system to support [[MP3]], allowing cross-fade within two different MP3 files and CUE concurrently (all software decoding). The product was partnered with the PCI audio card [[SX46]].

Audicom 7 (August 2002): Included multiuser support, network ready, included autoEdit (automatic editing of MP3's files without recompressing), full MP3 mixing. Also was partnered with an advanced PCI audio card: [[DSP48]].

==Modern systems for radio automation ==
In 1983 Oscar Bonello a radio automation pioneer, and Engineering professor at the University of Buenos Aires and [[Fellow#Learned or professional societies, or speciality training|Fellow]] of the AES (USA) start researching about using the recently developed IBM PC computer. The problems that he faced were: 1) Create an audio PC card of good audio quality; 2) Create a bit compression algorithm; 3) Create the Automation software to be run from the PC.&lt;ref name="solidyne2"&gt;[http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2384 New Improvements in Audio Signal Processing for AM Broadcasting by Bonello, Oscar]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The audio card was designed with standard CMOS logic ICs and perform by hardware the ECAM bit compression algorithm based on the principle of Critical Bands Masking a property of the ear (see a brief History at MP3 ). Today the same principle as the one used by Bonello is used in all the lossy audio bit compression systems, included MP3. The audio card was designed for the old ISA slots of the PC and works using direct access to PC memory. The driver for this software was developed by Gustavo Pesci, a young software engineer, formerly a pupil of Bonello at University. The card hardware was designed for Ricardo Sidoti and Elio Demaria, both brilliant electronic engineers.

The Radio Automation system was launched in 1987 under the name Audicom The software initially ran on DOS and was further changed by Sebastian Ledesma to Windows, using an Artificial Intelligence concept. Twenty years after the original Bonello invention, almost all the radio stations at the world use the same technology, now manufactured by various companies around the world. Mr Bonello refuses to apply for any type of invention patent. 

Modern systems typically run on [[hard disk]], where all of the [[music]], [[jingle]]s, [[advertisement]]s, [[voice track]]s and other announcements are stored. These [[computer file]]s may be either [[data compression|compressed]] or uncompressed,  often with a minimal compression as a [[compromise]].

[[Scheduling (broadcasting)|Scheduling]] was an important advance of these systems—allowing for exact timing. Some systems use [[GPS]] [[satellite]] [[receiver (radio)|receivers]] to obtain exact [[atomic time]], for perfect [[synchronization]] with [[communications satellite|satellite-delivered]] [[Radio programming|programming]].
	 
Automation systems are now more [[interactive]] than ever with [[Digital data|digital]] [[mixing console]]s and can even [[Sound recording and reproduction|record]] from a [[telephone hybrid]] to play back an edited [[conversation]] with a [[telephone call]]er.

The simplest arrangements can even be done on [[software]] as basic as [[Winamp]].

There is also a trend in radio to use [[voice-tracking]] production techniques which make the live presenter in the studio, less critical in the overall broadcast; a great number of [[Internet radio]] and [[variety hits]] stations use automation software and voice-tracking to completely replace live on-air talent

==PC cards==
The Audicom cards are a family of PC audio cards developed by Solidyne. They were intended to the broadcasting market and some models included the Audicom broadcasting system. 
[[File:ADX922 audio card.JPG|thumb|450px|center|Solidyne's PC card model ADX922]]

In the mid-1980s Solidyne, a broadcast manufacturer company, started the project of recording audio in a PC to automate the spots emission (at that time done by cartridges). By that time, the hard disk were very expensive and extremely small (a PC hard drive allowed 10MBytes of storage), so the engineers knew that they needed to develop a system to reduce the required bits as much as possible in order to be successful. The result was the ECAM audio system, the first system was shown to the 'Secretaria de Ciencia y Tecnica de la Nacion de la Republica Argentina' in 1988.&lt;ref name="solidney1"&gt;[http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=6674 PC-Controlled Psychoacoustic Audio Processor by Bonello, Oscar Juan]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Austral University of Chile''' ({{lang-es|Universidad Austral de Chile}} or UACh) is a [[research university]] in [[Chile]] based in [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]] although it has some institutions and programs in [[Puerto Montt]]. Founded by decree on 7 September 1954 it is one of the eight original [[Chilean Traditional Universities]]. Juridically it is a [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] self-owned [[corporation]] under [[private law]] and is significantly [[Subsidy|state-financed]].

==History==

===Foundation and early years (1942-1968)===
The history of UACh dates back to 1942 when a society called ''Sociedad de Amigos del Arte'' was formed in the city of Valdivia to promote culture. One of the society's main goals was the establishment of a university in the city.  The idea of creating a university was presented to the national congress in the 1950s by the [[Senate of Chile|senator]] for Valdivia, Carlos Acharán Pérez de Arce, who later succeeded in consolidating the project. In a meeting held on 16 February 1954 supporters of installing a university created a directory and proclaimed [[Eduardo Morales Miranda]] as president of it.  The initial founding depended on donations from private persons including some industrial businessmen. After have been founded by decree on 7 September 1954 the university was [[inauguration|inaugurated]] on 12 March 1955 by president [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]]. The inauguration was also attended by the rectors of the [[University of Chile]] and the States Technical University as well as the ambassadors of [[Venezuela]] and [[Argentina]] and representatives of the Netherlands, Germany and the United States.

The first degree programmes to be taught at the university were [[fine art]]s, [[agronomy]], [[forestry|forestry engineering]] and [[veterinary medicine]], each of which had also its own faculty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uach.cl/historia.php Historia de la Universidad Austral de Chile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130030424/http://www.uach.cl/historia.php |date=January 30, 2009 }} Austral University of Chile&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3 of 1968 UACh was granted autonomy from the University of Chile as law 16.848 was enacted. The autonomy did that UACh became allowed to decide its own plans and study programs and put the university out of the tutelage of the University of Chile.

===Development (1969-1999)===
[[Image:Casas UACh.JPG|240px|thumb|right|Picture of one of the "A"-houses of Universidad Austral near [[Valdivia River]] in [[Isla Teja]] Campus]]
During the [[Chile under Pinochet|military regime's]] privatization of higher education in the 1980s UACh incorporated the successor regional see of ''Universidad Técnica del Estado'', the ''Instituto Profesional de Valdivia''. By doing this, UACh prevented an offshoot university from being created there as it happened around the country with regional sees of major universities. With the incorporation of ''Instituto Profesional de Valdivia'', that corresponds to present day 'Campus Miraflores, UACh started to grant [[bachelor degree]]s in engineering and got its Engineering Faculty.

In 1993 the university held the [[Valdivia International Film Festival]] for the first time to celebrate the 30th anniversary of its cinema Cine Club which has since then developed to one of the most important film festivals in Chile.

===Recent history (2000-present)===
With the arrival of [[Centro de Estudios Científicos]] (CECS) to Valdivia in 2000 the city was further outlined as a research center, as CECS brought expertise on [[biophysics]], [[molecular physiology]], [[theoretical physics]], [[glaciology]] and [[climate change]] to the city. The arrival of CECS was seen as positive by UACh's administration since CECS research do not overlap UACh's main research areas and, as a scientific research corporation, do not compete in student enrollment. However, in 2007 UACh and CECS got involved in a controversy when the Regional Council of [[Los Lagos Region]] granted regional funds that had been put into [[Call for bids|tender]] to CECS without attending to the meeting where UACh's and [[University of Los Lagos]] joint project was presented. Deputy [[Gabriel Ascencio]] ([[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|DC]]) accused [[Claudio Bunster]], director of CECS, of using his personal influence among politicians and the Council of Innovation for Competitiveness (of which he is member of) to gain more resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Es icon}} [http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias/site/artic/20070512/pags/20070512224215.html "http://www.lannacion.cl"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927012424/http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias/site/artic/20070512/pags/20070512224215.html |date=2007-09-27 }} ''[[La Nación (Santiago)|La Nación]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday 3 December 2007 the  Emilio Pugín building of the Faculty of Sciences caught fire. The building, located on [[Teja island]] Campus housed considerable amounts of chemicals and scientific equipment which could not be saved. Several research projects had to be halted or aborted due to loss of equipment, samples and data. Due to the spreading of toxic smoke the  police had to evacuate a total of 10,000 people from Isla Teja. Firefighting companies from the neighboring cities of [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]], [[La Unión, Chile|La Unión]] and [[Paillaco]] had to come to assist to control and extinguish the fire. The building hosted the institutes of chemistry, physics, zoology, microbiology and botanics, including some laboratories. The cost of the damage was estimated at about 5000 million [[Chilean peso]]s (about 10 million US dollars).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elnaveghable.cl/admin/render/noticia/12467 Incendio en Universidad Austral de Chile], ''[[El Naveghable]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, 22% of the damage were not covered by the according insurances, but [[Subsidy|directly financed]] by the [[Chilean government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uach.cl/organizacion/rectoria/noticia.php?codigo%3D8427 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728100459/http://www.uach.cl/organizacion/rectoria/noticia.php?codigo=8427 |archivedate=2011-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 13 of 2008 the [[student federation]] of UACh decided to go on [[Student strike|strike]] since they considered that a request list sent to the university administration was answered in too loose terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elnaveghable.cl/admin/render/noticia/14307 ¡A la calle!: a los estudiantes de la UACh se les acabó la paciencia], [[El Naveghable]]&lt;/ref&gt; The strike and occupation of the university by students ended in late June when the rector Victor Cubillos and the directory ceded on several points but was however still heavily criticized both from students and from sectors of the [[teacher|faculty]] where they considered that he had ceded too much to students. On April 2010 the reconstruction of the Emilio Pugin building of the Sciencie Faculty, started the competitive bidding. And in this year it would start the reconstruction. Cubillos won the 2010 election with 229 votes, 13 less than the prior election. the second term ended in June 2014.

==Campus==

UACh main campus, Isla Teja Campus, occupies the whole northwest of [[Isla Teja]] in Valdivia. Campus Isla Teja is the home of UACh's administration, [[Cine Club]], [[botanical garden]] and most faculties. The botanical garden is a recreational area as well as a place of study with a total of around 950 plant species growing in its 12 [[hectare|ha]].&lt;ref name=jardin&gt;[http://www.ciencias.uach.cl/unidades/jardin-botanico.php Jardín Botánico] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315061756/http://www.ciencias.uach.cl/unidades/jardin-botanico.php |date=2012-03-15 }}. Revised on April 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Most plants in the botanical garden belong to [[Valdivian temperate rain forest]] but there are others with exotic origins. The waters of [[Cau-Cau River]] that flows through the northern parts of the botanical garden allows a section of wetland plant species included in the garden.

The engineering faculty operates in Campus Miraflores located along [[Valdivia River]] south of Valdivia's [[Valdivia, Chile|Plaza de Armas]]. A third campus exists in [[Puerto Montt]] where [[administration (business)|business administration]], [[speech and language pathology]] and [[aquaculture]] are studied.  UACh has apart from the campuses several properties spread through [[Los Ríos Region|Los Ríos]] and [[Los Lagos Region]] such as Parque [[Arboretum]] in northern Isla Teja, the Calfuco field station in the coast near [[Niebla, Chile|Niebla]] and the [[Valdivian temperate rainforest|forests of San Pablo de Tregua]] in the Andean foothills.

==Research==
[[Image:Sanpablotregua.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Faculty of UACh in the forests of San Pablo de Tregua]]
UACh is one of the leading universities of Chile in matters of scientific research. It was ranked second only to the University of Chile in scientific research by ''[[El Mercurio]]'' and was the third university to receive most of government ''Mecesup'' research funds in 2008.&lt;ref name=emol/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universia.cl/portada/actualidad/noticia_actualidad.jsp?noticia=143845 Universidad Austral de Chile se adjudica 1.582 millones en el Concurso Mecesup 2008]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Universia&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the fields where UACh scientists have made contributions include:

*'''Archaeology:''' In [[archeology]] university scientists [[Mario Pino Quivira|Mario Pino]] and [[Tom Dillehay]], led the excavations of at [[Monte Verde]], one of the earliest [[archaeological site]]s in the Americas. Another site investigated by university scientists is [[Chan-Chan]] a site that gives name to the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] [[Chan-Chan|Chan-Chan Complex]].&lt;ref name=pino&gt;{{es icon}} [[Mario Pino Quivira|Pino, Mario]] and Navarro, Rayen.

''[[Andean Geology|Revista Geológica de Chile]]'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Dairy technology and science:''' The university's ''Centro Tecnológico de la Leche'' (lit. Milk Technology Centre) have been credited by scholar Paulina Rytkönen for being behind the higher dairy productivity in [[Los Ríos Region]] when compared with adjacent [[Los Lagos Region]].&lt;ref&gt;Rytkönen, P. Fruits of Capitalism: Modernization of Chilean Agriculture, 1950-2000. ''Lund Studies in Economic History'', 31, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Dendrochronology:''' Scientists at the [[Dendrochronology]] Laboratory of UACh has set up the longest dendrochronology in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] going back 5666 years. Researchers have also reconstructed the temperatures of the last 3622 years with [[tree ring]]s from [[Fitzroya]] and have used  a dendrochronology network of [[Lenga Beech]], spanning from [[Talca]] to [[Navarino Island]], to investigate [[global warming]] in the recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dendrocronologia.cl/lab_quienes.html ¿Quiénes somos?] Laboratorio de Dendrocronología&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Mapudungun language:''' UACh is one of the main sites of [[Mapudungun language|Mapudungun linguistic]] studies and teaching. This is partly due to Professor [[María Catrileo Chiguailaf]], who received in 2009 the ''Provincial Prize for Conservation of National Monuments'' for her studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uach.cl/rrpp/online/ver.php?not=2124 Académica de la Universidad Austral de Chile Recibió Premio Provincial de Conservación de Monumentos Nacionales]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Noticias UACh&lt;/ref&gt; Her work has focused on the [[phonology]] and morpho-[[syntax]] of the Mapudungun language and especially the [[verb form]]s. Catrileo may be the only living [[Mapuche]] to have mastered Spanish, English, and Mapudungun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/36/3c/eb.pdf María Catrileo's Works on the Tagmemics of Mapuche]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Palaeontology:''' [[paleontology|Palaeontological]] studies at [[Southern Chile]] have involved several UACh academics among them [[geoarchaeology|geoarchaeologist]] [[Mario Pino Quivido|Mario Pino]] who participated at the excavation of the [[Quaternary]] fossil site of [[Pilauco Bajo]] in [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]] where the remains of a species of ''[[Gomphotherium]]'' were discovered. Two other ''Gomphotherium'' fossil sites in [[Los Ríos Region]] are planned to be excavated by university scientists in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uach.cl/rrpp/online/ver.php?not=12419 Presentaron Libro sobre Sitio Paleontológico Pilauco Bajo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203234657/http://www.uach.cl/rrpp/online/ver.php?not=12419 |date=December 3, 2008 }} Noticias UACh&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Virology:''' Researchers from the Faculty of Medicine and Faculty of Science led a series of joint medical, [[virus|viral]] and [[zoological]] research on the transmittance of [[Hantavirus]] between [[rodent]]s and humans. Hantavirus was first detected in Chile in 1995 but is believed to have been present much time before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0034-98872003000200006&amp;script=sci_arttext Síndrome pulmonar por Hantavirus] Revista médica de Chile&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dr. Luis Zaror the most important UACh discovery regarding Hantavirus was made in 2005 when Hanta [[antigen]]s were found on the [[salivary gland]]s of deceased persons. UACh academics working at the Laboratory of [[Virology]] had contributed to diminish the initial [[Mortality rate|mortality]] of [[Hantavirus|Pulmonar Hantavirus]] with 60% in [[Los Ríos Region]] below the national average of 37%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universia.cl/portada/actualidad/noticia_actualidad.jsp?noticia=128553 Universidad Austral de Chile: Una década de vanguardia académica e investigación]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Universia&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific journals===
The university publishes several [[scientific journal]]s three of them, ''[[Bosque (journal)|Bosque]]'', ''[[Archivos de Medicina Veterinaria]]'' and ''[[Estudios filológicos]]'' are part of [[Institute for Scientific Information|ISI]]'s [[bibliographic database]]. ''BOSQUE'' is published by the Faculty of Forest Science. ''BOSQUE's'' first number was published in 1975 and was yearly issued until 1985. From 1985 to 2003 it was issued twice a year and from 2003 on thrice a year. The topics covered in ''BOSQUE'' are management and production of forestry resources, wood science and technology, [[silviculture]], [[forest ecology|forestry ecology]], natural resources conservation, and [[rural development]] associated with forest ecosystems. Contributions are articles, notes and opinions, both in Spanish and English. ''BOSQUE'' became part of ISI's bibliographic database in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universia.cl/portada/actualidad/noticia_actualidad.jsp?noticia=145321 Celebran indexación de publicación de la Universidad Austral de Chile en ISI]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Universia&lt;/ref&gt;

In matters of literature, [[Communication sciences|communication science]] and [[linguistics]] the university has published the journal ''Documentos Lingüísticos y Literarios'' (DLL) since 1977. ''Documentos Lingüísticos y Literarios'' has two sections, one dedicated to articles and comments on literature, linguistics and communication science and another were original literary pieces are published. DLL is one of the few journals containing native [[Mapudungun]] literature and linguistic articles.

== Museum network ==
Universidad Austral de Chile runs through its [[museology]] department several museums in Valdivia and southern Chile, including; [[Museo de Arte Contemporaneo|UACh's Contemporary Art Museum]], [[Museo de la Exploración Rudolph Amandus Philippi|Philippi Museum]] on the 19th century exploration and settlement of southern Chile and [[Museo Histórico y Antropológico Maurice van de Maele|Maurice van de Maele Museum]] on history and anthropology. The museology department has collections of indigenous artifacts including early indigenous ceramics as well as [[Mapuche silverwork]] and textiles. In addition to this there is a collection of objects from the early human settlement of [[Monte Verde]]. Other collections include 19th century clothing and toys and an extensive photographical archive dating back to 1850.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uach.cl/direccion/museologica/c_archfoto.htm Dirección Museológica UACh] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728100553/http://www.uach.cl/direccion/museologica/c_archfoto.htm |date=July 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rankings==
[[image:UACh-Centro de Educación Continua-noche.JPG|thumb|190px|Centro de Educación continua building in downtown Valdivia]]
In a 2011 university ranking of [[Quacquarelli Symonds]] the Austral University of Chile was ranked 30th among Latin American universities, 5th among Chilean universities and second among Chilean universities outside Santiago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/latin-american-university-rankings/2011 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[El Mercurio]]'''s 2006 ranking of the "Best Universities in the Country", UACh received the highest score in "teaching quality" of any Chilean university.  The same article also listed UACh second only to [[Universidad de Chile]] in research quality, and ranked the Valdivia-based university third place overall among Chilean universities.  As both universities that earned higher rankings are located in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] (U. de Chile and [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]]), UACh thus became the highest ranking university in Chile outside of the nation's capital.&lt;ref name=emol&gt;[http://www.emol.com/especiales/infografias/ranking_universidad/index.htm# El Mercurio Ranking of Universities]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most recent Chilean university ranking released by AméricaEconomía magazine, released in 2009, UACh earned an overall ranking of 7th place, and 4th among universities outside Santiago. In the undergraduate ranking, nursing performed best with 3rd place, then medicine and agronomy at 4th place, then law at 7th place, kinesiology at 8th place and Business Administration (Ingeniería Comercial) at 10th place.&lt;ref name="AmericaEconomía"&gt;[http://rankings.americaeconomia.com/pregrado-chile/ranking_universidades_pregrado_chile.html Ranking 2009 Las mejores universidades de Chile]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 UACh's medical students got the second highest marks in Chile in the National Medicine Exam after [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile|PUC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universia.cl/html_estatico/portada/actualidad/noticia_actualidad/param/noticia/bbggcf.html Medicine exam in Universia.cl] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919162720/http://www.universia.cl/html_estatico/portada/actualidad/noticia_actualidad/param/noticia/bbggcf.html |date=September 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, though, UACh medical students dropped down to fifth place, and by 2008 they were down to sixth place.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050205124944/http://www.emn.cl/resultados.html Resultados por escuela 2003-2008] Examen Medico Nacional&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3751">In [[neuroscience]] the '''bridge locus''' for a particular sensory [[percept]] is a hypothetical set of [[neuron]]s whose activity is the basis of that sensory percept. The term was introduced by D.N. Teller and E.Y. Pugh, Jr. in 1983, and has been sparingly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=D.N. Teller |author2=E.Y. Pugh, Jr. |title=Colour Vision |editors=J.D. Mollon, L.T. Sharpe |year=1983 |publisher=Academic Press |pages=581 |isbn=978-0-12-504280-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activity in the bridge locus neurons is postulated to be [[necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary and sufficient]] for sensory perception: if the bridge locus neurons are not active, then the sensory perception does not occur, regardless of the actual sensory input. Conversely if the bridge locus neurons are active, then sensory perception occurs, regardless of the actual sensory input. It is the highest neural level of a sensory perception. So, for example, [[retina]]l neurons are not considered a bridge locus for visual perception because stimulating [[visual cortex]] can give rise to [[phosphene|visual percepts]].&lt;ref&gt;Davida Y Teller "Linking propositions" Vision Research (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all scholars believe in such a [[neural correlate of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Quest for Consciousness |author=Christof Koch |page=88 |publisher=Roberts and Company Publishers |year=2004 |isbn13=9780974707709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pessoa et al., for example, argue that there is no necessity for a bridge locus, basing their argument on the requirement of an isomorphism between neural states and conscious states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Neural Correlates of Consciousness |editor=Thomas Metzinger |chapter=What is a Neural Correlate of Consciousness |author=David J.

He argues, based upon work by Zeki &amp; Shipp, DeYoe &amp; Van Essen, and others, that brain regions are not independent stages or modules but have dense forward and backward projections that act reciprocally, and that visual processing is highly interactive and context-dependent. He also argues that cells in the visual cortex "are not mere 'feature detectors{{'"}}, and that neuroscience has revealed that the brain in fact employs distributed networks, rather than centralized representations. He equates the notion of a bridge locus to a [[Cartesian theatre]] and suggests that as a notion it should be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Consciousness and Intentionality |editor=Denis Fisette |chapter=Filling-in: Visual Science and the Philosophy of Perception |author=Evan Thompson |page=156 |publisher=Springer |year=1999 |isbn13=9780792359074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[computer science]] subfield of [[algorithmic information theory]], a '''Chaitin constant''' ('''Chaitin omega number''')&lt;ref&gt;[[mathworld.wolfram.com]], [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ChaitinsConstant.html Chaitin's Constant]. Retrieved 28 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; or '''halting probability''' is a [[real number]] that, informally speaking, represents the [[probability]] that a randomly constructed program will halt. These numbers are formed from a construction due to [[Gregory Chaitin]].

Although there are infinitely many halting probabilities, it is common to use the letter &amp;Omega; to refer to them as if there were only one.  Because &amp;Omega; depends on the program encoding used, it is sometimes called '''Chaitin's construction''' instead of '''Chaitin's constant''' when not referring to any specific encoding.

Each halting probability is a [[normal number|normal]] and [[transcendental number|transcendental]] real number that is not [[computable number|computable]], which means that there is no [[algorithm]] to compute its digits. Indeed, each halting probability is [[Algorithmically random sequence|Martin-Löf random]], meaning there is not even any algorithm which can reliably guess its digits.

== Background ==
The definition of a halting probability relies on the existence of a '''prefix-free universal computable function.'''  Such a function, intuitively, represents a programming language with the property that no valid program can be obtained as a proper extension of another valid program.

Suppose that ''F'' is a partial function that takes one argument, a finite binary string, and possibly returns a single binary string as output. The function ''F'' is called '''[[Computable function|computable]]''' if there is a [[Turing machine]] that computes it (in the sense that for any finite binary string ''x'' such that ''F(x) = y'' the Turing machine halts with ''y'' on its tape when given the input ''x'').

The function ''F'' is called '''[[Computational universality|universal]]''' if the following property holds:  for every computable function ''f'' of a single variable there is a string ''w'' such that for all ''x'', ''F''(''w''&amp;nbsp;''x'') = ''f''(''x''); here ''w''&amp;nbsp;''x'' represents the [[concatenation]] of the two strings ''w'' and ''x''.  This means that ''F'' can be used to simulate any computable function of one variable.  Informally, ''w'' represents a "script" for the computable function ''f'', and ''F'' represents an "interpreter" that parses the script as a prefix of its input and then executes it on the remainder of input.

The '''domain''' of ''F'' is the set of all inputs ''p'' on which it is defined. For ''F'' that are universal, such a ''p'' can generally be seen both as the concatenation of a program part and a data part, as a single program for the function ''F''.

The function ''F'' is called '''prefix-free''' if there are no two elements ''p'', ''p&amp;prime;'' in its domain such that ''p&amp;prime;'' is a proper extension of ''p''. This can be rephrased as: the domain of ''F'' is a [[prefix-free code]] (instantaneous code) on the set of finite binary strings. A simple way to enforce prefix-free-ness is to use machines whose means of input is a binary stream from which bits can be read one at a time. There is no end-of-stream marker; the end of input is determined by when the universal machine decides to stop reading more bits. Here, the difference between the two notions of program mentioned in the last paragraph becomes clear; one is easily recognized by some grammar, while the other requires arbitrary computation to recognize.

The domain of any universal computable function is a [[computably enumerable set]] but never a [[computable set]].  The domain is always [[Turing degree|Turing equivalent]] to the [[halting problem]].

== Definition ==
Let ''P''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; be the domain of a prefix-free [[universal computable function]] ''F''.  The constant &amp;Omega;&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is then defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_F = \sum_{p \in P_F} 2^{-|p|}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\left|p\right|&lt;/math&gt; denotes the length of a string ''p''. This is an [[series (mathematics)|infinite sum]] which has one summand for every ''p'' in the domain of ''F''.  The requirement that the domain be prefix-free, together with [[Kraft's inequality]], ensures that this sum converges to a [[real number]] between 0 and 1.  If ''F'' is clear from context then &amp;Omega;&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; may be denoted simply &amp;Omega;, although different prefix-free universal computable functions lead to different values of &amp;Omega;.

== Relationship to the halting problem ==
Knowing the first ''N'' bits of &amp;Omega;, one could calculate the [[halting problem]] for all programs of a size up to ''N''. Let the program ''p'' for which the halting problem is to be solved be ''N'' bits long. In [[Dovetailing (computer science)|dovetailing]] fashion, all programs of all lengths are run, until enough have halted to jointly contribute enough probability to match these first ''N'' bits. If the program ''p'' hasn't halted yet, then it never will, since its contribution to the halting probability would affect the first ''N'' bits. Thus, the halting problem would be solved for ''p''.

Because many outstanding problems in number theory, such as [[Goldbach's conjecture]] are equivalent to solving the halting problem for special programs (which would basically search for counter-examples and halt if one is found), knowing enough bits of Chaitin's constant would also imply knowing the answer to these problems. But as the halting problem is not generally solvable, and therefore calculating any but the first few bits of Chaitin's constant is not possible, this just reduces hard problems to impossible ones, much like trying to build an [[Oracle machine#Oracles and halting problems|oracle machine for the halting problem]] would be.

== Interpretation as a probability ==
The [[Cantor space]] is the collection of all infinite sequences of 0s and 1s. A halting probability can be interpreted as the [[measure theory|measure]] of a certain subset of Cantor space under the usual [[probability measure]] on Cantor space.  It is from this interpretation that halting probabilities take their name.

The probability measure on Cantor space, sometimes called the fair-coin measure, is defined so that for any binary string ''x'' the set of sequences that begin with ''x'' has measure 2&lt;sup&gt;−|''x''|&lt;/sup&gt;. This implies that for each natural number ''n'', the set of sequences ''f'' in Cantor space such that ''f''(''n'') = 1 has measure 1/2, and the set of sequences whose ''n''th element is 0 also has measure 1/2.

Let ''F'' be a prefix-free universal computable function. The domain ''P'' of ''F'' consists of an infinite set of binary strings
:&lt;math&gt;P = \{p_1,p_2,\ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Each of these strings ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; determines a subset ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of Cantor space; the set ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; contains all sequences in cantor space that begin with ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. These sets are disjoint because ''P'' is a prefix-free set.  The sum
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{p \in P} 2^{-|p|}&lt;/math&gt;
represents the measure of the set 
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i \in \mathbb{N}} S_i&lt;/math&gt;.

In this way, &amp;Omega;&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; represents the probability that a randomly selected infinite sequence of 0s and 1s begins with a bit string (of some finite length) that is in the domain of ''F''. It is for this reason that &amp;Omega;&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; is called a halting probability.

== Properties ==
Each Chaitin constant &amp;Omega; has the following properties:{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}
* It is [[algorithmic randomness|algorithmically random]]. This means that the shortest program to output the first ''n'' bits of &amp;Omega; must be of size at least ''n''-O(1). This is because, as in the Goldbach example, those ''n'' bits enable us to find out exactly which programs halt among all those of length at most ''n''.
* It is a [[normal number]], which means that its digits are equidistributed as if they were generated by tossing a fair coin.
* It is not a [[computable number]]; there is no computable function that enumerates its binary expansion, as discussed below.
* The set of rational numbers ''q'' such that ''q'' &lt; &amp;Omega; is [[computably enumerable set|computably enumerable]]; a real number with such a property is called a '''left-c.e. real number''' in [[recursion theory]].
* The set of rational numbers ''q'' such that ''q'' &gt; &amp;Omega; is not computably enumerable.
* &amp;Omega; is an [[arithmetical number]].
* It is [[Turing degree|Turing equivalent]] to the [[halting problem]] and thus at level &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_2&lt;/math&gt; of the [[arithmetical hierarchy]].

Not every set that is Turing equivalent to the halting problem is a halting probability.  A [[equivalence relation#Comparing equivalence relations|finer]] equivalence relation, '''Solovay equivalence''', can be used to characterize the halting probabilities among the left-c.e. reals.

== Uncomputability ==
A real number is called computable if there is an algorithm which, given ''n'', returns the first ''n'' digits of the number.  This is equivalent to the existence of a program that enumerates the digits of the real number.

No halting probability is computable. The proof of this fact relies on an algorithm which, given the first ''n'' digits of &amp;Omega;, solves Turing's [[halting problem]] for programs of length up to ''n''. Since the halting problem is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]], &amp;Omega; cannot be computed.

The algorithm proceeds as follows.  Given the first ''n'' digits of &amp;Omega; and a ''k'' ≤ ''n'', the algorithm enumerates the domain of ''F'' until enough elements of the domain have been found so that the probability they represent is within 2&lt;sup&gt;−(''k''+1)&lt;/sup&gt; of &amp;Omega;. After this point, no additional program of length ''k'' can be in the domain, because each of these would add 2&lt;sup&gt;−''k''&lt;/sup&gt; to the measure, which is impossible.  Thus the set of strings of length ''k'' in the domain is exactly the set of such strings already enumerated.

== Algorithmic randomness ==
A real number is random if the binary sequence representing the real number is an [[algorithmically random sequence]]. 
Calude, Hertling, Khoussainov, and Wang showed&lt;ref&gt;Calude, Hertling, Khoussainov, and Wang: Recursively enumerable reals and Chaitin's &amp;Omega; numbers. Theoretical Computer Science 255:125–149, (2001) http://webpages.uncc.edu/yonwang/papers/TCS01.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;
that a recursively enumerable real number is an algorithmically random sequence if and only if it is a Chaitin's &amp;Omega; number.

== Incompleteness theorem for halting probabilities ==
{{Main|Chaitin's incompleteness theorem}}

For each specific consistent effectively represented [[axiomatic system]] for the [[natural numbers]], such as [[Peano axioms|Peano arithmetic]], there exists a constant ''N'' such that no bit of &amp;Omega; after the ''N''th can be proven to be 1 or 0 within that system. The constant ''N'' depends on how the [[formal system]] is effectively represented, and thus does not directly reflect the complexity of the axiomatic system. This incompleteness result is similar to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] in that it shows that no consistent formal theory for arithmetic can be complete.

== Super Omega ==
As mentioned above, the first n bits of [[Gregory Chaitin]]'s constant &amp;Omega; are random or incompressible in the sense that we cannot compute them by a halting algorithm with fewer than n-O(1) bits. However, consider the short but never halting algorithm which systematically lists and runs all possible programs; whenever one of them halts its probability gets added to the output (initialized by zero). After finite time the first n bits of the output will never change any more (it does not matter that this time itself is not computable by a halting program). So there is a short non-halting algorithm whose output converges (after finite time) onto the first n bits of &amp;Omega;. In other words, the [[enumerable]] first n bits of &amp;Omega; are highly compressible in the sense that they are [[limit-computable]] by a very short algorithm; they are not [[random]] with respect to the set of enumerating algorithms. [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] (2000) constructed a limit-computable "Super &amp;Omega;" which in a sense is much more random than the original limit-computable &amp;Omega;, as one cannot significantly compress the Super &amp;Omega; by any enumerating non-halting algorithm.

For an alternative "Super &amp;Omega;", the [[universality probability]] of a [[prefix-free code|prefix-free]] [[Universal Turing Machine]] (UTM){{Snd}} namely, the probability that it remains universal even when every input of it (as a [[binary string]]) is prefixed by a random binary string{{Snd}} can be seen as the non-halting probability of a machine with oracle the third iteration of the [[halting problem]] (i.e., 0``` = 0^{(3)}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barmpalias, G. and Dowe D.L. |title=Universality probability of a prefix-free machine |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A |volume=370 |issue=1 | pages=3488–3511 (Theme Issue 'The foundations of computation, physics and mentality: the Turing legacy' compiled and edited by Barry Cooper and Samson Abramsky) |date=2012 |doi=10.1098/rsta.2011.0319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical energy can be applied for [[Medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] or [[therapeutic]] aims.

The principle on which clinical biophysics is based are represented by the recognizability and the specificity of the physical signal applied:
* recognizability: the capacity of the biological target to recognise the presence of the physical energy: this aspect becomes more important with the lowering of the energy applied.
* specificity: the capacity of the physical agent applied to the biological target to obtain a response depending on its physical characteristics: frequency, length, energy, etc. The effects do not necessarily depend on the quantity of energy applied to the biological target.&lt;ref&gt;Roy K. Aaron, Mark E. Bolander, editors. Symposium of Physical Regulation of Skeletal Repair. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Rosemont, Illinois; 2005. p. 37-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Several papers show that the response of a [[biological system]] when exposed to non-ionizing physical stimuli is not necessarily dependent on the amount of energy applied.{{citation needed|date = October 2011}}
Specific combinations of [[amplitude]], [[frequency]] and [[waveform]] may trigger the most intense response. For example, cell proliferation or activation of [[metabolic pathway]]s.
This has been demonstrated for:
:a) mechanical strains directly applied to the cells or tissue;
:b) mechanical energy applied by ultrasound;
:c) electromagnetic field exposure;
:d) electric field exposure.

Several pre-clinical experiences have laid the foundation to identify exposure conditions that may be used in humans to treat diseases or to promote tissue healing.&lt;ref&gt;Cadossi R, Caruso G, Setti S, Massari L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10041">'''Context-sensitive solutions''' (CSS) is a theoretical and practical approach to transportation decision-making and design that takes into consideration the communities and lands through which streets, roads, and highways pass ("the context"). The term is closely related to but distinguishable from '''context-sensitive design''' in that it asserts that all decisions in transportation planning, project development, operations, and maintenance should be responsive to the context in which these activities occur, not simply the design process. CSS seeks to balance the need to move vehicles efficiently and safely with other desirable outcomes, including [[historic preservation]], environmental [[sustainability]], and the creation of vital public spaces. In transit projects, CSS generally refers to context sensitive planning, design, and development around transit stations, also known as [[transit-oriented development]].

==Overview==
[[File:Ammonite lamp post at dusk, Lyme Regis.JPG|thumb|200px|Custom-designed fittings are one aspect of CSS. Here, the ammonite design of the lamnp standards reflects the local geology of Lyme Regis.]]
In contrast to long-standing practices in transportation design that place primary importance on moving traffic ([[vehicular throughput]]), the CSS process emphasizes that transportation facilities should fit their physical settings and preserve scenic, aesthetic, historic and environmental resources, while maintaining safety and mobility. For instance, if a state highway that passes through a downtown main street, applying CSS principles would entail creating a street where the movement of vehicles does not impede pedestrian activity and sidewalk commerce, rather than a street that is simply widened and straightened to increase speed, capacity and mobility for vehicles as a singular transportation objective. CSS therefore includes principles for context-sensitive decision-making that place a high value on community input and consensus, and more technical principles of context sensitive design.

When CSS principles are applied to transportation projects, the process involves a much broader range of disciplines than traditional transportation design methods, which rely exclusively on the judgment of traffic engineers. CSS is a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach that involves everyone with a significant stake in the project, such as the residents, businesses and local institutions that will be affected by an intervention or a failure to address the transportation implications of development such as congestion. Rather than approaching these stakeholders at the tail end of the design process in an attempt to gain approval, CSS emphasizes the need to incorporate their feedback from the very outset of the planning and design development processes and during all subsequent stages of construction, operations and maintenance.

==Qualities of a CSS project==

The following list of qualities (developed at a 1998 conference for transportation planners called '''"Thinking Beyond the Pavement"'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.contextsensitivesolutions.org/content/reading/tbtp-conference/resources/tbtp-conference/&lt;/ref&gt;) describe the core goals of the CSS process.

{{Quotation|'''The CSS Product: Qualities of Excellence in Transportation Design'''&lt;br /&gt;
The "Qualities that Characterize Excellence in Transportation Design" – that is, of the physical end product of the CSS process – are: 
* The project satisfies the purpose and needs as agreed to by a full range of stakeholders.
* This agreement is forged in the earliest phase of the project and amended as warranted as the project develops.
* The project is a safe facility for both the user and the community.
* The project is in harmony with the community, and it preserves environmental, scenic, aesthetic, historic, and natural resource values of the area, i.e., exhibits context sensitive design.
* The project exceeds the expectations of both designers and stakeholders and achieves a level of excellence in people's minds.
* The project involves efficient and effective use of the resources (time, budget, community) of all involved parties.
* The project is designed and built with minimal disruption to the community.
* The project is seen as having added lasting value to the community.
|As agreed upon by participants of the Thinking Beyond the Pavement Conference, 1998}}

==The CSS process==

This outline of the core steps in the CSS process was also developed at the "Thinking Beyond the Pavement" conference.

{{Quotation|'''The CSS Process: Characteristics of the Process That Yield Excellence'''&lt;br /&gt;
"The Characteristics of the Process that will Yield Excellence in Transportation Design" are: 
*Communication with all stakeholders is open, honest, early, and continuous.
*A multidisciplinary team is established early, with disciplines based on the needs of the specific project, and with the inclusion of the public.
*A full range of stakeholders is involved with transportation officials in the scoping phase (the period before design is begun when the scope of the project is agreed upon). The purposes of the project are clearly defined, and consensus on the scope is forged before proceeding.
*The highway development process is tailored to meet the circumstances. This process should examine multiple alternatives that will result in a consensus of approach methods.
*A commitment to the process from top agency officials and local leaders is secured.
*The public involvement process, which includes informal meetings, is tailored to the project.
*The landscape, the community, and valued resources are understood before engineering design is started. A full range of tools for communication about project alternatives is used (e.g., visualization).
|As agreed upon by participants of the Thinking Beyond the Pavement Conference, 1998}}

==History==

The initial guiding principles of CSS came out of the 1998 "Thinking Beyond the Pavement" conference as a means to describe and foster transportation projects that preserve and enhance the natural and built environments along with economic and social assets for neighborhoods they pass through. In 2003, the [[Federal Highway Administration]] announced that under one of its three Vital Few Objectives (Environmental Stewardship and Streamlining) they had a target goal of  achieving CSS integration within all state Departments of Transportation by September 2007.

The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Organizations (AASHTO) is now (fall 2006) developing strategic goals and objectives for CSS which it describes as a "fundamental change in the way we do business." One principal element of this change is the way transportation planners and engineers address speed. Historically, the speed at which a vehicle can safely travel through the landscape has been regarded as a primary goal of transportation planning since it shortens travel time, saves money (time is money), and improves driver convenience. However, CSS recognizes that designing a facility for the maximum safe speed that is economically feasible can be detrimental to other community goals, and even to vehicle passengers themselves. CSS recognizes that the goal of transportation is social and economic exchange, which cannot occur at high speeds. Instead, CSS attempts to identify, through a community-based process, a  "target speed" that promotes the optimum amount of social and economic exchange, with lowest environmental impacts, that is appropriate for the context. Thus, in cities, if higher vehicle speeds lower the amount of social exchange on a residential street (fewer friends, less street life etc.) then the street will be designed to encourage drivers to slow down so as not to reduce social exchange. In a similar manner, commercial streets will be designed to maximize commercial exchange and designed accordingly. In more rural areas where a primary goal is to move people and goods between human settlements, CSS can be compatible with much higher design speeds. Setting a target speed that is appropriate for the context, and then designing roads, highway and streets to make it difficult for drivers to exceed that target speed, is a central CSS principle and represents a fundamental shift in transportation planning practice.

Some lichens contain both [[green algae]] and cyanobacteria.  In these cases, the cyanobacteria may be enclosed in [[Cephalodium|cephalodia]].  These outgrowths of the main [[thallus]] can take many forms.  The cyanobacteria which live in cephalodia can function in [[nitrogen fixation]] on behalf of the lichen.  These cyanobacteria are generally more rich in nitrogen-fixing cells called [[heterocyst]]s than those cyanobacteria which may live in the main thalli of lichens.

Its customer base includes small, medium and large companies. 

Since November 2016 Dematic has been a member of [[KION Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.logisticsmgmt.com/article/kion_completes_its_acquisition_of_dematic|title=KION completes its acquisition of Dematic|website=www.logisticsmgmt.com|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dematic's headquarters are located in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]].

==History==
Dematic began in 1819 in [[Wetter (Ruhr)|Wetter]], Germany with the founding of {{ill|Mechanische Werkstätten Harkort &amp; Co.|de}}, which was incorporated 1910 by {{ill|Deutsche Maschinenbau-Aktiengesellschaft|de|Demag}} (Demag) and 1973 by [[Mannesmann AG|Mannesmann]]. After the acquisition of U.S. Rapistan (specialised in conveyor systems), Mannesmann DEMAG Fördertechnik AG was established. In 1993, Australian racking and shelving manufacturer Colby was added, and in 1997 the company was renamed to Mannesmann Dematic AG. Four years later, [[Siemens]] bought the company&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-00-955_en.htm|title=Commission gives Siemens conditional go-ahead to take control of Mannesmann subsidiaries Dematic, VDO and Sachs.|last=|first=|date=29 August 2000|publisher=European Union|dead-url=|work=|accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and merged it with its own logistics activities to form Siemens Dematic AG. In 2006 Siemens carved out the industrial and distribution logistics portion as Dematic GmbH &amp; Co. KG. In the same year, the investment firm Triton acquired the majority of shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.siemens.com/press/en/pr_cc/2006/06_jun/dem060616_1385408.htm|title=Triton takes over Dematic|last=|first=|date=June 14, 2006|website=|publisher=Siemens AG, Official Press Release|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 15, 2010, Dematic Group successfully completed the acquisition of HK Systems, a North American automated [[material handling]] and software provider. The expanded manufacturing footprint allows Dematic to manufacture within the USA [[Automated storage and retrieval system|storage and retrieval machines]] and [[Automated Guided Vehicle|automated guided vehicles]] in addition to [[conveyor]], sortation and [[order fulfillment]] technology.

On December 28, 2012, AEA Investors LP ("AEA") and Teachers' Private Capital ("TPC"), the private investment division of the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, completed their acquisition of Dematic from private equity firm Triton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dgap.de/dgap/News/dgap_media/triton-sells-dematic-private-equity-investor-aea-investors-and-ontario-teachers-pension-plan/?newsID=739415|title=Triton sells Dematic to private equity investor AEA Investors and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan|last=|first=|date=November 2012|website=|publisher=DGAP-Media|accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015 Dematic acquired SDI Group Europe, a supplier of garment on hanger and flat sorter technology in Europe.

In November 2015, Dematic acquired Reddwerks Corp. pending approval of the shareholders. The acquisition became final in December 2015.

In March 2016 Dematic acquired NDC Automation, a leading provider of automated guided vehicles and software.

In June 2016, KION Group agreed to buy Dematic for about $2.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newequipment.com/Main/topstories/Kion-Gets-Warehouse-Robotics-With-21-Billion-Demat-1467.aspx|title=Kion Gets Warehouse Robotics With $2.1 Billion Dematic Deal|last=|first=|date=2016-06-21|website=|publisher=New Equipment Digest|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, KION Group completed the acquisition.

'''Documentation Research and Training Centre (DRTC)''' is a research centre for [[library and information science]] and allied disciplines at the [[Indian Statistical Institute]], [[Bangalore]]. The Centre was established in April 1962, under the auspices of Prof. [[S. R. Ranganathan]] (considered to be the father of modern library and information science in India) with the encouragement of Prof. [[P. C. Mahalanobis]] at the [[Indian Statistical Institute]].

DRTC runs a graduate program leading to the award of a 'Master of Science in Library and Information Science' (MS-LIS) from the [[Indian Statistical Institute]]  as well as serving as an academic and research center for Research Fellows registered for a PhD in [[Information Science]]. DRTC is perhaps India's only "proper" [[ischool]] with a very strong research program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drtc.isibang.ac.in/MSLIS|title=Documentation Research and Training Centre (DRTC)|last=|first=|date=|website=drtc.isibang.ac.in|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research at DRTC generally focuses on the application of [[information technology]] to [[library and information science]].

DRTC has a PhD collaboration with the [[University of Trento]], Italy.

2012 marked the Golden Jubilee of DRTC, which was celebrated with the 'International Conference on Trends in Knowledge and Information Dynamics' (ICTK-2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218185328/http://drtc.isibang.ac.in/ictk/|title=ICTK - 2012 {{!}} International Conference on Trends in Knowledge and Information Dynamics. 10–13 July 2012|last=|first=|date=2012-02-18|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Born in [[Elgin, Illinois]], Meadows was educated in science, receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[chemistry]] from [[Carleton College]] in 1963 and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[biophysics]] from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in 1968. After a yearlong trip from England to Sri Lanka and back, she became a research fellow at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], as a member of a team in the department created by [[Jay Forrester]], the inventor of [[system dynamics]] as well as the principle of magnetic data storage for computers. She taught at [[Dartmouth College]] for 29 years, beginning in 1972.&lt;ref name = "meadows2008"&gt;Meadows, Donella H. 2008, ''Thinking in Systems: A Primer'', Chelsea Green Publishing, Vermont, p. 213 (About the Author), {{ISBN|978-1-60358-055-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 2001 of a bacterial infection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/article/171610/limits-growth-book-launched-movement 'The Limits to Growth': A Book That Launched a Movement]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meadows was honored both as a Pew Scholar in Conservation and Environment (1991) and as a [[MacArthur Fellowship|MacArthur Fellow]] (1994).&lt;ref name = "meadows2008" /&gt; She received the Walter C. Paine Science Education Award in 1990. Posthumously, she received the [[John H. Chafee]] Excellence in Environmental Affairs Award for 2001, presented by the [[Conservation Law Foundation]].

Meadows wrote "The Global Citizen,"&lt;ref name = "meadows2008" /&gt; a weekly column on world events from a systems point of view. Many of these columns were compiled and published as a book by the same name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8yE5PzCacXoC&amp;dq=global+citizen&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7nP7JSAhIS&amp;sig=EutjsehkGNfPYVkpJzzLTGvwapk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cPxNSp_eCYXk7AOu4KyKBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3 The Global Citizen Donella H.

Meadows was a longtime member of the United States Association for the [[Club of Rome]], which instituted an award in her memory, the US Association for the Club of Rome Donella Meadows Award in Sustainable Global Actions. The award is given to an outstanding individual who has created actions in a global framework toward the sustainability goals Meadows expressed in her writings.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

== Work ==

=== ''The Limits to Growth'' ===
{{main article|The Limits to Growth}}

In 1972, she was on the MIT team that produced the global [[computer simulation|computer model]] "[[World3]]" for the [[Club of Rome]], providing the basis for ''The Limits to Growth.'' The book reported a study of long-term global trends in population, economics, and the environment. The book made headlines around the world and began a debate about the limits of [[Earth]]'s capacity to support human economic expansion—a debate that continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;"To Grow or not to Grow", Newsweek, March 13, 1972, pages 102-103&lt;/ref&gt; Meadows was the book's lead author, and it had three coauthors: her husband [[Dennis Meadows]], [[Jørgen Randers]], and William W. Behrens III.

===The Balaton Group===
In 1982, Donella and Dennis Meadows created an international "network of networks" for leading researchers on resource use, environmental conservation, systems modeling, and sustainability. Since its foundation, the members have met at [[Lake Balaton]], Hungary, every autumn. While the formal name for the network was the International Network of Resource Information Centres (INRIC), it became more popularly known as the [[Balaton Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Balaton Group History |url=http://www.balatongroup.org/FAQ.html |date=2010-02-05 |accessdate=2015-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205175146/http://www.balatongroup.org/FAQ.html |archivedate=February 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after the location of its meetings.

=== Sustainability Institute and Related Organizations ===
Meadows founded the Sustainability Institute, which combined research in global systems with practical demonstrations of [[sustainable development|sustainable]] living, including the development of a [[cohousing]] (or [[ecovillage]]) and organic farm at [[Cobb Hill]] in [[Hartland, Vermont]]. In 2011, the Sustainability Institute, originally adjacent to Cobb Hill, was renamed the Donella Meadows Institute and moved to Norwich, Vermont. Additional organizations that sprang from the Sustainability Institute include Sustainable Food Lab, Climate Interactive, and Sustainability Leaders Network.

=== State of the Village report ===
In 1990, Meadows published the State of the Village report under the title, "Who lives in the 'Global Village'?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empowermentresources.com/info2/theglobalvillage.html Meadows, Donnella. (1990, May 31). "Who lives in the 'Global Village'?" ''The Global Citizen'']&lt;/ref&gt; which likened the world to a village of 1,000 people. Since then, "If the world were a village of 100 people", derived from her work but further reducing the numbers to those of a village of 100 people, has been published by others in English, Spanish, and Japanese.

=== Twelve leverage points ===
{{Main article|Twelve leverage points}}
Meadows published ''Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System'', one of her best-known essays, in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sustainabilityinstitute.org/pubs/Leverage_Points.pdf |title=Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System |date=1999 |accessdate=2015-10-25 |website=The Sustainability Institute |publisher= |last=Meadows |first=Donella |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008160618/http://www.sustainabilityinstitute.org/pubs/Leverage_Points.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It describes the most and least effective types of interventions in a system (of any kind).

'''Drooling''', or '''slobbering''', is the flow of [[saliva]] outside the [[mouth]]. Drooling can be caused by [[hypersalivation|excess production of saliva]], inability to retain saliva within the mouth (incontinence of saliva), or problems with swallowing ([[dysphagia]] or [[odynophagia]]).

There are some frequent and harmless cases of drooling. For instance, a numbed mouth from either [[Orajel]], or when going to the dentist office.

Isolated drooling in healthy infants and toddlers is normal and may be associated with [[teething]]. It is unlikely to be a sign of disease or complications. Drooling in infants and young children may be exacerbated by [[upper respiratory infection]]s and [[nasal allergies]].

Some people with drooling problems are at increased risk of inhaling saliva, food, or fluids into the [[lungs]], especially if drooling is secondary to a neurological problem. However, if the body's normal reflex mechanisms (such as [[gag reflex|gagging]] and [[cough]]ing) are not impaired, this is not life-threatening.

== Causes ==
Drooling or sialorrhea can occur during sleep. It is often the result of open-mouth posture from [[CNS depressants]] intake or sleeping on one's side. Sometimes while sleeping, saliva does not build up at the back of the throat and does not trigger the normal swallow reflex, leading to the condition. [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] conjectured that drooling occurs during deep sleep, and within the first few hours of falling asleep, since those who are affected by the symptom suffer the most severe harm while napping, rather than during overnight sleep.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Almeida, Cristiana |author2=Almeida, Isabel |author3=Vasconcelos, Carlos |year=2015 |title=Quality of life in systemic sclerosis |journal=Autoimmunity Reviews |volume=14 |issue=12 |pages=1087-1096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''sudden'' onset of drooling may indicate [[poison]]ing – especially by [[pesticide]]s or [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] – or reaction to [[snake]] or [[insect]] [[venom (poison)|venom]]. Excess [[capsaicin]] can cause drooling as well, an example being the ingestion of particularly high [[Scoville Unit]] chili peppers. Some neurological problems cause drooling. Medication can cause drooling, either due to primary action or side-effects; for example the pain-relief medication [[Orajel]] can numb the mucosa.

Causes include:
* [[exercise]], especially [[cardiovascular exercise]]{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}
* [[stroke]] and other neurological pathologies
* [[intellectual disability]]
* [[adenoid hypertrophy]]
* [[cerebral palsy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ajot.aota.org/article.aspx?articleid=1880049 |title=The relationship between oral sensation and drooling in persons with cerebral palsy |access-date=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]]
* [[tumors]] of the upper aerodigestive tract
* [[Parkinson's disease]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00415-009-5098-2?LI=true |title=Prevalence and definition of drooling in Parkinson’s disease: A systematic review |access-date=2013-10-02 | doi=10.1007/s00415-009-5098-2|volume=256 |journal=Journal of Neurology |pages=1391–1396 |author=Kalf, J.G. |pmc=2733191}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[rabies]]
* [[mercury poisoning]]

Drooling associated with [[fever]] or trouble swallowing may be a sign of an infectious disease including:
* [[retropharyngeal abscess]]
* [[peritonsillar abscess]]
* [[tonsilitis]]
* [[EBV infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]]
* [[strep throat]]
* obstructive diseases ([[tumor]]s, [[stenosis]])
* inability to swallow due to neurodegenerative diseases ([[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]])
&lt;!-- Another form of ptyalism is associated with pregnancy, most common in women with a condition known as '''Hyperemesis Gravidarium''', or uncontrollable and frequent nausea and vomiting during pregnancy which is far worse than typical "[[morning sickness]]". With Hyperemesis, ptyalism is a side-effect, which is a natural response to uncontrollable vomiting. With normal vomiting, salivary glands are stimulated to lubricate the oesophagus and mouth to aid in expelling of stomach contents. During a hyperemetic pregnancy, many woman complain of excessive saliva and an inability to swallow this saliva. Some women note having to carry around a "spitoon" or using a cup to spit. Swallowing their own saliva has been noted to gag and further nauseate the women making the hyperemesis that much worse. There are several theories as to the causes of hyperemesis and related symptoms such as ptyalism. Although hyperemesis was once considered a psychological disease, the medical community now considers hyperemesis as a real and serious physiological condition. Some pregnant women who suffer end up terminating the pregnancy.  Others refuse to carry another child. The most frequent act is preparing for the onset of hyperemesis if a subsequent pregnancy is expected. --&gt;

==Treatment==
A comprehensive treatment plan depends on the cause and incorporates several stages of care: Correction of reversible causes, behavior modification, medical treatment, and surgical procedures.

[[Atropine sulfate]] tablets are used in some circumstances to reduce salivation. The same for [[anticholinergic]] drugs which can be also a benefit because they decrease the activity of the acetylcholine muscarinic receptors and can result in decreased salivation. They may be prescribed by doctors in conjunction with behavior modification strategies. Other drugs used are [[glycopyrrolate]] and [[botulinum toxin A]] – botox injection in salivary glands to diminish saliva production.&lt;ref name="Laryngoscope"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1097/00005537-200410000-00033/abstract;jsessionid=76C44AC9DCA7DD61EA8F74230C5C9D8B.f03t04?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false |title=Reduction of salivary flow with botulinum toxin: Extended report on 33&amp;nbsp;patients with drooling, salivary fistulas, and sialadenitis |accessdate=2013-10-26 |doi=10.1097/00005537-200410000-00033 |volume=114 |journal=The Laryngoscope |pages=1856–1860 |author=Ellies Maik}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Neurology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neurology.org/content/61/9/1279.short |title=A randomized trial of botulinum toxin A for treatment of drooling |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jamanetwork"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=352611|title=Treatment of Sialorrhea With GlycopyrrolateA Double-blind, Dose-Ranging Study |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, surgical procedures are considered after clear diagnosis of the cause and evaluation of non-invasive treatment options. Severe cases can be sometimes be treated by surgical intervention – salivary duct relocalization, or in extreme cases [[Resection (surgery)|resection]] of salivary glands.

===Home care===
Care for drooling due to teething includes good [[oral hygiene]]. [[Ice pop]]s or other cold objects (e.g., frozen [[bagel]]s) may be helpful. Care must be taken to avoid choking when a child uses any of these objects. Drooling is also common in children with neurological disorders or undiagnosed developmental delay.

Excessive drooling seems to be due to:
#lack of awareness of the build-up of saliva in the mouth
#infrequent swallowing
#inefficient swallowing

Treatment of excessive drooling addresses its cause:
#cultivating awareness of the mouth and its functions
#increased frequency of swallowing
#cultivating swallowing skill

==Popular culture==
The scope of the meaning of the term ''drool'' in popular use has expanded to include any occasion wherein someone highly desires something, as well as derivative terms indicating sexual arousal; for example the slang ''grool'' is a blend of ''girl'' and ''drool''.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4103">'''Ecological threshold''' is the point at which a relatively small change or [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] in external conditions causes a rapid change in an [[ecosystem]]. When an ecological threshold has been passed, the ecosystem may no longer be able to return to its state by means of its inherent [[Ecological resilience|resilience]] . Crossing an ecological threshold often leads to rapid change of [[ecosystem health]]. Ecological threshold represent a non-linearity of the responses in ecological or biological systems to pressures caused by human activities or natural processes.&lt;ref&gt;Groffman, P., Baron, J., Blett, T., Gold, A., Goodman, I., Gunderson, L., Levinson, B., Palmer, M., Paerl, H., Peterson, G., LeRoy Poff, N., Rejeski, D., Reynolds, J., Turner, M., Weathers, K., &amp; Wiens, J. 2006. Ecological thresholds: the key to successful environmental management or an important concept with no practical application? ''Ecosystems'' 9(1):1–13. [http://landscape.zoology.wisc.edu/People/Turner/groffman2006ecosys.pdf pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Critical load]], [[tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]] and [[regime shift]] are examples of other closely related terms.

== Characteristics ==
Thresholds can be characterized as points or as zones. Zone-type thresholds imply a gradual shift or transition from one state to another rather than an abrupt change at a specific point.&lt;ref&gt;Huggett, A. 2005. The concept and utility of "ecological thresholds" in biodiversity conservation. ''Biological Conservation'' 124(3):301–310&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological thresholds have caught attention because many cases of catastrophic worsening of conditions have proved to be difficult or nearly impossible to remedy (also known as points of no return).  [[Ecological extinction]] is an example of a definitive point of no return.

Ecological thresholds are often characterized by [[hysteresis]], which means the dependence of the state of a system on the history of its state. Even when the change is not irreversible, the return path from altered to original state can be drastically different from the development leading to the altered state.

Another related concept is [[panarchy]]. Panarchy views coupled human-natural systems as a cross-scale set of adaptive cycles that reflect the dynamic nature of human and natural structures across time and space. Sudden shifts in ecosystem state can induce changes in human understanding of the way the systems need to be managed. These changes, in turn, may alter the institutions that carry out that management and as a result, some new changes occur in ecosystems.

== Detection ==
There are many different types of thresholds and detecting the occurrence of a threshold is not always straightforward. One approach is to process time series which are thought to display a shift in order to identify a possible jump. Methods have been developed to enhance and localize the jumps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ifisc.uib.es/ThEnhancer Thresholds enhancer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720145258/http://ifisc.uib.es/ThEnhancer/ |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Some examples of ecological thresholds, such as clear lakes turning into turbid ones, are well documented but many more are probable to exist. The thresholds database &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resalliance.org/183.php Thresholds database]&lt;/ref&gt; by Resilience Alliance and Santa Fe Institute includes over one hundred examples.

{{Anthropology |social/cultural}}

'''Economic anthropology''' is a field that attempts to explain human [[Economy|economic]] behavior in its widest historic, geographic and cultural scope. It is practiced by anthropologists and has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics, of which it is highly critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chibnik|first1=Michael|title=Anthropology, Economics, and Choice|date=2011|publisher=University of Texas Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its origins as a sub-field of anthropology began with work by the Polish founder of anthropology [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] and the French [[Marcel Mauss]] on the nature of [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] as an alternative to [[Market (economics)|market exchange]]. For the most part, studies in economic anthropology focus on [[Trade|exchange]]. In contrast, the [[Marx]]ian school known as "[[Political economy in anthropology|political economy]]" focuses on [[Production (economics)|production]].&lt;!--[Drifting off-topic?:] The large body of work on the [[anthropology of development]] is also dealt with in a separate article.--&gt;

Post-[[World War II]], economic anthropology was highly influenced by the work of economic historian [[Karl Polanyi]]. Polanyi drew on anthropological studies to argue that true market exchange was limited to a restricted number of western, industrial societies. Applying formal economic theory (Formalism) to non-industrial societies was mistaken, he argued. In non-industrial societies, exchange was "embedded" in such non-market institutions as kinship, religion, and politics (an idea he borrowed from Mauss). He labelled this approach [[Substantivism]]. [[The Formalist vs Substantivist debate]] was highly influential and defined an era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hann |first=Chris |title=Economic Anthropology |year=2011 |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge |pages=55–71 |author2=Keith Hart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[globalization]] became a reality, and the division between market and non-market economies –&amp;nbsp;between "the West and the Rest"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The West and the Rest: Discourse and Power|last=Hall|first=Stuart|publisher=Polity Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=https://analepsis.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/hall-west-the-rest.pdf|pages=185-225}}&lt;/ref&gt; – became untenable, anthropologists began to look at the relationship between a variety of ''types'' of exchange within market societies. Neo-substantivists examine the ways in which so-called pure market exchange in market societies fails to fit market ideology. Economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists. They now study the operations of corporations, banks, and the [[global financial system]] from an anthropological perspective.

== Reciprocity and the gift ==
[[File:Bronislawmalinowski.jpg|thumb|left|Bronislaw Malinowski, anthropologist at the London School of Economics]]
[[File:Kula bracelet.jpg|thumb|left|A Kula bracelet from the Trobriand Islands.]]

===Malinowski and Mauss on Kula exchange===
Bronislaw Malinowski's path-breaking work, ''Argonauts of the Western Pacific'' (1922), addressed the question, "why would men risk life and limb to travel across huge expanses of dangerous ocean to give away what appear to be worthless trinkets?" (He could have asked this as well about the Dutch giving trinkets to the aboriginals of Manhattan Island). Malinowski carefully traced the network of exchanges of bracelets and necklaces across the [[Trobriand Islands]], and established that they were part of a system of exchange (the [[Kula ring]]). He stated that this exchange system was clearly linked to political authority.&lt;ref name="Parry 1986 453–73"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parry|first=Jonathan|title=The Gift, the Indian Gift and the 'Indian Gift'|journal=Man|year=1986|volume=21|issue=3|pages=453–73|doi=10.2307/2803096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s and later, Malinowski's study became the subject of debate with the French anthropologist, Marcel Mauss, author of ''The Gift'' (''Essai sur le don,'' 1925).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mauss|first=Marcel|title=The Gift: Forms and Functions of Exchange in Archaic Societies|year=1970|publisher=Cohen &amp; West|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malinowski emphasised the exchange of goods between ''individuals'', and their non-altruistic motives for giving: they expected a return of equal or greater value. In other words, [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] is an implicit part of gifting; no "free gift" is given without expectation of reciprocity.

Mauss, in contrast, has emphasized that the gifts were not between individuals, but between representatives of larger collectivities. These gifts were, he argued, a "total prestation." They were not simple, alienable commodities to be bought and sold, but, like the "[[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown jewels]]", embodied the reputation, history and sense of identity of a "corporate kin group," such as a line of kings. Given the stakes, Mauss asked "why anyone would give them away?" His answer was an enigmatic concept, hau, "the spirit of the gift." A good part of the confusion (and resulting debate) was due to a bad translation. Mauss appeared to be arguing that a return gift is given to keep the very relationship between givers alive; a failure to return a gift ends the relationship and the promise of any future gifts. Based on an improved translation, [[Jonathan Parry]] has demonstrated that Mauss was arguing that the concept of a "pure gift" given altruistically only emerges in societies with a well-developed market ideology.&lt;ref name="Parry 1986 453–73"/&gt;

[[File:Trobriand.png|thumb|right|350px]]

Mauss' concept of "total prestations" has been developed in the later 20th century by [[Annette Weiner]], who revisited Malinowski's fieldsite in the Trobriand Islands. Her 1992 critique was twofold: she noted first that Trobriand Island society has a [[matrilineal]] kinship system, and that women hold a great deal of economic and political power, as inheritance is passed through the female lines. Malinowski missed this and ignored women's exchanges in his study. Secondly, Weiner has developed Mauss' argument about reciprocity and the "spirit of the gift" in terms of "[[inalienable possessions]]: the paradox of keeping while giving."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The Paradox of Keeping-while-Giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weiner contrasts "moveable goods," which can be exchanged, with "immoveable goods," which serve to draw the gifts back (in the Trobriand case, male Kula gifts are moveable gifts compared to those of women's landed property). She argues that the specific goods given, such as [[Crown Jewels]], are so identified with particular groups that, even when given, they are not truly alienated. Not all societies, however, have these kinds of goods, which depend upon the existence of particular kinds of kinship groups. French anthropologist [[Maurice Godelier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; pushed the analysis further in ''The Enigma of the Gift'' (1999).&lt;ref name="Schrauwers"/&gt;

Albert Schrauwers has argued that the kinds of societies used as examples by Weiner and Godelier (including the [[Kula ring]] in the Trobriands, the [[Potlatch]] of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]] in the United States and Canada, and the [[Toraja]] of [[South Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]]) are all characterized by ranked aristocratic kin groups that fit with [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]' model of "House Societies" (where "House" refers to both noble lineage and their landed estate). Total prestations are given, he argues, to preserve landed estates identified with particular kin groups and maintain their place in a ranked society.&lt;ref name="Schrauwers"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title=H(h)ouses, E(e)states and Class: On the importance of capitals in central Sulawesi|journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde|year=2004|volume=160|issue=1|pages=72–94|doi=10.1163/22134379-90003735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gifts and commodities ===
{{main|Moka exchange}}
The misunderstanding about what Mauss meant by "the spirit of the gift" led some anthropologists to contrast "gift economies" with "market economies," presenting them as polar opposites and implying that non-market exchange was always altruistic. [[Marshall Sahlins]], a well-known American cultural anthropologist, identified three main types of reciprocity in his book ''Stone Age Economics'' (1972).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sahlins | first = Marshall |authorlink=Marshall Sahlins | title = Stone Age Economics | publisher = Aldine-Atherton | location = Chicago | year = 1972 | isbn = 0-202-01099-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gift or ''generalized reciprocity'' is the exchange of goods and services without keeping track of their exact value, but often with the expectation that their value will balance out over time. ''Balanced or Symmetrical reciprocity'' occurs when someone gives to someone else, expecting a fair and tangible return - at a specified amount, time, and place. Market or ''Negative reciprocity'' is the exchange of goods and services whereby each party intends to profit from the exchange, often at the expense of the other. Gift economies, or generalized reciprocity, occur within closely knit kin groups, and the more distant the exchange partner, the more imbalanced or negative the exchange becomes.

This opposition was classically expressed by [[Chris Gregory]] in his book "Gifts and Commodities" (1982). Gregory argued that
&lt;blockquote&gt;Commodity exchange is an exchange of '''alienable''' objects between people who are in a state of reciprocal '''independence''' that establishes a '''quantitative''' relationship between the '''objects''' exchanged… Gift exchange is an exchange of '''inalienable''' objects between people who are in a state of reciprocal '''dependence''' that establishes a '''qualitative''' relationship between the '''transactors'''" (emphasis added.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gregory|first=Chris|title=Gifts and Commodities|year=1982|publisher=Academic Press|location=London|pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other anthropologists, however, refused to see these different "[[Spheres of exchange|exchange spheres]]" as polar opposites. [[Marilyn Strathern]], writing on a similar area in Papua New Guinea, dismissed the utility of the opposition in ''The Gender of the Gift'' (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strathern|first=Marilyn|title=The Gender of the Gift: Problems with Women and Problems with Society in Melanesia|year=1988|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=143–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spheres of exchange===
{{main|Spheres of exchange}}
The relationship of new market exchange systems to indigenous non-market exchange remained a perplexing question for anthropologists. [[Paul Bohannan]] (see below, under substantivism) argued that the Tiv of Nigeria had three spheres of exchange, and that only certain kinds of goods could be exchanged in each sphere; each sphere had its own different form of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bohannan|first=Paul|title=The Impact of money on an African subsistence economy|journal=The Journal of Economic History|year=1959|volume=19|issue=4|pages=491–503|doi=10.1017/S0022050700085946}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Clifford Geertz]]'s model of "dual economy" in Indonesia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Agricultural involution; the process of ecological change in Indonesia|year=1963|publisher=University of California Press for the Association of Asian Studies|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[James C. Scott]]'s model of "moral economy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=James C.|title=The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia|year=1976|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  hypothesized different exchange spheres emerging in societies newly integrated into the market; both hypothesized a continuing culturally ordered "traditional" exchange sphere resistant to the market. Geertz used the sphere to explain peasant complacency in the face of exploitation, and Scott to explain peasant rebellion. This idea was taken up lastly by Jonathan Parry and [[Maurice Bloch]], who argued in ''Money and the Morality of Exchange'' (1989) that the "transactional order" through which long-term social reproduction of the family takes place has to be preserved as separate from short-term market relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parry|first=Jonathan|title=Money and the Morality of Exchange|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=28–30|authorlink=Introduction: Money and the Morality of Exchange|author2=Maurice Bloch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity: "the poison of the gift"===
[[File:SharonTemple.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Sharon Temple]], [[Sharon, Ontario]] circa 1860.]]
In his classic summation of the gift exchange debate, Jonathan Parry highlighted that ideologies of the "pure gift" (as opposed to total prestations) "is most likely to arise in highly differentiated societies with an advanced division of labour and a significant commercial sector."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parry|first=Jonathan|title=The Gift, the Indian Gift and the 'Indian Gift'|journal=Man|year=1986|volume=21|issue=3|pages=467|doi=10.2307/2803096}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schrauwers illustrated the same points in two different areas in the context of the "transition to capitalism debate" (see ''[[Political economy in anthropology|Political Economy]]''). He documented the transformations among the [[Pamona people|To Pamona]] of [[Central Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]], as they were incorporated in global market networks over the twentieth century. As their everyday production and consumption activities were increasingly commodified, they developed an oppositional gift (''posintuwu'') exchange system that funded social reproductive activities, thereby preserving larger kin, political and religious groups. This "pure gift" exchange network emerged from an earlier system of "total prestations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title=Colonial "Reformation" in the Highlands of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, 1892-1995|year=2000|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|pages=129–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:To Pamona Bridewealth exchange.jpg|thumb|left|'Free gifts' of Posintuwu culminate in the exchange of bridewealth at a [[Pamona people|To Pamona]] wedding.]]
Similarly, in analyzing the same "transition to capitalist debate" in early 19th century North America, Schrauwers documented how new, oppositional "[[Moral economy|moral economies]]" grew in parallel with the emergence of the market economy. As the market became increasingly institutionalized, so too did early [[Owenism|utopian socialist]] experiments such as the [[The Children of Peace|Children of Peace]], in [[Sharon, Ontario]], Canada. They built an ornate temple dedicated to sacralizing the giving of charity; this was eventually institutionalized as a mutual credit organization, land sharing, and co-operative marketing. In both cases, Schrauwers emphasizes that these alternate exchange spheres are tightly integrated and mutualistic with markets as commodities move in and out of each circuit.&lt;ref name="Schrauwers 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title='Money bound you – money shall loose you': Gift Giving, Social Capital and the Meaning of Money in Upper Canada|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|year=2011|volume=53|issue=2|pages=1–30|doi=10.1017/S0010417511000077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parry had also underscored, using the example of charitable giving of alms in India ([[Dāna]]), that the "pure gift" of alms given with no expectation of return could be "poisonous." That is, the gift of alms embodying the sins of the giver, when given to ritually pure priests, saddled these priests with impurities that they could not cleanse themselves of. "Pure gifts" given without a return, can place recipients in debt, and hence in dependent status: the poison of the gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parry|first=Jonathan|title=The Gift, the Indian Gift and the 'Indian Gift'|journal=Man|year=1986|volume=21|issue=3|pages=463–67|doi=10.2307/2803096}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Children of Peace tried to sacralize the pure giving of alms, they found charity created difficulties for recipients. It highlighted their near bankruptcy and hence opened them to lawsuits and indefinite imprisonment for debt. Rather than accept charity, the free gift, they opted for loans.&lt;ref name="Schrauwers 2011" /&gt;

=== 'The social life of things' and singularization ===
{{main|Commodity Pathway Diversion}}
[[File:Wedding rings.jpg|thumbnail|Wedding rings: commodity or pure gift?]]
Rather than emphasize how particular kinds of objects are either gifts or commodities to be traded in restricted spheres of exchange, [[Arjun Appadurai]] and others began to look at how objects flowed between these spheres of exchange. They shifted attention away from the character of the human relationships formed through exchange, and placed it on "the social life of things" instead. They examined the strategies by which an object could be "[[Commodity Pathway Diversion|singularized]]" (made unique, special, one-of-a-kind) and so withdrawn from the market. A marriage ceremony that transforms a purchased ring into an irreplaceable family heirloom is one example; the heirloom, in turn, makes a perfect gift.

Singularization is the reverse of the seemingly irresistible process of commodification. These scholars show how all economies are a constant flow of material objects that enter and leave specific exchange spheres. A similar approach is taken by [[Nicholas Thomas]], who examines the same range of cultures and the anthropologists who write about them, and redirects attention to the "entangled objects" and their roles as both gifts and commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Nicholas|title=Entangled Objects: Exchange, Material Culture, and Colonialism in the Pacific|year=1991|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This emphasis on things has led to new explorations in "consumption studies" (see below).

== Cultural construction of economic systems: the substantivist approach==

===Formalist vs substantivist debate===
{{main|The formalist vs substantivist debate}}
[[File:El Cerrito, San Miguel County, New Mexico. The staple crops in El Cerrito are corn, beans and alfal . . . - NARA - 521202.jpg|thumbnail|left|Non-market subsistence farming in New Mexico: household provisioning or 'economic' activity?]]
The opposition between [[Substantivism|substantivist]] and formalist economic models was first proposed by [[Karl Polanyi]] in his work ''[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]]'' (1944). He argued that the term 'economics' has two meanings: the formal meaning refers to economics as the logic of rational action and decision-making, as rational choice between the alternative uses of limited (scarce) means. The second, substantive meaning, however, presupposes neither rational decision-making nor conditions of scarcity. It simply refers to the study of how humans make a living from their social and natural environment. A society's livelihood strategy is seen as an adaptation to its environment and material conditions, a process which may or may not involve utility maximisation. The substantive meaning of 'economics' is seen in the broader sense of 'economising' or 'provisioning'. Economics is simply the way members of society meet their material needs. Anthropologists embraced the substantivist position as empirically oriented, as it did not impose western cultural assumptions on other societies where they might not be warranted. The Formalist vs. Substantivist debate was not between anthropologists and economists, however, but a disciplinary debate largely confined to the journal ''Research in Economic Anthropology.'' In many ways, it reflects the common debates between [[Emic and etic|"etic" and "emic"]] explanations as defined by [[Marvin Harris]] in cultural anthropology of the period. The principal proponents of the substantivist model were George Dalton and [[Paul Bohannan]]. Formalists such as [[Raymond Firth]] and [[Harold K. Schneider]] asserted that the neoclassical model of economics could be applied to any society if appropriate modifications are made, arguing that its principles have universal validity.

For some anthropologists, the substantivist position does not go far enough. [[Stephen Gudeman]], for example, argues that the processes of making a livelihood are culturally constructed. Therefore, models of livelihoods and related economic concepts such as [[Trade|exchange]], [[money]] or [[Profit (economics)|profit]] must be analyzed through the locals' ways of understanding them. Rather than devising universal models rooting in Western economic [[terminology|terminologies]] and then applying them indiscriminately to all societies, scholars must come to understand the 'local model'.

===Stephen Gudeman and the culturalist approach===
In his work on livelihoods, Gudeman seeks to present the "people's own economic construction" (1986:1);&lt;ref name="gudeman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gudeman, S.|title=Economics as culture : models and metaphors of livelihood|location=London|publisher=Routledge|year=1986|id=|isbn = 978-0-7102-0560-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, people's own conceptualizations or mental maps of economics and its various aspects. His description of a peasant community in [[Panama]] reveals that the locals did not engage in exchange with each other in order to make a profit but rather viewed it as an "exchange of equivalents", with the exchange value of a good being defined by the expenses spent on producing it. Only outside merchants made profits in their dealings with the community; it was a complete mystery to the locals how they managed to do so.
{{rquote|right|Gaining a livelihood might be modelled as a causal and instrumental act, as a natural and inevitable sequence, as a result of supernatural dispositions or as a combination of all these.| Gudeman 1986:47&lt;ref name="gudeman"/&gt;}}

Gudeman also criticizes the substantivist position for imposing their universal model of economics on preindustrial societies and so making the same mistake as the formalists. While conceding that substantivism rightly emphasises the significance of social institutions in economic processes, Gudeman considers any deductive universal model, be it formalist, substantivist or [[Marxism|Marxist]], to be ethnocentric and tautological. In his view they all model [[wiktionary:Relationship|relationship]]s as mechanistic processes by taking the logic of natural science based on the [[Nature|material world]] and applying it to the [[human]] [[world]]. Rather than to "arrogate to themselves a privileged right to model the economies of their subjects", anthropologists should seek to understand and interpret local models (1986:38).&lt;ref name="gudeman"/&gt; Such local models may differ radically from their Western counterparts. For example, the [[Iban people|Iban]] use only hand [[knives]] to [[harvest]] rice. Although the use of [[sickle]]s could speed up the harvesting process, they believe that this may cause the spirit of the rice to flee, and their desire to prevent that outcome is greater than their desire to economize the harvesting process.

Gudeman brings post-modern [[cultural relativism]] to its logical conclusion. Generally speaking, however, culturalism can also be seen as an extension of the substantivist view, with a stronger emphasis on cultural constructivism, a more detailed account of local understandings and [[metaphor]]s of economic concepts, and a greater focus on socio-cultural dynamics than the latter ([[cf.]] Hann, 2000).&lt;ref name="hann"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hann, C. M.|title=Social Anthropology|location=London|publisher=Teach Yourself|year=2000|id=|isbn = 978-0-340-72482-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Culturalists tend to be both less taxonomic and more culturally relativistic in their descriptions while critically reflecting on the power relationship between the ethnographer (or 'modeller') and the subjects of his or her research. While substantivists generally focus on institutions as their unit of analysis, culturalists lean towards detailed and comprehensive analyses of particular local communities. Both views agree in rejecting the formalist assumption that all human behaviour can be explained in terms of rational decision-making and utility maximisation.

Culturalism can be criticized from various perspectives. Marxists argue that culturalists are too idealistic in their notion of the social construction of [[reality]] and too weak in their analysis of external (i.e. material) constraints on individuals that affect their livelihood choices. If, as Gudeman argues, local models cannot be held against a universal standard, then they cannot be related to hegemonic ideologies propagated by the powerful, which serve to neutralise resistance. This is further complicated by the fact that in an age of [[globalization]] most cultures are being integrated into the global capitalist system and are influenced to conform to Western ways of thinking and acting. Local and global discourses are mixing, and the distinctions between the two are beginning to blur. Even though people will retain aspects of their existing worldviews, universal models can be used to study the dynamics of their integration into the rest of the world.

===Householding===

===Entrepreneurs in "imperfect markets"===
Inspired by a collection on "''Trade and Market in the early Empires''" edited by Karl Polanyi, the substantivists conducted a wide comparative study of market behavior in traditional societies where such markets were [[embeddedness|embedded]] in kinship, religion and politics. They thus remained focused on the social and cultural processes that shaped markets, rather than on the individual focused study of economizing behavior found in economic analysis. [[George Dalton (economist)|George Dalton]] and [[Paul Bohannan|Paul Bohannon]], for example, published a collection on markets in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=George Dalton|first=Paul Bohannon|title=Markets in Africa|year=1962|publisher=Northwestern University Press|location=Evanston, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Pedlars and Princes: Social Development and Economic Change in Two Indonesian Towns'' by Clifford Geertz compared the entrepreneurial cultures of Islamic Java with Hinduized Bali in the post-colonial period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Pedlars and Princes: Social Development and Economic Change in Two Indonesian Towns|year=1963|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Java, trade was in the hands of pious Muslims, whereas in Bali, larger enterprises were organized by aristocrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wertheim|first=W.F.|title=Peasants, Peddlers and Princes in Indonesia: A Review Article|journal=Pacific Affairs|year=1964|volume=37|issue=3|pages=307–11|doi=10.2307/2754978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, this literature was refocused on "informal economies", those market activities lying on the periphery of legal markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Halperin|first=Rhoda H.|title=Cultural Economies: Past and Present|year=1988|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin, Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Modernization theory]] of development had led economists in the 1950s and 1960s to expect that traditional forms of work and production would disappear in developing countries. Anthropologists found, however, that the sector had not only persisted, but expanded in new and unexpected ways. In accepting that these forms of productions were there to stay, scholars began using the term informal sector, which is credited to the British anthropologist [[Keith Hart (anthropologist)|Keith Hart]] in a study on [[Ghana]] in 1973. This literature focuses on the "invisible work" done by those who fall outside the formal production process, such as the production of clothing by domestic workers, or those who are bound labourers in sweatshops. As these studies have shifted to the informal sector of western economies, the field has been dominated by those taking a [[Political economy in anthropology|political economy]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Narotzky|first=Susana|title=New Directions in Economic Anthropoogy|year=1997|publisher=Pluto Press|location=London|pages=35–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Substantivism and capitalism as a cultural system===
While many anthropologists like Gudeman were concerned with peasant economic behaviour, others turned to the analysis of market societies. Economic Sociologist [[Mark Granovetter]] provided a new research paradigm (neo-substantivism) for these researchers. Granovetter argued that the [[neo-liberal]] view of economic action which separated economics from society and culture promoted an 'undersocialized account' that atomises human behavior. Similarly, he argued, substantivists had an "over-socialized" view of economic actors, refusing to see the ways that rational choice could influence the ways they acted in traditional, "embedded" social roles. Neo-Substantivism overlaps with [[institutional economics|'old']] and especially [[new institutional economics]].

{{Quotation|Actors do not behave or decide as atoms outside a social context, nor do they adhere slavishly to a script written for them by the particular intersection of social categories that they happen to occupy. Their attempts at purposive action are instead embedded in concrete, ongoing systems of social relations.&lt;ref name="granovetter"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Granovetter, M.|title=Economic action and social structure: the problem of embeddedness|journal=The American Journal of Sociology|volume=91|pages=487|year=1985|id=|doi=10.1086/228311|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Granovetter applied the concept of [[embeddedness]] to market societies, demonstrating that even their, "rational" economic exchanges are influenced by pre-existing social ties.&lt;ref name="granovetter"/&gt;  In his study of ethnic Chinese [[business network]]s in [[Indonesia]], [[Granovetter]] found individual's economic agency embedded in networks of strong personal relations. In processes of clientelization the cultivation of personal relationships between traders and customers assumes an equal or higher importance than the economic transactions involved. Economic exchanges are not carried out between strangers but rather by individuals involved in long-term continuing relationships.

== Money and finance==
[[File:ClientCardSample.png|thumb|180px|left|A sample picture of a fictional ATM card. The largest part of the world's money exists only as accounting numbers which are transferred between financial computers.  Various plastic cards and other devices give individual consumers the power to electronically transfer such money to and from their bank accounts, without the use of currency.]]

===Special and general purpose of money===
Early anthropologists of the substantivist school were struck by the number of "special purpose monies," like [[wampum]] and [[shell money]], that they encountered. These special purpose monies were used to facilitate trade, but were not the "universal" money of market-based economies. Universal money served five functions:
* Medium of exchange: they facilitated trade
* Unit of account: they are an abstract measure of value or worth
* Store of value: they allow wealth to be preserved over time
* Standard of deferred payment: they are a measure of debt
* Means of payment: they can be used in non-market situations to pay debts (like taxes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dalton|first=George|title=Economic Anthropology and Development: Essays on Tribal and Peasant Economies|year=1971|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|pages=167–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special purpose monies, in contrast, were frequently restricted in their use; they might be limited to a specific exchange sphere such as the brass rods used by the Tiv of Nigeria in the early twentieth century (see "[[spheres of exchange]]" above). Most of this early work documented the effects of universal money on these special purpose monies. Universal money frequently weakened the boundaries between exchange spheres. Others have pointed out, however, how alternative currencies such as [[Ithaca Hours|Ithaca HOURS]] in New York state are used to create new community based spheres of exchange in western market economies by fostering barter.&lt;ref name="Maurer 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maurer|first=Bill|title=Mutual Life, Limited: Islamic Banking, Alternative Currencies, Lateral Reason|year=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herrmann|first=Gretchen|title=Special Money: Ithaca Hours and Garage Sales|journal=Ethnology|year=2006|volume=45|issue=2|pages=125–41|doi=10.2307/4617570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of this work was updated and retheorized in the edited collection: ''Money and Modernity: State and Local Currencies in Melanesia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Akin, David|first=Robbins, Joel|title=Money and Modernity: State and Local Currencies in Melanesia|year=1999|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|location=Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second collection, ''Money and the morality of exchange'' examined how "general purpose money" could be transformed into a "special purpose money" - how money could be "socialized" and stripped of its moral danger so that it abets domestic economies free of market demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parry, J.|first=Bloch, M.|title=Money and the morality of exchange|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Reddy undertook the same kind of analysis of the meanings of monetary exchange in terms of the growth of Liberalism in early modern Europe. Reddy critiques what he calls the "Liberal illusion" that developed in this period, that money is a universal equivalent and a principle of liberation. He underscores the different values and meanings that money has for those of different classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reddy|first=William M.|title=Money and liberty in modern Europe: a critique of historical understanding|year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barter===
{{main|Barter}}

David Graeber argues that the inefficiencies of barter in archaic society has been used by economists since [[Adam Smith]] to explain the emergence of money, the economy, and hence the discipline of economics itself.&lt;ref name="Graeber-p21-41"&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Debt: the first 5,000 years|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|location=New York|pages=21–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Economists of the contemporary orthodoxy... propose an evolutionary development of economies which places barter, as a 'natural' human characteristic, at the most primitive stage, to be superseded by monetary exchange as soon as people become aware of the latter's greater efficiency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Humphrey|first=Caroline|title=Barter and Economic Disintegration|journal=Man|year=1985|volume=20|issue=1|page=49|doi=10.2307/2802221}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, extensive investigation since then has established that "No example of a barter economy, pure and simple, has ever been described, let alone the emergence from it of money; all available ethnography suggests that there never has been such a thing. But there are economies today which are nevertheless ''dominated'' by barter."&lt;ref name="Humphrey-p48"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Humphrey|first=Caroline|title=Barter and Economic Disintegration|journal=Man|year=1985|volume=20|issue=1|page=48|doi=10.2307/2802221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists have argued "that when something resembling barter ''does'' occur in stateless societies it is almost always between strangers, people who would otherwise be enemies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of our Dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barter occurred between strangers, not fellow villagers, and hence cannot be used to naturalistically explain the origin of money without the state. Since most people engaged in trade knew each other, exchange was fostered through the extension of credit.&lt;ref name="Humphrey-p48" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Debt: the first 5,000 years|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|location=New York|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcel Mauss, author of '[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]', argued that the first economic contracts were to ''not'' act in one's economic self-interest, and that before money, exchange was fostered through the processes of [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] and [[redistribution (cultural anthropology)|redistribution]], not barter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The false coin of our own dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|pages=153–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everyday exchange relations  in such societies are characterized by generalized reciprocity, or a non-calculative familial "communism" where each takes according to their needs, and gives as they have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Debt: The First 5,000 Years|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=94–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other anthropologists have questioned whether barter is typically between "total" strangers, a form of barter known as "[[silent trade]]".  However, Benjamin Orlove has shown that barter occurs through "silent trade" (between strangers), but also in commercial markets as well. "Because barter is a difficult way of conducting trade, it will occur only where there are strong institutional constraints on the use of money or where the barter symbolically denotes a special social relationship and is used in well-defined conditions. To sum up, multipurpose money in markets is like lubrication for machines - necessary for the most efficient function, but not necessary for the existence of the market itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economic Anthropology|year=1989|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|pages=179|author=Plattner, Stuart|authorlink=Markets and Marketplaces|editor=Plattner, Stuart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barter may occur in commercial economies, usually during periods of monetary crisis. During such a crisis, currency may be in short supply, or highly devalued through hyperinflation. In such cases, money ceases to be the universal [[medium of exchange]] or standard of value. Money may be in such short supply that it becomes an item of barter itself rather than the means of exchange. Barter may also occur when people cannot afford to keep money (as when hyperinflation quickly devalues it).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Humphrey|first=Caroline|title=Barter and Economic Disintegration|journal=Man|year=1985|volume=20|issue=1|page=52|doi=10.2307/2802221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Money as commodity fetish ===
[[File:McKinley Prosperity.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Metal money fetishism: A political poster shows [[gold coin]] as the basis of prosperity. (ca. 1896)]]
Anthropologists have analyzed these cultural situations where universal money is being introduced as a means of revealing the underlying cultural assumptions about money that market based societies have internalized. Michael Taussig, for example, examined the reactions of peasant farmers in Colombia as they struggled to understand how money could make interest. Taussig highlights that we have [[Commodity fetishism|fetishized]] money. We view money as an active agent, capable of doing things, of growth. In viewing money as an active agent, we obscure the social relationships that actually give money its power. The Colombian peasants, seeking to explain how money could bear interest, turned to folk beliefs like the "baptism of money" to explain how money could grow. Dishonest individuals would have money baptized, which would then become an active agent; whenever used to buy goods, it would escape the till and return to its owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taussig|first=Michael|title=The genesis of capitalism amongst a South American peasantry: Devil's labor and the baptism of money|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|year=1977|volume=19|issue=2|pages=130–155|doi=10.1017/S0010417500008586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schrauwers similarly examines a situation where paper money was introduced for the first time, in early nineteenth century Ontario, Canada. Paper money, or bank notes, were not a store of wealth; they were an I.O.U., a "promisory note," a fetish of debt. Banks in the era had limited capital. They didn't loan that capital. Instead, they issued paper notes promising to pay that amount should the note be presented in their office. Since these notes stayed in circulation for lengthy periods, banks had little fear they would have to pay, and so issued many more notes than they could redeem, and charged interest on all of them. Utilizing Bourdieu's concept of symbolic capital, Schrauwers examines the way that elite social status was converted into economic capital (the bank note). The bank note's value depended entirely on the public's perceptions that it could be redeemed, and that perception was based entirely on the social status of the bank's shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title="Money bound you - money shall loose you": Micro-credit, Social Capital, and the meaning of money in Upper Canada|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|year=2011|volume=53|issue=2|pages=314–343|doi=10.1017/S0010417511000077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banking, finance and the stock market===

More recent work has focused on finance capital and stock markets. Anna Tsing for example, analyzed the "[[Bre-X]] stock scandal" in Canada and Indonesia in terms of "The economy of appearances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tsing|first=Anna L.|title=Friction: An Ethnography of Global Connection|year=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellen Hertz, in contrast, looked at the development of stock markets in Shanghai, China, and the particular ways in which this free market was embedded in local political and cultural realities; markets do not operate in the same manner in all countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hertz|first=Ellen|title=The Trading Crowd: An Ethnography of the Shanghai Stock Market|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar study was done by [[Karen Ho]] on Wall Street, in the midst of the financial crisis of 2008. Her book, ''Liquidated: an ethnography of Wall Street'', provides an insiders view of how "market rationality" works, and how it is embedded in particular kinds of social networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ho|first=Karen|title=Liquidated: an ethnography of Wall Street|year=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Maurer]] has examined how Islamic bankers who are seeking to avoid religiously proscribed interest payments have remade money and finance in Indonesia. His book, ''Mutual Life, Limited'', compares these Islamic attempts to remake the basis of money to local currency systems in the United States, such as "Ithaca Hours." In doing so, he questions what it is that gives money its value.&lt;ref name="Maurer 2005"/&gt; This same question of what gives money its value is also addressed in David Graeber's book ''Towards an Anthropological Theory of Value: The false coin of our own dreams''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Towards an Anthropological Theory of Value: The false coin of our own dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=Basingstoke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Carrier]] has extended the cultural economic and neo-substantivist position by applying their methods to the "science of economics" as a cultural practice. He has edited two collection that examine "free market" ideologies, comparing them to the culturally embedded economic practices they purport to describe.  The edited collection, "Meanings of the market: the Free Market in Western Culture",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carrier|first=James|title=Meanings of the market: the Free Market in Western Culture|year=1997|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;  examined the use of market models in policy-making in the United States. A second edited collection "Virtualism: A New Political Economy," examined the cultural and social effects on western nations forced to adhere to abstract models of the free market: "Economic models are no longer measured against the world they seek to describe, but instead the world is measured against them, found wanting and made to conform."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carrier|first=James|title=Virtualism: A New Political Economy|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumption studies==

===Pierre Bourdieu on ''Distinction''===

==The anthropology of corporate capitalism==

===Symbolic and economic capital===

Similar insights were developed by [[Pierre Bourdieu]], who also rejected the arguments of the [[New institutional economics|new institutional economists]]. While these economists attempted to incorporate culture in their models, they did so by arguing that non-market "tradition" was the product of rational maximizing action in the market (i.e., to show they are the solution to an economic problem, rather than having deep cultural roots). Bourdieu argued strongly against what he called RAT (Rational Action Theory) theory, arguing that any actor, when asked for an explanation for their behaviour will provide a rational post hoc answer, but that excuse does not in fact guide the individual in the act. Driving a car is an example; individuals do so out of an acquired "instinct", obeying the rules of the road without actually focusing upon them. Bourdieu utilized an alternate model, which emphasized how "economic capital" could be translated into "symbolic capital" and vice versa. For example, in traditional Mexican villages, those of wealth would be called upon to fulfill "cargo offices" in the church, and host feasts in honour of the saints. These offices used up their economic capital, but in so doing, it was translated into status (symbolic capital) in the traditional role. This symbolic capital could, in turn, be used to draw customers in the marketplace because of a reputation for honesty and selflessness. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Actor-Network theory===
[[Michel Callon]] has spearheaded the movement of applying ANT approaches to study economic life (notably economic markets). This body of work interrogates the interrelation between the economy and economics, highlighting the ways in which economics (and economics-inspired disciplines such as marketing) shapes the economy (see Callon, 1998 and 2005).

===Ethnographies of the corporation===
Corporations are increasingly hiring anthropologists as employees and consultants, leading to an increasingly critical appraisal about the organizational forms of post-modern capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cefkin|first=Melissa|title=Ethnography and the Corporate Encounter|year=2009|publisher=Berghahn|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aihwa Ong's ''Spirits of resistance and capitalist discipline: factory women in Malaysia'' (1987) was pathbreaking in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ong|first=Aihwa|title=Spirits of resistance and capitalist discipline: factory women in Malaysia|year=1987|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work inspired a generation of anthropologists who have examined the incorporation of women within corporate economies, especially in the new "Free trade zones" of the newly industrializing third world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brenner|first=Suzanne|title=The domestication of desire: women, wealth, and modernity in Java|year=1998|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Carla|title=High tech and high heels in the gobal economy: women, work, and pink-collar identities in the Caribbean|year=2000|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham NC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have focused on the former industrialized (now rust-belt) economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mollona|first=Massimiliano|title=Made in Sheffield. An ethnography of industrial work and politics|year=2009|publisher=Berghahn|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daromir Rudnyckyj has analyzed how neo-liberal economic discourses have been utilized by Indonesian Muslims operating the Krakatau Steel Company to create a "spiritual economy" conducive to globalization while enhancing the Islamic piety of workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudnyckyj|first=Daromir|title=Spiritual Economies: Islam, Globalization and the Afterlife of Development|year=2010|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George E. Marcus|George Marcus]] has called for anthropologists to "study up" and to focus on corporate elites, and has edited a series called ''Late Editions: Cultural Studies for the End of the Century.''

The '''Eduardo Mondlane University''' ({{lang-pt|Universidade Eduardo Mondlane}}; UEM) is the oldest and largest [[university]] in [[Mozambique]]. The '''UEM''' is located in [[Maputo]] and has about 40,000 students enrolled. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UEM em números - 2015|url=http://uem.mz/index.php/uem-em-numeros-2015|website=Universidade Eduardo Mondlane|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==History==
[[File:Universidade Eduardo Mondlane.jpg|thumb|Eduardo Mondlane University]]
The institution was set up as a center for higher education in 1962 in what was then [[Maputo|Lourenço Marques]], the capital of [[Portugal]]'s [[overseas province of Mozambique]]. Founded by the time of [[Ministry of the Overseas (Portugal)|Overseas Minister]] [[Adriano Moreira]], it was called ''Estudos Gerais Universitários de Moçambique'' (Mozambique General University Studies)&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; after ''[[Studium Generale]]''; in 1968 it became the '''Universidade de Lourenço Marques''' (University of Lourenço Marques).&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uem.mz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=42|website=uem.mz|title=History of Eduardo Mondlane University|accessdate=11 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303183546/http://www.uem.mz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=42|archivedate=3 March 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Mozambique became [[History of Mozambique#Independence|independent]] in 1975, the city was renamed "Maputo" and the university was renamed in honor of [[Frelimo]] leader [[Eduardo Mondlane]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

==Student enrolment==
All students at the Universidade Eduardo Mondlane are full-time, contact students. As of 2015, the university consists of around 40,000 students, of which around 3,300 are pursuing postgraduate courses &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UEM em Números - 2015|url=http://uem.mz/index.php/uem-em-numeros-2015|website=Universidade Eduardo Mondlane|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Electric motor.gif|thumb|Animation of an Electric motor.]]

An '''electric motor''' is an [[electric machine|electrical machine]] that converts [[electrical energy]] into [[mechanical energy]]. Most electric motors operate through the interaction between the motor's [[magnetic field]] and [[electrical conductor|winding currents]] to generate force in the form of [[rotation]]. Electric motors can be powered by [[direct current]] (DC) sources, such as from batteries, motor vehicles or rectifiers, or by [[alternating current]] (AC) sources, such as a power grid, [[Inverter (electrical)|inverters]] or electrical generators. An [[electric generator]] is mechanically identical to an electric motor, but operates in the reverse direction, accepting mechanical energy (such as from flowing water) and converting this mechanical energy into electrical energy. 

Electric motors may be classified by considerations such as power source type, internal construction, application and type of motion output. In addition to AC versus DC types, motors may be [[brushed motor|brushed]] or [[brushless motor|brushless]], may be of various phase (see [[single-phase]], [[two-phase electric power|two-phase]], or [[three-phase]]), and may be either air-cooled or liquid-cooled. General-purpose motors with standard dimensions and characteristics provide convenient mechanical power for industrial use. The largest electric motors are used for ship propulsion, pipeline compression and [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage]] applications with ratings reaching 100 megawatts. Electric motors are found in industrial fans, blowers and pumps, machine tools, household appliances, power tools and disk drives. Small motors may be found in electric watches. 

In certain applications, such as in [[regenerative braking]] with [[traction motor]]s, electric motors can be used in reverse as generators to recover energy that might otherwise be lost as heat and friction.

Electric motors produce linear or rotary force ([[torque]]) and can be distinguished from devices such as magnetic [[Solenoid|solenoids]] and loudspeakers that convert electricity into motion but do not generate usable mechanical force, which are respectively referred to as actuators and transducers.

==History==
{{main|History of the electric motor}}

===Early motors===
[[File:Faraday magnetic rotation.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Faraday's electromagnetic experiment, 1821&lt;ref name="Faraday (1822)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faraday|first=Michael|title=On Some New Electro-Magnetical Motion, and on the Theory of Magnetism|journal=Quarterly Journal of Science, Literature and the Arts|year=1822|volume=XII|pages=74–96 (§IX)|url=https://archive.org/details/quarterlyjournal12jour|accessdate=12 February 2013|publisher=Royal Institution of Great Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The first electric motors were simple [[electrostatic motor|electrostatic]] devices described in experiments by Scottish monk [[Andrew Gordon (Benedictine)|Andrew Gordon]] and American experimenter [[Benjamin Franklin]] in the 1740s.&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;Tom McInally, The Sixth Scottish University. The Scots Colleges Abroad: 1575 to 1799 (Brill, Leiden, 2012) p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;OLEG D. JEFIMENKO, Electrostatic Motors, Their History, Types, and Principles of Operation, Electret Scientific Company - 1973, page 22-45&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical principle behind them, [[Ampère's force law]], was discovered by [[André-Marie Ampère]] in 1820. The law described the production of mechanical force by the interactions of an electric current and a magnetic field. The conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy by [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] means was demonstrated by English scientist [[Michael Faraday]] in 1821. A free-hanging wire was dipped into a pool of mercury, on which a [[permanent magnet|permanent magnet (PM)]] was placed. When a current was passed through the wire, the wire rotated around the magnet, showing that the current gave rise to a close circular magnetic field around the wire.&lt;ref name="SparkMuseum (Motor)"&gt;{{cite conference|title=The Development of the Electric Motor,|url=http://www.sparkmuseum.com/MOTORS.HTM|publisher=SparkMuseum|accessdate=12 February 2013|booktitle=Early Electric Motors|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306085840/http://www.sparkmuseum.com/MOTORS.HTM|archivedate=6 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This motor is often demonstrated in physics experiments, substituting [[brine]] for (toxic) mercury. Though [[Barlow's wheel]] was an early refinement to this Faraday demonstration, these and similar [[homopolar motor]]s remained unsuited to practical application until late in the century.

In 1827, [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[physicist]] [[Ányos Jedlik]] started experimenting with [[electromagnetic coil]]s. After Jedlik solved the technical problems of continuous rotation with the invention of the [[commutator (electric)|commutator]], he called his early devices "electromagnetic self-rotors". Although they were used only for teaching, in 1828 Jedlik demonstrated the first device to contain the three main components of practical [[Direct current|DC]] motors: the [[stator]], [[rotor (electric)|rotor]] and commutator. The device employed no permanent magnets, as the magnetic fields of both the stationary and revolving components were produced solely by the currents flowing through their windings.&lt;ref name="Guillemin (1891)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Guillemin|first=Amédée|trans-title=Electricity and Magnetism|year=1891|publisher=McMillan and Co.|title='Le Magnétisme et l'Électricitée'|others=trans., ed. &amp; rev. from the French by Sylvanus P.

===DC motors===
After many other more or less successful attempts with relatively weak rotating and reciprocating apparatus Prussian [[Moritz von Jacobi]] created the first real rotating electric motor in May 1834. It developed remarkable mechanical output power. His motor set a world record, which Jacobi improved four years later in September 1838.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Richter |first=Jan |title=Jacobi's Motor |publisher=Elektrotechnischen Instituts. Karlsruhe Institute of Technology |date=7 February 2013|accessdate= 14 May 2017 |url=https://www.eti.kit.edu/english/1382.php |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512221521/http://www.eti.kit.edu/english/1382.php |archivedate=2017-05-12 |df= }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; His second motor was powerful enough to drive a boat with 14 people across a wide river. It was also in 1839/40 that other developers managed to build motors with similar and then higher performance.

The first [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] {{visible anchor|DC electric motor}} capable of turning machinery was invented by British scientist [[William Sturgeon]] in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gee|first=William|others=|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|chapter=Sturgeon, William (1783–1850)|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/26748 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Sturgeon's work, a commutator-type direct-current electric motor was built by American inventor [[Thomas Davenport (inventor)|Thomas Davenport]], which he patented in 1837. The motors ran at up to 600 revolutions per minute, and powered machine tools and a printing press.&lt;ref name="Garrison (1998)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garrison|first=Ervan G.|title=A History of Engineering and Technology: Artful Methods|year=1998|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5mvVElGudyYC}}|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-8493-9810-X|edition=2nd|accessdate=May 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high cost of [[battery (electricity)|primary battery power]], the motors were commercially unsuccessful and bankrupted Davenport. Several inventors followed Sturgeon in the development of DC motors, but all encountered the same battery cost issues. No [[Electric power distribution|electricity distribution]] system was available at the time. No practical commercial market emerged for these motors.&lt;ref name="Nye (1990)"&gt;{{cite book |title=Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology |last=Nye |first=David E. |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/electrifying-america |year=1990 |publisher=The MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-64030-5 |ref=harv |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403044745/http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/electrifying-america |archivedate=2013-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1855, Jedlik built a device using similar principles to those used in his electromagnetic self-rotors that was capable of useful work.&lt;ref name="Guillemin (1891)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Electropaedia (home)" /&gt; He built a model [[electric vehicle]] that same year.&lt;ref name="Hungarianscience (Frankfurt)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibition on the History of Hungarian Science|url=http://www.frankfurt.matav.hu/angol/magytud.htm|accessdate=13 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826080638/http://www.frankfurt.matav.hu/angol/magytud.htm|archivedate=26 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major turning point came in 1864, when [[Antonio Pacinotti]] first described the ring armature. This featured symmetrically-grouped coils closed upon themselves and connected to the bars of a commutator, the brushes of which delivered practically non-fluctuating current.&lt;ref name="Antonio Pacinotti"&gt;{{cite web|title=Antonio Pacinotti|url=http://ethw.org/Antonio_Pacinotti|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305154622/http://ethw.org/Antonio_Pacinotti|archivedate=2016-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein"&gt;{{cite web|title= The Power Makers: Steam, Electricity, and the Men Who Invented Modern America|url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=w0o5Ld53wAEC|page=164}}|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180104232726/https://books.google.com/books?id=w0o5Ld53wAEC&amp;pg=PT164&amp;lpg=PT164&amp;dq=pacinotti+dc+motor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=s9gxdk7Xb1&amp;sig=6bXaoWnI8s1M1SXb-cQl9KUtzLc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_-u_B75PLAhWBPpQKHTksCO8Q6AEIODAG#v=onepage&amp;q=pacinotti%20dc%20motor&amp;false|archivedate= 2018-01-04|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercially successful DC motors followed the invention by [[Zénobe Gramme]] who, in 1871, reinvented Pacinotti's design. In 1873, Gramme showed that his dynamo could be used as a motor, [[:fr:Hippolyte Fontaine#1873 : l'expérience décisive|which he demonstrated to great effect at exhibitions in Vienna and Philadelphia]] by connecting two such DC motors up to 2&amp;nbsp;km from each other, using one as a generator.&lt;ref name="gamme"&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/270.html|title=Zénobe Théophile Gramme|accessdate=2012-09-19|booktitle=Invent Now, Inc.

In 1886, [[Frank Julian Sprague]] invented the first practical DC motor, a non-sparking device that maintained relatively constant speed under variable loads. Other Sprague electric inventions about this time greatly improved grid electric distribution (prior work done while employed by [[Thomas Edison]]), allowed power from electric motors to be returned to the electric grid, provided for electric distribution to trolleys via overhead wires and the trolley pole, and provided control systems for electric operations. This allowed Sprague to use electric motors to invent the first electric trolley system in 1887–88 in [[Richmond, Virginia]], the electric elevator and control system in 1892, and the electric subway with independently-powered centrally-controlled cars. The latter were first installed in 1892 in Chicago by the [[South Side Elevated Railroad]], where it became popularly known as the "[[Chicago "L"|L]]". Sprague's motor and related inventions led to an explosion of interest and use in electric motors for industry. The development of electric motors of acceptable efficiency was delayed for several decades by failure to recognize the extreme importance of an air gap between the rotor and stator. Efficient designs have a comparatively small air gap.&lt;ref name="Ganot (1881)"&gt;

Electric motors revolutionized industry. Industrial processes were no longer limited by power transmission using line shafts, belts, compressed air or hydraulic pressure. Instead, every machine could be equipped with its own power source, providing easy control at the point of use, and improving power transmission efficiency. Electric motors applied in agriculture eliminated human and animal muscle power from such tasks as handling grain or pumping water. Household uses of electric motors reduced heavy labor in the home and made higher standards of convenience, comfort and safety possible. Today, electric motors consume more than half of the electric energy produced in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/pdfs/mc-0382.pdf|title=Buying an Energy-Efficient Electric Motor - Fact Sheet|publisher=USDoE|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902144422/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/pdfs/mc-0382.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AC motors===
In 1824 French physicist [[François Arago]] formulated the existence of [[rotating magnetic field]]s, termed [[Arago's rotations]], which, by manually turning switches on and off, Walter Baily demonstrated in 1879 as in effect the first primitive [[induction motor]].&lt;ref name="Babbage (1825)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Babbage|first=C.|author2=Herschel, J.

In 1888, Tesla presented his paper ''A New System for Alternating Current Motors and Transformers'' to the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers|AIEE]] that described three patented two-phase four-stator-pole motor types: one with a four-pole rotor forming a non-self-starting [[reluctance motor]], another with a wound rotor forming a self-starting [[induction motor]], and the third a true [[synchronous motor]] with separately excited DC supply to rotor winding.

One of the patents Tesla filed in 1887, however, also described a shorted-winding-rotor induction motor. [[George Westinghouse]] promptly bought Tesla's patents, employed Tesla to develop them, and assigned [[Charles F. Scott (engineer)|C. F. Scott]] to help Tesla; however, Tesla left for other pursuits in 1889.&lt;ref name="Vuckovic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Drury"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferraris (EBE)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biography of Galileo Ferraris"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neidhofer (2007)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pansini (1989)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alger (1976)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alger|first=P.L.|last2=Arnold z|first2=R.E.|title=The History of Induction Motors in America|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|year=1976|volume=64|issue=9|pages=1380–1383|doi=10.1109/PROC.1976.10329}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 December 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klooster (2009)"&gt;

Steadfast in his promotion of three-phase development, [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] invented the three-phase cage-rotor induction motor in 1889 and the three-limb [[transformer]] in 1890.

[[Benjamin G. Lamme|B. G. Lamme]] later developed a rotating bar winding rotor.&lt;ref name="Alger (1976)"/&gt;

The [[General Electric Company]] began developing three-phase induction motors in 1891.&lt;ref name="Alger (1976)"/&gt; By 1896, General Electric and Westinghouse signed a cross-licensing agreement for the bar-winding-rotor design, later called the [[squirrel-cage rotor]].&lt;ref name="Alger (1976)"/&gt; Induction motor improvements flowing from these inventions and innovations were such that a 100-[[horsepower|horsepower (HP)]] induction motor currently has the same mounting dimensions as a 7.5 HP motor in 1897.&lt;ref name="Alger (1976)"/&gt;

==Components==
[[File:Stator and rotor by Zureks.JPG|thumb|right|Electric motor rotor (left) and stator (right)]]

===Rotor===
{{main|Rotor (electric)}}
In an electric motor, the moving part is the rotor, which turns the shaft to deliver the mechanical power. The rotor usually has conductors laid into it that carry currents, which interact with the magnetic field of the stator to generate the forces that turn the shaft. Alternatively, some rotors carry permanent magnets, and the stator holds the conductors.

===Bearings===
The rotor is supported by [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], which allow the rotor to turn on its axis.  The bearings are in turn supported by the motor housing.  The motor shaft extends through the bearings to the outside of the motor, where the load is applied.  Because the forces of the load are exerted beyond the outermost bearing, the load is said to be ''overhung''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How belt drives impact overhung load |publisher=Gates Corporation |date=2017 |url=http://designcenter.gates.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Gates-How-Belt-Drives-Impact-Overhung-Load-White-Paper.pdf |accessdate=July 28, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222054609/http://designcenter.gates.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Gates-How-Belt-Drives-Impact-Overhung-Load-White-Paper.pdf |archivedate=February 22, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stator===
{{main|Stator}}
The stator is the stationary part of the motor’s electromagnetic circuit and usually consists of either windings or permanent magnets. The stator core is made up of many thin metal sheets, called laminations. Laminations are used to reduce energy losses that would result if a solid core were used.

===Air gap===
The distance between the rotor and stator is called the air gap. The air gap has important effects, and is generally as small as possible, as a large gap has a strong negative effect on performance. It is the main source of the low power factor at which motors operate.  The magnetizing current increases with the air gap. For this reason, the air gap should be minimal. Very small gaps may pose mechanical problems in addition to noise and losses.

[[File:Salient-pole rotor.png|thumb|right|Salient-pole rotor]]

===Windings===
{{main|Windings}}
Windings are wires that are laid in [[electromagnetic coil|coils]], usually wrapped around a laminated soft iron [[magnetic core]] so as to form magnetic poles when energized with current.

Electric machines come in two basic magnet field pole configurations: ''salient-'' and ''nonsalient-pole'' configurations. In the salient-pole machine the pole's magnetic field is produced by a winding wound around the pole below the pole face. In the ''nonsalient-pole'', or distributed field, or round-rotor, machine, the winding is distributed in pole face slots.&lt;ref name="Mortensen (1949)"&gt;{{cite book|title=§7-1 'General Picture of a Synchronous Machine' in Sec. 7 - Alternating-Current Generators and Motors|first=S. H.|last=Mortensen|last2=Beckwith |first2=S.|page=646-647, figs. 7-1 &amp; 7-2}} in {{harvnb|Knowlton|1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[shaded-pole motor]] has a winding around part of the pole that delays the phase of the magnetic field for that pole.

Some motors have conductors that consist of thicker metal, such as bars or sheets of metal, usually [[copper]], alternatively [[aluminum]]. These are usually powered by [[electromagnetic induction]].

===Commutator===
{{main|Commutator (electric)}}
[[File:Tiny motor windings - commutator - brushes in Zip Zaps toy R-C car.jpg|thumb|A toy's small DC motor with its commutator]]
A [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] is a mechanism used to [[switch]] the input of most DC machines and certain AC machines. It consists of slip-ring segments insulated from each other and from the shaft. The motor's armature current is supplied through stationary [[brush (electric)|brushes]] in contact with the revolving commutator, which causes required current reversal, and applies power to the machine in an optimal manner as the [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] rotates from pole to pole.{{sfn|Hameyer|2001|p=  62}}&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, §83, p. 812&lt;/ref&gt; In absence of such current reversal, the motor would brake to a stop. In light of improved technologies in the electronic-controller, sensorless-control, induction-motor, and permanent-magnet-motor fields, externally-commutated induction and [[permanent-magnet motor]]s are displacing electromechanically-commutated motors.

==Motor supply and control==

===Motor supply===
A DC motor is usually supplied through slip ring commutator as described above. AC motors' commutation can be either slip ring commutator or externally commutated type, can be fixed-speed or variable-speed control type, and can be synchronous or asynchronous type. [[Universal motor]]s can run on either AC or DC.

===Motor control===
Fixed-speed controlled AC motors are provided with direct-on-line or soft-start starters.

Variable-speed controlled AC motors are provided with a range of different [[power inverter]], [[variable-frequency drive]] or electronic commutator technologies.

The term electronic commutator is usually associated with self-commutated [[brushless DC electric motor|brushless DC motor]] and [[switched reluctance motor]] applications.

==Major categories==
Electric motors operate on three different physical principles: [[magnetism]], [[electrostatic motor|electrostatics]] and [[piezoelectric motor|piezoelectricity]]. By far, the most common is magnetism.

In magnetic motors, magnetic fields are formed in both the rotor and the stator. The product between these two fields gives rise to a force, and thus a torque on the motor shaft. One, or both, of these fields must be made to change with the rotation of the motor. This is done by switching the poles on and off at the right time, or varying the strength of the pole.

Once started, a synchronous motor requires synchronism with the moving magnetic field's synchronous speed for all normal torque conditions.

In synchronous machines, the magnetic field must be provided by means other than induction such as from separately excited windings or permanent magnets.

A [[fractional-horsepower motor|fractional-horsepower (FHP)]] motor either has a rating below about 1 horsepower (0.746&amp;nbsp;kW), or is manufactured with a standard-frame size smaller than a standard 1 HP motor. Many household and industrial motors are in the fractional-horsepower class.

==Self-commutated motor==

===Brushed DC motor===
{{main|DC motor}}
By definition, all self-commutated DC motors run on DC electric power. Most DC motors are small permanent magnet (PM) types. They contain a [[Brush (electric)|brushed]] internal mechanical commutation to reverse motor windings' current in synchronism with rotation.&lt;ref name="Weiβmantel (2008)"&gt;{{cite book|first=H|last =Weiβmantel|author2=Oesingmann, P. |author3=Möckel, A. |title=§2.1 Motors with Commutator in Chapter 2 - Motors with Continuous Rotation|pages=13–160}} in {{harvnb|Stölting|Kallenbach|Amrhein|2008|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Electrically excited DC motor====
{{Main|Brushed DC electric motor}}
[[File:Electric motor cycle 2.png|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Workings of a brushed electric motor with a two-pole rotor and PM stator. ("N" and "S" designate polarities on the inside faces of the magnets; the outside faces have opposite polarities.)]]
A commutated DC motor has a set of rotating windings wound on an [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] mounted on a rotating shaft. The shaft also carries the commutator, a long-lasting rotary electrical switch that periodically reverses the flow of current in the rotor windings as the shaft rotates. Thus, every brushed DC motor has AC flowing through its rotating windings. Current flows through one or more pairs of brushes that bear on the commutator; the brushes connect an external source of electric power to the rotating armature.

The rotating armature consists of one or more coils of wire wound around a laminated, [[soft magnetic material|magnetically "soft"]] ferromagnetic core. Current from the brushes flows through the commutator and one winding of the armature, making it a temporary magnet (an [[electromagnet]]). The magnetic field produced by the armature interacts with a stationary magnetic field produced by either PMs or another winding (a field coil), as part of the motor frame. The force between the two magnetic fields tends to rotate the motor shaft. The commutator switches power to the coils as the rotor turns, keeping the magnetic poles of the rotor from ever fully aligning with the magnetic poles of the stator field, so that the rotor never stops (like a compass needle does), but rather keeps rotating as long as power is applied.

Many of the limitations of the classic commutator DC motor are due to the need for brushes to press against the commutator. This creates friction. Sparks are created by the brushes making and breaking circuits through the rotor coils as the brushes cross the insulating gaps between commutator sections. Depending on the commutator design, this may include the brushes shorting together adjacent sections – and hence coil ends – momentarily while crossing the gaps. Furthermore, the [[inductance]] of the rotor coils causes the voltage across each to rise when its circuit is opened, increasing the sparking of the brushes. This sparking limits the maximum speed of the machine, as too-rapid sparking will overheat, erode, or even melt the commutator. The current density per unit area of the brushes, in combination with their [[resistivity]], limits the output of the motor. The making and breaking of electric contact also generates [[electrical noise]]; sparking generates [[Radio frequency interference|RFI]]. Brushes eventually wear out and require replacement, and the commutator itself is subject to wear and maintenance (on larger motors) or replacement (on small motors). The commutator assembly on a large motor is a costly element, requiring precision assembly of many parts. On small motors, the commutator is usually permanently integrated into the rotor, so replacing it usually requires replacing the whole rotor.

While most commutators are cylindrical, some are flat discs consisting of several segments (typically, at least three) mounted on an insulator.

Large brushes are desired for a larger brush contact area to maximize motor output, but small brushes are desired for low mass to maximize the speed at which the motor can run without the brushes excessively bouncing and sparking. (Small brushes are also desirable for lower cost.) Stiffer brush springs can also be used to make brushes of a given mass work at a higher speed, but at the cost of greater friction losses (lower efficiency) and accelerated brush and commutator wear. Therefore, DC motor brush design entails a trade-off between output power, speed, and efficiency/wear.

DC machines are defined as follows:&lt;ref name="Dorf (1997)"&gt;{{cite conference|editor-last=Dorf|editor-first=Richard C.

There are five types of brushed DC motor:-
* DC shunt-wound motor
* DC series-wound motor
* DC compound motor (two configurations):
** Cumulative compound
** Differentially compounded
* PM DC motor (not shown)
* Separately excited (not shown).

====Permanent magnet DC motor====
{{main|Permanent-magnet electric motor}}
A PM (permanent magnet) motor does not have a field winding on the stator frame, instead relying on PMs to provide the magnetic field against which the rotor field interacts to produce torque. Compensating windings in series with the armature may be used on large motors to improve commutation under load. Because this field is fixed, it cannot be adjusted for speed control. PM fields (stators) are convenient in miniature motors to eliminate the power consumption of the field winding. Most larger DC motors are of the "dynamo" type, which have stator windings. Historically, PMs could not be made to retain high flux if they were disassembled; field windings were more practical to obtain the needed amount of flux. However, large PMs are costly, as well as dangerous and difficult to assemble; this favors wound fields for large machines.

To minimize overall weight and size, miniature PM motors may use high energy magnets made with [[neodymium]] or other strategic elements; most such are neodymium-iron-boron alloy. With their higher flux density, electric machines with high-energy PMs are at least competitive with all optimally designed [[#Singly fed electric motor|singly-fed]] synchronous and induction electric machines. Miniature motors resemble the structure in the illustration, except that they have at least three rotor poles (to ensure starting, regardless of rotor position) and their outer housing is a steel tube that magnetically links the exteriors of the curved field magnets.

===Electronic commutator (EC) motor===

====Brushless DC motor====
{{Main|Brushless DC electric motor}}
Some of the problems of the brushed DC motor are eliminated in the BLDC design. In this motor, the mechanical "rotating switch" or commutator is replaced by an external electronic switch synchronised to the rotor's position. BLDC motors are typically 85–90% efficient or more. Efficiency for a BLDC motor of up to 96.5% have been reported,&lt;ref name="Nozawa (2009)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nozawa|first=Tetsuo (2009)|title=Tokai University Unveils 100W DC Motor with 96% Efficiency|url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20090403/168295/|publisher=Tech-On -- Nikkei Electronics|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101131311/http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20090403/168295/|archivedate=2011-01-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas DC motors with brushgear are typically 75–80% efficient.

The BLDC motor's characteristic trapezoidal [[counter-electromotive force]] (CEMF) waveform is derived partly from the stator windings being evenly distributed, and partly from the placement of the rotor's permanent magnets. Also known as electronically commutated DC or inside out DC motors, the stator windings of trapezoidal BLDC motors can be with single-phase, two-phase or three-phase and use [[Hall effect sensor]]s mounted on their windings for rotor position sensing and low cost [[closed-loop controller|closed-loop control]] of the electronic commutator.

BLDC motors are commonly used where precise speed control is necessary, as in computer disk drives or in video cassette recorders, the spindles within CD, CD-ROM (etc.) drives, and mechanisms within office products, such as fans, laser printers and photocopiers. They have several advantages over conventional motors:
* Compared to AC fans using shaded-pole motors, they are very efficient, running much cooler than the equivalent AC motors. This cool operation leads to much-improved life of the fan's bearings.
* Without a commutator to wear out, the life of a BLDC motor can be significantly longer compared to a DC motor using brushes and a commutator. Commutation also tends to cause a great deal of electrical and RF noise; without a commutator or brushes, a BLDC motor may be used in electrically sensitive devices like audio equipment or computers.
* The same Hall effect sensors that provide the commutation can also provide a convenient [[tachometer]] signal for closed-loop control (servo-controlled) applications. In fans, the tachometer signal can be used to derive a "fan OK" signal as well as provide running speed feedback.
* The motor can be easily synchronized to an internal or external clock, leading to precise speed control.
* BLDC motors have no chance of sparking, unlike brushed motors, making them better suited to environments with volatile chemicals and fuels. Also, sparking generates ozone, which can accumulate in poorly ventilated buildings risking harm to occupants' health.
* BLDC motors are usually used in small equipment such as computers and are generally used in fans to get rid of unwanted heat.
* They are also acoustically very quiet motors, which is an advantage if being used in equipment that is affected by vibrations.
Modern BLDC motors range in power from a fraction of a watt to many kilowatts. Larger BLDC motors up to about 100&amp;nbsp;kW rating are used in electric vehicles. They also find significant use in high-performance electric model aircraft.

====Switched reluctance motor====
[[File:Switched reluctance motor 6-4.svg|thumb|right|6/4 pole switched reluctance motor]]
{{Main|Switched reluctance motor}}

The SRM has no brushes or permanent magnets, and the rotor has no electric currents.
Instead, torque comes from a slight misalignment of poles on the rotor with poles on the stator.
The rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field of the stator, while the stator field windings are sequentially energized to rotate the stator field.

The magnetic flux created by the field windings follows the path of least magnetic reluctance, meaning the flux will flow through poles of the rotor that are closest to the energized poles of the stator, thereby magnetizing those poles of the rotor and creating torque. As the rotor turns, different windings will be energized, keeping the rotor turning.

SRMs are used in some appliances&lt;ref name="Bush (2009)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bush |first=Steve (2009) |title=Dyson vacuums 104,000&amp;nbsp;rpm brushless DC technology |url=http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/13/08/2010/46377/dyson-vacuums-104000rpm-brushless-dc-technology.htm |publisher=Electronics Weekly Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411205153/http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/13/08/2010/46377/dyson-vacuums-104000rpm-brushless-dc-technology.htm |archivedate=2012-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cleantechnica.com/2018/03/11/tesla-model-3-motor-in-depth/|title=Tesla Model 3 Motor — Everything I've Been Able To Learn About It (Welcome To The Machine) {{!}} CleanTechnica|last=|first=|date=March 11, 2018|website=cleantechnica.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Universal AC/DC motor===
{{main|Universal motor}}
[[File:Universalmotor 3.JPG|thumb|Modern low-cost universal motor, from a vacuum cleaner. Field windings are dark copper-colored, toward the back, on both sides. The rotor's laminated core is gray metallic, with dark slots for winding the coils. The commutator (partly hidden) has become dark from use; it is toward the front. The large brown molded-plastic piece in the foreground supports the brush guides and brushes (both sides), as well as the front motor bearing.]]
A commutated electrically excited series or parallel wound motor is referred to as a universal motor because it can be designed to operate on AC or DC power. A universal motor can operate well on AC because the current in both the field and the armature coils (and hence the resultant magnetic fields) will alternate (reverse polarity) in synchronism, and hence the resulting mechanical force will occur in a constant direction of rotation.

Operating at normal [[utility frequency|power line frequencies]], universal motors are often found in a range less than {{nowrap|1000 watts}}. Universal motors also formed the basis of the traditional railway traction motor in [[Railway electrification system#Low-frequency alternating current|electric railways]]. In this application, the use of AC to power a motor originally designed to run on DC would lead to efficiency losses due to [[eddy current]] heating of their magnetic components, particularly the motor field pole-pieces that, for DC, would have used solid (un-laminated) iron and they are now rarely used.

An advantage of the universal motor is that AC supplies may be used on motors that have some characteristics more common in DC motors, specifically high starting torque and very compact design if high running speeds are used. The negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the commutator. Such motors are used in devices, such as food mixers and power tools, that are used only intermittently, and often have high starting-torque demands. Multiple taps on the field coil provide (imprecise) stepped speed control. Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC). Universal motors also lend themselves to [[TRIAC#Application|electronic speed control]] and, as such, are an ideal choice for devices like domestic washing machines. The motor can be used to agitate the drum (both forwards and in reverse) by switching the field winding with respect to the armature.

Whereas SCIMs cannot turn a shaft faster than allowed by the power line frequency, universal motors can run at much higher speeds. This makes them useful for appliances such as blenders, vacuum cleaners, and hair dryers where high speed and light weight are desirable. They are also commonly used in portable power tools, such as drills, sanders, circular and jig saws, where the motor's characteristics work well. Many vacuum cleaner and weed trimmer motors exceed {{nowrap|10,000 rpm}}, while many similar miniature grinders exceed {{nowrap|30,000 rpm}}.

==Externally commutated AC machine==
{{Main|AC motor}}

The design of AC induction and synchronous motors is optimized for operation on single-phase or polyphase sinusoidal or quasi-sinusoidal waveform power such as supplied for fixed-speed application from the AC power grid or for variable-speed application from VFD controllers. An AC motor has two parts: a stationary stator having coils supplied with AC to produce a rotating magnetic field, and a rotor attached to the output shaft that is given a torque by the rotating field.

===Induction motor===
{{Main|Induction motor}}

[[File:Elliott-Motor.jpg|thumb|Large 4,500 HP AC Induction Motor.]]

====Cage and wound rotor induction motor====
An induction motor is an asynchronous AC motor where power is transferred to the rotor by electromagnetic induction, much like transformer action. An induction motor resembles a rotating transformer, because the stator (stationary part) is essentially the primary side of the transformer and the rotor (rotating part) is the secondary side. Polyphase induction motors are widely used in industry.

Induction motors may be further divided into Squirrel Cage Induction Motors and [[Wound rotor motor|Wound Rotor Induction Motors]] (WRIMs). SCIMs have a heavy winding made up of solid bars, usually aluminum or copper, joined by rings at the ends of the rotor. When one considers only the bars and rings as a whole, they are much like an animal's rotating exercise cage, hence the name.

Currents induced into this winding provide the rotor magnetic field. The shape of the rotor bars determines the speed-torque characteristics. At low speeds, the current induced in the squirrel cage is nearly at line frequency and tends to be in the outer parts of the rotor cage. As the motor accelerates, the slip frequency becomes lower, and more current is in the interior of the winding. By shaping the bars to change the resistance of the winding portions in the interior and outer parts of the cage, effectively a variable resistance is inserted in the rotor circuit. However, the majority of such motors have uniform bars.

In a WRIM, the rotor winding is made of many turns of insulated wire and is connected to [[slip ring]]s on the motor shaft. An external resistor or other control devices can be connected in the rotor circuit. Resistors allow control of the motor speed, although significant power is dissipated in the external resistance. A converter can be fed from the rotor circuit and return the slip-frequency power that would otherwise be wasted back into the power system through an inverter or separate motor-generator.

The WRIM is used primarily to start a high inertia load or a load that requires a very high starting torque across the full speed range. By correctly selecting the resistors used in the secondary resistance or slip ring starter, the motor is able to produce maximum torque at a relatively low supply current from zero speed to full speed. This type of motor also offers controllable speed.

Motor speed can be changed because the torque curve of the motor is effectively modified by the amount of resistance connected to the rotor circuit. Increasing the value of resistance will move the speed of maximum torque down. If the resistance connected to the rotor is increased beyond the point where the maximum torque occurs at zero speed, the torque will be further reduced.

When used with a load that has a torque curve that increases with speed, the motor will operate at the speed where the torque developed by the motor is equal to the load torque. Reducing the load will cause the motor to speed up, and increasing the load will cause the motor to slow down until the load and motor torque are equal. Operated in this manner, the slip losses are dissipated in the secondary resistors and can be very significant. The speed regulation and net efficiency is also very poor.

====Torque motor====
{{main|Torque motor}}
A torque motor is a specialized form of electric motor that can operate indefinitely while stalled, that is, with the rotor blocked from turning, without incurring damage. In this mode of operation, the motor will apply a steady torque to the load (hence the name).

A common application of a torque motor would be the supply- and take-up reel motors in a tape drive. In this application, driven from a low voltage, the characteristics of these motors allow a relatively constant light tension to be applied to the tape whether or not the capstan is feeding tape past the tape heads. Driven from a higher voltage, (and so delivering a higher torque), the torque motors can also achieve fast-forward and rewind operation without requiring any additional mechanics such as gears or clutches. In the computer gaming world, torque motors are used in force feedback steering wheels.

Another common application is the control of the throttle of an internal combustion [[engine]] in conjunction with an electronic governor. In this usage, the motor works against a return spring to move the throttle in accordance with the output of the governor. The latter monitors engine speed by counting electrical pulses from the ignition system or from a magnetic pickup and, depending on the speed, makes small adjustments to the amount of current applied to the motor. If the engine starts to slow down relative to the desired speed, the current will be increased, the motor will develop more torque, pulling against the return spring and opening the throttle. Should the engine run too fast, the governor will reduce the current being applied to the motor, causing the return spring to pull back and close the throttle.

===Synchronous motor===
{{Main|Synchronous motor}}

A synchronous electric motor is an AC motor distinguished by a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets at the same rate as the AC and resulting in a magnetic field that drives it. Another way of saying this is that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions. Contrast this with an induction motor, which must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a DC field. Slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not self-starting. The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch.

Finally, hysteresis synchronous motors typically are (essentially) two-phase motors with a phase-shifting capacitor for one phase. They start like induction motors, but when slip rate decreases sufficiently, the rotor (a smooth cylinder) becomes temporarily magnetized. Its distributed poles make it act like a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). The rotor material, like that of a common nail, will stay magnetized, but can also be demagnetized with little difficulty. Once running, the rotor poles stay in place; they do not drift.

Low-power synchronous timing motors (such as those for traditional electric clocks) may have multi-pole permanent magnet external cup rotors, and use shading coils to provide starting torque. ''Telechron'' clock motors have shaded poles for starting torque, and a two-spoke ring rotor that performs like a discrete two-pole rotor.

===Doubly-fed electric machine===
{{Main|Doubly-fed electric machine}}

Doubly fed electric motors have two independent multiphase winding sets, which contribute active (i.e., working) power to the energy conversion process, with at least one of the winding sets electronically controlled for variable speed operation. Two independent multiphase winding sets (i.e., dual armature) are the maximum provided in a single package without topology duplication. Doubly-fed electric motors are machines with an effective constant torque speed range that is twice synchronous speed for a given frequency of excitation. This is twice the constant torque speed range as [[singly-fed electric machine]]s, which have only one active winding set.

A doubly-fed motor allows for a smaller electronic converter but the cost of the rotor winding and slip rings may offset the saving in the power electronics components. Difficulties with controlling speed near synchronous speed limit applications.&lt;ref name="Lander (1993)"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Lander|first=Cyril W.|title=§9–8 'Slip Ring Induction Motor Control' in Chapter 9 - A.C.

==Special magnetic motors==

===Rotary===

====Ironless or coreless rotor motor====
[[File:Miniature Coreless DC Motor.jpg|thumb|A miniature coreless motor]]
Nothing in the principle of any of the motors described above requires that the iron (steel) portions of the rotor actually rotate. If the soft magnetic material of the rotor is made in the form of a cylinder, then (except for the effect of hysteresis) torque is exerted only on the windings of the electromagnets. Taking advantage of this fact is the ''coreless or ironless DC motor'', a specialized form of a permanent magnet DC motor.&lt;ref name="Weiβmantel (2008)"/&gt; Optimized for rapid [[acceleration]], these motors have a rotor that is constructed without any iron core. The rotor can take the form of a winding-filled cylinder, or a self-supporting structure comprising only the magnet wire and the bonding material. The rotor can fit inside the stator magnets; a magnetically soft stationary cylinder inside the rotor provides a return path for the stator magnetic flux. A second arrangement has the rotor winding basket surrounding the stator magnets. In that design, the rotor fits inside a magnetically soft cylinder that can serve as the housing for the motor, and likewise provides a return path for the flux.

Because the rotor is much lighter in weight (mass) than a conventional rotor formed from copper windings on steel laminations, the rotor can accelerate much more rapidly, often achieving a mechanical [[time constant]] under one ms. This is especially true if the windings use aluminum rather than the heavier copper. But because there is no metal mass in the rotor to act as a heat sink, even small coreless motors must often be cooled by forced air. Overheating might be an issue for coreless DC motor designs. Modern software, such as [[Motor-CAD]], can help to increase the thermal efficiency of motors while still in the design stage.

Among these types are the disc-rotor types, described in more detail in the next section.

The [[vibrating alert]] of cellular phones is sometimes generated by tiny cylindrical permanent-magnet field types, but there are also disc-shaped types that have a thin multipolar disc field magnet, and an intentionally unbalanced molded-plastic rotor structure with two bonded coreless coils. Metal brushes and a flat commutator switch power to the rotor coils.

Related limited-travel actuators have no core and a bonded coil placed between the poles of high-flux thin permanent magnets. These are the fast head positioners for rigid-disk ("hard disk") drives. Although the contemporary design differs considerably from that of loudspeakers, it is still loosely (and incorrectly) referred to as a "voice coil" structure, because some earlier rigid-disk-drive heads moved in straight lines, and had a drive structure much like that of a loudspeaker.

====Pancake or axial rotor motor====
The printed armature or pancake motor has the windings shaped as a disc running between arrays of high-flux magnets. The magnets are arranged in a circle facing the rotor with space in between to form an axial air gap.&lt;ref name="Krishnan (1987)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krishnan|first=R.|title=Selection Criteria for Servo Motor Drives|journal=IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications|date=March 1987|volume=IA-23|issue=2|pages=270–275|doi=10.1109/TIA.1987.4504902|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=4504902&amp;contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines&amp;sortType%3Ddesc_p_Publication_Year%26searchField%3DSearch_All%26queryText%3Dpancake+DC+motor|accessdate=26 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515051920/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=4504902&amp;contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines&amp;sortType%3Ddesc_p_Publication_Year%26searchField%3DSearch_All%26queryText%3Dpancake+DC+motor|archivedate=15 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design is commonly known as the pancake motor because of its flat profile. The technology has had many brand names since its inception, such as ServoDisc.

The printed armature (originally formed on a printed circuit board) in a printed armature motor is made from punched copper sheets that are laminated together using advanced composites to form a thin rigid disc. The printed armature has a unique construction in the brushed motor world in that it does not have a separate ring commutator. The brushes run directly on the armature surface making the whole design very compact.

An alternative manufacturing method is to use wound copper wire laid flat with a central conventional commutator, in a flower and petal shape. The windings are typically stabilized with electrical epoxy potting systems. These are filled epoxies that have moderate, mixed viscosity and a long gel time. They are highlighted by low shrinkage and low exotherm, and are typically UL 1446 recognized as a potting compound insulated with 180&amp;nbsp;°C, Class H rating.

The unique advantage of ironless DC motors is the absence of [[Cogging torque|cogging]] (torque variations caused by changing attraction between the iron and the magnets). Parasitic eddy currents cannot form in the rotor as it is totally ironless, although iron rotors are laminated. This can greatly improve efficiency, but variable-speed controllers must use a higher switching rate (&gt;40&amp;nbsp;kHz) or DC because of decreased [[electromagnetic induction]].

These motors were originally invented to drive the capstan(s) of magnetic tape drives, where minimal time to reach operating speed and minimal stopping distance were critical. Pancake motors are widely used in high-performance servo-controlled systems, robotic systems, industrial automation and medical devices. Due to the variety of constructions now available, the technology is used in applications from high temperature military to low cost pump and basic servos.

Another approach (Magnax) is to use a single stator sandwiched between two rotors. One such design has produced peak power of 15 kW/kg, sustained power around 7.5 kW/kg. This yokeless axial flux motor offers a shorter flux path, keeping the magnets further from the axis. The design allows zero winding overhang; 100 percent of the windings are active. This is enhanced with the use of rectangular-section copper wire. The motors can be stacked to work in parallel. Instabilities are minimized by ensuring that the two rotor discs put equal and opposing forces onto the stator disc. The rotors are connected directly to one another via a shaft ring, cancelling out the magnetic forces.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newatlas.com/magnax-axial-flux-electric-motor/54821|title=Magnax prepares to manufacture radically high-powered, compact axial flux electric motor|last=Blain|first=Loz|date=May 30, 2018|website=newatlas.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnax motors range in size from {{Convert|.15-5.4|m|}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Servo motor ====
{{Main|Servo motor}}
A servomotor is a motor, very often sold as a complete module, which is used within a position-control or speed-control feedback control system. Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended for use in a servomechanism must have well-documented characteristics for speed, torque, and power. The speed vs. torque curve is quite important and is high ratio for a servo motor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are also important; these factors limit the overall performance of the servomechanism loop. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional AC or DC motors and drive systems with position or speed feedback on the motor. As dynamic response requirements increase, more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used. AC motors' superior power density and acceleration characteristics compared to that of DC motors tends to favor permanent magnet synchronous, BLDC, induction, and SRM drive applications.&lt;ref name="Krishnan (1987)"/&gt;

A servo system differs from some stepper motor applications in that the position feedback is continuous while the motor is running. A stepper system inherently operates open-loop - relying on the motor not to "miss steps" for short term accuracy - with any feedback such as a "home" switch or position encoder being external to the motor system.&lt;ref name="Patrick (1997)"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Patrick|first=Dale R.|author2=Fardo, Stephen W.|booktitle=Rotating Electrical Machines and Power Systems|edition=2nd|year=1997|publisher=Fairmont Press, Inc.|isbn=978-0-88173-239-9|title=Chapter 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, when a typical dot matrix computer printer starts up, its controller makes the print head stepper motor drive to its left-hand limit, where a position sensor defines home position and stops stepping. As long as power is on, a bidirectional counter in the printer's microprocessor keeps track of print-head position.

====Stepper motor====
{{Main|Stepper motor}}
[[File:Stepper motor.svg|thumb|A stepper motor with a soft iron rotor, with active windings shown. In 'A' the active windings tend to hold the rotor in position. In 'B' a different set of windings are carrying a current, which generates torque and rotation.]]
Stepper motors are a type of motor frequently used when precise rotations are required. In a stepper motor an internal rotor containing permanent magnets or a magnetically soft rotor with salient poles is controlled by a set of external magnets that are switched electronically. A stepper motor may also be thought of as a cross between a DC electric motor and a rotary solenoid. As each coil is energized in turn, the rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field produced by the energized field winding. Unlike a synchronous motor, in its application, the stepper motor may not rotate continuously; instead, it "steps"—starts and then quickly stops again—from one position to the next as field windings are energized and de-energized in sequence. Depending on the sequence, the rotor may turn forwards or backwards, and it may change direction, stop, speed up or slow down arbitrarily at any time.

Simple stepper motor drivers entirely energize or entirely de-energize the field windings, leading the rotor to "cog" to a limited number of positions; more sophisticated drivers can proportionally control the power to the field windings, allowing the rotors to position between the cog points and thereby rotate extremely smoothly. This mode of operation is often called [[stepper motor#Microstepping|microstepping]]. Computer controlled stepper motors are one of the most versatile forms of positioning systems, particularly when part of a digital [[servomechanism|servo-controlled]] system.

Stepper motors can be rotated to a specific angle in discrete steps with ease, and hence stepper motors are used for read/write head positioning in computer floppy diskette drives. They were used for the same purpose in pre-gigabyte era computer disk drives, where the precision and speed they offered was adequate for the correct positioning of the read/write head of a hard disk drive. As drive density increased, the precision and speed limitations of stepper motors made them obsolete for hard drives—the precision limitation made them unusable, and the speed limitation made them uncompetitive—thus newer hard disk drives use voice coil-based head actuator systems. (The term "voice coil" in this connection is historic; it refers to the structure in a typical (cone type) loudspeaker. This structure was used for a while to position the heads. Modern drives have a pivoted coil mount; the coil swings back and forth, something like a blade of a rotating fan. Nevertheless, like a voice coil, modern actuator coil conductors (the magnet wire) move perpendicular to the magnetic lines of force.)

Stepper motors were and still are often used in computer printers, optical scanners, and digital photocopiers to move the optical scanning element, the print head carriage (of dot matrix and inkjet printers), and the platen or feed rollers. Likewise, many computer plotters (which since the early 1990s have been replaced with large-format inkjet and laser printers) used rotary stepper motors for pen and platen movement; the typical alternatives here were either linear stepper motors or servomotors with closed-loop analog control systems.

So-called quartz analog wristwatches contain the smallest commonplace stepping motors; they have one coil, draw very little power, and have a permanent magnet rotor. The same kind of motor drives battery-powered quartz clocks. Some of these watches, such as chronographs, contain more than one stepping motor.

Closely related in design to three-phase AC synchronous motors, stepper motors and SRMs are classified as variable reluctance motor type.{{Sfn|Bose|2006|pp=569–570, 891}} Stepper motors were and still are often used in computer printers, optical scanners, and [[Numerical control|computer numerical control (CNC)]] machines such as routers, plasma cutters and CNC lathes.

===Linear motor===
{{Main|Linear motor}}
A linear motor is essentially any electric motor that has been "unrolled" so that, instead of producing a [[torque]] (rotation), it produces a straight-line force along its length.

Linear motors are most commonly [[linear induction motor|induction motors]] or stepper motors. Linear motors are commonly found in many roller-coasters where the rapid motion of the motorless railcar is controlled by the rail. They are also used in [[maglev train]]s, where the train "flies" over the ground. On a smaller scale, the 1978 era HP 7225A pen plotter used two linear stepper motors to move the pen along the X and Y axes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fenoglio|first=John A.|author2=Chin, Bessie W.

==Electromagnetism==
{{expand section|date=March 2013}}

===Force and torque===
The fundamental purpose of the vast majority of the world's electric motors is to electromagnetically induce relative movement in an air gap between a stator and rotor to produce useful torque or linear force.

According to [[Lorentz force law#Force on a current-carrying wire|Lorentz force law]] the force of a winding conductor can be given simply by:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = I \boldsymbol{\ell} \times \mathbf{B} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
or more generally, to handle conductors with any geometry:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;
The most general approaches to calculating the forces in motors use tensors.&lt;ref name="Kirtley (2005)"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Kirtley|first=James L., Jr.|booktitle=6.6585 - Electric Machines|title=Class Notes 1: Electromagnetic Forces|publisher=MIT Dept of Electrical Engineering|accessdate=15 March 2013|url=http://web.mit.edu/course/6/6.685/www/chapter1.pdf|year=2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104210907/http://web.mit.edu/course/6/6.685/www/chapter1.pdf|archivedate=4 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power===
Where [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] is shaft speed and T is [[torque]], a motor's mechanical power output P&lt;sub&gt;em&lt;/sub&gt; is given by,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/ph/p/id/46|title = DC Motor Calculations, part 1|date = 30 November 2011|publisher = National Instruments|accessdate = 7 December 2012|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012234329/http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/ph/p/id/46|archivedate = 12 October 2007|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

in British units with T expressed in foot-pounds,
:&lt;math&gt;P_{em} = \frac {rpm \times T}{5252}&lt;/math&gt; (horsepower), and,
in [[International System of Units|SI units]] with shaft [[Angular frequency|angular speed]] expressed in radians per second, and T expressed in newton-meters,
:&lt;math&gt;P_{em} = {angular speed \times T}&lt;/math&gt; (watts).

For a linear motor, with force F expressed in newtons and velocity v expressed in meters per second,
:&lt;math&gt;P_{em} = F\times{v}&lt;/math&gt; (watts).

In an asynchronous or induction motor, the relationship between motor speed and air gap power is, neglecting [[skin effect]], given by the following:
:&lt;math&gt;P_{airgap}=\frac{R_r}{s} * I_r^{2}&lt;/math&gt;, where
::R&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; - rotor resistance
::I&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - square of current induced in the rotor
::s - motor slip; i.e., difference between synchronous speed and slip speed, which provides the relative movement needed for current induction in the rotor.

===Back emf===
{{Main|Electromotive force}}
Since the armature windings of a direct-current or universal motor are moving through a magnetic field, they have a voltage induced in them. This voltage tends to oppose the motor supply voltage and so is called "[[electromotive force|back electromotive force (emf)]]". The voltage is proportional to the running speed of the motor. The back emf of the motor, plus the voltage drop across the winding internal resistance and brushes, must equal the voltage at the brushes. This provides the fundamental mechanism of speed regulation in a DC motor. If the mechanical load increases, the motor slows down; a lower back emf results, and more current is drawn from the supply. This increased current provides the additional torque to balance the new load.&lt;ref name="Dwight (1949)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dwight|first=Herbert B.|last2=Fink |first2=D. G.|title=§27 to §35A Electromagnetic Induction of EMF in Sec. 2 - Electric and Magnetic Circuits|pages=36–41}} in {{harvnb|Knowlton|1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In AC machines, it is sometimes useful to consider a back emf source within the machine; as an example, this is of particular concern for close speed regulation of induction motors on VFDs.&lt;ref name="Dwight (1949)"/&gt;

===Losses===
[[Losses in electrical systems|Motor losses]] are mainly due to [[Joule heating|resistive losses]] in windings, core losses and mechanical losses in bearings, and aerodynamic losses, particularly where cooling fans are present, also occur.

Losses also occur in commutation, mechanical commutators spark, and electronic commutators and also dissipate heat.

===Efficiency===
To calculate a motor's efficiency, the mechanical output power is divided by the electrical input power:
:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac{P_m}{P_e}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is [[energy conversion efficiency]], &lt;math&gt;P_e&lt;/math&gt; is electrical input power, and &lt;math&gt;P_m&lt;/math&gt; is mechanical output power:

:&lt;math&gt;P_e = I V&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P_m = T \omega&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is input voltage, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is input current, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is output torque, and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is output angular velocity. It is possible to derive analytically the point of maximum efficiency. It is typically at less than 1/2 the [[stall torque]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Various regulatory authorities in many countries have introduced and implemented legislation to encourage the manufacture and use of higher-efficiency electric motors.

===Goodness factor===
{{main|Goodness factor}}
[[Eric Laithwaite]]&lt;ref name=Laithwaite&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laithwaite|first=E.R.|title=Linear electric machines - A personal view|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|date=February 1975|volume=63|issue=2|pages=250–290|doi=10.1109/PROC.1975.9734|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1451664&amp;contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines&amp;queryText%3DLinear+Electric+Machines-+A+Personal+View|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515032704/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1451664&amp;contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines&amp;queryText%3DLinear+Electric+Machines-+A+Personal+View|archivedate=2013-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a metric to determine the 'goodness' of an electric motor:&lt;ref name="Patterson (2003)"&gt;{{cite conference|title=The "Goodness" of Small Contemporary Permanent Magnet Electric Machines|last=Patterson|first=D.

&lt;math&gt;G = \frac {\omega} {resistance \times reluctance} = \frac {\omega \mu \sigma A_m A_e} {l_m l_e}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the goodness factor (factors above 1 are likely to be efficient)
:&lt;math&gt;A_m, A_e&lt;/math&gt; are the cross sectional areas of the magnetic and electric circuit
:&lt;math&gt;l_m, l_e&lt;/math&gt; are the lengths of the magnetic and electric circuits
:&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the permeability of the core
:&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the angular frequency the motor is driven at

From this, he showed that the most efficient motors are likely to have relatively large magnetic poles. However, the equation only directly relates to non PM motors.

==Performance parameters==

===Torque capability of motor types===
{{generalize|section|date=March 2012}}
All the electromagnetic motors, and that includes the types mentioned here derive the torque from the vector product of the interacting fields. For calculating the torque it is necessary to know the fields in the air gap. Once these have been established by mathematical analysis using FEA or other tools the torque may be calculated as the integral of all the vectors of force multiplied by the radius of each vector. The current flowing in the winding is producing the fields and for a motor using a magnetic material the field is not linearly proportional to the current. This makes the calculation difficult but a computer can do the many calculations needed.

Once this is done a figure relating the current to the torque can be used as a useful parameter for motor selection. The maximum torque for a motor will depend on the maximum current although this will usually be only usable until thermal considerations take precedence.

When optimally designed within a given core saturation constraint and for a given active current (i.e., torque current), voltage, pole-pair number, excitation frequency (i.e., synchronous speed), and air-gap flux density, all categories of electric motors or generators will exhibit virtually the same maximum continuous shaft torque (i.e., operating torque) within a given air-gap area with winding slots and back-iron depth, which determines the physical size of electromagnetic core. Some applications require bursts of torque beyond the maximum operating torque, such as short bursts of torque to accelerate an electric vehicle from standstill. Always limited by [[Saturation (magnetic)|magnetic core saturation]] or safe [[operating temperature]] rise and voltage, the capacity for torque bursts beyond the maximum operating torque differs significantly between categories of electric motors or generators.

Capacity for bursts of torque should not be confused with field weakening capability. Field weakening allows an electric machine to operate beyond the designed frequency of excitation. Field weakening is done when the maximum speed cannot be reached by increasing the applied voltage. This applies to only motors with current controlled fields and therefore cannot be achieved with permanent magnet motors.

Electric machines without a transformer circuit topology, such as that of WRSMs or PMSMs, cannot realize bursts of torque higher than the maximum designed torque without saturating the magnetic core and rendering any increase in current as useless. Furthermore, the permanent magnet assembly of PMSMs can be irreparably damaged, if bursts of torque exceeding the maximum operating torque rating are attempted.

Electric machines with a transformer circuit topology, such as induction machines, induction doubly-fed electric machines, and induction or synchronous wound-rotor doubly-fed (WRDF) machines, exhibit very high bursts of torque because the emf-induced active current on either side of the transformer oppose each other and thus contribute nothing to the transformer coupled magnetic core flux density, which would otherwise lead to core saturation.

Electric machines that rely on induction or asynchronous principles short-circuit one port of the transformer circuit and as a result, the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit becomes dominant as slip increases, which limits the magnitude of active (i.e., real) current. Still, bursts of torque that are two to three times higher than the maximum design torque are realizable.

The brushless wound-rotor synchronous doubly-fed (BWRSDF) machine is the only electric machine with a truly dual ported transformer circuit topology (i.e., both ports independently excited with no short-circuited port).&lt;ref name="Klatt (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klatt|first=Frederick W.|title=Sensorless Real Time Control (RTC): Brushless Wound-Rotor [Synchronous] Doubly-Fed Machine|journal=Sensorless Control for Electrical Drives -SLED 2012|date=September 2012|doi=10.1109/SLED.2012.6422811|publisher=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dual ported transformer circuit topology is known to be unstable and requires a multiphase slip-ring-brush assembly to propagate limited power to the rotor winding set. If a precision means were available to instantaneously control torque angle and slip for synchronous operation during motoring or generating while simultaneously providing brushless power to the rotor winding set, the active current of the BWRSDF machine would be independent of the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit and bursts of torque significantly higher than the maximum operating torque and far beyond the practical capability of any other type of electric machine would be realizable. Torque bursts greater than eight times operating torque have been calculated.

===Continuous torque density===
The continuous torque density of conventional electric machines is determined by the size of the air-gap area and the back-iron depth, which are determined by the power rating of the armature winding set, the speed of the machine, and the achievable air-gap flux density before core saturation. Despite the high coercivity of neodymium or samarium-cobalt permanent magnets, continuous torque density is virtually the same amongst electric machines with optimally designed armature winding sets. Continuous torque density relates to method of cooling and permissible period of operation before destruction by overheating of windings or permanent magnet damage.

Other sources state that various e-machine topologies have differing torque density.  One source shows the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=BYkwEsmHqKYCPropulsion|page=68}}|title=Propulsion Systems for Hybrid Vehicles|last=Miller|first=John M.|date=2008|publisher=IET|year=|isbn=9780863419157|location=|pages=68, 69|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|VRM, doubly salient reluctance machine||0.7-1.0
|}
where — specific torque density is normalized to 1.0 for the SPM — brushless ac, 180° current conduction, SPM is Surface Permanent Magnet machine.

Torque density is approximately four times greater for electric motors which are liquid cooled, as compared to those which are air cooled.

A source comparing direct current (DC), induction motors (IM), permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) and switched reluctance motors (SRM) showed:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=HxdHDgAAQBAJPower|page=1042}}|title=Power Electronics Handbook|last=Rashid|first=Muhammad H.|date=2017-09-09|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=|isbn=9780128114087|location=|pages=1042|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuous power density===
The continuous power density is determined by the product of the continuous torque density and the constant torque speed range of the electric machine.

==Acoustic noise and vibrations==
Acoustic noise and vibrations of electric motors are usually classified in three sources:
* mechanical sources (e.g. due to [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]])
* aerodynamic sources (e.g. due to shaft-mounted [[fan (machine)|fans]])
* magnetic sources (e.g. due to magnetic forces such as [[Maxwell stress tensor|Maxwell]] and [[magnetostriction]] forces acting on stator and rotor structures)
The latter source, which can be responsible for the "whining noise" of electric motors, is called [[electromagnetically-excited acoustic noise and vibration|electromagnetically-excited acoustic noise]].

==Non-magnetic motors==
{{Main|Electrostatic motor|Piezoelectric motor|Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion}}

An electrostatic motor is based on the attraction and repulsion of electric charge. Usually, electrostatic motors are the dual of conventional coil-based motors. They typically require a high-voltage power supply, although very small motors employ lower voltages. Conventional electric motors instead employ magnetic attraction and repulsion, and require high current at low voltages. In the 1750s, the first electrostatic motors were developed by Benjamin Franklin and Andrew Gordon. Today, the electrostatic motor finds frequent use in micro-electro-mechanical systems ([[MEMS]]) where their drive voltages are below 100 volts, and where moving, charged plates are far easier to fabricate than coils and iron cores. Also, the molecular machinery that runs living cells is often based on linear and rotary electrostatic motors.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

A piezoelectric motor or piezo motor is a type of electric motor based upon the change in shape of a [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric material]] when an [[electric field]] is applied. Piezoelectric motors make use of the converse piezoelectric effect whereby the material produces acoustic or [[ultrasonic motor|ultrasonic]] vibrations to produce linear or rotary motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=IdCg2dDZQr8C|page=38}}|title=Ultra-fast Material Metrology|last=Horn|first=Alexander|date=2009-07-30|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9783527627936|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one mechanism, the elongation in a single plane is used to make a series stretches and position holds, similar to the way a caterpillar moves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shafik|first1=Amro|last2=Ben Mrad|first2=Ridha|title=Nanopositioning Technologies: Fundamentals and Applications|date=2016|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-23853-1|page=39|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-23853-1_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These program unique specifications form the core of the configuration baselines. As shown here, in addition to referring to different levels within the system hierarchy, these baselines are defined at different phases of the design process.Note: There is one minor (and ironic) typo in the image above.  SI&amp;T is "System Integration and Test" not "System Integration and Text". ]]

{{software development process}}
A '''functional specification''' (also, ''functional spec'', ''specs'', ''functional specifications document (FSD)'', ''functional requirements specification'') in [[systems engineering]] and [[software development]] is a document that specifies the functions that a system or component must perform (often part of a requirements specification) (ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765-2010).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50518 ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2010 Systems and software engineering — Vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentation typically describes what is needed by the system user as well as requested properties of inputs and outputs (e.g. of the [[software]] system). A functional specification is the more technical response to a matching requirements document, e.g. the [[Product requirements document|Product Requirement Document]] "PRD"{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}. Thus it picks up the results of the [[requirements analysis]] stage. On more complex systems multiple levels of functional specifications will typically nest to each other, e.g. on the system level, on the module level and on the level of technical details.

== Overview ==
A [[function (engineering)|functional]] specification does not define the inner workings of the proposed system; it does not include the specification of how the system function will be implemented.  Instead, it focuses on what various outside agents (people using the program, computer peripherals, or other computers, for example) might "observe" when interacting with the system.

A functional requirement in a functional specification might state as follows:

:''When the user clicks the OK button, the dialog is closed and the focus is returned to the main window in the state it was in before this dialog was displayed.''

Such a requirement describes an interaction between an external agent (the [[User (computing)|user]]) and the software system.  When the user provides input to the system by clicking the OK button, the program responds (or should respond) by closing the dialog window containing the OK button.

== Functional specification topics ==

=== Purpose ===
There are many purposes for functional specifications. One of the primary purposes on team projects is to achieve some form of team consensus on what the program is to achieve before making the more time-consuming effort of writing [[source code]] and [[test case]]s, followed by a period of [[debugging]].  Typically, such consensus is reached after one or more reviews by the [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s on the project at hand after having negotiated a cost-effective way to achieve the requirements the software needs to fulfill.

# To let the [[Software developer|developers]] know what to build. 
# To let the [[testers]] know what tests to run.
# To let [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s know what they are getting.

=== Process ===
In the ordered industrial software engineering life-cycle ([[waterfall model]]), functional specification describes ''what'' has to be implemented. The next, [[Systems architecture]] document describes ''how'' the functions will be realized using a chosen software environment. In non industrial, prototypical systems development, functional specifications are typically written after or as part of [[requirements analysis]].

When the team agrees that functional specification consensus is reached, the functional spec is typically declared "complete" or "signed off".  After this, typically the software development and testing team write source code and test cases using the functional specification as the reference.  While testing is performed, the behavior of the program is compared against the expected behavior as defined in the functional specification.

=== Methods ===
One popular method of writing a functional specification document involves drawing or rendering either simple wire frames or accurate, graphically designed UI screenshots. After this has been completed, and the screen examples are approved by all stakeholders, graphical elements can be numbered and written instructions can be added for each number on the screen example. For example, a login screen can have the username field labeled '1' and password field labeled '2,' and then each number can be declared in writing, for use by software engineers and later for beta testing purposes to ensure that functionality is as intended. The benefit of this method is that countless additional details can be attached to the screen examples.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10909">'''Gender history''' is a sub-field of [[history]] and [[gender studies]], which looks at the past from the perspective of [[gender]]. It is in many ways, an outgrowth of [[women's history]]. The discipline considers in what ways historical events and periodization impact women differently from men. For instance, in an influential article in 1977, "Did Women have a Renaissance?", [[Joan Kelly]] questioned whether the notion of a Renaissance was relevant to women.&lt;ref name = "kelly"&gt;"Did Women have a Renaissance?" ''Becoming Visible: Women in European History''. Houghton Mifflin, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Gender historians are also interested in how gender difference has been perceived and configured at different times and places, usually with the assumption that such differences are socially constructed. These social constructions of gender throughout time are also represented as changes in the expected norms of behavior for those labeled male or female. Those who study gender history note these changes in norms and those performing them over time and interpret what those changes say about the larger social/cultural/political climate. 

==Impact==
Despite its relatively short life, gender history (and its forerunner women's history) has had a rather significant effect on the general study of [[history]]. Since the 1960s, when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance, it has gone through a number of different phases, each with its own challenges and outcomes, but always making an impact of some kind on the historical discipline. Although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious, such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession, other influences are more subtle, even though they may be more politically groundbreaking in the end. By 1970, gender historians turned to documenting ordinary women's expectations, aspirations and status. In the 80s with the rise of the feminist movement, the focus shifted to uncovering women' oppression and discrimination. Nowadays, gender history is more about charting female agency and recognizing female achievements in several fields that were usually dominated by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Focus/Gender/articles.html|title=History in Focus: articles on gender history|website=www.history.ac.uk|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Within the profession===
According to historian [[Joan Wallach Scott|Joan Scott]], conflict occurred between Women's History [[List of historians|historians]] and other historians in a number of ways.&lt;ref name = "scott"&gt;"Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis," [[American Historical Review]]
91, No. 5 (December 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[American Historical Association]], when [[feminism|feminists]] argued that female historians were treated unequally within the field and underrepresented in the association, they were essentially leveling charges of historical negligence by traditional historians. Notions of [[professional]]ism were not rejected outright, but they were accused of being biased.

===Supplementary history===
According to Scott, the construction of Women's History as "supplementary" to the rest of history had a similar effect. At first glance, a supplement simply adds information which has been missing from the greater story, but as Scott points out, it also questions why the information was left out in the first place. Whenever it is noticed that a woman found to be missing from [[recorded history|written history]], Women's History first describes her role, second, examines which mechanisms allowed her role to be omitted, and third, asks to what other information these mechanisms were blind.

===Gender theory===
Finally, the advent of [[gender studies|gender theory]] once again challenged commonly held ideas of the discipline, including those scholars studying Women's History. [[Postmodernism|Post-modern]] criticism of essentialising [[social construction|socially constructed]] groups, be they [[gender]] groups or otherwise, pointed out the weaknesses in various sorts of history. In the past, [[historian]]s have attempted to describe the shared experience of large numbers of people, as though these people and their experiences were homogeneous and uniform. Women have multiple identities, influenced by any number of factors including [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[Social class|class]], and any examination of history which conflates their experiences, fails to provide an accurate picture.

==History of Masculinity==
The history of masculinity emerged as a specialty in the 1990s, evidenced by numerous studies of men in groups, and how concepts of masculinity shape their values and behavior. Gail Bederman identified two approaches: one that emerged from women's history and one that ignored it:
:Two types of ‘men’s history’ are being written these days. One builds on twenty years of women’s history scholarship, analyzing masculinity as part of larger gender and cultural processes. The other . . . looks to the past to see how men in early generations understood (and misunderstood) themselves as men. Books of the second type mostly ignore women’s history findings and methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Bederman, ''Journal of American History'' 84 (1997) p. 680&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender in religion ==
All over the world, religion is formed around a divine, supernatural figure. While the idea of the divine, supernatural figure varies from religion to religion, each one is framed around different concepts of what it means to be male and female. Furthermore, the religion of a culture usually directly corresponds or is influenced by the culture's gender structure, like the family structures and/or the state. Therefore the religious structure and the gender structure work together to form and define a culture, creating the defining structures of equality and uniformity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in History: Global Perspectives|last=Wiesner-Hanks|first=Merry E|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-8995-8|location=Malden, MA|pages=109,110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''General chemistry'''
(sometimes called "gen chem" for short) is a course often taught at the high school and introductory university level. It is intended to serve as a broad introduction to a variety of concepts in [[chemistry]] and is widely taught. At the university level, it is also sometimes used as a "weed out" course for disciplines (sometimes related, sometimes not) which are perceived to require a high level of intellectual rigor or large course loads. It is also one of the few chemistry courses in most universities that does not explicitly explore a particular discipline such as [[organic chemistry]] or [[analytical chemistry]].

General chemistry courses typically introduce concepts such as [[stoichiometry]], prediction of reaction products, [[thermodynamics]], [[nuclear chemistry]], [[electrochemistry]], [[chemical kinetics]], and many of the rudiments of [[physical chemistry]]. Though the list of subjects covered is typically broad, leading some to criticize both the class and the discipline as encouraging memorization, most general chemistry courses are firmly grounded in several fundamental physical rules for which the primary challenge is understanding when the rules are applicable.

== Concepts Taught ==
The concepts taught in a typical general chemistry course are as follows:
*[[Stoichiometry]]
*[[Conservation of energy]]
*[[Conservation of mass]]
*[[Atom|Elementary atomic theory]]
*[[Periodic table|Periodic table and periodicity]]
*[[Law of constant composition]]
*[[Gas law]]s
*[[Nuclear chemistry]]
*[[Solubility]]
*[[Acid-base chemistry]]
*[[Chemical bonding]]
*[[Chemical kinetics]]
*[[Thermodynamics]]
*[[Electrochemistry]]
*[[Chemical equilibrium|Chemical equilibria]]

However, a distinguishing feature of hypsos in [[rhetoric]]al studies is that it “combines conflicting [[emotion]]s: fear and [[awe]], [[wikt:Special:Search/horror|horror]] and fascinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eck|first=Caroline van|title=Translations of the Sublime: The Early Modern Reception and Dissemination of Longinus' Peri Hupsous in Rhetoric, the Visual Arts, Architecture and the Theatre|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|pages=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;” It is a [[Climax (rhetoric)|climactic]] moment in speech that generates uncertainty for the audience.

==Longinus and hypsos==
The ancient Greek rhetoric teacher [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]] introduced the concept of hypsos in the only significant piece of literature that he is known for having written during his lifetime, ''[[On the Sublime#The Treatise On the Sublime|On the Sublime]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Longinus|first=Cassius|title=Longinus On the Sublime|year=1867|publisher=T. &amp; G. Shrimpton|location=The University of Michigan|pages=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;''. In his work, Longinus prompted the possibilities and freedom that [[speech]] could possess by presenting hypsos. Longinus’ theories and concepts differed greatly from other Greek rhetoricians and [[philosopher]]s, and challenged the traditional rigid structure of rhetorical practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Gorman|first=Ned|title=Longinus's Sublime Rhetoric, or How Rhetoric Game into Its Own|journal=Rhetoric Society Quarterly|year=2004|issue=34.2|pages=71–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Long-term effects of hypsos==
Hypsos is studied by present-day [[rhetorician]]s, and is often referred to through the publication of ''Translations of the Sublime: The Early Modern Reception and Dissemination of Longinus: [[On the Sublime|Peri Hupsous]] in Rhetoric, the [[Visual Arts]], Architecture, and the Theatre''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eck|first=Caroline van|title=Translations of the Sublime: The Early Modern Reception and Dissemination of Longinus' Peri Hupsous in Rhetoric, the Visual Arts, Architecture and the Theatre|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|pages=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a collection of volumes of Longinus’ [[essay]]s. It stands as one of few pieces that explore the ways in which hypsos (which Longinus refers to as “the sublime in one single thought”) is used not only in rhetoric and literature, but also in the visual arts, architecture, and theater.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8859">'''Immaterial labor''' is a [[Marxist]], [[Autonomism|Autonomist]] framework to describe how value is produced from affective and [[Cognition|cognitive]] activities, which, in various ways, are [[commodification|commodified]] in [[capitalism|capitalist]] economies. The concept of immaterial labor was coined by Italian sociologist and philosopher [[Maurizio Lazzarato]] in his 1996 essay "Immaterial Labor", published as a contribution to ''Radical Thought in Italy'' and edited by Virno and Hardt.&lt;ref name="VirnoHardt1996"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|last=Lazzarato|first = Maurizio|contribution=Immaterial labor|year=1996|title=Radical Thought in Italy : A Potential Politics|editor-last=Virno|editor-first=Paolo|editor2-last=Hardt|editor2-first=Michael|pages=142-157|publisher=University of Minnesota Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was re-published in 1997 as: ''Lavoro immateriale. Forme di vita e produzione di soggettività.'' (Ombre corte).&lt;ref&gt;Lazzarato, Maurizio, [http://www.generation-online.org/c/fcimmateriallabour3.htm "Immaterial Labor."]  Generation Online.&lt;/ref&gt; Lazzarato was a participant in the [[Autonomia Operaia]] group as a student in Padua in the 1970s, and is a member of the editorial group of the journal Multitudes. Post-Marxist scholars including [[Franco Berardi]], [[Antonio Negri]], [[Michael Hardt]], [[Judith Revel]], and [[Paolo Virno]], among others have also employed the concept.

==Areas of Application==
===Digital Capitalism===
Studies of immaterial labor have included analysis of high-technology industries, although immaterial labor is understood as a concept far pre-dating digital technologies, specifically in the performance of gender and domestic roles, and other aspects of [[Affective labor|affective]] and [[Cognition|cognitive]] work.&lt;ref name=Terranova&gt;Terranova, Tiziana. [http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/technocapitalism/voluntary "Free Labor: Producing Culture for the Digital Economy."] Electronic Book Review. June 20, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Themes commonly associated with immaterial labor in the context of the internet include: [[digital labor]], [[commons-based peer production]], and [[user-generated content]] production, which might include [[open source]], [[free software]], [[crowdsourcing]], and flexible licensing agreements, as well as the collapse of copyright amidst the ambiguities of sharing creative works in the digital age, digital care work, and other conditions produced by participation in social environments within the digital, [[knowledge economy]].&lt;ref name=Terranova /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bogost, Ian. [https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/hyperemployment-or-the-exhausting-work-of-the-technology-user/281149/ "Hyperemployment or the exhausting work of the technology user."] The Atlantic. November 08, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminism===
Feminism adopted discussions of immaterial labor to describe the alienating conditions and labors pertaining to care work, the performance of gender and domestic labor. The social-wage campaign, [[Wages for housework]], co-founded in 1972 in Italy, by [[Selma James]] called for a wage for domestic work amidst the uneven and gendered privatization of the labor of social production, where traditionally feminine roles like [[care work]] are undervalued.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nplusonemag.com/issue-17/reviews/more-smiles-more-money/ "More Smiles? More Money."] N+1 Magazine. Issue 17, Fall 2013. Dayna Tortorici.&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-colonial feminist writer Lisa Nakamura, and others have described immaterial labor in the performance of online identity, and racial identity and identity performance, or "avatarization of the self".&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, Lisa. 2002. Cybertypes: race, ethnicity, and identity on the Internet. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, Lisa. 2008. Digitizing race visual cultures of the Internet. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nakamura concerns herself with the role of women of color integrated, and often undermined, into the circuit of production. In "Indigenous Circuits: Navajo Women and the Racialization of Early Electronic Manufacture" Nakamura draws upon feminist theorist Donna Haraway's ''Cyborg Manifesto'' to understand the role of the production chain and a commodification of Navajo women textile work. This relationship between craft and industrial labor ties into larger concepts of gender stereotypes, surveillance, and the identity politics of globalization. Her historical research lends itself to this broader discussion, "They were cited as evidence that digital work—the work of the hand and its digits—could be painlessly transferred from the indigenous cultural context into the world of technological commercial innovation, benefiting both in the process." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nakamura|first=Lisa|date=2014-12-15|title=Indigenous Circuits: Navajo Women and the Racialization of Early Electronic Manufacture|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/563663|journal=American Quarterly|language=en|volume=66|issue=4|pages=919–941|doi=10.1353/aq.2014.0070|issn=1080-6490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consent agreements or contracts between social media and [[user-generated content]] platforms and their users have been proposed as a way of minimizing immaterial labor by allowing users to have more control over the use and circulation of the content, [[data]], and [[metadata]] they produce.

===Creative works===
The idea of "creative labor" has been analyzed in the context of immaterial labor.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Brouillette [http://www.mediationsjournal.org/articles/creative-labor "Creative Labor."] "Marxism and Literature Revisited." Vol. 24. No. 2., Spring, 2009. mediationsjournal.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jack Bratich, [http://www.ephemerajournal.org/contribution/digital-touch-craft-work-immaterial-labour-and-ontological-accumulation The digital touch: Craft-work as immaterial labour and ontological accumulation.] Ephemera: theory and politics in organization. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that the ubiquitous sharing enabled by the [[Information Age|digital age]] has made it harder for artists and creators to claim authorship of their works, creating an inevitable situation of immaterial labor in the participation in many online platforms.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Gill, and Andy Pratt. 2008. "In the Social Factory? : Immaterial Labour, Precariousness and Cultural Work". Theory, Culture &amp; Society. 25 (7-8): 1-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immeasurability===
As one cannot weigh or measure in any other way the effect of prayer, a smile, praise, compliment or pat on the shoulder - nor disdain - we are prone to discard any such effect.

Similarly (although teachers receive payment) education. (As one Harvard man once said: "If you think education is expensive - then try ignorance") Although affect may be immediate; effect could remain immeasurable.

Sharing a loaf of bread reduces the amount available for each; sharing knowledge only increases it.

==Criticism==

===Material vs. immaterial labor debate===
The [[materialism|material]] effects of what immaterial labor claims are [[cognitive]] and [[affective]] activities, has been consistently used to discredit the idea of immaterial labor.&lt;ref&gt;"Global Networks and the Materiality of Immaterial Labor" p. 50-121 in: Wilkie, Robert. 2011. The digital condition: class and culture in the information network. New York: Fordham University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the term have argued that, although labor might produce affective and cognitive commodities that can be defined as immaterial labors, it nonetheless is always embodied, maintaining correlates in the physical, material world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2013/11/29/femininity-as-technology/ "Femininity as Technology."] The Society Pages, Cyborgology. November 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Autonomist feminists have also taken issue with the use of the word "immaterial" to describe affective and [[care work]], which necessarily maintains an [[Affective labor|affective]] and embodied component.&lt;ref&gt;Lanoix, Monique. 2013. "Labor as Embodied Practice: The Lessons of Care Work". Hypatia. 28 (1): 85-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2372">'''Interpret Scotland''' is an inter-agency initiative between [[Scotland|Scottish]] organisations concerned with [[heritage interpretation]]. It was begun in 1997 and its key aims are to :

* Improve the quality and quantity of interpretation in Scotland
* Promote the co-ordination of interpretation at local and strategic level
* Share resources, expertise and experience to avoid duplicating effort

The Interpret Scotland journal, which is published twice a year, has been running since 2000 and includes articles on all facets of interpretation. Interpret Scotland can be credited with raising awareness of professional heritage interpretation within Scotland, particularly through inter-agency support and networking.

Together with the [[Association for Heritage Interpretation]], Interpret Scotland established a steering group which planned and carried out [[The Vital Spark Interpretation Conference]].

== List of members ==

The Interpret Scotland steering group has expanded over the years and currently consists of :-

* Association for Scottish Visitor Attractions
* [[Council for Scottish Archaeology]]
* [[Forestry Commission]] Scotland
* [[Highlands and Islands Enterprise]]
* [[Historic Scotland]]
* [[Museums Galleries Scotland]]
* [[National Archives of Scotland]]
* [[National Galleries of Scotland]]
* [[National Museums of Scotland]]
* [[The National Trust for Scotland]]
* [[Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh]]
* [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]]
* [[Scottish Enterprise]]
* [[Scottish Natural Heritage]]
* Scottish Tourist Guides Association
* [[Scottish Wildlife Trust]]
* [[VisitScotland]]

Male circumcision is widespread in Islam and accepted as established practice by all Islamic schools of jurisprudence.&lt;ref name="khitān"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/316661/khitan khitān] Encyclopædia Britannica (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a sign of belonging to the wider [[Islam]]ic community.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml   |title=Circumcision of boys |accessdate=2008-07-29 |work=Religion &amp; ethics&amp;mdash;Islam |publisher=BBC |date=2006-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qur'an itself does not mention circumcision explicitly in any verse. In the time of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], circumcision of men was carried out by most pagan [[Tribes of Arabia|Arabian tribes]] and [[female circumcision]] by some, and male circumcision by Jews for religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;W.

Many of his early disciples were circumcised to symbolize their inclusion within the emerging Islamic community.&lt;ref name="source"&gt;source?&lt;/ref&gt; Some accounts report that [[Heraclius]], Emperor of Byzantium, had referred to Muhammad as the "leader of the circumcised people".&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari, vol. 1, book 1, no. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Some hadith mentions circumcision in a list of practices known as ''[[fitra]]'' (acts considered to be of a refined person). Abu Hurayra, a companion of Muhammad, was quoted saying, "Five things are fitra: circumcision, shaving pubic hair with a razor, trimming the mustache, paring one's nails and plucking the hair from one's armpits" (reported in  the  ''hadiths'' of [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] and  [[Sahih Muslim]]). So, despite its absence from the Qur'an, it has been a [[Religious male circumcision|religious]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; custom from the beginning of Islam. However, there are other ''hadiths'' which do not name circumcision as part of the characteristics of ''fitra''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/bukhari/77/107|title=Hadith – Book of Dress – Sahih al-Bukhari – Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|publisher=sunnah.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; and yet another ''hadith'' which names ten characteristics, again without naming circumcision; in Sahih Muslim, Aisha is quoted "The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Ten are the acts according to fitra: clipping the mustache, letting the beard grow, using toothpicks, snuffing water in the nose, cutting the nails, washing the finger joints, plucking the hair under the armpits, shaving pubic hair and cleaning one's private parts with water. The narrator said: I have forgotten the tenth, but it may have been rinsing the mouth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/muslim/2/71|title=Hadith – The Book of Purification – Sahih Muslim – Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|publisher=sunnah.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the different hadiths do not agree on whether circumcision is part of fitra or not.

Muhammad's wife [[Aisha]] supposedly quotes Muhammad as saying that "[[ghusl|ablution]] becomes necessary if the two circumcised members touch".&lt;ref&gt;Malik ibn Anas, Ketab al-mowatta, Volume I, pages 45-47, traditions 70-75. ed. M.F. Abd-al-Baqi, Cairo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Majah, Kitab Sunan, ed. M. F. Abd-al-Baqi, Cairo, 1972, Page 199 Volume I&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, Muhammad is reported to have once advised a female circumciser not to cut off the entire clitoris during female circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;Page 28 of Volume VII of al-Hayawan by Jahiz, ed. A. M. Harun, 7 vols., Cairo, 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some ''hadith'', Muhammad supposedly circumcised his grandsons, [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]], on the seventh day after their birth.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Amili, Muhammad Ibn Hasan Al-Hur. Wasa'il al-shi'ah ila tahsil masa'il al-shariah. Vol 15. Tehran, Al-Maktabah al-Islamiyyah, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;
Sahih al-Bukhari and Muslim also quote from Muhammad that Prophet Abraham performed his own circumcision at the age of eighty.&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari Hadith No. 575, and Muslim's anthology of authentic hadith, IV, item 2370.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also reported by [[Abu Dawud]] and [[Ahmad Ibn Hanbal]] that Muhammad stated that circumcision was a "law for men and a preservation of honor for women".&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad Ibn Hanbal 5:75; Abu Dawud, Adab 167&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumcision was introduced to many lands for the first time through Islam itself following the Muslim conquests under the [[Rashidun]], who were the companions and contemporaries of Muhammad. An example are the [[Persian people|Persians]] who did not practice circumcision before the advent of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Iranica, Circumcision&lt;/ref&gt; Post-Islamic converts such as [[Afshin (Caliphate General)|Afshin]] were found guilty in trials of remaining uncircumcised;&lt;ref&gt;Page 766 of the Volume II of Al-Basaer wa al-Dhakha'ir, Abu Hayyan Tawhidi, Kaylānī, Damascus, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; this further indicates that the practice was deemed compulsory by the early Muslims.

===Sunni Islam===
Amongst ''[[Ulema]]'' (Muslim legal scholars), there are differing opinions about the compulsion of circumcision in ''[[Sharia]]'' (Islamic law). [[Imam]]s [[Abū Ḥanīfa]], founder of the [[Hanafi]] school of ''[[Fiqh]]'' (Islamic jurisprudence), and [[Malik ibn Anas]], maintain that circumcision is a ''[[Sunnah]] Mu'akkadah''—not obligatory but highly recommended. The [[Shafi‘i]] and [[Hanbali]] schools see it as binding on all Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545032 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530090925/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545032 |archivedate=2010-05-30 |title=Medical Ethics of Male Circumcision |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-05-30 |accessdate=2012-05-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shia Islam ===
Most Shia traditions regard the practice as obligatory. They rely on sayings that come from classical Shia authors.&lt;ref&gt;Book 90 of Hilyat ul-muttaqeen&lt;/ref&gt; In one narration Muhammad was asked if an uncircumcised man could go to pilgrimage. He answered "not as long as he is not circumcised". They quote [[Ali]] as saying: "If a man becomes Muslim, he must submit to circumcision even if he is 80 years old."&lt;ref&gt;Al-Kalini, Abu-Ja'afar Muhammad Ibn-Yaqub. Al-furu'min al-kafi. Vol. 6 Tehran: Dar al-kutub al-islamiyyah. 1981:35&lt;/ref&gt; Another narration from [[Ja'far al-Sadiq|Al-Sadiq]] says: "Circumcise your sons when they are seven days old as it is cleaner (athar) and the flesh grows faster and because the earth hates the urine of the uncircumcised."&lt;ref&gt;Al-Kalini, Abu-Ja'afar Muhammad Ibn-Yaqub. Al-furu'min al-kafi. Vol. 6 Tehran: Dar al-kutub al-islamiyyah. 1981:34&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed that the urine of the uncircumcised is impure, while if one prays with unclean genitals their prayer may not be considered as acceptable, even of those who have been circumcised, meaning that it may have to be repeated again at a time when the believer has purified themselves and removed the impurity. Another hadith of Muhammad states: "the earth cries out to God in anguish because of the urine of the uncircumcised", and that "the earth becomes defiled from the urine of the uncircumcised for forty days".&lt;ref&gt;DS Hellsten. Male and Female Circumcision: Medical, Legal and Ethical Considerations in Pediatric Practice. Page 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quranists===
Most [[Qur'an alone|Quranists]] claim circumcision is [[haram]], arguing that Quran {{Cite quran|4|119|s=ns|b=n}} forbids altering one's body, and {{Cite quran|95|4|s=ns|b=n}} says man was created perfectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quranicpath.com/misconceptions/circumcision.html |title=Circumcision - Does the Quran Approve it? - Genital Mutilation &amp;#124; ختان &amp;#124; Khitan &amp;#124; Islam &amp;#124; Sunnah &amp;#124; Hadith &amp;#124; Khatna &amp;#124; Musolmani &amp;#124; Sunat &amp;#124; Sirkumsisi &amp;#124; Khatan &amp;#124; Tuli &amp;#124; Tule &amp;#124; Pagtutuli &amp;#124; Sunatan &amp;#124; Sünnet &amp;#124; Urkwtha &amp;#124; Tahara &amp;#124; Touhur &amp;#124; طهارة &amp;#124; طهور |publisher=QuranicPath |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmonotheists.com/tag/revisionist-muslim/ |title=Revisionist Muslim « For All Monotheists |publisher=Allmonotheists.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ljZZ9ZvD_kQC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=circumcision+islam+alter+perfect&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GyWEmzPIGi&amp;sig=6eNHUNrQsiDL0LM3_uECSIGNuFI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nrIeTpKLHIaHhQe5_OysAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Male and female circumcision, medical, legal, and ethical considerations] George C.

==Time for circumcision==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Java optocht bij een besnijdenisfeest links vooraan stokpaarden TMnr 60002834.jpg|thumb|Traditional procession after circumcision of a child in [[Dutch East Indies]], 1915–1918.]]
Islamic sources do not fix a particular time for circumcision. It depends on family, region and country. A majority of Ulema however take the view that parents should get their child circumcised before the age of ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicvoice.com/may.2000/dialogue.htm |title=Circumcision |publisher=Islamicvoice.com |date=2000-03-28 |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preferred age is usually seven although some Muslims are circumcised as early as on the seventh day after birth and as late as at the commencement of [[puberty]].&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

==Procedure==
Whereas Jewish circumcision is closely bound by ritual timing and tradition, in Islam there is no fixed age for circumcision. The age when boys get circumcised, and the procedures used, tend to change across cultures, families, and time. In some Muslim-majority countries, circumcision is performed on Muslim boys after they have learned to recite the whole Qur'an from start to finish.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; In [[Malaysia]] and other regions, the boy usually undergoes the operation between the ages of ten and twelve, and is thus a [[Rite of passage|puberty rite]], serving to introduce him into the new status of an adult.&lt;ref name="circlist1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circlist.com/rites/moslem.html |title=Traditional Muslim Male Circumcision&amp;mdash;Performed by Arabs, Turkish, Malaysian and Others of This Faith |accessdate=2008-07-29 |work= |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure is sometimes semi-public, accompanied with music, special foods, and much festivity.&lt;ref name="circlist" /&gt;

There is no equivalent of a Jewish [[mohel]] in Islam. Circumcisions are usually carried out in a clinic or hospital. The circumciser is not required to be a Muslim.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; The position of the scar is usually neither fully "low" nor fully "high", and the skin left is rather loose. However, due to a relatively secular approach to circumcision in the Muslim world, the "styles" of the Islamic circumcision vary on every individual, and change in the light of new medical knowledge.&lt;ref name="circlist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circlist.com/styles/page3.html |title=Style choices in relation to Religious Beliefs |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515075416/http://www.circlist.com/styles/page3.html |archivedate=2014-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier, instead of being carried out in hospitals, they would be carried out in local clinics and terraces. The circumciser would generally scream "dekh kabootar", translating into "look at the pigeons" in Urdu, to distract the patient and then circumcise the individual.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Celebrations==
In Indonesia, after a child is circumcised, there is a feast called [[Perayaan Sunatan]], but some ulemas in Indonesia say this is [[bid‘ah]] whereas most of them say it is not. In Turkey also widely celebrated and called "Sunnet Toreni" "Sunnet mevludu".

==Female genital mutilation==
''[[Khafḍ]]'', or ''k̲h̲ifāḍ'', refers to [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM).&lt;ref name="khitān" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aldeeb Abu-Sahlieh, Sami A., To Mutilate in the Name of Jehova or Allah, Legitimization of Male and Female Circumcision, Middle East Research Associates, Paper No. 21, 1994; see page 6-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paulyonline.brill.nl/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/khafd-SIM_4132 K̲h̲afḍ], Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. Brill Online, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; FGM is sometimes  referred to as ''khitan''.{{efn|Asmani and Abdi ([[USAID]], 2008): "Proponents of FGM/C have translated the Arabic word ''khitaan'', which appears in several religious texts, to refer to both male circumcision and FGM/C. In reality, however, the word only describes male circumcision; FGM/C is actually called ''khifaadh''. However, whenever ''khitaan'' appears in a religious text it is used by the proponents to justify an Islamic basis for FGM/C."&lt;ref name=Asmani2008pp3–5&gt;Ibrahim Lethome Asmani, Maryam Sheikh Abdi, [http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/De-linking%20FGM%20from%20Islam%20final%20report.pdf ''De-linking Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting from Islam''], Washington: Frontiers in Reproductive Health, USAID, 2008, 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;E.

Hawting (2006), The Development of Islamic Ritual, {{ISBN|978-0860787129}}, page 358-361&lt;/ref&gt; Over 200 million women in Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia are thought to be living with FGM.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2016&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGMC_2016_brochure_final_UNICEF_SPREAD.pdf "Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: A Global Concern"], New York: United Nations Children's Fund, February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is a common belief that FGM is a requirement in Islam, the Quran makes no mention of it and the practice is largely condemned by the majority of Muslims. In Africa, FGM is also practiced not just by Muslims from certain cultures but by Christians and animists alike.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46776">The survival of some [[microorganisms]] exposed to [[outer space]] has been studied using both simulated facilities and [[low Earth orbit]] exposures. Bacteria were some of the first organisms investigated, when in 1960 a Russian satellite carried ''Escherichia coli'', ''Staphylococcus'', and ''Enterobacter aerogenes'' into orbit.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.indy100.com/article/bacteria-get-dangerously-weird-in-space-7380481| title=Bacteria get dangerously weird in space| last=Love| first=Shayla|date=2016-10-26| newspaper=The Independent| access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of microorganisms have been selected for exposure experiments since, as listed in the table below.

Experiments of the adaption of microbes in space have yielded unpredictable results. While sometimes the microorganism may weaken, they can also increase in their disease-causing potency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is possible to classify these microorganisms into two groups, the [[Medical microbiology|human-borne]], and the [[extremophiles]]. Studying the human-borne microorganisms is significant for human welfare and future [[Human spaceflight|crewed missions in space]], whilst the extremophiles are vital for studying the physiological requirements of survival in space.&lt;ref name='Experimental methods'&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of extremophiles has led to the speculation that microorganisms could survive the harsh conditions of extraterrestrial environments and be used as model organisms to understand the fate of biological systems in these environments. The focus of many of the experiments has been to investigate the possible survival of organisms inside rocks ([[lithopanspermia]]),&lt;ref name='Experimental methods'/&gt; or their survival on [[Mars]] for understanding the likelihood of past or present life on that planet.&lt;ref name='Experimental methods'/&gt;  Because of their ubiquity and resistance to spacecraft decontamination, bacterial [[spore]]s are considered likely potential [[Planetary protection|forward contaminants]] on robotic missions to [[Mars]].  Measuring the resistance of such organisms to space conditions can be applied to develop adequate decontamination procedures.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=February 2008}}
This '''list of monochrome and RGB palettes''' includes generic repertoires of colors ([[palette (computing)|color palette]]s) to produce [[black-and-white]] and [[RGB]] color pictures by a computer's display [[Computer hardware|hardware]], not necessarily the total number of such colors that can be simultaneously displayed in a given text or graphic mode of any machine. RGB is the most common method to produce colors for displays; so these complete RGB color repertoires have every possible combination of R-G-B triplets within any given maximum number of levels per component.

For specific hardware and different methods to produce colors other than RGB, see the [[List of 8-bit computer hardware palettes]], the [[List of 16-bit computer hardware palettes]] and the [[List of videogame consoles palettes]].  For various software arrangements and sorts of colors, including other possible full RGB arrangements within 8-bit [[color depth]] displays, see the [[List of software palettes]].

Each palette is represented by a series of color patches. When the number of colors is low, a 1-pixel-size version of the palette appears below it, for easily comparing relative palette sizes. Huge palettes are given directly in one-color-per-pixel color patches.

For each unique palette, an image color test chart and sample image ([[True Color|truecolor]] original follows) rendered with that palette (without [[Floyd–Steinberg dithering|dithering]]) are given. The test chart shows the full 256 levels of the red, green, and blue (RGB) primary colors and cyan, magenta, and yellow complementary colors, along with a full 256-level grayscale. Gradients of RGB intermediate colors (orange, lime green, sea green, sky blue, violet, and fuchsia), and a full [[hue]] spectrum are also present. Color charts are not [[Gamma correction|gamma]] corrected.

|}

These elements illustrate the color depth and distribution of the colors of any given palette, and the sample image indicates how the color selection of such palettes could represent real-life images. These images are not necessarily representative of how the image would be displayed on the original graphics hardware, as the hardware may have additional limitations regarding the maximum display [[Display resolution|resolution]], [[pixel aspect ratio]] and color placement. For simulated sample images for notable computers, see the [[List of 8-bit computer hardware palettes]] and [[List of 16-bit computer hardware palettes]] articles.
&lt;!--'''Note: please do not change the compression scheme of every image by a lossy compression scheme (i.e. [[JPEG]]) in order to improve their file size, nor change the thumbnail size of the images, nor gamma-correct them. They are didactical material AS IS, and they have been already optimized for this purpose.'''--&gt;

==Monochrome palettes==

These palettes only have some shades of gray, from black to white, both considered the most possible darker and lighter "grays", respectively. The general rule is that those palettes have 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; different shades of gray, where ''n'' is the number of bits needed to represent a single [[pixel]].

===Monochrome (1-bit)===
[[Monochrome]] graphics displays typically have a black background with a white or light gray image, though green and amber [[monochrome monitor]]s were also common. Such a palette requires only one bit per pixel.

:{|

| [[Image:Bilevel 1bit palette color test chart.png]]
| [[File:1-bit grayscale.gif|200px]]
|}

Where photo-realism was desired, these early computer systems had a heavy reliance on [[dithering]] to make up for the limits of the technology.

|}

:[[Image:Bilevel 1bit palette.png]]

In some systems, as [[Hercules Graphics Card|Hercules]] and [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] graphic cards for the [[IBM PC]], a bit value of 1 represents white pixels (light on) and a value of 0 the black ones (light off); others, like the [[Atari ST]] and [[Apple Macintosh]] with monochrome monitors, a bit value of 0 means a white pixel (no ink) and a value of 1 means a black pixel (dot of ink), which it approximates to the printing logic.

===2-bit Grayscale===

In a 2-bit color palette each pixel's value is represented by 2 bits resulting in a 4-value palette (2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4).

It has black, white and two intermediate levels of gray as follows:

A monochrome 2-bit palette is used on:

*The [[IBM Monochrome Display Adapter|Monochrome Display Adapter]] for the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]]
*[[NeXT Computer]], [[NeXTcube]] and [[NeXTstation]] monochrome graphic displays.
*Original [[Game Boy]] system portable [[videogame console]].
*[[PowerBook 150|Macintosh PowerBook 150]] monochrome LC displays.
*[[Commodore Amiga]] with A2024 monochrome monitor in high-resolution mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amiga-hardware.com/showhardware.cgi?HARDID=863 |title=Commodore: A2024 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302193812/https://www.amiga-hardware.com/showhardware.cgi?HARDID=863 |archivedate=2012-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===4-bit Grayscale===

In a 4-bit color palette each pixel's value is represented by 4 bits resulting in a 16-value palette (2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 16):

:{|
| [[Image:Grayscale 4bit palette sample image.png]]
| [[Image:Grayscale 4bit palette color test chart.png]]
| [[File:4-bit grayscale.gif|200px]]
|}

4-bit grayscale dithering does a fairly good job of reducing visible banding of the level changes:

| [[File:RGB 24bits palette color test chart - 4-bit gray dithered.png]]
|}

:[[Image:Grayscale 4bit palette.png]]

A monochrome 4-bit palette is used on:

* [[MOS Technology VDC]] (on the [[Commodore 128]] with monochrome monitor)
* [[Amstrad CPC]] series with a GT64/GT65 Green Monitor (16 unique green shades)
* [[Amstrad CPC]] Plus series with the MM12 Monochrome monitor (16 shades of grey)
* Some Apple [[PowerBook]]s equipped with monochrome displays like the [[PowerBook 5300]]

===8-bit Grayscale===

:{|
| [[Image:Grayscale 8bits palette sample image.png]]
| [[Image:Grayscale 8bits palette color test chart.png]]
| [[File:8-bit grayscale.gif|200px]]
|}

In an 8-bit color palette each pixel's value is represented by 8 bits resulting in a 256-value palette (2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; = 256). This is usually the maximum number of grays in ordinary monochrome systems; each image pixel occupies a single memory [[byte]].

:[[Image:Grayscale 8bits palette.png]]

Most [[Image scanner|scanner]]s can capture images in 8-bit grayscale, and [[image file format]]s like [[TIFF]] and [[JPEG]] natively support this monochrome palette size.

[[Alpha channel]]s employed for [[video overlay]] also use (conceptually) this palette. The gray level indicates the opacity of the blended image pixel over the background image pixel.

==Regular RGB palettes==

Here are grouped those full RGB hardware palettes that have the same number of binary levels (i.e., the same number of [[bit]]s) for every red, green and blue components using the full [[RGB]] color model. Thus, the total number of colors are always the number of possible levels by component, ''n'', raised to a power of 3: ''n''×''n''×''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

===3-bit RGB===

| [[File:RGB 24bits palette sample image - 3-bit RGB.png]]
| [[File:RGB 24bits palette color test chart - 3-bit RGB dithered.png]]
|}

Systems with a 3-bit RGB palette use 1 bit for each of the red, green and blue color components. That is, each component is either "on" or "off" with no intermediate states. This results in an 8-color palette ((2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 8) that have black, white, the three RGB primary colors red, blue and green and their correspondent complementary colors cyan, magenta and yellow as follows:

:[[Image:RGB 3bits palette.png]]

The color indices vary between implementations; therefore, index numbers are not given.

The 3-bit RGB palette is used by:

*The ECMA-48 standard for [[text terminal]]s (sometimes known as the "ANSI standard", although [[ANSI X3.64]] does not define colors)
*[[Teletext]] Level 1/1.5 Teletext.
*[[Videotex]]

The [[Allegro_(software)|Allegro library]] supported in the (legacy) version 4, an emulated 12-bit color mode example code ("ex12bit.c"), using 8-bit indexed color in VGA/SVGA. It used two pixels for each emulated pixel, paired horizontally, and a specifically adapted 256-color palette. One range of the palette was many brightnesses of one primary color (say green), and another range of the other two primaries mixed together at different amounts and brightnesses (red and blue). It effectively reduced the horizontal resolution by half, but allowed a 12-bit "true color" in DOS and other 8-bit VGA/SVGA modes. The effect also somewhat reduced the total brightness of the screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/3-ex12bit/|title=ex12bit - How to fake a 12-bit truecolor mode on an 8-bit card.

===24-bit RGB===

:{|

| [[Image:RGB 24bits palette color test chart.png]]
|}

Often known as [[True Color|truecolor]] and '''millions of colors''', 24-bit color is the highest color depth normally used, and is available on most modern display systems and software. Its color palette contains (2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 256&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 16,777,216 colors. 24-bit color can be represented with six hexadecimal digits. This is approximately the number of individual colors the human eye can distinguish within the limited gamut of a typical display{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}.

[[File:16777216colors.png|thumb|left|200px|All 16,777,216 colors (downscaled, click image for full resolution).]]
{{clear}}

The complete palette (shown above) needs a squared image of 4,096 pixels wide (50.33 MB uncompressed), and there is not enough room in this page to show it at full.

This can be imagined as 256 stacked squares like the following, every one of them having the same given value for the red component, from 0 to 255.

The color transitions in these patches must be seen as continuous. If you see ''color stepping'' ([[Colour banding|banding]]) inside, then probably your display is using a [[Highcolor]] (15- or 16- bits RGB, 32,768 or 65,536 colors) mode or lesser.

This is also the number of colors used in true color image files, like [[Truevision TGA]], [[TIFF]], [[JPEG]] (the last internally encoded as [[YCbCr]]) and [[Windows Bitmap]], captured with [[Image scanner|scanner]]s and [[digital camera]]s, as well as those created with [[3D computer graphic]]s software.

24-bit RGB systems include:

=== 30-bit RGB ===

{|
| style="color: black; background-color: #C0C0C0" | (No simulation available)
|}

Some newer graphics cards support [[Color depth#Beyond truecolor|30-bit RGB and higher]]. Its color palette contains (2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1024&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1,073,741,824 colors. However, there are few operating systems or applications that support this mode yet. For some people, it may be hard to distinguish between higher color palettes than 24-bit color offers. However, the range of [[luminance]], or gray scale, offered in a 30-bit color system would have 1,024 levels of luminance rather than the 256 of the common standard 24-bit, to which the human eye is more sensitive than to hue. This reduces the [[Colour_banding|banding effect]] for gradients across large areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rtings.com/tv/tests/picture-quality/gradient|title=Gradients on TVs: Color bit depth|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-regular RGB palettes==

These also are full RGB palette repertories, but either they do not have the same number of levels for every red, green and blue components, or they are bit levels based. Nevertheless, all of them are used in very popular [[personal computer]]s.

For further details on color palettes for these systems, see the article [[List of 8-bit computer hardware palettes]].

===4-bit RGBI===

:{| style="border-style: none" border="0" cellpadding="0"
|-
|| [[Image:RGBI 4bits palette sample image.png]]
|| [[Image:RGBI 4bits palette color test chart.png]]
|}

The 4-bit RGBI palette is similar to the 3-bit RGB palette but adds one bit for ''intensity''. This results in each of the colors of the 3-bit palette to have a ''dark'' and ''bright'' variant giving a total of 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;×2 = 16 colors.

This 4-bits RGBI schema is used in several platforms with variations, so the table given below is a simple reference for the palette richness, and not an actual implemented palette. For this reason, no numbers are assigned to each color, and color order is arbitrary.

:[[Image:RGBI 4bits palette.png]]

Note that "dark white" is a lighter gray than "bright black".

The 4-bits RGBI palettes are used by:

*[[Color Graphics Adapter]], with brown instead of dark yellow). On CGA, setting a color "bright" added ⅓ of the maximum to ''all three'' channels' brightness, so the "bright" colors were whiter shades of their 3-bit counterparts. Each of the other bits increased a channel by ⅔, except that dark yellow had only ⅓ green and was therefore brown instead of ochre.
** The CGA palette was the default for [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]], [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] 3.x (on the [[IBM PC]] and compatibles), although other palettes were available.
*[[MOS Technology VDC]] (on the [[Commodore 128]])
*[[ZX Spectrum]] (with two black, black with bright is the same as black without bright)
*[[Sharp MZ]] 800

===3-level RGB ===

:{| style="border-style: none" border="0" cellpadding="0"
|-
|| [[Image:AmstradCPC palette sample image.png]]
|| [[Image:AmstradCPC palette color test chart.png]]
|}

The 3-level (''''not'''' '''bits''') RGB uses three level for every red, green and blue color components, resulting in a 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 27 colors palette as follows:

:[[Image:AmstradCPC palette.png]]

This palette is used by:

* The [[Amstrad CPC 464]] series of personal computers excluding the Plus models (up to 16 colors simultaneously)
* The [[Toshiba Pasopia 7]]

{{clear}}

===3-3-2 bit RGB===

:{| style="border-style: none" border="0" cellpadding="0"
|-
|| [[Image:MSX2 Screen8 palette sample image.png]]
|| [[Image:MSX2 Screen8 palette color test chart.png]]
|}

The 3-3-2 bit RGB use 3 bits for each of the red and green color components, and 2 bits for the blue component, due to the lesser sensitivity of the common human eye to this primary color. This results in an 8×8×4 = 256-color palette as follows:

:[[Image:MSX2 Screen8 palette.png]]

This palette is used by
*The [[MSX#MSX2|MSX2]] series of personal computers.
*Palette 4 of the [[Professional Graphics Controller|IBM PGC]] (palette 2 gives 2-3-3 bit RGB and palette 3 gives 3-2-3 bit RGB).
*VGA built-in output of the [[Digilent Inc.]] NEXYS 2, NEXYS 3 and BASYS2 FPGA boards.
*The [[Uzebox]] gaming console
* [[SGI Indy]] 8-bit XL graphics
*The [[Tiki 100]] personal computer (only 16 colors can be displayed simultaneously)

{{clear}}

===16-bit RGB===

:{| style="border-style: none" border="0" cellpadding="0"
|-
|| [[Image:RGB 16bits palette sample image.png]]
|| [[Image:RGB 16bits palette color test chart.png]]
|}

Most modern systems support 16-bit color. It is sometimes referred to as  [[Highcolor]] (along with the 15-bit RGB), '''medium color''' or '''thousands of colors'''. It utilizes a color palette of 32×64×32 = 65,536 colors. Usually, there are 5 bits allocated for the red and blue color components (32 levels each) and 6 bits for the green component (64 levels), due to the greater sensitivity of the common human eye to this color. This doubles the 15-bit RGB palette.

The 16-bit RGB palette using 6 bits for the green component:

:[[Image:RGB 16bits palette.png]]

The [[Atari Falcon]] and the [[XGA|Extended Graphics Array]] (XGA) for [[IBM Personal System/2|IBM PS/2]] use the 16-bit RGB palette.

It must be noticed that not all systems using 16-bit color depth employ the 16-bit, 32-64-32 level RGB palette. Platforms like the Sharp [[X68000]] home computer or the [[Neo Geo (system)|Neo Geo]] video game console employs the 15-bit RGB palette (5 bits are used for red, green, and blue), but the last bit specifies a less significant intensity or luminance. The 16-bit mode of the [[Truevision]] [[Truevision TGA|TARGA]]/[[AT-Vista]]/[[NU-Vista]] graphic cards and its associated TGA file format also uses 15-bit RGB, but it devotes its remaining bit as a simple [[alpha channel]] for [[video overlay]]. The [[Atari Falcon]] can also be switched into a matching mode by setting of an "overlay" bit in the graphics processor mode register when in 16-bit mode, meaning it can actually display in ''either'' 15- or 16-bit color depth depending on application.

==Jōmon period==

Magatama first appeared in Japan in the [[Jōmon period|Final Jōmon period]], c. 1000 to 300 BCE, and in this period magatama were made from relatively simple, naturally occurring materials, including [[clay]], [[talc]], [[slate]], [[quartz]], [[gneiss]], [[jadeite]], [[nephrite]], and [[serpentinite]].&lt;ref name="nipponika"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Nihon Daihyakka Zensho (Nipponika) (日本大百科全書 (ニッポニカ)) | title = Magatama | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/| accessdate = 2012-03-26 | year = 2012 | publisher = Shogakukan | location = Tokyo|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; They lack the uniformity of design found in magatama produced in later periods.&lt;ref name="kawade"/&gt; Magatama from the Jōmon period were irregularly shaped, lacked continuity in form from region to region, and have been called "[[Stone Age]] magatama" for this reason.&lt;ref name="kokushi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nipponika"/&gt; Magatama are thought to be an imitation of the teeth of large animals, pierced with a hole, which are found in earlier Jōmon remains.&lt;ref name="dijitaru-magatama"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Dijitaru daijisen| title = Magatama | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/| accessdate = 2012-04-01 | year = 2012 | publisher = Shogakukan | location = Tokyo|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; These resemble magatama, but more recent scholarship indicates that these early Jōmon may have simply had a decorative function, and have no relationship to magatama.&lt;ref name="nipponika"/&gt;  Magatama in the Jōmon period appear to have moved from the purely decorative to having a status and ceremonial function by the end of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Naumann | first = Nelly |authorlink=Nelly Naumann | year = 2000 | title = Japanese prehistory : the material and spiritual culture of the Jōmon period | chapter = From early to middle Jōmon | series = Asien- und Afrika-Studien der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin | volume = 6 | publisher = Harrassowitz | place = Wiesbaden | page = 18 | isbn = 9783447043298 | oclc = 45797690}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "middle Jōmon exchange network" may have existed, whereby magatama were produced in regions where materials for their manufacture were readily plentiful. Jade and talc examples produced in bead-making villages located in present-day [[Itoigawa, Niigata]] have been found at a large number of sites in along the northern coast, central mountains, and [[Kantō region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Barnes | first = Gina Lee | year = 1999 | title = The rise of civilization in East Asia: the archaeology of China, Korea and Japan | edition = 1st paperback | publisher = Thames and Hudson | place = New York, N.Y. | page = 30 | isbn = 9780500279748 | oclc = 43664418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeological sites (Jōmon)===

*Examples of magatama from the Jōmon period have been discovered in large numbers at the Kamegaoka site in [[Tsugaru, Aomori|Tsugaru]], [[Aomori Prefecture]].

==Yayoi period==
[[File:Magatama40.JPG|left|thumb|Agate magatama, {{Nihongo|[[Kobe Archaeology Center]]|神戸市埋蔵文化財センター|Kōbeshi Maizō Bunkazai Sentā}}]]

Magatama in the [[Yayoi period]], c.  300 BCE to 300 CE, are notably different from Jōmon-period magatama. The jewels moved from a primitive, non-standard form towards more polished and uniform form in this period.&lt;ref name="kawade"/&gt; The technology to cut large gemstones and polish jewels notably advanced in the Yayoi period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Saitō | first = Tadashi | year = 1958 | title = Genshi (原始) | chapter = Seikatsu yōshiki no hatten (生活様式の発展) | series = Nihon zenshi (日本全史) | volume = 1 | publisher = Tōkyō Daigaku Shuppankai | place = Tōkyō | language = Japanese | page = 82 | oclc = 35922174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refined materials such as jadeite, serpentinite, and [[glass]] replaced the less sophisticated materials of the Jōmon period.&lt;ref name="nipponika"/&gt; Yayoi period magatama are noted for their reverse C-shaped form, which by the end of the period became an almost squared shape.&lt;ref name="nipponika"/&gt; From the Yayoi period on magatama uniformly feature a bored hole that allowed the jewels to be held on a string.

The Yayoi period is marked by specific centers specializing in magatama and the widespread trade of magatama. The period is marked by the formation of power centers that came to be individual states. The development of weapons increased in this period to protect increasingly developed rice fields and fishing rights. Trade greatly increased in this period, as did the specialization of production of certain items, including magatama. Magatama producing areas exchanged their product with other products, specifically [[rice]], leading to the widespread distribution of magatama across Japan.&lt;ref name="yomiuri-kuni"&gt;{{Citation | editor = Okada, Akio| year = 1959 | title = Nihon no hajimari (日本のはじまり) | chapter = Kuniguni no matomari (国々のまとまり) | series = Nihon no rekishi (日本の歴史) | volume = 1 | publisher = Yomiuri Shinbunsha | place = Tōkyō | language = Japanese | page = 110 | oclc = 33688869|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magatama were commonly used to create necklaces and bracelets worn on the wrists or ankles. The necklace was typically constructed of jadeite magatama separated by cylindrical bored-holed pieces of jasper. Small beads of dark-blue glass are also not uncommon on the necklace. The bracelet was typically also used shells from the coastal areas of Shikoku and the Inland Sea, wood, and bronze.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor = Okada, Akio| year = 1959 | title = Nihon no hajimari (日本のはじまり) | chapter = Kawatte kita shakai seikatsu (変わってきた社会生活) | series = Nihon no rekishi (日本の歴史) | volume = 1 | publisher = Yomiuri Shinbunsha | place = Tōkyō | language = Japanese | page = 99 | oclc = 33688869|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this period the use of the [[mirror]], [[sword]], and jewels as status symbols for village, and later regional leaders of all kinds, emerged in the Yayoi period, and point to the origin of the mirror, sword, and magatama as the [[Imperial Regalia of Japan]].&lt;ref name="yomiuri-1"&gt;{{Citation | editor = Okada, Akio| year = 1959 | title = Nihon no hajimari (日本のはじまり) | series = Nihon no rekishi (日本の歴史) | volume = 1 | publisher = Yomiuri Shinbunsha | place = Tōkyō | language = Japanese | page = 122 | oclc = 33688869|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'', the earliest historical document with a reference to Japan, describes the [[Wa (Japan)|Wa people]], an ancient country of [[Yamatai]], and its queen, [[Himiko]]. The ''Record'' indicates that when Himiko died her relative Iyo, a girl of thirteen, was made queen and sent a delegation of twenty officials under Yazuku, an imperial general, to offer tribute to the [[Northern Wei]] court. "The delegation visited the capital and [] offered to the court five thousand white gems and two pieces of carved jade, as well as twenty pieces of brocade with variegated designs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tsunoda | first = Ryunosuke| title = Sources of Japanese tradition | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York  | series = Records and civilization, sources and studies | chapter = The earliest records of Japan | pages = 8–16 | year = 1958 | isbn = 0231022549|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carved jade in the ''Record'' likely describes a tribute of two jade magatama.

*The large-scale Yayoi period remains at the [[Yoshinogari site]], [[Yoshinogari, Saga|Yoshinogari]] and [[Kanzaki, Saga|Kanzaki]] in [[Saga Prefecture]] revealed examples of [[lead glass]] magatama typical of the Yayoi period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kidder | first = J.

*One known center of Yayoi magatama production was in the area of the [[Tamatsukuri Inari Shrine]] in [[Osaka]]. Tamatsukuri literally means "jewel making" and a [[guild]], the Tamatsukuri-be, was active from the Yayoi period. An existing jewel at the shrine is said to have great spiritual power. Magatama appear on all sorts of implements of the present-day temple, including [[amulet]]s, roof [[tile]]s, and lanterns. The [[Inari Ōkami|inari]] female [[fox]] at the gate of a subshrine of Tamatsukuri Inari Shrine wears a necklace of magatama.

==Kofun period==
[[Image:Magatamarm.jpg|thumb|Necklace of jade magatama from a Japanese burial]]
[[Image:Magatamas.JPG|thumb|Magatamas in Kofun period]]

Magatama became very common in the [[Kofun period]], c. CE 250 to CE 538, and by the end of the period almost all [[kofun]] [[tumulus|tumuli]] contained magatama.&lt;ref name="kawade"/&gt; In the early Kofun period magatama were made from jadeite as in earlier periods, but by the middle of the period were made from [[jasper]], and by the end of the period, almost exclusively of [[agate]] and [[jade]].&lt;ref name="nipponika"/&gt; Magatama capped by silver or gold also appear towards the end of the period. Large magatama made of [[talc]], imitations of smaller ones made of more precious materials, were used as [[grave goods]].&lt;ref name="nipponika"/&gt; Magatama are found in [[kofun]] tumuli across Japan from the period. Their use went from merely decorative to sacred and ceremonial grave goods.&lt;ref name="nipponika"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yomiuri"&gt;{{Citation | editor = Okada, Akio| year = 1959 | title = Nihon no hajimari (日本のはじまり) | series = Nihon no rekishi (日本の歴史) | volume = 1 | publisher = Yomiuri Shinbunsha | place = Tōkyō | language = Japanese | page = 29 | oclc = 33688869|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Nihongo|Chōjigashira magatama|丁字頭勾玉}} are magatama with inscriptions that look like flowers of the [[clove]] tree and have a hole suitable to attach to a string.&lt;ref name="kawade"/&gt; These first appear in the Kofun period.&lt;ref name="kokushi"/&gt; In the Kofun period magatama appear on necklaces, with several magatama set between bored [[cylinder]]s.

===Archaeological sites (Kofun)===

Examples of stone magatama from the Kofun period are especially numerous.

*An excavation of the Kamegaoka Kofun, [[Kishiwada, Osaka]], revealed a local who had been buried with a jade, jasper, and alabaster magatama necklace, as well as magatama placed near the feet.

== Origin of magatama forms ==

Archaeologists and historians are unable yet to explain what the origins of magatama forms are, or whether these forms can be traced back to one convergent source. However, these alternative explanations have been provided:&lt;ref&gt;Nishimura, Y. (2018). The Evolution of Curved Beads (Magatama 勾玉/曲玉) in Jōmon Period Japan and the Development of Individual Ownership. Asian Perspectives 57(1), 105-158. University of Hawai'i Press. Retrieved October 18, 2018, from Project MUSE database.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Magatama may be fashioned after animal fangs/teeth
* Magatama may be modeled after the shape of fetuses
* Magatama could symbolize the shape of the soul
* Magatama may be modeled after the shape of the moon
* That there is meaning and connotation attached to the shape of the magatama itself (i.e. meaning comes from the form itself, and not that magatama has been patterned after anything else)

==In Japanese mythology==
[[File:Amaterasu.png|right|thumb|Artist's rendition of Amaterasu emerging from the cave; Amaterasu holds a magatama necklace in her left hand with a sword]]

The [[Kojiki]] and [[Nihon Shoki]], completed in the 8th century, have numerous references to magatama.&lt;ref name="nipponika"/&gt; They appear in the first chapter of the Nihon Shoki, which largely describes the mythology of Japan. [[Susanoo]], god of the sea and storms, received five hundred magatama from [[Tamanoya no mikoto]], or Ame-no-Futodama-no-mikoto, the jewel-making deity.&lt;ref name="gods"&gt;{{Citation | last = Czaja | first = Michael | year = 1974 | title = Gods of myth and stone: phallicism in Japanese folk religion | chapter = The celestial matsuri | edition = 1st | publisher = Weatherhill | place = New York | page = 228 | isbn = 9780834800953 | oclc = 1085538}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susanoo went to heaven and presented them to his sister, the sun goddess [[Amaterasu]], who bit off successive parts of the magatama, and blew them away to create other deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Aston | editor-first = W.

In the legend Amaterasu later shuts herself in a cave. [[Ama-no-Koyane-no-mikoto]] hung magatama, among other objects, on a five hundred-branch [[sakaki]] tree, to successfully lure Amaterasu from the cave.&lt;ref name="gods"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Aston | editor-first = W.

Tuttle Co. | place = Rutland, Vt. | page = 40 | isbn = 9780804809849 | oclc = 354027}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 58, in the reign of the [[Emperor Suinin]], the Nihon shoki records that a dog kills and disembowels a ''mujina'', a type of [[badger]], and a magatama was discovered in its stomach. This magatama was presented to Suinin, who enshrined it at Isonokami Shrine, where it is said to presently reside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Aston | editor-first = W.

Chūai made an inspection trip to the Tsukushi, or [[Kyūshū]], and was presented with an enormous sakaki tree hung with magatama as well as other sacred objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Aston | editor-first = W.

===Yasakani no Magatama===

A noted magatama is the {{Nihongo|Yasakani no Magatama|八尺瓊勾玉|extra=also {{lang|ja|八尺瓊曲玉}} and {{lang|ja|八坂瓊曲玉}}}}, one of the three [[Imperial Regalia of Japan]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia-regalia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Japan | title = Imperial regalia | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ | accessdate = 2012-04-01 | year = 2012 | publisher = Shogakukan | location = Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swords, mirrors, and jewels were common objects of status for regional rulers in Japan as early as the Yayoi period,&lt;ref name="yomiuri-1"/&gt; and were further widespread in the Kofun period, as shown by their ubiquitous presence in kofun tumuli.&lt;ref name="yomiuri"/&gt; The Yasakani no Magatama is stored at the {{Nihongo|Kashiko-dokoro|賢所|}}, the central shrine of the [[Three Palace Sanctuaries]] at the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace]], and is used in the [[Enthronement of the Japanese Emperor|enthronement ceremony of the Emperor of Japan]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia-regalia"/&gt;

[[D. C. Holtom|Daniel Clarence Holtom]] stated in 1928 in ''Japanese enthronement ceremonies; with an account of the imperial regalia'' that the Yasakani no Magatama is the only one of the three regalia that exists in its original form;&lt;ref name="holtom-1928"&gt;{{Citation | last = Holtom | first = Daniel Clarence | year = 1928 | title = The Japanese enthronement ceremonies; with an account of the imperial regalia | chapter = The jewels | publisher = Kyo Bun Kwan | publication-place = Tokyo | page = 55 | oclc = 1983823}}&lt;/ref&gt; post-[[World War II]] scholarship supports the claim. Replicas of the sword and mirror were made as early as the 9th century, and the originals were entrusted to other shrines.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia-imp"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Japan | title = Kurayoshi Plain | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ | accessdate = 2012-04-12 | year = 2012 | publisher = Shogakukan | location = Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in Ryūkyūan religion==

[[D. C.

[[File:Egerton Drive - geograph.org.uk - 781883.jpg|thumb|right|A medium-density development, in the United Kingdom. Typical features are the apartments in a multi-storey (but not high-rise) building.]]

''' Medium-density housing''' is residential developments that are at higher [[Urban density|densities]] than standard low-density, (or 'broadhectare') suburban subdivisions, but not so high that they might be regarded as [[high density housing]]. In Australia the density of standard suburban residential areas has traditionally been between 8-15 dwellings per [[hectare]]. Medium density housing can range from about 25 to 80 dwellings per hectare, though most commonly the density is between 30 and 40 dwellings/hectare. Such developments may consist of [[Single-family detached home|detached]], [[Semi-detached|semi-attached]] and attached (or [[Multi-family residential|multi-unit]]) housing.

== History ==
Many traditional types of housing developed prior to car-based cities were at comparable densities, such as the [[Terraced house|terraced]] (row) or [[Courtyard house|courtyard housing]] found in many parts of the world. The inner suburbs in many Australian cities and those [[activity centre]]s developed during the late Victorian suburban boom have examples of medium density housing. Since the 1960s, many Australian states have encouraged [[urban consolidation]] policies which have facilitated the construction of medium density housing.

== Issues ==
The design of medium density housing requires careful consideration of [[urban design]] principles. In some cases, urban consolidation policies have allowed indiscriminate demolition of existing low-density housing across established residential suburbs, replacing them with various forms of medium density dwellings. Because of this, many medium density developments have been controversial in the last 20–30 years because of their perceived negative impacts on the [[neighbourhood character]] of established residential areas. Accordingly, there has been an increasing policy emphasis by state and local governments to regulate the design of new medium density developments, such as the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]n government's [[ResCode]], released in 2001, and the metropolitan strategy, [[Melbourne 2030]], which seeks to confine such housing to [[activity centre]]s.

'''Meltwater management''' is a runoff management system designed to deal with runoff caused by the melting of snow in colder climates. They were designed when it became apparent that using the [[Best management practice for water pollution|Best management practice]] (BMP) for rainfall runoff was not working.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stormwater.pca.state.mn.us/index.php/Cold_climate_impact_on_runoff_management|title=Cold climate impact on runoff management - Minnesota Stormwater Manual|website=stormwater.pca.state.mn.us|language=en|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Snow filtration''' is a system to deal with left-over [[snow]] in an [[environmentally friendly]] way. Removing snow from roads is done to ensure [[road safety]]. The conventional method is by removing the snow and emptying it into rivers. However, since salt is used to melt ice on the roads, the salt also enters the rivers with the dumped snow. This increases the salt content of the rivers which can have impacts on aquatic and marine ecosystems. The practice of removing snow from streets and off-loading it into rivers affects the aquatic ecosystems. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindsay|first1=Jay|title=Dump Snow in Rivers, Harbors? There's a Downside.|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/41427190/ns/us_news-environment/t/dump-snow-rivers-harbors-theres-downside/#.WQzRIcm1uRs|website=NBCNews|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
In spring as snow melts, the salt used on roads as a deicer is left behind, which can be environmentally damaging as it creates a [[Tonicity#Hypertonicity|hypertonic]] environment for plants.

The snow [[Surface runoff|runoff]] is collected and brought to a collection center. It is directed through an oil and grit separator which also monitors the consistency of pollutants in the runoff. The oil and grit separator causes [[electrochemical]] and [[biological process|biological]] processes, which bind [[heavy metals]] and [[nutrients]] to the sediment by means of [[redox|
reduction-oxidation]] reactions. At the same time, this reduces the amount of [[chlorine]] present in the runoff. 

The runoff then flows into a [[catch basin]], where plants use the salt [[ions]] (e.g. [[Potassium|K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Phosphorus|P&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Nitrogen|N&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;]]) for their growth.The runoff is further filtered by the plants, leaving only clean water to go back into [[streams]] and [[river]]s.&lt;!-- Plagiarism --&gt;

'''Military science''' is the study of military processes, institutions, and behavior, along with the study of warfare, and the theory and application of organized coercive force.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, 2013. p. 880.&lt;/ref&gt; It is mainly focused on [[Military theory|theory]], method, and practice of producing [[military capability]] in a manner consistent with [[national defense policy]]. Military science serves to identify the [[military strategy|strategic]], [[politics|political]], [[economics|economic]], [[psychology|psychological]], [[sociology|social]], [[military operation|operational]], [[military technology|technological]], and [[military tactics|tactical]] elements necessary to sustain relative advantage of [[armed forces|military force]]; and to increase the likelihood and favorable outcomes of [[victory]] in peace or during a war. Military scientists include theorists, researchers, experimental scientists, applied scientists, designers, engineers, test technicians, and other [[military personnel]].

Military personnel obtain [[weapon]]s, [[Military equipment|equipment]], and [[Military training|training]] to achieve specific [[strategic goal (military)|strategic goal]]s. Military science is also used to establish enemy capability as part of [[technical intelligence]].

In military history, military science had been used during the period of [[Industrial Revolution]] as a general term to refer to all matters of military theory and technology application as a single [[Academia|academic discipline]], including that of the deployment and employment of troops in peacetime or in battle.

In [[military education]], military science is often the name of the [[Academic department|department]] in the [[Higher education|education institution]] that administers [[Officer Candidate School|officer candidate education]]. However, this education usually focuses on the officer leadership training and basic information about employment of military theories, concepts, methods and systems, and [[Officer Candidate|graduates]] are not military scientists on completion of studies, but rather [[Military rank|junior military officers]].

==History==
{{main|Military history}}
[[File:Telephony Class NGM-v31-p357.jpg|thumb|left|CLASS IN TELEPHONY: ENLISTED MEN, U. S. ARMY. The  telephone in modern warfare has robbed battle of much of its picturesqueness, romance, and glamor; as the dashing [[dispatch rider]] on his foam-flecked steed is antiquated. A message sent by telephone annihilates space and time, whereas the dispatch rider would, in most cases, be annihilated by [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]]. Published 1917.]]

Even until the Second World War, military science was written in English starting with capital letters, and was thought of as an academic discipline alongside Physics, Philosophy and the Medical Science. In part this was due to the general mystique that accompanied education in a World where as late as the 1880s 75% of the European population was illiterate.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The ability by the officers to make complex calculations required for the equally complex "evolutions" of the troop movements in linear warfare that increasingly dominated the [[Renaissance]] and later history, and the introduction of the gunpowder weapons into the equation of warfare only added to the veritable arcana of building fortifications as it seemed to the average individual.

Until the early 19th century, one observer, a British veteran of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Major John Mitchell thought that it seemed nothing much had changed from the application of force on a battlefield since the days of the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;p.12, Gat&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that this was primarily so because as [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]] suggested, "unlike in any other science or art, in war the object reacts".&lt;ref&gt;cf p.12, Gat&lt;/ref&gt;

Until this time, and even after the [[Franco-Prussian War]], military science continued to be divided between the formal thinking of officers brought up in the "shadow" of Napoleonic Wars and younger officers like [[Ardant du Picq]] who tended to view fighting performance as rooted in the individual's and [[group psychology]]&lt;ref&gt;p.29, Gat&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested detailed analysis of this. This set in motion the eventual fascination of the military organisations with application of quantitative and qualitative research to their theories of combat; the attempt to translate military thinking as philosophic concepts into concrete methods of combat.

Military implements, the supply of an army, its organization, tactics, and discipline, have constituted the elements of military science in all ages; but improvement in weapons and accoutrements appears to lead and control all the rest.&lt;ref&gt;p.194, Lodge&lt;/ref&gt;

The breakthrough of sorts made by Clausewitz in suggesting eight principles on which such methods can be based, in Europe, for the first time presented an opportunity to largely remove the element of chance and error from command decision making process.&lt;ref&gt;p.12, Dupuy&lt;/ref&gt; At this time emphasis was made on the [[Topography]] (including [[Trigonometry]]), [[Military art (Military science)]],&lt;ref&gt;taught by a Professor of Military Art at the Staff School in France, p.248, Barnard&lt;/ref&gt; [[Military history]], Organisation of the Army in the field, [[Artillery]] and Science of [[Projectile]]s, [[Field fortifications]] and [[Permanent fortifications]], [[Military legislation]], [[Military administration]] and [[wikt:maneuver|Manoeuvres]].&lt;ref&gt;p.248, Barnard&lt;/ref&gt;

The military science on which the model of German combat operations was built for the First World War remained largely unaltered from the Napoleonic model, but took into the consideration the vast improvements in the [[firepower]] and the ability to conduct "great battles of annihilation" through rapid [[concentration of force]], [[strategic mobility]], and the maintenance of the [[strategic offensive]]&lt;ref&gt;p.113, Gat&lt;/ref&gt; better known as the [[Cult of the offensive]]. The key to this, and other modes of thinking about war remained analysis of [[military history]] and attempts to derive tangible lessons that could be replicated again with equal success on another battlefield as a sort of bloody laboratory of military science. Few were bloodier than the fields of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] between 1914 and 1918. Fascinatingly the man who probably understood Clausewitz better than most, [[Ferdinand Foch|Marshal Foch]] would initially participate in events that nearly destroyed the [[French Army]].&lt;ref&gt;p.15, Dupuy&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not however true to say that military theorists and commanders were suffering from some collective case of stupidity; quite the opposite is true. Their analysis of military history convinced them that decisive and aggressive strategic offensive was the only [[Military doctrine|doctrine of victory]], and feared that overemphasis of firepower, and the resultant dependence on [[Trench warfare|entrenchment]] would make this all but impossible, and leading to the battlefield stagnant in advantages of the defensive position, destroying troop [[morale]] and willingness to fight.&lt;ref&gt;p.138, Gat&lt;/ref&gt; Because only the offensive could bring victory, lack of it, and not the firepower, was blamed for the defeat of the [[Imperial Russian Army]] in the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. Foch thought that "In strategy as well as in tactics one attacks".&lt;ref&gt;p.138-139, Gat&lt;/ref&gt;

In many ways military science was born as a result of the experiences of the Great War. "Military implements" had changed armies beyond recognition with [[cavalry]] to virtually disappear in the next 20 years. The "supply of an army" would become a science of [[logistics]] in the wake of massive armies, operations and troops that could fire ammunition faster than it could be produced, for the first time using vehicles that used the [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engine]], a watershed of change.&lt;ref&gt;p.50, Thompson&lt;/ref&gt; Military "organisation" would no longer be that of the linear warfare, but assault teams, and battalions that were becoming multi-skilled with introduction of [[machine gun]] and [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]], and for the first time forcing military commanders to think not only in terms of rank and file, but [[force structure]].

Tactics changed too, with infantry for the first time segregated from the horse-mounted troops, and required to cooperate with [[tank]]s, [[aircraft]] and new [[artillery]] tactics. Perception of [[military discipline]] too had changed. Morale, despite strict disciplinarian attitudes, had cracked in all armies during the war, but best performing troops were found to be those where emphasis on discipline had been replaced with display of personal initiative and group cohesiveness such as that found in the [[Australian Corps]] during the [[Hundred Days Offensive]]. The military sciences' analysis of military history that had failed European commanders was about to give way to a new military science, less conspicuous in appearance, but more aligned to the processes of [[science]] of testing and experimentation, the [[scientific method]], and forever "wed" to the idea of the superiority of technology on the battlefield.

Currently military science still means many things to different organisations. In the United Kingdom and much of the European Union the approach is to relate it closely to the civilian application and understanding. The [[Defence Scientific Advisory Council]] sees this in terms of the fields of science, engineering, technology and analysis (SETA) that includes broad strategic issues, priorities and policies related to developing military capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/WhatWeDo/ScienceandTechnology/DSAC/|title=Defence Scientific Advisory Council - GOV.UK|website=www.mod.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, for example Belgium's [[Royal Military Academy (Belgium)|Royal Military Academy]], military science remains an academic discipline, and is studied alongside Social Sciences, including such subjects as [[Humanitarian law]]. The United States Department of Defense defines military science in terms of specific systems and operational requirements, and include among other areas [[civil defense]] and force structure.

==Employment of military skills==
In the first instance military science is concerned with who will participate in military operations, and what sets of skills and knowledge they will require to do so effectively and somewhat ingeniously.

===Military organization===
{{Main|Military organization}}
Develops optimal methods for the administration and organization of military units, as well as the military as a whole.  In addition, this area studies other associated aspects as mobilization/demobilization, and military government for areas recently conquered (or liberated) from enemy control.

===Force structuring===
Force structuring is the method by which personnel and the weapons and equipment they use are organized and trained for military operations, including combat. Development of force structure in any country is based on strategic, operational, and tactical needs of the [[national defense policy]], the identified threats to the country, and the technological capabilities of the threats and the armed forces.

Force structure development is guided by doctrinal considerations of strategic, operational and tactical deployment and employment of formations and units to territories, areas and zones where they are expected to perform their missions and tasks. Force structuring applies to all [[Armed Services]], but not to their supporting organisations such as those used for defense science research activities.

In the United States force structure is guided by the [[table of organization and equipment]] (TOE or TO&amp;E). The TOE is a document published by the U.S. Department of Defense which prescribes the organization, manning, and equipage of units from divisional size and down, but also including the headquarters of Corps and Armies.

Force structuring also provides information on the mission and capabilities of specific units, as well as the unit's current status in terms of posture and readiness. A general TOE is applicable to a type of unit (for instance, infantry) rather than a specific unit (the 3rd Infantry Division). In this way, all units of the same branch (such as Infantry) follow the same structural guidelines which allows for more efficient financing, training, and employment of like units operationally.

===Military education and training===
{{Main|Military education and training}}
Studies the methodology and practices involved in training soldiers, NCOs (non-commissioned officers, i.e. sergeants and corporals), and officers.  It also extends this to training small and large units, both individually and in concert with one another for both the regular and reserve organizations.  Military training, especially for officers, also concerns itself with general education and political indoctrination of the armed forces.

==Military concepts and methods==
Much of capability development depends on the concepts which guide use of the armed forces and their weapons and equipment, and the methods employed in any given [[theatre of war]] or combat environment.

===Military history===
{{Main|Military history}}
Military activity has been a constant process over thousands of years, and the essential tactics, strategy, and goals of military operations have been unchanging throughout history. As an example, one notable maneuver is the [[double envelopment]], considered to be the consummate military maneuver, first executed by [[Hannibal]] at the [[Battle of Cannae]] in 216 BCE, and later by [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] at the [[Battle of Walaja]] in 633 CE.

Via the study of history, the military seeks to avoid past mistakes, and improve upon its current performance by instilling an ability in commanders to perceive historical parallels during battle, so as to capitalize on the lessons learned. The main areas military history includes are the history of wars, battles, and combats, history of the military art, and history of each specific military service.

:''Main articles: [[Military strategy]], [[Military doctrine]]''
Military strategy is in many ways the centerpiece of military science. It studies the specifics of planning for, and engaging in combat, and attempts to reduce the many factors to a set of principles that govern all interactions of the field of battle. In Europe these principles were first defined by Clausewitz in his [[Principles of War]]. As such, it directs the planning and execution of battles, operations, and wars as a whole. Two major systems prevail on the planet today. Broadly speaking, these may be described as the "Western" system, and the "Russian" system. Each system reflects and supports strengths and weakness in the underlying society.

Modern Western military art is composed primarily of an amalgam of French, German, British, and American systems.  The Russian system borrows from these systems as well, either through study, or personal observation in the form of invasion ([[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's War of 1812]], and [[World War II|The Great Patriotic War]]), and form a unique product suited for the conditions practitioners of this system will encounter.  The system that is produced by the analysis provided by Military Art is known as doctrine.

Western military doctrine relies heavily on technology, the use of a well-trained and empowered NCO cadre, and superior information processing and dissemination to provide a level of battlefield awareness that opponents cannot match. Its advantages are extreme flexibility, extreme lethality, and a focus on removing an opponent's [[C4ISTAR|C3I]] (command, communications, control, and intelligence) to paralyze and incapacitate rather than destroying their combat power directly (hopefully saving lives in the process). Its drawbacks are high expense, a reliance on difficult-to-replace personnel, an enormous logistic train, and a difficulty in operating without high technology assets if depleted or destroyed.

Soviet military doctrine (and its descendants, in [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries) relies heavily on masses of machinery and troops, a highly educated (albeit very small) officer corps, and pre-planned missions. Its advantages are that it does not require well educated troops, does not require a large logistic train, is under tight central control, and does not rely on a sophisticated C3I system after the initiation of a course of action. Its disadvantages are inflexibility, a reliance on the shock effect of mass (with a resulting high cost in lives and material), and overall inability to exploit unexpected success or respond to unexpected loss.

Chinese military doctrine is currently in a state of flux as the [[People's Liberation Army]] is evaluating military trends of relevance to China. Chinese military doctrine is influenced by a number of sources including an indigenous classical military tradition characterized by strategists such as [[Sun Tzu]], Western and Soviet influences, as well as indigenous modern strategists such as [[Mao Zedong]]. One distinctive characteristic of Chinese military science is that it places emphasis on the relationship between the military and society as well as viewing military force as merely one part of an overarching [[grand strategy]].

Each system trains its officer corps in its philosophy regarding military art.  The differences in content and emphasis are illustrative. The [[United States Army]] principles of war are defined in the U.S. Army [[List of United States Army Field Manuals#FM 100-5|Field Manual FM&amp;nbsp;100–5]]. The [[Canadian Forces]] principles of war/military science are defined by Land Forces Doctrine and Training System (LFDTS) to focus on ''principles of command'', ''principles of war'', ''operational art and campaign planning'', and ''scientific principles''.

Russian Federation armed forces derive their [[Principles of War|principles of war]] predominantly from those developed during the existence of the Soviet Union. These, although based significantly on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Second World War]] experience in conventional war fighting, have been substantially modified since the introduction of the nuclear arms into strategic considerations.  The [[Soviet–Afghan War]] and the [[First Chechen War|First]] and [[Second Chechen War]]s further modified the principles that Soviet theorists had divided into the operational art and tactics. The very scientific approach to military science thinking in the Soviet union had been perceived as overly rigid at the [[military tactics|tactical level]], and had affected the training in the Russian Federation's much reduced forces to instil greater professionalism and initiative in the forces.

The military [[Principles of War|principles of war]] of the People's Liberation Army were loosely based on those of the Soviet Union until the 1980s when a significant shift begun to be seen in a more regionally-aware, and geographically-specific strategic, operational and tactical thinking in all services. The PLA is currently influenced by three doctrinal schools which both conflict and complement each other: the People's war, the Regional war, and the Revolution in military affairs that led to substantial increase in the defense spending and rate of technological modernisation of the forces.

The differences in the specifics of Military art notwithstanding, Military science strives to provide an integrated picture of the chaos of battle, and illuminate basic insights that apply to all combatants, not just those who agree with your formulation of the principles.

===Military geography===
{{Main|Military geography}}
Military geography encompasses much more than simple protestations to take the high ground. Military geography studies the obvious, the geography of theatres of war, but also the additional characteristics of politics, economics, and other natural features of locations of likely conflict (the political "landscape", for example).  As an example, the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] was predicated on the ability of the Soviet Union to not only successfully invade Afghanistan, but also to militarily and politically flank the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] simultaneously.

==Military systems==
How effectively and efficiently militaries accomplish their operations, missions and tasks is closely related not only to the methods they use, but the equipment and weapons they use.

===Military intelligence===
Military intelligence supports the [[Combat Arms|combat]] commanders' [[decision making process]] by providing [[intelligence analysis]] of [[Intelligence (information gathering)|available data]] from a wide range of sources. To provide that informed analysis the commanders information requirements are identified and input to a process of gathering, analysis, protection, and dissemination of information about the operational environment, hostile, friendly and neutral forces and the civilian population in an area of combat operations, and broader area of interest. Intelligence activities are conducted at all levels from tactical to strategic, in peacetime, the period of transition to war, and during the war.

Most militaries maintain a military intelligence capability to provide analytical and information collection personnel in both specialist units and from other arms and services.  Personnel selected for intelligence duties, whether specialist [[intelligence officer]]s and enlisted soldiers or non-specialist assigned to intelligence may be selected for their analytical abilities and intelligence before receiving formal training.

Military intelligence serves to identify the threat, and provide information on understanding best methods and weapons to use in deterring or defeating it.

===Military logistics===
{{Main|Military logistics}}
The art and science of planning and carrying out the movement and maintenance of military forces. In its most comprehensive sense, it is those aspects or military operations that deal with the design, development, acquisition, storage, distribution, maintenance, evacuation, and disposition of material; the movement, evacuation, and hospitalization of personnel; the acquisition or construction, maintenance, operation, and disposition of facilities; and the acquisition or furnishing of services.

===Military technology and equipment===
{{Main|Military technology}}
Military technology is not just the study of various technologies and applicable physical sciences used to increase military power.  It may also extend to the study of production methods of military equipment, and ways to improve performance and reduce material and/or technological requirements for its production.  An example is the effort expended by [[Nazism|Nazi]] Germany to produce artificial rubbers and fuels to reduce or eliminate their dependence on imported POL (petroleum, oil, and lubricants) and rubber supplies.

Military technology is unique only in its application, not in its use of basic scientific and technological achievements.  Because of the uniqueness of use, military technological studies strive to incorporate evolutionary, as well as the rare revolutionary technologies, into their proper place of military application.

'''Mongol elements in Western medieval art''' can be seen in European works of art ranging from the 13th to the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;The subject has been especially described by Rosamond E. Mack, in ''Bazaar to Piazza: Islamic Trade and Italian Art, 1300–1600''.&lt;/ref&gt; They encompass artistic areas such as painting and textile manufacture, and mainly consist in the European use of [[Mongol]] [['Phags-pa script]] in Medieval European art, as well as the representation of "Tartar" cloth and Mongol soldiers in a number of contemporary European paintings.

==Mongol script in medieval art==
[[File:Master Of The Isaac Stories - The Doctors of the Church (detail) - WGA14568.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Saint Jerome]] reading a pseudo-Mongol script, consisting of an imitation of blocks of [['Phags-pa script|'Phags-pa letters]], written horizontally rather than vertically. 1296–1300, Church of San Francesco Assisi.&lt;ref&gt;"Texts of Jerome (Fig.43; destroyed in the 1997 earthquake), Augustine, and Pope gregory I are written in squared units of vertical, horizontal, and curved strokes that can be called pseudo-Mongol. Though the artist has aligned the units horizontally on the page in Western style, the script itself imitates 'Phags Pa, which is written vertically", [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA52 Mack, p.52]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the period of interaction between the Mongols and the West, from the late 13th century to early 14th century, some Italian painters incorporated Mongol script (particularly the 'Phags-pa script) into their religious painting.&lt;ref name="Mack 51"&gt;"During the Pax Mongolica a few Italian painters imitated a Mongol script called 'Phags Pa", in [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA51 Mack p.51]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kann 94"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2dt9WrHyed4C&amp;pg=PA94 ''The art, science, and technology of medieval travel'' by Andrea Kann p.94]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples can be seen especially in the frescos of the Upper Church of San Francesco at [[Assisi]], or in the paintings of [[Giotto]] and related painters.&lt;ref name="Kann 94"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Assisi painters, and Giotto as is shown below, were imitating a Mongol script before 1307, when reports of Friar [[John of Montecorvino]]'s success in Beijing arrived in the West, precipitating major missionary efforts in central Asia and China" [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA51 Mack, p.51]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Liu Yigong 1324.jpg|thumb|Christian tombstone from [[Quanzhou]] with Mongol [['Phags-pa script|'Phags-pa]] inscriptions, 1324.&lt;ref name="Johnson 73"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kWTDfRythVkC&amp;pg=PA73 ''Jesus on the Silk Road'' by Dale A. Johnson p.73]&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
These inscriptions often imitated the Mongol 'Phags-pa, probably discovered by the artists through Mongol paper money or ''[[paiza]]'' (travel passes) such as those [[Marco Polo]] was issued with during his travels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA52 Mack, p.52]&lt;/ref&gt; Frescos of [[Saint Jerome]], [[Augustine]] and [[Pope Gregory I]] in the [[Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi|Church of San Francesco]] in [[Assisi]] (1296–1300) are known where they study books written in pseudo-Mongol.&lt;ref&gt;"The texts of Jerome (Fig.43, destroyed in the 1997 earthquake), Augustine and Pope Gregory I are written in squared units of vertical, horizontal, and curved strokes that can be called pseudo-Mongol. Though the artist has aligned the units horizontally on the page in Western style, the script itself imitates 'Pags Pa, which is written vertically" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA52 Mack, p.52]&lt;/ref&gt; The famous Renaissance painter Giotto and his pupils often combined Arabic and 'Phags-pa script in their paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA54 Mack, p.54]&lt;/ref&gt; In Giotto's ''The Crucifixion'' (1304-1312/1313), soldiers wear tunics inscribed with pseudo-Mongol bands.&lt;ref name="Mack 61"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA61 Mack, p.61]&lt;/ref&gt; In Giotto's ''Madonna and Child'' (1320–1330), the [[Virgin Mary]]'s robe is decorated with a hem in a mix of Arabic and Mongol script.&lt;ref name="Mack 61"/&gt; Giotto again used the Mongolian script in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]].&lt;ref name="Kann 94"/&gt;

Besides the influence of exchanges between the Western and Mongol realms during the period, the exact reason for the incorporation of Mongol script in early Renaissance painting is unclear. It seems that Westerners believed 13–14th century Middle-Eastern scripts (such as Mongol and Arabic) to be the same as the scripts current during [[Jesus]]'s time, and thus found it natural to represent early Christians in association with them.  This may have been partly because some objects from the Islamic era with inscriptions were treated as relics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA52 Mack, p.52], [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA69 Mack, p.69]&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason might be that artist wished to express a cultural universality for the Christian faith, by blending together various written languages, at a time when the church had strong international ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;"Because the Arabic and 'Pag Pa were associated with the Holy Land and the Early Christian Era, the frames could emphasize the origin and age of the images they surround. Perhaps they marked the imagery of a universal faith, an artistic intention consistent with the Church's contemporary international program." [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA69 Mack, p.69]&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly, the usage of Mongol cultural markers was also a way to express the eastern links of European religious orders such as the Franciscans.&lt;ref name="Kann 94"/&gt;

In the East, a certain degree of cultural and artistic interaction is known due to the development of [[Christianity among the Mongols]]. The use of the Mongol script in association with representations of Christianity can be seen for example in [[Nestorian Christian]] steles, such as those found in [[Quanzhou]] which are dated to the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Johnson 73"/&gt;

The use of [['Phags-pa script|Phags-pa]] Mongol script in Medieval European painting had remained unnoticed however, until it was first identified in the 1980s by the Japanese scholar Hidemichi Tanaka.&lt;ref&gt;"Hidemichi Tanaka in a brilliant insight has persuasively established that Giotto was exposed to Mongol ''Phags-pa'' script, and that he used it as a decorative motif at [[Padua]] and elsewhere." in [https://books.google.com/books?id=IRunTSqY7msC&amp;pg=PA124 Arnold, p.124]&lt;/ref&gt; His findings were published in his 1983 paper ''The Mongolian Script in Giotto Paintings at the Scrovegni Chapel at Padova''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mongolian Script in Giotto Paintings at the Scrovegni Chapel at Padova'' in Europäische Kunst um 1300, Akten des XXV. Internationalen Kongresses für Kunstgechichte, 1983 [https://books.google.com/books?id=f1HJjUB8FhIC&amp;pg=PA96 ''The oliphant: Islamic objects in historical context'' Avinoam Shalem p.96 Note 56]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kufic]] Arabic script is even more often used in a similar way, known as [[Pseudo-Kufic]].

==Mongol Empire "Tatar" textiles in medieval art==
[[File:Simone Martini 078.jpg|thumb|'''Fig. 23''': Small-patterned Tartar-style textiles are worn by [[Gabriel|Angel Gabriel]] in the ''[[Annunciation with St Margaret and St Ansanus|Annunciation]]'' by [[Simone Martini]] (1333).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack, p.35-36]: "A well-documented example of a delayed but creative Italian response to the new Tatar cloths is that of the tiny-pattern design, in which small leaves or plants and animals rhythmically organized in dense, allover composition. (...) During the early fourteenth century, the Angevins of Naples donated numerous Tatar cloths, including velvets, to San Franceso at Assisi. Since Simone executed the painting in Naples, the Tatar cloths, as well as Oriental carpets -also the earliest in Italian painting- and a particular crozier in Figure 65 probably represent prized artifacts at king Robert's court. Later Simone brillantly captured the vibrant shimmering effect of the tiny pattern on a white ground in the archangel Gabriel's robe in the ''Annunciation'' painted for the cathedral of Sienna in 1333 (Fig. 23)" – [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack, p.35]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnold 121"&gt;"Simone Martini (...) depicted this angel wearing a robe of Mongol ''nasij'' cloth -a gold working of leaves on a white background- usually described in western inventories as ''panno tartarico albo ad floria aurea''" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=IRunTSqY7msC&amp;pg=PA121 ''Princely gifts and papal treasures'' by Lauren Arnold p.121]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Around 1300, an influx of Mongol Empire textiles found their way to Italy, and were to prove quite influential in Italian art.&lt;ref&gt;"The Pax Mongolica brought an influx of influential "Tatar" textiles into Italy about 1300 (see for example Fig. 22, 25, 32) and left its mark on fourteenth-century Italian art in Mongol figures, costumes (see Fig. 160), and script (see Fig. 43, 49) in paintings and in references to monuments along the caravan routes on the facades of the Doge's Palace in Venice (see Fig. 10)" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA18 Mack, p.18]&lt;/ref&gt; These textiles even revolutionized Italian textile designs.&lt;ref&gt;"The fabrics that revolutionized Italian textile design beginning about the 1330s were the Tatar cloths arriving from Central Asia and Syria during the Pax Mongolica. Though they were foremost among imports in the Papal collections, probably thanks to [[diplomatic gift]]s from the [[Il-Khanate|Il-Khanids]] of Persia, the new imports attracted no attention from Italian painters for two more decades and from local designers for three.", in [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack, p.35]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1265 and 1308, communications between Western and [[Il-Khanate|Il-Khanid]] rulers led to numerous exchanges of people and presents, as when about 100 Mongols in Mongol dress visited Rome for the [[Papal Jubilee]] of [[Pope Boniface VIII]] in 1300.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA18 Mack, p.18]&lt;/ref&gt; Large quantities of ''panni tartarici'' ([[Tatar]] cloth) were recorded in the Papal inventory of 1295, and must have been diplomatic gifts from the Il-Khanate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA18 Mack, p.18], [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack, p.35]&lt;/ref&gt; Later on Western merchants were also able to purchase such textiles from [[Tabriz]], and the Mongol capital of [[Sultaniya]], established by [[Öljaitü]] between 1305 and 1313, and until the capture of the [[Cilician Armenia]] harbour of [[Ayas, Adana|Ayas]] by the [[Mamluk]]s in 1347.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA16 Mack, p.16-17]&lt;/ref&gt; The Tatar cloths were a produce of transcultural exchange under Mongol rule.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack p.35]: "Tatars cloths were themselves products of transcultural exchange. As the nomadic Mongol warriors became imperial rulers, they adopted many aspects of the sophisticated textile cultures in conquered Islamic lands and developed a preference for silk lavishly ornamented with gold threads. Customarily, the Mongols spared skilled weavers -both Muslim and Chinese- from the sword, distributed them as booty, and transported them to new workshops scattered across the empire. Captive artisans served royal courts, the military and government officials, who were often recruited from the conquered. For example, it is known that [[Herat]]i and Chinese craftsmen worked together, and some Herati were sent back to their homes in eastern Persia (now Afghanistan). The cultural mix among the imperial elite and the craftsmen working for them resulted in a rich and distinctive blend of Islamic and Chinese techniques and patterns."&lt;/ref&gt; They are described as Mongol ''nasij'' cloth, coming from Mongol, by author Lauren Arnold.&lt;ref name="Arnold 121"/&gt;

[[File:Boniface VIII with Tartar cloth.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Boniface VIII]] at the 1300 jubilee with a "Tartar cloth" in front of him, with a "rhythmic Sino-Mongolian pattern".&lt;ref&gt;"In this fragment of the fresco, attributed to Giotto, Pope [[Boniface VIII]] proclaims the jubilee year of 1300. Over the balcony is a "Tartar cloth", one of the many silks presented by the Persian [[Mongol]] ruler, and distinguished by its rhythmic '''Sino-Mongolian''' pattern" "Silk" p.41 [https://books.google.com/books?id=LpVdUddNkGUC&amp;pg=PA41].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Mongol Empire textiles had a strong impact on Italian textile design from around 1330.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack, p.35]&lt;/ref&gt; A type of Tartar cloth that was adopted in the West consisted in small-pattern designs in dense composition. This sort of textile is represented in the clothing of the angel Gabriel in the ''[[The Annunciation (Simone Martini)|Annunciation]]'' by [[Simone Martini]] (1333).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack, p.35-36]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other designs involved naturally flowing compositions of flowers and vines with fantastic animals.&lt;ref name="Mack, p.37"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA37 Mack, p.37]&lt;/ref&gt; Such a textile is depicted as the background curtain in [[Giotto]]'s ''Coronation of the Virgin'' (circa 1330), the earliest such depiction of a Tartar cloth.&lt;ref name="Mack, p.37"/&gt; Chinese types of floral designs were also adopted, as visible in the mantles of Christ and Mary in ''Coronation of the Virgin'' by [[Paolo Veneziano]] (circa 1350).&lt;ref name="Mack, p.38"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA38 Mack, p.38]&lt;/ref&gt;

Transmission of Chinese textile designs from the Mongol [[Yuan Dynasty]] also occurred: Textiles of [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]] in the 14th century incorporated Chinese [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] designs in silk and gold thread, and Italian weavers adopted such designs from the second half of the 14th century, complete with phoenix designs and silk and gold thread. These designs are of Chinese origin, and reached Europe via the Mongol realm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Rosamond E.Mack], {{ISBN|0-520-22131-1}} p.27-49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mongols in European painting==
[[File:Mongol tumen commander.jpg|thumb|200px|Mongol commander of a thousand troops, in [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]]'s ''Martyrdom of the Franciscans'', 1330.]]
Mongols are visible in a variety of European paintings from the 13–14th century. They suggest that Italian artists had been in direct contact with people from [[Tartary]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Legnica.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Legnica|battle of Liegnitz]], 1241, between the Mongols (left) and European knights (right). 14th century.]]
[[File:Kublai giving support to the Venetians.JPG|thumb|left|[[Kubilai Khan]] giving financial support to the Polo family]]
As early as 1253, during the initial encounters of the Mongols with the West following the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]], [[Matthew Paris]] represented Mongol soldiers with their characteristic conical hat as [[cannibals]] in his ''[[Chronica Majora]]''.&lt;ref name="Kann 94"/&gt;

Later, the Mongols would appear in much less caricatural portrayals. The travels of [[Marco Polo]] to the [[Mongol Empire]] gave rise to opulent descriptions of the Mongol ruler [[Kublai Khan]] and his court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KuLCCXVebuEC&amp;pg=PA36 ''America views China: American images of China then and now'' by Jonathan Goldstein,Jerry Israel,Hilary Conroy p.36]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mongols were then occasionally incorporated in the work of European painters, particularly illustrations of events in Asia or the [[Holy Land]]. Among other works, Mongol horsemen appear in the ''Crucifixion of Saint Peter'', [[Giotto]], circa 1299, probably following the visit of Mongol visitors from the East, such as the Mongol delegation who is known to have participated to the 1300 [[Papal Jubilee]] in Rome.&lt;ref name="Arnold 54"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IRunTSqY7msC&amp;pg=PA54 Arnold, p.54]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mongol archers are also shown shooting at [[Saint Sebastian|Sebastian]] in ''Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian'', [[Giovanni del Biondo]], circa 1370,&lt;ref name="Arnold, p.113"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IRunTSqY7msC&amp;pg=PA113 Arnold, p.113]&lt;/ref&gt; and Mongol commanders in uniform appear in [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]]'s ''Martyrdom of the Franciscans'' (1285–1348) with their characteristic conical hat decorated with a feather.&lt;ref name="Kann 94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosamond E. Mack p. 151"&gt;Rosamond E. Mack, ''Bazaar to Piazza: Islamic Trade and Italian Art 1300–1600'' ({{ISBN|0-520-22131-1}}), p. 151: "The Mongol physiognomies of the ruler and two warriors wearing tall pointed hats, however, were probably observed among emissaries whom the Il-Khanids sent to Italy during the first decades of the fourteenth century. This hat with a neck-covered flap and feather on top accurately depicts the headgear of commanders of one thousand men in the Mongol army. Such headgear might even have been seen in [[Siena]]: perhaps [[Tommaso Ugi di Siena|Tommaso Ugi]], a Sienese who had taken the name Tumen, had visited Siena when he accompanied the Il-Khanid emissaries in 1301."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mack, p.18"&gt;Mack notes the "Mongol figures and costumes" in the painting: "Mongol figures, costumes (see Fig. 160)", [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA18 Mack, p.18]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physiology ==

=== Neurovascular patterning ===
Neurovascular development is the parallel emergence and patterning of the nervous system and the vascular system during embryogenesis and early life.&lt;ref name=bautch/&gt;&lt;ref name=vallon/&gt; Neurovascular congruency appears to be determined by shared molecular patterning mechanism involving [[axon guidance]] that involves axonal guidance molecules such as [[SEMA3A|sema3A]] ([[semaphorin]] 3A) and ([[neuropilin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12618135|year=2003|author1=Bates|first1=D|title=Neurovascular congruence results from a shared patterning mechanism that utilizes Semaphorin3A and Neuropilin-1|journal=Developmental Biology|volume=255|issue=1|pages=77–98|last2=Taylor|first2=G. I.|last3=Minichiello|first3=J|last4=Farlie|first4=P|last5=Cichowitz|first5=A|last6=Watson|first6=N|last7=Klagsbrun|first7=M|last8=Mamluk|first8=R|last9=Newgreen|first9=D. F.|doi=10.1016/s0012-1606(02)00045-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mechanisms ===
Neuroangiogenic and axonal guidance molecules act on both [[Growth cones|neuronal growth cones]] and endothelial tip cells in order to guide growth.&lt;ref name=vallon/&gt;

Neuronal growth cones are situated on the tips of nerve cells and are responsive to different factors, both positive and negative. Growth of the neuron occurs by an extension of the [[actin]] (red in image) and [[microtubule]] (green in image) cytoskeleton.&lt;ref name="park"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=14592405|year=2003|author1=Park|first1=J. A.|title=Coordinated interaction of the vascular and nervous systems: From molecule- to cell-based approaches|journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications|volume=311|issue=2|pages=247–53|last2=Choi|first2=K. S.|last3=Kim|first3=S. Y.|last4=Kim|first4=K. W.|doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2003.09.129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Growthcone.jpg|thumbnail|Neuronal growth cone]]

Tip cells found at the extremity of the developing blood vessel control adjacent endothelial cells to direct growth. Tip cells have receptors and ligands via which they respond to local neuroangiogenic factors.&lt;ref name=park/&gt;

== Neurogenic factors ==
There are many neuroangiogenic factors, some of which act to promote neuronal growth and vice versa.&lt;ref name=vallon/&gt; The table shows examples
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Neuroangiogenic factor !! Effect on neuron !! Effect on vascular endothelial cells !! Receptor/Ligand !! Origin
|-

|-
| [[vascular endothelial growth factor|VEGF]] || Neuronal development and patterning, and has [[neurotrophic]] and [[neuroprotective]] effects || Induces angiogenesis, promotes [[endothelial cell]] survival, proliferation and migration || Ligand || Multiple
|-
|}

== Pathology ==
Neuroangiogenesis is implicated in a number of pathologies, including endometriosis,&lt;ref name=asante/&gt; brain tumors,&lt;ref name=vallon/&gt; and senile [[dementias]], such as Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name=ambrose/&gt; Each of these incurs a significant cost for the healthcare industry, meaning that complete understanding of processes involved &amp;ndash; including neuroangiogenesis &amp;ndash; is necessary to enable development of functional treatments.&lt;ref name=vallon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=24859987|pmc=4337970|year=2014|author1=Morotti|first1=M|title=Peripheral changes in endometriosis-associated pain|journal=Human Reproduction Update|volume=20|issue=5|pages=717–36|last2=Vincent|first2=K|last3=Brawn|first3=J|last4=Zondervan|first4=K. T.|last5=Becker|first5=C. M.|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmu021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Endometriosis ===

[[Endometriosis]] is a common [[gynaecological disease]] caused by endometrial tissue implanting outside the [[uterus]], a symptom of which is chronic pelvic pain. The formation, growth and persistence of these implants are dependent upon angiogenesis to increase the supply of blood vessels. The resulting increase in blood flow may correlate directly with pain symptoms.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} One possible explanation for this is the simultaneous growth of neurons into these areas alongside blood vessels through neuroangiogenesis.&lt;ref name=asante/&gt;

===Brain tumors===

Brain tumors, such as [[glioblastoma multiforme]], are characterized by dense vascularity associated with high expression of the proangiogenic factors, VEGF and [[interleukin 8]].&lt;ref name=vallon/&gt;

===Brain injury===

Following [[ischemic stroke]] or [[traumatic brain injury]], angiogenesis supports oxygen and nutrient re-supply to injured tissue, and stimulates [[neurogenesis]] and [[synaptogenesis]], particularly in the [[penumbra (medicine)|ischemic penumbra]].&lt;ref name=vallon/&gt; Neuroangiogenesis is finely regulated and sequential, involving proliferation and migration of [[endothelial cells]] to restore [[blood-brain barrier]] function, recruitment of [[pericytes]], and stabilization new blood vessels, a process dependent on [[upregulation]] of proangiogenic factors, such as VEGF and [[angiopoietin-1]].&lt;ref name=vallon/&gt;

=== Alzheimer’s disease ===

A condition possibly resulting from a reduction in neuroangiogenic factors is Alzheimer’s disease. Without continued neuroangiogenesis during aging, areas of the brain may no longer have the full complement of functional [[capillaries]] and hence, by inference, [[cerebral blood flow]] and [[cognitive ability]] decline.&lt;ref name=vallon/&gt;&lt;ref name=ambrose/&gt; This condition of reduced neuroangiogenesis and lower capillary density during [[senescence]], possibly involving impaired regulation of angiogenic factors by [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], could be a vascular basis for Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name=vallon/&gt;&lt;ref name=ambrose/&gt;&lt;ref name="ambrose2"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=27392865|year=2016|author1=Ambrose|first1=C. T.|title=The Role of Capillaries in the Lesser Ailments of Old Age and in Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Dementia: The Potential of Pro-Therapeutic Angiogenesis|journal=Journal of Alzheimer's Disease|volume=54|issue=1|pages=31–43|doi=10.3233/JAD-160303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many adult orchids retain their fungal symbionts, although the benefits to the adult [[photosynthetic]] orchid and the fungus remain largely unexplored.

==Seed germination ==
[[File:Anacamptis fragrans.JPG|thumb|Orchid protocorm]]
Orchids have several life stages. The first stage is the non-germinated orchid seed, the next stage is the protocorm, and the following stage is the adult orchid. Orchid seeds are very small 0.35mm to 1.50mm long), spindle-shaped, and have an opening at the pointed end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arditti|first=Joseph|last2=Michaud|first2=Justine D.|last3=Healey|first3=Patrick L.|date=1979|title=Morphometry of Orchid Seeds.

== Fungal entry into orchid ==
The fungus can enter at various orchid life stages. Fungal hyphae can penetrate the parenchyma cells of geminated orchid seeds, protocorms, late-staged seedlings, or adult plant roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Molecular mycorrhizal symbiosis |last=Martin |first=Francis |isbn=9781118951415|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|oclc=958205579|date=2016-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fungal hyphae that enter the orchid have many mitochondria and few vacuoles.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Peterson|first=R.

== Fungi forming orchid mycorrhizae ==
'''Basidiomycetous Rhizoctonia Fungi'''

The fungi that form orchid mycorrhizae are typically [[basidiomycetes]]. These fungi come from a range of taxa including ''[[Ceratobasidium]]'' ([[Rhizoctonia]]), ''[[Sebacina]]'', ''[[Tulasnella]]'' and ''[[Russula]]'' species. Most orchids associate with [[saprotrophic]] or [[pathogenic]] fungi, while a few associate with [[ectomycorrhizal]] fungal species. These latter associations are often called tripartite associations as they involve the orchid, the ectomycorrhizal fungus and its photosynthetic host plant. Some of the challenges in determining host-specificity in orchid mycorrhizae have been the methods of identifying the orchid-specific fungi from other free living fungal species in wild-sourced samples. Even with modern molecular analysis and genomic databases, this can still prove difficult,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;McCormick, M. K., Whigham, D. F. and O'Neill, J. (2004), Mycorrhizal diversity in photosynthetic terrestrial orchids. New Phytologist, 163: 425–438. doi:10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01114.x&lt;/ref&gt; partially due to the difficulty in culturing fungi from protocorms and identification of fungal samples,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; as well as changes in evolving rDNA.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacquemyn|first=Hans|last2=Honnay|first2=Olivier|last3=Cammue|first3=Bruno P.

'''Ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycota'''

A number of other basidiomycetous fungi have been documented in various orchids that do not fall under the Rhizoctonia umbrella. In particular, many fully mycoheterotrophic orchids associate with ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes belonging to genera such as Thelephora, Tomentella and Russula. 

'''Basidiomycetes of the Atractiellales'''

'''Ascomycota'''

Though rare in orchids, ascomycete associations have been documented in several orchid species. The European terrestrial orchid Epipactis helleborine has a specific association with ectomycorrhizal ascomycetes in the Tuberaceae.

== Symbiont specificity ==
Current molecular analysis has allowed for the identification of specific taxa forming symbiotic relationships which are of interest in the study, cultivation, and conservation of orchids.

'''Reed–Muller codes''' are [[error-correcting code]]s that are used in wireless communications applications, particularly in deep-space communication&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Massey|first=James L.|date=1992|pages=1–17|publisher=Springer-Verlag|language=en|doi=10.1007/bfb0036046|isbn=978-3540558514|title=Advanced Methods for Satellite and Deep Space Communications|volume=182|series=Lecture Notes in Control and Information Sciences|chapter=Deep-space communications and coding: A marriage made in heaven|citeseerx=10.1.1.36.4265}}[[https://www.isiweb.ee.ethz.ch/archive/massey_pub/pdf/BI321.pdf pdf]]&lt;/ref&gt;. Moreover, the proposed [[5G|5G standard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/tsg_ran/WG1_RL1/TSGR1_87/Report/Final_Minutes_report_RAN1%2387_v100.zip|title=3GPP RAN1 meeting #87 final report|publisher=3GPP|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; relies on the closely related [[Polar code (coding theory)|polar codes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5075875/|title=Channel Polarization: A Method for Constructing Capacity-Achieving Codes for Symmetric Binary-Input Memoryless Channels - IEEE Journals &amp; Magazine|journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Theory|volume=55|issue=7|pages=3051–3073|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-31|doi=10.1109/TIT.2009.2021379|year=2009|last1=Arikan|first1=Erdal|hdl=11693/11695}}&lt;/ref&gt; for error correction in the control channel. Due to their favorable theoretical and mathematical properties, Reed–Muller codes have also been extensively studied in [[theoretical computer science]].

Reed–Muller codes generalize the [[Reed–Solomon error correction|Reed–Solomon codes]] and the [[Hadamard code|Walsh–Hadamard code]]. Reed–Muller codes are [[Linear code|linear block codes]] that are [[locally testable code|locally testable]], [[locally decodable code|locally decodable]], and [[List decoding|list decodable]]. These properties make them particularly useful in the design of [[probabilistically checkable proof]]s.

Traditional Reed–Muller codes are binary codes, which means that messages and codewords are binary strings. When ''r'' and ''m'' are integers with 0 ≤ ''r'' ≤ ''m'', the Reed–Muller code with parameters  ''r'' and ''m'' is denoted as RM(''r'',&amp;nbsp;''m''). When asked to encode a message consisting of ''k'' bits, where  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle k=\sum_{i=0}^r \binom{m}{i}&lt;/math&gt;to produce a holds, the RM(''r'',&amp;nbsp;''m'') code produces a codeword consisting of 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; bits.

Reed–Muller codes are named after [[David E. Muller]], who discovered the codes in 1954&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muller|first=David E.|date=1954|title=Application of Boolean algebra to switching circuit design and to error detection|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6499441/?reload=true|journal=Transactions of the I.R.E.

Reed]], who proposed the first efficient decoding algorithm&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reed|first=Irving S.|date=1954|title=A class of multiple-error-correcting codes and the decoding scheme|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1057465/?reload=true|journal=Transactions of the IRE Professional Group on Information Theory|language=en-US|volume=4|issue=4|pages=38–49|doi=10.1109/tit.1954.1057465|issn=2168-2690|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Description using low-degree polynomials==
Reed–Muller codes can be described in several different (but ultimately equivalent) ways. The description that is based on low-degree polynomials is quite elegant and particularly suited for their application as [[locally testable code]]s and [[locally decodable code]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Prahladh Harsha et al., [[arxiv:1002.3864|Limits of Approximation Algorithms: PCPs and Unique Games (DIMACS Tutorial Lecture Notes)]], Section 5.2.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Encoder ===
A [[block code]] can have one or more encoding functions &lt;math display="inline"&gt; C:\{0,1\}^k\to\{0,1\}^{n} &lt;/math&gt; that map messages &lt;math display="inline"&gt; x\in\{0,1\}^k &lt;/math&gt; to codewords &lt;math display="inline"&gt; C(x)\in\{0,1\}^{n} &lt;/math&gt;. The Reed&amp;ndash;Muller code {{nowrap|RM(''r'', ''m'')}} has [[Block code#The message length k|message length]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle k=\sum_{i=0}^r \binom{m}{i}&lt;/math&gt; and [[Block code#The block length n|block length]]  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n=2^m&lt;/math&gt;. One way to define an encoding for this code is based on the evaluation of [[Multilinear polynomial|multilinear polynomials]] with ''m'' variables and [[total degree]] ''r''. Every multilinear polynomial over the [[finite field]] with two elements can be written as follows:
&lt;math display="block"&gt;p_c(Z_1,\dots,Z_m) = \sum_{\underset{|S|\le r}{S\subseteq\{1,\dots,m\}}} c_S\cdot \prod_{i\in S} Z_i\,.&lt;/math&gt;
The &lt;math display="inline"&gt; Z_1,\dots,Z_m &lt;/math&gt; are the variables of the polynomial, and the values &lt;math display="inline"&gt; c_S\in\{0,1\} &lt;/math&gt; are the coefficients of the polynomial. Since there are exactly &lt;math display="inline"&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; coefficients, the message &lt;math display="inline"&gt; x\in\{0,1\}^k &lt;/math&gt; can be used as these coefficients. In this way, each message &lt;math display="inline"&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; gives rise to a unique polynomial &lt;math display="inline"&gt; p_x &lt;/math&gt; in ''m'' variables. To construct the codeword &lt;math display="inline"&gt; C(x) &lt;/math&gt;, the encoder evaluates &lt;math display="inline"&gt; p_x &lt;/math&gt; at all evaluation points &lt;math display="inline"&gt; a\in\{0,1\}^m &lt;/math&gt;, where it interprets the sum as addition modulo two in order to obtain a bit &lt;math display="inline"&gt;(p_x(a)\bmod 2) \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the encoding function is defined via&lt;math display="block"&gt;C(x) = \left(p_x(a)\bmod 2\right)_{a\in\{0,1\}^m}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The fact that the codeword &lt;math&gt;C(x)&lt;/math&gt; suffices to uniquely reconstruct &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; follows from [[Lagrange polynomial|Lagrange interpolation]], which states that the coefficients of a polynomial are uniquely determined when sufficiently many evaluation points are given. Since &lt;math&gt;C(0)=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C(x+y)=C(x)+C(y) \bmod 2&lt;/math&gt; holds for all messages &lt;math&gt;x,y\in\{0,1\}^k&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a [[linear map]]. Thus the Reed&amp;ndash;Muller code is a [[linear code]].

===== Example =====
For the code {{nowrap|RM(''2'', ''4'')}}, the parameters are as follows:

&lt;math display="inline"&gt; \begin{align}
r&amp;=2\\
m&amp;=4\\
k&amp;=\textstyle\binom{4}{2}+\binom{4}{1}+\binom{4}{0}= 6+4+1=11\\
n&amp;=2^m=16\\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math display="inline"&gt; C:\{0,1\}^{11}\to\{0,1\}^{16} &lt;/math&gt; be the encoding function just defined. To encode the string x = 1 1010 010101 of length 11, the encoder first constructs the polynomial &lt;math display="inline"&gt; p_x &lt;/math&gt; in 4 variables:&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}
p_x(Z_1,Z_2,Z_3,Z_4)
&amp;= 1
+ (1\cdot Z_1 + 0\cdot Z_2 + 1\cdot Z_3 + 0\cdot Z_4)
+ (0\cdot Z_1 Z_2 + 1\cdot Z_1Z_3 + 0\cdot Z_1Z_4 + 1\cdot Z_2Z_3 + 0\cdot Z_2Z_4+ 1\cdot Z_3Z_4)\\
&amp;=1+Z_1+Z_3+Z_1Z_3+Z_2Z_3+Z_3Z_4
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;Then it evaluates this polynomial at all 16 evaluation points:&lt;math display="block"&gt;p_x(0000)= 1,\;
p_x(0001)= 1,\;
p_x(0010)= 1,\;
p_x(0011)= 1,\;

p_x(0100)= 1,\;
p_x(0101)= 0,\;
p_x(0110)= 1,\;
p_x(0111)= 0,\;

p_x(1000)= 0,\;
p_x(1001)= 1,\;
p_x(1010)= 0,\;
p_x(1011)= 1,\;

p_x(1100)= 0,\;
p_x(1101)= 0,\;
p_x(1110)= 0,\;
p_x(1111)= 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;As a result, C(1 1010 010101) = 1111 1010 0101 0000 holds.

=== Decoder ===
{{Expand section|date=August 2018}}
As was already mentioned, Lagrange interpolation can be used to efficiently retrieve the message from a codeword. However, a decoder needs to work even if the codeword has been corrupted in a few positions, that is, when the received word is different from any codeword. In this case, a local decoding procedure can help.

=== Generalization to larger alphabets via low-degree polynomials ===
Using low-degree polynomials over a finite field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F&lt;/math&gt; of size &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, it is possible to extend the definition of Reed&amp;ndash;Muller codes to alphabets of size &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; be positive integers, where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; should be thought of as larger than &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;. To encode a message &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x\in\mathbb F^k&lt;/math&gt; of with &lt;math&gt;k=\textstyle\binom{m+d}{m}&lt;/math&gt;, the message is again interpreted an &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;-variate polynomial &lt;math&gt;p_x&lt;/math&gt; of total degree at most &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and with coefficient from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F&lt;/math&gt;. Such a polynomial indeed has &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\binom{m+d}{m}&lt;/math&gt; coefficients. The Reed–Muller encoding of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the list of all evaluations of &lt;math&gt;p_x(a)&lt;/math&gt; over all &lt;math&gt;a\in\mathbb F^m&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the block length is &lt;math&gt;n=q^m&lt;/math&gt;.

== Description using a generator matrix ==
{{Confusing section|date=March 2011|reason=this section uses dense notation that is not explained well for most readers}}

A generator matrix for a Reed&amp;ndash;Muller code {{nowrap|RM(''r'', ''m'')}} of length {{nowrap|1=''N'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be constructed as follows. Let us write the set of all ''m''-dimensional binary vectors as:

:&lt;math&gt; X = \mathbb{F}_2^m = \{ x_1, \ldots, x_{N} \}.  &lt;/math&gt;

We define in ''N''-dimensional space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2^N&lt;/math&gt; the [[indicator vector]]s

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{I}_A \in \mathbb{F}_2^N&lt;/math&gt;

on subsets &lt;math&gt; A \subset X &lt;/math&gt; by:

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \mathbb{I}_A \right)_i = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \mbox{ if } x_i \in A \\ 0 &amp; \mbox{ otherwise} \\ \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

together with, also in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2^N&lt;/math&gt;, the binary operation

:&lt;math&gt; w \wedge z = (w_1 \cdot z_1, \ldots , w_N \cdot z_N ), &lt;/math&gt;

referred to as the ''wedge product'' (not to be confused with the [[wedge product]] defined in exterior algebra). Here, &lt;math&gt;w=(w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_N)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z=(z_1,z_2,\ldots, z_N)&lt;/math&gt; are points in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2^N&lt;/math&gt; (''N''-dimensional binary vectors), and the operation &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; is the usual multiplication in the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2^m&lt;/math&gt; is an ''m''-dimensional vector space over the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2&lt;/math&gt;, so it is possible to write

&lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{F}_2)^m = \{ (y_m, \ldots , y_1) \mid y_i \in \mathbb{F}_2 \} .&lt;/math&gt;

We define in ''N''-dimensional space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2^N&lt;/math&gt; the following vectors with length &lt;math&gt; N: v_0 = (1,1,\ldots,1) &lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt; v_i = \mathbb{I}_{ H_i } ,&lt;/math&gt;

where 1 ≤ i ≤ ''m'' and the ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[hyperplane]]s in &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{F}_2)^m&lt;/math&gt; (with dimension {{nowrap|''m'' &amp;minus; 1}}):

:&lt;math&gt;H_i = \{ y \in ( \mathbb{F}_2 ) ^m \mid y_i = 0 \} .&lt;/math&gt;

====The generator matrix====
The Reed&amp;ndash;Muller {{nowrap|RM(''r'', ''m'')}} code of order ''r'' and length ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; is the code generated by ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and the wedge products of up to ''r'' of the ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, {{nowrap|1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''m''}}  (where by convention a wedge product of fewer than one vector is the identity for the operation). In other words, we can build a generator matrix for the {{nowrap|RM(''r'', ''m'')}} code, using vectors and their wedge product permutations up to ''r'' at a time &lt;math&gt;{v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_n, \ldots, (v_{i_1} \wedge v_{i_2}), \ldots (v_{i_1} \wedge v_{i_2} \ldots \wedge v_{i_r})}&lt;/math&gt;, as the rows of the generator matrix, where {{nowrap|1 ≤ ''i''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''m''}}.

====Example 1====

Let ''m'' = 3. Then ''N'' = 8, and

:&lt;math&gt; X = \mathbb{F}_2^3 = \{ (0,0,0), (0,0,1),  \ldots, (1,1,1) \}, &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
v_0 &amp; = (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1) \\[2pt]
v_1 &amp; = (1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0) \\[2pt]
v_2 &amp; = (1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0) \\[2pt]
v_3 &amp; = (1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The RM(1,3) code is generated by the set

:&lt;math&gt; \{ v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3 \},\, &lt;/math&gt;

or more explicitly by the rows of the matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Example 2====

The RM(2,3) code is generated by the set:
:&lt;math&gt; \{ v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3, v_1 \wedge v_2, v_1 \wedge v_3, v_2 \wedge v_3 \} &lt;/math&gt;

or more explicitly by the rows of the matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Properties===
The following properties hold:

# The set of all possible wedge products of up to ''m'' of the ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; form a basis for &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2^N&lt;/math&gt;.
# The RM&amp;thinsp;(''r'', ''m'') code has [[linear code|rank]]
#:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{s=0}^r {m \choose s}. &lt;/math&gt;
# {{math|1=RM&amp;thinsp;(''r'', ''m'') = RM&amp;thinsp;(''r'', ''m ''&amp;minus; 1) {{!}} RM&amp;thinsp;(''r'' &amp;minus; 1, ''m'' &amp;minus; 1)}} where '|' denotes the [[bar product (coding theory)|bar product]] of two codes.
# {{math|1=RM&amp;thinsp;(''r'', ''m'')}} has minimum [[Hamming weight]] 2&lt;sup&gt;''m'' &amp;minus; ''r''&lt;/sup&gt;.

====Proof====
{{Ordered list
|
There are

::&lt;math&gt; \sum_{s=0}^m { m \choose s } = 2^m = N &lt;/math&gt;

such vectors and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2^N&lt;/math&gt; have dimension ''N'' so it is sufficient to check that the ''N'' vectors span; equivalently it is sufficient to check that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RM}(m, m) = \mathbb{F}_2^N&lt;/math&gt;.

Let ''x'' be a binary vector of length ''m'', an element of ''X''.  Let (''x'')&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; element of ''x''.  Define

::&lt;math&gt;y_i = \begin{cases} v_i &amp; \text{ if } (x)_i = 0 \\ v_0+v_i &amp; \text{ if } (x)_i = 1 \\ \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;
where 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤''m''.

Then &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{I}_{ \{ x \} } = y_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge y_m &lt;/math&gt;

Expansion via the distributivity of the wedge product gives &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{I}_{ \{ x \} } \in \mathrm{RM}(m,m) &lt;/math&gt;. Then since the vectors &lt;math&gt;\{ \mathbb{I}_{ \{ x \} } \mid x \in X \} &lt;/math&gt; span &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2^N&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RM}(m,n)=\mathbb{F}_2^N&lt;/math&gt;.

|
By '''1''', all such wedge products must be linearly independent, so the rank of RM(''r, m'') must simply be the number of such vectors.

Omitted.

By induction.

:The {{math|1=RM(0,&amp;nbsp;''m'')}} code is the repetition code of length {{math|1=''N''&amp;nbsp;=2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and weight ''N'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&amp;minus;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&amp;minus;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;. By '''1''' &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RM}(m,n)=\mathbb{F}_2^n&lt;/math&gt; and has weight 1 = 2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&amp;minus;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;.

The article [[bar product (coding theory)]] gives a proof that the weight of the bar product of two codes ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; , ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is given by

::&lt;math&gt;\min \{ 2w(C_1), w(C_2) \} &lt;/math&gt;

:If 0 &lt; ''r'' &lt; ''m'' and if {{Ordered list |list_style_type=lower-roman
|{{math|1=RM(''r'',''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)}} has weight {{math|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&amp;minus;1&amp;minus;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;}}
|{{math|1=RM(''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)}} has weight {{math|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&amp;minus;1&amp;minus;(''r''&amp;minus;1)&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&amp;minus;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;}}
}}
:then the bar product has weight

::&lt;math&gt;\min \{ 2 \times 2^{m-1-r}, 2^{m-r} \} = 2^{m-r} .&lt;/math&gt;
}}
=== Decoding RM codes ===
RM(''r'', ''m'') codes can be decoded using [[majority logic decoding]]. The basic idea of majority logic decoding is
to build several checksums for each received code word element. Since each of the different checksums must all
have the same value (i.e. the value of the message word element weight), we can use a majority logic decoding to decipher
the value of the message word element. Once each order of the polynomial is decoded, the received word is modified
accordingly by removing the corresponding codewords weighted by the decoded message contributions, up to the present stage.
So for a ''r''th order RM code, we have to decode iteratively r+1, times before we arrive at the final
received code-word. Also, the values of the message bits are calculated through this scheme; finally we can calculate
the codeword by multiplying the message word (just decoded) with the generator matrix.

One clue if the decoding succeeded, is to have an all-zero modified received word, at the end of (''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-stage decoding
through the majority logic decoding. This technique was proposed by Irving S. Reed, and is more general when applied
to other finite geometry codes.

==Description using a recursive construction==

A Reed–Muller code RM(''r,m'') exists for any integers &lt;math&gt;m \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 \le r \le m&lt;/math&gt;. RM(''m'', ''m'') is defined as the universe (&lt;math&gt;2^m,2^m,1&lt;/math&gt;) code. RM(&amp;minus;1,m) is defined as the trivial code (&lt;math&gt;2^m,0,\infty&lt;/math&gt;). The remaining RM codes may be constructed from these elementary codes using the length-doubling construction

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RM}(r,m) = \{(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v})\mid\mathbf{u} \in \mathrm{RM}(r,m-1),\mathbf{v} \in \mathrm{RM}(r-1,m-1)\}.&lt;/math&gt;

From this construction, RM(''r,m'') is a binary [[linear block code]] (''n'', ''k'', ''d'') with length {{math|1=''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, dimension &lt;math&gt;k(r,m)=k(r,m-1)+k(r-1,m-1)&lt;/math&gt; and minimum distance &lt;math&gt;d = 2^{m-r}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;r \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;. The [[dual code]] to RM(''r,m'') is RM(''m''-''r''-1,''m''). This shows that repetition and SPC codes are duals, biorthogonal and extended Hamming codes are duals and that codes with {{math|1=''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''/2}} are self-dual.

Graham of the [[Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory]], in [[La Serena, Chile]]. Specifically, their conclusion was that a sample of [[galaxies]] (referred to as [[Galaxy morphological classification|ScI]]) was, on the whole, moving with a velocity of 885&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; toward a specific astronomical position (l = 304°, b = 26°) relative to the [[cosmic microwave background radiation|microwave background radiation]], which, because it is isotropic, provided a frame of reference for the measurement.&lt;ref name=Jones92_02&gt;{{cite book | author = Bernard J.T.

'''Science Research Associates Inc.''', commonly known as '''SRA''', is a [[Chicago]]-based publisher of educational materials and schoolroom reading comprehension products.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://www.sraonline.com/about_history.html SRA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Science Research Associates Inc. was founded in 1938.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; Early on, it had a trade and occupational focus. In 1957, it moved into individualized classroom instruction with the iconic SRA [[Reading (process)|Reading]] Laboratory Kit, a format that later translated to mathematics, science, and social studies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Commonly called '''SRA cards''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/lost-generation-finds-new-pride-20100604-xkiv.html|title=Lost generation finds new pride|first= Miranda |last= Devine|work= [[Sydney Morning Herald]]| date= 2010-06-05|accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the labs were large boxes filled with color-coded cardboard sheets. Each sheet included a reading exercise for students. Each student would have an independent topic, and would work on it independently of the other students in the class, consulting with the teacher only if they got stuck. The student would then follow up with [[multiple choice]] questions. As the child moved ahead, he or she would advance in difficulty.

SRA was purchased by [[IBM]] in 1964,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://ed-thelen.org/1401Project/Highlights-of-IBM-History.html| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071206054110/http://ed-thelen.org/1401Project/Highlights-of-IBM-History.html| website= ed-thelen.org| title= Highlights of IBM History| archivedate= December 6, 2007| access-date= July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by that time its products geared to primary and secondary schools had increased, especially at a time when math education was seen as critical during the [[Cold War]] and [[Space Race]]. Despite being an IBM subsidiary, SRA produced both [[IBM PC]] and [[Apple II]] software in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="pc198311"&gt;{{cite news | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=q8fwTt09_MEC&amp;lpg=RA1-PA696&amp;pg=RA1-PA265#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title=Cross Clues / Free Enterprise | work=PC Magazine | date=November 1983 | accessdate= 22 October 2013 | author=Advertisement | pages=263, 265}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maxwell Communications Corporation]] bought SRA in 1988. SRA became part of [[Macmillan/McGraw-Hill]] when the joint venture with [[McGraw-Hill]] was created in 1989. When Maxwell Communications collapsed, McGraw-Hill acquired full ownership of Macmillan/McGraw-Hill and SRA.

==Educational programs==
Since the 1960s, SRA has been the publisher of Direct Instruction programs, also known as [[DISTAR]] (Direct Instruction System for Teaching Arithmetic and Reading).  These include ''Language for Learning, Reading Mastery, Reasoning and Writing, Connecting Math Concepts'' and ''Corrective Reading''.  SRA purchased [[Open Court Reading]] in the 1990s.

In the early 2000s, the company was purchased by [[McGraw-Hill Education]] and the brand name and products are now part of the PreK-12 business of McGraw-Hill Education.  The ''Imagine It!'' reading program was launched in 2007.  McGraw-Hill Education also competes as a publisher of mathematics and science materials with programs such as ''Real Math, Number Worlds'' and ''Snapshots Video Science''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2166">'''Stand-up tragedy''' is a style of tragic performance where a performer performs in front of a live audience, speaking directly to them.

==Format==
Stand-up tragedy performances are usually long and employ the use of various media such as video, audio, highly emotional monologues and rants where the performer recites a fast-paced succession of tragic and disturbing stories.  Stand-up tragedy is often performed in bars, nightclubs, private homes, art museums, galleries and universities.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, Jon. "Interview: Bryan Lewis Saunders." ''Rhythmplex'' April 2009.

The origin of the term Stand up tragedy is unknown.{{cn|date=February 2016}} The comedian [[Brother Theodore]] (1906–2001) used the term to describe his comedic act which was dark, and had an absurdist edge.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Douglas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3317">[[Image:Survivorship Curves.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|An illustration of the three idealized types of curve (logarithmic scale)]]
A '''survivorship curve''' is a [[chart|graph]] showing the number or proportion of individuals surviving to each age for a given species or group (e.g. males or females). Survivorship curves can be constructed for a given [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]] (a group of individuals of roughly the same age) based on a [[life table]].

There are three generalized types of survivorship curves:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/712136178|title=Campbell biology|last=B.|first=Reece, Jane|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Pearson Australia|isbn=9781442531765|oclc=712136178}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Type I'' or convex curves are characterized by high age-specific survival probability in early and middle life, followed by a rapid decline in survival in later life. They are typical of species that produce few offspring but care for them well, including [[human]]s and many other large mammals.
* ''Type II'' or diagonal curves are an intermediate between Types I and III, where roughly constant [[mortality rate]]/survival probability is experienced regardless of age. Some [[bird]]s and some [[lizard]]s follow this pattern.
* ''Type III'' or concave curves have the greatest mortality (lowest age-specific survival) early in life, with relatively low rates of death (high probability of survival) for those surviving this bottleneck. This type of curve is characteristic of species that produce a large number of offspring (see [[r/K selection theory]]).  This includes most marine invertebrates.  For example, [[oyster]]s produce millions of eggs, but most larvae die from predation or other causes; those that survive long enough to produce a hard shell live relatively long.
The number or proportion of organisms surviving to any age is plotted on the [[Cartesian coordinate system|y-axis]] (generally with a [[logarithmic scale]] starting with 1000 individuals), while their age (often as a proportion of [[maximum life span]]) is plotted on the x-axis.

In mathematical statistics, the [[survival function]] is one specific form of survivorship curve and plays a basic part in [[survival analysis]].

There are various reasons that a species exhibits their particular survivorship curve, but one contributor can be environmental factors that decrease survival. For example, an outside element that is nondiscriminatory in the ages that it affects (of a particular species) is likely to yield a Type II survivorship curve, in which the young and old are equally likely to be affected. On the other hand, an outside element that preferentially reduces the survival of young individuals is likely to yield a Type III curve. Finally, if an outside element only reduces the survival of organisms later in life, this is likely to yield a Type I curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Demetrius|first=Lloyd|date=1978-09-21|title=Adaptive value, entropy and survivorship curves|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v275/n5677/abs/275213a0.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=275|issue=5677|pages=213–214|doi=10.1038/275213a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Future of an Illusion''''' ({{lang-de|Die Zukunft einer Illusion}}) is a 1927 work by [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], in which Freud discusses religion's origins, development, and its future. He provides a psychoanalysis of [[religion]], which he views as a false [[belief system]].

==Summary==
Freud defines religion as an illusion, consisting of "certain dogmas, assertions about facts and conditions of external and internal reality which tells one something that one has not oneself discovered, and which claim that one should give them credence." Religious concepts are transmitted in three ways and thereby claim our belief. "Firstly because our primal ancestors already believed them; secondly, because we possess proofs  which have been handed down to us from antiquity, and thirdly because it is forbidden to raise the question of their authenticity at all."  Psychologically speaking, these beliefs present the phenomena of wish fulfillment, "fulfillments of the oldest, strongest, and most urgent wishes of mankind." (Ch. 6 pg.38).

Among these are the necessity to cling to the existence of the father, the prolongation of earthly existence by a future life, and the immortality of the human soul. To differentiate between an illusion and an error, Freud lists scientific beliefs such as "''[[Aristotle]]'s belief that vermin are developed out of dung''" (pg.39) as errors, but "''the assertion made by certain nationalists that the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Germanic]] race is the only one capable of civilization''" is an [[illusion]], simply because of the wishing involved. Put forth more explicitly, "''what is characteristic of illusions is that they are derived from human wishes''." (pg. 39)

Freud adds, however, that, "Illusions need not necessarily be false." (pg.39)  He gives the example of a middle-class girl having the illusion that a prince will marry her.  While this is unlikely, it is not impossible.  The fact that it is grounded in her wishes is what makes it an illusion.

Freud explains religion in a similar term to that of [[totemism]]. The individual is essentially an enemy of society&lt;ref&gt;Freud uses the German word ''Kultur''. It has been translated sometimes as "culture" and sometimes as "civilization", denoting as it does a concept intermediate between these and at times inclusive of both.&lt;/ref&gt; and has instinctual urges that must be restrained to help society function. "Among these instinctual wishes are those of incest, cannibalism, and lust for killing." (pg. 10)

Freud's view of [[human nature]] is that it is anti-social, rebellious, and has high sexual and [[death drive|destructive tendencies]]. The destructive nature of humans sets a pre-inclination for disaster when humans must interact with others in society. "''For masses are lazy and unintelligent; they have no love for instinctual renunciation, and they are not to be convinced by argument of its inevitability; and the individuals composing them support one another in giving free rein to their indiscipline''." (pg. 7)

So destructive is human nature, he claims, that "''it is only through the influence of individuals who can set an example and whom masses recognize as their leaders that they can be induced to perform the work and undergo the renunciations on which the existence of [[civilization]] depends''." (pg. 8) All this sets a terribly [[Bellum omnium contra omnes|hostile society]] that could implode if it were not for civilizing forces and developing government.

He elaborates further on the development of religion, as the emphasis on acquisition of wealth and the satisfaction of instinctual drives (sex, wealth, glory, happiness, immortality) moves from "the material to the mental." As compensation for good behaviors, religion promises a reward.

In Freud's view, religion is an outshoot of the [[Oedipus complex]], and represents man's helplessness in the world, having to face the ultimate fate of death, the struggle of civilization, and the forces of nature. He views God as a manifestation of a childlike "longing for [a] father." (pg. 18)

Freud's description of religious belief as a form of illusion is based on the idea that it is derived from human wishes with no basis in reality. He says, "Thus we call a belief an illusion when a wish-fulfillment is a prominent factor in its motivation, and in doing so we disregard its relations to reality, just as the illusion itself sets no store by verification."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Future of an Illusion|last = Sigmund|first = Freud|publisher = W.W. Norton and Company|year = 1990|isbn = 0-393-00831-2|location = 500 Fitth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10110|pages = 40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Freud's words "The gods retain the threefold task: they must exorcise the terrors of nature, they must reconcile men to the cruelty of Fate, particularly as it is shown in death, and they must compensate them for the sufferings and privations which a civilized life in common has imposed on them." (pg. 19)

==Reception==
Freud sent a copy of ''The Future of an Illusion'' to his friend [[Romain Rolland]]. While Rolland generally agreed with Freud's assessment of religion, he questioned whether Freud had discovered the true source of religious sentiment, which he ascribed to an [[Oceanic feeling|"oceanic" feeling]].&lt;ref&gt;Gay, Peter. ''Freud: A Life for Our Time''. Papermac, 1995, p. 544.&lt;/ref&gt; The psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]], the founder of [[analytical psychology]], wrote in ''[[Symbols of Transformation]]'' that ''The Future of an Illusion'' "gives the best possible account" of Freud's earlier views, "which move within the confines of the outmoded rationalism and scientific materialism of the late nineteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;Jung, Carl. ''Symbols of Transformation: An Analysis of the Prelude to a Case of Schizophrenia''. Princeton University Press, 1990, p. xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Harold Bloom]], writing in ''[[The American Religion]]'' (1992), calls ''The Future of an Illusion'' "one of the great failures of religious criticism." Bloom believes that Freud underestimated religion and was therefore unable to criticize it effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Harold. ''The American Religion: The Emergence of the Post-Christian Nation''. Simon &amp; Schuster, 1992, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, some scholars see Freud's arguments as a manifestation of the [[genetic fallacy]], in which a belief is considered false or inverifiable based on its origin.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the American Academy of Religion 1978 XLVI(3):351-368; {{doi|10.1093/jaarel/XLVI.3.351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These efforts ultimately resulted in the founding of the Free Will Baptist Theological Seminary and its successor institution, Eureka College, both in [[Ayden, North Carolina|Ayden]], North Carolina, to educate ministers and provide a liberal arts education to the local constituency. After a catastrophic fire destroyed the administration building in 1931, Eureka College ceased operations, and the Free Will Baptist church’s efforts to fulfill its educational vision were reinvested in the founding of what is today the University of Mount Olive.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Pelt |first=Michael|title=A History of Ayden Seminary and Eureka College |pages=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Pelt |first=Michael|title=A History of Ayden Seminary and Eureka College |pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A member of the NCAA Division II [[Conference Carolinas]], its sports teams compete as the [[Mount Olive Trojans]].

== History ==

===Founding===
[[File:Mount olive college mtallenjc cragmont.jpg|thumb|right|Cragmont Assembly, [[Black Mountain, North Carolina|Black Mountain]], [[North Carolina]], location of the college's campus from 1952-53.]]From its inception as a junior college, the University of Mount Olive has been sponsored by the [[Original Free Will Baptist Convention]]. The institution was chartered in 1951 and opened in 1952 at Cragmont Assembly, the Free Will Baptist summer retreat grounds near [[Black Mountain, North Carolina]], under the direction of the Reverend Lloyd Vernon. The school was originally called Mount Allen Junior College, taking its name from the mountain near Cragmont.

===1953–1970===
In September 1953, the College moved to [[Mount Olive, North Carolina|Mount Olive]], North Carolina, nearer the center of denominational strength in the eastern region of the state. Under the leadership of the Reverend David W. Hansley, Chairman of the Board of Directors, plans were made to develop a junior college offering programs in arts and sciences and in business. The Reverend W. Burkette Raper was elected president in the summer of 1954, and in September the college began its first collegiate year with an enrollment of twenty-two students.
[[File:Mount olive college mtolivefirstbldg.jpg|thumb|left|First campus building in [[Mount Olive, North Carolina]].]]
In 1956, the name "Mount Allen Junior College" was changed to "Mount Olive Junior College". In that same year, plans were launched for an enlarged campus which today consists of 250 acres. In September 1970, the college's name was officially changed to Mount Olive College.

===1971–1990===
In 1977, the [[Original Free Will Baptist Convention]] requested that the Board of Trustees of Mount Olive College work aggressively toward making the college a four-year institution. The 1979 session of the convention endorsed the projected timetable set by the college's Board of Trustees to add the junior year in 1984 and the senior year in 1985.

In 1975, the college began an educational program in [[Goldsboro, North Carolina]] at [[Seymour Johnson Air Force Base]].

In 1986, the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges]] officially accredited Mount Olive College as a four-year institution to award associate and baccalaureate degrees.
[[File:Mount Olive college aerial view 1980s 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view comparisons of the main campus (Top to Bottom: circa 1980, 2012)]]

===1991–2008===
In the fall of 1994, the transfer of all operations to the main campus was complete and the original downtown campus was sold. In addition to the satellite campuses at New Bern and Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, the University expanded operations to reach non-traditional students at four other locations in North Carolina (Wilmington, Research Triangle Park, Washington, and Smithfield).

In January 1995, the Board of Trustees selected J. William Byrd as the third president.  Dr. Byrd assumed the duties of office on January 31 and was inaugurated on September 30.

===2008-Present===

An additional branch campus expansion was opened in Jacksonville, North Carolina in 2009, and academic delivery of some of the University's programs became available online in 2012. 

Mount Olive College officially changed its name to the University of Mount Olive as of January 1, 2014.

==Campus==

The University's main campus is located in Mount Olive, North Carolina, nestled within 250 acres of partially wooded and predominantly open surroundings at the edge of the rural town of [[Mount Olive, Wayne County, North Carolina|Mount Olive, NC]]. The campus is separated by a large common with the University's chapel at its center. It is accessible to the cities of [[Goldsboro, North Carolina]] and [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]. The past decade has yielded a period of significant growth and expansion for the main campus. With greater investment in housing and residence halls, academic and recreational buildings, as well as administrative offices. 

Additional campuses are located throughout eastern North Carolina at New Bern, Wilmington, Goldsboro ([[Seymour Johnson Air Force Base]]), Research Triangle Park, Washington, Jacksonville, Smithfield ([[Johnston Community College]]), Fayetteville (Partnership for Children). Additional courses and programs are accessible online.

The '''Wardak Vase''' is the name of an ancient globular-shaped buddhist [[copper]] vase that was found as part of a [[stupa]] [[relic]] deposit in the  early nineteenth century near [[Chaki Wardak]] in [[Maidan Wardak Province|Wardak Province]], [[Afghanistan]]. The importance of the vase lies in the long [[Kharoshthi]] inscription, which claims that the stupa contained the relics of the [[Buddha]]. Since 1880, the vase has been part of the [[British Museum]]'s [[The British Museum Department of Asia|Asian collection]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=105550&amp;plaA=105550-3-1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/b/bronze_reliquary_and_kushan_co.aspx British Museum Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Discovery==
The vase, coins and other relics were found by the [[United Kingdom|British]] adventurer and spy [[Charles Masson]] in 1836. Mason unearthed the vase in one of the stupas near the town of Wardak.  The finds were sent to London in 1839, where they became part of the Indian Museum's collection. In 1880, they were transferred to the [[British Museum]].

==Description==
The Wardak Vase is [[spherical]] in shape and made of copper alloy. The vase has a slim neck with an inverted rim and a low flat base. It has a series of three parallel [[Grooves (archaeology)|grooves]] running around the middle of the vase (with a further two pairs of grooves above and below). Engraved between the upper and middle grooves are four lines of Kharoshthi script that dates the vase and deposit to the year 178 AD. With the vase were found a number of beads and sixty-six coins of the [[Kushan]] Kings [[Vima Kadphises]], [[Kanishka I]] and [[Huvishka]].

==Inscription==
The long inscription refers to the Kushan year 51 in the reign of Kanishka I who reigned between AD 110 and 120, but also refers to one of his successors Huvishka, who ruled between AD 146 and 83; it thus provides useful evidence for reconstructing the chronological reigns of Kushan [[Royal family|royalty]] at the time. The inscription also indicates that the [[monastery]] was built by the [[Mahasanghikas]], one of the earliest buddhist schools in India, who were based at [[Mathura]], near Delhi. The vase therefore provides strong evidence for the widespread distribution of Buddhism in [[South Asia]] almost 2000 years ago.
