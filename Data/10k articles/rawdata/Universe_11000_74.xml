[[Image:Storm over Melbourne 3 Dec 2003.jpg|thumb|200px|Image from [[NASA]]'s [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellite of heavy stormclouds over Melbourne on 3 December 2003]]
The '''2003 Melbourne thunderstorm''' was a [[severe weather]] event that occurred over the city of [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]], Australia, and surrounding areas of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], from 1 to 6 December 2003. The [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Australian Bureau of Meteorology]] called the storm a "once in 100-year event".

According to the Bureau of Meteorology, the storm formed at around midnight on the night of 2 December over [[Craigieburn, Victoria|Craigieburn]], then grew in size as it moved in a south-easterly direction (the Bureau issued a severe thunderstorm warning based on their observations at 11.38&amp;nbsp;pm).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/04/1070351722381.html Downpour took forecasters by surprise], ''[[The Age]]'', 5 December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The two hours from midnight to 2&amp;nbsp;am saw extremely heavy rainfall, with some areas recording more than 100&amp;nbsp;mm of rain in that time. The rapid rainfall caused [[flash flood]]ing, which resulted in extensive damage to property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/vic/sevwx/flashfact.shtml Severe thunderstorms and flash floods in Victoria] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115141953/http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/vic/sevwx/flashfact.shtml |date=15 January 2010 }}, [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of motorists were trapped on the roofs of their cars as chest-high floodwater accumulated under the Bulleen Road Bridge on the [[Eastern Freeway, Melbourne|Eastern Freeway]]. They were rescued by Melbourne's [[Metropolitan Fire Brigade (Melbourne)|Metropolitan Fire Brigade]] using two maritime response unit boats. Severe [[hail]]storms caused thousands of dollars of damage to cars in the suburb of [[Lilydale, Victoria|Lilydale]]. Rail company [[Connex Melbourne]] announced that flooding and power damage at [[Blackburn railway station, Melbourne|Blackburn]], [[Surrey Hills railway station|Surrey Hills]] and [[Boronia railway station|Boronia]] railway stations would cause transport delays the following day. [[Victoria Police]] arrested two people in connection with incidents of [[looting]] in [[Fairfield, Victoria|Fairfield]] which had occurred during the height of the storms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/03/1070351609658.html Freak storm hits, more to come], ''[[The Age]]'', 3 December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bureau of Meteorology referred to the 2003 Melbourne Storms as a "once in 100-year event" but two similar storms, the [[2005 Melbourne Thunderstorm]] and the [[2010 Victorian storms]], have hit Melbourne both which were also called{{by whom|date=January 2011}} a once in 100-year event.

The '''Boterwaag''' is a former [[weigh house]] for butter in [[The Hague]], Netherlands. The right half is a café.

==History==
The left-half of the building was designed by the architect-painter [[Bartholomeus van Bassen]].&lt;ref name=Rijks&gt;Rijksmonument report&lt;/ref&gt; He designed and built it in 1650, after the Prinsegracht canal was dug in 1640.&lt;ref name=Rijks/&gt; He oversaw both projects in his role as city architect and headman of the [[Guild of St. Luke]]. After he died in 1652, the local painters became dissatisfied with the guild and founded the [[Confrerie Pictura]] in 1656, which met upstairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/houb005groo01_01/houb005groo01_01_0124.php Confrerie Pictura] in [[Arnold Houbraken]]'s 3 volume work on artist biographies called ''[[The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters]]''&lt;/ref&gt; They shared their meeting room upstairs with the guild of apothecaries, and the city apothecary shop was across the street.&lt;ref name=Rijks/&gt; In 1681 the right half was built as an extension, and new scales were installed inside that can still be seen by visitors to the café there.

In 2013 a replica of the 17th-century brass bell was replaced on the facade that had been stolen in 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omroepwest.nl/nieuws/01-08-2013/boterklokje-na-dertig-jaar-terug-bij-boterwaag Boterwaag bell back after 30 years] on Omroep West website&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4329">The '''Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering (ACNS),''' formerly the '''Bragg Institute,''' is a landmark [[neutron]] and [[X-ray]] [[scattering]] facility in [[Australia]]. It is located at the [[Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation]]'s ([[ANSTO]]) [[Lucas Heights, New South Wales|Lucas Heights]] site, 40&amp;nbsp;km south west of [[Sydney]], in [[New South Wales]], Australia.

The Institute was formed in December 2002 in preparation for the start-up of the [[Open-pool Australian lightwater reactor]] in 2006, and named as a tribute to the father-and-son team [[Sir William Henry Bragg]] and son [[William Lawrence Bragg]], who were jointly awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] for Physics in 1915 for pioneering the analysis of [[crystal structure]]s by means of X-rays. Following a restructure of scientific operations in 2016, the Institute was split to form two distinct research platforms, ACNS and the National Deuteration Facility.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ansto.gov.au/ResearchHub/Bragg/Facilities/NationalDeuterationFacility/&lt;/ref&gt;

ACNS operates the cold- and thermal-neutron scattering facility associated with the [[Open-pool Australian lightwater reactor|OPAL research reactor]], including 14 operational neutron beam instruments, and one instrument in transfer from the BER-II Research Reactor at the [[Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin]].  It houses a helium-3 polarisation system to enable polarised-neutron experiments, two small-angle X-ray scattering instruments, an X-ray reflectometer and Physical Properties Measurement System.

Neutron scattering covers an extremely wide range of disciplines from fundamental physics, through chemistry, materials, and biology, right through to interdisciplinary areas such as engineering and archaeology. Science at the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering covers many of these areas, usually in collaboration with other groups, with a focus on the application of neutron scattering to crystallography, soft condensed matter, solid-state physics, physical chemistry and increasingly biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ansto.gov.au/ResearchHub/OurInfrastructure/ACNS/CurrentResearch/index.htm|title=Current research - ANSTO|last=3111|first=corporateName=Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation; address=New Illawarra Road, Lucas Heights NSW 2234 Australia; contact=+61 2 9717|website=www.ansto.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACNS identifies 6 key scientific projects: The Food Science Project, Thermo-Mechanical Processes, Energy Materials, Magnetism, Cultural Heritage and Planetary Materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ansto.gov.au/ResearchHub/OurInfrastructure/ACNS/CurrentResearch/ScientificProjects/index.htm|title=Scientific projects - ANSTO|last=3111|first=corporateName=Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation; address=New Illawarra Road, Lucas Heights NSW 2234 Australia; contact=+61 2 9717|website=www.ansto.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bund Deutscher Holzwirte''' (BDH) (English: Association of German Wood Scientists) is a [[professional association|professional]] and [[alumni association]] for graduates of the German degree course for Holzwirtschaft (English: Wood Science), founded in 1950.

==History==
The BDH was founded on 22 July 1950 in Hamburg (Germany) by graduates of the degree program for Holzwirtschaft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stiftung Holzwirtschaft|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://www.holzwirte.com/stiftung-holzwirtschaft.html|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-03-23|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This course of study was established in 1939 by the Reichsinstitut für ausländische und koloniale Forstwirtschaft (English: Reich Institute for Foreign and Colonial Forestry).  As of 1946 the [[University of Hamburg]] continues the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Franz Heske und die Gründung des „Reichsintitutes für ausländische und koloniale Forstwirtschaft in Schloss Reinbek, 1931 bis 1940/42“|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://www.holzwirte.com/files/Downloads/Sonstiges/Vortrag%20Bavendamm%20Langfassung_75%20Jahre%20Studium.pdf|deadurl=|format=PDF; 280 kB|accessdate=2018-03-23|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Dirk Bavendamm|date=2014|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The purpose of the BDH is 'to promote [[wood economy]] by exchanging professional experiences as well as maintaining personal contacts of the members, to support the professional development of the members and to inform about the degree program for Holzwirtschaft' (translated paragraph of the statutes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Satzung des Bundes Deutscher Holzwirte|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://www.holzwirte.com/satzung.html|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-03-23|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Composite armour''' is a type of [[vehicle armour]] consisting of layers of different material such as [[metal]]s, [[plastics]], [[ceramic]]s or [[air]]. Most composite armours are lighter than their all-metal equivalent, but instead occupy a larger volume for the same resistance to penetration. It is possible to design composite armour stronger, lighter and less voluminous than traditional armour, but the cost is often prohibitively high, restricting its use to especially vulnerable parts of a vehicle. Its primary purpose is to help defeat [[high explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT) rounds.

HEAT had posed a serious threat to armoured vehicles since its introduction in [[World War II]]. Lightweight and small, HEAT rounds could nevertheless penetrate hundreds of millimetres of the hardest [[rolled homogeneous armour|steel armours]]. The capability of most materials for defeating HEAT follows the "density law", which states that the penetration of [[shaped charge]] jets is proportional to the square root of the shaped charge liner [[density]] (typically [[copper]]) divided by the square root of the target density. On a weight basis, lighter targets are more advantageous than heavier targets, but using large quantities of lightweight materials has obvious disadvantages in terms of mechanical layout. Certain materials have an optimal compromise in terms of density that makes them particularly useful in this role.&lt;ref name=xm60&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=AD524050&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf Evaluation of Siliceous Cored Armor for the XM60 Tank] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605071506/http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=AD524050&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf |date=June 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest known composite armour for armoured vehicles was developed as part of the [[US Army]]'s [[T95]] experimental series from the mid-1950s. The T95 featured "'''siliceous-cored armor'''" which contained a plate of [[fused silica]] [[glass]] between rolled [[steel]] plates. The stopping power of glass exceeds that of steel armour on a thickness basis and in many cases glass is more than twice as effective as steel on a thickness basis. Although the T95 never entered production, a number of its concepts were used on the [[M60 Patton]], and during the development stage (as the XM60) the siliceous-cored armour was at least considered for use, although it was not a feature of the production vehicles.&lt;ref name=xm60/&gt;

{{Expert-subject|Military history/Military science and technology task force|date=September 2009}}

The first widespread use of a composite armour appears to have been on the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[T-64]]. It used an armour known as [[Combination K]], which apparently is [[glass-reinforced plastic]] sandwiched between inner and outer steel layers. Through a mechanism called [[thixotropy]], the [[resin]] changes to a fluid under constant pressure, allowing the armour to be [[moulded]] into curved shapes. Later models of the T-64, along with newer designs, used a [[boron carbide]]-filled resin [[aggregate (composite)|aggregate]] for greatly improved protection. The Soviets also invested heavily in [[reactive armour]], which allowed them some ability to control quality, even after production.

The most common type of [[composite material|composite]] armour today is [[Chobham armour]],{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} first developed and used by the British in the experimental [[FV 4211 tank]], which was based on [[Chieftain tank]] components. Chobham sandwiches a layer of [[ceramic]] between two plates of steel armour, which was shown to dramatically increase the resistance to HEAT rounds, even in comparison to other composite armour designs. Chobham was such an improvement that it was soon used on the new U.S. [[M1 Abrams]] [[main battle tank]] (MBT) as well. It is the fabrication of the ceramic in large tiles that gives the [[Challenger 2|Challenger]] and Abrams their "slab sided" look.

==Design==
Chobham's precise mechanism for defeating HEAT was uncovered in the 1980s. High speed photography showed that the ceramic material [[Fracture|shatters]] as the HEAT round penetrates, the highly energetic fragments destroying the geometry of the metal jet generated by the hollow [[shaped charge]], greatly diminishing the penetration. The effectiveness of the system was amply demonstrated in [[Desert Storm]], where not a single [[British Army]] Challenger tank was lost to enemy tank fire. (However, one was [[Challenger 2 tank#Operational usage|destroyed by friendly fire]] on March 25, 2003, killing two crew members after a [[High explosive squash head|HESH]] round detonated on the commander's hatch causing high-velocity fragments to enter the [[gun turret|turret]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/C2384518-7EBA-4CFF-B127-E87871E41B51/0/boi_challenger2_25mar03.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121026065214/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/C2384518-7EBA-4CFF-B127-E87871E41B51/0/boi_challenger2_25mar03.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-10-26 |title=UK Ministry of Defence : Army Board of Inquiry Report |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Chobham-type armour is currently in its third generation and is used on modern western tanks such as the [[Challenger 2 tank|British Challenger 2]] and the American [[M1 Abrams]]. The Abrams is also unique in its usage of [[Depleted uranium|depleted uranium armour]] plates in conjunction with composite armour, increasing overall vehicle protection. 

==Usage==
All modern third-generation main battle tanks use composite armour arrays in their construction. While many of these vehicles feature the composite armour permanently integrated with the vehicle, the Japanese [[Type 10]] and [[Type 90 Kyū-maru]] MBTs, French [[Leclerc]], Iranian [[Karrar (tank)|Karrar]],Turkish [[Altay (tank)|Altay]], Indian [[Arjun (tank)|Arjun]], Italian [[Ariete]]  and Chinese [[Type 96 tank|Type 96]]/98 and [[Type 99 tank|Type 99]] tanks use a modular composite armour, where sections of the composite armour can be easily and quickly switched out or upgraded with armour modules. The adoption of modular composite armour design facilitates far more efficient and easier upgrades and exchanges of the armour. 

Soviet/Russian main battle tanks such as [[T-90]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s [[T-80]]Us and the Chinese Type 96/99s use composite armour in tandem with [[reactive armour#Explosive reactive armour|explosive reactive armour]] (ERA), making it hard for shaped charge munitions such as HEAT rounds and missile warheads to penetrate the frontal and a portion of their side armour. The most advanced versions of these armours such as the [[RELIKT-1]] and [[Kontakt-5]] armour provide protection not only against shaped charges but also [[Kinetic energy penetrator|kinetic energy penetrators]] by using the explosive force to shear the projectile apart.

Applique armour has also been used in conjunction with composite armour to provide increased amounts of protection and to supplant existing composite arrays on a vehicle. The German [[Leopard 2|Leopard 2A5]] featured distinctive arrowhead laminated armour modules that was mounted directly onto the turret composite arrays, increasing protection markedly above the previous 2A4 model. 

Composite armour has since been applied to smaller vehicles, right down to [[jeep]]-sized automobiles. Many of these systems are applied as upgrades to existing armour, which makes them difficult to place around the entire vehicle. Nevertheless, they are often surprisingly effective; upgrades with [[MEXAS]] ceramic armour to Canadian [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113s]] were carried out in the 1990s, after it was realized that it would offer more protection than newly built [[Infantry Fighting Vehicles |IFVs]] like the [[M2 Bradley]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Improvised==
In 2004, [[Marvin Heemeyer]] used an ''ad hoc'' composite armour on his [[Komatsu Limited|Komatsu D355A]] [[bulldozer]] ("Killdozer") used in a rampage in response to a dispute with the city he lived in over a zoning issue. The armour, at some places a foot thick, consisted of a layer of [[concrete]] sandwiched between layers of [[steel]], successfully rendering the vehicle impervious to [[small arms]] fire and small explosives used by law enforcement in an attempt to stop the vehicle.

A '''cyclone furnace''' is a type of [[coal]] [[combustor]] commonly used in large industrial [[boilers]].

==Background==
Developed in the early 1942 by [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] to take advantage of coal grades not suitable for [[pulverized coal-fired boiler|pulverized coal combustion]], cyclone furnaces feed coal in a spiral manner into a combustion chamber for maximum combustion efficiency.
[[Image:Cyclone combustor.jpg|thumb|300px|A typical cyclone combustor]]
During coal combustion in a furnace, [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] components burn without much difficulty. Fuel carbon “char” particles (heavier, less volatile coal constituents) require much higher temperatures and a continuing supply of oxygen. Cyclone furnaces are able to provide a thorough mixing of coal particles and air with sufficient [[turbulence]] to provide fresh air to surfaces of the coal particles.

Cyclone furnaces were originally designed to take advantage of four things
#Lower fuel preparation time and costs
#Smaller more compact furnaces
#Less [[fly ash]] and convective pass slagging
#Flexibility in fuel types

==Operation==
A cyclone furnace consists of a horizontal cylindrical barrel attached through the side of a boiler furnace. The cyclone barrel is constructed with water cooled, tangential oriented, tube construction. Inside the cyclone barrel are short, densely spaced, pin studs [[welding|welded]] to the outside of the tubes. The studs are coated with a [[refractory|refractory material]], usually [[silica]] or [[aluminium]] based, that allows the cyclone to operate at a high enough temperature to keep the [[slag]] in a molten state and allow removal through the tap.

Crushed coal and a small amount of primary air enter from the front of the cyclone into the burner. In the main cyclone burner, secondary air is introduced tangentially, causing a circulating gas flow pattern. The products, flue gas and un-combusted fuel, then leave the burner and pass over the boiler tubes. Tertiary air is then released further downstream to complete combustion of the remaining fuel, greatly reducing [[NOx]] formation. A layer of molten slag coats the burner and flows through traps at the bottom of the burners, reducing the amount of slag that would otherwise form on the boiler tubes.

Cyclone Furnaces can handle a wide range of fuels. Low volatile [[bituminous coal]]s, [[Lignite|lignite coal]], mineral rich [[Anthracite|anthracitic coal]], [[biofuel|wood chips]], [[petroleum coke]], and old [[tires]] can and have all been used in cyclones.

The crushed coal is fed into the cyclone burner and fired with high rates of heat release. Before the hot gases enter in the boiler furnace the combustion of coal is completed. The crushed coal is fed into cyclone burners .The coal is Burned by centrifugal action which is imparted by the primary air which enters tangentially and secondary Air which also enters in the top tangentially at high speed and tertiary air is admitted in the centre.
Due to Whirling action of coal and air, a large amount of heat is generated (1500-1600°c)and that covered the surface of cyclone and ashes are transformed into molten slag .The molten slag drained from the boiler furnace through a slag tap.

[[Image:Dadosets.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Top left: disassembled stacked dado set showing blades and chippers; bottom left: stacked dado set in table saw; right: wobble dado]]

A '''dado set''' or '''dado blade''' is a type of [[circular saw]] blade, usually used with a [[table saw]] or [[radial arm saw]], which is used to cut [[Dado (joinery)|dado]]es or [[Groove (joinery)|grooves]] in [[woodworking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canadianwoodworking.com/tools/dado-sets|title=Dado Sets - Canadian Woodworking Magazine|website=www.canadianwoodworking.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two common kinds of dado sets, stacked dado set and wobble blade.

Stacked dado set consists of two circular saw blades fixed on either side of a set of removable chippers. As the dado set spins, the two outside blades cut the dado walls and the chippers remove the waste material in between and smooth the bottom of the dado. The chippers are added or removed to the set as required to make a dado of the desired width. Chippers can also be interspersed with spacers to finely adjust the dado width. Consequently, changing the dado width requires the complete removal of the dado blade set from the [[mandrel|arbor]]. After disassembly, chippers and/or spacers are used to achieve the desired width of the dado set.

Wobble blade or wobble dado or adjustable dado consists of a circular blade mounted on an adjustable multi-piece hub, that varies the angle of the blade to the arbor shaft. The width of the dado cut increases as the angle gets farther from the radial normal (90°) to the arbor. While it is possible to adjust the thickness of the cut while the saw is mounted on the arbor, accurate adjustment is usually difficult because tightening the arbor nut often changes the adjustment. Also, because of their inherent geometry wobble blades can only produce a flat-bottomed dado at one width setting, which may be a disadvantage in certain joinery operations. Another disadvantage of a wobble dado over stacked dado is undesirable vibrations. The magnitude of these vibrations varies with the blade's angular offset. In other words, the wider the dado, the stronger the vibrations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1140">'''Ednatol''' is a yellow [[high explosive]], comprising about 58% [[ethylenedinitramine]] (aka Haleite or Explosive H) and 42% [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]]. It was developed in the United States circa 1935 and used as a substitute for Composition B in large general purpose and fragmentation bombs. It has a [[detonation velocity]] of approximately 7,400 metres per second.

Ednatol was also used as [[Pentolite]] is used: in rockets, grenades and high-explosive antitank shells. &lt;ref&gt;[http://wwiibythebook.com/index2.htm?/USA/Ammunition/Explosives/Ednatol.htm&amp;2] {{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ednatol was cast in the same manner as [[amatol]]. The resulting explosive was stable, non-[[hygroscopic]] and could be stored for long periods.

Ednatol has no civilian applications. It was developed by the U.S. Army at [[Picatinny Arsenal]] exclusively intended for military use and was especially popular during the [[Second World War]]. It is now an obsolete explosive and therefore unlikely to be encountered, except in legacy munitions and [[unexploded ordnance]].

==Coal==
{{main|Coal in South Africa}}
Around 77% of South Africa's energy needs are directly derived from coal&lt;ref name="dme-coal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.gov.za/files/coal_frame.html|title=Coal|publisher=[[Department of Energy (South Africa)]]|accessdate=8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 92% of coal consumed on the African continent is mined in South Africa.&lt;ref name="eia-ieo2009-4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/ieo/coal.html|title=International Energy Outlook 2009, Chapter 4 – Coal |date=27 May 2009|publisher=[[Energy Information Administration]]|accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africa was the sixth top hard coal producer in 2009: 247 Mt hard coal, below [[Energy in Australia|Australia]] 335 Mt and [[Energy in Indonesia|Indonesia]] 263 Mt and above [[Energy in Russia|Russia]] 229 Mt. South Africa was the fifth top hard coal net exporter in 2009: 67 Mt hard coal of the world total hard coal export 836 Mt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2010] Page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 247 Mt hard coal production is 247 Mt*0.564 toe/Mt*11.630 TWh/toe = 1620 TWh and export 67 Mt*0.564 toe/Mt*11.630 TWh/toe = 439 TWh.

===Coal and environment===
{{see also|Environmental impact of the coal industry}}
Coal production and use creates in South Africa Coal combustion wastes (CCW), coal mine wastes (AMD) and toxic coal land fires. Coal combustion wastes (CCW), contain toxic substances like arsenic, cadmium, chromium and lead. Hundreds of South African old coal mines are filled with sulphate salts, heavy metals and carcinogenic substances like benzene and toluene. This AMD damages wildlife and spreads illness and disease. According to Greenpeace most shockingly is [[Witbank|eMalahleni]] 'place of coal', [[Mpumalanga]] province, surrounded by 22 collieries and steel, vanadium and manganese plants. One of the biggest old mines is the Transvaal and Delagoa Bay (T&amp;DB) mine, closed in 1953. 60&amp;nbsp;km downstream from Emalahleni AMD leaked into the water supply in 2006 and 2007 killing thousands of fish, crocodiles and freshwater turtles and poisoning the water used by communities. Coal fires continue in the disused mines.&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt;

===Coal business===
Coal mine owners include [[Anglo Coal]] (ex Amcoal) a subsidiary of [[Anglo American plc]], Glencore, Exxaro and [[South 32]].&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt;

==Electricity==
{{see also|List of power stations in South Africa}}
In 2008 electricity was produced 241 TWh with coal. In 2008 electricity production + imports – exports – losses was 232 TWh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2010] Pages 25,56&lt;/ref&gt;

The government owned national power utility [[Eskom]] dominates the country's electricity sector.  With 27 operational power plants generating over 95% of the country's electricity and over 40% of all electricity on the African continent making it one of the ten largest power utilities in the world.  However government's inability to keep Eskom's generating capacity up with economic and population growth due to a lack of investment by government has created a large energy shortage and led to an energy crisis in late 2007. This has forced the company to implement [[loadshedding]] in specific areas of the country at certain times to reduce pressure on the national grid and initiate an ambitious program to increase energy production.&lt;ref name="moneyweb"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.moneyweb.co.za/archive/the-electricity-crisis-from-bad-to-terrible/ | title=The electricity crisis – from bad to terrible | publisher=Moneyweb | date=9 August 2012 | accessdate=10 August 2015 | author=Jasson Urbach}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DMeskom"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-01-12-hey-eskom-remember-2008/#.VcicTHGqqko | title=Hey Eskom, remember 2008? | publisher=[[Daily Maverick]] | date=12 January 2012 | accessdate=10 August 2015 | author=Sipho Hlongwane}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has led to speculation by the national newspaper, the [[Mail and Guardian]], that the country might face a complete grid failure.&lt;ref name="MGcollapes"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-12-11-does-south-africa-face-an-electricity-grid-collapse | title=Does South Africa face an electricity grid collapse? | publisher=Mail &amp; Guardian | date=11 December 2014 | accessdate=10 August 2015 | author=KATE WILKINSON}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewable energy==
{{main|Renewable energy in South Africa}}
The portion of renewable energy as a percentage of final energy consumption in 2012 was 16.9%. Most of that was from the burning of traditional biofuels for heating.

In terms of share of GDP in 2012, South Africa was the fourth largest investor in renewable power in the world after Uruguay, Mauritius and Costa Rica. That rate of investment is expected to continue. Renewable energy will play a larger role in future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RENEWABLES 2014 GLOBAL STATUS REPORT|url=http://www.ren21.net/GSR-2014-Report-Full-report-EN|publisher=REN21|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africa's per capita [[greenhouse gas]] emissions are the highest in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/|title=Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC)|last=Laboratory|first=Oak Ridge National|website=cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africa's commitment to [[renewable energy]] lags behind that of China, [[India]], [[Brazil]], and Russia. South Africa receives more than twice as much [[Sunlight|sunshine]] than Germany, where over 15 percent of the national electricity supply comes from renewable sources.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tips.org.za/files/184.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/?cat=38|title=Statistics South Africa Category Archives: Energy|last=|first=|date=27 July 2017|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/co2highlights/ |title=CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion: 2011Highlights |publisher=[[International Energy Agency|IEA]] |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2010/10/26/worlds-largest-solar-park-to-be-in-south-africa/ |title=World's Largest Solar Park to be in South Africa? |publisher=CleanTechnica |date=26 October 2010 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government incentives===

"South Africa's National Energy Regulator (NERSA) announced 31 March 2009 the introduction of a system of feed-in tariffs designed to produce 10 TWh of electricity per year by 2013. The feed-in tariffs announced were substantially higher than those in NERSA's original proposal. The tariffs, differentiated by technology, will be paid for a period of 20 years.

NERSA said in its release that the tariffs were based, as in most European countries, on the cost of generation plus a reasonable profit. The tariffs for wind energy and concentrating solar power are among the most attractive worldwide.

The tariff for wind energy, 1.25 ZAR/kWh (€0.104/kWh) is greater than that offered in Germany and more than that proposed in Ontario, Canada.

The tariff for concentrating solar, 2.10 ZAR/kWh, is less than that in Spain, but offers great promise in the bright sunlight of South Africa. NERSA's revised program followed extensive public consultation.

Stefan Gsänger, Secretary General of the World Wind Energy Association said in a release that "South Africa is the first African country to introduce a feed-in tariff for wind energy. Many small and big investors will now be able to contribute to the take-off of the wind industry in the country. Such decentralised investment will enable South Africa to overcome its current energy crisis. It will also help many South African communities to invest in wind farms and generate electricity, new jobs and new income. We are especially pleased as this decision comes shortly after the first North American feed-in law has been proposed by the Government of the Canadian Province of Ontario".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/04/south-africa-introduces-aggressive-feed-in-tariffs] "South Africa Introduces Aggressive Feed-in Tariffs" , Paul Gipe, Contributing Writer, 10 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the feed-in tariff was abandoned before being promulgated in favor of a competitive bidding process launched on 3 August 2011. Under this bidding process, the South African government plans to procure 3,750MW of renewable energy: 1,850MW of onshore wind, 1,450MW of solar PV, 200MW of CSP, 75MW of small hydro, 25MW of [[landfill gas]], 12.5MW of biogas, 12.5MW of biomass, and 100MW of small projects. The bidding process comprises two steps:
* Qualification phase. Projects are assessed based on structure of the project, legal, land acquisition and use, financial, environmental consent, technical, economic development and bid guarantee
* Evaluation phase. Compliant bids are then evaluated based on: (1) price relative to a ceiling provided in bid documentation, accounting for 70% of the decision, and (2) economic development, accounting for 30% of the decision.

The first round of bids was due on 4 November 2011. The SA government is expected to announce preferred bidders before COP17 in December. PPA's are expected to be in place by June 2012. Projects should be commissioned by June 2014, except CSP projects which are expected by June 2015.

The average indexed bid prices (2012)  for the supply of energy in the first bid window for the various renewable energy technologies were:

* Concentrating solar power (CSP): R2,69 per kWh
* Solar photo-voltaic (PV): R2,76 per kWh
* Wind: R1,14 per kWh

The average indexed bid prices (2012) for the supply of energy in the second bid window

* Concentrating solar power (CSP): R2,51 per kWh
* Solar photo-voltaic (PV): R1,65 per kWh
* Wind: R0,90 per kWh
* Small hydro: R1,03 per kWh

The average indexed bid prices (2013) for the supply of energy in the third bid window

* Concentrating solar power (CSP): R1,64 per kWh
* Solar photo-voltaic (PV): R0,99 per kWh
* Wind: R0,74 per kWh
* Landfill gas: R0,94 per kWh
* Biomass: R1,39 per kWh

Eskom claims a standard electricity production price (2012)of R0.31 per kWh  ([[Eskom]]-predominately Coal and Nuclear),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renewable Energy IPP Procurement Programme: Window two Preferred Bidders’ announcement|url=http://www.energy.gov.za/files/media/presentations/2012/Renewables_IPP_ProcurementProgram_WindowTwoAnnouncement_21May2012.pptx|publisher=Department of Minerals and Energy|accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; however energy generated from Eskom's new coal power plants have been estimated to be R0.97 per kWh.

== Controversies ==
Secret price contracts between Eskom and the Australian mining company [[BHP Billiton]] less than half Eskom's reported production price in the period.&lt;ref name="20111123greenpeace"&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/climate/2011/391%20-%20WhosHoldingUsBack.pdf Who's holding us back? Full report]. Greenpeace, 23 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Many abandoned mines have been burning since the 1940s. Persistent and toxic mine chemical leakages pollute waterways and kill animals. In 2006, about 80% of South Africa's coal exports was in Europe.&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1988">A '''foaming agent''' is a material that facilitates formation of [[foam]] such as a [[surfactant]] or a [[blowing agent]]. A surfactant, when present in small amounts, reduces [[surface tension]] of a liquid (reduces the work needed to create the foam) or increases its [[colloid|colloidal]] stability by inhibiting [[Coalescence (chemistry)|coalescence]] of bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;1972, 31, 612IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology 2nd Edition (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; A blowing agent is a gas that forms the gaseous part of the foam.

==Surfactants==
{{Main|Surfactant}}
[[Sodium laureth sulfate]], or sodium lauryl ether sulfate ('''SLES'''), is a [[detergent]] and [[surfactant]] found in many personal care products ([[soap]]s, [[shampoo]]s, [[toothpaste]]s, etc.). It is an inexpensive and effective [[foam]]er. [[Sodium lauryl sulfate]] (also known as sodium dodecyl sulfate or '''SDS''') and [[ammonium lauryl sulfate]] ('''ALS''') are commonly used alternatives to SLES in consumer products.&lt;ref name="SLES_Product_Identification"&gt;Sodium Laureth Sulfate POE(2). Chemical Land 21, Seoul, Korea. [http://www.chemicalland21.com/specialtychem/perchem/SODIUM%20LAURETH%20SULFATE.htm Product Identification]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Blowing agents==
{{Main|Blowing agent}}
There are two main types of blowing agents: gases at the temperature that the foam is formed, and gases generated by chemical reaction. [[Carbon dioxide]], [[pentane]], and [[chlorofluorocarbons]] are examples of the former. Blowing agents that produce gas via chemical reactions include [[baking powder]], [[azodicarbonamide]], [[titanium hydride]], and [[isocyanates]] (when they react with water).

The '''France–Pakistan atomic energy framework''', or also known as '''France–Pakistan nuclear deal''', is a bilateral energy treaty signed by the governments of [[Cabinet of France|France]] and [[Government of Pakistan|Pakistan]] on 15 May 2009.&lt;ref name="BBC Pakistan, 2009"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff reports|title=Pakistan in 'French nuclear deal'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8052587.stm|accessdate=17 September 2012|newspaper=BBC Pakistan, 2009|date= 15 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Francois Murphy |title=Pakistan Asserts French Backing; Cites Support for Nuclear Deal,|newspaper=Boston Globe,|date=16 May 2009, Lexis-Nexis.|accessdate=17 September 2012|url=http://www.nti.org/media/pdfs/pakistan_nuclear.pdf?_=1316466791}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The framework of this agreement was a 15 May 2009, in a joint press statement of President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] and President [[Asif Ali Zardari]], under which France agreed to provide assistance to improve the [[nuclear safety]] of its [[Nuclear power in Pakistan|nuclear power]] installations and related civilian nuclear facilities under [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) safeguards and,as well as the transfer full civilian-based [[nuclear technology]] to Pakistan.&lt;ref name="BBC Pakistan, 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Agence France-Presse,"&gt;{{cite news|last=AFP|title=France offers Pakistan nuclear energy help|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iZ57_cSGpmiOKuVA6d5kN79aw9hg|accessdate=17 September 2012|newspaper=Agence France-Presse,|date=15 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to [[U.S.–India Civil Nuclear Agreement|Indo-American nuclear agreement]], this framework restricted itself to only to co-operate in the field of "[[nuclear safety]]", as quoted by the [[French Foreign Ministry]].&lt;ref name="NTI (The Hindu)"/&gt; While [[Foreign Office of Pakistan|foreign service officers]] and the Foreign minister [[Shah Mahmood Qureshi]] outlined what they termed as "significant development"; however, a French official stated that his nation has "no intention" of pursuing a civilian nuclear trade deal, roughly equivalent to [[Indo-US nuclear deal|Indo-US deal]], with Pakistan.&lt;ref name="NTI (The Hindu)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|title=Back to Global Security Newswire Home About Global Security Newswire Contact Us France Plans No Civilian Nuclear Deal With Pakistan, Official Says|url=http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/france-plans-no-civilian-nuclear-deal-with-pakistan-official-says/|accessdate=17 September 2012|newspaper=NTI (The Hindu)|date=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview and background==

Since 1967, France has emerged as the biggest defence contractor of Pakistan, despite its [[India-France relations|good and relatively close relations]] with India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=See [[India-France relations]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan is one of three original participant states (others being [[India]] and [[Israel]]) that refused to be signatory of the [[Nuclear Proliferation Treaty|NPT]].&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Nuclear Proliferation Treaty]]&lt;/ref&gt; On March 1976, France and Pakistan signed a mutual agreement for the supply of plutonium-based [[nuclear reprocessing]] plant at the [[Chasma Pakistan|Chasma]].&lt;ref name="Council on Foreign Relations"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tahrir-Khalil|first=Shirine R.|title=India, Pakistan and the United States|year=1997|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|location=New York|isbn=0-87609-199-0|pages=72–76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=srCLD-PXl-gC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=france+pakistan+nuclear+deal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z1Ku11okX_&amp;sig=upK3myyBe00_k2wCp5OvZ5Am7OM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZohXUMS0LojviQKvwYCwAw&amp;ved=0CC8QuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=france%20pakistan%20nuclear%20deal&amp;f=true|accessdate=17 September 2012|format=google book|chapter=Preventing Proliferation}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this deal came under attack from various countries, particularly the United States, for two reasons.&lt;ref name="Council on Foreign Relations"/&gt; First, Pakistan under Prime minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] was putting efforts to gain success in its [[Pakistan and Nuclear Weapons|atomic bomb project]].&lt;ref name="Council on Foreign Relations"/&gt; Second, the French deal was not completely under the inspection of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA).&lt;ref name="Council on Foreign Relations"/&gt; The United States pressed full scope and built momentum on France to re-consider its decision, while on other hand, Bhutto threatened the France that the future contracts would be contingent on its first fulfilling the "contractual obligation" to the legally obliged agreement.&lt;ref name="Council on Foreign Relations"/&gt; In 1976, [[Henry Kissinger]] arrived Pakistan with tough message which became publicly known in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Council on Foreign Relations"/&gt; In a short span of time, France under pressured by the various countries, cancelled the project with Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Council on Foreign Relations"/&gt;

==Clauses and scope==

Despite France's willingness to give a green signal for this agreement, the confusion remains over what was agreed.&lt;ref name="BBC Pakistan, 2009"/&gt; The officials of Pakistan's Foreign ministry had undertaken to supply Pakistan with "civilian nuclear technology", the French officials stressed on the fact that "France had agreed only to co-operate in the field of "nuclear safety".&lt;ref name="BBC Pakistan, 2009"/&gt; Although, in an official press French President Nicolas Sarkozy marked to his counterpart that "France wanted Pakistan to have a wide-ranging deal to buy nuclear equipment" like the one obtained by its rival India,&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;{{cite web|title=Sarkozy wants India-style nuclear deal for Pakistan|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2009/05/15/pakistan-france-nuclear-idINLF40083320090515|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later spokesman for the French presidency was careful to rein in expectations and much of the details were closed to the public.&lt;ref name="BBC Pakistan, 2009"/&gt;

'''Gary Taubes''' (born April 30, 1956) is an American science writer.  He is the author of ''Nobel Dreams'' (1987), ''[[Bad Science: The Short Life and Weird Times of Cold Fusion]]'' (1993), and ''[[Good Calories, Bad Calories]]'' (2007), titled ''The Diet Delusion'' (2008) in the UK and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://livinlavidalocarb.blogspot.com/2007/08/taubes-doctors-nutritionists-havent-got.html |title= Jimmy Moore: Interview with Gary Taubes |accessdate=June 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''[[Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It]]'' was released in December 2010. His main hypothesis is that [[carbohydrates]] stimulate the secretion of [[insulin]], which causes the body to store [[fat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/opinion/sunday/what-really-makes-us-fat.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Gary | last=Taubes | title=What Really Makes Us Fat | date=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, Taubes published ''[[The Case Against Sugar]]'', which further expanded his arguments against dietary carbohydrates and sugar in particular.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

==Biography==
Born in [[Rochester, New York]], Taubes studied applied physics at [[Harvard University]] (BS, 1977)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nusi.org/about-us/a-letter-from-the-founders/gary-taubes/#.Un6gQqWW8w0|title=Gary Taubes, Co-founder
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[aerospace engineering]] at [[Stanford University]] (MS, 1978). After receiving a master's degree in journalism at [[Columbia University]] in 1981, Taubes joined [[Discover (magazine)|''Discover'' magazine]] as a staff reporter in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Squires, Sally. (August 27, 2002). "The Skinny on Author Gary Taubes". ''Washington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then he has written numerous articles for ''Discover'', ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and other magazines. Originally focusing on physics issues, his interests have more recently turned to medicine and nutrition.
His brother, [[Clifford Taubes|Clifford Henry Taubes]], is the William Petschek Professor of Mathematics at Harvard University.&lt;ref name=NAS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200805/tx080500596p.pdf|title=Taubes Receives NAS Award in Mathematics|work=American Mathematical Society|accessdate=May 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific controversies==
Taubes' books have all dealt with scientific controversies.

''Nobel Dreams'' takes a critical look at the politics and experimental techniques behind the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize]]-winning work of physicist [[Carlo Rubbia]].

In ''[[Bad Science: The Short Life and Weird Times of Cold Fusion]]'', he chronicles the short-lived media frenzy surrounding the [[Fleischmann–Pons experiment|Pons–Fleischmann cold fusion experiments]] of 1989. He opines in the book that heat generation in the experiments of Drs. Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons was due entirely to difference in ionic conductivity of deuterated salts solutions compared to normal aqueous solutions.

He also formulated an allegation of fraud regarding the results from [[John Bockris]]'s research group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Dietary science==
[[File:Bookbits - 2011-02-16 Gary Taubes-Why We Get Fat.vorb.oga|thumb|right|Gary Taubes on Bookbits radio.]]

Taubes gained prominence in the [[low-carb]] diet debate following the publication of his 2002 ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' piece "What if It's All Been a Big Fat Lie?".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/07/magazine/what-if-it-s-all-been-a-big-fat-lie.html&lt;/ref&gt; The article, which questioned the efficacy and health benefits of [[low-fat diet]]s, was seen as defending the [[Atkins diet]] against the medical establishment, and it became extremely controversial. Some scholars interviewed for the article complained that Mr. Taubes misinterpreted their words or treated them out of context.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atkinsexposed.org/atkins/11/The_Diet_Fad_of_the_21st_Century.htm Atkins Facts: The Diet Fad of the 21st Century]&lt;/ref&gt; Taubes himself stated: "[E]ven though I knew the article would be the most controversial article the ''Times Magazine'' ran all year, [the reaction] still shocked me."&lt;ref name="knight"&gt;''[http://web.mit.edu/knight-science/fellows/interviews/taubes.html Inside the Story - Gary Taubes: What if It's All Been a Big Fat Lie?]'' (Interview with Martha Henry from the MIT Knight Fellowships program). (July 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] published a rebuttal to the ''Times'' article in its November 2002 newsletter.&lt;ref name="liebman"&gt;Liebman, Bonnie. (November 2002). [http://www.cspinet.org/nah/11_02/bigfatlies.pdf "The Truth About the Atkins Diet"]. ''CSPI Nutrition Action Health Letter''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Taubes: "[T]he [[CSPI]] is an advocacy group that has been pushing low-fat diets since the 1970s."&lt;ref name="taubes"&gt;Taubes, Gary. (March 2003). [http://www.reason.com/news/show/28721.html An exercise in vitriol rather than sound journalism]. ''Reason Online''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Taubes published his book ''[[Good Calories, Bad Calories|Good Calories, Bad Calories: Challenging the Conventional Wisdom on Diet, Weight Control, and Disease]]'' (published as ''The Diet Delusion'' in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]). This book examines how a [[hypothesis]] — that dietary fat is the cause of obesity and heart disease — became [[dogma]], and claims to show how the [[scientific method]] was circumvented so a contestable hypothesis could remain unchallenged. The book uses data and studies compiled from more than a century of dietary research to support what Taubes calls "the alternative hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taubes|first=Gary|title=Good Calories, Bad Calories: Google Book Preview, Notes; pages 469 ff|year=2007|publisher=Knopf|location=|pages=609|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olfyVJLaa_YC&amp;lpg=PA469&amp;dq=%22%22&amp;pg=PA469#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-1-4000-3346-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/21/good-news-on-saturated-fat/#more-344|newspaper=New York Times|last=Tierney|first=John.|title=Good News on Saturated Fat|date=July 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taubes's hypothesis is that the medical community and the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] have relied upon misinterpreted scientific data on nutrition to build the prevailing paradigm about what constitutes healthful eating. Taubes makes the case that — contrary to the conventional wisdom — it is refined carbohydrates that are responsible for heart disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer, and many other "maladies of civilization". In the Epilogue to ''Good Calories, Bad Calories'' on page 454, Taubes notes ten "inescapable" conclusions, the first of which is, "Dietary fat, whether saturated or not, is not a cause of obesity, heart disease, or any other chronic disease of civilization."&lt;ref name="Good Calorie, Bad Calories" &gt;{{cite book|last=Taubes|first=Gary|title=Good Calories, Bad Calories: Google Book Preview, Page 454|year=2007|publisher=Knopf|pages=609|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olfyVJLaa_YC&amp;lpg=PA454&amp;dq=%22%22&amp;pg=PA454#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%22&amp;f=true|isbn=978-1-4000-3346-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Taubes includes information and studies which indicate that [[physical exercise]] increases appetite to a degree that makes it an inefficient tool in weight loss. He tracks the origins of commonly accepted dietary advice and aims to show that information that is filtered to the public often contradicts scientific evidence. On October 19, 2007 Taubes appeared on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' to discuss his book. His book was praised as "raising interesting and valuable points" by [[Andrew Weil]], a proponent of alternative medicine, while [[Mehmet Oz]] and trainer [[Jillian Michaels (personal trainer)|Jillian Michaels]] who appeared on the same program disagreed with Taubes on many questions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0710/19/lkl.01.html Are Fatty Foods Good For You?]. (October 19, 2007). ''Larry King Live''. CNN.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reviews for ''Good Calories, Bad Calories'' have varied. George Bray of the [[Pennington Biomedical Research Center]] in [[Louisiana]] notes in his review that the book "...has much useful information and is well worth reading." but "Obese people clearly eat more than do lean ones."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bray|first=G.A.|date=February 2008|title=Viewpoint – Good Calories, Bad Calories by Gary Taubes; New York: AA Knopf|work=Obesity Reviews|url=http://www.proteinpower.com/drmike/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/bray-review-of-gcbc.pdf|publisher=The International Association for the Study of Obesity|accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Taubes, in a letter to the editor in the same journal, clarifies some of the comments made by Bray. Taubes notes, "The hypothesis favored by Bray and a half century of authorities on human obesity is that fat accumulation is fundamentally caused by positive energy balance." Taubes responds, "The alternative hypothesis begins with the fundamental observation that obesity is a disorder of excess fat accumulation and then asks the obvious question, what regulates fat accumulation. This was elucidated by 1965 and has never been controversial. '[[Insulin]] is the principal regulator of fat metabolism'..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taubes|first=Gary|title=Letter to Editor – Response to Dr George Bray's Review of ''Good Calories, Bad Calories''|url=http://www.proteinpower.com/drmike/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/taubes-response-to-bray-ob-reviews.pdf|work=Obesity Reviews|publisher=The International Association for the Study of Obesity|accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, ''New York Times'' science writer [[John Tierney (journalist)|John Tierney]] cited Taubes's book ''Good Calories, Bad Calories'' and discussed [[information cascades]] and the role of physiologist [[Ancel Keys]] in widely held beliefs related to diet and fat. Tierney follows Taubes in noting that a 2001 [[Cochrane Library|Cochrane meta-analysis]] of low-fat diets found that they had "no significant effect on mortality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tierney|first=John.|title=Diet and Fat: A Severe Case of Mistaken Consensus|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/09/science/09tier.html?_r=3&amp;ref=science&amp;pagewanted=print|date=October 9, 2007|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harriet A. Hall]], however, criticizes Taubes for selectively quoting the meta-analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/why-we-get-fat/|title=Why We Get Fat|author=Hall, Harriet|date=January 18, 2011|publisher=Science-Based Medicine|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Taubes has won the [[Science in Society Journalism Award]] of the [[National Association of Science Writers]] three times and was awarded an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] [[Knight Science Journalism Fellowships|Knight Science Journalism Fellowship]] for 1996–97.&lt;ref name="knight"/&gt; He is a [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] independent investigator in health policy.&lt;ref&gt;Taubes, Gary. (April 13, 2011). [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/magazine/mag-17Sugar-t.html?_r=1&amp;ref=general&amp;src=me&amp;pagewanted=all Is Sugar Toxic?]. ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''glacial erratic''' is a piece of [[Rock (geology)|rock]] that differs from the size and type of rock native to the area in which it rests.  "[[wiktionary:erratic|Erratics]]" take their name from the Latin word ''[[wikt:errare#Latin|errare]]'' (to wander), and are carried by [[glacier|glacial ice]], often over distances of hundreds of kilometres. Erratics can range in size from pebbles to large boulders such as [[Big Rock (glacial erratic)|Big Rock]] ({{convert|15000|t|ST|disp=or}}) in [[Alberta]].

Geologists identify erratics by studying the rocks surrounding the position of the erratic and the composition of the erratic itself. Erratics are significant because:
*They can be transported by glaciers, and they are thereby one of a series of indicators which mark the path of prehistoric glacier movement.  Their lithographic origin can be traced to the parent bedrock, allowing for confirmation of the ice flow route.
*They can be transported by [[ice rafting]]. This allows quantification of the extent of glacial flooding resulting from ice dam failure which release the waters stored in [[proglacial lake]]s such as [[Lake Missoula]]. Erratics released by ice-rafts that were stranded and subsequently melt, dropping their load, allow characterization of the high-water marks for transient floods in areas like temporary [[Lake Lewis]].
*Erratics dropped by [[iceberg]]s melting in the ocean can be used to track Antarctic and Arctic-region glacial movements for periods prior to record retention.  Also known as [[dropstone]]s, these can be correlated with ocean temperatures and levels to better understand and calibrate [[Global climate model|models of the global climate]].&lt;ref name=Bard2004&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bard  |first=Edouard |language=French |title=Effet de serre et glaciations, une perspective historique |trans-title=Greenhouse effect and ice ages: historical perspective  |journal=Comptes Rendus Geoscience |volume=336 |issue=7–8 |pages=603–638 |date=June 2004 |doi=10.1016/j.crte.2004.02.005 |bibcode=2004CRGeo.336..603B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of erratics==

The term "erratic" is commonly used to refer to erratic blocks, which Geikie describes as:  "large masses of rock, often as big as a house, that have been transported by glacier-ice, and have been lodged in a prominent position in the glacier valleys or have been scattered over hills and plains. And examination of their mineralogical character leads the identification of their sources…".&lt;ref name= Geikie1882&gt;{{Cite journal  | last =   Geikie  | first = Sir Archibald    | authorlink =   | title = Textbook of geology  | journal =   | volume =   | issue =   | pages =   | publisher =   | location =   | year = 1882  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QzYAAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=erratic+glacier  | issn =   | doi =   | id =   | accessdate = 12 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In geology, an erratic is material moved by geologic forces from one location to another, usually by a glacier.

Erratics are formed by glacial [[Erosion|ice erosion]] resulting from the movement of ice. [[Glacier]]s erode by multiple processes: abrasion/scouring, [[Plucking (glaciation)|plucking]], ice thrusting and [[ice lens|glacially-induced spalling]]. Glaciers crack pieces of bedrock off in the process of plucking, producing the larger erratics. In an abrasion process, debris in the basal ice scrapes along the bed, polishing and gouging the underlying rocks, similar to sandpaper on wood, producing smaller [[glacial till]].  In ice thrusting, the glacier freezes to its bed, then as it surges forward, it moves large sheets of frozen sediment at the base along with the glacier. Glacially-induced spalling occurs when [[ice lens]] formation with the rocks below the glacier spall off layers of rock, providing smaller debris which is ground into the glacial basal material to become till.&lt;ref name=Bell2008&gt;{{Cite journal  | last =  Bell | first =  Robin E. | authorlink =   | title = The role of subglacial water in ice-sheet mass balance | journal =    [[Nature Geoscience]] | volume =  1  | issue =  5802 | pages =    297–304| publisher =   | location =   | date =  27 April 2008 | url =   | doi= 10.1038/ngeo186| id =    | bibcode=2008NatGe...1..297B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rempel2008&gt;{{Cite journal  | last =  Rempel | first =   A.

Evidence supports another option for creation of erratics as well, rock avalanches onto the upper surface of the glacier (supraglacial). Rock avalanche–supraglacial transport occurs when the glacier undercuts a rock face, which fails by avalanche onto the upper surface of the glacier. The characteristics of rock avalanche–supraglacial transport includes:&lt;ref name=Evenson2009&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Evenson  | first = Edward B.  | authorlink =  |author2=Patrick A.

:*Monolithologic composition &amp;ndash; a cluster of boulders of similar composition are frequently found in close proximity. Commingling of the multiple [[Lithology|lithologies]] normally present throughout the glaciated basin, has not occurred.&lt;ref name=Evenson2009/&gt;
:*Angularity &amp;ndash; the supraglacially transported rocks tend to be rough and irregular, with no sign of subglacial abrasion. The sides of boulders are roughly planar, suggesting that some surfaces may be original fracture planes.&lt;ref name=Evenson2009/&gt;
:*Great size &amp;ndash; the size distribution of the boulders tends to be skewed toward larger boulders than those produced subglacially.&lt;ref name=Evenson2009/&gt;
:*Surficial positioning of the boulders &amp;ndash; the boulders are positioned on the surface of glacial deposits, as opposed to partially or totally buried.&lt;ref name=Evenson2009/&gt;
:*Restricted areal extents &amp;ndash; the boulder fields tend to have limited areal extent; the boulders cluster together, consistent with the boulders landing on the surface of the glacier and subsequently deposited on top of the glacial drift.&lt;ref name=Evenson2009/&gt;
:*Orientations &amp;ndash; the boulders may be close enough that original fracture planes can be matched.&lt;ref name=Evenson2009/&gt;
:*Locations of the boulder trains &amp;ndash; the boulders appear in rows, trains or clusters along the [[lateral moraines]] as opposed to being located on the [[terminal moraine]] or in the general glacial field.&lt;ref name=Evenson2009/&gt;

===Glacier-borne erratic===
[[File:Upsala Glacier, Argentina.jpg|thumb|right|Two icebergs clearly retain fragments of the [[moraine]] (rock debris) that forms a dark line along the upper surface of the glacier. The inclusion of the moraine illustrates how land-based rocks and sediment are carried by ice.]]
Erratics provide an important tool in characterizing the directions of glacier flows, which are routinely reconstructed used on a combination of [[moraine]]s, [[esker]]s, [[drumlin]]s, meltwater channels, and similar data.  Erratic distributions and glacial till properties allow for identification of the source rock from which they derive, which confirms the flow direction, particularly when the erratic source outcrop is unique to a limited locality. Erratic materials may be transported by multiple glacier flows prior to their deposition, which can complicate the reconstruction of the glacial flow.&lt;ref name=Evans2005&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Evans |first=David J.A |author2=Chris D.

===Ice-rafted erratic===
Glacial ice entrains debris of varying sizes from small particles to extremely large masses of rock. This debris is transported to the coast by glacier ice and released during the production, drift and melting of [[iceberg]]s.  The rate of debris release by ice depends upon the size of the ice mass in which it is carried as well as the temperature of the ocean through which the ice floe passes.&lt;ref name=Bond1999&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bond |first=Gerard |author2=[[Hartmut Heinrich]] |author3=Wallace Broecker |author4=Laurent Labeyrie |author5=Jerry McManus |author6=John Andrews |author7=Sylvain Huon |author8=Ruediger Jantschik |author9=Silke Clasen |author10=Christine Simet |author11=Kathy Tedesco |author12=Mieczyslawa Klas |author13=Georges Bonani |author14=Susan Ivy  | title = Evidence for massive discharges of icebergs into the North Atlantic ocean during the last glacial period |journal=Nature |volume=360 |issue=6401 |pages=245–249 |year=1992 |doi=10.1038/360245a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tripatti2007 &gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tripatia |first=Aradhna K. |author2=Robert A.

[[Image:Yeager-Rock-Erractic-PB110039.JPG|thumb|alt=This photo shows an automobile passing in front of a rock which is essentially fully exposed. The rock has a rough, dark surface indicating it is weathered basalt and is roughly circular in exposed cross-section. The rock is immediately adjacent to a roadway – the road cut removed much of the earth from one side of it exposing it &amp;ndash; from the excavation it is evident that the rock sits on a mound of glacial till. The rock is approximately 2 times the length of the car (i.e., ≈9 meters) in one direction and 5 times the height of the car in the other direction (i.e., ≈9 meters). Since the rock has not tipped onto the road and no structural support is provided, it must be approximately as deep as it is wide and high. Since the density of basalt is 3 grams per cubic centimeter, this puts the mass of the rock at about 400 to 500 metric tons (consistent with the references). |[[Yeager Rock]], a {{convert|400|MT|ST|adj=on}} boulder on the Waterville Plateau, [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Although transported by a glacier, this boulder is not a true erratic because it is of the same lithology of the underlying, till-blanketed, bedrock. Note the glacial till below the rock.]]

Sediments from the late [[Pleistocene]] period lying on the floor of the [[North Atlantic]] show a series of layers (referred to at Heinrich layers) which contain ice-rafted debris. They were formed between 14,000 &amp; 70,000 years before the present. The deposited debris can be traced back to the origin by both the nature of the materials released and the continuous path of debris release. Some paths extend more than {{convert|3000|km|mi}} distant from the point at which the ice floes originally broke free.&lt;ref name=Bond1999/&gt;

The location and altitude of ice-rafted boulders relative to the modern landscape has been used to identify the highest level of water in proglacial lakes (e.g., [[Lake Musselshell]] in central [[Montana]]) and temporary lakes (e.g., [[Lake Lewis]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state. Ice-rafted debris is deposited when the iceberg strands on the shore and subsequently melts, or drops out of the ice floe as it melts. Hence all erratic deposits are deposited below the actual high water level of the lake; however the measured altitude of ice-rafted debris can be used to estimate the lake surface elevation.

[[Image:Angular glacial erratic on Lambert Dome-750px.jpg|thumb|right|Angular glacial erratic on [[Lembert Dome]].]]
This is accomplished by recognizing that on a fresh-water lake, the iceberg floats until the volume of its ice-rafted debris exceeds  5% of the volume of the iceberg. Therefore, a correlation between the iceberg size and the boulder size can be established. For example, {{convert|1.5|m|ft|adj=on}} diameter boulder can be carried by a {{convert|3|m|ft|adj=on}} high iceberg and could be found stranded at higher elevations than a {{convert|2|m|ft|adj=on}} boulder which requires a {{convert|4|m|ft|adj=on}} high iceberg.&lt;ref name= Davisa2005&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Davisa  | first = Niole K. |author2=William W.

===Large erratics===

Large erratics consisting of slabs of bedrock that have been lifted and transported by glacier ice to subsequently be stranded above thin glacial or fluvioglacial deposits are referred to as glacial floes, rafts (schollen) or erratic megablocks. Erratic megablocks have typical length to thickness ratios on the order of 100 to 1. These megablocks may be found partially exposed or completely buried by till and are clearly [[allochthon]]us, since they overlay [[glacial till]]. Megablocks can be so large that they are mistaken for bedrock until underlying glacial or fluvial sediments are identified by drilling or excavation. Such erratic megablocks greater than {{convert|1|km2|acre}} in area and {{convert|30|m|ft}} in thickness can be found on the [[Canadian Prairies]], [[Poland]], [[England]], [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]]. One erratic megablock located in [[Saskatchewan]]  is {{convert|30|x|38|km|mi}} (and up to {{convert|100|m|ft|disp=or}} thick). Their sources can be identified by locating the bedrock from which they were separated; several rafts from Poland and Alberta were determined to have been transported over {{convert|300|km|mi}} from their source.&lt;ref name= Talbot1999&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Talbot  | first = Christopher J.  | authorlink =   | title = Ice ages and nuclear waste isolation         | journal = Engineering Geology        | volume = 52  | issue = 3–4  | pages = 177–192      | publisher = Elsevier Science  | location =   | date = April 1999  | url =   | doi =   10.1016/S0013-7952(99)00005-8  | id =    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonglacial erratics===
In geology an erratic is any material which is not native to the immediate locale but has been transported from elsewhere. The most common examples of erratics are associated with glacial transport, either by direct glacier-borne transport or by ice rafting. However, other erratics have been identified as the result of [[kelp]] holdfasts, which have been documented to transport rocks up to {{convert|40|cm|in}} in diameter, rocks entangled in the roots of drifting logs, and  even in transport of stones accumulated in the stomachs of [[pinniped]]s during foraging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Paduan  | first = Jennifer B.  | authorlink =   |author2=David A.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the 18th century, erratics were deemed a major geological paradox. Erratics were once considered evidence of a vast flood approximately 10,000 years ago,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} similar to the legendary floods described in the texts of [[ancient civilizations]] throughout the world. Ancient [[legend]]s of an epic flood come from many cultures including [[Mesoamerican]], [[Sumer]]ian ([[Epic of Gilgamesh]]), [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] ([[Old Testament]]) and [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indian]] culture. Among others, the Swiss politician, jurist and theologican {{ill|Bernhard Friedrich Kuhn|de}} saw glaciers as a possible solution as early as 1788. However the idea of ice ages and glaciation as a geological force took a while to be accepted. [[Ignaz Venetz]] (1788 — 1859), a Swiss engineer, naturalist, and glaciologist was one of the first scientists to recognize glaciers as a major force in shaping the earth.

In the 19th century, many scientists came to favor erratics as evidence for the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] ([[ice age]]) 10,000 years ago, rather than a flood. [[Geologist]]s have suggested that [[landslide]]s or rockfalls initially dropped the rocks on top of glacial ice. The glaciers continued to move, carrying the rocks with them. When the ice melted, the erratics were left in their present locations.

Charles Lyell's ''Principles of Geology'' (v. 1, 1830)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AOcJAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=charles+lyell+principles+of+geology&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Principles of Geology''], Volume 1; Sir Charles Lyell - Geology - 1830&lt;/ref&gt; provided an early description of the erratic which is consistent with the modern understanding. [[Louis Agassiz]] was the first to scientifically propose that the Earth had been subject to a past [[ice age]].&lt;ref name="evans 1887"&gt;E.P. Evans: "[http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/ncps:@field(DOCID+@lit(ABQ7578-0145-13))::|The The Authorship of the Glacial Theory]", ''North American review'' Volume 145, Issue 368, July 1887. Accessed on February 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. Prior to this proposal, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Horace-Bénédict de Saussure|de Saussure]], [[Ignaz Venetz|Venetz]], [[Jean de Charpentier]], [[Karl Friedrich Schimper]] and others had made the [[glacier]]s of the Alps the subjects of special study, and Goethe,&lt;ref name="goethe"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.igsoc.org/journal/5/41/igs_journal_vol05_issue041_pg751-754.pdf|title=Early discoverers XXII, Goethe-Discoverer of the ice age. Journal of glaciology|last=Cameron|first=Dorothy|year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charpentier as well as Schimper&lt;ref name="evans 1887" /&gt; had even arrived at the conclusion that the erratic blocks of alpine rocks scattered over the slopes and summits of the [[Jura Mountains]] had been moved there by glaciers.

[[Charles Darwin]] published extensively on geologic phenomena including the distribution of erratic boulders. In his accounts written during the voyage of {{HMS|Beagle}}, Darwin observed a number of large erratic boulders of notable size south of the [[Strait of Magellan]], [[Tierra del Fuego]] and attributed them to ice rafting from [[Antarctica]]. Recent research suggests that they are more likely the result of glacial ice flows carrying the boulders to their current locations.&lt;ref&gt;Edward B. Evenson, Patrick A. Burkhart, John C.

Examples of erratics include:

* [[The Hitching Stone]] in [[Yorkshire]], [[England]].  It’s the largest erratic block in the county.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bradfordhistorical.org.uk/boundary.html|title=On the Bradford District's Western Boundary|website=www.bradfordhistorical.org.uk|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Plymouth Rock]], the site in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]] that the ''[[Mayflower]]'' [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] landed in 1620. It is an important symbol in American history.
* Indian Rock in [[Montebello, New York]] is a large glacial erratic boulder of granite gneiss, formed in the Proterozoic (Precambrian) era, 1.2 billion to 800 million years ago. It is estimated to weigh ≈17,300 tons. The source area for the boulder was nearby in the Ramapo Mountains-Hudson Highlands. The boulder rests upon glacial outwash which in turn lies atop Triassic sedimentary red beds (sandstone and shale) of the Newark Basin (circa 145 million years old). The rock was carried to its current location by the internal flow of the continental ice sheet during the last glacial maximum, circa 21,000 years ago. The base of the continental glacier scoured the bedrock terrain across which it moved, thus plucking large and small blocks of rock from their position in the Ramapo Mountains and Hudson Highlands. Indian Rock got as far as Rockland County before being liberated by the ice and deposited along with gravels shifted by glacial meltwater.

===Flood-borne erratics===
In the event that glacial ice is "rafted" by a flood such as that created when the ice dam broke during the [[Missoula Floods]], the erratics are deposited where the ice finally releases its debris load. One of the more unusual examples is found far from its origin in Idaho at [[Erratic Rock State Natural Site]] just outside [[McMinnville, Oregon]]. The park includes a {{convert|40|ST|MT|adj=on}} specimen, the largest erratic found in the [[Willamette Valley]].

{{for|a Polish unit of weight|Grzywna (unit)}}
'''Grivna''' was a currency as well as a measure of weight used in [[Kievan Rus']] and other East Slavic countries since the 11th century.&lt;ref name=Langer/&gt;

== Name ==
The word ''grivna'' is derived from {{proto|slavic|grivĭna|necklace}} from {{proto|slavic|griva|neck, nape, mane}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref-ru}} {{cite book|title=Etimilogicheskiy slovar' slavyanskikh yazykov|script-title=Этимологический словарь славянских языков|editor-first=Oleg|editor-last= Trubachyov|date=1980|place=Moscow|volume=7|pages=129–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Old East Slavic it had the form {{lang|orv|гривьна}} ''grivĭna''. In modern East Slavic languages it has such forms: {{lang-ru|гри́вна}} ''grivna'', {{lang-uk|гри́вня}} ''hryvnia'', {{lang-be|гры́ўня}} ''hryŭnia''. 

The name of the contemporary currency of Ukraine, ''[[hryvnia]]'', is derived from the ancient grivna.

== History ==

=== Early period ===
As its etymology implies the word originally meant a necklace or a torque, however the reason why it has taken the meaning of a unit of weight is unclear. The grivnas that have been found at various archaeological sites are not necklaces but [[bullion]]s of precious metals, usually silver. The weight and the shape of grivnas were not uniform, but varied by region. The grivnas of Novgorod and Pskov were thin long round-edged or three-edged ingots, while Kievan grivnas has rather the shape of a prolonged rhombus. The material was either gold or silver, but silver was predominant.&lt;ref name=Riha/&gt; Originally the weight of a grivna was close to the Roman or Byzantine [[pound (mass)|pound]]. The weight of the Kievan grivna was around {{convert|140-165|g|lb|abbr=on}}. The Novgorod grivna had the weight {{convert|204|g|lb}} and became the basis for monetary systems of North-Eastern Russian principalities and the emerging Russian state.&lt;ref name=SlovarGrivna/&gt;

Along the "grivna of silver" there were the account "grivna of kuna". The latter originally signified a certain amount of marten furs (''kuna'' is the word for marten in slavic languages). Since the 12th century the "grivna of kuna" became another unit of weight, but smaller, and signified as well a certain amount of silver coins: 2.5-gram ''nogata'' (from {{lang-ar|نقد}} ''naqd'' 'money; a coin') and ''rezan'' ({{frac|1|2}} [[dirham]]).&lt;ref name=SlovarKuna/&gt;

:1 grivna of silver (204 g) = 4 grivnas of kuna (51 g) = 80 nogata coins = 100 kunas (marten furs) = 200 rezans = 400–600 vekshas (squirrel furs)

=== Later period ===
Since the 14th century, when coins started to be minted in North-Eastern Rus (firstly in Moscow), the currency system of silver bullions and furs was becoming obsolete. The grivna became to mean not a weight but rather a partucular number of silver coins called then ''denga''. At the same time as early as the 13th century the word ruble (''rubl''') started to be used alongside the word grivna to mean a certain amount of either silver or silver coins. Thus one account ruble was equal to 216 denga coins (each weighted about 0.8 gram). The ''grivna of kuna'' became simply grivna and was equal to 14 dengas. Thus one ruble was equal to 15 new grivnas and 6 denga coins.

The weight of a denga coin in Moscow and Novgorod was different. In the 15th century the Moscow denga fell as low as 0.4 gram, while the Novgorod denga remained the same. When in Moscow one ruble had been revalued to 200 denga coins, the exchange rate between Moscow and Novgorod denga coins was set to 2 to 1. Thus since the later 15th – the early 16th centuries one account ruble was equal to 100 Novgorod dengas (later known as ''kopeks'') or to 200 Moscow dengas. In this system one grivna was equal to 10 kopeks or 20 dengas. 

This last meaning survived into the 18th–20th centuries when one '''grivennik''' or '''grivenka''' meant a 10-kopek coin.

== Weight ==
The grivna as a silver bullion currency did not survive, but its meaning as a unit of weight became predominant. In 15th–17th centuries there were two weight grivnas (or ''grivenkas''): the "'''lesser grivna'''" of {{convert|204.756|g|ozt|abbr=on}} and the "'''greater grivna'''" of {{convert|409.512|g|ozt|abbr=on}}. Since the middle of the 17th century the latter became known as the Russian pound (Фунт, ''funt''). 40 Russian pounds or 80 lesser grivnas (grivenkas) are equal to one [[pood]].

It's important because high pressure [[Injection pump|injection pumps]] are only lubricated by the fuel itself. [[Density]] and [[viscosity]] are not sufficient describing the aptitude of the fuel.

The '''Institute for Marine Mammal Studies''' ("IMMS") is a major non-profit organization established in 1984 for the education, conservation, and research on [[marine mammal]]s in the wild and in captivity. It is located in [[Gulfport, Mississippi]], [[United States of America]] and has been an active participant of the National Stranding Network{{huh?|date=August 2015}} since its inception. The Institute is the only organization in the Mississippi-Louisiana-Alabama subregion of the Gulf Coast with the ability  to both care for sick and injured marine mammals, and also incorporate programs for [[Conservation movement|conservation]], education and research on marine mammals and their environment. Also, every summer an educational camp is held. It is a week long camp, and it in includes a dolphin encounter, the touch pool, and each level does different activities. Some are fun, and some educational on the basis of IMMS's purpose.

The Institute's '''Center for Marine Education and Research''', located in Gulfport, features a museum with exhibits, aquarium tanks and touch pools.  Open by reservation, the tours include [[dolphin]] encounters.

The Institute for Marine Mammal Studies has received a number of grants of several million dollars from  the  [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]  [https://web.archive.org/web/20061002202026/http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2004/sep04/noaa04-r999-01.html],

The '''Kandadji Dam''', when completed, will be a large multipurpose dam on the [[Niger River]]. The site is situated near the small town of [[Kandadji]], [[Tillabéri Department]], [[Tillabéri Region]], [[Niger]], 180&amp;nbsp;km northwest of the capital [[Niamey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/NG/9/Kandadji.html Kandadji, Niger Page]. Falling Rain.com. Retrieved 2009-02-01&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the dam was begun in August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://appablog.wordpress.com/2008/10/10/niger-afd-bank-group-president-receives-niger%E2%80%99s-finance-and-economy-minister/ Niger / AfD Bank Group President receives Niger’s Finance and Economy Minister]. African Press Organization (APO). October 10, 2008/&lt;/ref&gt; It is being built by the ''Haut Commissariat à l'Aménagement de la Vallée du Niger'' (High Commission for Niger Valley), a public body under the Primer Minister's Office. The dam will generate hydropower and is aimed at controlling the flow of the Niger River, holding water during the dry season to maintain a minimum flow and making downstream irrigation possible. The project is formally named the ''Kandadji Programme for Ecosystem Regeneration and Niger River Development'' (''Programme Kandadji de Régénération des Ecosystèmes et de Mise en Valeur du Fleuve Niger''). In 2008&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;ReutersAlertNet:[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L4302162.htm Niger begins building dam for food, electricity], 4 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; the dam itself was expected to be completed in 2013.

Construction has been slower than expected, with interruptions due to financing problems; as of 2018, completion is expected in 2020.&lt;ref name=apa2018&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobile.apanews.net/en/news/president-issoufou-wants-more-infrastructure-in-niger|title=President Issoufou wants more infrastructure in Niger|date=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is a very high-profile project for Niger. According to the Prime Minister at the time of initiating construction, [[Seyni Oumarou]], "no other development project will have sparked so much long term interest or such high expectations". The first brick of the dam was laid by the President of Niger, [[Mamadou Tandja]].&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

== History ==
The project was first proposed in the 1970s, when a larger dam had been considered. In 1998 the African Development Bank approved funding for a feasibility study that was conducted by the German consulting firm Lahmeyer. Under the study, an environmental and social diagnosis and an initial environmental and social assessment were conducted. The findings were presented in 2002. In August 2002 the government decided by Decree to go ahead with the project, which was from that time called the Kandadji Ecosystems Regeneration and Niger Valley Development Programme. Subsequently, a detailed assessment of environmental and social impact, including a Population Resettlement Plan and a Local Development Plan, was conducted. The Local Development Plan was designed to facilitate the economic transition of displaced persons in order to restore their standard of living or even enhance it, beyond mere resettlement. The final design of the dam was prepared with financing from the [[Islamic Development Bank]], and that of a {{convert|2000|ha}} irrigation project with financing from the [[West African Development Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;Republic of Niger, Prime Minister’s Office, High Commission for Niger Valley / African Development Bank:[http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Environmental-and-Social-Assessments/ADF-BD-IF-2008-51-EN-NIGER-KANDADJI-ECOSYSTEMS-REGENERATION-DETAILED-POPULATION-RESETTLEMENT-PLAN.PDF "KANDADJI" ECOSYSTEMS REGENERATION AND NIGER VALLEY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME (KERNVDP), DETAILED POPULATION RESETTLEMENT PLAN], EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, February 2008, p. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 and 2006 consultations were undertaken as part of the environmental and social assessment, which included participants from the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].&lt;ref&gt;Republic of Niger, Prime Minister’s Office, High Commission for Niger Valley / African Development Bank:[http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Environmental-and-Social-Assessments/ADF-BD-IF-2008-50-EN-NIGER-ESIA-KANDADJI-ECOSYSTEMS-REGENERATION-AND-NIGER-VALLEY-DEVELOPMENT-PROGRAMME.PDF "KANDADJI" ECOSYSTEMS REGENERATION AND NIGER VALLEY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME (KERNVDP), DETAILED ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT, EXECUTIVE SUMMARY], January 2008, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; According to one source, construction of the dam was begun in August 2008. In April 2009 a workshop on benefit sharing from dams in West Africa was held in Niamey organized by the [[Niger Basin Authority]], the [[International Institute for Environment and Development]] and the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. The workshop recommended to improve the communication towards the people affected by the dam and to pay particular attention to legal processes related to resettlement, and to continue to reflect on a future management structure to equitably share the benefits of the dam.&lt;ref&gt;[[IUCN]]:[http://www.iucn.org/fr/propos/union/secretariat/bureaux/paco/programmes/peauzh/?3138/Les-acteurs-echangent-sur-le-partage-des-benefices-et-la-gestion-des-reservoirs Les acteurs échangent sur le partage des bénéfices et la gestion des réservoirs], 6 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009 a process to select consultants to accompany the resettlement has been initiated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydroworld.com/index/display/article-display.articles.hrhrw.tendersandnotices.tenders.2009.11.niger-seeks_relocation.QP129867.dcmp=rss.page=1.html Niger seeks relocation consultants for 125-MW Kandadji], 20 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the World Bank, the entire Kandadji Program will be implemented in three phases:
* Phase I, which started in 2009 and is expected to be completed in 2016, comprises the Kandadji dam and its reservoir, the hydro-mechanical equipment for the 18 gates, economic and local community development, and implementation of environmental and social mitigation measures for resettled people;
* Phase II comprises construction of the hydropower plant, transmission lines, road, irrigated agricultural development, and expanded local and community development in the reservoir area and downstream, and
* Phase III focuses on the development  of irrigated agriculture and the scaling-up of the economy and local community development of the region (including fisheries, livestock, agribusiness and trade.&lt;ref name="World Bank Fact Sheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kandadji Program in the Sahel|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTAFRICA/Resources/257994-1349215552505/niger-kandadji-program-boost-regional-economic-growth-agriculture-electricity-sahel-fact-sheet.pdf|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the dam itself was contracted to Russian company [[Zarubezhvodstroy]], which signed the construction contract in September 2010.&lt;ref name=Zarubezhvodstroy/&gt; Construction of the dam was relaunched at a ceremony on 23 May 2011, following the election of President [[Mahamadou Issoufou]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africanmanager.com/articles/133576.html Le président du Niger lance la construction d’un barrage hydro-électrique].

Gudzenchuk, announced "For the first time a Russian company is involved in building such a large project in West Africa at the expense of foreign investors. Zarubezhvodstroy has vast experience in the field that would allow us to meet the challenges with confidence and with great professionalism."&lt;ref name="Kandaji Dam: History"/&gt;

Plans were announced in June 2011 to relocate 5383 individuals and 770 families who will be displaced by the dam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afriquinfos.com/articles/2011/6/23/niger-180771.asp Les riverains du barrage de Kandadji seront déplacés et indemnisés - Afriquinfos]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical features ==
The earth dyke dam will be 8.4&amp;nbsp;km dam long, creating a reservoir of 1.6 billion m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a regulated discharge of 120&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s (3.8&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year) in Niamey. The hydroelectric plant will have a capacity of 130 megawatt, and a 132 kilovolt high voltage line will be built over 188&amp;nbsp;km to Niamey. Irrigation development will consist of a first phase of 6,000 hectares mainly for the benefit of resettled communities, with a medium-term target in 2034 of 45,000 hectares out of an irrigable potential of 122,000 hectares.&lt;ref&gt;Republic of Niger, Prime Minister’s Office, High Commission for Niger Valley / African Development Bank:[http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Environmental-and-Social-Assessments/ADF-BD-IF-2008-51-EN-NIGER-KANDADJI-ECOSYSTEMS-REGENERATION-DETAILED-POPULATION-RESETTLEMENT-PLAN.PDF "KANDADJI" ECOSYSTEMS REGENERATION AND NIGER VALLEY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME (KERNVDP), DETAILED POPULATION RESETTLEMENT PLAN], EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, February 2008, p. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
The expected benefits include increased agricultural production and hydropower generation. Niger imports almost half of its electricity consumption of {{convert|440|e6kWh}} (2007) from neighboring Nigeria, which itself suffers frequent power cuts. The plant would increase installed capacity in Niger from 240 [[Megawatt]] (MW) in 2007 to 370&amp;nbsp;MW (+55%).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]]:http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/country/country_energy_data.cfm?fips=NG Niger Energy Profile, accessed on January 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Other expected benefits are related to "drinking water supply, sanitation, improved flood recession cropping, grazing and fishery".&lt;ref name="Saudi"&gt;AfricanManager:[http://www.africanmanager.com/site_eng/detail_article.php?art_id=12796 Saudi Fund grants US$20 million to Niger for Kandadji dam], 9 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial costs ==
The financial costs of the broader project, including the infrastructure for irrigation and drinking water supply, were estimated at US$670 million by one source in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters:[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL03684978 Niger says secures $236 mln Islamic funding for dam], 3 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Another source mentions US$942 million in 2011.&lt;ref name="sg.news.yahoo.com"/&gt; The contract to build the dam itself, however, is apparently only worth Euro 130million.&lt;ref name=Zarubezhvodstroy/&gt; According to the World Bank, the Kandadji Program (Phase I and Phase II) is expected to cost US$785 million.&lt;ref name="World Bank Fact Sheet"/&gt;

== Financing ==
Financing comes from ten sources: the African Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, the West African Development Bank, the Saudi Fund for Development, the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, the OPEC Fund for International Development, the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, the Bank for Investment and Development of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) and the Government of Niger.&lt;ref name=Zarubezhvodstroy&gt;{{cite web|title=News|url=http://www.zvs.ru/en/about/news/|publisher=Zarubezhvodstroy|accessdate=29 April 2013|date=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific amounts are as follows, as far as known:
* US$236 million was pledged by the [[Islamic Development Bank]].&lt;ref name="HydroWorld.com"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/2008/11/african-bank-funds-nigers-125-mw-kandadji-dam-ecosystems.html|title=African bank funds Niger's 125-MW Kandadji Dam, ecosystems|publisher=HydroWorld.com|accessdate=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* US$15 million was pledged by the [[OPEC Fund for International Development]] in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;OFID:[http://www.ofid.org/projects_operations/commitments_2008.aspx Commitments in 2008], accessed on January 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* US$62 million were approved in October 2008 by the [[African Development Bank]] through a combined loan and grant.&lt;ref&gt;African Development Bank:[http://www.afdb.org/en/news-events/article/niger-us-62-million-adf-funding-for-the-development-of-niger-valley-ecosystems-3398/ Niger: US$62 Million ADF Funding for the development of Niger Valley Ecosystems], 31 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* US$20 million were approved in January 2010 by the [[Saudi foreign assistance|Saudi Development Fund]].
&lt;ref name="Saudi"/&gt;
* US$200 million from the World Bank.&lt;ref name="World Bank Fact Sheet"/&gt;

Financing for the hydropower station itself is due to come from a public-private partnership.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HydroWorld.com"/&gt;

== Environmental, social and downstream impact ==
Negative social impacts include the resettlement of almost 35,000 people from 15 villages, loss of infrastructure (a national road, boreholes, clinics, schools, mosques, slaughterhouses, markets and grain mills) and loss of about 7,000 ha of agricultural land. According to a 2007 report by [[UNEP]]'s Dams and Development Project, which itself was a follow-up activity to a report by the [[World Commission on Dams]], the Kandadji project "serves as a useful example of the projection and estimation of social effects, which appears to have been widely encompassing, covering both negative impacts and benefits". These impacts were "projected at an early stage in project planning, enabling issues and potential impacts to be addressed in subsequent planning phases".&lt;ref&gt;[[UNEP]]:[http://www.unep.org/dams/files/Compendium/Report_SIA.pdf DAMS AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT, COMPENDIUM ON RELEVANT PRACTICES, Social Impact Assessment of Affected People], Final Report, August 2007, p. x, accessed on January 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is expected to improve the river's ecology, which has suffered from a 30% decline in river flows since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Republic of Niger, Prime Minister’s Office, High Commission for Niger Valley / African Development Bank:[http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Environmental-and-Social-Assessments/ADF-BD-IF-2008-51-EN-NIGER-KANDADJI-ECOSYSTEMS-REGENERATION-DETAILED-POPULATION-RESETTLEMENT-PLAN.PDF "KANDADJI" ECOSYSTEMS REGENERATION AND NIGER VALLEY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME (KERNVDP), DETAILED POPULATION RESETTLEMENT PLAN], EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, February 2008, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The dam would regulate flows. According to press reports from Nigeria, the project would reduce the river flow to Nigeria by at least 10 percent, thus jeopardizing power production from two existing dams in Nigeria and meaning a "colossal loss (...) to the agricultural capacity of (Nigerian) states that border the River Niger".&lt;ref&gt;BusinessdayOnline:[http://www.businessdayonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2276:new-dam-on-river-niger-why-it-is-crucial-nigeria-responds-&amp;catid=117:news&amp;Itemid=298 New dam on River Niger: Why it is crucial Nigeria responds], 8 January 2009, by Martin Ayankola&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the 2008 environmental assessment of the project, the "modifications of the quantities of water flowing into the Niger River as a result of the Kandadji dam will be minimal in Nigeria". The average loss through evaporation and modification of the Niger River water flows in Nigeria will be low (2.3% at Jebba) and there will be positive impacts by improving the minimum water level in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;Republic of Niger, Prime Minister’s Office, High Commission for Niger Valley / African Development Bank:[http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Environmental-and-Social-Assessments/ADF-BD-IF-2008-50-EN-NIGER-ESIA-KANDADJI-ECOSYSTEMS-REGENERATION-AND-NIGER-VALLEY-DEVELOPMENT-PROGRAMME.PDF "KANDADJI" ECOSYSTEMS REGENERATION AND NIGER VALLEY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME (KERNVDP), DETAILED ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT, EXECUTIVE SUMMARY], January 2008, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46045">There have been a vast number of designs of [[steam boiler]], particularly towards the end of the 19th century when the technology was evolving rapidly. A great many of these took the names of their originators or primary manufacturers, rather than a more descriptive name. Some large manufacturers also made boilers of several types. Accordingly, it is difficult to identify their technical aspects from merely their name. This list presents these known, notable names and a brief description of their main characteristics.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;See also [[#donkey boiler|donkey boiler]].&lt;br&gt;A small boiler may be used as an auxiliary boiler when at sea, or a donkey boiler in port. A ''composite auxiliary boiler'' does this, using waste heat from the main engines when at sea, or is separately fired when acting as a donkey boiler. Auxiliary boilers were also present in some locomotives, in particular those used in passenger rail service, where steam was used as heating for the cars being pulled. With the advent of [[head end power]], these steam boilers were phased out, often being replaced with concrete weights.

'''Loscoe''' is a village near [[Heanor]] in [[Derbyshire]], England, lying within the [[civil parish]] of Heanor and Loscoe. [[Denby#Related hamlets|Denby Common and Codnor Breach]] are outlying hamlets on the western edge of the village.

==History==
The name Loscoe derives from the [[Old Norse]] words ''lopt'' (or ''loft'') and ''skógr'', specifically in the phrase ''lopt í skógi'', and means 'loft in a wood' or 'wood with a lofthouse'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DPsavev7yQ8C&amp;pg=PA183&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;dq=old+scandinavian+loscoe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X9Iv8cWXDt&amp;sig=yBMsc_yc2-MGDUTdkTFGWJg9wHY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-sI7utuPLAhUGkSwKHTv_Dm4Q6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=old%20scandinavian%20loscoe&amp;f=false |title=Language Contact and Development around the North Sea |editor1=Merja Stenroos |editor2=Martti Mäkinen |editor3=Inge Særheim |year=2012 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |pages=177–184 |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mills&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tXucAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA307&amp;lpg=PA307&amp;dq=loscoe+dictionary+place+names+mills&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D1nm56CwAJ&amp;sig=hA5IrIz7xt8zYG257FvK8nqB9VM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmqsj9s-PLAhUCHw8KHU7jCMwQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=loscoe%20dictionary%20place%20names%20mills&amp;f=false |title=A Dictionary of British Place Names |first=David |last=Mills |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2011 |page=307 |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was recorded as ''Loscowe'' in 1277.&lt;ref name=mills/&gt;

Loscoe Manor formed part of the wider Draycott Estate; Richard and William de Draycott were recorded at Loscoe (or Loschowe) in 1401.

In the 19th and 20th centuries Loscoe's economy was dominated by coal mining, so that pit chimneys and spoil heaps were prominent features of landscape. Three mines operated in the village: Old Loscoe (early 1830s – 1933),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aditnow.co.uk/Mines/Loscoe-Coal-Colliery_9235/ |title=Loscoe Coal Colliery (United Kingdom) |publisher=AditNow.co.uk |date= |accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey Brook (1847–1938)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aditnow.co.uk/Mines/Bailey-Brook-Coal-Colliery_9232/ |title=Bailey Brook Coal Colliery (United Kingdom) |publisher=AditNow.co.uk |date= |accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ormonde (1908–1970).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aditnow.co.uk/Mines/Ormonde-Coal-Colliery_9231/ |title=Ormonde Coal Colliery (United Kingdom) |publisher=AditNow.co.uk |date= |accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heanorhistory.org.uk/loscoe.htm |title=Loscoe |publisher=Heanor and District Local History Society |date=29 September 2013 |accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loscoe was within the [[ecclesiastical parish]] of Heanor until 1844, when a new church was built between Loscoe and the neighbouring village of [[Codnor]] to the north, and a new joint parish created for them. Loscoe formed its own parish in 1927; initially services were held in the mission church until a new parish church, dedicated to [[St Luke]], was built in 1938.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

Loscoe was the site of a [[landfill gas migration]] explosion on 24 March 1986. Although there were no fatalities, one house was completely destroyed by the blast and its three occupants injured. The atmospheric pressure on the night of the explosion fell 29 [[Pascal (unit)|hPa]] (29 [[Bar (unit)|mbar]]) over a seven-hour period, causing the gas to be released from the ground in much greater quantities than usual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=When barometric pressure is lethal|work=[[Irish Times]]|location=Dublin|date=5 July 2003|first=Brendan|last=McWilliams|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the four hours before the explosion, which occurred at approximately 6.30 am, the local [[Met Office|meteorological office]] had recorded average falls of 4 hPa (4 mbar) per hour.&lt;ref name="newscientist"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Roger|last=Milne|title=Methane menace seeps to the surface|journal=[[New Scientist]]|date=25 February 1988|page=27|volume=117|issue=1601|issn=0262-4079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several cubic metres of [[landfill gas]] (consisting of a 3:2 mixture of [[methane]] and [[carbon dioxide]]) collected under the ground near the house at 51 Clarke Avenue, and as the gas expanded it flowed into the space beneath the floor, from where it was drawn by convection to the gas central-heating boiler and ignited.&lt;ref name=newscientist/&gt;

This incident led (in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]) to the introduction of key legislation and government guidance, much research into landfill behaviour,&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ayoung/landfill.html DoE Report CWM039A+B/92] Young, A. (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; and revised best practice at landfill sites. Over time, these were designed to vent gas to the atmosphere, then to burn off methane and eventually, in the most productive sites, use gas turbines to turn the gas into electricity for the national grid.

'''''Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome''''' (also known as '''''Mad Max 3''''') is a 1985 Australian [[utopian and dystopian fiction|dystopian]] [[action film]] directed by [[George Miller (director)|George Miller]] and [[George Ogilvie]], distributed by [[Warner Bros.]], and written by Miller and [[Terry Hayes]]. In this sequel to ''[[Mad Max 2|Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior]]'', Max ([[Mel Gibson]]) is exiled into the desert by the corrupt ruler of Bartertown, Aunty Entity ([[Tina Turner]]), and there encounters an isolated [[cargo cult]] centered on a crashed [[Boeing 747]] and its deceased captain. The film is the third installment in the [[Mad Max (franchise)|''Mad Max'' film series]] and the last with Gibson as Max. The series was later given a fourth installment in 2015 with ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]'', starring [[Tom Hardy]] in the title role.

==Plot==
In [[post-apocalyptic]] Australia, [[Max Rockatansky]] crosses the desert in a camel-drawn wagon when he is attacked by a pilot named Jedediah and his son in a [[Transavia PL-12 Airtruk]], stealing his wagon and belongings. Continuing on foot, Max follows their trail to the seedy community of Bartertown. While refused entry, Max is brought before the founder and ruler of Bartertown, the ruthless Aunty Entity. She offers to resupply his vehicle and equipment if he completes a task for her.

Aunty explains that Bartertown depends on a crude [[methane]] [[Anaerobic digestion|refinery]] powered by pig feces, which is run by a dwarf called Master and his giant bodyguard Blaster. "Master Blaster" holds an uneasy truce with Aunty for control of Bartertown; however, Master has begun to challenge Aunty's leadership. Aunty instructs Max to provoke a confrontation with Blaster in Thunderdome, a gladiatorial arena where conflicts are resolved by a duel to the death. Max enters the refinery to size up Master Blaster and befriends Pig Killer, a convict sentenced to work for slaughtering a pig to feed his family. Max finds his [[Pursuit Special|stolen vehicle]] in Master Blaster's possession, and helps disarm his booby-trapped engine to converse with him. Here he discovers that Blaster is exceptionally strong but extremely sensitive to high-pitched noises.

Max then faces Blaster in the Thunderdome and uses his weakness to gain the upper hand. He refuses to kill him after discovering he has a severe [[Developmental disability|developmental disability]]. He tells Aunty it was not part of their deal, thus revealing her plot. Master, previously unaware of this arrangement to kill Blaster, is furious and vows to shut down the refinery and, by extension, Bartertown. An enraged Aunty has Blaster executed, Master imprisoned, and Max exiled. He is bound on a horse and sent off in a random direction through the wasteland. When his mount perishes in a sinkhole, Max frees himself and presses on.

Near death, Max is found by a desert dweller named Savannah Nix, who hauls him back to her home, a primitive community of children and teenagers who live in an oasis. The children, survivors of a crashed [[Boeing 747]], were left by their parents who went to find civilization. They believe Max to be the flight captain, G. L. Walker, returned to fix the aeroplane and fly them to civilization. Max denies this and insists that they remain in the relative safety of the oasis, knowing that the only "civilization" within reach is Bartertown.

Some of the children, led by Savannah, leave anyway, determined to find the prophesied "Tomorrow-morrow Land." Max stops them by force, but another tribe member, Scrooloose, sets them free during the night and leaves with them. Their leader, Slake M'Thirst, asks Max to go after them, and he agrees, taking a few of the children with him to help. They find Savannah's group in danger but are unable to save one of the children from a sinkhole. With no supplies left, they are forced to head for Bartertown.

The group sneak in via the underground, and, with Pig Killer's help, free Master and escape in a train-truck, destroying Bartertown's methane refinery in the process. Aunty leads the inhabitants in pursuit, catching up to the train. Max's group slows them down while Scrooloose hijacks one of the pursuing vehicles, which happens to be Max's stolen vehicle. The group comes across Jedediah and his son, and Max coerces Jedediah into helping his group escape with their aeroplane. Max uses his vehicle to clear a path through Aunty's men, allowing the aeroplane to take off and escape, leaving him at Aunty's mercy. Aunty spares his life, having come to respect him, and departs to presumably make good on her vow to rebuild Bartertown.

Jedediah flies the children to the coast, where they discover the nuclear-devastated ruins of [[Sydney]]. Years later, the children have established a small society of themselves and other lost wanderers in the ruins. Savannah, now leader of the group, recites a nightly story of their journey and the man who saved them, as Max, still alive in the desert, wanders on to places unknown.

==Cast==
* [[Mel Gibson]] as [[Max Rockatansky|"Mad" Max Rockatansky]], a former MFP officer and lone warrior. Max roves the desert aimlessly, his existence entirely based around [[self-sufficiency|self-survival]].
* [[Tina Turner]] as Aunty Entity, the ruthless, determined ruler of Bartertown. Entity is a glamorous, Amazon-like figure who recognises a strength of character in Max, and hopes to exploit him to gain sole control of Bartertown from Master. Despite her brutality and Bartertown's chaos, Entity is an intelligent, cultured woman, who holds a hope of one day rebuilding society to its former glory. In regard of the character, Miller said, "We needed someone whose vitality and intelligence would make her control over Bartertown credible. She had to be a positive character rather than a conventional evil 'bad guy.' We had worked on the script with [Turner] in mind. But we had no idea if she'd be interested."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tina Turner Excels in First Dramatic Role in 'Mad Max' Movie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mLQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|journal=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]|date=29 July 1985|volume=68|issue=20|page=30|accessdate=7 April 2015|publisher=[[Johnson Publishing Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bruce Spence]] as Jedediah the Pilot, a marauding pilot who trades stolen goods in Bartertown. Spence previously played the Gyro Captain in ''Mad Max 2''. "They were well into the shoot when they offered me a part described as 'not the Gyro Captain but kind of like the Gyro Captain!'" said Spence. "They said there's kind of a reflection of him and that they were having difficulty casting the role so they thought to themselves, 'Why not Bruce!'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Returning to the road with Mad Max's original adventures|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/returning-road-mad-maxs-original-adventures/|website=[[GamesRadar]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|accessdate=14 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514035348/http://www.gamesradar.com/returning-road-mad-maxs-original-adventures/|archivedate=14 May 2015|date=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Please do not speculate as to whether this character is the same character as the one in Mad Max 2 until you have at least taken your speculation to discussion. --&gt;
* [[Adam Cockburn (actor)|Adam Cockburn]] as Jedediah Jr., Jedediah's son, who often helps his father steal supplies, flying his father's aeroplane while Jedediah procures the goods.
* [[Frank Thring]] as The Collector, head of Bartertown's trade and exchange network.
* [[Angelo Rossitto]] as Master, a diminutive former engineer, who parlays his technical expertise into building the methane extractor responsible for Bartertown's electricity. When the film begins, Master has grown power-crazed under the protection of Blaster, and the reverence he receives from the people of Bartertown. He frequently humiliates Entity into acknowledging his power over her. When Blaster is killed however, Master becomes a far more subdued, humble character, and eventually escapes with the help of Max, Pig Killer, and the children.
* Paul Larsson as Blaster, Master's silent, mentally-impaired bodyguard.
* [[Angry Anderson]] as Ironbar Bassey, head of Bartertown's security and Aunty Entity's Number One Henchman. Despite his short height he is a fierce warrior figure, wearing a doll's head standard on his back, who comes to dislike Max more and more as the film proceeds. After several near-death incidents where his survival becomes more and more unlikely, he is presumably killed in the film's climactic chase, last seen giving the middle finger to the escaping heroes.
* [[Robert Grubb]] as Pig Killer, a convict in Bartertown sentenced to work in the methane refinery, shovelling pig feces. He befriends Max, and when Max and the children return to rescue Master, Pig Killer escapes to help them.
* [[Helen Buday]] as Savannah Nix, leader of a tribe of child survivors (or the children of those survivors) from a crashed 747. Savannah is the one who ensures the tribe remembers its past through the "tells" and acts as a surrogate mother figure to many of them. She is also the partner of Slake.
* Tom Jennings as Slake M'Thirst, the male leader of the child tribe.
* [[Edwin Hodgeman]] as Dr. Dealgood, the flamboyant Master of Ceremonies and chief auctioneer of Bartertown.
*Rod Zuanic as Scrooloose.
* [[George Spartels]] as Blackfinger.

==Production==
''Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome'' was the first ''Mad Max'' film made without producer [[Byron Kennedy]], who was killed in a helicopter crash in 1983 while location scouting for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Byron Kennedy, 33, Producer of Film, 'The Road Warrior'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/20/obituaries/byron-kennedy-33-producer-of-film-the-road-warrior.html|accessdate=12 May 2015|work=[[United Press International]]|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=20 July 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the film was in development before Kennedy's death, director [[George Miller (director)|George Miller]] was hesitant to continue without his producing partner. "I was reluctant to go ahead," said Miller. "And then there was a sort of need to – let's do something just to get over the shock and grief of all of that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Byrnes|first1=Paul|title=Filmmaker Interviews: George Miller on ASO|url=http://aso.gov.au/people/George_Miller_1/interview/|website=[[Australian Screen Online]]|publisher=[[National Film and Sound Archive]]|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A title card at the end of film reads: "...For Byron".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brew|first1=Simon|title=Dedications at the end of movies, and what they mean|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/movie-dedications/28196/dedications-at-the-end-of-movies-and-what-they-mean|website=Den of Geek|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|accessdate=12 May 2015|date=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller ended up co-directing the film with [[George Ogilvie]], with whom he had worked on the 1983 miniseries ''[[The Dismissal (TV miniseries)|The Dismissal]]''. "I had a lot on my plate," said Miller. "I asked my friend George Ogilvie, who was working on the mini-series, 'Could you come and help me?' But I don't remember the experience because I was doing it to just... You know, I was grieving."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bibbiani|first1=William|title=SXSW 2015 Interview: George Miller on Mad Max, ‘Fury Road’ and the Apocalypse|url=http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/film/interviews/837957-sxsw-2015-interview-george-miller-on-mad-max-fury-road-and-the-apocalypse/4|website=[[CraveOnline]]|publisher=Evolve Media|accessdate=13 May 2015|page=4|date=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, Miller and Ogilvie used a group workshopping rehearsal technique that they had developed.&lt;ref name="stratton2"&gt;David Stratton, ''The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry'', Pan MacMillan, 1990 p85-87&lt;/ref&gt;

Exterior location filming took place primarily in the mining town of [[Coober Pedy]], with the set for Bartertown built at an old brickworks (the [[State Brickworks Homebush Bay|Brickpit]]) at [[Homebush Bay]] in Sydney's western suburbs and the children's camp shot at the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]].&lt;ref name="stratton2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Few Days On The Set of Mad Max III Beyond Thunder Dome|journal=[[Starlog]]|date=June 1985|issue=95|url=http://www.lofficier.com/madmax.htm|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome'' proved far more challenging than ''[[Mad Max 2|The Road Warrior]]''," said cinematographer [[Dean Semler]]. "We were dealing with more varied environments than before and it was essential that each of the worlds created for the film have a distinctly different look."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edwards|first1=Phil|title=Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome|journal=American Cinematographer|date=September 1985|volume=66|issue=9|url=https://www.questia.com/magazine/1P3-1298102351/mad-max-beyond-thunderdome}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{main|Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (soundtrack)}}
The [[film score|musical score]] for ''Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome'' was composed by [[Maurice Jarre]], replacing [[Brian May (composer)|Brian May]], who composed the music for the previous two films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Billson|first1=Anne|title=George Miller Talks About mad Max, Heroes &amp; Tina Turner: The 1985 Interview|url=http://multiglom.com/2015/05/12/george-miller-the-1985-interview/|website=Multiglom|publisher=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|accessdate=19 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519223326/http://multiglom.com/2015/05/12/george-miller-the-1985-interview/|archivedate=19 May 2015|date=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also contains two songs performed by [[Tina Turner]], "[[We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)]]" and "[[One of the Living]]", with the latter replacing Jarre's opening titles music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Filmtracks: Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (Maurice Jarre)|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/mad_max3.html|website=[[Filmtracks.com]]|accessdate=12 May 2015|date=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A soundtrack album was originally released by [[Capitol Records]] in 1985. It includes Turner's "We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)", which reached #1 in Canada, #2 in the US and #3 in the British single charts; it plays over the end credits. "One of the Living" was rerecorded for single release, and reached #15 in both Canada and the US, but only #55 in Britain.  The song also won a Grammy for Best Rock Vocal. A double CD containing only Jarre's original music was issued in 2010 on Tadlow Music/Silva Screen Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome|url=http://www.tadlowmusic.com/2010/11/mad-max-beyond-thunderdome/|website=Tadlow Music|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
Although the film's budget was more extravagant than its predecessors', its box office yield was only moderate in comparison.&lt;ref name="stratton2"/&gt; ''Beyond Thunderdome'' grossed A$4,272,802 at the box office in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Films at the Australian Box Office|url=http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf|website=[[Film Victoria]]|accessdate=13 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723234802/http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf|archivedate=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
Critical reaction to the film was generally positive, although reviewers disagreed as to whether they considered the film the highest or lowest point of the ''Mad Max'' trilogy. Most of the criticism focused on the children in the second half of the film, whom many found too similar to the [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)|Lost Boys]] from the story of [[Peter Pan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mad_max_beyond_thunderdome/?critic=columns|title=Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert C. Cumbow of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' identifies "whole ideas, themes and characterizations" adopted from ''[[Riddley Walker]]'', a 1980 post-apocalyptic novel by [[Russell Hoban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/article/summer-of-85-we-dont-need-another-hero-mad-max-beyond-thunderdome|title=''Summer of '85: We Don't Need Another Hero: Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome''|publisher=Slant Magazine |date=19 June 2010|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, critics praised the Thunderdome scene in particular; film critic [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' called the Thunderdome "the first really original movie idea about how to stage a fight since we got the first karate movies" and praised the fight between Max and Blaster as "one of the great creative action scenes in the movies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19850710/REVIEWS/507100301/1023 | work= Chicago Sun-Times | title= Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert awarded the film 4 stars out of 4 and later placed the film on his list of the 10 best pictures of 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140113224948/http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/eberts-10-best-lists-1967-present Ebert's 10 Best Lists: 1967-present] via the [[Internet Archive]].

===Legacy===
{{main|Mad Max series legacy and influence in popular culture}}

As with the previous installments of the ''Mad Max'' series, ''Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome'' has influenced popular culture in various regards. The term "[[thunderdome (disambiguation)|thunderdome]]" is now used in various contexts in which its meaning is similar to the sense in which it appears in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Henry |last= McCusker |title= "Thunderdome" is a euphemism for a contest where the loser suffers harsh consequences|url=http://www.regmedinvestors.com/articles/thunderdome-euphemism-contest-where-loser-suffers-harsh-consequences |website= Regenerative Medicine Investors |publisher= Scimitar Equity |location= Hopkinton, MA |date= October 14, 2013 |accessdate= May 13, 2015 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150513163228/http://www.regmedinvestors.com/articles/thunderdome-euphemism-contest-where-loser-suffers-harsh-consequences |archivedate= 13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, a contest where the loser suffers a great hardship, though it has also come to mean, more generically, the state of the world following a nuclear apocalypse, or any place where chaos is the norm. Filmmaker [[Chris Weitz]] has cited the film as an influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Robert |last= Saucedo |title= Meet Chris Weitz, director of ABOUT A BOY and AMERICAN PIE, this weekend at Vintage Park! |url= https://drafthouse.com/news/meet-chris-weitz-director-of-about-a-boy-and-american-pie-this-weekend-at-v |website= [[Alamo Drafthouse Cinema]] |date= August 1, 2014 |accessdate= June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3020">'''Mark Benson''' (born '''Mark Müller''') was a [[Bohemian Germans|Bohemian German]] engineer, best known as the inventor of a [[Supercritical steam generator|supercritical boiler]].

Benson was born in the [[Sudetenland]], and his original name  was Müller (he changed his name during [[World War I]] to hide his German origin). He emigrated to the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Sadik Kakaç: ''Boilers, Evaporators, and Condensers'', Wiley-IEEE, 1991, {{ISBN|978-0-471-62170-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; then returned to Europe to work for the [[English Electric|English Electric Company]] in [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.babcock.com/library/pdf/br-1658.pdf J.W.

In 1924, [[Siemens-Schuckert|Siemens]] acquired the right to use Benson's patent, and in 1926–27 built the first large Benson boiler in [[Berlin]]-Gartenfeld.&lt;ref name="siemens"/&gt; Siemens improved the technology and developed it as an internationally acknowledged standard for large steam generators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy.siemens.com/hq/pool/hq/power-generation/power-plants/steam-power-plant-solutions/benson%20boiler/The_Benson_Boiler_Turns_75.pdf Joachim Franke: ''The Benson Boiler Turns 75'', Siemens Power Journal Online, Mai 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1933 (until today) Siemens do not manufacture their own Benson boilers any more, but instead license the technology to others.

After his patent, Mark Benson did not make any further public appearances, but Siemens continued to use ''Benson'' as a registered trademark for this successful type of boiler, so the name is renowned worldwide in boiler engineering, although relatively little is known about the inventor behind it.

}}

The '''nominal power''' is the [[nameplate capacity]] of [[photovoltaic]] (PV) devices, such as [[solar cell]]s, [[solar module|panels]] and [[PV system|systems]], and is determined by measuring  the [[electric current]] and [[voltage]] in a [[electric circuit|circuit]], while varying the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] under precisely defined conditions. These ''Standard Test Conditions'' (STC) are specified in standards such as IEC 61215, IEC 61646 and UL 1703; specifically the light intensity is 1000&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a spectrum similar to [[sunlight]] hitting the earth's surface at latitude 35°N in the summer ([[airmass]]&amp;nbsp;1.5), the temperature of the cells being 25&amp;nbsp;°C.  The power is measured while varying the resistive load on the module between an open and closed circuit (between maximum and minimum resistance).  The highest power thus measured is the 'nominal' power of the module in [[watt]]s.  This nominal power divided by the light power that falls on a given area of a photovoltaic device (area × 1000&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) defines its [[Solar cell efficiency|efficiency]], the ratio of the device's electrical output to the incident energy.

The nominal power is important for designing an installation in order to correctly dimension its [[Solar cable|cabling]] and [[Solar inverter|converters]]. If the available area is limited the solar cell efficiency and with it the nominal power per area (e.g. kW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is also relevant. For comparing modules, the price per nominal power (e.g. $/W) is relevant. For a given installation's physical orientation and location the expected annual production (e.g. kWh) per annual production assuming nominal power i.e. the [[capacity factor]] is important. With a projected capacity factor the price per projected annual production (e.g. $/kWh) can be estimated for a given installation. Finally, with a projected value of the production, the [[amortization]] of the cost of an installation can be estimated.&lt;ref name="confusion-watt-peak"&gt;[http://www.photovoltaikbuero.de/pv-know-how-blog/die-verwirrung-um-das-watt-peak/ Die Verwirrung um das Watt-Peak], The confusion around watt-peak, 14 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The peak power is not the same as the power under actual radiation conditions. In practice, this will be approximately 15-20% lower due to the considerable heating of the solar cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = What does kilowatt peak (kWp) actually mean?|url = http://www.solar-is-future.com/faq-glossary/faq/photovoltaic-technology-and-how-it-works/what-does-kilowatt-peak-kwp-actually-mean/|accessdate = 11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover, in installations where electricity is converted to [[alternating current|AC]], such as solar power plants, the actual total electricity generation capacity is limited by the [[inverter]], which is usually sized at a lower peak capacity than the solar system for economic reasons. Since the peak [[direct current|DC]] power is reached only for a few hours each year, using a smaller inverter allows to save money on the inverter while [[Clipping (signal processing)|clipping]] (wasting) only a very small portion of the total energy production. The capacity of the power plant after DC-AC conversion is usually reported in W&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt; as opposed to W&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; or W&lt;sub&gt;DC&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Watt-peak ==
The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]], which maintains the [[International System of Units|SI-standard]], states that the [[physical unit]] and its symbol should not be used to provide specific information about a given [[physical quantity]] and that neither should be the sole source of information on a quantity.&lt;ref&gt;{{SIBrochure8th|page= 132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, colloquial English sometimes conflates the quantity power and its unit by using the non-SI unit '''watt-peak''' and the non-SI symbol W&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; prefixed as within the SI, e.g. '''kilowatt-peak''' (kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;), '''megawatt-peak''' (MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;), etc. As such a photovoltaic installation may for example be described as having "one kilowatt-peak" in the meaning "one kilowatt of peak power". Similarly outside the SI, the peak power is sometimes written as "P = 1&amp;nbsp;kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;" as opposed to "P&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt; = 1&amp;nbsp;kW". In the context of domestic PV installations, the kilowatt (kW) is the most common unit for peak power, sometimes stated as kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What does kilowatt peak (kWp) actually mean?|url= http://www.solar-is-future.com/faq-glossary/faq/photovoltaic-technology-and-how-it-works/what-does-kilowatt-peak-kwp-actually-mean/|website= solar-is-future.com |year= 2011 | accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Power output in real conditions ==
The output of [[photovoltaic system]]s varies with the intensity of sunshine and other conditions. The more sun, the more power the [[PV module]] will generate.  Losses, compared to performance in optimal conditions, will occur due to non-ideal alignment of the module in tilt and/or azimuth, higher temperature, module power mismatch (since panels in a system are connected in series the lowest performing module defines performance of the string it belongs to), soiling and DC to AC conversion.  The power a module generates in real conditions can exceed the nominal power when the intensity of sunlight exceeds 1000&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (which corresponds roughly to midday in summer in, for example, Germany), or when sun irradiation close to 1000&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; happens at lower temperatures.

=== {{anchor|Watt-peak AC}} Conversion from DC to AC ===

Most countries refer to installed nominal [[nameplate capacity]] of PV systems and panels by counting [[Direct current|DC]] power in watt-peak, denoted as W&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref name=epia-2014&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes W&lt;sub&gt;DC&lt;/sub&gt;, as do most manufacturers and organizations of the photovoltaic industry, such as [[Solar Energy Industries Association|SEIA]], [[European Photovoltaic Industry Association|SPE]] or the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]]-[[IEA-PVPS|PVPS]].

However, in some places of the world, a system's rated capacity is given after the power output has been converted to [[Alternating current|AC]]. These places include Canada, Japan (since 2012), Spain, and some parts of the United States. AC instead of DC is also given for most utility-scale PV power plants using [[Cadmium telluride photovoltaics|CdTe]]-technology. The major difference lies in the small percentage (about 5%, according to the IEA-PVPS) of energy lost during the DC-AC conversion. In addition, some grid regulations may limit the output of a PV system to as little as 70% of its nominal DC power (Germany). In such cases, the difference between nominal peak-power and converted AC output can therefore amount to as much as 30%. Because of these two different metrics, international organizations need to reconvert official domestic figures from the above-mentioned countries back to the raw DC output, in order to report coherent global PV-deployment in watt-peak.&lt;ref name="iea-pvps-snapshot-1992-2014"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to clarify whether the nominal power output (''"watt-peak"'', W&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) is in fact DC or already converted into AC, it is sometimes explicitly denoted as, for example, MW&lt;sub&gt;DC&lt;/sub&gt; and MW&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt; or kW&lt;sub&gt;DC&lt;/sub&gt; and kW&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;. The converted W&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt; is also often written as "MW (AC)", "MWac" or "MWAC". Just as for W&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, these units are non [[SI]]-compliant but widely used. In California, for example, where the rated capacity is given in MW&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;, a loss of 15 percent in the conversion from DC to AC is assumed.&lt;ref name=Gipe-DC-AC-conversion&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gipe|first1=Paul|title=Solar PV DC Conversion Factor for AC kW|url=http://www.wind-works.org/cms/index.php?id=38&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=208&amp;cHash=bebbcb4dacd986e38d771a9bd496bdfb|website=https://www.webcitation.org|publisher=Wind-works|accessdate=4 September 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SLA3c7xv?url=http://www.wind-works.org/cms/index.php?id=38&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=208&amp;cHash=bebbcb4dacd986e38d771a9bd496bdfb|archivedate=4 September 2014|date=20 November 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be extremely confusing not only to non-experts, as the conversion efficiency has been improving to nearly 98 percent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recent Facts about Photovoltaics in Germany|url=http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/publications/veroeffentlichungen-pdf-dateien-en/studien-und-konzeptpapiere/recent-facts-about-photovoltaics-in-germany.pdf|website=http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en|accessdate=4 September 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SLCNRPTc?url=http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/publications/veroeffentlichungen-pdf-dateien-en/studien-und-konzeptpapiere/recent-facts-about-photovoltaics-in-germany.pdf|archivedate=4 September 2014|page=44|date=28 July 2014|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; grid regulations may change, some manufactures may differ from the rest of the industry, and countries, such as Japan, may adopt a different metric from one year to the other.

== Cost-per-watt ==
Although watt-peak is a convenient measure, and is the standardized number in the [[photovoltaic]] industry on which prices, sales and growth numbers are based, it is arguably not the most important number for actual performance. Since a solar panel's job is to generate electric power at minimal cost, the amount of power that it generates under real-life conditions in relation to its cost should be the most important number to evaluate. This "[[cost-per-watt]]" measure is widely used in the industry.

It can happen that a panel from brand&amp;nbsp;A and a panel of brand&amp;nbsp;B give exactly the same watt-peak in laboratory test, but their power output is different in a real installation. This difference can be caused by different degradation rates at higher temperatures.  At the same time, though brand&amp;nbsp;A can be less productive than brand&amp;nbsp;B it may as well cost less, thus it has a potential of becoming financially advantageous. An alternative scenario can also be true: a more expensive panel may produce so much more power that it will outperform a cheaper panel financially. An accurate analysis of long-term performance versus cost, both initial and on-going, is required to determine which panel may lead the owner to better financial results.

[[File:CIIC 504.gif|thumb|150px|Ogham stone [[CIIC 504]] from the Isle of Man showing the ''droim'' in centre. Text reads BIVAIDONAS MAQI MUCOI CUNAVA[LI], or in English of Bivaidonas, son of the tribe Cunava[li] ]]

Roughly 400 known '''[[ogham]] inscriptions''' are on stone monuments scattered around the [[Irish Sea]], the bulk of them dating to the fifth and sixth centuries. Their language is predominantly [[Primitive Irish]], but a few examples record fragments of the [[Pictish language]]. Ogham itself is an Early Medieval form of alphabet or cipher, sometimes known as the "Celtic Tree Alphabet".

A number of different numbering schemes are used. The most widespread is '''CIIC''', after [[R. A. Stewart Macalister|R. A. S. Macalister]]. This covers the inscriptions known by the 1940s. Another numbering scheme is that of the Celtic Inscribed Stones Project, '''CISP''', based on the location of the stones; for example CIIC 1 = CISP INCHA/1. Macalister's (1945) numbers run from 1 to 507, including also Latin and Runic inscriptions, with three additional added in 1949. Ziegler lists 344 Gaelic ogham inscriptions known to Macalister (Ireland and Isle of Man), and seven additional inscriptions discovered later.

The inscriptions may be divided into "orthodox" and "scholastic" specimens. "Orthodox" inscriptions date to the Primitive Irish period, and record a name of an individual, either as a cenotaph or tombstone, or documenting land ownership. "Scholastic" inscriptions date from the medieval [[Old Irish]] period up to modern times.

The vast bulk of the surviving ogham inscriptions stretch in arc from [[County Kerry]] (especially [[Corcu Duibne]]) in the south of Ireland across to [[Dyfed]] in south Wales. The remainder are mostly in south-eastern Ireland, eastern and northern Scotland, the [[Isle of Man]], and England around the [[Devon]]/[[Cornwall]] border. The vast majority of the inscriptions consists of personal names, probably of the person commemorated by the monument.

==Orthodox inscriptions==
{{Table Oghamletters}}
In orthodox inscriptions, the script was carved into the edge (''droim'' or ''faobhar'') of the stone, which formed the stemline against which individual characters are cut. The text of these "Orthodox Ogham" inscriptions is read beginning from the bottom left side of a stone, continuing upward along the edge, across the top and down the right side (in the case of long inscriptions).

MacManus (1991) lists a total of 382 known Orthodox inscriptions. They are found in most counties of Ireland, concentrated in southern Ireland: [[County Kerry]] (130), [[County Cork|Cork]] (84), [[County Waterford|Waterford]] (48), [[County Kilkenny|Kilkenny]] (14), [[County Mayo|Mayo]] (9), [[County Kildare|Kildare]] (8), [[County Wicklow|Wicklow]] and [[County Meath|Meath]] (5 each), [[County Carlow|Carlow]] (4), [[County Wexford|Wexford]], [[County Limerick|Limerick]], [[County Roscommon|Roscommon]] (3 each), [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Cavan|Cavan]], [[County Louth|Louth]], [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] (2 each), [[County Armagh|Armagh]], [[County Dublin|Dublin]], [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]], [[County Leitrim|Leitrim]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]] (1 each). Other specimens are known from [[Wales]] (ca. 40: [[Pembrokeshire]] (16), [[Breconshire]] and [[Carmarthenshire]] (7 each), [[Glamorgan]] (4), [[Ceredigion|Cardiganshire]] (3), [[Denbighshire]] (2), [[Powys]] (1), and [[Caernarvonshire]] (1)), from England ([[Cornwall]] (5) [[Devon]] (2), elsewhere (1?)); the [[Isle of Man]] (5), and with some doubtful examples from Scotland (2?)

===Formula words===
The vast majority of inscriptions consists of personal names and they use a series of formula words, usually describing the person's ancestry or tribal affiliation. The formula words used are MAQI {{script|Ogam|ᚋᚐᚊᚔ}} – 'son' (Modern Irish ''mic''); MUCOI {{script|Ogam|ᚋᚒᚉᚑᚔ}} – 'tribe' or 'sept'; ANM {{script|Ogam|ᚐᚅᚋ}} – 'name' (Modern Irish ''ainm''); AVI {{script|Ogam|ᚐᚃᚔ}} – 'descendant' (Modern Irish ''uí''); CELI {{script|Ogam|ᚉᚓᚂᚔ}} – 'follower' or 'devotee' (Modern Irish ''céile''); NETA {{script|Ogam|ᚅᚓᚈᚐ}} – 'nephew' (Modern Irish ''nia''); KOI {{script|Ogam|ᚕᚑᚔ}} – 'here is' (equivalent to Latin HIC IACIT). KOI is unusual in that the K is always written using the first supplementary letter ''Ebad''. In order of frequency the formula words are used as follows:

* X MAQI Y               (X son of Y)
* X MAQI MUCOI Y         (X son of the tribe Y)
* X MAQI Y MUCOI Z       (X son of Y of the tribe Z)
* X KOI MAQI MUCOI Y     (here is X son of the tribe Y)
* X MUCOI Y               (X of the tribe Y)
* X MAQI Y MAQI MUCOI Z (X son of Y son of the tribe Z)
* Single name inscriptions with no accompanying formula word
* ANM X MAQI Y           (Name X son of Y)
* ANM X                   (Name X )
* X AVI Y                 (X descendant of Y)
* X MAQI Y AVI Z         (X son of Y descendant of Z)
* X CELI Y                (X follower/devotee of Y)
* NETTA X                 (nephew/champion of X)

===Nomenclature===
The nomenclature of the Irish personal names is more interesting than the rather repetitive formulae and reveals details of early Gaelic society, particularly its warlike nature. For example, two of the most commonly occurring elements in the names are CUNA {{script|Ogam|ᚉᚒᚅᚐ}} – 'hound' or 'wolf' (Modern Irish ''cú'') and CATTU {{script|Ogam|ᚉᚐᚈᚈᚒ}} – 'battle' (Modern Irish ''cath''). These occur in names such as (300) CUNANETAS {{script|Ogam|ᚉᚒᚅᚐᚅᚓᚈᚐᚄ}} – 'Champion of wolves'; (501) CUNAMAGLI {{script|Ogam|ᚉᚒᚅᚐᚋᚐᚌᚂᚔ}} – 'prince of wolves'; (107) CUNAGUSSOS – '(he who is) strong as a wolf'; (250) CATTUVVIRR {{script|Ogam|ᚉᚐᚈᚈᚒᚃᚃᚔᚏᚏ}} – 'man of battle'; (303) CATABAR {{script|Ogam|ᚉᚐᚈᚐᚁᚐᚏ}} – 'chief in battle'; IVACATTOS {{script|Ogam|ᚔᚃᚐᚉᚐᚈᚈᚑᚄ}} – 'yew of battle'. Other warlike names include (39) BRANOGENI {{script|Ogam|ᚁᚏᚐᚅᚑᚌᚓᚅᚔ}} – 'born of raven'; (428) TRENAGUSU {{script|Ogam|ᚈᚏᚓᚅᚐᚌᚒᚄᚒ}} – 'strong of vigour'; and (504) BIVAIDONAS {{script|Ogam|ᚁᚔᚃᚐᚔᚇᚑᚅᚐᚄ}} – 'alive like fire'. Elements that are descriptive of physical characteristics are also common, such as (368) VENDUBARI {{script|Ogam|ᚃᚓᚅᚇᚒᚁᚐᚏᚔ}} – 'fair-headed'; (75) CASONI {{script|Ogam|ᚉᚐᚄᚑᚅᚔ}} – 'curly headed one'; (119) DALAGNI {{script|Ogam|ᚇᚐᚂᚐᚌᚅᚔ}} – 'one who is blind'; (46) DERCMASOC {{script|Ogam|ᚇᚓᚏᚉᚋᚐᚄᚑᚉ}} – 'one with an elegant eye'; (60) MAILAGNI {{script|Ogam|ᚋᚐᚔᚂᚐᚌᚅᚔ}} – 'bald/short haired one' and (239) GATTAGLAN {{script|Ogam|ᚌᚐᚈᚈᚐᚌᚂᚐᚅ}} – 'wise and pure'.

Other names indicate a divine ancestor. The god [[Lugh]] features in many names such as (4) LUGADDON {{script|Ogam|ᚂᚒᚌᚌᚐᚇᚑᚅ}}, (286) LUGUDECA {{script|Ogam|ᚂᚒᚌᚒᚇᚓᚉᚐ}} and (140) LUGAVVECCA {{script|Ogam|ᚂᚒᚌᚐᚃᚃᚓᚉᚉᚐ}}, while the divine name ERC (meaning either 'heaven or 'cow') appears in names such as (93) ERCAIDANA {{script|Ogam|ᚓᚏᚉᚐᚔᚇᚐᚅᚐ}} and (196) ERCAVICCAS {{script|Ogam|ᚓᚏᚉᚐᚃᚔᚉᚉᚐᚄ}} . Other names indicate sept or tribal name, such as (156) DOVVINIAS {{script|Ogam|ᚇᚑᚃᚃᚔᚅᚔᚐᚄ}} from the ''Corcu Duibne'' sept of the Dingle and Iveragh peninsulas in Co. Kerry (named after a local goddess); (215) ALLATO {{script|Ogam|ᚐᚂᚂᚐᚈᚑ}} from the ''Altraige'' of North Kerry and (106) CORIBIRI {{script|Ogam|ᚉᚑᚏᚔᚁᚔᚏᚔ}} from the ''Dál Coirpri'' of Co. Cork. Finally of particular interest is the fact that quite a few names denote a relationship to trees, names like (230) MAQI-CARATTINN {{script|Ogam|ᚋᚐᚊᚔ ᚉᚐᚏᚐᚈᚈᚔᚅᚅ}} – 'son of rowan'; (v) MAQVI QOLI {{script|Ogam|ᚋᚐᚊᚃᚔ ᚊᚑᚂᚔ}} – 'son of hazel' and (259) IVOGENI {{script|Ogam|ᚔᚃᚑᚌᚓᚅᚔ}} – 'born of yew'.

The content of the inscriptions has led scholars such as McNeill and Macalister to argue that they are explicitly pagan in nature. They argue that the inscriptions were later defaced by Christian converts, who deliberately attacked them by removing the word MUCOI {{script|Ogam|ᚋᚒᚉᚑᚔ}} on account of its supposedly tribal, pagan associations, and adding crosses next to them to Christianize them. Other scholars, such as McManus argue that there is no evidence for this, citing inscriptions such as (145) QRIMITIR RONANN MAQ COMOGANN {{script|Ogam|᚛ᚊᚏᚔᚋᚔᚈᚔᚏ ᚏᚑᚅᚐᚅᚅ ᚋᚐᚊ ᚉᚑᚋᚑᚌᚐᚅᚅ᚜}}, where QRIMITIR is a loan word from Latin ''presbyter'' or 'priest'. McManus argues that the supposed vandalism of the inscriptions is simply wear and tear, and due to the inscription stones being reused as building material for walls, lintels, etc. (McManus, §4.9). McManus also argues that the MUCOI formula word survived into Christian manuscript usage. There is also the fact the inscriptions were made at a time when Christianity had become firmly established in Ireland. Whether those who wrote the inscriptions were pagans, Christians, or a mixture of both remains unclear.

===Ireland===
Ireland has the vast majority of inscriptions, with 330 out of 382. One of the most important collections of orthodox ogham inscriptions in Ireland can be seen in [[University College Cork]] (UCC) on public display in 'The Stone Corridor'. The inscriptions were 
collected by antiquarian [[Abraham Abell]] 1783–1851 and were deposited in the Cork Institution before being put on display in UCC. He was a member of the [[Cuvierian Society]] of Cork whose members, including [[John Windele]], Fr. Matt Horgan and R.R. Brash, did extensive work in this area in the mid-19th century. Another well-known group of inscriptions can be seen at Dunloe, near [[Killarney]] in Co. Kerry. The inscriptions are arranged in a semicircle at the side of the road and are very well preserved.

===Wales===
[[File:Ogham.Inscriptions.Wales.jpg|frameless|right|240px]]
The orthodox inscriptions in Wales are noted for containing names of a Latin origin and some names in [[Common_Brittonic|Brythonic]] (or early Welsh), and are mostly accompanied by a Latin inscription in the Roman alphabet. Examples of Brythonic names include (446) MAGLOCUNI {{script|Ogam|ᚋᚐᚌᚂᚑᚉᚒᚅᚔ}} (Welsh ''Maelgwn'') and (449) CUNOTAMI {{script|Ogam|ᚉᚒᚅᚑᚈᚐᚋᚔ}} (Welsh ''cyndaf'').  Wales has the distinction of the only ogham stone inscription that bears the name of an identifiable individual. The stone commemorates [[Vortiporius]], a 6th-century king of [[Dyfed]] (originally located in [[Clynderwen]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davies |first=John |title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales |publisher=[[University of Wales Press]] |location=Cardiff |year=2008 |isbn=0-7083-1953-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wales also has the only ogham inscription known to commemorate a woman. At [[Eglwyscummin|Eglwys Cymmin]] (Cymmin church) in Carmarthenshire is the inscription (362) AVITORIGES INIGENA CUNIGNI {{script|Ogam|᚛ᚐᚃᚔᚈᚑᚏᚔᚌᚓᚄ ᚔᚅᚔᚌᚓᚅᚐ ᚉᚒᚅᚔᚌᚅᚔ᚜}} or 'Avitoriges daughter of Cunigni'. Avitoriges is an Irish name while Cunigni is Brythonic (Welsh ''Cynin''), reflecting the mixed heritage of the inscription makers. Wales also has several inscriptions which attempt to replicate the supplementary letter or [[forfeda]] for P (inscriptions 327 and 409).    &lt;!--Inscriptions in Wales begin at CIIC 319, most of them in Latin--&gt;

===England, Isle of Man, Scotland===
[[File:Ogham.Inscriptions.Cornwall.jpg|frameless|right|240px]]
England has seven or eight ogham inscriptions, five in Cornwall and two in Devon, which are the product of early Irish settlement in the area. A further inscription in Silchester in Hampshire is presumed to be the work of a lone Irish settler. Perhaps surprisingly, Scotland has only three orthodox inscriptions, as the rest are scholastic inscriptions made by the Picts (see below). The Isle of Man has five inscriptions. One of these is the famous inscription at Port St. Mary (503) which reads DOVAIDONA MAQI DROATA {{script|Ogam|᚛ᚇᚑᚃᚐᚔᚇᚑᚅᚐ ᚋᚐᚊᚔ ᚇᚏᚑᚐᚈᚐ᚜}} or 'Dovaidona son of the Druid'.

==Scholastic inscriptions==
&lt;!-- [[File:OrkneyOgham.jpg|thumb|The [[Buckquoy spindle-whorl]], containing a 8th century scholastic ogham inscription written in [[Old Irish language|Old Gaelic]].]] --&gt;
The term 'scholastic' derives from the fact that the inscriptions are believed to have been inspired by the manuscript sources, instead of being continuations of the original monument tradition. Scholastic inscriptions typically draw a line into the stone's surface along which the letters are arranged, rather than using the stone's edge. They begin in the course of the 6th century, and continue into Old and Middle Irish, and even into Modern times. From the High Middle Ages, contemporary to the Manuscript tradition, they may contain [[Forfeda]]. The 30 or so Pictish inscriptions qualify as early Scholastic, roughly 6th to 9th century. Some [[Viking Age]] stones on Man and Shetland are in [[Old Norse]], or at least contain Norse names.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to tropical cyclones:

'''[[Tropical cyclone]]''' &amp;ndash; [[storm|storm system]] characterized by a large [[low pressure system|low-pressure]] center and numerous [[thunderstorms]] that produce strong winds and heavy rain. Tropical [[cyclone]]s strengthen when water evaporated from the ocean is released as the saturated [[air]] rises, resulting in [[condensation]] of [[water vapor]] contained in the moist air. They are fueled by a different heat mechanism than other cyclonic windstorms such as [[nor'easter]]s, [[European windstorm]]s, and [[polar low]]s. The characteristic that separates tropical cyclones from other cyclonic systems is that at any height in the atmosphere, the center of a tropical cyclone will be warmer than its surroundings; a phenomenon called "[[warm core]]" storm systems.

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Nature of tropical cyclones==

Tropical cyclones can be described as all of the following:
* [[Storm]] &amp;ndash; disturbed state of an environment or astronomical body's atmosphere especially affecting its surface, and strongly implying severe weather. It may be marked by significant disruptions to normal conditions such as strong wind, hail, thunder and lightning (a thunderstorm), heavy precipitation (snowstorm, rainstorm), heavy freezing rain (ice storm), strong winds (tropical cyclone, windstorm), or wind transporting some substance through the atmosphere such as sand or debris.
* [[Natural disaster]] &amp;ndash; major adverse event resulting from natural processes of the Earth; examples include floods, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, and other geologic processes. A natural disaster can cause loss of life or property damage, and typically leaves some economic damage in its wake, the severity of which depends on the affected population's resilience, or ability to recover.

]]
In [[electrochemistry]], a '''Pourbaix diagram''', also known as a '''potential/pH diagram''', '''E&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;-pH diagram''' or a '''pE/pH diagram''', maps out possible stable ([[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]]) phases of an aqueous electrochemical system.  Predominant ion boundaries are represented by lines. As such a Pourbaix diagram can be read much like a standard [[phase diagram]] with a different set of axes. Similarly to phase diagrams, they do not allow for [[reaction rate]] or kinetic effects.

The diagrams are named after [[Marcel Pourbaix]] (1904–1998), the [[Russia]]n-born, Belgian [[Chemistry|chemist]] who invented them.

==Diagram==
[[Image:Uranium pourdaix diagram in water.png|thumb|right|240px|The Pourbaix diagram for uranium in a non-complexing aqueous medium (e.g. [[perchloric acid]] / sodium hydroxide).&lt;ref name="medusa"/&gt;]]
[[Image:Uranium pourdiax diagram in carbonate media.png|thumb|right|240px|The Pourbaix diagram for uranium in carbonate solution. The dashed green lines show the stability limits of water in the system.&lt;ref name="medusa"&gt;. Ignasi Puigdomenech, ''Hydra/Medusa Chemical Equilibrium Database and Plotting Software'' (2004) KTH Royal Institute of Technology, freely downloadable software at {{cite web |url=http://www.kemi.kth.se/medusa/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929153029/http://www.kemi.kth.se/medusa/ |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Pourbaix diagrams are also known as E&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;-pH diagrams due to the labeling of the two axes. The vertical axis is labeled E&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; for the [[Reduction potential|voltage potential]] with respect to the [[standard hydrogen electrode]] (SHE) as calculated by the [[Nernst equation]]. The "H" stands for hydrogen, although other standards may be used, and they are for room temperature only.
:&lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{H} = E^0 - \frac{0.0592\, \mathrm{V}}{n} \log\frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b} \ \{ V \} &lt;/math&gt;
The horizontal axis is labeled [[pH]] for the -log function of the  H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion activity. 
:&lt;math chem&gt;\ce{pH} = - \log_{10}(a_\ce{H+}) = \log_{10}\left(\frac{1}{a_\ce{H+}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The lines in the Pourbaix diagram show the equilibrium conditions, that is, where the activities are equal, for the species on each side of that line. On either side of the line, one form of the species will instead be said to be predominant.&lt;ref name="Environmental Chemistry (vanLoon)" /&gt;

In order to draw the position of the lines with the Nernst equation, the activity of the chemical species at equilibrium must be defined. Usually, the activity of a species is approximated as equal to the concentration (for soluble species) or partial pressure (for gases). The same values should be used for all species present in the system.&lt;ref name="Environmental Chemistry (vanLoon)" /&gt;

For soluble species, the lines are often drawn for concentrations of 1 M or 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; M. Sometimes additional lines are drawn for other concentrations.

If the diagram involves the equilibrium between a dissolved species and a gas, the pressure is usually set to P&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 atm = 101,325 Pa, the minimum pressure required for gas evolution from an aqueous solution at standard conditions.&lt;ref name="Environmental Chemistry (vanLoon)" /&gt;

While such diagrams can be drawn for any chemical system, it is important to note that the addition of a metal binding agent ([[ligand]]) will often modify the diagram. For instance, [[carbonate]] has a great effect upon the diagram for uranium. (See diagrams at right.) The presence of trace amounts of certain species such as chloride ions can also greatly affect the stability of certain species by destroying passivating layers.

In addition, changes in temperature and concentration of solvated ions in solution will shift the equilibrium lines in accordance with the Nernst equation.

The diagrams also do not take kinetic effects into account, meaning that species shown as unstable might not react to any significant degree in practice.

A simplified Pourbaix diagram indicates regions of "Immunity", "Corrosion" and "Passivity", instead of the stable species. They thus give a guide to the stability of a particular metal in a specific environment. Immunity means that the metal is not attacked, while [[corrosion]] shows that general attack will occur. [[Passivation (chemistry)|Passivation]] occurs when the metal forms a stable coating of an oxide or other salt on its surface, the best example being the relative stability of [[aluminium]] because of the [[alumina]] layer formed on its surface when exposed to air.

== Calculation of a Pourbaix diagram ==

For the simple case of a thermodynamic system consisting of a metal (M) and water, various reaction equations may be written having the form:

:&lt;math chem&gt;\begin{cases}
a r_1 + b r_2 + c \ce{H2\!O(l)} + d\ce{H+(aq)} + n\ce{e^-  &lt;=&gt; 0} &amp; \text{acid balanced}\\
a r_1 + b r_2 + c \ce{H2\!O(l)} + d\ce{OH^{-}(aq)} + n\ce{e^- &lt;=&gt; 0} &amp; \text{base balanced}
\end{cases}\qquad(n &gt; 0)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are any reactants involving M, hydrogen and oxygen. The equation must be balanced for M, H, O and charge. A standard [[Gibbs free energy]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta G^\circ&lt;/math&gt; is associated with each equation. A base-balanced equation can be converted to an acid-balanced equation using the equilibrium constant for the [[self-ionization of water]], and only acid-balanced equations are considered below.

In the following, the Nernst slope {{tmath|1=\Delta=RT/F}} is used, which has a value of 0.02569... V at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|STP]]. When base-10 logarithms are used,  ∆''&amp;lambda;'' = 0.05916... V at STP where ''&amp;lambda;''=ln[10]. There are three types of line boundaries in a Pourbaix diagram: Vertical, horizontal, and sloped.&lt;ref Name="Verink"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.semos.dk/Per/41653/download/Pourbaix_basic.pdf |title=Simplified Procedure for Constructing Pourbaix Diagrams |last=Verink |first=E.D.

=== Vertical boundary line ===

When no electrons are exchanged (''n''=0), the equilibrium between ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not affected by electrode potential, and the boundary line will be a vertical line with a particular value of pH. The reaction equation may be written:

:&lt;math chem&gt;a r_1 + b r_2 + c \ce{H2\!O(l)} + d\ce{H+} + n\ce{e^-  &lt;=&gt; 0}&lt;/math&gt;

and the energy balance is written as &lt;math&gt;\Delta G^\circ = -RT \ln K&lt;/math&gt; where ''K'' is the [[equilibrium constant]]: &lt;math chem&gt;K=[r_1]^a[r_2]^b[\ce{H2\!O}]^c[\ce{H+}]^d&lt;/math&gt;. Thus:

:&lt;math chem&gt;\Delta G^\circ = -R T \ln( [r_1]^a [r_2]^b [\ce{H2\!O}]^c [\ce{H+}]^d  )&lt;/math&gt;

or, in base-10 logarithms,

:&lt;math chem&gt;\Delta G^\circ = -(R T \lambda) \, ( \log(  [r_1]^a [r_2]^b [\ce{H2\!O}]^c )  -d\,\ce{pH} )&lt;/math&gt;

which may be solved for the particular value of pH.

For example&lt;ref name="Verink"/&gt; consider the iron and water system, and the equilibrium line between the [[ferric]] ion Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion and [[hematite]] Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The reaction equation is:

:&lt;chem&gt;2 Fe^{3+}(aq) + 3 H_2 O (l) &lt;=&gt; Fe_2 O_3 (s) + 6 H^+ (aq)&lt;/chem&gt;

which has &lt;math&gt;\Delta G^\circ = -8242.5\, \mathrm{J/mol}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Verink"/&gt; The pH of the vertical line on the Pourbaix diagram is then found to be:

:&lt;math chem&gt;\ce{pH}=\frac{1}{6}\left( \frac{\Delta G^\circ}{R T \lambda} + \log\left( \frac\ce{[Fe2\!O3]}\ce{[Fe^{3+}]^2[H2\!O]^3}\right) \right) &lt;/math&gt;

At STP, for [Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;] = 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;, [Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]= [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]=1, this yields pH=1.76.

=== Horizontal boundary line  ===

When H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions are not involved, the boundary line is horizontal, independent of pH. The reaction equation is written:

:&lt;math chem&gt;a {r_1} + b {r_2} + c \ce{H2\!O(l)} + n\ce{e^- &lt;=&gt;0} \qquad (n&gt;0)&lt;/math&gt;

The energy balance is

:&lt;math chem&gt;\Delta G = \Delta G^\circ - (R T) \ln [r_1]^a[r_2]^b[\ce{H2\!O}]^c &lt;/math&gt;

Using the definition of electrode potential ∆G=-F E this may be rewritten as a Nernst equation:

:&lt;math chem&gt;E_h = {E^\circ} + \frac{\Delta}{n} \ln ([r_1]^a[r_2]^b[\ce{H2\!O}]^c) &lt;/math&gt;

or, using base-10 logarithms:

:&lt;math chem&gt;E_h = {E^\circ} + \frac{\Delta \lambda}{n} \log ([r_1]^a[r_2]^b[\ce{H2\!O}]^c )&lt;/math&gt;

For the iron and water example, consider the boundary line between Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; . The reaction equation is:

:&lt;chem&gt;Fe^3+ (aq) + e^- &lt;=&gt; Fe^2+ (aq)&lt;/chem&gt;

and since electrons are involved, it has Eo=0.771 V&lt;ref name="USWater"&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date=1962 |title=Chemistry of Iron in Natural Water |url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/wsp/1459a/report.pdf |journal=Geological Survey water-Supply Paper 1459|publisher=United States Government Printing Office|volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=2017-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and since H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  ions are not involved, it is independent of pH. As a function of temperature,

:&lt;math chem&gt;E_h = {E^\circ} + \Delta\lambda \log\left(\frac\ce{[Fe^{2+}]}\ce{[Fe^{3+}]}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

For both ionic species at &lt;math&gt;10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt; at STP, &lt;math&gt;E_h=E^\circ=0.771\, \mathrm V&lt;/math&gt; and the boundary will be a vertical line at ''E&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''=0.771. This will vary with temperature.

=== Sloped boundary line ===

In this case, both electrons and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are involved and the electrode potential is a function of pH. The reaction equation may be written:

:&lt;math chem&gt;a {r_1} + b {r_2} + c \ce{H2\!O(l)} + d \ce{H+(aq)} + n \ce{e^- &lt;=&gt; 0}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the expressions for the free energy in terms of potentials, the energy balance is given by a Nernst equation:

:&lt;math chem&gt;E_h = {E^\circ} + \frac{\Delta\lambda}{n}(  \log( [r_1]^a [r_2]^b[\ce{H2\!O}]^c ) -d\, \ce{pH})&lt;/math&gt;

For the iron and water example, consider the boundary line between the ferrous ion Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;  and hematite Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The reaction equation is found to be:

:&lt;chem&gt;{Fe2\!O3(s)} + 6{H+(aq)}  + 2e^- &lt;=&gt; {2Fe^{2+}(aq)} + {3H2\!O(l)}&lt;/chem&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;E^\circ =0.728 \mathrm V&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Verink" /&gt; The equation of the boundary line, expressed in base-10 logarithms will be:

:&lt;math chem&gt;E_h ={E^\circ} - \frac{\Delta \lambda}{2}  \left ( \log\left ( \frac\ce{[Fe^{+2}]^2[H2\!O]^3}\ce{[Fe2\!O3]} \right ) + 6 \ce{pH}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

For [Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]=[H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]=1 and [Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]=10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;, this yields ''E&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''=1.0826 - 0.1775 pH.

== The stability region of water ==

[[File:PourbaixWater.png|thumb|300px|left | Pourbaix diagram for water, including equilibrium regions for water, oxygen and hydrogen at STP. The vertical scale is the electrode potential of a hydrogen or non-interacting electrode relative to an [[Standard hydrogen electrode|SHE]] electrode, the horizontal scale is the [[pH]] of the electrolyte (otherwise non-interacting). Assuming no [[overpotential]], above the top line the equilibrium condition is oxygen gas, and oxygen will bubble off of the electrode until equilibrium is reached. Likewise, below the bottom line, the equilibrium condition is hydrogen gas, and hydrogen will bubble off of the electrode until equilibrium is reached. ]]

In many cases, the possible conditions in a system are limited by the stability region of water. In the Pourbaix diagram for uranium, the limits of stability of water are marked by the two dashed green lines, and the stability region for water falls between these lines.

Under highly reducing conditions (low E&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;/pE) water will be reduced to hydrogen according to&lt;ref name="Environmental Chemistry (vanLoon)" /&gt;

:&lt;chem&gt;2 H2O + 2e^- -&gt; H2(g) + 2 OH^- &lt;/chem&gt;

or

:&lt;chem&gt;2 H3O+ + 2e^- -&gt; H2(g) + 2H2O &lt;/chem&gt;

Using the Nernst equation, setting E&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 V and the hydrogen gas fugacity (corresponding to activity) at 1, the equation for the lower stability line of water in the Pourbaix diagram will be

:&lt;math chem&gt;E_\ce{H} = - 0.0591*\ce{pH} \ \{ V \} &lt;/math&gt;

at standard temperature and pressure. Below this line, water will be reduced to hydrogen, and it will usually not be possible to pass beyond this line as long as there is still water present to be reduced.

Correspondingly, under highly oxidizing conditions (high E&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;/pE) water will be oxidized to oxygen gas according to&lt;ref name="Environmental Chemistry (vanLoon)" /&gt;

:&lt;chem&gt;6 H2O -&gt; 4 H3O+ + O2(g) + 4e^- &lt;/chem&gt;

Using the Nernst equation as above, but with an E&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; of 1.229 V, gives an upper stability limit of water at

:&lt;math chem&gt;E_\ce{H} = 1.229 V - 0.0591*\ce{pH} \ \{ V \} &lt;/math&gt;

at standard temperature and pressure. Above this line, water will be oxidized to form oxygen gas, and it will usually not be possible to pass beyond this line as long as there is still water present to be oxidized.

== Uses ==

Pourbaix diagrams have several uses, for example in corrosion studies, geoscience and in environmental studies. Using the Pourbaix diagram correctly will help shed light not only on the nature of the species present in the solution (or sample) but may also help to understand the reaction mechanism. &lt;ref&gt;Noyhouzer T.,Bellemare-Alford D., Payne NA., Martineau E. and Mauzeroll J., Unfolding the Hidden Reactions in Galvanic Cells, Electrocatalysis 2018  [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12678-018-0459-1 DOI: 10.1007/s12678-018-0459-1]&lt;/ref&gt;
 

=== In environmental chemistry ===

Pourbaix diagrams are widely used to describe the chemical behaviour of chemical species in the hydrosphere. In these cases, [[Reduction potential|pE]] is used instead of E&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Environmental Chemistry (vanLoon)"&gt;{{cite book|last=vanLoon|first=Gary|title=Environmental Chemistry - a global perspective|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-922886-7|pages=235–248|edition=3rd|author2=Duffy, Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
pE is a dimensionless number and can easily be related to E&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; by the equation
:&lt;math&gt;pE = \frac{E_{H}}{0.0591 V}&lt;/math&gt;

pE values in environmental chemistry ranges from -12 to 25, since at low or high potentials water will be reduced or oxidized, respectively. In environmental applications, the concentration of dissolved species is usually set to a value between 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; M and 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; M for the creation of the equilibrium lines.

'''Sensors''' able to detect three-dimensional motion have been commercially available for several decades and have been used in automobiles, aircraft and ships. However, initial size, power consumption and price had prevented their mass adoption in consumer electronics. While there are other kinds of [[motion detector]] technologies available commercially, there are four principle types of motion sensors which are important for [[motion processing]] in the consumer electronics market.

== Motion Sensors ==

[[File:6ArrowChip v4 Final.png|thumb|InvenSense Motion Processing]]

=== Accelerometers ===

'''[[Accelerometers]]''' measure linear acceleration and tilt angle. Single and multi-axis accelerometers detect the combined magnitude and direction of linear, rotational and gravitational acceleration. They can be used to provide limited motion sensing functionality. For example, a device with an accelerometer can detect rotation from vertical to horizontal state in a fixed location. As a result, accelerometers are primarily used for simple motion sensing applications in consumer devices such as changing the screen of a mobile device from portrait to landscape orientation. The early generation [[Apple iPhone]] and [[Nintendo Wii]] incorporated accelerometers.

=== Gyroscopes ===

'''[[Gyroscopes]]''' measure the angular rate of rotational movement about one or more axes. Gyroscopes can measure complex motion accurately in multiple dimensions, tracking the position and rotation of a moving object unlike accelerometers which can only detect the fact that an object has moved or is moving in a particular direction. Further, unlike accelerometers and compasses, gyroscopes are not affected by errors related to external environmental factors such as gravitational and magnetic fields. Hence, gyroscopes greatly enhance the motion sensing capabilities of devices and are used for advanced motion sensing applications in consumer devices such as full gesture and movement detection and simulation in video gaming. The [[Nintendo]] [[Wii MotionPlus]] accessory and the [[Nintendo 3DS]] incorporate gyroscopes.

=== Compasses ===

Magnetic Sensors, commonly referred to as '''[[compasses]]''' detect magnetic fields and measure their absolute position relative to Earth’s magnetic north and nearby magnetic materials. Information from magnetic sensors can also be used to correct errors from other sensors such as accelerometers. One example of how compass sensors are used in consumer devices is reorienting a displayed map to match up with the general direction a user is facing.

=== Barometers ===

Pressure Sensors, also known as '''[[barometers]]''' measure relative and absolute altitude through the analysis of changing atmospheric pressure. Pressure sensors can be used in consumer devices for sports and fitness or location-based applications where information on elevation can be valuable.

In [[particle physics]], the '''quark model''' is a classification scheme for [[hadron]]s in terms of their valence [[quark]]s—the quarks and antiquarks which give rise to the [[quantum number]]s of the hadrons. The quark model  underlies [[Flavour (particle physics)|"flavor SU(3)"]], or the [[Eightfold Way (physics)|''Eightfold Way'']], the successful classification scheme organizing the large number of lighter [[hadron]]s that were being discovered starting in the 1950s and continuing through the 1960s. It received experimental verification beginning in the late 1960s and is a valid effective  classification of them to date. The quark model was independently proposed by physicists [[Murray Gell-Mann]],&lt;ref name="Gell-Man1964"&gt;

Today, the model has essentially been absorbed as a component of the established [[quantum field theory]] of strong and electroweak particle interactions, dubbed the [[Standard Model]].

Hadrons are not really "elementary", and can be regarded as bound states of their "valence quarks" and antiquarks, which give rise to the [[quantum number]]s of the hadrons. These quantum numbers are labels identifying the  hadrons, and are of two kinds. One set comes from the [[Poincaré symmetry]]—''J''&lt;sup&gt;''PC''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''J'', ''P'' and ''C'' stand for the [[total angular momentum]], [[P-symmetry]], and [[C-symmetry]], respectively.

The remaining are [[flavour quantum numbers|flavor quantum numbers]] such as the [[isospin]], [[strangeness]], [[charm (quantum number)|charm]], and so on. The strong interactions binding the quarks together are insensitive to these quantum numbers, so variation of them leads to systematic mass and coupling relationships among the hadrons in the same flavor multiplet.

All quarks are assigned a [[baryon number]] of ⅓. [[Up quark|Up]], [[charm quark|charm]] and [[top quark]]s have an [[electric charge]] of +⅔, while the [[down quark|down]], [[strange quark|strange]], and [[bottom quark]]s have an electric charge of −⅓. Antiquarks have the opposite quantum numbers. Quarks are [[spin-1/2|spin-½]] particles, and thus [[fermion]]s. Each quark or antiquark obeys the Gell-Mann−Nishijima formula individually, so any additive assembly of them will as well.

[[Meson]]s are made of a valence quark−antiquark pair (thus have a baryon number of 0), while [[baryon]]s are made of three quarks (thus have a baryon number of 1). This article discusses the quark model for the up, down, and strange flavors of quark (which form an approximate flavor [[SU(3)|SU(3) symmetry]]). There are generalizations to larger number of flavors.

==History==
Developing classification schemes for [[hadron]]s became a timely question after new experimental techniques uncovered so many of them, that it became clear that they could not all be elementary. These discoveries led [[Wolfgang Pauli]] to exclaim "Had I foreseen that, I would have gone into botany." and [[Enrico Fermi]] to advise his student [[Leon Lederman]]: "Young man, if I could remember the names of these particles, I would have been a botanist." These new schemes earned Nobel prizes for experimental particle physicists, including [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]], who was at the forefront of many of these developments. Constructing hadrons as bound states of fewer constituents would thus organize the "zoo" at hand. Several early proposals, such as the ones by [[Enrico Fermi]] and [[Chen-Ning Yang]] (1949), and the [[Sakata model]] (1956), ended up satisfactorily covering the mesons, but failed with baryons, and so were unable to explain all the data.

The [[Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula]], developed by [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Kazuhiko Nishijima]], led to the [[Eightfold Way (physics)|Eightfold way]] classification, invented by Gell-Mann, with important independent contributions from [[Yuval Ne'eman]], in 1961. The hadrons were organized into SU(3) representation multiplets, octets and decuplets, of roughly the same mass, due to the strong interactions; and smaller mass differences linked to the flavor quantum numbers, invisible to the strong interactions. The [[Gell-Mann–Okubo mass formula]] systematized the quantification of these small mass differences among members of a hadronic multiplet, controlled by the [[explicit symmetry breaking]] of SU(3).

The spin-{{frac|3|2}} [[Omega baryon|{{SubatomicParticle|Omega-}} baryon]], a member of the ground-state decuplet, was a crucial prediction of that classification. After it was discovered in an experiment at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], Gell-Mann received a [[Nobel prize in physics]] for his work on the Eightfold Way, in 1969.

Finally, in 1964, Gell-Mann, and, independently,  [[George Zweig]], discerned what the Eightfold Way picture encodes. They posited elementary fermionic constituents, unobserved, and possibly unobservable in a free form, underlying and elegantly encoding the Eightfold Way classification, in an  economical, tight structure, resulting in further simplicity. Hadronic mass differences were now linked to the different masses of the constituent quarks.

It would take about a decade for the unexpected nature—and physical reality—of these quarks to be  appreciated more fully (See [[Quarks]]).  Counter-intuitively, they cannot ever be observed in isolation ([[color confinement]]), but instead always combine with other quarks to form full hadrons, which then furnish ample indirect information on the trapped quarks themselves. Conversely, the quarks serve in the definition of [[Quantum chromodynamics]], the fundamental theory fully describing the strong interactions; and the Eightfold Way is now understood to be a consequence of the flavor symmetry structure of the lightest three of them.

==Mesons==
{{see also|Meson|List of mesons}}
[[File:Noneto mesônico de spin 0.png|thumb|'''Figure 2:''' [[Pseudoscalar]] mesons of spin 0 form a nonet ]]
[[File:Noneto mesônico de spin 1.png|thumb|'''Figure 3:''' Mesons of spin 1 form a nonet]]
The Eightfold Way classification is named after the following fact. If we take three flavors of quarks, then the quarks lie in the [[fundamental representation]], '''3''' (called the triplet) of [[flavour (particle physics)|flavor]] [[SU(3)]]. The antiquarks lie in the complex conjugate representation {{overline|'''3'''}}. The nine states (nonet) made out of a pair can be decomposed into the [[trivial representation]], '''1''' (called the singlet), and the [[Adjoint representation of a Lie group|adjoint representation]], '''8''' (called the octet). The notation for this decomposition is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{3}\otimes \mathbf{\overline{3}} = \mathbf{8} \oplus \mathbf{1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Figure 1 shows the application of this decomposition to the mesons. If the flavor symmetry were exact (as in the limit that only the strong interactions operate, but the electroweak interactions are notionally switched off), then all nine mesons would have the same mass. However, the physical content of the full theory{{clarify|date=February 2016}} includes consideration of the symmetry breaking induced by the quark mass differences, and considerations of mixing between various multiplets (such as the octet and the singlet).

N.B. Nevertheless, the mass splitting between the {{SubatomicParticle|Eta}} and the {{SubatomicParticle|Eta prime}} is larger than the quark model can accommodate, and  this "[[QCD vacuum#The η'|{{SubatomicParticle|Eta}}–{{SubatomicParticle|Eta prime}} puzzle]]" has its origin in topological peculiarities of the strong interaction vacuum, such as  [[instanton]] configurations.

Mesons are hadrons with zero [[baryon number]]. If the quark–antiquark pair are in an [[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum]] {{mvar|L}} state, and have [[spin (physics)|spin]] {{mvar|S}}, then
* |''L'' − ''S''| ≤ ''J'' ≤ ''L'' + ''S'', where ''S'' = 0 or 1,
* ''P'' = (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''L'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt;, where the 1 in the exponent arises from the [[intrinsic parity]] of the quark–antiquark pair.
* ''C'' = (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''L'' + ''S''&lt;/sup&gt; for mesons which have no [[flavour (particle physics)|flavor]]. Flavored mesons have indefinite value of [[C_parity|''C'']].
* For [[isospin]] ''I'' = 1 and 0 states, one can define a new [[multiplicative quantum number]] called the ''[[G-parity]]'' such that {{nowrap|''G'' {{=}} (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''I'' + ''L'' + ''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

If ''P'' = (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''J''&lt;/sup&gt;, then it follows that ''S'' = 1, thus ''PC''= 1. States with these quantum numbers are called ''natural parity states''; while all other quantum numbers are thus called ''exotic'' (for example the state {{nowrap|''J''&lt;sup&gt;''PC''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 0&lt;sup&gt;−−&lt;/sup&gt;}}).

==Baryons==
  {{main|Baryon}} {{see also|List of baryons}}
[[File:Baryon octet.png|thumb|200px|right|'''Figure 4'''. The ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|2}} ground state baryon octet]] [[File:Baryon decuplet.png|thumb|200px|right|'''Figure 5'''. The ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|3|2}} baryon decuplet]]

Since quarks are [[fermion]]s, the [[spin-statistics theorem]] implies that the [[wavefunction]] of a baryon must be antisymmetric under exchange of any two quarks. This antisymmetric wavefunction is obtained by making it fully antisymmetric in color, discussed below, and symmetric in flavor, spin and space put together. With three flavors, the decomposition in flavor is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{3}\otimes\mathbf{3}\otimes\mathbf{3}=\mathbf{10}_S\oplus\mathbf{8}_M\oplus\mathbf{8}_M\oplus\mathbf{1}_A&lt;/math&gt;.
The decuplet is symmetric in flavor, the singlet antisymmetric and the two octets have mixed symmetry. The space and spin parts of the states are thereby fixed once the orbital angular momentum is given.

It is sometimes useful to think of the [[quantum state#Basis states|basis states]] of quarks as the six states of three flavors and two spins per flavor. This approximate symmetry is called spin-flavor [[SU(6)]]. In terms of this, the decomposition is
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{6}\otimes\mathbf{6}\otimes\mathbf{6}=\mathbf{56}_S\oplus\mathbf{70}_M\oplus\mathbf{70}_M\oplus\mathbf{20}_A    ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The 56 states with symmetric combination of spin and flavour decompose under flavor [[SU(3)]] into
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{56}=\mathbf{10}^\frac{3}{2}\oplus\mathbf{8}^\frac{1}{2}   ~,&lt;/math&gt;
where the superscript denotes the spin, ''S'', of the baryon. Since these states are symmetric in spin and flavor, they should also be symmetric in space—a condition that is easily satisfied by making the orbital angular momentum ''L''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. These are the ground state baryons.

The ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|2}} octet baryons are the two [[nucleon]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron0}}), the three [[Sigma baryon|Sigmas]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Sigma+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Sigma0}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Sigma-}}), the two [[Xi baryon|Xis]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Xi0}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Xi-}}), and the [[Lambda baryon|Lambda]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Lambda0}}). The ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|3|2}} decuplet baryons are the four [[Delta baryon|Deltas]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Delta++}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Delta+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Delta0}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Delta-}}), three [[Sigma baryon|Sigmas]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Sigma*+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Sigma*0}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Sigma*-}}), two [[Xi baryon|Xis]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Xi*0}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Xi*-}}), and the [[Omega particle|Omega]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Omega-}}).

Mixing of baryons, mass splittings within and between multiplets, and magnetic moments are some of the other questions that the model predicts successfully.

===The discovery of color===
{{Main|Color charge}}
Color quantum numbers are the characteristic charges of the strong force, and are completely uninvolved in electroweak interactions. They were discovered as a consequence of the quark model classification, when it was  appreciated that the spin ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|3|2}} baryon, the {{SubatomicParticle|Delta++}}, required three up quarks with parallel spins and vanishing orbital angular momentum. Therefore, it could not have an antisymmetric wave function, (due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]), unless there were a hidden quantum number. [[Oscar Greenberg]] noted this problem in 1964, suggesting that quarks should be [[para-fermion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

Instead, six months later, [[Moo-Young Han]] and [[Yoichiro Nambu]] suggested the existence of three triplets of quarks to solve this problem, but flavor and color intertwined in that model--- they did not commute.&lt;ref&gt;

==States outside the quark model==
While the quark model is derivable from the theory of [[quantum chromodynamics]], the structure of hadrons is more complicated than this model allows. The full [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[wave function]] of any hadron must include virtual quark pairs as well as virtual [[gluon]]s, and allows for a variety of mixings. There may be hadrons which lie outside the quark model. Among these are the ''[[glueball]]s'' (which contain only valence gluons), ''hybrids'' (which contain valence quarks as well as gluons) and "[[exotic hadron]]s"  (such as [[tetraquark]]s or [[pentaquark]]s).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2803">[[File:Calcite, fluorine.jpg|thumb|Dogtooth spar with fluorite from the Elmwood Mine in Tennessee]]
'''Spar''' is an old mining or mineralogy term used to refer to [[crystal]]s that have readily discernible faces. A spar will easily break or [[cleavage (mineralogy)|cleave]] into [[rhomboid]]al, [[cube|cubical]], or [[laminated]] fragments with smooth shiny surfaces. 

The various spar minerals were a historical term among miners and alchemists for any nonmetallic mineral akin to [[gypsum]], known in Old English as spærstān, ''spear stone'', referring to its crystalline projections. Thus, the word spar in mineralogy has the same root as "spear," by way of comparison to gypsum, as a common natural crystal forming in spearlike projections.

Amongst [[miner]]s the term "spar" today is frequently used alone to express any bright crystalline substance.  Most frequently, spar describes easily cleaved, lightly colored  nonmetallic minerals such as [[feldspar]], [[calcite]] or [[baryte]]. Baryte ([[Barium|Ba]][[Sulfur|S]][[Oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), the main source of [[barium]], is also called "heavy spar" ([[Greek language|Greek]] "barys" means "heavy"). 
Calcite often forms the [[dogtooth spar]] crystals found in [[vug]]s and [[cave]]s.

==Formation underwater==
Generally, a spar will form underwater, either in a [[phreatic|phreatic zone]], or below the [[water table]], the essential place where most caves form, or in standing pools, as pool spar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bunnell|first=Dave|title=Pool spar|url=http://www.goodearthgraphics.com/virtcave/poolspar/poolspar.html|work=The virtual cave|accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a cave floods and a pool forms, that submerges [[Stalactite|stalactites]], a formation known as [[Bottlebrushes (Cave Formation)|bottlebrushes]] may form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bunnell|first=Dave|title=Bottlebrushes|url=http://www.goodearthgraphics.com/virtcave/bottlebr/bottlebr.html|work=The virtual cave|accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Mineral component ions in the water, mostly [[calcite]] or [[gypsum]], but sometimes even [[halite]], [[quartz]], and [[fluorite]], are deposited through the course of thousands of years, building up on each other.

==Formation in the air==

Sometimes, spar will form in the air due to [[solution]]s seeping out of the cave's walls or through porous sediments. When grown in the air, it is often made of [[gypsum]] or [[Selenite (mineral)|selenite]]. Sometimes it will form as small needles found in sediments. Others spar can be found on the tips of [[gypsum]] chandeliers.

'''Sulfur monoxide''' is an [[inorganic compound]] with [[chemical formula|formula]] {{sulfur}}{{oxygen}}. It is only found as a dilute gas phase.  When concentrated or condensed, it converts to S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[disulfur dioxide]]). It has been detected in space but is rarely encountered intact otherwise.

==Structure and bonding==
The SO molecule has a triplet ground state similar to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. each molecule has two unpaired electrons.&lt;ref name = greenwood&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; The S−O bond length of 148.1&amp;nbsp;pm is similar to that found in [[lower sulfur oxides]] (e.g. S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O, S−O = 148&amp;nbsp;pm) but is longer than the S−O bond in gaseous [[disulfur monoxide|S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] (146&amp;nbsp;pm), [[sulfur dioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] (143.1&amp;nbsp;pm) and [[sulfur trioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] (142&amp;nbsp;pm).&lt;ref name = greenwood /&gt;

The molecule is excited with near infrared radiation to the singlet state (with no unpaired electrons). The singlet state is believed to be more reactive than the ground state triplet state, in the same way that [[singlet oxygen]] is more reactive than the [[triplet oxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;''Near-Infrared-Light-Induced Reaction of Singlet SO with Allene and Dimethylacetylene in a Rare Gas Matrix. Infrared Spectra of Two Novel Episulfoxides'' Salama F; Frei H J. Phys. Chem. 1989, 93, 1285-1292&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production and reactions==
Production of SO as a reagent in organic syntheses has centred on using compounds that "extrude" SO. Examples include the decomposition of the relatively simple molecule [[thiirane|thiirane 1-oxide]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Sulfur Monoxide Chemistry. The Nature of SO from Thiirane Oxide and the Mechanism of Its Reaction with Dienes'' Chao P., Lemal D. M. Journal of the American Chemical Society 95,3: (1973) 920 {{doi|10.1021/ja00784a049}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as more complex examples, such as a trisulfide oxide, C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O,&lt;ref&gt;''A novel recyclable sulfur monoxide transfer reagent.'' Grainger RS, Procopio A, Steed JW. Org Lett. 2001 3(22), 3565-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

:C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OS  → C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + SO

The SO molecule is thermodynamically unstable, converting initially to S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name = greenwood/&gt; 
SO inserts into [[alkenes]], [[alkynes]] and [[diene]]s producing molecules with three membered rings containing sulfur.&lt;ref&gt;''[1+2] Cycloadditions of Sulfur Monoxide (SO) to Alkenes and Alkynes and [1+4]Cycloadditions to Dienes (Polyenes).

===Generation under extreme conditions===
In the laboratory sulfur monoxide can be produced by treating  sulfur dioxide with sulfur vapour in a glow discharge.&lt;ref name = greenwood /&gt; It has been detected in single bubble [[sonoluminescence]] of concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] containing some dissolved noble gas.&lt;ref&gt;''The temperatures of single-bubble sonoluminescence (A)'' Suslick K.S. and Flannigan D.J., The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America (2004) 116, 4, 2540.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[chemiluminescence]] detector for sulfur has been reported&lt;ref&gt;''Chemical Mechanism and Efficiency of the Sulfur Chemiluminescence Detector''  Benner, R. L., Stedman, D. H. Applied Spectroscopy, 48, 7, (1994), 848-851{{doi|10.1366/0003702944029901}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is based on the reactions:
:SO + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; →  SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(excited) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(excited) →  SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + hν

==Occurrence==

===Ligand for transition metals===
As a ligand SO can bond in a number different ways:&lt;ref&gt;''Sulfur: Inorganic Chemistry'' Woollins JD, Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry (1995), John Wiley and Sons {{ISBN|0-471-93620-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*a terminal ligand, with a bent M-S-O arrangement, analogous to bent nitrosyl
*bridging across 2 or 3 metal centres (via sulfur), as in Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S(SO)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;

===Astrochemistry===
Sulfur monoxide has been detected around [[Io (moon)|Io]], one of [[Jupiter]]'s moons, both in the atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;''Io’s atmosphere: Not yet understood'' Lellouch, E. 1996. Icarus 124, 1–21.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] [[torus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Detection of SO in Io's Exosphere'' Russell C.T., Kivelson M.G. Science (2000): 287, 5460, 1998–1999, {{doi|10.1126/science.287.5460.1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found in the atmosphere of Venus,&lt;ref&gt;''International Ultraviolet Explorer observations of Venus SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SO '' Na, Chan Y. ; Esposito, L.W. ; Skinner, T.E; Journal of Geophysical Research; 95 1990, 7485-7491&lt;/ref&gt; in the Hale-Bopp comet&lt;ref&gt;''New Molecular Species in Comet C/ 1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) Observed with the Caltech S submillimeter Observatory''   D. C. Lis, D. M. Mehringer, D. Benford, M. Gardner, T. G. Phillips, D. Bockelée-Morvan, N. Biver, P. Colom, J. Crovisier, D. Despois and H. Rauer Earth, Moon, and Planets Volume 78, Numbers 1-3 / July, 1997 {{doi|10.1023/A:1006281802554}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[interstellar medium]].&lt;ref&gt;''Observations of interstellar sulfur monoxide'' Gottlieb, C. A.; Gottlieb,E.W.; Litvak,M.M.; Ball,J.A.; Pennfield,H. Astrophysical Journal, 1, 219, (1978),77-94 {{doi|10.1086/155757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Io (moon)|Io]], SO is thought to be produced both by volcanic and [[photochemistry|photochemical]] routes.

Sulfur monoxide has been found in the largest star known, [[NML Cygni]].&lt;ref name="Marvel1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Marvel|title=The Circumstellar Environment of Evolved Stars As Revealed by Studies of Circumstellar Water Masers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wwx1Gj5wR5QC&amp;pg=PR182|accessdate=23 August 2012|date=19 December 1996|publisher=Universal-Publishers|isbn=978-1-58112-061-5|pages=182–212|chapter=NML Cygni}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological chemistry===
Sulfur monoxide may have some biological activity, the formation of transient SO in porcine coronary artery has been inferred from the reaction products.&lt;ref&gt;''Identification of [[carbonyl sulfide]] and [[sulfur dioxide]] in porcine coronary artery by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, possible relevance to EDHF''  Balazy M, Abu-Yousef IA, Harpp DN, Park J. Biochem Biophys Res Commun. November 21, 2003;311(3):728-34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety measures==
Because of sulfur monoxide's rare occurrence in our atmosphere and poor stability; it is difficult to fully determine its hazards. But when condensed and compacted, it forms [[disulfur dioxide]], which is relatively toxic and corrosive. This compound is also highly flammable (similar flammability to methane) and when burned produces [[sulfur dioxide]], a poisonous gas.

&lt;!-- do refs properly --&gt;

Many opportunities exist for the application of '''[[Synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[biodegradable]] [[polymer]]s''' in the [[biomedical]] area particularly in the fields of [[tissue engineering]] and controlled [[drug delivery]]. [[Chemical decomposition|Degradation]] is important in [[biomedicine]] for many reasons. Degradation of the polymeric implant means surgical intervention may not be required in order to remove the implant at the end of its functional life, eliminating the need for a second surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0032-3861(79)90009-0|title=Biodegradable polymers for use in surgery—polyglycolic/poly(actic acid) homo- and copolymers: 1|year=1979|last1=Gilding|first1=D.K.|last2=Reed|first2=A.M.|journal=Polymer|volume=20|issue=12|page=1459}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[tissue engineering]], biodegradable polymers can be designed such to approximate tissues, providing a polymer scaffold that can withstand mechanical stresses, provide a suitable surface for cell attachment and growth, and degrade at a rate that allows the load to be transferred to the new tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10332273|year=1997|last1=Pietrzak|first1=WS|last2=Verstynen|first2=ML|last3=Sarver|first3=DR|title=Bioabsorbable fixation devices: Status for the craniomaxillofacial surgeon|volume=8|issue=2|pages=92–6|journal=The Journal of craniofacial surgery|doi=10.1097/00001665-199703000-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10332272|year=1997|last1=Pietrzak|first1=WS|last2=Sarver|first2=DR|last3=Verstynen|first3=ML|title=Bioabsorbable polymer science for the practicing surgeon|volume=8|issue=2|pages=87–91|journal=The Journal of craniofacial surgery|doi=10.1097/00001665-199703000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the field of controlled drug delivery, biodegradable polymers offer tremendous potential either as a drug delivery system alone or in conjunction to functioning as a [[medical device]].&lt;ref&gt;Middleton, John C. and Tipton, Arthur J. (March 1998) [http://www.mddionline.com/article/synthetic-biodegradable-polymers-medical-devices Synthetic Biodegradable Polymers as Medical Devices], Medical Plastics and Biomaterials Magazine, Retrieved (2009-11-09)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the development of applications of biodegradable polymers, the chemistry of some polymers including synthesis and degradation is reviewed below. A description of how properties can be controlled by proper synthetic controls such as [[copolymer]] composition, special requirements for processing and handling, and some of the commercial devices based on these materials are discussed.

==Polymer chemistry and material selection==

When investigating the selection of the polymer for biomedical applications, important criteria to consider are;
 
*The mechanical properties must match the application and remain sufficiently strong until the surrounding tissue has healed.
*The degradation time must match the time required.
*It does not invoke a [[toxic]] response.
*It is [[metabolized]] in the body after fulfilling its purpose.
*It is easily processable in the final product form with an acceptable shelf life and easily [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]].&lt;!-- ref 1 --&gt;

Mechanical performance of a biodegradable polymer depends on various factors which include [[monomer]] selection, [[Radical initiator|initiator]] selection, process conditions and the presence of additives. These factors influence the polymers [[crystallinity]], melt and [[glass transition]] temperatures and [[molecular weight]]. Each of these factors needs to be assessed on how they affect the biodegradation of the polymer.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn J, and Langer R, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uzmrq7LO7loC&amp;pg=PA115 "Bioresorbable and Bioerodible Materials,"] in ''Biomaterials Science: An Introduction to Materials in Medicine'', Ratner BD (ed.), New York, Academic Press, 2004 {{ISBN|0125824637}}, pp. 115 ff&lt;/ref&gt; Biodegradation can be accomplished by synthesizing polymers with hydrolytically unstable linkages in the backbone. This is commonly achieved by the use of chemical functional groups such as [[esters]], [[anhydrides]], [[orthoesters]] and [[amide]]s. Most biodegradable polymers are synthesized by ring opening polymerization.

==Processing==

Biodegradable polymers can be melt processed by conventional means such as compression or [[injection molding]]. Special consideration must be given to the need to exclude moisture from the material. Care must be taken to dry the polymers before processing to exclude humidity. As most biodegradable polymers have been synthesized by ring opening polymerization, a thermodynamic equilibrium exists between the forward polymerization reaction and the reverse reaction that results in monomer formation. Care needs to be taken to avoid an excessively high processing temperature that may result in monomer formation during the molding and extrusion process. It must be followed carefully

==Degradation==

Once implanted, a biodegradable device should maintain its mechanical properties until it is no longer needed and then be absorbed by the body leaving no trace. The backbone of the polymer is hydrolytically unstable. That is, the polymer is unstable in a water based environment. This is the prevailing mechanism for the polymers degradation. This occurs in two stages.

1. Water penetrates the bulk of the device, attacking the chemical bonds in the amorphous phase and converting long polymer chains into shorter water-soluble fragments. This causes a reduction in molecular weight without the loss of physical properties as the polymer is still held together by the crystalline regions. Water penetrates the device leading to metabolization of the fragments and bulk [[erosion]].

2. Surface erosion of the polymer occurs when the rate at which the water penetrating the device is slower than the rate of conversion of the polymer into water-soluble materials.

Biomedical engineers can tailor a polymer to slowly degrade and transfer stress at the appropriate rate to surrounding tissues as they heal by balancing the chemical stability of the polymer backbone, the geometry of the device, and the presence of catalysts, additives or plasticisers.

==Applications==

Biodegradable polymers are used commercially in both the tissue engineering and drug delivery field of biomedicine. Specific applications include.
*[[Surgical suture|Sutures]]
*Dental devices ([[PLGA]])
*Orthopedic fixation devices
*[[Tissue engineering]] scaffolds
*Biodegradable vascular [[stents]]
*Biodegradable soft tissue anchors

'''Tin(IV) Oxide''', also known as '''stannic oxide''', is the [[inorganic compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] '''SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''. The mineral form of SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is called [[cassiterite]], and this is the main ore of [[tin]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood"&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw1st|pages=447–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; With many other names, this [[oxide]] of tin is an important material in tin chemistry. It is a colourless, [[diamagnetic]], [[amphoteric]] solid.

==Structure==
[[File:Diossido di stagno 7.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Tin (IV) oxide fibers ([[optical microscope]])]]
Tin(IV) oxide crystallises with the [[rutile]] structure.  As such the tin atoms are six coordinate and the oxygen atoms three coordinate.&lt;ref name = "Greenwood"/&gt; SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is usually regarded as an oxygen-deficient [[n-type semiconductor]].&lt;ref&gt;Solid State Chemistry: An Introduction Lesley Smart, Elaine A. Moore (2005) CRC Press {{ISBN|0-7487-7516-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hydrous forms of SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have been described as '''stannic acid'''. Such materials appear to be hydrated particles of SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; where the composition reflects the particle size.&lt;ref name = "Wiberg&amp;Holleman"&gt;{{Holleman&amp;Wiberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
Tin(IV) oxide occurs naturally. Synthetic tin(IV) oxide is produced by burning tin metal in air.&lt;ref name = "Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt; Annual production is in the range of 10 kilotons.&lt;ref name = "Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt; SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reduced industrially to the metal with carbon in a [[reverberatory furnace]] at 1200–1300&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;''Tin: Inorganic chemistry'',J L Wardell, Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry ed R. Bruce King, John Wiley &amp; Son Ltd., (1995) {{ISBN|0-471-93620-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amphoterism==
Although SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is insoluble in water, it is [[amphoteric]], dissolving in base and acid.&lt;ref name = "Sherwood"&gt;''Inorganic &amp; Theoretical chemistry'', F. Sherwood Taylor, Heineman, 6th Edition (1942)&lt;/ref&gt; "Stannic acid" refers to hydrated tin (IV) oxide, SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is also called "stannic hydroxide."

Tin oxides dissolve in acids. Halogen acids attack SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to give hexahalostannates,&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson &amp; Grimes in Chemistry of tin ed. P.G. Harrison Blackie (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; such as [SnI&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. One report describes reacting a sample in refluxing [[hydriodic acid|HI]] for many hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = The Action Of Hydriodic Acid On Stannic Oxide| author = Earle R. Caley|journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc.|year = 1932| volume =54| issue = 8| pages = 3240–3243|doi = 10.1021/ja01347a028}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 HI → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnI&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Similarly, SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissolves in sulfuric acid to give the sulfate:&lt;ref name = "Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt;
:SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → Sn(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissolves in strong base to give "[[stannate]]s," with the nominal formula [[Sodium stannate|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name = "Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt; Dissolving the solidified SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NaOH melt in water gives Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Sn(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, "preparing salt," which is used in the dye industry.&lt;ref name = "Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt;

==Uses==
In conjunction with vanadium oxide, it is used as a catalyst for the oxidation of aromatic compounds in the synthesis of [[carboxylic acid]]s and acid anhydrides.&lt;ref name="Greenwood"/&gt;

===Ceramic glazes===
Tin(IV) oxide has long been used as an [[opacifier]] and as a white colorant in [[ceramic glaze]]s.&lt;ref&gt;’The Glazer’s Book’ – 2nd edition. ''A.B.Searle.The Technical Press Limited.'' London. 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; This has probably led to the discovery of the pigment [[lead-tin-yellow]], which was produced using tin(IV) oxide as a compound.&lt;ref name="Kühn1967"&gt;Hermann Kühn, 1967, "Blei-Zinn-Gelb und seine Verwendung in der Malerei", ''Farbe und Lack'' '''73''': 938-949&lt;/ref&gt; The use of tin(IV) oxide has been particularly common in glazes for [[earthenware]], sanitaryware and wall tiles; see the articles [[tin-glazing]] and [[Tin-glazed pottery]]. Tin oxide remains in suspension in vitreous matrix of the fired glazes, and, with its high refractive index being sufficiently different from the matrix, light is scattered, and hence increases the [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] of the glaze. The degree of dissolution increases with the firing temperature, and hence the extent of opacity diminishes.&lt;ref&gt;’A Treatise On Ceramic Industries.’ E.Bourry. Fourth edition. Scott, Greenwood &amp; son. London. 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; Although dependent on the other constituents the solubility of tin oxide in glaze melts is generally low. Its solubility is increased by Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and reduced by CaO, BaO, ZnO, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and to a limited extent PbO.&lt;ref&gt;’Ceramic Glazes’ Third edition. C.W.Parmelee &amp; C.G.Harman. ''Cahners Books'', Boston, Massachusetts. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been used as pigment in the manufacture of glasses, enamels and ceramic glazes. Pure SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gives a milky white colour; other colours are achieved when mixed with other metallic oxides e.g. [[vanadium(V) oxide|V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] yellow; [[Chromium(III) oxide|Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] pink; and [[antimony pentoxide|Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] grey blue.&lt;ref name = "Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt;

===Polishing===
Tin(IV) oxide can be used as a polishing powder,&lt;ref name = "Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt; sometimes in mixtures also with lead oxide, for polishing glass, jewelery, marble and silver.&lt;ref name=mfa&gt;{{cite web| title = Material Name: stannic oxide| work = | publisher = [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]| date = 2007-02-10| url = http://cameo.mfa.org/browse/record.asp?subkey=8907| format = | doi = | accessdate = 2013-03-29| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121104011622/http://cameo.mfa.org/browse/record.asp?subkey=8907| archivedate = 2012-11-04| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tin(IV) oxide for this use is sometimes called as "putty powder"&lt;ref name = "Sherwood"/&gt; or "jeweler's putty".&lt;ref name=mfa/&gt;

===Glass coatings===
SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coatings can be applied using [[chemical vapor deposition]], vapour deposition techniques that employ [[tin(IV) chloride|SnCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]&lt;ref name = "Greenwood"/&gt; or organotin trihalides&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|4130673}}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. [[butyltin trichloride]] as the volatile agent. This technique is used to coat glass bottles with a thin (&lt;0.1 μm) layer of SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which helps to adhere a subsequent, protective polymer coating such as polyethylene to the glass.&lt;ref name="Greenwood"/&gt;

Thicker layers doped with Sb or F ions are electrically conducting and used in electroluminescent devices.&lt;ref name="Greenwood"/&gt;

===Gas sensing===
SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is used in [[gas detector|sensors of combustible gases]] including [[carbon monoxide detector]]s. In these the sensor area is heated to a constant temperature (few hundred °C) and in the presence of a [[combustibility|combustible]] gas the [[electrical resistivity]] drops.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Watson The stannic oxide semiconductor gas sensor in The Electrical engineering Handbook 3d Edition; Sensors Nanoscience Biomedical Engineering and Instruments ed R.C Dorf CRC Press Taylor and Francis {{ISBN|0-8493-7346-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[doping (semiconductors)|Doping]] with various compounds has been investigated (e.g. with [[copper(II) oxide|CuO]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Microstructural Morphology and Electrical Properties of Copper- and Niobium-Doped Tin (IV) oxide Polycrystalline Varistors|author1=Wang, Chun-Ming |author2=Wang, Jin-Feng |author3=Su, Wen-Bin | journal = Journal of the American Ceramic Society| year = 2006| volume =89| issue = 8| pages = 2502–2508| doi = 10.1111/j.1551-2916.2006.01076.x}}[http://www.scielo.br/pdf/mr/v9n3/31795.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''Vegetable oil recycling''' is increasingly being carried out to produce a [[vegetable oil fuel]].
In the UK, waste cooking oil collection is governed by the environment agency. All waste cooking oil collections need to be carried out by a company registered as a waste carrier by the environment agency. On each collection a waste transfer note needs to the filled out and copies held by both parties for a minimum of 3 years. Waste transfer notes need to contain:

Full company details of who the waste is being transferred to: 
*Their waste registration details
* Full details of who the waste is being transferred from
* Date
* Signatures from both parties

Waste transfer notes can be hard paper copies or electronic versions. Here is an [http://www.cateroils.co.uk/communities/2/004/012/813/122//images/4620617082_507x561.png example of a waste transfer note] currently is use by a UK waste cooking oil company.

Opportunities for businesses and consumers to [[recycling|recycle]]  [[used cooking oil]] ("[[yellow grease]]") has increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-277470-recycling-of-waste--cooking-oil-into-biodiesel-protects-water-resources.html|title=Recycling of waste cooking oil into biodiesel protects water resources|author=Balkanlioğlu, Elif|first=|date=April 15, 2012|website=|publisher=''Today's Zaman'' (Turkey)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Used cooking oil can be refined into different types of [[biofuel]]s used for power generation and heating.&lt;ref name="WorcesterTelegram"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegram.com/article/20120408/NEWS/104089973/1237|title=Recycling used cooking oil a snap for area restaurants|author=Meindersma, Sandy|first=|date=April 8, 2012|website=|publisher=[[Worcester Telegram]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant benefit is that biofuels derived from recycled cooking oil typically burn clean,&lt;ref name="WorcesterTelegram"/&gt; have a low carbon content and do not produce carbon monoxide. This helps communities to reduce their [[carbon footprint]]s.&lt;ref name="WorcesterTelegram"/&gt; The recycling of cooking oil also provides a form of revenue for restaurants, which are sometimes compensated by cooking oil recyclers for their used [[deep fryer]] oil.&lt;ref name="WorcesterTelegram"/&gt; Cooking oil recycling also results in less used oil being disposed of in drains, which can clog sewage lines due to the build-up of fats and has to be collected there as "[[brown grease]]" by [[grease trap]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/dekalb/dekalb-commissioner-sees-recycling-1400743.html|title=DeKalb commissioner sees recycling as answer to sewer spill woes|author=Hunt, April|first=|date=March 28, 2012|website=|publisher=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vegetable oil refining]] is a process to transform vegetable oil into fuel by [[hydrocracking]] or [[hydrogenation]]. Hydrocracking breaks larger molecules into smaller ones using hydrogen while hydrogenation adds hydrogen to molecules. These methods can be used for production of gasoline, diesel, and propane. The diesel fuel that is produced has various names including green diesel or renewable diesel.

In the past waste oils were collected by pig farmers as part of [[food waste]] from [[pig swill]] bins. The grease was skimmed off the swill tanks and sold for further processing, while the remaining swill was processed into pig food.{{cn|date=December 2013}}

'''William Martin''' (born February 16, 1957, [[Bethesda, Maryland]]) is an American botanist and microbiologist, currently Head of the Institut für Molekulare Evolution, [[Heinrich Heine Universität]], [[Düsseldorf]].

Born in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], Martin was educated at [[Richland College]], Dallas, Texas, and [[Texas A&amp;M University]]. After working as a [[carpenter]] in Dallas, Martin moved to [[Hannover]], Germany, and obtained his university Diploma from Technische Universität Hannover in 1985. Martin's PhD is from [[Max-Planck-Institut]] für Züchtungsforschung, [[Colog]]ne, where he did [[postdoctoral research]], followed by further postdoctoral work at Institut für Genetik, [[Braunschweig University of Technology|Technische Universität Braunschweig]], where he obtained his [[Habilitation]] in 1992. In 1999, Martin became full (C4) professor at Universität Düsseldorf.

Martin is a distinguished and sometimes controversial contributor to the field of [[molecular evolution]]. He is known particularly for his work on the evolution of the [[Calvin cycle]] and [[plastids]] including [[chloroplasts]], and, more generally, for contributions to understanding the origin and evolution of [[eukaryotic cells]]. Martin is co-author, with Miklos Mueller of [[Rockefeller University]], of the 1998 paper ''The [[Hydrogen hypothesis]] for the first [[eukaryote]]''. A wealth of subsequent research papers include contributions, independently and with Michael J. Russell of the [[NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], to understanding the geochemical origins of cells and their biochemical pathways. Martin's work is well cited (nearly 30,000 times) and he has an h-index of 84.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=ms16utkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en|title=Professor Martin Google Scholar Profile|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wood flooring''' is any product manufactured from [[timber]] that is designed for use as [[flooring]], either structural or aesthetic.  Wood is a common choice as a flooring material and can come in various styles, colors, cuts, and species. [[Bamboo floor]]ing is often considered a form of wood flooring, although it is made from a [[grass]] ([[bamboo]]) rather than a timber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.utk.edu/~mtaylo29/pages/Bamboo%20flooring.htm|title=Bamboo Flooring: Better than wood? |last=Taylor|first=Adam M.|year=2003|publisher=University of Tennessee|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

=== Solid ===

==== Hardwood flooring ====
Solid [[hardwood]] floors are made of planks milled from a single piece of timber. Solid hardwood floors were originally used for structural purposes, being installed perpendicular to the wooden support beams of a building known as joists or bearers. With the increased use of concrete as a subfloor in some parts of the world, engineered wood flooring has gained some popularity. However, solid wood floors are still common and popular. Solid wood floors have a thicker wear surface and can be sanded and finished more times than an engineered wood floor. It is not uncommon for homes in New England, Eastern Canada, USA, and Europe to have the original solid wood floor still in use today.

==== Solid wood manufacturing ====
Solid wood flooring is milled from a single piece of timber that is [[kiln]] or air dried before sawing. Depending on the desired look of the floor, the timber can be cut in three ways: flat-sawn, quarter-sawn, and rift-sawn. The timber is cut to the desired dimensions and either packed unfinished for a site-finished installation or finished at the factory. The moisture content at time of manufacturing is carefully controlled to ensure the product does not warp during transport and storage.

A number of proprietary features for solid wood floors are available. Many solid woods come with grooves cut into the back of the wood that run the length of each plank, often called 'absorption strips,' that are intended to reduce cupping. Solid wood floors are mostly manufactured {{convert|.75|in}} thick with a tongue-and-groove for installation.

===== Other  wood manufacturing styles =====

====== Rotary-peel ======
This process involves treating the wood by [[boiling]] the log in water.  After preparation, the wood is peeled by a [[blade]] starting from the outside of the log and working toward the center, thus creating a wood veneer. The veneer is then pressed flat with high pressure.  This style of manufacturing tends to have problems with the wood cupping or curling back to its original shape.    [[Lathe#Rotary lathes|Rotary]]-peeled engineered hardwoods tend to have a [[plywood]] appearance in the grain.

====== Sliced-peel ======
This process begins with the same treatment process that the rotary peel method uses.  However, instead of being sliced in a rotary fashion, with this technique the wood is sliced from the log in much the same manner that lumber is sawn from a log – straight through. The veneers do not go through the same manufacturing process as rotary peeled veneers.  Engineered hardwood produced this way tends to have fewer problems with "face checking", and also does not have the same plywood appearance in the grain.  However, the planks can tend to have edge splintering and cracking because the veneers have been submerged in water and then pressed flat.

====== Dry solid-sawn ======
Instead of boiling the hardwood logs, in this process they are kept at a low [[humidity]] level and dried slowly to draw moisture from the inside of the wood cells. The logs are then sawed in the same manner as for solid hardwood planks. This style of engineered hardwood has the same look as solid hardwood, and does not have any of the potential problems of "face checking" that rotary-peel and slice-peel products have, because the product is not exposed to added moisture.

=== Engineered ===
[[Image:LightningVolt Wood Floor.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Wood flooring is a popular feature in many houses.]]
{{main article|Engineered wood}}

Engineered wood flooring consists of two or more layers of wood adhered together to form a plank. Typically, engineered wood flooring uses a thin layer ([[Lamella (materials)|lamella]]) of a more expensive wood bonded to a core constructed from cheaper wood. The increased stability of engineered wood is achieved by running each layer at a 90° angle to the layer above. This stability makes it a universal product that can be installed over all types of subfloors above, below or on grade. Engineered wood is the most common type of wood flooring in Europe and has been growing in popularity in North America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blanchet|first=Pierre|last2=Beauregard|first2=Robert|last3=Cloutier|first3=Alain|last4=Gendron|first4=Guy|last5=Lefebvre|first5=Marcel|date=May 2003|title=Evaluation of various engineered wood flooring constructions|url=|journal=Forest Products Journal|publication-place=Madison|volume=53|issue=5|pages=30-37|issn=00157473|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Laminate flooring|Laminate]] and [[Vinyl composition tile|vinyl]] floors are often confused with engineered wood floors, but are not. Laminate flooring uses an image of wood on its surface, while vinyl flooring is plastic formed to look like wood.

The several different categories of engineered wood flooring include:
* All-timber-wood floors made from multiple layers of sawn wood. Most engineered wood flooring is in this category, and does not use rotary-peeled veneer, composite wood (such as HDF), or plastic in their construction.
* [[Wood veneer|Veneer]] floors use a thin layer of wood over a core that is commonly a composite wood product.
* Acrylic-impregnated wood flooring uses a layer of wood that is impregnated with liquid acrylic then hardened using a proprietary process.

== Comparison of solid wood with engineered wood ==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
It is difficult to compare solid wood flooring to engineered wood flooring due to the wide range of quality in both product categories, particularly engineered. Solid wood has some limitations.  Recommended maximum widths and lengths are typically 5" / 127mm wide and 7' / 2100mm long. Solid hardwood is also more prone to "gapping" (excessive space between planks), "crowning" (convex curving upwards when humidity increases) and "cupping" (a [[wikt:concave|concave]] or "dished" appearance of the plank, with the height of the plank along its longer edges being higher than the centre) with increased plank size. Solid wood cannot be used with underfloor [[radiant heating]].&lt;ref&gt;Wood Flooring by Charles Petersen, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; However extra care is necessary with the planning and installation of the heating system and the wood flooring, such as limiting the temperature to {{convert|85|F}}, avoid sharp temperature fluctuations, utilizing an outdoor thermostat to anticipate heating demands, and monitoring the moisture content for the subfloor before installation.

There are some characteristics that are common to each category: solid wood is more frequently site-finished, is always in a plank format, is generally thicker than engineered wood, and is usually installed by nailing. Engineered wood is more frequently pre-finished, has bevelled edges, is very rarely site-finished, and is installed with glue or as a floating installation.

Engineered wood flooring has other benefits beyond dimensional stability and universal use.  Patented installation systems allow for faster installation and easy replacement of boards.  Engineered wood also allows for a floating installation where the planks are not adhered to the subfloor or to each other, further increasing ease of repair and reducing installation time. Engineered flooring is also suitable for underfloor and radiant heating systems.

== Installation systems ==
Wood can be manufactured with a variety of different installation systems:

#[[Tongue-and-groove]]: One side and one end of the plank have a groove, the other side and end have a tongue (protruding wood along an edge's center).  The tongue and groove fit snugly together, thus joining or aligning the planks, and are not visible once joined.  Tongue-and-groove flooring can be installed by glue-down (both engineered and solid), floating (mostly engineered only), or nail-down (not recommended for most engineered).
#"Click" or Woodloc systems: there are a number of patented "click" systems that now exist.  These click systems are either "unilin" or "fiboloc"  A "click" floor is similar to tongue-and-groove, but instead of fitting directly into the groove, the board must be angled or "tapped" in to make the curved or barbed tongue fit into the modified groove.  No adhesive is used when installing a "click" floor, making board replacement easier.  This system not only exists for engineered wood floors but also [[engineered bamboo]] and a small number of solid floors (such as "parador solido click") and is designed to be used for floating installations.  It is beneficial for the Do-It-Yourself market.
#Floor connection system: There are a wide range of connection systems, as most of them are mill-specific manufacturing techniques.  The general principle is to have grooves on all four sides of the plank with a separate, unconnected, piece that is inserted into the grooves of two planks to join them.  The piece used for the connection can be made from wood, rubber, or plastic.  This installation system allows for different materials (i.e. wood and metal) to be installed together if they have the same connection system.
#Wood flooring can also be installed utilizing the glue-down method.  This is an especially popular method for solid parquet flooring installations on concrete sub-floors.  Additionally, engineered wood flooring may use the glue-down method as well.  A layer of mastic is placed onto the sub-floor using a trowel similar to those used in laying ceramic tile.  The wood pieces are then laid on top of the glue and hammered into place using a rubber mallet and a protected 2x4 to create a level floor.  Often the parquet floor will require sanding and re-finishing after the glue-down installation method due to the small size pieces.
#Floating installation: A floating installation is where the flooring is laid down in a glueless manner on top of a layer of underlay. The individual planks are locked together, and are not glued or nailed down to the subfloor. By doing this the floor is floating above the underlay, and can be laid on top of existing tile or marble, without the risk of damaging the subflooring.

== Finishing, buffing, and sanding ==

=== Floor finishes ===
The two most popular modern finishes for wood flooring are oil-modified urethane and water-based polyurethane. Within both categories there are many variations and other names used to describe the finish.  Oil-modified urethane and water-based polyurethane also have very different refinishing and maintenance regimes.

#Natural [[shellac]]s, [[lacquer]]s, and [[varnish]]es were used in the past, as were waxes, often blended with oils.
#Oil - Oiled floors have existed for several thousand years and is the most common floor finish used globally.  Oil finished floors are made from naturally derived drying oils, and are not to be confused with petroleum based oils.  Pre-finished oil floors can be UV cured.  Most vegetable based oils are 100% natural and contain no VOCs.
## Brushed and oiled - Steel brushes are used in the direction of the grain which opens up the surface of the wood and removes splinters.  The wood is then oiled.
#Polyurethane - Polyurethane floor finishes were first introduced around 1942. There are several types of polyurethane finishes that exist, but the two most common are oil-modified polyurethane and water-based polyurethane. Water-based urethane is harder than oil-modified polyurethane and is much safer for the user.

=== Buffing ===
Generally, hardwood floors need to be buffed every 3–5 years. The process usually takes about one day. Buffing refers to the process of using a stand up floor buffer. The floor is abraded with 180 grit screen on the buffer. This allows for the new coat of finish to mechanically adhere to the floor. This process works with great results as long as the floor hasn't had any waxes or synthetic cleaners.

=== Refinishing ===
Sanding the finish off old wood floors and smoothing them out.

=== Floor sanding ===
{{Main article|Floor sanding}}

Sanding provides a method for smoothing an installed floor, compensating for unevenness of the subfloor. Additionally, sanding is used to renew the appearance of older floors. Sanding using successively finer grades of [[sandpaper]] is required to ensure even stain penetration when stains are used, as well as to eliminate visible scratches from coarser sandpaper grades used initially. Prior to modern polyurethanes, oils and waxes were used in addition to stains to provide finishes.&lt;ref name="Wood Floor Finish Options"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greatfloorsanding.co.uk/frequently-asked-questions/|title=Wood Floor Finishes|accessdate=2015-03-26|year=2015|author=Great Floor Sanding}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beeswax and linseed oil, for example, are both natural crosslinking polymers and harden over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msue.msu.edu/objects/content_revision/download.cfm/revision_id.498912/workspace_id.-4/01500574.html/|title=Wood Floors and Finishing|last=Field|first=Anne|publisher=Michigan State University|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floor Scraping===

Prior to the 20th Century hardwood floors were refinished by scraping. This process revealed undamaged wood but left many shallow gouges in the floor.  Using [[chisel]]s, [[Plane (tool)|planes]], and [[cabinet scraper]]s&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carpetworldparamus.com/articles-(1)/promos/scraped-hardwood-flooring&lt;/ref&gt;.{{clarification needed|reason=incomplete, unfinished sentence|date=September 2018}}  Modern methods duplicate this using proprietary machinery.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.armstrongflooring.com/residential/en-us/hardwood-flooring/american-scrape-hardwood.html&lt;/ref&gt;
