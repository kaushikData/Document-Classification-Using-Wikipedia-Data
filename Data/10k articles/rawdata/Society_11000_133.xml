'''Muhammad Asghar Khan Nawani''' was a [[Pakistani]] policeman-turned-politician who belonged to Shahani [[Baloch tribes|Baloch tribe]] of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/171021-An-Account-Of-PolicemenTurnedPoliticians|title=Dunya News: Pakistan:-An Account Of Policemen-Turned-Politicians...|publisher=[[Dunya News]]|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1997 to 1999, he was an elected Member of the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly (MNA) of Pakistan]] from NA-73, [[Bhakkar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pap.gov.pk/index.php/members/profile/en/9/143|title=Punjab Assembly|publisher=[[Provincial Assembly of the Punjab]] website|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was renowned for his public services not only in his district but also nationwide. He was a brilliant cop (often called Halaku Khan for his bravery), an intellectual, a very wise politician and a [[king maker]] in his abilities.

Starting his career from primary level as Assistant Sub-Inspector in [[Punjab Police (Pakistan)|Punjab Police]], it's really astonishing how he reached to the key positions and going all the way, he last served in Police department as a [[Deputy inspector general of police|DIG]] the second highest provincial level after the [[Inspector general#Pakistan|Inspector General]] (IG). He also served in PIA ([[Pakistan International Airlines]]).

{{Expand Spanish|Camba|date=July 2011}}

'''Camba''' is a word historically used in Bolivia to refer to the indigenous population in the Eastern tropical region of the country, or to those born in the area of [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra|Santa Cruz]], [[Beni Department|Beni]], and Pando (the Eastern region of Bolivia). Nowadays, the term "Camba" is used predominately to refer to white and mestizo Bolivians largely of Spanish mixed with some Chane and other Amazonian descent born in the eastern lowlands in and around Santa Cruz de la Sierra. 

The Camba have been the focus of anthropological studies on ritualized alcohol consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/02/15/100215fa_fact_gladwell |title=Drinking Games |last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |authorlink=Malcolm Gladwell |date=15 February 2010 |work=The New Yorker |accessdate=17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the Camba frequently drink 180-proof rum (considered laboratory grade in the US) their rates of alcoholism are lower than those found in most cultures.

[[Kolla people|Colla people]], who are the indigenous population that lives in Western Bolivia, have always been in conflict with Camba people due to their different customs, behavior and appearance. Therefore, it may be common to hear Camba people use the term "Colla" as a swear word or to insult the Western population as such as it is possible to hear Collas curse on cambas.

Camba may also be used as a colloquial term for "person", as in "Who is that person?" translated to "¿Quien es ese '''camba'''?" (ignores the ethnicity of the subject and does not change depending on gender as most Spanish nouns do). Such use is predominant in eastern Bolivia.

'''Cantonese''' is a [[varieties of Chinese|variety]] of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] spoken in the city of [[Guangzhou]] (also known as Canton) and its surrounding area in [[southeastern China]]. It is the traditional [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige variety]] and [[Standard language|standard form]] of [[Yue Chinese]], one of the major subgroups of Chinese.

In [[mainland China]], it is the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the province of [[Guangdong]] (being the majority language of the [[Pearl River Delta]]) and neighbouring areas such as [[Guangxi]]. It is the dominant and official language of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]. Cantonese is also widely spoken amongst [[overseas Chinese]] in [[Southeast Asia]] (most notably in [[Vietnam]] and [[Malaysia]], as well as in [[Singapore]] and [[Cambodia]] to a lesser extent) and throughout the [[Western world]].

While the term ''Cantonese'' specifically refers to the [[prestige variety]], it is often used in a broader sense for the entire Yue subgroup of Chinese, including related but largely [[mutually unintelligible]] languages and dialects such as [[Taishanese]]. When Cantonese and the closely related [[Yuehai dialects]] are classified together, there are about 80 million total speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Grasso, J.F. ''The Everything Speaking Mandarin Book''. Foreign Language Study, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Cantonese is viewed as a vital and inseparable part of the cultural identity for its [[Cantonese people|native speakers]] across large swaths of [[Liangguang|southeastern China]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], as well as in [[Overseas Chinese|overseas communities]].

Although Cantonese shares a lot of vocabulary with [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], the two varieties are [[mutually unintelligible]] because of differences in pronunciation, grammar and lexicon. Sentence structure, in particular the placement of verbs, sometimes differs between the two varieties. A notable difference between Cantonese and Mandarin is how the spoken word is written; both can be recorded verbatim, but very few Cantonese speakers are knowledgeable in the full Cantonese written vocabulary, so a non-verbatim formalized written form is adopted, which is more akin to the Mandarin written form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=czbGJLu59S0C&amp;pg=PA5 |title=Cantonese: A Comprehensive Grammar |last=Matthews |first=Stephen |last2=Yip |first2=Virginia |date=1994 |publisher=Routledge |pages=5 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFnP_FXf-lAC&amp;pg=RA1-PA48 |title=Cantonese as Written Language: The Growth of a Written Chinese Vernacular |last=Snow |first=Donald B. |date=2004 |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |pages=48 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in the situation in which a Cantonese and a Mandarin text may look similar but are pronounced differently.

==Names==
In English, the term "Cantonese" can be ambiguous. Cantonese proper is the variety native to the city of Canton, which is the traditional English name of [[Guangzhou]]. This narrow sense may be specified as "Canton language" or "Guangzhou language".&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey and Ethnologue, respectively&lt;/ref&gt;

However, "Cantonese" may also refer to the primary branch of Chinese that contains Cantonese proper as well as [[Taishanese]] and [[Gao-Yang Yue|Gaoyang]]; this broader usage may be specified as "[[Yue Chinese|Yue speech]]" ({{zh|first=t|t=粵語|s=粤语|cy=Yuhtyúh|labels=no}}). In this article, "Cantonese" is used for Cantonese proper.

Historically, speakers called this variety "Canton speech" or "Guangzhou speech" ({{zh|first=t|t=廣州話|s=广州话|cy=Gwóngjāu wá|labels=no}}), although this term is now seldom used outside Guanghzou.  In Guangdong and Guangxi, people also call it "provincial capital speech" ({{zh|first=t|s=省城话|t=省城話|cy=Sáangsìng wá|labels=no}}) or "plain speech" ({{zh|first=t|t=白話|s=白话|cy=Baahkwá|labels=no}}). Also, academically called "Canton prefecture speech" ({{zh|first=t|t=廣府話|s=广府话|cy=Gwóngfú wá|labels=no}}).

In Hong Kong and Macau, as well as among overseas Chinese communities, the language is referred to as "Guangdong speech" or "Canton Province speech" ({{zh|first=t|s=广东话|t=廣東話|cy=Gwóngdūng wá|labels=no}}), or simply as "Chinese" ({{zh|c=中文|cy=Jūngmán|labels=no}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hong Kong Observatory is one of the examples of the Hong Kong Government officially adopting the name "廣東話"|url=http://www.hko.gov.hk/audio/indexc.shtml|publisher=Hong Kong Observatory - Audio Web Page|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/clc/curriculum_can.pdf|format=PDF|title=Cantonese program at Chinese University of Hong Kong, designating standard Cantonese as 廣東話|website=Cuhk.edu.hk|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mainland China, the term "Guangdong speech" is also increasingly being used amongst both native and non-native speakers. Given the history of the development of the Yue languages and dialects during the [[Tang dynasty]] migrations to the region, in overseas Chinese communities, it is also referred to as "Tang speech" ({{zh|first=t|t=唐話|cy=Tòhng wá|labels=no}}), given that the Cantonese people refer to themselves as "people of Tang" ({{zh|c=唐人|cy=Tòhng yàhn|labels=no}}).

Due to its status as a [[prestige dialect]] among all the dialects of the Yue branch of Chinese varieties, it is often called "Standard Cantonese" ({{zh|first=t|t=標準粵語|s=标准粤语|cy=Bīujéun Yuhtyúh|labels=no}}).

==Geographic distribution==
===Hong Kong and Macau===
{{See also|Hong Kong Cantonese}}
The [[official language]]s of [[Hong Kong]] are [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[English language|English]], as defined in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_1.html|title=Basic Law, Chapter I : General Principles|website=Basiclaw.gov.hk|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese language has [[Varieties of Chinese|many different varieties]], of which Cantonese is one. Given the traditional predominance of Cantonese within Hong Kong, it is the ''de facto'' official spoken form of the Chinese language used in the [[Government of Hong Kong|Hong Kong Government]] and all courts and tribunals. It is also used as the [[medium of instruction]] in schools, alongside English.

A similar situation also exists in neighboring [[Macau]], where Chinese is an official language alongside [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. As in Hong Kong, Cantonese is the predominant spoken [[Varieties of Chinese|variety of Chinese]] used in everyday life and is thus the official form of Chinese used in the government. The Cantonese spoken in Hong Kong and Macau is [[mutually intelligible]] with the Cantonese spoken in the mainland city of [[Guangzhou]], although there exist some minor differences in accent, pronunciation and vocabulary.

===China===
[[File:Ping and Yue dialect map.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Distribution of Yue Chinese languages in Southeastern China. Standard Cantonese and closely related dialects are highlighted in pink.]]
Cantonese first developed around the port city of [[Guangzhou]] in the [[Pearl River Delta]] region of southeastern [[China]]. Due to the city's long standing as an important cultural center, Cantonese emerged as the prestige dialect of the [[Yue Chinese|Yue varieties of Chinese]] in the [[Southern Song]] dynasty and its usage spread around most of what is now the provinces of [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]].{{sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=4}}

Despite the cession of Macau to Portugal in 1557 and [[Treaty of Nanking|Hong Kong to Britain]] in 1842, the ethnic Chinese population of the two territories largely originated from the 19th and 20th century immigration from Guangzhou and surrounding areas, making Cantonese the prominent Chinese language in the territories. On the mainland, Cantonese continued to serve as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] provinces even after Mandarin was made the official language of the government by the [[Qing dynasty]] in the early 1900s.{{sfnp|Coblin|2000|pp=549–550}} Cantonese remained the dominant and influential language in southeastern China until the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949 and its promotion of [[Standard Chinese]] as the sole official language of the nation throughout the last half of the 20th century, although its influence is still remaining strong within the region.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=3–15}}

While the Chinese government vehemently discourages the official use of all forms of Chinese except Standard Chinese, Cantonese enjoys a relatively higher standing than other Chinese languages, with its own media and usage in public transportation in Guangdong province.&lt;ref name="sarft-1"&gt;{{cite web

Nevertheless, the place of local Cantonese language and culture remains contentious. A 2010 [[Guangzhou Television Cantonese controversy|proposal to switch some programming on Guangzhou television]] from Cantonese to Mandarin was abandoned following massive public protests, the largest since the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. As a major economic center of China, there have been recent concerns that the use of Cantonese in Guangzhou is diminishing in favour of Mandarin, both through the continual influx of Mandarin-speaking migrants from impoverished areas and strict government policies. As a result, Cantonese is being given a more important status by the natives than ever before as a common identity of the local people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/27/world/asia/27cantonese.html |title=Move to Limit Cantonese on Chinese TV Is Assailed |last=Wong |first=Edward |date=2010-07-26 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-09-24 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southeast Asia===
Cantonese has historically served as a ''lingua franca'' among overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, who speak a variety of other forms of Chinese including [[Hokkien]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] and [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]].&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;West (2010), pp. 289-90&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Cantonese media and popular culture from Hong Kong is popular throughout the region.

====Vietnam====
{{see also|Hoa people}}
In [[Vietnam]], Cantonese is the dominant language of the ethnic Chinese community, usually referred to as ''[[Hoa people|Hoa]]'', which numbers about one million people and constitutes one of the largest minority groups in the country.&lt;ref name="GSO2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gso.gov.vn/default.aspx?tabid=512&amp;idmid=5&amp;ItemID=10798|title=Kết quả toàn bộ Tổng điều tra Dân số và Nhà ở Việt Nam năm 2009&amp;ndash;Phần I: Biểu Tổng hợp|author=General Statistics Office of Vietnam|page=134/882|accessdate=13 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114131814/http://www.gso.gov.vn/default.aspx?tabid=512&amp;idmid=5&amp;ItemID=10798|archivedate=14 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over half of the ethnic Chinese population in Vietnam speaks Cantonese as a native language and the variety also serves as a lingua franca between the different Chinese dialect groups. Many speakers reflect their exposure to [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] with a Vietnamese accent or a tendency to [[code-switching|code-switch]] between Cantonese and Vietnamese.&lt;ref&gt;Khanh (1993), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

====Malaysia====
{{main|Malaysian Cantonese}}
{{see also|Malaysian Chinese#Cantonese}}
In [[Malaysia]], Cantonese is widely spoken amongst the [[Malaysian Chinese]] community in the capital city of [[Kuala Lumpur]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=zh-hans |url=http://www.newera.edu.my/files/mces/xuebao2009/Xuebao09_83-131.pdf|format=PDF|script-title=zh:《马来西亚的三个汉语方言》中之 吉隆坡广东话阅谭 |publisher=[[New Era University College]] |accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the surrounding areas in the [[Klang Valley]] ([[Petaling Jaya]], [[Ampang, Selangor|Ampang]], [[Cheras, Selangor|Cheras]], [[Selayang]], [[Sungai Buloh]], [[Puchong]], [[Shah Alam]], [[Kajang]], [[Bangi, Malaysia|Bangi]] and [[Subang Jaya]]). The dialect is also widely spoken as well in the town of [[Sekinchan]] in the district of
[[Sabak Bernam]] located in the northern part of [[Selangor]] state and also in the state of [[Perak]], especially in the state capital city of [[Ipoh]] and its surrounding towns of [[Gopeng]], [[Batu Gajah]] and [[Kampar, Perak|Kampar]] of the [[Kinta Valley]] region plus the towns of [[Tapah]] and [[Bidor]] in the southern part of the [[Perak]] state, and also widely spoken in the eastern [[Sabah]]an town of [[Sandakan]] as well as the towns of [[Kuantan]], [[Raub]], [[Bentong]] and [[Mentakab]] in [[Pahang]] state and they are also found in other areas such as [[Sarikei]], [[Sarawak]] and [[Mersing]], [[Johor]].

Although [[Hokkien]] is the most spoken variety of Chinese and Mandarin is the medium of education at [[Chinese-language schools]], Cantonese is largely influential in the local Chinese-language media and is used in commerce by Chinese Malaysians.&lt;ref&gt;Tze Wei Sim, ''Why are the Native Languages of the Chinese Malaysians in Decline''. Journal of Taiwanese Vernacular, p. 75, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the popularity of [[Hong Kong popular culture]], especially through drama series and popular music, Cantonese is widely understood by the Chinese in all parts of Malaysia, even though a large proportion of the Chinese Malaysian population is non-Cantonese. Television networks in Malaysia regularly broadcast Hong Kong television programmes in their original Cantonese audio and soundtrack. Cantonese radio is also available in the nation and Cantonese is prevalent in locally produced Chinese television.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinahistoryforum.com/topic/9443-malaysian-cantonese/ Malaysian Cantonese] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20140527184424/http://www.chinahistoryforum.com/topic/9443-malaysian-cantonese/ |date=May 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tze Wei Sim, ''Why are the Native Languages of the Chinese Malaysians in Decline''. Journal of Taiwanese Vernacular, p. 74, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantonese spoken in Malaysia often exhibits influences from [[Malay language|Malay]] and other Chinese varieties spoken in the country, such as Hokkien and Teochew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wee Kek Koon|url=https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/short-reads/article/2171053/why-cantonese-spoken-malaysia-sounds-different|title=Why Cantonese spoken in Malaysia sounds different to Hong Kong Cantonese, and no it’s not ‘wrong’|publisher=''[[South China Morning Post]]''|date=2018-11-01|accessdate=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Singapore====
{{see also|Chinese Singaporeans|Languages of Singapore}}
In [[Singapore]], Mandarin is the official variety of the Chinese language used by the government, which has a [[Speak Mandarin Campaign]] (SMC) seeking to actively promote the use of Mandarin at the expense of other Chinese varieties. Cantonese is spoken by a little over 15% of Chinese households in Singapore. Despite the government's active promotion of SMC, the Cantonese-speaking Chinese community has had relative success in preserving its language from Mandarin compared to other dialect groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howardscott.net/4/Swatow_A_Colonial_Heritage/Files/Documentation/Lee%20Eu%20Fah.pdf Profile of the Singapore Chinese Dialect Groups] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205010508/http://www.howardscott.net/4/Swatow_A_Colonial_Heritage/Files/Documentation/Lee%20Eu%20Fah.pdf |date=2011-02-05 }} Lee, Edward Eu Fah. ''Singapore Department of Statistics'', 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, all nationally produced non-Mandarin Chinese TV and radio programs were stopped after 1979.&lt;ref name="cna"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/413581/1/.html |title=Use of dialects interfere with learning of Mandarin &amp; English |publisher=Channelnewsasia.com |date=2009-03-06 |accessdate=2012-01-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307112543/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/413581/1/.html |archivedate=2009-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prime minister, [[Lee Kuan Yew]], then, also stopped giving speeches in [[Hokkien]] to prevent giving conflicting signals to the people.&lt;ref name="cna" /&gt; Hong Kong (Cantonese) and [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] dramas are unavailable in their untranslated form on free-to-air television, though drama series in non-Chinese languages are available in their original languages. Cantonese drama series on terrestrial TV channels are instead dubbed in Mandarin and broadcast without the original Cantonese audio and soundtrack. However, originals may be available through other sources such as cable television and online videos.

Furthermore, an offshoot of SMC is the translation to [[Hanyu Pinyin]] of certain terms which originated from southern Chinese varieties. For instance, [[dim sum]] is often known as ''diǎn xīn'' in Singapore's English-language media, though this is largely a matter of style, and most Singaporeans will still refer to it as ''dim sum'' when speaking English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mandarin.org.sg |title=Speak Mandarin Campaign |publisher=Mandarin.org.sg |date= |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, since the government restriction on media in non-Mandarin varieties was relaxed in the mid-1990s and 2000s, the presence of Cantonese in Singapore has grown substantially. Forms of popular culture from Hong Kong, such as [[Hong Kong television drama|television series]], [[Hong Kong cinema|cinema]] and [[Cantopop|pop music]] have become popular in Singaporean society, and non-dubbed original versions of the media became widely available. Consequently, there has been a large number of non-Cantonese Chinese Singaporeans being able to understand or speak Cantonese to some varying extent, with a number of educational institutes offering Cantonese as an elective language course.&lt;ref&gt;{{{cite book |last=Chua |first=Beng Huat |title=Life is Not Complete Without Shopping: Consumption Culture in Singapore |year=2003 |publisher=Singapore University Press |pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cambodia====
Cantonese is widely used as the inter-communal language among [[Chinese Cambodian]]s, especially in [[Phnom Penh]] and other urban areas. While Teochew speakers form the majority of the Chinese population in [[Cambodia]], Cantonese is often used as a vernacular in commerce and with other Chinese variant groups in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/cambodia/45.htm |title=Cambodia - The Chinese |publisher=Countrystudies.us |date= |accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese-language schools in Cambodia are conducted in both Cantonese and Mandarin, but schools may be conducted exclusively in one Chinese variant or the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chan, Sambath|url=http://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/8439/1/MR04330.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Chinese Minority in Cambodia: Identity Construction and Contestation|page=34|date=2005|website=Spectrum.library.concordia.ca|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thailand====
[[Thailand]] is home to the [[Thai Chinese|largest overseas Chinese community]] in the world, numbering over 9 million individuals. Cantonese is the fourth most-spoken variety of Chinese in Thai Chinese households after [[Teochew language|Teochew]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Hainanese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=John |last1=Knodel |first2=Mary Beth |last2=Ofstedal |first3=Albert I |last3=Hermalin |title=The Demographic, Socioeconomic, and Cultural Context of the Four Study Countries |work=The Well-Being of the Elderly in Asia: A Four-Country Comparative Study |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=2002 |pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, within the Thai Chinese commercial sector, it serves as a common language alongside Teochew or Thai. Chinese-language schools in Thailand have also traditionally been conducted in Cantonese. Furthermore, Cantonese serves as the lingua franca with other Chinese communities in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Tong, Chee Kiong. ''Alternate Identities: The Chinese of Contemporary Thailand'', 2001, BRILL, pp.&amp;nbsp;21–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indonesia====
{{see also|Indonesian Chinese#Language}}
In [[Indonesia]], Cantonese is locally known as ''Konghu'' and is one of the variants spoken by the [[Chinese Indonesian]] community, with speakers largely concentrated in major cities such as [[Jakarta]], [[Surabaya]] and [[Batam]]. However, it has a relatively minor presence compared to other Southeast Asian nations, being the fourth most spoken Chinese variety after Hokkien, Hakka and Teochew. {{sfn|Lewis|2005|p=391}}

===North America===
====United States====
[[File:San Francisco China Town MC.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Street in [[Chinatown, San Francisco]]. Cantonese has traditionally been the dominant Chinese variant among Chinese populations in the Western world.]]

Over a period of 150 years, Guangdong has been the place-of-origin for most Chinese emigrants to Western nations; one coastal county, [[Taishan, Guangdong|Taishan]] (or Tóisàn, where the Sìyì or ''sei yap'' variety of Yue is spoken), alone may be the origin of the vast majority of Chinese immigrants to the U.S. before 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bryson |first= Bill |author-link= Bill Bryson |title= ''[[Made in America (book)|Made In America]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Yue languages such as Cantonese and the closely related variety of [[Taishanese]] have been the major Chinese varieties traditionally spoken in the United States.

The Zhongshan variant of Cantonese, with origins in the western Pearl River Delta, is spoken by many Chinese immigrants in [[Hawaii]], and some in [[San Francisco]] and the [[Sacramento River]] Delta (see [[Locke, California]]); it is a Yuehai variety much like Guangzhou Cantonese, but has "flatter" tones. Chinese is the third most widely spoken non-English language in the United States when both Cantonese and Mandarin are combined, behind [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]].&lt;ref name="Lai"&gt;{{cite book|last = Lai|first = H. Mark|title = Becoming Chinese American: A History of Communities and Institutions|publisher = AltaMira Press|year = 2004|isbn = 0-7591-0458-1}} '''need page number(s)'''&lt;/ref&gt; Many institutes of higher education have traditionally had Chinese programs based on Cantonese, with some continuing to offer these programs despite the rise of Mandarin. The most popular romanization for learning Cantonese in the United States is [[Yale romanization of Cantonese|Yale Romanization]].

The majority of Chinese emigrants have traditionally originated from Guangdong and Guangxi, as well as Hong Kong and Macao (beginning in the latter half of the 20th century and before the [[Handover of Hong Kong|Handover]]) and Southeast Asia, with Cantonese as their native language. However, more recent immigrants are arriving from the rest of mainland China and Taiwan and most often speak [[Standard Chinese|Standard Mandarin]] (Putonghua) as their native language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hsktests.com/mandarin-use-chinese-american-communities/|title=Mandarin Use Up in Chinese American Communities - HSK Tests Online|date=11 October 2014|website=Hsktests.com|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=115613 |title=As Mandarin language becomes standard, Chinatown explores new identity |publisher=News.medill.northwestern.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120194030/http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=115613 |archivedate=2012-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although some may also speak their native local variety, such as [[Shanghainese]], [[Hokkien]], [[Fuzhounese]], [[Hakka language|Hakka]], etc. As a result, Mandarin is becoming more common among the [[Chinese American]] community.

The increase of Mandarin-speaking communities has resulted in the rise of separate neighborhoods or enclaves segregated by the primary Chinese variety spoken. Socioeconomic statuses are also a factor as well.&lt;ref name="Chee Beng Tan 2007 115"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chinese Transnational Networks|author=Chee Beng Tan|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2007|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[New York City]], Cantonese still predominates in the city's [[Mott Street|older, traditional western portion]] of [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]] in [[Manhattan]], in Brooklyn's small new Chinatowns in sections of [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn|Bensonhurst]] and in [[Homecrest, Brooklyn|Homecrest]]. The newly emerged [[Little Fuzhou]] eastern portion of Manhattan's Chinatown and [[Chinatown, Brooklyn|Brooklyn's main large Chinatown]] in and around [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]] are mostly populated by [[Fuzhounese|Fuzhounese speakers]], who often speak Mandarin as well. The Cantonese and Fuzhounese enclaves in New York City are more working class. [[Chinatown, Flushing|Flushing's large Chinatown]], which now holds the crown as the largest Chinatown of the city, and [[Elmhurst, Queens|Elmhurst's smaller Chinatown]] in Queens are very mixed, with large numbers of Mandarin speakers from many different parts of China and Taiwan. They comprise the primary cultural center for New York City's Chinese population and are more middle class.&lt;ref name=Semplep2&gt;Semple, Kirk. "In Chinatown, Sound of the Future Is Mandarin." ''[[The New York Times]]''. October 21, 2009. p. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/22/nyregion/22chinese.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0 2]. Retrieved on March 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Northern California]], especially in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], Cantonese has historically and continues to predominate in the Chinatowns of [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco]] and [[Chinatown, Oakland|Oakland]], as well as the surrounding suburbs and metropolitan area, although Mandarin is now{{when|date=September 2016}} also found in [[Silicon Valley]]. In contrast, [[Southern California]] hosts a much larger Mandarin-speaking population, with Cantonese found in more historical Chinese communities such as that of [[Chinatown, Los Angeles]], and older Chinese ethnoburbs such as [[San Gabriel, California|San Gabriel]], [[Rosemead, California|Rosemead]], and [[Temple City, California|Temple City]].&lt;ref name="dragon"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/mar/31/local/me-sangabriel31 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=David | last=Pierson | title=Dragon Roars in San Gabriel - Los Angeles Times | date=2006-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a number of more-established Taiwanese immigrants have learned Cantonese to foster relations with the traditional Cantonese-speaking Chinese American population, more recent arrivals and the larger number of mainland Chinese immigrants have largely continued to use Mandarin as the exclusive variety of Chinese. This has led to a [[linguistic discrimination]] that has also contributed to social conflicts between the two sides, with a growing number of Chinese Americans (including [[American-born Chinese]]) of Cantonese background defending the historic Chinese-American culture against the impacts of increasing Mandarin-speaking new arrivals.&lt;ref name="Chee Beng Tan 2007 115"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HML"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chinese American Transnational Politics|author=Him Mark Lai|authorlink=Him Mark Lai|author2=Hsu, Madeline Y.|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2010|pages=49–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
Cantonese is the most common Chinese variety spoken among [[Chinese Canadians]]. According to the [[Canada 2016 Census]], there were 565,275 Canadian residents who reported Cantonese as their native language.

As in the United States, the Chinese Canadian community traces its roots to early immigrants from Guangdong during the latter half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Berton, ''The Last Spike'', Penguin, {{ISBN|0-14-011763-6}}, pp. 249-250&lt;/ref&gt; Later Chinese immigrants came from Hong Kong in two waves, first in the late 1960s to mid 1970s, and again in the 1980s to late 1990s on fears arising from the impending handover to the [[People's Republic of China]]. Chinese-speaking immigrants from conflict zones in Southeast Asia, especially Vietnam, arrived as well, beginning in the mid-1970s and were also largely Cantonese-speaking. Unlike the United States, recent immigration from mainland China and Taiwan to Canada has been small, and Cantonese still remains the predominant Chinese variety in the country.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web |last=Post |first=National |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/financialpost/story.html?id=98c8e575-d181-40ef-8dcc-5feb1ff19121 |title=Why is Canada keeping out China's rich? |publisher=Canada.com |date=2012-03-03 |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411021909/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/financialpost/story.html?id=98c8e575-d181-40ef-8dcc-5feb1ff19121 |archivedate=2014-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Europe===
====United Kingdom====
The overwhelming majority of Chinese speakers in the [[United Kingdom]] use Cantonese, with about 300,000 British people claiming it as their first language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=GB |title=Cantonese speakers in the UK |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely due to the presence of [[Hong Kong people in the United Kingdom|British Hong Kongers]] and the fact that many [[British Chinese]] also have origins in the former British colonies in Southeast Asia of Singapore and Malaysia.

====France====
Among the [[Chinese community in France]], Cantonese is spoken by immigrants who fled the former [[French Indochina]] (Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos) following the conflicts and communist takeovers in the region during the 1970s. While a slight majority of ethnic Chinese from Indochina speak Teochew at home, knowledge of Cantonese is prevalent due to its historic prestige status in the region and is used for commercial and community purposes between the different Chinese variety groups. As in the United States, there is a divide between Cantonese-speakers and those speaking other mainland Chinese varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.fr/story/23827/chinois-de-france-ne-veut-rien-dire|title=Chinois de France» ne veut rien dire|date=28 June 2010|website=Slate.fr|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Portugal====
Cantonese is spoken by ethnic [[Chinese people in Portugal|Chinese in Portugal]] who originate from Macau, the most established Chinese community in the nation with a presence dating back to the 16th century and [[Portuguese Macau|Portuguese colonialism]]. Since the late-20th century, however, Mandarin- and Wu-speaking migrants from mainland China have outnumbered those from Macau, although Cantonese is still retained among mainstream Chinese community associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=de Oliveira|first=Catarina Reis|date=July 2003|title=Immigrant's Entrepreneurial Opportunities: The Case of the Chinese in Portugal|publisher=Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei|publication-place=Portugal|journal=FEEM Working Papers|issue=75|ssrn=464682|accessdate=|doi=10.2139/ssrn.464682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Cantonese has traditionally been the dominant Chinese language of the [[Chinese Australian]] community since the first ethnic Chinese settlers arrived in the 1850s. It maintained this status until the mid-2000s, when a heavy increase in immigration from Mandarin-speakers largely from Mainland China led to Mandarin surpassing Cantonese as the dominant Chinese dialect spoken. Cantonese is the third most-spoken language in Australia. In the 2011 census, the Australian Bureau of Statistics listed 336,410 and 263,673 speakers of Mandarin and Cantonese, respectively.

[[File:Tangyun - Chinese Dictionary Museum.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.65|Chinese dictionary from the [[Tang dynasty]]. Modern Cantonese pronunciation preserves almost all terminal consonants (-m -n -ng, -p -t -k) from Middle Chinese.]]

During the [[Southern Song]] period, Guangzhou became the cultural center of the region.{{sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=4}} Cantonese emerged as the [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige variety]] of [[Yue Chinese]] when the port city of [[Guangzhou]] on the [[Pearl River Delta]] became the largest port in China, with a trade network stretching as far as Arabia.{{sfnp|Li|2006|p=126}}  Cantonese was also used in the popular ''Yuè'ōu'', ''Mùyú'' and ''Nányīn'' folksong genres, as well as [[Cantonese opera]].{{sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|pp=5–6}}{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=99}} Additionally, a distinct classical literature was developed in Cantonese, with [[Middle Chinese]] texts sounding more similar to modern Cantonese than other present-day Chinese varieties, including Mandarin.{{sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=5}}

As Guangzhou became China's key commercial center for foreign trade and exchange in the 1700s, Cantonese became the variety of Chinese interacting with most with the Western World.{{sfnp|Li|2006|p=126}} Around this period and continuing into the 1900s, the ancestors of most of the population of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] arrived from Guangzhou and surrounding areas after they were ceded to [[British Empire|Britain]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]], respectively.{{sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=70}} After the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1912, Cantonese almost became the official language of the Republic of China but lost by a small margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.scmp.com/article/694592/cantonese-almost-became-official-language| title= Cantonese almost became the official language| publisher= [[South China Morning Post]]| date= October 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mainland China, [[Standard Chinese]] (based on [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]) has been heavily promoted as the medium of instruction in schools and as the official language, especially after the communist takeover in 1949. Meanwhile, Cantonese has remained the official variety of Chinese in Hong Kong and Macau, both during and after the colonial period.{{sfnp|Zhang|YangDang|2004|p=154}}

Spoken Chinese has numerous regional and local varieties, many of which are [[mutually unintelligible]]. Most of these are rare outside their native areas, though they may be spoken outside of China. Many varieties also has [[Literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters]] for newer standard reading sounds. Since a 1909 [[Qing dynasty]] decree, China has promoted [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] for use in education, the media, and official communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|

&lt;/ref&gt; The proclamation of Mandarin as the official national language, however, was not fully accepted by the Cantonese authorities in the early 20th century, who argued for the "regional uniqueness" of their own local language and commercial importance of the region.&lt;ref name="Cantonese film"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vD6I4hP4CDMC&amp;pg=PA184#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cinema and Urban Culture in Shanghai, 1922-1943 |editor= Yingjin Zhang |page=184 |publisher=Stanford University Press |year= 1999 |isbn=978-0804735728 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other non-Mandarin Chinese varieties, Cantonese persists in a few state [[Southern Television Guangdong|television]] and [[Radio Guangdong|radio]] broadcasts today.

Nevertheless, there have been recent attempts to minimize the use of Cantonese in China. The most notable has been the 2010 proposal that [[Guangzhou Television]] increase its broadcast in Mandarin at the expense of Cantonese programs. This however led to [[Guangzhou Television Cantonese controversy|protests in Guangzhou]], which eventually dissuaded authorities from going forward with the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=mCOOHHDvV_wC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Lost in Transition: Hong Kong Culture in the Age of China |author= Yiu-Wai Chu |pages=147–148 |publisher=State University of New York Press |year= 2013 |isbn=978-1438446455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there are reports of students being punished for speaking other Chinese languages at school, resulting in a reluctance of younger children to communicate in their native languages, including Cantonese.&lt;ref name="ycwb10-07-09"&gt;{{cite news |script-title=zh:学校要求学生讲普通话 祖孙俩竟变"鸡同鸭讲" |trans-title=Grandma and granddaughter can't communicate each other due to school rules |url=http://news.ycwb.com/2010-07/09/content_2571999.htm |publisher=''[[Yangcheng Evening News]]'' |date=2010-07-09 |language=Chinese |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such actions have further provoked Cantonese speakers to cherish their linguistic identity in contrast to migrants who have generally arrived from poorer areas of China and largely speak Mandarin or other Chinese languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tw.nextmedia.com/applenews/article/art_id/33897761/IssueID/20111219 |title=粵語播音須報准 民轟「弱智」 &amp;#124; 國際新聞 &amp;#124; 蘋果日報 |publisher=Tw.nextmedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the linguistic history of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], and the use of Cantonese in many established [[overseas Chinese]] communities, diaspora speakers of Cantonese is numerous compared to speakers residing in China. Cantonese is the predominant Chinese variety spoken in Hong Kong and Macau. In these areas, public discourse takes place almost exclusively in Cantonese, making it the only variety of Chinese other than Mandarin to be used as an official language in the world. Because of their dominance in Chinese diaspora overseas, standard Cantonese and its dialect [[Taishanese]] are among the most common Chinese languages that one may encounter in the West.

Increasingly since the [[Handover of Hong Kong|1997 Handover]], Cantonese has been used as a symbol of local identity in Hong Kong, largely through the [[Democratic development in Hong Kong|development of democracy in the territory]] and [[Desinicization#Hong_Kong|desinicization]] practices to emphasise a separate Hong Kong identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://thinking-taiwan.com/say-it-loud-language-ident-hktw/ |title=Say It Loud: Language and Identity in Taiwan and Hong Kong |last=McLean-Dreyfus |first=Marie-Alice |date=2014-11-06 |website=Thinking Taiwan |language=en-US |access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar identity issue exists in the United States, where conflicts have arisen among Chinese-speakers due to a large recent influx of Mandarin-speakers. While older Taiwanese immigrants have learned Cantonese to foster integration within the traditional Chinese American populations, more recent arrivals from the Mainland continue to use Mandarin exclusively. This has contributed to a segregation of communities based on linguistic cleavage. In particular, some Chinese Americans (including [[American-born Chinese]]) of Cantonese background emphasise their non-Mainland origins(e.g. Hong Kong, Macau, Vietnam, etc.) to assert their identity in the face of new waves of immigration.&lt;ref name="Chee Beng Tan 2007 115"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HML"/&gt;

Along with Mandarin and [[Hokkien]], Cantonese has its own popular music, [[Cantopop]], which is the predominant genre in Hong Kong. Many artists from the Mainland and Taiwan have learned Cantonese to break into the market.&lt;ref name="Donald"&gt;{{cite book

Cantonese films date to the early days of Chinese cinema, and the first Cantonese talkie, ''White Gold Dragon'' ([[:zh:白金龙 (电影)|白金龍]]), was made in 1932 by the [[Tianyi Film Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DdrHAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Hong Kong Connections: Transnational Imagination in Action Cinema |authors= Meaghan Morris, Siu Leung Li, Stephen Ching-kiu Chan |page=193 |publisher=Duke University Press Books |year= 2006  |isbn=978-1932643015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite a ban on Cantonese films by the [[Nanjing decade|Nanjing authority]] in the 1930s, Cantonese film production continued in Hong Kong which was then under British colonial rule.&lt;ref name="Cantonese film" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9eUlAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA427&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Historical Dictionary of Hong Kong Cinema |author= Lisa Odham Stokes |page=427 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year= 2007 |isbn= 978-0810855205 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the mid-1970s to the 1990s, [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Cantonese films]] made in Hong Kong were very popular in the Chinese speaking world.

==Phonology==
{{Main|Cantonese phonology}}
{{See also|Hong Kong Cantonese}}

===Initials and finals===
The ''de facto'' standard pronunciation of Cantonese is that of Canton (Guangzhou), which is described in the Cantonese phonology article. [[Hong Kong Cantonese]] has some minor variations in phonology, but is largely identical to standard Guangzhou Cantonese.

In Hong Kong and Macau, certain phoneme pairs have merged. Although termed as "lazy sound" ({{lang|zh-hk|懶音}}) and considered substandard to Guangzhou pronunciation, the phenomenon has been widespread in the territories since the early 20th century. The most notable difference between Hong Kong and Guangzhou pronunciation is the substitution of the liquid nasal ({{IPA|/l/}}) for the nasal initial ({{IPA|/n/}}) in many words.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Steven., Yip, Virginia. ''Cantonese: A Comprehensive Grammar: 2nd edition'' (2011), p.4&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is manifested in the word for you (你), pronounced as ''néih'' in Guangzhou and as ''léih'' in Hong Kong.

Another key feature of Hong Kong Cantonese is the merging of the two syllabic nasals {{IPA|/ŋ̩/}} and {{IPA|/m̩/}}. This can be exemplified in the elimination of the contrast of sounds between 吳 ([[Ng (surname)|Ng]], a surname) (''ng''&lt;small&gt;4&lt;/small&gt;/''ǹgh'' in Guangzhou pronunciation) and 唔 (not) (''m''&lt;small&gt;4&lt;/small&gt;/m̀h in Guangzhou pronunciation). In Hong Kong, both words are pronounced as the latter.&lt;ref name="Matthews"&gt;Matthews, Steven., Yip, Virginia. ''Cantonese: A Comprehensive Grammar: 2nd edition'' (2011), p.37&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, the initials {{IPA|/kʷ/}} and {{IPA|/kʷʰ/}} can be merged into {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/kʰ/}} when followed by {{IPA|/ɔː/}}. An example is in the word for country (國), pronounced in standard Guangzhou as ''gwok'' but as ''gok'' with the merge. Unlike the above two differences, this merge is found alongside the standard pronunciation in Hong Kong rather than being replaced. Educated speakers often stick to the standard pronunciation but can exemplify the merged pronunciation in casual speech. In contrast, less educated speakers pronounce the merge more frequently.&lt;ref name="Matthews" /&gt;

Less prevalent, but still notable differences found among a number of Hong Kong speakers include:
*Merging of {{IPA|/ŋ/}} initial into null initial.
*Merging of {{IPA|/ŋ/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} codas into {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/t/}} codas respectively, eliminating contrast between these pairs of finals (except after {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}): {{IPA|/aːn/}}-{{IPA|/aːŋ/}}, {{IPA|/aːt/}}-{{IPA|/aːk/}}, {{IPA|/ɐn/}}-{{IPA|/ɐŋ/}}, {{IPA|/ɐt/}}-{{IPA|/ɐk/}}, {{IPA|/ɔːn/}}-{{IPA|/ɔːŋ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔːt/}}-{{IPA|/ɔːk/}}.
*Merging of the rising tones (陰上 2nd and 陽上 5th).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Variation and merger of the rising tones in Hong Kong Cantonese | first = Robert S. | last = Bauer | first2 = Kwan-hin | last2 = Cheung | first3 = Pak-man | last3 = Cheung | journal = Language Variation and Change | year = 2003 | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 211–225 | doi =  10.1017/S0954394503152039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantonese vowels tend to be traced further back to [[Middle Chinese]] than their Mandarin analogues, such as M. /aɪ/ vs. C. /ɔːi/; M. /i/ vs. C. /ɐi/; M. /ɤ/ vs. C. /ɔː/; M. /ɑʊ/ vs. C. /ou/ etc. For consonants, some differences include M. /ɕ, tɕ, tɕʰ/ vs. C. /h, k, kʰ/; M. /ʐ/ vs. C. /j/; and a greater syllable coda diversity in Cantonese (such as syllables ending in ''-t'', ''-p'', or ''-k'').

===Tones===
Generally speaking, Cantonese is a [[tonal language]] with six phonetic tones.

Historically, finals that end in a [[stop consonant]] were considered as "[[checked tone]]s" and treated separately by [[Historical linguistics|diachronic]] convention, identifying Cantonese with nine tones （九声六调）. However, phonetically these are now considered a conflation of tone and final consonant and are seldom counted as individual tones in modern linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bauer|Benedict|1997|pp=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substrate influences===
Cantonese shows a clear substrate influence from [[Tai-Kadai languages|Tai-Kadai]].

Robert Bauer (1996) points out twenty nine possible cognates between Cantonese spoken in Guangzhou and [[Tai-Kadai languages|Tai-Kadai]], of which seven cognates are confirmed to originate from [[Tai-Kadai languages|Tai-Kadai]] sources:{{sfnp|Bauer|1996|pp=1835-1836}}

Anne-Yue Hashimoto (1976) identifies these words: Cantonese ''tei&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'' ([[Wuming Zhuang]] tøi&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; = 'team') "pronominal plural", Cant. ''luk&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;'' ''jau'' ([[Wuming Zhuang|WM]] ''lɯk&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; puk&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;'') "pomelo", Cant.

Besides the lexical influence, Cantonese also exhibits Tai structural and grammatical influences. The ABB expressive reduplicated forms, which are common in Tai, can be found in Cantonese.

==Written Cantonese==
{{Main|Written Cantonese|Cantonese Braille}}
As Cantonese is used primarily in Hong Kong, Macau, and other overseas Chinese communities, it is usually written with [[traditional Chinese characters]]. However, it includes extra characters as well as characters with different meanings from [[written vernacular Chinese]] due to the presence of words that either do not exist in standard Chinese or correspond with spoken Cantonese. This system of [[written Cantonese]] is often found in colloquial contexts such as entertainment magazines and social media, as well as on advertisements.

In contrast, standard written Chinese continues to be used in formal literature, professional and government documents, television and movie subtitles, and news media. Nevertheless, colloquial characters may be present in formal written communications such as legal testimonies and newspapers when an individual is being quoted, rather than paraphrasing spoken Cantonese into standard written Chinese.

==Romanization==
Cantonese romanization systems are based on the accent of Canton and Hong Kong, and have helped define the concept of Standard Cantonese. The major systems are: [[Jyutping]], [[Yale Romanization of Cantonese|Yale]], the Chinese government's [[Guangdong Romanization]], and [[Meyer–Wempe]]. While they do not differ greatly, Jyutping and Yale are the two most used and taught systems today in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kataoka|first=Shin|last2=Lee|first2=Cream|date=2008|journal=Hong Kong Journal of Applied Linguistics|title=A System without a System: Cantonese Romanization Used in Hong Kong Place and Personal Names|pages=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Hong Kong linguist [[Sidney Lau]] [[Sidney Lau romanisation|modified the Yale system]] for his popular Cantonese-as-a-second-language course and is still in use today.

While the governments of [[Hong Kong Government Cantonese Romanisation|Hong Kong]] and [[Macau Government Cantonese Romanization|Macau]] utilize a romanization system for proper names and geographic locations, they are rather inconsistent for the some sounds and are not taught in schools. Furthermore, the system of Macau differs slightly from Hong Kong's in that the spellings are influenced by the [[Portuguese language]] due to colonial history. However, some words under Macau's romanization system are same as Hong Kong's (e.g. '''Lam''' 林, '''Chan''' 陳). Words with the alphabet "u" under Hong Kong's romanization systems are often replaced by "o" under Macao's romanization systems (e.g. '''Chau''' vs '''Chao''' 周, '''Leung''' vs '''Leong''' 梁). Both the spellings of Hong Kong and Macau Cantonese romanization systems do not look similar to the mainland China's pinyin system. Generally, plain stops are written with voiced consonants (/p/, /t/, /ts/, and /k/ as ''b'', ''d'', ''z/j'', and ''g'' respectively), and aspirated stops with unvoiced ones, as in [[pinyin]].

===Early Western effort===
Systematic efforts to develop an alphabetic representation of Cantonese began with the arrival of Protestant missionaries in China early in the nineteenth century. Romanization was considered both a tool to help new missionaries learn the variety more easily and a quick route for the unlettered to achieve gospel literacy. Earlier Catholic missionaries, mostly Portuguese, had developed romanization schemes for the pronunciation current in the court and capital city of China but made few efforts to romanize other varieties.

[[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Robert Morrison]], the first [[Protestant]] missionary in China published a "Vocabulary of the Canton Dialect" (1828) with a rather unsystematic romanized pronunciation. [[Elijah Coleman Bridgman]] and [[Samuel Wells Williams]] in their "Chinese Chrestomathy in the Canton Dialect" (1841) were the progenitors of a long-lived lineage of related romanizations with minor variations embodied in the works of [[James Dyer Ball]], [[Ernst Johann Eitel]], and [[Immanuel Gottlieb Genăhr]] (1910). Bridgman and Williams based their system on the phonetic alphabet and diacritics proposed by [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]] for South Asian languages.

Their romanization system embodied the phonological system in a local dialect rhyme dictionary, the ''Fenyun cuoyao'', which was widely used and easily available at the time and is still available today. Samuel Wells Willams' ''Tonic Dictionary of the Chinese Language in the Canton Dialect'' (''Yinghua fenyun cuoyao'' 1856), is an alphabetic rearrangement, translation and annotation of the ''Fenyun''. To adapt the system to the needs of users at a time when there were only local variants and no standard—although the speech of the western suburbs, ''Xiguan'', of Guangzhou was the prestige variety at the time—Williams suggested that users learn and follow their teacher's pronunciation of his chart of Cantonese syllables. It was apparently Bridgman's innovation to mark the tones with an open circle (upper register tones) or an underlined open circle (lower register tones) at the four corners of the romanized word in analogy with the traditional Chinese system of marking the tone of a character with a circle (lower left for "even," upper left for "rising," upper right for "going," and lower right for "entering" tones).

[[John Chalmers (missionary)|John Chalmers]], in his "English and Cantonese pocket-dictionary" (1859) simplified the marking of tones using the acute accent to mark "rising" tones and the grave to mark "going" tones and no diacritic for "even" tones and marking upper register tones by italics (or underlining in handwritten work). "Entering" tones could be distinguished by their consonantal ending. [[Nicholas Belfeld Dennys]] used Chalmers romanization in his primer. This method of marking tones was adopted in the Yale romanization (with low register tones marked with an 'h'). A new romanization was developed in the first decade of the twentieth century which eliminated the diacritics on vowels by distinguishing vowel quality by spelling differences (e.g. a/aa, o/oh). Diacritics were used only for marking tones.

The name of Tipson is associated with this new romanization which still embodied the phonology of the Fenyun to some extent. It is the system used in Meyer-Wempe and Cowles' dictionaries and O'Melia's textbook and many other works in the first half of the twentieth century. It was the standard romanization until the Yale system supplanted it. The distinguished linguist [[Yuen Ren Chao|Y. R. Chao]] developed a Cantonese adaptation of his [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]] system. The [[Barnett-Chao]] romanization system was first used in Chao's ''Cantonese Primer'', published in 1947 by Harvard University Press (The ''Cantonese Primer'' was adapted for Mandarin teaching and published by Harvard University Press in 1948 as ''Mandarin Primer''). The BC system was also used in textbooks published by the Hong Kong government.

===Cantonese romanization in Hong Kong===
{{Main|Hong Kong Government Cantonese Romanisation}}

An influential work on Cantonese, ''[[A Chinese Syllabary Pronounced According to the Dialect of Canton]],'' written by [[Wong Shik Ling]], was published in 1941. He derived an [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]-based transcription system, the [[S. L. Wong (phonetic symbols)|S. L. Wong system]], used by many Chinese dictionaries later published in Hong Kong. Although Wong also derived a romanization scheme, also known as the [[S. L. Wong (romanisation)|S. L. Wong system]], it is not widely used as his transcription scheme. This system was preceded by the [[Barnett–Chao]] system used by the Hong Government Language School.

The romanization advocated by the [[Linguistic Society of Hong Kong]] (LSHK) is called [[Jyutping]]. The phonetic values of some consonants are closer to the approximate equivalents in IPA than in other systems. Some effort has been undertaken to promote Jyutping, but the success of its proliferation within the region has yet to be examined.

Another popular scheme is [[Cantonese Pinyin]], which is the only romanization system accepted by [[Hong Kong Education and Manpower Bureau]] and [[Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority]]. Books and studies for teachers and students in primary and secondary schools usually use this scheme. But there are teachers and students who use the transcription system of S.L. Wong.

Despite the efforts to standardize Cantonese romanization, those learning the language may feel frustrated that most native Cantonese speakers, regardless of their level of education, are unfamiliar with any romanization system. Because Cantonese is primarily a spoken language and does not carry its own writing system (written Cantonese, despite having some Chinese characters unique to it, primarily follows modern standard Chinese, which is closely tied to Mandarin), it is not taught in schools.{{cn|date=September 2018}} As a result, locals do not learn any of these systems. In contrast with Mandarin-speaking areas of China, Cantonese romanization systems are excluded in the education systems of both Hong Kong and the Guangdong province. In practice, Hong Kong follows a loose, unnamed romanization scheme used by the [[Government of Hong Kong]].

Google Cantonese input uses Yale, Jyutping or Cantonese Pinyin, Yale being the first standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.inputmethod.cantonese&amp;hl=en|title=Google Cantonese Input|first=Google|last=LLC|date=28 August 2017|website=Play.google.com|accessdate=29 January 2018|via=Google Play}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com.hk/intl/zh-TW/landing/suggest/|title=廣東話拼音 – Google 搜尋建議|website=Google.com.hk|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loanwords==
{{Main|Hong Kong Cantonese}}
Life in Hong Kong is characterized by the blending of [[Asia]]n (mainly south [[China|Chinese]]), British and other Western influences, as well as the status of the city as a major international business centre. Influences from this territory are widespread in foreign cultures. As a result, many [[loanword]]s are created and exported to [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], and [[Singapore]]. Some of the loanwords are even more popular than their Chinese counterparts. At the same time, some new words created are vividly borrowed by other languages as well.

The '''Central and South New Guinea languages''' (CSNG) are a proposed [[language family|family]] of [[Trans–New Guinea languages]] (TNG). They were part of Voorhoeve &amp; McElhanon's original TNG proposal, but have been reduced in scope by half (nine families to four) in the classification of [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]]. According to Ross, it is not clear if the pronoun similarities between the four remaining branches of Central and South New Guinea are retentions for proto-TNG forms or shared innovations defining a single branch of TNG. Voorhoeve argues independently for an Awyu–Ok relationship, and Foley echoes that Asmat may be closest to Awyu and Ok of the TNG languages. Regardless, the four individual branches of reduced Central and South New Guinea are themselves clearly valid families.

* Central and South New Guinea (Asmat–Ok)
** '''[[Asmat–Kamoro languages|Asmat–Kamoro]]''' family [a recent expansion along the south coast]
** '''[[Greater Awyu languages|Greater Awyu]]''' family
** '''[[Mombum languages|Mombum]]''' family
** '''[[Ok–Oksapmin languages|Ok–Oksapmin]]''' family

''[[Ethnologue]]'' (2009) retains only Awyu–Dumut and Ok, calling the branch ''Ok–Awyu,'' and places Asmat and Mombum as independent branches of TNG. Loughnane &amp; Fedden (2011) link Ok to the [[Oksapmin language]].&lt;ref name=lough3&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07268602.2011.533635 Loughnane, Robyn and Fedden, Sebastian (2011) 'Is Oksapmin Ok?-A Study of the Genetic Relationship between Oksapmin and the Ok Languages', Australian Journal of Linguistics, 31: 1, 1-42.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, van den Heuvel &amp; Fedden (2014) argue that Greater Awyu and Greater Ok are not genetically related, but that their similarities are due to intensive contact.&lt;ref&gt;van den Heuvel, W. &amp; Fedden, S. (2014). Greater Awyu and Greater Ok: Inheritance or Contact? ''Oceanic Linguistics'' 53(1), 1-36. University of Hawai'i Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Somahai languages]] and the recently discovered [[Bayono-Awbono language|Bayono-Awbono]] may also belong here, but there is little data to go on.

==History==
In the mid 1960s, Alan Healey, a colleague of Laycock, noted connections between the Ok, Asmat, and Awyu–Dumut families. Voorhoeve (1968) expanded on this and coined the name CSNG; his proposal added [[Trans-Fly languages|Trans-Fly]] and [[Marind languages|Marind]] to the mix. Collaboration with McElhanon and his [[Finisterre–Huon languages|Finisterre–Huon]] family in 1970 found a connection between them, which was named Trans–New Guinea. Wurm's 1975 expansion of TNG also expanded CSNG, with the addition of [[Awin–Pa languages|Awin–Pa]], [[Bosavi languages|Bosavi]], [[Duna–Pogaya languages|Duna–Pogaya]], [[East Strickland languages|East Strickland]], [[Mombum languages|Mombum]], and [[Momuna languages|Momuna]]. Ross's recension in 2005 retained nothing from Voorhoeve and only Mombum from Wurm, though the Momuna languages were too sparsely attested for him to classify.

[[File:Charles Weissmann.jpg|thumbnail|Charles Weissmann (1982)]]
'''Charles Weissmann''' (born 14 October 1931) is a Hungarian-born [[Swiss people|Swiss]] molecular biologist. Weissmann is particularly known for the first cloning and expression of [[interferon]] and his contributions to the unraveling of the molecular genetics of neurogenerative [[prion]] diseases such as [[scrapie]], [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] and "[[mad cow disease]]".

Weissmann went to [[University of Zurich]] and obtained his MD in 1956 and Ph.D. in [[Organic Chemistry]] in 1961. In 1978, Weissmann co-founded the biotech company [[Biogen]] in [[Geneva]]. Biogen is considered one of the pioneers of the [[biotechnology]] industries. Weissmann was director of the Institute for Molecular Biology in Zurich, President of the [[Roche Research Foundation]] and co-founder and Member of the Scientific Council of Biogen. He was Chairman of the Department of Infectology, [[Scripps Florida]] until 2011.

Weissmann won several awards, including the [[Otto Warburg Medal]] (1980) and the [[Scheele Award]] (1982). A member of the [[American Society of Biological Chemistry]] and the [[Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina]] he is also a Foreign Associate of the U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]], the [[Royal Society]] (UK) and the [[Pour le Mérite]] (Germany). On May 16, 2011 Weissmann became Doctor of Science Honoris Causa at New York University.

The '''Codex Totomixtlahuaca''' or '''Codex Condumex''' is a colonial-era map produced on a large piece of [[cotton]]. The map represents Totomixlahuaca, [[Mexico]], and includes a creation date of 1564. It documents a meeting over a land conflict in communities of the current Mexican state of [[Guerrero]].

== Description ==
The ''Codex Totomixtlahuaca'' was found in the community of Totomixtlahuaca, located in the southeast of Guerrero, in [[Mexico]]. Using Aztec [[pictogram|pictographs]], the map represents the distribution of lands in 1564.&lt;ref name="wdl" /&gt;

== Preparation ==
The map was drawn on a large piece of cotton, roughly 217&amp;nbsp;cm by 185&amp;nbsp;cm. It was painted with coal.&lt;ref name="cehm" /&gt;

'''Creamy layer''' is a term used in [[Politics of India|Indian politics]] to refer to the relatively forward  and better educated members of the [[Other Backward Class]]es (OBCs),who are not eligible for government-sponsored educational and professional benefit programs. The term was introduced by the ''Sattanathan Commission'' in 1971, which directed that the "creamy layer" should be excluded from the [[Reservation in India|reservations]] (quotas) of civil posts.

The creamy layer (income) criteria were defined as annual family income from all sources  more than 100,000 rupees (₹ or INR, together abbreviated ''Rs 1 [[lakh]]'') per ''annum'' in 1993, and revised to  ₹ 2.5 lakh (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/income-ceiling-for-creamy-layer-raised-to-rs-4-5-lakh-108100300047_1.html| title=Income ceiling for creamy layer raised to Rs 4.5 lakh |publisher=Business Standard |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; then ₹ 4.5 lakh (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/oct/03quota.htm |title=Centre raises OBC creamy layer criteria to Rs 4.5 lakhs|publisher=Reddiff News |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rs 6 lakh (2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/income-limit-of-creamy-layer-hiked-to-rs-6-lakh-per-annum-522427 |title=Income limit of 'creamy layer' hiked to Rs. 6 lakh per annum |publisher=NDTV |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GhildiyalTOI150505"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ghildiyal, Subodh | year =  2015 | title=Raise ‘creamy layer’ to Rs 10.5 lakh: OBC panel | journal =The Times of India | format = online | issue = 5 May | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Raise-creamy-layer-to-Rs-10-5-lakh-OBC-panel/articleshow/47155884.cms | access-date=26 February 2016 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rs 8 lakh (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/obc-creamy-layer-income-limit-raised-to-8-lakh-per-annum/article19677545.ece/amp/|title=OBC creamy layer income limit raised to ₹8 lakh per annum|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, the [[National Commission for Backward Classes]] (NCBC&lt;ref name="NCBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbc.nic.in/Writereaddata/dopteng.pdf|title=Office Memorandum regarding the revision of criterion for Creamy Layer|last=Page no 8 ; points 8,9,10|first=|date=|work=Department of Personnel and Training|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) proposed that a person belonging to OBC with an annual family income of up to Rs 15 lakh should be considered as the minimum ceiling for OBC.&lt;ref name="GhildiyalTOI151027"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ghildiyal, Subodh | year =  2015 | title=OBC panel backs off, won't make ‘creamy layer’ reservation criteria stringent | journal =The Times of India | format = online | issue = 27 October | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/OBC-panel-backs-off-wont-make-creamy-layer-reservation-criteria-stringent/articleshow/49545470.cms? | access-date=26 February 2016 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCBC also recommended the sub-division of OBCs into 'backward', 'more backward', and 'extremely backward' blocs and divide 27% quota amongst them in proportion to their population, to ensure that stronger OBCs don't corner the quota benefits.&lt;ref name="GhildiyalTOI150505" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GhildiyalTOI151026"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ghildiyal, Subodh | year =  2015 | title=OBC sub-division, relaxing creamy layer is a must: NCBC tells govt | journal =The Times of India | format = online | issue = 26 October | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/OBC-sub-division-relaxing-creamy-layer-is-a-must-NCBC-tells-govt/articleshow/49532421.cms | access-date=26 February 2016 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'creamy layer' categorization was meant only for the OBCs until 30 September 2018 but now are also applied to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes but not on economic basis rather on the basis of untouchability or backwardness.Applied only in reservations in promotion and rest remain the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/india/sc-order-government-in-a-bind-on-sc/st-creamy-layer/articleshow/66021353.cms|title=‘Inclusion of Creamy layer in SC/ST’ |publisher=The Times of India |year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United States criminal law]], a '''custodial interrogation''' (or, generally, '''custodial situation''') is a situation in which the suspect's freedom of movement is restrained, even if he is not under arrest. 
==History==
Per ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'', 384 U.S. 436, 444 (1966), "custodial interrogation [refers to] questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or ''otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way''."  The United States Supreme Court has clarified that a person is being subjected to a custodial interrogation if "a reasonable person would have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave."  ''[[Thompson v. Keohane]]'', 516 U.S. 99, 112 (1995).  This test is objective and thus does not depend on the individual suspect's subjective mindset, age, or previous personal experience with law enforcement.  ''[[Yarborough v. Alvarado]]'', 541 U.S. 652, 666-69 (2004).  Rather, the ultimate inquiry is whether a normal, reasonable person would feel free to end the encounter with law enforcement and leave the scene. However, [[J.D.B. v North Carolina]] states that a child's age properly informs the Miranda analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15947">This article is about the '''[[demographics]] of [[Barbados]]''', including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

==Population==
[[Image:Barbados population.svg|thumb|450px|Barbados' population (1960-2010).]]
[[Image:Barbados population pyramid 2005.png|thumb|450px|Barbados' [[population pyramid]], showing the population's age structure.]]
At the 2010 census Barbados had an estimated population of 277,821.&lt;ref name="2010 census"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barstats.gov.bb/files/documents/PHC_2010_Census_Volume_1.pdf|format=PDF|title=2010 POPULATION AND HOUSING CENSUS|website=Barstats.gov.bb|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tabulated population was only 226,193 due to a high undercount (estimated at 18%).
The estimated population of {{UN_Population|Year}} is {{UN_Population|Barbados}} ({{UN_Population|source}}).

==Race==
{{main|Barbadian people}}
The population of Barbados is predominantly [[Afro-Barbadian|black]] (92.4%) or mixed (3.1%).&lt;ref name="2010 census"/&gt; 2.7% of the population is white and 1.3% South Asian. The remaining 0.4% of the population includes East Asians (0.1%) and Middle Easterners (0.1%).

==Languages==
English is the [[official language]] of Barbados, and is used for communications, administration, and public services all over the island. In its capacity as the official language of the country, the standard of English tends to conform to the vocabulary, pronunciations, spellings, and conventions akin to, but not exactly the same as, those of [[British English]].

A regional variant of English referred to locally as [[Bajan Creole|Bajan]] is spoken by most Barbadians in everyday life especially in informal settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/country/BB/languages|title=Barbados|website=Ethnologue.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its full-fledged form, Bajan sounds markedly different from the Standard English heard on the island. The degree of intelligibility between Bajan and general English depends on the level of creolised vocabulary and idioms. A Bajan speaker may be completely unintelligible to an English speaker from another country. Bajan is influenced by other [[Caribbean English]] dialects.

There was no indigenous language on Barbados.

==Religion==
{{main|Religion in Barbados}}
According to the 2010 census, 75.6% of the population of Barbados are considered [[Christianity|Christian]], 2.6% have a non-Christian religion and 20.6% have no religion.&lt;ref name="2010 census"/&gt;

[[Anglicanism]] constitutes the largest religious group, with 23.9% of the population. It is represented by the [[Church in the Province of the West Indies]], within which the island belongs to the [[Diocese of Barbados]]. [[Pentecostals]] are the second largest group (19.5%). 

The next largest group are [[Seventh-day Adventists]], 5.9% of the population, followed by [[Methodists#Caribbean|Methodists]] (4.2%). 3.8% of the population are [[Roman Catholics]].  Other Christians include [[Wesleyans]] (3.4%), [[Church of the Nazarene|Nazarene]]s (3.2%), Church of God (2.4%), [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (2.0%), [[Baptists]] (1.8), [[Moravian Church|Moravians]] (1.2%), [[Brethren Christian]] (0.5%), the [[Salvation Army|Salvationists]] (0.4%) and [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saints]] ( 0.1%).

The number of non-Christians is small. 0.7% of the population are [[Islam in Barbados|Muslims]], most of whom are immigrants or descendants of [[Indo-Caribbean|Indian immigrants]] from the [[India]]n [[States of India|state]] of [[Gujarat]]. There are three [[mosques]] and an Islamic centre. Other religious groups include the [[Rastafarian movement|Rastafarians]] (1.0% of the population), which was introduced to Barbados in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v2yiyLLOj88C&amp;pg=PA304&amp;lpg=PA304&amp;dq=first+mosque+barbados&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Zj7Wxkha3z&amp;sig=y-pI-1n6G84e9DonmfwSUxj1ABU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=exT_T76ROIHv0gGQ9vyDBw&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=first+mosque+barbados&amp;f=false|title=Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices, 2nd Edition [6 volumes]: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices|first1=J.

Although [[Haiti]] averages approximately 255 people per square kilometer (650 per sq. mi.), its [[population]] is concentrated most heavily in [[urban area]]s, [[coastal plain]]s, and [[valley]]s. The majority of Haitians, 95%, are of predominantly African descent.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ha.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=Cia.gov|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining of the population is primarily [[mulatto]]es,  Europeans, Asians and Arabs. Hispanic residents in Haiti are mostly [[Cuba]]n and [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]].  About two thirds of the Haitian population live in [[rural]] areas.

Although there was a national census taken in Haiti in 2003, much of that data has not been released to the public. Several demographic studies, including those by social work researcher [[Athena Kolbe]], have shed light on the current status of urban residents. In 2006, households averaged 4.5 members. The median age was 25 years with a mean average age of 27 years. People aged 15 and younger counted for roughly a third of the population. Overall, 52.7 percent of the population was female.&lt;ref name="Kolbe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kolbe|first=Athena R.|author2=Royce A.

While limited, evidence suggests that disasters can cause human populations to increase in the long term, rather than decrease. Documented fertility spikes followed the Khmer Rouge conflict and 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami - potential causes may include reduced access to contraception and families desiring more children following child death.&lt;ref&gt;Frankenberg, Laurito &amp; Thomas, Duke University, 2014, [https://ipl.econ.duke.edu/dthomas/docs/ppr/14Jun-Disaster.pdf The Demography of Disasters]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Haiti's case, the fertility rate nearly tripled after the quake, and is likely to remain elevated (above pre-quake levels) for long after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20101022/news/news1.html|title=Haiti's rate of fertility tripled - report|website=jamaica-gleaner.com|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==
[[Taíno language|Taíno]] was the major pre-Columbian language in the region of what is ''Haiti'' (or ''Hayti''), a name rooted in the language to refer to the entire island of [[Hispaniola]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guitar|first1=Lynne|last2=Ferbel-Azcárate|first2=Pedro|last3=Estevez|first3=Jorge|title=Indigenous Resurgence in the Contemporary Caribbean|date=2006|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|location=New York|isbn=0-8204-7488-6|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qXZeQZMDpgYC&amp;pg=PA41|accessdate=10 July 2015|chapter=iii: Ocama-Daca Taíno (Hear me, I am Taíno)|lccn=2005012816}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edmond|first1=Louisket|title=The Tears of Haiti|date=2010|publisher=[[Xlibris]]|location=|isbn=978-1-4535-1770-3|page=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_1wDXEB1fOUC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=ayiti+bohio+kiskeya|accessdate=10 July 2015|lccn=2010908468}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Senauth|first1=Frank|title=The Making and Destruction of Haiti|date=2011|publisher=[[AuthorHouse]]|location=Bloomington, Indiana, USA|isbn=978-1-4567-5384-9|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QBdccuwnqY8C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=ayiti+bohio+kiskeya|lccn=2011907203}}&lt;/ref&gt; to mean, "land of high mountains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HOE8AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA321&amp;dq=Dessalines+haiti+indian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIp-bwqdjwxwIVTG4-Ch3_OQGR#v=onepage&amp;q=Dessalines%20haiti%20indian&amp;f=false |title=A Dictionary of Dates Relating to All Ages and Nations: For Universal Reference Comprehending Remarkable Occurrences, Ancient and Modern, The Foundation, Laws, and Governments of Countries-Their Progress In Civilization, Industry, Arts and Science-Their Achievements In Arms-And Their Civil, Military, And Religious Institutions, And Particularly of the British Empire |page=321 |author1=Haydn, Joseph |author2=Vincent, Benjamin |year=1860 |accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Republic of Haiti has two official languages. They are [[French language|French]] and [[Haitian Creole]]; the latter, a French-based [[Creole language|creole]] where 90% of its vocabulary is derived from, with influences from Portuguese, Spanish, Taíno, and West African languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bonenfant|first=Jacques L.|title=History of Haitian-Creole: From Pidgin to Lingua Franca and English Influence on the Language|url=http://www.fmuniv.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/History_of_haitian_review_of_higher_education.pdf|editor=Haggerty, Richard A. |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]]|date=December 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; French is the principal written and administratively authorized language (as well as the main language of the press) and is spoken by 42% of Haitians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=La langue française dans le monde 2014|date=2014|publisher=Nathan|isbn=978-2-09-882654-0|url=http://www.francophonie.org/Langue-Francaise-2014/projet/Rapport-OIF-2014.pdf|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;À ce propos, voir l'essai ''Prétendus Créolismes : le couteau dans l'igname'', Jean-Robert Léonidas, Cidihca, Montréal 1995&lt;/ref&gt; It is spoken by most educated Haitians, is the medium of instruction in most schools, and is used in the business sector. It is also used in ceremonial events such as weddings, graduations and church masses.

Haiti is one of two independent nations in the Americas (along with Canada) to designate French as an [[official language]]; the other French-speaking areas are all [[French overseas departments and territories|overseas]] ''[[Departments of France|départements]]'', or ''[[Overseas collectivity|collectivités]],'' of France. Haitian Creole,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~creole/creolenatllangofhaiti.html |title=Creole: The National Language of Haiti |author=Valdman, Albert |journal=Footsteps|volume= 2|issue=4|pages= 36–39 |publisher=Indiana University Creole Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has recently undergone a standardization, is spoken by virtually the entire population of Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~creole/creolenatllangofhaiti.html |title=creolenationallanguageofhaiti |publisher= [[Indiana University]] |accessdate= 11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to the other [[French-based creole languages|French creoles]], but most closely to [[Antillean Creole]] and [[Louisiana Creole French|Louisiana Creole]] variants.

Spanish, though not official, is spoken by a growing amount of the population, and is spoken more frequently near the border with the [[Dominican Republic]]. [[English language|English]] is increasingly spoken among the young and in the business sector.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Religion==
{{main article|Religion in Haiti|Haitian Vodou}}
The state religion is [[Roman Catholicism]] which 80–85% of the population professes. 15–20% of Haitians practice [[Protestantism]]. Only a very  small percentage of the population practice [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]], mostly along with another religion.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;The main religions practiced in Haiti are Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, Islam, and Judaism. In addition, the protestant population is continuing to grow, along with Islam and Judaism. The Islam population usually goes uncounted for and has links to the slave trade. Almost 99% of Haitians claim at least one religion, with many practicing some part of voodoo. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/religious-beliefs-in-haiti.html|title=Religious Beliefs In Haiti|work=WorldAtlas|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voodoo is rare among the urban elite and is often compared to Cuban [[Santería|Santeria]] due to the large Cuban population in Haiti. &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/religious-beliefs-in-haiti.html|title=Religious Beliefs In Haiti|work=WorldAtlas|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of voodoo revolves around family spirits called ''Loua'' that protect children. To repay the spirits, children perform two ceremonies where the ''Loua'' are given gifts like food and drinks. That does depend of the monetary status of these families, poorer families wait until there is a need to perform the rituals. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/haiti/33.htm|title=Haiti - RELIGION|website=countrystudies.us|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voodoo in relation to Christianity came along two different paths, the path with the Catholics and the path with the protestants. For the Catholic path; under the French the slaves were not allowed to practice [[Haitian Vodou|Voodoo]], but they were allowed to occasionally have dances on the weekend. These dances turned out to be Voodoo services, until they were liberated in 1804. Most Haitians see practicing Voodoo and Christianity as normal due to the many components they share. The catholic church wasn't always as accepting of Voodoo as it is now, in 1941-1942 a [[Religious war|holy war]] was waged against Voodoo killing many of the higher ups in the Voodoo religion. This war ended around 1950 when the Catholics decided give up the prosecution of those who practiced Voodoo and to have a relative peace. The path with the protestants was less peaceful. The Protestants came to Haiti in 1970 and since then they have been bitter enemies of Voodoo, most often calling it [[Theistic Satanism|devil worship]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.webster.edu/corbetre/haiti/voodoo/overview.htm|title=Haiti: Introduction to Voodoo|website=faculty.webster.edu|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
{{main article|Education in Haiti}}
Although [[public education]] at the primary level is now free, [[Private school|private]] and [[Parochial school|parochial]] schools provide around 75% of educational programs offered.

In recent years, several annual literacy campaigns launched in by the Martelly administration has increased overall literacy among adults in Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-12003-haiti-social-the-fight-against-illiteracy-one-of-the-government-s-priorities.htm |title=Haiti – Social : The fight against illiteracy, one of the Government's priorities|website=Haitilibre.com|date=September 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] projects an overall literacy rate of 61.1% in Haiti by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/literacy-statistics-trends-1985-2015.pdf|title= "Literacy Statistics trends 1985–2015"|format=PDF|website=Uis.unesco.org|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of December 2014, [[World bank]] has reported that school enrollment has increased from 78% to 90% in Haiti, very close to the goal of universal child enrollment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2014/12/11/haiti-the-day-that-the-news-were-good |title=Extreme poverty drops in Haiti. Is it sustainable?|website=Worldbank.org |date= 4 December 2014 |accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labor==
In 2004, 300,000 children were [[restavec]]s, the practice of which is comparable to [[indentured service]] of minors.&lt;ref name = Cohen&gt;{{cite web | last = Cohen | first = Gigi | date = 2004-03-24 | title = Haiti's Dark secret:The Restavecs | publisher = National Public Radio | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1779562 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emigration==
Large-scale [[emigration]], principally to the Dominican Republic, [[United States]], and [[Canada]] (predominantly to [[Quebec]], with other areas of the country) – but also to [[Cuba]], other areas of Europe and the Americas (like [[Argentina]]) such as [[France]] (with [[French Guiana]]), [[Spain]], [[Belgium]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]; and [[Venezuela]], [[Brazil]], the [[Bahamas]] and other [[Caribbean]] neighbors – has created what Haitians refer to as the Eleventh Department or the [[Diaspora]]. About one of every six Haitians live abroad.

== History ==
Egyptians began to migrate to the U.S. in significant numbers in the second half of the twentieth century. The majority of Egyptians left their country for economic or educational reasons. However, many emigrated because they were concerned about the political developments that were occurring in Egypt after the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]]. Thousands of Egyptians, mainly Copts, left Egypt in 1967 after its defeat in the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967. From 1967 to 1977, more than 15,000 Egyptians immigrated to the United States alone. Since the 1981 assassination of Anwar Sadat and consequential inauguration of Hosni Mubarak as the President, the Egyptian economy has endured three decades of economic stagnation that has prompted a significant number of Egyptians to emigrate to more prosperous countries, such as the United States. Attracted by the higher standards of living and greater civil liberties, Egyptian expatriates have traditionally favoured permanent residence in countries such as the United States, and Canada, but sizeable numbers are also present in Australia, Italy, the United Kingdom, France, and [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]. The first wave of Egyptian immigrants to the United States were mostly educated professionals and skilled workers. Egyptian immigration to the United States was further eased by the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which allowed selective entry of certain professionals, especially scientists, from countries such as Egypt, which was up until then subjected to stringent emigration restrictions. As a result, most Egyptian Americans, especially first and second generation Egyptians, have in comparison, become generally very well educated relative to the American population as a whole.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Du-Ha/Egyptian-Americans.html|title=Egyptian Americans - History, Significant immigration waves, Acculturation and Assimilation, Cuisine, Traditional clothing|publisher=everyculture.com|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They followed the Iraqis who accounted for 221,587 foreign-born individuals. After the Iraqi and Egyptian foreign-born populations, the Lebanese foreign-born population in the United States represented 128,608 first-generation immigrants in 2016. Although the Lebanese foreign-born population was the leading Arab immigrant population in the US from 1960 till the 1990s, the Egyptian foreign-born population took the lead at the start of the millennium increasing in more than ten times its size of 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_16_1YR_S0201&amp;prodType=table|title=American FactFinder - Results|last=Bureau|first=U.S. Census|website=factfinder.census.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[US Census Bureau]] data, around 123,489 people self-reported [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] ancestry alone and a further 19,343 people self-reported Egyptian ancestry in combination with another ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We the People of Arab Ancestry in the United States|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2005pubs/censr-21.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, Department of Commerce|accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following consultations with [[MENA]] organizations, the Census Bureau also announced in 2014 that it would offer a new MENA ethnic option for populations from the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and the [[Arab world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Comments to NCT Federal Register Notice|url=https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/programs-surveys/decennial/2020-census/2015_census_tests/nct/2015-nct-frn.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, Department of Commerce|accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Egyptians in the United States live in the [[New York City]]–Northern [[New Jersey]]–[[Long Island]] area (39,020). The next largest concentrations of Egyptians are in [[Los Angeles]]–[[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]]–[[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]] (19,170), [[Washington, D.C.]]–[[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]]–[[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] (5,770), [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]–[[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson]]–[[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]]–[[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]] (3,865), [[Chicago]]–[[Joliet, Illinois|Joliet]]–[[Naperville, Illinois|Naperville]] (3,705), [[Riverside, California|Riverside]]–[[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]]–[[Ontario, California|Ontario]] (3,630), [[Miami]]–[[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]]–[[Pompano Beach, Florida|Pompano Beach]] (3,625), [[Philadelphia]]–[[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]]–[[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]] (3,280), [[Houston]]–[[Sugar Land, Texas|Sugar Land]]–[[Baytown, Texas|Baytown]] (2,820), [[San Francisco]]–[[Oakland, California|Oakland]]–[[Fremont, California|Fremont]] (2,745), and other areas (55,455).&lt;ref name=Popborn /&gt;

== Predominant means of entry ==
In the total foreign-born Egyptian population of 2016, 67% were naturalized US citizens. A majority of 32 % of foreign-born Egyptians in 2016 gained legal permanent resident (LPR) status as immediate relatives of US citizens, the primary means of entry for most US foreign-born populations. Therefore, social networks through familial ties remain the primary means of entry for Egyptians obtaining LPR status, nonetheless, almost as many, precisely 29%, enter through Section 203(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2016|title=Yearbook 2016|date=2017-05-16|publisher=Department of Homeland Security|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diversity immigrants come from countries with historically low rates of immigration to the US and applicants are required to have an educational or professional background.

In 2016, the third major channel of obtaining LPR status in the US for Egyptian first-generation immigrants were as refugees and asylees. The share of the Egyptian foreign-born population obtaining LPR status as refugees or asylees was at 23% in 2016. These figures were particularly high following the 2011 uprisings and post-revolutionary period in Egypt. Specifically, 2,571 foreign-born Egyptians were affirmatively granted asylum status in 2012 compared to 751 in 2011. Nevertheless, these numbers decreased to 690 affirmative asylum status in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2016|title=Yearbook 2016|date=2017-05-16|work=Department of Homeland Security|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religions ==
In contrast to the population of Egypt, where Muslims constitute approximately 90% of the population, the majority of Egyptian Americans are [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christians]], with Muslims forming a minority in the community.&lt;ref name="multiple2"/&gt; The [[Copts]] began to immigrate to the United States as early as the late 1940s. There are hundreds of Coptic Orthodox churches in the United States (along with over 90 congregations in [[Canada]]). It is estimated that there are over one million Coptic Orthodox Christians in North America as a whole. A small number of Egyptian Christians who immigrated to the U.S. include [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic Catholics]] and [[Protestants]]. In addition to Coptic Christians, there are also small groups of non-native Christians from Egypt, such as [[Armenians in Egypt|Armenians]], [[Greeks of Egypt|Greeks]], and [[Syro-Lebanese in Egypt|Syro-Lebanese]], who belong to [[Armenian Apostolic|Armenian]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], or [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkite Catholic]] churches. There is even a small [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Jewish]] community that exists, due to Egypt's expulsion of its Jewish community in the late 1950s.

== Socioeconomic status ==
The first immigrants of Egypt that arrived in United States were mainly university graduates, and some Egyptians who had come seeking further education. Among these immigrants were doctors, accountants, engineers, lawyers and even teachers from major universities. The second wave had university degrees, but had to accept menial jobs (many of them drove taxicabs, or waited on tables in restaurants). Some citizens even became entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;

The Egyptian foreign-born population in the US is characterized by a relatively high educational status and professional attainment in comparison to the total US population.

In 2016, Egyptian first-generation immigrants were more than twice as likely to have a bachelor’s degree in comparison to the total US population and 20% received a graduate or professional degree versus 12.3% of the US population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=CF|title=American FactFinder - Results|last=Bureau|first=U.S. Census|website=factfinder.census.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This high level of educational attainment may be part of a wider phenomenon of skilled Egyptian migration to the US. In other words, the high rates of unemployment for educated young people in Egypt versus the educational and professional opportunities in the US make immigration an appealing alternative. This is especially true in periods of political uncertainty like the 1970s or following the 2011 uprisings in Egypt. Furthermore, since many Egyptian immigrants enter the US through the [[Diversity Immigrant Visa]] Program which requires a certain educational level, it is understandable that immigration policies have also pushed the more educated Egyptians to migrate to the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/select-diaspora-populations-united-states|title=Select Diaspora Populations in the United States|date=2014-07-21|work=migrationpolicy.org|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning occupational differences, the Egyptian foreign-born population and the American populace do not showcase startling divergences. Yet in 2016 estimates by the US Census Bureau, both groups tended to contrast at the more extreme ends of the professional market. Indeed, Egyptian first-generation immigrants in 2016 outnumbered the US population in the management, business, science and arts occupations. Nearly 50% of the Egyptian foreign-born population was employed in these occupations whereas 37% of the US population was represented in these sectors. On the other hand, the share of Egyptian immigrants in the natural resources, construction and maintenance occupations represented under 4% of the Egyptian foreign-born population while almost 9% of the American population appeared in this sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=CF|title=American FactFinder - Results|last=Bureau|first=U.S. Census|website=factfinder.census.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relations with Egypt ==
Recently the Egyptian government has ramped up efforts to increase ties with its expatriate community, as it seeks to capitalize on the possibility of increased foreign direct investment, and multilateral business by wealthy Egyptians abroad. The Egyptian government has actively been encouraging investment in its economy, and views the Egyptians diaspora as an important source of income through remittances sent home to family members. Over the past few years, the Egyptian American Businessmen's Association has maintained a continual presence in Egypt, with representative delegates visiting Egypt on a regular basis and meeting with officials as well as conversing with local MPs on various economic matters. The Union of Egyptians is an organization created with the primary aim of meeting Egyptian needs abroad by securing economic links with the homeland. Several organizations also prefer focusing on educational and cultural ties between Egyptian Americans and their home country.

In 2001 [http://www.uuee.org Universal Union of Egyptian Expatriates] was created in order to help Egyptian Expatriates. Today, more than 6 million Egyptians live, work and study abroad are connected. A fair percentage of Egyptian Expatriates settled in the USA. Almost 70–75% of Egyptian Expatriates holding the membership of the [http://www.uuee.org UUEE] are Muslims and 25–30% are Coptic.

On February 11, 2012, a coalition of American Egyptians from around the United States launched a new advocacy organization, the American Egyptian Strategic Alliance.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;

The ''feedback provider'' and the ''feedback consumer'' are the two formal endpoints of the feedback loop (blue arrow).  Senders need to subscribe, possibly using a web form similar to the one depicted on the upper left corner, in order to become feedback consumers. Recipients typically click a ''spam'' button on a web mail page to start the process.]]

A '''feedback loop''' ('''FBL'''), sometimes called a '''complaint feedback loop''', is an inter-organizational form of [[feedback]] by which a [[mailbox provider]] (MP) forwards the complaints originating from their users to the sender's organizations. MPs can receive users' complaints by placing ''report spam'' buttons on their [[webmail]] pages, or in their [[email client]], or via [[help desk]]s. The message sender's [[organization]], often an [[mailbox provider|email service provider]], has to come to an agreement with each MP from which they want to collect users' complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Complaint Feedback Loop Operational Recommendations |rfc=6449 |editor=J.D. Falk |year=2011 |month=November |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feedback loops are one of the ways for [[spam reporting|reporting spam]].  Whether and how to provide an FBL is a choice of the MP.  End users should report abuse at their mailbox provider's reporting hub, so as to also help filtering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/asrg/current/msg15780.html |title=Adding a spam button to MUAs |author=[[John R. Levine]] |date=9 December 2009 |work=mail |publisher=[[Anti-Spam Research Group|ASRG]] |accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As an alternative, competent users may send abuse complaints directly, acting as mailbox providers themselves.

== Rationale ==

Marketers striving for their mail to be delivered have a twofold advantage: they can remove subscribers that don't want to receive that kind of advertising ([[listwashing]]), and they can analyze the complaint rate and hence how their advertising meets market expectations. By unsubscribing users who complain, marketers reduce their overall complaint rate per IP or domain, ensuring that targeted mail is much more likely to reach subscribers who actually want to receive it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306033428/http://www.emailmanual.co.uk/?p=98 |archive-date=6 March 2012 |dead-url=unfit |url=http://www.emailmanual.co.uk/?p=98 |title=What are feedback loops (fbl's) and how can they help my deliverability? |accessdate=15 July 2009 |publisher=Email Manual |date=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Email service provider (marketing)|ESPs]], when playing the sender's role, are very sensitive to how sending mail on behalf of their customers may affect their reputation. Monitoring the complaint rate is one of the ways they can control what their users are sending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.returnpath.com/wp-content/uploads/resource/your-reputation-holds-the-key-to-deliverability/deliverability_081508.pdf |title=Your Reputation Holds the Key to Deliverability |date=2008-08-18 |publisher=ReturnPath |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511031422/http://www.returnpath.com/wp-content/uploads/resource/your-reputation-holds-the-key-to-deliverability/deliverability_081508.pdf |archive-date=11 May 2013 |dead-url=yes |access-date=16 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===One-click unsubscription===

A weakness of FBL is its relative asynchrony, which can produce glitches.  A possibly large time interval sits between ESP subscription to an FBL and a recipient clicking the junk button.  The interval between that click and actual deletion of the recipient name from the list is much shorter, but may be noteworthy in the case of huge mailbox providers such as [[Gmail]] or [[AOL]].  Bulk messages can provide information on how to unsubscribe directly, in the header fields &lt;code&gt;List-Unsubscribe:&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;List-Unsubscribe-Post:&lt;/code&gt;.  Besides providing a more direct, better way to unsubscribe, that also allows to tell apart unsubscription from junk reporting (for example, one can report that a message posted to a discussion list is junk, while staying subscribed.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circleid.com/posts/20170126_one_click_unsubscription/ |author=[[John Levine]] |title=One-Click Unsubscribe |website=Circle Id |date=27 January 2017}} The author explains {{IETF RFC|8058}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reporting process ==

# Spencer sends a message to Alice.
# Alice complains to Isaac (her ISP or MP) about the message, e.g. by hitting the ''report spam'' button.
# Isaac encapsulates the message as either an [[Abuse Reporting Format]] [[MIME]] part, or (less commonly) a standalone message/rfc822 [[MIME]] part, and sends it to Spencer if Spencer has signed up to receive that feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irtf.org/pipermail/asrg/2008-November/003611.html |title=FeedBack loops |accessdate=18 November 2008 |author=J.D. Falk |date=2008-11-11 |work=[[Anti-Spam Research Group|ASRG]] mailing list |publisher=[[Internet Research Task Force|IRTF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As sketched above, the process implies that Spencer, besides being the author (or sender) of the message, is connected to the postmaster responsible for his mail domain.  Subscribing to an FBL usually involves the postmaster's authorization.  An FBL subscriber may or may not forward abuse reports to the relevant authors.  If no subscribers exist for a given mail domain, Isaac can omit sending an abuse report at all.  In fact, subscriptions have to be done one by one, a laborious task that mail domains not engaged in mass mailing may want to skip.  {{IETF RFC|6650}} addresses the latter shortcoming by proposing auto-subscribe just-in-time FBLs, which can be started by sending an ''unsolicited abuse report'' with further directives (at a minimum, a way to unsubscribe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Creation and Use of Email Feedback Reports: An Applicability Statement for the Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) |rfc=6650 |editor=Murray Kucherawy |year=2012 |month=June |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=28 June 2012 |quote=Feedback Providers MUST provide a way for report recipients to request that no further reports be sent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ipsos]] noted that a majority of respondents to a survey on spam reporting marked messages as spam based solely on the subject and sender data.

For years, end users have been told not to trust email unsubscribe links, so many users hit the spam button as an alternative to unsubscribing.&lt;ref name="clickz3623337"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clickz.com/showPage.html?page=3623337 |title=Getting in the Feedback Loop |accessdate=16 November 2008 |author=Derek Harding |date=2006-09-07 |publisher=ClikZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, ''report spam'' may act as unsubscribe in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irtf.org/pipermail/asrg/2008-November/003647.html |title=FeedBack loops |accessdate=18 November 2008 |author=[[John Levine]] |date=2008-11-13 |work=[[Anti-Spam Research Group|ASRG]] mailing list |publisher=[[Internet Research Task Force|IRTF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons not to hit unsubscribe links is to avoid confirming that the message had been received and opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spamhaus.org/removelists.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309002609/http://www.spamhaus.org/removelists.html |archivedate=2009-03-09 |title=Spam Unsubscribe Services |accessdate=16 November 2008 |publisher=[[The Spamhaus Project]] |date=2007-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reporting formats ==

The ''[[Abuse Reporting Format]]'' (ARF) is the standard format for FBL reports.  Much like [[bounce message]]s, whose design is inherited by ARF, an abuse report consists of a human readable part, followed by a machine readable part, and the original message. The report is characterized by a ''Feedback-Type'' field whose values may indicate one of ''abuse'', ''fraud'', ''virus'', or ''other'' (more types are registered at [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]]).

Microsoft, who use the name ''Junk Mail Reporting'' (JMR), also use their own format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mail.live.com/mail/services.aspx |title=Services for Senders and ISPs |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google's Gmail is beta testing a non-traditional FBL with select ESPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maawg.org/members/meetings_archives |title=Best Practices for Senders: A Gmail Perspective (slides 47, 48)  |date=2014-02-20 |publisher=[[Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group|MAAWG]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gmail uses their own format—an aggregate report that reveals spam rate per notable sender. [[SendGrid]] reports that the Gmail FBL, developed and launched by  Julian Tempelsman and Sri Somanchi, is effective at identifying spam that other anti-spam systems miss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sendgrid.com/blog/gmails-spam-feedback-loop-sendgrids-experience/ |title=Gmail's Spam Feedback Loop: SendGrid's First-hand Experience |publisher=[[SendGrid]] |date=2014-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{criticism section|date=May 2014}}
* The ''report spam'' button is said by some to often be used improperly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irtf.org/pipermail/asrg/2008-November/003650.html |title=FeedBack loops |accessdate=16 November 2008 |author=Rich Kulawiec |date=2008-11-13 |work=[[Anti-Spam Research Group|ASRG]] mailing list |publisher=[[Internet Research Task Force|IRTF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The feedback loops fail to meet the generic anti-spam criterion of not generating more email messages. Even if the amount of feedback is just a fraction of the number of messages that an ESP sends out, most ESPs are not yet organized for handling it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irtf.org/pipermail/asrg/2008-November/003625.html |title=FeedBack loops |accessdate=18 November 2008 |author=Chris Lewis |date=2008-11-12 |work=[[Anti-Spam Research Group|ASRG]] mailing list |publisher=[[Internet Research Task Force|IRTF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Using the same button for both abuse reports and list unsubscribe implies guesswork by the (automated) help desk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irtf.org/pipermail/asrg/2008-November/003677.html |title=FeedBack loops |accessdate=18 November 2008 |author=Barry Shein |date=2008-11-13 |work=[[Anti-Spam Research Group|ASRG]] mailing list |publisher=[[Internet Research Task Force|IRTF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it does not ease reporting to a list owner that a specific post in the (non moderated) list is actually spam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irtf.org/pipermail/asrg/2008-November/003683.html |title=FeedBack loops |accessdate=18 November 2008 |author=Barry Shein |date=2008-11-13 |work=[[Anti-Spam Research Group|ASRG]] mailing list |publisher=[[Internet Research Task Force|IRTF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some FBLs provide no option for communicating feedback automatically to multiple parties: the sender, the ESP (if one is involved), or the upstream datacenter/network address provider—as currently construed by the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) "Follow the Money" strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ftc.gov/reports/rewardsys/040916rewardsysrpt.pdf |title=A CAN-SPAM Informant Reward System|accessdate=8 November 2011|author=Deborah Platt Majoras |date=September 2004|publisher=[[US Federal Trade Commission]]|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The majority of ESP offering Feedback Loop do not include in the report the email address of the recipient, who marked the message.  This makes it impossible to remove the recipient from the mailing list, where it has subscribed.  Such ESPs' practice encourages mailing-lists providers to send individualized message to each recipient (contrary to sending everybody literally the same message), so that mailing list providers can extract from the individualized message coming over the feedback loop the original recipient.

'''Feminism in Ireland''' has played a major role in shaping the legal and social position of women in present-day [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. The role of women has been influenced by numerous legal changes in the second part of the 20th century, especially in the 1970s.

==Before second wave feminism==
[[File:Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington in 1916.png|thumb|[[Hanna Sheehy Skeffington]] in 1916]]
From 1918, with the rest of the [[United Kingdom]], women in Ireland could vote at age 30 with property qualifications or in university constituencies, while men could vote at age 21 with no qualification. From separation in 1922, the [[Irish Free State]] gave equal voting rights to men and women. Promises of equal rights from the Proclamation were embraced in the Constitution in 1922, the year Irish women achieved full voting rights. However over the next ten years laws were introduced that eliminated women's rights from serving on juries, working after marriage, and working in industry. The 1937 Constitution and Taoiseach [[Éamon de Valera]]’s conservative leadership further stripped women of their previously granted rights.&lt;ref name="The Sisterhood of the Easter Rising"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/17/opinion/the-sisterhood-of-the-easter-rising.html The Sisterhood of the Easter Rising] March 16, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; As well, though the 1937 Constitution guarantees women the right to vote and to nationality and citizenship on an equal basis with men, it also contains a provision, Article 41.2, which states:

{{quotation|1° [...] the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.

2° The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.}}

Women participated actively in the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916. Approximately 300 women&lt;ref name="IrishTimes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCoole|first1=Sinead|title=Women of 1916|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/heritage/women-of-1916-1.2535291|website=Irish Times|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; took part in the insurrection, many of whom were members of the Irish republican paramilitary group [[Cumann na mBan]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.collinspress.ie/images/Cumann%20na%20mBan%20RP%20PR.pdf Cumann na mBan and the Irish Revolution"] Press release, Collins Press&lt;/ref&gt; In advance of the 2016 commemoration of the Rising, several historians have researched and worked to correct the omissions. A government-funded project allowed Mary McAuliffe and Liz Gillis to document the stories of 77 women who were jailed for participating in the uprising. They were typically activists who had fought for social justice and equality in a variety of ways: land reform, labor organizing and women’s suffrage.  [[Hanna Sheehy Skeffington]], a voting rights activist, told audiences during a speaking tour in 1917 that "it is the only instance I know of in history when men fighting for freedom voluntarily included women.&lt;ref name="The Sisterhood of the Easter Rising"/&gt;

A major shift after the execution of rebel leaders in 1916 was that the [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|Roman Catholic church]] finally backed the cause for independence. The church was the most powerful institution in the country and exercised its power to shape the constitution. The first Free State government supported a pluralist state, but Éamon de Valera, who was not a supporter of women's emancipation, together with the church, enshrined Catholic and socially conservative teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/25/100-years-after-easter-rising-irish-women-still-fighting-gender-equality Why, 100 years after the Easter Rising, are Irish women still fighting?] The Guardian, March 25, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, the [[marriage bar]] was introduced in Ireland; it prevented any married woman from working in the public sector (but see further events below in "Second wave feminism" section).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galligan|title="Women and National Identity in the Republic of Ireland".|date=1997|pages=45–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contraception in Ireland was made illegal in 1935 under the 1935 Criminal Law (Amendment) Act (but see further events below in "Reproductive rights" section.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.wsm.ie/story/3390|title = The Train That Crashed Through the Anti-Condom Law|last = |first = |date = January 2008|journal = Worker's Solidarity|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 21 August 2015|issue = 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second wave feminism==
[[File:Nell_McCafferty.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nell McCafferty]]]]
[[Second-wave feminism|Second-wave]] feminism in Ireland began in the 1970s, fronted by women such as [[Nell McCafferty]], [[Mary Kenny]], [[June Levine]] and [[Nuala O'Faolain]]. At the time, the majority of women in Ireland were housewives.

The [[Irish Women's Liberation Movement]] was an alliance of a group of Irish women who were concerned about the sexism within Ireland  both socially and legally. They first began after a meeting in [[Dublin|Dublin's]] Bewley's Cafe on [[Grafton Street]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tcd.ie/history/contesting/Undergrad/Module15/document6.pdf|title = Irish Women's Liberation Movement|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Trinity College, Dublin|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They later had their meetings in [[Margaret Gaj]]'s restaurant on [[Baggot Street]] every Monday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.independent.ie/world-news/the-matriarch-who-served-up-stew-and-social-progress-26747770.html|title = The Matriarch Who Served up Stew and Social Progress|last = Sweetman|first = Rosita|date = 7 February 2011|work = Independent|access-date = 21 August 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Liffey Press Mondays at Gaj's: The Story of the Irish Women's Liberation Movement|url = http://www.theliffeypress.com/mondays-at-gaj-s-the-story-of-the-irish-women-s-liberation-movement.html|website = The Liffey Press|accessdate = 2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was short-lived, but influential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nfh&amp;AN=9FY2673767236&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Celebrating Sisterhood|last = |first = |date = 26 May 2010|work = Irish Times|access-date = 21 August 2015|via = Newspaper Source - EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was initially started with twelve women, most of whom were journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 1968: Memories and Legacies of a Global Revolt|last = McCafferty|first = Nell|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 216–218|url = http://www.ghi-dc.org/files/publications/bu_supp/supp006/bus6_213.pdf|chapter = Ireland: Breaking the Shackles|access-date = 21 August 2015|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924022050/http://www.ghi-dc.org/files/publications/bu_supp/supp006/bus6_213.pdf|archivedate = 24 September 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the co-founders was [[June Levine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-187100131.html|title=Farewell to a maverick in stilettos and lipstick; In memoriam: Late feminist campaigner June Levine with her husband, psychiatrist Ivor Browne|last=Kubiak|first=Klara|date=17 October 2008|work=Daily Mail|access-date=27 May 2018|subscription=yes|via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, a group of Irish feminists (including [[June Levine]], [[Mary Kenny]], [[Nell McCafferty]] and other members of the [[Irish Women's Liberation Movement]]) travelled to [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], on the so-called "[[Contraceptive Train]]" and returned with condoms, which were then illegal in Ireland.

In 1973, a group of feminists, chaired by [[Hilda Tweedy]] of the [[Irish Housewives Association]], set up the Council for the Status of Women, with the goal of gaining equality for women. It was an umbrella body for women's groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwci.ie/about/history.html NWCI History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617212729/http://www.nwci.ie/about/history.html |date=June 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s the council's activities included supporting projects funded by the [[European Social Fund]], and running Women and Leadership Programmes and forums. In 1995, following a strategic review, it changed its name to the [[National Women's Council of Ireland]].

Also in 1973, the [[marriage bar]] was removed in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://martindale.cc.lehigh.edu/sites/martindale.cc.lehigh.edu/files/Patterson.pdf |title=Women of Ireland: Change Toward Social and Political Equality in the 21st Century Irish Republic |first=Rachel A. |last=Patterson |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008154655/https://martindale.cc.lehigh.edu/sites/martindale.cc.lehigh.edu/files/Patterson.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been introduced in 1932, and had prevented any married woman from working in the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galligan|title="Women and National Identity in the Republic of Ireland".|date=1997|pages=45–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[McGee v. The Attorney General]]'' [1974] IR 284 was a case in the [[Irish Supreme Court]] in 1974 that referenced [[Constitution of Ireland|Article 41 of the Irish Constitution]].&lt;ref name="taoiseach1"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/attached_files/Pdf%20files/Constitution%20of%20IrelandNov2004.pdf|title = Constitution of Ireland in the departement of the taoiseach|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justcite.com.elib.tcd.ie/Document/d7jsrUrxA0LxsKjIoXCJn0GZn1WIikvNCPnhzPngDP9MBjrMi6atF/mcgee-v-the-attorney-general |title=The Library of Trinity College Dublin - Off Campus Access to e-Resources |publisher=Justcite.com.elib.tcd.ie |date= |accessdate=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concerned Mary McGee, whose condition was such that she was advised by her physician that if she would become pregnant again her life would be endangered. She was then instructed to use a diaphragm and spermicidal jelly that was prescribed to her.&lt;ref name="blogspot1"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sibealnetwork.blogspot.com/2014/02/reproductive-rights-in-ireland.html|title = SIBÉAL|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Section 17 of the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935]] prohibited her from acquiring the prescription. The Supreme Court ruled by a 4 to 1 majority in favor of her, after determining that married couples have the constitutional right to make private decisions on family planning.&lt;ref name="blogspot1"/&gt;

Prior to the [[Family Home Protection Act, 1976]], a husband could sell or mortgage the family home,  without the consent or even knowledge of his wife.

The Employment Equality Act of 1977&lt;ref name="irishstatutebook1977"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1977/act/16/enacted/en/html |title=Employment Equality Act, 1977 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=1977-06-01 |accessdate=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibited most gender discrimination in employment.

In 1979, the [[An Irish solution to an Irish problem|Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979]] allowed the sale of contraceptives in Ireland, upon presentation of a prescription.

A setback for second-wave feminism in Ireland occurred in 1983, when the [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]] was passed, which recognized "the unborn" as having a right to life equal to that of "the mother".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;de Londras &amp; Enright, Repealing the 8th: Reforming Abortion Law in Ireland (2018)&lt;/ref&gt; As such, abortions could only be legally conducted in Ireland if they occurred as the result of a medical intervention performed to save the life of the pregnant woman, and later due to legislation, this risk to the woman's life also included risk from suicide.&lt;ref name="belfasttelegraph1"&gt;{{cite web|author=30 July 2013 |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/republic-of-ireland/irish-president-passes-abortion-law-29459951.html |title=Irish president passes abortion law |publisher=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk |date=2013-07-30 |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2018 the Eighth Amendment was repealed by referendum.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44256152 |title=Irish abortion referendum: Ireland overturns abortion ban - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date=2018 |accessdate=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ireland acceded to the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title=UNTC |publisher=Treaties.un.org |date= |accessdate=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1985, the [[An Irish solution to an Irish problem|Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act, 1985]] allowed the sale of condoms and spermicides to people over 18 in Ireland without having to present a prescription.

The [[Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986]],&lt;ref name="irishstatutebook1986"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1986/act/24/enacted/en/html |title=Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=1986-07-02 |accessdate=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; abolished the dependent domicile of the wife.

The [[Family Law Act 1988]] abolished the legal action for [[restitution of conjugal rights]].&lt;ref name="irishstatutebook1988"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1988/act/31/enacted/en/html |title=Family Law Act, 1988 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=1988-11-23 |accessdate=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second-wave feminism in Ireland ended at the end of the 1980s.

==Employment==
The [[marriage bar]] was introduced in Ireland in 1932, and prevented any married woman from working in the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galligan|title="Women and National Identity in the Republic of Ireland".|date=1997|pages=45–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was abolished in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://martindale.cc.lehigh.edu/sites/martindale.cc.lehigh.edu/files/Patterson.pdf |title=Martindale Center &amp;#124; Lehigh Business |publisher=Martindale.cc.lehigh.edu |date= |accessdate=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Employment Equality Act, 1977&lt;ref name="irishstatutebook1977"/&gt; prohibited most gender discrimination in employment. 

The Employment Equality Act, 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1998/act/21/enacted/en/html |title=Employment Equality Act, 1998 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=1998-06-18 |accessdate=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; upholds gender equality in employment. 

In Ireland, the female employment rate stretched to 60.6% in 2007 before decreasing to 57.6% in 2009 and it continued to reduce over the next three years to rest at 55.2% by 2012. However, there was a small growth within the female employment rate to 55.9% in 2014, but men worked an average of 39.2 hours a week in paid employment in 2013 in contrast to women with 31.2 hours per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Irish women are more highly qualified and work fewer hours|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/csolatestnews/pressreleases/2014pressreleases/pressreleasewomenandmeninireland2013/|website=Central Statistics Office|accessdate=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and divorce==
Prior to the [[Family Home Protection Act, 1976]], a husband could sell or mortgage the family home,  without the consent or even knowledge of his wife. Other important legal changes made to the [[family law]] include the [[Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986]],&lt;ref name="irishstatutebook1986"/&gt; which abolished the dependent domicile of the wife; and the [[Family Law Act 1988]], which abolished the legal action for [[restitution of conjugal rights]].&lt;ref name="irishstatutebook1988"/&gt; [[Marital rape]] was outlawed in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1990/act/32/section/5/enacted/en/html#sec5 |title=Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, Section 5 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date= |accessdate=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Ireland repealed its constitutional prohibition of [[divorce]]; this was effected by the [[Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Act]], 1995, which was approved by referendum on 24 November 1995 and signed into law on 17 June 1996.

==Politics==
In 1990, [[Mary Robinson]] was elected as the first female [[President of Ireland]]. The second female president, [[Mary McAleese]], was president between 1997 and 2011. 

In December 2008, Senator [[Ivana Bacik]] organised an event in [[Leinster House]] in which all the women elected to the [[Oireachtas]] over the years were honoured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/indepth/oireachtas/putting-women-in-the-frame.htm Dáil Éireann - 90 Years of Parliamentary democracy]. ''The Irish Times''. Retrieved on 2010-09-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Ninety-two [[List of women in Dáil Éireann|women have been elected]] to [[Dáil Éireann]], the first being [[Constance Markievicz]] in 1919. Directly prior to this, in 1918, she became the first woman elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], although in line with Sinn Féin [[abstentionism|abstentionist]] policy she did not take her seat. 

Following the [[Irish general election, 2011]] and a re-shuffle in 2014, four women were appointed cabinet ministers (the highest number of women in senior ministerial positions ever in Ireland): [[Joan Burton]], [[Frances Fitzgerald (politician)|Frances Fitzgerald]], Jan O'Sullivan and Heather Humphries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Taoiseach_and_Government/List_of_Ministers_Ministers_of_State/ | title=List of Ministers and Ministers of State | publisher=Department of the Taoiseach | accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproductive rights==
{{Further|Abortion in the Republic of Ireland}}

Contraception in the Republic of Ireland was made illegal in 1935 under the 1935 Criminal Law (Amendment) Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.wsm.ie/story/3390|title = The Train That Crashed Through the Anti-Condom Law|last = |first = |date = January 2008|journal = Worker's Solidarity|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 21 August 2015|issue = 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]] was passed, which recognized "the unborn" as having a right to life equal to that of "the mother".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; As such, abortions could only be legally conducted in Ireland if they occurred as the result of a medical intervention performed to save the life of the pregnant woman, and later due to legislation, this risk to the woman's life also included risk from suicide.&lt;ref name="belfasttelegraph1"/&gt; (See below events in 2012/2013). However, in 2018 the Eighth Amendment was repealed by referendum.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; (See below events in 2018.)

In 1985, the [[An Irish solution to an Irish problem|Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act, 1985]] allowed the sale of condoms and spermicides to people over 18 in Ireland without having to present a prescription.

In 1992, the [[Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]] was passed, specifying that the protection of the right to life of the unborn does not limit freedom of travel in and out of the state. 

Also in 1992, the [[Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]] was passed, specifying that the protection of the right to life of the unborn does not limit the right to distribute information about services in foreign countries. 

Also in 1992, ''[[Attorney General v. X]]'' (the "X case"), [1992] IESC 1; [1992] 1 IR 1, was a landmark Irish Supreme Court case which established the right of Irish women to an abortion if a pregnant woman's life was at risk because of pregnancy, including the risk of suicide. However, Supreme Court Justice Hugh O'Flaherty, now retired, said in an interview with the ''Irish Times'' that the X Case was "peculiar to its own particular facts", since X miscarried and did not have an abortion, and this renders the case moot in Irish law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=X Case judge says ruling is 'moot' in current abortion debate|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/x-case-judge-says-ruling-is-moot-in-current-abortion-debate-1.1454699|publisher=Irish Times|date=6 July 2013|author=Ruadhan Mac Cormaic}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See below events in 2012/2013).

In 1993, the [[An Irish solution to an Irish problem|Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act, 1992]] allowed the sale of contraceptives in Ireland without prescription.

In 2012 the [[death of Savita Halappanavar]], four days after a complete [[miscarriage]], on 28 October at University Hospital Galway in Ireland, led to nationwide protests—which spilled over into India, Britain and many other countries—calling for a review of the abortion laws in Ireland.

The Act gave effect in statutory law to the terms of the Constitution of Ireland as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the 1992 judgment ''[[Attorney General v. X]]'' (the "X case"). That judgment (see above events in 1992) allowed for abortion where pregnancy endangers a woman's life, including through a risk of suicide. The provisions relating to suicide were the most contentious part of the bill. In 2013 Ireland's first legal abortion was carried out on a woman who had an unviable 18-week pregnancy and whose life was at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/ireland-performs-first-legal-abortion-after-savita-case/article5052707.ece|title=Ireland performs first legal abortion|date=23 August 2013|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=30 April 2015|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=August 2015}} However many medical terminations had previously been performed in Ireland, including those at the University Hospital when complications had arisen in pregnancy, as it was and remains Irish law to save the life of the mother, if physiological threats to that life arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2234271/Savita-Halappanavar-A-pregnant-wifes-death-global-outcry--Was-killed-draconian-abortion-laws.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490|title=A pregnant wife's tragic death, a global outcry and the question: Was she really killed by draconian abortion laws?|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|date=17 November 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gbaya''', also '''Gbeya''' or '''Baya''', are a people of western region of [[Central African Republic]], east-central [[Cameroon]], the north of the [[Republic of Congo]], and the northwest of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Burnham | first=Philip | last2=Christensen | first2=Thomas | title=Karnu's Message and the ‘War of the Hoe Handle’: Interpreting a Central African resistance movement | journal=Africa: Journal of the International African Institute | publisher=Cambridge University Press  | volume=53 | issue=4 | year=1983 | pages=3–22 | doi=10.2307/1159708 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numbering about 970,000 by the late 1800s, they originated in northern Nigeria. The Gbaya were known for their strong resistance to the French and slavery, and revolted against them for three years starting in 1928 when they were conscripted to work on the  [[Congo-Ocean railway]].

In rural areas, the Gbaya cultivate mainly [[maize]], [[cassava]], [[yam (vegetable)|yam]]s, [[peanut]]s, [[tobacco]], [[coffee]] and [[rice]], the latter two of which were introduced by the French. Today, many of the Gbaya people are Christians, though witchcraft is practiced, known as ''dua''.

==History==
The Gbaya numbered about 970,000 by the late 1800s, after fleeing the holy war of [[Usman dan Fodio]] in the Hausa area of northern Nigeria early in the century. In what is now northern Cameroon they experienced conflict with the [[Fulani]] ethnic group. The Gbaya were resistant to the French colonialists in the early 20th century. In the early 1920s there was a strong backlash after many of them were enslaved as porters and labourers, and developed into a revolt in 1928-1931 when conscription was introduced in the building of the [[Congo-Ocean railway]].&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Gbaya|title=Gbaya|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gbaya people felt discriminated against in the political sphere, even after independence from the French. It was only in the 1990s that a notable number of Gbaya leaders began to be admitted into higher administrative positions in government.&lt;ref name="Burnham1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burnham|first=P.

==Sub groups and languages==
[[File:Gbaya Throwing Knife 2.jpg|thumb|120px|Gbaya throwing knife.]]
Subgroups of the Gbaya include the [[Bokoto]], [[Kara people|Kara]], [[Kaka, Central African Republic|Kaka]], [[Buli, Central African Republic|Buli]], and [[Bwaka]]. The Gbaya speak a language of the Adamawa-Ubangi subgroup of the [[Niger-Congo language]] family.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt;

==Economic and cultural practices==
In rural areas, the Gbaya cultivate mainly [[maize]], [[cassava]] (staple food),&lt;ref name=asante116/&gt; [[yam (vegetable)|yam]]s, [[peanut]]s, [[tobacco]], [[coffee]] and [[rice]], the latter two of which were introduced by the French. The diamond industry took off in the late 1930s and still remains important.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; The agriculture method of Gbaya is called "swidden", a type of "slash and burn" farming where the forest is cleared, vegetation burnt on top of the cleared land, the farm used for a few years, then abandoned and the families move to a new area.&lt;ref name=asante116&gt;{{cite book|author1=Molefi Kete Asante|author2=Ama Mazama|title=Encyclopedia of African Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B667ATiedQkC |year=2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-3636-1|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gbaya make an alcoholic beverage prepared with honey which is known as ''kuri''. ''Kam'', is a Gbaya porridge made from cassava.&lt;ref name="Burnham1997"/&gt; Today, most of the Gbaya people are Christians (50% Protestant, 33% Catholic), about 12% follows original indigenous beliefs, with only a minority of Muslims (3%).&lt;ref name=asante116/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosander1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosander|first=Eva Evers|title=Transformation Des Identités Féminines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D0B29mV5UA8C&amp;pg=PA206|year=1997|publisher=Nordic Africa Institute|isbn=978-91-7106-403-5|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witchcraft is known to be practiced, and is known to the people as ''dua''.&lt;ref name="Währisch-OblauWrogemann2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Währisch-Oblau|first1=Claudia|last2=Wrogemann|first2=Henning|title=Witchcraft, Demons and Deliverance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tBO5CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA144|date=9 January 2015|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-643-90657-1|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''German-Jamaican''' is a [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] of German ancestry. The population was established in the 1830s when the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]] resulted in a [[labour shortage]] on the [[Jamaica|Caribbean island]]. [[Charles Ellis, 1st Baron Seaford|Lord Seaford]], who owned the Montpelier Estate and Shettlewood Pen in [[Saint James Parish, Jamaica|St. James]] established a European settlement in [[Westmoreland Parish, Jamaica|Westmoreland]] in order to combat the shortage, and over one thousand [[Germans]] [[Human migration|migrated]] to Jamaica.&lt;ref name="JNHT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jnht.com/heritage_site.php?id=273 |title=Seaford Town: Westmoreland |year=2005 |publisher=Jamaica National Heritage Trust |accessdate=2009-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629114314/http://www.jnht.com/heritage_site.php?id=273 |archivedate=June 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[German language]] is no longer used on the island, but some German words have entered the Jamaican vernacular.&lt;ref name="JNHT"/&gt; Many Jamaicans in [[Seaford, Jamaica|Seaford]] and German Town in [[Westmoreland Parish|Westmoreland]] carry heavy European features such as blue eyes, blond hair, freckles, and white skin, as a result of the German genetic influences.&lt;ref name="JNHT"/&gt;

'''Gregory K. Dreicer''' is a curatorial strategist, [[history of technology|historian of technology]],{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} experience and exhibition developer, [[curator]], and museum manager. Dreicer's multidisciplinary projects, which engage audiences in discovering and exploring everyday environments, have led public discussion on issues including infrastructure, city planning, community identity, preservation, livability, design, and sustainability. Dreicer's work is known for innovative strategies in project conception and design that create memorable experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = For example, ''Me, Myself and Infrastructure'' was included in the 2002 ''Washington Post'' top ten exhibition list; it was the only non-art exhibition on the list. | publisher = ''Washington Post'', Dec. 27, 2002 | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/271409101.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Dec+27%2C+2002&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=T.32&amp;desc=Michael+O%27Sullivan%27s+Top+10 | accessdate = November 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public History and Museums==
Dreicer’s exhibition projects, through their multidisciplinary focus on stories about infrastructure, architecture, art, landscape, cities, water, and land, emphasize the indivisible nature of natural, built, and social environments. He has developed projects for organizations including the National Building Museum, Museum of the City of New York, and the Smithsonian Institution Museum on Main Street program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Museum on Main Street  | publisher = Smithsonian Institution | url = http://www.museumonmainstreet.org | accessdate = November 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Museum of Vancouver, Dreicer developed a new institutional vision based on social connection. At the Chicago Architecture Foundation, Dreicer developed the institutional thematic framework, was responsible for the creation of the master plan for a new facility, and developed a large-scale model of Chicago that made the CAF facility a destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Alphine W. Jefferson, "Chicago Model City: A Permanent Exhibition," ''Public Historian'' 33 (May 2011): 167-71.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His projects have focused on issues including fences and land use; water supply systems; lighting and city life; preservation; livable communities; energy efficiency; and skyscraper engineering and architecture.

==Scholarship==
Dreicer’s scholarly research and publications investigate building as a process, rather than buildings as objects. His work, focused on the early development in the United States and Europe of building processes and long-span and high-rise design, demonstrates the crucial role of construction in the history of industrialization. This transnational investigation of design in action demonstrates how the fundamental ideas that shape understandings of technology—nationalism, evolutionism, and progress—are entwined in the process of invention itself. In articles such as "Nouvelles inventions: l’interchangeabilité et le génie national" in ''Culture Technique''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = Gregory K. Dreicer | title = Nouvelles inventions: l’interchangeabilité et le génie national | publisher = ''Culture Technique'', 1992 | url = http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=21531078 | accessdate = November 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Influence and Intercultural Exchange: the Case of Engineering Schools and Civil Engineering Works in the Nineteenth Century" in ''History and Technology'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = Gregory K. Dreicer | title = Influence and Intercultural Exchange: the Case of Engineering Schools and Civil Engineering Works in the Nineteenth Century | publisher = ''History and Technology'',  1995 | url = http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/07341512.html | accessdate = November 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreicer explores invention as a process of exchange between cultures while emphasizing the thinking behind the history of architecture and building. In articles such as "Building Myths: The ‘Evolution’ from Wood to Iron in the Construction of Bridges and Nations" in ''Perspecta'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author = Gregory K. Dreicer | title = Building Myths: The ‘Evolution’ from Wood to Iron in the Construction of Bridges and Nations | publisher = ''Perspecta'', 2000 | url = http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?tid=8461&amp;ttype=2 | accessdate = November 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreicer explores the impact of evolutionary metaphors and nationalism on understandings of technology. In "Building Bridges and Boundaries: The Lattice and the Tube, 1820-1860" in ''Technology and Culture''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = Gregory K. Dreicer | title = Building Bridges and Boundaries: The Lattice and the Tube, 1820-1860  | publisher = ''Technology and Culture'', January, 2010 | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/tech/summary/v051/51.1.dreicer.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; he analyzes the relationship between the construction of engineering infrastructure and national identity.

==Education and Academic Career==

==Background==
The temporary staffing industry in Japan is regulated by the 1985 Worker Dispatch Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Act for Securing the Proper Operation of Worker Dispatching Undertakings and Improved Working Conditions for Dispatched Workers
|url=http://www.cas.go.jp/jp/seisaku/hourei/data/aspo.pdf

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original aim of this law was to regulate the extra-legal system of subcontractor personnel dispatching that had become commonplace in the automobile and electronics industries.&lt;ref name=ProtectedP8&gt;Protected Employment Economies, pp. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; Designed to allow project-based work and temporary staffing in sectors plagued by shortages of highly skilled workers (e.g., software specialists), the 1985 law limited temporary staffing to a "white list" of 13 occupations. But subsequent revisions steadily expanded its range of application. Notably, the 1999 revision replaced the "white list" with a short "black list" of occupations where temporary staffing remained restricted. This had the effect of opening most of the labor market to the temporary staffing industry.&lt;ref name=ProtectedP15&gt;Protected Employment Economies, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the 2004 revision removed most of the remaining restrictions on temporary staffing in the manufacturing sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|language=Japanese
|year=2004
|accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was an enormous expansion of temporary labor in the Japanese labor market. Between 2000 and 2007, the number of regular employees in Japan declined by about 1.9 million, while the number of nonregular workers increased by about 4.5 million. By 2008, short-term contract and temporary staffing workers had increased from a small percentage to more than 30% of the Japanese labor force.&lt;ref name=JapanEcho&gt;{{cite journal

==Types of haken==
There are two types of haken:

(1) "Specified worker dispatching undertakings" whereby a temp agency hires temporary workers on a regular basis and sends them on assignment to work at its client companies.

(2) "General worker dispatching undertakings" whereby a temp agency registers temporary workers and sends them to its client companies on a contingent basis by signing a per-job contract each time the agency receives an assignment from its client companies.&lt;ref&gt;Osaka Information Service For Foreign Residents website [http://www.ofix.or.jp/life/eng/labor/03.html Labor Contract] Retrieved on June 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layoffs==
{{nihongo|'''''Haken-giri'''''|派遣切り}} is the Japanese term for layoffs of temporary employees (haken) dispatched to companies by [[Temporary work|staffing agencies]]. In particular, it refers to the wave of layoffs that followed the financial crisis of 2008, which highlighted recent structural changes in the Japanese labor market and prompted calls for reform of the labor laws. Estimates of the number of layoffs between October 2008 and March 2009 range from 131,000, according to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare,&lt;ref name=NYTJobless&gt;{{cite web

to 400,000, according to staffing industry associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2009-04-03}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The problem was especially acute because temporary workers enjoy few of the rights and benefits that protect full-time regular employees. For example, at least half of Japan's non-regular workers are ineligible for unemployment benefits because they have not held their jobs a year or longer.&lt;ref name=NYTJobless/&gt; In many cases, both ''haken'' and short-term contract workers were laid off before the terms of their contracts, but the lack of penalties in the labor laws meant that no redress was available except through civil lawsuits.

Public interest in the plight of the laid-off workers peaked around the end of 2008, when 500 unemployed and homeless temporary workers converged on a "New Year's ''Haken'' Tent Village" in [[Hibiya Park]] in central Tokyo. Well-known lawyer and consumer advocate [[Kenji Utsunomiya]] was declared the "honorary mayor" of the village. According to the organizing committee, many of the workers were in poor physical condition, and eight were hospitalized with pneumonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In response, some companies rescinded their early layoffs, or at least agreed to allow temporary workers to continue living in company dormitories until the period of their contracts. But the widespread public perception that large corporations had failed to live up to their social responsibilities led to calls for reform of the labor laws. In February, the Tokyo Bar Association issued a 10-point statement calling for reforms such as restoration of the "white list" of skilled occupations, an upper limit on margins levied by staffing agencies, prohibition of dispatching within corporate groups, and stricter penalties for early layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revisions of Worker Dispatch Law==
In 2010 the Japanese government has indicated that it intended to revise the Worker Dispatch Law in regard to temporary employees.  The main points of the revision centered on:

(1) problematic registration-type dispatches will be prohibited in principle, except for highly specialized jobs, such as language interpretation;

(2) dispatches to manufacturing industries will be banned in principle, except for regular-type long-term employment;

(3) day labor dispatches and dispatches shorter than two months will be banned in principle; and

(4) in the case of illegal dispatch, the user company or other user organization will be obliged to offer an employment contract to the dispatched worker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jilaf.or.jp/English-jilaf/mbn/2010/019.html  "Cabinet Approves Bill for Partially Revising Worker Dispatch Law," March 30, 2010, Japanese International Labour Federation website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 further revisions came into effect, which were seen as a mixed blessing for temporary workers and were expected to increase industry's use of such labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Okunuki|first1=Hifumi|title=Legal change will make temp purgatory permanent for many Japanese workers|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2015/09/27/issues/legal-change-will-make-temp-purgatory-permanent-many-japanese-workers/#.V19lFI7biEF|accessdate=14 June 2016|work=The Japan Times|agency=The Japan Times|date=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hauländer''' is a [[German-language]] term for [[Germans|German]] [[settler]]s in [[Prussia]] and in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].  Their settlement contracts with owners of the land where they founded villages followed practices introduced into [[Poland]] by [[Mennonites|Mennonite]] immigrants from the [[Netherlands]] and [[Friesland]] in the 16th and 17th centuries.  These contracts specified certain freedoms not enjoyed by [[serf]]s.  Villages settled under this law were called ''Holęndry'' or ''Olędry'', and the inhabitants of such villages were called [[Olędrzy]] (singular: Olęder &lt;-- Hauländer), regardless of their ethnicity (i.e., even if they were ethnically Polish or German).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10294">'''Human trafficking in Israel''' includes the [[human trafficking|trafficking]] of men and women into the country for [[forced labor]] and [[sex slavery]]. Low-skilled workers from [[China]], [[Romania]], [[Africa]], [[Turkey]], [[Thailand]], the [[Philippines]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[India]] migrate voluntarily for contract labor in the construction, agriculture, and health care industries. Some, however, subsequently face conditions of forced labor, such as unlawful holding of passports, restrictions on movement, non-payment of wages, threats, and physical intimidation. Many labor recruitment agencies in source countries and in [[Israel]] require workers to pay recruitment fees ranging from $1,000 to $10,000—a practice that makes workers highly vulnerable to trafficking once in Israel, and in some cases, situations of [[debt bondage]]. Israel was also a destination country for women trafficked from [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Moldova]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Belarus]], China, [[South Korea]] and possibly the Philippines for the purpose of sexual exploitation. In 2008, [[NGO]] had noted an increase in the internal trafficking of Israeli women for commercial sexual exploitation, and reported new instances of trafficking of Israeli women abroad to [[Canada]], [[Ireland]], and [[England]]. African [[asylum seekers]] entering Israel illegally are also vulnerable to trafficking for forced labor or prostitution.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Israel".

In 2007, the government increased the number of convictions for sex trafficking offenses, and conducted a campaign to prevent forced labor.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt; Israel also continues to provide victims of sex trafficking with shelter, legal aid and protection assistance. NGOs claim that "the shelters are insufficient to treat the scale of trafficking victims who were not officially identified in Israel, particularly among migrants and asylum seekers arriving from the Sinai".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/192595.pdf "Trafficking in Persons Report 2012.'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 2012) p.195.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it was reported that "the number of women affected continues to decline since the passage and implementation of Israel’s 2006 anti-trafficking law."&lt;ref name="state194"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/192595.pdf "Trafficking in Persons Report 2012.]. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 2012) p.194.&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the 245 mile [[Israel–Egypt barrier]] in 2013, is credited with further reducing human trafficking into Israel, by preventing irregular migration along the Sinai-[[Negev]] trafficking route.&lt;ref name="refworld.org"&gt;United States Department of State, 2013 Trafficking in Persons Report - Israel, 19 June 2013, available at: http://www.refworld.org/docid/51c2f3b424.html [accessed 21 June 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 1"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A Tier 1 ranking is the highest rating given to a government that "has acknowledged the existence of human trafficking, has made efforts to address the problem." The State Department reports: "The Government of Israel continued to improve its strong 
protection of trafficking victims over the reporting period."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/192595.pdf "Trafficking in Persons Report 2012.'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 2012) p.38.&lt;/ref&gt;) The State of Israel ratified the [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]] on 23 Jul 2008 .&lt;ref&gt;[http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XVIII-12-a&amp;chapter=18&amp;lang=en] United Nations Treaty Collection. "Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children... Status of ratification of the SEM and SSA countries"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The Government of Israel has made uneven progress in prosecuting and punishing trafficking offenses. Israel prohibits all forms of trafficking in persons through its Anti-Trafficking Law that came into force on October 29, 2006, which prescribes penalties of up to 16 years' imprisonment for sex trafficking of an adult, up to 20 years' imprisonment for sex trafficking of a minor, up to 16 years' imprisonment for [[slavery]], and up to 7 years' imprisonment for forced labor. These penalties are commensurate with those for other grave crimes, such as rape. In 2007, the government convicted 38 individuals for sex trafficking—four more than in 2006—with sentences ranging from six months to 15 years' imprisonment and fines.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

In addition, 16 prosecutions for sex trafficking were in process as of 2008, and another 15 cases were pending appeal. Israel made some efforts to investigate and punish acts of involuntary servitude; in 2007, the government prepared three indictments for forced labor and one indictment for slavery. In addition, three criminal cases of fraud/deceit of foreign workers involving five defendants were pending prosecution or appeal as of 2008. Israel reported no prosecutions, convictions, or punishments of government officials complicit in trafficking in 2007.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

In Feb 2013 the newspaper Haaretz successfully sued the Tel Aviv District Court to reveal the name of a major sex trafficker who became a police informer, David Digmi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kubovich |first=Yaniv |url=http://haaretz.com/news/national/biggest-trafficker-of-women-in-israeli-history-finally-exposed.premium-1.501461 |title=Biggest trafficker of women in Israeli history finally exposed - National Israel News |publisher=Haaretz |date=2013-02-05 |accessdate=2014-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protection==
The Government of Israel has improved its protection of trafficking victims, but the protection of victims of forced labor remained relatively weak. The government operates a shelter largely for victims of sex trafficking with the support of a local NGO. Notably, though Israel lacks a specific shelter for victims of labor trafficking, government authorities sometimes refer victims of forced labor to the shelter for sex trafficking. Victims in this shelter receive medical treatment, psychiatric and social services, stipends, and [[temporary residency]] and work permits.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The government mandates legal aid to all trafficking victims and employs formal procedures to identify victims of sex trafficking and refer them to a shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.il/MOJEng/SiuaMishpati/NosiimBetipulenu/HumanTrafficking.htm |title=Responsibility Areas - Human Trafficking |publisher=Justice.gov.il |date= |accessdate=2014-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Foreign workers who file complaints regarding criminal offenses are not arrested, are generally placed in alternative employment, and are granted immigration relief. Victims of trafficking receive legal alternatives to their removal to countries in which they may face hardship or retribution, including the issuance of temporary visa extensions.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The government encourages victims of sex trafficking to assist in investigations against their traffickers, but it does not actively encourage victims of forced labor to do the same. Victims not housed in the government shelter, including victims of internal trafficking, do not receive the same level of protection services from the government as victims located in shelters.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
[[File:ISR-EGY border 6521a.jpg|thumb|The 245 mile long [[Israel–Egypt barrier]], completed in 2013, obstructs a overland trafficking route into Israel]]
Israel has made efforts to prevent trafficking in persons. The Immigration Police has run a radio campaign warning employers not to exploit migrant workers. The Ministry of Education and the Authority for the Advancement of the Status of Women has also conducted awareness campaigns in the school system that included seminars for administrators and teachers on sex trafficking. This program focused on the role of the school system in reducing demand for commercial sexual services.

The 2011 documentary film "[[The Price of Sex]]" ( priceofsex.org) was screened at the Jerusalem Cinematheque on 8 Mar 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jer-cin.org.il/website/modules/films/film.aspx?showid=11384 |title=Cinematheque :: Shows :: The Price of Sex |publisher=Jer-cin.org.il |date= |accessdate=2014-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414125304/http://www.jer-cin.org.il/website/modules/films/film.aspx?showid=11384 |archivedate=2014-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Held in [[Cape Town]], South Africa '''Infecting the City''' is a [[public art]]s festival that is committed to making art freely available to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infectingthecity.com/2011/the-art/ |title=The Art « Infecting the City 2011 |publisher=Infectingthecity.com |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival hosts a range of different types of [[site-specific art]], [[art intervention]] and [[performance art]] in the central part of the City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mahala.co.za/art/death-by-art/ |title=Infecting the City &amp;#124; Death by Art |publisher=Mahala |date=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year the festival takes on a social issue or theme which the participating artists respond to. In 2011, the Festival worked with Cape Town's artistic and cultural community to present public art under the theme of Treasure. This theme was intended to celebrate the artistic traditions and contemporary practices of the diverse communities within South Africa and to explore Cape Town's "Afropolitan" reality.

Infecting the city is presented by the [[Africa Centre]], a [[Non-for-profit corporation|non-for-profit]] organisation that creates a platform for exploring contemporary [[Pan-African]] artistic practice as a tool for social change. Infecting the City is an integral part of the city, challenging audiences to notice hidden spaces and perspectives of Cape Town and providing an arts and cultural voice in Africa, for Africans.

==History==
The festival started as Infecting The City Performing Arts Festival in 2008 with a "singular aggressive aim – to infect the city with performance that captures the complexities of our daily lives".&lt;ref&gt;Jay Pather and [[Brett Bailey]], Curator's note&lt;/ref&gt; The Festival was born to migrate some of the experiences of the now-disbanded Spier Summer Season on the [[Spier Wine Farm]] to the central part of Cape Town. The annual Spier Summer Season first started in 1996 and included diverse performances such as opera, comedy, poetry and music over a three-month period each year. In 2007, the Spier Arts Trust, the organisation which produced the Summer Season, discontinued the project. The Africa Centre, with funding from Spier, decided to continue the spirit of the Summer Season by creating a week-long performance art festival in the centre of Cape Town. [[Brett Bailey]] has curated the 2009, 2010 and 2011 iterations of the Infecting The City Festival.[[Jay Pather]] curated the festival in 2012

In 2010 the festival changed its name to Infecting the City Public Arts festival to incorporate visual art, public interventions and to better reflect what the Festival represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativecapetown.net/infecting-the-city-festival |title=Creative Cape Town |publisher=Creative Cape Town |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public art has traditionally functioned to popularise art – to challenge the elitist art culture of the galleries and bring art into the streets. Today, public art attempts to respond to the flexibility and cross-disciplinary nature of contemporary art practice combining artistic vision and community values. Public art offers the opportunity to challenge its audiences, breach boundaries, and shift the perspectives of public space. It is this vision of public art that the Festival aspires to.

Over the years the number of artists participating and audience attending has steadily grown with the 2011 Festival including 314 artists whose artworks were seen by over 25,000 people.

==Past festivals==
Each festival is based around a theme. Each year, the theme refers to a social issue that is applicable to all and makes both the artists and the audience look at these social issues in new and transformative ways.

===Festival 2011===
[[File:ITC 2011 Poster.jpg|thumb|right|The poster for Infecting the City 2011 supporting its theme of Treasure]]
ITC 2011 was curated with the theme of '''TREASURE'''. The theme allowed artists to make art that highlighted the treasures from the city that the audience did not know of or had forgotten about. These treasures were then presented in four categories – cultural jewels, music gems, [[environmental waste]] and historic treasures. The categories were named: The Jewels, City Treasurers, Slices of Life and Music Gems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infectingthecity.com/2011/the-festival/ |title=The Festival « Infecting the City 2011 |publisher=Infectingthecity.com |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Brett and aidan capetalk interview.ogg|thumb|300px|Brett Bailey interviewed on [[Cape Talk|567 CapeTalk]] by presenter [[Cape Talk|Aden Thomas]]]]

The festival opened on Monday, 21 February 2011 and lasted until Saturday, 26 February. The Festival Hub was at the [[Cape Town Station]] forecourt, but public arts events occurred every day at different public spaces around the city. ''The Jewels'' consisted of 15 local community groups that displayed a ritual, rite or cultural practice. The Jewels ranged from [http://www.mediaupdate.co.za/default.aspx?IDStory=29092 Rieldans] to Drum Majorettes, from Xhosa Stick-fighting to [http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/saho%20stuff/saho%20books/ledochowski/5-gallery-CER-NEW-02.htm Ratiep], and from opera and ballet to the Ethiopian Coffee Ceremony. Each of the 15 cultural gems was choreographed, by five theatre makers: Peter Hayes, Natalie Fisher, Fiona du Plooy, Celeste Botha and Sensei Ndlovu. The Jewels were performed on locally crafted Jewel Boxes (stages) twice a day. The Jewel Route led the audience from Jewel Box to Jewel Box through the city centre. There were 3 different Jewel Routes during the festival week.

The ''City Treasurers'' section was made up of well known visual and performance artists who used artistic interventions, performance pieces or public art to draw attention to historic or contemporary treasures in the city. ''Strand'' was a series of performance pieces that wove together the stories of Cape Town as a port. It took place twice daily on the Cape Town Station. ''Invisible Gold'', ''Urban Diamonds'' and the ''Number 1 Unexpected Undercover Agency'' were artworks who differently looked at the people who make the city work. ''Relics of Place'' and ''Watermarks'' highlighted the waste of spring water flowing off the mountain and into the sea. The Treasurers included Peter Aerschmann, Doung Dala, Catherine Henegan, Nadine Hutton, Jethro Louw, Mafuta Ink, Owen Manamela, Anthea Moys, Myer Taub, Athina Vahla and Caron von Zeil. 

''Slices of Life'' was the title for the Festival's focus on eco waste. Eight environmental artists from Cape Town and Johannesburg (Igshaan Adams, Simon Max Banister, James Clayton, Hannelie Coetzee, Brendhan Dickerson, Heath Nash, Usha Seejarim, Nomthunzi Mashalaba) transformed recyclable garbage into artwork, with the purpose of drawing attention to valuable materials that most of us{{Who|date=May 2011}} consider to be 'rubbish' and subsequently dispose of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supernews.co.za/green-2/infecting-the-city-artists-turn-rubbish-into-art/ |title=Infecting the City Artists turn Rubbish into Art |publisher=Supernews |date=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Music Gems featured nine musical groups on a stage on the forecourt of Cape Town Station. Each group came from a different community and represented a different culture that lives in Cape Town: Delta Soetstemme, Loit Sols, Congolese Car Guard Quartet, Mac MacKenzie's Goema Symphony, Spaza Hip-Hop, Teiko Drumming, Zimbabwe's Madzishe, and the Zamanani Brothers. The programme was curated by Iain Harris.

===Festival 2010===
ITC 2010 was held from 13 to 20 February. The theme for 2010 was '''HUMAN RITE''', which investigates the role of rites and rituals as tools for transformation and healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infectingthecity.com/2010/ |title=The Spier Public Arts Festival, Cape Town |publisher=Infecting the City |date=26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 Festival was oriented around the theme Human Rite and asked artists to take a deep look at the dynamics of Cape Town society and to "creatively envision the kind of society that we want to live in".&lt;ref&gt;Brett Bailey, Curator's Note&lt;/ref&gt; The artists were invited "to ask: What cries out for transformation or healing? Who needs to be included in the social fabric of the City?; and how do we amplify and liberate the energy of the CBD? The artists confronted Cape Town's collective demons and to put them to rest, to seek out silent memories and invisible stories, and to validate them, to look for what needs to be righted, and 'rited'. To broaden and deepen the way we experience the world we live in and to celebrate our fundamental human right to express who we are".&lt;ref&gt;Infecting the City programme&lt;/ref&gt;
The programme included installations that engage with Capetonians and visitors to Cape Town, choreographic works (Windows into a World, Dancing Jesus), large-scale collaborative performance art pieces (Imperfections, Meet Market, Quiet Emergency) and low key interventions (Grey Matter, Information People, Jump, Mandala for Healing, the Wishing Wall), as well as discussion forums (The Right to Respond. Participating artists came from Cape Town, Johannesburg, Grahamstown, Zimbabwe, China, UK, Greece, Germany, USA, Australia and the Netherlands.

===Festival 2009===
[[File:ITC 09 Poster.jpg|thumb|right|Infecting The City 2009 poster depicting the theme Home Affairs]]
ITC 2009 was held on Saturday, 21 February until Friday, 27 February. The theme for 2009 was: '''HOME AFFAIRS'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infectingthecity.com/2009/ |title=The Spier Performing Arts Festival, Cape Town |publisher=Infecting the City |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009, Infecting the City asked artists to grapple with the national tensions revealed in the 2008 xenophobic violence. The artists were asked to look at human displacement, migration, immigration, refugees and identity. Named after the government department that processes immigrants to South Africa, "Home Affairs" had works on the programme that deepened audience understanding of these complex and often disturbing issues. For a week, Infecting the City transformed Cape Town into a cutting edge theatre featuring works from local and international artists.

The programme included three artworks that were the result of the six-week Collaborative Course where twelve artists from South Africa, SADC countries and beyond SADC borders shared diverse skills and created artworks relating to the festival theme. Amakwerekwere, Exile and Limbo were the artworks that resulted from this process. Commissioned works included An Histrionic, Call Cutta in a Box, Eyton Road, Incwaba Lendoda Lise Cankwe Ndelela (The Grave of the Man is Next to the Road) and Tuning into the Void.

===Festival 2008===
[[File:ITC2008 poster.jpg|thumb|right|Poster for Infecting the City 2008]]
ITC 2009 was held from 26 February until 2 March 2008. The theme for 2008: '''TIME'''

The Spier Performing Arts Festival – Infecting the City – launched in Cape Town in February 2008 with the intention to "infect the city with performance that captures the complexities of our daily lives... The underlying intention is to feature works that bravely take on new ways of expression, of collaboration disciplines, and of integrating the classical and the contemporary".&lt;ref&gt;Brett Bailey and Jay Pather, Curators&lt;/ref&gt; 

The programme included commissioned new works (''Dreamtime, I am Cinnamon''), existing works relocated and restaged (''Not with My Gun, Isivuno sama Phupha'' (Harvest of Dreams), Transport Exceptionnels, Misterios Da Actualidade) collaborative projects (''An Order of Passage, 22 mins 37 sec, Waking Time''), Talking Heads, and a workshop series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5860">The '''Jats''' or sometimes pronounced '''Jots''' are members of an ethnic group found in [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;Rao, Aparna (1986). "Peripatetic Minorities in Afghanistan—Image and Identity pages 254 to 283." In Die ethnischen Gruppen Afghanistan, edited by E. Orywal. Wiesbaden: L. Reichert. {{ISBN|3-88226-360-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
In Afghanistan, the term Jat does not refer to a single ethnic community, but rather to a number of disparate groups who practice a peripatetic lifestyle. Groups who are generally referred to as Jat have their own self-designation, and often resent being called Jat, and being called a Jat is an insult in Afghanistan. In [[Dari (Persian dialect)|Dari]] dialect of [[Kabul]], shrewish women were often admonished not to be quarrelsome like a Jat. A comparison would the use of the word Gypsy to refer to the [[Romani language|Romany]] and the word Zott to refer to similar groups in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;Rao, Aparna (1986). "Peripatetic Minorities in Afghanistan—Image and Identity pages 254 to 283." In Die ethnischen Gruppen Afghanistan, edited by E. Orywal. Wiesbaden: L. Reichert. {{ISBN|3-88226-360-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is unclear is how these distinct groups acquired the name Jat. In neighbouring [[South Asia]], the term [[Jat]] refers to a large cluster of agriculture castes, some especially in the [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] are connected with camel breeding and herding, and it is possible that the Afghan Jat are descended from peripatetic communities that entered Afghanistan in the company of these nomadic Jats, and acquired the name by association.&lt;ref&gt;Persian Jats by Percy Sykes in the [[Journal of the Gypsy Lore Society]] 1910 3(4):320&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social characteristics ==

Generally, what defines groups that are generally known as Jat is a nomadic lifestyle, with their main occupation being the provision of services such as the manufacture and sale of agricultural implements, bangles, drums and winnowing trays as well as providing entertainment such as performing bears and monkeys, fortune-telling, singing and occasionally [[prostitution]]. Most Jats have a network of clients and customers scattered over a broad region, and they migrate between these known clients clusters, occasionally adding new ones. Secondly, each Jat group specializes in a particular activity, for example the Ghorbat of western Afghanistan are sieve makers, shoe repairers and animal traders, while the Shadibaz peddle cloth, bangles and haberdashery.&lt;ref&gt;Rao, Aparna (1986). "Peripatetic Minorities in Afghanistan—Image and Identity pages 254 to 283." In Die ethnischen Gruppen Afghanistan, edited by E. Orywal. Wiesbaden: L. Reichert. {{ISBN|3-88226-360-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Jat characteristics include speaking their dialect or language, and practising strict [[endogamy]]. Most Jat are however multilingual, speaking both [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and [[Dari (Persian dialect)|Dari]], and often a Turkic dialect as well.

== Ethnic groups ==

Below is a brief description of the main groups which fall within the Jat category:&lt;ref&gt;Olesen, A. (1987).

'''Judith Auer''' (née '''Vallentin''') (19 September 1905 – 27 October 1944) was a [[Widerstand|resistance]] fighter against the [[Nazism|Nazi]] régime in [[Germany]].

==Early life==
Auer was born in [[Zürich]]. Her father was the communist writer, Erich Vallentin.&lt;ref name="gdw"&gt;[http://www.gdw-berlin.de/bio/ausgabe_mit-e.php?id=400 Short biography of Judith Auer] German Resistance Memorial Center, Berlin. Retrieved May 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; After her parents' untimely death in 1917,&lt;ref name="bda-koep"&gt;[http://www.bda-koepenick.de/verfolgte/Judith%20Auer Judith Auer] Vereinigung der Verfolgten des Naziregimes - Bund der Antifaschisten [[Köpenick]], Germany. Retrieved July 29, 2010 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judith was brought up by a well-to-do [[Jew]]ish family.&lt;ref name="bda-koep" /&gt; She completed her ''[[Abitur]]'' and began studies in [[music]] in the hopes of becoming a [[pianist]].&lt;ref name="bda-koep" /&gt;

In 1924, as a student, she joined the [[Young Communist League of Germany]],&lt;ref name="gdw" /&gt; and the next year, moved to Berlin. There, she met and married [[Erich Auer]], a functionary in the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD), in 1926.&lt;ref name="bda-koep" /&gt; In 1927, she joined the KPD. In 1928, Auer went to [[Moscow]] with her husband and worked at the [[Comintern]]'s offices.

In 1929, her daughter Ruth was born.&lt;ref name="bda-koep" /&gt; To earn money, Auer learned [[typing]] and [[shorthand]] and took a job at a KPD establishment.

==Resistance activities==
After [[Hitler]] [[Machtergreifung|seized power]] in Germany in 1933 and the KPD was banned by the new régime, Auer eventually found herself working for [[AEG]] at the Kabelwerk [[Oberspree]] ("cable works"),&lt;ref name="gdw" /&gt; first as a shorthand typist, and later as a buying agent.&lt;ref name="bda-koep" /&gt; It was here that Auer first came into contact with the resistance group around [[Fritz Plön]],&lt;ref name="bda-koep" /&gt; a [[welding|welder]], who himself had contacts with the resistance group around [[Anton Saefkow]], [[Franz Jacob (Resistance fighter)|Franz Jacob]], [[Bernhard Bästlein]] and [[Karl Klodt]], the [[Saefkow-Jacob-Bästlein Organization]].&lt;ref name="gdw" /&gt; Auer had also had a long friendship with Änne Weiß, who became Saefkow's wife.&lt;ref name="bda-koep" /&gt; Auer managed her resistance group's finances and used business trips to do courier work, especially with a view to establishing links with resistance fighters in [[Thuringia]], such as [[Theodor Neubauer]].&lt;ref name="bda-koep" /&gt; She also hid Franz Jacob in her flat for several months after he fled from [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref name="gdw" /&gt;

==Arrest and Execution==
Auer was arrested at her workplace on 7 July 1944 and was later tortured.&lt;ref name="bda-koep" /&gt; Along with [[Bruno Hämmerling]] and Franz Schmidt, she was sentenced to death at the [[Volksgerichtshof]]. Auer was hanged at [[Plötzensee Prison]] in Berlin on 27 October 1944.&lt;ref name="gdw" /&gt;

The origins of the Kedayans are uncertain. Some of them believe their people were originally from [[Java]],&lt;ref name="IbrahimSiddique1985"/&gt; which they left during the reign of Sultan [[Bolkiah]]. Because of his fame as a [[sea captain]] and voyager, the Sultan was well-known to the people of Java, [[Sumatra]] and the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="IbrahimSiddique1985"/&gt; It is believed that when the Sultan arrived to the island of Java, he became interested in the local agricultural techniques.&lt;ref name="IbrahimSiddique1985"/&gt; He brought some of the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] farmers back to his country to spread their techniques. The farmers [[interracial marriage|inter-married]] with the local [[Bruneian Malay people|Bruneian Malay]] people, giving birth to the ''Kedayan'' ethnicity.&lt;ref name="IbrahimSiddique1985"/&gt; Most Kedayans have adopted [[Islam]] since the Islamic era of the Sultanate of Brunei. They have also adopted [[Malay people|Malay]] culture.&lt;ref name="Canagarajah2005"/&gt; The Kedayans are recognized as one of the [[Indigenous peoples of Oceania|indigenous]] people of [[Borneo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Skutsch|title=Encyclopedia of the World's Minorities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yXYKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA781|date=7 November 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-19388-1|pages=781–}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are experts in making [[traditional medicines]]. The Kedayans are well known for their cultivation of [[medicinal plants]], which they grow to treat a wide range of ailments and to make tonics.&lt;ref name="Choudhary2009"/&gt;

The language of one of the indigenous tribes, the [[Banjar people]] in [[Kutai Kartanegara Regency|Kutai]], [[East Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]], is said to share more than 90% of the vocabulary with the Kedayan language, despite the fact that the Banjarese do not refer to themselves as Kedayans.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} Both the Kedayans and the Banjarese are related, to a certain extent, because of the similarities in their languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shiv Shanker Tiwary &amp; Rajeev Kumar|title=Encyclopaedia of Southeast Asia and Its Tribes, Volume 1|year=2009|publisher=Anmol Publications|isbn=81-261-3837-8|pages=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barack and Michelle Obama kissing at a basketball game.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|US President [[Barack Obama]] and his wife [[Michelle Obama]] kissing for the kiss cam while Malia Obama and [[Joe Biden]] watch on the jumbotron during a basketball game in Washington, DC]]
The '''kiss cam''' is a social game that takes place during arena, stadium and court sporting events in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. It is intended as a light-hearted diversion to the main event during a [[Time-out (sport)|timeout]], [[television timeout]], or similar downtime. A 'kiss cam' camera scans the crowd, and selects a couple, their images being shown on the [[jumbotron]] screens in the arena.  A kiss is traditionally rewarded by applause, clapping, cheers and whistles, whereas a refusal to kiss is [[booing|booed]].

When the kiss cam is in action, the audience may be alerted by a known 'kiss-related' song being played, and/or an announcer warning the crowd. The crowd attending then pay attention to the marked 'kiss cam' video screen. Normally several consecutive couples are selected, and appear on the screen. As each pair appear onscreen, they are then expected to kiss. Additionally, sporting event staff may appear as couples who reject kisses or proposals in order to entertain or surprise the attending audience.

==Origins==
The kiss cam tradition originated in [[California]] in the early 1980s, as a way to fill in the gaps in play in professional [[baseball]] games, taking advantage of the possibilities of the then-new giant video screens.&lt;ref name=kiss&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deadspin.com/the-kiss-cam-and-american-sports-fans-a-slightly-awkwa-1523113498|title=The Kiss Cam And American Sports Fans: The History Of A Romance|first=Alan|last=Siegel|date=14 February 2014|accessdate=5 May 2015|work=[[Deadspin]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hazards==
{{Original research|section|date=May 2018}}
The couple focused on by the camera may not be in a romantic relationship. They may in fact be brother and sister, friends, or not know each other at all. A platonic, perhaps awkward kiss often then results. Sometimes a refusal can generate a humorous twist for those watching.

The kiss cam screen often appears on television if the event is televised. The couple focused on may not wish their attendance together at the event to be widely publicized.

Some couples, although not wishing to kiss, feel intimidated by the crowd reaction, and feel forced to do so. Other instances may find the couple not noticing themselves on the screen, and the resulting inaction can be humorous or embarrassing.

Gay or lesbian couples may feel excluded from the Kiss Cam routine, or if included, may feel subject to [[Homophobia|homophobic]] expressions of disapproval from members of the watching crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=04/20/2012 2:53 pm |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/20/brandon-mccarthy-oakland-as-kiss-cam-gay_n_1441336.html |title=Brandon McCarthy, Oakland A's Pitcher, Condemns 'Kiss Cam' Gay Humor On Twitter |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2012-04-20 |accessdate=2013-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kissing under such public scrutiny can be severely embarrassing for either or both members of a couple, who may not be comfortable with [[public displays of affection]] to that level.

The first positive reaction by a gay couple caught on camera happened at [[AT&amp;T Park]] in San Francisco in August 2011. The men embraced on the kiss cam without embarrassment.&lt;ref name="kiss"/&gt; On May 2, 2015, a gay couple was applauded after they kissed on the kiss cam at [[Dodger Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deadspin.com/two-dudes-smooch-on-dodgers-kiss-cam-to-hearty-applaus-1702072244|title=Two Dudes Smooch On Dodgers' Kiss Cam, To Hearty Applause|first=Samer|last=Kalaf|date=4 May 2015|accessdate=5 May 2015|work=Deadspin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
On ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]'', [[Conan O'Brien|O'Brien]] parodied the Kiss Cam in comedy sketches, focusing on unlikely couples, such as a hunter and a bear.

The Canadian group, the [[Arkells]] released a song titled "Kiss Cam" in July 2011.

[[The Great Khali]] once hosted a weekly segment in his wrestling appearances called 'Khali Kiss Cam', in which he would kiss a female supposed audience member. He was preceded in this by the late wrestler [[Rick Rude]], who would kiss a woman selected from the crowd after his victories.

In ''[[Family Portrait (Modern Family)|Family Portrait]]'', the finale of the first season of the US television comedy ''[[Modern Family]]'', [[Phil Dunphy|Phil]] is caught on a kiss cam, and feigning reluctance kisses [[Gloria Pritchett|Gloria]], his step-[[mother-in-law]].

'''Laotian Canadians''' are [[Canadians|Canadian]] citizens of [[Laos|Laotian]] origin or descent. In the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Census]], 24,580 people indicated Laotian ancestry.&lt;ref name="Census2016"/&gt; Most Lao people are Billingual because they were once under the protectorat of [[France]] (See [[French protectorate of Laos]].)

==Migration history==
Mass migration from Laos to Cambodia peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s, consisting of both government-sponsored and privately sponsored refugees from camps in Thailand, where they had fled due to the [[Laotian Civil War]] and the final victory of the [[Pathet Lao]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van Esterik|1999|pp=902–903}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the 1990s, most refugees in the camps were instead being repatriated to Laos. In total, Canada took in 12,793 Laotian refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van Esterik|1999|p=903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demography==
Most migrants consisted of young families; there were very few elderly among them. A significant proportion were drawn from among the [[Laotian Chinese|community of ethnic Chinese in Laos]].&lt;ref name="Richardson16"/&gt;

There is a community of Laotian people in [[Kitchener, Ontario]], where 995 Laotian Canadians live (0.004% of its population).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=CSD&amp;Code1=3530013&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=35&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Kitchener&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;B1=All&amp;GeoLevel=PR&amp;GeoCode=3530013&amp;TABID=1 Kitchener, City [Census subdivision], Ontario and Ontario [Province]], [[Statistics Canada]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
Winterkorn embarked on his career in 1977, as a specialist assistant in the research division "Process Engineering" at [[Robert Bosch GmbH]].&lt;ref name=BW&gt;{{cite web|title=EXECUTIVE PROFILE - Martin Winterkorn|publisher=''[[Business Week]]''|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=1541008&amp;symbol=VOWG.DE|accessdate=2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1978 to 1981, he headed the refrigerant compressor development group "Substances and Processes" at Robert Bosch and Bosch-Siemens-Hausgeräte GmbH.

In 1993 Winterkorn became head of Group Quality Assurance at Volkswagen AG, and was appointed General Manager of Volkswagen AG with power of attorney in March 1994. He was additionally responsible for the VW Group Product Management from June 1995. In January 1996, Winterkorn took over from Herbert Schuster as Member of the Brand Board of Management for "Technical Development" for the Volkswagen brand.&lt;ref name=AutoMotorundSport199606&gt;{{cite journal| authorlink = Bernd Ostmann &amp; Thomas Fischer| title = Ein Schwabe in Wolfsburg:  Martin Winterkorn, 48...| series = Heft| journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport]]| volume = 6 1996| pages = Pages 206–208 |date = 8 March 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; From July 2000, he was Member of the VW Group Board of Management for Technical Development. Winterkorn was instrumental in getting Volkswagen CEO [[Ferdinand Piëch]] to approve the production of the [[Volkswagen New Beetle|New Beetle]].

Winterkorn had been chairman of the board of management of Audi AG since 1 March 2002. He headed the [[Audi]] brand group, including the brands [[SEAT]] and [[Lamborghini]], which was formed on 1 January 2002. Winterkorn also assumed responsibility for Technical Development at Audi AG with effect from 1 January 2003. In his capacity as CEO of the Board of Management of Audi AG, Winterkorn was also Member of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Supervisory Board|url = http://www.audi.com/corporate/en/company/corporate-management/supervisory-board.html|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He succeeded [[Bernd Pischetsrieder]] as CEO of Volkswagen AG on 1 January 2007, and by 2014 he was the highest paid CEO of all companies listed on Germany's blue-chip DAX stock market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/automobiles/08vw.html? |title=After Power Struggle, Volkswagen Ousts Its Chief |date=Nov 8, 2006 |author=Mark Landler }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Germany investigates VW's ex-boss over fraud allegations|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/28/us-volkswagen-emissions-idUSKCN0RP14U20150928|newspaper = Reuters|date = 2015-09-28|access-date = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since June 2003, Winterkorn has served as an honorary professor of the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]], in recognition of his service to the promotion of research at the establishment.&lt;ref name=BW/&gt;  He was featured both in the 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2007 Power List|publisher=''[[Motor Trend]]''|url=http://www.motortrend.com/features/consumer/112_0702_2007_power_list/8__martin_winterkorn.html|year=2007|accessdate=2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2008 Power List of American automotive magazine ''[[Motor Trend]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2008 Power List|publisher=''[[Motor Trend]]''|url=http://www.motortrend.com/features/consumer/112_0802_2008_power_list/page_2.html|year=2008|accessdate=2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After he succeeded Pischetsrieder in 2007, Winterkorn embarked on the "Strategie 2018" with the goal to bypass [[General Motors]] and [[Toyota]] by the year 2018, to become the world's largest automaker, "not just in units, but in profitability, innovation, customer satisfaction, everything."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title =Winterkorns XXL-Plan|url = http://www.manager-magazin.de/unternehmen/artikel/a-516650.html|newspaper = Manager-Magazin|date = 2007-11-10|access-date = 2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title =Volkswagen’s Strategy 2018.

Among Winterkorn's initiatives are the [[Automobile platform|platforms]] [[Volkswagen Group MQB platform|MQB]] and [[Volkswagen Group MLB platform|MLB]] which standardize the area between gas pedal and front wheels (including engines) where 60% of the development costs occur, to reduce cost while increasing design flexibility for the rest of the car.&lt;ref name=forb2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=truth&gt;{{cite web

In the VW Group, he was viewed&lt;!--2013--&gt; as having attention to detail,&lt;ref&gt;Muller 2013. Quote: "earning a reputation as a boss who obsesses about the tiniest product details"&lt;/ref&gt; being "product-focused" and "methodical and precise", but also demanding.&lt;ref&gt;Muller 2013. Quote: "He doesn’t like bad news. Before anyone reports to him, they make sure they have good news."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diesel emissions scandal===
{{main | Volkswagen emissions scandal}}
{{wikinews|Volkswagen CEO resigns after emissions scandal}}
In September 2015, Winterkorn apologized for Volkswagen AG having installed software in its diesel cars to allow the vehicles to pass emissions tests by decreasing emissions when the vehicle detected it was undergoing testing but otherwise pollute at amounts well beyond legally allowed limits. Winterkorn confirmed that Volkswagen AG could face fines of up to $18bn, but had not issued a recall at the time of Winterkorn's departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/your-guide-to-dieselgate-volkswagens-diesel-cheating-c-1731857018|title=Your Guide To Dieselgate: Volkswagen's Diesel Cheating Catastrophe&amp;nbsp;|author=Patrick George|work=Jalopnik}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winterkorn blamed "the terrible mistakes of a few people," whom he did not name, for the international scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-vw-diesel-20150923-story.html||title=Volkswagen diesel scandal threatens to ruin its credibility and value|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=September 22, 2015|accessdate=September 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/11884260/European-stock-markets-set-to-open-lower-as-VW-emissions-fallout-deepens-LIVE.html|title=Volkswagen scandal: CEO Martin Winterkorn resigns over emissions deception - as it happened on Wednesday|date=23 September 2015|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winterkorn resigned as CEO on 23 September 2015, as he accepted responsibility for the scandal while asserting that he was "not aware of any wrongdoing on my part." &lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bomey|first1=Nathan|title=Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn resigns amid scandal|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2015/09/23/volkswagen-emissions-scandal-martin-winterkorn/72673028/|accessdate=23 September 2015|work=[[USA Today]]|date=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = VW scandal: German prosecutors probe Winterkorn as Volkswagen emissions-rigging crisis spreads to 2.1 million Audi cars and Skoda models|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/11895848/BREAKING-2.1-million-Audi-cars-fitted-with-VW-emissions-cheat-devices.html|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winterkorn additionally resigned as [[Audi]] chairman on November 11, 2015. The resignation came a week after additional revelations were made public regarding further vehicle emission test rigging, this time in gasoline-powered vehicles, in amounts approaching one million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/12/us-volkswagen-emissions-audi-idUSKCN0T10MR20151112#uO2kaAmSzGO27E4g.97|title=Former VW CEO quits as Audi chair as emission-scandal probes continue|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Winterkorn indictment====

Winterkorn was charged in a United States indictment with fraud and conspiracy in the case on May 3, 2018. U.S. Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]] stated Winterkorn would be prosecuted vigorously, and added “If you try to deceive the United States, then you will pay a heavy price.”&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

The criminal charges increased the likelihood that Winterkorn would face similar actions in his native Germany, and impact an existing shareholders lawsuit against Volkswagen. &lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Additionally, the indictment raised questions regarding Volkswagen’s internal review of the incident, which at the time of the Winterkorn indictment had not been made public. Winterkorn had repeatedly denied knowledge of the widespread Volkswagen emissions test cheating up to the indictment, including his statements before the German parliament, the [[Bundestag]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; The chairman of the committee looking into the scandal, [[Herbert Behrens]], was reported to be incredulous at Winterkorn’s statement that he had not heard the term [[Defeat device|defeat device]] (the technology at the heart of the scandal) prior to the first news reports about the emissions lawbreaking in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/business/germany-investigation-volkswagen-winterkorn-diesel-emissions.html|title=Ex-Chief of VW Holds Firm During Grilling on Emissions Deception|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The indictment specifically references a 2015 business conference in [[Wolfsburg]], Germany where Winterkorn is alleged to have been briefed on, and approved the “continued concealment” of, the defeat device software from U.S. regulators, and notes emails from that year from VW’s then-compliance liaison [[Oliver Schmidt (engineer)|Oliver Schmidt]], who pled guilty in the case in 2017, receiving a seven year jail term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-volkswagen-winterkorn-20180503-story.html|title=U.S. charges Volkswagen ex-CEO in diesel-cheating case - LA Times|first=|last=Bloomberg|website=latimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medical sociology''' is the [[sociological]] analysis of [[medical]] [[organizations]] and [[institutions]]; the production of knowledge and selection of methods, the [[social actions|actions]] and interactions of healthcare professionals, and the social or cultural (rather than clinical or bodily) effects of medical practice. The field commonly interacts with the [[sociology of knowledge]], [[science and technology studies]], and [[social epistemology]]. Medical sociologists are also interested in the qualitative experiences of patients, often working at the boundaries of [[public health]], [[social work]], [[demography]] and [[gerontology]] to explore phenomena at the intersection of the social and clinical sciences. [[Health disparities]] commonly relate to typical categories such as [[Social class|class]] and [[race (classification of human beings)|race]]. Objective sociological research findings quickly become a [[normative]] and [[political]] issue.

Early work in medical sociology was conducted by [[Lawrence Joseph Henderson|Lawrence J Henderson]] whose theoretical interests in the work of [[Vilfredo Pareto]] inspired [[Talcott Parsons]] interests in [[Systems theory#Sociology and Sociocybernetics|sociological systems theory]]. Parsons is one of the founding fathers of medical sociology, and applied [[social role]] theory to interactional relations between sick people and others. Key contributors to medical sociology since the 1950s include [[Howard S. Becker]], Mike Bury, [[Peter Conrad (sociologist)|Peter Conrad]], Jack Douglas, David Silverman, Phil Strong, [[Bernice A. Pescosolido|Bernice Pescosolido]], [[Carl May]], Anne Rogers, [[Anselm Strauss]], [[Renee Fox]], and Joseph W. Schneider.

The field of medical sociology is usually taught as part of a wider [[sociology]], [[clinical psychology]] or [[Health sciences|health studies]] degree course, or on dedicated Master's degree courses where it is sometimes combined with the study of [[medical ethics]] and [[bioethics]]. In Britain, sociology was introduced into the medical curriculum following the Goodenough report in 1944: "In medicine, 'social explanations' of the aetiology of disease meant for some doctors a redirection of medical thought from the purely clinical and psychological criteria of illness. The introduction of 'social' factors into medical explanation was most strongly evidenced in branches of medicine closely related to the community — Social Medicine and, later, General Practice" {{Harv|Reid|1976}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="885">'''Metropolitan Belt''' ({{lang-pt|Colar Metropolitano}}) is an official designation by the [[Brazil]]ian government for municipalities that are adjacent to a [[Metropolitan area#Brazil|metropolitan area]], but are not part of it. However,  since metropolitan areas can only contain adjacent municipalities, they are natural candidates to be merged to the area in future redefinitions. Sometimes, when by the negotiation of merging of new municipalities, the term metropolitan belt refers only to the candidate municipalities.

Typically the number of participants of a metropolitan belt is proportional to the number of the constituting municipalities of the metropolitan regions. The [[Greater Belo Horizonte|Belo Horizonte]] metropolitan belt is composed of 14 municipalities, having the metropolitan area 34 municipalities.

The '''National Institute of Information Development''' of [[Nicaragua]]; ([[Spanish language|Spanish:]] '''Instituto Nacional de Información de Desarollo de Nicaragua''' ('''INIDE''')), is responsible for completing [[census]]es and [[statistical survey|surveys]]. The [[Nicaragua 2005 Census|8th population and the 4th dwellings census]] was carried out in 2005.

== History ==

INEC was established as ''Dirección General de Estadística'' in 1905. The organization faced financial troubles in the beginning and closed several times through 1939. When the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinistas]] won the Revolution, the statistical office was renamed to INIDE. INIDE conducted its first census in 2005, and is expected to continue every ten years.

'''''Nothing to Hide: The False Tradeoff Between Privacy and Security''''' is a book written by [[Daniel J. Solove]] regarding the [[nothing to hide argument]] regarding [[privacy]]. It was published by [[Yale University Press]] in 2011.

==Summary==
The book, written for a general audience, includes some material that had been adapted by law review articles written by Solove. Raymond G. Kessler wrote in the ''[[Law and Politics Book Review]]'' that "the average reader may find some discussions of the law difficult to follow."&lt;ref name=Kessler&gt;Kessler, Raymond G. "[http://www.lpbr.net/2011/09/nothing-to-hide-false-tradeoff-between.html Nothing to Hide: The False Tradeoff Between Privacy and Security]" (book review) ([https://www.webcitation.org/6HdSAyXhk Archive]). ''[[Law and Politics Book Review]]''. Volume 21, Issue 9. p. 514-517. Retrieved on June 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The book has twenty one chapters in four parts.&lt;ref name=Kessler/&gt; The parts are "How We Should Assess and Balance the Values of Privacy and Security", "How the Law Should Address Matters of National Security", "How the Constitution Should Protect Privacy" and "How the Law Should Cope With Changing Technology".&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
Tony Doyle wrote in a book review published in the ''[[Journal of Value Inquiry]]'' that "Overwhelmingly ''Nothing to Hide'' is a carefully argued, hysteria-free book" and that the author "makes a strong case for the profound social value of privacy, the siege it is currently under, and how to preserve it."&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Woodrow Hartzog wrote in the ''[[Michigan Law Review]]'' that the thesis of his book review is "[[Daniel J. Solove|Solove]]'s polemic is a strong and desperately needed collection of frames that counterbalances the "nothing to hide" argument and other refrains so often used in privacy disputes."&lt;ref&gt;Hartzog, p. 1022.&lt;/ref&gt; J.M. Keller wrote in ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]]'' that the book is "Interesting for those with a passing interest in privacy, security, or legal rhetoric, yet well researched enough to recommend to privacy and security scholars."&lt;ref&gt;Keller, J.M. "Solove, Daniel J.: Nothing to hide: the false tradeoff between privacy and security." ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]]''. 49.5 (Jan. 2012): p. 980. Available at Academic ASAP Infotrac, Expanded Academic ASAP Infotrac, General OneFile, Literature Resource Center, and Popular Magazines, all by [[Gale Cengage Learning]] (document number: GALE|A276134746).&lt;/ref&gt;

Delmus E. Williams of the ''[[Journal of Academic Librarianship]]'' argues that while Solove "writes well" and "offers solid support for those who would argue that we need more protection for personal privacy" he argues that the book "does not claim to a balanced, and thoughtful readers will want to find other sources if they hope to understand counter arguments."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Delmus E. "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0099133311002357 Nothing to Hide: the Tradeoff between Privacy and Security, Daniel J. Solove (Ed.). Yale University Press, New Haven, CT (2011), 245 pp. $25.00] {{ISBN|978-0-300-17231-7}}" (book review). ''[[The Journal of Academic Librarianship]]''. Volume 38, Issue 1, January 2012, Pages 72. Available at [[SciVerse]], [[ScienceDirect]].&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond G. Kessler wrote in the ''[[Law and Politics Book Review]]'' that "Being so short, some readers might find it wanting in details, examples and explanations. However, this work is one very, very, good place to start."&lt;ref name=Kessler/&gt;

Prison loaf is usually bland, perhaps even unpleasant, but [[prison warden]]s argue that nutraloaf provides enough [[nutrition]] to keep prisoners healthy without requiring utensils to be issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcax.com/Global/story.asp?S=8061875&amp;nav=menu183_2|title=Food for Thought: Is Nutraloaf Punishment?|publisher=WCAX-TV News|accessdate=2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
There are many recipes which include a range of food, from vegetables, fruit, meat, and bread or other grains. The ingredients are blended and [[baked]] into a solid [[loaf]]. In one version, it is made from a mixture of ingredients that include ground beef, vegetables, beans, and bread crumbs. Other versions include [[Mechanically_separated_meat|mechanically separated]] poultry and "dairy blend".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ARNETT, CARPENTER (CARTER), JOHNSON, SMALLEY, WILLIAMS, and WUEBBELS v.

==Legal challenges==

Although nutraloaf can be found in many United States prisons, its use is controversial. It was mentioned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1978 in ''[[Hutto v. Finney]]'' while ruling that conditions in the [[Arkansas Department of Correction|Arkansas penal system]] constituted [[cruel and unusual punishment]]. Prisoners were fed "{{not a typo|grue}}"&lt;!-- Not "GRUEL". See citation---&gt;, described as "a substance created by mashing meat, potatoes, oleo[margarine], syrup, vegetables, eggs, and seasoning into a paste and baking the mixture in a pan". The majority decision delivered by Justice [[John Paul Stevens|Stevens]] upheld an order from the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|8th Circuit Court]] that the {{not a typo|grue}} diet be discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Hutto v. Finney |vol=437 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=678 |pinpoint=10 |court=U.S. |date=1978 |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=437&amp;invol=678 |accessdate=2 January 2014 |quote=A filthy, overcrowded cell and a diet of '{{not a typo|grue}}' might be tolerable for a few days and intolerably cruel for weeks or months.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standards of the [[American Correctional Association]], which accredits prisons, discourage the use of food as a disciplinary measure, but adherence to the organization's food standards is voluntary.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/04/nyregion/our-towns-what-s-worse-than-solitary-confinement-just-taste-this.html | title = What's Worse Than Solitary Confinement?

[[Lawsuit]]s regarding nutraloaf have taken place in several states, including Illinois,&lt;ref name="Arnett_v_Snyder"&gt;[http://www.state.il.us/court/opinions/appellatecourt/2001/4thdistrict/october/html/4000895.htm Arnett v.

'''Phu Thai''' (Phuu Thai; Thai, Phu Thai: ''Phasa Phuthai'', [[wikt:ภาษาผู้ไท|ภาษาผู้ไท]] or ภูไท) is a [[Southwestern Tai languages|Southwestern Tai]] spoken in Laos and Thailand. Although it appears different from the [[Isan language|Isan]] and the [[Lao language]]s, it is spoken in areas where these languages are predominant and has been influenced by them. Comparisons of Phu Thai with other Tai languages such [[Tay Khang language|Tay Khang]].&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt; have not yet been done systematically enough to yield convincing results.&lt;br&gt;
Another aspect of Phu Thai is its contact with Katuic languages, a branch of the Austroasiatic languages. Whether in the Phu Thai areas of Central Laos or in more recent locations of Northeastern Thailand, one can find, along with Phu Thai, a few Katuic dialects known locally as Bru, So or Katang. James R. Chamberlain (2012) focusing on anthropological issues describes “the Phou Thay – Brou relationship” as a “symbiosis” and states that “the Phou Thay – Brou relationship has never evolved into a feudal system”.

==Speakers==
Speakers of the Phu Thai language in Thailand numbered about 156,000 in 1993. They can be found mainly in the areas around Mukdahan, especially [[Khamcha-i District]], [[Nakhon Phanom]], [[Ubon Ratchathani]], [[Kalasin]] and [[Sakon Nakhon]]. Phu Thai speakers live as well in the [[Khammouane Province|Khammouane]], [[Savannakhet]] provinces of Laos. Some speakers have been reported in [[Salavan Province|Saravan]], and [[Champasak Province|Champassak]] provinces of [[Laos]], northern areas of [[Vietnam]], and possibly also in [[China]].&lt;br&gt;
There is little dialect differentiation between the varieties spoken in Central Laos and in Northeastern Thailand.
Speakers identified as (or identifying themselves as) Phu Thai or Phu Tai in Vietnam speak other dialects with different tone systems.&lt;br&gt;
Tai Gapong or Tai Kapong found in the Nape district of Ban Nahuong, [[Bolikhamsai Province]], Laos speak a slightly different dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Schliesinger, Joachim. 2003. ''Ethnic Groups of Laos''. 2 vols. Bangkok: White Lotus Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In Vietnam the Phu Thai are included in the group of the [[Thái people]], together with the [[Tai Dam|Thái Đen]] ("Black Tai"), [[Tai Daeng people|Thái Đỏ]] ("Red Tai"), [[Tai Dón people|Thái Trắng]] ("White Tai"), [[Tai Thanh language|Tày Thanh]] and [[Tai Pao language|Thái Hàng Tổng]]. The group of the Thái people is the third largest of the fifty-four ethnic groups recognized by the Vietnamese government.

==Status==
Despite its rich heritage, and regional use, in Thailand this language group is increasingly becoming integrated into the mainstream Isan language.

[[Lester R. Brown]], a prominent [[environmentalist]] and founder of the [[Worldwatch Institute]] and [[Earth Policy Institute]], describes sustainable living in the twenty-first century as "shifting to a renewable energy-based, reuse/recycle economy with a diversified transport system."&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Greg. [http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/lester-brown "An interview with Lester Brown"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227004714/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/lester-brown |date=27 December 2016 }} ''American Scientist''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Derrick Jensen]] ("the poet-philosopher of the [[ecological movement]]"), a celebrated American [[author]], [[radical environmentalist]] and prominent critic of [[Bright green environmentalism|mainstream environmentalism]] argues that "[[industrial civilization]] is not and can never be sustainable".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-06-22|title=Endgame (Derrick Jensen books)|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Endgame_(Derrick_Jensen_books)&amp;oldid=786893218|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this statement, the natural conclusion is that sustainable living is at odds with industrialization. Thus, practitioners of the philosophy potentially face the challenge of living in an industrial society and adapting alternative norms, technologies, or practices.

Additionally, practical [[ecovillage]] builders like [[Living Villages]] maintain that the shift to alternative technologies will only be successful if the resultant built environment is attractive to a local [[culture]] and can be maintained and adapted as necessary over multiple generations.

Sustainable living is fundamentally the application of [[sustainability]] to lifestyle choice and decisions.  One conception of sustainable living expresses what it means in triple-bottom-line terms as meeting present ecological, societal, and economical needs without compromising these factors for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] [http://www.epa.gov/Sustainability "What is sustainability?"] Retrieved on: 20 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations General Assembly]] (2005).

Retrieved on: 25 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Another broader conception describes sustainable living in terms of four interconnected ''social'' domains: economics, ecology, politics and culture. In the first conception, sustainable living can be described as living within the innate carrying capacities defined by these factors. In the second or [[Circles of Sustainability]] conception, sustainable living can be described as negotiating the relationships of needs within limits across all the interconnected domains of social life, including consequences for future human generations and non-human [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;http://citiesprogramme.com/aboutus/our-approach/circles-of-sustainability&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sustainable design]] and [[sustainable development]] are critical factors to sustainable living. Sustainable design encompasses the development of [[appropriate technology]], which is a staple of sustainable living practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fritsch |first= Al |author2=Paul Gallimore  |title = Healing Appalachia: Sustainable Living Through Appropriate Technology |publisher= University Press of Kentucky |year= 2007 |isbn= 0-8131-2431-X |page= 2}} Unknown retrieval date, revised: 25 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Sustainable development in turn is the use of these technologies in infrastructure.

On a global scale, shelter is associated with about 25% of the [[greenhouse gas]] emissions embodied in household purchases and 26% of households' [[land use]].&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Ivanova"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Environmental Impact Assessment of Household Consumption|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.12371/abstract|journal = Journal of Industrial Ecology|date = 2015-12-01|issn = 1530-9290|pages = 526–536|doi = 10.1111/jiec.12371|language = en|first = Diana|last = Ivanova|first2 = Konstantin|last2 = Stadler|first3 = Kjartan|last3 = Steen-Olsen|first4 = Richard|last4 = Wood|first5 = Gibran|last5 = Vita|first6 = Arnold|last6 = Tukker|first7 = Edgar G.|last7 = Hertwich|volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

[[Green building|Sustainable homes]] are built using sustainable methods, materials, and facilitate green practices, enabling a more sustainable lifestyle. Their construction and maintenance have neutral impacts on the Earth. Often, if necessary, they are close in proximity to essential services such as grocery stores, schools, daycares, work, or public transit making it possible to commit to sustainable transportation choices.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery, Yvonne, Michael Grosvenor, and Liz Barclay. ''Green Living for Dummies.'' Indianapolis, IN: Wiley Pub., 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, they are [[off-the-grid]] homes that do not require any public energy, water, or sewer service.

If not off-the-grid, sustainable homes may be linked to a grid supplied by a power plant that is using sustainable power sources, buying power as is normal convention. Additionally, sustainable homes may be connected to a grid, but generate their own electricity through renewable means and sell any excess to a utility. There are two common methods to approaching this option: net metering and double metering.&lt;ref name="McDilda, Diane Gow 2007"&gt;McDilda, Diane Gow. ''The Everything Green Living Book: Easy Ways to Conserve Energy, Protect Your Family's Health, and Help save the Environment.'' Avon, MA: Adams Media, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Net metering uses the common meter that is installed in most homes, running forward when power is used from the grid, and running backward when power is put into the grid (which allows them to “net“ out their total energy use, putting excess energy into the grid when not needed, and using energy from the grid during peak hours, when you may not be able to produce enough immediately). Power companies can quickly purchase the power that is put back into the grid, as it is being produced. Double metering involves installing two meters: one measuring electricity consumed, the other measuring electricity created. Additionally, or in place of selling their renewable energy, sustainable home owners may choose to bank their excess energy by using it to charge batteries. This gives them the option to use the power later during less favorable power-generating times (i.e.: night-time, when there has been no wind, etc.), and to be completely independent of the [[electrical grid]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;McDilda, Diane Gow. ''The Everything Green Living Book: Easy Ways to Conserve Energy, Protect Your Family's Health, and Help save the Environment''. Avon, MA: Adams Media, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainably designed (see [[Sustainable Design]]) houses &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/greenbuilding/2010/05/18/what-is-a-sustainable-home-a-truly-green-home/|title=What is a Sustainable Home?

The design of a sustainable shelter affords the options it has later (i.e.: using [[Passive solar building design|passive solar lighting and heating]], creating temperature buffer zones by adding porches, deep overhangs to help create favorable microclimates, etc.)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton, Andy 2009"&gt;Hamilton, Andy, and Dave Hamilton. ''The Self-sufficient-ish Bible: an Eco-living Guide for the 21st Century.'' London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sustainably constructed houses involve environmentally friendly management of waste building materials such as recycling and composting, use non-toxic and renewable, recycled, reclaimed, or low-impact production materials that have been created and treated in a sustainable fashion (such as using organic or water-based finishes), use as much locally available materials and tools as possible so as to reduce the need for transportation, and use low-impact production methods (methods that minimize effects on the environment).&lt;ref&gt;Snell, Clarke, and Tim Callahan.

Many materials can be considered a “green” material until its background is revealed. Any material that has used toxic or carcinogenic chemicals in its treatment or manufacturing (such as [[formaldehyde]] in glues used in woodworking), has traveled extensively from its source or manufacturer, or has been cultivated or harvested in an unsustainable manner might not be considered green. In order for any material to be considered green, it must be resource efficient, not compromise [[indoor air quality]] or [[water conservation]], and be energy efficient (both in processing and when in use in the shelter).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Resource efficiency can be achieved by using as much recycled content, reusable or recyclable content, materials that employ recycled or recyclable packaging, locally available material, salvaged or remanufactured material, material that employs resource efficient manufacturing, and long-lasting material as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/greenbuilding/Materials/ Green Building Materials: Sustainable Building.] CalRecycle.

===Sustainable building materials===
Some building materials might be considered "sustainable" by some definitions and under some conditions.  For example,  wood might be thought of as sustainable if it is grown using [[sustainable forest management]], processed using [[sustainable energy]].  delivered by [[sustainable transport]], etc.:  Under different conditions, however, it might not be considered as sustainable.  The following materials might be considered as sustainable under certain conditions, based on a [[Life-cycle assessment]].

[[Building insulation|Insulation]] of a sustainable home is important because of the energy it conserves throughout the life of the home. Well insulated walls and lofts using green materials are a must as it reduces or, in combination with a house that is well designed, eliminates the need for heating and cooling altogether. Installation of insulation varies according to the type of insulation being used. Typically, lofts are insulated by strips of insulating material laid between rafters. Walls with cavities are done in much the same manner. For walls that do not have cavities behind them, solid-wall insulation may be necessary which can decrease internal space and can be expensive to install.&lt;ref name="Hamilton, Andy 2009"/&gt; Energy-efficient windows are another important factor in insulation. Simply assuring that windows (and doors) are well sealed greatly reduces energy loss in a home.&lt;ref name="McDilda, Diane Gow 2007"/&gt;  Double or Triple glazed windows are the typical method to insulating windows, trapping gas or creating a vacuum between two or three panes of glass allowing heat to be trapped inside or out.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; [[Low-emissivity]] or Low-E glass is another option for window insulation. It is a coating on windowpanes of a thin, transparent layer of metal oxide and works by reflecting heat back to its source, keeping the interior warm during the winter and cool during the summer. Simply hanging heavy-backed curtains in front of windows may also help their insulation.&lt;ref name="Hamilton, Andy 2009"/&gt; “Superwindows,” mentioned in [[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]], became available in the 1980s and use a combination of many available technologies, including two to three transparent low-e coatings, multiple panes of glass, and a heavy gas filling. Although more expensive, they are said to be able to insulate four and a half times better than a typical double-glazed windows.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, Paul, Amory B. Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins. ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the next Industrial Revolution.'' Boston: Little, Brown and, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Equipping roofs with highly reflective material (such as aluminum) increases a roof's [[albedo]] and will help reduce the amount of heat it absorbs, hence, the amount of energy needed to cool the building it is on. [[Green roofs]] or “living roofs” are a popular choice for thermally insulating a building. They are also popular for their ability to catch storm-water runoff and, when in the broader picture of a community, reduce the heat island effect (see [[urban heat island]]) thereby reducing energy costs of the entire area. It is arguable that they are able to replace the physical “footprint” that the building creates, helping reduce the adverse environmental impacts of the building‘s presence.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlip, Jamie.

Energy efficiency and water conservation are also major considerations in sustainable housing. If using appliances, computers, [[HVAC]] systems, electronics, or lighting the sustainable-minded often look for an [[Energy Star]] label, which is government-backed and holds stricter regulations in energy and water efficiency than is required by law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=products.pr_how_earn How a Product Earns the ENERGY STAR Label : ENERGY STAR."] ENERGY STAR.

Mono Lake Committee. Web. 27 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greywater]], including water from washing machines, sinks, showers, and baths may be reused in landscape irrigation and toilets as a method of water conservation. Likewise, [[rainwater harvesting]] from storm-water runoff is also a sustainable method to conserve water use in a sustainable shelter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/natres/06702.html Graywater Reuse and Rainwater Harvesting].

As mentioned under Shelter, some sustainable households may choose to produce their own renewable energy, while others may choose to purchase it through the grid from a power company that harnesses sustainable sources (also mentioned previously are the methods of metering the production and consumption of electricity in a household). Purchasing sustainable energy, however, may simply not be possible in some locations due to its limited availability. 6 out of the 50 states in the US do not offer green energy, for example. For those that do, its consumers typically buy a fixed amount or a percentage of their monthly consumption from a company of their choice and the bought green energy is fed into the entire national grid. Technically, in this case, the green energy is not being fed directly to the household that buys it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/home-garden/news/2007/07/buy-green-power-and-electricity-to-help-the-environment/overview/0707_buying_green_power_ov.htm Buy Green Power and Electricity to Help the Environment]. Consumer Reports: Expert Product Reviews and Product Ratings from Our Test Labs. Consumers Union of U.S., July 2007. Web. 28 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, it is possible that the amount of green electricity that the buying household receives is a small fraction of their total incoming electricity. This may or may not depend on the amount being purchased. The purpose of buying green electricity is to support their utility’s effort in producing sustainable energy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Hamilton, Andy, and Dave Hamilton. The Self-sufficient-ish Bible: an Eco-living Guide for the 21st Century. London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Producing sustainable energy on an individual household or community basis is much more flexible, but can still be limited in the richness of the sources that the location may afford (some locations may not be rich in renewable energy sources while others may have an abundance of it).

When generating renewable energy and feeding it back into the grid (in participating countries such as the US and Germany), producing households are typically paid at least the full standard electricity rate by their utility and are also given separate renewable energy credits that they can then sell to their utility, additionally (utilities are interested in buying these renewable energy credits because it allows them to claim that they produce renewable energy). In some special cases, producing households may be paid up to four times the standard electricity rate, but this is not common.&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith, Kate.

[[File:Solar panels in Ogiinuur.jpg|thumb|left|250px|An installation of [[solar panel]]s in rural Mongolia]]

Solar power harnesses the energy of the sun to make electricity. Two typical methods for converting solar energy into electricity are [[Solar cells|photo-voltaic cells]] that are organized into panels and [[concentrated solar power]], which uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight to either heat a fluid that runs an [[electrical generator]] via a [[steam turbine]] or [[heat engine]], or to simply cast onto photo-voltaic cells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/csp_program.html Solar Energy Technologies Program: Concentrating Solar Power]. Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy. US Department of Energy, 19 October 2010. Web. 31 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;McDilda, Diane Gow. The Everything Green Living Book: Easy Ways to Conserve Energy, Protect Your Family's Health, and Help save the Environment. Avon, MA: Adams Media, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The energy created by photo-voltaic cells is a [[direct current]] and has to be converted to [[alternating current]] before it can be used in a household. At this point, users can choose to either store this direct current in batteries for later use, or use an AC/DC inverter for immediate use. To get the best out of a solar panel, the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] of the sun should be between 20 and 50 degrees. Solar power via photo-voltaic cells are usually the most expensive method to harnessing renewable energy, but is falling in price as technology advances and public interest increases. It has the advantages of being portable, easy to use on an individual basis, readily available for government grants and incentives, and being flexible regarding location (though it is most efficient when used in hot, arid areas since they tend to be the most sunny).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; For those that are lucky, affordable rental schemes may be found.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Concentrated solar power plants are typically used on more of a community scale rather than an individual household scale, because of the amount of energy they are able to harness but can be done on an individual scale with a [[parabolic reflector]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeffery, Yvonne 2008"&gt;Jeffery, Yvonne, Michael Grosvenor, and Liz Barclay. Green Living for Dummies. Indianapolis, IN: Wiley Pub., 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solar thermal energy]] is harnessed by collecting direct heat from the sun. One of the most common ways that this method is used by households is through [[solar water heating]]. In a broad perspective, these systems involve well insulated tanks for storage and collectors, are either passive or active systems (active systems have pumps that continuously circulate water through the collectors and storage tank) and, in active systems, involve either directly heating the water that will be used or heating a non-freezing heat-transfer fluid that then heats the water that will be used. Passive systems are cheaper than active systems since they do not require a pumping system (instead, they take advantage of the natural movement of hot water rising above cold water to cycle the water being used through the collector and storage tank).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=12850 Energy Savers: Solar Water Heaters]. Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy. US Department of Energy, 20 October 2010. Web. 28 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods of harnessing solar power are [[Solar combisystem|solar space heating]] (for heating internal building spaces), solar drying (for drying wood chips, fruits, grains, etc.), [[solar cookers]], [[Solar distillation|solar distillers]], and other [[passive solar]] technologies (simply, harnessing sunlight without any mechanical means).

Wind power is harnessed through turbines, set on tall towers (typically 20’ or 6m with 10‘ or 3m diameter blades for an individual household‘s needs) that power a generator that creates electricity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; They typically require an average of wind speed of 9&amp;nbsp;mi/hr (14&amp;nbsp;km/hr) to be worth their investment (as prescribed by the US Department of Energy), and are capable of paying for themselves within their lifetimes. Wind turbines in urban areas usually need to be mounted at least 30’ (10m) in the air to receive enough wind and to be void of nearby obstructions (such as neighboring buildings). Mounting a wind turbine may also require permission from authorities. Wind turbines have been criticized for the noise they produce, their appearance, and the argument that they can affect the migratory patterns of birds (their blades obstruct passage in the sky). Wind turbines are much more feasible for those living in rural areas&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; and are one of the most cost-effective forms of renewable energy per kilowatt, approaching the cost of fossil fuels, and have quick paybacks.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

For those that have a body of water flowing at an adequate speed (or falling from an adequate height) on their property, [[hydroelectricity]] may be an option. On a large scale, hydroelectricity, in the form of dams, has adverse environmental and social impacts. When on a small scale, however, in the form of single turbines, hydroelectricity is very sustainable. Single water turbines or even a group of single turbines are not environmentally or socially disruptive. On an individual household basis, single turbines are the probably the only economically feasible route (but can have high paybacks and is one of the most efficient methods of renewable energy production). It is more common for an eco-village to use this method rather than a singular household.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Geothermal energy production involves harnessing the hot water or steam below the earth’s surface, in reservoirs, to produce energy. Because the hot water or steam that is used is reinjected back into the reservoir, this source is considered sustainable. However, those that plan on getting their electricity from this source should be aware that there is controversy over the lifespan of each geothermal reservoir as some believe that their lifespans are naturally limited (they cool down over time, making geothermal energy production there eventually impossible). This method is often large scale as the system required to harness geothermal energy can be complex and requires deep drilling equipment. There do exist small individual scale geothermal operations, however, which harness reservoirs very close to the Earth’s surface, avoiding the need for extensive drilling and sometimes even taking advantage of lakes or ponds where there is already a depression. In this case, the heat is captured and sent to a [[geothermal heat pump]] system located inside the shelter or facility that needs it (often, this heat is used directly to warm a greenhouse during the colder months).&lt;ref name="Jeffery, Yvonne 2008"/&gt; Although geothermal energy is available everywhere on Earth, practicality and cost-effectiveness varies, directly related to the depth required to reach reservoirs. Places such as the Philippines, Hawaii,  Alaska, Iceland, California, and Nevada have geothermal reservoirs closer to the Earth’s surface, making its production cost-effective.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

Biomass power is created when any biological matter is burned as fuel. As with the case of using green materials in a household, it is best to use as much locally available material as possible so as to reduce the carbon footprint created by transportation. Although burning biomass for fuel releases [[carbon dioxide]], sulfur compounds, and nitrogen compounds into the atmosphere, a major concern in a sustainable lifestyle, the amount that is released is sustainable (it will not contribute to a rise in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere). This is because the biological matter that is being burned releases the same amount of carbon dioxide that it consumed during its lifetime.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; However, burning [[biodiesel]] and bioethanol (see [[biofuel]]) when created from virgin material, is increasingly controversial and may or may not be considered sustainable because it inadvertently increases global poverty, the clearing of more land for new agriculture fields (the source of the biofuel is also the same source of food), and may use unsustainable growing methods (such as the use of environmentally harmful pesticides and fertilizers).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lester Russell. Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to save Civilization. New York: W.W. Norton, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Digestion of organic material to produce methane is becoming an increasingly popular method of biomass energy production. Materials such as waste sludge can be digested to release methane gas that can then be burnt to produce electricity. Methane gas is also a natural by-product of landfills, full of decomposing waste, and can be harnessed here to produce electricity as well. The advantage in burning methane gas is that is prevents the methane from being released into the atmosphere, exacerbating the greenhouse effect. Although this method of biomass energy production is typically large scale (done in landfills), it can be done on a smaller individual or community scale as well.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

==Food==
Globally, food accounts for 48% and 70% of household environmental impacts on land and water resources respectively, with consumption of meat, dairy and processed food rising quickly with income&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Ivanova"/&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Environmental impacts of industrial agriculture===

[[Industrial agriculture|Industrial agricultural production]] is highly resource and energy intensive.  Industrial agriculture systems typically require heavy [[irrigation]], extensive [[Pesticide application|pesticide]] and [[Fertilizer|fertilizer application]], intensive [[tillage]], concentrated [[monoculture]] production, and other continual inputs. As a result of these industrial farming conditions, today’s mounting environmental stresses are further exacerbated. These stresses include: declining [[water table]]s, chemical [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]], chemical [[Surface runoff|runoff]], [[soil erosion]], [[land degradation]], loss in [[biodiversity]], and other ecological concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lester R. ''Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization''. W.W. Norton, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conventional food distribution and long distance transport===

[[Conventional]] food distribution and long distance transport are additionally [[resource]] and [[energy]] exhaustive.  Substantial climate-disrupting [[carbon emissions]], boosted by the transport of food over long distances, are of growing concern as the world faces such [[global crisis]] as [[natural resource]] depletion, [[peak oil]] and [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;Heinberg, Richard. ''Powerdown: Options and Actions for a Post-Carbon World''. Canada: New Society Publishers, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; “The average American meal currently costs about 1500 miles, and takes about 10 [[calorie]]s of oil and other [[fossil fuel]]s to produce a single calorie of food.”&lt;ref name="Astyk, Sharon 2008"&gt;Astyk, Sharon. ''Depletion and Abundance: Life on the New Home Front''. Canada: New Society Publishers,  2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local and seasonal foods===

A more sustainable means of acquiring food is to purchase locally and seasonally. Buying food from local farmers reduces [[carbon output]], caused by long-distance food transport, and stimulates the local economy.&lt;ref name="Astyk, Sharon 2008"/&gt; Local, small-scale farming operations also typically utilize more sustainable methods of agriculture than conventional industrial farming systems such as decreased tillage, [[nutrient cycling]], fostered biodiversity and reduced chemical pesticide and fertilizer applications.&lt;ref name="Shiva, Vandana 2000"&gt;Shiva, Vandana. ''Stolen Harvest: The Hijacking of the Global Food Supply''. Cambridge, MA: South End Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Adapting a more regional, seasonally based diet is more sustainable as it entails purchasing less energy and resource demanding produce that naturally grow within a local area and require no long-distance transport. These vegetables and fruits are also grown and harvested within their suitable [[growing season]]. Thus, [[seasonal food]] farming does not require energy intensive [[greenhouse]] production, extensive irrigation, plastic packaging and long-distance transport from importing non-regional foods, and other environmental stressors.&lt;ref name="Seymour, John 2003"&gt;Seymour, John. ''The Self-Sufficient Life and How to Live It''. London: DK Publishing, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Local, seasonal produce is typically fresher, unprocessed and argued to be more nutritious. Local produce also contains less to no chemical residues from applications required for long-distance shipping and handling.&lt;ref&gt;Princen, Thomas. ''The Logic of Sufficiency''. New York: MIT Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Farmers' market]]s, public events where local small-scale farmers gather and sell their produce, are a good source for obtaining local food and knowledge about local farming productions.  As well as promoting localization of food, farmers markets are a central gathering place for community interaction.&lt;ref name="Todd, J 1994"&gt;Todd, J. and N. J. Todd. ''From Eco-Cities to Living Machines: Principles of Ecological Design''. Berkeley, CA:  North Atlantic Books, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another way to become involved in regional food distribution is by joining a local [[community-supported agriculture]] (CSA). A CSA consists of a community of growers and consumers who pledge to support a farming operation while equally sharing the risks and benefits of food production. CSA's usually involve a system of weekly pick-ups of locally farmed vegetables and fruits, sometimes including dairy products, meat and special food items such as baked goods.&lt;ref&gt;Nabhan, Gary. ''Coming Home to Eat''. Berkeley, CA: W.W. Norton, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the previously noted rising environmental crisis, the United States and much of the world is facing immense vulnerability to famine. Local food production ensures food security if potential transportation disruptions and climatic, economical, and sociopolitical disasters were to occur.&lt;ref name="Astyk, Sharon 2008"/&gt;

===Reducing meat consumption===

Industrial meat production also involves high environmental costs such as [[land degradation]], [[soil erosion]] and depletion of [[natural resource]]s, especially pertaining to water and food.&lt;ref name="Seymour, John 2003"/&gt; Mass meat production increase the amount of [[Atmospheric methane|methane in the atmosphere]].  For more information on the [[environmental impact of meat production]] and consumption, see the [[ethics of eating meat]]. Reducing meat consumption, perhaps to a few meals a week, or adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet, alleviates the demand for environmentally damaging industrial meat production. Buying and consuming organically raised, [[free range]] or [[Grass fed|grass fed meat]] is another alternative towards more sustainable meat consumption.&lt;ref name="Shiva, Vandana 2000"/&gt;

===Organic farming===

Purchasing and supporting organic products is another fundamental contribution to sustainable living. [[Organic farming]] is a rapidly emerging trend in the food industry and in the web of sustainability. According to the [[USDA]] [[National Organic Standards Board]] (NOSB), [[organic agriculture]] is defined as "an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activity. It is based on minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore, maintain, or enhance ecological harmony. The primary goal of organic agriculture is to optimize the health and productivity of interdependent communities of soil life, plants, animals and people." Upon sustaining these goals, organic agriculture uses techniques such as [[crop rotation]], [[permaculture]], [[compost]], [[green manure]] and [[biological pest control]]. In addition, organic farming prohibits or strictly limits the use of manufactured fertilizers and pesticides, [[plant growth regulators]] such as [[hormones]], livestock [[antibiotics]], [[food additives]] and [[genetically modified organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://extension.agron.iastate.edu/organicag/whatis.html Organic Agriculture - What is Organic Agriculture?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018130008/http://extension.agron.iastate.edu/organicag/whatis.html |date=18 October 2010 }} Iowa State University. 2008. Web. Retrieved on: 18 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Organically farmed products include vegetables, fruit, grains, herbs, meat, dairy, eggs, fibers, and flowers. See [[organic certification]] for more information.

===Urban gardening===
[[File:Ganjiaxiang - edible landscaping - P1070640.JPG|thumb|"Edible landscaping": a vegetable garden incorporated by the local residents into a roadside park. [[Qixia District]], [[Nanjing]], China]]
In addition to local, small-scale farms, there has been a recent emergence in [[urban agriculture]] expanding from [[community gardens]] to private [[home gardens]]. With this trend, both farmers and ordinary people are becoming involved in [[food production]]. A network of urban farming systems helps to further ensure regional food security and encourages self-sufficiency and cooperative interdependence within communities.&lt;ref&gt;Flores, H.C. ''Food Not Lawns: How to Turn Your Yard into a Garden and Your Neighborhood into a Community''. New York: Chelsea Green, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; With every bite of food raised from urban gardens, negative environmental impacts are reduced in numerous ways. For instance, vegetables and fruits raised within small-scale gardens and farms are not grown with tremendous applications of [[nitrogen fertilizer]] required for industrial agricultural operations. The nitrogen fertilizers cause toxic chemical leaching and runoff that enters our water tables. Nitrogen fertilizer also produces [[nitrous oxide]], a more damaging [[greenhouse gas]] than [[carbon dioxide]]. Local, community-grown food also requires no imported, long-distance transport which further depletes our [[fossil fuel]] reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Nyerges, Christopher. ''Urban Wilderness: a guidebook to resourceful city living''. Culver, CA: Peace Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; In developing more efficiency per land acre, urban gardens can be started in a wide variety of areas: in vacant lots, public parks, private yards, church and school yards, on roof tops ([[roof-top garden]]s), and many other places.  Communities can work together in changing zoning limitations in order for public and private gardens to be permissible.&lt;ref&gt;Hemenway, Toby. ''Gaia’s Garden''. New York: Chelsea Green, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetically pleasing [[edible landscaping]] plants can also be incorporated into city landscaping such as blueberry bushes, grapevines trained on an arbor, pecan trees, etc.&lt;ref name="Todd, J 1994"/&gt; With as small a scale as home or community farming, sustainable and organic farming methods can easily be utilized. Such sustainable, organic farming techniques include: [[composting]], [[biological pest control]], [[crop rotation]], [[mulching]], [[drip irrigation]], [[nutrient cycling]] and [[permaculture]].&lt;ref&gt;Warde, Jon, ed. ''The Backyard Builder: Over 150 Projects for Your Garden, Home and Yard''. New York:  Random House, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; For more information on sustainable farming systems, see [[sustainable agriculture]].

===Food preservation and storage===

Preserving and storing foods reduces reliance on long-distance transported food and the market industry. Home-grown foods can be preserved and stored outside of their growing season and continually consumed throughout the year, enhancing self-sufficiency and independence from the supermarket. Food can be preserved and saved by [[Dehydration (food)|dehydration]], [[Freezing (food)|freezing]], [[vacuum packing]], [[canning]], [[bottling]], [[pickling]] and jellying.&lt;ref&gt;Ciperthwaite, Wm. ''A Handmade Life: In Search of Simplicity''. New York: Chelsea Green, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; For more information, see [[food preservation]].

==Transportation==
{{main|Sustainable transport}}
[[File:20120623 ChevyVolt-Chicago-Compost.jpg|thumb|A [[carsharing]] [[plug-in hybrid]] vehicle being used to drop off [[compost]] at an urban facility in [[Chicago]].]]
With rising [[peak oil]] concerns, [[climate warming]] exacerbated by [[carbon emissions]] and high energy prices, the conventional [[automobile industry]] is becoming less and less feasible to the conversation of sustainability. Revisions of [[Public transport|urban transport]] systems that foster mobility, low-cost transportation and healthier urban environments are needed. Such urban transport systems should consist of a combination of [[rail transport]], [[bus transport]], [[bicycle]] pathways and [[pedestrian]] [[walkways]]. Public transport systems such as underground rail systems and bus transit systems shift huge numbers of people away from reliance on car [[mobilization]] and dramatically reduce the rate of carbon emissions caused by automobile transport.&lt;ref name="Brown, Lester R. 2009"&gt;Brown, Lester R. ''Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization''. New York: W.W. Norton, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carpooling]] is another alternative for reducing oil consumption and carbon emissions by transit.

In comparison to automobiles, bicycles are a paragon of energy efficient personal transportation with the bicycle roughly 50 times more energy efficient than driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/14/science/the-bicycle-and-the-ride-to-modern-america.html|title=The Bicycle and the Ride to Modern America|date=13 July 2015|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bicycles increase mobility while alleviating [[Traffic congestion|congestion]], lowering [[Air pollution|air]] and [[noise pollution]], and increasing [[physical exercise]]. Most importantly, they do not emit climate-disturbing [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Brown, Lester R. 2009"/&gt; [[Bike-sharing]] programs are beginning to boom throughout the world and are modeled in leading cities such as [[Paris]], [[Amsterdam]] and [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaheen|first=Susan|author2=Stacey Guzman|title=Worldwide Bikesharing|journal=Access Magazine|year=2011|url=http://uctc.net/access/39/access39_bikesharing.shtml|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326063609/http://www.uctc.net/access/39/access39_bikesharing.shtml|archivedate=26 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bike-sharing programs offer [[kiosks]] and docking stations that supply hundreds to thousands of bikes for rental throughout a city through small deposits or affordable memberships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaheen|first=Susan|author2=Guzman, S.|author3=H. Zhang|title=Bikesharing in Europe, the Americas, and Asia: Past, Present, and Future|journal=Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research|year=2010|url=http://76.12.4.249/artman2/uploads/1/Bikesharing_in_Europe__the_Americas__and_Asia.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610155608/http://76.12.4.249/artman2/uploads/1/Bikesharing_in_Europe__the_Americas__and_Asia.pdf|archivedate=10 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent boom has occurred in [[electric bicycles|electric bikes]] especially in China and other Asian countries. Electric bikes are similar to [[plug-in hybrid]] vehicles in that they are battery powered and can be plugged into the provincial [[electric grid]] for recharging as needed. In contrast to plug-in hybrid cars, electric bikes do not directly use any [[fossil fuels]].  Adequate sustainable urban transportation is dependent upon proper city [[infrastructure]] and planning that incorporates efficient public transit along with bicycle and pedestrian-friendly pathways.&lt;ref name="Brown, Lester R. 2009" /&gt;  Patrick Maria Johnson was the founder of this.

==Water==
{{Contradicts other|date=December 2013|1=Water efficiency}}
{{main|Water efficiency}}
A major factor of sustainable living involves that which no human can live without, [[water]]. Unsustainable water use has far reaching implications for humankind.  Currently, humans use one-fourth of the Earth’s total fresh water in natural circulation, and over half the accessible [[Surface runoff|runoff]].&lt;ref name="Hawken, Paul 1999"&gt;Hawken, Paul, Amory Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins. ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution''. New York City: Little, Brown and Company, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[population growth]] and water demand is ever increasing. Thus, it is necessary to use available water more efficiently. In sustainable living, one can use water more sustainably through a series of simple, everyday measures.  These measures involve considering indoor [[home appliance]] efficiency, outdoor water use, and daily water use awareness.

===Indoor home appliances===

Housing and [[commercial buildings]] account for 12 percent of America’s freshwater withdrawals.&lt;ref name="Hawken, Paul 1999"/&gt;  A typical American single family home uses about {{convert|70|USgal|L}} per person per day indoors.&lt;ref name="Hawken, Paul 1999"/&gt; This use can be reduced by simple alterations in behavior and upgrades to [[Home appliance|appliance]] quality.

====Toilets====

[[Toilets]] accounted for almost 30% of residential indoor water use in the United States in 1999.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/watersense/pubs/indoor.html Indoor Water Use in the United States] WaterSense: An EPA Partnership Program. US Environmental Protection Agency, 9 November 2010. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; One flush of a standard U.S. toilet requires more water than most individuals, and many families, in the world use for all their needs in an entire day.&lt;ref name="HawkenPaul"&gt;Hawken, Paul, Amory Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins. ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution.'' New York City: Little, Brown and Company, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
A home’s toilet water sustainability can be improved in one of two ways: improving the current toilet or installing a more efficient toilet.  To improve the current toilet, one possible method is to put weighted plastic bottles in the toilet tank.  Also, there are inexpensive tank banks or float booster available for purchase.  A tank bank is a plastic bag to be filled with water and hung in the toilet tank. A [http://www.floatbooster.com/Product.html float booster] attaches underneath the float ball of pre-1986 three and a half gallon capacity toilets.  It allows these toilets to operate at the same valve and float setting but significantly reduces their water level, saving between one and one and a third gallons of water per flush.  A major waste of water in existing toilets is leaks.  A slow toilet leak is undetectable to the eye, but can waste hundreds of gallons each month.  One way to check this is to put food dye in the tank, and to see if the water in the toilet bowl turns the same color.  In the event of a leaky flapper, one can replace it with an adjustable toilet flapper, which allows self-adjustment of the amount of water per flush.

If installing a new toilet there are a number of options to obtain the most water efficient model. A [[low flush toilet]] uses one to two gallons per flush.  Traditionally, toilets use three to five gallons per flush. If an eighteen-liter per flush toilet is removed and a six-liter per flush toilet is put in its place, 70% of the water flushed will be saved while the overall indoor water use by will be reduced by 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanbuildersnyc.com/Green_Building.html Green Building Health and Environmental Considerations in Building and Renovating Today] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130194906/http://urbanbuildersnyc.com/Green_Building.html |date=30 November 2010 }} Urban Builders Group. Urban Builders Group LTD. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to have a toilet that uses no water.  A [[composting toilet]] treats human waste through [[composting]] and [[dehydration]], producing a valuable soil additive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://compostingtoilet.org/compost_toilets_explained/what_is_a_composting_toilet/index.php What is a Composting Toilet?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120223832/http://compostingtoilet.org/compost_toilets_explained/what_is_a_composting_toilet/index.php |date=20 November 2010 }} Composting Toilet World. Envirolet. 2010. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  These toilets feature a two-compartment bowl to separate urine from feces.  The urine can be collected or sold as fertilizer.  The feces can be dried and bagged or composted.  These toilets cost scarcely more than regularly installed toilets and do not require a sewer hookup.  In addition to providing valuable fertilizer, these toilets are highly sustainable because they save sewage collection and treatment, as well as lessen agricultural costs and improve [[topsoil]].

Additionally, one can reduce toilet water sustainability by limiting total toilet flushing. For instance, instead of flushing small wastes, such as tissues, one can dispose of these items in the trash or compost.

====Showers====

On average, showers were 18% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999, at {{convert|6|-|8|USgal|L}} per minute traditionally in America.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; A simple method to reduce this use is to switch to low-flow, high-performance showerheads.  These showerheads use only 1.0-1.5 gpm or less. An alternative to replacing the showerhead is to install a converter. This device arrests a running shower upon reaching the desired temperature.  [[Solar water heater]]s can be used to obtain optimal water temperature, and are more sustainable because they reduce dependence on fossil fuels. To lessen excess water use, water pipes can be insulated with pre-slit foam pipe insulation. This insulation decreases hot water generation time. A simple, straightforward method to conserve water when showering is to take shorter showers.   One method to accomplish this is to turn off the water when it is not necessary (such as while lathering) and resuming the shower when water is necessary.  This can be facilitated when the plumbing or showerhead allow turning off the water without disrupting the desired temperature setting (common in the UK but not the United States).

====Dishwashers and sinks====

On average, sinks were 15% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; There are, however, easy methods to rectify excessive water loss. Available for purchase is a screw-on aerator. This device works by combining water with air thus generating a frothy substance with greater perceived volume, reducing water use by half. Additionally, there is a flip-valve available that allows flow to be turned off and back on at the previously reached temperature. Finally, a [[laminar flow]] device creates a 1.5-2.4 gpm stream of water that reduces water use by half, but can be turned to normal water level when optimal.

In addition to buying the above devices, one can live more sustainably by checking sinks for leaks, and fixing these links if they exist. According to the EPA, "A small drip from a worn faucet washer can waste 20 gallons of water per day, while larger leaks can waste hundreds of gallons".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; When washing dishes by hand, it is not necessary to leave the water running for rinsing, and it is more efficient to rinse dishes simultaneously.

On average, dishwashing consumes 1% of indoor water use.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; When using a [[dishwasher]], water can be conserved by only running the machine when it is full.  Some have a "low flow" setting to use less water per wash cycle. Enzymatic [[detergents]] clean dishes more efficiently and more successfully with a smaller amount of water at a lower temperature.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

====Washing machines====

On average, 23% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999 was due to clothes washing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In contrast to other machines, American [[washing machines]] have changed little to become more sustainable. A typical washing machine has a vertical-axis design, in which clothes are agitated in a tubful of water. Horizontal-axis machines, in contrast, put less water into the bottom of the rub and rotate clothes through it. These machines are more efficient in terms of soap use and clothing stability.

===Outdoor water use===

There are a number of ways one can incorporate a personal [[yard]], [[roof]], and [[garden]] in more sustainable living. While conserving water is a major element of sustainability, so is sequestering water.

====Conserving water====

In planning a yard and garden space, it is most sustainable to consider the plants, soil, and available water.  Drought resistant shrubs, plants, and grasses require a smaller amount of water in comparison to more traditional species.  Additionally, native plants (as opposed to herbaceous perennials) will use a smaller supply of water and have a heightened resistance to plant diseases of the area.  [[Xeriscaping]] is a technique that selects drought-tolerant plants and accounts for endemic features such as [[slope]], [[soil type]], and [[native plant]] range.  It can reduce landscape water use by 50 – 70%, while providing [[habitat]] space for wildlife.  Plants on slopes help reduce [[Surface runoff|runoff]] by slowing and absorbing accumulated rainfall.  Grouping plants by watering needs further reduces water waste.

After planting, placing a circumference of [[mulch]] surrounding plants functions to lessen [[evaporation]].  To do this, firmly press two to four inches of organic matter along the plant's dripline. This prevents [[water runoff]].   When watering, consider the range of sprinklers; watering paved areas is unnecessary.  Additionally, to conserve the maximum amount of water, watering should be carried out during early mornings on non-windy days to reduce water loss to evaporation.  Drip-irrigation systems and soaker hoses are a more sustainable alternative to the traditional sprinkler system.  Drip-irrigation systems employ small gaps at standard distances in a hose, leading to the slow trickle of water droplets which percolate the soil over a protracted period.  These systems use 30 – 50% less water than conventional methods.&lt;ref&gt;Pinkham, R. and Dyer, J., 1993: "Linking Water and Energy Savings in Irrigation," Rocky Mountain Institute Publication #A94-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Soaker hoses help to reduce water use by up to 90%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savingwater.org/docs/successwithsoakerhoses.pdf Soaker Hoses: Good for your Garden, Your Wallet, and Our Environment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011035501/http://www.savingwater.org/docs/successwithsoakerhoses.pdf |date=11 October 2010 }} Saving Water Partnership. Seattle and Participating Area Water Utilities. 2005. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  They connect to a garden hose and lay along the row of plants under a layer of mulch.  A layer of [[organic material]] added to the soil helps to increase its absorption and water retention; previously planted areas can be covered with [[compost]].

In caring for a lawn, there are a number of measures that can increase the sustainability of lawn maintenance techniques.  A primary aspect of lawn care is watering.  To conserve water, it is important to only water when necessary, and to deep soak when watering.  Additionally, a lawn may be left to go dormant, renewing after a dry spell to its original vitality.

====Sequestering water====

A common method of water sequestrations is [[rainwater harvesting]], which incorporates the collection and storage of rain.  Primarily, the rain is obtained from a roof, and stored on the ground in catchment tanks.  Water sequestration varies based on extent, cost, and complexity.   A simple method involves a single barrel at the bottom of a downspout, while a more complex method involves multiple tanks.  It is highly sustainable to use stored water in place of purified water for activities such as irrigation and flushing toilets.  Additionally, using stored rainwater reduces the amount of runoff [[pollution]], picked up from roofs and pavements that would normally enter streams through storm drains.  The following equation can be used to estimate annual water supply:

Collection area (square feet) × Rainfall (inch/year) / 12 (inch/foot) = Cubic Feet of Water/Year

Cubic Feet/Year × 7.43 (Gallons/Cubic Foot) = Gallons/year

Note, however, this calculation does not account for losses such as evaporation or leakage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portlandonline.com/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=182095 How to Manage Stormwater: Rain Barrels]. Stormwater Management for Clean Rivers. Environmental Services. Web. 10 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greywater]] systems function in sequestering used indoor water, such as laundry, bath and sink water, and filtering it for reuse.  Greywater can be reused in [[irrigation]] and toilet flushing.  There are two types of greywater systems: gravity fed manual systems and package systems.&lt;ref name="greenbuildingsupply1"&gt;[http://www.greenbuildingsupply.com/Public/Energy-WaterConservation/GreywaterSystems/index.cfm Greywater Systems: Reusing Bath, Laundry, and Sink Water to Conserve Fresh Water]. Green Building Supply. 2010. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The manual systems do not require electricity but may require a larger yard space.&lt;ref name="greenbuildingsupply1"/&gt;  The package systems require electricity but are self-contained and can be installed indoors.&lt;ref name="greenbuildingsupply1"/&gt;

==Waste==

As populations and resource demands climb, waste production contributes to [[Greenhouse gas#Greenhouse gas emissions|emissions]] of [[carbon dioxide]], leaching of hazardous materials into the soil and waterways, and [[methane emissions]].  In America alone, over the course of a decade, 500 trillion pounds of American resources will have been transformed into nonproductive wastes and gases.&lt;ref name="HawkenPaul" /&gt; Thus, a crucial component of sustainable living is being waste conscious.  One can do this by reducing waste, reusing commodities, and recycling.

There are a number of ways to reduce waste in sustainable living.  Two methods to reduce paper waste are canceling junk mail like [https://www.optoutprescreen.com/?rf=t credit card and insurance offers] and [http://www.dmachoice.org/ direct mail marketing] and changing monthly paper statements to paperless emails.  Junk mail alone accounted for 1.72 million tons of landfill waste in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catalogchoice.org/environmental-facts|title=CatalogChoice Mail Preference Service - Put an end to junk mail, catalogs, and phone books.|website=CatalogChoice Mail Preference Service|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method to reduce waste is to buy in bulk, reducing packaging materials. Preventing food waste can limit the amount of organic waste sent to landfills producing the powerful greenhouse gas methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earthwormtechnologies.com/about-us/|title=Our Story|first=Earthworm|last=Technologies®|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of waste reduction involves being cognizant of purchasing excessive amounts when buying materials with limited use like cans of paint. Non-hazardous or less hazardous alternatives can also limit the toxicity of waste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/rrr/recycle.htm Reduce] United States Environmental Protection Agency. 5 May 2010. Web 10 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

By reusing materials, one lives more sustainably by not contributing to the addition of waste to landfills. Reusing saves [[natural resources]] by decreasing the necessity of [[raw material]] extraction. For example, reusable bags can reduce the amount of waste created by grocery shopping eliminating the need to create and ship plastic bags and the need to manage their disposal and recycling or polluting effects.

[[Recycling]], a process that breaks down used items into raw materials to make new materials, is a particularly useful means of contributing to the renewal of goods.  Recycling incorporates three primary processes; collection and processing, manufacturing, and purchasing recycled products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/rrr/recycle.htm Wastes – Resource Conservation – Reduce, Reuse, Recycle] United States Environmental Protection Agency.  5 May 2010. Web 10 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  A natural example of recycling involves using food waste as compost to enrich the quality of soil, which can be carried out at home or locally with community [[composting]]. An offshoot of recycling, [[upcycling]], strives to convert material into something of similar or greater value in its second life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustainabilitydictionary.com/u/upcycle.php UpCycle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112170212/http://www.sustainabilitydictionary.com/u/upcycle.php |date=12 November 2010 }} Sustainability Management. Presidio Graduate School. Web. 10 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; By integrating measures of reusing, reducing, and recycling one can effectively reduce personal waste and use materials in a more sustainable manner.

The '''Texas Department of Family and Protective Services''' ('''DFPS''') is responsible for investigating charges of abuse, neglect or exploitation of children, elderly adults and adults with disabilities. Prior to its creation in 2004, the agency had been called the '''Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services''' ('''DPRS''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.dfps.state.tx.us/About_DFPS/ | title= About DFPS | publisher= Texas Department of Family and Protective Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.utexas.edu/research/cswr/survey/part/nar_pdf/530nar.pdf 530nar.pdf]." ''[[University of Texas]]''.  Accessed 13 de marzo 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Texas Attorney General]], DFPS is neither a juvenile nor an adult criminal justice agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.tjpc.state.tx.us/publications/reviews/05/05-2-24.htm| title= Texas Attorney General concludes Texas Department of Family and Protective Services cannot access juvenile records under Family Code| publisher= [[Texas Juvenile Probation Commission]]| date= 24 February 2005| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080602160838/http://www.tjpc.state.tx.us/publications/reviews/05/05-2-24.htm| archivedate= 2 June 2008| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Texas Juvenile Justice Department]] is the state juvenile justice agency, while the [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]] is the adult justice agency.

The agency is headquartered at the John H. Winters Human Services Center at 701 West 51st Street in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.dfps.state.tx.us/Contact_Us/Default.asp Contact Us]." ''Texas Department of Family and Protective Services''. Accessed August 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mandate==

The DFPS undertakes five major tasks:
*Adult protective services
*Child protective services
*Child care licensing
*Prevention and early intervention
*Statewide intake&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dfps.state.tx.us/About_DFPS/default.asp|title=DFPS - About DFPS|website=www.dfps.state.tx.us|language=en|access-date=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was created effective February 1, 2004 by House Bill 2292 of the 78th [[Texas Legislature]] (2003) as the first new agency in a major reorganization of Texas's health and human services system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.hhs.state.tx.us/news/release/archives/020204_Launch.shtml | title= New Texas Department of Family and Protective Services Launches | date= 2 February 2004 | publisher= [[Texas  Health and Human Services Commission]] | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080602161943/http://www.hhs.state.tx.us/news/release/archives/020204_Launch.shtml | archivedate= 2 June 2008 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The change was made to help "consolidate organizational structures and functions, eliminate duplicative administrative systems, and streamline processes and procedures that guide the delivery of health and human services to Texans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.sos.state.tx.us/texreg/transfers/family040904.html | title= Notice of Agency Name Change | publisher= [[Texas Secretary of State]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comptroller findings===
DFPS has a documented history of issues with children placed in its care. A 2004 report by Texas Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn was very critical of the Texas foster care system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.window.state.tx.us/forgottenchildren/ | title= Forgotten Children: A Special Report on the Texas Foster Care System | date= April 2004 | last= Strayhorn | first = Carole Keeton | publisher= Office of the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts (State of Texas)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up statement with continued criticisms of the Texas foster care system was made in 2006 by the Comptroller and renewed a request to have the governor create a Family and Protective Services Crisis Management Team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.window.state.tx.us/news/60623statement.html | title= Comptroller Strayhorn Statement On Foster Care Abuse | date= 23 June 2006 | last= Strayhorn | first = Carole Keeton | publisher= Office of the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts (State of Texas)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Comptroller stated that in fiscal 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively 30, 38 and 48 foster children died in the state's care. The number of foster children in the state's care increased 24 percent to 32,474 in Fiscal 2005, while the number of deaths increased 60 percent. Compared to the general population, a child is four times more likely to die in the Texas foster care system. In 2004, about 100 children were treated for poisoning from medications; 63 were treated for rape that occurred while under state care including four-year-old twin boys, and 142 children gave birth. A 12-year-old boy died in December 2005, suffocated while being restrained from behind by an employee of the facility. Another died May 30, after drowning in a creek during a bicycle outing. A three-year-old was treated for poisoning from an atypical, mind-altering anti-psychotic drug.

The Comptroller's office also found significant financial problems in a 2005 audit of DFPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://fmx.cpa.state.tx.us/fm/audit/ar05-1q/fps.php | title= Claims Post-Payment Audit Report Summary (Fiscal 2005 First Quarter) | publisher= Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070613195625/https://fmx.cpa.state.tx.us/fm/audit/ar05-1q/fps.php | archivedate= 2007-06-13 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===YFZ Ranch FLDS raid===
{{main article|YFZ Ranch}}

Gene Grounds of Victim Relief Ministries reported no hysteria or crying children from children removed from the ranch. He commended CPS workers as exhibiting compassion, professionalism and caring concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url= http://www.kvue.com/news/state/stories/041808kvuejanetpolygamy-cb.779df065.html | title= Richardson group: Polygamists' children are OK | date= 18 April 2008 | first= Janet | last= St. James | publisher= [[WFAA-TV]] }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Kight, chairman of an organization that provided mental health workers to assist [[FLDS]] children and mothers from the [[YFZ Ranch]] recounted to the Texas governor's office that DFPS' [[Child Protective Services]] had seemed out of control at the temporary shelters, describing "how abusive CPS was and how they've trampled all over their rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,700225591,00.html | title= Chairman says Texas CPS workers mistreated FLDS | first= Brian | last= West | publisher= ''[[Deseret News]]'' | date= 13 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the workers who assisted at the shelter remarked that "wonderful loving women and children are being treated like convicts in a concentration camp by the state of Texas".&lt;ref name=SLT-Caregivers&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.sltrib.com/polygamy/ci_9238520 | title= Caregivers blast Texas' treatment of polygamous sect's women, children | publisher= ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'' | first= Julia | last= Lyon | date= 13 May 2008 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080514024257/http://www.sltrib.com/polygamy/ci_9238520 | archivedate= 14 May 2008 | df=  }} &lt;br/&gt; Some quotes found in two of the original affidavits linked to from this article titled: [http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site297/2008/0512/20080512_043826_FLDS_10.pdf "This incident... is not what America or Texas stands for."]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527193755/http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site297/2008/0512/20080512_043826_FLDS_10.pdf |date=2008-05-27 }} and [http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site297/2008/0512/20080512_043931_FLDS_11.pdf "Even the simplest request was discounted."]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527193748/http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site297/2008/0512/20080512_043931_FLDS_11.pdf |date=2008-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another wrote "I have never seen women and children treated this poorly, not to mention their civil rights being disregarded in this manner" after assisting at the emergency shelter. "The CPS workers were openly rude to the mothers and children, yelled at them for tryin to wave to friends.. threatened them with arrest if they did not stop waving"&lt;ref name= SLT-Caregivers /&gt; Workers took notes on everything the "guests" said. Some compared it to a prison or [[internment#Concentration camp|concentration camp]]. By contrast, one worker noted the children were "amazingly clean, happy, healthy, energetic, well behaved and self-confident," while the mothers were "consistently calm, patient and loving with their children."

Ultimately, both the Court of Appeals for the Third District and the Texas Supreme Court found that CPS improperly removed all the children and ordered them returned to their parents.

Caregivers who were previously forbidden to discuss conditions working with CPS later produced unsigned written reports expressed anger at the CPS traumatizing the children, and for disregarding rights of mothers who appeared to be parents of healthy, well-behaved children. CPS threatened some workers with arrest, and the entire mental health support was dismissed the second week due to being "too compassionate."  Workers believed poor sanitary conditions at the shelter allowed respiratory infections and chicken pox to spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url= http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/metro/5770183.html | title= Mental health workers rip CPS over sect | publisher= ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'' | first= Roger | last= Crotea | date= 10 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being removed from the temporary shelters the FLDS children were placed in 16 group shelters and foster homes. Minors with children were sent to the Seton Home in San Antonio, older boys to Cal Farley's Boys Ranch in Amarillo. Some parents stated on the Today Show that they were unable to visit their boys due to a shortage of CPS staff. Newspapers released names of facilities caring for the FLDS children that have requested donations of specific items, help or cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url= http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_9148958 | title= FLDS children adapt old ways to new homes | publisher= ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'' | date= 5 May 2008 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080517012353/http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_9148958 | archivedate= 17 May 2008 | df=  }} By Julia Lyon, Brooke Adams and Nate Carlisle&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 lawsuit===
The DFPS has also been the subject of a recent lawsuit alleging, among other complaints, that foster children are inappropriately placed in restrictive institutional settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Group care for foster kids: Critics seek phase-out|first=David|last=Crary|date=|work=[[The Washington Post]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/group-care-for-foster-kids-critics-seek-phase-out/2014/05/17/9635b1aa-dde7-11e3-a837-8835df6c12c4_story.html|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Children's Rights, a New York-based national advocacy group working to reform child welfare systems, filed a federal [[class action]] lawsuit in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas]] alleging the DFPS routinely fails to either return children who've been in foster care at least a year safely to their families or to find them safe, appropriate, and permanent new families.&lt;ref name=complaint&gt;[http://www.childrensrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/2011-03-29_tx_complaint_final.pdf PLAINTIFFS’ ORIGINAL COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF AND REQUEST FOR CLASS ACTION], M.D. v.

Perry)|publisher=Children's Rights|url=http://www.childrensrights.org/reform-campaigns/legal-cases/texas/|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also claim that after approximately one year, or a maximum of 18 months, without successfully reunifying children with their birth families or finding them adoptive homes, children become permanent wards of the state, a status known as "permanent managing conservatorship" (PMC), and that after entering this permanent foster care status, many children have little hope for stable, permanent families and instead are shuffled between a variety of foster and institutional placements that are poorly supervised by the state.&lt;ref name=complaint/&gt;

The Circumplex Model is a graphical representation of emotional states. Fundamentally, it is a circle with pleasant on the left, unpleasant on the right, activation on the top, and deactivation on the bottom. All the other emotions are placed around the circle as combinations of these four basic states. It is based on the theory that people experience emotions as overlapping and ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2367156|year=2005|author1=Posner|first1=J|title=The circumplex model of affect: An integrative approach to affective neuroscience, cognitive development, and psychopathology|journal=Development and Psychopathology|volume=17|issue=3|pages=715–734|last2=Russell|first2=J.

It is of most interest in the business world, the workforce, or any other setting where the performance of a group is important. [[Joseph E McGrath]] enlarged the circumplex model to include group dynamics, based on the work of Shaw, Carter, Hackman, Steiner, Shiflett, Taylor, Lorge, Davis, Laughlin, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A CIRCUMPLEX MODEL OF GROUP TASK TYPES|url=https://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/content/psyifp/aeechterhoff/wintersemester2011-12/vorlesungkommperskonflikt/mcgrath_groupinteractperfom_1984.pdf|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four quadrants in this model representing: generating a task, choosing correct procedure, conflict resolution, and execution, and again there are subtypes distributed around the circle. He used this model as a research tool to evaluate group task performance.

== Group dynamics ==
[[Group dynamics]] involve the influential actions, processes and changes that exist both within and between groups.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book
| title = Group dynamics
| last = Forsyth
| first = D. R.
| publisher = Wadsworth
| year = 2009

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group dynamics also involve the scientific study of group processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through extensive research in the field of group dynamics, it is now well known that all groups, despite their innumerable differences, possess common properties and dynamics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Social psychological researchers have attempted to organize these commonalities, in order to further understand the genuine nature of group processes.

For instance, social psychological research indicates that there are numerous goal-related interactions and activities that groups of all sizes undertake . These interactions have been categorized by [[Robert F. Bales]], who spent his entire life attempting to find an answer to the question, "What do people do when they are in groups?".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To simplify the understanding of group interactions, Bales concluded that all interactions within groups could be categorized as either a ''relationship interaction'' (or socioemotional interaction) or a ''task interaction''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| last = Bales
| first = R. F.
| publisher = Transaction

| location = New Brunswick, NJ

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Just as Bales was determined to identify the basic types of '''interactions''' involved in groups, [[Joseph E. McGrath]] was determined to identify the various '''goal-related activities''' that are regularly displayed by groups. McGrath contributed greatly to the understanding of group dynamics through the development of his '''circumplex model of group tasks'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As intended, McGrath's model effectively organizes all group-related activities by distinguishing between four basic group goals. These goals are referred to as the circumplex model of group task's four quadrants, which are categorized based on the dominant performance process involved in a group's task of interest.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breakdown ===
The four quadrants are as follows: 
# '''''Generating''' ideas or plans''
# '''''Choosing''' a solution''
# '''''Negotiating''' a solution to a conflict'' 
# '''''Executing''' a task''

To further differentiate the various goal-related group activities, McGrath further sub-divides these four categories, resulting in eight categories in total. The breakdown of these categories is as follows:

1. &lt;u&gt;'''''Generating''' ideas or plans''&lt;/u&gt;
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 1&lt;/u&gt;''' – Planning tasks''
** E.g. Generating plans
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 2&lt;/u&gt;''' – Creativity tasks''
** E.g. Generating ideas
2. ''&lt;u&gt;'''Choosing''' a solution&lt;/u&gt;''
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 3&lt;/u&gt;''' – Intellective tasks''
** E.g. Solving problems with correct answers
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 4&lt;/u&gt;''' – Decision-making tasks''
** E.g. Deciding issues with no right answer
3. ''&lt;u&gt;'''Negotiating''' a solution to a conflict&lt;/u&gt;'' 
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 5&lt;/u&gt;''' – Cognitive conflict tasks''
** E.g. Resolving conflicts of viewpoints 
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 6&lt;/u&gt;''' – Mixed-motive tasks''
** E.g. Resolving conflicts of interest 
4. ''&lt;u&gt;'''Executing''' a task&lt;/u&gt;'' 
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 7&lt;/u&gt;''' – Contests/battles/competitive tasks''
** E.g. Resolving conflicts of power 
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 8&lt;/u&gt;''' – Performance/psychomotor tasks''
** E.g. Executing performance tasks

=== Details ===
According to [[Joseph E. McGrath|McGrath]] and [[Kravitz]] (1982),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the four most commonly represented tasks in the group dynamics literature are intellective tasks, decision-making tasks, cognitive conflict tasks and mixed-motive tasks.

The circumplex model of group tasks takes the organization of goal-related activities a step further by distinguishing between tasks that involve cooperation between group members, cooperation tasks (Types 1, 2, 3 and 8) and tasks that often lead to conflict between group members, conflict tasks (Types 4, 5, 6 and 7).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, McGrath's circumplex model of group tasks also distinguishes between tasks that require action (behavioural tasks) and tasks that require conceptual review (conceptual tasks). 'Behavioural tasks' include Types 1, 6, 7 and 8, while 'conceptual tasks' include Types 2, 3, 4 and 5.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Visual representation ==
The circumplex model of group tasks is, evidently, a very detailed and complex model. To allow for a more thorough understanding of its properties, a visual representation of the model has been developed. (Need a diagram of the model)

== Further explanation ==
Since the circumplex model of group tasks is quite detailed and complex, numerous social psychological researchers have attempted to describe the model in various ways to ensure readers obtain an optimal understanding of the model. For instance, according to Stratus and McGrath (1994),&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the four quadrants and the various task types with which they contain all relate to one another within a two-dimensional space. More specifically, [[Susan G. Stratus|Stratus]] and [[Joseph E. McGrath|McGrath]] (1994)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; states that the horizontal dimension of the circumplex model of group tasks visual representation reflect the extent to which a task entails cognitive versus behavioural performance requirements. Likewise, the vertical dimension of the circumplex model of group tasks visual representation reflects the extent and form of interdependence among members.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''''Utne Reader''''' (also known as '''''Utne''''') is a quarterly American magazine that collects and reprints articles on politics, culture, and the environment, generally from [[alternative media]] sources including journals, newsletters, weeklies, [[zine]]s, music, and [[DVD]]s.

The magazine's writers and editors contribute book, film, and music reviews and original articles that tend to focus on emerging [[cultural trend]]s. The magazine's website produces ten blogs covering politics, environment, media, spirituality, science and technology, great writing, and the arts.  The publication takes its name from founder Eric Utne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20118662,00.html |title=Eric Utne Created the Impossible: a Reader's Digest That Both Baby Boomers and Highbrows Can Love|publisher=people.com |date=September 10, 1990 |access-date=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Utne" rhymes with the English word "chutney" and is Norwegian for "far out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/23/crosswords/what-the-heck-is-that-utne.html|title=What the Heck Is That?: UTNE |last=Amien|first=Deb|date=April 23, 2018|website=www.nytimes.com|publisher=New York Times|access-date=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The magazine was founded in 1984&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 20 Best Magazines of the Decade (2000-2009)|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2009/11/the-20-best-magazines-of-the-decade.html|work=Paste Magazine|access-date=August 10, 2015|date=November 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Eric Utne as the ''Utne Reader''. Eric Utne chaired the magazine until the late 1990s when his then-wife Nina Rothschild Utne took over.&lt;ref name="Groening"&gt;{{cite news|author=Tom Groening|title=Utne CEO, editor recounts magazine struggles|url=http://archive.bangordailynews.com/2006/09/16/former-utne-magazine-owner-recounts-publications-struggles/|work=[[Bangor Daily News]]|date=September 16, 2006|access-date=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was headquartered in [[Minneapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top General Magazines|url=http://www.bookmarket.com/magazines.htm|work=Book Market|access-date=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cover logo was changed to simply ''Utne'' in 2003, continuing until 2006, with the subtitle, ''A Different Read on Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.magazine-agent.com-sub.info/utne/covers?c=1&amp;cov=COVER0018375.JPG&amp;pg=1 |title=Magazine Agent: ''Utne'' |access-date=2008-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721192843/http://www.magazine-agent.com-sub.info/utne/covers?c=1&amp;cov=COVER0018375.JPG&amp;pg=1 |archive-date=2011-07-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the magazine was purchased by [[Ogden Publications]], publishers of ''[[Grit (newspaper)|Grit]]'', ''[[Mother Earth News]]'', ''[[Natural Home]]'', and other magazines.&lt;ref name="Groening"/&gt; The earlier title ''Utne Reader'' was brought back, and the magazine refocused on its original mission to reprint "the best of the alternative press".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minnesotamonitor.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=1188 |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 6, 2007 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927033113/http://www.minnesotamonitor.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=1188 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''Utne Reader'' was a leader of the [[Salon (gathering)|salon movement]] of the 1980s, devoted to debate on the issues of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE2DB1038F930A25757C0A964958260|title=An Attempted Comeback for the Literary Salon|author=Jonathan Rabinovitz|work=The New York Times|date=April 13, 1992|access-date=March 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Utne Reader'' was an early source of coverage of the [[mythopoetic men's movement]] when it first surfaced in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utne.com/web_special/web_specials_archives/articles/648-1.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 8, 2007 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515093241/http://www.utne.com/web_special/web_specials_archives/articles/648-1.html |archivedate=May 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Utne Independent Press Awards==
Every year, the magazine gives out its Utne Independent Press Awards, which honor alternative and independent magazines from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utne.com/uipa/ Utne Independent Press Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; Past winners include the ''[[Wilson Quarterly]]'', ''[[In These Times]]'', ''[[Virginia Quarterly Review]]'', ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'', ''[[Orion (magazine)|Orion]]'', ''[[High Country News]]'', ''[[Gnosis (magazine)|Gnosis]]'' and ''[[New Internationalist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utne.com/utne-independent-press-awards-winners-2010.aspx Winners of the 2010 Utne Independent Press Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[King-Size Homer]]", Lisa Simpson receives a letter for a subscription to the ''Utne Reader''. A later episode, "[[Dad Behavior]]", again references Lisa's collection of the magazines.

In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[The Son Also Draws]]", Brian Griffin is seen reading the magazine.

In the webcomic ''[[Narbonic]]'', in one of the first few strips in the series, the lab's intern is shown reading the magazine. Later in the comic series, another character makes a reference to the magazine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15793">A '''vanity press''', '''vanity publisher''', or '''subsidy publisher''' is a [[publishing house]] in which authors pay to have their books published.&lt;ref name="Glatthorn"&gt;{{cite book|last=Glatthorn|first=Alan A.|title=Publish or Perish - The Educator's Imperative: Strategies for Writing Effectively for Your Profession and Your School|date=June 15, 2002|publisher=Corwin Press|isbn= 9780761978671|page=84|chapter=9. Publishing (Vanity Press)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vanity publishers have no selection criteria as opposed to other "hybrid" publishing models.{{clarify|date=October 2017}} The term has appeared in mainstream U.S. publications as early as 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,932017,00.html|title=Books: Literary Rotolactor|date=22 December 1941|work=TIME.com|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, mainstream publishers, whether major companies or [[small press]]es, derive their profit from sales of the book to the general public. Publishers must therefore be cautious and deliberate in choosing to publish works that will sell, particularly as they must recoup their investment in the book (such as  an [[advance payment]] and [[royalties]] to the author, [[Editing|editorial]] guidance, [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]], [[marketing]], or [[advertising]]).{{original research inline|date=March 2014}} In order to sell books, commercial publishers may also be selective in order to cultivate a reputation for high-quality work, or to specialize in a particular [[genre]].

Because vanity presses are not usually selective (at least in the same way a commercial publisher would be) publication by a vanity press is typically not seen as conferring the same recognition or prestige as commercial publication.&lt;ref name="sfwa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfwa.org/other-resources/for-authors/writer-beware/vanity/|title=VANITY/SUBSIDY PUBLISHERS - SFWA|work=SFWA|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vanity presses do offer more independence for the author than does the mainstream publishing industry; however, their fees can be higher than the fees normally charged for similar printing services, and sometimes restrictive contracts are required.

While a commercial publisher's intended market is the general public, a vanity publisher's intended market is the author and a very small number of interested members of the general public. In some cases, authors of a book that is vanity published will buy a substantial number of copies of their book, so that they can give it away as a promotional tool.

==Differences from mainstream and self-publishers==
The term "vanity press" is considered pejorative, implying that an author who uses such a service is publishing out of [[vanity]] and that his or her work would otherwise not be commercially successful. A vanity press may assert control over rights to the published work and provide limited or no editing, cover art, or marketing services in exchange for their fee.&lt;ref name="sfwa"/&gt; Vanity presses may engage in deceptive practices or costly services with limited recourse available to the writer.  In the US, these practices may be cited by the [[Better Business Bureau]] as unfavorable reports by consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/greater-maryland/business-reviews/publishers-book/america-star-books-in-frederick-md-32010985|title=America Star Books, LLLP|publisher=|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the traditional publishing model, the publisher assumes the risk of publication and production costs, selects the works to be published, edits the author's text, and provides for [[marketing]] and [[Distribution (business)|distribution]], provides the [[ISBN]], and satisfies whatever [[legal deposit]] and [[copyright registration]] [[copyright formalities|formalities]] are required.  Such a publisher normally pays the author a fee, called an [[advance against royalties|advance]], for the right to publish the author's work; and further payments, called [[royalties]], based on the sales of the work. This led to [[James D. Macdonald]]'s famous dictum, "''Money should always flow toward the author''"&lt;ref name="CB1"&gt;{{cite web| last= Lundin|first=Leigh |title=Crossfire of the Vanities |url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=6990 |work=Self-Publishing |publisher=Criminal Brief |location=New York |date=2009-05-03 |quote=Vanity publishing is like T-ball: Everyone gets a chance at bat, gets a hit, and takes home a trophy. But don’t expect anyone other than your mom to applaud.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes called [[Yog's Law]]).

In a variant of Yog's law for self-publishing, author John Scalzi has proposed this alternate, to distinguish [[self-publishing]] from vanity publishing, "While in the process of self-publishing, money and rights are controlled by the writer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatever.scalzi.com/2014/06/20/yogs-law-and-self-publishing/|title=Yog’s Law and Self-Publishing – Whatever|publisher=|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-publishing is distinguished from vanity publishing by the writer maintaining control of copyright as well as the editorial and publishing process, including marketing and distribution.

The distinction becomes more complicated, however, in that traditional publishers nowadays{{When|date=January 2018}} expect their writers to do most of the marketing, and publishers are providing less and less editorial input.{{Cn|date=January 2018}} Traditional publishers do, however, take the majority of income from book sales, offering low royalty rates to their writers of around 7-8% on paperbacks, and 25% of net receipts on ebooks.{{Cn|date=January 2018}}

==Business model==
With vanity publishing, authors pay to have their books published. Because the author is paying to have the book published, the book doesn't go through an approval or editorial process as it would in a traditional setting where the publisher takes a financial risk on the author's ability to write successfully. Editing and formatting services may or may not be offered and they may come with the initial publishing fee (or, more correctly, printing fee) or might be offered at an additional cost.

[[Self-publishing|Self-publishers]] undertake the functions of a publisher for their own books. Some "self-publishers" write, edit, design, lay out, market, and promote their books themselves, relying on a [[Printer (publisher)|printer]] only for actual printing and [[bookbinding|binding]]. Others write the manuscript themselves but hire freelance professionals to provide editing and production services.

More recently, companies have offered their services to act as a sort of agent between the writer and a small printing operation.

A slightly more sophisticated model of a vanity press is described by [[Umberto Eco]] in ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]''. The company that provides initial setting for the novel operates a small yet respectable arts and humanities publishing house as a front. It does not make a profit but it brings a steady flow of substandard authors. They are politely rejected and then referred to ''another'' publishing firm in the same office—the vanity press that will print anything for money. This was surprisingly similar to the business model adopted by [[Harlequin Horizons]].&lt;ref name="WB1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Strauss|first=Victoria |title=Harlequin Horizons: Another Major Publisher Adds A Self-Publishing Division |url=http://accrispin.blogspot.com/2009/11/harlequin-horizons-another-major.html |work=Publishing Pitfalls |publisher=Writer Beware |date=2009-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some companies make use of [[print on demand]] technologies based on modern digital printing. These companies are often able to offer their services with little or no upfront cost to the author, but they are still considered vanity presses by writers' advocates. Vanity presses earn their money not from sales of books to readers, as other publishers do, but from sales and services to the books' authors. The author receives the shipment of his or her books and may attempt to resell them through whatever channels are available.&lt;ref name="CB1" /&gt;

==Publishing variations==
Writers considering [[self-publishing]] often also consider directly hiring a [[printer (publisher)|printer]]. According to self-publisher and [[poet]] [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], vanity presses charge higher premiums and create a risk that an author who has published with a vanity press will have more difficulty working with a respectable publisher in the future.

Some vanity presses using [[print on demand]] technology act as printers as well as sellers of support services for authors interested in self-publishing. Reputable firms of this type are typically marked by clear contract terms, lack of excessive fees, retail prices comparable to those from commercial printers, lack of pressure to purchase "extra" services, contracts that do not claim exclusive rights to the work being published (though one would be hard pressed to find a legitimate publisher willing to put out a competing edition, making nonexclusivity meaningless),{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} and honest indications of what services they will and won't provide, and what results the author may reasonably expect. However, the distinction between the worst of these firms and vanity presses is essentially trivial, though a source of great confusion as the low fees have attracted tens of thousands of authors who want to avoid the stigma of vanity publishing while doing just that.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

==Vanity publishing in other media==
The vanity press model has been extended to other media. Some companies produce videos, music, and other works with less perceived commercial potential in exchange for a fee from the creators of those works. In some cases, the company may contribute original content to the works (e.g., supplying lyrics for a melody).  A notable example is [[ARK Music Factory]], which produced and released [[Rebecca Black]]'s 2011 [[viral video]] "[[Friday (Rebecca Black song)|Friday]]".&lt;ref name="Hundley"&gt;{{cite news | first = Jessica | last = Hundley | title = Patrice Wilson of Ark Music: 'Friday' is on his mind | date = 2011-03-30 | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/03/patrice-wilson-of-ark-music-friday-is-on-his-mind.html | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate = 2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These variants on the vanity press theme are still much less common than the traditional, book-based vanity press.

Vanity academic journals also exist, often called bogus journals, which will publish with little or no editorial oversight (although they may claim to be [[peer reviewed]]).  For example, one such bogus journal (''International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology'') accepted for publication a paper called ''Get me off Your Fucking Mailing List''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|url=http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~dm/home/papers/remove.pdf|title=Get me off Your Fucking Mailing List|author=David Mazieres and Eddie Kohler|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, apart from a couple of headings and references, consists of the sentence "Get me off your fucking mailing list." repeated many times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/11/20/bogus-journal-accepts-profanity-laced-anti-spam-paper/|title=Bogus Journal Accepts Profanity-Laced Anti-Spam Paper|work=Scholarly Open Access|accessdate=22 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141122164005/http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/11/20/bogus-journal-accepts-profanity-laced-anti-spam-paper/|archivedate=22 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries it was common for authors, if they could afford it, to pay the costs of publishing their books. Such writers could expect more control of their work, greater profits, or both. Among such authors were [[Lewis Carroll]], who paid the expenses of publishing ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and most of his subsequent work. [[Mark Twain]], [[E. Lynn Harris]], [[Zane Grey]], [[Upton Sinclair]], [[Carl Sandburg]], [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Walt Whitman]] and [[Anaïs Nin]] also self-published some or all of their works.  Not all of these well-known authors were successful in their ventures; Mark Twain's publishing business, for example, went bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|

[[Ernest Vincent Wright]], author of the 1939 novel ''[[Gadsby (novel)|Gadsby]]'', famous for being written entirely in [[lipogram]], was unable to find a publisher for his unusual work and ultimately chose to publish it through a vanity press.

'''Wahidi Balhaf''' ({{Lang-ar|واحدي بالحاف}} ''{{transl|ar|Wāḥidī Bālḥāf}}''), or the '''Wahidi Sultanate of Balhaf in Hadhramaut''' ({{lang-ar|سلطنة الواحدي الحضرمية في بالحاف }}''{{transl|ar|Salṭanat al-Wāḥidī Bālḥāf AlḤaḍramiyah}}''), was one of several Wahidi states in the [[British Empire|British]] [[Aden Protectorate]]. It was previously part of the [[Federation of Arab Emirates of the South]], and then of its successor, the [[Federation of South Arabia]] when it was known simply as Wahidi.

Its capital was [[Balhaf]] on the [[Gulf of Aden]] coast and it included the inland town of [[Azzan]] (formerly the seat of a separate [[Wahidi Azzan|Wahidi Sultanate of Azzan]]). The Sultanate was abolished in 1967 upon the founding of the [[People's Republic of South Yemen]] and is now part of the Republic of [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Dresch. ''A History of Modern Yemen.'' Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The predecessor state, the Wahidi Sultanate (Saltanat al-Wahidiyya), was established at an uncertain date.
In 1830 the Wahidi Sultanate split into four states: 
* Wahidi Sultanate of Ba´l Haf (Saltanat Ba al-Haf al-Wahidiyya) 
* Wahidi Sultanate of `Azzan (Saltanat `Azzan al-Wahidiyya) 
* [[Wahidi Bir Ali|Wahidi Sultanate of Bi´r `Ali `Amaqin]]  (Saltanat Bi'r `Ali `Amaquin al-Wahidiyya) 
* [[Wahidi Haban|Wahidi Sultanate of Habban]] (Saltanat Habban al-Wahidiyya) 
On 4 May 1881 Ba´l Haf and `Azzan joined. In 1888 the Wahidi Sultanate of Ba´l Haf and `Azzan became a [[British protectorate]]. 
In 1895 Bi´r `Ali `Amaqin also came under British protection. On 23 Oct 1962 the joint sultanate was renamed Wahidi Sultanate (al-Saltana al-Wahidiyya), while Bi´r `Ali and Habban remained subordinate sultanates. 
On 29 Nov 1967 with the independence of the People's Republic of South Yemen all states were abolished.

'''William''' ('''Bill''') '''G. Doerner''' (born 1949) is a professor in the College of [[Criminology]] and [[Criminal Justice]] at [[Florida State University]].  His research has covered topics such as criminal justice, [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquency]], law enforcement, [[police]] management and procedures, and [[victimology]].

==Biography==
Doerner was born in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]].  He graduated from [[Fairfield University]] (in [[Fairfield, Connecticut]]) with a B.A. in Sociology in 1971.  Continuing directly into graduate studies, he received his M.A. from [[Emory University]] (in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]) two years later and his Ph.D. in [[Sociology]] from the [[University of Tennessee]] (in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]) in 1977.  While working on his dissertation, he taught and conducted research at [[Marquette University]] (in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]).  Upon completion of his doctoral studies, he accepted a position in the College of Criminology &amp; Criminal Justice at [[Florida State University]] where he currently teaches courses to undergraduate and graduate students.

Several years after beginning as an assistant professorship, a neighbor invited him to ride along with county sheriff deputies.  In 1980, he began working as a part-time reserve officer with the [[Tallahassee Police Department]].  Besides serving as a one-person patrol unit, he lectured at the state established Pat Thomas Law Enforcement Academy, evaluated police training programs, and provided in-service training to dispatchers and veteran officers.  In the 1990s, he conducted a police training seminar for the National Police Academy in Costa Rica that was sponsored by the [[Universidad de Costa Rica]] and the Florida/Costa Rica ([http://mailer.fsu.edu/~egerato/florica.html FLORICA]) Linkage Institute.  Doerner retired from policing in 2010.

Throughout his academic career, Doerner has drawn on his practical experiences in law enforcement to write several textbooks and over sixty journal articles, book chapters, reviews, and monographs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criminology.fsu.edu/p/vitae/Doerner.pdf Bill Doerner's CV]&lt;/ref&gt;  He has served as editor for the [https://www.springer.com/social+sciences/criminology/journal/12103 American Journal of Criminal Justice] and on the board of directors for the [http://www.scja.net/ Southern Criminal Justice Association].  In 2009, he was recognized for "significant contributions to the field of victimology and victim services" by the American Society of Victimology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.american-society-victimology.us/dussich_award/ John P. J. Dussich Award]&lt;/ref&gt;
