The  '''1952 raid on Beit Jala''' was an [[Israel]]i attack on [[Beit Jala]], a [[Palestinian Christian]] town on the border between [[Jordan]] and Israel (today part of the [[Palestinian territories]]) on January 6, 1952. Based on leaflets dropped at the site it was presumed to be revenge for the rape and murder of a Jewish girl, which was believed to have been committed by infiltrators from Beit Jala.&lt;ref name = "morris61"/&gt;

==Background==
In 1949–1953, there were 99 complaints made by Israel about the infiltration of armed groups or individuals and 30 complaints of armed Jordanian units crossing into Israeli territory.  Jordan complained of 5 armed groups or individuals infiltrating and 162 of armed Israeli units crossing into Jordanian territory.&lt;ref name="UN630"&gt;[http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/017eefb458011c9d05256722005e5499!OpenDocument UN DOC S/PV 630 of 27 October 1953] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209192923/http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/017eefb458011c9d05256722005e5499%21OpenDocument |date=9 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="morris61"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YUthqHRF-m8C&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=bayit+vegan+border&amp;source=web&amp;ots=mAZ9dkmNCv&amp;sig=jbCr1SB8Odgv4W8OuQP6BN9OfXk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result|title=Israel's Border Wars, 1949–1956: Arab Infiltration, Israeli Retaliation, and the Countdown to the Suez War|last=Morris|first=Benny|authorlink=Benny Morris|accessdate=2008-06-22|isbn=0-19-829262-7|pages=61|year=1997|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such gang was led by Muhammad Mansi and Jamil Muhammad Mujarrab, who had raped and murdered a Jewish girl in Jerusalem's [[Katamon]] neighborhood in February 1951.&lt;ref name = "morris61"/&gt; Mansi was detained by the Jordanians but released and placed on surveillance.&lt;ref name = "morris61"/&gt; The Israeli authorities passed on information that he was stockpiling explosives.&lt;ref name = "morris61"/&gt;

On December 4, 1951, a Jewish girl who was walking home from the bus stop in the  [[Bayit VeGan]] neighborhood of [[Jerusalem]], Leah Feistinger, was raped and murdered and mutilated by Mansi Gang.&lt;ref name = "morris61"/&gt; Her body was found hidden in a cave about a mile from the Jordan/Israel [[Green Line (Israel)|cease fire line]] inside Israeli territory.&lt;ref name="morris217"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YUthqHRF-m8C&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=morris+beit+jala+1952&amp;ei=L7leSIjLI6bQigG90fSLDA&amp;sig=umH6BJl5BlLyz07vUFaYtSm726U|title=Israel's Border Wars, 1949–1956: Arab Infiltration, Israeli Retaliation, and the Countdown to the Suez War|last=Morris|first=Benny|authorlink=Benny Morris|accessdate=2008-06-22|isbn=0-19-829262-7|pages=215–18|year=1997|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major Loreaux, an investigating officer from the [[Mixed Armistice Commissions]] (MAC), the [[United Nations|UN]] organization responsible for monitoring violations of the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]], reported to MAC chairman Commander E. H. Hutchison and Commandant G. Bouvet that the girl had been raped and murdered, and her face mutilated. Loreaux reported that he saw no evidence of Jordanian infiltration and suggested that the  Israeli police investigate the murder.&lt;ref name="EHH"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hutchison, E.

Israel stated that the perpetrators were Said Salah Jam'an, Jamil Muhammad Mujarrab and Muhammad Mansi, three residents of Beit Jala.&lt;ref name="morris217" /&gt;

==Reprisal raid==
On January 6, 1952, three houses in [[Beit Jala]] were rigged with explosives and blown up. According to  Hutchison, the upper floor of the first house was completely destroyed. The lower part of the house, which had been built into the side of the hill, was still partially intact, with bullet holes visible in the walls and doors. The inhabitants, a twenty-three-year-old man and his wife, were killed in the blast. Only one wall was damaged in the second house. The windows were shattered and the walls were pockmarked with bullets. A mother and her four children, ranging in age from 6 to 14, were found dead in the third house. When one of the demolition charges failed the attackers used grenades.&lt;ref name="EHH" /&gt;

The perpetrators left leaflets in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] at the site which read as follows:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
{{cquote|On 4/12/1951 some persons from among the inhabitants of Beit Jala killed a Jewish girl in the neighbourhood of Bayit VeGan, after committing against her an unpardonable crime.

{{col-end}}

==Investigation ==
Major Hutchison investigated the Jordanian complaint of a violation of the [[1949 Armistice Agreements|General Armistice agreement]] at Beit Jala on behalf of the [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation]] (UNTSO).&lt;ref name="EHH" /&gt; Israel denied her involvement and J.E. Chadwick, a diplomat at the British Embassy in [[Tel Aviv]], thought it had been the work of Israeli [[vigilantes]]. Hutchison reported that the demolition charges had Israeli markings and machine-guns were used&lt;ref name="EHH" /&gt; [[Benny Morris]] concludes that the raid was carried out by an IDF platoon and that Western diplomats were not convinced that the Feistinger rape-murder had been carried out by infiltrators. In April 1953 the US consul general in Jerusalem wrote: "It was never shown that the act was not committed by her Israeli boy-friend".&lt;ref name="morris217" /&gt;

==Reactions==
The United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation issued a condemnation to Israel for the "serious breach of the [[1949 Armistice Agreements|General Armistice Agreement]]" in the Beit Jala reprisal raid.&lt;ref name="EHH"/&gt;
Israel denied IDF involvement in the raid, and abstained from voting while Jordan and the MAC chairman condemned Israel.&lt;ref name="morris217" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EHH" /&gt;
The chief of the [[Arab Legion]], [[John Bagot Glubb]], stated that the Israelis had a psychological need to bully their weaker neighbors&lt;ref name="morris217" /&gt;
The British Embassy in Tel Aviv called the raids "simple reprisals, designed to make Arab infiltration unpopular in the Arab villages". The ambassador compared Israeli/IDF raids with British reprisals against [[Egypt]]ians in the [[Suez Canal]] area.&lt;ref name="morris217" /&gt;

* The [[Crypt of Civilization]], a [[time capsule]] located at [[Oglethorpe University]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], is scheduled to be unsealed on May 28, 8113.

==Astronomical events==
All these dates are in a uniform time scale such as [[Terrestrial Time]]. When converted to our ordinary solar time or [[Universal Time]], which is decidedly non-uniform, via [[ΔT]], the dates would be about one day earlier. Because of this difference, these dates have no anniversary relation to historical dates and should not be linked to them. Furthermore, they are only astronomical dates, so they are given in the astronomical format of Year Month Day, which allows them to be ordered.

[[File:Utdrag ur Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum.jpg|thumb|A [[facsimile]] of Adam of Bremen's [[magnum opus]].]]
'''Adam of Bremen''' ({{lang-la|Adamus Bremensis}}; {{lang-de|Adam von Bremen}}) (Before 1050 – 12 October 1081/1085) was a [[Germany|German]] [[medieval]] [[chronicler]]. He lived and worked in the second half of the eleventh century. Adamus is most famous for his chronicle ''[[Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum|Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum]]'' (''Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church'').

Little is known of his life other than hints from his own chronicles. He is believed to have come from [[Meissen]] ([[Latin]] ''Misnia'') in [[Saxony]].&lt;ref name=gilman&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilman, ed.|first=Daniels|title=The New International Encyclopedia|year=1905|publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Co.|location=New York|pages=101|url=https://archive.org/stream/newinternational01gilm#page/101/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dates of his birth and death are uncertain, but he was probably born before 1050 and died on 12 October of an unknown year (possibly 1081, at the latest 1085). From his chronicles it is apparent that he was familiar with a number of authors. The honorary name of ''Magister Adam'' shows that he had passed through all the stages of a higher education. It is probable that he was taught at the ''[[Magdeburg]]er Domschule''.

In 1066 or 1067 he was invited by archbishop [[Adalbert of Hamburg]] to join the [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Church of Bremen]].&lt;ref name=remy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01132c.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Adam of Bremen|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam was accepted among the capitulars of Bremen, and by 1069 he appeared as director of the cathedral's school.&lt;ref name=remy/&gt; Soon thereafter he began to write the history of [[Bremen]]/[[Hamburg]] and of the northern lands in his ''Gesta''.

His position and the missionary activity of the church of Bremen allowed him to gather information on the history and the geography of [[Northern Germany]]. A stay at the court of [[Sweyn II of Denmark|Svend Estridsen]] gave him the opportunity to find information about the history and geography of Denmark and the other Scandinavian countries.&lt;ref name=remy/&gt; Among other things he wrote about in Scandinavia, includes the sailing passages across [[Øresund]] such as today's [[HH Ferry route|Elsinore to Helsingborg route]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsingorleksikon.dk/index.php/Helsing%C3%B8r-Helsingborg_overfarten|title=Helsingør-Helsingborg overfarten - Helsingør Leksikon|author=|date=|website=www.helsingorleksikon.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2610">'''Alfons Dopsch''' (14 June 1868 in [[Lovosice|Lobositz]], [[Bohemia]] - 1 September 1953 in [[Vienna]]) was an Austrian social and economic historian who specialised in the history of [[medieval Europe]]. He studied at Institut fur Osterreichische Geschichtsforschung and was a Professor at the [[University of Vienna]], 1898-1936.
[[File:Dopsch - Naturalwirtschaft und Geldwirtschaft in der Weltgeschichte, 1949 - 5736852.tif|thumb|Italian edition of ''Naturalwirtschaft und Geldwirtschaft in der Weltgeschichte'', 1949]]

Dopsch, using archaeological evidence, rejected the highly defined [[periodization]] of other scholars in favour of an emphasis on long term continuity and gradual change. He argued that the collapse of the [[Roman Empire]] in Western Europe was not as catastrophic as had previously been thought and that the [[Middle Ages]] had evolved in an orderly way as the Germans absorbed and developed [[Roman culture]]. Some of his views have since been rejected by modern scholars but his work continues to represent an important perspective on the debate about the effects of the collapse of the empire on Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBqWbDmFsfEC&amp;lpg=PA319&amp;ots=qBRPbJAjcZ&amp;dq=Alfons%20Dopsch&amp;pg=PA319#v=onepage&amp;q=Alfons%20Dopsch&amp;f=true Dopsch, Alfons.] by Robert F.

==Context==

The [[Natural history|naturalist]], explorer, geographer, anthropologist and biologist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] (born 8 January 1823) died on 7 November 1913. He is principally remembered now for having independently conceived the theory of [[evolution]] through [[natural selection]], which prompted [[Charles Darwin]] to publish ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. Some of his books such as ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]'' remain in print; it is considered one of the best accounts of scientific exploration published during the 19th century. Wallace is also remembered for recognizing the presence of a [[biogeography|biogeographical]] boundary, now known as the [[Wallace Line]], that divides the [[Indonesia]]n archipelago into two distinct parts: a [[Indomalaya ecozone|western portion]] in which the animals are almost entirely of Asian origin, and an [[Wallacea|eastern portion]] where the fauna reflect the influence of [[Australasia]].&lt;ref name=Kewmag/&gt;

'''Andrew Berman''' is an architectural and cultural heritage preservationist in New York City. He is known for being an advocate of affordable housing and LGBT rights. Berman was named executive director of the [[Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation]] (GVSHP),  neighborhood preservation organization in [[New York City]], in 2002.

Andrew Berman has served on the boards of the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, Housing Conservation Coordinators, the Chelsea Reform Democratic Club, the Hell’s Kitchen Neighborhood Association, and was a founding member of the West Side Neighborhood Alliance and Friends of Pier 84. He is a member of the Board of Advisers of the [[Historic Districts Council]]. Berman was also a plaintiff in the lawsuit to remove private helicopter service from the Hudson River Park.

Since 2002, GVSHP, under Berman's leadership, has secured landmark and zoning protections in the [[South Village]], the Meatpacking District, along the [[Greenwich Village]] waterfront, and in the East Village. The organization also led campaigns against development plans by [[Donald Trump]] and [[New York University]].&lt;ref name=Panisch&gt;{{cite web|last1=Panisch|first1=Joelle|title=A Chat With Andrew Berman|url=http://www.sohojournal.com/content/chat-andrew-berman|publisher=Soho Journal|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berman has also focused on preserving the history of typically underrepresented groups (e.g., migrants and the working class) and previously overlooked sites and structures (e.g., tenement architecture).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sheftell|first1=Jason|title=Protest proud: South Village landmark movement gets a push from top historic group|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/real-estate/protest-proud-south-village-landmark-movement-push-top-historic-group-article-1.334643|publisher=NY Daily News|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Berman was born and raised in the Bronx, New York, where he graduated from the Bronx High School of Science. He holds a BA in Art History from [[Wesleyan University]], and lives and works on the West Side, Lower Manhattan.

Berman worked for New York City Councilmember [[Thomas Duane]] from 1993 to 1999, then for Duane as state senator until 2001. Under Duane, he focused on areas of education, transportation infrastructure, the environment, and senior services in Greenwich Village, [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]], and [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell’s Kitchen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andrew Berman biography|url=http://www.gvshp.org/_gvshp/about/andrew-berman-bio.htm|publisher=Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation projects and advocacy==
Under Berman's leadership, GVSHP has worked with other community groups to secure official landmark protections for around 1,100 buildings in Greenwich Village, the East Village, and NoHo, including 10 new historic districts or historic district extensions, and at least 40 individual landmarks. During his tenure, GVSHP also helped secure community-initiated contextual rezonings and downzonings of nearly 100 blocks of the East and West Village, designed to prevent new development, limit hotel and dormitory construction, preserve existing building stock, and retain and create affordable housing.&lt;ref name="ten years"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ten Years: A Thousand Buildings: One Hundred Blocks|url=http://www.gvshp.org/_gvshp/victories/doc/ten-years.pdf|publisher=Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Timeline'''
* 2003: Designation of the Gansevoort Market Historic District in the [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan|Meatpacking District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wadler|first1=Joyce|title=Public Lives; Even Clamor and Stink Can't Repel the Chic Hordes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/19/nyregion/public-lives-even-clamor-and-stink-can-t-repel-the-chic-hordes.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* 2006: Designation of the Far West Village Extension of the [[Greenwich Village|Greenwich Village Historic District]], the first extension of that district since its designation in 1969.
* 2013: Designation of the South Village Historic District, a 250-building district covering more than a dozen blocks south of Washington Square.
* 2012: Designation of the [[East 10th Street Historic District]], the first new historic district in the East Village since 1969. 
* [[East Village/Lower East Side Historic District]], the first large-scale historic district in the East Village.&lt;ref name="ten years"/&gt;

Other preservation efforts Berman has led include:
* Efforts to landmark Mezritch Synagogue, the last remaining operating tenement synagogue in the East Village.
* [[Webster Hall]], a former hall-for-hire used for labor rallies, drag balls and later as a recording studio and music venue.
* [[Westbeth Artists Community|Westbeth]], a former industrial complex converted into the nation’s first subsidized artists’ housing complex.
* University Village’s [[University Village (Manhattan)|Silver Towers]], a trio of concrete brutalist high-rise towers designed by [[I.M. Pei]] surrounding a [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] sculpture which included affordable housing for displaced Lower Manhattan residents of limited income
* 128 East 13th Street, New York’s last surviving horse auction mart which later served as a women’s assembly line training institute during World War II and from 1979 to 2006 was the studio of the artist [[Frank Stella]].
* Tenement at 101 Avenue A, a German social hall and labor organizing center, was later home to [[Warhol Superstars|Warhol Superstar]] and [[Velvet Underground]] member [[Nico]], and beginning in 1979 was the home of the [[Pyramid Club (New York)|Pyramid Club]], considered one of the most influential performance venues of the downtown scene and the birthplace of politically conscious drag performance art. Due to the insistence of Berman and other advocates, the 2012 East Village/LES Historic District was expanded to include it.&lt;ref name="ten years"/&gt;
* Tunnel Garage preservation advocacy. One of New York’s earliest Art Deco structures and earliest purpose-built parking garages, noted for its polychrome terra cotta medallion showing a Model-T Ford emerging from the nearby, not-yet-built Holland Tunnel, the 1992 building was rejected for designation by the LPC and torn down in 2006. A luxury rental apartment building, 55 Thompson, now stands in its place.&lt;ref name=Panisch/&gt;

===LGBTQ===
Berman has focused on historical preservation of sites associated with the [[LGBT|Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender (LGBT)]] rights movement. Berman's engagement with the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] reflect his work to garner recognition of sites such as the [[Stonewall Inn]]; Julius’ Bar, and the Gay Activists Alliance Firehouse, for their historic significance.

Berman led a campaign for the landmark protection of a house at 186 Spring Street which had served as a home to figures in the post-Stonewall LGBT rights movement. A determination of eligibility for the house for the State and National Registers of Historic Places was made, upon which Berman publicly criticized the LPC for refusing to landmark the site and allowing it to be demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=186 Spring Street|url=http://www.gvshp.org/_gvshp/preservation/186_spring/186_spring-main.htm|publisher=Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, Berman, on behalf of GVSHP, along with [[PFLAG]] and the Church of the Village, unveiled a plaque marking the founding of PFLAG forty years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berman|first1=Andrew|title=Remembering Jeanne Manford and the Founding of PFLAG|url=http://gvshp.org/blog/2013/04/03/remembering-jeanne-manford-and-the-founding-of-pflag/|publisher=Off the Grid, GVSHP|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York University===
Andrew Berman's work has often included efforts to prevent the expansion of [[New York University]] within Greenwich Village, the East Village, NoHo, and satellite campuses. This includes his work with GVSHP to prevent NYU from building a planned 400-foot-tall tower on Bleecker Street, which would have been the tallest structure in Greenwich Village, Berman's participation in litigation blocking city approvals for NYU’s planned 20-year expansion plan.

GVSHP also advocated for the expansion of the South Village Historic District, as originally proposed by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, to include several NYU buildings, including the full-block Vanderbilt Hall Law School on Washington Square South – a building which, without the landmark protections which were granted it, could have been replaced under existing zoning by a 300-foot-tall dorm. 
 
Berman also reportedly criticized Donald Trump’s plans for a 454-foot-tall “condo-hotel” on Spring Street in the Hudson Square neighborhood adjacent to Greenwich Village, leading rallies and garnering support from civic groups throughout New York City in opposition to the plan, which was ultimately approved by New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trump "Condo-Hotel"|url=http://gvshp.org/trump.htm|publisher=Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8116">[[File:Antonio Beccadelli, Panormita.png|thumb|Antonio Beccadelli, Panormita]]
'''Antonio Beccadelli''' (1394–1471), called '''Il Panormita''' (poetic form meaning "The [[Palermo|Palermitan]]"), was an [[Italy|Italian]] poet, [[canon lawyer]], scholar, diplomat, and chronicler. He generally wrote in [[Latin language|Latin]].  Born at Palermo, he was the eldest son of the merchant Enrico di Vannino Beccadelli, who had played an active role in [[Sicily|Sicilian]] politics, serving as [[Praetor]] of Palermo in 1393.

He helped his father with his business until he became consumed with enthusiasm for [[Humanism|humanistic]] studies.
[[File:Antonii Panhormite in Alphonsi Regis Aragonum dicta ac facta.jpg|thumb|''Anthonii Panhormite, in Alphonsi Regis Aragonum dicta ac facta memoratum digna.'']]
==Travels==
Beccadelli traveled to numerous Italian cities, and became a student of [[Gasparino da Barizizza]] in [[Padua]]. In 1419 he had stayed for a short time in [[Florence]], and then he had travelled to [[Siena]] in order to study [[jurisprudence]]. He continued to [[Bologna]] and remained there until August 1427. He returned to Florence, and then left for [[Rome]], where he stayed until 1428.  In 1429, he journeyed to [[Genoa]].

He became a guest of [[Filippo Maria Visconti]] family at [[Pavia]] (1430–1433), where he completed his studies and entered the court of the Visconti.  He would dedicate himself to [[philological]] studies, in particular to the tradition of [[Plautus]].

==Beccadelli and King Alfonso==
[[Image:King-alfonsoVaragon2.jpg|frame|right|Manuscript detail of Alfonso V of Aragon]]

In 1434, he entered the service of [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] at [[Naples]].  Alfonso was a great patron of the arts, and in this city Beccadelli founded the academy ''Porticus Antoniana'', later known as the ''[[Accademia Pontaniana]]'', after [[Giovanni Pontano]]. At Naples, Beccadelli began a close friendship with Pontano, and introduced the young scholar to the royal chancery of King Alfonso.

Beccadelli and Alfonso shared a great love of culture, and Beccadelli accompanied Alfonso during the vicissitudes of the king's career. When Alfonso became a prisoner in the hands of Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, in 1435, Alfonso persuaded his ferocious and crafty captor to let him go by making it plain that it was the interest of Milan not to prevent the victory of the Aragonese party in Naples.  Beccadelli, with his former connection to the Milanese court, played a role in these negotiations.

Alfonso had been betrothed to [[María de Castilla]] (1401–1458; sister of [[Juan II of Castile]]) in [[Valladolid]] in 1408; the marriage was celebrated in [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] during 1415. They failed to produce children.  At Naples, Alfonso fell in love with a woman of noble family named [[Lucrezia d'Alagno]], who served as a ''de facto'' queen at the Neapolitan court as well as an inspiring [[muse]].  Beccadelli paid tribute to her with these [[Latin]] words: ''Quantum rex proceres, quantum Sol sȳdera vincit, / tantum Campānas superat Lucrētia nymphas''.&lt;ref&gt;"As much as the King surpasses the nobles, as much as the Sun conquers the stars, so Lucretia surpasses the brides of [[Campania]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

It is known that Beccadelli himself was married twice.

After Alfonso's death, Beccadelli remained close to the [[Crown of Aragon]], and served [[Ferdinand I of Naples]].  Alfonso had entrusted Beccadelli with the instruction of his son and successor.

Beccadelli died in January 1471 at Naples.

==''Hermaphroditus''==
Beccadelli is most famous for his bawdy masterpiece ''Hermaphroditus'' (1425), a collection of eighty-one [[Latin]] [[epigrams]], which evoke the unfettered [[eroticism]] of the works of [[Catullus]] and [[Martial]], as well as of the ''[[Priapea]]''.

This work was greeted with acclaim by scholars but subsequently condemned and censured as obscene by [[Christian]] apologists.

Amongst those who praised this work was [[Guarino da Verona]], who called Beccadelli a poetic scion of the Sicilian writer of antiquity, [[Theocritus]].

Beccadelli's critics included the theologian Antonio da Rho (1395–1447), a [[Franciscan]] from [[Milan]], who would write a ''Philippic against Antonio Panormita'' (1431/32).  Panormita had written invective poetry ridiculing Rho with obscene [[insults]], but he would have to defend not only his work but also his life and morals.  Rho discredited and vilified Beccadelli by making allegations about the poet's Sicilian background, [[orthodoxy]], and practice of [[taboo|sexual taboos]].

==Other works==
He also wrote the ''[[Gaul]]ish Epistles'' (''Epistulae gallicae'') (1474) and the ''[[Campania]]n Epistles'' (''Epistulae campanae'') (1474)

He compiled ''The Sayings and Deeds of King Alfonso'' (''De dictis et factis Alphonsi regis'').  He became a kind of [[panegyrist]] to Alfons V of Aragon, to whom the work refers.

He also wrote the chronicle ''Liber Rerum Gestarum Ferdinandi Regis'' (1438–1458).

The '''Battle of Margarana''' ({{lang-id|Puputan Margarana}}) was a battle fought between the [[Netherlands Indies Civil Administration]] (NICA) and the recently created, rebelling Ciung Wanara Battalion that occurred in [[Bali|Marga]], [[Indonesia]].

== Prelude ==
As World War II ended, the [[British Army during the Second World War|British Army]] landed in Bali, disarmed occupying [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese troops]], and returned to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]]. Some Dutch [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army|KNIL]] battalions under Gajah Merah, however, stayed in the city.
When Gajah Merah's Infantry landed, Ciung Wanara commander [[I Gusti Ngurah Rai]] went to [[Malang]] to discuss Bali's condition with the head of the Republic Indonesian Army ([[Indonesia language|Indonesian]]: ''Tentara Republik Indonesia''), who placed one [[Indonesian Navy|ALRI]] warship in Gilimanuk Harbour.

On 28 May 1946, I Gusti Ngurah Rai led the army's long march to East Bali. Skirmishing began at Tanah Aron on 9 July 1946, moving later to Penglipuran. The long march then resumed until they had arrived at [[Tabanan Regency|Tabanan]]. On 20 July 1946, the NICA Y-Brigade first landed at Benoa.

On 11 November 1946, the battalion and defected NICA head police officer Wagimin arrived at Dangin Carik, Tabanan, planning to disarm the regency's NICA Police by the night of 18 November. On that day, the combined 300 men of platoons Barisan Banteng and Anak Banteng arrived with weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Made |last=Sutaba |date=1983 |title=Sejarah Perlawanan Terhadap Imperialisme dan Kolonialisme di Daerah Bali|language=Bahasa Indonesia |url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=7zvtCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages=143–151 |location=Jakarta |publisher=Direktorat Jenderal Kebudayaan |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Battle ==
On 19 November, the Y-Brigade arrived at army posts in Perean, Baha, Kediri, Tabanan, Penebel, and Jatiluwih to reach Marga and block the Ciung Wanara battalion's movement. Rai knew about the plan and commanded the battalion to disband, with 95 men remaining with him to commit ''[[puputan]]'' in battle. These remaining troops moved to Banjar Kelaci, Marga.

On the morning of 20 November 1946, KNIL troops arrived before sunrise to block the remnant of Rai's troops as planned. The battle began at 8:00 AM. At first, KNIL troops thought the battalion's defense was too strong, so they fell back.

At 12:00 PM, the Dutch troops were helped by a bomber plane from Makassar, and resumed the attack after the bombing. The battle ended at 5:00 PM, with 400 Dutch soldiers and the entire remaining Ciung Wanara battalion (including Rai) killed in action. NICA was commanded to bring all of the corpses to the Marga Market, but only 86 corpses were taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Geoffrey |first=Robinson |date=1995 |title=The Dark Side of Paradise: Political Violence in Bali Front Cover |url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=m3Gfir3Ju70C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |page=149 |location=New York |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=9780801481727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Nyoman S. |last=Pendit |date=1979 |title=Bali Berjuang |language=Bahasa Indonesia |location=Jakarta |publisher=Gunung Agung |isbn=9789799954114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{web cite|url=https://amp.tirto.id//atasan-dan-bawahan-yang-saling-berhadapan-dalam-puputan-margarana-cAdB|title=Atasan dan Bawahan yang Saling Berhadapan dalam Puputan Margarana|author=Petrik Matanasi|work=tirto.id|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bogdan Dimitrov Filov''' ({{lang-bg|Богдан Димитров Филов}}) (10 April 1883 – 1 February 1945) was a [[Bulgaria]]n [[archaeologist]], [[art history|art historian]] and [[politician]]. He was Prime Minister of [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] during [[World War II]]. During his service, Bulgaria became the seventh nation to join the [[Axis Powers]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Stara Zagora]], Filov was partly educated in [[Imperial Germany]] at [[Leipzig]], [[Freiburg]], and [[Würzburg]]. His Ph.D. dissertation from Freiburg was published as a book&amp;nbsp;– a supplement to the prestigious German magazine ''Klio'' in Leipzig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title =Die Legionen der Provinz Moesia von Augustus bis auf Diokletian: Inaugurraldissertation zur Erlangung der Doktorwürde der Philosophischen Fakultät der Albert-Ludwigs-Universität zu Freiburg .i.B. eingereicht von Bogdan Filow aus Stara Zagora - Bulgarien |first= |last= |place= Leipzig |publisher= Druck von G. Kreysing  |year= 1906 |url=https://archive.org/stream/dielegionenderp01filogoog#page/n5/mode/2up |accessdate= February 28, 2018 |via= Internet Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt; From May 1, 1906, he worked in the National Archaeological Museum in Sofia. Filov studied archeology and [[numismatics]] in [[Bonn]], [[Paris]] and [[Rome]] in 1907–1909. He was the indisputable leader of "antique" (pre-classical) archaeology in Bulgaria.  In 1918 he discovered [[Trebenishta]], a necropolis of [[Peresadyes]], rich with gold and iron artifacts. Between 1910 and 1920 Filov was Director of the National Archaeological Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Early Bulgarian Art by Professor Dr. Bogdan D. Filov, Director of the National Museum in Sofia |publisher= Paul Haupt Academical Book Store  |place=Berne|year= 1919 |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924020685677 |accessdate= February 28, 2018 |via= Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; He conducted the first studies of the ancient city of [[Kabile]], near [[Yambol]], in 1912. In 1920 Filov became a professor of archeology, and of art history, at [[Sofia University]].  In 1920 a Chair of Archaeology was established at the University, and Filov was appointed to it. The Archaeological Society in Sofia developed into an Archaeological Institute with a Department of Antique Archaeology. In 1937, Filov was elected chairman of the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]].

==Prime minister==
On 15 February 1940, following the resignation of [[Georgi Kyoseivanov]], Filov was appointed Prime Minister of the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]].  Filov was an ally of [[Tsar]] [[Boris III of Bulgaria]].  On 7 September, Bulgaria was awarded the [[Southern Dobruja|southern part]] of [[Dobruja]] by the [[Treaty of Craiova]]. On 14 February of the following year, Bulgaria signed a non-aggression pact with the [[Axis powers]] and on 1 March joined the [[Tripartite Pact]].  On Bulgaria's Independence Day, March 3, German troops crossed into Bulgaria on the way to invade the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and the [[Kingdom of Greece]].Though a titular member of the Axis, Bulgaria stayed out of the war as much as possible during the regime of King Boris and Premier Filov.  After the death of Boris in August 1943, Filov became a member of the Regency Council established because the new Tsar, [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Simeon II]], was underage.

==Antisemitic law and pro-Nazi policy==

In November, 1940, the government of Bogdan Filov proposed the [[Law for protection of the nation]]; Parliament voted its approval on December 24, 1940.  This law was equivalent to the [[Nuremberg Laws]] of the [[Third Reich]] and deprived the Jews of civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005355 Holocaust Encyclopaedia: Bulgaria] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506200838/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005355 |date=May 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filov established the Commissariat for Jewish Affairs as executive body concerned with Jews in Bulgaria.  In accordance with a governmental decision made in March 1943, Jews from the "newly annexed territories", who were not Bulgarian subjects, were deported by Bulgarian authorities to [[Death camps of Nazi Germany|German extermination camps]]:  in total, 11,343 Jews from then occupied [[northern Greece]] and [[Vardar Banovina]] were deported to German custody and later to the Treblinka killing centers; almost none survived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.remember-holocaust.info/#11 The Holocaust of Jews from Trakia and Macedonia]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, yielding to pressure from the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] and from the deputy speaker of Parliament, [[Dimitar Peshev]], the Nazi-allied government did not deport its 50,000 Jews, Bulgarian subjects, from the "old lands" (antebellum Bulgaria), thus saving them.

==Death==
Following the armistice with the [[Soviet Union]] whose forces had entered Bulgaria in 1944, a new Communist-dominated government was established and the Regency Council members were arrested.  Filov and ninety-two other public officials were sentenced to death by a "People's Tribunal" on the afternoon of 1 February 1945 and executed by firing squad that night in Sofia cemetery. They were then buried in a mass grave that had been a bomb crater.  The former professor was described in one obituary as a man who had mistakenly "preferred making history to teaching it".&lt;ref&gt;"100 Death Sentences", ''TIME'' Magazine, February 12, 1945&lt;/ref&gt; Filov's property was confiscated and his wife exiled.

The sentence was revoked by the Bulgarian Supreme Court on June 26, 1996.{{citation_needed|date = January 2014}}

'''Charles Bruce Catton''' (October 9, 1899 – August 28, 1978) was an American historian and journalist, known best for his books concerning the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/100200/Bruce-Catton|title=Bruce Catton - American Historian and Journalist|last=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc|date=2015|accessdate=August 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known as a narrative historian, Catton specialized in [[popular history]], featuring interesting characters and historical vignettes, in addition to the basic facts, dates, and analyses. Although his books were researched well and included footnotes, they were not generally presented in a rigorous academic style. He won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] during 1954 for ''[[A Stillness at Appomattox]]'',&lt;ref name=pulitzer/&gt; his study of the final campaign of the war in [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name="dooley"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dooley|first=Dennis|title=Bruce Catton |publisher=''Cleveland Arts Prize'' |url=http://www.clevelandartsprize.org/awardees/bruce_catton.html |accessdate=November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

'''Charles Bruce Catton''' was born in [[Petoskey, Michigan]], to George R. and Adela M. (Patten) Catton, and raised in [[Benzonia, Michigan]]. His father was a [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] [[Minister of religion|minister]], who accepted a teaching position in Benzonia Academy and later became the academy's headmaster. As a boy, Catton first heard the reminiscences of the aged veterans who had fought in the Civil War. In his memoir, ''Waiting for the Morning Train'' (1972), Catton explained how their stories made a lasting impression upon him:
{{Quote|[These stories gave] a color and a tone not merely to our village life, but to the concept of life with which we grew up ... I think I was always subconsciously driven by an attempt to restate that faith and to show where it was properly grounded, how it grew out of what a great many young men on both sides felt and believed and were brave enough to do.&lt;ref&gt;Catton, Bruce. ''Waiting for the Morning Train''. 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;}} During 1916, Catton began attending [[Oberlin College]], but he quit without completing a degree because of [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]].

==Journalism career==

After serving briefly with the [[United States Navy]] during World War I,&lt;ref name="dooley"/&gt; Catton became a reporter and editor for the newspapers The ''[[Cleveland News]]'' (as a freelance reporter), the ''[[Boston American]]'' (1920–1924), and the Cleveland ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' (1925). From 1926 to 1941, he worked for the Newspaper Enterprise Association, a [[The E. W. Scripps Company|Scripps-Howard]] syndicate), for which he wrote editorials and book reviews, as well as serving as a [[Washington, D.C.]] correspondent.&lt;ref name="dooley"/&gt; Catton tried twice to complete his studies, but found himself repeatedly distracted by his newspaper work. Oberlin College awarded him an honorary degree in 1956.&lt;ref name="reynolds"&gt;{{cite web|last=Reynolds|first=Mark C.|title=Golden Anniversary |publisher=''American Heritage'' |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/working-bruce-catton |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing career==

At the start of [[World War II]], Catton was too old for military service. During 1941, he accepted a position as Director of Information for the [[War Production Board]], and later he had similar jobs in the [[Department of Commerce]] and the [[Department of the Interior]]. His experiences as a federal employee prepared him to write his first book, ''The War Lords Of Washington'', during 1948. Although the book was not a commercial success, it inspired Catton to quit federal employment to become a full-time author.&lt;ref name="jensen"&gt;Jensen, Oliver. "[http://www.americanheritage.com/content/working-bruce-catton Working with Bruce Catton]" in ''American Heritage'', February/March 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, Catton accepted the position as founding editor of the new magazine ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]''.&lt;ref name="reynolds"/&gt; Catton served initially as a writer, reviewer, and editor. In the first issue, he wrote:
{{Quote|We intend to deal with that great, unfinished and illogically inspiring story of the American people doing, being and becoming. Our American heritage is greater than any one of us. It can express itself in very homely truths; in the end it can lift up our eyes beyond the glow in the sunset skies.&lt;ref name="reynolds"/&gt;}}

;Army of the Potomac trilogy

During the early 1950s, Catton published three books known collectively as the [[Army of the Potomac]] trilogy, a history of that army. For ''Mr. Lincoln's Army'' (1951), the first volume, Catton recounted the army's formation, the command of [[George B. McClellan]], the [[Peninsula Campaign]], the [[Northern Virginia Campaign]], and the [[Battle of Antietam]]. For the second volume, ''Glory Road'' (1952), Catton recounted the army's history with new commanding generals, from the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] to the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. For his final volume of the trilogy, ''A Stillness at Appomattox'' (1953), Catton recounted the campaigns of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in Virginia from 1864 to the end of the war during 1865. It was his first commercially successful work and it won both the [[Pulitzer Prize for History]]&lt;ref name=pulitzer&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/History "History"]. ''Past winners &amp; finalists by category''. The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved March 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[National Book Award for Nonfiction]].&lt;ref name=nba1954/&gt; The three volumes were later (1988) reissued as a single volume reprint titled, ''Bruce Catton's Civil War''.

;Centennial History of the Civil War

From 1961 to 1965, the [[American Civil War Centennial|Centennial of the Civil War]] was commemorated, and Catton published his Centennial History of the Civil War trilogy. Unlike his previous trilogy, these books emphasized not only military topics, but social, economic, and political topics as well. For the first volume, ''The Coming Fury'' (1961), Catton discussed the causes of the war, culminating in its first major combat operation, the [[First Battle of Bull Run]]. For the second volume, ''Terrible Swift Sword'' (1963), he discussed both sides as they mobilize for a massive war effort. The story continued through 1862, ending with McClellan's dismissal after the [[Battle of Antietam]]. For the third volume, ''Never Call Retreat'' (1965), the war continued through the battles of [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] and [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], and the bloody struggles of 1864 and 1865 before the final surrender.

;Ulysses S. Grant trilogy

After the publication of ''Captain Sam Grant'' (1950) by historian and biographer Lloyd Lewis, Catton wrote the second and third volumes of this trilogy, making extensive use of Lewis's historical research, provided by his widow, Kathryn Lewis, who personally selected Catton to continue her husband's work. In ''Grant Moves South'' (1960), Catton discussed the increasing experience of Grant as a military commander, from victories at the [[Battle of Fort Henry]] and the [[Battle of Fort Donelson]], to the [[Battle of Shiloh]] and the [[Vicksburg Campaign]]. In ''Grant Takes Command'' (1969), Catton discussed Grant's career from the [[Chattanooga Campaign|Battle of Chattanooga]] (1863) through the 1864 Virginia campaigns against [[Robert E. Lee]] and the end of the war.

;Other Civil War books

In addition to these three important trilogies, Catton wrote extensively about the Civil War throughout his career. In ''U. S. Grant and the American Military Tradition'' (1954), Catton writes what many consider one of the best short biographies of the general. In ''Banners at Shenandoah: A Story of Sheridan's Fighting Cavalry'' (1955), Catton wrote for young people about [[Union Army|Union]] cavalry commander [[Philip Sheridan]] in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] during 1864. ''This Hallowed Ground'' (1956) was an account of the war from the Union perspective. Upon its publication, it was widely considered the best single volume history of the Civil War, receiving a [[Fletcher Pratt]] Award from the [[Civil War Round Table]] of New York during 1957.

In ''America Goes to War'' (1958), Catton made the case that the American Civil War was one of the first [[total war]]s. In ''The American Heritage Picture History of the Civil War'' (1960), Catton wrote the accompanying narrative to a book that included more than 800 paintings and period photographs. It received a special Pulitzer Prize citation during 1961. In ''The American Heritage Short History of the Civil War'' (1960), Catton offers a narrative that discussed the military and political aspects of the war. In ''Two Roads to Sumter'' (1963), written with his son William, Catton recounted the 15 years prior to the war, as considered from the points of view of the two main politicians involved in the conflict: [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Jefferson Davis]]. In ''Gettysburg: The Final Fury'' (1974), Catton offered a slim volume concerning the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], dominated by photographs and illustrations.

;Other books

In addition to Civil War histories, Catton published other books, including ''The War Lords Of Washington'' (1948), an account of Washington, D.C., during World War II, based on his experiences in the federal government, ''Four Days: The Historical Record Of The Death Of President Kennedy'' (1964), a 144-page collaboration of the ''American Heritage'' magazine and [[United Press International]] on the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]], and ''Waiting for the Morning Train'' (1972), about the author's Michigan boyhood. Toward the end of his life, Catton published ''Michigan: A Bicentennial History'' (1976) and ''The Bold &amp; Magnificent Dream: America's Founding Years, 1492–1815'' (1978).

==Personal life==

On August 16, 1925, Catton married Hazel H. Cherry.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Bruce Catton, Civil War Historian, Dies at 78 |publisher=''The New York Times'' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1009.html |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1926, they had a son, William Bruce Catton, who taught history at Princeton University and at [[Middlebury College]], Vermont, where he was the first Charles A. Dana Professor of History.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=William B.

==Death and legacy==

Bruce Catton died in a hospital near his summer home at Frankfort, Michigan, after a respiratory illness.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=John J.|title=He Rewrote History |publisher=''MyNorth'' |url=http://www.mynorth.com/My-North/June-2009/He-Rewrote-History/ |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in Benzonia Township Cemetery in [[Benzie County]], Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Benzonia Township Cemetery|publisher=''USGS Archives''|url=http://www.usgwarchives.org/mi/tsphoto/benzie/benzonia/benzonia-c.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120914060024/http://www.usgwarchives.org/mi/tsphoto/benzie/benzonia/benzonia-c.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=September 14, 2012|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1977, the year before his death, Catton received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the nation's greatest civilian honor, from President [[Gerald R. Ford]], who noted that the author and historian "made us hear the sounds of battle and cherish peace."

Of the many Civil War historians, Catton was arguably the most prolific and popular. Oliver Jensen, who succeeded him as editor of the magazine ''American Heritage'', wrote:
{{Quote|No one ever wrote American history with more easy grace, beauty and emotional power, or greater understanding of its meaning, than Bruce Catton. There is a near-magic power of imagination in Catton's work that seemed to project him physically into the battlefields, along the dusty roads and to the campfires of another age.&lt;ref name="dooley"/&gt;}}

The Bruce Catton Collection is housed in the Archives of The Citadel, the Military College of South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www3.citadel.edu/archivesguide/index.php/CATTON,_BRUCE,_1899-1978 | title = The Citadel Archives, Catton, Bruce, 1899–1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Civil War'' Documentary===
[[Ken Burns]]'s television documentary ''[[The Civil War (TV series)]]'' was based partly on Bruce Catton's books, and resulted in a revival of interest in his histories.

===Bruce Catton Prize===
Since 1984, the Bruce Catton Prize was awarded for lifetime achievement in the writing of history. In cooperation with [[American Heritage Publishing Company]], the [[Society of American Historians]] during 1984 initiated the biennial prize that honors an entire body of work. It is named for Bruce Catton, prizewinning historian and first editor of ''American Heritage'' magazine. The prize consisted of a certificate and $2,500.

The prize was awarded to [[Dumas Malone]] (1984), [[C. Vann Woodward]] (1986), [[Richard B. Morris]] (1988), [[Henry Steele Commager]] (1990), [[Edmund S. Morgan]] (1992), [[John Hope Franklin]] (1994), [[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]] (1996), [[Richard N. Current]] (1998), [[Bernard Bailyn]] (2000), [[Gerda Lerner]] (2002), [[David Brion Davis]] (2004), and [[David Herbert Donald]] (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Bruce Catton Prize|publisher=''The Society of American Historians''|url=http://sah.columbia.edu/content/bruce-catton-prize|accessdate=November 7, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929015513/http://sah.columbia.edu/content/bruce-catton-prize|archivedate=September 29, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pyle pirates burying2.jpg|thumb|[[Howard Pyle]] illustration of  pirates burying [[Captain Kidd]]'s treasure, from ''Howard Pyle's Book of Pirates''.]]

A '''buried treasure''' is an important part of the popular beliefs surrounding [[pirate]]s and [[Old West]] [[outlaw]]s. According to popular conception, [[criminals]] and others often buried their stolen fortunes in remote places, intending to return for them later, often with the use of [[treasure map]]s.

==Pirate treasure==
[[Image:Treasure chest color.png|right]]
In reality, pirates burying treasure was rare: the only pirate known to have buried treasure was [[William Kidd]],&lt;ref name="Cordingly" /&gt; who is believed to have buried at least some of his wealth on [[Long Island]] before sailing into [[New York City]]. Kidd had originally been commissioned as a [[privateer]] for [[England]], but his behavior had strayed into outright piracy, and he hoped that his treasure could serve as a bargaining chip in negotiations to avoid punishment. His bid was unsuccessful, however, and Kidd was hanged as a pirate.

In English fiction there are three well-known stories that helped to popularize the myth of buried pirate treasure:&lt;ref&gt;Paine, pp. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Wolfert Webber]]" (1824) by [[Washington Irving]], "[[The Gold-Bug]]" (1843) by [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and ''[[Treasure Island]]'' (1883) by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. They differ widely in plot and literary treatment but are blood kin from the common ancestor of the William Kidd legend.&lt;ref name=Paine28&gt;Paine, pg. 28&lt;/ref&gt; David Cordingly states that "The effect of ''Treasure Island'' on our perception of pirates cannot be overestimated," and says the idea of treasure maps leading to buried treasure "is an entirely fictional device."&lt;ref name="Cordingly"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cordingly|first=David|year=1995|title=Under the Black Flag: The Romance and Reality of Life Among the Pirates|isbn=0-679-42560-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stevenson's ''Treasure Island'' was directly influenced by Irving's "Wolfert Webber", Stevenson saying in his preface "It is my debt to Washington Irving that exercises my conscience, and justly so, for I believe plagiarism was rarely carried farther... the whole inner spirit and a good deal of the material detail of my first chapters... were the property of Washington Irving."&lt;ref name=Paine28/&gt;

In 1911, American author [[Ralph D. Paine]] conducted a survey of all known or purported stories of buried treasure and published them in ''The Book of Buried Treasure''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/search.php?query=%22the%20book%20of%20buried%20treasure%22%20AND%20mediatype%3Atexts ''The Book of Buried Treasure''] at [[Internet Archive]] (scanned books original editions)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=garfield/&gt; He found a common trait in all the stories: there was always a lone survivor of a piratical crew who somehow preserved a chart showing where the treasure was buried, but unable to return himself, he transfers the map or information to a friend or shipmate, usually on his deathbed.&lt;ref name=garfield/&gt; This person would then go search in vain for the treasure, but not before transferring the legend down to another hapless seeker.&lt;ref name=garfield&gt;Simon Garfield. ''On the Map: Why the World Looks the Way It Does'' (2012). Pgs. 176-180&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous and notorious cases==
The Roman historian [[Dio Cassius]] says that, in the early 2nd century, the [[Dacia]]n king [[Decebalus]] had changed the course of river [[Sargetia]] and buried [[Decebalus Treasure|tons of gold and silver]] in the river bed.
Later he ordered the river to be restored and the slaves involved in the works to be executed.
However one of his nobles revealed its location to the Romans.
The Byzantine historian [[Jordanes]] tells a similar story of the burial of the [[Visigoth]] king [[Alaric I]] and his treasure under the river [[Busento]] in 410. 

There are a number of reports of supposed buried pirate treasure that surfaced much earlier than these works, which indicates that at least the idea was around for more than a century before those stories were published. For example, extensive excavation has taken place on [[Oak Island]] (in [[Nova Scotia]]) since 1795 in the belief that one or more pirate captains had stashed large amounts of loot there. These excavations were said to have been prompted by still older legends of buried pirate treasure in the area. No treasure has ever been reported to be found.

The [[Treasure of Lima]] is a supposed buried treasure on [[Cocos Island]] in the Pacific left there by pirates.&lt;ref name=copping&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/costarica/9450737/British-expedition-to-Pacific-treasure-island-where-pirates-buried-their-plunder.html |title=British expedition to Pacific 'treasure island' where pirates buried their plunder |date=5 August 2012 |author=Jasper Copping |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=August 12, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812062945/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/costarica/9450737/British-expedition-to-Pacific-treasure-island-where-pirates-buried-their-plunder.html |archivedate=12 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The treasure, estimated to be worth £160 million, was stolen by British Captain William Thompson in 1820 after he was entrusted to transport it from Peru to Mexico.&lt;ref name=copping/&gt;

The only authenticated treasure chest in the United States, once owned by [[Thomas Tew]], is kept at the [[Pirate Soul Museum]] in St Augustine, Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abravanel|first1=Lesley|last2=Miller|first2=Laura Lea|last3=Miller|first3=Laura|title=Frommer's Florida 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b5VT8fIGiggC&amp;pg=PA236|page=302|isbn=9780470890219|date=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Closer to modern times, the notorious drug lord, [[Pablo Escobar]] buried large sums of money in the form of US currency across Colombia. While a lot of it has been retrieved, large portions still remain buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/98652/Hunt-for-drug-lord-s-millions|title=Hunt for drug lord's millions|last=Parker|first=Mike|date=2009-05-03|work=Express.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/542814/Pablo-Escobar-money-Narcos-netflix-how-much-millions-drug-lord-hidden-secret|title=Where are Pablo Escobar's secret millions?

Former corsair turned pirate, Olivier Levasseur known as "The Buzzard", is known to have hidden one of the biggest treasures in pirate history, estimated at over 4,5 billion euros, and leaving a cryptogram (with templar alphabet) behind with its whereabouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pirates-corsaires.com/levasseur-la-buse.htm|title=Biographie du pirate Olivier Levasseur dit La Buse - Pirates &amp; Corsaires célèbres|first=Alain|last=DECAYEUX|date=|website=www.pirates-corsaires.com|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205072904/http://www.pirates-corsaires.com/levasseur-la-buse.htm|archivedate=5 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Bibique, whose real name was Joseph Guy Germain Tipveau, discovered a hint between the manuscript &amp; a rock (discovered at the Ravine of despair) exposed at the City Hall of La Possession, in the isle of La Réunion. In 1949, Reginald Cruise-Wilkins while being sick with malaria, meets Captain Goldvorg, who introduces him to Madam Rose Savy. At her house, he found out that she discovered engraved marks &amp; demarcation lines on rocks during the 1920s, letting her to the conclusion that those were pirate symbols. She visited the French National Library (Bibliothèque Nationale de France) and received confirmation that the documents she possessed originated from La Buse. Cruise-Wilkins bought those documents for $29, after that, he started great searches for the treasure (he found only a flintlock rifle, sword blade, figurines and a few coins; pale reward for a 30.000 sterling pounds investment). After his death, in 1977, John Cruise-Wilkins took on his father's search (siding with an American investor) using dynamite on the coastal rocks. Jacques et Edward, two other treasure-hunters, searched deep in the jungle, where they discovered ruins, an old coffer, a bell, lanterns, and bones (they were at odds with Wilkins, after a quarrel, where they supposedly fabricated markings on the rocks). A popular story tells that in the same island many other pirates buried their own treasures; like Hodoul, Boudin, Avery, Kid, Halsay ou Taylor... Nowadays, John Cruise-Wilkins still searches for the treasure of La Buse, in the Seychelles, at the site of Bel-Ombre, north of Mahé. There he found a cavern with a network of tunnels. He indicated that all modern technology are useless because of the omnipresence of minerals &amp; Iron Pyrite ("Fool's Gold") inside the rocks.

Buried treasure is not the same as a [[hoard]], of which there have been thousands of examples found by archaeologists and metal detectors. Buried treasure is as much a cultural concept as an objective thing. It is related to pirates and other criminals who leave stolen artifacts behind for later retrieval, typically in remote places like islands, sometimes with maps leading back to the treasure.

{{nihongo|'''Chōhō'''|長保|}} was a {{nihongo|[[Japanese era name]]|年号,|''nengō'',|lit. "year name"}} after ''[[Chōtoku]]'' and before ''[[Kankō]].''  This period spanned the years from January 999 through July 1004.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Chōhō''" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 119|page=119}}; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File].&lt;/ref&gt; The reigning emperor was {{nihongo|[[Emperor Ichijō|Ichijō]]''-tennō''|一条天皇}}.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA150,M1  ''Annales des empereurs du japon,'' pp. 150-154;] Brown, Delmer ''et al.'' (1979).

To protect Japan's cultural heritage, the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties contains a {{nihongo|"designation system"|指定制度}} under which selected important items are designated as Cultural Properties,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For the purpose of this article, the term ''Cultural Properties'' is an official designation&lt;/ref&gt; which imposes restrictions on the alteration, repair, and export of such designated objects. Designation can occur at a {{nihongo|[[Japan|national]]|国指定文化財}}, {{nihongo|[[Prefectures of Japan|prefectural]]|都道府県指定文化財}} or {{nihongo|[[Municipalities of Japan|municipal]]|市町村指定文化財}} level. As of 1 February 2012, there were approximately 16,000 nationally designated, 21,000 prefecturally designated, and 86,000 municipally designated properties (one property may include more than one item).&lt;ref name="National"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bunkazai/shoukai/shitei.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918085651/http://www.bunka.go.jp/bunkazai/shoukai/shitei.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 September 2007 |title=Counts of national Cultural Properties |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |date=1 February 2012 |accessdate=16 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PrefMun"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bunkazai/shiteibunkazai/kensu.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412202932/http://www.bunka.go.jp/bunkazai/shiteibunkazai/kensu.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 April 2008 |title=Counts of prefectural and municipal Cultural Properties |date=1 May 2010 |accessdate=16 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the designation system there also exists a {{nihongo|"registration system"|登録制度}}, which guarantees a lower level of protection and support.&lt;ref name="chapter06"/&gt;

==Categories of designated Cultural Properties==
The Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties 1950 classifies items designated as Cultural Properties in the following categories:

===Tangible Cultural Properties===
{{Main|Tangible Cultural Properties of Japan}}
{{For|lists of National Treasures of Japan|Lists of National Treasures of Japan}}
[[File:Himeji Castle The Keep Towers.jpg|thumb|left|[[Himeji Castle]]'s keep, designated a National Treasure in 1951&lt;br /&gt;([[List of World Heritage Sites in Japan|UNESCO World Heritage Site]])]]
{{nihongo|[[Tangible Cultural Properties of Japan|Tangible Cultural Properties]]|有形文化財|yūkei bunkazai}} are cultural products of high historical or artistic value whether structures ([[Shinto shrines|shrines]], [[Buddhist temples in Japan|temples]], other buildings), works of art ([[Japanese painting|paintings]], [[Japanese sculpture|sculpture]]), [[Japanese handicrafts|craft works]], [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphic works]], ancient documents, archaeological materials, historic materials and other such items. All objects which are not structures are termed "works of fine arts and crafts".&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt;

Items designated Tangible Cultural Properties can then, if they satisfy certain criteria, be designated {{nihongo|[[Important Cultural Properties of Japan]]|重要文化財|jūyō bunkazai}}&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The term is often shortened into just {{nihongo3|''jūbun''|重文}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or {{nihongo|[[National Treasures of Japan|National Treasures]]|国宝|kokuhō}} for especially valuable items.

Any alteration to Important Cultural Properties and National Treasures requires governmental permission and exportation is forbidden, except when authorized. The National Treasury supports the conservation and restoration of these items, and the Commissioner for Cultural Affairs provides technical assistance for their administration, restoration, public display and other activities. Conservation work is performed by an item's owner, with financial support available for large expenses. Because many items are made of wood, bark and other flammable materials, they are often extremely susceptible to fires. Owners are therefore given subsidies to install fire and other disaster prevention systems.&lt;ref name="chapter06"/&gt;

[[File:Udamikumari1248.jpg|right|thumb|[[Uda Mikumari Shrine]] in [[Uda, Nara|Uda]], [[Nara Prefecture|Nara]]]]

As of 1 February 2012, there were 12,816 Important Cultural Properties (including 1,082 National Treasures), of which approximately one fifth were structures. By class, there were 1,974 (198) paintings;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The number between brackets represents National Treasures, included in the total&lt;/ref&gt; 2,654 (126) sculptures; 2,428 (252) crafts; 1,882 (223) calligraphic works; 739 (60) ancient documents; 586 (44) archaeological materials; 167 (3) historical materials; and 2,386 (216) structural designations, including 4,469 (264) individual structures.&lt;ref name="National"/&gt; There were a further 12,251 designations at prefectural and 49,793 at municipal level.&lt;ref name="PrefMun"/&gt;

===Intangible Cultural Properties===
{{Main|Intangible Cultural Properties of Japan}}
{{For|lists of holders of Important Intangible Cultural Properties|List of Living National Treasures of Japan (crafts)|List of Living National Treasures of Japan (performing arts)}}
[[File:Noh3.jpg|thumb|left|[[Noh]] performance at [[Itsukushima Shrine]]]]
{{nihongo|[[Intangible Cultural Properties of Japan|Intangible Cultural Properties]]|無形文化財|mukei bunkazai}} are cultural products of high historical or artistic value such as drama, music, and craft techniques.

Items of particular importance can be designated as {{nihongo|Important Intangible Cultural Properties|重要無形文化財|jūyō mukei bunkazai}}.&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt; Recognition is also given to the 'holders' of the necessary techniques, to encourage their transmission.&lt;ref name="chapter06"/&gt; There are three types of recognition: individual recognition, collective recognition, and group recognition. Special grants of two million yen a year are given to individual holders (the so-called [[Living National Treasures of Japan|National Living Treasures]]&lt;ref name="chapter06"/&gt;) to help protect these properties. The government also contributes part of the expenses incurred either by the holder of the Intangible Cultural Property during training of his successor, or by a recognized group for public performances.&lt;ref name="chapter06"/&gt;

To promote understanding, and therefore the transmission across generations, of these Cultural Properties, exhibitions concerning them are organized. The government through the Japan Arts Council also holds training workshops and other activities to educate future generations of [[noh]], ''[[bunraku]]'', and [[kabuki]] personnel.&lt;ref name="chapter06"/&gt;

As of 1 February 2012, there were 115 Important Intangible Cultural Properties and a further 167 designations at prefectural and 522 at municipal level.&lt;ref name="National"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PrefMun"/&gt;

===Folk Cultural Properties===
[[File:Shachi.jpg|thumb|[[Kyūshū]]'s [[Karatsu Kunchi]] festival was designated an Important Intangible Folk Cultural Property in 1980.]]
{{About||a list of Important Intangible Folk Cultural Properties|List of Important Intangible Folk Cultural Properties|a list of Important Tangible Folk Cultural Properties|List of Important Tangible Folk Cultural Properties}}

Folk Cultural Properties are items indispensable to understand the role and influence of tradition in the daily life of the Japanese, such as manners and customs related to food, clothing, work, religion; folk performing arts; and folk techniques used to produce the mentioned Folk Cultural Properties.&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt;

Folk Cultural Properties can be classified as Intangible or Tangible.

{{nihongo|Intangible Folk Cultural Properties|無形民俗文化財|mukei minzoku bunkazai}} are items such as manners and customs related to food, clothing and housing, occupation, religion, and annual events; folk performing arts; and folk techniques used in connection with the mentioned items.&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt;

Clothes, tools and implements, houses and other objects used together with Intangible Folk Cultural Properties are classified as {{nihongo|Tangible Folk Cultural Properties|有形民俗文化財|yūkei minzoku bunkazai}}.&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt;

Folk Cultural Properties can then, if they satisfy certain criteria, be designated {{nihongo|Important Tangible Folk Cultural Properties|重要有形民俗文化財|jūyō yūkei minzoku bunkazai}}  or {{nihongo|Important Intangible Folk Cultural Properties|重要無形民俗文化財|jūyō mukei minzoku bunkazai}}.

The government subsidizes projects for the restoration, administration, preservation, utilization, disaster prevention, etc. of Important Tangible Folk Cultural Properties.&lt;ref name="chapter06"/&gt; In the case of Important Intangible Folk Cultural Properties, public subsidies help local governments and other entities fund projects to train successors, restore or acquire props, tools and other objects.&lt;ref name="chapter06"/&gt;

As of 1 February 2012, there were 211 Important Tangible and 272 Important Intangible Folk Cultural Properties and a further 733/1595 designations at prefectural and 4,698/6,062 at municipal level.&lt;ref name="National"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PrefMun"/&gt;

===Monuments===
{{Main|Monuments of Japan}}
{{For|a list of all "Special Places of Scenic Beauty", "Special Historic Sites" and "Special Natural Monuments"|List of Special Places of Scenic Beauty, Special Historic Sites and Special Natural Monuments}}
[[File:Tenryuji spring 005 Kyoto JPN.JPG|left|thumb|The garden of [[Tenryū-ji]] in [[Kyoto]] is a designated Special Place of Scenic Beauty]]
{{nihongo|Monuments|記念物|kinenbutsu}}  include historic locations such as [[Midden|shell mounds]], ancient tombs, sites of palaces, sites of forts or castles, monumental dwelling houses and other sites of high historical or scientific value; gardens, bridges, gorges, mountains, and other places of great scenic beauty; and natural features such as animals, plants, and geological or mineral formations of high scientific value.&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chapter06"/&gt;

The government designates "significant" items classifying them in three categories: {{nihongo|Historic Sites|史跡|shiseki}}, {{nihongo|Places of Scenic Beauty|名勝|meishō}}, and {{nihongo|Natural Monuments|天然記念物|tennen kinenbutsu}}. Items of particularly high significance receive higher classifications: {{nihongo|Special Historic Sites|特別史跡|tokubetsu shiseki}}, {{nihongo|Special Places of Scenic Beauty|特別名勝|tokubetsu meishō}}, and {{nihongo|Special Natural Monuments|特別天然記念物|tokubetsu tennen kinenbutsu}} respectively.

Alterations to the existing state of a site or activities affecting its preservation require permission from the Commissioner for Cultural Affairs. Financial support for purchasing and conserving designated land and for the utilization of the site is available through local governments.&lt;ref name="chapter06"/&gt;

As of 1 February 2012, there were 1,667 (60) Historic Sites; 331 (30) Places of Scenic Beauty; and 953 (72) Natural Monuments (including Special Natural Monuments). There were a further 6,195 designations at prefectural and 24,598 at municipal level. A single designation can be classed under more than one of these categories; the number is for primary classification (for instance [[Hamarikyu Gardens|Hamarikyū Gardens]] in Tokyo are classed as a Special Place of Scenic Beauty, with a secondary classification as a Special Historic Site; for the purpose of these counts it would be a Special Place of Scenic Beauty).&lt;ref name="National"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PrefMun"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bsys/maindetails.asp?register_id=401&amp;item_id=712 |title=旧浜離宮庭園 |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural Landscapes===
{{main|Cultural Landscapes of Japan}}
[[File:Ujigawa02bs2610.jpg|thumb|The city of [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]] near Kyoto is an Important Cultural Landscape.]]{{nihongo|Cultural Landscapes|文化的景観|bunkateki keikan}} are landscapes which have evolved together with the people who inhabit them and with the geocultural features of a region, and which are indispensable to understand the lifestyle of the Japanese.&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt; They can be terraced rice fields, mountain villages, waterways and the like.  Items of particular importance can be designated as Important Cultural Landscapes.&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt;

As of 1 February 2012, 30 areas in Japan have been designated Important Cultural Landscapes, with a further 7 designations at prefectural and 101 at municipal level.&lt;ref name="National"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PrefMun"/&gt;

===Groups of Traditional Buildings===
{{main|Groups of Traditional Buildings}}
{{nihongo|Groups of Traditional Buildings|伝統的建造物群|Dentōteki kenzōbutsu-gun}} is a category introduced by a 1975 amendment of the law which mandates the protection of groups of traditional buildings which, together with their environment, form a beautiful scenery. They can be post towns, castle towns, mining towns, merchant quarters, ports, farming or fishing villages, etc.&lt;ref name="chapter06"/&gt;

Municipalities can designate items of particular importance as Preservation Districts for Groups of Traditional Buildings and approve measures to protect them. Items of even higher importance are then designated Important Preservation Districts for Groups of Traditional Buildings by the central government.&lt;ref name="chapter06"/&gt; The government's [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] then provides guidance, advice, and funds for repairs and other work. Additional support is given in the form of preferential tax treatment.

As of 1 February 2012, 93 Groups of Traditional Buildings have been nationally designated, with a further 1 designation at prefectural and 89 at municipal level.&lt;ref name="National"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PrefMun"/&gt;

==Buried Cultural Properties==
{{nihongo|Buried Cultural Properties|埋蔵文化財|maizō bunkazai}} are Cultural Properties, such as tombs, caves, and ruins, which are buried into the ground.&lt;ref name="chapter06"/&gt;

About 460,000 ruin locations are presently known to exist in Japan. The protective measures taken include restrictions on their excavation. Any investigative excavation and construction work in the vicinity of a known site requires a notification. If preservation of the site is impossible, developers are required to cover expenses necessary to carry out an excavation, record any data and preserve what is possible.&lt;ref name="chapter06"/&gt; In cases when charging these expenses is not possible, local public organizations carry out the investigation with public funds.&lt;ref name="chapter06"/&gt;

Any object found under the ground must be given to police, except when its owner is known. The object is then investigated to determine if it qualifies as a Cultural Property. Any Cultural Property whose owner is not known becomes as a rule property of the [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]].

==Conservation Techniques for Cultural Properties==
[[File:Ukiyo-e dsc04679.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ukiyo-e]] [[Woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock printing]] is a protected technique]]
{{Main|Conservation Techniques for Cultural Properties}}
Techniques for the production of materials necessary for restoration and conservation, and the techniques of restoration and conservation themselves are not Cultural Properties, and are classified as Conservation Techniques for Cultural Properties.

This form of protection was approved in 1975 (see below) and was made necessary by the disappearance of skilled craftsmen as a result of the industrialization.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p14"&gt;{{Harvnb|Enders|Gutschow|1998|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The techniques protected by the law applied to Tangible and Intangible Cultural Properties and included the mounting of paintings and calligraphy on scrolls, the repair of [[Japanese lacquerware|lacquerware]] and wooden sculptures, and the production of [[Noh]] masks, costumes and instruments.&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p14"/&gt; The minister of education can designate techniques indispensable for conservation as Selected Conservation Techniques. 
Examples of nominated entities in the field of architecture are the Japanese Association for Conservation of Architectural Monuments (for repairs and woodwork), the National Association for the Preservation of Roofing Techniques for Shrines and Temples (techniques for organic roofing materials: [[Chamaecyparis obtusa|cypress]] bark, shingles, thatch) and the Association for the Conservation of Cultural Properties (paintings and lacquering of architectural monuments)&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p14"/&gt; In addition to the prestige associated with the nomination, the government provides subsidies for training, courses and documentation.&lt;ref name="missiontopreserve"/&gt;

==Categories of registered Cultural Properties==
Besides the above {{nihongo|"designation system"|指定制度}}, there exists a {{nihongo|"registration system"|登録制度}}, which guarantees a more modest level of protection. The existing categories are:

===Registered Tangible Cultural Properties===
Compared to designated Important Cultural Properties and National Treasures, {{nihongo|Registered Tangible Cultural Properties|登録有形文化財}} entail fewer responsibilities for the owner. Loss, damage, change of ownership and intended changes that affect more than 25 percent of the visible surface need to be announced.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p15"/&gt; On the other side, the owner is eligible for low interest loans for maintenance and repairs, subsidies for an architect and tax reductions of up to 50 percent.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p15"/&gt; This new protection level is based on notification, guidance, and advice, and aims at voluntary protection of cultural properties by their owners.&lt;ref name="chapter06"/&gt; As of 1 February 2012, there were 8,699 registered structures and 13 registered works of art or craft.&lt;ref name="National"/&gt;

===Registered Tangible Folk Cultural Properties===
Items particularly in need of preservation and utilization can become {{nihongo|Registered Tangible Folk Cultural Properties|登録有形民俗文化財}}. There is no equivalent system for Intangible Folk Cultural Properties.&lt;ref name="chapter06"/&gt; As of 1 February 2012, there were 21 registered properties.&lt;ref name="National"/&gt;

===Registered Monuments===
Monuments from the [[Meiji period]] onward which require preservation can be registered as {{nihongo|Registered Monuments|登録記念物}}, thereby gaining a moderate level of protection based on notification and guidance. As of 1 February 2012, 61 monuments were registered under this system.&lt;ref name="chapter06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="National"/&gt;

==History of the preservation of cultural properties==

===Background===
Most cultural properties in Japan used to belong to Buddhist temples and [[Shinto shrine]]s, or were handed down in aristocratic and [[samurai]] families.&lt;ref name="pamphlet05"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bunkazai/pamphlet/pdf/pamphlet_en_05.pdf |title=Intangible Cultural Heritage |editor=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |work=Administration of Cultural Affairs in Japan ― Fiscal 2009 |publisher=Asia/Pacific Cultural Centre for [[UNESCO]] (ACCU) |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524022138/http://www.bunka.go.jp/bunkazai/pamphlet/pdf/pamphlet_en_05.pdf |archivedate=May 24, 2011 }} &lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/661.pdf |title=Advisory Body Evaluation Himeji-jo |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |date=1992-10-01 |accessdate=2009-12-16 |format=PDF }}&lt;!-- see edit summary on 8 April 2016 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feudal Japan]] came to an abrupt end in 1867/68 when the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] was replaced by a new system of government with the so-called [[Meiji Restoration]].&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Enders|Gutschow|1998|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Largely because of the official policy of [[Shinbutsu bunri|separation of Shinto and Buddhism]] and of the anti-Buddhist movements that advocated the return to [[Shinto]], a large number of Buddhist buildings and artwork were destroyed in an event known as ''[[haibutsu kishaku]]'' (literally "abolish [[Buddhism]] and destroy [[Gautama Buddha|Shākyamuni]]").&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="edwards-p38"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gibbon-p331"/&gt; In 1871 the government confiscated the lands of temples, which were seen as a symbol of the previous ruling elite, and expropriated the properties of the feudal lords, causing the loss of historic castles and residences.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gibbon-p331"/&gt; It is estimated that nearly 18,000 temples closed during this time.&lt;ref name="gibbon-p331"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gibbon|2005|p=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor that had a big influence on the cultural heritage was the increased industrialization and westernization, which accompanied the restoration and led to the impoverishment of Buddhist and Shinto institutions, the decay of temples and the export of valuable objects.&lt;ref name="jokilehto-p279"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jokilehto|2002|p=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="edwards-p39"&gt;{{Harvnb|Edwards|2005|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coaldrake-p248"&gt;{{Harvnb|Coaldrake|2002|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1871 Plan for the Preservation of Ancient Artifacts===
[[File:Okakura Tenshin.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Portrait of an Asian man with moustache dressed in traditional Japanese cloths. He is looking down with his arms crossed.|[[Okakura Kakuzō]]]]
On recommendation of universities, in 1871 the Department of State ([[Dajō-kan]]) issued a decree for the protection of antiquities, the {{nihongo|Plan for the Preservation of Ancient Artifacts|古器旧物保存方|koki kyūbutsu hozonkata}}, ordering [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]], [[Buddhist temples in Japan|temples]] and [[Shinto shrines|shrines]] to compile lists of  suitable important buildings and art treasures.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coaldrake-p248"/&gt; However, in the face of radical westernization, these efforts ground to a halt.&lt;ref name="coaldrake-p248"/&gt;
Starting in 1880, the government allotted funds for the preservation of ancient shrines and temples.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In connection with the establishment of "[[State Shinto]]", shrines had received annual funds since 1874.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jokilehto-p279"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p12"/&gt; By 1894, 539 shrines and temples had received subsidies for repairs and reconstruction&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="edwards-p39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="machizukuri"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings that were repaired during this period include the five-storied [[pagoda]] of [[Daigo-ji]], the ''[[kon-dō]]'' of [[Tōshōdai-ji]] and the ''[[hon-dō]]'' of [[Kiyomizu-dera]].&lt;ref name="coaldrake-p248"/&gt; In a survey carried out under guidance of [[Okakura Kakuzō]] and [[Ernest Fenollosa]] from 1888 to 1897 all over Japan, about 210,000 objects of artistic or historic merit were evaluated and catalogued.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="edwards-p39"/&gt; The end of the 19th century saw a drastic change in political climate and cultural values: from an enthusiastic adoption of western values to a returned interest in the Japanese cultural heritage. Japanese architectural history appeared on [[Curriculum|curricula]] and the first books on architectural history were published, stimulated by the newly compiled inventories.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p12"/&gt;

===1897 Ancient Temples and Shrines Preservation Law===
On June 5, 1897, the government enacted the {{nihongo|Ancient Temples and Shrines Preservation Law|古社寺保存法|koshaji hozonhō}} (law number 49), which was the first systematic law for the preservation of Japanese historic art and architecture.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coaldrake-p248"/&gt; This law was formulated under the guidance of the architectural historian and architect [[Itō Chūta]] and established in 20 articles a system of governmental financial support for the preservation of buildings and the restoration of artworks.&lt;ref name="coaldrake-p248"/&gt; It applied to  works of architecture and related art of historic uniqueness and exceptional quality (art. 2).&lt;ref name="coaldrake-p248"/&gt; Applications for financial support were to be made to the Ministry of Internal Affairs (art. 1), and the responsibility for restoration or preservation lay in the hand of local officials (art. 3). Restoration works were financed directly from the national coffers (art. 8).

[[File:Hiunkaku Nishi Honganji.jpg|thumb|left|The Hiunkaku at [[Hongan-ji#Nishi Hongan-ji|Nishi Hongan-ji]] in Kyoto]]
This first law was followed by a second law on December 15, 1897 giving supplementary provisions for designating works of art ''in the possession of temples or shrines'' as {{nihongo|"National Treasure"|国宝|kokuhō}}; religious architecture could be designated as {{nihongo|"Specially Protected Buildings"|特別保護建造物|tokubetsu hogo kenzōbutsu}}.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coaldrake-p249"&gt;{{Harvnb|Coaldrake|2002|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main criteria for designation were "artistic superiority" and "value as historical evidence and wealth of historical associations", but also age was considered in the designation.&lt;ref name="jokilehto-p280"/&gt; Designated artworks could be from any of the following categories: painting, sculpture, calligraphy, books and handicrafts; subsequently swords were added. However the law was limited to items held by religious institutions, leaving privately owned articles unprotected.&lt;ref name="missiontopreserve"/&gt; Funds for the restoration of certain works of art and structures were raised from 20,000 yen to 150,000 yen and fines were set for the destruction of Cultural Properties. Owners had to register designated objects with newly created museums, which were granted first option in case of sale.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p12"/&gt; Initially, 44 temple and shrine buildings and 155 relics were thus designated, including the ''[[kon-dō]]'' at [[Hōryū-ji]].&lt;ref name="missiontopreserve"&gt;{{cite news

The laws of 1897 are the foundation for today's preservation law.&lt;ref name="coaldrake-p249"/&gt; At the time of their enactment only England, France, Greece and four other European nations had similar legislation in place.&lt;ref name="edwards-p38"&gt;{{Harvnb|Edwards|2005|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restoration of [[Tōdai-ji]]'s ''[[Main Hall (Japanese Buddhism)|Daibutsuden]]'' from 1906 to 1913 was carried out under these laws.&lt;ref name="coaldrake-p249"/&gt; In 1914 the administration of cultural properties was transferred from the Ministry of Internal Affairs to the Ministry of Education (today's [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|MEXT]]).&lt;ref name="gibbon-p332"/&gt;

===1919 Historical Sites, Places of Scenic Beauty, and Natural Monuments Preservation Law===
At the beginning of the 20th century, modernization transformed the landscape and posed a threat to historic and natural monuments. Societies of prominent men like the "Imperial Ancient Sites Survey Society" or the "Society for the Investigation and Preservation of Historic Sites and Aged Trees" lobbied and achieved a resolution in the [[Japanese House of Peers|House of Peers]] for conservation measures. Eventually, this led to the 1919 {{nihongo|Historical Sites, Places of Scenic Beauty, and Natural Monuments Preservation Law|史蹟名勝天然紀念物保存法|shiseki meishō tennenkinenbutsu hozonhō}}, giving the same protection and cataloging to these properties as temples, shrines and pieces of art had received in 1897.&lt;ref name="edwards-p39"/&gt;

===1929 National Treasures Preservation Law===
By 1929 about 1100 properties had been designated under the "Ancient Shrines and Temples Preservation Law" of 1897.&lt;ref name="jokilehto-p280"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jokilehto|2002|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these were religious buildings erected from the 7th to the early 17th century. About 500 buildings had been extensively restored with 90% of costs paid from the national budget. Restorations during the [[Meiji period]] often employed new materials and techniques.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p12"/&gt;

[[File:KofunHorseCharriots.JPG|thumb|right|This bronze mirror is a [[Kofun period]] National Treasure.&lt;ref name="pamphlet05" /&gt;]]
In 1929, the {{nihongo|National Treasures Preservation Law|国宝保存法|kokuhō hozonhō}} was passed and came into force on July 1 of the same year. This law replaced the laws from 1897, extending protection to all public and private institutions and private individuals in order to prevent the export or removal of cultural properties.&lt;ref name="missiontopreserve"/&gt;&lt;ref name="machizukuri"/&gt; The focus was extended from religious buildings to [[Japanese castle|castles]], [[Japanese teahouse|teahouses]], residences and more recent religious buildings. Many of these structures had been transferred from feudal to private owners following the Meiji restoration. Some of the first residential buildings designated would be the Yoshimura residence in [[Osaka]] (1937) and the Ogawa residence in [[Kyoto]] (1944).&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p12"/&gt;
In addition, the designation National Treasure was applied not only to objects of art but to historical buildings as well.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jokilehto-p280"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p13"/&gt; The new law also required permissions for intended alterations of designated properties.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p12"/&gt;

Starting with the restoration of [[Tōdai-ji]]'s Nandaimon gate in 1930, the standards for preservation works were raised. An architect supervised the reconstruction works on-site and extensive restoration reports, including plans, results of surveys, historical sources and documentation of the work done, became the norm.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p12"/&gt; During the 1930s about 70–75 percent of restoration costs came from the national budget, which increased even during the war.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p12"/&gt;

===1933 Law Regarding the Preservation of Important Works of Fine Arts===
In the early 1930s Japan suffered from the [[Great Depression]]. In order to prevent art objects that had not been designated from being exported due to the economic crisis, the {{nihongo|Law Regarding the Preservation of Important Works of Fine Arts|重要美術品等ノ保存ニ関スル法律|jūyō bijutsuhin tōno hozon ni kan suru hōritsu}} was passed on April 1, 1933. It provided for a simpler designation procedure and a temporary protection including export. Under this law, about 8000 objects were protected, including temples, shrines and residential buildings.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p12"/&gt; By 1939, 8282 items in nine categories (painting, sculpture, architecture, documents, books, calligraphy, swords, crafts and archaeological resources) had been designated National Treasures and were forbidden to be exported.&lt;ref name="missiontopreserve"/&gt;

During [[World War II]] many of the designated buildings were camouflaged, and water tanks and fire walls installed for their protection. 206 designated buildings, including [[Hiroshima Castle]], were destroyed from May to August 1945.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p12"/&gt; The 9th century [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist text]] ''[[Tōdaiji Fujumonkō]]'', designated as National Treasure in 1938, was destroyed in 1945 by fire as a result of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshida|2001|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present 1950 Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties===

On January 26, 1949, the ''[[kon-dō]]'' of [[Hōryū-ji]], one of the oldest extant wooden buildings in the world and the first to be protected under the "Ancient Temples and Shrines Preservation Law", caught fire, resulting in the serious damage of valuable 7th century wall paintings. This incident accelerated the reorganisation of cultural property protection and gave rise to the {{nihongo|Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties|文化財保護法|bunkazai hogohō}} which was drafted on May 30, 1950 and came into force on August 29 of the same year.&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pamphlet05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gibbon-p332"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gibbon|2005|p=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Enders|Gutschow|1998|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The new law combined the laws of 1919, 1929 and 1933, expanding their scope to cover also Intangible Cultural Properties, such as performing and applied arts, Folk Cultural Properties and Buried Cultural Properties.&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p13"/&gt; Before the enactment of the law, only Intangible Cultural Properties of especially high value at risk of extinction had been protected.&lt;ref name="pamphlet05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jokilehto-p280"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p13"/&gt; Even by international standards, the 1950 law covered a broad spectrum of properties.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p13"/&gt; The law was the basis for the establishment of the Committee for the Protection of Cultural Properties, a precursor of today's [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]].&lt;ref name="mcveigh-p171"/&gt; It allowed the selection of the most important Cultural Properties, set restrictions on the alteration, repair and export of Cultural Properties and provided measures for the preservation and utilization of such properties.&lt;ref name="chapter06" /&gt;

The regulations implementing the law specified three broad categories of properties: Tangible/Intangible Cultural Properties and Historic Sites, Places of Scenic Beauty, Natural Monuments".&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcveigh-p171"&gt;{{Harvnb|McVeigh|2004|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangible Cultural Properties were in this context defined as objects of "high artistic or historic value" or archaeological materials (or other historic material) of "high scholarly value".&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p13"/&gt; Designated buildings were required to be outstanding in design or building technique, have a high historic or scholarly value or be typical of a movement or area.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p13"/&gt;

A two tier system for Tangible Cultural Properties was established with the gradings: ''Important Cultural Property'' and ''National Treasure''.&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p13"/&gt; The Minister of Education can designate Important Cultural Properties as National Treasures if they are of "particularly high value from the standpoint of world culture or outstanding treasures for the Japanese people".&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p13"/&gt; All previously designated National Treasures were initially demoted to Important Cultural Properties. Some of them have been again designated as National Treasures since June 9, 1951.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p13"/&gt; Following a decision by the National Diet, properties to be nominated as [[World Heritage Site]] are required to be protected under the 1950 law.&lt;ref name="policy"&gt;{{cite web

===1954 amendment===
With the 1954 amendment, the three categories were reorganized into four: Tangible Cultural Properties, Intangible Cultural Properties, Folk Materials (split off from the former Tangible Cultural Properties category), and Monuments (new name for the former Historic Sites, Places of Scenic beauty, Natural Monuments" category).&lt;ref name="gibbon-p332"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcveigh-p171"/&gt; Buried Cultural Properties were introduced as a new category, separate from Tangible Cultural Properties.&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt; In addition, a designation system was established for Important Intangible Cultural Properties and Important Tangible Folk Properties.&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt;

===1966 Law for the Preservation of Ancient Capitals===
Particularly in the 1960s, the spectrum of protected buildings was expanded to include early examples of western architecture.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p13"/&gt; Around the same time, concepts for conserving the [[built environment]] were developed.&lt;ref name="policy"/&gt; With the ''Law for the Preservation of Ancient Capitals'' from 1966, the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] could designate Preservation Districts for Historic Landscapes" or Special Preservation Districts, where the former needed only notification in case of alterations, while the latter required approval. This law was restricted to the ancient capitals of [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]], [[Heijō-kyō]] ([[Nara, Nara|Nara]]), [[Heian-kyō]] ([[Kyoto]]), [[Asuka, Yamato]] (present day [[Asuka, Nara]]), [[Fujiwara-kyō]] ([[Kashihara, Nara|Kashihara]]), [[Tenri, Nara|Tenri]], [[Sakurai, Nara|Sakurai]] and [[Ikaruga, Nara|Ikaruga]], places with a large number of National Treasures.&lt;ref name="machizukuri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="machizukuri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="policy"/&gt;

In 1968 the planning authority was decentralized and power transferred to local governments.&lt;ref name="machizukuri"/&gt; The [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] was formed as a merger of the Cultural Bureau of the Ministry of Education and the Cultural Properties Protection Commission. At the same time was established the Council for the Protection of Cultural Properties.&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chapter01"&gt;{{cite web

===1975 amendments: ''Preservation District for a Group of Historic Buildings'' and ''Techniques for the conservation of cultural properties''===
[[File:Water container BronzeGilt former Horyuji.JPG|thumb|Bronze water container, formerly property of [[Hōryū-ji]]]]The year 1975 saw two important extensions to the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties. The Ancient Capital law was extended to include cities not formerly capitals and two new designations, Preservation District for a Group of Historic Buildings and Important Preservation District for a Group of Historic Buildings, were created for especially important districts.&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jokilehto-p280"/&gt;&lt;ref name="policy"/&gt; As of January 16, 2010, there are 86 preservation districts, many of which are located in remote regions.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p15"&gt;{{Harvnb|Enders|Gutschow|1998|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a second major change of 1975, the government started to protect not only Tangible or Intangible Cultural Properties, but also Techniques for the Conservation of Cultural properties.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p14"/&gt; This step was made necessary by the disappearance of skilled craftsmen as a result of  industrialization.

===1996 amendment: ''Registered Cultural Properties''===
The two-tier system of National Treasures and Important Cultural Properties was supplemented with a new class of Registered Cultural Properties meant for items in great need of preservation and use, initially limited to buildings and acting as a waiting list for the list of designated Important Cultural Properties.&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt; A large number of mainly industrial and historic residential from the late [[Edo period|Edo]] to the [[Shōwa period]] were registered under this system.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p15"/&gt;

===1999 and 2004 amendments===
[[File:State Guest-House Akasaka Palace, Main Entrance-1.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A large palace built of white stone in neo-baroque style. The [[facade]] is adorned with columns.|The [[Akasaka Palace]] is the only National Treasure in the category of modern residences ([[Meiji period]] and later).]]
Since the end of the 20th century, the Agency for Cultural Affairs has been focusing on the designation of structures built between 1868 and 1930 or in underrepresented regions.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p13"/&gt; The agency realized the insufficient supply of raw materials and tools necessary for restoration works.&lt;ref name="enders-gutschow-p14"/&gt; In 1999 the protective authority was transferred to prefectures and designated cities. With the 2004 amendment, a system for Important Cultural Landscapes was established and Folk Techniques were added to the definition of Folk Cultural Properties. Registered Cultural Properties was extended to include works of fine arts and crafts, Tangible Cultural Properties and Tangible Folk Cultural Properties.&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt;

'''Curmsun Disc''' is a concave gold disc of a weight of {{convert|25.23|g|oz}} and a diameter of {{convert|4.5|cm|in}}. The Danish [[Viking]] king [[Harald Bluetooth]] is mentioned in the inscription of the disc. The disc´s characteristics are typical of [[Ottonian Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/9647410/A_unique_object_from_Harald_Bluetooth_s_time._2015_ Rosborn, S. (2015) ''A unique object from Harald Bluetooth´s time?'' Malmö: Pilemedia, pp. 4-5]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Curmsun'' represents the king's [[patronymic]] (son of [[Gorm the Old]]); in standardized [[Old Norse]], {{lang|non|Gormsson}}.

==Origin==
The Curmsun disc was reportedly found as part of a Viking Age hoard discovered in 1841 in the cellar crypt of the ruined church at [[Wiejkowo|Groß- Weckow]] village in [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Pomerania]] (now part of [[Gmina Wolin]], [[Poland]]).  This location is just east of the bank of the river [[Dziwna|Dievenow]] and near the place where the semi-legendary Viking stronghold of [[Jomsborg]] stood between the 960's and 1043. 

The entrance to the crypt was accidentally discovered by 12 year old (according to Swedish archaeologist [[Sven Rosborn]]) Heinrich Boldt who was playing with some younger children at a construction site near the ruined chapel.  Heinrich immigrated to the United States at the age of 16 and changed his first name to Henry. He is the maternal great-great-grandfather of Hollywood actors and producers [[Ben Affleck]] and [[Casey Affleck]]. 

After the original discovery the hoard was left in the crypt until 1945 when a Polish army major, Stefan Sielski, and his brother Michal, entered and seized what was left of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecurmsundisc.com/the-story/ The Curmsun Disc website – The Story]&lt;/ref&gt; The disc did not appear to be made of gold so it was placed in a box with old buttons. In 2014, Michal Sielski's 11 year old great-granddaughter showed the disc to her history teacher and it was reported in the press on 5 December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceinpoland.pap.pl/en/news/news,402921,polish-family-treasure-an-archaeological-sensation-in-sweden.html Zyśk, Daniel ''Polish Press Agency'', Science and Scholarship, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Interpretation==
[[File:The Curmsun Disc - Reverse.png|thumb|The Curmsun Disc - Reverse]]
Researchers have interpreted the inscription on the obverse as: "+ARALD CVRMSVN+
REX AD TANER+SCON+JVMN+CIV ALDIN+".

CVRMSVN is a transliteration from spoken Old Norse via runes into the Medieval Latin alphabet.

Old norse word in Latin Alphabet:    	G O R M S O N

Written in runes (Younger Futhark):  	ᚴ ᚢ ᚱ ᛘ ᛋ ᚢ ᚾ

Transliterated to Latin alphabet:    	C V R M S V N	

The same phenomenon could be seen in some coins from York in the tenth century where king is transliterated as CVNVNC but translated as KONUNGR (in English: KONUNGR). Old Norse in coin inscriptions ended after the tenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/29233334/The_Curmsun_Disc_-_Harald_Bluetooth_s_Golden_Seal/ Weman, P. (2016) ''The Curmsun Disc - Harald Bluetooth´s Golden Seal?'' Academia.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

A full translation of the inscription reads: "Harald Gormson king of Danes, Scania, Jomsborg, town Aldinburg ([[Oldenburg in Holstein]])".

On the reverse there is an octagonal ridge, which runs around the edge of the object. In the centre of the [[octagon]]al ridge there is a [[Christian cross variants#Basic forms|Latin cross]]. There are four dots around the Latin cross. Similar dot markings are common on coins, even on coins from the late 900s. The four dots could possibly symbolize the four evangelists, whose symbols in the Middle Ages had strong associations with the Christ symbolism of the cross.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/9647410/A_unique_object_from_Harald_Bluetooth_s_time._2015_ Rosborn, S. (2015) ''A unique object from Harald Bluetooth´s time?'' Malmö: Pilemedia, pp. 4-5]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating theories==

===Around 960s - Harald Bluetooth's second marriage===
Danish anthropologist, Karen Schousboe, believes that the Curmsun Disc could have been a wedding gift during Harald Bluetooth's second marriage, created in the 960s. K. Schousboe also sees a connection to 10th-12th century Byzantine talismans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medievalhistories.com/harold-bluetooths-talisman-sensational-find-fake/ Schousboe, K. (2014) ''Harold Bluetooth’s Talisman – A Sensational Find? Or Fake?'' Medieval Stories]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Around 985 - Harald Bluetooth's golden seal===
Pontus Weman Tell has a theory that the Curmsun Disc had been ordered as a golden seal by Theophanu to confirm or reinstall Harald Bluetooth on the throne. Through a philological analysis he concludes that the disc has most likely been produced before the introduction of the g-rune as Gormson is transliterated as CVRMSVN and not as GVRMSVN. Furthermore, the use of Old Norse like the word Taner on the Curmsun Disc ends in coin inscriptions in the beginning of the 11th century which strengthens a manufacturing date before 1000. Empress Theophanu who officially took over regency in the Holy Roman Empire in 985 could have ordered the Curmsun Disc as a decree to confirm or reinstall Harald on the throne to safeguard her minor son´s interest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/29233334/The_Curmsun_Disc_-_Harald_Bluetooth_s_Golden_Seal/ Weman, P. (2016) ''The Curmsun Disc - Harald Bluetooth´s Golden Seal?'' Academia.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tell also points out the significance of the [[octagon]] surrounding the Latin cross on the disc. According to him, octagon had special importance in the context of the Carolingian kingdom of [[Charlemagne]] the Great. Specifically, the Carolingian [[Palatine Chapel, Aachen|Octagon chapel in Aachen]] was commissioned even before Charlemagne became the first Holy Roman Emperor. Thus, the octagonal shape of the disc seems to indicate its historical connection with the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

===Around 986 - Harald Bluetooth's death===
According to a theory by Swedish archeologist Sven Rosborn the latin the inscription on the obverse of the Curmsun Disc may have been created by a [[Franks|Frankish]] monk in connection with Harald Bluetooth´s death around 986.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/9647410/A_unique_object_from_Harald_Bluetooth_s_time._2015_ Rosborn, S. (2014) ''A unique object from Harald Bluetooth´s time?'' Malmö: Pilemedia, pp. 10-11]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosborn points out that [[Adam of Bremen]], the only historical source commenting on the death of Harald, says that Harald died in Jumne (Jomsborg) from his wounds. Yet, as Rosborn explains, Jumne probably didn’t have a Christian church, so Harald’s body may have been buried, at least temporarily, in the nearest church located at Wiejkowo. Thus, the disc may have been placed near the burial.

According to Rosborn,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"With the language use that was current at the time of Harald’s life, the inscription CIV + ALDIN should thus be linked with the previous town name [Jumne]. The translation would then be "Jumne in the bishopric Aldinburg". Jumne was after all, according to Adam of Bremen, the place of King Harald's death, so the object’s closing inscription should thus, from a Christian point of view, pinpoint where Jumne was located."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/9647410/A_unique_object_from_Harald_Bluetooth_s_time._2015_ Rosborn, S. (2014) ''A unique object from Harald Bluetooth´s time?'' Malmö: Pilemedia, pp. 10-11]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Around 1100 – Harald Bluetooth canonized?===
According to a theory in an article in the magazine Siden Saxo (published by [[Danish State Archives]]) written by Danish archivist Steffen Harpsøe the disc may have been created  by local priests around [[Jomsborg]] and [[Wiejkowo]] between 1050-1125. There is a possibility that the missionaries in the area canonized [[Harald Bluetooth]] and made the Curmsun Disc as a symbolic ornament. S. Harpsøe sees a connection between the Curmsun Disc and Byzantine seals and coins where the inscription are made in horizontal lines and the form could be concave.&lt;ref&gt;Harpsøe, S. (2015), ''Haraldsguldet – en mystisk guldskive fra fortiden'', Siden Saxo No. 4 - 2015, Odense: Syddansk Universitetsforlag, {{ISSN|0109-6028}}, pp. 25-27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authenticity==

===Metallurgical analysis===
The Curmsun Disc underwent electron microscopic analysis at [[Lunds University]] in [[Sweden]]. The analysis showed a non-homogeneous alloy with a gold content ranging between 83.3-92.8%. The surface and alloy showed characteristics typical for artefacts created during the latest part of early middle ages. No traces of modern processes or chemicals were discovered. Surface analysis by a gemologist, Jonny Westling,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westlingvardering.se Jonny Westling (2015) ''Westling Värdering AB'']&lt;/ref&gt; appointed by Swedish Chamber of Commerce and Lloyds/Brookfield Underwriting, showed natural inclusions and patination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecurmsundisc.com/authenticity/metallurgical-analysis/ The Curmsun Disc website – Metallurgical Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reference objects===
The find consists of five objects today: a silver coin from Otto I's reign, a bracelet in bronze with a dash decoration covering the surface, a fragment of another bronze bracelet, a small stamped piece of gold and the Curmsun Disc itself.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/9647410/A_unique_object_from_Harald_Bluetooth_s_time._2015_ Rosborn, S. (2014) ''A unique object from Harald Bluetooth´s time?'' Malmö: Pilemedia, p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibition ==
The Curmsun disc is owned by an undisclosed company and deposited at a bank vault in Sweden. The disc's insured value is USD 3.5 million and the valuation has been performed by Jonny Westling, an expert appointed by Swedish Chamber of Commerce and Lloyds/Brookfield Underwriting. It is now expected that the disc will be handed over to a museum or to a private collector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecurmsundisc.com/category/news/ The Curmsun Disc website – News]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Barton''' (born January 28, 1954) is an [[evangelical]] [[Christian]] [[political activist]] and [[author]]. He is the founder of WallBuilders, LLC, a [[Texas]]-based organization that promotes unorthodox views about the religious basis of the United States. 

He has been described as a [[Christian nationalism|Christian nationalist]] and "one of the foremost Christian revisionist historians"; much of his work is devoted to advancing the idea that the United States was founded as an explicitly Christian nation and rejecting the consensus view that the [[United States Constitution]] calls for [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name="Blakeslee" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kwsqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BtMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=wallbuilders%20barton&amp;pg=5837%2C1813659 |title=First Amendment specialist views church/state separation as "myth" |publisher=Daytona Beach Sunday News-Journal |author=Billy Bruce |date=1992-02-18 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcriptNOW217_full.html |title=NOW: God's Country |publisher=PBS |date=2006-04-28 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michelle-goldberg/what-is-christian-nationa_b_20989.html What is Christian Nationalism?], [[Michelle Goldberg]], [[Salon.com]], May 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars of history and law have described his research as highly flawed, "pseudoscholarship" and spreading "outright falsehoods".&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Specter" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==="Unconfirmed Quotations"===
In 1995, in response to criticism by historian Robert Alley, Barton conceded, in an online article titled "Unconfirmed Quotations",&lt;ref name="Blakeslee" /&gt; that he had not located [[primary sources]] for 11 alleged quotes from [[James Madison]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decisions (hence, the title of the article), but maintained that the quotes were "completely consistent" with the views of the Founders. (By 2007, the article listed 14 unconfirmed quotations.)&lt;ref name="uq"&gt;{{cite web| title = Unconfirmed Quotations | last = Barton | first = David |url = http://www.wallbuilders.com/LIBissuesArticles.asp?id=126 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928060639/http://www.wallbuilders.com/LIBissuesArticles.asp?id=126|archivedate=September 28, 2007| work = WallBuilders website}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Rob Boston of [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] accused Barton of "shoddy workmanship", and said that despite these and other corrections, Barton's work "remains rife with distortions of history and court rulings".&lt;ref name=shoddy&gt;{{Cite journal| journal = Church &amp; State | volume = 49 | number = 7 |date=July–August 1996 | publisher = Americans United for Separation of Church and State | pages = 11–13 | title = Consumer Alert: Wallbuilders Shoddy Workmanship |url=http://candst.tripod.com/boston2.htm | accessdate = April 9, 2013 |first=Rob|last=Boston |authorlink=Rob Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; WallBuilders responded to its critics by saying that Barton followed "common practice in the academic community" in citing secondary sources, and that in publishing "Unconfirmed Quotations", Barton's intent was to raise the academic bar in historical debates pertinent to public policy.&lt;ref name="uq" /&gt;

In 2006, Barton told the ''[[Texas Monthly]]'', with regard to Jefferson's famous [[letter to Danbury Baptists|letter to the Danbury Baptists]], that he had never misquoted the letter in any of his publications. The magazine noted that this denial was contradicted by a 1990 version of Barton's video ''America's Godly Heritage'', in which Barton said:&lt;ref name=Blakeslee/&gt;
{{quote|On January 1, 1802, Jefferson wrote to that group of Danbury Baptists, and in this letter, he assured them—he said the First Amendment has erected a wall of separation between church and state, he said, but that wall is a one-directional wall. It keeps the government from running the church, but it makes sure that Christian principles will always stay in government.}}

'''Donald Alexander Mackenzie''' (24 July 1873 &amp;ndash; 2 March 1936) was a Scottish [[journalist]] and [[folklorist]] and a prolific writer on [[religion]], [[mythology]] and [[anthropology]] in the early 20th century.

==Life and career==

Mackenzie was born in [[Cromartyshire|Cromarty]], son of A.H. Mackenzie and Isobel Mackay.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ambaile.org/en/literary-landscapes/intermediate.jsp?LiteraryLandscapeID=93{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a journalist in [[Glasgow]] and in 1903 moved to Dingwall as owner and editor of ''The North Star''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ambaile.org/en/literary-landscapes/intermediate.jsp?LiteraryLandscapeID=93{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His next move, in 1910, was to the ''People's Journal'' in [[Dundee]]. From 1916 he represented the Glasgow paper, ''The Bulletin'', in [[Edinburgh]]. As well as writing books, articles and poems, he often gave lectures, and also broadcast talks on [[Celtic mythology]]. He was the friend of many specialist authorities in his areas of interest.  His older brother was [[William Mackay Mackenzie]], Secretary of the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland between 1913 and 1935. He died in Edinburgh on 2 March 1936 and was buried in Cromarty.

==Theories==

===Neolithic matriarchy===

In one of his key works, ''Myths of Crete and Pre-Hellenic Europe'' (1917), Mackenzie argued that across Europe during [[Neolithic]] times, pre-Indo-European societies were matriarchal and woman-centered ([[gynocentrism|gynocentric]]), where goddesses were venerated but that the [[Bronze Age]] Indo-European patriarchal ("androcratic") culture supplanted it. Mackenzie's matristic theories were notably influential to [[Marija Gimbutas]].&lt;ref&gt;"The gods and goddesses of Old Europe: 7000 to 3500 BC myths, legends and cult images" , University of California Press, 1974, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; He also believed that the Neolithic matriarchy was as far north as Scotland, writing an article in the ''Celtic Review'' called "A Highland Goddess" attempting to trace the very early presence of goddess worship.&lt;ref&gt;A Highland Goddess, Donald A. Mackenzie, ''The Celtic Review'', Vol. 7, No. 28, Jan., 1912, pp. 336–345.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist diffusionism===

Mackenzie was a [[Trans-cultural diffusion|diffusionist]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'', Vol. 46, Part 1, 1926, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed specifically that [[Buddhists]] colonised the globe in ancient antiquity and were responsible for spreading the [[swastika]]. In his ''Buddhism in Pre-Christian Britain'' (1928) he developed the theory that Buddhists were in Britain and Scandinavia long before the spread of Christianity. His main evidence can be summarised as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Review: ''Buddhism in Pre-Christian Britain'' by Vergilius Ferm, International Journal of Ethics Vol. 39, No. 3, April 1929, pp. 357–358.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Gundestrup bowl]] "on which the Celtic god, Cernunnos, is postured like a typical Buddha".
*Gaulish coins with seated figures like Buddha.
*The testimony of [[Asoka]], who launched Buddhist activities into Europe.
*[[Origen]]'s statement of Buddhist doctrines in ancient Britain.

The work received a mixed reception. Professor of Philosophy [[Vergilius Ferm]] reviewed the work positively, but other scholars criticised it for its lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Ferm, 1929, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harold H. Bender, ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Vol. 33, No. 3, Jul. - Sep., 1929, p. 457.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial origin of British===

In 1922, Mackenzie published ''Ancient Man in Britain'', a work covering the history of Britain from [[Upper Paleolithic]] times, from a strong ethnological basis. The foreword of the book was written by [[Grafton Elliot Smith]]. The work covers the earliest settlement of Britain by the first [[anatomically modern humans|modern humans]] from around 35,000 years ago during the [[Aurignacian]] (pp.&amp;nbsp;19–27). In the book, Mackenzie maintains that the [[Caucasoid]] [[Cro-Magnon]]s who settled in Britain were dark haired and dark eyed, racially akin to the French [[Basques]], [[Iberians]] and [[Berbers]] of North Africa (p.&amp;nbsp;25), who he theorised were one of the earliest representatives of the [[Mediterranean race]]. This indigenous proto-Mediterranean racial stock was later invaded by another "variety of the Mediterranean race" who initiated the [[Solutrean]] culture around 20,000 years ago (p.&amp;nbsp;50). According to Mackenzie, the Aurignacian and Solutrean peoples of Britain traded in shells with Cro-Magnons of France. They later intermingled with later arriving [[Caucasoid]] racial types, including the proto-[[Alpine race|Alpines]] (Furfooz race), who were brachycelphalic (broad-skulled) and a [[Sami people|Lappid]] race, who had minor Eskimo phenotypic traits. Mackenzie also believed that there was a highly depigmentated racial type in small numbers in Britain during the [[Magdalenian]], perhaps who were also blonde, who intermingled with the "dark Iberians" (p.&amp;nbsp;60). During the [[Neolithic]], Mackenzie believed that the predominant racial type of Britain continued to be [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranoid]]: "The carriers of Neolithic culture were in the main Iberians of Mediterranean racial type" (p.&amp;nbsp;126) who traded in pearls and ores. Regarding [[Bronze Age Britain]], Mackenzie devoted several chapters supporting his theory that traders and "prospectors" (miners) arrived in Britain c. 2500 BC, originally from the Eastern Mediterranean (pp.&amp;nbsp;98–101). This theory was initially developed by Harold Peake, who coined the term "Prospector Theory". In the scientific literature of [[Carleton S. Coon]] (1939), the theory was revived, and the Mediterraneans who colonised Britain during the late Neolithic or Bronze Age were associated with the [[Medway megaliths]] (or long-barrow Megalithic culture). [[Joseph Deniker]] earlier called these colonists "Atlanto-Mediterranean". Mackenzie believed that these Mediterraneans who colonised parts of Britain survived well into later historic periods (p.&amp;nbsp;118) and that the [[Mediterranean race]] in general was the bulk racial stock of Britain from Paleolithic through to the Neolithic and to more recent periods. They had black or brown hair, and swarthy skin "like those of the Southern Italians" (p.&amp;nbsp;126) and have survived in numerous pockets of Britain to the modern day (p.&amp;nbsp;139) despite that the later Anglo-Saxon and Norse settlement, who were fairer in appearance, Mackenzie believed their genetic input or admixture was very limited but that they subjugated the British imposing a new civilization and culture (p.&amp;nbsp;227).

The '''Dosci''' (Doschi) - were an ancient people dwelling along the [[Palus Maeotis]] in antiquity. 

[[Strabo]] describes them as living among the [[Maeotae]], [[Sindi (people)|Sindi]], [[Dandarii]], [[Toreatae]], [[Agri (Maeotae)|Agri]], [[Arrechi]], [[Tarpetes]], [[Obidiaceni]], [[Sittaceni]], and [[Aspurgiani]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Strab. xi. 2. 11&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dosci (Doschi) is one of the Maeotae tribes, who lived in the 1st millennium BC on the east and south-east coast of the [[Azov sea]].
Russian scientists, archeologists, historians and ethnographers in the Soviet period concluded that Maeotae is one of the names of the tribes of the [[Adyghe people]] ([[Circassians]]). 

In the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'', in the article about the [[Adyghe people]], it says:&lt;ref&gt;[http://gatchina3000.ru/big/002/515_bolshaya-sovetskaya.htm ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia''. Adyghe]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Living in the basin of the river Kuban part of the tribes (Adyg people), as a rule, be indicated (names) of ancient historians under the collective name "Maeotae".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Maeotae  were engaged in farming and fishing. Part of the Maeotae by the language was akin to the Adygs (Circassians), the part of the Iranians. In the 4th–3rd centuries BC, many of Maeotae were included in the [[Bosporan Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://slovari.yandex.ru/~книги/БСЭ/Меоты/ ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia''. Maeotae]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6815">'''Erik-Jan Zürcher''' (born 1953) is a Dutch [[Turkology|Turkologist]]. He is a professor of Turkish studies at [[Leiden University]] since 1997. From 2008 to 2012 he served as director of the [[International Institute of Social History]]. His book ''Turkey: a Modern History'' is considered a standard work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Floris van Straaten |url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2015/08/20/waarom-turkije-de-koerden-aanvalt-1527596-a96055 |title=Waarom Turkije de Koerden aanvalt |publisher=''NRC Handelsblad'' |date= |accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zürcher frequently comments on current issues related to Turkey.

==Career==
Zürcher was born in 1953, the only child of Sinologist [[Erik Zürcher]] (1928–2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Esther Hageman |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4324/Nieuws/article/detail/1246740/2008/02/27/Erik-Zurcher-1928-2008.dhtml |title=Erik Zürcher 1928-2008 |publisher=''[[Trouw]]'' |date=27 February 2008 |accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gruppen&gt;{{cite web|author=Pieternel Gruppen |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4496/Buitenland/article/detail/3838364/2015/01/27/Flirten-met-de-Ottomanen.dhtml |title=Flirten met de Ottomanen |publisher=''Trouw'' |date=27 January 2015 |accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zürcher obtained a BA in Turkish studies from Leiden University in 1974. Three years later he received his MA in Turkish studies, with minors in both modern history and Persian. In 1984 he obtained his PhD in Turkish studies, also from Leiden University.&lt;ref name=leiden&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/erik-jan-zurcher |title=Erik-jan Zurcher |publisher=Leiden University |date= |accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1977 to 1989 Zürcher was an assistant professor of Turkish and Persian at the [[Radboud University Nijmegen]]. He subsequently was employed as associate professor of modern history at the same university until 1997. From 1990 to 1999 he was a senior researcher at the [[International Institute of Social History]]. Between 1993 and 1997 Zürcher was an affiliate professor of social history of the Middle East at the [[University of Amsterdam]]. In that latter year he was appointed as full professor of Turkish studies at Leiden University.&lt;ref name=leiden/&gt;

Zürcher was director of the [[International Institute of Social History]] between April 2008 and November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://socialhistory.org/en/news/erik-jan-zurcher-resigns-iish-director |title=Erik-Jan Zürcher Resigns as IISH Director |publisher=International Institute of Social History |date=23 October 2012 |accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and distinctions==
In 2005, Zürcher received the Distinguished Service Award of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.tr/disisleri-bakanligi-ustun-hizmet-plaketi-ile-devlet-nisan-ve-madalyalarinin-verilmesi-.tr.mfa |title=Dışişleri Bakanlığı Üstün Hizmet Ödülü ile Devlet Nişan ve Madalyaları|accessdate=20 December 2016|language=Turkish|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his work in informing the Dutch political scene and general public on Turkey. The award was presented to him by foreign minister [[Abdullah Gül]]. In May 2016 he returned the award, citing "dictatorial misgovernment" by the government under [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/05/09/erik-jan-zurcher-hoogleraar-geeft-turkse-ondersche-1617705-a636680 |title=Hoogleraar geeft Turkse onderscheiding terug vanwege ‘dictatoriaal wanbeleid’ |publisher=''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'' |date=9 May 2016 |accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Zürcher was elected a member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/members/5065 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723201743/https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/members/5065 |title=Erik-Jan Zürcher |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |archive-date=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
Zürcher has noted a tendency in Turkish government circles to refer nostalgically to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. According to him, this is in line with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's depicting of a powerful Turkey in the future, linked to a glorious empire in the past.&lt;ref name=gruppen/&gt;

Zürcher previously pleaded for [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]]. In 2012, he noted that the perspective of accession was lost politically in both Turkey and the European Union.&lt;ref name="BoogertRoelants2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maurits van den Boogert|author2=Jan Jonker Roelants|title=De Nederlands-Turkse betrekkingen: Portretten van een vierhonderdjarige geschiedenis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kb3SAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA96|year=2012|publisher=Uitgeverij Verloren|isbn=978-90-8704-292-9|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, he noted that his previously expected advancement in democratic standards and ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'' did not materialize, and that Turkey therefore cannot and should not become a member of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/05/10/hier-heb-je-mijn-turkse-medaille-terug-erdogan-1617690-a1272023 |title=Hier heb je mijn Turkse medaille terug, Erdogan |publisher=''NRC Handelsblad'' |date=10 May 2016 |accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reacting shortly after the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt]], Zürcher stated that he deemed it "highly unlikely" that the [[Gülen movement]] was behind it. He added that the coup attempt would lead to Turkish president Erdoğan using the event to get rid of opponents, citing the example of [[2016 Turkish purges|arrest warrants for nearly 3000 judges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://nos.nl/artikel/2118021-gulen-beweging-achter-turkse-coup-zeer-onwaarschijnlijk.html |title=Gülen-beweging achter Turkse coup?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17459">'''Francesco Maria Appendini''' (November 4, 1768 – 1837) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Latin]] and Italian scholar who studied Slavic languages in the [[Republic of Ragusa]]. The French invasion prevented him from returning to Italy, and he adopted Republic of Ragusa as his own country. He took it upon himself to investigate its history and antiquities.

==Early life==
Appendini was born at [[Poirino]], near [[Turin]], in 1768.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/APO_ARN/APPENDINI_FRANCESCO_MARIA_1768_.html Online Encyclopedia] Articles from the original, classic Encyclopedia [[Britannica]], 11th Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Poirino was then part of the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]]. He received his early education in his native country, after which he went to [[Rome]], where he entered the order of the Scolopj or Scholarum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=u8spAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA56&amp;lpg=PA56 Report on the statistics of Tuscany, Lucca, the Pontifical, and the Lombardo-Venetian States] by Sir John Bowring, Foreign Office of [[Great Britain]].&lt;/ref&gt; The order (Christian Brotherhood) devoted itself to the education of students working as teachers in the colleges and schools of [[Italy]] and neighbouring countries.

Having done his [[theological]] studies, Appendini moved to [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa (Dubrovnik)]], where he was appointed a professor of rhetoric in the college of the Scolopj.

==Literary works==

After several years of consulting the old documents and chronicles and the traditions of the region. He published in 1803, his ''"Notizie Istorico-Critiche Sulla Antichita, Storia, e Letteratura de' Ragusei"'' (published in two vols.) &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PwwZAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Francesco+Maria+Appendini&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4WtkWgqJQw&amp;sig=7E-7NwXZu3JHwTfqsAHIDmUihZA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3U5kS_2XO43k7APdreAU&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CA8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Notizie Istorico-Critiche Sulla Antichita, Storia, e Letteratura de' Ragusei. Volume 2] by Francesco Maria Appendini&lt;/ref&gt; which is dedicated to the senate. It is considered by some &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tKADAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA187 The Biographical Dictionary of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge] Volume 3, Part 1. 1843. Great Britain&lt;/ref&gt; to be his best work on the ''Republic of Ragusa'' which was for centuries like an advanced post of civilisation and which maintained its independence against the neighbouring Slavs, [[Ottomans]] and the [[Republic of Venice]]. Its flag was respected all over the [[Mediterranean]], and the Republic preserved the regions traditions and cultivated the arts of Europe. It was situated on a narrow strip of land in Southern Dalmatia, now in modern [[Croatia]]. Its disappearance from the list of independent states was hardly noticed in the midst of the revolutionary events which had swept away most of the old republics of [[Europe]].

In Appendini's first work he also investigates the history and antiquities of the [[Epidaurum]] or Epidaurus, the parent of Ragusa, which was destroyed by the [[Slavs]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=l6JnAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=croatian+history&amp;q=slavs#search_anchor A History of the Croatian] by Francis Ralph.

Contributions to the Modern History of Hungary and Transylvania, [[Dalmatia]] and [[Croatia]], Servia and Bulgaria-Brockhaus Chapter 9. page 218&lt;/ref&gt; in the 7th century. He enters into discussions concerning the ancient inhabitants of the [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Roman Provence]] of [[Dalmatia]], their language and religion, the migrations of [[Thracians]] and [[Greeks]] to the coast of the [[Adriatic]], and the wars of the [[Illyrians]] with the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4Nv6SPRKqs8C&amp;dq=The+Illyrians&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tohmS9P9C47k7AODx-gi&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwBw#v=snippet&amp;q=%20Illyrians%20rome&amp;f=false The Illyrians] by John Wilkes. page 120, page 158-161. {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}. For more than a thousand years before the arrival of the [[Slavs]] in the sixth century AD, the lands between the [[Adriatic]] and the river [[Danube]] were the home of the peoples known to the ancient world as [[Illyrians]].&lt;/ref&gt; He describes the site of Epidaurum and the extent of its territory, and presents several Roman inscriptions found among its ruins, near [[Cavtat]]. The [[sepulchre]] of P. Cornelius Dolabella, who was consul under [[Augustus]] and governor of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], and the remains of an [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] which were all in the same neighbourhood. Appendini then proceeds to account for the origins of modern Ragusa/Dubrovnik, who were [[refugee]]s from Epidaurum and from [[Salona]].

The maritime part of [[Dalmatia]] continued to be called Roman Dalmatia, and remained subject, to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Dubrovnik, however, governed itself as an aristocratic republic. [[Manuel Comnenus]] in 1170 gave to the city the rights of citizens of [[Constantinople]]. The [[Latin]] language, although modified ([[Dalmatian language]]),&lt;ref&gt;Dalmatian (or Dalmatic) is an extinct Romance language formerly spoken in the Dalmatia region of Croatia, and as far south as Kotor in Montenegro.&lt;/ref&gt; continued to be spoken in Dubrovnik till the 13th century, when it was gradually superseded by the [[Slavs]]. The senate however decreed that the Latin should continue to be the language of administration, and in order to keep on the study of it, they created and instituted a chair of Latin. There it is described in separate chapters, its form of government, its church (attached to the Latin communion), its laws, customs, its relations with the [[Republic of Venice]] and with the Slavic principalities of [[Croatia]] and Bosnia, its policy towards the Ottomans and its [[commerce]].

The merchant navy of Republic of Ragusa engaged in of the trade between the [[Levant]] and the ports of Europe. They traded also with [[Spain]] and with [[England]]. The name of [[wiktionary:argosy|Argosies]] given by writers of the middle ages to large vessels that carried rich cargoes, which were from Dubrovnik. In the sixteenth century the Ragusan's had three hundred vessels in the Spanish navy. These vessels were lost in the expeditions of [[Tunis]], [[Algiers]] and others, under Charles V. and Philip II. These losses and the [[1667 Dubrovnik earthquake|earthquake of 1667]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vwK4jhvjHQkC&amp;pg=PA86 Earthquake Monitoring and Seismic Hazard Mitigation in Balkan Countries] by Eystein Sverre Husebye&lt;/ref&gt; which destroyed the greater part of Dubrovnik, were the causes of the decay of its maritime trade, which however recovered to a certain extent during the eighteenth century.

==Second volume of Appendini's work==

The second volume of Appendini's work looks at the literature of Republic of Ragusa. The author gives attention to the local writers who have written in Italian (or Latin), and those who have written in the vernacular Slavic-[[Croatian language|Croatian]].

Among the historians are:
* Meletius, who wrote in the 12th century in Latin verse concerning the history of Epidaurum and of Ragusa.
* Ludovico Cerva or Cervano, surnamed Tuberone, who wrote on the history of the Turks, ''"De Turcarum Origine, Moribus et Rebus gestis Commentarius"'',   [[Florence]] 1590.
* Matthias Flaccus Illyricus,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/209212/Matthias-Flacius-Illyricus Matthias Flaccus Illyricus] Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; who went to [[Germany]], and become a [[Lutheran]]. He was one of the main compilers of the ''"Centuriae Magdeburgensis"'  &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4rhCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA524 Catalogue of the New York State Library]: January 1, 1850 by New York State Library-USA&lt;/ref&gt;
* Luccari, who wrote in Italian the Annals of Ragusa till the end of the 16th century.
* Mauro Orbini,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KhMDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA594&amp;dq=Mauro+Orbini+History&amp;client=safari&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=Mauro%20Orbini&amp;f=false Bibliotheca Grenvilliana, Part 2] by British Museum. Dept. of Printed Books. Grenville Library, John Thomas Payne, Thomas Grenville, Henry Foss, William Brenchley Rye.&lt;/ref&gt; author of a history of the Slavic principalities established in Roman Dalmatia  and other parts of Europe during the [[middle ages]].
* Eusebio Caboga, who wrote in Latin the ''"Annals of Republic of Ragusa'''' and the lives of its bishops.
* Giunio Resti, who wrote history of the Republic in Italian.
* Benedetto Orsinich, author of a genealogical history of the [[Komnenos dynasty]].
* Anselmo Banduri, the author of the ''" Imperium Orientale"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?lang=en&amp;show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=11276 Anselmo Banduri (1675–1743)]: A Ragusan Benedictine in Paris by Jelena Puskaric/[http://hrcak.srce.hr/ Hrcak-Portal of Scientific Journals of Croatia].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sebastijan Slade|Sebastiano Dolci]], a [[Franciscan]], who wrote'' "De Illyricae Linguae Vetustate et Amplitudine,"'' [[Venice]] 1754 and ''"I Fasti Letterarii- Ragusei,"'' Venice 1767 &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kJcYAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Sebastiano+Dolci&amp;dq=Sebastiano+Dolci&amp;client=safari&amp;cd=9 Fasti litterario-Ragusini] by Sebastiano Dolci&lt;/ref&gt; and also a commentary on the life and works of [[Saint Jerome]], printed at [[Ancona]] in 1750.

Amongst other residence of Dubrovnik were the physician Baglivi; the mathematician [[Roger Joseph Boscovich]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PMvcEPyNMGgC&amp;pg=PA47 Remarkable Physicists: from Galileo to Yukawa] by Ioan Mackenzie James&lt;/ref&gt; several members of the family of Stay (Stojic), Raimondo Cunich, the author of many Latin poems and for a long time a professor in the Gregorian college at Rome; [[Bernardo Zamagna]], who translated into Latin the [[Odyssey]], Hesiod, Theocritus, and Moschus; Cardinal Giovanni Stoiko, who was sent as legate to the council of Basle; Simone Benessa, a jurist, the author of a book on the practice of the courts of Ragusa and [[Benedetto Cotrugli]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9GiGAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Benedetto+Cotrugli&amp;dq=Benedetto+Cotrugli&amp;client=safari&amp;cd=3 Trade, Trust, and Networks]: Commercial Culture in Late Medieval Italy by Gunnar Dahl. The book is based on a study of Italian business letters, diaries and commercial handbooks during the period 1300-1500. It shows the enormous variety of problems and products that faced medieval merchants and how they dealt with them.&lt;/ref&gt; who was employed in several important offices of state, such as the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. He wrote a work on the profession of commerce and the duties of a merchant, ''"[[Della mercatura e del mercante perfetto]]"'' (Book on the Art of Trade),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1gic2_37tjIC&amp;pg=PA109 A History of Accounting and Accountants] by Richard Brown&lt;/ref&gt; published in Venice in 1573.

Lastly, the Second volume gives a list of poets who wrote in the Slavic languages. [[Ivan Gundulić|Ivan Gundulic]] (Giovanni di Francesco Gondola) was amongst them. He also notices several Slavic poets of other parts of [[Dalmatia]] and of Bosnia and [[Montenegro]], their Popevke (ballads). Appendini's book contains one of the most complete views of the Republic as it was before its military occupation by the French in 1806.

==French rule of the Republic of Ragusa==
[[File:Dubrovacka republika.png|thumb|250px|The Republic of Ragusa before 1808]]
After the [[France|French]] had taken military possession of the Republic in 1806 &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e8YJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA378 Dalmatia and Montenegro: Volume 2] by Sir John Gardner  Wilkinson&lt;/ref&gt; and annexed the country to the [[Illyrian Provinces]],&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrian Provinces were created by the Treaty of Schönbrunn in 1809 when the Austrian Empire ceded the territories of western or Upper Carinthia with Lienz in the East Tyrol, Carniola, southwest of the river Sava, Gorizia and Gradisca, and Trieste to the French Empire after the Austrian defeat at the Battle of Wagram.&lt;/ref&gt; which were governed by [[Marmont]], one of [[Napoleon]]'s generals. Appendini prevailed upon the new government to retain the order of the Scolopj, and entrust to it the instruction of youth in the districts of the former Republic and of  [[Kotor]] (Cattaro). He was appointed rector of the new college of Dubrovnik, and sought assistants from Rome.

His own brother, Urbano Appendini, was made professor of [[mathematics]]. In 1808 Appendini published a grammar of the "Illyrian" language, written on the basis of the written [[Shtokavian dialect|Shtokavian]] literature and existing lexicographical works. In 1810 he wrote ''" De Praestantia et Venustate Linguae Illyricae"'' and another on the analogy between the languages of the ancient nations of Asia Minor and the languages of the Thracians and Illyrians. Both these are prefixed to the " Dictionary of the Illyric Language" of Father ''Gioacchino Stulli'' of Ragusa. He also undertook a work entitled " Il Varrone Illirico," on the etymology of the Illyric language, tending to show the derivation of the ancient names of the principal rivers, mountains, and other localities of Europe from Illyric radicals, but he did not live to complete the work. He also wrote biographies of noble men of Kotor (Cattaro).

When the [[Austria]]n government recovered possession of Dalmatia in 1815, and with it of the town and territory of Republic, which had been incorporated with that province by [[Napoleon]], Appendini was commissioned to establish a central institution at [[Zadar]] (Zara), for the purpose of creating teachers for the different educational institutes of the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia|Dalmatia Province]]. He and his brother Urbano set to work but they experienced numerous obstacles to their plan. They went to [[Vienna]] in order to secure the support of the [[Austrian Emperor Francis I]] and his ministers, which they obtained and the school for teachers at Zadar was maintained.

Appendini latter returned to his home in [[Dubrovnik]]. His brother remained at the head of the school in Zadar, where he died in 1834, upon which Appendini returned to Zadar to fill his brother's place. He died of [[apoplexy]] in January, 1837. He was buried with great respect, his funeral being attended by the magistrates and nobility of Zadar. A biographical of him was published in Dubrovnik by one of his former students, the advocate Antonio Casnacich.

Additional works:

* ''Memoria Sulla Vita e gli Scritti di Gio''. Ragusa in 1837. There he gives an appraisal of Ivan Gundulic's &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NMcoAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Osman+Ivan+Gundulic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Lx67qx5ZHW&amp;sig=_Fv54npuGfj1hmGG46ZgVQO6Esc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RCllS425HdGTkAXysa3WCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Osman, Volume 2] by Ivan Gundulic&lt;/ref&gt; epic poem the [[Ivan Gundulić#Osman|Osman]]  the subject of which is the war between Sultan Othman II and the [[Poles]] in 1622, in which the Turks were defeated, soon after which the Sultan was deposed and strangled by the [[Janizaries]], it being the first instance of a [[sultan|Turkish Sultan]] put to death by his subjects.

Appendini work on the history and literature of Republic of Ragusa that gives extracts of the Slavic text of the poem with Italian and Latin versions of the same:
* Translation in Croatian of the [[Austria–Hungary|Austrian]] civil code.
* Several funeral orations and other minor works.
* De Vita et Scriptis Bernards Zamagna. Zara, 1830.
* La Vita el Esame Delle Opere del Petrarca
* Esame Critico Sulla Quistione Intorno alla Patria di S. Girolamo. Zara, 1835.

{{Chinese|title=''History of Liao''|t=遼史|s=辽史|p=Liáo Shǐ|poj=Liâu-sú}}
The '''''History of Liao''''', or '''''Liao Shi''''' ('''''Liáo Shǐ'''''), is a Chinese historical book compiled officially by the [[Mongol]] [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368), under the direction of the historian [[Toqto'a (Yuan dynasty)|Toqto'a]] (Tuotuo), and finalized in 1344.&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.22"&gt;Xu Elina-Qian, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Khitan's primary sources and other previous official Chinese records, it exposes the [[Khitan people]], Khitan's tribal life and traditions, and the [[Liao dynasty]]'s official history.&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.22" /&gt;

== Main sources ==
''History of Liao'' of 1344 was compiled using older sources, mainly: 
* the ''Shilu'' 實錄 (Veritable Records), completed in the Khitan Liao dynasty (907-1125) under Yelü Yan 耶律儼's direction, no longer extant;
* a draft ''Liao Shi'', compiled in the Jurchen [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin dynasty]] under the direction of an official named Chen Daren 陳大任, never published and no longer extant;
* and several other sources such as the [[Zizhi Tongjian]] (1080's), [[Qidan Guo Zhi]] and other descriptions of the Khitans in the previous dynastic histories ([[Wei Shu]], [[Sui Shu]], ...).
The ''Liao Shi'' contains 116 volumes,&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.22" /&gt; including 30 volumes of Imperial Annals, 32 volumes of Records of Institutions, 8 volumes of Tables, 48 volumes of Biographies and Descriptions, and 1 volume of Glossary of National Language 國語解 Guoyijie (the [[Khitan language]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese History: A Manual|first=Endymion Porter|last=Wilkinson|others=|volume=Volume 52 of Harvard Yenching Institute Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard-Yenching Institute monograph series |issue=Issue 52 of Harvard-Yenching Institute monograph series| ISSN =0073-084X|editor-first=|editor-last=|edition=illustrated, revised|date=|year=2000|publisher=Harvard Univ Asia Center|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ERnrQq0bsPYC&amp;pg=PA864&amp;dq=Qinding+Liao+Jin+Yuan+sanshi+guoyujie&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PskPVL60NdLhsATT24Bw&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Qinding%20Liao%20Jin%20Yuan%20sanshi%20guoyujie&amp;f=false|page=864|isbn=0674002490|accessdate=24 April 2014| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;pp. 123-125 Howorth, H. H.. 1881. "The Northern Frontagers of China. Part V. The Khitai or Khitans". Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland 13 (2). Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland: 121–82. https://www.jstor.org/stable/25196875.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YongPeng2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Heming Yong|author2=Jing Peng|title=Chinese Lexicography : A History from 1046 BC to AD 1911: A History from 1046 BC to AD 1911|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYFBtTUZFxEC&amp;pg=PA382#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=14 August 2008|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-156167-2|pages=382–}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a list of Khitan language words [[Transcription into Chinese characters|transcribed in Chinese characters]]. it is found in Chapter 116 - [https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/遼史/卷116 遼史/卷116].

== Creation and reliability ==
Many Chinese scholars of the time argued that the non-[[Han Chinese|Han]], "barbarian" Liao dynasty did not merit its own official history, but rather posited that the Liao histories should be an addendum to the history of the [[Song dynasty|Song]], which was ethnically [[Han Chinese]].&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.22" /&gt; This was part of the larger dispute between the Mongol court and the Chinese literati scholars, in which the Chinese political theory whereby only one dynasty could be deemed legitimate at a time clashed with the Mongol's beliefs to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;Hok-lam Chan, p.73&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this dispute between two different political cultures, the ''Liao Shi'', as well as the histories of the concurrent [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin]] and Song dynasties, was not officially compiled until 1343-1344, when the pro-Chinese Chief Councillor Toqto'a took up the pre-Yuan histories project again. In its final form, this project conceded to the Mongol court's desire to treat the Liao, Jin, and Song as equally legitimate dynasties. The compilation of the ''Liao Shi'' was finished in one year&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.22" /&gt; by imperial historians, although without undergoing any but the most minimal of proofreadings.&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.22" /&gt; Because of this, the ''Liao Shi'' and the other two pre-Yuan histories are known for their technical errors, lack of precision, inconsistencies in transcribing non-Chinese terms and names, and over-lapping subject matter.  Qing scholars [[Qian Daxin]] and Zhao Yi noted inconsistencies in the '''''History of Liao''''' in their works ''Study of the Discrepancies in the Twenty-two Standard Histories'' 廿二史劄記 and ''Critical Notes on the Twenty-two Histories'' 二十二史劄記.{{sfnp|Chan|2014|page=91}}
&lt;!-- Inside --&gt;
Nonetheless, the ''Liao Shi'' provides a large amount of knowledge on Khitan's imperium's tribal politics and traditions. Since Yelü Yan's ''Shilu'' and Chen Daren's ''Liao Shi'' have been lost,&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.22" /&gt; Toqto'a's ''Liao Shi'' is the only extant Chinese-style historical record of the Khitan empire.

== Editions ==
The work of collation and punctuation have been done several times,&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, pp.22-23"&gt;Xu Elina-Qian, pp.22-23&lt;/ref&gt; by example in the Qianlong edition, the Nanjian edition, the Beijian edition, Baina edition and the Daoguang edition.&lt;br /&gt;The nowadays commonly use edition is the Zhonghua Shuju Press edited ''Liao Shi'', under direction of the Khitan studies' specialists [[Feng Jiasheng]] and [[Chen Shu (scholar)|Chen Shu]], and based on the Baina edition. This Zhonghua Shuju Press version and its annotations also refer to other historical sources such as the [[Cefu Yuangui]], [[Zizhi Tongjian]], [[Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian]], [[Jiu Tangshu|Jiu]] &amp; [[Xin Tangshu]], [[Jiu Wudai Shi|Jiu]] &amp; [[Xin Wudai Shi]], [[History of Song|Song Shi]], [[Jin Shi]], [[Qidan Guo Zhi]] and [[Liao Wenhui]].&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, pp.22-23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LS, 1974"&gt;遼史, 脱脱, 中华书局, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

The History of Liao was translated into [[Manchu language|Manchu]] as {{MongolUnicode|ᡩᠠᡳᠯᡳᠶᠣᠣ&lt;br&gt;ᡤᡠᡵᡠᠨ {{zwj}}‍ᡳ&lt;br&gt;ᠰᡠᡩᡠᡵᡳ}} (Wylie: ''Dailiyan gurun i suduri'', [[Transliterations of Manchu|Möllendorff]]: ''Dailiyan gurun i suduri'').

The [[Qing dynasty]] [[Qianlong Emperor]] erroneously identified the Khitan people and their language with the [[Solons]], leading him to use the [[Solon language]] to "correct" Chinese character transcriptions of Khitan names in the History of Liao in his "Imperial Liao Jin Yuan Three Histories National Language Explanation" (欽定遼金元三史國語解 Qinding Liao Jin Yuan sanshi guoyujie) project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Crossley |first= Pamela Kyle |last2= Rawski |first2= Evelyn S. |date= Jun 1993 |title= A Profile of The Manchu Language in Ch'ing History |jstor= 2719468|journal= Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies |publisher= Harvard-Yenching Institute |volume=  53|issue= 1 |page=99 |doi= 10.2307/2719468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qianlong's "corrections" ended up compounding the errors and making the transcription of some foreign words even worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Notices of the Mediæval Geography and History of Central and Western Asia| first=E.|last=Bretschneider|volume=|year=1876|edition=|publisher=Trübner &amp; Company|isbn=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R98-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA6 |pages=5–6 |accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall Broomhall wrote that ''So unscientific was this work that the K'ien-lung editions of the Liao, Kin, and Yüan histories are practically useless.''&lt;ref name="Broomhall1910"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall Broomhall|title=Islam in China: A Neglected Problem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObcNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1910|publisher=Morgan &amp; Scott, Limited|pages=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emil Bretschneider]] demonstrated how the etymologies in the Qianlong edition were incorrect.&lt;ref name="Bretschneider2013 2"&gt;{{cite book|author=E.

==Legacy==
The debate about the legacy of the Liao as a legitimate dynasty continued after the completion of the text. Around the time of publication [[Yang Weizhen]] stated that only the Song was a legitimate dynasty and the Liao and Jin were usurpers. {{sfnp|Chan|2014|page=89}} He continued to argue this point and composed an essay titled 'On legitimate Succession' 正統辯. Ming scholar Wang Zhu 王洙 wrote an alterative history of the Song titled ''Verified History of the Song'' 宋史質 in which the Liao and Jin states were relegated to treatises on foreign states. However, Wang Chu's text received criticism itself from Qing scholars who viewed it as an intentional distortion of history. {{sfnp|Chan|2014|pages=98-100}} In addition, the text ''Great Outline of Historical Records'' by Ming scholar Shao Jingbang 邵經邦 (1491-1561) gave the Liao and Jin the status of alien usurpers.

[[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) was an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling promotion]] that existed from 1988 to 2001. It began as a promotion affiliated with the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) that appeared on the national scene under the ownership of media mogul [[Ted Turner]] and based in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]. The name came from a wrestling television program that aired on [[Turner Broadcasting System|TBS]] in the 1980s, which had taken the name from an [[Australian]] [[World Championship Wrestling (Australia)|wrestling promotion]] of the 1970s.

In the 1990s, World Championship Wrestling, along with the [[WWE#World Wrestling Federation|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF), were the top two wrestling promotions in the [[United States]]. Its flagship show ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' went head-to-head with ''[[WWE Raw|WWF Raw is War]]'' in a ratings battle known as the [[Monday Night Wars]]. However, lackluster [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|storylines]], the increasing popularity of the WWF's [[The Attitude Era|Attitude Era]], interference and restrictions from [[Time Warner]] eventually led to its decline and eventual acquisition of key assets by its main competition, [[Vince McMahon]] and the WWF (now [[WWE]]).

== NWA years (1982–1987)==
Although World Championship Wrestling was a brand name used by promoter [[Jim Barnett (wrestling)|Jim Barnett]] for his Australian promotion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Barnett: King of the Australian - American Connection|url=http://www.mediaman.com.au/profiles/barnett.html|publisher=Media Man|accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first promotion in the [[United States]] to use the World Championship Wrestling brand name (though it was never referred to as "WCW") on a wide scale was [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] (GCW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Television Description and History - Wrestling on Super Station TBS|url=http://www.theglorydays.net/misc/notes/tv_descriptions.htm|publisher=Glory Days |accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; GCW, owned primarily by [[Jack Brisco]] and [[Gerald Brisco]] and [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booked]] by [[Ole Anderson]], was the first NWA territory to gain [[cable television]] access, being broadcast on Channel 17 of [[Ted Turner]]'s [[Superstation TBS]]. The show was broadcast every Saturday evening, from 6:05 PM [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] to 8:05 PM EST&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sex, Lies and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation|date=2002-07-16|last=Assael|first=Shaun|author2=Mooneyham, Mike |publisher=Crown Publishers|isbn=0-609-60690-5|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After founding his own company, Titan Sports Inc. in 1980, in 1982, [[Vince McMahon|Vincent K. McMahon]] purchased his father's [[WWE#Capitol Wrestling Corporation (1952-1963)|Capitol Wrestling Corporation]] (CWC) and merged it into Titan Sports Inc. Under his leadership, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) became the top promotion in North America, and GCW devised the name "World Championship Wrestling" in an effort to compete.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In 1982, GCW changed the name of its television show (and thus its public face) to ''World Championship Wrestling'' since it was already starting to run shows in "neutral" territories such as [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Michigan]]. These efforts helped to keep GCW competitive against the WWF, as both promotions had secured television deals and were trying to become national, as opposed to regional, entities. The change in name helped make GCW the top promotion once again, until the WWF was able to officially leave the NWA and create the show ''[[WWF All American Wrestling]]''. The NWA, led by the President of [[Jim Crockett Promotions#Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling|Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling]], [[Jim Crockett, Jr.]], countered by creating [[Starrcade]] in the fall of [[Starrcade (1983)|1983]], the main event of which featured [[Ric Flair]] defeating [[Harley Race]] in a critically acclaimed [[steel cage match]] to win the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], which he would hold on nine separate occasions. The success of Starrcade would elevate Flair to superstar status; he would become the [[franchise player]] of Jim Crockett Promotions and is largely responsible for the success of JCP during the mid-to-late 1980's. The success of Starrcade would also succeed in propelling the NWA back to the top, but Vince McMahon again regained the lead with [[Hulk Hogan]]'s dramatic world title victory at [[Madison Square Garden]] in January 23, 1984,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/h/hulk-hogan.html|title=Hulk Hogan - Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2007-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the creation of the television show ''[[Tuesday Night Titans]]''.

On April 9, 1984, the Brisco brothers sold their shares in GCW, including their [[prime time]] slot on the [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] cable [[television network]], to Vince McMahon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Assael|first=Shaun |author2=Mooneyham, Mike |title=Sex, Lies and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation|date=2002-07-16|publisher=Crown Publishers|isbn=0-609-60690-5|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, GCW's core audience was not interested in the WWF's gimmick-based approach, preferring a more athletic style. As a result, when GCW's television viewers tuned into TBS on July 14, 1984 and saw WWF programming instead, they were outraged and sent complaints to the network demanding the return of GCW. This day has since gone down in wrestling lore as ''[[Black Saturday (wrestling)|Black Saturday]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John F.|last=Molinaro|title=End of an era on TBS - Solie, Georgia and 'Black Saturday'|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingFeatures/tbs1-can.html|publisher=Slam! Sports|date=2001-04-03|accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding fuel to the fire was the fact that, despite originally promising to produce original programming for the TBS time slot, McMahon chose instead to provide only a [[clip show]] for TBS featuring highlights from other WWF programming, a move which angered network head Ted Turner and was a major factor in his decision to discontinue showing the WWF on his network. Luckily for Turner, Ole Anderson had refused to sell his shares in GCW to the WWF, and he teamed with fellow holdout shareholders Fred Ward and Ralph Freed to create [[Georgia Championship Wrestling|Championship Wrestling from Georgia]]. Turner quickly secured a television deal with the new promotion, as well as with [[Bill Watts]]' [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]] based in [[Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watts |first=Bill |title=Bio of Cowboy Bill Watts |url=http://www.cowboybillwatts.com/about.php |accessdate=2007-04-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009054653/http://www.cowboybillwatts.com/about.php |archivedate=2007-10-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jim Crockett Promotions (1985–1988)===
In March 1985, McMahon sold his TBS time slot and the "World Championship Wrestling" name to [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Assael |first=Shaun|author2=Mooneyham, Mike |title=Sex, Lies and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation|date=2002-07-16|publisher=Crown Publishers|isbn=0-609-60690-5|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; owned by Jim Crockett, Jr., under pressure from Ted Turner. The WWF and its major superstar, [[Hulk Hogan]], however, were now the superior figures of wrestling after the success of the first [[WrestleMania (1985)|WrestleMania]], so the sale took place to successfully put the company in better shape. The new WCW, which was now a combination of JCP (Mid-Atlantic Wrestling) and Championship Wrestling from Georgia, was now the top show on TBS, and Jim Crockett, Jr. became NWA President for the second time.&lt;ref name="NWAPresident"&gt;{{cite web|title=NWA Presidents during the Mid-Atlantic period 1973–1986 |url=http://www.midatlanticgateway.com/Almanac/nwa_title/nwatitle_antiquephotoalbum.htm#presidents |publisher=Mid-Atlantic Gateway |accessdate=2007-04-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403080452/http://www.midatlanticgateway.com/Almanac/nwa_title/nwatitle_antiquephotoalbum.htm#presidents |archivedate=2007-04-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1986, Jim Crockett Promotions controlled key portions of the NWA, including the traditional NWA territories in [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[St. Louis]], thanks in no small part to the success of the [[Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup]] (which showcased talent from various NWA territories), as well as a working cross-promotional relationship with [[Verne Gagne]]'s [[American Wrestling Association]]. JCP merged its NWA territories into one group, promoting under the banner "NWA World Championship Wrestling". This sparked a feud between Crockett and Vince McMahon's WWF, and the companies attempted to outmaneuver each other to acquire key [[television]] slots. It was the WWF, however, who was able to become a hit in St. Louis (and the rest of Missouri as well), which brought trouble to the NWA Central States. The WWF was able to become a hit across the country as well, as the feud between Hulk Hogan and Paul Orndorff appealed to a large audience. Following this, Bob Geigel became the NWA President once again.&lt;ref name="NWAPresident"/&gt;

In the same year, JCP also purchased Geigel's [[Heart of America Sports Attractions]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship |url=http://www.nwawrestling.com/PHP-Nuke/modules.php?name=Encyclopedia&amp;op=content&amp;tid=175 |publisher=National Wrestling Alliance |accessdate=2007-04-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919061901/http://www.nwawrestling.com/PHP-Nuke/modules.php?name=Encyclopedia&amp;op=content&amp;tid=175 |archivedate=2007-09-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; promoters of the Central States territory, which owned the rights to promote wrestling shows through the states of [[Kansas]], [[Missouri]], and [[Iowa]].

==== National promotion ====
In 1987, JCP would enter into an agreement to control [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]], and [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] (which covered Oklahoma, [[Mississippi]], [[Arkansas]], [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]]; by this time, the UWF had split from the NWA); this helped elevate Crockett to a third tenure as NWA President. The Florida and Mid-South territories (along with those companies' rosters of wrestlers) were absorbed into WCW. Jim Crockett Promotions now owned NWA St. Louis, the Universal Wrestling Federation, Mid-Atlantic, Central States Wrestling, Championship Wrestling from Georgia and Championship Wrestling from Florida as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Assael|first=Shaun|author2=Mooneyham, Mike |title=Sex, Lies and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation|date=2002-07-16|publisher=Crown Publishers|isbn=0-609-60690-5|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

JCP had almost accomplished its goal of creating a national promotion. Between the purchasing of several NWA territories, [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] in Texas leaving the NWA in 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foley|first=Mick|title=Have a Nice Day!: A Tale of Blood and Sweat socks|date= 2000-10-16|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-00-710738-2|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and later merging with [[Jerry Jarrett]]'s [[Continental Wrestling Association]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to create the [[United States Wrestling Association]] brand),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawler|first=Jerry|title=It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes|publisher=WWE Books|date=2002-12-17|isbn=0-7434-5768-4|page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; JCP was the last bastion of the NWA, and the last member with national television exposure. Although JCP and the NWA were still two separate legal entities, with Crockett as NWA President, the NWA was effectively reduced to an on-paper organization funded by Jim Crockett Promotions, and allowed JCP to use the NWA brand name for promoting.

With the large amount of capital needed to take a wrestling promotion on a national tour, the various territorial acquisitions had seriously drained JCP's coffers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dick|last=Bourne|title=The Birth of Mid-Atlantic Wrestling On Television|url=http://www.midatlanticgateway.com/Almanac/tv_history/tv_birth.htm|publisher=Mid-Atlantic Gateway |accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was in a similar situation to that of the WWF in the early 1980s: a large debt load, and the success or failure of a federation hinging on the success or failure of a series of [[pay-per-view]] events. In 1987, JCP marketed the fifth installment of [[Starrcade (1987)|Starrcade]] as the NWA's answer to the WWF's [[WrestleMania]] event. However, the WWF promoted their first [[Survivor Series (1987)|Survivor Series]] event on the same day. The WWF informed cable companies that if they chose to carry Starrcade, they would not be allowed to carry future WWF events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Assael|first=Shaun|author2=Mooneyham, Mike |title=Sex, Lies and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation|date=2002-07-16|publisher=Crown Publishers|isbn=0-609-60690-5|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of companies showed Survivor Series (only five opted to remain loyal to their contract with Crockett, resulting in only an $80,000 profit after expenses).

In January 1988, JCP promoted [[Bunkhouse Stampede]], and McMahon counter-programmed with the first [[Royal Rumble (1988)|Royal Rumble]] on [[USA Network]]. Both NWA events achieved low buyrates, and the resulting financial blow led to the beginning of the end for JCP. The decision to hold these events in Chicago and New York alienated the Crockett's main fanbase in the Carolinas, hampering their drawing power for arena shows in the Southeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Assael|first=Shaun|author2=Mooneyham, Mike |title=Sex, Lies and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation|date=2002-07-16|publisher=Crown Publishers|isbn=0-609-60690-5|pages=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dusty Rhodes ====
In 1984, Crockett had signed [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] and made him [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booker]] for ''World Championship Wrestling''. Rhodes had a reputation for creativity and authored many of the memorable feuds and story lines of this period and [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmick]] matches like ''WarGames''. Also, Rhodes was responsible for elevating up-and-coming wrestlers such as [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]], [[Ricky Steamboat]], [[Magnum T.A.]], [[The Road Warriors|the Road Warriors]] ([[Road Warrior Hawk|Hawk]] and [[Road Warrior Animal|Animal]]), and [[Nikita Koloff]], among others, to superstardom. By 1988, after four years of competition with Vince McMahon, and a long political struggle with champion [[Ric Flair]], Rhodes was burnt out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Assael|first=Shaun|author2=Mooneyham, Mike |title=Sex, Lies and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation|date=2002-07-16|publisher=Crown Publishers|isbn=0-609-60690-5|pages=76, 767}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans were sick of the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dusty Finish|Dusty finish]] (and other non-endings for shows) that had obliterated the once-profitable [[house show]] market. One of the last creative aspects Dusty Rhodes initiated was the first ''[[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions I|Clash of the Champions]]'', on the night of [[WrestleMania IV]]. For a quarter-hour, the Ric Flair vs. Sting match gained more viewers than WrestleMania; the epic match also made Sting a top player for WCW. By the end of 1988, Rhodes was booking cards seemingly at random, and planning at one point to have mid-card wrestler [[Rick Steiner]] defeat Ric Flair in a five-minute match at [[Starrcade (1988)|Starrcade]] for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]]. After Starrcade '88, Rhodes was fired by the promotion after an angle he booked on November 26, where [[Road Warrior Animal]] pulled a spike out of his shoulder pad and jammed it in Rhodes's eye busting it wide open, despite a strict "no-blood" policy laid down by Turner after his recent purchase of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Molinaro|title=Starrcade, the original "super card"|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/dec17_starrcade.html|publisher=Slam! Sports|date=1999-12-17|accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== WCW under Ted Turner (1988–2001)==
[[File:Ted Turner LF.JPG|left|thumb|190px|[[Ted Turner]].]]
To preserve the inexpensive network programming provided by professional wrestling, Jim Crockett Promotions was purchased outright by Turner on October 11, 1988. Originally incorporated by TBS as the '''Universal Wrestling Corporation''', Turner promised fans that WCW would be the athlete-oriented style of the NWA. The sale was completed in November 2, 1988, with a television taping of ''[[WCW Saturday Night|NWA World Championship Wrestling]]'' that very same date in WCW's hometown of Atlanta.&lt;ref name="First date"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/jcp88.htm|title=JCP 1973|accessdate=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1989 proved to be a turnaround year for WCW, with Ric Flair on top for most of the year as both World Champion and head booker. Flair helped bring in [[Ricky Steamboat]] and [[Terry Funk]], and his pay-per-view matches with Steamboat were financially and critically successful. Young stars such as [[Sid Vicious (wrestler)|Sid Vicious]], [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]], [[Scott Steiner]], [[The Road Warriors]], [[Brian Pillman]], [[Keiji Mutoh|The Great Muta]] and [[Lex Luger]] were given major storylines and championship opportunities. 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1990: The Year in Wrestling (WCW)|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/27048/The-Year-In-Wrestling:-1990-(WCW).htm|publisher=Ken Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, would be an entirely different story, as Flair would be fired from being head booker in March 1990 after WCW talent began to argue that Flair was booking things in his favor. One of these examples was Flair's refusal to drop the WCW World title to Lex Luger, as he had already promised to drop it to Sting, who himself had been injured earlier in the year. Flair was eventually replaced by Ole Anderson.&lt;ref name="ddtdigest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ddtdigest.com/features/histor02.htm |title=The History of WCW, Part II |publisher=Ddtdigest.com |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this influx of talent, WCW soon began working to gradually incorporate much of the glamour and showy gimmicks for which the WWF was better known. Virtually none of these stunts—such as the live cross-promotional appearance of [[RoboCop (character)|RoboCop]] at [[Capital Combat]]  in May 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robocop - or should that be RoboCrap?|url=http://www.robocoparchive.com/info/cameo/wrestle.htm|publisher=RoboCop Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Halloween Havoc (1991)|Chamber of Horrors]] gimmick, and the notorious [[The Black Scorpion (professional wrestling)|Black Scorpion]] storyline—succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=R. D.|title=Wrestlecrap: True Stories of the World's Maddest Wrestlers|isbn=1-84454-071-5|author2=Baer, Randy |publisher=Blake Publishing|date=2004-10-01|pages=114–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, house shows were also dropping to record lows after Ole continuously pushed older wrestlers who were loyal to him during the shows.&lt;ref name="ddtdigest"/&gt; Behind the scenes, WCW was becoming more autonomous and slowly started separating itself from the historic NWA name. In January 1991, WCW officially split from the NWA and began to recognize its own [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]] and [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]].

Both WCW and the NWA recognized Ric Flair (who was by now no longer the head booker) as their World Heavyweight Champion throughout most of the first half of 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Year In Wrestling: 1991 (WCW)|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/27106/The-Year-In-Wrestling:-1991-(WCW).htm|publisher=Ken Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; but WCW, particularly recently installed company president [[Jim Herd]], who was formerly the manager of the [[St. Louis]] TV station [[KPLR-TV]] and had also once been the regional manager of [[Pizza Hut]], turned against Flair for various reasons and fired him before [[The Great American Bash (1991)|The Great American Bash]] in July 1991 after failed contract negotiations. In the process, they officially stripped him of the WCW World Heavyweight Championship.&lt;ref name=ricflairprofile&gt;{{cite web|last=Milner|first=John|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/r/ric-flair.html|title=Ric Flair - Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2007-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Flair's autobiography, they refused to return the $25,000 deposit he had put down on the physical belt, so he kept it and brought it with him when he was hired by the WWF at the request of Vince McMahon. Flair then incorporated the belt into his gimmick, dubbing himself "The Real World's Champion". On a sidenote, Flair eventually received his deposit which with interest was over $38,000. WCW later renegotiated the use of the NWA name as a co-promotional gimmick with [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] and sued the WWF to stop showing Flair with the old NWA World Title belt on its programs, claiming a trademark on the physical design of the belt. The belt was returned to WCW by Flair when Jim Herd was let go and he received his deposit back plus interest. It was brought back as the revived [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]].

Meanwhile, the creative product of the company sank in 1991 and 1992 under the presidency of the inexperienced Herd. Ric Flair, who had conflicts with Herd, once stated that Herd "knew nothing about wrestling, other than the fact that the station he ran had a hot show." (referring to the once-popular show ''[[Wrestling at the Chase]]''. which was broadcast by KPLR-TV while Herd was manager there.)&lt;ref&gt;''The Ultimate Ric Flair Collection'', WWE Home Video, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; According to Flair, Herd also wanted him to drop his entire "Nature Boy" persona, shave his head (even though Flair's bleach blonde hair was one of his most recognizable trademarks) and adopt a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[gladiator]] gimmick by the name of Spartacus in order to "change with the times". This didn't sit too well with Flair and the creative committee. (Committee member [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] was quoted as saying, "After we change Flair's gimmick, why don't we go to [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] and change [[Babe Ruth]]'s uniform number?")&lt;ref&gt;''[[To Be the Man]]'', Ric Flair, WWE Books, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This backstage feud hit its breaking point when, during contract renegotiation, Flair refused to take a pay cut and be moved away from the main event position (despite the fact that he was by far the company's biggest draw). He also refused to drop the title to Lex Luger as Herd wanted. Herd accused Flair of holding up the company.  Flair tried to compromise to Herd and offered to drop the title to fellow Horseman Barry Windham, saying that Windham deserved the title.&lt;ref&gt;Nature Boy Ric Flair: The Definitive Collection DVD&lt;/ref&gt; 

Herd's other ideas included the [[The Rock n Roll Rebels|Ding Dongs]] (a tag team whose sole gimmick was that they were obsessed with bells), a lumberjack named [[Matt Osborne|Big Josh]] who was accompanied to the ring by dancing [[bear]]s, and [[The Desperados (professional wrestling)|the Desperados]], a stable of bumbling [[cowboy]]s. None of these ideas were received well by the rest of WCW, as they were seen by many as a poor attempt to mimic the WWF's more gimmick-oriented style, and [[Stan Hansen]] left WCW outright when he was asked to be a part of the Desperados. [[Jim Cornette]] and [[Stan Lane]] would also depart from the promotion after having conflicts with Herd (thus breaking up the [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|Midnight Express]], one of WCW's top tag teams), and the Road Warriors would also leave in July 1990 because of conflicts with Herd.

Herd was fired in January 1992 and was succeeded by [[Kip Allen Frey]]. Frey's tenure running WCW was brief, and he would be replaced later in the year by [[Bill Watts|"Cowboy" Bill Watts]], who had formerly been the promoter for [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]] (later known as the Universal Wrestling Federation) and was the first head executive of WCW to have prior experience in the wrestling business since Jim Crockett left.

1992 would also prove to be another bad year for WCW as well,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Year In Wrestling: 1992 (WCW)|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/27213/The-Year-In-Wrestling:-1992-(WCW).htm|publisher=Ken Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Watts would make top rope moves – which were commonly performed by rising stars such as Brian Pillman and the Steiner Brothers – illegal during wrestling matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ddtdigest.com/features/histor04.htm |title=The History of WCW, Part IV |publisher=Ddtdigest.com |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of Watts' plans to take the WCW product back to 1970s standards, with poorly lit arenas and house shows in remote rural towns. This idea was not overly embraced by the rest of WCW. After clashes with management over a number of issues as well as feeling pressure from [[Hank Aaron]] over a racially sensitive piece of correspondence, as well as accusations of [[antisemitism]] from [[Paul Heyman|Paul E. Dangerously]] and [[Raven (wrestler)|Scotty Flamingo]] (both of whom are [[Jewish]]), he resigned.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.237)&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently replaced by [[Eric Bischoff]].

=== Final split with the NWA ===
During the period that WCW operated with its own World Heavyweight Championship, while also recognizing the NWA's world title, Flair left the WWF on good terms and returned to WCW, regaining the NWA title from [[Barry Windham]] in July 1993.&lt;ref name=ricflairprofile/&gt; Immediately, the other, now smaller, member organizations of the NWA began demanding that Flair defend the title under their rules in their territories, as mandated by old NWA agreements. The title was later scheduled to be dropped by Flair to [[Rick Rude]], a title change which was exposed by the pre-taping of matches at the [[Disney-MGM Studios]], known as the [[WCW Disney tapings|Disney tapings]]. The NWA board of directors, working separately from WCW, objected to the title being changed without their vote and WCW finally left the NWA for good again in September 1993. WCW still legally owned and used the actual belt which represented the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, however, and Rick Rude even defended it as the "[[Big Gold Belt]]", but they could no longer use the NWA name. The title thus became known as the [[WCW International World Heavyweight Championship]] as the World Heavyweight Championship as sanctioned by fictitious subsidiary WCW International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Slagle|title="Ravishing" Rick Rude|url=http://www.wrestlingmuseum.com/pages/bios/rickrude2.html|publisher=The Ring Chronicle|year=2000|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512182057/http://www.wrestlingmuseum.com/pages/bios/rickrude2.html|archivedate=2008-05-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; WCW claimed that WCW International still recognized the belt as a legitimate World Championship. For a short while, there were essentially two world titles up for competition in the organization, with Sting winning the WCW International title, while Flair captured the WCW World Heavyweight Championship from [[Vader (wrestler)|Vader]]. The two titles were [[Championship unification|unified]] by Flair in a match on June 23, 1994, when the experiment was jettisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ric Flair|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/flair.html|publisher=Slam! Sports|accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Big Gold Belt was then used to represent the lone world championship in the company. It was used as such until WCW's closure in 2001, and for a time in the WWF.

== Eric Bischoff era (1993–1999) ==
[[File:Eric Bischoff.jpg|left|thumb|190px|[[Eric Bischoff]].]]
There were signs of gradual recovery in February 1993 when former commentator [[Eric Bischoff]] was appointed as Executive Vice President of WCW. Bischoff, originally brought in as a secondary commentator behind [[Jim Ross]] after the [[American Wrestling Association]] folded, was desperate to give WCW a new direction and impressed Turner's top brass with his non-confrontational tactics and business savvy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foley|first=Mick|title=Have a Nice Day!: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|date=2000-10-16|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-00-710738-2|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross, upset that a man who once answered to him was now his supervisor, requested and received a release from TBS executive Bill Shaw (after suggestion from Bischoff) and ended up in the WWF.&lt;ref name=mf238&gt;Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.238)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bischoff's first year running the company was considered extremely unsuccessful. Dusty Rhodes and Ole Anderson were still in full creative control at this point, and under their watch WCW presented cartoonish storylines as well as seemingly pointless feuds with little or no build-up (for instance, the "Lost in Cleveland" and "Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal" angles involving [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]] and Sting respectively, as well as the "White Castle of Fear" and ''[[Beach Blast]]'' mini-movies).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=R. D.|title=Wrestlecrap: True Stories of the World's Maddest Wrestlers|isbn=1-84454-071-5|author2=Baer, Randy |publisher=Blake Publishing|date=2004-10-01|pages=122–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Lost in Cleveland" storyline began when Cactus Jack ([[Mick Foley]]) first wrestled [[Big Van Vader|Vader]] on April 6, 1993. Foley and Vader wanted an intense match, so they agreed that Vader would hit Cactus with a series of heavy blows to the face.&lt;ref name=mf240&gt;Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.239-241)&lt;/ref&gt; WCW edited the match heavily because it was against their policies to show the heavy bleeding that resulted.&lt;ref name=mf240/&gt; Foley suffered a broken nose, a dislocated jaw and needed twenty-seven stitches, but won the match via countout.&lt;ref name=mf240/&gt; Because the title did not change hands on a countout, WCW booked a rematch. Foley, however, wanted some time off to be with his newborn daughter and get surgery to repair a knee injury. As a result, in the rematch with Vader on April 23, the two executed a dangerous spot to sell a storyline injury. Vader removed the protective mats at ringside and power-bombed Cactus onto the exposed concrete floor, causing a legitimate concussion and causing Foley to temporarily lose sensation in his left foot and hand.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.243-244)&lt;/ref&gt; While Foley was away, WCW ran an [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]] where Cactus Jack's absence was explained with a [[Farce|farcical]] comedy storyline in which he went crazy, was institutionalized, escaped, and developed amnesia.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.248-250)&lt;/ref&gt; Foley had wanted the injury storyline to be very serious and generate genuine sympathy for him before his return. The comedy [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vignette|vignettes]] that WCW produced instead were so bad that Foley jokes in [[Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|his autobiography]] that they were the brainchild of WCW executives, who regarded a surefire moneymaking feud as a problem that needed to be solved.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Mick. Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p. 249)&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 6, 1993, WCW began the aforementioned Disney Tapings, a move which would grow into a major headache for them. In order to save money, the promotion rented out a studio located at the [[Disney's Hollywood Studios|Disney-MGM Studios]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], and proceeded to tape its syndicated television programming months before it was to air on television. Wrestlers were often forced to appear on-camera with belts they would not actually win for several more months, exposing future WCW storylines to those in attendance (most of whom were tourists who had been coached to cheer and boo on cue). Footage of Rude with the NWA title shot at these tapings had caused the controversy with the NWA discussed above. Moreover, the tapings also caused confusion in the tag team division, as they had revealed that [[Arn Anderson]] and [[Paul Roma]] were to win the WCW World tag team titles from [[The Hollywood Blonds]] ([[Stone Cold Steve Austin|"Stunning" Steve Austin]] and [[Brian Pillman|Flyin' Brian Pillman]]). The promotion had decided to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Swerve|swerve]] the fans at the live Beach Blast pay-per-view event in July and keep the titles on the Blonds, but the live ''[[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions XXIV|Clash of the Champions XXIV]]'' show was to take place in August before the already-shot footage of Anderson and Roma as tag team champions was to begin circulating in late-August. However, before the Clash event, Pillman was injured and unable to wrestle, forcing [[William Regal|Lord Steven Regal]] to replace him alongside Austin. Of course, Anderson and Roma won the titles, and the Blonds, an immensely popular tag team with fans, were inexplicably broken up permanently.&lt;ref name="The History of WCW: Part V"&gt;[http://www.ddtdigest.com/features/histor05.htm The History of WCW: Part V]&lt;/ref&gt;

Clash of the Champions XXIV saw WCW's reputation take another hit. In 1993, [[Ric Flair]] returned to WCW from his WWF tenure, but was constrained by a no-compete clause from his WWF contract. In response, WCW gave him a [[talk show]] segment on its television shows called "A Flair for the Gold," in the mold of the old "[[Piper's Pit]]" segments from 1980s WWF programming starring [[Roddy Piper|"Rowdy" Roddy Piper]]. During a segment of the talk show at the Clash, WCW decided to introduce a "mystery partner" for the babyfaces, a masked man known as [[Fred Ottman|The Shockmaster]]. The Shockmaster (Fred Ottman, previously known as "Typhoon" in the WWF) was supposed to crash through a fake wall and intimidate the heels. Instead, he tripped through the wall and fell on his face on live television, inadvertently rendering himself a joke character (despite winning some matches).&lt;ref name="The History of WCW: Part V"/&gt; [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] later claimed that a 2x4 was placed on the bottom of the wall, which had not been there on a successful rehearsal, which caused Ottman to trip and stumble.&lt;ref&gt;WWE 24/7- Legends Of Wrestling "Worst Characters&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 1993, WCW decided to once again base the promotion around Ric Flair. This was seen as more or less a necessity after prospective top babyface Sid Vicious was involved in an incident with [[Arn Anderson]] (which resulted in hospitalization of both men)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Mooneyham|title=Sid, Arn Continue Hostilities |url=http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=4EBA8F07-7BBB-49DD-9C9BADDB3FC21754|publisher=The Wrestling Gospel|date=1994-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; while on tour in [[England]] eight weeks before [[Starrcade (1993)|Starrcade]] and was fired. Flair then placed his career on the line against [[Big Van Vader]] for the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]]. Flair won the title at Starrcade and was once again made booker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foley|first=Mick|title=Have a Nice Day!: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|date=2000-10-16|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-00-710738-2|page=349}}&lt;/ref&gt; That did not stop WCW from suffering massive financial losses in 1993, however; a staggering $23 million.&lt;ref name="The History of WCW: Part V"/&gt;

=== Competition with the WWF ===
Beginning in 1994, Bischoff declared open war on McMahon's WWF and aggressively recruited high-profile former WWF superstars such as [[Hulk Hogan]] and [["Macho Man" Randy Savage]] to work for WCW. Using Turner's monetary resources, Bischoff placed his faith in established stars with proven track records. Due to their high profiles, however, Hogan and Savage were able to demand concessions, such as multi-year, multimillion-dollar contracts and [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|creative control]] over their characters. This would later become a problem during subsequent years of competition with the WWF, as other wrestlers were able to make similar demands, and contract values soared out of control. Hogan in particular was able to gain considerable influence through a friendship with Bischoff. Hogan's considerably hefty fee of $700,000 per pay-per-view appearance plus 25% of the gross revenue from the pay-per-view would cost the company dearly in future years. He was paid this amount whether the pay-per-view was successful or not. Hogan's creative control would later prove to be a large hindrance during WCW's future success, such as during [[Starrcade 1997]].

Nevertheless, WCW's first major pay-per-view event since Hogan's hiring, [[Bash at the Beach (1994)|Bash at the Beach]], saw the former WWF mainstay cleanly defeat Ric Flair for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The two had worked for the WWF at the same time from 1991 to 1992, and a feud was teased between them, but the big-money match originally planned for [[WrestleMania VIII]] was changed to Flair/Savage and Hogan/[[Sid Vicious (wrestler)|Sid]]. When WCW delivered the match, the event drew a high buyrate by WCW standards due to mainstream intrigue and hype. Despite being a critical and financial success, the glory would not last, as the Hogan/Flair feud would only result in one more match (at [[Halloween Havoc (1994)|Halloween Havoc]]) and the hope for long-term effects on pay-per-view buyrates and ratings did not materialize. Turner management came to this realization when they checked up on the state of the company in mid-1995. Hence, Bischoff called Turner and requested a private meeting, which he was granted.

==== ''Nitro'' and "The Monday Night Wars" ====
At their mid-1995 meeting, Turner asked Bischoff how WCW could conceivably compete with McMahon's WWF. Bischoff, not expecting Turner to comply, said that the only way would be a primetime slot on a weekday night, possibly up against the WWF's flagship show, ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]''. Turner granted him a live hour on TNT every Monday night, launching the weekly show ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'', which debuted on September 4, 1995, live from the [[Mall of America]] in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=R.D.|author2=Alvarez, Bryan |title=The Death of WCW|date=2004-11-01|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=1-55022-661-4|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WCW Monday Night Nitro-Monday, September 4, 1995|url=http://www.ddtdigest.com/updates/1995091m.htm|publisher=DDT Digest|accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which specifically overlapped with ''Raw''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Eric|last=Schomburg |title=WWE and WCW Legend: Eric Bischoff|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=9665|publisher=American Chronicle|date=2006-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was expanded to two live hours in May 1996 and later three in February 1998. Bischoff himself was initially the host, alongside Bobby Heenan and ex-[[National Football League|NFL]] star [[Steve McMichael|Steve "Mongo" McMichael]].

The initial broadcast of ''Nitro'', running unopposed because of the pre-emption of ''Raw'' for [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] [[tennis]] coverage on the [[USA Network]], featured the return of [[Lex Luger]] (who had been in the WWF since 1993) to the WCW audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rick|last=Scaia|title=Raw vs. Nitro: Year One|url=http://www.oowrestling.com/features/mnw-y1.shtml|publisher=Online Onslaught|date=2003-08-07|accessdate=2007-04-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516125131/http://www.oowrestling.com/features/mnw-y1.shtml|archivedate=2008-05-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; WCW's coup of obtaining Luger was significant for several reasons. Because ''Nitro'' was live at the time, premiering major stars on the show would signal to the fans the amount of excitement the broadcasts would contain. Also, Luger had just come off a moderately successful run in the WWF, and was at one time one of the company's top stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lex Luger profile|url=http://gerweck.net/lexluger.htm|publisher=Gerweck|accessdate=2007-04-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609021840/http://www.gerweck.net/lexluger.htm|archivedate=2007-06-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, because Luger had been employed with the WWF as recently as a week before his ''Nitro'' appearance (he had, in fact, wrestled on a house show for the WWF in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] the night before his appearance on ''Nitro'') WCW fans would be intrigued to see others possibly "jump ship". The [[Monday Night Wars]] had now officially begun.

Early on, Bischoff vigorously promoted his new show by giving away WWF ''Raw'' results on ''Nitro'', as ''Raw'', unlike ''Nitro'', was then mostly taped in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Rickard|title=Review of "The Death of WCW"|url=http://www.gumgod.com/mike_wcw.htm|year=2005|publisher=GumGod}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bischoff took another famous jab at the WWF on December 18, 1995, when he brought reigning WWF Women's Champion [[Debrah Miceli]] (who had previously competed in WCW as "Madusa") back to the promotion as her WWF character Alundra Blayze and, live on ''Nitro'', had her publicly denounce the Blayze character and throw the WWF Women's title belt in a trash can, reclaiming her "Madusa" moniker in the process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrestlinggonewrong.com/video/madusa_belt.html Wrestling Gone Wrong: Madusa Trashes the WWF Women's Title on Nitro]&lt;/ref&gt; The WWF responded to all this by creating the "Billionaire Ted" skits, which featured parodies of Ted Turner ("Billionaire Ted"), Hulk Hogan ("The Huckster"), Randy Savage ("The Nacho Man"), and WCW interviewer [[Gene Okerlund|"Mean Gene" Okerlund]] ("Scheme Gene"), which were said to infuriate Turner, thereby giving him more motivation to compete (though Turner would later admit that he wasn't offended by the skits, and instead found them funny).

=== Dominance (1996–1998) ===
The tide began to turn in WCW's favor on Memorial Day 1996 when [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Scott Hall]], who had wrestled in the WWF as Razor Ramon, interrupted a match by walking down through the crowd into the ring. He delivered his "You want a war?" speech: "You people know who I am," he began, "but you don't know why I'm here."  Hall said that he and two of his associates were going to "take over." Many thought he meant Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels, then still with WWF. Hall challenged the best WCW wrestlers to stand up and defend the company against their onslaught.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=R.D.|author2=Alvarez, Bryan |title=The Death of WCW |date=2004-11-01|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=1-55022-661-4|page=64}} a few weeks&lt;/ref&gt;

The next week, Hall reappeared on ''Nitro'' and pestered the WCW announcers. Sting confronted him, and was rewarded with a toothpick in the face for his efforts. Sting retaliated by slapping Hall across the face, and in response Hall promised Sting a "little... no... BIG surprise" the next week in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]]. This surprise ended up being Hall's good friend and former WWF Champion [[Kevin Nash]]. Nash delivered his own speech to Bischoff, referring to WCW's slogan of "Where The Big Boys Play" with the response "We didn't come here to play," and warning Bischoff, "The measuring stick just changed here...you're looking at it.", and in the weeks following Hall and Nash were collectively referred to as "The Outsiders." Both men took to showing up unexpectedly during ''Nitro'' broadcasts, usually jumping wrestlers backstage, distracting wrestlers by standing in the entranceways of arenas, or walking around in the audience. Within a couple of weeks, they announced the forthcoming appearance of a mysterious third member.

At [[Bash at the Beach (1996)|Bash at the Beach 1996]], Hall and Nash were scheduled to team with their mystery partner against Lex Luger, Randy Savage and Sting. At the onset of the match, Hall and Nash came out without a third man, telling "Mean Gene" Okerlund that he was "in the building," but that they did not need him yet. Shortly into the match, a Stinger Splash resulted in Luger being crushed behind Kevin Nash, and being taken away on a stretcher, reducing the match to The Outsiders vs. Sting and Savage. Hall and Nash took control of the match when Hulk Hogan came to the ring. After standing off with The Outsiders for a moment, he suddenly leg dropped Savage, showing himself to be the Outsiders' mysterious third man. Giving an interview with Okerlund directly after the match, Hogan claimed the reason for the turn was that he was tired of fans that had turned on him. Hogan referred to a "new world organization of wrestling". The faction was soon dubbed the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo), beginning a feud between wrestlers loyal to WCW and the nWo. The fans in attendance were so outraged at Hogan's betrayal that they pelted the ring with debris, such as paper cups and plastic bottles, for the duration of his interview. One fan even jumped the security railing and tried to attack Hogan in the ring, but was swiftly subdued by Hall, Nash, and arena security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=R.D.|author2=Alvarez, Bryan |title=The Death of WCW|date=2004-11-01|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=1-55022-661-4|pages=69–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bischoff, the original plan for the nWo was to have [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] be revealed as the third man rather than Hogan, but Hogan convinced Bischoff to make him the third man instead, with the reasoning that the third man needed to have WWF name value much like Hall and Nash did during their initial appearances as the Outsiders. Because of his tremendous success as the face of the WWF in the 80's and early 90's, Hogan was universally associated with the WWF and therefore was the perfect choice to lead the nWo. Hogan's heel turn at Bash at the Beach marked the first time in over 15 years (dating back to his face turn in the AWA in 1981) that he portrayed a villainous character, and also served to revitalize his in-ring persona after his "Hulkamania" gimmick started to grow stale with WCW's audience.

Shortly after, the WWF filed a lawsuit, alleging that the nWo storyline implied that Hall and Nash were invaders sent by Vince McMahon to destroy WCW, despite the fact that Bischoff asked Nash point blank on camera at The Great American Bash, "Are you employed by the WWF?" to which Nash emphatically replied "No". Another reason for the lawsuit was the WWF claimed Scott Hall acted in a manner too similar to the character Razor Ramon which was owned by the WWF. The lawsuit dragged out for several years before being settled out of court. One of the settlement's terms was the right for the WWF to bid on WCW's properties, should they ever be up for liquidation; a settlement that would prove invaluable in the future.

Though an on-screen threat to the WCW promotion, the nWo would prove helpful in the early stages of the ratings war. On the September 23, 1996, episode of ''Nitro'', with most of the WCW roster over in Japan, the group took over the entire show, including the broadcast booth and the ring announcer's role, and branded the episode as their own. [[Big Show|The Giant]] was the ring announcer and [[Hollywood Hogan]], [[Sean Waltman|Syxx]], Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, [[Mike Jones (wrestler)|Vincent]], [[Ted DiBiase]], and [[Eric Bischoff]] (who was not part of the faction at the time) were at the broadcast table.

Largely due to the nWo angle, ''Nitro'' defeated ''Raw'' for 84 consecutive weeks. During this time, WCW occasionally revealed the endings to pre-taped  ''Raw'' matches at the beginning of its live broadcast. Bischoff reasoned that fans who were open to switching between the two programs would be less inclined to switch to ''Raw'' if fans knew ahead of time how the matches would end.

==== Starrcade 1997 ====
{{Main|Starrcade (1997)|l1=Starrcade 1997}}
In 1997, WCW entered its peak. The nWo began feuding with the revived [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]] as well as the returning WCW hero [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]]. Sting had changed his gimmick when he returned to WCW television, becoming a darker, brooding character, largely based on ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]''. Sting would be in the rafters of WCW arenas watching the WCW/nWo feud, and sometimes rappel down into the ring to help WCW wrestlers fighting the nWo. The latter feud served to build up [[Starrcade (1997)|Starrcade]] in December. When WCW delivered the Sting vs. Hogan match for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, the event drew WCW's largest buyrate and Bischoff was largely praised in the months leading up to this event because of his refusal to give away ("hotshot" in wrestling slang) a Sting vs. Hogan title match for free or without proper buildup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.100megsfree4.com/wiawrestling/pages/wcw/wcwppvbr.htm|title=WCW Buyrates|publisher=Wrestling Information Archive|accessdate=2007-04-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402041733/http://www.100megsfree4.com/wiawrestling/pages/wcw/wcwppvbr.htm|archivedate=2007-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the Hogan/Sting angle endured for approximately 15 months.

Wrestling fans consider this show to be the beginning of the end for WCW, however, even as they were dominating the WWF in the television ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.100megsfree4.com/wiawrestling/pages/wcw/wcwnitro.htm |title=WCW Ratings|publisher=Wrestling Information Archive|accessdate=2007-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogan was heavily criticized for not allowing a clean finish to the match, which confused and irritated fans who had waited over a year to see Sting take down the nWo. The finish actually involved a recently introduced [[Bret Hart]], who had refereed the preceding match between Bischoff and [[Larry Zbyszko]] for control of ''Nitro'', coming down to the ring after Hogan had supposedly won the match. Hart alleged that referee [[Nick Hamilton|Nick Patrick]] had performed a fast count on Sting and wanted to "make things right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rick|last=Scaia|title=Raw vs. Nitro: Year Three|url=http://www.oowrestling.com/features/mnw-y3.shtml|date=2003-08-14|publisher=Online Onslaught}}&lt;/ref&gt; By many accounts, however, including Bischoff's in his memoir ''Controversy Creates Cash'', the count looked like a normal count, so Hart's protestations did not make sense; replays of the three-count on later shows had the video sped up to hide this. Hart insisted that the match continue with himself as referee, in order to prevent Sting from being "screwed" like Hart had legitimately been at the [[Montreal Screwjob]] the month prior, which had ended his run with the WWF and hastened his arrival in WCW. 

In essence, whereas fans were promised a classic battle between Hogan and Sting in which the latter would defeat the leader of the nWo, they were presented with a faux reverse-tide potshot at the Montreal Screwjob. The inclusion of Hart himself confused and frustrated fans even more as Hart had no part in the feud between Hogan and Sting. To add insult to injury, it was decided that because of the messy finish to the match and the rematch on the following Monday's ''Nitro'', Sting was stripped of the WCW title on January 8, 1998, on the debut episode of ''[[WCW Thunder]]''. Hogan and Sting would face each other again for the vacant championship at [[SuperBrawl VIII]] the next month

Starrcade represented in many ways WCW's golden opportunity to pull farther ahead of the WWF and send the federation to its demise. With WCW steadily making money and firmly dominating the ratings battle, the PPV could have been a devastating blow to the WWF's comeback. However, WCW alienated its fan base instead. Even though the buy rate for Starrcade '97 was the largest WCW had ever seen for a PPV, it was the turning point in the Monday Night Wars and the WWF would soon be on the rise.

When Hart was planning to leave the WWF in 1997 after signing a contract to WCW prior to the Montreal Screwjob at the [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]], it looked as though WCW was in position to permanently eclipse the WWF, if not put them out of business. WCW appeared to possess the biggest stars in the industry, such as Hogan, Savage, Sting, Flair, Hart, Hall and Nash. In addition, the company had credible midcard stars such as [[Chris Jericho]], [[Eddie Guerrero]], [[Chris Benoit]], [[Dean Malenko]], and [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]], as well as an exciting [[Cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|cruiserweight]] division featuring high-flying international competition from [[Mexico]] and [[Japan]], where the high-flying style of wrestling was popularized. However, things would not unfold as WCW had planned.

[[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner]] sought to capitalize on WCW's momentum by launching a new Thursday night show on TBS, ''[[WCW Thunder]]'', in January 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WCW Thunder|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0251469/|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular opinion was that the Screwjob and WCW's subsequent acquisition of Hart were death blows for the WWF. WCW had a golden opportunity to capture the allegiances of WWF fans who were disenchanted with the company after its poor treatment of a popular star. But according to Hart, the company failed to capitalize on his talent and momentum, and had no idea how to properly utilize him. Vince McMahon had described Hart as the kind of wrestler who a promoter builds his whole company around, but WCW generally used him as a midcarder. Their biggest hope was that Hart would help create inroads in foreign markets such as his native [[Canada]], [[Germany]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Bischoff contends that due to the events of Montreal, Hart's passion and desire for the business was not as it was during his WWF heyday. "Montreal...had taken his toll on him," Bischoff stated in his autobiography. "It was all he talked about... constantly." Furthermore, Hart would suffer an injury during a match with [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] that forced him into retirement. In any event, Hart's WCW tenure failed to live up to expectations.

As WCW coasted with the same basic formula they had been following, McMahon set about revamping his creative approach and set in motion events that later put his company ahead of WCW for good. Under the [[The Attitude Era|"WWF Attitude"]] moniker, he elevated rising stars like [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]], [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], [[Triple H]] and his [[D-Generation X|DX]] group, [[Mick Foley|Mankind]], and [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]. After Starrcade, Sting's presence on WCW's main card would begin to fade as he became an afterthought to the split-up of the nWo. As a result, his drawing power would decrease in the coming months. Meanwhile, Austin's popularity and stardom sparked a turnaround in ''Monday Night Raw''’s ratings as he quickly became the WWF's franchise player. McMahon himself, after having played in a supporting role on camera as the play-by-play announcer, capitalized on the ill will he received from fans for screwing Bret Hart by turning himself into an on-screen villain. The "Mr. McMahon" heel character feuded with babyface wrestlers and used his influence to screw them out of wins and titles. Austin’s feud with McMahon began to turn the tide in the WWF’s favor. The April 13, 1998 episode of ''Raw'', headlined by a match between Austin and McMahon, marked the first time that WCW lost the head-to-head Monday night [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] battle in 84 weeks. WWF ratings began an ascent to highs previously unheard of in wrestling on cable TV. WCW attempted to counter this by dividing the nWo into the Hogan-led heel [[nWo Hollywood]] faction and the Nash-led face [[nWo Wolfpac]] faction, but this was seen by many fans as a poor rehash of the WCW vs. nWo storyline of 1996–1997, with boring predictable matches and vignettes.

WCW's next big attempt to regain ratings supremacy was by marketing ex-[[National Football League|NFL]] player [[Bill Goldberg]] as an invincible monster with a record-breaking winning streak. WCW marketed Goldberg as their answer to Stone Cold Steve Austin; however, Goldberg's massive popularity ultimately did little to improve WCW's flagging ratings, especially as the list of stars ready to be [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Squash|destroyed]] by Goldberg grew shorter, not to mention the declining quality of the PPVs. One of WCW's last wins in the Monday night ratings war was on July 6, 1998, when WCW aired Goldberg's long-awaited world title victory over Hulk Hogan on free television. This significantly increased the rating for the show, but only for that week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=R.D.|title=Wrestlecrap: True Stories of the World's Maddest Wrestlers|isbn=1-84454-071-5|author2=Baer, Randy |publisher=Blake Publishing|date=2004-10-01|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a match could likely have generated millions, possibly tens of millions for WCW on pay-per-view had the angle been built up properly for a matter of months. 

On September 14, 1998, WCW won the ratings war once again with a memorable moment that featured Ric Flair's return to WCW (Flair had been absent from WCW programming for a brief period prior to this due to having legitimate conflicts with Eric Bischoff) to reform the legendary [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]]. ''Nitro'' ended the night with a 4.5 rating, as opposed to the 4.0 rating attained by ''Raw''.

On October 25, 1998, WCW's [[Halloween Havoc (1998)|Halloween Havoc]] ran longer than the time allocated because of the last-minute addition of a [[WCW World Tag Team Championship|tag team title]] match between the champions ([[Scott Steiner]] and [[Big Show|The Giant]]) and the challengers ([[Rick Steiner]] and [[Buff Bagwell]]), which Rick Steiner won by himself although Bagwell abandoned him as a tag partner (Steiner would later chose [[Kenny Kaos]] as his tag partner and they held the titles until Steiner went down due to injury and the title was vacated until [[SuperBrawl 9]]). As a result, several thousand people lost their pay-per-view feed at 11pm during the highly  anticipated world title match between [[Diamond Dallas Page]] and Goldberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Halloween Havoc (1998)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362698/|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following night, WCW decided to correct the fault by airing the entire match for free on ''Nitro'' and won the ratings war for the final time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ddtdigest.com/updates/1998104m.htm|title=WCW Monday Nitro Results-10/26/1998|publisher=DDT Digest|accessdate=2007-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This timing faux pas upset millions of viewers who had paid for the pay-per-view of whom WCW were forced to reimburse, only to have to wait to see the main event for free the next night.

Bill Goldberg's aforementioned undefeated streak was pivotal in WCW's efforts to compete with the WWF; within nearly a year, he had become one of WCW's most popular wrestlers and his streak became one of the company's biggest draws. Despite Goldberg's popularity, Kevin Nash, (who had been appointed as WCW's head booker) set himself up to defeat Goldberg at [[Starrcade (1998)|Starrcade]]. Though the match itself went well, it drew criticism for how it ended; [[Scott Hall]] ran in and tased Goldberg with a cattle prod, enabling Nash to pick up the win, ending Goldberg's streak and becoming the champion. Many within WCW criticized the outcome of the match as well, believing it damaged the aura of invincibility that had been built up around Goldberg for the past year-and-a-half. Many also believed that it was not time for Goldberg's streak to end and that Nash was not the right person to end it, and that he was simply abusing his power as the booker. With Goldberg's streak over, WCW's chances to compete with the WWF dwindled.

Then came the match between Nash and Hulk Hogan on the January 4, 1999, episode of ''Nitro''. The match was originally advertised as a Starrcade rematch between Nash and Goldberg. As a result, the [[Georgia Dome]] in [[Atlanta]] was a complete sellout, with over 40,000 people watching live expecting to see the rematch. Throughout the broadcast the announcers hyped the main event as being the "biggest match in the history of our sport" and said that "unlike the other guys, we have a real main event". Instead, Goldberg was forced to forgo his title match after being kayfabe arrested by the [[police]] for stalking [[Miss Elizabeth]] and was replaced by the returning Hogan, who had been absent from WCW for several months prior to this as part of an angle where he claimed to be retired from professional wrestling. Hogan faked a punch on Nash and then poked him in the chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1285743-12-things-that-killed-wcw-between-the-fingerpoke-and-vince-russo |title=12 Things That Killed WCW Between the Fingerpoke and Vince Russo |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=2012-08-05 |accessdate=2013-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cagesideseats.com/2013/1/4/3834348/on-this-date-in-wcw-history-the-fingerpoke-of-doom-and-tony-schiavone |title=On this date in WCW history: The Fingerpoke of Doom and Tony Schiavone |author=Holland, Jesse |publisher=SB Nation Cageside Seats |date=2013-01-04 |accessdate=2013-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nash [[glossary of professional wrestling terms|oversell]]ed the poke in the chest by forcefully falling to the mat and allowing Hogan to pin him for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. This effectively united the two separate nWo factions into a new faction, the [[nWo Elite]]. They hugged in the ring immediately afterwards until Goldberg made his way down to the ring along with Lex Luger, only to have Luger blindside him and Hall taser him with a shock stick once again, just like at Starrcade. This incident has become infamously known as the "[[Fingerpoke of Doom]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=R.D.|title=Wrestlecrap: True Stories of the World's Maddest Wrestlers |isbn=1-84454-071-5|author2=Baer, Randy |publisher=Blake Publishing|date=2004-10-01|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This [[bait-and-switch]] damaged the credibility of the company as a whole, having failed to present the advertised match and using underhand tactics to sell out the arena for that night's telecast. 

Also, on the same episode of ''Nitro'', play-by-play announcer [[Tony Schiavone]], under direction from Bischoff, revealed that [[Mick Foley]], who was portraying his popular "Mankind" character at the time, would be winning the WWF Championship on a taped edition of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' and mocked the WWF for making what he implied was a bad business decision (sarcastically saying "huh, ''that's'' gonna put some butts in the seats").  Nielsen ratings indicated that over 300,000 households changed the channel to watch the victory and shifted the ratings for the night in the WWF's favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foley|first=Mick|title=Foley is Good: And the Real World is Faker Than Wrestling|publisher=HarperCollins |date=2001-07-01|isbn=0-00-714508-X|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=R.D.|title=WrestleCrap: True Stories of the World's Maddest Wrestlers|isbn=1-84454-071-5|author2=Baer, Randy |publisher=Blake Publishing|date=2004-10-01|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decline (1998–1999)===
{{See also|Eric Bischoff#Downfall of WCW|Warrior (wrestler)#World Championship Wrestling (1998-1999)|l1=Downfall of WCW|l2=Warrior in WCW}}
WCW slid into a period of extravagant overspending and creative decline; the reasons and the people responsible are still a matter of debate. One possible reason was the overuse of celebrities in pay-per-view matches, such as [[Dennis Rodman]] and [[Jay Leno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dennis Rodman biography|url=http://www.celebritywonder.com/html/dennisrodman.html|publisher=CelebrityWonder.com|accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Powell|title=Leno pins Bischoff at Road Wild|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/aug9_hee.html|publisher=Slam! Sports|date=1998-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, WCW's credibility was damaged by [[product placement]], such as [[Rick Steiner]] trading barbs with [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] the killer doll in order to advertise the 1998 film ''[[Bride of Chucky]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ddtdigest.com/updates/1998102m.htm|title=WCW Monday Nitro Results-10/12/1998|publisher=DDT Digest|accessdate=2007-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, top-level stars had no motivation to excel in the ring due to their long-term contracts. WCW did not promote its younger stars to the company's top slots (a charge admitted by Bischoff). Despite having talented younger wrestlers like [[Chris Jericho]], [[Chris Benoit]], [[Dean Malenko]], [[Billy Kidman]], [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.]], [[Eddie Guerrero]], [[Perry Saturn]], [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]], [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T.]], and [[Rey Mysterio|Rey Mysterio, Jr.]] on its roster, they were kept away from the main event scene. Of these wrestlers listed, five would go on to headline main events in WWF/E and become World Champions (Both Eddie Guerrero and Booker T have also since been inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] for their in-ring achievements), something WCW bookers believed these men would never be able to sell as.

WCW programming had started to decline in quality, leading to a loss of viewers, and the company reacted by throwing money at personalities, something it could ill-afford to do. Talents were reportedly signed to keep them from appearing on WWF television. At one point, WCW held over 260 individual performers under guaranteed contracts, many of whom rarely appeared in its programs. During one ''Thunder'' program, only 15 of the 260 contracted wrestlers appeared on screen.

Also in 1998, Bischoff recruited [[The Ultimate Warrior]], a former WWF star, to feud with Hogan (to capitalize on the Hogan/Warrior match at [[WrestleMania VI]]). Their October 1998 rematch at [[Halloween Havoc (1998)|Halloween Havoc]] was considered as one of the worst matches in pay-per-view history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=R.D.|title=Wrestlecrap: True Stories of the World's Maddest Wrestlers|isbn=1-84454-071-5|author2=Baer, Randy |publisher=Blake Publishing|date=2004-10-01|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, although the feud between Warrior and Hogan leading up to the match was initially well received, interest soon dissipated after several convoluted and unrealistic segments involving the two were aired on WCW programming. Warrior also insisted on elaborate and costly apparatuses, such as a trapdoor in the ring which badly injured [[Davey Boy Smith|The British Bulldog]] when he landed on it awkwardly earlier in the event. Warrior would vanish from WCW shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Davey Boy Smith determined to re-enter the wrestling ring|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBritishBulldog/bulldog_99jul4.html|publisher=Calgary Sun|first=Rick|last=Bell|date=1999-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bischoff's autobiography ''[[Controversy Creates Cash]]'', [[Time Warner]] increasingly [[Micromanagement|micromanaged]] WCW, severely hindering (and occasionally overriding) Bischoff's control of the company. Time Warner initially gave him slight restrictions as to what he was and was not allowed to do with WCW. The restrictions mounted as time passed, with impending lawsuits between the WWF and WCW adding more. By the summer of 1998, he was outright ordered to alter WCW's format to a more "family-friendly" output. The forced shift in WCW's programming came while the WWF, buoyed by its new "Attitude" branding and product, was regularly beating an increasingly stagnant WCW week after week in the Monday night ratings war. Also, Time Warner had ordered WCW (like the other companies under Time Warner ownership) to slash their budget, putting even more strain on the company. As it was common knowledge that many executives in WCW ownership — from the Turner-owned era to the AOL Time Warner years – hated the idea of wrestling on their stations and attempted to remove the company entirely, Bischoff maintains that the restrictions and mandates placed on WCW was done in order to accomplish and accelerate the promotion's demise.

[[Harvey Schiller]], who served as the president of [[Turner Sports]] at the time and acted as Eric Bischoff's superior, had Bischoff removed from control of the promotion on September 10, 1999, after a failed [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] for the 1970s [[Musical ensemble#Rock and pop bands|rock group]] [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] through WCW shows and a storyline involving rapper [[Master P]] and [[The No Limit Soldiers]] backfired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Mooneyham|title=Bischoff Faces Tougher Task This Time|url=http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=FE1E2C5E-995A-4B88-90A6670951A21D3A|publisher=The Wrestling Gospel|date=2001-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fightingspiritmagazine.co.uk/article.asp?IntID=66 Fighting Spirit Magazine - Article]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.411mania.com/music/columns/38180/Loop-Diggin-Thursdays,-News-&amp;-Rants-2.23.06.htm 411mania.com: Music - Loop Diggin’ Thursdays, News &amp; Rants 2.23.06] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209002239/http://www.411mania.com/music/columns/38180/Loop-Diggin-Thursdays%2C-News-%26-Rants-2.23.06.htm |date=2008-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; KISS collaborated with WCW to promote The Demon, a gimmick created in the band's image (the character was originally portrayed by [[Brian Adams (wrestler)|Brian Adams]] and then by [[Dale Torborg]]); as a way of introducing The Demon, KISS closed out an episode of ''Nitro'' with a live performance of their hit song "[[God of Thunder (song)|God of Thunder]]", during which The Demon made his debut. The segment is widely considered to be one of the lowest-rated segments in the history of ''Nitro'', and the Demon character quickly lost its momentum. The No Limit Soldiers stable flopped so badly that the fans turned on them and began supporting [[The West Texas Rednecks]] heel stable that they were feuding with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Brashear|title=Great-ing Gimmicks of the Past: The West Texas Rednecks|url=http://www.insidepulse.com/articles/43109|publisher=Inside Pulse|date=2005-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; An announced "million-dollar contest" was later cancelled and a planned ''Nitro'' [[list of animated television series|animated series]] was scrapped as well as the [[Road Wild]] pay per view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Assael|first=Shaun|author2=Mooneyham, Mike |title=Sex, Lies and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation|date=2002-07-16|publisher=Crown Publishers|isbn=0-609-60690-5|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TNT pins Sting for telepic|url=https://variety.com/article/VR1117489380.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1|publisher=Variety|first=John|last=Dempsey|date=1998-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vince Russo (1999–2000) ===
[[File:Vince Russo at the Family Arena.jpg|right|thumb|190px|[[Vince Russo]] (pictured on the right).]]
Bischoff was unexpectedly replaced by WCW accountant Bill Busch, who was named Senior Vice President. Busch would bring in former WWF head writer [[Vince Russo]] and his colleague [[Ed Ferrara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike |last=Mooneyham |title=Vince Russo Joins WCW |url=http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=F90215A2-0B7B-4911-8AA85373C58C1CFE |publisher=The Wrestling Gospel |date=September 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204090247/http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=F90215A2-0B7B-4911-8AA85373C58C1CFE |archivedate=2009-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Russo and Ferrera presented themselves as the brains behind the "Attitude Era", and WCW offered them lucrative contracts to jump ship in October 1999. Russo and Ferrara tried to replicate the same writing format (known as "Crash TV") they had used to revamp the WWF's creative product in the onset of the Attitude Era, but at a more accelerated pace. They also tried to push the younger WCW talents straight away, and phase out aging stars such as Hogan and Flair.

Russo and Ferrara struggled to gain approval for their near-the-knuckle ideas from WCW management, such as a "[[Piñata]] on a Pole" match between [[Mexico|Mexican]] wrestlers on November 15.&lt;ref name=WCW9501Book&gt;{{cite book | first=Graham | last=Cawthon | title=the History of Professional Wrestling Vol 5: World Championship Wrestling 1995–2001 | publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform | year= 2015 | isbn=1499656343}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1999, Russo and Ferrera revived the nWo (this time under the name [[nWo 2000]]), this time with [[Jeff Jarrett]] and [[Bret Hart]] at the helm. They next targeted WWF announcer [[Jim Ross]] with a parody character called "Oklahoma," who was played onscreen by Ferrara and would go on to win the [[WCW Cruiserweight Championship]].  Ross suffered from [[Bell's palsy]], and the character lampooned his resultant facial defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Mooneyham|title=JR Parody Bottom Of Barrell |url=http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=456C2C2A-118B-40FA-880F5474892B63C5|publisher=The Wrestling Gospel|date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gimmick was very poorly received by many within the wrestling community, claiming that the character was in bad taste (and even sparking a legitimate feud between Ed Ferrara and [[Jim Cornette]], one of Ross' close friends, that has persisted to present day.)

Bad luck struck in December 1999 when Hart suffered a career-ending [[concussion]] at the hands of Goldberg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jason|last=van Rassel|title=Hitman's cut loose by WCW|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBretHart/oct21_hart-sun.html|publisher=Calgary Sun|date=2000-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; who severely damaged his own hand less than a week later while punching through a [[limousine]] window in [[Salisbury, Maryland]] as part of a storyline that was written by Russo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Milner|first=John|title=Goldberg|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/goldberg.html|publisher=Slam! Sports|accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russo himself became an on-screen character during this period, though one whose face was never shown on camera; only his hand and the back of his chair were ever actually seen, as he called wrestlers into his office to receive their marching orders for the night. This became part of a recurring theme in Vince Russo's WCW as "[[worked shoot]]s" became regular occurrences on WCW programming as a way of blurring the lines between what was [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legitimate]] and what was not.

Russo and Ferrara were suspended three months later amid rumors that they wanted to make former [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] fighter [[Tank Abbott]] the WCW Champion.&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=R.D.|author2=Bryan Alvarez |title=The Death of WCW|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=1-55022-661-4|year=2004|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbott, despite his legitimate fighting background, had little wrestling experience and had failed to connect with WCW audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Matt|last=Boone|title=Tank Abbott Speaks On His WCW Career, UFC Return, &amp; More|url=http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/2003/articles/1045115235.php|publisher=WrestleZone Radio|date=2003-02-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095745/http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/2003/articles/1045115235.php|archivedate=2007-09-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]], who had been an on/off booker over the course of several years, was appointed as the new head writer in the interim. The new writing team attempted to appease the demoralized wrestlers and fans by putting the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on [[Chris Benoit]] at [[Souled Out (2000)|Souled Out]] in January 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wcwchampionship/30445411035|title=History of the WCW World Championship-Chris Benoit|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Benoit (who had legitimate bad blood with Sullivan stemming from him having an extramarital affair with Sullivan's wife [[Nancy Benoit|Nancy]] several years previously) was among a group of wrestlers who expressed their intent to leave the company prior to the show. Benoit, along with his similarly frustrated friends [[Eddie Guerrero]], [[Dean Malenko]], and [[Perry Saturn]], voiced their grievances to Busch, who initially told them he would take Sullivan off ''Nitro'' and ''Thunder'' where they wouldn’t have to work under him, only to turn around and tell them they were all being sent home except Benoit. Benoit doubled down on his stance and backed his fellow wrestlers. He handed the belt back right after winning it and he, along with Guerrero, Malenko, and Saturn, signed with the WWF the next day. The four quickly became popular in the WWF as "[[The Radicalz]]". This loss of valuable talent led to Busch being fired as Senior Vice President; he would be replaced by Turner programming chief Brad Siegel. 

On February 11, 2000, 12 wrestlers, including [[African American]] wrestler [[Hardbody Harrison]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] [[Sonny Onoo]] launched [[Racism|racial discrimination]] [[lawsuit]]s against WCW,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Brian|last=Farmer|title=Former WCW Wrestler "Hardbody" Harrison Norris Federally Indicted|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2005/1129694617.shtml|date=2005-10-19|publisher=WrestleView.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kazuo 'Sonny' Onoo speaks out|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive2001/apr4_onoo-can.html|publisher=Slam!

Some speculated that the charges of racism led to African American wrestler Booker T. winning the WCW Championship later that year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ed|last=De La Garza|title=Hogan takes on WCW|url=http://www.stp.uh.edu/vol65/158/sports/sports-index.html|publisher=The Daily Cougar Sports|date=2000-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his real-life brother [[Stevie Ray]] being made a [[color commentator]]; Stevie Ray himself acknowledged that it may have been a factor. Onoo claimed that he had been given a disrespectful gimmick and that his final salary—[[United States dollar|$]]160,000—was only half of the average pay for a wrestler at that time.&lt;ref name="Altamura"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive2001/apr4_onoo-can.html|author=Altamura, M.|title=Kazuo 'Sonny' Onoo speaks out|publisher=[[Canoe.ca|Canadian Online Explorer]]|accessdate=2008-05-18|date=2001-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Russo's leadership, WCW would continue to lose [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], and eventually dropped to 1.8 in 2000, the second lowest WCW television rating to date, behind the 1.72 rating on April 27, 1998.

=== Final year (2000–2001)===
{{Main|New World Order (professional wrestling)}}
In April 2000, with ratings hitting new lows, Russo and Bischoff were reinstated by WCW, where, in another attempt to get WCW's creative product turned around, they decided to [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] WCW into a more modern, streamlined company. All angles taking place at the time were immediately dropped and all championships were vacated, effectively "re-starting" WCW with a clean slate. Russo and Bischoff believed that this approach was the most effective way to salvage WCW's damaged product.

The first major storyline to take place in WCW following the reboot saw Bischoff and Russo form an on-screen union that stood up for the younger talent in the company (which they dubbed [[the New Blood]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faction profiles: The New Blood|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/n/new-blood.html|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in their battle against [[the Millionaire's Club]], which consisted of the older, higher-paid, and more visible stars such as Hogan, Sting, and Diamond Dallas Page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faction profiles: The Millionaires Club|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/m/millionaires-club.html|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though initially well received, the storyline quickly degenerated into yet another nWo rehash, with the heel nWo recast as the New Blood and the face WCW embodied in the Millionaire's Club. Had the reverse been done, with the New Blood as faces and Millionaire's Club as heels, the angle may have worked but many saw the casting as an attempt for sympathy towards the veterans who had already gained bad reputations behind the scenes. Oddly, the New Blood was disbanded before the [[New Blood Rising]] pay-per-view began.

The unorthodox and controversial storylines continued. Although neither was a trained wrestler, both Russo and actor [[David Arquette]] each won the WCW Heavyweight Championship, the latter in order to promote the box-office flop ''[[Ready to Rumble]]'' (though Arquette was vehemently against winning the championship, believing that fans, like himself, would detest a non-wrestler winning the title.) As neither looked physically capable of defeating actual wrestlers in a match, the title's credibility hit rock-bottom as a result (In WWE's ''The Rise and Fall of WCW'' documentary, Jim Ross said that Arquette winning the championship was a "farce" and an "embarrassment", and [[David Crockett (wrestling)|David Crockett]], the brother of Jim Crockett, Jr. who worked as one of WCW's backstage producers, said that WCW might as well "throw [the title] in the trash can.").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the WCW World Championship-David Arquette|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wcwchampionship/30445411014|accessdate=2007-04-15|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=IMDb|title=Ready to Rumble|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217756/|accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the WCW Championship-Vince Russo |url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wcwchampionship/304454110218 |publisher=WWE.com |accessdate=2007-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419061927/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wcwchampionship/304454110218 |archivedate=2007-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Goldberg turned heel for the first time in his career at [[The Great American Bash (2000)|The Great American Bash]], but the execution of the turn was botched, and after a lackluster feud with Kevin Nash and a failed attempt to duplicate his original streak, Goldberg's drawing power was greatly diminished. 

During this time period, Vince Russo had many behind-the-scenes conflicts with Hulk Hogan. Russo believed that Hogan's time in the spotlight was over and began using him less and less on WCW programming. Whenever Hogan did appear, he was usually relegated to essentially being a "[[jobber to the stars]]", being forced to job to other main-event wrestlers such as Sting and Goldberg, as well as to [[Billy Kidman]], whom Russo had Hogan feud with in an attempt to elevate Kidman to main-event status; however, the feud did little for either Kidman or Hogan. When it was announced that Hogan would be facing Jeff Jarrett for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship at [[Bash at the Beach (2000)|Bash at the Beach]], the writing team informed Hogan that he would be jobbing to Jarrett once again. Hogan, having had enough, invoked his creative control and demanded that he win the match and the title. Russo agreed to the finish, but added that the finish would involve no wrestling at all, just Jarrett simply laying down for Hogan to pin him, which Hogan strongly disagreed with. During the actual match at the event, Jarrett indeed lied down for Hogan, with Russo physically coming down to the ring and throwing the title belt at Hogan's feet. A visibly frustrated Hogan then grabbed a microphone and broke character, saying, "Is this your idea, Russo? That's why this company is in the damn shape it's in, because of bullshit like this!" Hogan pinned Jarrett to win the match, but only moments later, Russo came back out and immediately voided Hogan's title win before delivering a [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot speech]] aimed at Hogan, during which he referred to Hogan as a "piece of shit" and that WCW fans would "never see [him] again", effectively firing Hogan live on pay-per-view. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ed|last=De La Garza|title=Hogan takes on WCW |url=http://www.stp.uh.edu/vol65/158/sports/sports-index.html|publisher=The Daily Cougar Sports|date=2000-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually led to Hogan filing a [[Defamation|defamation of character]] lawsuit, which was dismissed in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hulk Hogan sues WCW|url=http://tv.zap2it.com/tveditorial/tve_main/1,1002,271%7C61085%7C1%7C,00.html|publisher=Zap2it|date=2000-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infuriated by Russo's actions (which conflicted with his intentions for ''Bash''), Bischoff departed once more in July 2000. At the New Blood Rising pay-per-view on August 13, an injured Goldberg walked out of a triple threat elimination contest against Kevin Nash and Scott Steiner (violating the script of the match) and swore at Russo on his way back to the dressing room on-camera, leaving Steiner to wrestle and lose to Nash by himself. As a result of Goldberg's actions at New Blood Rising, the storyline was drastically changed to a rivalry between Steiner and Goldberg, culminating in a match at [[Fall Brawl (2000)|Fall Brawl]], which Steiner won. Immediately afterward, Russo informed Goldberg that if he ever lost another match from that point, he would be released from his WCW contract. In truth however, this was an opportunity for Goldberg to heal from previous injuries. Russo was gone from the promotion entirely by late 2000, leaving [[Terry Taylor]] and [[John Laurinaitis|Johnny Ace]] holding the reins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rick|last=Scaia|title=Raw vs. Nitro Year Six|url=http://www.oowrestling.com/features/mnw-y6.shtml|publisher=Online Onslaught|date=2003-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, a short-lived crossover feud began involving stars of WCW and ''[[Battle Dome#World Championship Wrestling|Battle Dome]]''.

At the [[WCW Sin|Sin]] pay-per-view in January 2001, Goldberg and his trainer [[DeWayne Bruce]] lost a tag team match to Totally Buffed ([[Buff Bagwell]] and [[Lex Luger|The Total Package]].) This was Goldberg's final appearance for WCW before the company was purchased by the WWF.

By the beginning of February 2001, most female personalities had been released from the promotion in an attempt to cut costs. Also as of February 2001, WCW would hold its events in [[Southern United States|Southern States]] only.

==== Attempted Bischoff/Fusient purchase (2001)====
Meanwhile, [[Time Warner]] had bought out Turner's empire in 1996, including WCW.  Turner was personally faithful to WCW regardless of whether it was losing him money because an earlier incarnation of the promotion had helped establish Turner's first television station, [[WPCH-TV|WTBS]]. However, Time Warner did not share his loyalty especially when accounts showed that WCW was losing between $12–$17 million a year at this point (and $60 million in 2000 alone), but Turner was still the single largest Time Warner shareholder, so WCW continued to operate at his behest. When [[AOL]] merged with Time Warner in 2000, Turner was effectively forced out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Auletta|first=Ken|title=Media Man: Ted Turner's Improbable Empire|date=2004-09-30|publisher=W.W. Norton|isbn=0-393-05168-4|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although WCW tried to alleviate the strain of debt in early 2001, the financial burdens proved too much for the promotion and its new parent, AOL Time Warner. Once it gained the power to sell off WCW, AOL Time Warner looked to do so in order to cut its losses. A sale nearly occurred in late 2000 to Bischoff and a group of private investors calling themselves Fusient Media Ventures, with news reports and even Eric Bischoff declaring a deal was in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Gabriel|last=Spitzer|date=2001-01-08|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news2001/jan01/jan08/5_fri/news2friday.html|title=Turner sells WCW but not to Vince McMahon|publisher=Media Life Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Fusient backed out when Turner networks head [[Jamie Kellner]] formally cancelled all WCW programming from its television networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bret|last=Hart|title=Wrestling monopoly|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBretHart/030124-sun.html|publisher=Calgary Sun|date=2001-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; With no network on which to air its programming, WCW was of little value to Fusient, whose offer depended on being able to continue to air WCW programming on the Turner networks, despite the fact that WCW, according to Bischoff in his book, had received offers from FOX and NBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ed |last=De La Garza |title=WCW goes off the air, promises exciting finale Monday |url=http://www.stp.uh.edu/vol66/115/shobiz/shobiz-index.html |publisher=The Daily Cougar Sports |date=2001-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041130202911/http://www.stp.uh.edu/vol66/115/shobiz/shobiz-index.html |archivedate=2004-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acquisition by the World Wrestling Federation and aftermath ==
On March 23, 2001, all of WCW's trademarks and [[WWE Video Library|archived video library]], as well as a select twenty-four contracts, were sold to Vince McMahon and World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. through its subsidiary, [[WCW, Inc.]] WCW's intangible properties were purchased for [[United States dollar|$]]3,000,000.&lt;ref name="WWFdeal"&gt;{{cite news|first=Don|last=Callis| title=Deal leaves wrestlers out in cold|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingWCWSale/cyrus_01mar25-sun.html|publisher=Slam! Sports|date=2001-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the [[Card (sports)#Main event|main event]]-level stars including Flair, Goldberg, Kevin Nash, and Sting were contracted directly to parent company AOL Time Warner instead of WCW, and thus [[Time Warner|AOL Time Warner]] was forced to continue to pay many of the wrestlers for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Championship Wrestling| url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/promotions/wcw/|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has since itself reverted to Universal Wrestling Corporation.

[[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] did allow a final ''Nitro'' show to air from [[Panama City Beach, Florida]] which had been scheduled for the following Monday on March 26. McMahon opened the last-ever episode of ''WCW Monday Nitro'' with a [[simulcast]] with ''WWF Monday Night Raw'', which aired from [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]], with a self-praising speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shane buys WCW |url=http://www.wcw.com/p1.html |date=2001-03-26 |publisher=WCW.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010604050931/http://www.wcw.com/p1.html |archivedate=2001-06-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The final WCW World Heavyweight Championship match for the show and the company saw [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Heavyweight Champion]] [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] defeat [[Scott Steiner]] to win the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]]. The main event featured [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] defeating [[Ric Flair]] with the [[Professional wrestling holds#Sharpshooter|Scorpion Deathlock]] as a culmination of their trademark feud, then both men embraced one another at the match's conclusion. This was a direct parallel to the very first ''Nitro'', where Sting vs. Flair was also the main event. After the Sting/Flair match, Vince appeared on ''Raw'' to close ''Nitro'' and to declare victory over WCW. Vince's son [[Shane McMahon]] then appeared on ''Nitro'', declaring that it was actually ''he'' who had bought WCW. This initiated a storyline in which Shane led a [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|WCW invasion]] of the WWF,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Price|title=Great angle... but is it a great idea?|url=http://oratory.rajah.com/testfolder/index.php?archive=1461|publisher=The Oratory|date=2001-07-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204090422/http://oratory.rajah.com/testfolder/index.php?archive=1461|archivedate=2009-02-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which lasted from March to November 2001 and marked the end of WCW.

Despite aborted attempts to run WCW-branded events (including a proposed Saturday night timeslot that later evolved into ''[[WWF Excess]]'' and then ''[[WWE Velocity]]'') the WWF only ran a handful of matches on ''Raw'' and ''SmackDown!'' under the WCW banner. These WCW-branded matches were ill-received by the longtime WWF fans so much that on the very first WCW-brand main event between Booker T and Buff Bagwell the crowd cheered when the WWF heels Stone Cold Steve Austin and Kurt Angle ran in to jump the WCW babyface Booker T.

In 2004, WWE produced a [[DVD]] called ''The Monday Night Wars''. Two hours in length, the DVD left out a large portion of the wars, breaking off around 1997 before jumping straight to the post-WCW era of WWE. The objectivity of the DVD's content was questioned, as some believed the documentary was simply telling the WWE side of the story. On August 25, 2009, WWE released ''The Rise and Fall of WCW'' on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWE Sets Release Date For "Rise and Fall of WCW" DVD|url=http://pwnewsnow.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1241729575&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=6&amp;|publisher=PW News Now}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVD looked back at the roots of WCW during the days of GCW and Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, to the glory days of ''Monday Nitro'' and the nWo, and to its demise and sale to WWE. This DVD included several new interviews from Vince McMahon, Jim Crockett, Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, Bill Goldberg, as well as many of those responsible for running the NWA and WCW. Archive interviews were included from former WCW talent such as Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff, due to their respective contracts with [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] not allowing them to provide fresh interviews for WWE. In 2014, [[WWE Network]] released a new documentary series, ''The Monday Night War: WWE vs. WCW'', covering a much broader scope of the wars than the previous ''Monday Night Wars'' DVD, as well as providing more equal viewpoints for both WWE and WCW.

{{Bosniaks}}

This article is about the history of the [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] people. 

The term Bosniak refers the ethnonational group of people that is also known as the Bosnian Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=To Know Where He Lies: DNA Technology and the Search for Srebrenica’s Missing|last=Wagner|first=Sarah|publisher=University of California Press|year=2008|isbn=9780520255746|location=Berkeley|pages=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was officially established in 1993 after the Bosniak Assembly adopted the ethnonym to be used instead of Bosnian Muslims. Scholars state that this move is partly motivated by a desire to distinguish the Bosniaks' identity from the Bosnian Muslims category, which has a complicated history of national identity formation in the former [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; There are scholars who also explain that the Bosniak identity has been conceptualized differently compared to the [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Croats]] and the [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Serbs]] in the sense that it has a collective identity, one that is founded on a shared environment, cultural practices and common experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How Generations Remember: Conflicting Histories and Shared Memories in Post-War Bosnia and Herzegovina|last=Palmberger|first=Monika|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2016|isbn=9781137450623|location=London|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Pre-history==
{{main|Early history of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
The Pre-[[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] roots of the Bosniaks can primarily be traced back to the [[paleolithic]] and [[neolithic]] settlers, which eventually became [[Indo-European languages|Indo-Europeanized]] during the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref name=Geneticstudy&gt;Marjanović, Damir; et al. "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=16266413&amp;dopt=Abstract The peopling of modern Bosnia-Herzegovina: Y-chromosome haplogroups in the three main ethnic groups]." ''Institute for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, [[University of Sarajevo]].'' November, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Those Indo-European speaking immigrants (generically known as the Illyrians) arrived in the western parts of the Balkans around 2,000&amp;nbsp;BCE, overrunning the various [[Old European Culture|old European cultures]] that lived there before them (such as the [[Butmir Culture]] in the vicinity of modern [[Sarajevo]]). Despite the arrival of the [[Celts]] in north-eastern parts of nowadays Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE, the Illyrians remained the dominant group until the arrival of the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].

[[Roman Empire|Rome]] conquered Illyria after a series of wars, the final being the crushing of a rebellion by certain tribes in what is now central [[Bosnia]] around 9 CE. [[Latin]]-speaking settlers from all over the empire settled among the Illyrians at this time. The [[Roman province of Dalmatia]] included [[Herzegovina]] and most of Bosnia, and a strip of northern Bosnia, south of the [[Sava|Sava River]], was part of the province of [[Pannonia]]. The [[Vlachs]], a historically [[nomadic]] people who live throughout the Balkans, speak a language derived from [[Latin]], and are the descendants of Roman settlers and Romanized indigenous peoples. No longer present in a large number, they were absorbed into Bosnia's three main ethnic groups based on religion during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period.

The Germanic-speaking [[Goths]] conquered [[Roman Dalmatia]] in the fifth century, and later the [[Alans]], who spoke an [[Iran]]ian language, Germanic [[Lombards]] and the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Huns]] and [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] passed through what is now Bosnia. These invaders left few linguistic and archaeological traces, and whatever remnant populations were left behind were absorbed by the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] wave that was to follow.

==Medieval Bosnia==
{{main|Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Middle Ages}}
Slavs settled in Bosnia, Herzegovina, and the surrounding lands, which were then part of the Eastern Roman Empire, in the seventh century. The Slavic [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] settled sometime after the first wave of Slavs. The Croats established a kingdom in what is northwestern Croatia. The Serbs settled in what is now southcentral Serbia, and later expanding into the upper Drina valley of eastern Bosnia and into Eastern Herzegovina, known in the later Middle Ages as Zahumlje. The Croats to the west came under the influence of the Germanic [[Carolingian Empire]] and the Roman Catholic Church, and Croatia was closely tied to Hungary and later Austria until the twentieth century. The Serbs to the east came under periodic [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule, converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity and absorbed Byzantine cultural influences. After some centuries of rule by Croatia, Serb principalities, and the Byzantine Empire, an independent Bosnian kingdom flourished in central Bosnia between the 12th and the 15th centuries.

The subject of ethnicity in medieval Bosnia has been one of great debate ever since it was brought up in its current context by historians during the second half of the 19th century. All three ethnic groups in Bosnia have a different view on the matter, and this complex and sensitive subject has been further obscured by nationalism and propaganda through the ages. Proving their people as the true heirs of the medieval Bosnian state is important to many nationalists because they consider this indigenousness to have important implications in modern social, political, and interethnic issues. Simply put, however, there is no sign that the population of pre-Ottoman Bosnia and Herzegovina, in whichever social stratum, had developed Croatian or Serbian ethnic consciousness even in a medieval sense of the word. To quote [[Noel Malcolm]], chairman of the board of trustees at the Bosnian institute, from the book "Bosnia A Short History": 

{{Quote|As for the question of whether the inhabitants of Bosnia were really Croat or really Serb in 1180, it cannot be answered, for two reasons: first, because we lack evidence, and secondly, because the question lacks meaning. We can say that the majority of the Bosnian territory was probably occupied by Croats - or at least, by Slavs under Croat rule - in the seventh century; but that is a tribal label which has little or no meaning five centuries later. The Bosnians were generally closer to the Croats in their religious and political history; but to apply the modern notion of Croat identity (something constructed in recent centuries out of religion, history, and language) to anyone in this period would be an anachronism. All that one can sensibly say about the ethnic identity of the Bosnians is this: they were the Slavs who lived in Bosnia.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bosnia: A Short History|author=Malcolm, N.|date=1996|publisher=New York University Press|isbn=9780814755617|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cvk6oMf9R7AC|accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Bosnian Kingdom blended cultural influences from east and west; although nominally Roman Catholic, the Bosnian kings embraced elements of Byzantine culture and court ceremonial, and formed alliances and dynastic marriages with the neighboring rulers of both Croatian-Dalmatian and Serb states. Because of Bosnia's mountainous and inaccessible terrain and its remote location on the borderland between the Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, control by church authorities was weak. The religious situation was also peculiar because of the presence of an indigenous [[Bosnian Church]] (its adherents were known as ''krstjani'', "Christians"). The krštjani were considered heretics by both the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]]. Modern historians have debated whether the Krštjani were a branch of the [[Bogomils]], a [[Manichaean]] sect which originated in Bulgaria, or whether they were members of the Catholic Church who had acquired some heretical beliefs and influences from Eastern Orthodoxy and fell into Schism.

At its largest extent, under King [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko I]], the Bosnian Kingdom included most of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the exception of north-western Bosnia, as well as parts of [[Dalmatia]] ,western [[Serbia|Serbia and Montenegro]]. Discord among his heirs weakened the kingdom after his death, and Bosnia and the Serb principalities to the east were unable to prevent Ottoman Turkish incursions into the western Balkans. The final [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Turkish conquest]] in 1463 marked the end of an independent Bosnia and the beginning of the influence of a third civilization, Islam.

==Ottoman rule==
{{main|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1463–1878)}}
Historians have long debated how and why many ethnic Bosnians converted to Islam.{{Citation needed|reason=Contentious material in this paragraph, some of which has already been deleted following discussion; see talk page.|date=September 2018}} There is no simple answer to this question, and the underlying reasons are complex and numerous. 

However so, after the Ottoman [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina|conquest]] of Bosnia, the Ottomans actively tried to convert their Christian subjects to Islam. The gradual conversion of many ethnic [[Bosnia (region)|bosnian]] Serbs to Islam proceeded at different rates in various areas and among different groups. Conversion to Islam was more rapid in urban areas, which were centers of learning and of the Ottoman administration, than in the countryside. Merchants found it advantageous to convert to Islam because they gained greater freedom of movement and state protection for their goods as Muslims. Many converted and were trained as professional soldiers to fight for the ottomans.

One practice was through forced conversion, a process known as [[devshirme]]. Effectively, taking Serbian children from Christian villages and forcing them to convert to Islam. A notable example is the [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] soldier [[Sokollu Mehmed Pasha|Mehmet Pasa Sokolovic]].

The [[Ottoman Empire]] at the time was centered on militaristic expansion with focus on religion and maintaining power. By this time, Muslims already made up a large majority of Bosnia's population.

The [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia]] was notable because, unlike all other European regions that came under Ottoman control, Bosnia retained its status as a distinct entity from the very beginning (first as a [[sanjak]], then as a province &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[eyalet]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;). The Ottomans imported their feudal system to Bosnia shortly after the take-over, and estates were granted to men called ''[[sipahis]]'', in return for military service in times of war. At the beginning of the Ottoman period, these estates were usually, but not exclusively, granted to Muslims, and later only to Muslims. In Bosnia, these land grants gradually became hereditary, and by the end of the Ottoman period, a majority of the landowners in Bosnia were Muslims, and most Christians were peasants or serfs[[Serbs]].

Probably the biggest reason behind the spread of Islam in the region was the very weak presence of the Church in Bosnia at the time. The old competition between the Catholic and Bosnian churches (along with the Orthodox Church in certain areas) contributed to a very weak and disorganized religious structure in much of Bosnia. To many Bosnians, religion was a combination of traditions and superstitions. Compared to the well-funded and organized religious institutions of their neighbors, it was relatively easy for Bosnians to switch from their Christianity to Islam. It is significant that the only other European region under Ottoman control where a large segment of the population adopted Islam was [[Albania]]; also home to competing Christian sects. Some [[Taxation in the Ottoman Empire|taxes on Muslims]] and orthodox [[Vlachs]] were also lighter than those on other ''rayah''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malcolm|first=Noel|title=Bosnia: A Short History|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8147-5561-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2013}} The [[Hatt-ı Şerif]] attempted to eliminate this uneven taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malcolm|first=Noel|title=Bosnia: A Short History|year=1996|isbn=978-0814755617|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of urban centers, the vast majority of which were Muslim. Cities that were founded at the time, such as [[Sarajevo]] and [[Mostar]], grew rapidly with a specifically Islamic character and advanced living standards. It is understandable that many Christians in the outlying rural regions would convert to Islam to be part of the superior conditions in such places. Further, slaves who converted to Islam could petition for their freedom, and many of the Christians enslaved during the wars with [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Austria]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], and the [[Republic of Venice]] converted to Islam in order to secure their release. Many of these newly freed converts settled in the growing cities, further contributing to their growth and development.

As mentioned previously, it was previously thought that the greater rights afforded to Muslims in the Ottoman Empire motivated Christians to convert to Islam. However, the extent to which Muslims were privileged is often overestimated. The primary discrimination faced by non-Muslims was of a legal nature, as Christians and Jews were not allowed to file lawsuits or testify against Muslims in court. There were also rules of conduct imposed upon them, but there were many to whom these rules did not apply. Though much has been made of the fact that Christian and Jewish subjects of the sultan paid a [[Tax per head|poll tax]] from which Muslims were exempt, Muslims were also faced with the religious [[zakat]] tax, whereas Catholics made donations to their church only on a voluntary basis.

Christians became Muslims through the [[devshirmeh|devsirme]] system, whereby boys were gathered from the Ottoman lands and were sent to Istanbul to convert to Islam and be trained as [[Janissary]] troops, servants of the Sultan or Ottoman officials. One observer in the 16th century even mentioned that the Sultan believed Bosniaks were ''"the best, most pious and most loyal people"'' and ''"much bigger, more handsome, and more able"'' than other Muslim peoples. This firmly establish the Slavic element and language in Istanbul's administration and provided Bosnia with local Bosniak governors from 1488 onward.

The 17th century brought major defeats and military setbacks on the Ottoman Empire's western frontier. With major wars occurring every few decades, Bosnia was economically and militarily exhausted. For Bosnia and Bosniaks, the most critical conflict of all was the [[Great Turkish War]]. At its very start in the mid-1680s, the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburgs]] conquered nearly all of Ottoman [[Hungary]], sending tens of thousands of Muslim refugees flooding into Bosnia. A similar process occurred with the Habsburg conquest of [[Lika]] and [[Slavonia]]. Thousands of Muslims from these parts fled eastward into the Bosnian pashaluk, while those who remained were forcibly converted to Catholicism. In total, it is estimated that more than 100,000 Muslims were expelled from the frontier regions and settled in Bosnia during this time. Many brought with them a new sense of hostility towards Christianity.

Ottoman military disasters continued into the next decade. In 1697, Habsburg [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] conducted an extremely successful border raid which culminated in Sarajevo being put to the torch. The Great Turkish War was finally ended by the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699. However, in the late 1710s yet another war between the Ottomans and the Habsburg-Venetian alliance ensued. It was ended by the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] in 1718, but not before sending another wave of Muslim refugees fleeing to Bosnia proper.

These events created great unrest among Bosniaks. The sentiment of discontent was further magnified by war and an increased tax burden. As a result, Bosniak revolts sprang up in Herzegovina in 1727, 1728, 1729, and 1732. A large plague that resulted in the death of thousands during the early 1730s contributed to the general chaos. In 1736, seeking to exploit these conditions, The Habsburgs broke the Treaty of Passarowitz and crossed the [[Sava]] river boundary. In one of the most significant events in Bosniak history, local Bosniak nobility organized a defense and counterattack completely independent of the ineffective imperial authorities. On August 4, at the [[Battle of Banja Luka]], the outnumbered Bosniak forces routed the Habsburg army and sent them fleeing back to Slavonia.

Traditionally, the Ottoman authorities classed subjects of the Empire not by nationality, but by religion. During the nineteenth century, modern national consciousness began to increase among the south Slavs; some historians now believe that it was in this period that Catholic Bosnians increasingly began to think of themselves as Croats, and Orthodox Bosnians as Serbs. The beginnings of a Muslim Bosnian national consciousness is also first attested in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as these early Bosniak nationalists began to assert a national identity distinct from both their Orthodox and Catholic neighbors, and from the other Muslim inhabitants of the empire. Most Serb and Croat nationalists tend to deny a separate Bosniak national identity, claiming that Bosniaks were either Serb or Croat in origin, but of Islamic religion. This debate, whether Bosnia and the Bosniaks are really Croats, Serbs, or a separate Bosniak Bosnian nation, has energized debates among nationalists until the present day. Anthropologists find the nationalist statements on "Bosniak" origin rather irrational and ultimately undignified attention, since, with a few notable exceptions, the ethnicity and history of the dominated in communist and monarchy Yugoslavia has been prescribed by the dominators and by the general demographics of a region.

Like national identity in Bosnia and Herzegovina in general, Bosniak national identity is chiefly based on religion and communal feeling, as opposed to linguistic and/or physical differences from their neighbors. In that sense, the earliest foundation of modern Bosniak national development can be found as early as the beginning of the 18th century, as native Bosnian Muslims found themselves often fighting against the empire's enemies by their own (i.e. the Battle of [[Banja Luka]], where the city's garrison was composed entirely of Bosniaks). On top of present cultural uniqueness, by the first half of the 19th century upper class Bosniaks and intellectuals were already propagating what can be considered early Bosniak nationalism, by way of writing and politics, all of which would later lead to the Bosniak rebirth at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century.

==Nationalism==
{{main|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1878–1918)|Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire|Illyrian movement}}

Bosnia and Herzegovina was occupied and administered by [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1878, and a number of Bosniaks left Bosnia and Herzegovina. Official Austro-Hungarian records show that 56,000 people mostly Bosniaks emigrated between 1883 and 1920, but the number of Bosniak emigrants is probably much larger, as the official record doesn't reflect emigration before 1883, nor include those who left without permits. Most of the emigrants probably fled in fear of retribution after the intercommunal violence of the 1875–1878 uprising. Many Serbs from Herzegovina left for America during the same period. One geographer estimates that there are 350,000 Bosniaks in Turkey today, although that figure includes the descendants of Muslim South Slavs who emigrated from the [[Sandžak]] region during the [[First Balkan War]] and later. Another wave of Bosniak emigration occurred after the end of the [[World War I|First World War]], when Bosnia and Herzegovina became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]], known after 1929 as Yugoslavia.

Urban Bosniaks were particularly proud of their [[Multicultural|cosmopolitan]] culture, especially in the Bosnian capital, [[Sarajevo]], which was, until [[World War II]], home to thriving Bosniak, Serb, Croat, and Jewish communities. After 1945, Sarajevo became one of the most ethnically mixed cities in the former Yugoslavia.

Members of the 19th century [[Illyrian movement]], most notably [[Ivan Frano Jukic|Ivan Frano Jukić]], emphasized Bosniaks (''Bošnjaci'') alongside [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] as one of the "tribes" that constitutes the "Illyrian nation".

With the dawn of Illyrian movement, Bosniak intelligentsia gathered around magazine ''Bosnia'' in the 1860s which promoted the idea of a Bosniak nation. A member of this group was father of [[Safvet-beg Bašagić]], a [[Bosnians|Bosnian]] poet. The Bosniak group would remain active for several decades, with the continuity of ideas and the use of the archaic Bosniak name. From 1891 until 1910, they published a magazine titled ''Bosniak''. However, by the start of the 20th century, this group had all but died out, due to its most prominent members either dying or deciding for [[Croat]] identity.

The administration of [[Benjamin Kallay]], the [[Austria-Hungary|Austria-Hungarian]] governor of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], enforced the idea of a unitary ''[[Bosnians|Bosnian]] nation'' (''Bosanci'') that would include the Catholic and Orthodox Bosnians as well as Muslims. The idea was fiercely opposed by Croats and Serbs, but also by a number of Muslims. This policy further clouded the Bosnian ethnical issue and made the Bosniak group seem as pro-regime. After Kallays death in 1903, the official policy slowly drifted towards accepting the three-ethnical reality of Bosnia.

Muslim National Organization (MNO), a political party founded in 1906, was a major opponent of the regime and promoted the idea of Muslims as a separate entity from [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]]. A group of dissidents that, among other things, identified themselves with the Croat Muslim identity formed a party named Muslim Progressive Party (MNS), However, the party received little popular support and faded away over the next few years.

The first [[constitution]] of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] from 1910 explicitly mentioned [[Serbs]], [[Croats]] and [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] as the "native peoples". This was reflected in the elections held soon thereafter, when the electoral was divided into a Serb, Croat and Muslim ballot. MNO, Serb National Organization (SNO) and Croat National Community (HNZ) received almost unanimous support in their respective ballots, and their members formed the parliament, albeit this parliament had little power in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austria-Hungarian]] province of Bosnia and Herzegovina. All translations of the Constitution into native languages used lower-case M for Muslims as followers of Islam (This is because the proper nouns such as Muslim and Christian were and still are written in lowercase letters in Bosnian (Serbo-Croatian) language).

==20th century==
{{main|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1918–1941)|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1941–1945)|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1945–1992)|Bosnian War|}}
After the [[World War I]], Bosnia and Herzegovina became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] which later transformed into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. The Serb monarchy, being one of the victors of the World War, sought Croat and Slovene political parties as their partners when forming the country. MNO, reformed into the [[Yugoslav Muslim Organization]] (JMO), dropped the pursuit of Muslim national identity and focused on protecting the religious and existential issues of Muslims through [[coalition|coalescing]] with other parties, sometimes even with the Serbian parties such as [[Nikola Pašić]]'s [[People's Radical Party]] and [[Milan Stojadinović]]'s [[Yugoslavian Radical Community|Serbian Radical Party]].

In the 1921 census, only [[Serbs]], [[Croats]] and [[Slovenes]] were recognized as native nations or "tribes", and these were the only available options for ethnicity. The result was that a large number of Bosniaks simply left the field for ethnicity blank. This phenomenon, labeled ''nonethnical element'' (''nenarodni element''), was a topic of heated debate amongst scholars and politicians for years to follow. Some of them argued that the nonethnical element were descendants of the Turkish occupier and as such should be expelled. Nevertheless, thanks to the helpful influence of JMO, there were only isolated incidents of oppression against Bosniaks.

This political void was quickly filled with a number of opposition parties which recognized Muslims as a separate nation. Among them was the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]], as a document from the 1930s reveals. It's no coincidence that a large number of Bosnian Muslims joined the Communist Party, and later the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|partisans]], many of them becoming prominent political leaders and commandants.

During the [[World War II]], the authorities of the Nazi-puppet [[Independent State of Croatia]] tried to ally with the Bosniaks whom they considered to be "Muslim Croats" against the Serbs and other "undesirables". As a token, the [[Meštrović Pavilion|Artists Gallery museum]] (by [[Ivan Meštrović]]) in [[Zagreb]] was furnished with minarets and ceded to be used as a mosque.

The Declaration of the State Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ZAVNOBiH), issued on November 25 of 1943 by the partisan government, is widely considered to be the constitutional basis of the modern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. This document uses essentially the same wording as the 1910 Constitution. Furthermore, the Resolution of ZAVNOBiH states: "Today, the nations of Bosnia and Herzegovina, through their only political representative - the ZAVNOBiH, desire that their country, which is neither Serb, nor Croat nor Muslim, but Serb as well as Croat and Muslim, should be the free and united Bosnia and Herzegovina in which the full equality, legal and otherwise, of Serbs, Muslims and Croats will be guaranteed".

Unfortunately, this declaration was broken as soon as [[World War II]] was over, as the Constitution of the [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] (later [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]) mentioned [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]], but not [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]], as the native nations (''narodi''). In the Yugoslav census of 1948, 90% of Muslims in Yugoslavia declared themselves as "nationally undetermined". Furthermore, many who registered as Serbs or Croats did so largely out of societal and economic pressure. When the "Yugoslav, nationally undeclared" option became available in 1953, 900,000 people registered as such.

With a weakening of Serb dominance in Bosnian communist leadership, the door opened up for a new national identification. Finally in the 1961 Yugoslav census, the "Muslims in the ethnic sense" option first appeared. By 1963 Muslims were listed in the Bosnian constitution alongside Serbs and Croats. Finally, in 1968, "[[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]]" with a capital M was adopted as the term for a member of a nation rather than "Muslims" as adherents to Islam.

The decision wasn't greeted without debate among communist leadership, but Bosniaks had made themselves clear. "Practice has shown the harm of different forms of pressure," read a communique issued by the Bosnian Central Committee, "from the earlier period when Muslims were designated as Serbs or Croats from the national viewpoint. It has been shown, and present socialist practice confirms, that the Muslims are a distinct nation".

[[File:Ethnic Composition of BiH in 1991.gif|thumb|310px|right|Composition of ethnic Bosniaks within Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1991 prior to the war.]]

From then until the [[Yugoslav wars]], Bosniak national identity continued to develop with two different philosophies forming. These breakthroughs in the 60s were not carried out by religious Muslims (in fact, they were headed chiefly by secular Muslim communists) but in the following decades two separate schools of thought emerged. The first, was a secular "Muslim Nationalism" (as supported by people such as [[Hamdija Pozderac]]), and the second was a separate revival of Islamic religious belief (a reaction to communist-sponsored secularism and advocated by people such as [[Alija Izetbegović]]). The effects of these two separate ideas on what exactly Bosnian Muslims are that have also occasionally clashed can be seen to this day.

In September 1993, the Congress of Bosniak Intellectuals&lt;ref&gt;Bosnian: Drugi bošnjački sabor&lt;/ref&gt; re-introduced the historical ethnic name ''Bosniaks'' instead of the previously used [[Muslim by nationality]]. Other ethnic groups (Serbs and Croats) objected to the name as a ploy to monopolize the history of Bosnia and make them seem to be foreign invaders (see [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]). The term in itself means ''Bosnians'' and is an archaic term that was once used for all inhabitants of Bosnia regardless of faith. Bosniaks counter by pointing out that ''Bosniak'' is the historical term for their nation, and that had they truly wanted to "monopolize" Bosnian history it would have been far easier to use the "newer" version "''Bosanci''" which, however, has a somewhat different meaning.

Since the 1990s, the name has been adopted outside of Bosnia itself, onto the Slavic Muslim population of other former Yugoslav republics such as [[Serbia]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. It allows a Bosniak/Bosnian distinction to match the Serb/Serbian and Croat/Croatian distinctions between ethnicity and residence.

'''Iraj Bashiri''' (born July 31, 1940) is Professor of History at the [[University of Minnesota]], United States and one of the leading scholars in the fields of [[Central Asia]]n Studies and [[Iran]]ian Studies. Fluent in English, [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Tajik language|Tajik]] and several [[Turkic languages]], Bashiri has been able to study and translate works otherwise inaccessible to the mostly [[Russian language|Russian-speaking]] Central Asian studies community. Bashiri career focus started on [[Iran]], and engaged also with [[Central Asia]], notably the [[Tājik people|Tajik]] identity and the relations between Tajiks and the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people of Central Asia, namely the [[Uzbeks]].

== Biography ==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:IrajBashiri1953wiki.jpg|thumb|Iraj Bashiri around the year 1953.]] --&gt;
Iraj Bashiri was born on July 31, 1940, in [[Behbahan]], [[Iran]]. He completed his early education in the towns of Damaneh and Daran in Fereydan and his high school in [[Isfahan]] and [[Shiraz]].

He graduated in 1961 with a diploma in mathematics from Haj Qavam High School in [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]]. While in high school, Bashiri showed a distinct talent for the English language. In 1959, he emerged from the national competitions held at Ramsar as Iran's top student in English.  Between 1960 and 1963, Bashiri studied English Language and Literature at [[Pahlavi University]] (present-day Shiraz University) and in 1963 graduated at the top of his class. While studying at Pahlavi, he also worked as a regional reporter for the Kayhan Daily in the Fars province and taught English at the British Council in Shiraz and English literature at Pahlavi University.

[[File:IrajBashiri1965wiki.jpg|thumb|Iraj Bashiri around 1965.]]
In 1964, Bashiri left Iran to study English Literature in the United Kingdom and, in 1966, he traveled to the United States to continue his education. In 1968, he received his M.A. degree in General Linguistics from the [[University of Michigan]] and, in 1972, his Ph.D. in Iranian Linguistics from the same University. Bashiri's dissertation is based on Ibn Sina's concept of Existence (budan). He shows that the Persian verb budan (to be) has its own syntax. This syntax in the context of the concept of Becoming (shodan) expresses transition, and in the context of Doing (kardan) expresses action.

In the United States, too, in addition to studying linguistics, Bashiri taught Persian at the University of Michigan and trained Peace Corps volunteers in Vermont, New York, and New Jersey. In 1972, he was employed as a Visiting Assistant Professor of Iranian and Turkish Languages and Literatures at the University of Minnesota. During his early years at Minnesota, he used the theoretical framework that he had developed in his dissertation as the base for writing Persian for Beginners. This book, which has been revised four times, is available in both English and Russian languages. Bashiri was promoted to Associate Professor in 1977 and to Professor in 1996.

Bashiri is currently a professor of history at the [[University of Minnesota]]. Professor Bashiri's courses at Minnesota include Iranian history (from ancient to modern times), Persian Literature (poetry and prose), and Iranian Languages and Linguistics. He also has developed and taught courses on the history of the peoples of Central Asia and Afghanistan. In 1980, he was recognized as one of the College of Liberal Arts' Distinguished Teachers.

Bashiri has traveled extensively in Iran and Central Asia, including stints as a visiting scholar in [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan]]. Bashiri has also worked closely with the Tajik division of [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]].

While teaching at the University of Minnesota, Bashiri also taught and carried out research at other universities including the [[University of Michigan]], the [[University of Texas]] at Austin, the State University of Kyrgyzstan, and the Academy of Sciences of Kazakhstan.

Finally, while carrying out research and teaching, Prof. Bashiri has also been involved in the administration of his home University. Between 1975 and 1979, he was the head of the Middle East Studies Department and later the South Asian Studies Department at the University of Minnesota. Several times between 1987 and 2005, he was the Chair of, first, the Russian and East European Studies, and later the Slavic and Central Asian Languages and Literatures. He also has been active in College committees, especially in relation to curricula. In 2005, he was both the Head of the College of Liberal Arts Assembly and the Head of the Executive Council of the College. Currently, he is the Interim Director of the Institute of Linguistics, English as a Second Language and Slavic Languages and Literatures.

Bashiri is married to Carol L. Sayers and together they have three children and five grandchildren. His hobbies include writing realist fiction, fishing, and painting Central Asian and Iranian rural life.

'''Johan Widekindi''' (c. 1619 &amp;ndash; 24 December 1675) was a Swedish historian and academic.

==Biography==
Widekindi was born between 1618 and 1620 to a priestly family. His father was Widich Larsson (Latin: Widichinnus Laurentii), a vicar in Bro, [[Västmanland]]. His mother was Sara Olofsdotter, a sister of [[Johan Stiernhöök]]. His brothers took the name Pontelius after their birthplace.

He was a student at [[Uppsala University]] in 1640 and also lectured there as a Latin orator. After a trip abroad, he was hired in 1655 as eloquentiæ lecturer at Stockholm High School, and almost at the same time he was given the task of organizing Axel Oxenstierna libraries and archives. A wealth of documents from the 16th and 17th centuries attracted Widekindi to historical writings, and began a work to write a history of events between Poland and Sweden from the time of [[John III of Sweden|John III]] to his own time.

This project was given approval by [[Charles X of Sweden|Charles X]] after he presented it in Copenhagen in 1659 and again Gothenburg for further deliberation, but the king's death left Widekindi without help. He soon found a patron in Chancellor Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie, which among other things provided him power of attorney. Sweden then had three historiographers, namely Bogislaus Philipp von Chemnitz, Johannes Loccenius and Widekindi. After being granted any historical tables, ''Lumen chronographicum'' (1664–66), he seized undertake to, at the pleasure of the Chancellor, depicting [[Jacob De la Gardie]] "commendable actioner in Muscovite War", but produced at the same time (November 1666) the desire to write the history of Sweden from Gustav Vasa's death and ''continuera Seriem rerum'', "unto our time." On October 28, 1668 was given him the royal command to write a complete history of the "gustavianske Vasa kings" to [[Gustavus Adolphus]] German expedition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5802">'''The Earl of Leicester's Men''' was a [[playing company]] or troupe of actors in [[English Renaissance theatre]], active mainly in the 1570s and 1580s in the reign of [[Queen Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. In many respects, it was the major company in Elizabethan drama of its time, and established the pattern for the companies that would follow: it was the first to be awarded a royal patent, and the first to occupy one of the new public theatres on a permanent basis.

{{TOC right}}

==Beginnings==
[[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]] had kept players as early as 1559; they can be traced through the 1560s and into the 1570s by the records of their performances in various English cities as they toured the country. When the Elizabethan Poor Laws were amended by the Act of 1572, the status of travelling players was affected: those who did not possess sponsorship from a nobleman could be classed as vagabonds and subjected to a range of penalties. Conversely, however, those who enjoyed such sponsorship were legally more secure than they had previously been. A surviving letter to Leicester from his actors, dated 3 January 1572 and written by [[James Burbage]] for the company, requests that the actors be appointed not merely the Earl's liveried retainers but also his "household servants"&amp;mdash;a distinction that enabled them to come and go in [[London]] without restriction. The letter also specifies that the actors would not expect any direct financial support, "any further stipend or benefit," from the Earl; they wanted to enjoy his legal protection while operating as an independent commercial entity, a model that subsequent companies would follow.

The 1572 letter was signed by Burbage, John Perkin, John Laneham, William Johnson, [[Robert Wilson (dramatist)|Robert Wilson]], and Thomas Clarke. The first five men are also listed on the royal patent of 10 May 1574, the first royal patent granted to any company of players after the Act of 1572. The Queen's warrant authorized the company "to use, exercise, and occupy the art and faculty of playing comedies, tragedies, interludes, stage plays and other such like...as well within our city of London and liberties of the same, as also within the liberties and freedoms of any our cities, towns, boroughs etc. whatsoever...throughout our Realm of England."&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Kerchever Chambers|E. K. Chambers]], ''The Elizabethan Stage,'' 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 2, pp. 87-8; spellings modernized.&lt;/ref&gt;

The warrant granted to Leicester's Men had one other crucial aspect: it cancelled earlier policies that allowed local officials to censure or disallow plays. Under the new policy, this power was vested only in the royal bureaucracy, through the [[Lord Chamberlain]] and his [[Master of the Revels]]. Once the players had the Master's approval for their plays, they could act them anywhere in England without local censorship. The warrant in effect gave the company, and those that would follow later, the freedom to create English Renaissance drama.

==Success==
Leicester's Men performed at Court over the Christmas holidays in both 1574 and 1575. As Leicester's servants, the company also had a central role in Dudley's entertainments of Queen Elizabeth at his castle at [[Kenilworth]] in [[Warwickshire]] in 1566, 1572, and 1575. The last of these was especially noteworthy: it lasted from July 9 through July 27; its main device was ''The Delivery of the Lady of the Lake.'' Since Kenilworth lies only twelve miles northeast of [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], it is possible that an eleven-year-old [[William Shakespeare]] was among the crowds that witnessed the event; he may later have referred to its image of "Arion on the dolphin's back" in ''[[Twelfth Night]],'' I,ii,15.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. E. Halliday]] ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564&amp;ndash;1964,'' Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

When James Burbage and his brother-in-law John Brayne built [[The Theatre]], the first successful commercial public theatre in England, in [[1576 in literature|1576]], Leicester's was the company that occupied its stage when performances began in the autumn of that year. The period from 1576 to 1583 was the apex of the company's fortunes.

==Decline==
In 1583, the foundation of a new company, [[Queen Elizabeth's Men]], stripped Leicester's Men of its three most talented and prominent members, Robert Wilson, John Laneham, and [[Richard Tarlton]]. (William Johnson may also have joined the Queen's Men at this time or soon after.) It is thought that Leicester's company was rifled of its best men deliberately, to tamp down the rivalry between Leicester and the [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford]] as they expressed it through their competing companies of actors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew John Gurr|Andrew Gurr]], ''The Shakespearean Stage 1574&amp;ndash;1642,'' Third edition, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1992; pp. 28, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Leicester's Men never fully recovered their former prominence and prestige after 1583.

Still, the company persevered: it was on tour in 1584 and '85. In the latter year the Earl of Leicester was appointed commander of the English troops in The [[Netherlands]]; his progress through [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], [[Leyden]] and [[The Hague]] was noted for the lavish pageants that were enacted in his honor. At least one member of Leicester's Men, [[William Kempe]], accompanied the Earl to Holland; others also may have made the journey. The company was touring again through the 1586&amp;ndash;88 period, and performed at Court in December 1586.

With the Earl's death in 1588 Leicester's Men passed out of existence. Kempe and some other members went on to work with other companies.

'''The Leipzig Meuten''', (die Meuten meaning 'packs' in [[German language|German]]) were [[anti-Nazi]] gangs of children, teenagers and young adults based in [[Leipzig]] during the [[Nazi]] period of [[Germany]], who aimed to destroy Nazi Control. They were similar to the [[Edelweiss Pirates]], but more politically driven. 

== Members ==
Members came from working class families and borrowed from [[socialist]] and [[communist]] traditions. Between 1937 and 1939, die Meuten in Leipzig had, according to the Gestapo, an estimated 1500 members.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hitler Youth|last=Kater|first=Michael H.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0674019911|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The Meuten became active in Leipzig around 1937, and such as members of ''Blasen'' they were blue collar workers, apprentices and shop clerks. When they were not congregating in cinemas, public swimming pools, or formerly Communist neighborhood pubs, they liked to hike and discuss politics. There are reports of die Meuten in [[Dresden]] and other [[Saxony|Saxon]] towns for certain, but the records of the activity is incredibly scarce.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Clothing ===
The group wore motley clothes, with the males wearing plaid shirts, white socks and [[Lederhosen]] in the summer, and slalom shirts and ski pants in the winter. Females wore long blue skirts of the traditional youth movement. Red kerchiefs were used as pro-left sympathies were also seen in the group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Communist leanings ==
The group had [[Communism|Communist]] roots and listened to [[Radio Moscow]] and stretched the customary ''bündisch bias'' for everything Russian, while romanticizing the conditions in the [[Soviet Union]]. The group also used a vulgarized Russian greeting of "bud cadoff" instead of "[[Nazi salute|Heil Hitler]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The group held strong [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] and [[Communist Party of Germany|KPD]] roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brodsky|first=Patricia P.|date=April 1998|title=The Hidden War: Working-Class Resistance during the Third Reich and the Postwar Suppression of Its History|url=https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/149982/nst112a.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y#page=43|journal=Nature, Society and Thought|volume=11|pages=171-185|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nazi reaction ==
They were dealt with ruthlessly by the Nazis. 
 
A group of members were convicted in October 1938 and sentenced to between one and five years of incarceration, due to the Meuten being connected to Communism and at the time Germany held legislation that forbade the resurrection of any of the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] political parties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Memorials ==
There is a permanent exhibition commemorating them at the Leipzig School Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Leipziger Meuten - Jugendopposition 1933 - 1945|url=http://www.schulmuseum-leipzig.de/html/meuten.html|publisher=Schulmuseum - Werkstatt für Schulgeschichte Leipzig|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group is also included in the [[Memorial to the German Resistance]] in Berlin, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geerling|first=Wayne|date=August 2013|title=Face of Opposition: Juvenile Resistance, High Treason and the People's Court in Nazi Germany|url=file:///C:/Users/Gift%20Shop/Downloads/JINH_a_00537-Geerling_proof1.pdf|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History|volume=|pages=|via=|access-date=2018-09-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812155911/http://c/|archive-date=2013-08-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A History of the Diocese of Cork: From the earliest times to the Reformation. Irish University Press, 1972. p.&lt;/ref&gt; was a historian from Cork county. Between 1938 and 1966 he published a number of articles concerning Early Medieval history of Ireland and local history of Cork in the ''Journal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society'' (JCHAS).
His works were a considerable contribution to the field of Early Medieval history of Ireland. Most of them, especially his long article "Contributions towards the political history of Munster, 450–800 A.D." are still widely quoted and discussed by major scholars, including F.J. Byrne, T.M. Charles-Edwards, P. Ó Riain. A compendium of his articles was published locally in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Irish Historical &amp; Archaeological Researches: Collected works of Liam O'Buachalla.

== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of Lubumbashi}}

===Élisabethville under Belgian rule===
The Belgian government established the modern-day government in the city of ''Élisabethville'' (sometimes Elizabethville, both in French, or Elisabethstad in Dutch) in 1910, named in honour of their queen [[Elisabeth of Bavaria (1876–1965)|Elisabeth]], wife to king Albert I. By that time, the government had taken over the colony from King Leopold II, and renamed it as the [[Belgian Congo]]. This site was chosen by Vice-Governor-General Emile Wangermée because of its proximity to the copper mine of ''[[Etoile du Congo Mine|Etoile du Congo]]'' and the copper ore smelting oven installed by [[Union Minière du Haut Katanga]] on the nearby Lubumbashi river.
The Comité Spécial du Katanga (CSK), a semi-private concessionary company set up in 1906, had its headquarters in Elisabethville throughout the colonial era. It enjoyed major privileges, mainly in terms of land and mining concessions, in the Katanga province.

The city prospered with the development of a regional copper mining industry.&lt;ref&gt;Brion, R. and J.-L. Moreau (2006), ''De la mine à Mars, La genèse d'Umicore'', Tielt : Lannoo.&lt;/ref&gt; Huge investments in the 1920s, both in the mining industry and in transport infrastructure (railline Elisabethville-Port Francqui and Elisabethville-Dilolo), developed the Katanga province into one of the world's major copper ore producers. The population of the city grew apace from approx. 30,000 in 1930, to 50,000 in 1943 and 180,000 in 1957. It was the second city of the [[Belgian Congo]], after Léopoldville.

[[File:Belgian Neighborhood, Lubumbashi, DRC.jpg|thumb|The Belgian Quarter in Lubumbashi]]

As was customary in sub-Saharan colonies, the city centre of Elisabethville was reserved for the white (European) population. This consisted mainly of Belgian nationals, but the city also attracted important British and Italian communities, as well as [[History of the Jews in Greece|Jewish Greeks]]. Congolese were allowed in the white city only during the day, except for the house servants ("boys") who often lived in shanty dwellings ("boyeries") located in the backyards of the European city houses.
Many men in the black population were labour immigrants from neighbouring regions in the Belgian Congo (Northern Katanga, Maniema, Kasaï), from Belgian Rwanda and Burundi, and from British Northern Rhodesia (Zambia).&lt;ref&gt;Fetter, Bruce (1976), ''The Creation of Elisabethville, 1910–1940'', Stanford: Hoover Institution Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The black population lived initially in a so-called ''cité indigène'' called quartier Albert (now: Kamalondo), south of the city centre and separated from the white city by a 700-metres-wide neutral zone. With population growth, new indigenous quarters were created. These still form the main suburbs of present-day Lubumbashi: Kenia, Katuba, Ruashi. The work and businesses related to the mines made Elisabethville the most prosperous region of the Congo during the final decade of Belgian rule. In 1954 there were 8,000 black home owners in the city while thousands more were skilled workers. It was estimated that black Africans living in Elisabethville had a higher standard of living than anywhere else on the continent at that time.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunther,''Inside Africa,'' Hamish Hamilton Ltd. London, 1955,  page 640&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lubumbashi Palais de Justice 2.jpg|thumb|right|Lubumbashi: 1920s Palace of Justice]]

Miners in Élisabethville conducted a strike in December 1941 to protest the increasingly severe forced-labor regime that the Belgians imposed on the population because of the "war efforts".&lt;ref&gt;Dibwe dia Mwembu, Donatien (2001), ''Histoire des conditions de vie des travailleurs de l'Union Minière du Haut-Katanga et Gécamines, 1910–1999'', Lubumbashi : Presses Universitaires de Lubumbashi.&lt;/ref&gt; A rally in the Union Minière football stadium got out of hand. Police opened fire and numerous protesters were killed. In early 1944, the city was again in the grip of severe tensions and fear of violent protests, following a mutiny of the [[Force Publique]] (army) in Luluabourg.&lt;ref&gt;Rubens, Antoine (1945), ''Dettes de guerre'', Lubumbashi: L'essor du Congo.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1933, the Belgian colonial authorities experimented with a limited form of self-governance by establishing the cité indigène of Elisabethville as a so-called "centre extra-coutumier" (a centre not subject to customary law). It was administered by an indigenous council and presided over by an indigenous chief. But, due to constant interference from the Belgian authorities, the experiment soon proved a failure.&lt;ref&gt;Grévisse, F. (1951), ''Le Centre Extra-Coutumier d’Elisabethville'', Elisabethville-Bruxelles: CEPSI-Institut Royal Colonial Belge.&lt;/ref&gt; The first indigenous chief – Albert Kabongo – appointed in 1937, was dismissed in 1943 and not replaced.

In 1957 Elisabethville was established as a fully autonomous city; it held the first free municipal elections in which the Congolese could vote. The people of Élisabethville gave a vast majority to the nationalist [[Alliance des Bakongo]], which demanded immediate independence from Belgium.

Elisabethville functioned as the administrative capital of the Katanga province. It was also an important commercial and industrial centre, and a centre of education and health services. The [[Benedictine Order]] and missionary [[Order of Salesians]] offered a wide range of educational facilities to Europeans and Congolese alike, including vocational training (Kafubu). The Belgians established the University of Élisabethville in 1954–1955 (now the [[University of Lubumbashi]]).

=== Lubumbashi from 1960 ===
Élisabethville served as the capital and centre of the secessionist independent state of [[State of Katanga#Secession|Katanga]] during the 1960–1963 Congolese civil war. [[Moise Tshombe]] proclaimed Katangan independence in July 1960.  Congolese leaders arrested him and charged him with treason in April 1961; however, he agreed to dismiss his foreign advisers and military forces in exchange for his release.  Tshombe returned to Élisabethville but repudiated these assurances and began to fight anew.  United Nations troops opposed Katangan forces and took control of the city in December 1961 under a strong mandate. [[Roger Trinquier]], well known for his published works on counter-insurgency warfare, served as a French military advisor to President Tshombe until international pressure, led by Belgium, caused his recall to France.

[[Mobutu Sese Seko]] ultimately assumed power of the Congo, which he renamed Zaïre. He renamed Élisabethville as "Lubumbashi" in 1966 and, in 1972 renamed Katanga as "Shaba."

In May 1990, the university campus of Lubumbashi was the scene of a brutal killing among students by Mobutu's security forces. In 1991–92 ethnic tensions between the Luba from Katanga and the Luba from Kasaï, resident in the city, led to violent confrontations and the forced removal from the city of the latter.

Congo entered another genocidal civil war in the late 1990s.  The [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo]] rebels captured Lubumbashi in April 1997. Rebel leader [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]] spoke from Lubumbashi to declare himself president of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] on 17 May 1997 after Mobutu Sese Seko fled Kinshasa.

When Laurent-Désiré Kabila decided to appoint a transitional parliament, in 1999, he decided to install the Parliament in Lubumbashi, in order to consolidate the fragile unity of the country. The parliament was installed in the building of the National Assembly of secessionist Katanga (the former city theatre), which had its capital in this city as well, in the 1960s. Lubumbashi was therefore the Legislative capital of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] from 1999 to 2003, when all the country's central institutions were brought back to Kinshasa.

On 7 September 2010 a large prison break happened in Lubumbashi after gunmen attacked a prison on the outskirts of the city. 960 prisoners managed to escape, including the [[Mai-Mai]] leader [[Gédéon Kyungu Mutanga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39478&amp;Cr=democratic&amp;Cr1=congo |date=7 September 2011 |accessdate=8 September 2011 |title=UN voices concern after mass prison outbreak in DR Congo |publisher=UN News Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 March 2013 a militia group of 100 fighters attacked Lubumbashi and seized a United Nations compound, which was surrounded by Congolese soldiers and members of the president's Republican Guard.&lt;ref name=BloombergKavanagh /&gt;

== Religion ==
The city was the seat since 1910 of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Apostolic Prefecture of Katanga]], which became the [[Apostolic Vicariate of Katanga]] in 1932. The first apostolic vicar, Mgr {{ill|Jean-Félix de Hemptinne|fr}}, occupied this post until his death in 1958. He is buried in the city's [[Sts. Peter and Paul Cathedral, Lubumbashi|Sts. Peter and Paul Cathedral]]. In 1959, the till then exempt missionary jurisdiction was promoted to [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Elisabethville]], renamed Lubumbashi in 1966, chief of one of the republic's six [[ecclesiastical province]]s.

Small numbers of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] are present in the city.&lt;ref name="Rorison"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rorison|first1=Sean|title=Congo: Democratic Republic, Republic|date=22 May 2008|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|location=Chalfont St. Peter, Buckinghamshire, UK|isbn=1841622338|pages=13–15|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Kimbangu]], founder of [[Kimbanguism]], an African [[Christianity|Christian]] sect, was imprisoned near Lubumbashi (then Elizabethville) for about three decades after organizing mass protests.&lt;ref name="Rorison" /&gt;

[[Jews|Jewish people]] arrived in Lubumbashi along with other Europeans. In 1930 a synagogue was erected in the city. Most of the few hundred Jews remaining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo reside in Lubumbashi.&lt;ref name="Rorison" /&gt;

In 2013, the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] released an hour-and-a-half-long video in five languages entitled ''Frontiers of Learning'', showing [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] community-building activities for people of all religions taking place in four cities from different continents, the second of which was Lubumbashi.&lt;ref name="frontiers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frontiers of Learning|url=http://www.bahai.org/frontiers/|website=Bahai.org|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
:''See also: {{illm|List of communes of Lubumbashi|fr|Liste des communes de Lubumbashi}}''
Lubumbashi lies at around {{Convert|1208|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. The high altitude serves to cool the climate, which would otherwise be very hot. The [[Kafue River]] rises along the Zambian border near the city and meanders through north-central [[Zambia]] to the [[Zambezi River]], cutting a long, deep, panhandle into the country.

===Climate===
Lubumbashi has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cwa'', according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]), with warm rainy summers and pleasant, dry winters, with most rainfall occurring during summer and early autumn. Annual average rainfall is 1,238&amp;nbsp;mm (48.75 inches).

== Economy ==
Lubumbashi serves as an important commercial and national industrial centre. Manufactures include [[textiles]], food products and beverages, [[printing]], bricks, and copper smelting. The city is home to the Simba brewery, producing the famous Tembo beer.

The city hosts the headquarters of one of the country's largest banks, [[Trust Merchant Bank]].  The airline [[Korongo Airlines]], a joint-venture between [[Brussels Airlines]] and the Belgian multinational Groupe George Forrest International, also maintains its head office in Lubumbashi. The area also has a daily newspaper.

[[File:Lubumbashi Storefront.jpg|thumb|Storefronts in Lubumbashi]]

===Mining===
Lubumbashi, the mining capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is a base for many of the country's biggest mining companies. The Democratic Republic of Congo produces "more than 3 percent of the world's copper and half its [[cobalt]], most of which comes from Katanga."&lt;ref name=BloombergKavanagh /&gt;

== Transport ==

===Rail===
Lubumbashi lies at the centre of railway lines to [[Ilebo]], [[Kindu]], [[Sakania]] and [[Kolwezi]]. In the 1960s, the section from [[Mutshatsha Territory|Mutshatsha]] to Lubumbashi was electrified at [[25 kV AC]].

===Air===
Lubumbashi is home to the modern [[Lubumbashi International Airport]]. The city serves as a distribution centre for such minerals as copper, [[cobalt]], [[zinc]], [[tin]], and coal.

[[File:Lubumbashi Motorcycles.jpg|thumb|Motorcycles in Lubumbashi]]

== Sites and tourism ==
Attractions in the city include a [[botanical garden]], a [[zoo]], and the regional archaeological and ethnological [[National Museum of Lubumbashi]]. Some of the most prominent examples of colonial architecture, such as the [[art-déco]] style Palace of Justice, the Grand Hotel, or the Catholic cathedral St Pierre et Paul, have been restored since the late 20th century.

The city hosts the major [[University of Lubumbashi]], which maintains a library.

[[File:University of Lubumbashi.jpg|thumb|University of Lubumbashi]]

===Zoo===
The zoo of Lubumbashi is one of the most visited tourist attractions. It was created during the colonial period, and is considered the nicest zoo in the country. During the years of war, it deteriorated but it has been rehabilitated by AZLU, a non-profit organization. By 2007, great animals had been acquired for the zoo.  AZLU is keeping the zoo “for education purposes, and the protection of the natural heritage of the country,” as it can be read on signs. Today, it has almost been restocked with lions, tigers, monkeys, apes, pelicans, wart hogs, crocodiles, snakes, turtles, monitor lizards, eagles, parrots, ostriches, gazelles, etc. Apart from animals, the zoo features a restaurant, a veterinary center, and a termite museum.

===Parks and farms===
Muyambo Kyasa popularized the concept of parks. Muyambo Park opened in 2010. Located about 15&amp;nbsp;km from Lubumbashi, it is a large garden where children can play games, and adults relax. Other parks (or farms) include Mikembo and Futuka (once a reserve, now closed) on Kasenga Road in the city’s outskirts.

== Culture ==

=== Language(s) ===
[[French language|French]] is the official language, but the main spoken [[lingua franca]] in Lubumbashi is [[Kiswahili]]. The dialect of Kiswahili spoken all down the east side of Congo (including the provinces of [[North Kivu]], [[South Kivu]], [[Maniema]], [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] and [[Oriental]], Western [[Kasai-Occidental|Kasai]] and Eastern [[Kasai-Oriental|Kasai]]) and almost all the way across to the [[Katanga Province|Katangan]] border with [[Angola]] is called [[Kingwana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~kkasongo/Kingwana.htm|title=Kingwana|website=facultystaff.richmond.edu|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many people have moved into Lubumbashi for employment from rural areas, they have brought many other local languages including [[Kiluba]], [[Chokwe language|Chokwe]], [[Bemba language|Bemba]] and Kisanga. Kiswahili has been the chief language shared by most people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifeinlubumbashi.blogspot.com/2010/07/fancy-fountain.html|title=Fancy fountain!|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
B. Jewsiewicki says that contemporary Lubumbashi art making is weak, especially when compared to the Kinshasan. He writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;“No Lubumbashi popular painter has had an international career like that of the Kinshasa artist Chéri Samba, and there are in fact a number of artists and musicians in Kinshasa whom the whirlwind of international success has whisked farther from local audiences than any artist in Lubumbashi, and not only in Lubumbashi but in the surrounding province of Katanga.” &lt;ref&gt;Brassinne, J. and Kestergat, J. (1991). ''Qui a tué Patrice Lumumba?'' Paris : Duculot. P 141. {{ISBN|2-8011-0979-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He names painters like Pilipili, Mwenze, Angali, Nkulu wa Nkulu, Maka, Tshimbumba, Dekab, and others.

===Cinema===
Ciné Bétamax, formerly “Ciné Palace” and “Ciné Eden”,&lt;ref&gt;Jewsiewicki, B. (1999). ''A Congo Chronicle: Patrice Lumumba in Urban Art''. New York: The Museum for African Art. P 13. {{ISBN|0-945802-25-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; are the only modern movie theaters in the city. They generally show popular recent [[Hollywood]] productions as well as NC-17 films. However, they also show movies about Congolese and African recent history like ''[[Mister Bob]],'' ''[[Sniper: Reloaded]],'' ''[[SEAL Team 8: Behind Enemy Lines]],'' and ''[[Tears of the Sun]].'' Before films, they both showed Congolese and international music videos, and US wrestling. Ciné Bétamax primarily addresses the young adults of Lubumbashi. Children are exposed to huge NC-17 posters, but seldom get in. The communication department of the University of Lubumbashi has collaborated with the movie theater to show students’ films.

Ciné Bétamax in particular also screens great football matches, and local singers’ concerts and Christian meetings are regularly held here. All over the city, especially in crowded neighborhoods, are spread small rooms in which children are exposed to violent movies from morning to night.

Nigeria's [[Nollywood]] films are also, as in many other parts of the DRC and Africa, popular among the residents. These films are often sold on VCD and DVD platforms.

===Music===
The popular music from Kinshasa is much appreciated and played in Lubumbashi. Jean-Bosco Mwenda is likely the most famous Katangese musician. Many of his songs have become classical, and are endlessly remixed by new young artists. Modern Lubumbashi singers fall into two groups: those who play Soukous, such as Jo Kizi and Képi Prince, and those who play international urban music, such as Ced Koncept, Tshumani, M-Joe, RJ Kanyera, Oxygène, Agresivo, Nelson Tshi, and Da Costa on the other. Most artists are influenced by successful [[Dj Spilulu]]'s productions,  Kinshasa singers Fally Ipupa, Ferre Gola and [[World music|World Music]].

Lubumbashi music is characterized by the use of many languages (Swahili, Lingala, Tshiluba, French and some English) in the lyrics. It is rare to hear songs composed in only one language. This code switching and mixing expresses the cosmopolitan character of the city, but some critics think it weakens the lyrics, which seem to be particularly made for teenagers anyway. Serge Manseba and Karibyona are humorist-singers featured by [[Dj Spilulu]] G'Sparks.

===French cultural influence===
The “Institut Français” (formally known as “Centre Culturel Français”), located in the heart of the city, contributes a great deal to the cultural and artistic life of Lubumbashi. Students and researchers spend time in its library; it shows European and other French-language films; produces plays and other shows in its theater; and features local singers’ records for sale on display at the entrance.

===Okapi Radio’s cultural participation===
Okapi Radio’s Lubumbashi presenters participate each Saturday evening in ''“métissage,”'' the cultural program of the radio. The whole country is informed of the cultural activities in the city.

== Media ==

===National channel (RTNC/Katanga)===
RTNC (Congolese National Radio and Television) has a provincial station located in Lubumbashi district at the junction of Lubilanshi and Sandoa. It has been very influential from the 1960s to the mid-1990s, at the end of the one-party system, and before the information technology revolution.

===Independent channels===
Zenith Radio, the first independent radio station in the city, started broadcasting in 1996; since then numerous radio and television stations have been established. They can be classified in three groups: religious channels (Zenith, RTIV, Cannal de Vie, RNS, etc.), commercial channels (RTA, Mwangaza, Nyota, RTLJ, Malaïka, Kyondo, etc.), and mixed ones like Wantanshi Radio and Television.

== Sports ==

===Football===
Football in Lubumbashi is the most popular sport. Lubumbashi is home to [[association football|football]] clubs of the top national level such as [[FC Saint Eloi Lupopo]], [[CS Don Bosco]] and [[TP Mazembe]] which is the most successful club in national competitions and the most successful congolese club in international football achieving 5 [[CAF Champions League|Africa's Champions League]] and a final of a [[FIFA Club World Cup]]. Chairman of Mazembe is the former governor of the province of Katanga [[Moïse Katumbi Chapwe]].

Until 1960 Congolese football was divided between whites-only and blacks-only leagues and competitions. In 1911 was founded in Elisabethville the whites-only Ligue de Football du Katanga organising in 1925 the first official edition of the local championship called the B. Smith Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesk/katanga.html|title=DR Congo (Zaire) - Katanga Champions|website=www.rsssf.com|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously were played blacks-only regionals tournaments in the country divided by 3 regionals tournaments with the [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] tournament being won by Lubumbashi's teams in all the registered editions but 2005.

In 1950, the 'black' Elisabethville Football Association (FASI, Fédérations et Associations Sportives Indigènes) had over 30 affiliated clubs competing in four leagues divided over 3 divisions. Both black and white tournaments in Lubumbashi and the country were played simultaneously until 1960 when were unificated. Since then the traditionally black clubs were dominators of the both local and national football.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesz/zaire-regchamp.html#kat|title=Congo-Kinshasa (DR Congo; formerly Zaire) - Regional Champions|website=www.rsssf.com|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  'black' Ligue de Football du Elisabethville and after Ligue de Football du Lubumbashi is the city's football tournament organized from 1960 by the city's federation EFLU.

FC Saint-Eloi Lupopo won the EFLU league 25 times in all up to 2003 being the most successful club of the known editions but other seasons are not known.

In 1950, the 'black' Elisabethville Football Association (FASI, Fédérations et Associations Sportives Indigènes) had over 30 affiliated clubs competing in four leagues divided over 3 divisions. Both black and white tournaments in Lubumbashi and the country were played simultaneously until 1960 when were unificated. Since then the traditionally black clubs were dominators of the both local and national football.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Basketball===
Basketball players [[Myck Kabongo]] and [[Bismack Biyombo]] are from Lubumbashi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/grantland/story/_/id/6679686/your-deal|title=What's Your Deal?

'''Ludwig Chronegk''' (3 November 1837, [[Brandenburg an der Havel]] – 8 July 1891, [[Meiningen]]) was a German actor and director. He headed the [[Meiningen Ensemble]] and reformed theatre direction principles.

== Life ==
Chronegk came from a mercantile family and was educated in the [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]s in [[Berlin]] and [[Potsdam]] before going to study the French theatre in [[Paris]] for a year. On his return to Germany, he was inspired to begin a career on the stage by [[Karl August Görner]]. He acted his first role in 1856 at the Krollschen Theater in Berlin. A member of the Meininger Hoftheater until 1866, Chronegk also appeared in or at [[Legnica|Liegnitz]] and [[Görlitz]], various theatres in Berlin, the [[Thalia Theater (Hamburg)|Hamburg Thalia]], the theatres in [[Pest (city)|Pest]], [[Breslau]], [[Königsberg (Prussia)|Königsberg]] and the [[Leipzig]] Stadttheater.

In 1874 Chronegk officially began work as a director. He gave up his acting work in 1877 – he had been seen in all the comic roles - to devote himself to being a director. That same year he became Chief Director and Head (and, from 1884, Intendant) of the Meininger Hoftheater. With artistically-ambitious duke [[Georg II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen|Georg II]] and his wife [[Ellen Franz]], Chronegk created the 'Meiningen principles', leading to a profound reform of the art of direction. Under his leadership, he took the Hoftheater company on many tours across Europe as the [[Meiningen Ensemble]], making his reforms known throughout the continent and making them the foundations of reforms in the rest of Europe. In 1886 Chronegk fell seriously ill and had to limit his direction of the tours, which finally ended in 1890. A street was named after him in the centre of [[Meiningen]] in 1990.

As a [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]], his influence on [[Islamic philosophy]] is primarily in the area of [[ethics]]. He was the author of the first major Islamic work on philosophical ethics entitled the ''Refinement of Morals''  ({{lang|ar|تهذيب الأخلاق}}), focusing on practical ethics, conduct, and refinement of character. He separated personal ethics from the public realm, and contrasted the liberating nature of reason with the deception and temptation of nature. Miskawayh was a prominent figure in the intellectual and cultural life of his time.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

==Life==
Miskawayh was born in Rey, then under [[Ziyarid dynasty|Ziyarid]] control. Miskawayh may have been a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] convert to [[Islam]], but it seems more likely that it was one of his ancestors who converted.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref name=EI&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | edition = New | publisher = E.J.

Gibb (ed.) | last = Arkoun | first = M. | title = Miskawayh | encyclopedia = The Encyclopaedia of Islam | location = Leiden—New York | year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his early career, he spent his life in [[Baghdad]], where he served as the secretary of Muhallabi, the vizier of the Buyid [[emir]] [[Mu'izz al-Dawla]]. He was fluent enough in [[Middle Persian]] to have translated some pre-Islamic texts in that language into Arabic.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} After a long service to the Buyids of Iraq, Miskawayh moved to the court of [[Rukn al-Dawla]], where he spent seven years working there with the Buyid vizier [[Abu 'l-Fadl ibn al-'Amid]]. In 966, a group of ''[[Ghazi (warrior)|ghazi]]'' marched towards the Library of Rey but Miskawayh managed to save it.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; After the death of Abu'l-Fadl ibn al-'Amid in 970, Miskawayh continued to serve the latter's son, Abu'l-Fath, and in 975 along with him left for [[Baghdad]].

He later worked as a secretary and librarian for a sequence of viziers, including [['Adud al-Dawla]]. Some contemporary sources associated him with the [[Brethren of Purity]], claiming that some of his writings were used in the compilation of the ''[[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity]]''.&lt;ref name=Nasr&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Nasr|first=Hossein|authorlink=Hossein Nasr|title=An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wms5240AvQC|year=1993|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-1419-5}}, page = 26&lt;/ref&gt;
Miskawayh died in 1030 at [[Isfahan]], then under [[Kakuyids|Kakuyid]] control.

==Works==
Ibn Miskawayh was one of the first to clearly describe a version of the idea of [[evolution]]. Muhammad Hamidullah describes the evolutionary ideas found in Miskawayh's ''The Greatest Victory'' ({{lang|ar|الفوز الأكبر}}) as follows:
{{quote|[These books] state that God first created matter and invested it with energy for development. Matter, therefore, adopted the form of vapour which assumed the shape of water in due time. The next stage of development was mineral life. Different kinds of stones developed in course of time. Their highest form being mirjan (coral). It is a stone which has in it branches like those of a tree. After mineral life evolves vegetation. The evolution of vegetation culminates with a tree which bears the qualities of an animal. This is the date-palm. It has male and female genders. It does not wither if all its branches are chopped but it dies when the head is cut off. The date-palm is therefore considered the highest among the trees and resembles the lowest among animals. Then is born the lowest of animals. It evolves into an ape. This is not the statement of Darwin. This is what Ibn Miskawayh states and this is precisely what is written in the Epistles of Ikhwan al-Safa. The Muslim thinkers state that ape then evolved into a lower kind of a barbarian man. He then became a superior human being. Man becomes a saint, a prophet. He evolves into a higher stage and becomes an angel. The one higher to angels is indeed none but God. Everything begins from Him and everything returns to Him.&lt;ref&gt;Adamec, Ludwig W. (2017). ''Historical Dictionary of Islam''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishing Group. pp. 290-291. ISBN 978-1442277236&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his ''Experiences of Nations'' ({{lang|ar|كتاب تجارب الأمم}}), he was one of the first major [[List of Muslim historians|Muslim historians]] to write a chronicle of contemporary events as an eyewitness. As a Buyid bureaucrat, he worked under the vizier al-Muhallabi and had access to the internal happenings of the court. The chronicle is a universal history from the beginning of Islam, but it cuts off near the end of the reign of 'Adud al-Dawla.

His major work in the field of [[Islamic philosophy|philosophy]] is his ''Refinement of Morals and Cleansing of Ethics'' {{lang|ar| تهذيب الأخلاق و تطهير الأعراق}}). The book is meant to provide students of philosophy and ethics an exposition of the main elements of philosophy.

The ''Book of Eternal Wisdom'' ({{lang|ar|كتاب الحكمة الخالدة}}) is an [[Arabic]] translation of a Persian work, the ''Eternal Wisdom'' ({{lang-fa|جاویدان خرد}}),&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; one manuscript of which bears the title ''Book of Literatures of the Arabs and Persians'' ({{lang|ar|كتاب آداب العرب والفرس}}).&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

'''Olaf Rose''' (born 1958) is a [[Germany|German]] historian and politician. He represents the right-wing [[National Democratic Party of Germany]]. Since 2006, Rose has worked as a parliamentary adviser to the group of the NPD in the [[Landtag of Saxony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,819446,00.html |title=Wahl des Bundespräsidenten: NPD stellt Historiker Rose als Kandidaten auf - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Nachrichten - Politik |publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a co-founder of the [[Gesellschaft für Freie Publizistik]] and a city councilor in [[Pirna]]. From 2008 to 2009, he was a member of the federal board of the NPD.

He was born in [[Arnsberg]] in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. A [[conscientious objector]], he opted for the [[Zivildienst]] instead of military service. He studied German and history at the [[Ruhr University Bochum]], and in 1992, he received a doctorate in [[military history]] from the [[Helmut Schmidt University]] of the [[Bundeswehr]]. His dissertation, which was financially supported by the [[Clausewitz Society]], explored the influence of [[Carl von Clausewitz]] as a military theorist in [[Russia]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. As a student and young academic, he held [[left wing]] views and contributed to left wing publications. From 1987 to 1996, he worked as an [[archivist]] for the [[Herdecke]] local government, and has published works on [[local history]].

He unsuccessfully contested the [[Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge (electoral district)|Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge constituency]] at the [[German federal election, 1998|2009]] general election. On 3 March 2012, he was nominated for [[President of Germany]] in the [[German presidential election, 2012|2012 election]] by the National Democratic Party of Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,819446,00.html#ref=rss|title=Wahl des Bundespräsidenten: NPD stellt Historiker Rose als Kandidaten auf&amp;nbsp;— SPIEGEL ONLINE&amp;nbsp;— Nachrichten&amp;nbsp;— Politik|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; winning only three out of 1,228 votes (= 0.24%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,822029,00.html|title=Entscheidung in Berlin Gauck zum Bundespräsidenten gewählt|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Optical sound''' is a means of storing [[sound recording]]s on transparent film.  Originally developed for military purposes, the technology first saw widespread use in the 1920s as a [[sound-on-film]] format for [[motion picture]]s. Optical sound eventually superseded all of other [[sound film]] technologies until the advent of [[digital sound]] became the standard in cinema projection booths.  Optical sound has also been used for [[multitrack recording]] and for creating effects in some [[musical synthesizer]]s.

==1914-1921: Naval and military use==

Building on the principle first demonstrated by the [[Photophone]] of [[Alexander Graham Bell]] in 1880, optical sound was developed by several inventors with an interest in wireless communication&lt;!-- "wireless telegraphy" excludes voice communications --&gt; through transmission of light, primarily for [[nautical|ship-to-ship]] use. The idea was that sound pulses could be converted into light pulses, beamed out from one ship and picked up by another, where the light pulses would then be re-converted back into sound.

A pioneer in this technology was American [[physicist]] [[Theodore Case]].  While studying at [[Yale]], Case became interested in using [[Modulation|modulated]] light as a means of transmitting and recording speech. In 1914, he opened the Case Research Lab to experiment with the [[photoelectric]] properties of various materials, leading to the development of the Thallofide (short for [[thallium]] oxysulfide) Cell, a light-sensitive [[vacuum tube]]. The Thallofide tube was originally used by the [[United States Navy]] in a [[top secret]] ship-to-ship [[infrared]] signaling system developed at Case's lab with his assistant Earl Sponable.  Case and Sponable's system was first tested off the shores of New Jersey in 1917, and attending the test was [[Thomas Edison]], contracted by the Navy to evaluate new technologies. The test was a success, and the U.S. Navy used the system during and after [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fielding|first=Raymond |title=A Technological History of Motion Pictures and Television: An Anthology from the Pages of "The Journal of the Society of Motion Pictures and Television"|year=1967|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-03981-5|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary with the work of Case and Sponable was [[Charles A. Hoxie]]'s [[Pallophotophone]] (from [[Greek language|Greek]] roots meaning "shaking light sound"), manufactured by [[General Electric]] (GE).  Similar to the Case infrared system used by the Navy, the Pallophotophone was also intended for wireless communications at sea, but was then adapted for recording speech. With GE's backing, Hoxie's invention was used in 1922-1923 to record then-Vice-President [[Calvin Coolidge]] and others for radio broadcasts.

The early work by Case, Sponable and Hoxie was instrumental in the development of [[sound-on-film]] systems for motion pictures during the 1920s.

==Film and radio==
[[File:USN16mmSoundtrack.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Example of a variable-area sound track on the right side of the frames on this strip of 16mm film. The width of the white area is proportional to the [[Sound#Perception of sound|amplitude]] of the audio signal at each instant.]]

Most of the inventions that led to optical [[sound-on-film]] technology employed the use of an [[electric lamp]], called an exciter, shining through a translucent [[waveform]] printed on the edge of a film strip.  When the light shines through the film, it is read by a photo-sensitive material and fed through a processor that converts the photovoltaic impulse into an electrical signal that is then amplified and converted into analogue sound waves through a speaker.

Three brands of optical sound-on-film technology emerged in the 1920s: Photofilm, Photophone and Movietone.  A fourth major contender for the sound film market was [[Warner Brothers]] [[Vitaphone]] [[sound-on-disc]] system that synchronized large-size (16") [[phonograph]]ic records with a film's projector. Many early [[talkies]], such as Warners' 1927 hit ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', used Vitaphone discs, but by 1931, optical sound-on-film would supplant the separate sound-on-disc technology.

===1919-1926: Phonofilm===
[[File:Phonofilm1.jpg|thumb|right|225px|alt=All-text advertisement from the Strand Theater, giving dates, times, and performers' names. At the top, a tagline reads, "$10,000 reward paid to any person who finds a phonograph or similar device used in the phonofilms." The accompanying promotional text describes the slate of sound pictures as "the sensation of the century&amp;nbsp;... Amazing! Astounding! Unbelievable".|Newspaper ad for a 1925 presentation of [[Phonofilm|De Forest Phonofilms]] shorts, touting their technological distinction: no phonograph.]]

After the war, Theodore Case and Earl I. Sponable collaborated with fellow wireless communications pioneer [[Lee de Forest]], inventor of the [[Audion tube]], to apply their optical sound system to motion pictures. De Forest had been granted general patents for a sound-on-film process in 1919, though it was the Case Research Lab's inventions that made de Forest's systems workable. The Case Lab first converted an old silent-film projector into a recording device in 1922, using the projector's light for exposing a soundtrack onto film. The process, which de Forest called [[Phonofilm]], recorded sound as parallel lines of variable shades of gray, [[photograph]]ically transcribing the electrical waveforms from a [[microphone]], which were translated back into [[sound wave]]s when the movie was projected.

Case fine-tuned this process with an invention called the Aeo-light for use in sound cameras.  During filming, audio signals modulated the Aeo-light to expose the film's audio directly inside the camera, streamlining Phonofilm's process for synchronizing a motion picture with its soundtrack.  In 1924 Sponable focused on the design of these single-system cameras, in which the sound and picture were recorded on the same negative. He approached [[Bell &amp; Howell]] to modify one of their cameras to his design, but the results were unsatisfactory. Later, the Wall Camera Corporation rebuilt the machine with improved results.

De Forest also worked with early [[newsreel]] maker [[Freeman Harrison Owens]], who had developed his own patented sound camera by 1921, and spent time in [[Berlin]] working with the [[Tri-Ergon]] corporation and investigating European sound film systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/2064/Lee-de-Forest-and-Phonofilm-Virtual-Broadway.html Lee de Forest and Phonofilm at Virtual Broadway website]&lt;/ref&gt; There he met Finnish inventor [[Eric Tigerstedt]] ("Finland's Thomas Edison"), who improved Phonofilm's amplification system to be audible in a large theater.

Phonofilm was used mainly to record stage performances, speeches, and musical acts in and around New York City, but [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] [[film studio|movie studios]] expressed little interest in the invention.  Because the Hollywood studios controlled all the major theater chains, de Forest showed his films in independent theaters in a short-form series, akin to [[vaudeville]], that included [[Max Fleischer|Max]] and [[Dave Fleischer]]'s ''[[Sound Car-Tunes|Song Car-Tunes]]''. The Fleischers used the Phonofilm process for their animated shorts, which included the now-classic "[[Bouncing Ball|Follow the Bouncing Ball]]" gimmick.

In 1924 Owens parted ways with de Forest, and Case followed suit in 1925 because of de Forest's taking sole credit for Phonofilm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cayuganet.org/cayugamuseum Case Lab Museum website]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1926, [[Warner Brothers]] introduced their [[Vitaphone]] [[sound-on-disc]] system, developed by [[Western Electric]], with the [[John Barrymore]] film ''[[Don Juan (1926 film)|Don Juan]]''. One month later the Phonofilm Company filed for [[bankruptcy]]. Case and Sponable went on to implement their optical sound-on-film innovations as the [[Movietone sound system]], and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] rights to Phonofilm were bought up by theater chain owner Isadore Schlesinger, who used the technology to release short films of British [[music hall]] performers through 1929.

===1921-1927: Pallophotophone and Photophone===
While Lee de Forest struggled to market Photofilm, Charles A. Hoxie's [[Pallophotophone]] had success as an optical recording device through the support of [[General Electric]].  The Pallophotophone utilized the entire width of unsprocketed 35mm [[Kodak]] monochrome film to record and replay multiple audio tracks.  Unlike Photofilm, this optical sound technology used a [[photoelectric]] process that captured audio wave forms generated by a vibrating mirror [[galvanometer]], and was the first effective [[multitrack recording]] system, predating [[magnetic tape]] multitrack recorders by at least 20 years.  From the early 1920s until the early 30s, GE broadcast over 1,000 Pallophotophone recordings from its [[Schenectady, New York]] radio station [[WGY (AM)|WGY]], including speeches by presidents [[Calvin Coolidge]] and [[Herbert Hoover]], and inventor-businessmen [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Henry Ford]].

By the mid-1920s, GE adapted Hoxie's invention for motion picture sound playback, subsequently marketed as a commercial product by then-GE subsidiary [[RCA]] as the [[RCA Photophone]].  The first demonstrations of the Photophone, were given in 1926, and in 1927 a sound version (music plus sound effects only) of the silent film ''[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]'', toured to a dozen specially equipped theaters.&lt;ref&gt;History of Sound Motion Pictures, E.W. Kellog, Journal of the SMPTE Vol 64 June 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

===1926-1939: Movietone===


While Hoxie's work found its way into national theaters through RCA, Theodore Case and Earl Sponable found a home with the [[Fox Film Corporation]] after leaving de Forest and Phonofilm.  Case and Sponible's [[Movietone sound system]] made several modifications to the earlier Phonofilm system that they had helped to create.   One was moving the position of the projector's soundhead from above the picture head (as it had been in Phonofilm), to 14½ inches (368&amp;nbsp;mm) below the picture head, close to the present day standard.  Case also adopted the 24 frames per second speed for Movietone, bringing it in line with the speed already chosen for [[Warner Brothers]]' [[Vitaphone]] sound-on-disc system, and thus establishing 24 frames per second as the standard speed for all sound films, whether sound-on-disc or sound-on-film.&lt;ref&gt;Earl I. Sponable, "Historical Development of Sound Films", The Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers (April 1947), Vol. 48, No. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Kellogg, "History of Sound Motion in Pictures", The Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers (June 1955), Vol. 64, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926 Fox hired Sponible, bought Case's patents (they had already acquired Freeman Owens' and Tri-Ergon's),&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=66 Freeman Harrison Owens (1890–1979)], op. cit. A number of sources erroneously state that Owens's and/or the Tri-Ergon patents were essential to the creation of the Fox-Case Movietone system.&lt;/ref&gt; and mass-produced Case's Aeo-light for use in all [[Movietone News]] cameras from 1928 to 1939.  These cameras recorded all Fox feature films from 1928-1931, the first being [[F. W. Murnau]]'s ''[[Sunrise (film)|Sunrise]]'' (1927).  As the first professionally produced feature with an optical sound track, it included mostly music and sound effects, with a very few unsynchronized words.

After 1931, Fox's feature film production moved to a two-machine system that [[Western Electric]] developed from the RCA Photophone, with the advent of a light-valve invented by Edward C. Wente.  In this new system, one camera shot the frames, and a second lens-less "sound camera" served as an optical recorder that was mechanically interlocked with the picture.  Fox did continue to make [[Movietone News]]reels with single-system cameras due to their easy transport.

===Optical sound on film to the present day===
[[File:Anamorphic-digital sound.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A strip of 21st century 35&amp;nbsp;mm film print frames.  The stereo [[analog recording|analog]] optical soundtrack appears just inside the perforations on the left side of the image.  On the far left and right, outside the perforations, is the [[Sony Dynamic Digital Sound|SDDS]] soundtrack as an image of a digital signal.]]

For half a century cinema sound systems were licensed to either RCA or Western Electric, and motion picture producers elected to license one or the other, or even both.  This continued until 1976, by which time optical sound recording had been converted to the Western Electric (dubbed "Westrex") stereo variable-area system.

As digital sound became the standard of sound reproduction in the 21st century, 35 and 70mm films have increasingly included a digital version of the soundtrack on the edges of the [[film strip]].  Most films continue to be processed with both digital and analog soundtracks so that they can be read by projection systems in any movie theater.

==Optical sound in music production==

After General Electric's Pallophotophone fell out of use in the early 1930s, optical multi-track recording did not have a resurgence for nearly three decades when [[high fidelity]] and [[stereophonic]] recordings became available commercially. [[Walt Disney]] made an attempt in 1940 when he began sound production for ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' with the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]].&lt;ref name=15facts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://d23.disney.go.com/articles/120210_NF_FEAT_Fantasia.html |title=15 Fascinating Facts About ''Fantasia'' |work= D23 - The Official Disney Fanclub |accessdate=January 16, 2011 |date= December 2, 2010 |first=Jim |last=Fanning }}&lt;/ref&gt; Disney set up 33 microphones at the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]] and ran these into eight independently operated mixing stations. The eight tracks were then recorded optically onto 35mm film, with a ninth track adding tempo for Disney's artists to synchronize their animation to the soundtrack.&lt;ref name=stokowchic1990&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-09-23/entertainment/9003190601_1_leopold-stokowski-fantasound-fantasia |title= Conductor`s Sound Innovations Make The Most Of The Music |work=Chicago Tribune |first=Alan G. |last=Artner |date=September 23, 1990 |accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disney later mixed these nine tracks down to four for use with the [[Fantasound]] system that toured with the film to select theaters in 1941. As an early cinematic surround sound system, Disney had to refit each theatre with special [[Fantasound]] equipment that was later dismantled and put toward the war effort. In 1942 [[RKO Pictures]] remastered ''Fantasia'' for distribution with a [[monaural]] soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=RKO Will Distribute Goldwyn Productions and Acquires Rights to 'Fantasia' |first= Douglas W. |last=Churchill |work=The New York Times |accessdate=February 12, 2011 |date= April 28, 1941 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was remastered again for stereo in 1956 when moviehouses became equipped with duophonic sound systems.

==Optical sound used in musical instruments==

A few [[musical instruments]] have been manufactured using optical sound for playback.
[[File:Optigan keyboard.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Keyboard overview of a model 35002 Optigan]]
In 1971 toy manufacturer [[Mattel]] released the [[Optigan]] (short for "'''opti'''cal or'''gan'''), an [[organ (music)|organ]]-like synthesizer whose sound library was stored on interchangeable 12" clear [[acetate]] "program discs".   Each program disc was encoded with 57 [[concentric]] optical tracks that spun on a [[turntable]] inside the machine.  The Optigan then translated the [[analog (signal)|analog]] waveforms on each disc to an audio signal via an exciter lamp shone through the disc and onto a [[photoelectric]] cell.  37 of the program disc's tracks were single [[note (music)|note]]s, and 21 featured [[Chord (music)|chords]] in different [[key (music)|keys]] and rhythm tracks much in the style of an electric chord organ or [[accordion]]. The Optigan came with a "Starter Set" of discs that featured standard instrument sounds and tempos.  Other sounds were available through purchase of more disc packs.  Mattel ceased production of the Optigan in 1976.&lt;ref name="NPR Optigan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Markel|first=Greg|title=Grooving to the Sound of an Optigan|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7718580|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orchestron was a version of the Optigan built by Vako Synthesizers Inc. Intended for professional use as an alternative to the [[Mellotron]] in the mid-1970s.  The Orchestron featured improved recorded sounds over the Optigan,though many professional musicians of note have performed and recorded using Mattel's toy version.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Michel Gondry Talks Music|author=Spence D.|url=http://music.ign.com/articles/500/500086p1.html|publisher=[[IGN|IGN Entertainment, Inc.]]|date=2004-03-18|accessdate=2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation of vintage optical sound sources==

Efforts have only recently been made to preserve early examples of optical sound.  While none of GE's original Pallophotophones are known to exist, a few reels of Pallophotophone recordings of radio broadcasts have been found.  Unlike movie [[film]], these 35mm reels do not contain [[sprocket]]s.  New players have been built using modern components to recover audio from old reels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ge.geglobalresearch.com/blog/reinventing-the-pallophotophone/ Interview with Russ DeMuth, "Reinventing the Pallophotophone", 'Edison's Desk' blog]&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the material on surviving reels is an early seven-note version of the [[NBC chimes]], a broadcast of a high school basketball match (believed to be the world's second-oldest recording of a sports broadcast), and a historic 1929 recording of the 82-year-old [[Thomas Edison]], with [[Henry Ford]] and President [[Herbert Hoover]], speaking on a broadcast commemorating the 50th anniversary of the invention of the [[incandescent light bulb]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retrothing.com/2010/06/recreating-the-rca-photophone.html James Grahame, "Recreating The RCA Photophone", ''Retro Thing'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;

A resurgence in interest in the Optigan has led to a circuit of collectors trading program discs.&lt;ref name="NPR Optigan" /&gt;   Though originally marketed as a [[toy instrument]], the Optigan was used by professional musicians to achieve unusual sounds, and the instrument made [[cameo appearance]]s on recordings by [[Bruce Haack]] (1973), [[Alan Steward]] (1976), [[Steve Hackett]] (1980) and [[Devo]] (1981).  In the 1990s the Optigan became popular as a [[vintage musical equipment|vintage]] synthesizer, and samples of its sounds were released as digital software, making the sounds accessible to musicians not able to obtain the actual instrument.  Since then, Optigan music has been used by numerous artists working in popular music, television, film, and is the featured instrument for the band Optiganally Yours.&lt;ref name=Optigan.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Optigan.com|url=http://optigan.com|publisher=Optigan.com|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''out-of-place artifact ''' ('''OOPArt''') is an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] of historical, archaeological, or paleontological interest found in an unusual context, that challenges conventional [[history|historical]] chronology by being "too advanced" for the level of civilization that existed at the time, or showing "[[Human settlement|human presence]]" before humans [[Timeline of human evolution|were known to exist]].  Other examples suggest contact between different cultures that are hard to account for with conventional historical understanding.

The term is rarely used by historians or scientists. Its use is largely confined to [[cryptozoology|cryptozoologists]], proponents of [[ancient astronaut]] theories, [[Young Earth creationist]]s, and [[paranormal]] enthusiasts.&lt;ref name="Salon" /&gt; The term is used to describe a wide variety of objects, from anomalies studied by mainstream science and [[pseudoarchaeology]] far outside the mainstream to objects that have been shown to be [[hoax]]es or to have mundane explanations.

Critics argue that most purported OOPArts which are not hoaxes are the result of mistaken interpretation, wishful thinking, or a mistaken belief that a particular culture could not have created an artifact or technology due to a lack of knowledge or materials. In some cases, the uncertainty results from inaccurate descriptions. For example: the [[Wolfsegg Iron]] was said to be a perfect cube, but in fact it is not; the [[Klerksdorp sphere]]s were said to be perfect spheres, but they are not; and the [[Iron pillar of Delhi]] was said to be "rust proof", but it has some rust near its base.

Supporters regard OOPArts as evidence that mainstream science is overlooking huge areas of knowledge, either willfully or through ignorance.&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2005/08/31/archaeology/index.html|title=Archaeology from the dark side|last=O'Hehir|first=Andrew |date=August 31, 2005|publisher=Salon.com|accessdate=19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many writers or researchers who question conventional views of human history have used purported OOPArts in attempts to bolster their arguments.&lt;ref name="Salon" /&gt; [[Creation science]] relies on allegedly anomalous finds in the archaeological record to challenge scientific chronologies and models of human evolution.&lt;ref name=StrombergOthers2004a&gt;Stromberg, P, and PV Heinrich (2004) [http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/rncse_content/vol24/2562_the_coso_artifact_mystery_fro_12_30_1899.asp ''The Coso Artifact Mystery from the Depths of Time?''], Reports of the National Center for Science Education. 24(2):26-30 (March/April 2004) Retrieved March 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Claimed OOPArts have been used to support religious descriptions of pre-history, ancient astronaut theories, and the notion of vanished civilizations that possessed knowledge or technology more advanced than that of modern times.&lt;ref name="Salon" /&gt;

== Examples ==
The following are examples of objects that have been argued by various fringe authors ([[Out-of-place artifact#See also|see list]]) to have been OOPArts:

=== Unusual artifacts ===
[[File:NAMA Machine d'Anticythère 1.jpg|thumb|Fragment of the [[Antikythera mechanism]].]]
A minority of alleged OOPARTs are at least debatably unusual within the scientific mainstream, although not impossible for their time period.
* [[Antikythera mechanism]]: Its clockwork-like appearance, dating to about 1,000 years before clocks were invented, has been claimed by fringe sources to be evidence of alien visitation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4184|number=184|title=The Antikythera Mechanism |accessdate=2011-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and authors such as [[Zecharia Sitchin]] argue that this artifact is a product "not of Man, but of the gods".&lt;ref name="Sitchin2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zecharia Sitchin|title=Journeys to the Mythical Past|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mPNg4nfp-6YC&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=19 June 2013|date=25 January 2011|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co|isbn=978-1-59143-951-6|pages=171–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, mainstream scientists consider the Antikythera mechanism to be a form of [[Analog computer|mechanical computer]] created around 150–100&amp;nbsp;BCE based on the theories of astronomy and mathematics developed by the ancient Greeks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19103">{{Marxism|Variants}}

The '''Praxis school''' was a [[Marxist humanist]] philosophical movement, whose members were influenced by [[Western Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Jay]], ''Marxism and Totality: The Adventures of a Concept from Lukács to Habermas'', University of California Press, 1984, p. 5: "Although such thinkers as the Polish philosopher [[Leszek Kolakowski]] (during his Marxist Humanist phase) and the Czech philosopher [[Karel Kosík]] were certainly important in their own right, their work was nonetheless built upon the earlier thought of Western Marxists, as was that of the Yugoslav theoreticians published in the journal ''Praxis''."&lt;/ref&gt; It originated in [[Zagreb]] and [[Belgrade]] in the [[SFR Yugoslavia]], during the 1960s.

Prominent figures among the school's founders include [[Gajo Petrović]] and [[Milan Kangrga]] of Zagreb and [[Mihailo Marković]] of Belgrade. From 1964 to 1974 they published the [[Marxist]] journal ''Praxis'', which was renowned as one of the leading international journals in [[Marxist theory]]. The group also organized the widely popular [[#Korčula Summer School|Korčula Summer School]] in the island of [[Korčula]].

==Basic tenets==
Due to the tumultuous sociopolitical conditions in the 1960s, the affirmation of 'authentic' Marxist theory and praxis, and its humanist and dialectical aspects in particular, was an urgent task for philosophers working across the [[SFRY]]. There was a need to respond to the kind of modified Marxism–Leninism enforced by the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] (see [[Titoism]]). To vocalize and therefore begin to satisfy this need, the program of Praxis school was defined in French in the first issue of the International edition of ''Praxis: A quoi bon Praxis''. Predrag Vranicki ("On the problem of Practice") and Danko Grlić ("Practice and Dogma") expanded this program in English in the same issue (''Praxis'', 1965, 1, pounds.&amp;nbsp;41–48 and pp.&amp;nbsp;49–58).

The Praxis philosophers considered [[Leninism]] and [[Stalinism]] to be apologetic due to their ad hoc nature. Leninist and Stalinist theories were considered to be unfaithful to the Marxist theory, as they were adjusted according to the needs of the party elite and intolerant of ideological criticism.

The defining features of the school were: 1) emphasis on the writings of the [[young Marx]]; and 2) call for freedom of speech in both East and West based upon Marx's insistence on ruthless social critique. As [[Erich Fromm]] has argued in his preface to Marković's work ''From Affluence to Praxis'', the theory of the Praxis theoreticians was to "return to the real Marx as against the Marx equally distorted by right wing [[social democrats]] and Stalinists".&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm, "Foreword". In ''From Affluence to Praxis'', Mihailo Markovic. The University of Michigan Press, 1974. p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different theorists emphasized different aspects of the theory. Where Mihailo Marković writes of alienation and the dynamic nature of human beings, Petrović writes of philosophy as radical critique of all existing things, emphasizing the essentially creative and practical nature of human beings. Milan Kangrga emphasizes creativity as well, but also the understanding of human beings as producers humanizing nature.

The Praxis School critiqued the particular form of socialist self-management [[Economy of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|implemented in Yugoslavia]], arguing that the expansion of bureaucratic power in the Yugoslav economy was due to Yugoslav [[workers' self-management]] not being sufficiently radical.&lt;ref name=lf /&gt;

Another defining feature of the Praxis theory is the incorporation of [[Existentialism|existential]] philosophy into the Praxis brand of Marxist social critique, spearheaded by [[Rudi Supek]].

Organizing Korčula Summer School and publishing the international edition of ''Praxis'' were ways to promote open inquiry in accordance with these postulates. Erich Fromm's collection of articles from 1965 entitled ''Socialist Humanism: An International Symposium'' has been of much help in promoting the Praxis school. As many as six members of the Praxis school have published articles in this collection: Marković, Petrović, [[Danilo Pejović]], [[Veljko Korać]], [[Rudi Supek]] and [[Predrag Vranicki]].

Although the tolerance for dissent from orthodox Communist thought afforded to the Praxis School in Yugoslavia was unusual, it had its limits: when [[1968 student demonstrations in Yugoslavia|University of Belgrade students held mass demonstrations in 1968]] against poor living conditions, authoritarianism, unemployment and the [[Vietnam War]] with the support of eight academics associated with the Praxis School, Tito urged that they be sacked on the grounds that they were "corrupting" their students, although the Belgrade Eight (as they became known) narrowly held on to their jobs.&lt;ref name=lf /&gt;

== The ''Praxis'' journal ==
The ''Praxis'' journal was published by a group of praxis theoreticians, mainly from the departments of Sociology and Philosophy at Zagreb University and the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy|Philosophy department at Belgrade University]].&lt;ref name=lf /&gt; It was established as the successor to a previous political journal, ''Pogledi'', which was published in Zagreb for three years in the 1950s before being disbanded due to state supression.&lt;ref name=lf /&gt; ''Praxis'' was published in two editions: Yugoslav (in [[Serbo-Croatian]]) and foreign (in multiple languages).&lt;ref name=lf /&gt; The first issue of the Yugoslav edition was published on 1 September 1964 and was published until 1974. As for the foreign edition, it was published between 1965 and 1973. Its founders were [[Branko Bošnjak]], [[Danko Grlić]], [[Milan Kangrga]], [[Rudi Supek]], [[Gajo Petrović]], [[Predrag Vranicki]], [[Danilo Pejović]] and [[Ivan Kuvačić]]. The first editors of the journal were Petrović and Pejović, but in 1966 Pejović resigned from ''Praxis''. After that, Supek was the co-editor of the journal together with Petrović. In January 1974 Supek also resigned and was replaced by Kuvačić as the co-editor of ''Praxis''.

Praxis has helped to restore the creative potential of Marxism. It drew inspiration from the works of [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Karl Korsch]], [[Georg Lukács]], [[Ernst Bloch]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Erich Fromm]] and [[Lucien Goldmann]]. The texts in the magazine featured articles by writers from both the East and the West. ''Praxis'' editors had a strong tendency to publish articles that went against the [[Leninist]] theory and praxis promoted and enforced by the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]]. They were also advocates of freedom of speech and of the press. According to Praxis School member [[Žarko Puhovski]], ''Praxis'' articles on controversial areas such as politics and ideology were often disguised as writings about more abstract topics such as [[aesthetics]] or [[ontology]].&lt;ref name=lf /&gt;

== Korčula Summer School ==
'''Korčula Summer School''' was preceded by a symposium organized by Gajo Petrovic and Milan Kangrga in the summer of 1963 in [[Dubrovnik]]. The summer school was organized by the publishers of the journal ''Praxis'' from 1964 to 1974 in the Croatian island of [[Korčula]], with the exception of 1966, when the gathering was cancelled due to the intense attacks by the League of Communists of Croatia.

The school was a meeting place for philosophers and social critics from the entire world. Some of the prominent attendees included [[Ernst Bloch]], [[Eugen Fink]], [[Erich Fromm]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Henri Lefebvre]], [[Richard J. Bernstein]] and [[Shlomo Avineri]], to name a few. Other notable participants included [[A. J. Ayer]], [[Norman Birnbaum]] and [[Lucien Goldmann]].&lt;ref name=lf&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Secor |first=Laura |date=September 1999 |title=Testaments Betrayed |url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9909/testbet.html |magazine=[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]|access-date=19 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another peculiarity is that one of the attendants was from the Vatican, Father Gustav Wetter, which testifies to the fact that Korčula Summer School was not merely a Marxist [[symposium]]—the attendees held interests ranging from phenomenology to theology.

The articles produced during the meeting were published in the journal during the following year. Each summer, the gathering focused on a particular topic:

*1963: Progress and Culture (held in [[Dubrovnik]])
*1964: Meaning and Perspectives of Socialism
*1965: What is History?
*1966: The summer school was canceled due to the intense attacks by the League of Communists of Croatia
*1967: Creativity and Creation
*1968: Marx and Revolution
*1969: Power and Humanity
*1970: Hegel and Our Time (celebrating the anniversary of 200 years since Hegel's birth)
*1971: Utopia and Reality
*1972: Freedom and Equality
*1973: The Essence and Limits of Civil Society
*1974: Art in a Technologized World

==Aftermath==

Due to its critical nature—the editors and authors were referred to{{according to whom|date=June 2018}} as "professional Anti-Communists" and "enemies of self-managing socialism"—the journal was banned on several occasions. By 1975 it became impossible to publish the journal under the increasingly repressive conditions in SFRY. In the same year, in January, the aforementioned Belgrade Eight (Mihailo Marković, [[Ljubomir Tadić]], [[Zagorka Golubović]], [[Svetozar Stojanović]], [[Miladin Životić]], [[Dragoljub Mićunović]], [[Nebojša Popov]] and [[Trivo Inđić]]) were expelled from the Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade on the basis of a decision of the Serbian Assembly. Some of the Eight taught abroad: Marković took up a part-time position at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], whilst Stojanović worked at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and the [[University of Kansas]]. Although the Zagreb Praxisists were treated less harshly, they still faced restrictions: Puhovski was unable to publish for two years. During subsequent years, the Praxisists organised underground meetings in private homes, which they dubbed the "Free University": however these were at risk of police interruption.&lt;ref name=lf /&gt;

The Praxis members tried in several occasions to resume publishing of ''Praxis'' and reopening Korčula Summer School. Their efforts failed, which was the main motive for several Praxis members to try to publish the journal abroad. They succeeded in achieving this and by April 1981, the ''Praxis International'' journal was edited and published in [[Oxford]] in the spirit of the original ''Praxis'' journal. However, not all Praxis members supported this move. This move was supported by four members of the editorial board of the ''Praxis'': Supek, Marković, Tadić and Stojanović. The majority of the Praxis theorists, however, led by Kangrga, disagreed on the basis of the fact that an international journal with the same or similar name as the original journal would reduce the possibilities of republishing the journal inside Yugoslavia. First co-editors of ''Praxis International'' were [[Richard J. Bernstein]] and Mihailo Marković. From 1986 the co-editors were [[Seyla Benhabib]] and [[Svetozar Stojanović]].

As [[Breakup of Yugoslavia#Background|inter-ethnic tensions in Yugoslavia rose]], some of the Belgrade Praxisists turned towards [[Serbian nationalism]]. In 1986, Marković, Tadić and Golubović, along with writer and Praxis associate [[Dobrica Ćosić]], signed a petition in support of [[Kosovo Serbs]], who had made allegations that they were being persecuted by the ethnic Albanian community there: the petition implied support for removing the region's [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|autonomous status]]. Marković was also a co-author of the [[SANU Memorandum]], which has been described as the catalyst for [[Slobodan Milošević]]'s rise to power.&lt;ref name=lf /&gt;

In 1990, ''Praxis International'' published an article by Marković on Kosovo: in it, he claimed that the high birthrate among the Albanian community in the province was a plot by Albanian nationalists against the Serb population, and that despite their poverty, the Kosovo Albanians had historically had support from powerful allies against the Serbian community, including the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Italy]], the [[Catholic Church]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Comintern]], the [[United States]], [[Pan-Islamism|Pan-Islamists]], [[Albania]] and bureaucrats in the Yugoslav government. He proposed a reduction in financial investment in the province and the introduction of a family planning programme, "in a gentle and psychologically acceptable way, and by the Albanians themselves, using primarily educational means". Seyla Benhabib subsequently stated that the publication of the article was the one editorial decision she regretted at ''Praxis International'': in a 1999 interview she explained that whilst she was aware of tensions in Kosovo, she lacked knowledge regarding the situation, and the commissioning of the article was an attempt to remedy this. Looking back, she highlighted the article's invoking of the Albanians as a [[demographic threat]] as its most striking feature: "This is cliche neofascist thinking, racist thinking about an oppressed group. You will find racists everywhere saying the same thing". The outbreak of the [[Yugoslav Wars]] shortly afterwards drove a wedge between the Belgrade Praxisists and their western collaborators: by this time Marković had been appointed vice-president of Milošević's [[Socialist Party of Serbia]], and served as its ideologue. This divide eventually led to the end of the journal under its original name.&lt;ref name=lf /&gt;

Of the other Praxisists, Stojanović became chief adviser to Ćosić when the latter was appointed President of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] by Milošević in 1992. Tadić and Mićunović formed the [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]] in 1990. Although Tadić was a leader of the opposition to Milošević in Serbia, he was an uncritical supporter of [[Radovan Karadžić]], the President of the [[Republika Srpska]] in [[Bosnia]]: in 1996 he and Marković signed a petition urging the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] to drop charges against Karadžić, describing him as "the true leader of all Serbs". However, some of the Belgrade Praxisists maintained opposition to the nationalist turn: Popov founded the liberal [[Civic Alliance of Serbia]], whilst Životić (who had moved away from Marxism towards [[post-structuralism]] in the 1980s) founded the [[Belgrade Circle]], an NGO dedicated to inter-ethnic dialogue and peace activism, in collaboration with Tito protege-turned veteran dissident [[Milovan Djilas]]. Of the Zagreb Praxisists, Puhovski became a leading member of the [[Croatian Helsinki Committee]], and spoke out against [[ethnic cleansing]] campaigns by the Croatian Army.&lt;ref name=lf /&gt;

''Praxis International'' was published until January 1994 when it continued to be published under the name ''[[Constellations (journal)|Constellations: An International Journal of Critical and Democratic Theory]]''.

==Influence==
The influence of the Praxis school is mainly through its intellectual legacy as a heterodox interpretation of Marxism. This interpretation has been popular among [[Western Marxism|Western Marxists]] and academics, notably [[Marshall Berman]], who references the Praxis group in his major works. Many praxis theoreticians taught at various universities in Europe and US. The Praxis approach was appealing to Western academia due to its emphasis on the dialectical, humanist Marx.

==Views and ideology==
He supported [[Muslim Brotherhood]] against the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état]]. He is a member of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in Kuwait and has been described in US State Department cables as a "moderate Islamist".&lt;ref&gt;"Help cure West's ills, Muslims told", Catherine Porter, ''[[Toronto Star]]'', Monday, January 6, 2003, Ontario edition, Section: News, p. A08&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/05KUWAIT3384_a.html|title=Cable: 05KUWAIT3384_a|work=wikileaks.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 he said "If Islamists start to become tyrants in the countries that were hit by the [[Arab Spring]], we will revolt against them just like we did against their predecessors.” and that “Freedom is a holy right and is one of the principles in Islam ... Freedom is to do and say what a person wishes but in a polite manner and without hurting others.” &lt;ref&gt;http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/03/25/203152.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 he demanded that the [[European Union]], as well as the rest of the world, enact “a law that forbids the insult to religious figures and religious sacred opinions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ecews5f7xts|title=Mohammed Cartoons - Tareq Al-Suweidan|date=7 February 2009|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has supported women's rights within Islamic [[sharia]] law and advocated for reforming traditional understanding of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedohadebates.com/debates/item/indexbae7.html|title=This House believes that Arab women should have full equality with men|work=thedohadebates.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Suwaidan is one of the signatories of [[A Common Word Between Us and You]], an open letter by Islamic scholars to [[Christian]] leaders, calling for peace and understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acommonword.com/index.php?lang=en&amp;page=faq#link7|title=A Common Word Between Us and You|work=acommonword.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4679252|title=Qatar Opens Debate on Thorny Muslim, Arab Issues|date=3 June 2005|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Suwaidan has condemned the [[9/11]] terrorists saying "these people are very dangerous to themselves, to the Arab world, to the Islamic world itself, and to Islam itself." 
 	
Al-Suwaidan is a strong supporter of women's rights in the Middle East and has participated in the Doha Debates arguing in favor of women's political and social rights. He spoke out against forced marriages calling it "un-Islamic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVQhmfe6iiQ|title=BBCDohaDebates - June 1, 2005 - Series 1 Episode 7 (Part 6)|first=|last=BBCDohaDebates|date=27 July 2009|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Suwaidan has also been a harsh critic of the US and the West and at conference of the [[Islamic Circle of North America]] in 2000, Al-Suwaidan said: "We must tell the West that we are extending a hand of peace now, but it will not be so for long." "Even if a civilization is ready to crumble – like the West, with all the characteristics of deterioration of past fallen empires – it will not fall until we, the Muslims, strive to give it that last push, the last straw that will break the camel's back.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/mixed-messages-from-touring-muslim-lecturer/story-e6frgcjx-1226386791743&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meeting of the [[Islamic Association of Palestine]] in Chicago in 2000 Al-Suwiadan said "Palestine will not be liberated but through Jihad. Nothing can be achieved without sacrificing blood. The Jews will meet their end at our hands." He was subsequently banned from the US.&lt;ref&gt;"Hardline cleric banned in the US will preach to British universities" Patrick Sawer; Philip Sherwell The Sunday Telegraph (London) January 24, 2010 Section: News; Pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2007, Al-Suwaidan was listed by U.S. federal prosecutors, along with a group of U.S. Muslim Brotherhood members, as an [[unindicted co-conspirator]] in the [[terrorism financing]] case against the [[Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development]] which was convicted along with its leaders of financing [[Hamas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/112508dnmetholylandverdicts.1e5022504.html?|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202111922/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/112508dnmetholylandverdicts.1e5022504.html|title=Holy Land Foundation defendants guilty on all counts -  News for Dallas, Texas - Dallas Morning News  -  Latest News|archivedate=2 December 2008|work=dallasnews.com|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/423.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/national/islamic-groups-named-in-hamas-funding-case/55778/|title=Islamic Groups Named in Hamas Funding Case|work=nysun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Federal court subsequently ruled that the list of unindicted co-conspirators should not have been released to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20101106-Judge-ruled-prosecutors-should-not-have-6808.ece|title=Judge ruled prosecutors should not have publicly released Holy Land unindicted co-conspirators list|work=dallasnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
In an April 2012 interview for Al-Quds, a TV station affiliated with [[Hamas]], he claimed that since politicians were controlled by money and the media which are controlled by the Jews, only "armed resistance"  and not Western aid or Western popular sympathy could change the situation in Palestine and Jerusalem. He also said in the interview that the most dangerous thing facing Muslims is the Jews calling them "the greatest enemy." &lt;ref&gt;"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/mixed-messages-from-touring-muslim-lecturer/story-e6frgcjx-1226386791743&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Suwaidan subsequently denied charges of antisemitism stating, "We are not against the Jews, let this be very clear." He alleged that the comments were based on a report by [[MEMRI]] which he called a "Zionist organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muslimvillage.com/2012/06/26/24397/tareq-al-suwaidan-defends-charges-anti-semitism/|title=Tareq Al Suwaidan defends charges of anti-semitism|work=MuslimVillage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
In a sermon to Hamas which was later posted on the internet on July 14, 2014, Al-Suwaidan described Israel as "a deviant country...[that] is destined to be eradicated in its entirety," explaining that "We do not demand a ceasefire. Rather, we demand that the rockets continue to be launched until they bow before us." Al-Suwaidan further stated that:

{{cquote|All the mothers of the Islamic nation – not only Palestinian mothers – should suckle their babies on the hatred of the sons of Zion. We hate them. They are our enemies. We should instill this in the souls of our children, until a new generation arises and wipes them off the face of the earth...Each and every one of us, when leaving this hall, should be contemplating a plan how to wipe out Israel.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/4361.htm Kuwaiti Cleric Tareq Al-Suwaidan to Hamas: Do Not Agree to Ceasefire until They Bow Before Us. We Must Contemplate a Plan to Erase Israel], [[MEMRI]],  Clip No. 4361 (transcript), July 14, 2014.

In November 2014, Al-Suwaidan was banned by the Belgium government from attending a Muslim Fair in [[Brussels]] on the basis of the comments made in this sermon. On his Twitter account, Al-Suwaidan wrote, "Under pressure from the Zionist Lobby, the Belgium government decided to prevent me from entering the country despite holding a valid visa."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kuwaiti Muslim scholar denied entry to Belgium|url = https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/europe/15101-kuwaiti-muslim-scholar-denied-entry-to-belgium|website = Middle East Monitor - The Latest from the Middle East|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that the reason they denied him entry was his "candid position regarding Zionism and the barbaric crimes of the Israeli occupation".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Belgium government announced that it had decided to prevent Al-Suwaidan from visiting Brussels, because of his "anti-Semitic" remarks in the past.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Belgian Prime Minister and Interior Minister said "This preacher has unacceptable anti-Semitic beliefs and his presence here is a threat to public order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/141104/belgium-bars-kuwaiti-preacher-alleged-anti-semitism|title=Belgium bars Kuwaiti preacher for alleged anti-Semitism|work=GlobalPost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Suwaidan used his Twitter account to promote what he calls electronic Jihad. On January 17, 2012, Al Suwaidan tweeted: "I see the need in uniting the efforts of the hackers within the electronic jihad project against the Zionist enemy, and it is an effective and important jihad, and its reward is great – Allah willing." AlSuwaidan: "I Strongly Encourage Young People To Undertake Electronic Jihad... I View This As Better Than 20 Jihad Operations."

In a June 4, 2011 interview on [[AlQuds TV]], AlSuwaidan called for armed resistance and electronic jihad against Israel: "The other day, I was asking myself: Why shouldn't I personally go on jihad? First of all, my body cannot tolerate it. Secondly, is what I am doing any less important than jihad? I would like us all to feel that we are in the same trench. There is such a thing as media jihad, political jihad, and a form of jihad that I strongly encourage young people to undertake – electronic jihad. Some of our youth are extremely clever. I hope that a group of hackers will get together, and will wage resistance over the Internet, targeting Israeli and Zionist sites and destroying them electronically.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Clashes with Gulf states===
In November 2012 a [[UAE]] police official said that suspects arrested in UAE had met with Kuwaiti Muslim Brotherhood members who are the ‘mentors of other groups’. He said "They hold courses and teach members how to act and resist, such as Tareq Al-Suwaidan. His anti-regime attitude is very clear." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.kuwaittimes.net/2012/11/12/dubai-top-cop-spews-bile-at-brotherhood-some-kuwaiti-mps-barred-from-uae/ |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |work=archive.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117035052/http://news.kuwaittimes.net/2012/11/12/dubai-top-cop-spews-bile-at-brotherhood-some-kuwaiti-mps-barred-from-uae/ |archivedate=2012-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In October 2013, Al-Suwaidan tweeted that he had been barred from performing the lesser [[Umrah]] pilgrimage in [[Saudi Arabia]], stating "I have been banned from entering Saudi Arabia solely for my views and my position against the coup in [[Egypt]] and I say that my love for Saudi Arabia and its people is unshaken and that ideas can [never] be banned.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/kuwait/kuwaiti-preacher-barred-from-makkah-pilgrimage-1.1238437|title=Kuwaiti preacher barred from Makkah pilgrimage|author=Gulf News Report|work=gulfnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularity ==
Al-Suwaidan has authored over 30 books, but his popularity is largely a result of his widespread [[social media]] activity– including: YouTube, Vimeo, iTunes, Facebook, Twitter.

He has over 9 million followers on Twitter, as of 12 November 2017.

Hundreds of Arabic and English speeches by Al Suwaidan can be found on YouTube where there are excerpts from his appearances on Arab TV channels, as well as speeches delivered in the Middle East and in the West.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9350">'''Theodore Daphnopates''' ({{lang-el|Θεόδωρος Δαφνοπάτης}}) was a senior [[Byzantine]] official and author. He served as imperial secretary, and possibly ''[[protasekretis]]'', under three emperors, [[Romanos I Lekapenos]], [[Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos]], and [[Romanos II]], rising to the ranks of ''[[patrikios]]'' and ''[[magistros]]'', and the post of [[Eparch of the City]]. Daphnopates' public career ended with the accession of [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] in 963, when he went into retirement. Daphnopates also participated in the [[Byzantine encyclopaedism|encyclopaedism movement]], writing several [[homilies]] and theological as well as historical works, few of which survive. Daphnopates is best known for his surviving correspondence, and is considered by some modern scholars as the author of the last section of the chronicle of ''[[Theophanes Continuatus]]''.

== Life ==
Daphnopates was probably born between 890 and 900. He was of [[Armenians|Armenian]] origin, and apparently spoke Armenian, as he translated a letter by the Bishop of [[Siwnik]], written in Armenian, into Greek.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Theodoros Daphnopates (#27694)}}{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=588}} Although he lived and worked in [[Constantinople]], his family hailed from elsewhere, as he records in a letter a visit by his mother by ship to [[Pylae]], on the Asian shore of the [[Propontis]], probably during the early 920s. During the return trip, Daphnopates himself nearly drowned when a heavy storm came upon his ship. Only with great effort and luck was the ship able to reach the coast at Cape Akritas.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Theodoros Daphnopates (#27694)}} 

Daphnopates first appears in the sources in the mid-920s, having apparently entered the service of the imperial court shortly before. In 924/5, Daphnopates composed three replies of Emperor [[Romanos I Lekapenos]] (r. 920–944), to letters by Tsar [[Symeon I of Bulgaria]]. In these letters, Romanos I criticized Symeon as rapacious and warlike, while trying to move him to accept a peace bringing an end to the [[Byzantine–Bulgarian war of 913–927|long war]] between Byzantium and [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]].{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Theodoros Daphnopates (#27694)}} Ten more letters to rulers and ecclesiastical leaders in Bulgaria and [[Medieval Armenia|Armenia]], written on behalf of Romanos I in the period 925–933, survive, indicating that Daphnopates probably held the post of head of the imperial chancery (''[[protasekretis]]'').{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Theodoros Daphnopates (#27694)}} A number of modern scholars—[[Ivan Dujčev]], [[R. J. H. Jenkins]], and [[Patricia Karlin-Hayter]]—have suggested that Daphnopates was the author of the anonymous speech celebrating the conclusion of peace with Bulgaria in 927 ({{lang|grc|ἐπὶ τῇ τῶν Βουλγάρων συμβάσει}}) and the concurrent marriage of Tsar [[Peter I of Bulgaria|Peter]], the son and successor of Symeon, with [[Maria Lekapene]], the granddaughter of Romanos I. The Greek historian [[Alkmini Stavridou-Zafraka]] however rejected this identification.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Theodoros Daphnopates (#27694)}}{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=588}}

Daphnopates remained active in the imperial chancery under [[Constantine VII]] (r. 913–920, 945–59) after 945. In late 945/6 he composed a symbolic letter addressed by the emperor to Saint [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] (Letter No. 11). At about the same time he also wrote a letter to the emperor himself concerning a [[eulogy]] on a recently deceased person, identified by modern scholars with Romanos Lekapenos, who died on 15 June 948. In return, the emperor sent a courtier with rich gifts.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Theodoros Daphnopates (#27694)}} Daphnopates' further activity under Constantine VII is obscure, but he reappears under his successor [[Romanos II]] (r. 959–963) in the same capacity. Three letters (Nos. 13, 14, 16) survive addressed to the emperor, and one letter (No. 15) by Romanos II to Daphnopates. Romanos II further promoted Daphnopates to the high post of [[Eparch of the City]]. Letter No. 15 indicates his closeness to the emperor, who requested him to interpret a dream that he had had. In accordance to this dream, the emperor intended to reinstate an anonymous leading official, who some modern scholars have identified as Daphnopates' predecessor and eventual successor as Eparch, Sisinnios, or the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]], [[Polyeuctus of Constantinople|Polyeuctus]]. Either because he was directly affected, or because he was not in favour of restoring the official in question, Daphnopates sent an evasive reply.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Theodoros Daphnopates (#27694)}}

After the death of Romanos II on 15 March 963, Daphnopates apparently composed his funeral oration. Shortly after, following the rise of [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] (r. 963–969) to the throne, he retired from public service. The most probable reason for this retirement was his age, since he does not appear to have been punished in any way by the new regime. Daphnopates continued to correspond with high officials, including his successors, Sissinios and Constantine, keeping up connections or intervening on behalf of former colleagues. To the same period probably are to be dated two further letters consoling disgraced officials.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Theodoros Daphnopates (#27694)}}

== Writings ==
Apart from his political work and his correspondence, Daphnopates was an active author, although most of his works do not survive. He wrote a number of [[homilies]] and [[hagiographies]] (on [[Saint George]], [[Theophanes the Confessor]], and of version A of the hagiography of [[Theodore Stoudites]]; the latter is sometimes attributed to [[Michael Monomachos]]), as well as composing a collection of excerpts of [[John Chrysostom]], in what [[Alexander Kazhdan]] called "a work typical of 10th-century [[Byzantine encyclopaedism|encyclopaedism]]".{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Theodoros Daphnopates (#27694)}}{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=588}} The 11th-century historian [[John Skylitzes]] mentions him as having written a chronicle which he used, and as Skylitzes made use of parts of ''[[Theophanes Continuatus]]'' for earlier events, modern scholarship generally considers him the author of the final portion of the ''[[Theophanes Continuatus]]'', bringing the work up to 963. His authorship has been rejected, however, by several scholars, including A. Markopoulos ("Theodore Daphnopatès et la Continuation de Théophane", JÖB 35 (1985), pp. 171–182), the authors of the French edition of Skylitzes' history, [[Bernard Flusin]] and [[Jean-Claude Cheynet]], and by the editors of Daphnopates' correspondence, J. Darrouzès and L. G. Westerink.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Theodoros Daphnopates (#27694)}}{{sfn|Holmes|2005|p=93}}{{sfn|Wortley|2010|pp=xvi–xvii (note 21)}}

Daphnopates' correspondence, including an [[epitaph]] on Romanos II, was published in a critical edition by J. Darrouzès and L. G. Westerink: ''Théodore Daphnopatès, Correspondance'', Paris: CNRS (1978). For his theological and hagiographical works, cf. V. Latyšev, "Dve reči Feodora Dafnopata", ''PPSb'' 59 (1910), pp. 15–38. The speech on the Bulgarian treaty has been edited by A. Stavridou-Zafraka in ''Byzantina'' 8 (1974), pp. 343–406, and translated into English by I. Dujčev, "On the Treaty of 927 with the Bulgarians", in ''Dumbarton Oak Papers'' 32 (1978), pp. 217–295.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Theodoros Daphnopates (#27694)}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3026">'''''Theophanes Continuatus''''' ({{lang-el|συνεχισταί Θεοφάνους}}) or '''''Scriptores post Theophanem''''' ({{lang|grc|Οἱ μετὰ Θεοφάνην}}, "those after Theophanes") is the [[Latin]] name commonly applied to a collection of historical writings preserved in the 11th-century Vat. gr. 167 manuscript.&lt;ref name="ODB2061"&gt;Kazhdan (1991), p. 2061&lt;/ref&gt; Its name derives from its role as the continuation, covering the years 813–961, of the [[chronicle]] of [[Theophanes the Confessor]], which reaches from 285 to 813. The manuscript consists of four distinct works, in style and form very unlike the [[annals|annalistic]] approach of Theophanes.&lt;ref name="ODB"&gt;Kazhdan (1991), pp. 2061–2062&lt;/ref&gt;

The first work, of four books consists of a series of biographies of the emperors reigning from 813 to 867 (from [[Leo the Armenian]] to [[Michael III]]). As they were commissioned by Emperor [[Constantine VII]] (r. 913–959), they reflect the point of view of the reigning [[Macedonian dynasty]]. The unknown author probably used the same sources as [[Genesios]].&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt; The second work is known as the ''Vita Basilii'' (Latin for "Life of Basil"), a biography of [[Basil I the Macedonian]] (r. 867–886) written by his grandson Constantine VII probably around 950. The work is essentially a [[panegyric]], praising Basil and his reign while vilifying his predecessor, Michael III.&lt;ref&gt;Kazhdan (1991), pp. 2062, 2180–2181&lt;/ref&gt; The third work is a history of the years 886–948, in form and content very close to the history of [[Symeon Logothetes]], and the final section continues it until 961. It was probably written by [[Theodore Daphnopates]], shortly before 963.&lt;ref&gt;Kazhdan (1991), p. 2062&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Blackwell''' the younger (4 August 1701 – 6 March 1757) was a classical scholar, historian and "one of the major figures in the Scottish Enlightenment."&lt;ref&gt;Wykes, David L. (2011). "The Revd John Aikin senior Kibworth School and Warrington Academy." In: ''Religious Dissent and the Aikin-Barbauld Circle, 1740–1860''. Cambridge University Press, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born on 4 August 1701 in the city of Aberdeen, son of Rev. Thomas Blackwell (?1660–1728), one of the ministers of Aberdeen.&lt;ref&gt;Fordyce, Alexander Dingwall (1885). "Blackwell (Thomas, LL.D.)." In: [https://archive.org/stream/cihm_05793#page/n5/mode/2up ''Family Record of the Name of Dingwall Fordyce in Aberdeenshire'']. Toronto: C. Blackett Robinson, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Patron of the [[Seven Incorporated Trades of Aberdeen]] from 1714 to 1728.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seventradesofaberdeen.co.uk/patrons-over-the-years/#&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended the Grammar School of his native place and studied Greek and philosophy at [[Marischal College]], graduating M.A. in 1718. He was presented to the chair of Greek at Marischal in 1723,&lt;ref&gt;From 1723 to 1757.&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the college's principal&lt;ref&gt;From 1748 to 1757.&lt;/ref&gt; on 7 October 1748.&lt;ref&gt;Fordyce (1885), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;He became LL.D. in 1752. – See "Blackwell (Thomas)." In: ''A New General Biographical Dictionary'', Vol. 4. B. Fellowes, 1853, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackwell was a well regarded professor and taught a number of important Enlightenment figures including Principal [[George Campbell (minister)|George Campbell]],&lt;ref&gt;Suderman, Jeffrey M. (2001). ''Orthodoxy and Enlightenment: George Campbell in the Eighteenth Century''. McGill-Queen's Press, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Chambers, [[Alexander Gerard]],&lt;ref&gt;"As in learning and knowledge he was exquisite and equal to any, so in the address of a teacher he was perhaps superior to all. No man ever possessed, in a more eminent degree the talent of inspiring young minds with a love of learning; of begetting among them a generous emulation; and of forming them to a taste and perception of what was elegant and beautiful in the admired productions of antiquity." – Gerard, Alexander (1807). "A Character of Dr. Thomas Blackwell." In: ''Memoirs of the Life and Writings of the Honourable Henry Home of Kames'', by Alexander Fraser Tytler, Vol. I, Appendix No. VII. Edinburgh: William Creech, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Beattie (writer)|James Beattie]],&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Burton (1972). "Thomas Blackwell, 1701–1757." In: ''The Rise of Modern Mythology, 1680–1860''. Indiana University Press, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; He strongly influenced [[James Macpherson]], the godfather as it were of [[Ossian]], [[James Burnett, Lord Monboddo|Lord Monboddo]] and [[Adam Ferguson]].

In May 1751, he married Barbara Black, third daughter of James Black, Dean of Guild of Aberdeen, and his wife Agnes Fordyce, daughter of Provost George Fordyce.&lt;ref&gt;Fordyce (1885), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; They had no children.&lt;ref&gt;Fordyce (1885), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Blackwell died of a consumptive illness in [[Edinburgh]] on 6 March 1757. His remains were buried in [[Greyfriars Churchyard]].&lt;ref&gt;Fordyce (1885), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major Works==
Blackwell's works, including ''An Enquiry into the Life and Writings of [[Homer]]'' (1735),&lt;ref&gt;Parts of this book were translated into German by J.J. Bodmer in 1743, and into French by Quatremère de Roissy in 1801: ''Recherches sur Homère''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Letters Concerning [[Mythology]]'' (1748),&lt;ref&gt;Translated into French in 1779: ''Lettres sur la Mythologie''.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Memoirs of the Court of [[Augustus]]'' (3 vols., 1753–63),&lt;ref&gt;Translated into French in 1757 by Feutry and again in 1799 by Quatremère de Roissy: ''Mémoires de la Cour d'Auguste''.&lt;/ref&gt; established him as one of the premier figures in the [[Scottish Enlightenment]].

===''Enquiry''===
In the ''Enquiry'' Blackwell considered why Homer was supreme as an epic poet and concluded that this was owing almost entirely to natural forces.&lt;ref&gt;"In 1735 Thomas Blackwell, Professor of Greek at Aberdeen, had published his ''Inquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer''. It made a considerable impression both at home and abroad, because it hit the mind of the age by tracing Homer's excellence to the happy concurrence of natural conditions." — Jebb, Richard Claverhouse (1904). "The Homeric Question." In: [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc2.ark:/13960/t8jd4s873;view=1up;seq=7 ''Homer: An Introduction to the Iliad and the Odyssey'']. Boston: Ginn &amp; Company, p. 116 (footnote).&lt;/ref&gt; Homer was the outcome of a specific society and natural environment,&lt;ref&gt;Labio, Catherine (2004). ''Origins and the Enlightenment: Aesthetic Epistemology from Descartes to Kant''. Cornell University Press, pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt; which combined to shape the inherited culture and produce a setting highly favourable to epic poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, Ruth (2009). ''Literary Historicity: Literature and Historical Experience in Eighteenth-century Britain''. Stanford University Press, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackwell’s idea that, instead of being innate as hitherto supposed, culture was learned and continually changing, was to become one of the basic assumptions of modern [[cultural anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;"First, the state of the country, where a person is born and bred; in which I include the common manners of the inhabitants, their constitution civil and religious, with its causes and consequences: Their manners are seen in the ordinary way of living, as it happens to be polite or barbarous, luxurious or simple. Next, the manners of the times, or the prevalent humors and professions in vogue: These two are public, and have a common effect on the whole generation. Of a more confined nature is, first, private education; and after that, the particular way of life we choose and pursue, with our fortunes in it. From these accidents, My Lord, men in every country may be justly said to draw their character, and derive their manners. They make us what we are, in so far as they reach our sentiments, and give us a peculiar turn and appearance: A change in any one of them makes an alteration upon us; and taken together, we must consider them as the molds that form us into those habits and dispositions, which sway our conduct and distinguish our actions.” — Blackwell (1735). ''An Enquiry Into the Life and Writings of Homer''. London: E. Dilly, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilisation brought advances in material terms but also artificiality and corruption and a loss of the heroic vision of earlier periods. Homer bridged the transition between modernity and the old heroic ethos, and as a plebeian was heir to a rich popular culture which gave realism and vividness to his verses. Blackwell argued that Homer had been an oral poet whose songs had been edited into developed epic form long after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Grobman, Neil R. (1979). "Thomas Blackwell's Commentary on The Oral Nature of Epic", ''Western Folklore'' '''38''' (3), pp. 186–198.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Enquiry'' had a high reputation with Blackwell's contemporaries&lt;ref&gt;"Blackwell's ''Enquiry'' was one of the most influential works of eighteenth-century classical philology, an inspiration not only to British scholars but to intellectuals in other countries, principally Germany, as well." — Bauman, Richard &amp; Charles L. Briggs (2003). ''Voices of Modernity: Language Ideologies and the Politics of Inequality''. Cambridge University Press, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Gibbon, Edward|Gibbon]] praised as "an effort of genius";&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, Samuel Taylor (1984). ''Biographia Literaria, Or, Biographical Sketches of My Literary Life and Opinions'', Vol. 7, Princeton University Press, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] called a "key" to Homer&lt;ref&gt;Simonsuuri, Kirsti (1979). "Thomas Blackwell: The Problem of Homer's Genius." In: ''Homer's Original Genius: Eighteenth-century Notions of the Early Greek Epic (1688–1798)''. Cambridge University Press, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;) and he his credited as having revived the study of Greek literature in the North of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Peter John (1906). ''Studies in the History and Development of the University of Aberdeen''. Aberdeen University Press, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Letters Concerning Mythology''===
As the ''Letters Concerning Mythology'' were first published in 1748 there were nineteen letters in all, the first six by an anonymous hand. Blackwell was responsible for letters seven to nineteen. Their content was as bold and original as the book on Homer had been.  Classical mythology had been discussed throughout the Christian era from a variety of unsympathetic standpoints: firstly by [[Euhemeristic]] critics who saw it as a fanciful form of history; next by Christian commentators who treated the classical gods as thinly-disguised [[demon]]s; and finally by modern rationalists who saw the system as ultimately irrational and meaningless.  Blackwell took a radically different view. He saw mythology as a deeply civilising influence, which, if its allegorical intention were interpreted sympathetically, was an important key to the world-view of classical antiquity.

Ordinary people may have accepted the stories of the gods at face value, but the intelligentsia had regarded 'the old Divinity' as conveying profound insights into the nature of reality but doing so in symbolic terms,&lt;ref&gt;"The Gods of the Ancients, you see, appear in a double Light; as the Parts and Powers of Nature to the Philosophers, as real Persons to the Vulgar; the former understood and admired them with a decent Veneration; the latter dreaded and adored them with a blind Devotion," and he added, "Has not the same thing happened in modern religious Matters?" (8th Letter, p. 62f).&lt;/ref&gt; and these Blackwell set himself to interpret, beginning in earnest with his Ninth Letter, of mythology as "Instruction conveyed in a Tale".&lt;ref&gt;Ninth Letter, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; He drew on a wide range of evidence from a variety of sources including not only the literary myths in Greek and Latin and the [[Orphic Hymns]], but French, Spanish, Italian, Hebrew and Arabic&lt;ref&gt;Tenth Letter.&lt;/ref&gt; texts, attempting to isolate the surviving original mythic strain from layers of later accretions.

Blackwell compared the early Jewish world view with contemporary Near Eastern cosmographies, analysing the account of creation in the [[Book of Genesis]] along with ancient Phoenician texts transmitted through [[Sanchuniathon]] to trace the transformation of [[Chaldea]]n monotheism into polytheism as the stars began to be worshiped as lesser deities.  Throughout this wide-ranging study Blackwell insisted that the past was not a foreign country but perfectly coherent and intelligible when viewed in its own terms.

===''Memoirs of the Court of Augustus'' (1753–63)===
[[File:Memoirs of the Court of Augustus, Vol. 3, 1763.jpg|thumb|250px|upright|''Memoirs of the Court of Augustus,'' Vol. 3, 1763]]
In ''Memoirs of the Court of Augustus'' (3 vols., 1753–63), Blackwell approached his subject as a practitioner of intellectual history, calling it 'This difficult Science of Men'. (p.&amp;nbsp;5) He showed how individuals were defined by society, and went on to trace the causes of Rome's developing from an obscure hamlet into a great imperial power. Rome's ethos had originally been austere and military and its original institutions democratic ones.

But insufficient separation of powers meant that if the republican impulse faltered there was little to prevent a slide into tyranny. A balanced constitution was therefore essential to enduring political success, a lesson reinforced by his comparative studies of later great powers including France, Venice and the Spanish Empire. Politics and empire formed only a part of this wide-ranging study. The ability of power to mould behaviour patterns fascinated Blackwell, and his study of [[Virgil]] and [[Horace]] demonstrated the responsiveness of the arts to their political context and explored how they might influence it in turn.

After Blackwell's death [[John Mills (encyclopedist)|John Mills]] continued and completed the third volume of ''Memoirs of the Court of Augustus'', which was published in 1763.&lt;ref&gt;''The Critical Review: Or, Annals of Literature'', Vol. 15, W. Simpkin and R. Marshall, 1763.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with Hippolyte Taine==
In a set of articles, published in 1897 by distinguished Brazilian scholar [[Araripe Júnior|Tristão de Alencar Araripe Júnior]],&lt;ref&gt;The first article was originally published in ''Revista do Brasil'', Ano I, No. 3, September 1897, pp. 73–76; the conclusion, in the following issue of the magazine, No. 4, 31 October 1897, pp. 94–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackwell was credited with being a precursor of [[Hippolyte Taine|Taine]]'s ideas concerning the contextual study of works of art.&lt;ref&gt;Araripe Júnior (1963). "Um Precursor de Taine." In: ''Obra Crítica de Araripe Júnior'', Vol. III, 1895–1900. Rio de Janeiro: Ministério da Educação e Cultura/Casa de Rui Barbosa, pp. 249–256.&lt;/ref&gt; "There was,... in the last century, a Scottish critic who innovatively applied to Homer the same processes of the master of modern criticism," [[Araripe Júnior]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And what is more surprising, he did it before Montesquieu&lt;ref&gt;Montesquieu (1748). ''De l'Esprit des Loix ou du Rapport que les Loix Doivent Avoir avec la Constitution de Chaque Gouvernement, les Moeurs, le Climat, la Religion, le Commerce''. Geneve: Barrillot &amp; Fils.&lt;/ref&gt; had put into circulation his theory on the influence of climate upon the laws and, therefore, upon all human social relations... This work [''Enquiry''] follows the same mental scheme used by Taine, except for the naturalistic technique. Blackwell does not speak of mesology; but, as the book goes on, we see that none of the factors identified by the French critic escaped his observation and analysis.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Blackwell's theory of the formative effects of climate&lt;ref&gt;"It's essential at the outset to understand the meaning of climate in the eighteenth century. It does not have its meteorological denotation; instead, Johnson defines it as 'A space upon the surface of the Earth, measured from the Equator to the polar circles in each of which spaces the longest day is half-an-hour longer' (Dictionary, 10th E. [London, 1792]). Cf. the 1771 Encyclopædia Britannica: climate is "a space upon the terrestrial globe." — Berry, Christopher J. (1974). "'Climate' in the Eighteenth Century: James Dunbar and the Scottish Case," ''Texas Studies in Literature and Language'' '''16''', No. 2, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; on our character and culture&lt;ref&gt;"In the division, commonly made of climates, the rough and cold are observed to produce the strongest bodies, and most martial spirits; the hotter, lazy bodies with cunning and obstinate passions; but the temperate regions, lying under the benign influences of a genial sky, have the best chance for a fine perception, and a proportioned eloquence. Good sense is indeed said to be a product of every country, and I believe it is; but the richest growths, and fairest shoots of it, spring, like other plants, from the happiest exposition and most friendly soil.” — Blackwell (1735), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; greatly impressed and influenced [[Johann Gottfried Herder]],&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Robert Edward (1991). ''Herder's Aesthetics and the European Enlightenment''. Cornell University Press, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; and it's well known today how [[Hippolyte Taine|Taine]] drew heavily on the German philosopher's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;"Taine's indebtedness to Herder has not yet fully been recognized. Every element of Taine's theory is containd in Herder's writings." — Koller, Armin H. (1912). "Johann Gottfried Herder and Hippolyte Taine: Their Theories of Milieu," ''PMLA'' '''27''', p. xxxix.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoyrup, Jens (2000). ''Human Sciences: Reappraising the Humanities Through History and Philosophy''. SUNY Press, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sternhell, Zeev (2004). "Fascism: Reflections on the Fate of Ideas in Twentieth-Century History." In: Michael Freeden, Ed., ''Reassessing Political Ideologies: The Durability of Dissent''. Routledge, pp. 92–115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Brad (2005). ''Before Cultures''. University of Chicago Press, p. 90.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Blackwell’s work enjoyed a high contemporary reputation and for nearly half a century he was regarded as the foremost Homeric scholar in Europe. But his Scottish Whig politics attracted bitterly hostile criticism from conservatively-minded English critics like [[Samuel Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Donald (2009). ''The Politics of Samuel Johnson''. University of Georgia Press, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; and his achievement was long cast into the shadow.&lt;ref&gt;"Inexplicably, historians have often made short shrift of Blackwell." — Norton (1991), p. 60 (footnote).&lt;/ref&gt; He is only now beginning to re-emerge as one of the most distinctive and original thinkers of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]].

'''Tsvi Jekhorin Misinai''' ({{lang-he|צבי מסיני}}; born 15 April 1946) is an Israeli researcher, author, historian, computer scientist and entrepreneur. A pioneer of the Israeli [[software]] industry,&lt;ref name="Amazon"/&gt; he now spends most of his time researching and documenting the common [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] roots he believes shared by [[Jewish ethnic divisions|world Jewry]] and the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]] (including [[Arab citizens of Israel]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/133875 Bedouin Sheikh: My People are of Jewish Descent]&amp;nbsp;– Israel National News, 15 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Tsvi Haifa Technion.jpg|thumb|280px|Misinai (''second left from the top row'') with friends, during his last year as a [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc]] student at the Haifa Technion in 1968]]
Tsvi Misinai was born in 1946 in [[Jerusalem]], [[Mandatory Palestine]] to [[Ashkenazi Jewish]] parents who immigrated from [[Ternopil]] in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (now [[Ukraine]]) in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.1095224 אחים יקרים]&amp;nbsp;– [[Haaretz]], 27 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in [[Physics]] from the [[Technion&amp;nbsp;– Israel Institute of Technology|Haifa Technion]] in 1968. He was the first Israeli to receive the Rothschild Award for industrial development in the field of software in 1992.&lt;ref name="Amazon"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1419689002 Brother Shall not Lift Sword against Brother (Paperback)]&amp;nbsp;– Amazon.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Misinai is the founder of [[Sapiens International Corporation]] and served as its president until 1994. He embedded the principle of Positive Thinking in computers and invented the Rule Based Object Oriented technology for developing data processing applications, the development of which he started in the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acpr.org.il/authors/misinai-t.htm Profile of Tsvi Misinai]&amp;nbsp;– Ariel Center for policy research (ACPR)&lt;/ref&gt;

Misinai self-identifies as a [[secular Jew]] and currently resides in [[Rehovot]].

Misinai first heard about the "Hebrew origins of Palestinians" theory from his father, Kha'yim Avraham, who served in the [[Royal Artillery]] in the [[Second World War]]. His interest was rekindled after the [[1991 Gulf War]], when there was talk about a new order in the Middle East. After the failure of the [[Oslo Accords]] that led to the commencement of the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]] in 2000, he abandoned his career as a Computer scientist and devoted his entire life to investigating the Jewish roots of Palestinians. He now spends his entire time tracking down Palestinians who acknowledge their Jewish heritage, and lobbying ministers, ambassadors, religious leaders and activists in both communities.&lt;ref name="Hider"/&gt; Misinai, and his team of Arabs and Jews, have embarked on a mission of trying to bring peace to Israel through a unique and controversial project called "The Engagement".

==Project on Palestinians==
{{Palestinians}}

===Hebrew origin===

====Background====

Tsvi Misinai claims that the majority of the [[Palestinian people]]—including those with Israeli citizenship or residency, known variously as [[Arab citizens of Israel]], Arab Israelis, Israeli Arabs, including the [[Negev Bedouin|Bedouin Arabs of Israel]]—are descendants of the ancient [[Hebrews]], as most of the world's [[Jewish ethnic divisions]] are.&lt;ref name="Shamah"/&gt; Furthermore, he claims that at least half of them are quietly aware of this fact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/132800 Arabs of Jewish Descent in Israel]&amp;nbsp;– 9 August 2009, Israel National News&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Misinai, unlike the ancestors of the modern day Jews who were city dwellers to a large extent, the Hebrew ancestors of the Palestinians were rural dwellers, and were allowed to remain in the land of Israel to work the land and supply Rome with [[grain]] and [[olive oil]].&lt;ref name="Hider"/&gt;

Misinai states the topic of Hebrew origin was spoken of openly by Palestinians until relatively recent history, much like the [[Egyptian people|Egyptians]] or [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] are aware of their origins to the [[Pharaonism|ancient Egyptians]] and [[Phoenicianism|Phoenicians]] respectively (even if this topic arouses the passions of those wishing to stress or de-emphasise it).&lt;ref name="Kawazbe"/&gt;

As with other "Arabs" whose local indigenous non-Arab origins became relegated issues over time, the Hebrew origin of Palestinians also became a relegated issue over time, but for the Palestinians. However, the additional emergence of [[Zionism]] in the early 19th century presented for the Palestinians a competing national interest not similarly encountered by other "Arabs". [[Arab nationalism]] would thus serve as a counter-force ''vis-à-vis'' Zionism. Thus, the topic of origin became admonished. Then, the establishment of modern Israel by world Jewry (having transpired to the detriment of the Palestinians) transformed the topic of Hebrew origin into a blemish of liability, ultimately becoming the object of outright hostility.&lt;ref name="Kawazbe"/&gt;

====Conversions and Arabization====

{{see also|Arabization|Musta'arabi Jews|Crypto-Judaism}}

As a result of remaining in the Land of Israel, the ancestors of the Palestinians partially [[Conversion to Christianity|converted to Christianity]] during the [[Byzantine]] era. Later, with the coming of [[Islam]], they were [[Islamification|Islamized]] through a combination of mainly forced conversions, but also nominal conversions (that is, conversions for form's sake to derive benefits as Muslims, and avoid tributes owed by non-Muslims in Muslim-ruled lands) and others yet out of genuine theological conviction.&lt;ref name="Hider"/&gt;

[[Conversion to Islam]] occurred progressively throughout the successive periods of [[Dominant minority|foreign elite minority]] rule over Palestine, both on an individual basis and ''en masse'', starting with the conversions during the various dynasties of Arabian Muslim rulers from the initial [[Muslim conquest of Syria#Conquest of Palestine|Muslim conquest of Palestine]]. Following these came rule by Muslim non-Arab dynasties such as the [[Ayyubid]]s ([[Kurds|Kurdish]] Muslim), [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] ([[Turkic people|Turkic]] Muslim) and finally the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]] ([[Turkish people|Turkish]] Muslim).&lt;ref name="Shamah"/&gt; This continuous phase of elite minority foreign Islamic rule over a local indigenous (now largely Muslim) mass was only briefly interrupted by the elite minority foreign Christian rule by the European [[Crusaders]], which lasted from 1099 until their expulsion by the Mameluks in 1291.&lt;ref name="Crusaders"/&gt;

[[Image:Tsvi and Ovadia.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Standing before the Sapiens building in [[Rehovot]], Misinai and Ovadia Yerushalmi, a [[Bedouin]] Jew and key Engagement Movement activist from the Banu Sawarka tribe]]

Misinai states that of this gradual process of conversions (often accompanied by [[Arabization]]), the majority were forcibly converted during the [[Fatimid dynasty|Fatimid]] era under the reign of [[Caliph]] [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|al-Hakim]] who was crowned at the age of 11, and reigned from the years 996 to 1021. Due to his young age, in practice, it was his ministers who wielded the actual power behind the throne for some time. They gave the young Caliph power to influence religious matters only, and appointed him as ''[[Imam]]''. In 1009, the extremists among his ministers gained the upper hand and brought upon a series of decrees against Christians and Jews.&lt;ref name="Hakim"/&gt;

In 1012, the al-Hakem Edict was issued, under which all Jews and Christians in Palestine were ordered to either convert to Islam or leave. This led to the majority of non-Hebrew origin [[Christians]] (i.e., foreign Christians) to leave Palestine, while over 90 per cent of Jews, Samaritans (also of Hebrew origin) and Hebrew-origin Christians converted and became Muslims. They would also become ''[[Mustarabim|Musta'arabim]]'' ([[Arabization|Arabized]]), [[acculturation|acculturated]] into Arab language, custom and culture.&lt;ref name="Hakim"&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, when the edict was finally repealed in 1044 during the reign of Caliph [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah|Al-Mustansir of Cairo]], only 27 percent of the Jewish converts to Islam returned to Judaism openly, although they too would remain ''Musta’arabi'' (culturally and linguistically Arab). The remainder continued to live as Muslim [[crypto-Jews]] in order to continue enjoying the economic advantages of Muslims, such as exemption from paying ''[[jizya]]'' and ''[[kharaj]]'', the ability to sell their agricultural products to the foreign authorities, or gain employment in the government machinery. Many younger persons of Hebrew-origin (Jewish, Christian or Samaritan) saw it simultaneously possible to lead dual lives, incorporating their prior faith while being outwardly Muslim, and accruing material benefits.&lt;ref&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Later, with the advent of Mamluk rule, [[Judaism]] had reached a breaking point in Palestine.&lt;ref name="Crusaders"/&gt;

====Backing====

[[Image:Israel Belkind.jpg|thumb|200px|In his 1928 anthropological work, ''Arabs in Eretz Israel'', [[Israel Belkind]], a pioneer of the [[First Aliyah]], advanced the claim that the Palestinian Arabs were descended from the ancient Hebrews.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Belkind, "Arabs in Eretz Israel", Hermon Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1969, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Tsvi Misinai validates his theory of the Hebrew origin of Palestinians on the basis of various findings in terms of historic-demographic, historic-geographic, national-territorial, genetic, behavioural-religious, nomenclature and linguistics, and Palestinian cultural and oral traditions.&lt;ref&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Brother shall not lift sword against brother'', he details numerous testimonies of their Jewish ancestry by Palestinians and Bedouins, and cites the anthropological studies conducted by [[Israel Belkind]], one of the organizers of the [[Bilu|Bilu movement]], [[David Ben-Gurion]] and [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]] (both the first Prime Minister and the second President of Israel, respectively).&lt;ref name="Shamah"/&gt;

Misinai also cites the following three genetic studies as lending credence to his theory.&lt;ref name="Shamah"/&gt; Among the genetic studies referred to by him include recent genetic studies conducted by Professor Ariella Oppenheim of the [[Hebrew University]] in [[Jerusalem]] on the male [[Y chromosome]] which revealed that the present day Jews and Palestinians represent modern descendants of a core population that lived in the area now constituting the state of Israel and the Palestinian territories, since prehistoric times.&lt;ref name="gibbons2000"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibbons|first=Ann|title=Jews and Arabs Share Recent Ancestry|work=ScienceNOW|publisher=American Academy for the Advancement of Science|date=30 October 2000|url=http://bric.postech.ac.kr/science/97now/00_10now/001030a.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, ''et al''. Figure 2: [http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/12/6769/F2 Plot of populations based on Y-chromosome haplotype data].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the Human Immunology magazine published a genetic study conducted by Prof. Antonio Arnez-Vilna, a Spanish researcher from the Complutense University of [[Madrid]], who discovered that the immune systems of the Jews and the Palestinians are extremely close to one another in a way that almost absolutely demonstrates a similar genetic identity.&lt;ref name="Villena2001"&gt;{{cite web|first=Antonio Arnaiz-Villena|title=The Origin of Palestinians and Their Genetic Relatedness With Other Mediterranean Populations|work=Human Immunology|publisher=The University of Tokyo|year=2001|url= http://kinoko.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~duraid/stolen_science/The_Origin_of_Palestinians_and_Their_Genetic_Relatedness_With_Other_Mediterranean_Populations.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a 2002 test by [[Tel Aviv University]]  researchers, determined that only two groups in the world—[[Ashkenazi Jews]] and Palestinians—were genetically susceptible to an inherited deafness syndrome.&lt;ref name="Shanin2002"&gt;{{cite web |author=Shanin H. |title=Genetics of congenital deafness in the Palestinian population: multiple connection 26 alleles with shared origins in the Middle East |work=Human Genetics |publisher=Tel Aviv University |date=March 2002 |url=http://www.tau.ac.il/~karena/papers/Shahin_et_al_2002.pdf |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification of the Palestinians===
Tsvi Misinai separates the Palestinian people into three main groups; the "Descendants of Israel", "Brethren of Israel" and "Palestinians of miscellaneous origins". He states that until recently, there had been very few [[Interracial marriage|inter-marriages]] between these groups, as Palestinians usually tended to marry within their own clans or related clans.&lt;ref&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

====Descendants of Israel====
The "Descendants of Israel", he claims, comprise descendants of the ancient biblical Hebrews which are native to the land west of the [[Jordan River]] (the [[West Bank]], Gaza Strip and Israel proper).&lt;ref name="Edom"/&gt; They are more specifically descended from the inhabitants of the [[Kingdom of Judah]], as opposed to the Samaritans who are mainly descended from the inhabitants of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]].&lt;ref name="Shomromim"/&gt;

Misinai claims that the Descendants of Israel had ceased to call themselves [[Musta'arabi Jews|Musta’arbim]], when the Brethren of Israel returned to their homeland during the 18th and 19th centuries. Despite this, stories about the Jewish origins of the family were passed on among the Descendants of Israel, and a few Jewish customs were preserved. Both groups began seeing themselves as one people, although [[endogamy|endogamous]] marriages with their own clans ensured the purity of their blood lines until very recently.&lt;ref&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Samaritans=====
{{Main|Samaritans}}
[[File:The High Priest of the Samaritans with the Codex Nablus c. 192.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Samaritan High Priest with the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]] ''[[Samaritan Torah]]'', [[Nablus]], c. 1920.]]

The [[Samaritans]] are distinguished among Descendants of Israel, given that their ancient history serves as an analogous precursor to the present situation that Tsvi Misinai argues exists between world Jewry and the Palestinians—that upon their [[Jewish diaspora|returns from exile]] and re-establishments of Israel, world Jewry misidentified as foreigners the descendants of those Israelites who had stayed behind, first in antiquity misidentifying the Samaritans as foreigners, and today in modern times misidentifying the Palestinians (Arabized Hebrews of the Muslim and Christian faiths) as foreigners.

The Samaritans are Descendants of Israel, being descended from farmers among the [[Ten Lost Tribes|Israelite Tribes]], part of whom were never exiled by the Assyrians or the [[Babylonians]] during the period of the destruction of the First Jewish Commonwealth. Their maternal lineages, however, derive from the Small Nations (those who came from [[Cuthah]] and others) who were exiled to [[Samaria]] by the [[Assyria]]ns and intermixed with their paternal Israelite ancestors. The alien minority who remained in the land, adopted the Israelite religion ([[Samaritanism]], the sister Israelite religion to [[Judaism]]) in the course of time, after the destruction of the [[First Temple]]. A portion of the Samaritans exiled by the Assyrians, were later repatriated by the prophet [[Jeremiah]] in the days of the [[Kingdom of Judah|Judean]] king [[Josiah]].&lt;ref name="Shomromim"&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;

The Babylonians, who followed the Assyrians as the dominant entity in the [[Fertile Crescent]], exiled many Samaritans but skipped over a significant part of the Samaritan population. By the time they arrived in [[Samaria]], the Babylonians found many alien elements in the land of Israel. Consequently, they did not undertake a thorough [[ethnic cleansing]] expulsion from Samaria, since the Assyrians had led many areas to be viewed as places whose [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] population had already been replaced by aliens and needed no further expulsion.&lt;ref name="Shomromim"/&gt;

Later, when the exiled Israelites (now known as [[Jews]]) returned from the [[Babylonian exile]] under prophets [[Ezra]] and [[Nehemiah]], they misidentified the Israelites who had stayed behind (now known as [[Samaritans]]) as foreigners. The reason for the misidentification was because the deportations had led the exiled Israelites and the Israelites who remained behind to develop in different ways. The Babylonian captivity had a number of serious effects on the exiled Israelites (Jews), [[Judaism|their religion]] (Judaism) and [[Jewish culture|their culture]]. Included among the most obvious of these changes was replacing the original [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]] (see also [[Samaritan script]]) with what is in fact a stylised form of the [[Aramaic alphabet]] (now commonly called the "[[Hebrew alphabet]]" because it is the normative form in which Hebrew is written due to Jewish numeric superiority), changes in the fundamental practices and customs of the [[Judaism|Jewish religion]], the culmination of [[Hebrew Bible|Biblical]] [[prophecy]] (in the Jewish prophet [[Ezekiel]]), the compilation of not only of the ''[[Talmud]]'' and ''[[Halakha]]'' (Jewish religious law, absent in Samaritanism) but also the incorporation of ''[[Nevi'im]]'' (Prophets) and ''[[Ketuvim]]'' (Writings) as a part of the cannon together with the ''[[Torah]] ''(in Samaritanism, only the ''Torah'' is canonical, see ''[[Samaritan Torah]]''), and the emergence of [[scribe]]s and [[wise old man|sages]] as Jewish leaders (see [[Ezra]] and the [[Pharisees]]). These resulting differences in religious practices between returnees and those who remained in Israel led to a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] in the Israelites, and whenceforth the creation of separate Samaritan and Jewish entities.&lt;ref name="Shomromim"/&gt; Over the centuries, Judaism and world Jewry have come to the acceptance that the Samaritans are indeed descendants of Israelites.

The [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Islamic conquest of Palestine]] in the first half of the 7th century, and the subsequent Arab rule, marked the beginning of the phase of decline and erosion of Samaritan identity, even more detrimentally than the extreme toll on Jewish identity. The passing of the aforementioned al-Hakem Edict in 1021, along with another notable forced conversion to Islam imposed at the hands of the rebel Ibn Firasa, decreased their numbers significantly, such that they decreased from more than a million in Roman times to just 712 people today.&lt;ref name="Shomromim"/&gt;

For those who maintained a Samaritan identity and religious association into modern times, they too, like their Palestinian counterparts who had additionally adopted Christianity and later Islam, were nevertheless thoroughly Arabized in language and culture. After the establishment of modern Israel, Samaritans living in what became the State of Israel replaced [[Palestinian Arabic]] with [[modern Hebrew]] as their day to day language (although [[Samaritan Hebrew]] had always been maintained as the [[liturgical language]], along with liturgical [[Samaritan Aramaic]] and liturgical Samaritan Arabic).

====Brethren of Israel====
The "Brethren of Israel", which are originally native to the land east of the [[Jordan River]] (the [[East Bank]], that is, modern-day [[Jordan]]) comprise the descendants of the brother nations of the Hebrews, i.e., the ancient [[Edomites]], [[Ammon]]ites and [[Moabites]] who variously converted to [[Judaism]] and moved to Israel before the Roman invasion, and were later forcibly converted together with the "Descendants of Israel" first to Christianity and then Islam.&lt;ref name="Edom"&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1249418656792&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Edomites, Moabites, Jews, Palestinians&amp;nbsp;– the 'salad' of the Jewish people?]&amp;nbsp;– ''Jerusalem Post'', 20 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Misinai states that the history of the Brethren of Israel is mostly intertwined with those of the Descendants of Israel. The Moabites, the Ammonites and the Edomites were forcibly converted to Judaism and made an extension of the Israelite nation during the course of [[King David]]’s conquests. Despite this, their kings were allowed to continue to directly hold the reins of power, and they were not incorporated into any of the [[Israelites|Israelite tribes]].&lt;ref name="Hashmon" /&gt; In the case of the Edomites, their fierce opposition to Israelite occupation led King David to order the killing of all male Edomites. Thus, the women in [[Edom]] had no alternative but to marry members of the Israelite garrison and other Israelites. As a result, the bloodlines of Edomites from that point onwards were partially Hebrew.&lt;ref name="Hashmon" /&gt;

After the destruction of the First Jewish Commonwealth by the [[Babylonia]]n King [[Nebuchadnezzar]], a considerable part of the Edomites and Moabites were exiled together with the Israelites. The majority of the Ammonites were exiled and those who remained were assimilated into the Moabite communities. The kinship between the Brethren of Israel, and the Israelites continued throughout the period of the Second Commonwealth and henceforth.&lt;ref name="Hashmon" /&gt;

However, after the destruction of the First Commonwealth and the absence of the hegemony of an Israelite regime, the Moabites and Edomites discarded their affiliation to the people of Israel and left Judaism en masse. To bring them back into the fold, the [[Hasmonean]] leaders decided to re-convert them a second time. The mass Judaization campaign was started by [[John Hyrcanus]] with the conversion of the Moabites and was ended by [[Alexander Jannaeus]] who completed the conversion of the Moabites and also the Edomites after he added their territory to his Kingdom. For the next 1,600 years, these Brethren of Israel continued to be an inseparable part of the People of Israel. The Edomites and Moabites (along with the Samaritans) participated in the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] and inflicted more damage on their enemies, relative to their small numbers, than the Jews.&lt;ref name="Hashmon"&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Edomites and Moabites ancestral lands were located east of the Jordan River, this made them more close to Arabia and more removed from the Jewish people. As a result, they were more susceptible to conversions to Islam, and hence, subsequently became Musta’arbim. When devastating famines broke out at the beginning of the 16th century, many among these Brethren of Israel emigrated to [[Persia]]. As a result of juggling different religious identities to avoid persecution, they eventually forgot their Jewish and Musta’arbi origins and became radicalised, and started considering themselves to be Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, as things improved in the 18th and 19th century, many of those who left returned from Persia, [[Yemen]] and [[Sudan]], shifting residences between present day Jordan and Israel, with the former mountain dwellers returning to their ancient homes, and the Edomites, Moabites, etc., settling in the plains. It is these "Brethren of Israel", Misinai contends, who constitute most of the Palestinian population east of the Jordan river and the [[Palestinian refugees]] (both within the Palestinian territories and outside), while the majority of Palestinians who did not flee and remain in Israel proper, West Bank and Gaza area, are "Descendants of Israel".&lt;ref&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

Misinai traces the beginning of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] and a Palestinian "Arab" identity to the simultaneous immigration of the Jews from various places and Brethren of Israel (from the east), to the land west of the Jordan river from 1840 to 1947. He states that by 1914 the Brethren of Israel became a very large group among Palestinians there and would remain so, until they were mostly expelled during the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Palestinian exodus]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that these people have now returned to their ancestral homeland east of the Jordan river, and possess no right to the land of Israel.&lt;ref name="Qassam"&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt;

Misinai states it is this group that are the most [[Anti-Semitism|anti-semitic]] and most active in terrorist activities in the intifada, with their objectives being to return to the lands they abandoned in 1948.&lt;ref name="Shamah" /&gt; He claims that the leadership of the Palestinian militant organisations such as [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]], [[Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades]], [[Fatah al-Islam]], [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades]], etc., are primarily internally supported by over 1,300,000 Brethren of Israel, who all reside west of the Jordan river. The victims of such terrorist acts tend to be the People of Israel, the Descendants of Israel and a small number of others.&lt;ref name="Qassam" /&gt;

According to Misinai, the Brethren of Israel are the smartest group among the Palestinian people and make up the majority of the Palestinian leadership. He states that the early leadership of the various Palestinian nationalist organisations such as [[Fatah]], [[PLO]], [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine|PFLP]], etc., came primarily from among the Brethren of Israel refugees in the 1948 exodus.&lt;ref name="Liad" /&gt; While he acknowledges that the Brethren of Israel have suffered more than any other Palestinians, he blames the Brethren of Israel leadership of perpetuating the problem for more than 50 years in order to gain camp followers both among those of their brethren who continue to suffer and among the Arabs and others who feel sorry for them.&lt;ref name="Liad"&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 311–312&lt;/ref&gt;

====Others====
[[File:Druze Man.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A Druze man in [[Peki'in]], Israel. Misinai claims that the Druze are partially of Jewish descent.]]

In addition to these two main components, there also include a significantly small percentage of [[Arabs]], descendants of the soldiers who served in the occupying [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] army after the destruction of the [[Second Temple of Jerusalem|Second Temple]] and even some survivors of the ancient [[Canaan]]ite and [[Philistine]] who are idol worshipers that live in Gaza and in the village of [[Jisr az-Zarka]], near [[Haifa]].&lt;ref name="Shamah"/&gt; A minuscule percentage of Palestinians are also descendants of 500 European [[Crusaders]] who stayed behind in Palestine and converted to Islam. These Crusaders, he indicates, are the source of the smatterings of blond haired and blue-eyed Palestinians one witnesses today.&lt;ref name="Crusaders"&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

The various entities among the neighbouring [[List of minor Biblical tribes|small nations]] of [[gentiles]], such as the [[Philistines]], [[Canaanites]], [[Jebusites]], [[Amorites]], [[Hivites]] and [[Perizzites]] inhabited the remainder of the historical region of [[Canaan]], from which the Hebrews under [[Joshua]] had driven them off and carved out a nation for themselves called [[Land of Israel|Israel]]. These nations were all eventually vanquished by [[King David]] and made a part of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]]. A large number were later exiled by King [[Nebuchadnezzar]] in the course of the destruction of the [[Kingdom of Judah]] and the [[Babylonian exile]]. A mass [[Judaization]] process in Israel in the course of the [[Hasmonean]] Period left only a handful of Philistines, Canaanites and other members of the Small Nations. Since conversion was not imposed on remnants of these Small Nations who had been [[Hellenized]], they continued to worship Greek deities. They were forced to nominally accept Christianity during the Byzantine period, and later finally expelled by Caliph Al-Hakim during the Fatimid rule, together with the majority of the Christian descendants of the Roman Army and almost all the Christian Arabs.&lt;ref name="Hakim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hasmonean"&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, pp. 247–48&lt;/ref&gt;

A few hundred, however, remained and their descendants constitute the small numbers of idol worshippers who live in Israel in modern times. These include a few Canaanites that reside in the village of Jisr az-Zarqa near [[Caesarea]], a few thousand Philistines and Canaanites in Gaza, and descendants of the [[Phoenicians]] in the form of [[Maronite Catholic]]s (primarily the refugees from [[Ikrit]] and [[Kafr Bir'im]]).&lt;ref name="Hasmonean"/&gt;

Misinai also claims that the [[Druze]] of Israel, [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] are partially of Jewish descent, along with Arab, Midianite, [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] and [[Egyptian people|Egyptian]] origins.&lt;ref name="Druze"&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; He further states that there were Jewish villages that became part of the Druze community, mostly to avoid being forcibly converted to Islam, such as the residents of the [[Western Galilee]] villages of Abu Snein and Yarka.&lt;ref name="Kara"&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/news.aspx/140251 MK Kara: Druze are Descended from Jews]&amp;nbsp;– 25 October 2010, Israel National News&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proportion of Hebrew-descended Palestinians===
[[Image:Star of David Yatta.JPG|thumb|right|220px|A thinly disguised star of David on a doortop in [[Yatta, Hebron|Yatta]], southern [[Mount Hebron]]]]

Tsvi Misinai claims that nearly 90 per cent of the Palestinian people living in Israel proper and the [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied territories]] are of Hebrew descent (with the percentage among the population of the [[Gaza Strip]] being higher than 90 per cent),&lt;ref name="Shamah"&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=1&amp;cid=1249418656478&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull The lost Palestinian Jews] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916050054/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=1&amp;cid=1249418656478&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |date=2011-09-16 }}- 20 August 2009, Jerusalem post&lt;/ref&gt; but a greatly reduced percentage among Palestinian refugees living outside those areas.&lt;ref&gt;The Engagement booklet: The roots and solution to the problem in the Holy land&amp;nbsp;— p. 14, Tsvi Misinai&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Misinai puts forward the following statistics pertaining to the proportion of the "Descendants of Israel" and the "Brethren of Israel" populations among the Palestinians and Arab Israelis, as of December 2007. It is detailed as four main areas (Judea and Samaria, Gaza strip, East Jerusalem and Israel proper) and are as follows:
* In [[Judea and Samaria]]—not counting East Jerusalem, the number of permanent residents was 956,000, of which over 580,000 (61 per cent) were Descendants of Israel. Another 27 per cent were 259,000 Brethren of Israel (of whom were 158,000 descendants of the Edomites and 101,000 descendants of the Moabites). The remainder included 43,000 Arabs (4.5 per cent), 44,000 descendants of the Roman Army, 24,000 Christians from Distant Places and 6,000 Kurds.&lt;ref name="Statistics"&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, pp. 391–400&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Gaza Strip]], there were 891,000 permanent residents, including Bedouin. Out of the non-Bedouin, 275,000 were Descendants of Israel, 520,000 were Brethren of Israel (approximately 270,000 descendants of the Moabites and approximately 250,000 descendants of the Edomites), 43,000 descendants of the Roman Army, 4,000 Arabs who live in the Jabali’ya refugee camp; 3,400 Canaanites and 2,700 Philistines all living in Gaza city, and 3,000 [[Druze]] that live in the Dir al-Balakh refugee camp. Among the Descendants of Israel in the Gaza Strip, 30,000 are descendants of the Samaritans and 245,000 (27.5 per cent) are descendants of authentic Jews. The population of the Gaza Strip also includes 40,000 Bedouin. The internal distribution of the Gaza Bedouin is 18,000 descendents of Moabites, 14,000 descendants of Edomites and 8,000 Descendents of Israel. In addition to the Bedouin, the total number of the Descendants of Israel is 283,000 (32 per cent), of the Brethren of Israel is 552,000 (62 per cent, 288,000 or 32 per cent descendants of Moabites and 264,000 or 30 per cent descendants of Edomites).&lt;ref name="Statistics"/&gt;
* Of the 200,000 non-Jewish residents of [[East Jerusalem]], 82,000 are Descendants of the People of Israel, out of which 2,000 are descendants of Samaritans living in the Samaritan neighbourhood, A-Sumera or Al-Abid. Out of this group, 7,000 are Christians. Some 48,000 are descendants of Kurds who came during the reign of [[Saladin]]. Over 32,000 are Brethren of Israel (24,000 descendants of the Moabites and 8,000 descendants of the Edomites). Some 27,000 are of Arab origin, and constitute the main concentration of population of Arab origin among Israeli citizens today. This includes 9,000 members of the veteran Arab settlers, and 14,000 descendants of the Arab Army living in the [[Mount of Olives]] neighbourhood. There are also another 11,000 inhabitants who are recognised as non-Arab citizens: 5,000 Armenians and 6,000 non-Arab Christians from various distant locations.&lt;ref name="Statistics"/&gt;
* Within Israel proper, 642,000 (45.5 per cent) out of 1,413,000 non-Jewish residents within the Green Line (not counting East Jerusalem) are Descendants of the People of Israel. Some 457,000 are Brethren of Israel in the State of Israel (and another 32,000 in Jerusalem), or 36 per cent of all the Palestinians there (489,000 or 34.5 per cent, including Jerusalem). A further breakdown of this figure shows that the descendants of the Edomites number 166,000, and constitute 13 per cent (of the Palestinians in the State of Israel, or 174,000 or 12.5 per cent, with Jerusalem). The descendants of the Moabites number 291,000, and constitute 23 per cent (315,000 or 22 per cent with Jerusalem). The sum total of veteran inhabitants who are neither Palestinian nor Jewish is 140,000 and includes 121,000 Druze and 19,000 foreigners from Distant Places. The descendants of the Roman Army number 150,000, or 12 per cent (10.5 percent with Jerusalem). The rest, some 16,000, or 1.25 per cent, are Arabs, (43,000 or 3 per cent with Jerusalem). The number of Palestinians within the Green Line is 1,273,000. Among the Palestinians (i.e., those without Israeli citizenship) within the Green Line (not including East Jerusalem) the percentage who are Descendants of the People of Israel is close to 50.5 per cent.&lt;ref name="Statistics"/&gt;

===Views on Palestinian identity and the Arab–Israeli conflict===
Tsvi Misinai denies the existence of a separate Palestinian people as a historical identity and dismisses it as an utter fabrication. He views the Palestinian nationality as a modern socio-political construct propped up by imperialist Arab [[Baathist]] regimes, as a means of claiming rights to the land of Israel and fight the Jews. He also blames them for accentuating hostilities between the Jews and Palestinians. In his book, Misinai asserts that the Palestinian people are a part and parcel of the people of Israel, and that no other party, including an Arab one, possesses the right to compete with the rights of the People of Israel over western [[Eretz Yisrael]] and their historical kinship with most Palestinians.&lt;ref name="Baathist"&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

Misinai claims that the Palestinian national identity is not developed, for most Palestinians think of it in religious terms, not territorial. He states that their identity today is only Islamic and that there is a need for them to obtain a modern identity, which is Israeli. He asserts that this modern identity can never be Palestinian, as the country never had such an historical identity and as most Palestinians are themselves the progeny of the ancient Hebrews.&lt;ref name="Nisan" /&gt; Misinai labels the name "[[State of Palestine|Palestine]]" as two huge bluffs, both a semantic bluff of the name Palestine and a genetic bluff as Palestine indicates that the modern day Palestinians are scions of the Philistines.&lt;ref name="Nisan" /&gt;

Misinai puts forward widespread ignorance about the true Jewish identity of the Palestinians or attempts to hide it, coupled with terrorism, as the root causes in escalating the conflict. He asserts that this is what prevents their liberation and preserves their enslavement within an occupation by a false Arab identity.&lt;ref name="Baathist" /&gt;

Misinai claims that even though, many Palestinians are aware of their Jewish origins, they rarely speak about this, and their vast majority does nothing to change their status. Those living under a Palestinian terror regime are deterred from speaking on this subject openly, for fear of being harmed. Many Palestinian parents who aware of their Jewish origins usually don't tell their children. Furthermore, families suspected of Jewish origins are forced to prove their loyalty as Arabs by aiding terrorists and giving their children patriotic names such as ''[[Jihad]]''. Such behaviour deters Jews from establishing ties with such families. Even among Israeli Arabs there is a fear of discussion, primarily due to conventions on both sides and particularly the disbelief they would encounter among Jews. They fear that if they try and promote their claim, the Jews will think they are trying to improve their inferior status under false pretenses.&lt;ref&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, pp. 297–298&lt;/ref&gt;

He believes that both his findings and the genetic evidence gathered by Ariella Oppenheim and others render the Israeli–Palestinian conflict redundant, as it proves that the whole of Israel and the occupied territories belong to both the so-called "recognised Jews" and "unrecognised Jews".&lt;ref name="Hebron Hills" /&gt;

Misinai also believes that given the option, most Palestinians would support a one-state solution.&lt;ref name="Nisan" /&gt; He also claims that most Palestinians do not hate Jews and are interested in peace with Israel. He claims that many are opposed to the Jewish presence in the Palestinian territories, because the issue has been hijacked by groups—the leadership of the Arab world, and Palestinians (both the Brethren of Israel and the Descendants of Israel) who have forgotten their Jewish origins.&lt;ref name="Shamah" /&gt;

The primary sin of [[Zionism]], according to Misinai, is the suppression of the historic truth about the Jewish origins of the majority of Palestinians, and ignoring his findings and its ramifications.&lt;ref&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; He asserts that most of the Palestinians who together with the Jews possess historical rights to Israel have become hostages of descendants of foreigners in their own homeland who control their lives, force terrorism upon them and control the cash designated for Palestinians.&lt;ref name="Baathist" /&gt;

Misinai also states that the number of refugees has been deliberately blown out of proportions and that there are far fewer refugees than is widely believed. To this, he attributes the Palestinians' taking advantage of [[UNRWA]]'s largesse, which gives out free food and aid without asking questions and deliberate gross inflation in the number of refugees by Palestinians themselves.&lt;ref&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

==="The Engagement": A solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict===

====Concept====
[[File:HeaderIimg2.png|450px|center|thumb|Engagement Movement logo]]
In contrast to the two commonly discussed solutions to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]—a [[two state solution]] (i.e., two states for two people) vs. a [[one state solution]] (i.e., a [[binational state]], one state for two peoples)—Misinai believes that the only solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is a third option: a "one state solution for one people." This "one state" integrates Israel proper with the West Bank and Gaza Strip as one territorial unit, while the "one people" consists of both groups being bound and re-defined as one united Israeli-Hebrew nation.&lt;ref name="Hider"/&gt;

To this end, he argues it is imperative that the majority of Palestinians reclaim their ethnic Hebrew heritage, although he states that this does not mean reverting to [[Judaism]] (neither de-Islamization for Palestinian Muslims, nor de-Christianization for [[Palestinian Christians]], etc.), nor does it mean cultural de-[[Arabization]]. Instead, it means the adoption of a national consciousness that acknowledges a common Hebrew origin that embraces all those of such a descent, no matter what their current religion, be they [[Jewish]], [[Muslim]], [[Christian]], or [[Samaritans|Samaritan]], and no matter what their culture.&lt;ref name="Hider"/&gt;

Indeed, already, among the different [[Jewish ethnic divisions]], each has its own [[Jewish languages|traditional community language]] and [[Jewish culture|distinct traditional culture]]. It is the amalgam of this diversity that forms Jewish [[Israeli culture]]. Likewise, the "Jewish" Israeli culture would continue with this process, but will add the Palestinians' history, culture and religious diversity, and integrate them as aspects of the Hebrew national consciousness.&lt;ref name="Hider"/&gt;

In order to do so, he believes that the whole concept of [[Who is a Jew?|Jewishness]] as the defining factor in [[Zionism]] must be re-framed in terms of ethnicity, as opposed to simply religious.&lt;ref name="Yonah"&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Blogs/Message.aspx/3654 Arab Jews]&amp;nbsp;– Israel National News blog, Tamar Yonah, 29 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Misinai concedes that "The Engagement" might seem like a surreal project, but so too did Zionism initially. "The Engagement", he admits, is a process that requires participation by both sides and mutual acknowledgement of the "other" as a part of oneself.&lt;ref name="Kawazbe"&gt;{{YouTube|AenISgolLe0|Palestinians of Jewish Origin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Uni-lateral Engagement====
As a prelude to creating conditions to make the re-integration of the majority of Palestinians with the Jews possible, Misinai advocates a "Uni-lateral Engagement" in which autonomy is granted for the Palestinian territories and the present Palestinian leaderships are removed.&lt;ref name="Unilateral"/&gt;

He states that Israeli operations in Palestinian areas must be designed not only to ensure the safety of Israeli citizens, but also to liberate the Palestinians from the yoke of the Palestinian leaderships whom he accuses of subjugating them and making their lives wretched, feeding them lies, and leading them from one ''[[1948 Palestinian exodus|Nakba]]'' catastrophe to another, causing untold damage to the entire region and igniting terrorism around the globe. Their entire terror apparatus must be dismantled, and they must be replaced by a new Palestinian leadership devoted to peace. Should any peace-loving Palestinian leadership fail to appear, Israel must enforce its own authority upon all factions in the Palestinian population.&lt;ref name="Unilateral"&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt;

====Re-engagement process====
Misinai states that the re-engagement will take one of two forms:   '''Residents without citizenship''', or '''Re-engagement with the People of Israel.''' The process will be carried out on a family-by-family basis, and in certain instances on an individual basis. In the first stage, which will be carried out gradually among all the Palestinian population, each and every Palestinian (except those suspected of terrorist activity) will have three choices:
* '''Loyal Residency''': An oath of allegiance to the State, and declaration of waiver of citizenship rights for oneself (if the individual declines to opt for the second course of action that follows). This is equivalent to the American [[United States Permanent Resident Card|green card]], but where additionally, one's status is passed to children on the basis of ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' (by contrast, children of American non-citizens born on US soil are automatically citizens due to ''[[jus soli]]'', whatever the status of the parents). Children of individuals (who are Descendant of Israel) who chose this first option may circumvent status of "loyal residency" passed on by their parents if they themselves opt for the second course of action that follows. This choice is available only for those Palestinians who do not wish to rejoin the People of Israel, or who are not Descendants of Israel.
* '''Re-engagement with the People of Israel:''' The expressed desire and willingness to rejoin the People of Israel via an oath of allegiance to the State of Israel and its people, the People of Israel, and declaration that one does not belong to the Arab nation.
* '''Emigration:'''  [[Emigration]] and purchase of the émigrés’ house by the State at a fair price (in order not to cause injury to émigrés due to fluctuations in market prices, likely to be depressed by an exodus and surplus of real estate). This choice is available for those Palestinians who, if eligible for the first, or both the first and second options, want neither.&lt;ref name="Re-engagement"&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, pp. 356–358&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event of either of the first two options, neither de-Christianization nor de-Islamization, nor cultural de-Arabization are components of The Engagement. Furthermore, if an individual person wanted to [[Conversion to Judaism|revert to Judaism]], this is strictly a personal matter which would be done through the relevant religious channels, which The Engagement process is not a part of in any form.

The Engagement is of a national re-unificationist nature. Most importantly, it is thus far the first that is specifically [[Religious pluralism|religiously pluralistic]] (that is, it acknowledges the People of Israel are today of many faiths), an aspect that lends to its very controversy.

Citizenship sought by members of world Jewry would continue to be dealt with by the requirements and specifications of the [[Law of Return]]. Persons who are neither Jews nor Palestinians, and are seeking residency or citizenship, would follow [[naturalisation]] processes and requirements separate from both the Law of Return and The Engagement.

=====Requirements=====
Under the scheme while each new member would not be required to convert to Judaism, they would, however, be required to gain mastery of the following:
* The Hebrew language (including reading and writing).
* The culture of the People of Israel.
* The history of the People of Israel, including the forced conversion of their ancestors.
* The history of Eretz-Israel.
* The ''[[Tanakh]]''.
* Jewish religious tradition.&lt;ref name="Requirements"&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, pp. 330–333&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope of knowledge or proficiencies required would be equal to that of most secular Jews, and would ensure that the act of re-engagement would have sufficient quality and depth. The scope of knowledge would actually be far greater than that required in conventional conversion to Judaism, and would not exclusively focus on matters of faith and ritual. This is in order to provide a cognitive counterweight to the hostile education and incitement that Palestinians have been subjected to in the past in regard to Israel. Moreover, it will serve to enhance the level of education of participants to enable them to successfully integrate into Israeli society without being marginalised or becoming second-class citizens. Such education, outlined in Option Two above, will continue for a number of years and will be accomplished in a framework similar to the Hebrew language ''[[ulpan]]s'' (intense six month ‘total immersion’ crash-courses designed to inculcate basic mastery of Hebrew by new immigrants in Israel).&lt;ref name="Requirements"/&gt; The children of such Palestinians will be enrolled in the Israeli school system, compulsory education just as their Israeli counterparts.&lt;ref name="Re-engagement"/&gt;

The other requirements of enrollees in the scheme are as follows:
* Declare their renunciation of their association to the Arab Nation. This, Misinai asserts, does not mean dis-association from Arab culture.
* Take a short bath in a ''[[Mikveh]]'' to remove influence of potential intermarriage with people other than the people of Israel during the generations. This, Misinai states, has a purely national meaning and does not impose any religious undertaking on the person taking it.
* Take an oath of allegiance to the People of Israel and the State of Israel.
* Palestinians who complete the process of re-joining the People of Israel and are not yet Israeli citizens will receive Israeli citizenship. All re-joining Palestinians will be registered with either an Israeli or a Jewish nationality according to their choice.&lt;ref name="Requirements"/&gt;

=====Benefits=====
Those who choose the first path (loyal residency only) will have the option to choose an Arab Islamic (or Christian) education school track, with an abridged Israeli curriculum. The children of those who choose the second path (re-engagement) will be required to enroll in the regular Israeli school system. Only those who complete Israeli education and belong to the second option (the re-engagement path) can progress to the third step&amp;nbsp;– service in the [[Israeli Defense Forces|IDF]], taking an oath of allegiance to the Jewish People.&lt;ref name="Re-engagement"/&gt;

At the beginning, the IDF will establish special units for this population (similar to separate minority units of Bedouin, Druze and Circassians in the formative years of the IDF). Palestinians who are above draft age will undergo abridged military service (current policy for older new Jewish immigrants), then be integrated into the IDF reserve system. Only Palestinians who will serve in the IDF will be eligible for Israeli citizenship (except for those with serious health issues or those who are too old, who receive exemptions). Only the army will have the prerogative to decide which candidates for military service should do civil service in place of military service. Citizenship will carry eligibility for certain civil rights including the right to vote for the [[Knesset]] and benefits such as receipt of better social benefits for veterans including higher children's allowances. A citizen who betrays the state will lose his citizenship and be harshly punished. Similarly, a loyal resident who will abridge his oath of allegiance will lose his or her Residency rights and be deported, in particularly serious cases, after offenders complete their sentence.&lt;ref name="Re-engagement"/&gt;

=====Exceptions=====
Only those considered to be Descendants of Israel would benefit from the scheme. Tsvi Misinai states that only a small minority of the Palestinian who are presently outside of the Land of Israel (i.e., the refugees or diaspora) have significant rights over Western [[Eretz-Yisrael]]. That right belongs to the original Descendants of the People of Israel (i.e., the Jews, a majority of Palestinians presently in the Land of Israel, and a minority of Palestinians presently outside the Land of Israel), and to the Descendants of the Roman Army (whose historic rights in Eretz-Israel are, however, much lesser than those of the Descendants of Israel).&lt;ref name="Entitlement"/&gt;

The majority of the Descendants of the Roman Army are presently in [[Jordan]], and despite their long-standing seniority rights in Israel, they must remain there, as most emigrated to Jordan of their own free will after the [[Six day war]] of 1967. The only exception to this is specific cases of family reunion.&lt;ref&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Brethren of Israel, being native to the land east of the Jordan river, only those who are presently in the Land of Israel will be eligible for "loyal residency", unless they opt for emigration. Those Brethren of Israel who are presently outside of the Land of Israel (a majority among Palestinian refugees) will not be eligible for "loyal residency", nor a [[right of return]] to the Land of Israel. They possess a [[right of return]] to Jordan. This is because they are not ethnically Jews, and their historic Jewish identity came about by forced conversions to Judaism, as is the case with Islam. Furthermore, their rights to Israel go back only 170 years, and are superseded by those of the Jews and Descendants of Israel, who have a historic connection to the land, spanning several thousand years.&lt;ref name="Entitlement"&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsvi Misinai's theory does have its supporters among some Palestinians, including Sulaiman al-Hamri, a [[Fatah]] official from [[Bethlehem]],&lt;ref name="Hider"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110615200139/http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article5504478.ece  A tragic misunderstanding]&amp;nbsp;– Times online, 13 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and former [[Palestinian Authority]] minister [[Ziad Abuzayyad]], who asked Misinai to prepare [[Arabic]] language versions of his thesis and the Engagement booklet.&lt;ref name="Conflict"&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1249418656670&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull 'This is a conflict between brothers; it's all a big misunderstanding']&amp;nbsp;– 20 August 2009, ''Jerusalem Post''&lt;/ref&gt; He has also gained support among some Jews, including at least one Israeli government minister who so far has remained unidentified.&lt;ref name="Hider"/&gt;

Among Bedouins, a key vocal supporter of Misinai's theory has been Sheikh Salem al-Huzeil, the head of the "Our State" Movement and a prominent leader of the Al-Huzeil tribe from [[Rahat]]. In October 2009, with the aim of furthering Jewish and Bedouin ties, Al-Huzeil organised a meeting with Misinai and the [[Religious Zionism|religious- Zionist]] “Hit’habrut” (Joining Together) Movement, in which he maintained that most of his tribal ancestors were Jewish prior to their forced conversion during the Muslim conquest approximately 1,300 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/133828 Sanhedrin Sponsors Unique Bedouin-Jewish Get-Together]&amp;nbsp;– 13 October 2009, Israel National News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bedouin"/&gt;

The Sheikh's act, however, was not without any repercussions. In the immediate month following the meeting, the Sheikh was the recipient of numerous death threats from Bedouins enraged at his efforts to maintain friendly relations with the Jewish community and to demonstrate for the release of kidnapped soldier [[Gilad Shalit]]. Posters were distributed calling for the death of Sheikh al-Huzeil. Moreover, several members of his family suffered severe burns after rival Bedouins set his house on fire in Rahat.&lt;ref name="Bedouin"&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/news.aspx/134177 Death Threats against Bedouin with Jewish Ancestry]&amp;nbsp;– 2 November 2009, Israel National News&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, some [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jewish]] settler leaders have also welcomed the idea with great enthusiasm, since they believe that once the entire biblical land of Israel is populated with Jews, a new era of peace on [[Earth]] will be ushered in.&lt;ref name="Hider"/&gt; Rabbi Dov Stein, secretary and one of the seven-member leadership council&lt;ref name="Volunteers for the Sanhedrin Initiative Online"&gt;[http://www.thesanhedrin.org/en/main/officers.html Current members of the Sanhedrin]&amp;nbsp;– thesanhedrin.org, 5 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[2004 attempt to revive the Sanhedrin|current nascent Sanhedrin]] (a Jewish religious council of 200 ''[[rabbi]]s'' modelled on the biblical [[Sanhedrin]] rulers of Jerusalem), also supports the Hebrew origin of most Palestinians.&lt;ref name="Hider"/&gt;

[[Image:Al-Huzeil.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Misinai (''far right'') at a meeting with elders from the Bedouin Al-Huzeil tribe which claims Jewish descent and Sanhedrin members, which took place in [[Rahat]] on 13 October 2009]]
Stein, however, as an [[Orthodox Jew]], differs with Misinai on its implications, since he sees Jewish nationhood as primarily defined by religious affiliation to [[Judaism]], even where one may not necessarily be of Hebrew ancestral origin, and not defined by Hebrew ancestral origin. Stein asserts that it's because the Jews uphold the ''[[Torah]]'' that they have the right to Israel.&lt;ref name="Hider"/&gt; Therefore, in order to be accepted, Stein argues that the Palestinians must give up Islam and embrace Judaism as a prerequisite for re-joining the Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1249418656593&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull 'Jews they are definitely not']&amp;nbsp;– 20 August 2009, Jerusalem Post&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Israeli academics and intellectuals, Tsvi Misinai has received the avid support of [[Mordechai Nisan]], a professor and scholar of [[Middle East]] Studies from the [[Hebrew University]] in Jerusalem. Nisan was also asked by the Sanhedrin to serve as its professional consultant on this issue, while Elon Yarden, an attorney who has written a series of books about the land of Israel and its inhabitants, has also reached the same conclusion as Misinai.&lt;ref name="Nisan"&gt;[http://www.the-engagement.org/uploaded/makor_rishon_english.pdf According to the law of Moses and Ishmael]&amp;nbsp;– Avinadav Vidkon, Benni Mekimi&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Druze, Druze MK [[Ayoob Kara]] of the [[Likud]] party agrees with Misinai's claim about the Druze, and further postulates that all Druze rather than just a few villages, are actually descended from Jews who were forced to convert to Islam. Kara has even gone as far as saying that he can bring forward genetic evidence to prove it.&lt;ref name="Kara"/&gt;

====Criticism====
Misinai's thesis and work has also garnered controversy, both at home and abroad, among some Palestinians and Jews alike, with the criticisms mostly coming from the Palestinian side.

One Palestinian intellectual, Ismail Al-Shindi, professor of Islamic Jurisprudence at [[Al-Quds Open University]] denied that Jews ever maintained a sizeable population in the land of Palestine, or that they were forcibly converted by the [[Ottomans]], and he even went as far as to accuse Misinai of "falsifying" history to [[Hebraization of surnames|Hebraize]] Palestinians.&lt;ref name="Shindi"&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1246346385064&amp;pagename=Zone-English-News/NWELayout Falsifying History to Hebraize Palestinians]&amp;nbsp;– Islamonline.com, 16 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Another Palestinian, Kamel Katalo, professor of Sociology at [[Hebron University|Al-Khalil University]] in [[Hebron]], has stated that he has read Tsvi Misinai's booklet and come to the conclusion that Misinai makes strident generalisations and reaches spurious and completely erroneous conclusions based on questionable premises, stating that there is no such thing as a "Jewish gene".&lt;ref name="Shindi"/&gt;

His most notable Arab Israeli critic is the former [[Balad (political party)|Balad]] MK, [[Azmi Bishara]], who dismissed his thesis as yet another Jewish plot to remove the Palestinians from their land.&lt;ref name="Conflict"/&gt; Misinai has accused both the Israeli and Palestinian authorities of being indifferent to his findings.&lt;ref name="Hebron Hills"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1032272.html 4 Palestinians claim descent from Jews forced to convert]&amp;nbsp;– 29 October 2008, Haaretz&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
Tsvi Misinai has written two books on this subject, ''Hearing is Believing&amp;nbsp;– The Roots and the Solution to the Eretz-Israel Problem'' explaining his thesis and detailing numerous testimonies, linguistic and name similarities, genetic and natural science findings, cultural and religious similarities, as well as a shortened version ''Brother Shall not Lift Sword against Brother''. The former is available only in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] under the title ''Ye’amen ki Yisupar&amp;nbsp;– Ba’ayat Eretz-Israel, Shorasheha oo-Pitronah'', with the latter being available in Hebrew and [[English language|English]], as well as an [[Arabic]] version which was released in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;''Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother'', Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
