The '''1961 President Airlines Douglas DC-6 crash''' occurred on the night of September 10, 1961, when a President Airlines [[Douglas DC-6|Douglas DC-6B]] named ''Theodore Roosevelt'' &lt;ref name="Airmail book"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Vogt |first=Ronny |title=Irish Crash Airmails |publisher=Irish Airmail Society |year=1997 |location=Bray |pages=281 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; outbound from [[Shannon, County Clare|Shannon]], Ireland crashed into the nearby [[River Shannon]] shortly after takeoff, killing all 83 people on board.  To date, the crash remains the deadliest one in Irish territory, as well as the third-deadliest involving a DC-6 after [[LAN Chile Flight 107]] and [[Olympic Airways Flight 954]].&lt;ref name="ASN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19610910-0|title=Aviation Safety Network|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aircraft and occupants==

The aircraft involved in the accident was a Douglas DC-6B registered N90773.  It first flew in 1953 and was powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 engines.  The aircraft's occupants on the accident flight consisted of 77 passengers and six crew members.&lt;ref name="ASN"/&gt;

==Accident==
The aircraft was on a non-scheduled international passenger flight from [[Düsseldorf]], Germany to [[Chicago]] with stopovers in Shannon and [[Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador|Gander]], [[Newfoundland]] for refueling.  Shortly after takeoff from Shannon Airport's runway 24, the pilots were cleared for a right-hand turn, but they instead turned left and kept turning until the aircraft had reached a bank angle of about 90 degrees or more.  Unable to recover, the aircraft plummeted into the River Shannon 5,000&amp;nbsp;ft. from the end of the runway.  There were no survivors among the 83 passengers and crew.  Subsequent investigations indicate that the crash probably resulted from a malfunctioning [[attitude indicator]], a fault in the starboard [[aileron]]s, or both.  Poor weather conditions and crew fatigue were also cited as possible contributing factors.&lt;ref name="ASN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.planecrashinfo.com/1961/1961-35.htm|title=Plane Crash Info|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irish State Papers released in 1994 indicated that the pilot had alcohol in his blood and that the airline was insolvent at the time of the accident.&lt;ref name="Airmail book"/&gt;

==See also==
*[[Air India Flight 855]] – another accident in which the attitude indicator failed, causing the pilot to bank too far to the left and lose control.
*[[Aero Flight 311]] – another aircraft in which crew had alcohol before flight; it also banked to the left before crashing.

An '''accessory cloud''' is a [[cloud]] which is dependent on a larger cloud system for its development and continuance. It is often an appendage but also can be adjacent to the parent cloud system.&lt;ref name="Glossary of Meteorology"&gt;{{cite book |last=Glickman |first=Todd S. |title=Glossary of Meteorology |publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]] |date=June 2000 |location=Boston |url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Arcus cloud|arcus]] and [[roll cloud]]s, [[shelf cloud]], [[wall cloud]], and [[scattered cumulus under deck|scud]] are examples of low level or vertical accessory clouds whilst the [[anvil cloud|anvil]], and [[overshooting top]], are examples of high level accessory clouds. The condensation funnel of [[funnel cloud]]s and [[tornado]]es are also accessory clouds. They are associated with deep moist [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] and especially [[cumulonimbus]], the primary cloud producing [[thunderstorm]]s.  The pileus and [[mammatus]] types can form at various altitude ranges depending on the main clouds with which they are associated.  The [[World Meteorological Organization]] classifies most accessory clouds as ''supplementary features''.  The height range classification of a supplementary feature is the same as the parent cloud.  As an example, the anvil cloud (supplementary feature [[incus]]) forms at high altitude but is not classified by the WMO as a high cloud because of its association with the genus cumulonimbus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = World Meteorological Organization | title = WMO cloud classifications | year = 1995 | url = http://www.weatheranswer.com/public/Clouds_WMO.pdf | accessdate = 2012-01-23 | authorlink = World Meteorological Organization}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Precipitation ==
It is ''very rare'' for any accessory cloud to generate its own precipitation. However, the parent cloud may generate precipitation. Precipitation from the parent cloud is often confused with the accessory cloud and observers think that the precipitation is actually falling from the accessory cloud.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The '''Aeromedical Biological Containment System''' (ABCS) is an [[aeromedical evacuation]] capability devised by the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) in collaboration with the U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) and government contractor [[Phoenix Air]] between 2007 and 2010. Its purpose is to safely air-transport a highly contagious patient; it comprises a transit [[Isolation (health care)|isolator]] (a tent-like plastic structure provided with [[Negative room pressure|negative air pressure]] to prevent escape of airborne-contagious pathogens) and an appropriately configured supporting aircraft. Originally developed to support CDC staff who might become infected while investigating [[avian flu]] and [[SARS]] in East Asia, it was never used until the 2014 [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa]], transporting 36 Ebola patients out of West Africa.

==History==
The CDC experienced difficulties and embarrassment relating to safe patient air-transport during an international [[2007 tuberculosis scare|tuberculosis scare in 2007]].&lt;ref name=Park&gt;Park, Alice. [http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1627159,00.html "The TB Scare: A Broken System?"] ''Time''. May 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the memory of the [[severe acute respiratory syndrome]] (SARS) epidemic of 2003-2004 and the then-current [[avian influenza]] threat (both potentially requiring transport of sick patients back to the U.S. from the Far East) prompted CDC officials to initiate the program that became the ABCS. The [[Cartersville, Georgia]]-based military airlift provider [[Phoenix Air]] was contracted; the CDC provided medical expertise to the collaboration, while the DoD provided some of the protective technology &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/ainalerts/2014-08-05/aeromed-giii-flies-american-ebola-patients-back-us Trautvetter, Chad, "Aeromed GIII Flies American Ebola Patients Back to U.S.," AIN Online, August 5, 2014, 3:18 PM.]&lt;/ref&gt; through its [[Edgewood Chemical Biological Center]].&lt;ref&gt;ECBC Public Affairs (16 March 2015), [http://www.ecbc.army.mil/news/2015/ecbc-engineers-played-key-role-containment-system-transport-americans-ebola.html "ECBC Engineers Played Key Role in Containment System used to Transport Americans with Ebola"]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the anticipated decommissioning of the [[U.S. Army]]’s [[Aeromedical Isolation Team]] (AIT) in December 2010, the need for a new system to support transport of highly contagious patients became even more urgent. By that time, the ABCS had been extensively tested and was certified for its mission by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA). The [[U.S. Air Force]] had also approved it for ferrying military personnel. The dedicated air platform for the ABCS was a 32-year-old [[Gulfstream III]] jet that had once been owned and operated by the [[Royal Danish Air Force]] as military tailcode “F-313”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/this-amazing-jet-will-transport-ebola-victims-from-afri-1614420685 Rogoway, Tyler, "This Amazing Jet Will Transport Ebola Victims From Africa To The U.S.," foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com, August 1, 2014, 8:07 a.m.]&lt;/ref&gt; (F-313 had been sold to Phoenix Air in January 2005. Rechristened as air ambulance jet “N173PA”, it was utilized in support of the 2007 TB incident.)

The [[2009 flu pandemic|international swine flu pandemic of 2009-10]] did not occasion the need for air-transport under isolation of any CDC personnel. Consequently, the ABCS—which comprised three isolation units (but only one aircraft) by late-2011—was to some extent mothballed. That changed abruptly in late-July 2014 when Phoenix Air was asked if they could support a patient with a “bloodborne pathogen” (namely [[Ebola virus]]) as well as it could an “airborne pathogen” (such as TB or flu, for which it had been designed).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2014/09/very-few-aircraft-equipped-evacuate-ebola-patients Roos, Robert, "Very few aircraft equipped to evacuate Ebola patients," Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), September 16, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians from Phoenix, along with CDC experts, spent a day and a half reviewing the system, after which they all agreed it was suitable for Ebola patients. "In fact, it's probably over-engineered for Ebola, because it's designed for airborne pathogens," the Phoenix director stated. On 2 August 2014, the ABCS carried the first Ebola patient (Dr. Kent Brantly, an employee of [[Samaritan's Purse]]) ever to be evacuated to the [[United States]]; three days later, it transported another, Nancy Writebol. To date, Phoenix Air and the ABCS have flown five Ebola patients out of West Africa (four Americans—Brantly, Writebol, Dr Rick Sacra, and an unidentified American on September 9  --  and a German doctor from Sierra Leone to Hamburg, Germany).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2014/10/28/the-world-relies-on-this-one-company-to-fly-ebola-patients/ Hicks, Josh, "The whole world relies on this one U.S. company to fly Ebola patients," washingtonpost.com, October 28, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;
After the first two missions, Phoenix Air—which says it considered them successful "proof-of-concept flights"—decided that it would only undertake future missions under the aegis of the U.S. government. Challenges such as dealing with U.S. customs officials, obtaining permission to transit foreign airspace, and the selection of specific destination medical centers had become too onerous. Since then, the U.S. Department of State has coordinated all such flights, including those for foreigners returning to their own countries. U.S. taxpayers pick up the tab for official government patients, but reimbursement is required for all others. (Brantly and Writebol each cost about $200,000, including the cost of equipment decontamination, which their organization paid.)

Phoenix Air currently keeps only one plane on standby for transporting Ebola victims.

==Operation==
The modular ABCS utilizes a transit isolator consisting of a metal frame supporting numerous items of medical equipment (heart and pulse oxygen monitors, etc.). Most of airframe’s cabin space is taken up by the isolator. The framework is encased in a transparent plastic sheathing, or “tent”. Only one patient—attended by one doctor and two nurses—can be accommodated in one isolator in one aircraft. The patient area is provided with continuous [[negative air pressure]] and [[air filtration]] to keep pathogens from entering the rest of the cabin. An antechamber to the patient area is used by medical personnel for donning and doffing [[personal protective equipment]] as well as for decontamination. Next to the isolator is a toilet for the patient’s use.

After transport of an infected patient is completed, Phoenix Air performs a decontamination process stipulated by the CDC. This consists of spraying a powerful disinfectant inside the module for 24 hours and sending all contaminated contents — including the plastic casing, patient stretchers, and even walkie-talkies — to an incinerator (operated by a federally licensed hazardous-materials disposal team) for burning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20418">[[File:PhosphComby.jpg|thumb|The four common allotropes of phosphorus]]
Elemental [[phosphorus]] can exist in several [[allotropy|allotropes]], the most common of which are white and red solids. Solid violet and black allotropes are also known.  Gaseous phosphorus exists as [[diphosphorus]] and atomic phosphorus.[[File:PhosphorusAllotropes.svg|thumb|White phosphorus and resulting [[allotrope]]s]]

==White phosphorus==
{{About|the chemistry of white phosphorus|military applications|white phosphorus munitions|section=yes}}
[[File:Weißer Phosphor.JPG|thumb|White phosphorus sample]]
'''White phosphorus''', '''yellow phosphorus''' or simply '''tetraphosphorus''' (P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) exists as [[molecules]] made up of four [[atoms]] in a tetrahedral structure. The [[tetrahedral]] arrangement results in [[ring strain]] and instability. The molecule is described as consisting of six single P–P bonds. Two different crystalline forms are known. The α form is defined as the [[standard state]] of the element, but is actually [[Metastability#Chemistry|metastable]] under standard conditions.&lt;ref name=HS&gt;{{Housecroft2nd|page=392}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a body-centered cubic crystal structure, and transforms reversibly into the β form at 195.2 K. The β form is believed to have a hexagonal crystal structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Durif|first1=M.-T. Averbuch-Pouchot ; A.|title=Topics in phosphate chemistry|date=1996|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore [u.a.]|isbn=978-981-02-2634-3|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White phosphorus is a translucent [[wax]]y solid that quickly becomes yellow when exposed to light. For this reason it is also called yellow phosphorus. It glows greenish in the dark (when exposed to oxygen) and is highly [[flammable]] and [[pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]] (self-igniting) upon contact with air. It is [[toxicity|toxic]], causing severe [[hepatotoxicity|liver damage]] on ingestion and [[phossy jaw]] from chronic ingestion or inhalation. The odour of combustion of this form has a characteristic garlic smell, and samples are commonly coated with white "[[phosphorus pentoxide|diphosphorus pentoxide]]", which consists of P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedral with oxygen inserted between the phosphorus atoms and at their vertices. White phosphorus is only slightly soluble in water and can be stored under water. Indeed, white phosphorus is safe from self-igniting only when it is submerged in water.  It is soluble in [[benzene]], [[oils]], [[carbon disulfide]], and [[disulfur dichloride]].

===Production and applications===
The white allotrope can be produced using several different methods. In the industrial process, [[phosphate rock]] is heated in an electric or fuel-fired [[furnace]] in the presence of [[carbon]] and [[silica]].&lt;ref name="threlfall"&gt;Threlfall, R.E., (1951). ''100 years of Phosphorus Making: 1851–1951''. Oldbury: [[Albright and Wilson]] Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;  Elemental phosphorus is then liberated as a vapour and can be collected under [[phosphoric acid]].  An idealized equation for this [[carbothermal reaction]] is shown for [[calcium phosphate]] (although phosphate rock contains substantial amounts of [[fluoroapatite]]):
: 2 Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  8 C   →   P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  8 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  6 Ca

[[File:Tetraphosphorus-liquid-2D-dimensions.png|thumb|Tetraphosphorus molecule]]
White phosphorus has an appreciable [[Vapor pressure|vapour pressure]] at ordinary temperatures. The [[vapour density]] indicates that the vapour is composed of P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; molecules up to about 800&amp;nbsp;°C. Above that temperature, dissociation into [[diphosphorus|P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] molecules occurs.

It ignites spontaneously in air at about {{convert|50|C}}, and at much lower temperatures if finely divided. This combustion gives phosphorus (V) oxide:
:{{chem|P|4}} + 5 {{chem|O|2}} → {{chem|P|4|O|10}}
Because of this property, [[White phosphorus munitions|white phosphorus is used as a weapon]].

===Non-existence of cubic-P&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;===
Although white phosphorus converts to the thermodynamically more stable red allotrope, the formation of the cubic P&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; molecule is not observed in the condensed phase.  Analogs of this hypothetical molecule have been prepared from [[phosphaalkyne]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/anie.199504361|title=Phosphaalkyne Cyclooligomers: From Dimers to Hexamers—First Steps on the Way to Phosphorus–Carbon Cage Compounds|year=1995|last1=Streubel|first1=Rainer|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English|volume=34|pages=436–438|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Red phosphorus==
[[File:Phosphor rot.jpg|thumb|Red phosphorus]]
[[File:Červený fosfor2.gif|thumb|left|Red phosphorus structure]]

'''Red phosphorus''' may be formed by heating [[white phosphorus]] to {{convert|300|C}} &lt;!-- (482&amp;nbsp;°F)--&gt; in the absence of air or by exposing white phosphorus to [[sunlight]].  Red phosphorus exists as an [[amorphous]] network.  Upon further heating, the amorphous red phosphorus crystallizes. Red phosphorus does not ignite in air at temperatures below {{convert|240|C}}, whereas pieces of white phosphorus ignite at about {{convert|30|C}}. Ignition is spontaneous at room temperature with finely divided material.

Under standard conditions it is more stable than white phosphorus, but less stable than the thermodynamically stable black phosphorus. The [[standard enthalpy of formation]] of red phosphorus is -17.6 kJ/mol.&lt;ref name=HS/&gt;

=== Applications ===
Red phosphorus can be used as a very effective [[flame retardant]], especially in [[thermoplastic]]s (e.g. [[polyamide]]) and [[thermosets]] (e.g. [[epoxy resins]] or [[polyurethane]]s). The flame retarding effect is based on the formation of [[Phosphoric acids and phosphates|polyphosphoric acid]]. Together with the organic polymer material, this acid creates a char which prevents the propagation of the flames. The safety risks associated with [[phosphine]] generation and [[friction sensitivity]] of red phosphorus can be effectively reduced by stabilization and [[micro-encapsulation]]. For easier handling, red phosphorus is often used in form of dispersions or masterbatches in various carrier systems. However, for electronic/electrical systems, red phosphorus flame retardant has been [http://resources.dfrsolutions.com/Webcasts/2015/Red-Phosphorus-Reliability-Alert.pdf effectively banned] by major OEMs due to its tendency to induce premature failures. There have been two issues over the years: the first was red phosphorus in epoxy molding compounds inducing elevated leakage current in semiconductor devices&lt;ref&gt;Craig Hillman, Red Phosphorus Induced Failures in Encapsulated Circuits, https://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/Resources/services/Red-Phosphorus-Induced-Failures-in-Encapsulated-Circuits.pdf?t=1513022462214&lt;/ref&gt; and the second was acceleration of [[hydrolysis]] reactions in [[Polybutylene terephthalate|PBT]] insulating material.&lt;ref&gt;Dock Brown, The Return of the Red Retardant, SMTAI 2015, https://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/Resources/services/The-Return-of-the-Red-Retardant.pdf?t=1513022462214&lt;/ref&gt;

Red phosphorus can also be used in the illicit production of narcotics, including some recipes for [[methamphetamine]].

'''Monoclinic phosphorus''', or '''violet phosphorus''', is also known as '''Hittorf's metallic phosphorus'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Curry|first1=Roger|title=Hittorf's Metallic Phosphorus of 1865|url=http://lateralscience.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/main-menu-click-above-p-h-o-s-p-h-o-r-u.html|website=LATERAL SCIENCE|accessdate=16 November 2014|date=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monoclinic phosphorus formed from vapor in the presence of an alkali metal {{US patent|4620968}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865, [[Johann Wilhelm Hittorf]] heated red phosphorus in a sealed tube at 530&amp;nbsp;°C. The upper part of the tube was kept at 444&amp;nbsp;°C. Brilliant opaque [[monoclinic]], or [[rhombohedral]], crystals sublimed as a result. Violet phosphorus can also be prepared by dissolving white phosphorus in molten [[lead]] in a sealed tube at 500&amp;nbsp;°C for 18 hours. Upon slow cooling, Hittorf's allotrope [[Crystallization|crystallises]] out. The crystals can be revealed by dissolving the lead in dilute [[nitric acid]] followed by boiling in concentrated [[hydrochloric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Annalen der Physik|volume = 202|issue = 10|pages =193–228|year =1865|title = Zur Kenntniss des Phosphors|first = W.|last = Hittorf|doi = 10.1002/andp.18652021002|bibcode = 1865AnP...202..193H }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a [[fibrous]] form exists with similar phosphorus cages.

===Reactions of violet phosphorus===
It does not ignite in air until heated to 300&amp;nbsp;°C and is insoluble in all solvents.  It is not attacked by [[alkali]] and only slowly reacts with [[halogens]].  It can be [[oxidised]] by [[nitric acid]] to [[phosphoric acid]].

If it is heated in an atmosphere of inert gas, for example [[nitrogen]] or [[carbon dioxide]], it [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimes]] and the vapour condenses as white phosphorus. If it is heated in a [[vacuum]] and the vapour condensed rapidly, violet phosphorus is obtained. It would appear that violet phosphorus is a [[polymer]] of high relative molecular mass, which on heating breaks down into P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. On cooling, these would normally [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimerize]] to give P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; molecules (i.e. white phosphorus) but, [[in vacuo]], they link up again to form the polymeric violet allotrope.

'''Black phosphorus''' is the thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus at [[room temperature and pressure]], with a [[Standard enthalpy of formation|heat of formation]] of -39.3 kJ/mol (relative to white phosphorus which is defined as the standard state).&lt;ref name=HS/&gt; It is obtained by heating white phosphorus under high pressures (12,000 atmospheres).

[[File:Diphosphorus-3D-vdW.png|thumb|left|Structure of diphosphorus]]

The '''diphosphorus''' allotrope (P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can normally be obtained only under extreme conditions (for example, from P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at 1100 kelvin). In 2006,  the diatomic molecule was generated in homogenous solution under normal conditions with the use of [[transition metal]] [[complex (chemistry)|complexes]] (for example, [[tungsten]] and [[niobium]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1126/science.1129630|year = 2006|author1=Piro, Na |author2=Figueroa, Js |author3=Mckellar, Jt |author4=Cummins, Cc |title = Triple-bond reactivity of diphosphorus molecules|volume = 313|issue = 5791|pages = 1276–9|pmid = 16946068|journal = Science|bibcode = 2006Sci...313.1276P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diphosphorus is the gaseous form of [[phosphorus]], and the thermodynamically stable form between 1200&amp;nbsp;°C and 2000&amp;nbsp;°C.  The dissociation of tetraphosphorus ({{chem|P|4}}) begins at lower temperature: the percentage of {{chem|P|2}} at 800&amp;nbsp;°C is ≈&amp;nbsp;1%. At temperatures above about 2000&amp;nbsp;°C, the diphosphorus molecule begins to dissociate into atomic phosphorus.

[[File:Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter.jpg|thumbnail|This AFCI (the circuit breaker with the yellow label) is an older generation AFCI circuit breaker. The current (as of 2013) devices are referred to as "combination type" and usually appear with a green label.]]

An '''arc-fault circuit interrupter''' ('''AFCI''') also known as an '''arc-fault detection device''' ('''AFDD''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Do you know an Arc Fault Detection Device (AFDD) can prevent from an electrical fire? |url=https://blog.schneider-electric.com/power-management-metering-monitoring-power-quality/2013/07/03/do-you-know-an-arc-fault-detection-device-afdd-can-prevent-from-an-electrical-fire/ |publisher=Schneider Electric}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[circuit breaker]] that breaks the circuit when it detects an [[electric arc]] in the circuit it protects to prevent electrical fires. An AFCI selectively distinguishes between a harmless arc (incidental to normal operation of switches, plugs, and brushed motors), and a potentially dangerous arc (that can occur, for example, in a lamp cord which has a broken conductor).

AFCI breakers have been required for circuits feeding electrical outlets in residential bedrooms by the electrical codes of [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] since the beginning of the 21st century; the U.S. ''[[National Electrical Code]]'' has required them to protect most residential outlets since 2014,&lt;ref&gt;2014 NEC(210.12)&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Canadian Electrical Code]]'' has since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=2015 |title=C22.1-15—Canadian Electrical Code, Part I: Safety Standard for Electrical Installations |publisher=Canadian Standards Association |edition=23rd |isbn=978-1-77139-718-6 |page=Rules 24–724(f) &amp; (g) |nopp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parts of the world using 230 V, where the higher voltage implies lower currents, specifically Western Europe and the UK, adoption is slower, and their use is optional, except in high risk cases.

In the USA, arc faults are one of the leading causes for residential electrical fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Technology for Preventing Residential Electrical Fires: Arc-Fault Circuit Interrupters (AFCIs)|work=Fire Technology|volume=36|issue=3|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|date=Aug 2000|pages=145–162|url=http://www.cpsc.gov//PageFiles/108737/AFCIFireTechnology.pdf|doi=10.1023/A:1015410726786|first=Douglas A.|last=Lee|first2=Andrew M.|last2=Trotta|first3=William H.|last3=King|issn=0015-2684|accessdate=Feb 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year in the United States, over 40,000 fires are attributed to home electrical wiring. These fires result in over 350 deaths and over 1,400 injuries each year.&lt;ref&gt;Ault, Singh, and Smith, "1996 Residential Fire Loss Estimates", October 1998, U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Directorate for Epidemiology and Health Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional circuit breakers only respond to [[overcurrent|overloads]] and [[short circuit]]s, so they do not protect against arcing conditions that produce erratic, and often reduced current. An AFCI is selective so that normal arcs do not cause it to trip.  The AFCI circuitry continuously monitors the current and discriminates between normal and unwanted arcing conditions. Once detected, the AFCI opens its internal contacts, thus de-energizing the circuit and reducing the potential for a fire to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Source:"Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter (AFCI)FACT SHEET" accessed from http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PUBS/afcifac8.PDF, July 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operating principle==
The [[electronics]] inside an AFCI breaker detect electrical current alternating at characteristic frequencies, usually around 100&amp;nbsp;kHz, known to be associated with wire arcing, which are sustained for more than a few milliseconds.  A ''combination AFCI breaker'' provides protection against parallel arcing (line to neutral), series arcing (a loose, broken, or otherwise high resistance segment in a single line), ground arcing (from line, or neutral, to ground), overload protection and short circuit protection.

AFCI receptacles contain electronic components to monitor a circuit for the presence of dangerous arcing conditions.  Based upon an established threshold in the sine wave, the AFCI can be triggered to quickly react and de-power a circuit if dangerous arcing is detected.

When installed as the first outlet on a branch circuit, AFCI receptacles provide series arc protection for the entire branch circuit. They also provide parallel arc protection for the branch circuit starting at the AFCI receptacle.  Unlike AFCI breakers, AFCI receptacles may be used on any wiring system regardless of the panel.

==US and Canada electrical code requirements==
Starting with the 1999 version of the ''National Electrical Code'' in the United States, and the 2002 version of the ''Canadian Electrical Code'' in Canada, the national codes require AFCIs in all circuits that feed outlets in bedrooms of dwelling units.  As of the 2014 NEC, AFCI protection is required on all branch circuits supplying outlets or devices installed in dwelling unit kitchens, along with the 2008 NEC additions of family rooms, dining rooms, living rooms, parlors, libraries, dens, bedrooms, sunrooms, recreation rooms, closets, hallways, laundry areas, and similar rooms and areas. They are also required in dormitory units. This requirement may be accomplished by using a "combination type" breaker—a specific kind of circuit-breaker defined by [[Underwriters Laboratories|UL]] 1699—in the breaker panel that provides combined arc-fault and [[overcurrent]] protection or by using an AFCI receptacle for modifications/extensions, as replacement receptacles or in new construction, at the first outlet on the branch. Not all U.S. jurisdictions have adopted the NEC's AFCI requirements so it is important to check local code requirements.

The AFCI is intended to prevent fire from arcs. AFCI circuit breakers are designed to meet one of two standards as specified by UL 1699: "branch" type or "combination" type (note: the Canadian Electrical Code uses different terminology but similar technical requirements). A branch type AFCI trips on 75 amperes of arcing current from the line wire to either the neutral or ground wire.  A combination type adds series arcing detection to branch type performance.  Combination type AFCIs trip on 5 amperes of series arcing.

AFCI receptacles are an alternative solution to AFCI breakers. These receptacles are designed to address the dangers associated with both types of potentially hazardous arcing:  parallel and series.  AFCI receptacles offer the benefit of localized ''test'' and ''reset'' with such buttons located on the face of the device.  This is very convenient and saves a journey to the breaker panel.

In 2002, the NEC removed the word "receptacle", leaving "outlets", with the effect that lights and other wired-in devices such as ceiling fans within bedrooms were added to the requirement. The 2005 code made it clearer that all outlets must be protected despite discussion in the code-making panel about excluding bedroom smoke detectors from the requirement. "Outlets" as defined in the NEC includes receptacles, light fixtures and smoke alarms, among other things.  Basically, any point where electricity is used to power something is an outlet.

As of January 2008, only "combination type" AFCIs meet the NEC requirement. The 2008 NEC requires the installation of combination-type AFCIs in all 15 and 20 ampere residential circuits with the exception of laundries, kitchens, bathrooms, garages, and unfinished basements, though many of these require GFCI protection. The 2014 NEC adds kitchens and laundry rooms to the list of rooms requiring AFCI circuitry, as well as any devices (such as lighting) requiring protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iaeimagazine.org/magazine/2015/05/22/whats-new-about-afcis-in-the-2014-nec/ |title=What’s NEW about AFCIs in the 2014 NEC? ‹ IAEI Magazine |website=Iaeimagazine.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK the 2018 edition of the wiring regulations is the first edition to make any mention of arc fault devices, and indicate they may be installed if the design has an unusually high risk of fire from arc faults. The annexes relating to testing indicate than when AFDDs are installed, their correct operation must be verified before completion, but the method of testing is not described. This is in contrast to  [[Residual-current device|RCDs]] where a number of trip times at different fault current levels must be verified. &lt;ref&gt;IET website wiring matters|https://electrical.theiet.org/wiring-matters/issues/71/&lt;/ref&gt;
The German Wiring rules VDE 100, recommend AFDDs for high risk situations, and lists old peoples care homes, community centres  and Kindergartens as examples.

==Limitations==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}
AFCIs are designed to protect against fires caused by electrical arc faults.  While the sensitivity of the AFCIs helps in the detection of arc faults, these breakers can also indicate false positives by identifying normal circuit behaviors as arc faults.  For instance, lightning strikes provide voltage and current profiles that resemble arc faults, and vacuum cleaners and some laser printers trip AFCIs.  This nuisance tripping reduces the overall effectiveness of AFCIs.  Research into advancements in this area is being pursued.&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, James, Ph.D. "[http://cdn.livewireinnovation.com/pdf/aas-conference-paper-upload.pdf Eliminating False Positives in the Detection and Location of sub 3ms Faults on AC/DC Lines] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925205045/http://cdn.livewireinnovation.com/pdf/aas-conference-paper-upload.pdf |date=September 25, 2015 }}" presented at the 2011 Aircraft Airworthiness &amp; Sustainment Conference on April 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, AFCIs provide no specific protection against ''glowing'' connections also known as a [[High Resistance Connection]], excess current, high line voltages or low line voltages.  AFCI circuit breakers include a standard inverse-time circuit breaker.  &lt;!--''Add as refs in the later text of the article or make a sentence describing the fires and add as refs'': For descriptions of electrical fire causes see "How Electricity Starts Fires" John S Robison, P.E., Electrical Line magazine, November / December 2007 issue, pages 60–70 (http://www.electricalline.com/); NFPA 921 "Guide for Fire and Explosion Investigations", 2004 edition; and "Ignition Handbook", Dr. Vytenis Babrauskas, Fire Science Publishers, 2003.  --&gt;  Glowing connections occur when relatively high current exists in a relatively large resistance object. Heat comes from power dissipation.  This energy, when dissipated in a small junction area, can generate temperatures above 1000&amp;nbsp;°C (1800&amp;nbsp;°F) and can ignite most flammable materials.&lt;ref&gt;J.J. Shea, "Glowing Contact Physics," IEEE Holm Conference on Electrical Contacts, Montreal, Canada, Sept. pp. 48-57, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bad wiring junctions can occur in utilization equipment, cords, or in-situ wiring and especially in a defective switch, socket, plug, wiring connection and even at the circuit breaker or fuse panels. Terminal screws loosened by vibration, improper tightening or other causes offer increased resistance to the current, with consequent [[aluminum wire#Coefficient of expansion and creep|heating and potential thermal creep]], which will cause the termination to loosen further and exacerbate the heating effect. In North America, high resistance junctions are sometimes observed at the terminations of [[aluminum wire]] circuits, where oxidation has caused increased resistance, resulting in thermal creep. No technology located in a circuit breaker or fuse panel could detect a high-resistance wiring fault as no measurable characteristic exists that differentiates a glow fault from normal branch circuit operation. '''Power Fault Circuit Interrupters''' ('''PFCI''') located in receptacles are designed to prevent fires caused by glowing connections in wiring or panels.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}  From the receptacle a PFCI can detect the voltage drop when high current exists in a high resistance junction. In a properly designed and maintained circuit, substantial voltage drops should never occur.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Proper wire terminations inside utilization equipment, such as appliances, and cords prevent high-resistance connections that could lead to fires.

An AFCI does not detect high line voltage due to an open neutral in a [[multiwire branch circuit]]. A multiwire branch circuit has both energized wires of a 120-240 V [[split phase]] service. If the neutral is broken, devices connected from a 120 V leg to the neutral may experience excess voltage, up to twice normal.

AFCIs do not detect low line voltage. Low line voltage can cause [[electromechanical relay]]s to repeatedly turn off and on. If current is flowing through the load contacts it causes arcing across the contacts as they open. The arcing can oxidize, pit and melt the contacts. This process can increase the contact resistance, superheat the relay and lead to fires. Power fault circuit interrupters are designed to prevent fires from low voltage across loads.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

AFCIs are also known to be sensitive (false tripping) to the presence of radio frequency energy, especially within the so-called ''high frequency'' spectrum (3-30&amp;nbsp;MHz) which include legitimate [[Citizens Band]] and Amateur Radio operations.  Sensitivities and mitigation have been known since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arrl.org/news/arrl-helps-manufacturer-to-resolve-arc-fault-circuit-interrupter-rfi-problems |title=ARRL Helps Manufacturer to Resolve Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter RFI Problems |website=Arrl.org |date=2013-11-19 |accessdate=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interference with power line networking==
AFCIs may interfere with the operation of some [[power line communication]] technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/lanwan/lanwan-reviews/30888-a-work-in-progress-belkin-gigabit-powerline-hd-starter-kit-reviewed?start=4 |title=A Work In Progress: Belkin Gigabit Powerline HD Starter Kit Reviewed |website=SmallNetBuilder |date= |accessdate=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BioEthanol for Sustainable Transport (BEST)''' was a four-year project financially supported by the [[European Union]] for promoting the introduction and market penetration of [[ethanol fuel|bioethanol]] as a vehicle fuel, and the introduction and wider use of [[flexible-fuel vehicle]]s and ethanol-powered vehicles on the world market. The project began in January 2006 and continued until the end of 2009, and had nine participating regions or cities in Europe, [[Brazil]], and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.best-europe.org/Pages/ContentPage.aspx?id=87|title=About BEST|publisher=BioEthanol for Sustainable Transport |accessdate=2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
The BEST project targets included the introduction of more than 10,000 [[flexible-fuel vehicle|flex-fuel]] or ethanol cars and 160 [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]] buses; to promote the opening of 135 [[E85]] and 13 [[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#ED95|ED95]] public fuel stations; and to promote the development and testing of hydrous E15 and anhydrous [[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E5, E7, E10|low ethanol blends]] with [[gasoline]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.best-europe.org/Pages/ContentPage.aspx?id=88|title=BEST Targets|publisher=BioEthanol for Sustainable Transport |accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cenbio.iee.usp.br/download/publicacoes/bestagrener18jun2008.pdf|format=PDF|title=Projeto BEST – Bioetanol para o Transporte Sustentável|publisher=IEE/CENBIO, [[Universidade de São Paulo]]|author=Moreira|date=2008-06-18|accessdate=2008-11-22|language=Portuguese|display-authors=etal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702030526/http://cenbio.iee.usp.br/download/publicacoes/bestagrener18jun2008.pdf|archivedate=2010-07-02|df=}} ''Abstract also presented in English''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==
There were ten participating cities and regions, and several commercial partners. [[Stockholm]] ([[Sweden]]) was the coordinating city, and other participants were [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and [[Madrid]] ([[Spain]]), the Biofuel Region in Sweden, [[Brandenburg]] ([[Germany]]), [[La Spezia]] ([[Italy]]), [[Nanyang, Henan|Nanyang]] ([[China]]), [[Rotterdam]] ([[Netherlands]]), [[São Paulo]] ([[Brazil]]), and [[Somerset]] ([[UK]]). The commercial partners were [[Ford Europe]], [[Saab Automobile]] and several bioethanol suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.best-europe.org/Pages/ContentPage.aspx?id=87|title=About BEST:|publisher=BioEthanol for Sustainable Transport |accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implemented projects==

===Flexible-fuel vehicles===
A major activity in BEST was the promotion of [[E85]] [[flexifuel vehicle]]s (FFVs). During the project nine BEST sites introduced over 77,000 FFVs, far exceeding the original project's target of 10,000 vehicles. In 2008, out of the 170,000 flexifuel vehicles in operation in Europe, 45% of the vehicles operated at BEST sites; and out of 2,200 E85 pumps installed in the EU, 80% are found in the BEST countries. Sweden stands out with 70% of all flexifuel vehicles operating in the EU. BEST sites also evaluated both dedicated E85 pumps and flexifuel pumps and found very few problems.&lt;ref name=BESTReport&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eve.es/ecomovil/pdf/BEST_FinalReport.pdf|title=BioEthanol for Sustainable Transport: Results and recommendations from the European BEST project|author=BEST Cities and Regions|publisher=Environmental and Health Administration, City of Stockholm|year=2009|accessdate=2011-05-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930040041/http://www.eve.es/ecomovil/pdf/BEST_FinalReport.pdf|archivedate=2010-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethanol-powered buses===
[[File:E85bus.jpg|thumb|[[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#ED95|ED95]]-powered [[Scania OmniCity]] bus in [[Stockholm]].]]
The project included demonstration of two types of bioethanol-powered buses, a [[diesel engine]] [[Scania AB|Scania]] bus running on [[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#ED95|ED95]] ([[sugarcane ethanol]] plus an ignition improver) and a [[Dongfeng Motor|Dongfeng]] bus capable of running on both [[Gasohol#E100|E100]] and petrol ([[flexible-fuel]] bus). Fuel pumps were also installed at bus depots in the five participating cities.&lt;ref name=BESTReport/&gt;

BEST demonstrated more than 138 bioethanol [[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#ED95|ED95]] buses and 12 ED95 pumps at five sites, three in Europe, one in China and one in Brazil. These trials helped increase knowledge about bioethanol buses in the participating cities. An innovation within BEST was the demonstration of two dual-tank [[Gasohol#E100|E100]] buses developed by the Chinese vehicle producer [[Dongfeng Motor]]. All BEST sites will continue to drive their bioethanol buses in regular traffic and some cities are already planning to expand their fleets.&lt;ref name=BESTReport/&gt;&lt;ref name=BESTbus/&gt;

The trial demonstrations showed that ethanol-powered ED95 buses:&lt;ref name=BESTReport/&gt;&lt;ref name=BESTbus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.best-europe.org/Pages/ContentPage.aspx?id=113|title=Buses: 138 buses in five places|author=BEST|publisher=BEST Europe|year=2009|accessdate=2011-05-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905102836/http://www.best-europe.org/Pages/ContentPage.aspx?id=113|archivedate=2011-09-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*reduce greenhouse gas emissions and local air pollution.
*are reliable and appreciated by drivers and passengers.
*cost more to purchase and operate than diesel buses.
*require more scheduled maintenance than diesel buses.
*Taxing fuel by volume instead of energy content penalises bioethanol buses.
*ED95 can be safely handled at depots and has potential for wider use in heavy vehicles such as trucks.

During the first year trial period performance and emissions were monitored by the National Reference Center on Biomass (CENBIO - {{lang-pt|Centro Nacional de Referência em Biomassa}}) at the [[Universidade de São Paulo]], and compared with similar diesel models, with special attention to [[carbon monoxide]] and [[Diesel particulate matter|particulate matter]] emissions.&lt;ref name=SWE/&gt; Performance is also important as previous tests have shown a reduction in fuel economy of around 60% when E95 is compared to regular diesel.&lt;ref name=SaoBEST/&gt;

In November 2009, a second ED95 bus began operating in [[São Paulo]] city. The bus was a Swedish Scania engine and chassis with a CAIO bus body. The second bus was scheduled to operate between [[Lapa, São Paulo|Lapa]] and [[Vila Mariana (district of São Paulo)|Vila Mariana]], passing through [[Avenida Paulista]], one of the main business centers of [[São Paulo]] city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cenbio.iee.usp.br/destaques/2009/eventobest.htm|title=São Paulo recebe segundo ônibus movido a etanol|author=Fernando Saker|publisher=Centro Nacional de Referência em Biomassa|date=2009-11-13|accessdate=2011-05-28|language=Portuguese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813082156/http://cenbio.iee.usp.br/destaques/2009/eventobest.htm|archivedate=2011-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CENBIO laboratory tests found that as compared to diesel, [[carbon dioxide]] emissions are 80% lower with ED95, particulate drops by 90%, [[nitrogen oxide]] emissions are 62% lower, and there are no [[sulphur]] emissions.&lt;ref name=EthanolBus1/&gt; During the trial was observed that the first bus began presenting sudden halts of the engine in slow running. The problem manifested more frequently in hot days, when the ambient temperature reached  26&amp;nbsp;°C or more and on top of long grades. After analyzing carefully the problem in the engine's fuel power line, it was discovered that the bus was developed for the European temperate climate, where average temperatures are lower than in tropical climate. In hotter days, the temperature of the fuel line reached up to 58&amp;nbsp;°C, a temperature that could increase even more when the engine would be slow running. The excessive heating was causing the vaporization of the fuel in the power line of the engine. The solution found was to deviate the fuel return from the engine straight to the tank, and thus, adapting the engine to Brazilian climate conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cenbio.iee.usp.br/download/publicacoes/SAE_BEST_2010.pdf|title=Ethanol Usage in Urban Public Transportation - Presentation of Results|author1=Moreira, José Roberto|author2=Sandra Maria Apolinario|author3=Suani Teixeira Coelho|last-author-amp=yes|work=Brazilian Reference Center on Biomass (CENBIO)|year=2010|accessdate=2011-05-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529174731/http://cenbio.iee.usp.br/download/publicacoes/SAE_BEST_2010.pdf|archivedate=2011-05-29|df=}} Report 2010-36-0130I&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the satisfactory results obtained during the 3-year trial operation of the two buses, in November 2010 the municipal government of [[São Paulo]] city signed an agreement with [[UNICA, Brazil|UNICA]], [[Cosan]], [[Scania AB|Scania]] and  ''Viação Metropolitana''", a local bus operator, to introduce a fleet of 50 ethanol-powered ED95 buses by May 2011. The city's government objective is to reduce the [[carbon footprint]] of the city's bus fleet which is made of 15,000 diesel-powered buses, and the final goal is for the entire bus fleet to use only [[renewable fuel]]s by 2018 .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/noticias/0,,OI4811562-EI8139,00-Sao+Paulo+tera+primeira+frota+de+onibus+movida+a+etanol.html|title=São Paulo terá primeira frota de ônibus movida a etanol|work=[[Terra Networks]]|author=Reuters|author-link=Reuters|language=Portuguese|date=2010-11-25|accessdate=2010-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://estadao.br.msn.com/economia/artigo.aspx?cp-documentid=26500252 |title=Cosan fornecerá etanol para 50 ônibus de SP|work=[[O Estado de S.

====China====
In [[Nanyang, Henan]], a new type of bioethanol [[flexible-fuel]] bus capable of running on petrol or [[neat ethanol fuel]] (E100) was developed by [[Dongfeng Motor]]. The buses look like conventional buses and have two fuel tanks, one for petrol and one for E100. Two buses were demonstrated by local bioethanol producer Tianguan, who also supplied E100 for the buses. One fuel pump was set up for the trial. One of the buses uses a modified petrol-engine and the other uses a modified [[natural gas]] engine.&lt;ref name=BESTReport/&gt; The new bus types were developed to overcome import duties and are a low-cost alternative for Chinese cities seeking to introduce bioethanol to their public transport systems.&lt;ref name=BESTReport/&gt; Each E100 bus developed by Dongfeng costs around {{Euro|35,000}}, which is {{Euro|1,000}} more expensive than a conventional petrol bus.&lt;ref name=BestCosts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.best-europe.org/Pages/ContentPage.aspx?id=615|title=Higher Costs for Bioethanol Buses |publisher= BEST Europe|accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italy====
Three ED95 buses and one fuel pump was installed in [[La Spezia]].&lt;ref name=BESTReport/&gt;

'''Carbon profiling'''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;‘Carbon Profiling’ was published in The [[Architects Journal]] on the 26.03.09&lt;/ref&gt; is a mathematical process that calculates how much [[carbon dioxide]] is put into the atmosphere per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of space in a building over one year.

The analysis is in two parts which are then added together to produce an overall figure which is termed the ‘Carbon Profile’:
* operational [[Greenhouse gas|carbon emissions]] 
* embodied carbon emissions. 

'''Embodied carbon emissions''' relate to the amount of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere from creating and maintaining the materials that form the building e.g. the carbon dioxide released from the baking of bricks or smelting or iron. In the Carbon Profiling Model these emissions are measured as Embodied Carbon Efficiency (ECE), measured as kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/year.

Occupational Carbon Emissions relate to the amount of Carbon Dioxide emitted into the atmosphere from the direct use of energy to run the building e.g. the heating or electricity used by the building over the year. In the Carbon Profiling Model these emissions are measured in BER’s (Building Emission Rate) in kg of {{CO2}}/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/year.

The BER is a [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|United Kingdom government]] accepted [[Units of measurement|unit of measurement]] that comes from an approved calculation process called sBEM (Simplified Building Emission Model)

The purpose of Carbon Profiling&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; is to provide a method of analyzing and comparing both operational and embodied carbon emissions at the same time. With this information it is then possible to allocate a projects resources in such a way to minimize the total amount of Carbon Dioxide emitted into the atmosphere through the use of a given piece of space.

A secondary benefit is that having quantified the Carbon Profiling&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; of different buildings it is then possible to make comparisons and rank buildings in term of their performance. This allows investors and occupiers to identify which building are good and bad carbon investments.

[[Simon Sturgis]] and Gareth Roberts of Sturgis Associates in [[United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]] originally developed ‘Carbon Profiling’ in December 2007.

'''China Airlines Flight 642''' (operated by '''Mandarin Airlines''') was a flight that crashed at [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 22 August 1999. It was operating from [[Bangkok]] (Bangkok International Airport, now renamed [[Don Mueang International Airport]]) to [[Taipei]] with a stopover in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="arandard"&gt;Murphy, Colum. "[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/Metro/GB05Ak01.html Pilot error blamed for typhoon crash] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327141134/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/Metro/GB05Ak01.html |date=27 March 2009 }}." ''[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]''. 5 February 2005. Retrieved on 28 May 2011. Appears to have become a dead link: 24 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plane, a [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]] ([[Aircraft registration|registration]] {{Airreg|B|150|)}}, was operated by subsidiary [[Mandarin Airlines]] on behalf of [[China Airlines]]. While landing during a typhoon, it touched down hard, flipped over and caught fire. Of the 315 people on board, 312 survived and three were killed.

The route continues to operate today with the flight no longer originating in Bangkok and is strictly a Hong Kong-Taipei route. Bangkok-Hong Kong service ended on 31 October 2010. The route is now flown by a [[Boeing 747-400]] and Airbus A330-300.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CAL642|title=China Airlines (CI) #642 ✈ FlightAware|website=FlightAware|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flight 642 was one of only two hull losses of MD-11s with passenger configuration, the other being [[Swissair Flight 111]], which crashed in 1998 with 229 fatalities. All other hull losses of MD-11s have been when the aircraft has been serving as a cargo aircraft.

== Summary ==
At about 6:43 P.M. local time (1043 UTC) on 22 August 1999, the MD-11 was making its [[final approach (aviation)|final approach]] to runway 25L when [[1999 Pacific typhoon season#Severe Tropical Storm Sam (Luding)|Typhoon Sam]] was 50&amp;nbsp;km NE of the airport. At an altitude of 700 feet prior to touchdown a further wind check was reported to the crew: 320 deg/28 knots gusting to 36 knots. This resulted in a crosswind vector of 26 knots gusting to 33 knots, while the tested limit for the aircraft was {{convert|35|knots|km/h}}.

During the final flare to land, the plane rolled to the right, landed hard on its right main gear and the No. 3 engine touched the runway. The right wing separated from the fuselage. The aircraft continued to roll over and skidded off the runway in flames. When it stopped, it was on its back and the rear of the plane was on fire, coming to rest on a grass area next to the runway, 3500 ft from the runway threshold. The right wing was found on a taxiway 280ft from the nose of the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/199909/17/0917301.htm|title=Accident Bulletin on China Airlines|website=www.info.gov.hk|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown in photos of the aircraft at rest, the fire caused significant damage to the rear section of the aircraft but was quickly extinguished due to the heavy rain and quick response from rescue teams in the airport.

Three of the 300 passengers died; all 15 crew members survived.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

== Investigation ==
The final report of the accident blamed it mainly on pilot error; specifically the inability to arrest the high rate of descent existing at 50&amp;nbsp;ft altitude on the [[radar altimeter]]. The descent rate at touch down was 18–20&amp;nbsp;ft/s.

The flight data stored in the [[volatile memory]] of the aircraft's [[Quick Access Recorder]] (QAR) during the last 500&amp;nbsp;ft of the approach could not be recovered due to the interruption of the power supply at impact. Probable wind variations and the loss of headwind component, together with the early retardation of thrust levers, led to a 20 kt loss in [[indicated airspeed]] just prior to touchdown.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cad.gov.hk/reports/main1.pdf|title=Report on the accident to Boeing MD11 B-150 at Hong Kong International Airport on 22 August 1999|date=December 2004|website=www.cad.gov.hk|publisher=Civil Aviation Department: Hong Kong|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the severe weather conditions forecast for Hong Kong, the flight crew had prepared to divert the flight to Taipei if the situation at Hong Kong was deemed unsuitable for landing. Extra fuel was carried for this possibility, resulting in a landing weight of 429,557&amp;nbsp;lbs, or 99.897% [[maximum landing weight]] (mlw), which is {{convert|443|lb|kg|abbr=on}} below its mlw of {{convert|430,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. Based on the initial weather and wind check which was passed along to the crew from Hong Kong during the flight, they believed they could land there and decided against a diversion to Taipei. However four earlier flights had carried out missed approaches at Hong Kong and five had diverted.

During the final approach, the plane descended along the [[Instrument landing system|ILS]] glideslope until at about 700&amp;nbsp;ft, the crew visually acquired the runway. They disengaged the [[autopilot]] but left the autothrottle on. During the flare, the rate of descent was not arrested, the plane landed with the right wing slightly lower. The right landing gear touched down first, the right engine impacted the runway and the right wing was detached from the [[fuselage]]. Since the left wing was still attached, the lift from that wing rolled the fuselage onto its right side, and the plane came to rest inverted in the grass strip next to the runway. The spilled fuel caught fire.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Several suggestions were given to China Airlines concerning its training.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Media ==
The landing and crash of Flight 642 was recorded by nearby occupants in a car. The video which also captured reactions from the witnesses has been uploaded to websites such as YouTube and [[Airdisaster.com]].

A photo showing another Mandarin Airlines MD-11 taxiing past the remains of Flight 642 was circulated.

This disaster was also aired on [[RTHK]]'s ''[[Elite Brigade II]]'' Episode 2 in 2012.

Clean Air cab ceased operations November 2016. {{cn|date=November 2017}}  

==Description==

The main goal of the operation was to be an environmentally aware business, and to take action to mitigate the damage done by pollution while providing a reliable and competitive transportation service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleanaircab.com/home.php |title=Phoenix Taxi &amp;#124; Clean Air Cab - Arizona Taxi Cab Service |publisher=Clean Air Cab |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Launched in October 2009, it was the first subsidiary company of Beyond Green, L.L.C.

The taxi fleet once consisted of 29 [[Toyota Prius]] vehicles, whose hybrid design helped cut emissions by 66% compared to typical taxi fleets of [[Ford Crown Victoria]]s. Only vehicles that qualified as [[Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle]]s, which are hybrid vehicles that work to minimize air pollution, were used. Using hybrid vehicles helped the state of Arizona do its part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in compliance with the [[Western Climate Initiative]], which is "a collaboration of independent jurisdictions who commit to work together to identify, evaluate, and implement policies to tackle climate change at a regional level."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westernclimateinitiative.org/organization |title=Organization |publisher=Westernclimateinitiative.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company purchased [[carbon offset]]s and supported [[reforestation]] by subsidizing the planting of 10 rain forest trees monthly for each cab in service. {{cn|date=July 2017}} Their atmospheric carbon reduction partners were  Trees for Tempe at the local level, and [[Trees for the Future]] and [[Carbonfund.org]] on a global level.&lt;ref name="unep.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/climateneutral/Default.aspx?tabid=940 |title=UNEP Climate Neutral Network - Participants - Companies - Clean Air Cab |publisher=Unep.org |date=2011-02-22 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleanaircab.com/about/carbon_offsets.php |title=Clean Air Cab is the Valley's Only Certified Carbon Neutral Taxi Service |publisher=Cleanaircab.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008043712/http://www.cleanaircab.com/about/carbon_offsets.php# |archive-date=2009-10-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since October 19, 2009 over 15,000 trees had been planted.

==Charity involvement==
[[File:Susan G Komen Clean Air Cab.jpg|thumb|Portions of fares in the Susan G. Komen cab are donated to [[Susan G. Komen for the Cure]].]]
Clean Air Cab had a "Pink Cab", where some of the fares are donated to [[Susan G. Komen for the Cure]],.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.komenphoenix.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=nsKZL3PHLtF&amp;b=3753617&amp;ct=7676587&amp;notoc=1 |accessdate=May 20, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three more cabs were added in 2011, for the  Phoenix Children's hospital, [[United Way]], and [[Arizona State University]].   In December 2009, Clean Air Cab sponsored the Pro Players Classic charity golf tournament. Clean Air Cab actively participated in the [[Valley Metro]]'s  Adopt-A-Station program to maintain cleanliness at light rail stations, promoting the use of environmentally friendly transportation choices.

==Affiliations==
Clean Air Cab was a member of both the Phoenix Green Chamber of Commerce and the  Greater Phoenix Gay &amp; Lesbian Chamber of Commerce. It was also a member of  Valley Forward, a Phoenix-based [[non-profit organization]] focusing on environmental protection and sustainability.  In February 2013 Clean air Cab joined One Community  and signed the Unity Pledge decreeing equality for all individuals regardless of orientation in the work place.

=== Strontium ===
[[Strontium-90]] is a commonly used [[Beta particle|beta]] emitter used in industrial sources. It decays to [[Yttrium-90]], which is itself a beta emitter. It is also used as a thermal power source in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]] power packs. These use heat produced by radioactive decay of strontium-90 to generate heat, which can be converted to electricity using a thermocouple. Strontium-90 has a shorter half-life, produces less power, and requires more shielding than [[Plutonium-238]], but is cheaper as it is a fission product and is present in a high concentration in [[nuclear waste]] and can be relatively easily chemically extracted. Strontium-90 based RTGs have been used to power remote [[lighthouses]]. &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.atomicinsights.com/sep96/materials.html]&lt;/sup&gt;

[[Strontium-89]] is a short lived beta emitter which has been used as a treatment for [[bone tumor]]s, this is used in [[palliative care]] in terminal [[cancer]] cases. Both strontium-89 and strontium-90 are [[fission product]]s.

== Neutron activation products ==

=== Tritium ===

[[Tritium]] is a low-energy beta emitter commonly used as a [[radiotracer]] in research and in [[traser]] [[self-powered lighting]]s. The half-life of tritium is 12.3 years. The [[electron]]s from [[beta particle|beta]] emission from tritium are so low in energy (average decay energy 5.7 keV)  that a [[Geiger counter]] cannot be used to detect them. An advantage of the low energy of the decay is that it is easy to shield, since the low energy electrons penetrate only to shallow depths, reducing the safety issues in deal with the isotope. Note that one of the first-aid treatments for the intake of tritium (as [[tritiated water]]) in a human is to give the human plenty of water to drink. This means that the tritated water will be mixed with normal water and will therefore be flushed out by the body more rapidly.

Tritium can also be found in [[metal work]] in the form of a tritiated [[rust]], this can be treated by heating the [[steel]] in a [[furnace]] to drive off the tritium-containing water.

Tritium can be made by the [[neutron irradiation]] of [[lithium]].

=== Carbon ===
[[Carbon-14]] is also commonly used as a beta source in research, it is commonly used as a [[radiotracer]] in organic compounds. While the energy of the beta particles is higher than those of tritium they are still quite low in energy. For instance the walls of a glass bottle are able to absorb it. Carbon-14 is made by the [[np reaction]] of [[nitrogen]]-14 with neutrons. It is generated in the atmosphere by the action of [[cosmic rays]] on nitrogen. Also a large amount was generated by the neutrons from the [[air burst]]s during [[nuclear weapons testing]] conducted in the 20th century. The [[specific activity]] of atmospheric carbon increased as a result of the [[nuclear testing]] but due to the exchange of carbon between the air and other parts of the [[carbon cycle]] it has now returned to a very low value. For small amounts of carbon-14 one of the favoured [[Waste management|disposal]] methods is to burn the waste in a medical [[incinerator]], the idea is that by dispersing the radioactivity over a very wide area the threat to any one human is very small.

===Phosphorus===
[[Phosphorus-32]] is a short-lived high energy beta emitter, which is used in research in radiotracers. It has a half-life of 14 days.  It can be used in [[DNA]] [[research]]. [[Phosphorus]]-32 can be made by the neutron irradiation ([[np reaction]]) of [[sulfur]]-32 or from [[Phosphorus]]-31 by [[neutron capture]].

===Nickel===
[[Nickel-63]] is a special isotope of nickel that can be used as an energy source in [[radioisotope piezoelectric generator|Radioisotope Piezoelectric Generators]]. It has a half-life of 100.1 years. It can be created by irradiating [[Nickel-62]] with neutrons in a nuclear reactor.&lt;sup&gt;[http://isotope.info/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/possible-way-to-industrial-production-of-nickel-63-and-the-prospects-of-its-use.pdf]&lt;/sup&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1830">The '''Cowardin classification system''' is a system for [[Wetland classification|classifying wetlands]], devised by Lewis M. Cowardin ''et al.'' in 1979 for the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]].  The system includes five main types of [[wetland]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s:
# Marine wetlands- which are areas exposed to the open [[ocean]]
# Estuarine wetlands- partially enclosed by land and also exposed to a mixture of fresh and salt water bodies of water
# [[Riverine]] wetlands- associated with flowing water
# [[Lacustrine]] wetlands- associated with a [[lake]] or other body of fresh water
# [[Palustrine]] wetlands- freshwater wetlands not associated with a river or lake.
The primary purpose of this ecological classification system was to establish consistent terms and definitions used in inventory of wetlands and to provide standard measurements for mapping these lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cowardin|first=Lewis M.|last2=Golet|first2=Francis C.|date=1995-06-01|title=US Fish and Wildlife Service 1979 wetland classification: A review|journal=Vegetatio|language=en|volume=118|issue=1–2|pages=139–152|doi=10.1007/BF00045196|issn=0042-3106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eastern Guinean forests''' are a [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]] [[ecoregion]] of [[West Africa]]. The ecoregion includes the lowland forests extending from the [[Gulf of Guinea]] a few hundred kilometers inland, from western [[Côte d'Ivoire]] to the western shore of [[Lake Volta]] in [[Ghana]]. A few small enclaves lie further east and inland in [[Togo]] and [[Benin]]. The [[Sassandra River]] of Côte d'Ivoire separates the Eastern Guinean forests from the [[Western Guinean forests]] which lie to the west. Inland and to the east, the Eastern Guinean forests transition to the [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]].

The Eastern Guinean forests, together with the other tropical moist broadleaf forests of West Africa, is included within [[Conservation International]]'s [[Guinean Forests of West Africa]] [[biodiversity hotspot]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2960">{{refimprove|date=March 2018}}'''Energy in [[Benin]]''' is derived from multiple sources, including, oil and natural gas.

==Oil==
Production from the Sémé off shore oil field began in October 1982, operated by [[Saga Petroleum]], a [[Norway|Norwegian]] company working under a service contract. The field yielded {{convert|1.35|Moilbbl|m3}} of oil in 1991. In 1990, [[Benin]] exported an estimated {{convert|1.27|Moilbbl|m3}} of [[crude oil]]. In 1986, the contract was transferred to Pan Ocean Oil (Panoco), a [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-based US company, but loans to Benin from international development agencies were frozen because the company could not furnish satisfactory financial and capability statements; it withdrew, forcing Benin to take over production. [[Oil reserves|Reserves]], estimated at {{convert|44|Moilbbl|m3}}, were considered sufficient to meet domestic needs. However, Benin has no [[Oil refinery|refinery]]; consequently, refined [[petroleum]] products have to be re-imported. In 2002, imports of refined petroleum products amounted to {{convert|12600|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}. The company responsible for petroleum imports is [[Société Nationale de Commercialisation des Produits Pétroliers]] (SONACOP).

Benin ceased [[petroleum]] production from its Seme oilfield in 1998. America's [[Kosmos Energy|Kosmos Energy LLC]] explored for petroleum in 2006.&lt;ref name=usgs&gt;Omayra Bermúdez-Lugo. [http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/country/2006/myb3-2006-bn-uv-tp.pdf "The Mineral Industry of Benin, Burkina Faso, and Sao Tome e Principe"]. ''2006 [[Minerals Yearbook]]''. [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (October 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this U.S. government source, which is in the [[public domain]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural gas==
Although Benin has natural gas reserves, natural gas production is not active. The company responsible for gas imports is [[Société Beninoise de Gaz]]. Natural gas is supplied to Benin by the [[West African Gas Pipeline]].

==Electricity==

[[Electricity generation|Electrical generating]] capacity in 2002, totaled 122&amp;nbsp;MW. Total domestic power output in that same year was 55&amp;nbsp;GWh, of which [[Hydroelectricity|hydropower]] accounted for 2&amp;nbsp;GWh and fossil fuels for the rest. Electricity consumption in 2002 was 488&amp;nbsp;GWh. An agreement was signed with [[Togo]] and [[Ghana]] in 1967 under which Benin receives low-cost electric power from [[Akosombo Dam]] on the [[Volta River]] in Ghana. Total electricity imports for 2002 were estimated at 437&amp;nbsp;GWh. Togo and Benin are constructing a dam on the [[Mono River]], along the Togo border, that will feed a [[power station]] to supply the southern regions of both countries. Benin also imports electricity from Nigeria through the [[CEB-NEPA Power Interconnection]], commissioned in 2007.

In order to create ethanol, all [[biomass]] needs to go through some of these steps: it needs to be grown, collected, dried, fermented, and burned. All of these steps require resources and an infrastructure. The ratio of the energy released by burning the resulting [[ethanol fuel]] to the energy used in the process, is known as the '''ethanol fuel energy balance''' (sometimes called "[[Net energy gain]]") and studied as part of the wider field of [[energy economics]]. Figures compiled in a 2007 [[National Geographic Magazine]] article &lt;ref name=bourne/&gt; point to modest results for corn ethanol produced in the US: 1 unit of energy input equals 1.3 energy units of corn ethanol energy. The [[Energy returned on energy invested|energy balance]] for sugarcane ethanol produced in Brazil is much more favorable, 1 to 8. Over the years, however, many reports have been produced with contradicting energy balance estimates. A 2006 University of California Berkeley study, after analyzing six separate studies, concluded that producing ethanol from corn uses marginally less petroleum than producing gasoline.&lt;ref name="UCB"&gt;Sanders, Robert (January 26, 2006).[http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2006/01/26_ethanol.shtml Ethanol can replace gasoline with significant energy savings, comparable impact on greenhouse gases]. ''University of California Berkeley'' Energy Resources Group, Dan Kammen and Alex Farrell; Michael O'Hare, Goldman School of Public Policy. Also published 27 JANUARY 2006 VOL 311 Science, www.sciencemag.org .Retrieved August 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy balance reports==
In 1995 the [[USDA]] released a report stating that the net energy balance of corn ethanol in the United States was an average of 1.24. It was previously considered to have a negative net energy balance. However, due to increases in corn crop yield and more efficient farming practices corn ethanol had gained energy efficiency &lt;ref&gt;''Estimating the Net Energy Balance of Corn Ethanol'' Hosein Shapouri, James A. Duffield, and Michael S. Graboski  Agricultural Economics Report No. (AER721) 24 pp, July '''1995''' http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/926108/aer721.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ken Cassman]], a professor of agronomy at the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]], said in 2008 that ethanol has a substantial net positive direct energy balance—1.5 to 1.6 more units of energy are derived from ethanol than are used to produce it. Comparing 2008 to 2003, Alan Tiemann of Seward, a Nebraska Corn Board member, said that ethanol plants produce 15 percent more ethanol from a bushel of corn and use about 20 percent less energy in the process. At the same time, corn growers are more efficient, producing more corn per acre and using less energy to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theindependent.com/unl-study-ethanol-energy-efficiency-growing/article_3105d9c5-9806-5bb7-83f9-3eac22e3fceb.html UNL study: Ethanol energy efficiency growing] - 29. September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of corn ethanol production in the U.S. often quote the 2005 paper &lt;ref&gt;''Ethanol Production Using Corn, Switchgrass, and Wood; Biodiesel Production Using Soybean and Sunflower'' David Pimentel and Tad W. Patzek Natural Resources Research, Vol. 14, No. 1, March '''2005''' {{DOI|10.1007/s11053-005-4679-8}} {{cite web|url=http://petroleum.berkeley.edu/papers/Biofuels/NRRethanol.2005.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 17, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809024158/http://petroleum.berkeley.edu/papers/Biofuels/NRRethanol.2005.pdf |archivedate=August 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[David Pimentel]], a retired Entomologist, and [[Tad Patzek|Tadeusz Patzek]], a Geological Engineer from UC Berkeley. Both have been exceptionally critical of ethanol and other biofuels. Their studies contend that ethanol, and biofuels in general, are "energy negative", meaning they take more energy to produce than is contained in the final product.

A 2006 article &lt;ref&gt;''Ethanol Can Contribute to Energy and Environmental Goals'' Alexander E. Farrell, Richard J. Plevin, Brian T. Turner, Andrew D. Jones, Michael O’Hare, [[Daniel M. Kammen]] 506 27 January 2006 vol 311 Science http://rael.berkeley.edu/ebamm/FarrellEthanolScience012706.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Science (journal)|Science]] offers the consensus opinion that current corn ethanol technologies had similar greenhouse gas emissions to gasoline, but was much less petroleum-intensive than gasoline. Fossil fuels also require significant energy inputs which have seldom been accounted for in the past.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Ethanol is not the only product created during production. By-products also have energy content. Corn is typically 66% starch and the remaining 33% is not fermented. This unfermented component is called distillers grain, which is high in fats and proteins, and makes a good animal feed supplement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ddgs.umn.edu/more.htm University of Minnesota&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Dr. Michael Wang, of [[Argonne National Laboratory]], wrote that these ethanol by-products are the most contentious issue in evaluating the energy balance of ethanol.  He wrote that Pimentel assumes that corn ethanol entirely replaces gasoline and so the quantity of by-products is too large for the market to absorb, and they become waste.  At lower quantities of production, Wang finds it appropriate to credit corn ethanol based on the input energy requirement of the feed product or good that the ethanol by-product displaces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/TA/267.pdf Corn-Based Ethanol Does Indeed Achieve Energy Benefits]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, a USDA report found that co-products accounting made the difference between energy ratios of 1.06 and 1.67.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethanol-gec.org/netenergy/NEYShapouri.htm The 2001 Net Energy Balance of Corn-Ethanol]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/AF/265.pdf The Energy Balance of Corn Ethanol: An Update]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, MIT researcher Tiffany Groode came to similar conclusions about the co-product issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lfee.mit.edu/public/Groode_Current%20Corn%20Ethanol%20Results_June%202006.pdf Review of Corn Based Ethanol Energy Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil where sugar cane is used, the yield is higher, and conversion to ethanol is more energy efficient than corn. Recent developments with [[cellulosic ethanol]] production may improve yields even further.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5353118.stm Biofuels look to the next generation&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 a study from the [[University of Minnesota]] found that corn-grain ethanol produced 1.25 units of energy per unit put in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Jason | last = Hill |author2=Nelson, Erik |author3=Tilman, David |author4=Polasky, Stephen |author5=Tiffany, Douglas | date = July 25, 2006 | title = Environmental, economic, and energetic costs and benefits of biodiesel and ethanol biofuels | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 103 | issue = 30 | pages = 11206–10 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0604600103 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/103/30/11206 | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | pmid = 16837571 | pmc = 1544066 | bibcode=2006PNAS..10311206H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 study by the [[University of Nebraska]] found a 5.4 energy balance for ethanol derived specifically from [[switchgrass]].&lt;ref&gt;''Grass biofuels 'cut CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by 94%''' Reprted on bbc.co.uk http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7175397.stm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. R. Schmer, K. P. Vogel, R. B. Mitchell, and R. K. Perrin ''Net energy of cellulosic ethanol from switchgrass'' PNAS published January 7, '''2008''', {{DOI|10.1073/pnas.0704767105}}&lt;/ref&gt; This estimate is better than in previous studies and according to the authors partly due to the larger size of the field trial (3-9 [[Hectare|ha]]) on 10 farms.

==Variables==
According to [[United States Department of Energy|DoE]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/biomass/net_energy_balance.html DoE: Biomass Program: Net Energy Balance for Bioethanol Production and Use] Quote: "...The most official study of the issue, which also reviews other studies, concludes that the "net energy balance" of making fuel ethanol from corn grain is 1.34...For [[Cellulose|cellulosic]] bioethanol—the focus of the Biomass Program—that study projects an energy balance of 2.62...A Biomass Program life-cycle analysis of producing ethanol from stover, now underway, is expected to show a very impressive net energy ratio of more than 5..."&lt;/ref&gt; to evaluate the net energy of ethanol four variables must be considered:
# the amount of energy contained in the final ethanol product
# the amount of energy directly consumed to make the ethanol (such as the diesel used in [[tractors]])
# the quality of the resulting ethanol compared to the quality of refined gasoline
# the energy indirectly consumed (in order to make the ethanol processing plant, etc.).

Much of the current academic discussion regarding ethanol currently revolves around issues of system borders.  This refers to how complete of a picture is drawn for energy inputs.  There is debate on whether to include items like the energy required to feed the people tending and processing the corn, to erect and repair farm fences, even the amount of energy a tractor represents.

In addition, there is no consensus on what sort of value to give the rest of the corn (such as the stalk), commonly known as the 'coproduct.'  Some studies leave it on the field to protect the soil from erosion and to add organic matter, while others take and burn the coproduct to power the ethanol plant, but do not address the resulting soil erosion (which would require energy in the form of fertilizer to replace).  Depending on the ethanol study you read, net energy returns vary from .7-1.5 units of ethanol per unit of fossil fuel energy consumed.  For comparison, that same one unit of fossil fuel invested in oil and gas extraction (in the lower 48 States) will yield 15 units of gasoline, a yield an order of magnitude better than current ethanol production technologies, ignoring the energy quality arguments above and the fact that the gain (14 units) is both declining and not carbon neutral.&lt;ref&gt;''Net Energy From the Extraction of Oil and Gas in the United States'' Cutler J. Cleveland http://www.bu.edu/cees/people/faculty/cutler/articles/Net_%20Energy_US_Oil_gas.pdf (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

In this regard, [[geography]] is the decisive factor. In tropical regions with abundant water and land resources, such as [[Brazil]] and [[Colombia]], the viability of production of ethanol from [[sugarcane]] is no longer in question; in fact, the burning of sugarcane residues ([[bagasse]]) generates far more energy than needed to operate the ethanol plants, and many of them are now selling electric energy to the utilities. However, while there may be a positive net energy return at the moment, recent research suggests that the sugarcane plantations are not sustainable in the long run, as they are depleting the soil of nutrients and carbon matter {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}  On the other hand, productivity of sugar cane per land area in Brazil has consistently grown over the decades; sugar cane has been shown to be less depleting to the soil than cattle and yearly cultures;&lt;ref&gt;''Em direção à sustentabilidade da produção de etanol de cana de açúcar no Brasil'' Délcio Rodrigues e Lúcia Ortiz http://www.vitaecivilis.org.br/anexos/etanol_sustentabilidade.pdf (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; and there are many regions in the country where sugar cane has been cultivated for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Rex A. Hudson, ed. Brazil: A Country Study. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1997. http://countrystudies.us/brazil/57.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Those facts suggest that related soil depletion processes are very slow and therefore ethanol from sugar cane may be far more sustainable in the long run than common fossil fuel alternatives. Besides, since the energy surplus is high in the case of sugar cane ethanol, conceivably part of that energy can be used to synthesize fertilizers and replenish soil depletion a long time, therefore making the process indefinitely sustainable.

The picture is different for other regions, such as most of the [[United States]], where the climate is too cool for sugarcane. In the U.S., agricultural ethanol is generally obtained from [[cereal|grain]], chiefly [[maize|corn]]. But it can also be obtained from [[cellulosic ethanol|cellulose]], a more energy balanced bioethanol.

== Clean production bioethanol ==
Clean production bioethanol &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ineosbio.com/91-Sustainability.htm INEOS Bio: Bioethanol: Sustainability] Quote: "An independent life cycle assessment carried out by Eunomia on the production of INEOS Bio Ethanol from waste biomass indicates that greenhouse gas savings of more than 90% vs. gasoline could be achieved...  This saving is significantly higher than the best performing bioethanol today, which is sugar cane ethanol made in Brazil, (reported to deliver up to 70% greenhouse gas savings)." date=July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; is a biofuel obtained by maximizing non-[[greenhouse gas]] emitting (renewable) resources: 
* energy directly consumed to make the ethanol is [[renewable energy]].  The farm equipment and ethanol plant use an [[ethanol engine]], [[biodiesel]], [[air engine]] or electricity cogenerated during ethanol production, or even [[wind power]] and [[solar energy]].
* energy indirectly consumed is, as much as possible, renewable. Examples would be reducing either the amount or fossil carbon content of applied pest control chemicals and fertilizers, or accomplishing deliveries of farm inputs or of finished bioethanol fuel to market that minimize the use of fossil fuels.  Optimally located biomass and ethanol production must balance many factors:  minimizing distances to and from markets, effectively collecting and employing biomass wastes, maximizing crop yields based on enduring soil quality, available natural pest control and adequate sun and water, and optimizing a sufficient mix and rotation of plant species on cultivated, fallow and preserved land for human, animal and energy consumption.
Using ethanol returns carbon to the atmosphere whereas burning gasoline adds carbon to the atmosphere.  Thus the effects of gasoline burning increase over time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2562">{{Thermoelectric effect|cTopic=Principles}}
The '''Ettingshausen Effect''' (named for [[Albert von Ettingshausen]]) is a [[thermoelectric effect|thermoelectric]] (or thermomagnetic) phenomenon that affects the [[electric current]] in a conductor when a [[magnetic field]] is present.&lt;ref name=ettinghausen86&gt;{{cite journal|last=v. Ettingshausen|first=A.|author2=Nernst, W.|title=Ueber das Auftreten electromotorischer Kräfte in Metallplatten, welche von einem Wärmestrome durchflossen werden und sich im magnetischen Felde befinden|journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie|year=1886|volume=265|issue=10|pages=343–347|doi=10.1002/andp.18862651010|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/andp.18862651010|accessdate=23 February 2012|bibcode = 1886AnP...265..343E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ettingshausen and his PhD student [[Walther Nernst]] were studying the [[Hall effect]] in [[bismuth]], and noticed an unexpected perpendicular current flow when one side of the sample was heated. This is also known as the [[Nernst effect]]. Conversely, when applying a current (along the y-axis) and a perpendicular magnetic field (along the z-axis) a temperature gradient appears along the x-axis. Because of the Hall effect, electrons are forced to move perpendicular to the applied current. Due to the accumulation of electrons on one side of the sample, the number of collisions increases and a heating of the material occurs.
This effect is quantified by the Ettingshausen coefficient ''P'', which is defined as:

::&lt;math&gt;P=\frac{dT/dx}{|B_z|\cdot J_y}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''dT/dx'' is the temperature gradient that results from the ''y''-component ''J&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' of an electric current density and the ''z''-component ''B&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' of a magnetic field.

[[File:Sketch of Ettingshausen effect.svg|thumb|temperature gradient due to Ettingshausen effect with applied magnetic field and electric current]]

In most metals like [[copper]], [[silver]] and [[gold]] ''P'' is on the order of {{val|e=-16|u=Km/(TA)}} and thus difficult to observe in common magnetic fields. In [[bismuth]]  the Ettingshausen coefficient is several orders of magnitude larger because of its poor [[thermal conductivity]].

::&lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{bismuth}}=7.5\pm0.3\times 10^{-4}\frac{K\cdot m}{T\cdot A}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=tbmtfb2002&gt;{{cite web|title=ettingshausen effect in bismuth|url=http://www.bubek.org/physics/pp_stuff/ettinghauseneffekt.pdf|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Evolution (2001 film)}}
[[File:PBS Evolution.jpg|frame|Series logo]]
'''''Evolution''''' is a 2001 [[Documentary film|documentary]] [[television program|series]] by the [[United States|American]] broadcaster [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) and [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] on [[evolutionary biology]], from the producers of ''[[Nova_(TV_series)|NOVA]]''.
==Overview==
The spokespeople for the series were [[Jane Goodall]] (overall spokesperson), [[Kenneth R. Miller]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]] (science spokespeople), [[Eugenie C. Scott]] (education spokesperson), [[Arthur Peacocke]] and [[Arnold Thomas]] (religious spokespeople).  The series was narrated by the Irish actor [[Liam Neeson]].

The series was accompanied by a book by the popular science writer [[Carl Zimmer]] ''[[Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl|last=Zimmer|authorlink=Carl Zimmer|title=[[Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea]]|isbn=0-06-019906-7|year=2001|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An extensive website provides teaching resources for each episode's material, including "The Mating Game", further looks at [[Charles Darwin]], and an interactive history of [[speciation]] in the invented "pollencreeper" birds.

The episode "What about God?" features discussion of the issues of [[evolution]] and [[creationism]] at [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]], an [[evangelicalism|Evangelical]] [[Protestant]] college that teaches [[evolution]] but has in the past restricted professors from taking a stance on the literal versus the allegorical interpretations of Adam and Eve in the Genesis account of creation.

==Reception==
TV critic [[Julie Salamon]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', said that "[a] powerful sense of drama, discovery and intellectual enthusiasm runs through this rich eight-hour series ... The series covers an enormous amount of ground but doesn't leave you feeling swamped."&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07EFDA173AF937A1575AC0A9679C8B63 A Stark Explanation for Mankind From an Unlikely Rebel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Being made and broadcast in the country where [[creation-evolution controversy]] is strongest, the last episode ''What About God?'' focused on [[religion]], and "through personal stories of students and teachers, it offers [[theistic evolution|the view that they are compatible]]".  Phina Borgeson, Faith Network Director of the [[National Center for Science Education]], provided a Congregational Study Guide for Evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncseweb.org/article.asp?category=11 Congregational Study Guide for Evolution] from the [[National Center for Science Education]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, the [[Discovery Institute]]'s [[Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture]] produced a website to refute the documentary and started a petition it called [[A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism]] to show that there were "scientists that dispute the claims".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reviewevolution.com/ A Critique of PBS's Evolution], [[Discovery Institute]]'s [[Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5525">A '''Fessenden oscillator''' is an electro-acoustic [[transducer]] invented by [[Reginald Fessenden]], with development starting in 1912 at the [[Raytheon|Submarine Signal Company]] of Boston.&lt;ref&gt;http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/tech/summary/v042/42.3frost01.html Summary of Frost 2001&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first successful [[Sonar#History|acoustical echo ranging]] device. Similar in operating principle to a dynamic [[voice coil]] [[Speaker driver|loudspeaker]], it was an early kind of transducer, capable of [[Sonar#Active_sonar|creating underwater sounds]] and of [[hydrophone|picking up their echoes]].

The creation of this device was motivated by the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] disaster of 1912, which highlighted the need to protect ships from collisions with icebergs,  obstacles, and other ships. Because of its relatively low operating frequency, it has been replaced in modern transducers by [[piezoelectric]] devices.

==Oscillator==
The ''oscillator'' in the name referred to the fact that the device vibrated and moved water in response to a driving [[Alternating current|AC]] current. It was not an electronic [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]] but a mechanical one in that it generated  repetitive mechanical vibrations. Electronic oscillators did not yet exist when this device was created. Because the design of the device does not depend on a resonant response, it should not be considered an [[harmonic oscillator]].

==Operation==
The Fessenden oscillator somewhat resembled a modern dynamic microphone or dynamic loudspeaker in overall construction.  A circular metal plate, clamped at its edge, in contact with the water on one side, was attached on the other side to a copper tube, which was free to move in the circular gap of a magnet system. The magnet system had a direct-current winding to provide a polarizing magnetic field in the gap, and an alternating current winding that induced currents in the copper tube. These induced currents produced a magnetic field that reacted against the polarizing field. The resulting force was communicated to the membrane and in turn provided acoustic vibrations into the water. 

Unlike previous underwater sound sources such as underwater bells, the Fessenden oscillator was reversible; the AC winding could be connected to a head set and underwater sounds and echoes could be heard.  Using this device Fessenden was able to detect icebergs at a distance of about 2 miles, and occasionally detected echoes from the sea floor.&lt;ref name=Wille2005&gt;Peter C. Wille ''Sound images of the ocean in research and monitoring, Volume 1 '' Springer, 2005 {{ISBN|3-540-24122-1}} page 16&lt;/ref&gt; 

The device could also be used as an underwater telegraph, sending [[Morse code]] through the water. The ''Fessenden underwater signalling apparatus'', or more usually just "The Fessenden", was fitted to [[Royal Navy]] submarines in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
British K-series submarines were equipped with Fessenden oscillators starting in 1915. However, a submarine signalling the surface could be heard by any nearby (enemy) hydrophone, so the system had restricted utility during wartime patrols.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Akermann ''Encyclopedia of British Submarines 1901-1955'', Periscope Publishing Ltd., 2002 {{ISBN|1-904381-05-7}}, page 46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
During the [[First World War]] the Fessenden oscillator was applied to detection of [[submarine]]s, but its rather low operating frequency of around 1 kilohertz gave it a very broad beam, unsuitable for detecting and localising small targets. In peacetime, the oscillator was used for depth finding, where the lack of directionality was not a concern, and Fessenden designed a commercial [[fathometer]] using a [[carbon microphone]] as receiver, for the Submarine Signal Company.&lt;ref name=Ainslie2010&gt;Michael A. Ainslie ''Principles of Sonar Performance Modelling'', Springer, 2010 {{ISBN|3-540-87661-8}},  pages 10, 11, 15, 16&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3176">'''Final cover''' is a multilayered system of various materials which are primarily used to reduce the amount of [[storm water]] that will enter a [[landfill]] after closing.  Proper final cover systems will also minimize the [[surface water]] on the liner system, resist [[erosion]] due to wind or runoff, control the migrations of [[landfill gases]], and improve aesthetics.&lt;ref name="sharma"&gt;Sharma, Hari and Reddy, Krishna. 2004. Geoenvironmental Engineering: Site Remediation, Waste Containment, and Emerging Waste Management Technologies. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., Hoboken, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

A final cover system can include a top soil layer composed of nutrient rich soil, a protective layer to reduce the effects of freeze/thaw, a drainage layer which moves storm water, a barrier layer, and a grading layer.

== Cover integrity ==
For a final cover system consisting of a geomembrane, an analysis of the mechanical properties of the [[geomembrane]] should be conducted to ensure cover integrity is not jeopardized by localized subsidence, bending, and cover slope stability.

=== Localized subsidence ===
Localized subsidence induces tensile stresses in [[geomembranes]], which can threaten the final cover integrity. The magnitudes of the tensile stress can be viewed as a function of the dimensions of the subsidence zone and the properties of the cover soil. Allowable tensile stress of a geomembrane is usually known; in order to ensure the stability of final cover, the tensile stress allowable by a geomembrane should exceed the calculated value for tensile stress induced by waste.&lt;ref name="koerner"&gt;Koerner, R. M. 1993. Geotechnical practice for waste disposal. Array London: Chapman &amp; Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geomembrane bending ===
Geomembrane bending, both from its self-weight and soil cover may also induce tensile stress.  Tensile stress from bending should not exceed the allowable tensile stress of the geomembrane.&lt;ref name="koerner"/&gt;

=== Cover slope stability ===
Cover slope stability analysis involves evaluation of the interface strengths under static and seismic conditions.  In order to perform an evaluation of the effects of a final cover system placed on a refuse side slope, slope stability analyses are required. A slope stability analysis assumes that the driving forces causing movement are due to the weight of the materials and the forces governing resistance are due to material strength. Most engineers design the permanent slope to have a minimum Factor of Safety of 1.5 at the designed inclination (typically 3H:1V) for static loading. Steepening of a slope past the design inclination increases the driving forces thus decreasing the Factor of Safety. Decreasing the Factor of Safety past 1.0 could possibly push the final cover system components beyond their limits of stability.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, DE, RM Koerner, R Bonaparte, RE Landreth, DA Carson, and HB Scranton. 1998. Slope Stability of Geosynthetic Clay Liner Test Plots. Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering. 124, no. 7: 628-637.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francis Murray Patrick "Frank" McMahon''' (2 October 1902 - 20 May 1986) was a [[Canadian]] oilman best known as the founder and first chairman of [[Westcoast Transmission Co. Ltd.]] whom the July 15, 1957 issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine called "The man who did the most to open up northwest Canada's wilderness—and convince oilmen of its treasures."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809686-2,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, McMahon was a major [[horse racing|racehorse]] owner/breeder whose [[Thoroughbred]]s competed in [[North America]] and [[Europe]] and who won the 1969 [[Kentucky Derby]] and [[Preakness Stakes]] with the [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|U.S. Racing Hall of Fame]] colt, [[Majestic Prince]].

==Biography==

=== Early life and career ===

Frank McMahon was born in the village of [[Moyie, British Columbia|Moyie]] in the [[Kootenays|East Kootenays]] of [[British Columbia]], Canada, the son of a hard-rock miner.

He attended [[Gonzaga University]] in [[Spokane]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], where he was a campus mate of [[Bing Crosby]]. As a young man, he worked as a driller for British Columbia mining companies until 1927 when he founded his own diamond-drilling contracting business which he expanded into drilling for [[oil]] and [[natural gas]].

=== West Turner Petroleums ===

Frank McMahon and two brothers established West Turner Petroleums to explore and develop oil deposits in the [[Turner Valley, Alberta|Turner Valley Oilfields]] in [[Alberta]]. Their major find generated sufficient revenues and income to allow for expansion through acquisitions and exploration. He later merged two smaller companies with West Turner and formed a holding company, Pacific Petroleums Ltd.

In 1945 McMahon founded Atlantic Oil Company and acquired rights to a part of the Leduc field, near [[Leduc, Alberta]]. After Imperial Oil's discovery of oil at Leduc in 1947, the Atlantic No. 3 well discovered oil on March 8, 1948. It was well-publicized due to the oil blowout that took six months to contain and a well fire that started in the week prior to the well being contained. The well propelled McMahon's wealth. Pacific's headquarters were set up in [[Calgary]], Alberta.

In December 1947, McMahon's operations began oil and gas exploration in the [[Peace River Regional District, British Columbia|Peace River Region]] after the B.C. government opened the area to exploration.

In November 1951, Pacific's Fort St. John No. 1 well found significant quantities of good quality oil, B.C.'s first oil discovery. In 1952 the company drilled the first of many high-producing gas wells at [[Fort St. John, British Columbia|Fort St. John]].

In about 1961 McMahon and his brother George sold their controlling interest in Pacific Petroleums to [[Phillips Petroleum Company]]. In 1977 Pacific Petroleums was purchased by [[Petro-Canada]].

=== Westcoast Transmission ===

McMahon saw an enormous opportunity to supply natural gas to the huge United States market. In 1949 he incorporated Westcoast Transmission Co. Ltd. whose business plan included the construction of a 650-mile gas pipeline from [[Taylor, British Columbia|Taylor]] in north-eastern British Columbia to the United States.

McMahon personally began [[lobbying]] the Canadian and American governments to remove their restrictions on the export and import of natural gas. In December 1954, he signed a $400-million contract with Pacific Northwest Pipeline Corp. to sell natural gas into their pipeline system in the United States. In 1955 Westcoast was awarded permission from the U.S. Federal Power Commission to export gas. Construction started the same year on the $170-million, 650-mile [[Westcoast Pipeline]] from the Peace River area to the U.S. border, to hook into the Pacific Northwest Pipeline Corp.'s six-state gas grid and to supply gas to Vancouver. The pipeline was Canada's first "[[Big Inch|big-inch]]" pipeline. Along with its gathering system, the processing plants and compressor stations were completed in the fall of 1957.

In 1964, Westcoast Transmission built another processing plant at [[Fort Nelson, British Columbia]], in support of an additional 250-mile line to the company's new discoveries in the Canadian Northwest.

After McMahon's death in 1986, Westcoast Transmission Co. Ltd. was renamed Westcoast Energy Inc. and in 2002 [[Duke Energy]] of [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], paid $8 billion for the company.

=== Other business ventures ===

In the 1950s McMahon had an interest in Alberta Distillers Ltd. In October 1957, Time Magazine estimated his worth at $50-million and that he controlled assets in partnership with others that totalled about $500-million.

Frank McMahon's significant contribution to Canada's economic prosperity was recognized by his election to the [[Canadian Business Hall of Fame]].

In the 1950s Frank McMahon backed a number of Broadway plays in New York, including [[The Pajama Game]] and [[Damn Yankees]].

=== Horse racing ===

Frank McMahon, a founding member of the [[Jockey Club of Canada]], raced thoroughbreds on his own as well as in partnership with others.

His Frank McMahon Stable Inc. won numerous races at racetracks across Canada including the 1966 [[British Columbia Derby]] at [[Hastings Racecourse|Exhibition Park Racetrack]] in Vancouver and the 1970 [[Canadian Derby]] at [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton's]] [[Northlands Park]]. His most famous horse was Majestic Prince.

Frank McMahon was inducted in the British Columbia Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 1995 in the breeders/owners category.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bchorseracinghalloffame.org/mcmahon_frank.htm [Retrieved: 31 October 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

He set up a racing stable in [[California]] with U.S. Racing Hall of Fame jockey-turned-trainer [[Johnny Longden]]. Among the horses they raced was the great [[Majestic Prince]] whose important [[graded stakes race|stakes]] include the 1969 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. Majestic Prince was inducted into the [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame]] in 1988 and was listed at No. 46. in [[The Blood-Horse magazine]] ranking of the [[Blood-Horse magazine List of Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century|top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century]]. In 1975, McMahon had another Triple Crown contender with [[Diabolo (horse)|Diabolo]] who finished third in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, and was fourth in the Belmont Stakes.

In the 1950s he was part owner of [[Alberta Ranches, Ltd.]] which won the 1953 [[Hollywood Gold Cup]] with Royal Serenade.

Together with [[Calgary]] newspaper publisher [[Max Bell]], Frank McMahon founded the [[Golden West Farms]] thoroughbred breeding operation at [[Okotoks]], [[Alberta]]. Among its notable wins, Golden West Farms' racing stable won the 1968 [[Queen's Plate]] with [[Merger (horse)|Merger]]. In partnership with American singer, [[Bing Crosby]], McMahon and Bell owned [[Meadow Court]] who raced in Europe where he won the 1965 [[Irish Derby]] and the [[King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes]].

McMahon also teamed up with [[Kentucky]] horseman [[Leslie Combs II]] of [[Spendthrift Farm]] to breed [[Crowned Prince]], a sibling of Majestic Prince, who in 1970 became the first yearling to be sold at auction for half a million dollars. McMahon won the bidding for Crowned Prince and sent him to race in [[England]] where he won the [[Dewhurst Stakes|Dewhurst]] and [[Champagne Stakes (Great Britain)|Champagne Stakes]] and was the 1971 champion two-year-old colt in England. Leslie Combs also bred McMahon's [[Triple Bend]], a colt who set a world record time in winning the 1972 [[Los Angeles Handicap]].

=== McMahon Stadium ===

In 1960 Frank and brother George McMahon donated $300,000 to the then University of Alberta (Calgary), now the [[University of Calgary]], to help build a football stadium. They also guaranteed the $750,000 balance of the $1,050,000 construction cost. It was named [[McMahon Stadium]] in their honour. In 1988, the stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of that year’s winter Olympiad.

The university acquired complete ownership of the stadium and land in 1985 after the guaranteed financing was retired in 1973. The stadium is operated by the McMahon Stadium Society. Until the guaranteed financing was retired the McMahons appointed two of the six members of the society. The first treasurer of the society was the McMahons' accountant, William Macintosh.

In 2001 the McMahon brothers were named to the [[Calgary Stampeders]] Wall of Fame in the builder category.

=== Personal life ===

McMahon's first marriage was to Isabel Grant. The couple had three children: Frank, William and Marion. The marriage ended in divorce.

In 1956, McMahon married Betty Betz (1920-2010). Betz, born in Chicago, attended Sarah Lawrence College where she earned a degree in journalism in 1941. After graduation, she worked for a year for Harper's Bazaar, and then went on to create an advice column for teens, which was syndicated in Hearst newspapers. In 1951 she hosted the television programme ''Going Places with Bettz Betz''. Additionally, she illustrated seven books, including ''Manners for Moppets'', ''The Betty Betz Teen-Age Cookbook,'' and ''The Betty Betz Party Book, the Teen-Age Guide to Social Success''. In 1959 the McMahons moved from Vancouver to Palm Beach. They maintained homes in Acapulco, New York City, Vancouver, and Paget, Bermuda. The couple had two children: Francine and Bettina.

Frank McMahon died in [[Hamilton, Bermuda]] in 1986.

'''Franklinite''' is an [[oxide mineral]] belonging to the normal [[spinel]] subgroup's iron (Fe) series, with the formula ZnFe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.  

As with another spinel member [[magnetite]], both [[ferrous]] (2+) and [[ferric]] (3+) iron  may be present in Franklinite samples. Divalent [[iron]] and/or [[manganese]] (Mn) may commonly accompany [[zinc]] (Zn) and trivalent manganese may substitute for some ferric iron.

At its type locality, Franklinite can be found with a wide array of minerals, many of which are [[fluorescent]]. More commonly, it occurs with [[willemite]], [[calcite]], and red [[zincite]]. In these rocks, it forms as disseminated small black crystals with their octahedral faces visible at times. It may rarely be found as a single large [[euhedral]] crystal.

Franklinite was a minor ore of zinc, manganese, and iron. It is named after its local discovery at the [[Franklin Furnace|Franklin Mine]] and [[Sterling Hill Mine]]s in [[New Jersey]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2998">'''Glass-filled polymer''', or '''glass-filled plastic''', is a mouldable [[composite material]]. It comprises short glass-fibres in a [[Matrix (chemical analysis)|matrix]] of a [[polymer]] material. It is used to manufacture a wide range of structural components by [[injection moulding|injection]] or [[compression moulding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Materials ==
Either [[thermoplastic]] or [[thermosetting]] polymers may be used. One of the most widely used thermoplastics is [[nylon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  |title=Ertalon 66-GF30, glass-filled Nylon 66
  |url=http://www.theplasticshop.co.uk/plastic_technical_data_sheets/glass_filled_nylon_technical_data_sheet.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mouldable composite was [[Bakelite]]. This used [[wood flour]] fibres in [[phenolic resin]] as the [[thermoset polymer matrix]]. As the fibres were only short this material had relatively low bulk strength, but still improved surface hardness and good mouldability.

A wide range of polymers are now produced in glass-filled varieties, including polyamide (Nylon), [[acetal]] [[homopolymer]]s and [[copolymer]]s, [[polyester]], [[Poly(p-phenylene oxide)|polyphenylene oxide]] (PPO / [[Noryl]]), [[polycarbonate]], [[polyethersulphone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  |title=Plastic injection moulding polymers 
  |url=http://www.fern-plastics.co.uk/materials.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bulk moulding compound]] is a pre-mixed material of resin and fibres supplied for moulding. Some are thermoplastic or thermosetting, others are chemically cured and are mixed with a catalyst (polyester) or hardener (epoxy) before moulding.

== Applications ==
Compared to the native polymer, glass-filled materials have improved mechanical properties of [[stiffness|rigidity]], [[shear strength|strength]] and may also have improved [[surface hardness]].

== Compared to sheet materials ==
Bulk glass ''filled'' materials are considered distinct from [[fibreglass]] or [[fibre-reinforced plastic]] materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
  |title=Is It Glass Filled or Glass Reinforced?

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These use a substrate of fabric sheets made from long fibres, draped to shape in a mould and then impregnated with resin. They are usually moulded into shapes made of large but thin sheets.  Filled materials, in contrast, are used for applications that are thicker or of varying section and not usually as large as sheet materials.

In theories of [[quantum gravity]], the '''graviton''' is the hypothetical [[elementary particle]] that mediates the force of [[gravitation|gravity]]. There is no complete [[quantum field theory]] of gravitons due to an outstanding mathematical problem with [[renormalization]] in [[general relativity]]. In [[string theory]], believed to be a consistent theory of quantum gravity, the graviton is a [[Mass in special relativity|massless]] state of a fundamental string.  

If it exists, the graviton is expected to be  [[Mass in special relativity|massless]]  because the gravitational force is very long range and appears to propagate at the speed of light.  The graviton must be a [[spin (physics)|spin]]-2 [[boson]] because the source of gravitation is the [[stress–energy tensor]], a second-order [[tensor]] (compared with [[electromagnetism]]'s spin-1 [[photon]], the source of which is the [[four-current]], a first-order tensor). Additionally, it can be shown that any massless spin-2 field would give rise to a force indistinguishable from gravitation, because a massless spin-2 field would couple to the stress–energy tensor in the same way that gravitational interactions do. This result suggests that, if a massless spin-2 particle is discovered, it must be the graviton.&lt;ref&gt;For a comparison of the geometric derivation and the (non-geometric) spin-2 field derivation of general relativity, refer to box 18.1 (and also 17.2.5) of {{cite book

==Theory==
Apart from gravity, the three other known [[force]]s of nature are thought to be mediated by elementary particles: [[electromagnetism]] by the [[photon]], the [[strong interaction]] by [[gluon]]s, and the [[weak interaction]] by the [[W and Z bosons]].  All three of these forces appear to be accurately described by the [[standard model]] of particle physics.  A hypothesis is that gravitational interactions are mediated by an as yet undiscovered elementary particle, dubbed the ''graviton''. In the [[classical limit]], the theory would reduce to [[general relativity]], which itself reduces to [[Newton's law of gravitation]] in the weak-field limit.&lt;ref&gt;

The term graviton was originally coined in 1934 by Soviet physicists [[Dmitrii Blokhintsev]] and F. Gal'perin.&lt;ref name=Blokhintsev/&gt;

===Gravitons and renormalization===
When describing graviton interactions, the [[classical theory]] of [[Feynman diagram]]s, and semiclassical corrections such as [[one-loop diagram]]s behave normally. However, [[Feynman diagram]]s with at least two loops lead to [[ultraviolet divergence]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} These infinite results cannot be removed because quantized [[general relativity]] is not [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbatively]] [[renormalizable]], unlike [[quantum electrodynamics]] models such as the [[Yang–Mills theory]]. Therefore, incalculable answers are found from the perturbation method by which physicists calculate the probability of a particle to emit or absorb gravitons, and the theory loses predictive veracity. Those problems and the complementary approximation framework are grounds to show that a theory more unified than quantized general relativity is required to describe the behavior near the [[Planck scale]].

===Comparison with other forces===
Like the [[force carrier]]s of the [[fundamental interaction|other forces]] (see [[charged black hole]]), gravitation plays a role in [[general relativity]], in defining the [[spacetime]] in which events take place. [[General relativity#Definition and basic applications|In some descriptions]] energy modifies the "shape" of [[spacetime]] itself, and gravity is a result of this shape, an idea which at first glance may appear hard to match with the idea of a force acting between particles.&lt;ref&gt;See the other articles on [[General relativity]], [[Gravitational field]], [[Gravitational wave]], etc&lt;/ref&gt; Because the [[diffeomorphism]] invariance of the theory does not allow any particular space-time background to be singled out as the "true" space-time background, general relativity is said to be [[background-independent]]. In contrast, the [[Standard Model]] is ''not'' background-independent, with [[Minkowski space]] enjoying a special status as the fixed background space-time.&lt;ref&gt;

===Gravitons in speculative theories===
[[String theory]] predicts the existence of gravitons and their well-defined [[interaction]]s. A graviton in [[perturbative|perturbative string theory]] is a [[closed string]] in a very particular low-energy vibrational state. The scattering of gravitons in string theory can also be computed from the [[correlation function (quantum field theory)|correlation functions]] in [[conformal field theory]], as dictated by the [[AdS/CFT]] correspondence, or from [[Matrix theory (physics)|matrix theory]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

A feature of gravitons in string theory is that, as closed strings without endpoints, they would not be bound to [[Membrane (M-Theory)|branes]] and could move freely between them. If we live on a brane (as hypothesized by [[Membrane (M-theory)|brane theories]]), this "leakage" of gravitons from the brane into higher-dimensional space could explain why gravitation is such a weak force, and gravitons from other branes adjacent to our own could provide a potential explanation for [[dark matter]]. However, if gravitons were to move completely freely between branes, this would dilute gravity too much, causing a violation of Newton's inverse-square law. To combat this, [[Lisa Randall]] found that a three-brane (such as ours) would have a gravitational pull of its own, preventing gravitons from drifting freely, possibly resulting in the diluted gravity we observe, while roughly maintaining Newton's inverse square law.&lt;ref&gt;Kaku, Michio (2006) [[Parallel Worlds (book)|''Parallel Worlds – The science of alternative universes and our future in the Cosmos'']]. Doubleday. pp. 218–221. {{ISBN|978-0385509862}}.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[brane cosmology]].

A theory by Ahmed Farag Ali and Saurya Das adds quantum mechanical corrections (using Bohm trajectories) to general relativistic geodesics. If gravitons are given a small but non-zero mass, it could explain the [[cosmological constant]] without need for [[dark energy]] and solve the [[Cosmological constant problem|smallness problem]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Energy and wavelength==
While gravitons are presumed to be [[massless particle|massless]], they would still carry [[energy]], as does any other quantum particle. [[Photon energy]] and [[gluon energy]] are also carried by massless particles. It is unclear which variables might determine graviton energy, the amount of energy carried by a single graviton.

Alternatively, [[massive gravity|if gravitons are massive at all]], the analysis of [[gravitational wave]]s yielded a new upper bound on the [[mass]] of gravitons. The graviton's [[Compton wavelength]] is at least {{val|1.6|e=16|u=[[metre|m]]}}, or about 1.6 [[light-year]]s, corresponding to a graviton mass of no more than {{val|7.7|e=-23|u=[[electronvolt|eV]]/[[speed of light|c]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="Abbott2017"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.221101|title=GW170104: Observation of a 50-Solar-Mass Binary Black Hole Coalescence at Redshift 0.2|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|date=1 June 2017|author=B. P. Abbott|display-authors=etal|collaboration=[[LIGO Scientific Collaboration]] and [[Virgo interferometer|Virgo Collaboration]]|volume=118|pages=221101|bibcode=2017PhRvL.118v1101A|arxiv=1706.01812}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relation between wavelength and mass-energy is calculated with the [[Planck–Einstein relation]], the same formula that relates electromagnetic [[wavelength]] to [[photon energy]]. However, if gravitons are the quanta of gravitational waves, then the relation between wavelength and corresponding particle energy is fundamentally different for gravitons than for photons, since the Compton wavelength of the graviton is not equal to the gravitational-wave wavelength. Instead, the lower-bound graviton Compton wavelength is about {{val|9|e=9}} times greater than the gravitational wavelength for the [[GW170104]] event, which was c. 1,700 km. The report&lt;ref name="Abbott2017"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; did not elaborate on the source of this ratio.

==Experimental observation==
Unambiguous detection of individual gravitons, though not prohibited by any fundamental law, is impossible with any physically reasonable detector.&lt;ref name="Rothman"&gt;
{{cite journal
 |last=Rothman |first=T.

 |bibcode=2006FoPh...36.1801R
 |doi=10.1007/s10701-006-9081-9
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason is the extremely low [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] for the interaction of gravitons with matter. For example, a detector with the mass of [[Jupiter]] and 100% efficiency, placed in close orbit around a [[neutron star]], would only be expected to observe one graviton every 10 years, even under the most favorable conditions. It would be impossible to discriminate these events from the background of [[neutrino]]s, since the dimensions of the required neutrino shield would ensure collapse into a [[black hole]].&lt;ref name="Rothman" /&gt;

==Difficulties and outstanding issues==
Most theories containing gravitons suffer from severe problems. Attempts to extend the Standard Model or other quantum field theories by adding gravitons run into serious theoretical difficulties at energies close to or above the [[Planck scale]]. This is because of infinities arising due to quantum effects; technically, gravitation is not [[nonrenormalizable|renormalizable]]. Since classical general relativity and [[quantum mechanics]] seem to be incompatible at such energies, from a theoretical point of view, this situation is not tenable. One possible solution is to replace particles with [[string theory|strings]]. String theories are quantum theories of gravity in the sense that they reduce to classical general relativity plus field theory at low energies, but are fully quantum mechanical, contain a graviton, and are thought to be mathematically consistent.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3986">The '''Indian Network on Climate Change Assessment''' (INCCA) is a proposed network of scientists in [[India]] to be set up to publish peer-reviewed findings on climate change in India.&lt;ref name="INCCA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moef.nic.in/modules/others/?f=event |title=Climate Change and India: A 4X4 Assessment - A sectoral and regional analysis for 2030s|author=Indian Network for Climate Change Assessment|date= |work= |publisher=Ministry of Environment and Forests, Govt of India |accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced on 7 October 2009 [http://moef.nic.in/downloads/others/Final_Book.pdf], saying:
{{quote|The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change (IPCC), has reported that the impact of human activities on climate and climate systems is unequivocal. It is no longer a scientific enquiry but the concern now rather is the timing and magnitude of the abrupt changes in the climate anticipated in the future over and above the continuous climate change occurring due to the continuous warming of the atmosphere. The AR4 projects wide ranging implications and adverse impacts on developing countries for reasons of their lack of capacity to respond to rapid change. Alarmed by the findings, the government of the countries across the world are engaged in working out the impacts and associated vulnerabilities of their economies to impending projected climate change.}}

It was re-announced on 25 January 2012 by an official of the climate change division in the Environment Ministry after a strategy meeting chaired by Joint Secretary (Climate) J.M. Mausker, which also dealt with the framing of India's National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC).&lt;ref name="The Hindu 2010-01-25"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/article94753.ece |title= Sci-Tech / Energy &amp; Environment : Govt working on climate blueprint to be submitted to UNFCCC |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=25 January 2010 |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |quote= |accessdate=2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 February 2010 India's environment [[Minister (government)|minister]] [[Jairam Ramesh]] announced that it would bring together 250 scientists from 125 Indian research institutions and collaborate with international organisations.its first assessment of greenhouse gas emission was released on May 11, 2010 and Its second climate assessment to be published in November 2010 would include reports on the [[Himalayas]], the coastline of India, the Western [[Ghat]] highlands and the north-eastern region of India. He said it would operate as a “sort of Indian IPCC", but will not rival the UN’s [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC).&lt;ref name="Telegraph 2010-02-04"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/climatechange/7157590/India-forms-new-climate-change-body.html |title=India forms new climate change body |author=Dean Nelson |date=4 February 2010 |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |quote= |accessdate=2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramesh also announced the initiation of an Indian National Institute of Himalayan Glaciology. He said that although he respected the IPCC, it was unequal to the task and its weakness was that it did not conduct its own [[research]]. Ramesh also indicated its biases made it insensitive to regional realities, and instead relied on compiling assessments of other reports, which, led to "[[Criticism of the IPCC AR4|goof-ups]]" on the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]] forests, Himalayan glaciers, and ice caps.&lt;ref name="Telegraph 2010-02-04" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://in.news.yahoo.com/241/20100122/1257/tnl-govt-to-set-up-climate-panel.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kahuku Wind Farm''' is a [[wind farm]] located above the hills of [[Kahuku, Hawaii]], United States. It has a nameplate power generating capacity of 30 megawatts, enough to supply power to 7,700 homes. It began operation in early 2011. It was developed by Epplament Energy and First Wind. Kahuku Wind Farm is made up of 12 wind turbines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstwind.com/projects/kahuku-wind First Wind's Kahuku Wind Farm]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The project includes a 15 MW energy storage battery system to ensure that power is available when wind speeds are low.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstwind.com/sites/default/files/032411_Xtreme%20Power%20Release_Kahuku.pdf Xtreme Power’s Dynamic Power Resource Online at Kahuku Wind], Business Wire, March 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 1, 2012 the energy storage building caught fire and burned for three days, resulting in a shutdown of energy production by the project. Later power generation resumed without the battery building. &lt;ref&gt;Audrey McAvoy. [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/03/hawaii-kahuku-wind-farm_n_1735788.html Hawaii's Kahuku Wind Farm Is An Industry Pioneer, Despite Fire Setback], ''[[Huffington Post]]'', August 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''kicksled''' or '''spark''' is a small [[sled]]  consisting of a chair mounted on a pair of flexible metal runners which extend  backward to about twice the chair's length. The sled is propelled by kicking ("sparke" or "sparka" in the Scandinavian languages) the ground by foot. There is a handlebar attached to the top of the chair back. "Kicksled" is a direct translation of the Finnish word "potkukelkka". Some other possible translations are "kicker" and "chair-sled".

== Design ==

The typical adult sized sled has runners about {{Convert|2|m|in|abbr=on}} long, spaced {{Convert|400|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} apart. The steel runner blades are about {{Convert|5|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide. The handlebars are about {{Convert|900|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} above ground.
 
The kicksled is driven forward by the driver standing on one  runner, kicking backwards on the ground with the other foot, hence the name. The flexibility of the runners allows the driver to steer the kicksled by twisting the handlebars. One can have a passenger or luggage on the chair seat. The kicksled can also be used as a dog sled.

A kicksled is designed to be used on hard, slippery surfaces like ice or hardpacked snow. To kicksled in deeper, more powdery snow, extra-wide plastic snow runners are attached to the standard, thin runners of the sled. On very smooth, bare ice, the use of traction devices like spiked shoes or crampons improves kicking force. On level ground, one can easily reach a speed of {{Convert|15|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} to {{Convert|20|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, and much faster on downhill section or with a strong tail wind.

The kicksled is in common use in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]],  especially where roads are not sanded or salted.

It is also an excellent means of travelling over frozen lakes to go ice fishing or just to explore the lake. Kicksledding on lake ice shares many of the same features as [[tour skating]].

Some models also include a wheel kit allowing to transform the sled to a kind of walking aid for summer use. This type is especially popular amongst the elderly.

==History==

The first definite record of a kicksled was in a newspaper in northern Sweden around 1870. The kicksleds of that era had stiff wooden runners and were heavy. In 1909 the design of the modern kicksled with flexible metal runners was introduced by the Swedish factory Orsasparken&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://svensktuppfinnaremuseum.se/sparkstottingen/
|title=Sparkstötting 
|work= Svenskt Uppfinnaremuseum (Swedish Inventor Museum)
|date=31 January 2015
|accessdate=1 March 2017
|language=Swedish
|trans-title=Kicksled}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
which quickly became standard in Finland, Sweden and Norway.

== Racing ==
[[Image:Racing on Kickspark.jpg|thumb|Kickspark racer]]

In the years 1890 to 1910 kicksled racing was a popular sport, especially in Sweden. Kicksled racing was a major event in the
[[Nordic Games]], which were the ancestor of the Winter Olympics.

Around 1990 kicksled racing was revived as a serious sport in Finland. There are races of up to {{Convert|100|km}} long and the average speed is around {{Convert|30|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}. Often the kicksled races are held in conjunction with marathon [[speed skating]] races on natural ice; the kicksleds use the same ice track as the skaters.

A light-weight racing kicksled model is mass-produced by the Finnish kicksled company ESLA. Another racing and sport purposed aluminium-alloy based ultralight kicksled - the Kickspark is produced by Kickbike Worldwide in Finland.

In Canada, the kick sled has been modified for dog sports. A bridle is attached to the kick sled, and a gangline to that, with one to three dogs pulling. This small sled is useful for the urban dog owner, as it is lighter and easier to transport than a full scale dog sled. Kick sled races are now being held, with teams racing at times comparable to skijorers.

Norways's Geilo Ski Resort boasts an annual [http://www.geilo.no/en/Activities/Events/?&amp;TLl=en&amp;TLp=304130&amp;TLpi=341_22_26 Kicksled World Championship] every January.

The '''Kilopondmetre''' is an obsolete unit of [[torque]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spektrum.de/lexikon/physik/kilopondmeter/8020 Kilopondmeter in "Spektrum" - Lexikon der Physik]. 1998 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[energy]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemie.de/lexikon/Kilopondmeter.html Kilopondmeter in Chemie.de] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[gravitational metric system]]. It is abbreviated '''kp·m''' or '''m·kp''', older publications often use '''m&amp;shy;kg''' and '''kg&amp;shy;m''' as well.

Torque is a product of the length of a lever and the force applied to the lever. One kilopond is the force applied to one kilogram due to gravitational acceleration; this force is exactly 9.80665 N.
This means 1 kp·m = 9.80665 kg·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9.80665 N·m.

'''Kjofossen Power Station''' is a [[hydroelectric power plant]] at [[Sogn og Fjordane]] built during [[World War II]]. Part of its power is used as railway [[traction current]], i.e. [[single-phase electric power]] at 16 2/3&amp;nbsp;[[hertz]], fed directly into the overhead wire of the [[railway]] to [[Bergen]]. The only other power station in Norway to produce traction current is [[Hakavik Power Station]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2069">The '''Minkowski distance''' is a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] in a [[normed vector space]] which can be considered as a generalization of both the [[Euclidean distance]] and the [[Manhattan distance]].

==Definition==

The Minkowski distance of order ''p'' between two points

: &lt;math&gt;X=(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)\text{ and }Y=(y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;

is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;D\left(X,Y\right)=\left(\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-y_i|^p\right)^{1/p}&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;p\geq1&lt;/math&gt;, the Minkowski distance is a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] as a result of the [[Minkowski inequality]].  When &lt;math&gt;p&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, the distance between (0,0) and (1,1) is &lt;math&gt;2^{1/p}&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;, but the point (0,1) is at a distance 1 from both of these points.  Since this violates the [[triangle inequality]], for &lt;math&gt;p&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; it is not a metric.

Minkowski distance is typically used with ''p'' being 1 or 2, which correspond to the [[Manhattan distance]] and the [[Euclidean distance]], respectively. In the limiting case of ''p'' reaching infinity, we obtain the [[Chebyshev distance]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{p\to\infty}{\left(\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-y_i|^p\right)^\frac{1}{p}} = \max_{i=1}^n |x_i-y_i|. \,&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for ''p'' reaching negative infinity, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{p\to-\infty}{\left(\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-y_i|^p\right)^\frac{1}{p}} = \min_{i=1}^n |x_i-y_i|. \,&lt;/math&gt;

The Minkowski distance can also be viewed as a multiple of the [[power mean]] of the component-wise differences between ''P'' and ''Q''.

The following figure shows unit circles with various values of ''p'':

This '''division of Germany into major [[natural region]]s''' takes account primarily of [[geomorphological]], [[geological]], [[hydrological]], and [[pedological]] criteria in order to divide the country into large, physical units with a common geographical basis. Political boundaries play no part in this, apart from defining the national border.

In addition to a division of Germany by ''natural regions'', the federal authorities have also produced a division by so-called ''landscape areas (Landschaftsräume)'' that is based more on human utilisation of various regions and so has clearly different boundaries.

== Groundwork by the Federal Institute of Regional Studies (BfL) ==
The natural region classification of Germany, as used today by the [[Federal Office for Nature Conservation]] (''Bundesamt für Naturschutz'' or BfN) and by most state institutions, is largely based on the work in producing the [[Handbook of Natural Region Divisions of Germany]] between the years 1953 to 1962. This divided the present federal territory (then West and East Germany) into 86 &lt;ref&gt;whilst the regions were numbered 01-90, there were only 86 in toto because nos. 47/48 were used for a single group and the numbers 49, 65 and 66 were unused.&lt;/ref&gt; so-called major landscape unit groups (''Haupteinheitgruppen'') each with a two-digit number between 01 and 90. These, in turn, were subdivided into up to ten, in some cases more, major landscape units (''Haupteinheiten''), each with a three-digit number. The handbook was accompanied by 1:100,000 scale mapping and, in the updated 1960 map, the major landscape unit groups were bundled together into major regions (''Großregionen'').&lt;ref name="Meynen"&gt;[[Emil Meynen|E. Meynen]] and [[Josef Schmithüsen|J. Schmithüsen]]: [[Handbuch der naturräumlichen Gliederung Deutschlands]] – Bundesanstalt für Landeskunde, Remagen/Bad Godesberg 1953-1962 (9 editions in 8 books, updated 1960 1:1,000,000 map with major units)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Großregionen" /&gt;

As a result, a regional classification of Germany emerged with five (since 1976: six)&lt;ref name="Großregionen" /&gt; primary landscape regions (''naturräumliche Großregionen 1. Ordnung''), divided into 18 (since 1964: 19)&lt;ref name="Großregionen" /&gt; secondary landscape regions (''naturräumliche Großregionen 2. Ordnung''). The major unit groups form, in effect, the third or tertiary level,&lt;ref name ="Ordnung 3"&gt;However, in some instances, the third level landscape regions combine several groups together.&lt;/ref&gt; of landscape regions and the major units form the fourth level. Many secondary landscape regions only have one major unit group ([[Mecklenburg Coastal Lowland]], [[Harz]], [[Thuringian Basin]], [[Upper Main-Upper Palatine Hills]], [[Southern Alpine Foreland]]), others group well-known major regions together ([[Rhenish Massif]], [[South German Scarplands]]); others are entirely new groupings.

In the subsequent work at 1:200,000 scale that lasted until the 1990s, that further split the landscape regions into a fifth and lower levels (using the three-digits numbers supplemented with further numbers placed after a decimal comma), it became apparent that the boundaries of major regions at the second and third levels had to be corrected in several places and, in individual cases, were no longer compatible with boundaries of the major unit groups.&lt;ref name="Großregionen" /&gt; This has no impact on the numbering system of the lower levels, however.

== New Classification by the Federal Office for Nature Conservation (BfN) ==
From 1992 to 1994, Axel Ssymank revised the major unit groups 01-90 under the direction of the [[BfN]]. Most groups retained their boundaries, however, in some cases two to four major units groups according to the handbook were combined, whilst in the North and Baltic Seas, one old group was divided into four new ones.

The numbering of the new units, D01 to D73, is entirely new and runs from north to south not, as in the handbook, from south to north. So it is not compatible with the numbers of the main and subordinate landscape units, which is why it has not been adopted by the state institutions. Even the BfN has largely followed the older system in the handbook in its [[landscape fact file]]s (''Landschaftssteckbriefe'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfn.de/fileadmin/MDB/documents/themen/natura2000/Naturraeume_Deutschlands.pdf Biogeografische Regionen und naturräumliche Haupteinheiten Deutschlands] (pdf, 216 kB) by Ssymank (1994), Übersicht und Kommentar; Bundesamt für Naturschutz. ''Caution: in the document the term major units (''Haupteinheiten'') is incorrectly used to refer to major unit groups (''Haupteinheitengruppen'', in the sense of the Institute for Regional Studies)!''&lt;/ref&gt;

Ssymank combined the natural regions into eight so-called great landscapes (''Großlandschaften''), which are rather less finely divided than the secondary main regions (''Großregionen 2. Ordnung'') of the BfL. The only discrepancy between the two systems is the division of the North German Plain into western and eastern parts, which is based on their climatic division into Atlantic and Continental areas. The boundary runs randomly east of landscape units D22, D24, D28, D31, and D33. These great landscape definitions have yet to be used in the literature.

== List of major landscape regions - levels 1 to 3 ==
Germany can be divided into three major geographical regions: the [[Northern Lowland]] or North German Plain, the [[Central Uplands]], and the [[Alps]] running roughly west to east across the country.&lt;ref name=Elkins/&gt;

The official major landscape groups, which more or less correspond to the tertiary level &lt;ref name ="Ordnung 3" /&gt; of major landscape regions, are grouped following the primary and secondary landscape region system. These subdivisions largely correspond to the publications of the Institute for Regional Studies (BfL) since 1960 which are:

*The first version by Heinrich Müller-Miny appeared in the updated handbook map, the overview maps of the individual map sheets from 1960 and in the ninth edition of the handbook (1962)&lt;ref name="Großregionen"&gt;[http://geographie.giersbeck.de/Naturraeumliche_Grossregionen_Deutschlands.pdf Naturräumliche Großregionenkarten 1960–1963, 1964–1978 und 1979–1994] nach Müller-Miny et al. (pdf, 1.2 MB)&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the map sheets from publication year 1964 this version was slightly changed:&lt;ref name="Großregionen" /&gt;
**The Upper Palatine-Upper Main Hills (''Oberpfälzisch-Obermainische Hügelland'') was raised from the third to the second level.
**The secondary landscape region of ''Lössbörden''&lt;ref name="unbekannt" /&gt; was expanded, especially in the west.
*There was another change in the map sheets from 1979 (Sheet 182 Burghausen) until their last publication (Sheet München and Tegernsee 1994):&lt;ref name="Großregionen" /&gt;
**The primary landscape region, Central Uplands (''Mittelgebirge''), was divided in two into ''Mittelgebirgsschwelle''&lt;ref name="unbekannt" /&gt; and ''Schichtstufenland''&lt;ref name="unbekannt" /&gt; 
*The classification of the [[Natural regions in Saxony]], published after that of the  Institute for Regional Studies and continually revised, allocates the larger northern part of the major unit group of Upper Lusatia (''Oberlausitz'') to the Lössbörden, so that only the Lusatian Mountains (''Lausitzer Bergland'') in the south remains within the Central Uplands.

For clarity the first and second levels of the major landscape regions are organised from north to south and from west to east. Within a secondary or tertiary landscape region the list follows the numerical order in the handbook; the BfN's numbers are given in brackets. Tertiary major landscape regions are shown in bold italics. Maps, all to the same scale, are shown to the right of the lists.

For clarity, the English names for the natural regions are given; German names may be found at the relevant article. The English names are primarily based on Dickinson (1964)&lt;ref name="Dickinson"&gt;Dickinson (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; and Elkins (1972)&lt;ref name="Elkins"&gt;Elkins (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; where their classification corresponds closely to the handbook's. In such cases the source of the English name is referenced.

The seven major regions are: the [[#Northeast German Plain|Northeast German Plain]], the [[#Northwest German Plain|Northwest German Plain]], the [[#Western Central Uplands|Western Central Uplands]], the [[#Eastern Central Uplands|Eastern Central Uplands]], the [[South German Scarplands]],&lt;ref name="Elkins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dickinson"/&gt;, the [[Alpine Foreland]], and the [[#North and Baltic Seas|North and Baltic Seas]].

==== Classification by Dongus and Hormann ====
The four single map sheets with the Alpine regions were published relatively late. Klaus Hormann schlug im 1978 erschienenen Blatt Salzburg vor, die bisherige Aufspaltung in die Gruppen 01 und 02 aufzugeben und die Ziffern ab 90, die auf dem Festland noch nicht vergeben waren, für eine vom Handbuch deutlich abweichende Gliederung zu verwenden. Diesem Vorschlag folgte auch Hansjörg Dongus, der in den Jahren 1991 bis 1994 die anderen Alpenblätter (Tegernsee, Kaufbeuren/Mittenwald, Lindau/Oberstdorf) als welche der allerletzten Blätter bearbeitete. Die resultierende Gliederung der Alpen weicht in ihrer Struktur deutlich von den anderen Gliederungen ab, da insbesondere die einzelnen Einheiten nicht mehr [[einfach zusammenhängend]] sind.

[[Nagelfluh]]-Vorberge wie der [[Pfänder]] werden, abweichend vom Handbuch, von Dongus nicht den Alpen, sondern dem Alpenvorland zugerechnet. Sie werden, gemeinsam mit dem [[Adelegg]] und dem [[Rottachberg]], in die neue Gruppe 02 [[Nagelfluhhöhen und Senken]] (''zwischen Bodensee und Wertach'' bzw. ''im Alpenvorland''&lt;ref name="Nagelfluhhöhen"&gt;Ursprünglicher Name auf Blatt Lindau/Oberstdorf (1991) war ''Nagelfluhhöhen und Senken zwischen Bodensee und Isar''; indes stellte sich im östlich benachbarten Blatt Kaufbeuren/Mittenwald (1993) heraus, dass diese Einheit nur bis zur [[Wertach (Fluss)|Wertach]] reicht. Dessen ungeachtet gibt es im Schweizer Voralpengebiet eine völlig analoge Region (s. o.), die Dongus ebenfalls in 02 (neu) ansiedelt, weshalb die Beschränkung auf den Raum zwischen Bodensee und Wertach entfällt!&lt;/ref&gt;) eingegliedert. Auch die ganz in der Schweiz liegenden und von Süden an den Bodensee stoßenden [[Molassekämme von St. Gallen-Appenzell]] werden, ohne Nummernvergabe, in Abweichung vom Handbuch, dieser Gruppe (02) zugerechnet.&lt;ref name="Einzelblätter"&gt;Verschiedene Autoren: ''Geographische Landesaufnahme: [[Handbuch der naturräumlichen Gliederung Deutschlands#Einzelblätter|Die naturräumlichen Einheiten in Einzelblättern 1:200.000]].''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4082">'''Osmiridium''' and '''iridosmine''' are natural alloys of the elements [[osmium]] and [[iridium]], with traces of other platinum-group metals.

Osmiridium has been defined as containing a higher proportion of iridium, with iridosmine containing more osmium. However, as the content of the natural Os-Ir alloys varies considerably, the constituent percentages of specimens often reflects the reverse situation of osmiridium describing specimens containing a higher proportion of osmium and iridosmine specimens containing more iridium.

== Nomenclature ==
In 1963, M. H. Hey proposed using iridosmine for hexagonal specimens with 32% &lt; Os &lt; 80%, osmiridium for cubic specimens with Os &lt; 32% and native osmium for specimens Os &gt; 80% (the would-be mineral native iridium of &gt;80% purity was not known at that time).

In 1973, Harris and Cabri defined the following names for Os-Ir-Ru alloys: ruthenosmiridium was applied to cubic Os-Ir-Ru alloys, where Ir &lt; 80% of (Os+Ir+Ru) and Ru &gt; 10% of (Os+Ir+Ru) with no single other element &gt;10% of the total; Rutheniridosmine was applied to cubic Os-Ir-Ru alloys, where Os &lt; 80% of (Os+Ir+Ru) and Ru is 10–80% of (Os+Ir+Ru) with no single other element &gt;10% of the total; the Ru-Os alloys be known as ruthenian osmium (&gt;50% Os), osmian ruthenium (&gt;50% Ru); the Ru-Ir alloys be known as iridian ruthenium and ruthenian iridium where the boundary between them is defined by the alloy's miscibility gap (a minimum 57% Ir for ruthenian iridium and a minimum of 55% Ru for iridian ruthenium).

The nomenclature of Os-Ir-Ru alloys were revised again by Harris and Cabri in 1991. Afterwards, only four names were applied to minerals whose compositions lie within the ternary Os-Ir-Ru system: osmium (native osmium) for all hexagonal alloys with Os the major element; iridium (native iridium) for all cubic alloys with iridium the major element; rutheniridosmine for all hexagonal alloys with Ir the major element; and ruthenium (native ruthenium) for all hexagonal alloys with Ru the major element. The mineral names iridosmine, osmiridium, rutheniridosmium, ruthenian osmium, osmian ruthenium, ruthenium iridium and iridian ruthenium were proposed to be retired.

== Related compounds ==

Natural alloys also occur in the systems Ir-Os-Rh, Os-Ir-Pt, Ru-Ir-Pt, Ir-Ru-Rh and Pd-Ir-Pt. Names used in these systems have included platiniridium (or platinian iridium) and iridrhodruthenium. 
However, there is no universally accepted method of plotting these compositions and their names, especially in the ternary systems.

== Properties ==

The properties of all these alloys generally fall between those of the members, but hardness is greater than the individual constituents.

==Occurrence==

Os-Ir alloys are very rare, but can be found in [[mining|mine]]s of other [[platinum-group metal]]s. One very productive mine was operated at Adamsfield near [[Tyenna, Tasmania|Tyenna]] in [[Tasmania]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]] with the ore shipped out by railway from [[Maydena]]. The site of the mine is now totally reclaimed by dense natural bush. It was once one of the world's major producers of this rare metal, and the osmiridium was mostly found in shallow alluvial workings.&lt;ref&gt;Bottrill, R. S.; 1989, Economic Geology Appendix A; Tasmanian Geol. Surv. Explanatory Rept. 73 ( Huntley.) Cited at [http://www.mindat.org/loc-31109.html Adamsfield, Tasmania, Australia]. Mindat.org. Accessed May 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
The element is currently valued at about US$400 per troy ounce.

==Isolation==
It can be isolated by adding a piece to [[aqua regia]], which has the ability to dissolve [[gold]] and [[platinum]] but not osmiridium. It occurs naturally as small, extremely hard, flat metallic grains with hexagonal crystal structure.

'''Peak uranium''' is the point in time that the maximum global [[uranium]] production rate is reached.

Pessimistic predictions of future high-grade uranium production operate on the thesis that either the peak has already occurred in the 1980s or that a second peak may occur sometime around 2035.

At the start of 2015, identified uranium reserves recoverable at US$130/kg were 5.7 million tons.&lt;ref name="Red Book"/&gt; At the rate of consumption in 2014, these reserves are sufficient for 135 years of supply.&lt;ref name="Red Book"/&gt; The identified reserves as of 2015 recoverable at US$260/kg are 7.6 million tons.&lt;ref name="Red Book"/&gt;

Optimistic predictions are based upon 3 factors:
# Light Water Reactors only consume about half of one percent of their uranium fuel while [[fast breeder reactor]]s will consume closer to 99%,
# current reserves of U are about 5.3 million tons. Theoretically 4.5 billion tons of uranium are available from sea water at about 10 times the current price of uranium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2012/ph241/ferguson2/|title=Uranium Extraction from Seawater|website=large.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently no practical methods for high volume extraction exist.
# [[thorium]] (3–4 times as abundant as uranium) can be used when supplies of uranium are depleted. 
If these predictions became reality it has the potential to increase the supply of nuclear fuel significantly. Currently, despite decades of research, there are no commercially practical Thorium reactors in operation and it is therefore unlikely that such prediction will become reality.

Optimistic predictions claim that the supply is far more than demand and do not predict peak uranium.

==Hubbert's peak and uranium==
{{See also|Hubbert peak theory}}

Uranium-235, the fissile isotope of uranium used in nuclear reactors, makes up about 0.7% of uranium from ore. It is the only naturally occurring isotope capable of directly generating nuclear power, and is a finite, non-renewable resource. It is believed{{citation needed|reason=By whom? Hubbert himself saw uranium as practically unlimited|date=April 2015}} that its availability follows [[M. King Hubbert]]'s peak theory, which was developed to describe [[peak oil]]. Hubbert saw oil as a resource which would soon run out, but he believed that uranium had much more promise as an energy source,&lt;ref name="mkinghubbert1956"/&gt; and that [[breeder reactor]]s and [[nuclear reprocessing]], which were new technologies at the time, would allow uranium to be a power source for a very long time. The technologies Hubbert envisioned would substantially reduce the rate of depletion of uranium-235, but they are still more costly than the "once-through" cycle, and have not been widely deployed to date.&lt;ref name=Fetter2005&gt;{{cite web

According to the Hubbert Peak Theory, Hubbert's peaks are the points where production of a resource, has reached its maximum, and from then on, the rate of resource production enters a terminal decline. After a Hubbert's peak, the rate of supply of a resource no longer fulfills the previous demand rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

According to Cameco Corporation, the demand for uranium is directly linked to the amount of electricity generated by nuclear power plants.  Reactor capacity is growing slowly, reactors are being run more productively, with higher capacity factors, and reactor power levels.  Improved reactor performance translates into greater uranium consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Another factor to consider is population growth. Electricity consumption is determined in part by economic and population growth.

As countries are not able to supply their own needs of uranium economically, countries have resorted to importing uranium ore from elsewhere. For example, owners of U.S. nuclear power reactors bought {{convert|67|e6lb|kilotonne}} of natural uranium in 2006.

Because of the improvements in [[gas centrifuge]] technology in the 2000s, replacing former [[Gaseous diffusion|gaseous diffusion plants]], cheaper [[separative work units]] have enabled the economic production of more [[enriched uranium]] from a given amount of natural uranium, by re-enriching tails ultimately leaving a [[depleted uranium]] tail of lower enrichment.

Peak uranium refers to the peak of the entire planet's uranium production.  Like other [[Hubbert peak theory|Hubbert peaks]], the rate of uranium production on Earth will enter a terminal decline.  According to Robert Vance of the OECD's Nuclear Energy Agency, the world production rate of uranium has already reached its peak in 1980, amounting to {{convert|69683|t|e6lb}} of U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; from 22 countries. However, this is not due to lack of production capacity. Historically, uranium mines and mills around the world have operated at about 76% of total production capacity, varying within a range of 57% and 89%. The low production rates have been largely attributable to excess capacity. Slower growth of nuclear power and competition from secondary supply significantly reduced demand for freshly mined uranium until very recently. Secondary supplies include military and commercial inventories, enriched uranium tails, reprocessed uranium and mixed oxide fuel.&lt;ref name=WNA2006&gt;{{cite web

According to data from the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], world production of mined uranium has peaked twice in the past: once, circa 1960 in response to stockpiling for military use, and again in 1980, in response to stockpiling for use in commercial nuclear power. Up until about 1990, the mined uranium production was in excess of consumption by power plants. But since 1990, consumption by power plants has outstripped the uranium being mined; the deficit being made up by liquidation of the military (through decommissioning of nuclear weapons) and civilian stockpiles. Uranium mining has increased since the mid-1990s, but is still less than the consumption by power plants.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Slezak, [http://www.iaea.org/OurWork/ST/NE/NEFW/documents/RawMaterials/RTC-Ghana-2010/5.RedBook.pdf "Red Book – Uranium: Resources, Production and Demand,"], International Atomic Energy Agency workshop, Ghana, July 2010, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's top uranium producers are Canada (28% of world production) and Australia (23%).  Other major producers include [[Kazakhstan]], Russia, [[Namibia]] and [[Niger]].&lt;ref name="World Uranium Production"&gt;{{cite web

Various agencies have tried to estimate how long these primary resources will last, assuming a [[Nuclear fuel cycle#Once through nuclear fuel cycle|once-through cycle]].  The European Commission said in 2001 that at the current level of uranium consumption, known uranium resources would last 42 years. When added to military and secondary sources, the resources could be stretched to 72 years. Yet this rate of usage assumes that nuclear power continues to provide only a fraction of the world’s energy supply. If electric capacity were increased six-fold, then the 72-year supply would last just 12 years.&lt;ref name=Jameson20050815 /&gt; The world's present measured resources of uranium, economically recoverable at a price of US$130/kg according to the industry groups [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), [[Nuclear Energy Agency]] (NEA) and [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), are enough to last for "at least a century" at current consumption rates.&lt;ref name=UraniumShortage&gt;{{cite web

Undiscovered resources, i.e. uranium deposits that can be expected to be found based on the geological characteristics of already discovered resources, have also risen to 10.5&amp;nbsp;million tonnes. This is an increase of 0.5&amp;nbsp;million tonnes compared to the previous edition of the report. The increases are due to both new discoveries and re-evaluations of known resources, encouraged by higher prices.

===Reserves===
Reserves are the most readily available resources.  Resources that are known to exist and easy to mine are called "Known conventional resources".  Resources that are thought to exist but have not been mined are classified under "Undiscovered conventional resources".&lt;ref name=NEA2002&gt;{{cite web

The known uranium resources represent a higher level of assured resources than is normal for most minerals. Further exploration and higher prices will certainly, on the basis of present geological knowledge, yield further resources as present ones are used up. There was very little uranium exploration between 1985 and 2005, so the significant increase in exploration effort that we are now seeing could readily double the known economic resources. On the basis of analogies with other metal minerals, a doubling of price from price levels in 2007 could be expected to create about a tenfold increase in measured resources, over time.&lt;ref name=WNASupply&gt;{{cite web

====Known conventional resources====
Known conventional resources are "Reasonably Assured Resources" and "Estimated Additional Resources-I".&lt;ref name=NEA2002/&gt;

In 2006, about 4 million tons of conventional resources were thought to be sufficient at current consumption rates for about six decades (4.06 million tonnes at 65,000 tones per year).&lt;ref name=JapanFocus20090320&gt;{{cite web

From 1981 to 2007, annual exploration expenditures grew modestly, from 4 million US$ to 7 million US$. This skyrocketed to US $11 million in 2011.&lt;ref name="world-nuclear.org"/&gt; Consumption of uranium runs at around 75 000 t a year. This is less than production, and requires draw down of existing stocks.

About 96% of the global uranium reserves are found in these ten countries: Australia, Canada, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Brazil, Namibia, Uzbekistan, the United States, Niger, and Russia.&lt;ref name="Uranium reserves"/&gt; The world's largest deposits of uranium are found in three countries.  Australia has just over 30% of the world's reasonably assured resources and inferred resources of uranium – about  {{convert|1.673|Mt|e9lb}}.&lt;ref name=UIC200606/&gt;
Kazakhstan has about 12% of the world's reserves, or about {{convert|651|kilotonne|e9lb}}.&lt;ref name="UIC200703"/&gt;  And Canada has {{convert|485|kilotonne|e6lb}} of uranium, representing about 9%.&lt;ref name=UIC200606/&gt;

Several countries in Europe no longer mine uranium (East Germany (1990), France (2001), Spain (2002) and Sweden (1969)); they were not major producers.&lt;ref name=OECDredbook2003p29/&gt;

====Undiscovered conventional resources====
Undiscovered conventional resources can be broken up into two classifications "Estimated Additional Resources-II" and "Speculative Resources".&lt;ref name=NEA2002/&gt;

It will take a significant exploration and development effort to locate the remaining deposits and begin mining them.  However, since the entire earth's geography has not been explored for uranium at this time, there is still the potential to discover exploitable resources.&lt;ref name=OECDredbook2003p20&gt;{{cite web

===Secondary resources===
Secondary resources are essentially recovered uranium from other sources such as nuclear weapons, inventories, reprocessing and re-enrichment.  Since secondary resources have exceedingly low discovery costs and very low production costs, they may have displaced a significant portion of primary production.  Secondary uranium was and is available essentially instantly.  However,  new primary production will not be.  Essentially, secondary supply is a "one-time" finite supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Only 62% of the requirements of power utilities are supplied by mines. The balance comes from inventories held by utilities and other fuel cycle companies, inventories held by governments, used reactor fuel that has been reprocessed, recycled materials from military nuclear programs and uranium in depleted uranium stockpiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The US undertook to pursue a self-funded dual track program (immobilization and MOX).  The G-7 nations provided US$1 billion to set up Russia's program. The latter was initially MOX specifically designed for VVER reactors, the Russian version of the Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR), the high cost being because this was not part of Russia's fuel cycle policy.

====Reprocessing and recycling====
{{Main|Nuclear reprocessing|Reprocessed uranium}}

[[Nuclear reprocessing]], sometimes called recycling, is one method of mitigating the eventual peak of uranium production. It is most useful as part of a [[nuclear fuel cycle]] utilizing [[fast-neutron reactor]]s since [[reprocessed uranium]] and [[reactor-grade plutonium]] both have isotopic compositions not optimal for use in today's [[thermal-neutron reactor]]s. Although reprocessing of nuclear fuel is done in a few countries ([[Nuclear power in France|France]], [[Nuclear power in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], and [[Nuclear power in Japan|Japan]]) the United States President banned reprocessing in the late 1970s due to the high costs and the risk of [[nuclear proliferation]] via plutonium.  In 2005, U.S. legislators proposed a program to reprocess the spent fuel that has accumulated at power plants. At present prices, such a program is significantly more expensive than disposing spent fuel and mining fresh uranium.&lt;ref name=Fetter2005/&gt;

Currently, there are eleven reprocessing plants in the world.  Of these, two are large-scale commercially operated plants for the reprocessing of spent fuel elements from light water reactors with throughputs of more than {{convert|1|kilotonne|e6lb}} of uranium per year.  These are La Hague, France with a capacity of {{convert|1.6|kilotonne|e6lb}} per year and [[Sellafield]], England at {{convert|1.2|kilotonne|e6lb}} uranium per year.  The rest are small experimental plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Most of the [[Spent nuclear fuel|spent fuel]] components can be recovered and recycled.  About two-thirds of the U.S. spent fuel inventory is uranium.  This includes residual fissile uranium-235 that can be recycled directly as fuel for [[heavy water reactor]]s or enriched again for use as fuel in [[light water reactor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Plutonium and uranium can be chemically separated from spent fuel.  When used nuclear fuel is reprocessed using the [[de facto standard]] [[PUREX]] method, both plutonium and uranium are recovered separately.  The spent fuel contains about 1% plutonium. [[Reactor-grade plutonium]] contains Pu-240 which has a high rate of spontaneous fission, making it an undesirable contaminant in producing safe nuclear weapons.  Nevertheless, nuclear weapons can be made with reactor grade plutonium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The spent fuel is primarily composed of uranium, most of which has not been consumed or transmuted in the nuclear reactor. At a typical concentration of around 96% by mass in the used nuclear fuel, uranium is the largest component of used nuclear fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  |date=January 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The composition of reprocessed uranium depends on the time the fuel has been in the reactor, but it is mostly [[uranium-238]], with about 1% [[uranium-235]], 1% [[uranium-236]] and smaller amounts of other isotopes including [[uranium-232]].  However, reprocessed uranium is also a waste product because it is contaminated and undesirable for reuse in reactors.&lt;ref name=UCS2006&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During its irradiation in a reactor, uranium is profoundly modified. The uranium that leaves the reprocessing plant contains all the isotopes of uranium between [[uranium-232]] and [[uranium-238]] except [[uranium-237]], which is rapidly transformed into [[neptunium-237]]. The undesirable isotopic contaminants are:
*Uranium-232 (whose decay products emit strong gamma radiation making handling more difficult), and
*Uranium-234 (which is fertile material but can affect reactivity differently from uranium-238).
*Uranium-236 (which affects reactivity and absorbs neutrons without fissioning, becoming [[neptunium-237]] which is one of the most difficult isotopes for long-term disposal in a deep geological repository)
*Daughter products of uranium-232: bismuth-212, thallium-208.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

At present, reprocessing and the use of plutonium as reactor fuel is far more expensive than using uranium fuel and disposing of the spent fuel directly – even if the fuel is only reprocessed once.&lt;ref name=UCS2006/&gt; However, nuclear reprocessing becomes more economically attractive, compared to mining more uranium, as uranium prices increase.

The total recovery rate {{convert|5|kilotonne|e6lb}}/yr from reprocessing currently is only a small fraction compared to the growing gap between the rate demanded {{convert|64.615|kilotonne|e6lb}}/yr and the rate at which the primary uranium supply is providing uranium {{convert|46.403|kilotonne|e6lb}}/yr.

Energy Returned on Energy Invested (EROEI) on uranium reprocessing is highly positive, though not as positive as the mining and enrichment of uranium, and the process can be repeated. Additional reprocessing plants may bring some economies of scale.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Unconventional resources===
Unconventional resources are occurrences that require novel technologies for their exploitation and/or use.  Often unconventional resources occur in low-concentration.  The exploitation of unconventional uranium requires additional research and development efforts for which there is no imminent economic need, given the large conventional resource base and the option of [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] spent fuel.&lt;ref name=WorldEnergy2007&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phosphates, seawater, uraniferous coal ash, and some type of [[oil shale]]s are examples of unconventional uranium resources.

====Phosphates====
The soaring price of uranium may cause long-dormant operations to extract uranium from phosphate. Uranium occurs at concentrations of 50 to 200 parts per million in phosphate-laden earth or [[phosphate rock]]. As uranium prices increase, there has been interest in some countries in extraction of uranium from phosphate rock, which is normally used as the basis of phosphate fertilizers.&lt;ref name=HeraldTribune20070511&gt;{{cite web

Worldwide, approximately 400 wet-process [[phosphoric acid]] plants were in operation.  Assuming an average recoverable content of 100 ppm of uranium, and that uranium prices do not increase so that the main use of the phosphates are for [[fertilizers]], this scenario would result in a maximum theoretical annual output of {{convert|3.7|kilotonne|e6lb}} U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There are 22 million tons of uranium in phosphate deposits. Recovery of uranium from phosphates is a [[Mature technology]];&lt;ref name=WorldEnergy2007/&gt; it has been utilized in Belgium and the United States, but high recovery costs limit the utilization of these resources, with estimated production costs in the range of US$60–100/kgU including capital investment, according to a 2003 OECD report for a new 100 tU/year project.&lt;ref name=OECDredbook2003p22/&gt;

==== Seawater ====

Unconventional uranium resources include up to {{convert|4000|Mt|e9lb}} of uranium contained in sea water. Several technologies to extract uranium from sea water have been demonstrated at the laboratory scale.

In the mid-1990s Extraction costs were estimated at 260 [[USD]]/kgU (Nobukawa, et al., 1994) but scaling up laboratory-level production to thousands of tonnes is unproven and may encounter unforeseen difficulties.&lt;ref name=WECSupply&gt;

One method of [[Uranium_mining#Recovery_from_seawater|extracting uranium from seawater]] is using a uranium-specific nonwoven fabric as an absorbent. The total amount of uranium recovered in an experiment in 2003 from three collection boxes containing 350&amp;nbsp;kg of fabric was &gt;1&amp;nbsp;kg of yellow cake after 240 days of submersion in the ocean.&lt;ref name="SekoEtAl2003"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the OECD, uranium may be extracted from seawater using this method for about US$300/kgU.&lt;ref name=OECDredbook2003p22/&gt;

In 2006 the same research group stated:  "If 2g-U/kg-adsorbent is submerged for 60 days at a time and used 6 times, the uranium cost is calculated to be 88,000 [[JPY]]/kgU, including the cost of adsorbent production, uranium collection, and uranium purification. When an extraction 6g of U per kg of adsorbent and 20 repetitions or more becomes possible, the uranium cost reduces to 15,000 yen. This price level is equivalent to that of the highest cost of the minable uranium. The lowest cost attainable now is 25,000 yen with 4g-U/kg-adsorbent used in the sea area of Okinawa, with 18 repetition uses. In this case, the initial investment to collect the uranium from seawater is 107.7 billion yen, which is 1/3 of the construction cost of a one million-kilowatt class nuclear power plant."&lt;ref&gt;

In 2012, [[ORNL]] researchers announced the successful development of a new absorbent material dubbed HiCap, which vastly outperforms previous best adsorbents, which perform surface retention of solid or gas molecules, atoms or ions. "We have shown that our adsorbents can extract five to seven times more uranium at uptake rates seven times faster than the world's best adsorbents", said Chris Janke, one of the inventors and a member of ORNL's Materials Science and Technology Division. HiCap also effectively removes toxic metals from water, according to results verified by researchers at [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120825192521/http://www.ornl.gov/info/press_releases/get_press_release.cfm?ReleaseNumber=mr20120821-00] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Breeding===
{{Main|Breeder reactor}}
A breeder reactor produces more nuclear fuel than it consumes and thus can extend the uranium supply. It typically turns the dominant isotope in natural uranium, uranium-238, into fissile plutonium-239. This results in hundredfold increase in the amount of energy to be produced per mass unit of uranium, because U-238, which constitute 99.3% of natural uranium, is not used in conventional reactors which instead use U-235 which only represent 0.7% of natural uranium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There are two types of breeders: Fast breeders and thermal breeders.

====Fast breeder====
{{Main|Fast breeder reactor}}

A fast breeder, in addition to consuming U-235, converts [[Fertile material|fertile]] U-238 into [[Pu-239]], a [[fissile]] fuel. Fast breeder reactors are more expensive to build and operate, including the reprocessing, and could only be justified economically if uranium prices were to rise to pre-1980 values in real terms. About 20{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} [[fast-neutron reactor]]s have already been operating, some since the 1950s, and one supplies electricity commercially. Over 300 reactor-years of operating experience have been accumulated.  In addition to considerably extending the exploitable fuel supply, these reactors have an advantage in that they produce less long-lived [[transuranic]] wastes, and can consume nuclear waste from current light water reactors, generating energy in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/09/nuclear-waste-burning-reactor | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Duncan | last=Clark | title=Nuclear waste-burning reactor moves a step closer to reality | date=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several countries have research and development programs for improving these reactors. For instance, one scenario in France is for half of the present nuclear capacity to be replaced by fast breeder reactors by 2050. China, India, and Japan plan large scale utilization of breeder reactors during the coming decades.&lt;ref name=WNA2008/&gt; (Following the crisis at Japan's Fukishima Daiichi nuclear power plant in 2011, Japan is revising its plans regarding future use of nuclear power. (''See:'' [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster#Energy policy implications|Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster: Energy policy implications]].))

The breeding of plutonium fuel in [[Fast breeder reactor|Fast Breeder Reactors]] (FBR), known as the plutonium economy, was for a time believed to be the future of nuclear power. But many of the commercial breeder reactors that have been built have been riddled with technical and budgetary problems.  Some sources critical of breeder reactors have gone so far to call them the [[Supersonic Transport]] of the '80s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Fast Breeder Reactors, are called fast because they have no [[neutron moderator|moderator]] slowing down the neutrons (light water, [[heavy water]] or [[graphite]]) and breed more fuel than they consume. The word 'fast' in fast breeder thus refers to the speed of the neutrons in the reactor's core. The higher the energy the neutrons have, the higher the breeding ratio or the more uranium that is changed into plutonium.

Significant technical and materials problems were encountered with FBRs, and geological exploration showed that scarcity of uranium was not going to be a concern for some time.  By the 1980s, due to both factors, it was clear that FBRs would not be commercially competitive with existing light water reactors. The economics of FBRs still depend on the value of the plutonium fuel which is bred, relative to the cost of fresh uranium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Breeder reactors are also being studied under the [[Generation IV reactor]] program.

Early prototypes have been plagued with problems. The liquid [[sodium]] coolant is highly flammable, bursting into flames if it comes into contact with air and exploding if it comes into contact with water.  Japan's fast breeder [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant]] has been scheduled to re-open in 2008, 13 years after a serious accident and fire involving a sodium leak.  In 1997 France shut down its Superphenix reactor, while the Phenix, built earlier, closed as scheduled in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf40.html|title=Nuclear Power in France|website=World-nuclear.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

At higher uranium prices [[breeder reactor]]s may be economically justified. Many nations have ongoing breeder research programs.

As of June 2008 there are only two running commercial breeders and the rate of reactor-grade plutonium production is very small (20 tonnes/yr).  The reactor grade plutonium is being processed into MOX fuel.  However, next to the rate at which uranium is being mined (46,403 tonnes/yr), this is not enough to stave off peak uranium.

==== Thermal breeder ====
{{Main|Breeder reactor#Thermal breeder reactors and thorium}}

[[Thorium]] is an alternate fuel cycle to uranium.  Thorium is three times more plentiful than uranium.  Thorium-232 is in itself not fissile, but [[fertile material|fertile]].  It can be made into fissile [[uranium-233]] in a breeder reactor.  In turn, the uranium-233 can be fissioned, with the advantage that smaller amounts of [[transuranic]]s are produced by [[neutron capture]], compared to [[uranium-235]] and especially compared to [[plutonium-239]].

Despite the [[thorium fuel cycle]] having a number of attractive features, development on a large scale can run into difficulties:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf62.html
  |title=Thorium
  |publisher=Australian Uranium Association / World Nuclear Association
  |date=January 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The resulting U-233 fuel is expensive to fabricate.
* The U-233 chemically separated from the irradiated thorium fuel is highly radioactive.
* Separated U-233 is always contaminated with traces of U-232
* Thorium is difficult to recycle due to highly radioactive Th-228
* If the U-233 can be separated on its own, it becomes a weapons proliferation risk
* And, there are technical problems in reprocessing.

Advocates for liquid core and [[molten salt reactor]]s such as [[LFTR]] claim that these technologies negate the abovementioned thorium's disadvantages present in solid fueled reactors.

The first successful commercial reactor at the [[Indian Point Energy Center|Indian Point power station]] in [[Buchanan, New York]] (Indian Point Unit 1) ran on Thorium. The first core did not live up to expectations.&lt;ref name=AmericanScientist2003&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/25710/page/1 |title=Thorium Fuel for Nuclear Energy - Now You're Cooking with Thorium |publisher=American Scientist |author=Mujid S.

== Supply-demand gap ==
Due to reduction in nuclear weapons stockpiles, a large amount of former weapons uranium was released for use in civilian nuclear reactors. As a result, starting in 1990, a significant portion of uranium nuclear power requirements were supplied by former weapons uranium, rather than newly mined uranium. In 2002, mined uranium supplied only 54 percent of nuclear power requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oecd-nea.org/ndd/pubs/2004/5291-uranium-2003.pdf Uranium 2003], OCED Nuclear Energy Agency, and International Atomic Energy Agency, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; But as the supply of former weapons uranium has been used up, mining has increased, so that in 2012, mining provided 95 percent of reactor requirements, and the OCED Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Atomic Energy Agency projected that the gap in supply would be completely erased in 2013.&lt;ref name="Red Book"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Uranium mining declined with the last [[open pit mine]] shutting down in 1992 (Shirley Basin, Wyoming). United States production occurred in the following states (in descending order): New Mexico, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Texas, Arizona, Florida, Washington, and South Dakota. The collapse of uranium prices caused all conventional mining to cease by 1992.  "In-situ" recovery or ISR has continued primarily in Wyoming and adjacent Nebraska as well has recently restarted in Texas.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

==World peak uranium==

===Historical opinions of world uranium supply limits===

In 1943, [[Alvin M. Weinberg]] et al. believed that there were serious limitations on nuclear energy if only U-235 were used as a nuclear power plant fuel.&lt;ref name=Newtan2007&gt;{{cite book

In 1956, [[M. King Hubbert]] declared world fissionable reserves adequate for at least the next few centuries, assuming breeding and reprocessing would be developed into economical processes.&lt;ref name=mkinghubbert1956/&gt;

In 1975 the [[US Department of the Interior]], Geological Survey, distributed the press release "Known US Uranium Reserves Won't Meet Demand".  It was recommended that the US not depend on foreign imports of uranium.&lt;ref name=Newtan2007/&gt;

[[Michael Meacher]], the former environment minister of the UK 1997–2003, and UK Member of Parliament, reports that peak uranium happened in 1981.  He also predicts a major shortage of uranium sooner than 2013 accompanied with hoarding and its value pushed up to the levels of precious metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Various agencies have tried to estimate how long these resources will last.

*European Commission

The European Commission said in 2001 that at the current level of uranium consumption, known uranium resources would last 42 years. When added to military and secondary sources, the resources could be stretched to 72 years. Yet this rate of usage assumes that nuclear power continues to provide only a fraction of the world’s energy supply. If electric capacity were increased six-fold, then the 72-year supply would last just 12 years.&lt;ref name=Jameson20050815&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*OECD

The world's present measured resources of uranium, economically recoverable at a price of US$130/kg according to the industry groups [[OECD]], [[Nuclear Energy Agency|NEA]] and [[IAEA]], are enough to last for 100 years at current consumption.&lt;ref name="Red Book"/&gt;

*Australian Uranium Association

According to the Australian Uranium Association, yet another industry group, assuming the world's current rate of consumption at 66,500 tonnes of uranium per year and the world's present measured resources of uranium (4.7 Mt) are enough to last for 70 years.&lt;ref name="UIC200703"/&gt;

===Optimistic predictions===
All the following references claim that the supply is far more than demand.  Therefore, they do not predict peak uranium.

* M. King Hubbert
In his 1956 landmark paper, [[M. King Hubbert]] wrote "There is promise, however, provided mankind can solve its international problems and not destroy itself with nuclear weapons, and provided world population (which is now expanding at such a rate as to double in less than a century) can somehow be brought under control, that we may at last have found an energy supply adequate for our needs for at least the next few centuries of the 'foreseeable future.'"&lt;ref name=mkinghubbert1956 /&gt;  Hubbert's study assumed that breeder reactors would replace light water reactors and that uranium would be bred into plutonium (and possibly thorium would be bred into uranium).  He also assumed that economic means of reprocessing would be discovered.  For political, economic and nuclear proliferation reasons, the [[plutonium economy]] never materialized.  Without it, uranium is used up in a once-through process and will peak and run out much sooner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date = September 2013}} However, at present, it is generally found to be cheaper to mine new uranium out of the ground than to use reprocessed uranium, and therefore the use of reprocessed uranium is limited to only a few nations.

* OECD
The OECD estimates that with the world nuclear electricity generating rates of 2002, with LWR, once-through fuel cycle, there are enough conventional resources to last 85 years using known resources and 270 years using known and as yet undiscovered resources.  With breeders, this is extended to 8,500 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

If one is willing to pay $300/kg for uranium, there is a vast quantity available in the ocean.&lt;ref name="Red Book"/&gt; It is worth noting that since fuel cost only amounts to a small fraction of nuclear energy total cost per kWh, and raw uranium price also constitutes a small fraction of total fuel costs, such an increase on uranium prices wouldn’t involve a very significant increase in the total cost per kWh produced.

* Bernard Cohen
In 1983, physicist [[Bernard Cohen (physicist)|Bernard Cohen]] proposed that uranium is effectively inexhaustible, and could therefore be considered a renewable source of energy.&lt;ref name="cohen83"/&gt;  He claims that [[breeder reactor|fast breeder reactors]], fueled by naturally replenished uranium extracted from seawater, could supply energy at least as long as the sun's expected remaining lifespan of five billion years.&lt;ref name="cohen83" /&gt; While uranium is a finite mineral resource within the earth, the hydrogen in the sun is finite too – thus, if the resource of nuclear fuel can last over such time scales, as Cohen contends, then nuclear energy is every bit as sustainable as solar power or any other source of energy, in terms of sustainability over the time scale of life surviving on this planet.

{{quote|We thus conclude that all the world’s energy requirements for the remaining 5×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; yr of existence of life on Earth could be provided by breeder reactors without the cost of electricity rising by as much as 1% due to fuel costs. This is consistent with the definition of a "renewable" energy source in the sense in which that term is generally used.}}

His paper assumes extraction of uranium from seawater at the rate of {{convert|16|kilotonne|e6lb}} per year of uranium.&lt;ref name="cohen83" /&gt; The current demand for uranium is near {{convert|70|kilotonne|e6lb}}  per year; however, the use of breeder reactors means that uranium would be used at least 60 times more efficiently than today.

* James Hopf
A nuclear engineer writing for American Energy Independence in 2004 believes that there is a several hundred years' supply of recoverable uranium even for standard reactors. For breeder reactors, "it is essentially infinite".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanenergyindependence.com/uranium.aspx|title=World Uranium Reserves|website=Americanenergyindependence.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
All the following references claim that the supply is far more than demand.  Therefore, they believe that uranium will not deplete in the foreseeable future.

* IAEA
The IAEA estimates that using only known reserves at the current rate of demand and assuming a once-through nuclear cycle that there is enough uranium for at least 100 years.  However, if all primary known reserves, secondary reserves, undiscovered and unconventional sources of uranium are used, uranium will be depleted in 47,000 years.&lt;ref name="Red Book"/&gt;

* Kenneth S. Deffeyes
[[Kenneth S. Deffeyes]] estimates that if one can accept ore one tenth as rich then the supply of available uranium increased 300 times.&lt;ref name="Deffeyes, K.S.; MacGregor, I.D. 50–60"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"World Uranium Resources", by Kenneth S. Deffeyes and Ian D. MacGregor, ''Scientific American'', January, 1980, page 66, argues that the supply of uranium is very large.&lt;/ref&gt;  His paper shows that uranium concentration in ores is log-normal distributed.  There is relatively little high-grade uranium and a  large supply of very low grade uranium.

*[[Ernest Moniz]]
Ernest J. Moniz, a professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and the current [[United States Secretary of Energy]], testified in 2009 that an abundance of uranium had put into question plans to reprocess spent nuclear fuel. The reprocessing plans dated from decades previous, when uranium was thought to be scarce. But now, "roughly speaking, we’ve got uranium coming out of our ears, for a long, long time," Professor Moniz said.&lt;ref&gt;

==Possible effects and consequences==
As uranium production declines, uranium prices would be expected to increase.  However, the price of uranium makes up only 9% of the cost of running a nuclear power plant, much lower than the cost of coal in a coal-fired power plant (77%), or the cost of natural gas in a gas-fired power plant (93%).&lt;ref&gt;"Nuclear energy's future from a uranium producer's perspective", ''Mining Engineering'', October 2008, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf02.html|title=Nuclear Economics|publisher=World Nuclear Association|date=January 2010|accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uranium is different from conventional energy resources, such as oil and coal, in several key aspects. Those differences limit the effects of short-term uranium shortages, but most have no bearing on the eventual depletion.  Some key features are:
* The uranium market is diverse, and no country has a monopoly influence on its prices.
* Thanks to the extremely high energy density of uranium, stockpiling of several years' worth of fuel is feasible.
* Significant secondary supplies of already mined uranium exist, including decommissioned nuclear weapons, depleted uranium tails suitable for reenrichment, and existing stockpiles.
* Vast amounts of uranium, roughly 800 times the known reserves of mined uranium, are contained in extremely dilute concentrations in seawater.
* Introduction of [[fast neutron reactor]]s, combined with seawater uranium extraction, would make the uranium supply virtually inexhaustible.&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sustainablenuclear.org/PADs/pad11983cohen.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926033320/http://sustainablenuclear.org/PADs/pad11983cohen.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently seven experimental fast neutron reactors running globally, in India, Japan, Russia and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf98.html|title=Nuclear Fusion |publisher= WNA – World Nuclear Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fast neutron reactor]]s ([[breeder reactor]]s) could utilize large amounts of [[Uranium-238]] indirectly by conversion to [[Plutonium-239]], rather than fissioning primarily just [[Uranium-235]] ([[Uranium-235|which is]] 0.7% of original mined uranium), for approximately a factor of 100 increase in uranium usage efficiency.&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt;  Intermediate between conventional estimates of reserves and the 40 trillion tons total of uranium in Earth's crust (trace concentrations adding up over its 3 * 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; ton mass), there are ores of lower grade than otherwise practical but of still higher concentration than the average rock.&lt;ref name="Sevior M. 2006 859–872"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adsabs.harvard.edu"/&gt; Accordingly, resource figures depend on economic and technological assumptions.

===Uranium price===
[[File:MonthlyUraniumSpot.png|thumb|right|350px|Monthly uranium spot price in US$.&lt;ref name=uraniumingo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uranium.info/prices/monthly.html |title=NUEXCO Exchange Value (Monthly Uranium Spot) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212170510/http://www.uranium.info/prices/monthly.html |archivedate=2007-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The uranium spot price has increased from a low in Jan 2001 of US$6.40  per pound of U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; to a peak in June 2007 of US$135.  The uranium prices have dropped substantially since.&lt;ref name=uraniumingo/&gt;  Currently (15 July 2013) the uranium spot is US$38.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The high price in 2007 resulted from shrinking weapons stockpiles and a flood at the [[Cigar Lake Mine]], coupled with expected rises in demand due to more reactors coming online, leading to a [[Uranium bubble of 2007|uranium price bubble]].  Miners and Utilities are bitterly divided on uranium prices.&lt;ref name=StockInterview2007&gt;{{cite web

As prices go up, production responds from existing mines, and production from newer, harder to develop or lower quality uranium ores begins.  Currently, much of the new production is coming from [[Kazakhstan]].  Production expansion is expected in Canada and in the United States.  However, the number of projects waiting in the wings to be brought online now are far less than there were in the 1970s.  There have been some encouraging signs that production from existing or planned mines is responding or will respond to higher prices.  The supply of uranium has recently become very inelastic.  As the demand increases, the prices respond dramatically.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

====Number of contracts====
Unlike other metals such as gold, silver, copper or nickel, uranium is not widely traded on an organized commodity exchange such as the London Metal Exchange. It is traded on the NYMEX but on very low volume.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081207042521/http://www.nymex.com/UX_csf.aspx] &lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it is traded in most cases through contracts negotiated directly between a buyer and a seller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://www.cameco.com/uranium_101/markets/
  |title=Uranium 101: Markets
  |publisher=Cameco
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The structure of uranium supply contracts varies widely. The prices are either fixed or base on referenced to economic indices such as GDP, inflation or currency exchange. Contracts traditionally are based on the uranium spot price and rules by which the price can escalate.  Delivery quantities, schedules, and prices vary from contract to contract and often from delivery to delivery within the term of a contract.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Since the number of companies mining uranium is small, the number of available contracts is also small.  Supplies are running short due to flooding of two of the world's largest mines and a dwindling amount of uranium salvaged from nuclear warheads being removed from service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While demand for the metal has been steady for years, the price of uranium is expected to surge as a host of new nuclear plants come online.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

=====Mining=====
Rising uranium price entices draws investment into new uranium mining projects.&lt;ref name=StockInterview2007/&gt;  Mining companies are returning to abandoned uranium mines with new promises of hundreds of jobs and millions in royalties.  Some locals want them back. Others say the risk is too great, and will try to stop those companies "until there's a cure for cancer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Electric utilities=====
Since many utilities have extensive stockpiles and can plan many months in advance, they take a wait-and-see approach on higher uranium costs. In 2007, spot prices rose significantly due to announcements of planned reactors or new reactors coming online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/32304-u-s-utilities-quietly-worry-about-uranium-supply
  |title=U.S. Utilities Quietly Worry about Uranium Supply
  |date=2007-04-15
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those trying to find uranium in a rising cost climate are forced to face the reality of a seller’s market.  Sellers remain reluctant to sell significant quantities.  By waiting longer, sellers expect to get a higher price for the material they hold.  Utilities on the other hand, are very eager to lock up long-term uranium contracts.&lt;ref name=StockInterview2007/&gt;

According to the NEA, the nature of nuclear generating costs allows for significant increases in the costs of uranium before the costs of generating electricity significantly increase.  A 100% increase in uranium costs would only result in a 5% increase in electric cost.&lt;ref name=NEA2002/&gt;  This is because uranium has to be converted to gas, enriched, converted back to yellow cake and fabricated into fuel elements.  The cost of the finished fuel assemblies are dominated by the processing costs, not the cost of the raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  |title=The Economics of Nuclear Power
  |date=January 2009
  |publisher=Australian Uranium Association / World Nuclear Association
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the cost of electricity from a nuclear power plant is dominated by the high capital and operating costs, not the cost of the fuel.  Nevertheless, any increase in the price of uranium is eventually passed on to the consumer either directly or through a fuel surcharge.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

===Substitutes===
An alternative to uranium is [[thorium]] which is three times more common than uranium. Fast breeder reactors are not needed.

If nuclear power prices rise too quickly, or too high, power companies may look for substitutes in fossil energy (coal, oil, and gas) and/or [[renewable energy]], such as hydro, bio-energy, solar thermal electricity, geothermal, wind, tidal energy. Both fossil energy and some renewable electricity sources (e.g. hydro, bioenergy, solar thermal electricity and geothermal) can be used as base-load.

'''Peukert's law''', presented by the German scientist {{ill|Wilhelm Peukert|de}} in 1897, expresses approximately the change in [[battery (electricity)#Capacity and discharging|capacity]] of rechargeable [[lead–acid batteries]] at different rates of discharge. As the rate of discharge increases, the battery's available capacity decreases, approximately according to Peukert's law.

==Batteries==
Manufacturers specify the capacity of a battery at a specified discharge rate. For example, a battery might be rated at 100 [[ampere hour|A·h]] when discharged at a rate that will fully discharge the battery in 20 hours (at 5 amperes for this example). If discharged at a faster rate the delivered capacity is less. Peukert's law describes a power relationship between the discharge current (normalized to some base rated current) and delivered capacity (normalized to the rated capacity) over some specified range of discharge currents. If Peukert's constant &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the exponent, were equal to unity, the delivered capacity would be independent of the current. For a real battery the exponent is greater than unity, and capacity decreases as discharge rate increases. For a lead–acid battery &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is typically between 1.1 and 1.3. For different lead-acid rechargeable battery technologies it generally ranges from 1.05 to 1.15 for VRSLAB [[AGM batteries]], from 1.1 to 1.25 for [[VRLA battery#Gel battery|gel]], and from 1.2 to 1.6 for [[VRLA battery|flooded]] batteries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bdbatteries.com/peukert.php Peukert constant vs. battery type&lt;/ref&gt; The Peukert constant varies with the age of the battery, generally increasing (getting worse) with age. Application at low discharge rates must take into account the battery [[self-discharge]] current. At very high currents, practical batteries will give less capacity than predicted with a fixed exponent. The equation does not take into account the effect of temperature on battery capacity.

==Formula==
For a one-ampere discharge rate, Peukert's law is often stated as

:&lt;math&gt;C_p = I^k t,&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; is the capacity at a one-ampere discharge rate, which must be expressed in [[ampere hour]]s,
:&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the actual discharge current (i.e. current drawn from a load) in amperes,
:&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the actual time to discharge the battery, which must be expressed in [[hour]]s.
:&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the Peukert constant ([[dimensionless number|dimensionless]]),

The capacity at a one-ampere discharge rate is not usually given for practical cells.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} As such, it can be useful to reformulate the law to a known capacity and discharge rate:

:&lt;math&gt;t = H \left(\frac{C}{I H}\right)^k&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the rated discharge time (in hours),
:&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the rated capacity at that discharge rate (in ampere hours),
:&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the actual discharge current (in amperes),
:&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the Peukert constant (dimensionless),
:&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the actual time to discharge the battery (in hours).

Using the above example, if the battery has a Peukert constant of 1.2 and is discharged at a rate of 10 amperes, it would be fully discharged in time &lt;math&gt;20{\left(\frac{100}{10 \cdot 20}\right)^{1.2}}&lt;/math&gt;, which is approximately 8.7 hours. It would therefore deliver only 87 ampere-hours rather than 100.

Peukert's law can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;I t = C \left(\frac{C}{I H}\right)^{k-1},&lt;/math&gt;

giving &lt;math&gt;I t&lt;/math&gt;, which is the effective capacity at the discharge rate &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.

Peukert's law, taken literally, would imply that the total charge delivered by the battery (&lt;math&gt;It&lt;/math&gt;) goes to infinity as the rate of discharge goes to zero. This is of course impossible, because the battery will still self-discharge internally with or without zero discharge through a load.  The self discharge rate depends on the chemistry and ambient temperature.

If the capacity is listed for two discharge rates, the Peukert exponent can be determined algebraically:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{Q}{Q_{0}} = \left(\frac{T}{T_{0}}\right)^{\frac{k-1}{k}}&lt;/math&gt;

Another commonly used form of the Peukert's law is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{Q}{Q_{0}} = \left(\frac{I}{I_{0}}\right)^{\alpha},&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{k-1}{2-k}&lt;/math&gt;

Several representative examples of different  α and corresponding k  are tabulated below:

Peukert's law becomes a key issue in a [[battery electric vehicle]], where batteries rated, for example, at a 20-hour discharge time are used at a much shorter discharge time of about 1 hour.
At high load currents the internal resistance of a real battery dissipates significant power, reducing the power (watts) available to the load in addition to the Peukert reduction, delivering less capacity than the simple power law equation predicts.

A 2006 critical study concluded that Peukert's equation could not be used to predict the state of charge of a battery accurately unless it is discharged at a constant current and constant temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doerffel|first1=Dennis|last2=Sharkh|first2=Suleiman Abu|title=A critical review of using the Peukert equation for determining the remaining capacity of lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries|journal=Journal of Power Sources|volume=155|issue=2|year=2006|pages=395–400|issn=0378-7753|doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.04.030|bibcode=2006JPS...155..395D}} {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of Battery Chemistry== 

Peukert's law was developed for Lead-Acid batteries, and works well in that application.  

It does not necessarily apply to other battery chemistries, especially Lithium-Ion batteries.
Lithium-Ion batteries tend to self-heat during rapid discharge, and the [[Nernst Equation]] predicts battery voltage will increase with temperature.
Thus, the effect of increased resistance is offset by the self-heating effect.
This advantage of Lithium-Ion batteries is a well-known advertised feature, see [http://www.lithiumion-batteries.com/knowledge-base.php].
In a research paper, a 50Ah lithium-ion battery tested was found to give about the same capacity at 5A and 50A; this was attributed to possible Peukert loss in capacity being countered by the increase in capacity due to the 30◦C temperature rise due to self-heating, with the conclusion that the Peukert equation is not applicable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doerffel|first1=Dennis|last2=Sharkh|first2=Suleiman Abu|title=A critical review of using the Peukert equation for determining the remaining capacity of lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries|journal=Journal of Power Sources|volume=155|issue=2|year=2006|pages=395–400|issn=0378-7753|doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.04.030|bibcode=2006JPS...155..395D}} {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Fire Safety==

Peukert's law brings a certain degree of fire-safety to many battery designs. It limits the maximum output power of the battery.
A good example of this is lead-acid batteries, which will not catch fire via excessive discharge currents.
As such, starting a car is safe even if the lead-acid battery dies.
The primary fire-danger with lead-acid batteries occurs during over-charging when hydrogen gas is produced.  This danger is easily controlled by limiting the available charge voltage, and ensuring ventilation is present during charging to vent any excess hydrogen gas. A secondary danger exists when broken plates inside the battery short out the battery, or reconnect inside the battery causing an internal spark, igniting the hydrogen and oxygen generated inside the battery during very fast discharge. 

On the other hand, Lithium-Ion batteries self-heat, do not follow Peukert's law, and have a flammable electrolyte.  The combination results in their catching fire when discharged at rapid rates.  In particular, if the cell develops an internal short, it tends to overheat, release electrolyte, and catch fire.  A fire generates additional heat, which can melt adjacent cells and result in additional leakage of the flammable electrolyte.  Additionally, a fire can also increase cell temperatures in adjacent cells, and this further increase the available fault currents (and heat).  The resultant runaway reactions can be spectacular.

'''Photovoltaics''' ('''PV''') is the conversion of light into [[electricity]] using [[semiconducting material]]s that exhibit the [[photovoltaic effect]], a phenomenon studied in [[physics]], [[photochemistry]], and [[electrochemistry]].

A  [[photovoltaic system]] employs [[solar panel]]s, each comprising a number of [[solar cell]]s, which generate electrical power.  PV installations may be ground-mounted, [[Rooftop photovoltaic power station|rooftop]] mounted or wall mounted.  The mount may be fixed, or use a [[solar tracker]] to follow the sun across the sky.

Solar PV has specific advantages as an energy source: once installed, its operation generates no pollution and no [[greenhouse gas emissions]], it shows simple scalability in respect of power needs and silicon has large availability in the Earth’s crust.&lt;ref name=Mayumi2017&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Samuele |last1=Lo Piano |first2= Kozo |last2=Mayumi  |title= Toward an integrated assessment of the performance of photovoltaic power stations for electricity generation |journal=[[Applied Energy]] |volume=186 |issue=2 |pages=167–74 |year=2017 |doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PV systems have the major disadvantage that the power output works best with direct sunlight, so about 10-25% is lost if a tracking system is not used.&lt;ref name="Solar tracker-pro&amp;con"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bushong|first1=Steven|url=http://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2016/05/advantages-disadvantages-solar-tracker-system/|title=Advantages and disadvantages of a solar tracker system|website=Solar Power World|accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dust, clouds, and other obstructions in the atmosphere also diminish the power output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energymatters.com.au/residential-solar/home-solar-faqs/|title=Grid connect solar power FAQ - Energy Matters|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scool.larc.nasa.gov/lesson_plans/CloudCoverSolarRadiation.pdf|format=PDF|title=Cloud Cover and Solar Radiation |website=Scool.larc.nasa.gov|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important issue is the concentration of the production in the hours corresponding to main insolation, which do not usually match the peaks in demand in human activity cycles.&lt;ref name=Mayumi2017/&gt; Unless current societal patterns of consumption and electrical networks adjust to this scenario, electricity still needs to be stored for later use or made up by other power sources, usually hydrocarbons.

Photovoltaic systems have long been used in specialized applications, and stand-alone and [[grid-connected PV system]]s have been in use since the 1990s.&lt;ref name=reconsidering /&gt; They were first mass-produced in 2000, when German environmentalists and the [[Eurosolar]] organization got government funding for a ten thousand roof program.&lt;ref name="Solar Power for the World: What You Wanted to Know about Photovoltaics"&gt;{{cite book|author=Palz, Wolfgang |title=Solar Power for the World: What You Wanted to Know about Photovoltaics|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=qGXvAgAAQBAJ|page=131}} |date= 2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-981-4411-87-5|pages=131–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The term "photovoltaic" comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] φῶς (''phōs'') meaning "light", and from "volt", the unit of electro-motive force, the [[volt]], which in turn comes from the last name of the [[Italian people|Italian]] physicist [[Alessandro Volta]], inventor of the battery ([[electrochemical cell]]). The term "photo-voltaic" has been in use in English since 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Elements of electro-biology,: or the voltaic mechanism of man; of electro-pathology, especially of the nervous system; and of electro-therapeutics|author = Smee, Alfred |publisher = London: Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans|page=15|year = 1849|url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=CU0EAAAAQAAJ|page=15}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar cells produce direct current electricity from sunlight which can be used to power equipment or to [[Rechargeable battery|recharge a battery]]. The first practical application of photovoltaics was to power orbiting satellites and other [[spacecraft]], but today the majority of [[photovoltaic module]]s are used for grid connected power generation. In this case an [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]] is required to convert the DC to AC. There is a smaller market for off-grid power for remote dwellings, [[electric boat|boats]], [[recreational vehicle]]s, electric cars, roadside emergency telephones, [[remote sensing]], and [[cathodic protection]] of [[pipeline transport|pipelines]].

Solar photovoltaic power generation has long been seen as a [[clean energy]] technology which draws upon the planet’s most plentiful and widely distributed renewable energy source – the sun.  Cells require protection from the environment and are usually packaged tightly in solar panels.

Photovoltaic power capacity is measured as maximum power output under standardized test conditions (STC) in "W&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;" ([[Watt-peak|watts peak]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Handbook of Photovoltaic Science and Engineering |author1=Luque, Antonio  |author2=Hegedus, Steven  |lastauthoramp=yes | url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=u-bCMhl_JjQC|page=326}} | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-471-49196-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual power output at a particular point in time may be less than or greater than this standardized, or "rated", value, depending on geographical location, time of day, weather conditions, and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gisatnrel.nrel.gov/PVWatts_Viewer/index.html The PVWatts Solar Calculator] Retrieved on 7 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Solar photovoltaic array [[capacity factor]]s are typically under 25%, which is lower than many other industrial sources of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.remenergyco.com/why-solar-now Massachusetts: a Good Solar Market] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912040953/http://www.remenergyco.com/why-solar-now |date=12 September 2012 }}.

== Current developments ==

For best performance, terrestrial PV systems aim to maximize the time they face the sun. [[Solar tracker]]s achieve this by moving PV panels to follow the sun. The increase can be by as much as 20% in winter and by as much as 50% in summer. Static mounted systems can be optimized by analysis of the [[sun path]]. Panels are often set to latitude tilt, an angle equal to the latitude, but performance can be improved by adjusting the angle for summer or winter. Generally, as with other semiconductor devices, temperatures above room temperature reduce the performance of photovoltaics.&lt;ref&gt;Vick, B.D., Clark, R.N. (2005). [http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/Publications.htm?seq_no_115=182692 Effect of panel temperature on a Solar-PV AC water pumping system], pp. 159–164 in: Proceedings of the International Solar Energy Society (ISES) 2005 Solar Water Congress: Bringing water to the World, 8–12 August 2005, Orlando, Florida.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of solar panels may also be mounted vertically above each other in a tower, if the [[zenith distance]] of the [[Sun]] is greater than zero, and the tower can be turned horizontally as a whole and each panels additionally around a horizontal axis. In such a tower the panels can follow the Sun exactly. Such a device may be described as a [[Turntable ladder#Turntable ladder|ladder]] mounted on a turnable disk. Each step of that ladder is the middle axis of a rectangular [[solar panel]]. In case the zenith distance of the Sun reaches zero, the "ladder" may be rotated to the north or the south to avoid a solar panel producing a shadow on a lower solar panel. Instead of an exactly vertical tower one can choose a tower with an axis directed to the [[polar star]], meaning that it is parallel to the rotation axis of the [[Earth]]. In this case the angle between the axis and the Sun is always larger than 66 degrees. During a day it is only necessary to turn the panels around this axis to follow the Sun. Installations may be ground-mounted (and sometimes integrated with farming and grazing)&lt;ref name="huliq.com"&gt;[http://www.huliq.com/18313/ge-invests-delivers-one-of-worlds-largest-solar-power-plants GE Invests, Delivers One of World's Largest Solar Power Plants]. Huliq.com (12 April 2007). Retrieved on 3 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or built into the roof or walls of a building ([[building-integrated photovoltaics]]).

Another recent development involves the makeup of solar cells. [[Perovskite]] is a very inexpensive material which is being used to replace the expensive [[crystalline silicon]] which is still part of a standard PV cell build to this day. Michael Graetzel, Director of the Laboratory of Photonics and Interfaces at EPFL says, "Today, efficiency has peaked at 18 percent, but it's expected to get even higher in the future."&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/18/tech/innovation/solar-cells-of-the-future/ Current Developments in Solar Technologies]. cnn.com (17 December 2014). Retrieved on 1 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a significant claim, as 20% efficiency is typical among solar panels which use more expensive materials.

=== Efficiency ===
{{Main|Solar cell efficiency}}
[[File:Best Research-Cell Efficiencies.png|thumb|280px|Best Research-Cell Efficiencies]]

Electrical efficiency (also called conversion efficiency) is a contributing factor in the selection of a photovoltaic system. However, the most efficient solar panels are typically the most expensive, and may not be commercially available. Therefore, selection is also driven by cost efficiency and other factors.

The electrical efficiency of a PV cell is a [[physical property]] which represents how much electrical power a cell can produce for a given [[Solar irradiance|insolation]]. The basic expression for maximum efficiency of a photovoltaic cell is given by the ratio of output power to the incident solar power (radiation flux times area)

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac{P_{max}}{E \cdot A_{cell}}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pvpower.com/assets/Measuring-PV-Efficiency-Solar-Panels.pdf Measuring PV Efficiency]. pvpower.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The efficiency is measured under ideal laboratory conditions and represents the maximum achievable efficiency of the PV material. Actual efficiency is influenced by the output Voltage, current, junction temperature, light intensity and spectrum.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The most efficient type of solar cell to date is a multi-junction concentrator solar cell with an efficiency of 46.0%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frank|first1=Dimroth|title=New world record for solar cell efficiency at 46% French-German cooperation confirms competitive advantage of European photovoltaic industry|url=https://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/press-and-media/press-releases/press-releases-2014/new-world-record-for-solar-cell-efficiency-at-46-percent|publisher=Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced by [[Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE|Fraunhofer ISE]] in December 2014. The highest efficiencies achieved without concentration include a material by [[Sharp Corporation]] at 35.8% using a proprietary triple-junction manufacturing technology in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news175452895.html Sharp Develops Solar Cell with World's Highest Conversion Efficiency of 35.8%]. Physorg.com. 22 October 2009. Retrieved on 3 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and Boeing Spectrolab (40.7% also using a triple-layer design). The US company [[SunPower]] produces cells that have an efficiency of 21.5%, well above the market average of 12–18%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.sunpower.com/sites/sunpower/files/media-library/data-sheets/ds-x21-series-335-345-residential-solar-panels-datasheet.pdf|title=SunPower TM X-Series Data Sheet|date=April 2013|publisher=[[SunPower]]|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an ongoing effort to increase the conversion efficiency of PV cells and modules, primarily for competitive advantage. In order to increase the efficiency of solar cells, it is important to choose a semiconductor material with an appropriate [[band gap]] that matches the solar spectrum. This will enhance the electrical and optical properties. Improving the method of charge collection is also useful for increasing the efficiency. There are several groups of materials that are being developed. Ultrahigh-efficiency devices (&amp;eta;&gt;30%)&lt;ref&gt;Deb, Satyen K. (May 2000) [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy00osti/28060.pdf Recent Developments in High Efficiency PV cells]. nrel.gov&lt;/ref&gt; are made by using GaAs and GaInP2 semiconductors with multijunction tandem cells. High-quality, single-crystal silicon materials are used to achieve high-efficiency, low cost cells (&amp;eta;&gt;20%).

Recent developments in Organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) have made significant advancements in power conversion efficiency from 3% to over 15% since their introduction in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3390/polym6092473| title = Towards High Performance Organic Photovoltaic Cells: A Review of Recent Development in Organic Photovoltaics| journal = Polymers| volume = 6| issue = 9| pages = 2473–2509| year = 2014| last1 = Yu | first1 = J. | last2 = Zheng | first2 = Y. | last3 = Huang | first3 = J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the highest reported power conversion efficiency ranges from 6.7% to 8.94% for small molecule, 8.4%–10.6% for polymer OPVs, and 7% to 21% for perovskite OPVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nmat3160| pmid = 22057387| title = Solution-processed small-molecule solar cells with 6.7% efficiency| journal = Nature Materials| volume = 11| issue = 1| pages = 44–8| year = 2011| last1 = Sun | first1 = Y. | last2 = Welch | first2 = G.

Recent improvements have increased the efficiency and lowered cost, while remaining environmentally-benign and renewable.

Several companies have begun embedding [[power optimizer]]s into PV modules called [[smart module]]s. These modules perform [[maximum power point tracking]] (MPPT) for each module individually, measure performance data for monitoring, and provide additional safety features. Such modules can also compensate for shading effects, wherein a shadow falling across a section of a module causes the electrical output of one or more strings of cells in the module to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;St. John, Jeff (23 August 2012) [http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-electronics-panel-integration-and-the-bankability-challenge Solar Electronics, Panel Integration and the Bankability Challenge]. greentechmedia.com&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major causes for the decreased performance of cells is overheating. The efficiency of a solar cell declines by about 0.5% for every 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature. This means that a 100 degree increase in surface temperature could decrease the efficiency of a solar cell by about half. Self-cooling solar cells are one solution to this problem. Rather than using energy to cool the surface, pyramid and cone shapes can be formed from [[silica]], and attached to the surface of a solar panel. Doing so allows visible light to reach the [[solar cell]]s, but reflects [[infrared]] rays (which carry heat).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/18/tech/innovation/solar-cells-of-the-future/ Self-cooling Solar Cells].

The costs of power from wind and solar are already below those of conventional electricity generation in some parts of the world, as they have fallen sharply and will continue to do so. He also asserts, that the electrical grid has been greatly expanded worldwide, and is ready to receive and distribute electricity from renewable sources. In addition, worldwide electricity prices came under strong pressure from renewable energy sources, that are, in part, enthusiastically embraced by consumers.&lt;ref name=bloomberg-leibreich-2014&gt;{{cite web|last1=Liebreich|first1=Michael|title=A YEAR OF CRACKING ICE: 10 PREDICTIONS FOR 2014|url=http://about.bnef.com/blog/liebreich-a-year-of-cracking-ice-10-predictions-for-2014/|publisher=Bloomberg New Energy Finance|accessdate=24 April 2014|date=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While solar photovoltaic (PV) cells are promising for clean energy production, their deployment is hindered by production costs, material availability, and toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://environmentalprogress.org/big-news/2017/6/21/are-we-headed-for-a-solar-waste-crisis|title=Are we headed for a solar waste crisis?|website=Environmentalprogress.org|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data required to investigate their impact are sometimes affected by a rather large amount of uncertainty. The values of human labor and water consumption, for example, are not precisely assessed due to the lack of systematic and accurate analyses in the scientific literature.&lt;ref name=Mayumi2017/&gt;

[[Life-cycle assessment|Life cycle assessment]] (LCA) is one method of determining environmental impacts from PV. Many studies have been done on the various types of PV including [[First generation solar cell|first generation]], second generation, and [[Third Generation Solar Cell|third generation]]. Usually these PV LCA studies select a cradle to gate system boundary because often at the time the studies are conducted, it is a new technology not commercially available yet and their required balance of system components and disposal methods are unknown.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Collier, J., Wu, S. &amp; Apul, D.|title= Life cycle environmental impacts from CZTS (copper zinc tin sulfide) and Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (zinc phosphide) thin film PV (photovoltaic) cells|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2014.06.076|journal= Energy |volume=74|pages= 314–321 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A traditional LCA can look at many different impact categories ranging from [[global warming potential]], eco-toxicity, human toxicity, water depletion, and many others.

Most LCAs of PV have focused on two categories: carbon dioxide equivalents per kWh and energy pay-back time (EPBT). The  EPBT is defined as " the time needed to compensate for the total renewable- and non-renewable- primary energy required during the life cycle of a PV system".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anctil, A., Babbitt, C.

One difficulty in determining impacts due to PV is to determine if the wastes are released to the air, water, or soil during the manufacturing phase.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Research is underway to try to understand emissions and releases during the lifetime of PV systems.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fthenakis, V.

'''''Impacts from first-generation PV'''''

[[Crystalline silicon]] modules are the most extensively studied PV type in terms of LCA since they are the most commonly used. [[Mono-crystalline silicon cell|Mono-crystalline silicon]] photovoltaic systems (mono-si) have an average efficiency of 14.0%.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Solar Photovoltaics, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, 2012, 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The cells tend to follow a structure of front electrode, anti-reflection film, n-layer, p-layer, and back electrode, with the sun hitting the front electrode. EPBT ranges from 1.7 to 2.7 years.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Krebs, F. C. |title=Fabrication and processing of polymer solar cells: a review of printing and coating techniques|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2008.10.004|journal= Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells |volume=93|issue=4|pages= 394–412 |year=2009|url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/fabrication-and-processing-of-polymer-solar-cells-a-review-of-printing-and-coating-techniques(a764eafc-09e4-45e5-921c-ab99e9411ceb).html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cradle to gate of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq/kWh ranges from 37.3 to 72.2 grams.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yue, D., You, F. &amp; Darling, S.

Techniques to produce [[multi-crystalline silicon]] (multi-si) photovoltaic cells are simpler and cheaper than mono-si, however tend to make less efficient cells, an average of 13.2%.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; EPBT ranges from 1.5 to 2.6 years.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The cradle to gate of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq/kWh ranges from 28.5 to 69 grams.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Some studies have looked beyond EPBT and GWP to other environmental impacts. In one such study, conventional energy mix in Greece was compared to multi-si PV and found a 95% overall reduction in impacts including carcinogens, eco-toxicity, acidification, eutrophication, and eleven others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gaidajis, G.  |author2=Angelakoglou, K. |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1080/10286608.2012.710608 |title=Environmental performance of renewable energy systems with the application of life-cycle assessment: a multi-Si photovoltaic module case study|journal=Civil Engineering and Environmental Systems |volume=29|issue=4 |pages= 231–238 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Impacts from second generation'''''

[[Cadmium telluride photovoltaics|Cadmium telluride]] (CdTe) is one of the fastest-growing [[Thin-film solar cell|thin film based solar cells]] which are collectively known as second generation devices. This new thin film device also shares similar performance restrictions ([[Shockley–Queisser limit|Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit]]) as conventional Si devices but promises to lower the cost of each device by both reducing material and energy consumption during manufacturing. Today the global market share of CdTe is 5.4%, up from 4.7% in 2008.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This technology’s highest power conversion efficiency is 21%.&lt;ref&gt;Photovoltaics Report. (Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, ISE, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The cell structure includes glass substrate (around 2&amp;nbsp;mm), transparent conductor layer, CdS buffer layer (50–150&amp;nbsp;nm), CdTe absorber and a metal contact layer.

CdTe PV systems require less energy input in their production than other commercial PV systems per unit electricity production. The average CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq/kWh is around 18 grams (cradle to gate). CdTe has the fastest EPBT of all commercial PV technologies, which varies between 0.3 and 1.2 years.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Goe, M.  |author2=Gaustad, G.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Strengthening the case for recycling photovoltaics: An energy payback analysis|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.01.036|journal= Applied Energy |volume=120|pages= 41–48 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Copper indium gallium selenide|Copper Indium Gallium Diselenide]] (CIGS) is a thin film solar cell based on the copper indium diselenide (CIS) family of chalcopyrite [[semiconductor]]s. CIS and CIGS are often used interchangeably within the CIS/CIGS community. The cell structure includes soda lime glass as the substrate, Mo layer as the back contact, CIS/CIGS as the absorber layer, cadmium sulfide (CdS) or Zn (S,OH)x  as the buffer layer, and ZnO:Al as the front contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eisenberg, D.

Materials necessary for assembly are readily available, and are less costly per watt of solar cell. CIGS based solar devices resist performance degradation over time and are highly stable in the field.

Reported global warming potential impacts of CIGS range from 20.5 – 58.8 grams CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq/kWh of electricity generated for different [[solar irradiation]] (1,700 to 2,200 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/y) and power conversion efficiency (7.8 – 9.12%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1530-9290.2011.00423.x|author=Kim, H.

'''''Impacts from third generation'''''

Third-generation PVs are designed to combine the advantages of both the first and second generation devices and they do not have [[Shockley-Queisser limit]], a theoretical limit for first and second generation PV cells. The thickness of a third generation device is less than 1&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Brown, G.

One emerging alternative and promising technology is based on an organic-inorganic hybrid solar cell made of methylammonium lead halide perovskites. [[Perovskite solar cell|Perovskite PV cells]] have progressed rapidly over the past few years and have become one of the most attractive areas for PV research.&lt;ref name="Celik et al 2016"/&gt; The cell structure includes a metal back contact (which can be made of Al, Au or Ag), a hole transfer layer (spiro-MeOTAD, P3HT, PTAA, CuSCN, CuI, or NiO), and absorber layer (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PbIxBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-x, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PbIxCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-x or CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), an electron transport layer (TiO, ZnO, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and a top contact layer (fluorine doped tin oxide or tin doped indium oxide).

There are a limited number of published studies to address the environmental impacts of perovskite solar cells.&lt;ref name="Celik et al 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Espinosa, N., Serrano-Luján, L., Urbina, A. &amp; Krebs, F.

Due to the instability of perovskite cells lead may eventually be exposed to fresh water during the use phase. These LCA  studies looked at human and ecotoxicity of perovskite solar cells and found they were  surprisingly low and may not be an environmental issue.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  Global warming potential of perovskite PVs were found to be in the range of 24–1500 grams CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq/kWh electricity production. Similarly, reported EPBT of the published paper range from 0.2 to 15 years. The large range of reported values highlight the uncertainties associated with these studies. Celik et al.

Two new promising thin film technologies are [[copper zinc tin sulfide]] (Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnSnS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or CZTS),&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[zinc phosphide]] (Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and single-walled carbon nano-tubes (SWCNT).&lt;ref name="Celik, I. 2017"&gt;Celik, I., Mason, B.

However, even with the same short lifetime, the 28% cell had lower environmental impacts than mono-Si.

[[Organic solar cell|Organic]] and [[Polymer solar cell|polymer photovoltaic]] (OPV) are a relatively new area of research. The tradition OPV cell structure layers consist of a semi-transparent electrode, electron blocking layer, tunnel junction, holes blocking layer, electrode, with the sun hitting the transparent electrode. OPV replaces silver with carbon as an electrode material lowering manufacturing cost and making them more environmentally friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/aenm.201400732|title=Carbon: The Ultimate Electrode Choice for Widely Distributed Polymer Solar Cells|journal=Advanced Energy Materials|volume=4|issue=15|pages=n/a|year=2014|last1=Dos Reis Benatto|first1=Gisele A.|last2=Roth|first2=Bérenger|last3=Madsen|first3=Morten V.|last4=Hösel|first4=Markus|last5=Søndergaard|first5=Roar R.|last6=Jørgensen|first6=Mikkel|last7=Krebs|first7=Frederik C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; OPV are flexible, low weight, and work well with roll-to roll manufacturing for mass production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3390/electronics3010132 |title=Electron and Hole Transport Layers: Their Use in Inverted Bulk Heterojunction Polymer Solar Cells |journal=Electronics |volume=3 |pages=132–164 |year=2014 |last1=Lattante |first1=Sandro }}&lt;/ref&gt; OPV uses "only abundant elements coupled to an extremely low embodied energy through very low processing temperatures using only ambient processing conditions on simple printing equipment enabling energy pay-back times".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2013.05.032|title=Polymer and organic solar cells viewed as thin film technologies: What it will take for them to become a success outside academia|journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|volume=119|pages=73–76|year=2013|last1=Krebs|first1=Frederik C.|last2=Jørgensen|first2=Mikkel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current efficiencies range from 1–6.5%,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2010.08.020|title=A life cycle analysis of polymer solar cell modules prepared using roll-to-roll methods under ambient conditions|journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|volume=95|issue=5|pages=1293–1302|year=2011|last1=Espinosa|first1=Nieves|last2=García-Valverde|first2=Rafael|last3=Urbina|first3=Antonio|last4=Krebs|first4=Frederik C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; however theoretical analyses show promise beyond 10% efficiency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There have been major changes in the underlying costs, industry structure and market prices of solar photovoltaics technology, over the years, and gaining a coherent picture of the shifts occurring across the industry value chain globally is a challenge. This is due to: "the rapidity of cost and price changes, the complexity of the PV supply chain, which involves a large number of manufacturing processes, the balance of system (BOS) and installation costs associated with complete PV systems, the choice of different distribution channels, and differences between regional markets within which PV is being deployed". Further complexities result from the many different policy support initiatives that have been put in place to facilitate photovoltaics commercialisation in various countries.&lt;ref name=reconsidering /&gt;

The PV industry has seen dramatic drops in module prices since 2008. In late 2011, factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules dropped below the $1.00/W mark. The $1.00/W installed cost, is often regarded in the PV industry as marking the achievement of [[grid parity]] for PV. Technological advancements, manufacturing process improvements, and industry re-structuring, mean that further price reductions are likely in coming years.&lt;ref name=reconsidering&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.renene.2012.11.029|url=http://az2112.com/assets/energy-bnef_re_considering_the_economics_of_photovoltaic_power_a_co_authored_white.pdf| title = Re-considering the economics of photovoltaic power| journal = Renewable Energy| volume = 53| pages = 329–338| year = 2013| last1 = Bazilian | first1 = M. | last2 = Onyeji | first2 = I. | last3 = Liebreich | first3 = M. | last4 = MacGill | first4 = I. | last5 = Chase | first5 = J. | last6 = Shah | first6 = J. | last7 = Gielen | first7 = D. | last8 = Arent | first8 = D. | last9 = Landfear | first9 = D. | last10 = Zhengrong | first10 = S. |citeseerx=10.1.1.692.1880}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017 power-purchase agreement prices for solar farms below $0.05/kWh are common in the United States and the lowest bids in several international countries were about $0.03/kWh.&lt;ref name="Haegel 2017"&gt;{{cite journal  | author = Nancy M.

[[Financial incentives for photovoltaics]], such as [[feed-in tariff]]s, have often been offered to electricity consumers to install and operate solar-electric generating systems. Government has sometimes also offered incentives in order to encourage the PV industry to achieve the [[economies of scale]] needed to compete where the cost of PV-generated electricity is above the cost from the existing grid. Such policies are implemented to promote national or territorial [[energy security|energy independence]], [[high tech]] job creation and reduction of [[carbon emissions|carbon dioxide emissions]] which cause climate change. Due to economies of scale solar panels get less costly as people use and buy more—as manufacturers increase production to meet demand, the cost and price is expected to drop in the years to come.

However, such concentrated solar power requires sophisticated heat sink designs, otherwise the photovoltaic cell overheats, which reduces its efficiency and life. To further exacerbate the concentrated cooling design, the heat sink must be passive, otherwise the power required for active cooling would reduce the overall efficiency and economy.

As of 2011, the cost of PV has fallen well below that of nuclear power and is set to fall further. The average retail price of solar cells as monitored by the Solarbuzz group fell from $3.50/watt to $2.43/watt over the course of 2011.&lt;ref name=natint /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;For large-scale installations, prices below $1.00/watt were achieved.

In many locations, PV has reached grid parity, which is usually defined as PV production costs at or below retail electricity prices (though often still above the power station prices for coal or gas-fired generation without their distribution and other costs). However, in many countries there is still a need for more access to capital to develop PV projects. To solve this problem [[securitization]] has been proposed and used to accelerate development of solar photovoltaic projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2013.12.045| title = Securitization of residential solar photovoltaic assets: Costs, risks and uncertainty| journal = Energy Policy| volume = 67| pages = 488–498| year = 2014| last1 = Alafita | first1 = T.| last2 = Pearce | first2 = J.

Photovoltaic power is also generated during a time of day that is close to peak demand (precedes it) in electricity systems with high use of air conditioning. More generally, it is now evident that, given a carbon price of $50/ton, which would raise the price of coal-fired power by 5c/kWh, solar PV will be cost-competitive in most locations. The declining price of PV has been reflected in rapidly growing installations, totaling about 23&amp;nbsp;GW in 2011. Although some consolidation is likely in 2012, due to support cuts in the large markets of Germany and Italy, strong growth seems likely to continue for the rest of the decade. Already, by one estimate, total investment in renewables for 2011 exceeded investment in carbon-based electricity generation.&lt;ref name=natint&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/the-end-the-nuclear-renaissance-6325?page=1 |title=The End of the Nuclear Renaissance|author=Quiggin, John|date=3 January 2012|website=National Interest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of self consumption payback time is calculated based on how much electricity is not brought from the grid. Additionally, using PV solar power to charge DC batteries, as used in Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles and Electric Vehicles, leads to greater efficiencies. Traditionally, DC generated electricity from solar PV must be converted to AC for buildings, at an average 10% loss during the conversion. An additional efficiency loss occurs in the transition back to DC for battery driven devices and vehicles, and using various interest rates and energy price changes were calculated to find present values that range from $2,057 to $8,213 (analysis from 2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verdel3c.com/blog/converting-solar-energy-phev-battery/ Converting Solar Energy into the PHEV Battery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222163522/http://www.verdel3c.com/blog/converting-solar-energy-phev-battery/ |date=22 February 2014 }}.

== Manufacturing ==
{{see also|List of photovoltaics companies}}
Overall the
manufacturing process of creating solar photovoltaics is simple in that it does
not require the culmination of many complex or moving parts. Because of the
solid state nature of PV systems they often have relatively long lifetimes,
anywhere from 10 to 30 years. To increase electrical output of a PV
system, the manufacturer must simply add more photovoltaic components and
because of this economies of scale are important for manufacturers as costs
decrease with increasing output.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = U.S. Solar Photovoltaic Manufacturing: Industry Trends, Global Competition, Federal Support|last = Platzer|first = Michael|date = January 27, 2015|journal = Congressional Research Service|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are many types of PV systems known to be effective, crystalline silicon PV accounted for around 90% of the worldwide production of PV in 2013. Manufacturing silicon PV systems has several steps. First, polysilicon is processed from mined quartz until it is very pure (semi-conductor grade). This is melted down when small amounts of [[boron]], a group III element, are added to make a p-type semiconductor rich in electron holes. Typically using a seed crystal, an ingot of this solution is grown from the liquid polycrystalline. The ingot may also be cast in a mold. Wafers of this semiconductor material are cut from the bulk material with wire saws, and then go through surface etching before being cleaned. Next, the wafers are placed into a phosphorus vapor deposition furnace which lays a very thin layer of phosphorus, a group V element, which creates an n-type semiconducting surface. To reduce energy losses, an anti-reflective coating is added to the surface, along with electrical contacts. After finishing the cell, cells are connected via electrical circuit according to the specific application and prepared for shipping and installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = How PV Cells Are Made|url = http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/consumer/solar_electricity/basics/how_cells_made.htm|website = www.fsec.ucf.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystalline silicon photovoltaics are only one type of PV, and while they represent the majority of solar cells produced currently there are many new and promising technologies that have the potential to be scaled up to meet future energy needs. As of 2018, crystalline silicon cell technology serves as the basis for several PV module types, including monocrystalline, multicrystalline, mono PERC, and bifacial. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Solar PV Modules |url = https://www.targray.com/solar/pv-modules|website = www.targray.com|accessdate = 2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another newer technology, thin-film PV, are manufactured by depositing semiconducting layers on substrate in vacuum. The substrate is often glass or stainless-steel, and these semiconducting layers are made of many types of materials including cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium diselenide (CIS), copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS), and amorphous silicon (a-Si). After being deposited onto the substrate the semiconducting layers are separated and connected by electrical circuit by laser-scribing. Thin-film photovoltaics now make up around 20% of the overall production of PV because of the reduced materials requirements and cost to manufacture modules consisting of thin-films as compared to silicon-based wafers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Thin Film Photovoltaics|url = http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/consumer/solar_electricity/basics/thin-film.htm|website = www.fsec.ucf.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other emerging PV technologies include organic, dye-sensitized, quantum-dot, and Perovskite photovoltaics. OPVs fall into the thin-film category of manufacturing, and typically operate around the 12% efficiency range which is lower than the 12–21% typically seen by silicon based PVs. Because organic photovoltaics require very high purity and are relatively reactive they must be encapsulated which vastly increases cost of manufacturing and meaning that they are not feasible for large scale up. Dye-sensitized PVs are similar in efficiency to OPVs but are significantly easier to manufacture. However these dye-sensitized photovoltaics present storage problems because the liquid electrolyte is toxic and can potentially permeate the plastics used in the cell. Quantum dot solar cells are quantum dot sensitized DSSCs and are solution processed meaning they are potentially scalable, but currently they peak at 12% efficiency. Perovskite solar cells are a very efficient solar energy converter and have excellent optoelectric properties for photovoltaic purposes, but they are expensive and difficult to manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;Secor, Ethan.

=== Photovoltaic systems ===
{{Main|Photovoltaic system}}

A photovoltaic system, or solar PV system is a power system designed to supply usable solar power by means of photovoltaics. It consists of an arrangement of several components, including solar panels to absorb and directly convert sunlight into electricity, a solar inverter to change the electric current from DC to AC, as well as mounting, cabling and other electrical accessories. PV systems range from small, [[rooftop photovoltaic power station|roof-top mounted]] or [[building-integrated photovoltaics|building-integrated]] systems with capacities from a few to several tens of [[kilowatts]], to large utility-scale [[photovoltaic power station|power stations]] of hundreds of [[megawatts]]. Nowadays, most PV systems are [[grid-connected photovoltaic power system|grid-connected]], while [[Stand-alone power system|stand-alone]] systems only account for a small portion of the market.

*;Rooftop and building integrated systems
[[File:SolarFachwerkhaus.jpg|thumb|Rooftop PV on half-timbered house]]

: Photovoltaic arrays are often associated with buildings: either integrated into them, mounted on them or mounted nearby on the ground. [[Rooftop PV system]]s are most often retrofitted into existing buildings, usually mounted on top of the existing roof structure or on the existing walls. Alternatively, an array can be located separately from the building but connected by cable to supply power for the building. [[Building-integrated photovoltaics]] (BIPV) are increasingly incorporated into the roof or walls of new domestic and industrial buildings as a principal or ancillary source of electrical power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buildingsolar.com/technology.asp Building Integrated Photovoltaics], Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, accessed: 23 March 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202193559/http://www.buildingsolar.com/technology.asp |date=2 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roof tiles with integrated PV cells are sometimes used as well.

*;Concentrator photovoltaics

: [[Concentrator photovoltaics]] (CPV) is a photovoltaic technology that contrary to conventional flat-plate PV systems uses lenses and curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto small, but highly efficient, [[multi-junction]] (MJ) solar cells. In addition, CPV systems often use [[solar tracker]]s and sometimes a cooling system to further increase their efficiency. Ongoing research and development is rapidly improving their competitiveness in the utility-scale segment and in areas of high solar [[insolation]].

*;Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector

: [[Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector]] (PVT) are systems that convert solar radiation into [[Internal energy|thermal]] and electrical energy. These systems combine a solar PV cell, which converts sunlight into electricity, with a [[solar thermal collector]], which captures the remaining energy and removes waste heat from the PV module. The capture of both electricity and heat allow these devices to have higher [[exergy]] and thus be more overall energy efficient than solar PV or solar thermal alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2013.08.026| title = Spectral beam splitting for efficient conversion of solar energy—A review| journal = Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews| volume = 28| pages = 654–663| year = 2013| last1 = Mojiri | first1 = A. | last2 = Taylor | first2 = R. | last3 = Thomsen | first3 = E. | last4 = Rosengarten | first4 = G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.01.041| title = Optimizing limited solar roof access by exergy analysis of solar thermal, photovoltaic, and hybrid photovoltaic thermal systems| journal = Applied Energy| volume = 120| pages = 115–124| year = 2014| last1 = Pathak | first1 = M.

Many solar farms around the world are integrated with agriculture and some use innovative solar tracking systems that follow the sun's daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than conventional fixed-mounted systems. There are no fuel costs or emissions during operation of the power stations.

: Until a decade or so ago, PV was used frequently to power calculators and novelty devices. Improvements in integrated circuits and low power [[liquid crystal display]]s make it possible to power such devices for several years between battery changes, making PV use less common.

*;Floatovoltaics

: In May 2008, the Far Niente Winery in Oakville, CA pioneered the world's first "floatovoltaic" system by installing 994 photovoltaic solar panels onto 130 pontoons and floating them on the winery's irrigation pond. The floating system generates about 477&amp;nbsp;kW of peak output and when combined with an array of cells located adjacent to the pond is able to fully offset the winery's electricity consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Winery-goes-solar-with-Floatovoltaics-3282171.php Winery goes solar with 'Floatovoltaics']. SFGate (29 May 2008). Retrieved on 31 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary benefit of a floatovoltaic system is that it avoids the need to sacrifice valuable land area that could be used for another purpose. In the case of the Far Niente Winery, the floating system saved three-quarters of an acre that would have been required for a land-based system. That land area can instead be used for agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farniente.com/assets/files/pdfs/Floatovoltaic.pdf NAPA VALLEY’S FAR NIENTE WINERY INTRODUCES FIRST-EVER "FLOATOVOLTAIC" SOLAR ARRAY] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316135710/http://farniente.com/assets/files/pdfs/Floatovoltaic.pdf |date=16 March 2015 }}. farniente.com&lt;/ref&gt; Another benefit of a floatovoltaic system is that the panels are kept at a lower temperature than they would be on land, leading to a higher efficiency of solar energy conversion. The floating panels also reduce the amount of water lost through evaporation and inhibit the growth of algae.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampentland/2011/08/15/napa-winery-pioneers-solar-floatovoltaics/ Napa Winery Pioneers Solar Floatovoltaics].

*;Telecommunication and signaling

: Solar PV power is ideally suited for telecommunication applications such as local telephone exchange, radio and TV broadcasting, microwave and other forms of electronic communication links. This is because, in most telecommunication application, storage batteries are already in use and the electrical system is basically DC. In hilly and mountainous terrain, radio and TV signals may not reach as they get blocked or reflected back due to undulating terrain. At these locations, [[Low-power broadcasting|low power transmitters (LPT)]] are installed to receive and retransmit the signal for local population.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, B. H.

*;Spacecraft applications
[[File:Illumination test on one of Juno's solar panels.jpg|thumb|Part of [[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]]'s solar array]]

: [[Solar panels on spacecraft]] are usually the sole source of power to run the sensors, active heating and cooling, and communications.  A battery stores this energy for use when the solar panels are in shadow.  In some, the power is also used for [[spacecraft propulsion]]—[[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]].&lt;ref name="NASA11"&gt;NASA JPL Publication: [http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf11-4.html#propulsion Basics of Space Flight] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208093125/http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf11-4.html |date=8 December 2006 }}, Chapter 11.

Compared to fossil and nuclear energy sources, very little research money has been invested in the development of solar cells, so there is considerable room for improvement. Nevertheless, experimental [[high efficiency solar cells]] already have efficiencies of over 40% in case of concentrating photovoltaic cells&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyfocus.com/view/753/fraunhofer-41-1-efficiency-multi-junction-solar-cells/ Fraunhofer: 41.1% efficiency multi-junction solar cells]. renewableenergyfocus.com (28 January 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; and efficiencies are rapidly rising while mass-production costs are rapidly falling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://solarcellsinfo.com/blog/archives/1018 Study Sees Solar Cost-Competitive In Europe By 2015].

In some states of the United States, much of the investment in a home-mounted system may be lost if the home-owner moves and the buyer puts less value on the system than the seller. The city of [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] developed an innovative financing method to remove this limitation, by adding a tax assessment that is transferred with the home to pay for the solar panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There is evidence, at least in California, that the presence of a home-mounted solar system can actually increase the value of a home. According to a paper published in April 2011 by the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory titled An Analysis of the Effects of Residential Photovoltaic Energy Systems on Home Sales Prices in California:

{{quote|The research finds strong evidence that homes with PV systems in California have sold for a premium over comparable homes without PV systems. More specifically, estimates for average PV premiums range from approximately $3.9 to $6.4 per installed watt (DC) among a large number of different model specifications, with most models coalescing near $5.5/watt. That value corresponds to a premium of approximately $17,000 for a relatively new 3,100 watt PV system (the average size of PV systems in the study).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://eetd.lbl.gov/ea/ems/reports/lbnl-4476e.pdf |title=An Analysis of the Effects of Residential Photovoltaic Energy Systems on Home Sales Prices in California |website=Berkeley National Laboratory|author1=Hoen, Ben |author2=Wiser, Ryan |author3=Cappers, Peter |author4=Thayer, Mark  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Limitations==

*;Pollution and Energy in Production 
PV has been a well-known method of generating clean, emission free electricity. PV systems are often made of PV modules and inverter (changing DC to AC). PV modules are mainly made of PV cells, which has no fundamental difference to the material for making computer chips. The process of producing PV cells (computer chips) is energy intensive and involves highly poisonous and environmental toxic chemicals. There are few PV manufacturing plants around the world producing PV modules with energy produced from PV. This measure greatly reduces the carbon footprint during the manufacturing process. Managing the chemicals used in the manufacturing process is subject to the factories' local laws and regulations.

*; Impact on Electricity Network
With the increasing levels of rooftop photovoltaic systems, the energy flow becomes 2-way. When there is more local generation than consumption, electricity is exported to the grid. However, electricity network traditionally is not designed to deal with the 2- way energy transfer. Therefore, some technical issues may occur. For example, in Queensland Australia, there have been more than 30% of households with rooftop PV by the end of 2017. The famous Californian 2020 duck curve appears very often for a lot of communities from 2015 onwards. An over-voltage issue may come out as the electricity flows from these PV households back to the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3390/su10041224 |title=Power Quality and Rooftop-Photovoltaic Households: An Examination of Measured Data at Point of Customer Connection |journal=Sustainability |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=1224 |year=2018 |last1=Miller |first1=Wendy |last2=Liu |first2=Aaron |last3=Amin |first3=Zakaria |last4=Wagner |first4=Andreas }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are solutions to manage the over voltage issue, such as regulating PV inverter power factor, new voltage and energy control equipment at electricity distributor level, re-conductor the electricity wires, demand side management, etc. There are often limitations and costs related to these solutions.

*; Implication onto Electricity Bill Management and Energy Investment
There is no silver bullet in electricity or energy demand and bill management, because customers (sites) have different specific situations, e.g. different comfort/convenience needs, different electricity tariffs, or different usage patterns. Electricity tariff may have a few elements, such as daily access and metering charge, energy charge (based on kWh, MWh) or peak demand charge (e.g. a price for the highest 30min energy consumption in a month). PV is a promising option for reducing energy charge when electricity price is reasonably high and continuously increasing, such as in Australia and Germany. However, for sites with peak demand charge in place, PV may be less attractive if peak demands mostly occur in the late afternoon to early evening, for example residential communities. Overall, energy investment is largely an economical decision and it is better to make investment decisions based on systematical evaluation of options in operational improvement, energy efficiency, onsite generation and energy storage.&lt;ref&gt;L.

'''Silicon''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Si''' and [[atomic number]] 14. It is a hard and brittle crystalline solid with a blue-grey metallic lustre; and it is a [[Tetravalence|tetravalent]] [[metalloid]] and [[semiconductor]]. It is a member of [[carbon group|group 14]] in the periodic table: [[carbon]] is above it; and [[germanium]], [[tin]], and [[lead]] are below it. It is relatively unreactive. Because of its large chemical affinity for oxygen, it was not until 1823 that [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] was first able to prepare it and characterize it in pure form. &lt;!--In 1808, it was given the name ''silicium'' (from {{lang-la|silex}}, hard stone or [[flint]]), with an '''-ium''' word-ending to suggest a [[metal]], a name which the element retains in several languages. The present [[English language|English]] name was first suggested in 1817 to conform with the physically similar elements carbon and [[boron]]. Despite these physical similarities to carbon, however, the chemistry of silicon shows great differences from that of carbon, with silicon oxides being more important than [[polysilane]] compounds, the reverse of the situation for carbon.--&gt; Its melting and boiling points of 1414&amp;nbsp;°C and 3265&amp;nbsp;°C respectively are the second-highest among all the metalloids and nonmetals, being only surpassed by [[boron]]. Silicon is the eighth most [[Abundance of the chemical elements|common element]] in the universe by mass, but very rarely occurs as the pure element in the Earth's crust. It is most widely distributed in [[dust]]s, [[sand]]s, [[planetoids]], and [[planet]]s as various forms of [[silicon dioxide]] (silica) or [[silicate]]s. More than 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of [[silicate minerals]], making silicon the [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|second most abundant element]] in the Earth's crust (about 28% by mass) after [[oxygen]].

Most silicon is used commercially without being separated, and often with little processing of the natural minerals. Such use includes industrial construction with [[clays]], [[silica sand]], and [[stone]]. Silicates are used in [[Portland cement]] for [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and [[stucco]], and mixed with silica sand and [[gravel]] to make [[concrete]] for walkways, foundations, and roads. They are also used in whiteware [[ceramic]]s such as [[porcelain]], and in traditional [[quartz]]-based [[soda-lime glass]] and many other specialty [[glass]]es. Silicon compounds such as [[silicon carbide]] are used as abrasives and components of high-strength ceramics. Silicon is the basis of the widely used synthetic polymers called [[silicone]]s.

Elemental silicon also has a large impact on the modern world economy. Most free silicon is used in the [[steel]] refining, [[aluminium]]-casting, and fine chemical industries (often to make [[fumed silica]]). Even more visibly, the relatively small portion of very highly purified elemental silicon used in semiconductor electronics (&lt; 10%) is essential to [[integrated circuits]] — most computers, cell phones, and modern technology depend on it.

Silicon is an essential element in biology, although only traces are required by animals. However, various [[sea sponges]] and microorganisms, such as [[diatoms]] and [[radiolaria]], secrete skeletal structures made of silica. Silica is deposited in many plant tissues.&lt;ref name="Cutter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cutter|first=Elizabeth G.|title=Plant Anatomy.

==History==
[[File:Jöns Jacob Berzelius.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]], discoverer of silicon]]
In 1787 [[Antoine Lavoisier]] suspected that [[silica]] might be an oxide of a fundamental [[chemical element]],&lt;ref&gt;In his table of the elements, Lavoisier listed five "salifiable earths" (i.e., ores that could be made to react with acids to produce salts (''salis'' = salt, in Latin): ''chaux'' (calcium oxide), ''magnésie'' (magnesia, magnesium oxide), ''baryte'' (barium sulfate), ''alumine'' (alumina, aluminium oxide), and ''silice'' (silica, silicon dioxide). About these "elements", Lavoisier speculates: "We are probably only acquainted as yet with a part of the metallic substances existing in nature, as all those which have a stronger affinity to oxygen than carbon possesses, are incapable, hitherto, of being reduced to a metallic state, and consequently, being only presented to our observation under the form of oxyds, are confounded with earths. It is extremely probable that barytes, which we have just now arranged with earths, is in this situation; for in many experiments it exhibits properties nearly approaching to those of metallic bodies. It is even possible that all the substances we call earths may be only metallic oxyds, irreducible by any hitherto known process." – from [https://books.google.com/books?id=adYKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA218 page 218] of: Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans., ''Elements of Chemistry'', … , 4th ed. (Edinburgh, Scotland: William Creech, 1799). (The original passage appears in: Lavoisier, ''Traité Élémentaire de Chimie'', (Paris, France: Cuchet, 1789), vol. 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hZch3yOrayUC&amp;pg=PA174 p. 174].)&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[chemical affinity]] of silicon for oxygen is high enough that he had no means to reduce the oxide and isolate the element.&lt;ref name=Greenwood328/&gt; After an attempt to isolate silicon in 1808, [[Sir Humphry Davy]] proposed the name "silicium" for silicon, from the Latin ''silex'',&lt;!-- Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1) - Cite This Source si·lex –noun flint; silica.

A few others use instead a [[calque]] of the Latin root (e.g. [[Russian language|Russian]] ''кремний'', from ''кремень'' "flint"; [[Greek language|Greek]] ''πυριτιο'' from ''πυρ'' "fire"; [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''pii'' from ''piikivi'' "flint").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=si |title=14 Silicon |publisher=Elements.vanderkrogt.net |accessdate=2008-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gay-Lussac]] and [[Louis Jacques Thénard|Thénard]] are thought to have prepared impure [[amorphous silicon]] in 1811, through the heating of recently isolated [[potassium]] metal with [[silicon tetrafluoride]], but they did not purify and characterize the product, nor identify it as a new element.&lt;ref&gt;Gay-Lussac and Thenard, ''Recherches physico-chimiques'' … (Paris, France: Deterville, 1811), vol. 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ruITAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA313 pp. 313–314]; vol. 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=w8YPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA55# pp. 55–65].&lt;/ref&gt; Silicon was given its present name in 1817 by Scottish chemist [[Thomas Thomson (chemist)|Thomas Thomson]]. He retained part of Davy's name but added "-on" because he believed that silicon was a [[nonmetal]] similar to [[boron]] and [[carbon]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Thomson, ''A System of Chemistry in Four Volumes'', 5th ed. (London, England: Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy, 1817), vol. 1. From [https://books.google.com/books?id=zVA0AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA252 p. 252]: "The base of silica has been usually considered as a metal, and called ''silicium''. But as there is not the smallest evidence for its metallic nature, and as it bears a close resemblance to boron and carbon, it is better to class it along with these bodies, and to give it the name of ''silicon''."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1823, [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]] prepared amorphous silicon using approximately the same method as Gay-Lussac (reducing potassium fluorosilicate with molten potassium metal), but purifying the product to a brown powder by repeatedly washing it.&lt;ref&gt;See:

Silicon in its more common crystalline form was not prepared until 31 years later, by [[Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville|Deville]].&lt;ref&gt;In 1854, Deville was trying to prepare aluminium metal from aluminium chloride that was heavily contaminated with silicon chloride. Deville used two methods to prepare aluminium: heating aluminium chloride with sodium metal in an inert atmosphere (of hydrogen); and melting aluminum chloride with sodium chloride and then electrolyzing the mixture. In both cases, pure silicon was produced: the silicon dissolved in the molten aluminium, but crystallized upon cooling. Dissolving the crude aluminum in hydrochloric acid revealed flakes of crystallized silicon. See: Henri Sainte-Claire Deville (1854) [https://books.google.com/books?id=C3VFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA321 "Note sur deux procédés de préparation de l'aluminium et sur une nouvelle forme du silicium"] (Note on two procedures for the preparation of aluminium and on a new form of silicon), ''Comptes rendus'', '''39''': 321–326.&lt;br&gt;Subsequently, Deville obtained crystalline silicon by heating the chloride or fluoride of silicon with sodium metal, isolating the amorphous silicon, then melting the amorphous form with salt and heating the mixture until most of the salt evaporated.

Starting in the 1920s, the work of [[William Lawrence Bragg]] on [[X-ray crystallography]] successfully elucidated the compositions of the silicates, which had previously been known from [[analytical chemistry]] but had not yet been understood, together with [[Linus Pauling]]'s development of [[crystal chemistry]] and [[Victor Goldschmidt]]'s development of [[geochemistry]]. The middle of the 20th century saw the development of the chemistry and industrial use of [[siloxane]]s and the growing use of [[silicone]] [[polymer]]s, [[elastomer]]s, and [[resin]]s. In the late 20th century, the complexity of the crystal chemistry of [[silicide]]s was mapped, along with the solid-state chemistry of [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] [[semiconductor]]s.&lt;ref name=Greenwood328/&gt;

Because silicon is an important element in high-technology semiconductor devices, many places in the world bear its name. For example, [[Santa Clara Valley]] in California acquired the nickname [[Silicon Valley]], as the element is the base material in the semiconductor industry there. Since then, many other places have been dubbed similarly, including [[Silicon Forest]] in [[Oregon]], [[Silicon Hills]] in [[Austin, Texas]], [[Silicon Slopes]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], [[Silicon Saxony]] in Germany, [[Bangalore#Economy|Silicon Valley]] in India, [[Mexicali#Silicon Border|Silicon Border]] in [[Mexicali, Mexico]], [[Silicon Fen]] in [[Cambridge, England]], [[Old Street Roundabout#Silicon Roundabout|Silicon Roundabout]] in London, [[Silicon Glen]] in Scotland, and [[Silicon Gorge]] in [[Bristol, England]].&lt;ref&gt;Uskali, T., and Nordfors, D.

==Characteristics==
===Physical and atomic===
[[File:Silicon-unit-cell-3D-balls.png|upright=0.75|thumb|left|Silicon crystallizes in a diamond cubic crystal structure]]
[[File:Covalent bonding in silicon.svg|thumb|left|Covalent bonding in silicon]]
A silicon atom has fourteen [[electrons]]. In the ground state, they are arranged in the electron configuration [Ne]3s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Of these, four are [[valence electron]]s, occupying the 3s orbital and two of the 3p orbitals. Like the other members of its group, the lighter [[carbon]] and the heavier [[germanium]], [[tin]], and [[lead]], it has the same number of valence electrons as valence orbitals: hence, it can complete its [[octet rule|octet]] and obtain the stable [[noble gas]] configuration of [[argon]] by forming [[orbital hybridization|sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid orbitals]], forming tetrahedral SiX&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; derivatives where the central silicon atom shares an electron pair with each of the four atoms it is bonded to.&lt;ref name=King0&gt;King, pp. xiii–xviii&lt;/ref&gt; The first four [[ionisation energy|ionisation energies]] of silicon are 786.3, 1576.5, 3228.3, and 4354.4&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol respectively; these figures are high enough to preclude the possibility of simple cationic chemistry for the element. Following [[periodic trend]]s, its single-bond covalent radius of 117.6&amp;nbsp;pm is intermediate between those of carbon (77.2&amp;nbsp;pm) and germanium (122.3&amp;nbsp;pm). The hexacoordinate ionic radius of silicon may be considered to be 40&amp;nbsp;pm, although this must be taken as a purely notional figure  given the lack of a simple Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; cation in reality.&lt;ref name=Greenwood372&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 372&lt;/ref&gt;

At standard temperature and pressure, silicon is a shiny [[semiconductor]] with a bluish-grey metallic lustre; as typical for semiconductors, its resistivity drops as temperature rises. This arises because silicon has a small energy gap between its highest occupied energy levels (the valence band) and the lowest unoccupied ones (the conduction band). The [[Fermi level]] is about halfway between the valence and conduction bands and is the energy at which a state is as likely to be occupied by an electron as not. Hence pure silicon is an insulator at room temperature. However, doping silicon with a [[pnictogen]] such as [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]], or [[antimony]] introduces one extra electron per dopant and these may then be excited into the conduction band either thermally or photolytically, creating an [[Extrinsic semiconductor#N-type semiconductors|n-type semiconductor]]. Similarly, doping silicon with a [[boron group|group 13 element]] such as [[boron]], [[aluminium]], or [[gallium]] results in the introduction of acceptor levels that trap electrons that may be excited from the filled valence band, creating a [[Extrinsic semiconductor#P-type semiconductors|p-type semiconductor]]. Joining n-type silicon to p-type silicon creates a [[p-n junction]] with a common Fermi level; electrons flow from n to p, while holes flow from p to n, creating a voltage drop. This p-n junction thus acts as a [[diode]] that can rectify alternating current that allows current to pass more easily one way than the other. A [[transistor]] is an n-p-n junction, with a thin layer of weakly p-type silicon between two n-type regions. Biasing the emitter through a small forward voltage and the collector through a large reverse voltage allows the transistor to act as a [[triode]] amplifier.&lt;ref name=Greenwood331/&gt;

Silicon crystallises in a giant covalent structure at standard conditions, specifically in a [[diamond cubic]] lattice. It thus has a high melting point of 1414&amp;nbsp;°C, as a lot of energy is required to break the strong covalent bonds and melt the solid. It is not known to have any allotropes at standard pressure, but several other crystal structures are known at higher pressures. The general trend is one of increasing [[coordination number]] with pressure, culminating in a [[hexagonal close-packed]] allotrope at about 40&amp;nbsp;[[gigapascal]]s known as Si–VII (the standard modification being Si–I). Silicon boils at 3265&amp;nbsp;°C: this, while high, is still lower than the temperature at which its lighter congener [[carbon]] sublimes (3642&amp;nbsp;°C) and silicon similarly has a lower [[heat of vaporisation]] than carbon, consistent with the fact that the Si–Si bond is weaker than the C–C bond.&lt;ref name=Greenwood331/&gt;

===Isotopes===

Twenty [[radioisotopes]] have been characterized, the two stablest being &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;Si with a [[half-life]] of about 150&amp;nbsp;years, and &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;Si with a half-life of 2.62&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref name = "NNDC"/&gt; All the remaining [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives that are less than seven seconds, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than one tenth of a second.&lt;ref name = "NNDC"/&gt; Silicon does not have any known [[nuclear isomer]]s.&lt;ref name = "NNDC"/&gt; &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;Si undergoes low-energy [[beta decay]] to [[phosphorus-32|&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;P]] and then stable &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;[[sulfur|S]]. &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;Si may be produced by the [[neutron activation]] of natural silicon and is thus useful for quantitative analysis; it can be easily detected by its characteristic beta decay to stable &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;[[phosphorus|P]], in which the emitted electron carries up to 1.48&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|MeV]] of energy.&lt;ref name=Greenwood330/&gt;

Crystalline bulk silicon is rather inert, but becomes more reactive at high temperatures. Like its neighbour aluminium, silicon forms a thin, continuous surface layer of [[silicon dioxide]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that protects the metal from oxidation. Thus silicon does not measurably react with the air below 900&amp;nbsp;°C, but formation of the [[vitreous lustre|vitreous]] dioxide rapidly increases between 950&amp;nbsp;°C and 1160&amp;nbsp;°C and when 1400&amp;nbsp;°C is reached, atmospheric [[nitrogen]] also reacts to give the nitrides SiN and Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Silicon reacts with gaseous [[sulfur]] at 600&amp;nbsp;°C and gaseous [[phosphorus]] at 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. This oxide layer nevertheless does not prevent reaction with the [[halogen]]s; [[fluorine]] attacks silicon vigorously at room temperature, [[chlorine]] does so at about 300&amp;nbsp;°C, and [[bromine]] and [[iodine]] at about 500&amp;nbsp;°C. Silicon does not react with most aqueous acids, but is oxidised and fluorinated by a mixture of concentrated [[nitric acid]] and [[hydrofluoric acid]]; it readily dissolves in hot aqueous alkali to form [[silicate]]s. At high temperatures, silicon also reacts with [[alkyl halide]]s; this reaction may be catalysed by [[copper]] to directly synthesise [[organosilicon]] chlorides as precursors to [[silicone]] polymers. Upon melting, silicon becomes extremely reactive, alloying with most metals to form [[silicide]]s, and reducing most metal oxides because the [[heat of formation]] of silicon dioxide is so large. As a result, containers for liquid silicon must be made of [[refractory]], unreactive materials such as [[zirconium dioxide]] or group 4, 5, and 6 borides.&lt;ref name=Greenwood331&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 331–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Tetrahedral coordination is a major structural motif in silicon chemistry just as it is for carbon chemistry. However, the 3p subshell is rather more diffuse than the 2p subshell and does not hybridise so well with the 3s subshell. As a result, the chemistry of silicon and its heavier congeners shows significant differences from that of carbon,&lt;ref name=Kaupp&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kaupp |first=Martin |date=1 December 2006 |title=The role of radial nodes of atomic orbitals for chemical bonding and the periodic table |url=http://depa.fquim.unam.mx/amyd/archivero/LecturasobreNodosRadiales_12854.pdf |journal=Journal of Computational Chemistry |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=320–5 |doi=10.1002/jcc.20522 |pmid=17143872 |access-date=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus octahedral coordination is also significant.&lt;ref name=Greenwood331/&gt; For example, the [[electronegativity]] of silicon (1.90) is much less than that of carbon (2.55), because the valence electrons of silicon are further from the nucleus than those of carbon and hence experience smaller electrostatic forces of attraction from the nucleus. The poor overlap of 3p orbitals also results in a much lower tendency toward [[catenation]] (formation of Si–Si bonds) for silicon than for carbon, due to the concomitant weakening of the Si–Si bond compared to the C–C bond:&lt;ref name=King43&gt;King, pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; the average Si–Si bond energy is approximately 226&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, compared to a value of 356&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol for the C–C bond.&lt;ref name=Greenwood374&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt; This results in multiply bonded silicon compounds generally being much less stable than their carbon counterparts, an example of the [[double bond rule]]. On the other hand, the presence of 3d orbitals in the valence shell of silicon suggests the possibility of [[hypervalence]], as seen in five and six-coordinate derivatives of silicon such as {{chem|SiX|5|-}} and {{chem|SiF|6|2-}}.&lt;ref name=King43/&gt; Lastly, because of the increasing energy gap between the valence s and p orbitals as the group is descended, the divalent state grows in importance from carbon to lead, so that a few unstable divalent compounds are known for silicon; this lowering of the main oxidation state, in tandem with increasing atomic radii, results in an increase of metallic character down the group. Silicon already shows some incipient metallic behavior, particularly in the behavior of its oxide compounds and its reaction with acids as well as bases (though this takes some effort), and is hence often referred to as a [[metalloid]] rather than a nonmetal.&lt;ref name=King43/&gt; However, metallicity does not become clear in group 14 until germanium and dominant until tin, with the growing importance of the lower +2 oxidation state.&lt;ref name=Greenwood328/&gt;

Silicon shows clear differences from carbon. For example, [[organic chemistry]] has very few analogies with silicon chemistry, while [[silicate]] minerals have a structural complexity unseen in [[oxocarbon]]s.&lt;ref name=Greenwood328&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 328–329&lt;/ref&gt; Silicon tends to resemble germanium far more than it does carbon, and this resemblance is enhanced by the [[d-block contraction]], resulting in the size of the germanium atom being much closer to that of the silicon atom than periodic trends would predict.&lt;ref name=Greenwood372/&gt; Nevertheless, there are still some differences because of the growing importance of the divalent state in germanium compared to silicon, which result in germanium being significantly more metallic than silicon. Additionally, the lower Ge–O bond strength compared to the Si–O bond strength results in the absence of "germanone" polymers that would be analogous to [[silicone]] polymers.&lt;ref name=Greenwood374/&gt;

===Silicides===
{{main|Silicide|Binary compounds of silicon}}
[[File:Diagramme binaire Fe Si analyse thermique 30.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Phase diagram of the Fe–Si system]]
Many metal [[silicide]]s are known, most of which have formulae that cannot be explained through simple appeals to [[valence (chemistry)|valence]]: their bonding ranges from [[metallic bond|metallic]] to [[ionic bond|ionic]] and [[covalent bond|covalent]]. Some known stoichiometries are M&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Si, M&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Si, M&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Si, M&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si, M&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si, M&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, MSi, M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, MSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, MSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and MSi&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. They are structurally more similar to the [[boride]]s than the [[carbide]]s, in keeping with the [[diagonal relationship]] between [[boron]] and silicon, although the larger size of silicon than boron means that exact structural analogies are few and far between. The heats of formation of the silicides are usually similar to those of the borides and carbides of the same elements, but they usually melt at lower temperatures.&lt;ref name=Greenwood335&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 335–337&lt;/ref&gt; Silicides are known for all stable elements in groups 1–10, with the exception of [[beryllium]]: in particular, [[uranium]] and the transition metals of groups 4–10 show the widest range of stoichiometries. Except for [[copper]], the metals in groups 11–15 do not form silicides. Instead, most form [[eutectic mixture]]s, although the heaviest [[post-transition metal]]s [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[thallium]], [[lead]], and [[bismuth]] are completely immiscible with liquid silicon.&lt;ref name=Greenwood335/&gt;

Usually, silicides are prepared by direct reaction of the elements. For example, the [[alkali metal]]s and [[alkaline earth metal]]s react with silicon or silicon oxide to give silicides. Nevertheless, even with these highly electropositive elements true silicon anions are not obtainable, and most of these compounds are semiconductors. For example, the alkali metal silicides {{chem|(M|+|)|4|(E|4|4-|)}} contain pyramidal tricoordinate silicon in the {{chem|Si|4|4-}} anion, isoeelctronic with [[white phosphorus]], P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Greenwood335/&gt;&lt;ref name=King45&gt;King, pp. 45–47&lt;/ref&gt; Metal-rich silicides tend to have isolated silicon atoms (e. g. Cu&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Si); with increasing silicon content, catenation increases, resulting in isolated clusters of two (e. g. U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or four silicon atoms (e. g. [K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;) at first, followed by chains (e. g. CaSi), layers (e. g. CaSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), or three-dimensional networks of silicon atoms spanning space (e. g. α-ThSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as the silicon content rises even higher.&lt;ref name=Greenwood335/&gt;

The silicides of the group 1 and 2 metals usually are more reactive than the transition metal silicides. The latter usually do not react with aqueous reagents, except for [[hydrofluoric acid]]; however, they do react with much more aggressive reagents such as liquid [[potassium hydroxide]], or gaseous fluorine or [[chlorine]] when red-hot. The pre-transition metal silicides instead readily react with water and aqueous acids, usually producing hydrogen or silanes:&lt;ref name=Greenwood335/&gt;
:Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
Products often vary with the stoichiometry of the silicide reactant. For example, Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si is polar and non-conducting and has the anti-PbCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure with single isolated silicon atoms, and reacts with water to produce [[calcium hydroxide]], hydrated silicon dioxide, and hydrogen gas. CaSi with its zigzag chains of silicon atoms instead reacts to give silanes and polymeric SiH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while CaSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with its puckered layers of silicon atoms does not react with water, but will react with dilute hydrochloric acid: the product is a yellow polymeric solid with stoichiometry Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;ref name=Greenwood335/&gt;

===Silanes===
{{main|Silanes}}
Speculation on silicon hydride chemistry started in the 1830s, contemporary with the development of synthetic [[organic chemistry]]. [[Silane]] itself, as well as [[trichlorosilane]], were first synthesised by [[Friedrich Wöhler]] and [[Heinrich Buff]] in 1857 by reacting aluminium–silicon alloys with [[hydrochloric acid]], and characterised as SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and SiHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; by [[Charles Friedel]] and [[Albert Ladenburg]] in 1867. [[Disilane]] (Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) followed in 1902, when it was first made by [[Henri Moissan]] and [[Samuel Smiles]] by the [[protonolysis]] of [[magnesium silicide]]s. Further investigation had to wait until 1916 because of the great reactivity and thermal instability of the silanes; it was then that [[Alfred Stock]] began to study silicon hydrides in earnest with new greaseless vacuum techniques, as they were found as contaminants of his focus, the [[borane|boron hydride]]s. The names ''silanes'' and ''boranes'' are his, based on analogy with the [[alkane]]s.&lt;ref name=Greenwood337/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Wiber, [http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/pdf/1977/pdf/4906x0691.pdf Alfred Stock and the Renaissance of Inorganic Chemistry]," ''Pure Appl. Chem.'', Vol. 49 (1977) pp. 691–700.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Mellor, "A Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry," Vol. VI, Longman, Green and Co. (1947) pp. 223–227.&lt;/ref&gt; The Moissan and Smiles method of preparation of silanes and silane derivatives via protonolysis of metal silicides is still used, although the yield is lowered by the hydrolysis of the products that occurs simultaneously, so that the preferred route today is to treat substituted silanes with hydride reducing agents such as [[lithium aluminium hydride]] in etheric solutions at low temperatures. Direct reaction of HX or RX with silicon, possibly with a catalyst such as copper, is also a viable method of producing substituted silanes.&lt;ref name=Greenwood337/&gt;

The silanes comprise a [[homologous series]] of silicon hydrides with a general formula of Si&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sub&gt;. They are all strong [[reducing agent]]s. Unbranched and branched trains are known up to ''n''=8, and the cycles Si&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and Si&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; are also known. The first two, silane and disilane, are colourless gases; the heavier members of the series are volatile liquids. All silanes are very reactive and catch fire or explode spontaneously in air. They become less thermally stable with room temperature, so that only silane is indefinitely stable at room temperature, although disilane does not decompose very quickly (only 2.5% of a sample decomposes after the passage of eight months).&lt;ref name=Greenwood337/&gt; They decompose to form polymeric [[polysilicon hydride]] and hydrogen gas.&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Porterfield, Inorganic Chemistry: A Unified Approach, 2nd Ed.", Academic Press (1993), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Inorganic Chemistry, Holleman-Wiberg, John Wiley &amp; Sons (2001) p. 844.&lt;/ref&gt; As expected from the difference in atomic weight, the silanes are less volatile than the corresponding alkanes and boranes, but more so than the corresponding germanes. They are much more reactive than the corresponding alkanes, because of the larger radius of silicon compared to carbon facilitating [[nucleophile|nucleophilic attack]] at the silicon, the greater polarity of the Si–H bond compared to the C–H bond, and the ability of silicon to expand its octet and hence form adducts and lower the reaction's [[activation energy]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood337/&gt;

Silane [[pyrolysis]] gives polymeric species and finally elemental silicon and hydrogen; indeed ultrapure silicon is commercially produced by the pyrolysis of silane. While the thermal decomposition of alkanes starts by the breaking of a C–H or C–C bond and the formation of radical intermediates, polysilanes decompose by eliminating [[Silylene|silylenes]] :SiH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or :SiHR, as the activation energy of this process (~210&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol) is much less than the Si–Si and Si–H bond energies. While pure silanes do not react with pure water or dilute acids, traces of alkali catalyse immediate hydrolysis to hydrated silicon dioxide. If the reaction is carried out in [[methanol]], controlled solvolysis results in the products SiH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OMe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SiH(OMe)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and Si(OMe)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The Si–H bond also adds to [[alkene]]s, a reaction which proceeds slowly and speeds up with increasing substitution of the silane involved. At 450&amp;nbsp;°C, silane participates in an [[addition reaction]] with [[acetone]], as well as a [[ring-opening reaction]] with [[ethylene oxide]]. Direct reaction of the silanes with chlorine or bromine results in explosions at room temperature, but the reaction of silane with bromine at −80&amp;nbsp;°C is controlled and yields bromosilane and dibromosilane. The monohalosilanes may be formed by reacting silane with the appropriate [[hydrogen halide]] with an Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst, or by reacting silane with a solid [[silver]] halide in a heated flow reactor:&lt;ref name=Greenwood337/&gt;
:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 AgCl {{overunderset|→|260&amp;nbsp;°C|&amp;nbsp;}} SiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl + HCl + 2 Ag
Among the derivatives of silane, [[iodosilane]] (SiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;I) and [[potassium silanide]] (KSiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are very useful synthetic intermediates in the production of more complicated silicon-containing compounds: the latter is a colourless crystalline ionic solid containing K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations and {{chem|SiH|3|-}} anions in the [[sodium chloride|NaCl]] structure, and is made by the reduction of silane by [[potassium]] metal.&lt;ref name=King47&gt;King, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the reactive hypervalent species {{chem|SiH|5|-}} is also known.&lt;ref name=Greenwood337/&gt; With suitable organic substituents it is possible to produce stable polysilanes: they have surprisingly high electric conductivities, arising from [[sigma bond|sigma]] delocalisation of the electrons in the chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=R. D. |last2=Michl |first2=J. |doi=10.1021/cr00096a006 |title=Polysilane high polymers |journal=[[Chemical Reviews]] |volume=89 |issue=6| pages=1359 |year=1989 |pmid= |pmc =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Halides===
Silicon and [[silicon carbide]] readily react with all four stable halogens, forming the colourless, reactive, and volatile silicon tetrahalides.&lt;ref name=Greenwood340&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 340–2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silicon tetrafluoride]] also may be made by fluorinating the other silicon halides, and is produced by the attack of [[hydrofluoric acid]] on glass.&lt;ref name=King48/&gt; Heating two different tetrahalides together also produce a random mixture of mixed halides, which may also be produced by halogen exchange reactions. The melting and boiling points of these species usually rise with increasing atomic weight, though there are many exceptions: for example, the melting and boiling points drop as one passes from SiFBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; through SiFClBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to SiFCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br. The shift from the hypoelectronic elements in group 13 and earlier to the group 14 elements is illustrated by the change from an infinite ionic structure in [[aluminium fluoride]] to a lattice of simple covalent silicon tetrafluoride molecules, as dictated by the lower electronegativity of aluminium than silicon, the stoichiometry (the +4 oxidation state being too high for true ionicity), and the smaller size of the silicon atom compared to the aluminium atom.&lt;ref name=Greenwood340/&gt; [[Silicon tetrachloride]] is manufactured on a huge scale as a precursor to the production of pure silicon, silicon dioxide, and some silicon [[ester]]s.&lt;ref name=Greenwood340/&gt; The silicon tetrahalides hydrolyse readily in water, unlike the carbon tetrahalides, again because of the larger size of the silicon atom rendering it more open to nucleophilic attack and the ability of the silicon atom to expand its octet which carbon lacks.&lt;ref name=King48&gt;King, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction of silicon fluoride with excess [[hydrofluoric acid]] produces the octahedral [[Hexafluorosilicic acid|hexafluorosilicate]] anion {{chem|SiF|6|2-}}.&lt;ref name=King48/&gt;

Analogous to the silanes, halopolysilanes Si&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sub&gt; also are known. While catenation in carbon compounds is maximised in the hydrogen compounds rather than the halides, the opposite is true for silicon, so that the halopolysilanes are known up to at least Si&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;, Si&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;, and Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;. A suggested explanation for this phenomenon is the compensation for the electron loss of silicon to the more electronegative halogen atoms by [[pi backbonding]] from the filled p&lt;sub&gt;π&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals on the halogen atoms to the empty d&lt;sub&gt;π&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals on silicon: this is similar to the situation of [[carbon monoxide]] in [[metal carbonyl complex]]es and explains their stability. These halopolysilanes may be produced by [[comproportionation]] of silicon tetrahalides with elemental silicon, or by condensation of lighter halopolysilanes ([[trimethylammonium]] being a useful catalyst for this reaction).&lt;ref name=Greenwood340/&gt;

===Silica===
[[Silicon dioxide]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), also known as silica, is one of the best-studied compounds, second only to [[properties of water|water]]. Twelve different crystal modifications of silica are known, the most common being α-[[quartz]], a major constituent of many rocks such as [[granite]] and [[sandstone]]. It also is known to occur in a pure form as [[rock crystal]]; impure forms are known as [[rose quartz]], [[smoky quartz]], [[morion (mineral)|morion]], [[amethyst]], and [[citrine quartz|citrine]]. Some poorly crystalline forms of quartz are also known, such as [[chalcedony]], [[chrysoprase]], [[carnelian]], [[agate]], [[onyx]], [[jasper]], [[heliotrope (mineral)|heliotrope]], and [[flint]]. Other modifications of silicon dioxide are known in some other minerals such as [[tridymite]] and [[cristobalite]], as well as the much less common [[coesite]] and [[stishovite]]. Biologically generated forms are also known as [[kieselguhr]] and [[diatomaceous earth]]. [[Vitrification|Vitreous]] silicon dioxide is known as [[tektite]]s, and [[obsidian]], and rarely as [[lechatelierite]]. Some synthetic forms are known as [[keatite]] and [[W-silica]]. [[Opal]]s are composed of complicated crystalline aggregates of partially hydrated silicon dioxide.&lt;ref name=Greenwood342&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 342–347&lt;/ref&gt;

Most crystalline forms of silica are made of infinite arrangements of {SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;} tetrahedra (with Si at the center) connected at their corners, with each oxygen atom linked to two silicon atoms. In the thermodynamically stable room-temperature form, α-quartz, these tetrahedra are linked in intertwined helical chains with two different Si–O distances (159.7 and 161.7&amp;nbsp;pm) with a Si–O–Si angle of 144°. These helices can be either left- or right-handed, so that individual α-quartz crystals are optically active. At 537&amp;nbsp;°C, this transforms quickly and reversibly into the similar β-quartz, with a change of the Si–O–Si angle to 155° but a retention of handedness. Further heating to 867&amp;nbsp;°C results in another reversible phase transition to β-tridymite, in which some Si–O bonds are broken to allow for the arrangement of the {SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;} tetrahedra into a more open and less dense hexagonal structure. This transition is slow and hence tridymite occurs as a metastable mineral even below this transition temperature; when cooled to about 120&amp;nbsp;°C it quickly and reversibly transforms by slight displacements of individual silicon and oxygen atoms to α-tridymite, similarly to the transition from α-quartz to β-quartz. β-tridymite slowly transforms to cubic β-cristobalite at about 1470&amp;nbsp;°C, which once again exists metastably below this transition temperature and transforms at 200–280&amp;nbsp;°C to α-cristobalite via small atomic displacements. β-cristobalite melts at 1713&amp;nbsp;°C; the freezing of silica from the melt is quite slow and [[vitrification]], or the formation of a [[glass]], is likely to occur instead. In vitreous silica, the {SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;} tetrahedra remain corner-connected, but the symmetry and periodicity of the crystalline forms are lost. Because of the slow conversions between these three forms, it is possible upon rapid heating to melt β-quartz (1550&amp;nbsp;°C) or β-tridymite (1703&amp;nbsp;°C). Silica boils at approximately 2800&amp;nbsp;°C. Other high-pressure forms of silica are known, such as coesite and stishovite: these are known in nature, formed under the shock pressure of a meteorite impact and then rapidly quenched to preserve the crystal structure. Similar melting and cooling of silica occurs following [[lightning]] strikes, forming glassy [[lechatelierite]]. W-silica is an unstable low-density form involving {SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;} tetrahedra sharing opposite edges instead of corners, forming parallel chains similarly to [[silicon disulfide]] (SiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[silicon diselenide]] (SiSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;): it quickly returns to forming amorphous silica with heat or traces of water.&lt;ref name=Greenwood342/&gt;

[[File:Метакремниевая кислота H2SiO3.JPG|thumb|right|Condensed polysilicic acid]]
Silica is rather inert chemically. It is not attacked by any acids other than hydrofluoric acid. However, it slowly dissolves in hot concentrated alkalis, and does so rather quickly in fused metal hydroxides or carbonates, to give metal silicates. Among the elements, it is attacked only by fluorine at room temperature to form silicon tetrafluoride: hydrogen and carbon also react, but require temperatures over 1000&amp;nbsp;°C to do so. Silica nevertheless reacts with many metal and [[metalloid]] oxides to form a wide variety of compounds important in the glass and ceramic industries above all, but also have many other uses: for example, [[sodium silicate]] is often used in detergents due to its [[buffer (chemistry)|buffering]], [[saponification|saponifying]], and [[emulsification|emulsifying]] properties.&lt;ref name=Greenwood342/&gt;

===Silicic acids===
Adding water to silica drops its melting point by around 800&amp;nbsp;°C due to the breaking of the structure by replacing Si–O–Si linkages with terminating Si–OH groups. Increasing water concentration results in the formation of hydrated [[silica gel]]s and [[colloid]]al silica dispersions. Many hydrates and [[silicic acid]]s exist in the most dilute of aqueous solutions, but these are rather insoluble and quickly precipitate and condense and cross-link to form various polysilicic acids of variable combinations following the formula [SiO&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4−2''x''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, similar to the behaviour of [[boron]], [[aluminium]], and [[iron]], among other elements. Hence, although some simple silicic acids have been identified in dilute solutions, such as [[orthosilicic acid]] Si(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and [[metasilicic acid]] SiO(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, none of these are likely to exist in the solid state.&lt;ref name=Greenwood342/&gt;

About 95% of the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]]al rocks are made of silica or silicate and [[aluminosilicate]] minerals, as reflected in oxygen, silicon, and aluminium being the three most common elements in the crust (in that order).&lt;ref name=Greenwood347/&gt; Measured by mass, silicon makes up 27.7% of the [[Earth's crust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MrlUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=SL1-PA54|title=Geological Survey professional paper|author=Geological Survey (U.S.) |date=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure silicon crystals are very rarely found in nature, but notable exceptions are crystals as large as to 0.3&amp;nbsp;mm across found during sampling gases from the [[Medvezhya|Kudriavy]] volcano on [[Iturup]], one of the [[Kuril Islands]].&lt;ref name="KorzhinskyTkachenko1995"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Korzhinsky |first1=M.

Silicate and aluminosilicate minerals have many different structures and varying stoichiometry, but they may be classified following some general principles. Tetrahedral {SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;} units are common to almost all these compounds, either as discrete structures, or combined into larger units by the sharing of corner oxygen atoms. These may be divided into ''neso''-silicates (discrete {SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;} units) sharing no oxygen atoms, ''soro''-silicates (discrete {Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;} units) sharing one, ''cyclo''-silicates (closed ring structures) and ''ino''-silicates (continuous chain or ribbon structures) both sharing two, ''phyllo''-silicates (continuous sheets) sharing three, and ''tecto''-silicates (continuous three-dimensional frameworks) sharing four. The lattice of oxygen atoms that results is usually close-packed, or close to it, with the charge being balanced by other cations in various different polyhedral sites according to size.&lt;ref name=Greenwood347&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 347–59&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[orthosilicate]]s M{{su|p=II|b=2}}SiO{{su|b=4}} (M = Be, Mg, Mn, Fe, Zn) and ZrSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are ''neso''-silicates. Be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ([[phenacite]]) is unusual as both Be&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and Si&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; occupy tetrahedral four-coordinated sites; the other divalent cations instead occupy six-coordinated octahedral sites and often isomorphously replace each other as in [[olivine]], (Mg,Fe,Mn)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. [[Zircon]], ZrSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, demands eight-coordination of the Zr&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; cations due to stoichiometry and because of their larger ionic radius (84&amp;nbsp;pm). Also significant are the [[garnet]]s, [M{{su|p=II|b=3}}M{{su|p=III|b=2}}(SiO{{su|b=4}}){{su|b=3}}], in which the divalent cations (e.g. Ca, Mg, Fe) are eight-coordinated and the trivalent ones are six-coordinated (e.g. Al, Cr, Fe). Regular coordination is not always present: for example, it is not found in Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which mixes six- and eight-coordinate sites for Ca&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;. ''Soro''-silicates, involving discrete double or triple tetrahedral units, are quite rare: metasilicates involving cyclic "[(SiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2''n''−&lt;/sup&gt;" units of corner-abutting tetrahedra forming a polygonal ring are also known.&lt;ref name=Greenwood347/&gt;

Chain metasilicates, {SiO{{su|p=2−|b=3}}}{{su|b=&amp;infin;}}, form by corner-sharing of an indefinite chain of linked {SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;} tetrahedra. Many differences arise due to the differing repeat distances of conformation across the line of tetrahedra. A repeat distance of two is most common, as in most [[pyroxene]] minerals, but repeat distances of one, three, four, five, six, seven, nine, and twelve are also known. These chains may then link across each other to form double chains and ribbons, as in the [[asbestos]] minerals, involving repeated chains of cyclic tetrahedron rings.&lt;ref name=Greenwood347/&gt;

[[File:Zeolite-ZSM-5-vdW.png|thumb|right|A typical zeolite structure]]
Layer silicates, such as the clay minerals and the [[mica]]s, are very common, and often are formed by horizontal cross-linking of metasilicate chains or planar condensation of smaller units. An example is [[kaolinite]] [Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]; in many of these minerals cation and anion replacement is common, so that for example tetrahedral Si&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; may be replaced by Al&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;, octahedral Al&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; by Mg&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;, and OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; by F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. Three-dimensional framework aluminosilicates are structurally very complex; they may be conceived of as starting from the SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure, but having replaced up to one-half of the Si&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; atoms with Al&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;, they require more cations to be included in the structure to balance charge. Examples include [[feldspar]]s (the most abundant minerals on the Earth), [[zeolite]]s, and [[ultramarine]]s. Many feldspars can be thought of as forming part of the ternary system NaAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;–KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;–CaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. Their lattice is destroyed by high pressure prompting Al&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; to undergo six-coordination rather than four-coordination, and this reaction destroying feldspars may be a reason for the [[Mohorovičić discontinuity]], which would imply that the crust and mantle have the same chemical composition, but different lattices, although this is not a universally held view. Zeolites have many polyhedral cavities in their frameworks ([[truncated cuboctahedron|truncated cuboctahedra]] being most common, but other polyhedra also are known as zeolite cavities), allowing them to include loosely bound molecules such as water in their structure. Ultramarines alternate silicon and aluminium atoms and include a variety of other anions such as Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, {{chem|SO|4|2-}}, and {{chem|S|2|2-}}, but are otherwise similar to the feldspars.&lt;ref name=Greenwood347/&gt;

===Other inorganic compounds===
[[Silicon disulfide]] (SiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is formed by burning silicon in gaseous sulfur at 100&amp;nbsp;°C; sublimation of the resulting compound in nitrogen results in white, flexible long fibers reminiscent of [[asbestos]] with a structure similar to W-silica. This melts at 1090&amp;nbsp;°C and sublimes at 1250&amp;nbsp;°C; at high temperature and pressure this transforms to a crystal structure analogous to cristobalite. However, SiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lacks the variety of structures of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and quickly hydrolyses to silica and [[hydrogen sulfide]]. It is also ammonoloysed quickly and completely by liquid [[ammonia]] as follows to form an [[imide]]:&lt;ref name=Greenwood359&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 359–61&lt;/ref&gt;
:SiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Si(NH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SH
It reacts with the sulfides of sodium, magnesium, aluminium, and iron to form metal [[thiosilicate]]s: reaction with [[ethanol]] results in [[tetraethylsilicate]] Si(OEt)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and hydrogen sulfide. Ethylsilicate is useful as its controlled hydrolysis produces adhesive or film-like forms of silica. Reacting hydrogen sulfide with silicon tetrahalides yields silicon thiohalides such as S(SiCl)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, cyclic Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si(μ-S)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and crystalline (SiSCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Despite the [[double bond rule]], stable organosilanethiones RR'Si=S have been made thanks to the stabilising mechanism of intermolecular coordination via an [[amine]] group.&lt;ref name=Greenwood359/&gt;

[[Silicon nitride]], Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, may be formed by directly reacting silicon with nitrogen above 1300&amp;nbsp;°C, but a more economical means of production is by heating silica and coke in a stream of nitrogen and hydrogen gas at 1500&amp;nbsp;°C. It would make a promising [[ceramic]] if not for the difficulty of working with and sintering it: chemically, it is near-totally inert, and even above 1000&amp;nbsp;°C it keeps its strength, shape, and continues to be resistant to wear and corrosion. It is very hard (9 on the [[Mohs hardness scale]]), dissociates only at 1900&amp;nbsp;°C at 1&amp;nbsp;atm, and is quite dense (density 3.185&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), because of its compact structure similar to that of phenacite (Be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). A similar refractory material is Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, formed by heating silicon and silica at 1450&amp;nbsp;°C in an argon stream containing 5% nitrogen gas, involving 4-coordinate silicon and 3-coordinate nitrogen alternating in puckered hexagonal tilings interlinked by non-linear Si–O–Si linkages to each other.&lt;ref name=Greenwood359/&gt;

Reacting silyl halides with ammonia or alkylammonia derivatives in the gaseous phase or in ethanolic solution produces various volatile silylamides, which are silicon analogues of the [[amine]]s:&lt;ref name=Greenwood359/&gt;
:3 SiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl + 4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → N(SiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl
:SiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br + 2 Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH → SiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br
:4 SiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;I + 5 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → (SiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NN(SiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;I

Many such compounds have been prepared, the only known restriction being that the nitrogen is always tertiary, and species containing the SiH–NH group are unstable at room temperature. The stoichiometry around the nitrogen atom in compounds such as N(SiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;is planar, which has been attributed to a p&lt;sub&gt;π&lt;/sub&gt;–d&lt;sub&gt;π&lt;/sub&gt; interaction between a lone pair on nitrogen and an empty d&lt;sub&gt;π&lt;/sub&gt; orbital on silicon. Similarly, trisilylamines are weaker as ligands than their carbon analogues, the tertiary [[amine]]s, although substitution of some SiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; groups by CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; groups mitigates this weakness. For example, N(SiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; does not form an [[adduct]] with [[borane|BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] at all, while MeN(SiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NSiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; form adducts at low temperatures that decompose upon warming. Some silicon analogues of [[imine]]s, with a Si=N double bond, are known: the first found was Bu&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si=N–SiBu&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which was discovered in 1986.&lt;ref name=Greenwood359/&gt;

[[File:SiC p1390066.jpg|thumb|right|Silicon carbide]]
[[Silicon carbide]] (SiC) was first made by [[Edward Goodrich Acheson]] in 1891, who named it carborundum to reference its intermediate hardness and abrasive power between [[diamond]] (an allotrope of carbon) and [[corundum]] ([[aluminium oxide]]). He soon founded a company to manufacture it, and today about one million tonnes are produced each year.&lt;ref name=Greenwood334&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; Silicon carbide exists in about 250 crystalline forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJySnYNE3B0C |page=3 |title=Silicon carbide microelectromechanical systems for harsh environments |author=Cheung, Rebecca |publisher = Imperial College Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-86094-624-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The polymorphism of SiC is characterized by a large family of similar crystalline structures called polytypes. They are variations of the same chemical compound that are identical in two dimensions and differ in the third. Thus they can be viewed as layers stacked in a certain sequence.&lt;ref name=jap&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1063/1.358463 |title=Large-band-gap SiC, III-V nitride, and II-VI ZnSe-based semiconductor device technologies |year=1994 |author=Morkoç, H. |journal=Journal of Applied Physics |volume=76| issue=3 |page=1363 |last2=Strite |first2=S. |last3=Gao |first3=G.

:SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 C → Si + 2 CO
:Si + C → SiC

It is the most thermally stable binary silicon compound, only decomposing through loss of silicon starting from around 2700&amp;nbsp;°C. It is resistant to most aqueous acids, [[phosphoric acid]] being an exception. It forms a protective layer of [[silicon dioxide]] on the surface and hence only oxidises appreciably in air above 1000&amp;nbsp;°C; removal of this layer by molten hydroxides or carbonates leads to quick oxidation. Silicon carbide is rapidly attacked by chlorine gas, which forms SiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and carbon at 100&amp;nbsp;°C and SiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and [[carbon tetrachloride|CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] at 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. It is mostly used as an abrasive and a refractory material, as it is chemically stable and very strong, and it fractures to form a very sharp cutting edge. It is also useful as an intrinsic semiconductor, as well as an extrinsic semiconductor upon being doped.&lt;ref name=Greenwood334/&gt; In its diamond-like behavior it serves as an illustration of the chemical similarity between carbon and silicon.&lt;ref name=Greenwood361/&gt;

===Organosilicon compounds===
{{main|Organosilicon}}
[[Image:HydrosilylationTriphenylsilylhydride.png|upright=1.8|thumb|right|A hydrosilylation reaction, in which Si–H is added to an unsaturated substrate]]
Because the Si–C bond is close in strength to the C–C bond, organosilicon compounds tend to be markedly thermally and chemically stable. For example, [[tetraphenylsilane]] (SiPh&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) may be distilled in air even at its boiling point of 428&amp;nbsp;°C, and so may its substituted derivatives Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiCl and Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which boil at 378&amp;nbsp;°C and 305&amp;nbsp;°C respectively. Furthermore, since carbon and silicon are chemical congeners, organosilicon chemistry shows some significant similarities with carbon chemistry, for example in the propensity of such compounds for catenation and forming multiple bonds.&lt;ref name=Greenwood361&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 361–6&lt;/ref&gt; However, significant differences also arise: since silicon is more electropositive than carbon, bonds to more electronegative elements are generally stronger with silicon than with carbon, and vice versa. Thus the Si–F bond is significantly stronger than even the [[carbon–fluorine bond|C–F bond]] and is one of the strongest single bonds, while the Si–H bond is much weaker than the C–H bond and is readily broken. Furthermore, the ability of silicon to expand its octet is not shared by carbon, and hence some organosilicon reactions have no organic analogues. For example, nucleophilic attack on silicon does not proceed by the [[SN2 reaction|S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2]] or [[SN1 reaction|S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1]] processes, but instead goes through a negatively charged true pentacoordinate intermediate and appears like a substitution at a hindered tertiary atom. This works for silicon, unlike for carbon, because the long Si–C bonds reduce the steric hindrance and the d-orbital of silicon is geometrically unconstrained for nucleophilic attack, unlike for example a C–O σ* antibonding orbital. Nevertheless, despite these differences, the mechanism is still often called "S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 at silicon" for simplicity.&lt;ref name=Clayden668&gt;Clayden, pp. 668–77&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most useful silicon-containing groups is [[trimethylsilyl]], Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si–. The Si–C bond connecting it to the rest of the molecule is reasonably strong, allowing it to remain while the rest of the molecule undergoes reactions, but is not so strong that it cannot be removed specifically when needed, for example by the [[fluoride]] ion, which is a very weak nucleophile for carbon compounds but a very strong one for organosilicon compounds. It may be compared to acidic [[proton]]s; while trisilylmethyl is removed by hard nucleophiles instead of bases, both removals usually promote elimination. As a general rule, while saturated carbon is best attacked by nucleophiles that are neutral compounds, those based on nonmetals far down on the periodic table (e.g. sulfur, [[selenium]], or [[iodine]]), or even both, silicon is best attacked by charged nucleophiles, particularly those involving such highly electronegative nonmetals as oxygen, fluorine, or chlorine. For example, enolates react at the carbon in [[haloalkane]]s, but at the oxygen in [[silyl]] chlorides; and when trimethylsilyl is removed from an organic molecule using hydroxide as a nucleophile, the product of the reaction is not the silanol as one would expect from using carbon chemistry as an analogy, because the siloxide is strongly nucleophilic and attacks the original molecule to yield the [[silyl ether]] [[hexamethyldisiloxane]], (Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Conversely, while the S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reaction is mostly unaffected by the presence of a partial positive charge (δ+) at the carbon, the analogous "S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2" reaction at silicon is so affected. Thus, for example, the silyl [[triflate]]s are so electrophilic that they react 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; times faster than silyl chlorides with oxygen-containing nucleophiles. [[Trimethylsilyl triflate]] is in particular a very good [[Lewis acid]] and is used to convert [[carbonyl]] compounds to [[acetal]]s and [[silyl enol ether]]s, reacting them together analogously to the [[aldol reaction]].&lt;ref name=Clayden668/&gt;

Si–C bonds are commonly formed in three ways. In the laboratory, preparation is often carried out in small quantities by reacting tetrachlorosilane with [[organolithium]], [[Grignard reagent|Grignard]], or [[organoaluminium]] reagents, or by catalytic addition of Si–H across C=C double bonds. The second route has the drawback of not being applicable to the most important silanes, the methyl and phenyl silanes. Organosilanes are made industrially by directly reacting alkyl or aryl halides with silicon with 10% by weight metallic [[copper]] as a catalyst. Standard organic reactions suffice to produce many derivatives; the resulting organosilanes are often significantly more reactive than their carbon congeners, readily undergoing hydrolysis, ammonolysis, alcoholysis, and condensation to form cyclic oligomers or linear polymers.&lt;ref name=Greenwood361/&gt;

===Silicone polymers===
{{main|Silicone}}
[[File:PmdsStructure.png|thumb|right|Structure of [[polydimethylsiloxane]], the principal component of silicones]]
The word "silicone" was first used by Frederic Kipping in 1901. He invented the word to illustrate the similarity of chemical formulae between Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO and [[benzophenone]], Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO, although he also stressed the lack of chemical resemblance due to the polymeric structure of Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO, which is not shared by Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO.&lt;ref name=Greenwood361/&gt;

Silicones may be considered analogous to mineral silicates, in which the methyl groups of the silicones correspond to the [[isoelectronic]] O&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; of the silicates.&lt;ref name=Greenwood361/&gt; They are quite stable to extreme temperatures, oxidation, and water, and have useful dielectric, antistick, and antifoam properties. Furthermore, they are resistant over long periods of time to ultraviolet radiation and weathering, and are inert physiologically. They are fairly unreactive, but do react with concentrated solutions bearing the hydroxide ion and fluorinating agents, and occasionally, may even be used as mild reagents for selective syntheses. For example, (Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is valuable for the preparation of derivatives of [[molybdenum]] and [[tungsten]] oxyhalides, converting a [[tungsten hexachloride]] suspension in [[dichloroethane]] solution quantitatively to WOCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in under an hour at room temperature, and then to yellow WO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 100&amp;nbsp;°C in light petroleum at a yield of 95% overnight.&lt;ref name=Greenwood361/&gt;

==Occurrence==
[[File:Olivine-gem7-10a.jpg|thumb|right|Olivine]]
In the universe, silicon is the seventh most abundant element, coming after [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[neon]]. These abundances are not replicated well on Earth due to substantial separation of the elements taking place during the formation of the [[Solar System]]. Silicon makes up 27.2% of the Earth's crust by weight, second only to oxygen at 45.5%, with which it always is associated in nature. Further fractionation took place in the formation of the Earth by [[planetary differentiation]]: [[Earth's core]], which makes up 31.5% of the mass of the Earth, has approximate composition Fe&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] makes up 68.1% of the Earth's mass and is composed mostly of denser oxides and silicates, an example being [[olivine]], (Mg,Fe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;; while the lighter siliceous minerals such as [[aluminosilicate]]s rise to the surface and form the crust, making up 0.4% of the Earth's mass.&lt;ref name=Greenwood329&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 329–330&lt;/ref&gt;

The crystallisation of [[igneous rock]]s from magma depends on a number of factors; among them are the chemical composition of the magma, the cooling rate, and some properties of the individual minerals to be formed, such as [[lattice energy]], melting point, and complexity of their crystal structure. As magma is cooled, [[olivine]] appears first, followed by [[pyroxene]], [[amphibole]], [[biotite]] mica, [[orthoclase feldspar]], [[muscovite mica]], [[quartz]], [[zeolite]]s, and finally, hydrothermal minerals. This sequence shows a trend toward increasingly complex silicate units with cooling, and the introduction of [[hydroxide]] and [[fluoride]] anions in addition to oxides. Many metals may substitute for silicon. After these igneous rocks undergo [[weathering]], transport, and deposition, [[sedimentary rock]]s like clay, shale, and sandstone are formed. [[Metamorphism]] also may occur at high temperatures and pressures, creating an even vaster variety of minerals.&lt;ref name=Greenwood329/&gt;

==Production==
Silicon of 96–99% purity is made by reducing [[quartzite]] or sand with highly pure [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]. The reduction is carried out in an [[electric arc furnace]], with an excess of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; used to stop [[silicon carbide]] (SiC) from accumulating:&lt;ref name=Greenwood330/&gt;
:SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 C → Si + 2 CO
:2 SiC + SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 Si + 2 CO

This reaction, known as carbothermal reduction of silicon dioxide, usually is conducted in the presence of scrap iron with low amounts of [[phosphorus]] and [[sulfur]], producing [[ferrosilicon]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood330/&gt; Ferrosilicon, an iron-silicon alloy that contains varying ratios of elemental silicon and iron, accounts for about 80% of the world's production of elemental silicon, with China, the leading supplier of elemental silicon, providing 4.6 million [[tonne]]s (or 2/3 of world output) of silicon, most of it in the form of ferrosilicon. It is followed by Russia (610,000 t), Norway (330,000 t), Brazil (240,000 t), and the United States (170,000 t).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/silicon/mcs-2011-simet.pdf |publisher=USGS |title=Silicon Commodities Report 2011 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrosilicon is primarily used by the iron and steel industry (see below) with primary use as alloying addition in iron or steel and for de-oxidation of steel in integrated steel plants.&lt;ref name=Greenwood330/&gt; Another reaction, sometimes used, is aluminothermal reduction of silicon dioxide, as follows:&lt;ref name=Ullmann574&gt;Zulehner et al., p. 574&lt;/ref&gt;
:3 SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 Al → 3 Si + 2 Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Leaching powdered 96–97% pure silicon with water results in ~98.5% pure silicon, which is used in the chemical industry. However, even greater purity is needed for semiconductor applications, and this is produced from the reduction of tetrachlorosilane or trichlorosilane. The former is made by chlorinating scrap silicon and the latter is a byproduct of [[silicone]] production. These compounds are volatile and hence can be purified by repeated [[fractional distillation]], followed by reduction to elemental silicon with very pure [[zinc]] metal as the reducing agent. The spongy pieces of silicon thus produced are melted and then grown to form cylindrical single crystals, before being purified by [[zone refining]]. Other routes use the thermal decomposition of silane or tetraiodosilane. Another process used is the reduction of [[sodium hexafluorosilicate]], a common waste product of the phosphate fertilizer industry, by metallic [[sodium]]: this is highly exothermic and hence requires no outside fuel source. Hyperfine silicon is made at a higher purity than almost every other material: [[transistor]] production requires impurity levels in silicon crystals less than 1 part per 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;, and in special cases impurity levels below 1 part per 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; are needed and attained.&lt;ref name=Greenwood330/&gt;

==Applications==
===Compounds===
Most silicon is used industrially without being purified, and indeed, often with comparatively little processing from its natural form. More than 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of [[silicate minerals]], which are compounds of silicon and oxygen, often with metallic ions when negatively charged silicate anions require cations to balance the charge. Many of these have direct commercial uses, such as clays, [[silica]] sand, and most kinds of building stone. Thus, the vast majority of uses for silicon are as structural compounds, either as the silicate minerals or silica (crude silicon dioxide). Silicates are used in making [[Portland cement]] (made mostly of calcium silicates) which is used in [[mortar (masonry)|building mortar]] and modern [[stucco]], but more importantly, combined with silica sand, and gravel (usually containing silicate minerals such as granite), to make the [[concrete]] that is the basis of most of the very largest industrial building projects of the modern world.&lt;ref name=Greenwood356&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

Silica is used to make [[fire brick]], a type of ceramic. Silicate minerals are also in whiteware [[ceramic]]s, an important class of products usually containing various types of fired [[clay]] minerals (natural aluminium phyllosilicates). An example is [[porcelain]], which is based on the silicate mineral [[kaolinite]]. Traditional [[glass]] (silica-based [[soda-lime glass]]) also functions in many of the same ways, and also is used for windows and containers. In addition, specialty silica based [[glass fiber]]s are used for [[optical fiber]], as well as to produce [[fiberglass]] for structural support and [[glass wool]] for thermal insulation.

Silicones often are used in [[waterproofing]] treatments, [[molding (process)|molding]] compounds, mold-[[release agent]]s, mechanical seals, high temperature [[lubricant|greases]] and waxes, and [[caulking]] compounds. Silicone is also sometimes used in [[breast implant]]s, contact lenses, [[explosive]]s and [[pyrotechnics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/prep.200700021 |title=Special Materials in Pyrotechnics: VI.

Silicon is a component of some [[superalloy]]s.

=== Alloys ===
Elemental silicon is added to molten [[cast iron]] as [[ferrosilicon]] or silicocalcium alloys to improve performance in casting thin sections and to prevent the formation of [[cementite]] where exposed to outside air. The presence of elemental silicon in molten iron acts as a sink for oxygen, so that the steel carbon content, which must be kept within narrow limits for each type of steel, can be more closely controlled. Ferrosilicon production and use is a monitor of the steel industry, and although this form of elemental silicon is grossly impure, it accounts for 80% of the world's use of free silicon. Silicon is an important constituent of [[electrical steel]], modifying its [[resistivity]] and [[ferromagnetic]] properties.

The properties of silicon may be used to modify alloys with metals other than iron. "Metallurgical grade" silicon is silicon of 95–99% purity. About 55% of the world consumption of metallurgical purity silicon goes for production of aluminium-silicon alloys ([[silumin]] alloys) for aluminium part [[Casting|casts]], mainly for use in the [[automotive industry]]. Silicon's importance in aluminium casting is that a significantly high amount (12%) of silicon in aluminium forms a [[eutectic mixture]] which solidifies with very little thermal contraction. This greatly reduces tearing and cracks formed from stress as casting alloys cool to solidity. Silicon also significantly improves the hardness and thus wear-resistance of aluminium.&lt;ref name="diecasting"&gt;Apelian, D. (2009) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120106013105/http://www.diecasting.org/research/wwr/WWR_AluminumCastAlloys.pdf Aluminum Cast Alloys: Enabling Tools for Improved Performance].

===Electronics===

[[File:Silicon wafer with mirror finish.jpg|thumb|Silicon wafer with mirror finish]]

Most elemental silicon produced remains as a ferrosilicon alloy, and only approximately 20% is refined to metallurgical grade purity (a total of 1.3–1.5 million metric tons/year). An estimated 15% of the world production of metallurgical grade silicon is further refined to semiconductor purity.&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt; This typically is the "nine-9" or 99.9999999% purity,&lt;ref&gt;"Semi" SemiSource 2006: A supplement to Semiconductor International. December 2005. Reference Section: ''How to Make a Chip.'' Adapted from Design News. Reed Electronics Group.&lt;/ref&gt; nearly defect-free single [[crystalline]] material.&lt;ref&gt;SemiSource 2006: A supplement to Semiconductor International. December 2005. Reference Section: ''How to Make a Chip.'' Adapted from Design News. Reed Electronics Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Monocrystalline silicon]] of such purity is usually produced by the [[Czochralski process]], is used to produce [[Wafer (electronics)|silicon wafers]] used in the [[semiconductor industry]], in electronics, and in some high-cost and high-efficiency [[photovoltaic]] applications.&lt;ref name=Ullmann590&gt;Zulehner et al., p. 590&lt;/ref&gt; Pure silicon is an [[intrinsic semiconductor]], which means that unlike metals, it conducts [[electron hole]]s and electrons released from atoms by heat; silicon's [[electrical conductivity]] increases with higher temperatures. Pure silicon has too low a conductivity (i.e., too high a [[resistivity]]) to be used as a circuit element in electronics. In practice, pure silicon is [[doping (semiconductors)|doped]] with small concentrations of certain other elements, which greatly increase its conductivity and adjust its electrical response by controlling the number and charge ([[electron hole|positive]] or [[electron|negative]]) of activated carriers. Such control is necessary for [[transistor]]s, [[solar cell]]s, [[semiconductor detector]]s, and other [[semiconductor device]]s used in the computer industry and other technical applications.&lt;ref name=Ullmann573&gt;Zulehner et al., p. 573&lt;/ref&gt; In [[silicon photonics]], silicon may be used as a continuous wave [[Raman laser]] medium to produce coherent light.&lt;ref name="dekker_2008" &gt;{{cite journal |title=Ultrafast nonlinear all-optical processes in silicon-on-insulator waveguides |journal=[[Journal of Physics D]] |year=2008 |volume=40 |issue=14 |page=R249–R271 |doi=10.1088/0022-3727/40/14/r01

In common [[integrated circuit]]s, a wafer of monocrystalline silicon serves as a mechanical support for the circuits, which are created by doping and insulated from each other by thin layers of [[silicon dioxide|silicon oxide]], an insulator that is easily produced on Si surfaces by processes of [[Thermal Oxidation]] or [[LOCOS|Local Oxidation (LOCOS)]], which involve exposing the element to oxygen under the proper conditions that can be predicted by the [[Deal–Grove model]]. Silicon has become the most popular material for both high power semiconductors and integrated circuits because it can withstand the highest temperatures and greatest electrical activity without suffering [[avalanche breakdown]] (an [[electron avalanche]] is created when heat produces free electrons and holes, which in turn pass more current, which produces more heat). In addition, the insulating oxide of silicon is not soluble in water, which gives it an advantage over [[germanium]] (an element with similar properties which can also be used in semiconductor devices) in certain fabrication techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpoweruk.com/semiconductors.htm Semiconductors Without the Quantum Physics]. Electropaedia&lt;/ref&gt;

Monocrystalline silicon is expensive to produce, and is usually justified only in production of integrated circuits, where tiny crystal imperfections can interfere with tiny circuit paths. For other uses, other types of pure silicon may be employed. These include [[hydrogenated amorphous silicon]] and upgraded metallurgical-grade silicon (UMG-Si) used in the production of low-cost, [[large-area electronics]] in applications such as [[liquid crystal display]]s and of large-area, low-cost, thin-film [[solar cells]]. Such semiconductor grades of silicon are either slightly less pure or polycrystalline rather than monocrystalline, and are produced in comparable quantities as the monocrystalline silicon: 75,000 to 150,000 metric tons per year. The market for the lesser grade is growing more quickly than for monocrystalline silicon. By 2013, polycrystalline silicon production, used mostly in solar cells, was projected to reach 200,000 metric tons per year, while monocrystalline semiconductor grade silicon was expected to remain less than 50,000 tons per year.&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;Corathers, Lisa A.

==Biological role==
[[File:20110123 185042 Diatom.jpg|right|thumb|A diatom, enclosed in a silica cell wall]]
Although silicon is readily available in the form of [[silicate]]s, very few organisms use it directly. [[Diatom]]s, [[radiolaria]], and [[siliceous sponge]]s use [[biogenic silica]] as a structural material for their skeletons. In more advanced plants, the silica [[phytolith]]s (opal phytoliths) are rigid microscopic bodies occurring in the cell; some plants, for example [[rice]], need silicon for their growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Silicon |page=856 |isbn=978-0-444-53181-0 |title=Studies in Natural Products Chemistry |volume=35 |first=Atta-ur- |last=Rahman|date=2008-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abd"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Exley |first1=C. |title=Silicon in life:A bioinorganic solution to bioorganic essentiality |journal=Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry |volume=69 |pages=139–144 |date=1998 |doi=10.1016/S0162-0134(97)10010-1 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plants"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Epstein |first1=Emanuel |title=SILICON |journal=Annual Review of Plant Physiology and Plant Molecular Biology |volume=50 |date=1999 |pmid=15012222 |doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.50.1.641 |pages=641–664}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silicon has been shown to improve plant cell wall strength and structural integrity in some plants.&lt;ref name=Kim2002&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1094/PHYTO.2002.92.10.1095 |pmid=18944220 |title=Silicon-Induced Cell Wall Fortification of Rice Leaves: A Possible Cellular Mechanism of Enhanced Host Resistance to Blast |journal=Phytopathology |volume=92| issue=10 |pages=1095–103 |year=2002 |last1=Kim |first1=Sang Gyu |last2=Kim |first2=Ki Woo |last3=Park |first3=Eun Woo |last4=Choi |first4=Doil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tigo Energy''' is an American private corporation, headquartered in [[Los Gatos, California]], United States. It provides products, technologies, software and services to installers, distributors, and original equipment manufacturers within the [[photovoltaic industry]].  It specializes in module-level [[power optimizer]]s and [[smart module]] [[power electronics]].

Tigo® is a Silicon Valley company founded in 2007 by a team of experienced technologists. Combining a unique systems-level approach with expertise in semiconductors, power electronics, and solar energy, the Tigo team developed the first-generation Smart Module Optimizer technology for the solar industry. Tigo's vision is to leverage integrated and retrofitted Flex MLPE (module-level power electronics) and communications technology to drive the cost of solar electricity down. By partnering with tier 1 module and inverter manufacturers in the industry, Tigo is able to focus on its key innovation with the smartest TS4 modular platform and leverage the broader ecosystem. Tigo has operations in the USA, across Europe, Latin America, Japan, China, Australia and the Middle East.

Tigo Energy is not affiliated with [[Millicom International Cellular]], also known as Tigo.

==History==
The company was founded by Sam Arditi and Ron Hadar in 2007. As of May 2017, it employs ~75 people in ~10 offices worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444734804578063163908128462 |title=The Top 10 Venture-Backed Green Companies - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, the company announced its fourth round of funding, an $18&amp;nbsp;million investment led by Bessemer Ventures.&lt;ref name="gigaom1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2011/12/12/tigo-ramps-up-funds-and-production-of-solar-electronics/ |title=Tigo ramps up funds and production of solar electronics — Tech News and Analysis |publisher=Gigaom.com |date=2011-12-12 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, Tigo Energy announced an award from the [[United States Department of Energy]] as part of its SunShot incubator projects worth $3.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/sunshot/incubator_projects.html |title=SunShot Initiative: SunShot Incubator Projects |publisher=.eere.energy.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The projects are designed to reduce the ongoing costs and prevent safety hazards from [[electric arcs]] in photovoltaic arrays.

In 2012 Tigo Energy announced the market launch of its newest generation of technology designed to be built directly into [[solar panels]] during manufacturing.  These [[smart module]]s included all the benefits of traditional [[power optimizer]]s, but without requiring installers to add extra boxes to solar modules.  Tigo Energy's launch partners included [[Trina Solar]], [[Hanwha SolarOne]], [[DelSolar]], [[Astronergy]], Upsolar, and Luxor Solar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tigoenergy.com/press-releases/leading-solar-module-oems-display-next-generation-tigo-energy-technology-during-pv |title=Leading Solar Module OEMs To Display Next-generation Tigo Energy Technology During PV Expo Japan |publisher=Tigo Energy |date=2012-02-28 |accessdate=2013-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812095050/http://www.tigoenergy.com/press-releases/leading-solar-module-oems-display-next-generation-tigo-energy-technology-during-pv |archivedate=2012-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012 IMS Research identified Tigo Energy as one of three suppliers accounting for 90% of the [[micro-inverter]] and power optimizer market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imsresearch.com/news-events/press-template.php?pr_id=3056 |title=Microinverters &amp; Power Optimizers Outpace PV Inverters in 2011 – 70 percent Growth Predicted in 2012 |publisher=IMS Research |date=2012-09-04 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science and technology==
Tigo Energy uses [[impedance matching]] to provide power control, data monitoring and safety mechanisms for every module in a solar array to increase performance and safety over traditional system-level technologies.&lt;ref name="gigaom1"/&gt;  The company also hosts customer data and provides detailed analytics with a [[software as a service]] business model.

The company was the first power optimizer to successfully certify embedding their electronics directly into the junction box of a solar module, reducing the component and labor costs of optimized photovoltaic arrays and eliminating the need for additional hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-electronics-panel-integration-and-the-bankability-challenge |title=Solar Electronics, Panel Integration and the Bankability Challenge |publisher=Greentech Media |date=2012-08-23 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tritonal''' is a mixture of 80% [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] and 20% [[aluminium]] [[Powder (substance)|powder]], used in several types of ordnance such as air-dropped [[bomb]]s. The aluminium improves the total heat output and hence [[Impulse (physics)|impulse]] of the TNT&amp;nbsp;— the length of time during which the blast wave is positive. Tritonal is approximately 18% more powerful than TNT alone.&lt;ref name="llnl.gov"&gt;[https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/241114.pdf J. L. Maienschein; "Estimating Equivalency Of Explosives Through A Thermochemical Approach"; July 8, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 87&amp;nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]] of tritonal in a [[Mark 82 bomb]] has the potential to produce approximately 863&amp;nbsp;[[Joule#Megajoule|MJ]] of energy when detonated.&lt;ref name="llnl.gov"/&gt;
