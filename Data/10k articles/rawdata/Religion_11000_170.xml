AMIT ([[Hebrew]] [[acronym]] for '''Organization for Volunteers for''' Israel '''and [[Torah]]''', [[English language|English]] [[acronym]] for '''''A'''mericans for '''I'''srael and '''T'''orah'', and a [[homonym]] in [[Hebrew]] for [[Amit|friend]]) is an [[American Jews|American Jewish]] [[Volunteering|volunteer]] organization providing Jewish values–based education to 34,000 children in [[Israel]]. AMIT operates 106 schools and two surrogate family residences (youth villages).

The AMIT Network was selected by Israel’s Ministry of Education as the leading Jewish educational network across all measurements, including quality ''bagrut'', pedagogical innovation, pluralism and bridging the gap, lowest dropout rate and integrity.

AMIT’s has not only raised [[bagrut]] scores across the ''reshet'' (“network”), it has also significantly increased the number of students studying math, physics, science and technology subjects at the highest levels. AMIT graduates maintain a high level of military service or national service (95%), and they enter the army and the workforce equipped to meet the challenges of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century.

AMIT maintains a balance of 70% of its schools in Israel’s periphery (disadvantaged areas) and 30% in the more affluent center of Israel. When new schools are admitted to the network, this balance is maintained.

== History ==

AMIT was founded on May 10, 1925, by [https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/amit Bessie Gotsfeld], and was then known as the [[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] Women's Organization of America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amitchildren.org/history.asp source] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407054221/http://www.amitchildren.org/history.asp |date=April 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It officially incorporated on October 2, 1930.&lt;ref name= corp/&gt; As early as 1934, AMIT was at the forefront of Youth children from [[Europe]] and their resettlement in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. In the years ahead, and immediately following the end of the war in Europe, AMIT participated in the resettlement of thousands of children — many of them orphans — who survived the [[Holocaust]].

The survivors of the Holocaust were followed by the large influx of Jews from [[North Africa]] and the Arab countries in 1948-49. Again, AMIT's resources were tested as its facilities were flooded by the pressing needs of tens of thousands of newly arrived immigrant children. In 1955, the first contingent of [[Ethiopian Jews]] arrived and in the 1970s, the great [[Russians|Russian]] immigration began. With each new development in Israel's history AMIT responded, opening new schools and facilities to meet the demands of a growing population of children in need.

In 1981, AMIT was designated by the Israeli government as its official Reshet (network) for religious secondary technological education. This landmark event set the stage for a major expansion of AMIT's educational facilities (which continues to this day) as municipalities with faltering school systems seek out AMIT to take over and dramatically improve their local facilities.

== AMIT Today ==
AMIT operates 110 schools, youth villages, surrogate family residences and other programs, constituting Israel’s only government-recognized network of religious Jewish education incorporating academic and technological studies. AMIT students boast an 85% (''bagrut'') matriculation rate, exceeding the national average of 70% among Israeli Jewish students.{{cn|date=August 2018}} More than 95% of its graduates enlist in the Israel Defense Forces or perform national service.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

===Fundraising===
AMIT schools are funded by local municipalities, Israel's Ministry of Education and generous supporters. It is support from individuals that help take the schools from good to great.

'''''Atropa belladonna''''', commonly known as '''belladonna''' or '''deadly nightshade''', is a [[perennial plant|perennial]] [[herbaceous plant]] in the nightshade family [[Solanaceae]], which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and [[eggplant]] (aubergine).  It is native to [[Europe]], [[North Africa]], and [[Western Asia]]. Its distribution extends from [[Great Britain]] in the west to western [[Ukraine]] and the [[Iran]]ian province of [[Gilan]] in the east. It is also naturalised and/or introduced in some parts of Canada and the United States.

== Description ==
[[Image:Atropa bella-donna1.jpg|thumb|left|''Atropa belladonna'']]

''Atropa belladonna'' is a branching [[herbaceous]] perennial [[rhizomatous]] [[hemicryptophyte]], often growing as a [[subshrub]] from a fleshy rootstock. Plants grow to {{cvt|2|m|ft}} tall with ovate leaves {{cvt|18|cm|in}} long. The bell-shaped [[flower]]s are dull purple with green tinges and faintly scented. The [[fruit]]s are [[berry (botany)|berries]], which are green, ripening to a shiny-black, and approximately {{cvt|1.5|cm|in}} in diameter. The berries are sweet and are consumed by animals that disperse the [[seed]]s in their droppings, even though they contain toxic [[alkaloid]]s. (See ''[[#Toxicity|Toxicity]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kay QON |title=Edible fruits in a cool climate: the evolution and ecology of endozoochory in the European flora | work= Fruit and Seed Production: Aspects of Development, Environmental Physiology and Ecology ''(Society for Experimental Biology Seminar Series)''| editor-first1= C. | editor-last1= Marshall | editor-first2= J. | editor-last2= Grace| publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2008 |pages=240 |isbn=0-521-05045-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a pale-yellow flowering form called ''Atropa belladonna'' var. ''lutea'' with pale yellow fruit.

==Distribution==
''Atropa belladonna'' is native to temperate southern, Central and Eastern Europe; [[North Africa]], [[Turkey]], [[Iran]] and the [[Caucasus]], but has been cultivated and introduced outside its native range. In southern Sweden it was recorded in Flora of Skåne in 1870 as grown in [[apothecary]] gardens near Malmö.&lt;ref name=Hylander&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hylander|first=N. |date=1971 |title=Prima loca plantarum vascularium Sueciae.

Förvildade eller i senare tid inkomna växter. |journal=Svensk Botanisk Tidskrift |volume=64 |pages=332 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain it is native only on calcareous soils, on disturbed ground, field margins, hedgerows and open woodland. More widespread as an alien, it is often a relic of cultivation as a medicinal herb. Seed is spread mainly by birds.&lt;ref name=BSBI&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.brc.ac.uk/plantatlas/index.php?q=plant/atropa-belladonna |publisher=Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI) |title=Online Atlas of the British and Irish Flora: Atropa belladonna (Deadly nightshade) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]] in parts of [[North America]], where it is often found in shady, moist locations with [[limestone]]-rich [[soil]]s. It is considered a [[weed]] species in parts of the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=ATBE |title=PLANTS Profile for ''Atropa bella-donna'' (belladonna) &amp;#124; USDA PLANTS |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it colonizes areas with disturbed soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stepp JR |title=The role of weeds as sources of pharmaceuticals |journal=J Ethnopharmacol |volume=92 |issue=2–3 |pages=163–6 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15137997 |doi=10.1016/j.jep.2004.03.002 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==
''Atropa belladonna'' is rarely used in gardens, but, when grown, it is usually for its large upright [[habit (biology)|habit]] and showy berries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Stuart, David |title=Dangerous garden: the quest for plants to change our lives |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2004 |pages=49 |isbn=0-674-01104-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Germination]] of the small seeds is often difficult, due to hard seed coats that cause seed [[dormancy]]. Germination takes several weeks under alternating temperature conditions, but can be sped up with the use of [[gibberellic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Genova E, Komitska G, Beeva Y |title=Study on the germination of ''Atropa Bella-donna'' L. seeds|url=http://www.bio21.bas.bg/ipp/gapbfiles/v-23/97_1-2_61-66.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Bulgarian Journal of Plant Physiology|volume=23|issue=1–2|pages=61–66|year=1997|accessdate=2008-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seedlings need [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] [[soil]] to prevent [[damping off]] and resent root disturbance during transplanting.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The name ''Atropa belladonna'' was published by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.ipni.org/ipni/idPlantNameSearch.do?id=814358-1 | title = Solanaceae Atropa belladonna L. | accessdate = 2008-03-01 | date = 2003-07-02 | work = Plant Name Details | publisher = [[International Plant Names Index|IPNI]] | quote = Solanaceae ''Atropa belladonna'' L.

The common names for this species include belladonna, deadly nightshade, divale, dwale,&lt;ref name="spiegl"/&gt; banewort, devil's berries, naughty man's cherries, death cherries, beautiful death, devil's herb, great morel, and dwayberry.&lt;ref name="Grieve"&gt;{{cite book | last = Grieve | first = Margaret |author2= Leyel, C.

The name ''Atropa'' is derived from that of the Greek goddess [[Atropos]] - 'she who may not be turned aside' i.e. 'the implacable' - one of the three [[Moirai|Greek fates or destinies]] who would determine the course of a man's life by the weaving of threads that symbolized his birth, the events in his life, and finally his death, with Atropos cutting these threads to mark the last of these.&lt;ref name="harris"/&gt;&lt;ref name="groombridge"/&gt; The name "belladonna" comes from the [[Italian language]], meaning "beautiful lady";&lt;ref name="spiegl"&gt;{{cite book |author=Spiegl, Fritz |title=Fritz Spiegl's Sick Notes: An Alphabetical Browsing-Book of Derivatives, Abbreviations, Mnemonics and Slang for Amusement and Edification of Medics, Nurses, Patients and Hypochondriacs |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location=Washington, DC |year=1996 |pages=21–22 |isbn=1-85070-627-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_CbA5a0u5E0C&amp;pg=PA21&amp;vq=belladonna&amp;dq=fritz+Spiegl's+Sick+Notes:+An+Alphabetical+Browsing-Book+of+Derivatives,+Abbreviations,+Mnemonics+and+Slang+for+Amusemen}}&lt;/ref&gt; originating either from its usage as cosmetic for the face or, more probably, from its usage to increase the pupil size in women.&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Homoeopathic Vade Mecum of Modern Medicine and Surgery: For the Use of Junior Practitioners, Students, Clergymen, Missionaries, Heads of Families, Etc | author=[[Edward Harris Ruddock]] | edition=2 | publisher=[[Jarrold and Sons]] |year=1867 | pages=503–508 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=sxADAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA502&amp;dq=belladonna+atropos+date:0-1900 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="groombridge"&gt;{{cite book | title =The Naturalist: Illustrative of the Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral Kingdoms | editor = R.

== Uses ==

=== Cosmetics ===

The common name ''belladonna'' originates from its historic use by women, as ''bella donna'' is [[Italian language|Italian]] for "beautiful lady". Drops prepared from the belladonna plant were used to [[mydriasis|dilate]] women's [[pupil]]s, an effect considered to be attractive and seductive.&lt;ref name="Hofmann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tombs" /&gt; Belladonna drops act as a [[muscarinic antagonist]], blocking receptors in the muscles of the eye that constrict pupil size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/medicines/100002958.html |title= Atropine Eye Drops |work= |accessdate=2008-07-08 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080708050653/http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/medicines/100002958.html |archivedate= 8 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belladonna is currently rarely used cosmetically, as it carries the [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]] of causing minor visual distortions, inability to focus on near objects, and increased heart rate. Prolonged usage was reputed to cause [[blindness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Wood, George Bacon |title= A Treatise on Therapeutics, and Pharmacology or Materia Medica |volume= Vol.&amp;nbsp;1 |publisher= J.B.

=== Medicinal uses ===

Scientific evidence to recommend the use of ''A. belladonna'' in its natural form for any condition is insufficient,&lt;ref name=nsreview/&gt;&lt;ref name=mp2015/&gt; although some of its components, in particular ''l''-[[atropine]], which was purified from belladonna in the 1830s, have accepted medical uses.&lt;ref name="pmid17575737" /&gt; [[Donnatal]] is a [[prescription drug|prescription]] [[pharmaceutical]], approved in the United States by the [[United States Food and Drug Administration|FDA]], that combines natural belladonna alkaloids in a specific, fixed ratio with phenobarbital to provide peripheral [[anticholinergic]]/[[antispasmodic]] action and mild sedation. According to its [[Package insert|labeling]], it is possibly effective for use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of [[irritable bowel syndrome]] (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and acute [[enterocolitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donnatal.com/prescribing-info.aspx |title=Donnatal Extentabs Prescribing Information |year=2009 |publisher=PBM Pharmaceuticals |accessdate=2009-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227100747/http://www.donnatal.com/prescribing-info.aspx |archivedate=2008-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belladonna has been used in [[herbal medicine]] for centuries as a pain reliever, muscle relaxer, and anti-inflammatory, and to treat menstrual problems, peptic ulcer disease, histaminic reaction, and motion sickness.&lt;ref name=nsreview/&gt;&lt;ref name=mp2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Ebadi, Manuchair|title=Pharmacodynamic Basis of Herbal Medicine|publisher=CRC Press|year=2007|isbn=9780849370502|page=203|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CMJKgfhCKzIC&amp;pg=PA203}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one 19th-century [[eclectic medicine]] journal explained how to prepare a belladonna tincture for direct administration to patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal =The Eclectic Medical Journal |author1=Joseph R. Buchanan |author2=R.S. Newton | editor = Wm.

Phillips and co. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belladonna [[tincture]]s, [[decoction]]s, and powders, as well as alkaloid salt mixtures, are still produced for pharmaceutical use, and these are often standardised at 1037 parts [[hyoscyamine]] to 194 parts [[atropine]] and 65 parts [[scopolamine]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}  The alkaloids are compounded with [[phenobarbital]] and/or kaolin and pectin for use in various functional gastrointestinal disorders.  The tincture, used for identical purposes, remains in most pharmacopoeias, with a similar tincture of ''[[Datura stramonium]]'' having been in the US Pharmacopoeia at least until the late 1930s.  Cigarettes with belladonna leaves soaked in opium tincture were a prescription medicine as recently as 1930.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The combination of belladonna and [[opium]], in powder, tincture, or alkaloid form, is particularly useful by mouth or as a suppository for diarrhoea and some forms of visceral pain; it can be made by a compounding pharmacist, and may be available as a manufactured fixed combination product in some countries (e.g., [[B&amp;O Supprettes]]).

Scopolamine is used as the hydrobromide salt for gastrointestinal complaints and motion sickness, and to potentiate the analgesic and anxiolytic effects of opioid analgesics. It was formerly used in a painkiller called "[[twilight sleep]]" in childbirth.&lt;ref name="PMID_20310688"&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Atropine sulphate]] is used as a [[mydriatic]] and [[cycloplegic]] for eye examinations. It is also used as an antidote to [[organophosphate]] and [[carbamate]] poisoning, and is loaded in an autoinjector for use in case of a [[nerve gas]] attack.  Atropinisation (administration of a sufficient dose to block nerve gas effects) results in 100 percent blockade of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and atropine sulphate is the benchmark for measuring the power of anticholinergic drugs.

Hyoscyamine is used as the sulphate or hydrobromide for gastrointestinal problems and Parkinson's disease. Its side-effect profile is intermediate to those of atropine and scopolamine, and can also be used to combat the toxic effects of organophosphates. Hyoscyamine was the primary alkaloid in [[Asthmador]], a nonprescription treatment for the relief of bronchial asthma, that is no longer made.

=== Recreational drug ===
''Atropa belladonna'' and related plants, such as ''[[Datura stramonium]]'' (commonly known as jimson weed or jimsonweed), have occasionally been used as  [[recreational drug]]s because of the vivid [[hallucination]]s and delirium they produce.  However, these hallucinations are most commonly described as very unpleasant, and recreational use is considered extremely dangerous because of the high risk of unintentional fatal [[drug overdose|overdose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dewitt MS, Swain R, Gibson LB |title=The dangers of jimson weed and its abuse by teenagers in the Kanawha Valley of West Virginia |journal= West Virginia Medical Journal |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=182–5 |year=1997 |pmid=9274142 |doi= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Micke MM |title=The case of hallucinogenic plants and the Internet |journal=J Sch Health |volume=66 |issue=8 |pages=277–80 |date=October 1996 |pmid=8899584 |doi= 10.1111/j.1746-1561.1996.tb03397.x|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cummins BM, Obetz SW, Wilson MR |title=Belladonna poisoning as a facet of pschyodelia |journal=JAMA |volume=204 |issue=11 |pages=1011 |date=June 1968 |pmid=5694682 |doi= 10.1001/jama.204.11.1011|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the central nervous system effects of atropine include memory disruption, which may lead to severe confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hardy TK, Wakely D |title=The amnesic properties of hyoscine and atropine in pre-anæsthetic medication |journal=Anaesthesia |pages=331–336 |year=1962 |pmid=13904669 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2044.1962.tb13473.x |volume=17 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major effects of belladonna consumption last for three to four hours, visual hallucinations can last for three to four days, and some negative aftereffects are preserved for several days.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Belladonna.shtml|title=Belladonna Reports.|last=|first=|date=|website=erowid|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of belladonna as a recreational drug is reported to bring about predominantly bad trips that the users want never to repeat for as long as they live.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Trips induced by belladonna are threatening, dark, demonic, hellish, frightening, and terrifying.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Occasionally, belladonna can induce [[out-of-body experience]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=2973|title=Total Out Of Body Experience.Atropa belladonna.|last=|first=|date=|website=erowid|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a heightened sense of awareness,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=17696|title=A Heightened Sense of Awareness.

Historically, the plant was an important, active ingredient in witches' [[flying ointment]]s : complex, transdermally-absorbed hallucinogens with a fatty or oily base, which caused a deathlike trance in which vivid hallucinations of flight and bacchanalian carousal were experienced&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Harold A.

=== Poison ===
The tropane alkaloids of ''A. belladonna'' were used as poisons, and early humans made [[Arrow poison|poisonous arrows]] from the plant.&lt;ref name=Michael1998&gt;{{Cite book| last = Michael| year = 1998| title = Alkaloids : biochemistry, ecology, and medicinal applications| pages = 20| url = https://books.google.com/?id=bMCzyrAtrvYC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=hallucinogenic++Atropa+belladonna| isbn = 0-306-45465-3| publisher = Plenum Press| location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Rome]], it was used as a poison by [[Agrippina the Younger]], wife of Emperor [[Claudius]] on the advice of [[Locusta]], a woman who specialized in poisons, and [[Livia]], who is rumored to have used it to kill her husband Emperor [[Augustus]].&lt;ref name=Michael1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Timbrell2005&gt;{{Cite book| last = Timbrell | first =  John| year = 2005| title = The poison paradox : chemicals as friends and foes| pages = 2| url = https://books.google.com/?id=qYYOtQU37jcC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=poisons+used+my+the+wife+of+Claudius| isbn = 0-19-280495-2| publisher = Oxford Univ.

Medical historians also suspect that [[Solomon Northup]], a free black man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in 1841, was poisoned using a combination of ''Atropa belladonna'' and [[laudanum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/804847817|title=Twelve years a slave|last=1808-1863?|first=Northup, Solomon,|date=1975|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|others=Eakin, Sue L.,, Logsdon, Joseph,|isbn=9780807101506|edition=Louisiana pbk.|location=Baton Rouge|oclc=804847817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flying ointment===
In the past, witches were believed to use a mixture of belladonna, [[opium poppy]] and other plants, typically poisonous (such as [[monkshood]] and [[poison hemlock]]), in [[flying ointment]], which they applied to help them fly to gatherings with other witches. [[Carlo Ginzburg]] and others have argued that flying ointments were preparations meant to encourage hallucinatory dreaming; a possible explanation for the inclusion of belladonna and opium poppy in flying ointments concerns the known antagonism between tropane alkaloids of belladonna ([[scopolamine]]) and opiate alkaloids in the opium poppy, ''[[Papaver somniferum]]'' (to be specific, morphine), which produces a dream-like waking state. This antagonism was known in folk medicine, discussed in [[traditional medicine]] formularies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.henriettesherbal.com/eclectic/kings/atropa.html |title=Belladonna.—Belladonna |work= Henrietta's Herbal|accessdate=2008-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kuklin | first = Alexander | title = How Do Witches Fly?| publisher = DNA Press |date=February 1999 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-9664027-0-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The belladonna herb was also notable for its unpredictable effects from toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kowalchik | first = Claire |author2=Carr A Hylton W | title = Herb gardening | publisher = Rodale | year = 1987 | location = | pages = 1 and 158 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=htGD3Y7WNxwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Atropa+belladonna | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-87596-964-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Harner, Michael J. |title=Hallucinogens and Shamanism |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1973 |pages=123–150 |isbn=0-19-501649-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female attractiveness===
Among the ancient folk traditions of the [[Romania]]n ([[Moldavia]]n) / [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] region of [[Bukovina]] in the [[Carpathians]] is the ritual for a Bukovinian girl to enhance her attractiveness by making an offering to deadly nightshade. She entered the fields on a Sunday in [[Shrovetide]], clad in her [[Christian clothing|Sunday best]], accompanied by her mother and bringing a bag of bread, salt, and [[brandy]]. She would dig up a deadly nightshade root and leave the three offerings in its place. As she returned home, she carried the root on the top of her head. On the way both to and from home, she avoided all quarrels and arguments. If asked by anyone on the way back what she was taking home, she would not divulge the truth or the [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]] would break.&lt;ref&gt;Schenk, Gustav ''Das Buch der Gifte'' translated by Michael Bullock as ''The Book of Poisons'' pub. Weidenfeld and Nicolson 1956 page 28, quoting Hovorka, Oskar von and Kronfeld, Adolf : ''Vergleichende Volksmedizin Zweiter Band. Eine Darstellung volksmedizinische Sitten und Gebräuche, Anschauungen und Heilfaktoren des Aberglaubens und der Zaubermedizin'' [Translation : ''Comparative Folk Medicine, a study in two volumes: an account of the ethnomedical practices, habits of thought and healing practices to be found in Superstition and Magical Medicine''] 2 vols., pub.

==Etymology==
''Atropa'' means "inflexible" or "implacable", and is derived from the Greek [[Atropos]], the name of one of the three [[Moirai]]. ''Belladonna'' is derived from Italian, meaning "beautiful lady". The juice of ''A. belladonna'' was applied as a decoction to beautify by inducing pallid skin and dilated eyes.&lt;ref name="gledhill"&gt;Gledhill, David (2008). ''The Names of Plants''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6515">'''Balthasar Walther''' (1558 – c. 1631) was a [[Silesia]]n physician and [[Christian Kabbalist]] of German ethnicity. Born in [[Liegnitz]] in modern Poland, Walther was a significant influence on the thought of the German [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosopher]] [[Jakob Böhme]]. As an itinerant [[Paracelsian]] enthusiast, Walther was active throughout the [[Holy Roman Empire]], in [[Poland]], [[Transylvania]] and elsewhere. He died in [[Paris]] sometime before December 1631.

==Biography==
Born in [[Liegnitz]], [[Silesia]], Walther attended the University of Frankfurt/Oder where he studied medicine. A gifted student and an evident enthusiast of [[Paracelsus|Paracelsian]] medicine, he thereafter received a series of appointments to Ducal courts throughout the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as a physician, [[alchemy|alchemist]] and laboratory technician.
Intensely interested in magic and kabbalistic wisdom, early in his life Walther collected several magical tracts, the manuscripts of which survive in European libraries to this day. In order to deepen his acquaintance with kabbalistic and magical teachings, between 1597 and 1599 Walther traveled to Africa and the [[Holy Land]] in order to learn at the feet of Jewish and Arab practitioners. Several years after his return to Europe, he made the acquaintance of [[Jakob Böhme]], probably in late 1617. In 1612 he became a close friend of Boehme. In 1619-20 he studied with Boehme. Along with the likes of the [[Torgau]] chiliast [[Paul Nagel (mystic)|Paul Nagel]],&lt;ref&gt;Leigh T.I. Penman, 'Climbing Jacob's Ladder: Crisis, Chiliasm, and Transcendence in the Thought of Paul Nagel (†1624), a Lutheran Dissident during the Time of the Thirty Years' War.' ''Intellectual History Review'' 20/2 (2010), 201-226&lt;/ref&gt; Walther became a fiery propagandist and promoter of Böhme's work, although for several years he was torn between Böhme's doctrines and those of Böhme's arch-rival, the [[antinomian]] [[Esajas Stiefel]]. After several years of proselytizing on Böhme's behalf, Walther died in Paris, probably before 1631.

==Works by Walther==
A complete bibliography of Walther's printed works can be found in a recent article.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh T.I. Penman, ‘A Second Christian Rosencreuz? Jakob Böhme’s Disciple Balthasar Walther (1558-c.1630) and the Kabbalah. With a Bibliography of Walther’s Printed Works.’ ''Western Esotericism. Selected Papers Read at the Symposium on Western Esotericism held at Åbo, Finland, on 15–17 August 2007.'' (Scripta instituti donneriani Aboensis, XX). T. Ahlbäck, ed. Åbo, Finland: Donner Institute, 2008: 154-172. ({{ISBN|9789521220821}})&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his influence, as well as his enthusiasm for kabbalistic and magical tracts, Walther himself only composed two major works, neither of which reflected these interests to any great extent:
*''Ode | Dicolos Tetrastrophos, totum re-|demtionis opus, à Christo Seruatore nostro hu-|mano generi praestitum, breuiter com-|plectens'' ... (Zerbst: Faber, 1585). A devotional poetic work.
*''BREVIS ET VERA | DESCRIPTIO | RERVM AB | ILLVST. AMPLISS. | ET FORTISS. MILITIAE | CON-|trapatriæ suæ Reiq[ue] Pub. Christianæ hostes | Duce ac Dn. Dn. Jön Michaele, Mol-|dawiæ Transalpinæ sive VValachiæ | Palatino gestarum, | In eiusdem aula Tervvisana fideliter collecta | opera &amp; studio.'' (Görlitz: Rhambau, 1599). A biography of the [[Wallachia]]n Prince [[Michael the Brave]].
A third work, although actually written by Jakob Böhme, was inspired by 40 questions proposed to the philosopher by Walther himself concerning the nature of the human soul. It seems clear that Walther's interests influenced the content of Böhme's responses. The first edition of these ''Forty Questions on the Soul'' (to use its English title) was provided by [[Johann Angelius Werdenhagen]], a friend of Walther, shortly after the physician's death in Paris:
*''Ψυχολογια Vera I. B. T. XL Quæstionibus explicata, et rerum publicarum vero regimini: ac earum Maiestatico iuri applicata, a Iohanne Angelio Werdenhagen I.C.C.'' (Amsterdam: Jansson, 1632).

==Biographical Studies and Secondary Literature==
Despite his significance to and influence upon the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] of [[Jakob Böhme]], Walther has attracted little scholarly attention and remained something of a historical cipher. A contemporary biographical account, printed within 20 years following Walther's death is provided in:

'''''Chariots of Fire''''' is a 1981 British [[historical period drama|historical drama film]]. It tells the fact-based story of two athletes in the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]]: [[Eric Liddell]], a devout Scottish Christian who runs for the glory of God, and [[Harold Abrahams]], an English Jew who runs to overcome prejudice.

The film was conceived and produced by [[David Puttnam]], written by [[Colin Welland]], and directed by [[Hugh Hudson]]. [[Ben Cross]] and [[Ian Charleson]] starred as Abrahams and Liddell, alongside [[Nigel Havers]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Cheryl Campbell]], and [[Alice Krige]] in supporting roles.

It was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]] and won four, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. It is ranked 19th in the [[British Film Institute]]'s list of [[BFI Top 100 British films|Top 100 British films]]. The film is also notable for its memorable [[Chariots of Fire (album)|electronic theme tune]] by [[Vangelis]], who won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]].

The film's title was inspired by the line, "Bring me my chariot of fire," from the [[William Blake]] poem adapted into the popular British hymn [[And did those feet in ancient time|"Jerusalem"]]; the hymn is heard at the end of the film.&lt;ref&gt;Dans, Peter E. [https://books.google.com/books?id=52GpN0Hzxd8C&amp;pg=PA222&amp;dq=colin+welland+jerusalem+%22chariots+of+fire%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3EdJTPqqKovSsAP97PFI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=colin%20welland%20jerusalem%20%22chariots%20of%20fire%22&amp;f=false ''Christians in the Movies: A Century of Saints and Sinners''.] Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2009. p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; The original phrase "chariot(s) of fire" is from [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/2 Kings#2:11|2:11]] and [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/2 Kings#6:17|6:17]] in the Bible.

==Plot==
In 1919, [[Harold Abrahams]] ([[Ben Cross]]) enters the [[University of Cambridge]], where he experiences [[anti-Semitism]] from the staff, but enjoys participating in the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] club. He becomes the first person to ever complete the [[Trinity Great Court#The Great Court Run|Trinity Great Court Run]], running around the college courtyard in the time it takes for the clock to strike 12, and achieves an undefeated string of victories in various national running competitions. Although focused on his running, he falls in love with a leading Gilbert and Sullivan soprano, Sybil ([[Alice Krige]]).

[[Eric Liddell]] ([[Ian Charleson]]), born in China of Scottish missionary parents, is in Scotland. His devout sister Jennie ([[Cheryl Campbell]]) disapproves of Liddell's plans to pursue competitive running, but Liddell sees running as a way of glorifying God before returning to China to work as a missionary.

When they first race against each other, Liddell beats Abrahams. Abrahams takes it poorly, but [[Sam Mussabini]] ([[Ian Holm]]), a professional trainer whom he had approached earlier, offers to take him on to improve his technique. This attracts criticism from the Cambridge college masters ([[John Gielgud]] and [[Lindsay Anderson]]), who allege it is not gentlemanly for an amateur to "play the tradesman" by employing a professional coach. Abrahams dismisses this concern, interpreting it as cover for anti-Semitic and class-based prejudice.&lt;!--This is pretty well backed up by Gielgud's character's comments concerning "a Semite", "a different god" etc--&gt;

When Eric Liddell accidentally misses a church prayer meeting because of his running, his sister Jennie upbraids him and accuses him of no longer caring about God. Eric tells her that though he intends to eventually return to the China mission, he feels divinely inspired when running, and that not to run would be to dishonour God, saying, "I believe that God made me for a purpose. But He also made me fast, and when I run, I feel His pleasure."

The two athletes, after years of training and racing, are accepted to represent Great Britain in the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]] in Paris. Also accepted are Abrahams' Cambridge friends, Lord Andrew Lindsay ([[Nigel Havers]]), [[Aubrey Montague]] ([[Nicholas Farrell]]), and [[H. B. Stallard|Henry Stallard]] ([[Daniel Gerroll]]).

While boarding the boat to Paris for the Olympics, Liddell discovers the heats for his 100-metre race will be on a Sunday. He refuses to run the race, despite strong pressure from the [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] and the British Olympic committee, because his Christian convictions prevent him from running on the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]].

Hope appears when Liddell's teammate Lindsay, having already won a silver medal in the [[400 metres hurdles]], proposes to concede his place in the [[400 metres|400-metre race]] on the following Thursday to Liddell, who gratefully agrees. His religious convictions in the face of national athletic pride make headlines around the world.

Liddell delivers a sermon at the Paris [[Church of Scotland]] that Sunday, and quotes from [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Isaiah#Chapter 40|Isaiah 40]], ending with, "But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint."

Abrahams is badly beaten by the heavily favoured United States runners in the 200 metre race. He knows his last chance for a medal will be the 100 metres. He competes in the race, and wins. His coach Sam Mussabini is overcome that the years of dedication and training have paid off with an Olympic gold medal. Now Abrahams can get on with his life and reunite with his girlfriend Sybil, whom he had neglected for the sake of running.

Before Liddell's race, the American coach remarks dismissively to his runners that Liddell has little chance of doing well in his now far longer 400 metre race. But one of the American runners, [[Jackson Scholz]], hands Liddell a note of support for his convictions. Liddell defeats the American favourites and wins the gold medal.

The British team returns home triumphant. As the film ends, onscreen text explains that Abrahams married Sybil, and became the elder statesman of British athletics. Liddell went on to missionary work in China. All of Scotland mourned his death in 1945 in Japanese-occupied China.

== Historical accuracy ==

=== Characters ===
The film depicts Abrahams as attending [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]] with three other Olympic athletes: [[H. B. Stallard|Henry Stallard]], [[Aubrey Montague]], and Lord Andrew Lindsay. Abrahams and Stallard were in fact students there and competed in the 1924 Olympics. Montague also competed in the Olympics as depicted, but he attended Oxford, not Cambridge.&lt;ref name=aubrey&gt;[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/mo/evelyn-montague-1.html Aubrey Montague biography] at SportsReference.com&lt;/ref&gt; Aubrey Montague sent daily letters to his mother about his time at Oxford and the Olympics; these letters were the basis of Montague's narration in the film.

The character of Lindsay was based partially on [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Lord Burghley]], a significant figure in the history of British athletics. Although Burghley did attend Cambridge, he was not a contemporary of Harold Abrahams, as Abrahams was an undergraduate from 1919 to 1923 and Burghley was at Cambridge from 1923 to 1927. One scene in the film depicts the Burghley-based "Lindsay" as practising hurdles on his estate with full champagne glasses placed on each hurdle – this was something the wealthy Burghley did, although he used matchboxes instead of champagne glasses.&lt;ref name=rw /&gt; The fictional character of Lindsay was created when [[Douglas Lowe (athlete)|Douglas Lowe]], who was Britain's third athletics gold medallist in the 1924 Olympics, was not willing to be involved with the film.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, pp. 275, 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cross and Havers.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Harold Abrahams|Abrahams]] (left) and the [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Burghley]]-based Lindsay (right) attempt the [[Trinity Great Court#The Great Court Run|Great Court Run]].]]
Another scene in the film recreates the [[Trinity Great Court#The Great Court Run|Great Court Run]], in which the runners attempt to run around the perimeter of the [[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in the time it takes the clock to strike 12 at midday. The film shows Abrahams performing the feat for the first time in history. In fact, Abrahams never attempted this race, and at the time of filming the only person on record known to have succeeded was [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Lord Burghley]], in 1927. In ''Chariots of Fire'', Lindsay, who is based on Lord Burghley, runs the Great Court Run with Abrahams in order to spur him on, and crosses the finish line just a moment too late. Since the film's release, the Great Court Run has also been successfully run by Trinity undergraduate Sam Dobin, in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-490027/Modern-day-hero-runs-away-Chariots-Fire-challenge.html "Modern-day hero runs away with Chariots of Fire challenge."] ''[[Daily Mail]]'' 27 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film, Eric Liddell is tripped up by a Frenchman in the 400-metre event of a Scotland–France international athletic meeting. He recovers, makes up a 20-metre deficit, and wins. This was based on fact; the actual race was the 440 yards at a Triangular Contest meet between Scotland, England, and Ireland at [[Stoke-on-Trent]] in England in July 1923. His achievement was remarkable as he had already won the 100- and 220-yard events that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramsey|first=Russell W.|title=God's Joyful Runner|publisher=Bridge Publishing, Inc|year=1987|page=54|isbn=0-88270-624-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also unmentioned with regard to Liddell is that it was he who introduced Abrahams to [[Sam Mussabini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0019/ |title=A Sporting Nation: Eric Liddell |publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is alluded to: In the film Abrahams first encounters Mussabini while he is watching Liddell race. The film, however, suggests that Abrahams himself sought Mussabini's assistance.

Abrahams and Liddell did race against each other once, but not quite as depicted in the film, which shows Liddell winning the final of the 100 yards against a shattered Abrahams at the 1923 AAA Championship at Stamford Bridge.  In fact, they raced only in a heat of the 220 yards, which Liddell won, five yards ahead of Abrahams, who did not progress to the final.  In the 100 yards, Abrahams was eliminated in the heats and never raced against Liddell, who won the finals of both races the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCasland|first=David|title=Pure Gold: A New Biography of the Olympic Champion Who Inspired Chariots of Fire|publisher=Discovery House|year=2001|isbn=1572931302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abrahams' fiancée is misidentified as [[Sybil Gordon]], a soprano at the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].  In fact, in 1936, Abrahams married [[Sybil Evers]], who sang at the D'Oyly Carte, but they did not meet until 1934.&lt;ref name=ryan188&gt;Ryan (2012), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the film, Sybil is depicted as singing the role of Yum-Yum in ''[[The Mikado]]'', but neither Sybil Gordon nor Sybil Evers ever sang that role with D'Oyly Carte,&lt;ref&gt;Stone, David.

Liddell's sister was several years younger than she was portrayed in the film. Her disapproval of Liddell's track career was creative licence; she actually fully supported his sporting work. Jenny Liddell Somerville cooperated fully with the making of the film and has a brief cameo in the Paris [[Church of Scotland]] during Liddell's sermon.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, Russell W.

At the memorial service for Harold Abrahams, which opens the film, Lord Lindsay mentions that he and [[Aubrey Montague]] are the only members of the 1924 Olympic team still alive. However, Montague died in 1948, 30 years before Abrahams' death.

===1924 Olympics===
{{See also|Great Britain at the 1924 Summer Olympics}}

The film takes some liberties with the events at the 1924 Olympics, including the events surrounding Liddell's refusal to race on a Sunday. In the film, he doesn't learn that the 100-metre heat is to be held on the Christian Sabbath until he is boarding the boat to Paris. In fact, the schedule was made public several months in advance; Liddell did however face immense pressure to run on that Sunday and to compete in the 100 metres, getting called before a grilling by the British Olympic Committee, the Prince of Wales, and other [[grandee]]s,&lt;ref name=hudson/&gt; and his refusal to run made headlines around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Feg. [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/361517352.html?dids=361517352:361517352&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jun+24%2C+1924&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=DID+YOU+KNOW+THAT--&amp;pqatl=google "DID YOU KNOW THAT ..."]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. 24 June 1924. Full headline reads, "Did You Know That Famous Scotch Sprinter Will Not Run in the Olympic 100 Metres Because The Trials Are Run on Sunday".&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to change races was, even so, made well before embarking to Paris, and Liddell spent the intervening months training for the 400 metres, an event in which he had previously excelled. It is true, nonetheless, that Liddell's success in the Olympic 400m was largely unexpected.

The film depicts Lindsay, having already won a medal in the 400-metre hurdles, giving up his place in the 400-metre race for Liddell. In fact [[David Burghley|Burghley]], on whom Lindsay is loosely based, was eliminated in the heats of the 110 hurdles (he would go on to win a gold medal in the 400 hurdles at the 1928 Olympics), and was not entered for the 400 metres.

The film reverses the order of Abrahams' 100m and 200m races at the Olympics. In reality, after winning the 100 metres race, Abrahams ran the [[200 metres]] but finished last, [[Jackson Scholz]] taking the gold medal. In the film, before his triumph in the 100m, Abrahams is shown losing the 200m and being scolded by Mussabini. And during the following scene in which Abrahams speaks with his friend Montague while receiving a massage from Mussabini, there is a French newspaper clipping showing Scholz and [[Charlie Paddock]] with a headline which states that the 200 metres was a triumph for the United States. In the same conversation, Abrahams laments getting "beaten out of sight" in the 200. The film thus has Abrahams overcoming the disappointment of losing the 200 by going on to win the 100, a reversal of the real order.

Eric Liddell actually also ran in the 200m race, and finished third, behind Paddock and Scholz. This was the only time in reality that Liddell and Abrahams competed in the same race. While their meeting in the 1923 [[Amateur Athletic Association|AAA]] Championship in the film was fictitious, Liddell's record win in that race did spur Abrahams to train even harder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.ericliddell.org/ericliddell/recollections/content/arthurmarshall.htm |title=Recollections by Sir Arthur Marshall |publisher=Content.ericliddell.org |date= |accessdate=28 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215092135/http://content.ericliddell.org/ericliddell/recollections/content/arthurmarshall.htm |archivedate=15 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abrahams also won a silver medal as an opening runner for the [[4 x 100 metres relay]] team, not shown in the film, and [[Aubrey Montague]] placed sixth in the [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]], as depicted.&lt;ref name=aubrey /&gt;

====Personal inaccuracies at the Olympics====
In the film, the 100m bronze medallist is a character called "Tom Watson"; the real medallist was [[Arthur Porritt, Baron Porritt|Arthur Porritt]] of New Zealand, who refused permission for his name to be used in the film, allegedly out of modesty, and his wish was accepted by the film's producers, even though his permission was not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Arthur Espie Porritt 1900–1994 |url=http://www.library.otago.ac.nz/exhibitions/rhodes_scholars/arthur_espie_porritt.html |title=Reference to Porritt's modesty |publisher=Library.otago.ac.nz |date= |accessdate=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the brief back-story given for Watson, who is called up to the New Zealand team from the [[University of Oxford]], substantially matches Porritt's history. With the exception of Porritt, all the runners in the 100m final are identified correctly when they line up for inspection by the Prince of Wales.

Jackson Scholz is depicted as handing Liddell an inspirational Bible-quotation message before the 400 metres final: "It says in the Old Book, 'He that honors me, I will honor.' Good luck."&lt;ref&gt;The quoted passage is [[Books of Samuel|First Samuel]] [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Samuel#2:30|2:30]].&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, the note was from members of the British team, and was handed to Liddell before the race by his attending masseur at the team's Paris hotel.&lt;ref name=reid&gt;Reid, Alasdair. "Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell". ''[[The Times]]''. 1 August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; For dramatic purposes, screenwriter Welland asked Scholz if he could be depicted handing the note, and Scholz readily agreed, saying "Yes, great, as long as it makes me look good."&lt;ref name=hudson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Britain's 1924 Olympic Champs Live Again in 'Chariots of Fire'—and Run Away with the Oscars | work = [[People (American magazine)|People]] | date =10 May 1982 | volume = 17 | issue = 18 | url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20082112,00.html | accessdate =22 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charleson as Liddell.jpg|thumb|[[Ian Charleson]], who studied the Bible intensively for his role, wrote Eric Liddell's post-race inspirational speech to a working-class crowd.]]
Producer [[David Puttnam]] was looking for a story in the mold of ''[[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|A Man for All Seasons]]'' (1966), regarding someone who follows his conscience, and felt sports provided clear situations in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;Goodell, Gregory.

Screenwriter [[Colin Welland]], commissioned by Puttnam, did an enormous amount of research for his [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning script. Among other things, he took out advertisements in London newspapers seeking memories of the 1924 Olympics, went to the National Film Archives for pictures and footage of the 1924 Olympics, and interviewed everyone involved who was still alive. Welland just missed Abrahams, who died 14 January 1978, but he did attend Abrahams' February 1978 memorial service, which inspired the present-day framing device of the film.&lt;ref name=rw /&gt; [[Aubrey Montague]]'s son saw Welland's newspaper ad and sent him copies of the letters his father had sent home – which gave Welland something to use as a narrative bridge in the film. Except for changes in the greetings of the letters from "Darling Mummy" to "Dear Mum" and the change from Oxford to Cambridge, all of the readings from Montague's letters are from the originals.&lt;ref name=hudson /&gt;

Welland's original script also featured, in addition to Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams, a third protagonist, 1924 Olympic gold medallist [[Douglas Lowe (athlete)|Douglas Lowe]], who was presented as a privileged aristocratic athlete. However, Lowe refused to have anything to do with the film, and his character was written out and replaced by the fictional character of Lord Andrew Lindsay.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, pp. 274–295.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ian Charleson]] himself wrote Eric Liddell's speech to the post-race workingmen's crowd at the Scotland v. Ireland races. Charleson, who had studied the Bible intensively in preparation for the role, told director Hugh Hudson that he didn't feel the portentous and sanctimonious scripted speech was either authentic or inspiring. Hudson and Welland allowed him to write words he personally found inspirational instead.&lt;ref&gt;Ian McKellen, Hugh Hudson, Alan Bates, et al.

The film was slightly altered for the U.S. audience. A brief scene depicting a pre-Olympics [[cricket]] game between Abrahams, Liddell, Montague, and the rest of the British track team appears shortly after the beginning of the original film. For the American audience, this brief scene was deleted. In the U.S., to avoid the initial G rating, which had been strongly associated with children's films and might have hindered box office sales, a different scene was used – one depicting Abrahams and Montague arriving at a Cambridge railway station and encountering two [[World War I]] veterans who use an [[shit|obscenity]] – in order to be given a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG rating]].&lt;ref&gt;Puttnam interviewed in BBC Radio obituary of [[Jack Valenti]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Puttnam chose [[Hugh Hudson]], a multiple award-winning advertising and documentary filmmaker who had never helmed a feature film, to direct ''Chariots of Fire''. Hudson and Puttnam had known each other since the 1960s, when Puttnam was an advertising executive and Hudson was making films for ad agencies. In 1977, Hudson had also been [[second-unit]] director on the Puttnam-produced film ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]''.&lt;ref name=round&gt;Round, Simon.

===Casting===
Director [[Hugh Hudson]] was determined to cast young, unknown actors in all the major roles of the film, and to back them up by using veterans like [[John Gielgud]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], and [[Ian Holm]] as their supporting cast. Hudson and producer [[David Puttnam]] did months of fruitless searching for the perfect actor to play Eric Liddell. They then saw Scottish stage actor [[Ian Charleson]] performing the role of Pierre in the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s production of ''[[Piaf (play)|Piaf]]'', and knew immediately they had found their man. Unbeknownst to them, Charleson had heard about the film from his father, and desperately wanted to play the part, feeling it would "fit like a kid glove".&lt;ref&gt;Ian McKellen, Hugh Hudson, Alan Bates, et al. ''For Ian Charleson: A Tribute''. London: Constable and Company, 1990. pp. xix, 9, 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Cross]], who plays Harold Abrahams, was discovered while playing Billy Flynn in ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''. In addition to having a natural pugnaciousness, he had the desired ability to sing and play the piano.&lt;ref name=hudson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bencross.net/biography.html Ben Cross – Bio on Official site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022043111/http://www.bencross.net/biography.html |date=22 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross was thrilled to be cast, and said he was moved to tears by the film's script.&lt;ref name=wings&gt;''Wings on Their Heels: The Making of'' Chariots of Fire. (2005 video; featurette on 2005 DVD).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[20th Century Fox]], which put up half of the production budget in exchange for distribution rights outside of North America,&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, pp. 273–274.&lt;/ref&gt; insisted on having a couple of notable American names in the cast.&lt;ref name=reunion /&gt; Thus the small parts of the two American champion runners, Jackson Scholz and Charlie Paddock, were cast with recent headliners: [[Brad Davis (actor)|Brad Davis]] had recently starred in ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]'' (also produced by Puttnam), and [[Dennis Christopher]] had recently starred, as a young bicycle racer, in the popular indie film ''[[Breaking Away]]''.&lt;ref name=wings /&gt;

All of the actors portraying runners underwent a gruelling three-month training intensive with renowned running coach Tom McNab. This training and isolation of the actors also created a strong bond and sense of camaraderie among them.&lt;ref name=wings /&gt;

=== Music ===
{{Main|Chariots of Fire (album)}}
[[File:Charleson on beach.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ian Charleson]] (foreground) and [[Ben Cross]] (left) running in the "[[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|Chariots of Fire]]" music scene which bookends the film.]]
Although the film is a period piece, set in the 1920s, the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning original soundtrack composed by [[Vangelis]] uses a modern 1980s electronic sound, with a strong use of [[synthesizer]] and piano among other instruments. This was a bold and significant departure from earlier period films, which employed sweeping orchestral instrumentals. The [[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|title theme of the film]] has become iconic, and has been used in subsequent films and television shows during slow-motion segments.

Vangelis, a Greek-born electronic composer who moved to Paris in the late 1960s, had been living in London since 1974.&lt;ref name="dt"&gt;[http://vangeliscollector.com/telegraph112182.htm ''Daily Telegraph'' newspaper, 21 November 1982]&lt;/ref&gt; Director Hugh Hudson had collaborated with him on documentaries and commercials, and was also particularly impressed with his 1979 albums ''[[Opera Sauvage]]'' and ''[[China (Vangelis album)|China]]''.&lt;ref&gt;MacNab, Geoffrey. [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/everyone-was-a-winner-when-british-talent-met-the-olympic-spirit-7640574.html "Everyone Was a Winner when British Talent Met the Olympic Spirit"]. ''[[The Independent]]''. 13 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; David Puttnam also greatly admired Vangelis's body of work, having originally selected his compositions for his previous film ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbert, Julie. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gmc28iYGdMcC&amp;pg=PA426&amp;lpg=PA426&amp;dq=puttnam+vangelis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uqcm-_PfON&amp;sig=6frPR9-CwF_fxMfSjiVdlFwvKSI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MkCJT9HJOqqciALJ2bDaCw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=puttnam%20vangelis&amp;f=false ''Celluloid Symphonies: Texts and Contexts in Film Music History'']. University of California Press, 2011. p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt; Hudson made the choice for Vangelis and for a modern score: "I knew we needed a piece which was anachronistic to the period to give it a feel of modernity. It was a risky idea but we went with it rather than have a period symphonic score."&lt;ref name=round /&gt; The soundtrack had a personal significance to Vangelis: After composing the iconic theme tune he told Puttnam, "My father is a runner, and this is an anthem to him."&lt;ref name=rw&gt;McLaughlin, John. [https://archive.is/20130104210643/http://www.runnersworld.com/article/printer/1,7124,s6-243-297--14187-0,00.html "In Chariots They Ran"]. ''[[Runner's World]]''. February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dt" /&gt;

Hudson originally wanted Vangelis's 1977 tune "L'Enfant",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kRS4pkrBqE "L'Enfant", from ''Opera Sauvage'']&lt;/ref&gt; from his ''Opera Sauvage'' album, to be the title theme of the film, and the beach running sequence was actually filmed with "L'Enfant" playing on loudspeakers for the runners to pace to. Vangelis finally convinced Hudson he could create a new and better piece for the film's main theme – and when he played the now-iconic "Chariots of Fire" theme for Hudson, it was agreed the new tune was unquestionably better.&lt;ref&gt;Vangelis in ''Chariots of Fire – The Reunion'' (2005 video; featurette on 2005 ''Chariots of Fire'' DVD)&lt;/ref&gt; The "L'Enfant" melody still made it into the film: When the athletes reach Paris and enter the stadium, a brass band marches through the field, and first plays a modified, acoustic performance of the piece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsew.com/data/trivia.htm Trivia about Vangelis]&lt;/ref&gt; Vangelis's electronic "L'Enfant" track eventually was used prominently in the 1982 film ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]''.

Some pieces of Vangelis's music in the film did not end up on the film's soundtrack album. One of them is the background music to the race Eric Liddell runs in the Scottish highlands. This piece is a version of "Hymne", the original version of which appears on Vangelis's 1979 album, ''[[Opéra sauvage]]''. Various versions are also included on Vangelis's compilation albums ''[[Themes (Vangelis album)|Themes]]'', ''[[Portraits (So Long Ago, So Clear)|Portraits]]'', and ''[[Odyssey: The Definitive Collection]]'', though none of these include the version used in the film.

Five lively [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] tunes also appear in the soundtrack, and serve as jaunty period music which nicely counterpoints Vangelis's modern electronic score. These are: "He is an Englishman" from ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', "Three Little Maids from School Are We" from ''[[The Mikado]]'', "With Catlike Tread" from ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', "The Soldiers of Our Queen" from ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'', and "There Lived a King" from ''[[The Gondoliers]]''.

The film also incorporates a major traditional work: "[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]", sung by a British choir at the 1978 funeral of Harold Abrahams. The words, written by William Blake in 1804-8, were set to music by Parry in 1916 as a celebration of England. This hymn has been described as "England's unofficial national anthem",&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Blair. [http://www.answers.com/topic/sir-charles-hubert-hastings-parry ''Hubert Parry''.] [[AllMusic]] Guide, reprinted in Answers.com.&lt;/ref&gt; concludes the film and inspired its title.&lt;ref&gt;Manchel, Frank.

===Filming locations===
[[File:Chariots of Fire beach.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The beach running scene.]]
The beach scenes associated with the theme tune were filmed at West Sands, [[St Andrews]]. A plaque commemorating the filming can be found there today. The very last scene of the opening titles crosses the 1st and 18th holes of the [[Old Course at St Andrews|Old Course]] at [[St Andrews Links]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotlandthemovie.com/movies/andrews.html ''Chariots of Fire'' – St Andrews] ''Scotland: The Movie Location Guide''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graylinescotland.com/tour.asp?tourid=46 Tours: St Andrews] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614053333/http://www.graylinescotland.com/tour.asp?tourid=46 |date=14 June 2010 }} ''Gray Line Tours''. Describes Grannie Clark's Wynd, a public right-of-way over the 1st and the 18th of the Old Course, which was where the athletes were filmed running for the final titles shot.&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the Cambridge scenes were actually filmed at Hugh Hudson's alma mater [[Eton College]], because Cambridge refused filming rights, fearing depictions of anti-Semitism. The Cambridge administration greatly regretted the decision after the film's enormous success.&lt;ref name=hudson /&gt;

[[Liverpool Town Hall]] was the setting for the scenes depicting the British Embassy in Paris.&lt;ref name=hudson /&gt; The [[Colombes]] [[Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir|Olympic Stadium]] in Paris was represented by the [[The Oval (Wirral)|Oval Sports Centre]], [[Bebington]], Merseyside.&lt;ref name=where&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.wheredidtheyfilmthat.co.uk/film.php?film_id=60|title=Chariots of Fire|publisher=Where Did They Film That?|accessdate=18 February 2007|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nearby [[Woodside, Merseyside|Woodside]] ferry terminal was used to represent the embarkation scenes set in [[Dover]].&lt;ref name=where /&gt; The railway station scenes were filmed in York, using locomotives from the [[National Railway Museum]].&lt;ref name=hudson /&gt; The scene depicting a performance of ''[[The Mikado]]'' was filmed in the [[Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool]] with members of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] who were on tour.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Ian, ed.[https://books.google.com/books?id=pPj0nly_1OQC&amp;pg=PA576&amp;dq=%22savoy+theatre%22+%22chariots+of+fire%22&amp;num=100#v=onepage&amp;q=%22savoy%20theatre%22%20%22chariots%20of%20fire%22&amp;f=false ''The Complete Annotated Gilbert and Sullivan.''] Oxford University Press, 2005. p. 576.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival for the 2012 Olympics==
''Chariots of Fire'' became a recurring theme in promotions for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London. The film's theme tune was featured at the opening of the 2012 London New Years fireworks celebrating the Olympics,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1yLRK2M8YQ London Fireworks 2012 - New Year Live - BBC One]&lt;/ref&gt; and the film's iconic beach-running scene and theme tune were used in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'''s "Let's Make It Great, Britain" Olympic ads.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3b-o63wd_M "Let's Make It Great, Britain"]&lt;/ref&gt; The runners who first tested the new [[Olympic Park, London|Olympic Park]] were spurred on by the ''Chariots of Fire'' theme tune,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17546859 "London 2012: Olympic Park Runners Finish Race"]. ''[[BBC News]]''. 31 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and the iconic music was also used to fanfare the carriers of the [[2012 Summer Olympics torch relay|Olympic flame]] on parts of its route through the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northantset.co.uk/news/local/musicians-set-to-fanfare-the-flame-1-3693330 "Musicians Set to Fanfare the Flame"].

The film's theme was also performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Simon Rattle]], during the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|Opening Ceremony]] of the games; the performance was accompanied by a comedy skit by [[Rowan Atkinson]] (as [[Mr Bean]]) which included the opening beach-running footage from the film.&lt;ref name=mrbean-oc&gt;{{cite web|title=Mr. Bean's 'Chariots of Fire' Skit at 2012 London Olympics Opening Ceremony|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/367792/20120727/mr-bean-rowan-atkinson-olympic-opening-ceremony.htm|publisher=International Business Times|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's theme tune was also played during each medal ceremony of the 2012 Olympics.

==Critical reception==
Since its release ''Chariots of Fire'' has received generally positive reviews from critics. {{as of|2017}} the film holds an 83% "Certified Fresh" rating on review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 64 reviews, accompanied by the summary "Decidedly slower and less limber than the Olympic runners at the center of its story, the film nevertheless manages to make effectively stirring use of its spiritual and patriotic themes."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/chariots_of_fire]. Chariots of Fire (1981) - Rotten Tomatoes. Retrieved 3 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

For its 2012 re-release, Kate Muir of ''[[The Times]]'' gave the film five stars, writing: "In a time when drug tests and synthetic fibres have replaced gumption and moral fibre, the tale of two runners competing against each other in the 1924 Olympics has a simple, undiminished power. From the opening scene of pale young men racing barefoot along the beach, full of hope and elation, backed by Vangelis's now famous anthem, the film is utterly compelling."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/firstnightreviews/article3471497.ece].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5701">{{Chinese folk religion}}
The '''Church of the Highest Supreme''' (太上会 ''Tàishànghuì''; or "Most Supreme", "Most High"; also known as 太上门 ''Tàishàngmén'', the "Gate of the Highest Supreme") is a [[Chinese folk religious sect]] of northern [[China]]. The origins of the sect are obscure, although Thomas David Dubois traces it to the theological tradition of the networks of Hongyangism (弘阳教),{{sfnb|Dubois|2003|pp=153-155}} another northern folk religious sect which has been officially registered under the auspices of the [[Chinese Taoist Association]] since the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Goossaert, Palmer. 2011. p. 347"&gt;Goossaert, Palmer. 2011. p. 347, quote: «[Since the 1990s] [...] a number of [...] [[Chinese salvationist religions|lay salvationist groups]] (such as Xiantiandao in southern China and Hongyangism [弘阳教 ''Hóngyáng jiào''] in Hebei) also successfully registered with the Taoist association, thus gaining legitimacy».&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive fieldwork by Dubois in the late 1990s and early 2000s has produced documentation about the Church of the Highest Supreme as the most influential folk religious sect in rural counties of [[Hebei]], followed by the [[Church of the Heaven and the Earth]]. These two religions "energetically revived" in rural Hebei since the late 1970s,{{sfnb|Dubois|2003|p=13}} with the tacit approval of the local government,{{sfnb|Dubois|2003|p=35}} after pressures from campaigns against some sects in the 1950s and the cessation of any public religious activity in the years of the [[Cultural Revolution]].{{sfnb|Dubois|2003|p=35}}

The Church of the Highest Supreme and the other sects of north China provide ceremonies for public and private religious life of local populations, and their ritual specialists are portrayed as moral exemplars and earnest sources of knowledge about the sacred.{{sfnb|Dubois|2003|p=153}}

==Lineage and history==
Dubois traces the origin of the Church of the Highest Supreme to the ''Hunyuan'' (混元 "Primordial Undetermined") sect,{{sfnb|Dubois|2003|p=153}} another name of Hongyangism ("Red Sun", "Great Sun / Yang" sect, also known as ''Shouyuan'', "Return to the Origin" sect).{{sfnb|Dubois|2003|p=154}} They are furtherly traced back to the [[Wuweiism]] transmitted by the influential leader Zhang Jindou in early-18th century [[Shanxi]].{{sfnb|Dubois|2003|p=155}}

Zhang Jindou's disciples Feng Jinjing and Tian Jintai founded, respectively, the Hunyuan and Shouyuan.{{sfnb|Dubois|2003|p=155}} These two missionary lines intertwined and proliferated over the 18th and 19th century across China, characterised by autonomy given to local networks and the ability to function as stable local institutions uninterested in political intrigues and therefore not clashing with the government.{{sfnb|Dubois|2003|p=156}}

Although certain folk religious sects were officially outlawed for hundreds of years in imperial China, this was not the case of the Church of the Highest Supreme and other sects which were primarily concerned for local welfare.{{sfnb|Dubois|2003|p=167}} This changed with the establishment of the People's Republic of China after 1949, when political project deeply penetrated village society. The first sweeping anti-religious campaign was directed against the [[Yiguandao]], which had spread rapidly throughout the country.{{sfnb|Dubois|2003|p=167}} Yiguandao and other primarily urban religious movements were seen as alien teachings by village populations, and many were happy to see them eradicated.{{sfnb|Dubois|2003|p=167}}

The Church of the Highest Supreme and other localised religions were never labeled "reactionary" like Yiguandao, that would have necessitated their eradication.{{sfnb|Dubois|2003|p=168}} As they were never antagonistic to the new state, and their members fought against the Japanese occupation, the communists were careful not to undermine this base of support.{{sfnb|Dubois|2003|p=168}} During the years when public religious activities were forbidden as backward thinking and the climate became tense for folk religious sects, the Church of the Highest Supreme and the other sects were driven underground.{{sfnb|Dubois|2003|pp=168-170}}

The [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 to 1976 saw the complete cessation of religious expression throughout China.{{sfnb|Dubois|2003|p=171}} Although they were never purged completely, the effects of this ten years-long hiatus shaped the revival of the Church of the Highest Supreme and other folk religious groups during the 1980s, which required reinvention of rituals and restructuration of social roles.{{sfnb|Dubois|2003|pp=172-179}}

==Theology==
The theology and ritual practice of the Church of the Highest Supreme gives centrality to the Venerable Ancestor of the Primordial Undetermined (混元老祖 ''Hùnyuán Lǎozǔ''), the son of the ''[[Wusheng Laomu]]'' (Unborn Venerable Mother), architect of the Goddess' salvation of her purest children.{{sfnb|Dubois|2003|pp=156-157}} This theology is shared with Hongyangism and related sects.{{sfnb|Dubois|2003|pp=156-157}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1908">A '''circuit preacher''' is a [[Christian]] minister who, in response to a shortage of ministers, officiates at multiple churches in an area, thus covering a "circuit".{{Wiktionary|circuit rider}}

Circuit preaching became common during and between the [[Second Great Awakening]] and [[Third Great Awakening]] in the [[United States]].  The style was most common west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], where American settlement pushed westward throughout the 19th century. In the early years of the U.S., many new churches did not yet have a permanent pastor or structure, and in response, the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], which had a polity allowing it to assign clergy without regard to what the individual minister might desire, assigned ministers to rural and frontier "circuits." They became known as [[Circuit rider (religious)|circuit riders]].

With the increase in U.S. population and the rise of urban areas, most church members joined congregations that were large enough that they were not part of a circuit, but many small rural areas kept circuit preachers because it is more economical for churches to share a minister, and because one very small congregation does not provide enough "work" for a full-time minister. Circuit preaching is a way to provide "trained" (as opposed to "lay") clergy for small congregations. Even in the 21st Century it is still common for small congregations of all denominations to share clergy, especially in rural areas of the U.S.

[[Katarina Schuth]] has published a sociological study of [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priests]] who serve multiple parishes, and some of what she says applies to any "circuit preacher" clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Schuth, Katarina. ''Priestly Ministry in Multiple Parishes''. Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Continuous revelation''' or '''continuing revelation''' is a theological belief or position that [[God]] continues to [[Revelation|reveal]] divine principles or commandments to humanity.

In Christian traditions, it is most commonly associated with [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers), and with [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] and [[Charismatic movement|Charismatic]] Christianity, though it is found in some other denominations as well.

Continuous revelation also forms part of the rituals of gatherings in various chapters of [[Taoism]]. In the [[Baha'i Faith]], [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|Progressive revelation]] is an important concept that is similar to continuous revelation.

A notable factor of continuous or continuing revelation as a source of divine commandments and statements is the written recording of such statements in a more open [[scriptural canon]], as is the case with the Latter-Day Saints; while more frequent with the Latter-Day Saints, it is less frequent with the Baha'i Faith, with progressive revelation only being periodically expanded over an extremely long period.

==Judaism==
[[Conservative Judaism]] teaches God's revelation at [[Mount Sinai]] and God's continuing revelation through study of Jewish texts and through life as a Jewish believer.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot N. Dorff Conservative Judaism: Our Ancestors to Our Descendants  1996 - Page 201  "We believe in God's revelation to us at Mount Sinai and in God's continuing revelation to us through study of Jewish texts and through our lives as Jews. b. Some believe that God's revelation at Sinai and subsequently consists of God's own ..&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
{{See also|Progressive revelation (Christian)}}

===Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy===
[[Vatican II]] states “no new public revelation is to be expected before the glorious manifestation of our Lord, Jesus Christ.” The notion of progressive or continuing revelation is not held by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] or by [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], who instead favor the idea of tradition and development of doctrine, while progressivist and continuationist approaches are specifically condemned in the declaration [[Dominus Iesus]].

===Protestantism===
Protestants generally teach that the modern age is not a period of continuing revelation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith A. Mathison]], ''[[The Shape of Sola Scriptura]]''  2001- Page 161  "We do not live in a period of continuing revelation. This is not simply a Protestant doctrine. Vatican II states that, “no new public revelation is to be expected before the glorious manifestation of our Lord, Jesus Christ.”5 "&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friends (Quakers)===
The [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) affirm continuing revelation through the [[Inner light]] or the light within, which is the [[presence of God]] which provides illumination and guidance to the individual and through individuals to the group.&lt;ref&gt;Protestant Nonconformist Texts: 1550 to 1700 Robert Tudur Jones, Kenneth Dix, Alan Ruston - 2007- Page 375 "... a well known member of the Dutch Collegiant church who had written a paper against the possibility of continuing revelation. Barclay wrote him a lengthy refutation which is, as it happens, an excellent summary of Barclay's theological ideas."&lt;/ref&gt;
Some Friends consider the Bible the ultimate authority, but others consider the Inner Light to be above the Bible.  Both groups believe that the Inner Light speaks to people directly and not just through the text of the Bible.
  
Because Friends believe that revelation is ongoing, they have no set creed or dogmas.  However, as early Friends listened to the Inner light and endeavored to live accordingly, a common set of beliefs gradually emerged, which became known as testimonies. Although rooted in the immediate experience of the community of Friends, these Testimonies are based on what Friends believe are verified in the Bible, especially as described in the Gospels regarding the life and teachings of Jesus.

===Pentecostal and Charismatic===
[[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] and [[Charismatic Movement|Charismatic]] Christians generally believe that Christians, especially "Spirit-filled" Christians can receive revelations from God in the form of dreams, visions, and audible or inaudible voices.  They also believe that certain individuals are able to transmit revelations from God in the form of prophecy, words of knowledge, and [[glossolalia|speaking in tongues]] and interpretation of tongues.

While most Pentecostals and Charismatics believe the Bible to be the ultimate authority and would not say that any new revelation can ever contradict the Bible, they do believe that God continues to speak to people today on extra-biblical topics as well as to interpret and apply the text of the Bible.

===Latter-day Saints===
{{Main|Revelation (Latter Day Saints)}}
In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), continuing revelation is the principle that God or his divine agents still continue to communicate to mankind.  This communication can be manifest in many ways:  influences of the [[Holy Ghost]]; vision; visitation of divine beings; and others.  By such means God guides his followers to [[salvation]] and without such His followers will eventually form their beliefs or practices after a god of their own making.  Church founder [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] used the example of the Lord's revelations to Moses in  Deuteronomy to explain the importance and necessity of continuous revelation to guide "those who seek diligently to know [God's] precepts":

{{Quote|text=God said, "Thou shalt not kill" {{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy|5:17|NIV}} at another time He said, "Thou shalt utterly destroy." {{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy| 7:2; 12:2; 20:17|NIV}} This is the principle on which the government of heaven is conducted-by revelation adapted to the circumstances in which the children of the kingdom are placed. Whatever God requires is right, no matter what it is, although we may not see the reason thereof till long after the events transpire . . . As God has designed our happiness-and the happiness of all His creatures, He never has&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; He never will&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; institute an ordinance or give a commandment to His people that is not calculated in its nature to promote that happiness which He has designed, and which will not end in the greatest amount of good and glory to those who become the recipients of his law and ordinances... for all things shall be made known unto them in [His] own due time, and in the end they shall have joy.|sign=[[Joseph Smith]]|source=''Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith'', pp.&amp;nbsp;256&amp;ndash;7.}}

The LDS Church believes in continuing revelation, not continuous revelation, and differentiates between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Oaks |first= Dallin H. |authorlink= Dallin H. Oaks |title= Teaching and Learning by the Spirit |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/1997/03/teaching-and-learning-by-the-spirit |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= March 1997 |page= 14 |quote= Revelations from God ... are not constant. We believe in continuing revelation, not continuous revelation. We are often left to work out problems without the dictation or specific direction of the Spirit.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personal versus church-wide revelation====

Mormonism makes a distinction between personal revelation and revelation directed to all members of the church. They believe that personal revelation can come to any individual with a righteous desire, for example to direct someone in their search for truth. In contrast, revelation for the entire church only comes to those who have been called by God as prophets, which in the LDS Church includes the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] and the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= LaRene Porter |last= Gaunt |date= September 2013 |title= How Is Doctrine Established? |url= https://www.lds.org/ensign/2013/09/how-is-doctrine-established?lang=eng |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mormons regard revelation through prophets as an indispensable element of Christ's church, without which the church would be led by man, not God. Continued revelation is essential for matters affecting the church as a whole, including guiding the church through changing world conditions, keeping doctrine pure and unadulterated, revealing new doctrine and scripture in the times appointed by God, and making policy or organizational changes as the church grows and evolves. In contrast to the Mainstream Christian belief that God has "sealed up the heavens" in terms of church-wide revelation, Mormons believe God continues to follow the pattern that he adhered to throughout the entire span of the Bible, which was to reveal his will and doctrine through prophets.

====Opposition to continued revelation====

Mormons see the tendency to dismiss the possibility that God could call modern prophets as similar to the attitude of those in the Bible who rejected the prophets and/or apostles of their day. As demonstrated by the Jews in the time of Jesus, it is often much less challenging to accept prophets of prior ages, rather than a contemporary prophet. Granted, the work of a prophet has always been to dispel false beliefs and warn against behaviors that are contrary to God's will, which inevitably creates friction when viewed as a threat to firmly entrenched traditions and mindsets. The sense of change in the message of Christ and the apostles led many to regard them as false prophets. Christ himself warned against false prophets, teaching that the way to distinguish between a true and a false prophet was "by their fruits" (Matt 7:15-20); however, the perceived threat to tradition was often a strong enough deterrent to cause the witnesses of good fruits (such as powerful sermons or miraculous healings) to dismiss them as the work of the devil (Matt 12:24). After Christ ordained his apostles, he warned them of the extreme opposition they would encounter for these reasons, telling them, "ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake" (Matt 10:16-23). Christ also said, “Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! For so did their fathers to the false prophets," thus illustrating that opposition will naturally accompany a true prophet if they are doing their job correctly (Luke 6:22-26).

====Apostasy====

Sometimes the opposition against God's prophets escalated to the point of violence and martyrdom, which Jesus and the apostles frequently referenced while preaching to their detractors (Matt 23:31-37, Luke 11:47-51, Acts 7:52, Romans 11:3, 1 Thes 2:15). In this sense, Mormons acknowledge that revelation has not continued uninterrupted throughout history, being that the killing of God's prophets sometimes resulted in periods without church-wide revelation—which Mormons refer to as apostasies. Similar to prophets before them, Peter and the apostles also suffered martyrdom at the hands of their persecutors—with the exception of John who was banished to the Isle of Patmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Shanna |last= Butler |date= February 2005 |title= What Happened to Christ’s Church? |url= https://www.lds.org/liahona/2005/02/what-happened-to-christs-church |journal= [[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the Mainstream Christian view that the apostolic era came to a close because revelation had reached its completion,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholic.com/tracts/private-revelation&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons see it not as God's will but as a tragic result of the overwhelming persecution that plagued the church in that era, which cut short the program of apostolic succession that had commenced when Judas was replaced by Matthias (Acts 1:23-26). The apostasy that followed is referred to as the [[Great Apostasy]], because it lasted longer than prior periods without prophets.

Mormons believe that once the Christian church was no longer led by revelation, its doctrine began to be altered by theologians who took it upon themselves to continue developing doctrine, despite not being called or authorized to receive revelation for the church body. In the absence of revelation, these theologians often resorted to speculation,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14588a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia article on "History of Dogmatic Theology" mentions speculation a few times, for example "The Great Fathers of the Church and the ecclesiastical writers of the first 800 years rendered important services by their positive demonstration and their speculative treatment of dogmatic truth."&lt;/ref&gt; which coupled with their own interpretations and extrapolations of scripture, inevitably resulted in disagreement and division on many doctrinal points.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Tuggy |first= Dale |contribution= History of Trinitarian Doctrines |contribution-url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/trinity/trinity-history.html |title= Trinity |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/trinity/index.html |publisher= [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |date= Summer 2014 }} — This article offers a good summary of the disagreement that was a constant feature of the evolving doctrine of the trinity&lt;/ref&gt; Ecumenical councils were held in order to settle these differences, yet without prophets called and authorized to reveal God's will on the topics being debated, the attendees could only vote on the theories presented in order to decide which ones would become official doctrine&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04423f.htm&lt;/ref&gt;—a practice that served to ostracize as heretics those who didn't go along with these decisions, and in some cases led to major [[schism (religion)|schisms]] in the church. Mormons view this process of doctrinal development as completely foreign to God's established pattern of revealing doctrine through a prophet. They point to history as incontrovertible proof that humans are incapable of agreeing on how to interpret the Bible (2 Pet 1:20), which should act as a strong indicator that God's purpose for the Bible was not to derive doctrine, but rather to support it. When doctrine is not established and maintained through continued revelation, Mormons see the inevitable result as “philosophies of man, mingled with scripture”.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Stephen E. |last= Robinson |authorlink= Stephen E. Robinson |date= January 1988 |title= Warring against the Saints of God  |url= https://www.lds.org/ensign/1988/01/warring-against-the-saints-of-god?lang=eng |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Restoration====

Mormons again point to the Bible to show that after every period of apostasy, God always eventually called another prophet when the time was right. It is in that same spirit that Mormons claim that once conditions were ready, God again resumed his pattern of revealing his will through prophets by calling Joseph Smith, through whom he restored the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, clearing up the error that had been introduced during the Great Apostasy. Mormons believe that since that time, revelation through prophets and apostles has continued unbroken until the present day, God having promised that revelation will not be taken again from the earth before the Second Coming of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Robert D. |last= Hales |authorlink= Robert D. Hales |date= November 2005 |title= Preparations for the Restoration and the Second Coming: 'My Hand Shall Be over Thee' |url= https://www.lds.org/ensign/2005/11/preparations-for-the-restoration-and-the-second-coming-my-hand-shall-be-over-thee?lang=eng |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Open scriptural canon====

The open [[sacred text|scriptural]] [[wiktionary:canon|canon]] of the LDS Church is based on the principle of continuous revelation. Its 9th [[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)|Article of Faith]] states:

{{Quote|text=We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.}}

Members of the LDS Church anticipate additions to its canon, including the translation of the remaining two-thirds of the [[Golden Plates|golden plates]] which was the source of the [[Book of Mormon]].

====Community of Christ====

The [[Community of Christ]] (Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints), the second largest Latter Day Saint denomination, regularly canonizes revelation into the Doctrine and Covenants.  Its Prophet/President present Words of Council to the church usually before its World Conference.  If the conference confirms the Words of Counsel as prophetic, it is added as a Section in the scripture known as [[Doctrine and Covenants]].

==Islam==
===Ahmadiyya===
[[Ahmadi Muslims]] believe that while law-bearing revelation has ended with the perfection of scripture in the form of the [[Qur'an]], non-scriptural revelation to non-prophets as well as non law-bearing Muslim prophets continues. They cite [[Qur'anic]] verses as well as [[Ahadith]] considered by many to be authentic in support of their belief in continuous revelation.

==Baha'i Faith==
{{Main|Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)}}
Progressive revelation is a core teaching in the [[Bahá'í Faith]] that suggests that religious truth is revealed by God progressively and cyclically over time through a series of divine [[Manifestation of God|Messengers]], and that the teachings are tailored to suit the needs of the time and place of their appearance.&lt;ref name= "oneworld"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last= Smith | first= Peter | encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith | title = Progressive revelation | year= 2000 | publisher= Oneworld | location= Oxford | isbn = 1-85168-184-1 | pages = 276–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi | year = 1974 | title =Bahá'í Administration | publisher= Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location= Wilmette, [[Illinois|IL]], USA | isbn = 0-87743-166-3 |page =185 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/BA/ba-169.html#pg185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the [[Bahá'í teachings]] recognize the divine origin of several world religions as different stages of in the history of [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion|one religion]], while believing that the revelation of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] is the most recent (though not the last—that there will never be a last), and therefore the most relevant to modern society.&lt;ref name="oneworld"/&gt;

Bahá'ís believe God to be generally regular and periodic in revealing His will to mankind through messengers/prophets, which are named [[Manifestations of God]]. Each messenger in turn establishes a [[Covenant (religion)|covenant]] and founds a [[religion]]. This process of revelation, according to the Bahá'í writings, is also never ceasing.&lt;ref name="oneworld"/&gt; The general theme of the successive and continuous religions founded by Manifestations of God is that there is an evolutionary tendency, and that each Manifestation of God brings a larger measure of revelation (or religion) to humankind than the previous one.&lt;ref name="lundberg"&gt;{{cite book | title = Baha'i Apocalypticism: The Concept of Progressive Revelation | first = Zaid | last = Lundberg | date = May 1996 | url = http://bahai-library.com/?file=lundberg_bahai_apocalypticism | accessdate = 2006-11-25 | publisher = Department of History of Religion at the Faculty of Theology, Lund University }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The differences in the revelation brought by the Manifestations of God is stated to be not inherent in the characteristics of the Manifestation of God, but instead attributed to the various worldly, societal and human factors;&lt;ref name="lundberg" /&gt;  these differences are in accordance with the "conditions" and "varying requirements of the age" and the "spiritual capacity" of humanity.&lt;ref name="lundberg" /&gt;

Thus religious truth is seen to be relative to its recipients and not absolute; while the messengers proclaimed eternal moral and spiritual truths that are renewed by each messenger, they also changed their message to reflect the particular spiritual and material evolution of humanity at the time of the appearance of the messenger.&lt;ref name="oneworld"/&gt; In the Bahá'í view, since humanity's spiritual capacity and receptivity has increased over time, the extant to which these spiritual truths are expounded changes.&lt;ref name="lundberg" /&gt;

==Taoism==
In various designated offshoots of [[Taoism]] like the [[De (Chinese)|De]] Schools in Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong, and the [[Tao|Dao]] Schools in Hong Kong, Taiwan and China, weekly or sometimes monthly gatherings are held at temples to receive and understand communications from above by way of two mediums holding rattan sifts writing on sand, who are 'dictated' with news ranging in contents from current affairs, religion, to arts and morality, the writings are called [[Sift Text]] or '乩文'.  Different gods in the Daoist pantheon are designated for temples which have to go through the rigour of acceptance before the contents are recognized as authorized communiques from heaven.

A sacred text of [[Jeungism]], the original '''Dojeon''' was published in Korean on October 25, 1992. The Dojeon has been translated into eight languages, including [[Korean language|Korean]], [[English language|English]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. 

==Background==
Over one hundred years ago, [[Sangjenim]] (God the Father) was the first in all of Eastern and Western history to proclaim and fully describe the Later Heaven [[Gaebyeok]]. The precept of Gaebyeok applies to heaven and earth and to the realms of humanity and spirits, and it answers the mysteries of nature, explains the secrets of civilization, and resolves the limitations of Eastern and Western religions and philosophies. 

After Sangjenim’s ascension to heaven, the truth of gaebyeok was widely disseminated by the successor of His Dao lineage and authority, [[Taemonim]] (God the Mother).

The original Dojeon was published in Korean on October 25, 1992 for the 122nd commemoration of Sangjenim’s birth, and it entailed twenty years of extensive research and fieldwork by Jeung San Do practitioners as they compiled the written and oral testimonies of Sangjenim’s and Taemonim’s disciples, the disciples’ descendants, and the disciples’ students. 

The publication of the 2003 revised edition took an additional eleven years of effort involving further research and extensive review of old and new testimonials to verify and discover dates, sites, events, and people related to Sangjenim’s and Taemonim’s works of renewing heaven and earth. 

The foreign-language translations of the Dojeon are based mostly on the 1992 Korean edition. Thus, the Dojeon represents thirty years of dedication by many people; it is the culmination of Jeung San Do’s culture. 

==Content==
:Those aware of the flow of the world have the qi of life. 
:Those ignorant of the flow of the world have the qi of death. 
:Dojeon 5:259:20

Arranged in eleven chapters, the Dojeon spans Sangjenim’s and Taemonim’s lives, their work, their disciples, the principle upon which the universe evolves, the ultimate destiny of humanity, the existence of spirits, meditation, the times we live in, the coming civilization, and much more. Through the Dojeon, the reader can begin the process of understanding [[Jeung san do|Jeung San Do’s]] Eight Teachings:
* Sangjenim (The supreme God)
* Cosmology (the way of universe, [[Cosmic year (Chinese astrology)|Cosmic year]]) 
* Humanity 
* Spirits and Meditation ([[Tae eul ju|Tae Eul Ju meditation]])
* The work of renewing heaven and earth (Human history) 天地公事
* Autumn [[Gaebyeok]] and Salvation 
* The Subu ([[Tao]] Lineage and Authority)
* The Ilggun (Workers) of work under heaven
 
The Dojeon records the true path that will allow the people of the world to survive the Later Heaven [[Gaebyeok]] and enter the new civilization of immortality. This makes the Dojeon history’s greatest gift-a sacred text of life, not filled with words of despair and tears, but with a radiant and vivid vision of joy and hope for a future that transcends the limitations of modern civilization. But to appreciate the Dojeon’s sacred truth, one must first understand Sangjenim and Taemonim.

The '''elephant goad''', '''bullhook''', or '''ankus''' (from Sanskrit ''{{IAST|aṅkuśa}}'' or ''ankusha'') is a tool employed by [[mahout]] in the [[elephant handling|handling and training of elephant]]s.  It consists of a hook (usually bronze or steel) which is attached to a {{convert|60|-|90|cm|ft|abbr=on}} handle, ending in a tapered end.

A relief at [[Sanchi]] and a fresco at the [[Ajanta Caves]] depict a three-person crew on the war elephant, the driver with an elephant goad, what appears to be a noble warrior behind the driver and another attendant on the posterior of the elephant.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"&gt;Nossov, Konstantin &amp; Dennis, Peter (2008). ''War Elephants''. llustrated by Peter Dennis. Edition: illustrated. Osprey Publishing. {{ISBN|1-84603-268-7}}
[https://books.google.com/books?id=7j1nZ-9Rdl4C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=ankusha&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T33DThXqxH&amp;sig=gtGf-O-dXW7RaiyAS7rxnckObLI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=riLjScmPGIfg7AP17_WUDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#PPA18,M1] (accessed: Monday April 13, 2009), p.18&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nossov and Dennis (2008 p 19) report that two perfectly preserved elephant goads were recovered from an archaeological site at [[Taxila]] and are dated from 3rd century BCE to the 1st century CE according to [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|Marshall]]. The larger of the two is 65&amp;nbsp;cm long.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nossov and Dennis (2008: p.&amp;nbsp;16) state:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
An ''ankusha'', a sharpened goad with a pointed hook, was the main tool for managing an elephant. The ''ankusha'' first appeared in India in the 6th-5th century BC and has been used ever since, not only there, but wherever elephants served man.&lt;ref&gt;Nossov, Konstantin &amp; Dennis, Peter (2008). ''War Elephants''. llustrated by Peter Dennis. Edition: illustrated. Osprey Publishing. {{ISBN|1-84603-268-7}}

==Fabrication and construction==
The handle can be made of any material, from wood to ivory, depending on the wealth and opulence of the owner. Contemporary bullhooks which are used for animal handling generally have handles made of fibreglass, metal, plastic, or wood.

The elephant goad is found in armouries and temples all across India, where elephants march in religious processions and perform in various civil capacities.  They are often quite ornate, being decorated with gemstones and engravings to be appropriate for the ceremonies in which they are used.

===Iconography===

[[File:Ganesha Nurpur miniature circa 1810 Dubost p64.jpg|thumb|The [[Hindu]] god [[Ganesha]] holding an elephant goad in his right upper arm]]

The elephant goad is a polysemic [[iconographic]] ritual tool in [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]], in the inclusive [[rubric]] of [[Dharmic Traditions]].{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The elephant has appeared in cultures across the world. They are a symbol of wisdom in Asian cultures and are famed for their memory and intelligence, where they are thought to be on par with [[cetaceans]]&lt;ref name="fusukt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tursiops.org/dolfin/guide/smart.html |title=What Makes Dolphins So Smart? |publisher=Discovery Communications |accessdate=2007-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68odq4rDt?url=http://tursiops.org/dolfin/guide/smart.html |archivedate=2012-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hominids]].&lt;ref name = "hfezyk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ap/ar/2001/00000062/00000005/art01815|title=Cognitive behaviour in Asian elephants: use and modification of branches for fly switching |publisher=BBC|accessdate = 2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] once said the elephant was "the beast which passeth all others in wit and mind".&lt;ref name=O&gt;{{cite book | last = O'Connell | first = Caitlin | title = The Elephant's Secret Sense: The Hidden Lives of the Wild Herds of Africa | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | year = 2007 | location = [[New York City]] | pages = 174, 184 | isbn =0-7432-8441-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "elephant" has its origins in the Greek {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἐλέφας|ἐλέφας]]}}, meaning "ivory" or "elephant".&lt;ref name="COED"&gt;{{cite book |last=Soanes |first=Catherine |author2=Angus Stevenson |title=Concise Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-929634-0 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In iconography and ceremonial ritual tools, the elephant goad is often included in a hybridized tool, for example one that includes elements of [[Vajrakila]], 'hooked knife' or 'skin flail' (Tibetan: gri-gug, Sanskrit: kartika), [[Vajra]] and Axe, as well as the goad functionality for example. Ritual Ankusha were often finely wrought of precious metals and even fabricated from [[ivory]], often encrusted with jewels. In Dharmic Traditions the goad/ankusha and rope 'noose/snare/lasso' (Sanskrit: Pāśa) are traditionally paired as tools of subjugation.&lt;ref name="Beer, Robert 2003 p.146"&gt;Beer, Robert (2003).

===Hinduism===
In the Hinduism, an elephant goad is one of the eight auspicious objects known as [[Ashtamangala]] and certain other religions of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. A goad is also an attribute of many Hindu gods, including [[Ganesha]].

===Buddhism===
[[B. Alan Wallace|Wallace]] and [[Daniel Goleman|Goleman]] (2006: p.&amp;nbsp;79) discuss '[[śamatha]]' (Sanskrit), [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] and [[introspection]] which they tie to [[metacognition]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Throughout Buddhist literature, the training in shamatha is often likened to training a wild elephant, and the two primary instruments for this are the tether of mindfulness and the goad of introspection.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, B. Alan with Goleman, Daniel (2006). ''The Attention Revolution: Unlocking the Power of the Focused Mind.'' Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-276-5}}. Source: [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ygf4pbnbf5kC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=goad+mindfulness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=56EE4o9nkt&amp;sig=LTcG7XB68_GlaTswoQbufJgOev8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RKfhSfb2FZzY7AOErPCUDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7] (accessed: Sunday April 14, 2009) p.79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace &amp; Goleman (2006: p.79):
"Buddhist psychology classifies introspection as a form of intelligence ([[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]]), and its development has long been an important element of Buddhist meditation. A similar mental faculty, usually called matacognition, is now coming under the scrutiny of modern psychologists. Cognitive researchers have defined metacognition as knowing of one's own cognitive and affective processes and states, as well as the ability to consciously and deliberately monitor and regulate those processes and states. This appears to be an especially rich area for collaborative research between Buddhist contemplatives and cognitive scientists." Source: [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ygf4pbnbf5kC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=goad+mindfulness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=56EE4o9nkt&amp;sig=LTcG7XB68_GlaTswoQbufJgOev8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RKfhSfb2FZzY7AOErPCUDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7] (accessed: Sunday April 14, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rowlands (2001: p.&amp;nbsp;124) in discussing consciousness and its [[self-conscious]], [[self-reflexive]] quality of [[apperception]] states that:&lt;blockquote&gt;
The most significant aspect of consciousness, I shall try to show, is its structure, its ''hybrid'' character. Consciousness can be both act and object of experience. Using the somewhat metaphorical notion of ''directing'', we might say that consciousness is not only the directing of awareness but ''can'' be that upon which awareness is directed. Consciousness is not only the act of conscious experience, it can be experience's object. ''[italics preserved from original]''&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, Mark (2001). ''The nature of consciousness''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-80858-8}}. Source: [https://books.google.com/books?id=eppTvOxkcZ4C&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=introspection+apperception&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=J31AZr2EoJ&amp;sig=pUJT6gcp2OkD43E7PbXnlDRkN9w&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qL3hSaeoOozU7APx74mEDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1] (accessed: Sunday April 12, 2009), p.124&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the above quotation the metaphor of 'directing' is employed. In 'directing' consciousness or the mind to introspectively [[apperceive]] the directive forded by the goad is key.

====Tattvasamgraha Tantra====
In the ''[[Tattvasamgraha tantra]]'' (c 7th century), one of the most important tantras of the Buddhist [[Yoga Tantra Class]], the ankusha figures in the visualization of one of the retinue. This tantra explains the process of the visualization of the Vajradhatu Mandala, which is one of the most visually stylized of Buddhist mandalas. The Ankusha is the symbolic attribute for the visualization of the Bodhisattva Vajraraja, an emanation within the retinue of Vajradhatu. This visualization is treated in Tachikawa (c2000: p.&amp;nbsp;237).&lt;ref&gt;Tachikawa, M. (c2000). 'Mandala visualization and possession'. ''New Horizons in Bon Studies.''

==Literature==

In [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Second Jungle Book|Second Jungle Book]]'' story [[s:The Second Jungle Book/The King's Ankus|"The King's Ankus"]],  [[Mowgli]] finds the magnificently-jeweled elephant goad of the title in a hidden treasure chamber. Not realizing the value men place on jewels, he later casually discards it in the jungle, unwittingly leading to a chain of greed and murder amongst those who find it after him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="482">The '''Gardens of Ridván''' (lit. garden of paradise) refers to one of two [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] locations:

*[[Garden of Ridván, Baghdad]]
*[[Garden of Ridván, Akka]]

Although the former has more significance as a holy place, the latter is more often referred in this way due to there being no [[Bahá'í pilgrimage]] in Iraq at present.

Chöje Lama Palmo explains the dharma in an easy accessible and contemporary way. Besides her spiritual and social responsibilities she is actively involved in many fields.

Choje Lama Palmo &lt;ref&gt;The appointment as Choje Lama through the traditional, Tibetan appointment document printed on silk engulfes a very specific responsibility over a particular field of activity within an unbroken lineage of the Buddhadharma. It is solely being bestowed by the highest lineage masters, in the case of Karma Kagyu by The Gyalwang Karmapa or The Chamgon Kenting Tai Situpa.&lt;/ref&gt; was sent to Austria by her lineage and its Supreme Head H.

==Life==
{{Weasel|section|date=August 2018}}
Born 1970 in [[Vienna]], Choje Lama Palmo graduated with Vienna Business School, studied [[German Studies|German Philology]] and [[Romance languages]] at [[University of Vienna]] and received a [[Master of Arts|Master of the Arts degree]] in German [[Medievalism]]. As a media expert she worked as journalist, in the [[public relation]] fields and as photographer until her monastic ordination.[[File:PalpungEurope.jpg|thumb|left|Palpung Europe, The City Institute of The European Seat of the Palpung lineage]]

In 1998, she received her first monastic vows and entered the traditional [[Kagyu]]: three-years-retreat in KTD and USA, then being sent to [[Japan]] after its completion in 2004. In the same year, she was sent back to Austria. In December 2004, she received a Gelongma ([[Wylie transliteration|tib]].: ''dge slong ma'', དགེ་སློང་མ།) full monastic [[Bhikkhuni]] ordination from {{Clarify span|a Mahayana lineage|date=August 2018}}.

In 2006 she met the [[Dalai Lama]] and [[Gyalwa Karmapa]] Orgyen Trinley Dorje in private audiences. Both gave their advise and blessing for Lama Palmo's projects. In 2007, she was appointed director and resident teacher of Palpung Yeshe Chökhor Ling Europe by The [[Pema Donyo Nyinje Wangpo|Chamgon Kenting Tai Situ Rinpoche]].

September 22, 2013 she was appointed Choje Lama by [[Pema Donyo Nyinje Wangpo|Chamgon Dorje Chang Tai Situ Rinpoche]]. November 5, 2014, she received the [http://www.palpung.eu/wir-ueber-uns/gruendungsgeschichte/en Traditional Tibetan Appointment Document] from [[Pema Donyo Nyinje Wangpo|The 12th Chamgon Dorje Chang Tai Situ Rinpoche]].

[[File:Girih tiles3.svg|thumb|right|200px|Construction lines are usually hidden: geometric tiles on left, girih pattern on right.]]
'''Girih tiles''' are a set of five [[tile]]s that were used in the creation of [[Islamic geometric patterns]] using [[strapwork]] ([[girih]]) for decoration of buildings in [[Islamic architecture]]. They have been used since about the year 1200 and their arrangements found significant improvement starting with the [[Darb-i Imam]] shrine in [[Isfahan]] in [[Iran]] built in 1453.

==Five tiles==

The five shapes of the tiles are:
* a regular [[decagon]] with ten interior angles of 144°;
* an elongated (irregular convex) [[hexagon]] with interior angles of 72°, 144°, 144°, 72°, 144°, 144°;
* a [[bow tie]] (non-convex hexagon) with interior angles of 72°, 72°, 216°, 72°, 72°, 216°;
* a [[rhombus]] with interior angles of 72°, 108°, 72°, 108°; and
* a regular [[pentagon]] with five interior angles of 108°.

These modules have their own specific [[Persian]] names:  The quadrilateral tile is called Torange,  the pentagonal tile is called Pange, the concave octagonal tile is called Shesh Band , the bow tie tile is called Sormeh Dan, decagram tile is called Tabl. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarhangi|first=Reza|date=|title=Interlocking Star Polygons in Persian Architecture: The Special Case of the Decagram in Mosaic Designs|url=|journal=Nexus Netw J|volume=14|pages=350|via=JSTORE}}&lt;/ref&gt;All sides of these figures have the same length; and all their angles are multiples of 36° (π/5 [[radian]]s). All of them, except the pentagon, have bilateral (reflection) symmetry through two perpendicular lines. Some have additional symmetries. Specifically, the decagon has tenfold [[rotational symmetry]] (rotation by 36°); and the pentagon has fivefold rotational symmetry (rotation by 72°). 

== The Emergence of Girih Tiles ==
By the late 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, the Islamic artists in North Africa start to use “tile mosaic”, which is the predecessor of [[tessellation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islam : art and architecture|last=Hattstein /Delius.|first=Markus/Peter|publisher=Potsdam : H.F. Ullmann|year=2013|isbn=3848003805|location=|pages=448}}&lt;/ref&gt; . By 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, the Islamic discovered a new way to construct the “tile mosaic” due to the development of arithmetic calculation and geometry—the girih tiles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lu/Steinhardt|first=Peter/Paul|date=2007|title=Decagonal and Quasi-Crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architecture|url=|journal=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20039057|volume=315|pages=2|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

==Girih==

[[Girih]] are lines ([[strapwork]]) that decorate the tiles. The tiles are used to form girih patterns, from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word {{lang|fa|[[wikt:گره#Persian|گره]]}}, meaning "knot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sebastian R. Prange |date=September–October 2009 | title = The Tiles of Infinity | journal = Saudi Aramco World | pages = 24–31 | url = http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200905/the.tiles.of.infinity.htm
}}{{deadlink|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In most cases, only the girih (and other minor decorations like flowers) are visible rather than the boundaries of the tiles themselves. The girih are piece-wise straight lines that cross the boundaries of the tiles at the center of an edge at 54° (3π/10) to the edge. Two intersecting girih cross each edge of a tile. Most tiles have a unique pattern of girih inside the tile that are continuous and follow the symmetry of the tile. However, the decagon has two possible girih patterns one of which has only fivefold rather than tenfold rotational symmetry.

== Mathematics of girih tilings ==



In 2007, the physicists [[Peter Lu|Peter J. Lu]] and [[Paul Steinhardt|Paul J. Steinhardt]] suggested that girih tilings possessed properties consistent with [[self-similar]] [[fractal]] [[quasicrystalline]] tilings such as [[Penrose tiling]]s, predating them by five centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peter J. Lu and Paul J. Steinhardt | year = 2007 | title = Decagonal and Quasi-crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architecture | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 315 | pages = 1106–1110 | url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/315/5815/1106.full | doi = 10.1126/science.1135491
 | pmid = 17322056 | issue = 5815 | bibcode=2007Sci...315.1106L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.harvard.edu/~plu/publications/Science_315_1106_2007_SOM.pdf Supplemental figures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326095515/http://www.physics.harvard.edu/~plu/publications/Science_315_1106_2007_SOM.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This finding was supported both by analysis of patterns on surviving structures, and by examination of 15th-century Persian scrolls. However, we have no indication of how much more the architects may have known about the mathematics involved. It is generally believed that such designs were constructed by drafting zigzag outlines with only a straightedge and a compass. Templates found on scrolls such as the 97-foot- (29.5 metres) long [[Topkapi Scroll]] may have been consulted. Found in the [[Topkapi Palace]] in Istanbul, the administrative center of the Ottoman Empire and believed to date from the late 15th century, the scroll shows a succession of two- and three- dimensional geometric patterns. There is no text, but there is a grid pattern and color-coding used to highlight symmetries and distinguish three-dimensional projections. Drawings such as shown on this scroll would have served as pattern-books for the artisans who fabricated the tiles, and the shapes of the girih tiles dictated how they could be combined into large patterns. In this way, craftsmen could make highly complex designs without resorting to mathematics and without necessarily understanding their underlying principles.&lt;ref name="Topkapi"&gt;{{cite book | author = Gulru Necipoglu  | year = 1995 | title = The Topkapi Scroll:  Geometry and Ornament in Islamic Architecture | publisher = Getty Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of repeating patterns created from a limited number of geometric shapes available to craftsmen of the day is similar to the practice of contemporary European [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] artisans. Designers of both styles were concerned with using their inventories of geometrical shapes to create the maximum diversity of forms. This demanded a skill and practice very different from mathematics.&lt;ref name="Topkapi"/&gt;

=== Geometric construction of an interlocking decagram-polygon mosaic design ===
Firstly, divide the right angle A into five parts with same degree by creating four rays that start from A. Find an arbitrary point C on the second ray and drop perpendiculars from C to the sides of angle A counter-clockwise. This step creates the rectangle ABCD along with four segments that each has an endpoint at A and other endpoints are the intersections of the four rays with the two sides of BC and DC of rectangle ABCD. Then, find the midpoint of the fourth segment created from the fourth ray point E. Construct an arc with center A and radius AE to intersect AB at point F and the second ray at point G. The second segment is now a part of the rectangle’s diagonal. Make a line, parallel to AD and passing through point G, that intersects the first ray at point H and the third ray at point I. The line HF passes through point E and intersects the third ray at L and line AD at J. Construct a line, passing through J which is parallel to the third ray. Also construct line EI and find M which is the intersection of this line with AD. From the point F make a parallel line to the third ray to meet the first ray at K. Construct segments GK, GL, and EM. Find the point N such that GI = IN by constructing a circle with center I and radius IG. Construct the line DN which is parallel to GK, to intersect the line emanate from J, to find P to complete the regular pentagon EINPJ. Line DN meets the perpendicular bisector of AB at Q. From Q construct a line parallel to FK to intersect ray MI at R. As shown in the figure, using O which is the center of the rectangle ABCD, as a center of rotation for 180°, one can make the fundamental region for the tiling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:WX20181125-203644@2x.png|thumb|An interlocking decagram-polygon mosaic design]]

[[File:WX20181125-191210@2x.png|alt=|center|thumb|An interlocking decagram-polygon mosaic design]]

=== Geometric construction of A tessellation from Mirza Akbar architectural scrolls ===
First, divide the right angle into five congruent angles, a arbitrary point P was selected on the first ray counterclockwise. For the radius of the circle inscribed in the decagram one half of the segment created from the third ray, segment AM, was selected. The following figure illustrates a step-by-step compass-straightedge visual solution to the problem by the author.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;Note that the way to divide a right angle into five congruent angles is not a part of the instructions provided, because it is considered an elementary step for designers.

&lt;/gallery&gt;The girih has been widely applied on the architecture. To begin with, the patterns on the Persian geometric windows meet the need of the Persian architecture. “The specific types of embellishments utilized in orosi typically linked the windows to the patron’s social and political eminence.”The more ornate a window is, the higher social and economic status the owner is more likely to have. A good example for this would be Azad Koliji. The Azad Koliji is a Dowlatabad Garden in Iran. With the girih patterns on its window, the architects successfully demonstrate multiple layers. The first layer would be the actual garden which people can have a glimpse at when they open the window. In addition to this natural layer, the first girih pattern on the outside of the window (the carved pattern. Another artificial layer would be the colorful glasses on the window. The multi-color layer create a sense of a mass of flowers. This layer is abstract which forms a clear contradiction with the real layer outside the window, and gives the audience enough space to imagine.

== Biography ==
Helga Hošková-Weissová was born in November 1929 in Prague-Libeň to an assimilated Jewish family. Her mother, Irena Fuchsova, was a seamstress and her father, Otto Weiss, worked at the state bank in Prague. She was raised in Prague, and shortly after her tenth birthday on December 10, 1941&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40362598|title=Zeichne, was Du siehst : Zeichnungen eines Kindes aus Theresienstadt/Terezín = Maluj, co vidíš, kresby jednoho dítěte z Terezína = draw what you see, a child's drawings from Theresienstadt|last=1929-|first=Weissová, Helga,|date=1998|publisher=Wallstein|others=Niedersächsischer Verein zur Förderung von Theresienstadt/Terezín.|isbn=9783892443162|location=Göttingen|oclc=40362598}}&lt;/ref&gt;, she and her parents were deported to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Terezín ghetto]]&lt;ref name="jewishmuseum"&gt;From page of Jewish Museum, Prague: {{cite web|url=http://www.jewishmuseum.cz/en/ahoskova.htm|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222061740/http://www.jewishmuseum.cz/en/ahoskova.htm|archivedate=2014-02-22|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2013-02-17|df=}} accessed 17 Feb 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tele"&gt;London Daily Telegraph, 16 Feb 2013, review section, pg 4.&lt;/ref&gt;. Although they were separated in the camp, it was somewhat possible to see each other and exchange clandestine notes&lt;ref name="tele" /&gt;. It is estimated that 15,000 children (younger than 16) were deported to [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Terezín]]&lt;ref name="tele" /&gt;. Less than 100 of the [[Terezín]] children deported to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] survived&lt;ref name="jewishmuseum" /&gt;.

=== Life at Terezín ===
Using her gift for painting and drawing, while at [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Terezín]], Helga wrote a diary that included images from her life in the camp, which survived the war&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.holycross.edu/blog/2005/01/27/holy-cross-hosts-exhibit-featuring-drawings-by-holocaust-survivor-helga-weissova-hoskova/|title=Holy Cross Hosts Exhibit Featuring Drawings by Holocaust Survivor Helga Weissova-Hoskova  - College of the Holy Cross|website=news.holycross.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/artsandculture/8829931/Diary-of-schoolgirl-who-outwitted-Nazi-Angel-of-Death-to-become-publishing-sensation.html|title=Diary of schoolgirl who outwitted Nazi Angel of Death to become publishing sensation - Telegraph&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tele" /&gt;. Her father said to her in December 1941, "draw what you see," she did exactly that. She was held captive in what was called the Girl's Home in room twenty four. Her drawings are a testimony of what everyday life was like for Jews in [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Terezín]].

=== Deportation to Auschwitz and the End of the War ===
In October 1944 at the age of 15, she and her mother were deported to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. Whenever new victims arrived, they were sorted. The ones sent to the left went straight to the gas chambers to die, and the ones sent to the right to complete forced labor until death. The person sorting that day may have been the infamous Josef Mengele&lt;ref name="tele" /&gt;. Helga convinced him she was old enough to work by claiming she was 18 and was told to go to the right&lt;ref name="tele" /&gt;. She also successfully claimed that her mother was younger than she was which saved her mother's life&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;. After ten days, she was transferred from [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] to [[Freiberg subcamp|Freiberg]] near Dresden&lt;ref name="jewishmuseum" /&gt;, an auxiliary camp of [[Flossenbürg concentration camp|Flossenbürg]] labor camp where she escaped death. She was then forced to join a 16-day [[Death marches (Holocaust)|death march]] to the camp at [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp complex|Mauthausen]]&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/16/schoolgirl-who-fooled-the-nazis|title=The schoolgirl who survived the Holocaust by fooling the Nazis|last1=Thorpe|first1=Vanessa|last2=arts|first2=|date=15 October 2011|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com|last3=correspondent|first3=media}}&lt;/ref&gt;. She remained there until the camp's liberation on the 5th of May, 1945 by the US Army.

=== Life After World War II and the Holocaust ===
After World War II ended, Helga went back to Prague and studied at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Prague|Academy of Fine Arts]]. She also studied under the Czech artist [[Emil Filla]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isurvived.org/Survivors_Folder/Weissova_Helga-artworkExp.html|title=Helga Weissova-Hoskova, a Holocaust Survivor of Terezin, exhibits her artwork|website=isurvived.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1950. She worked as an artist and raised a family&lt;ref name="tele" /&gt;. After the [[Velvet Revolution]] in November 1989, she exhibited her art many times both in Prague and in other places in Europe&lt;ref name="jewishmuseum" /&gt;.

==== Awards and Legacy ====
In 1993, she was awarded an honorary Doctorate by the [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]] in Boston for her lifetime achievements. In 2009, she was also awarded the [[Josef Hlávka]] medal. In October 2009, [[Václav Klaus|Vaclav Klaus]] presented her with the Medal of Merit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/klaus-udelil-vyznamenani-ocenil-hrdiny-z-valky-gotta-i-zokeje-vanu-1d6-/domaci.asp?c=A091028_203022_domaci_cem|title=Klaus udělil vyznamenání.

In 2009, she was interviewed by a nonprofit, [[Post Bellum]], for their Stories of the 20th Century Project. 

As of February 2013, at the age of 83, Helga still lives in the flat she was born in and the same flat from which she was deported from in 1944&lt;ref name="tele" /&gt;.

'''Heqaib''', also '''Hekaib''' or '''Hekayeb''', was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[nomarch]] of the 1st ''[[Nome (Egypt)|nomos]]'' of [[Upper Egypt]] ("[[Ta-Seti|Land of the Bow]]") under king [[Pepi II Neferkare]], towards the end of the [[6th Dynasty]]. He was also an officer in charge of military expeditions in [[Nubia]].

== Career ==

His real name was '''Pepinakht''' (''ppjj-nḫt'' - "[King] Pepi is strong"&lt;ref name=Ranke132/&gt;). As officer, he led at least three expeditions. All of these are registered on the façade of his tomb at [[Qubbet el-Hawa]] (near [[Aswan]]), after a long list of his titles.&lt;br&gt;
In the first expedition, Pepinakht led a surprise attack in the lands of [[Historical names of Nubia|''Wawat'' and ''Irthet'']], slaying many warriors and taking many prisoners to the court of the [[pharaoh]]. Then, he was sent back to the same places (second expedition) where he captured some chieftains, and also brought back a booty. For his third expedition, Pepinakht was instructed to bring back the corpse of Enenkhet; he was an expedition leader in charge to build a ship to reach the [[Land of Punt]], but he was attacked and killed along with his escort by the "sand dwellers". Pepinakht's [[autobiography]] abruptly ends while he was attacking the "sand dwellers". However, it's very likely that he was able to accomplish even this mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Breasted|first=James H.|author-link=James Henry Breasted|title=Ancient Records of Egypt, vol 1|year=1907|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=|pp=}}§§ 355-360&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
His capabilities and charisma earned him the nickname '''''Heqaib''''' (''ḥq3-ỉb'' - "He who controls his heart") and then, after his death, a quick [[apotheosis]].&lt;ref name=Lexi&gt;{{cite book|last=Habachi|first=Labib|author-link=Labib Habachi|chapter=Heqaib|title=Lexikon der Ägyptologie.

One box bears the name of Heqaib.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Dorm: ''Elephantine XXXI, Kisten und Schreine im Festzug, Hinweise auf postume Kulte für hohe Beamte aus einem Depot von Kult- und anderen Gegenständen des ausgehenden 3.

(Archäologische Veröffentlichungen 117), Wiesbaden 2015, {{ISBN|978-3-447-10481-4}}, p. 166-175&lt;/ref&gt; These boxes were most likely used in rituals around the funerary cult of the people mentioned on them.

== Legacy ==
[[File:Sanctuary of Heqaib.jpg|thumb|Shrines dating to the reign of [[Senusret I]] in the sanctuary of Heqaib]]
Shortly after Heqaib's death and divinization, a great number of people started to worship this "local saint" initially in front of his tomb at Qubbet el-Hawa, and later in a purpose-built sanctuary. From the various documents left by those devotees it is known that many of them were named "Heqaib" in his honour, and even some pharaohs are known to having left dedications in the sanctuary: among the royal statues found here can be mentioned those of [[Mentuhotep I]] (although posthumous), [[Intef II]], [[Senusret III]], [[Sekhemkare|Sekhemkare Amenemhat V]], [[Neferhotep I]], and [[Sobekemsaf I|Sekhemre-Wadjkhaw Sobekemsaf I]], while it is known that [[Intef III]] ordered a restoration of the sanctuary during the early [[11th Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=Lexi/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Heqaib's distant successors during the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] such as [[Sarenput I]], [[Sarenput II]] and [[Heqaib III]], expanded the sanctuary by building shrines dedicated to him and to themselves. However, with the advent of the troubled [[Second Intermediate Period]] the sanctuary was progressively abandoned and filled with debris, until its rediscovery by [[Edouard Ghazouli]] in 1932 and the subsequent excavations by himself and [[Labib Habachi]].&lt;ref name=Lexi/&gt;

[[File:XRF-the don hiyala &amp; alifulhu story.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Donhiyala's death from the story ''Donhiyala and Alifulhu'', Maldivian version of the [[Ramayana|Rāmāyana]]]] 
'''Hinduism in the Maldives''' describes the practice of the Hindu religion in the [[Maldives]] archipelago. Hinduism generally fit between the earlier [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]] and the subsequent transition to [[Islam]]. Archaeological remains survive from the 8th or 9th century CE portraying Hindu deities such as [[Shiva]], [[Lakshmi]] and the sage [[Agastya]].&lt;ref name="Romero-Frias"&gt;[[Xavier Romero-Frias]], ''The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom''. Barcelona 1999, {{ISBN|84-7254-801-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maldivian folklore contains legends about the sage [[Vashishta]], known locally as Oditan Kalēge, a mighty [[magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]]. Oditan Kalēge's wife is the beautiful Dōgi Aihā who possesses a fiery temperament and is as powerful a sorceress as her husband. Her name is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[Yogini]]''.&lt;ref name="Romero-Frias"/&gt;

It is not known why the last Buddhist king embraced [[Islam]]. The importance of the [[Arabs]] as traders in the [[Indian Ocean]] by the 12th century may partly explain why this king acted. He adopted the [[Muslim]] title and name (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) of [[Sultan]] (discarding the old [[Maldivian language|Divehi]] title of ''Maha radun'' or ''Ras Kilege'') Muhammad al Adil, initiating a series of six Islamic dynasties consisting of 84 sultans and [[Sultana (title)|sultanas]] that lasted until 1932, when the [[sultanate]] became elective.

According to [[Marinid dynasty|Merinid]] traveller [[Ibn Batuta]], the person responsible for this conversion was [[Sunni Islam|Muslim]] visitor Abu al Barakat from [[Morocco]]. However, a more reliable Maldivian tradition says that he was a [[Persian people|Persian]] saint from [[Tabriz]] called Yusuf Shamsuddin. He is also referred to as Tabrizugefaanu. His venerated tomb stands on the grounds of the Friday Mosque, or Hukuru miski, in [[Malé]]. Built in 1656, this is the oldest mosque in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;[[History of the Maldives]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Don Hiyala and Alifulhu==

Among [[Maldivian folklore]] in which the spirit and sorcery theme are not essential, the most significant is perhaps "Don Hiyalā and Alifulhu". This story about two good-looking lovers is a much changed, Maldivian version of the [[Ramayana|Rāmāyana]]. Despite the apparent dissimilarities, the common sequential structure&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folktale'', Austin, Texas, 1984, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; linking the elements of the Maldivian story with the Indian epic (the heroic married couple, the wicked and powerful king, the kidnapping of the beautiful heroine, etc.) is evident. This is hardly unexpected, for all South and Southeast Asian countries have local Rāmayāna variations and the Maldives is part of [[South Asia]]n culture.&lt;ref name="Romero-Frias"/&gt;

==Indians in Maldives and their status==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
An estimated 9,000 Indian citizens reside in the Maldives, according to 2000 census figures.

The Indian Diaspora is mainly composed of doctors, teachers, engineers, accountants, managers and other professionals. They have helped the country to develop its human resources. The group also includes skilled and unskilled personnel such as technicians, masons, tailors, plumbers and laborers.

One Maldivian citizen is of Indian origin. Both historically and commercially, south coast Indians, particularly from [[Kerala]], were in close and regular contact with the Maldives. These contacts did not metamorphose into a composite socio-cultural group, perhaps owing to the exclusive Islamic identity of the Maldives and its people.

Officially no Maldivians are Hindus. The state religion is [[Sunni Islam]] and [[religious conversion|conversion]] is not allowed. Maldivian customs laws prohibit import of any idol for the purpose of worship. Hindus in the Maldives are predominantly of [[Tamil people|Tamil]] or [[Malayali]] origin. 

==Cultural affinity ==

[[Bollywood|Hindi]] songs are popular in the Maldives, especially older ones from [[Mohammed Rafi]], [[Mukesh (singer)|Mukesh]], [[Lata Mangeshkar]], [[Asha Bhonsle]], [[Pankaj Udhas]] and [[Manhar Udhas]]. Most popular Maldivian songs are based on (or influenced by) Hindi songs. Similarly, popular local dances are [[North India]]n dances, especially [[Kathak]]. The local dance of Maldives is called bodu beru, usually carried out by men, with a [[bodu beru (drum)|bodu beru]] (a drum-like instrument) keeping the beat.

The four major Sufi brotherhoods are all represented in Ivory Coast, although the Qadiriya, founded in the eleventh century, and the Tidjaniya, founded in the eighteenth century, are most popular. The Qadiriya is prevalent in the west, and the Tidjaniya, in the east. The other two major Islamic brotherhoods have few adherents in Ivory Coast. The Senoussiya is identified with [[Libya]], where its influence is substantial. [[Ahmadiyya]] movement is also present in Ivory Coast.

The significant religious authority is the [[marabout]]. He is believed to be a miracle worker, a physician, and a mystic, who exercises both magical and [[moral authority]]. He is also respected as a dispenser of [[amulets]], which protect the wearer—Muslim or non-Muslim—against evil. The influence of marabouts has produced a number of reactions in Ivoirian society, among them a series of reformist movements. These reform movements often condemn Sufism and marabouts as un-Islamic, but the poor see that marabouts often speak out on behalf of the downtrodden.

[[Hamallism]] began as an Islamic reform movement in the [[French Sudan]] early in the twentieth century and has provided a channel for expressing political and religious discontent. Its founder, [[Hamallah]], was exiled from the French Sudan to Ivory Coast during the 1930s. He preached Islamic reform tempered by tolerance of many local practices, but he condemned many aspects of Sufism. Orthodox brotherhoods were able to convince the French authorities in Ivory Coast that Hamallah had been responsible for earlier political uprisings in the French Sudan. Authorities then expelled Hamallah from Ivory Coast and banned his teachings.

The massive immigration of Muslims from the Muslim majority countries [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Mali]] helped to increase the number of Muslims substantially.

'''[[Islam]]''' is the largest minority religion in [[Rwanda]], practiced by 4.6% of the total population according to 2006 census.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90115.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007: Rwanda]. United States [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor]] (September 14, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually all Muslims in [[Rwanda]] are [[Sunni]]. [[Islam]] was first introduced into [[Rwanda]] by Muslim traders from the East Coast of Africa in the 18th century. Since its introduction, Muslims have been a minority in the territory, while the Roman Catholic Church, introduced to Rwandans during the colonial period in the late 19th century is the largest religion in the country.

For the first time in its history in Rwanda, Islam is accorded the same rights and freedoms as Christianity. Estimates show that there are equal numbers of Muslims among the [[Hutu]]s as there are among the [[Tutsi]]s.&lt;ref name = "USIP"&gt;

==History==
===Colonial history===
Compared to [[East Africa]]n countries such as [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], and [[Uganda]], the history of Islam in Rwanda is relatively modern. While a few written sources are available regarding its origins, it is claimed that Islam came through [[Afro-Arab|Arab]] traders from [[Zanzibar]] who first entered the country in 1901. Alternatively, it has been argued that Islam arrived during the colonial period when Muslim clerks, administrative assistants, and merchants from the [[Swahili language|Swahili]]-speaking coast of [[Tanganyika]] were brought to the country. Islam was also bolstered by Muslim merchants from the [[Indian subcontinent]], who married local Rwandans. Rwandans built their first [[mosque]] in 1913.&lt;ref name="USIP"/&gt; This mosque is known as [[Al-Fatah Mosque, Kigali|Al-Fatah Mosque]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodrique Ngowi. "Rwandan Muslims". Associated press.&lt;/ref&gt;

During its history, many efforts were made to impede the spread of Islam in Rwanda. These efforts generally exploited [[Anti-Arabism|anti-Arab sentiment]], and presented Muslims as foreigners. [[Missionary#Christian missions|Catholic missionaries]] often went to great lengths to counter what they perceived influence of rival religions, such as Islam and [[Protestantism]].&lt;ref name = "Kubai"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kubai |first=Anne |author-link= |co-authors= |title=Walking a Tightrope: Christians and Muslims in Post-Genocide Rwanda |journal=Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=219–235 |publisher=Routledge, part of the Taylor &amp; Francis Group |location= |date=April 2007 |doi=10.1080/09596410701214076 |id= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims were further marginalized by the fact that most Muslims settled in urban areas, whereas 90 percent of the population was rural. As neither [[Arab]] nor Indian merchants ever attempted to further their faith, there was little spirit of [[Missionary#Islamic missions|preaching among Muslims]]. Only a few conversions took place, mostly among the marginalized urban population: women who had married foreigners, [[Illegitimacy|illegitimate children]] and [[orphan]]s. Even these conversion were sometimes superficial, motivated by desire for social and economic security that Muslims provided, than for religious conviction in the Islamic faith.&lt;ref name = "Bulabubi"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bulabubi |first=S. Bakatu |author-link= |co-authors= |title=Review: L'Islam et les "Swahili" au Rwanda |journal=Journal of Religion in Africa |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=176–177 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] |location= |date=May 1991 |doi=10.2307/1580806 |id= |access-date= |jstor=1580806 |last2=Kagabo |first2=Jose Hamim }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[History of Rwanda#Belgian colonialism|Belgian administration]], Muslims in Rwanda were to some extent marginalized. Since Muslims had no place in the [[Catholic Church]], which maintained great influence over the state, Muslims were often excluded from education and important jobs in the government. As a result, Muslim employment was largely confined to engaging in petty trade, and taking up jobs as drivers.&lt;ref name="Kubai"/&gt;

===After independence===
In 1960, the former government minister [[Isidore Sebazungu]] ordered the burning of the Muslim quarter and the mosque in [[Rwamagana]]. Following this event, Muslims were terrified and many of them fled to neighbouring countries. It is alleged that the Catholic Church was involved in these events, which aggravated the bitterness between Muslims and Christians.&lt;ref name = "Kubai"/&gt;

Before the [[Rwandan Genocide]] of 1994, Muslims were held in low regard, because they were seen as traders, in a land where farmers are highly regarded. The Muslim population before the genocide was 4% which was unusually low compared to that of neighbouring countries. Muslims were also affected by the genocide. There were only a few incidents in which Tutsis in mosques were attacked. The most widely known example occurred at [[Nyamirambo]] Main Mosque, where hundreds of Tutsi had gathered to take refuge. The refugees in the mosque fought off Hutu militias with stones, bows and arrows, putting up stiff resistance against the soldiers and militia of the ''[[Interahamwe]]''. Only once the soldiers attacked with machine gun fire were the ''Interahamwe'' able to enter the mosque and kill the refugees.&lt;ref name = "USIP"/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Personal accounts relate how some Tutsi converted for safety, as they feared continuing reprisal killings by Hutu extremists, and knew that Muslims would protect them from such acts. Many Hutu converted as well, in search for "purification". Many Hutu want to leave their violent past behind them and to not have "blood on their hands". There are also a few isolated instances where Hutu have converted in the hope that they could hide within the Muslim community and thereby escape arrest.&lt;ref name = "USIP"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "BBC"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of conversions slowed in 1997. According to the [[mufti]] of Rwanda, the Islamic community has not seen any increases in conversions in 2002/2003.&lt;ref name = "Religious Freedom"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2003/23746.htm Rwanda - International Religious Freedom Report 2003], ''2003 Report on International Religious Freedom''.
&lt;/ref&gt; Christianity remains as the country's leading religion. Catholicism (which arrived in the late 19th century with the [[White Fathers]] order of the Roman Catholic Church) remains deeply embedded in the culture.&lt;ref name = "NYT"&gt;{{cite news

==Activities==
Muslims in Rwanda are also actively involved in social activities, such as their [[jihad]] to "start respecting each other". Many Rwandan Muslims are engaged in efforts to heal ethnic tensions after the genocide, are Islamic groups are reaching out to the disadvantaged, for example by forming women's groups that provide education on child care. Western governments have worried over the growing influence of Islam, and some government officials have express concern that some of the mosques receive funding from Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost"/&gt; However, there is little evidence of militancy.&lt;ref name="Tiemessen"&gt;

Paper presented at the Annual General Meeting of the Canadian Political Science Association, London, Ontario.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Muslim religious holiday [[Eid al-Fitr]] is observed by the government as one of the four religious official holiday (alongside [[Christmas]], [[All Saints' Day]], and [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]). Muslims also operate private Islamic schools. In 2003, the [[US Embassy]] oversaw the renovations of an Islamic secondary school in Kigali. Embassy leaders also met with Muslim leaders, alongside members of Catholic and [[Anglican Church]]es, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]]s, and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], to hold interfaith talks.&lt;ref name="Religious Freedom"/&gt;

Rwanda used to have a religious political party, the [[Islamic Democratic Party (Rwanda)|Democratic Islamic Party]] (PDI), with non-Muslim members. However, it changed its name to Ideal Democratic Party, after the constitution mandated no party may be formed on the basis of religion.&lt;ref name = "Religious Freedom"/&gt;

==Population==
There is a considerable range in the estimates of the Muslim population of Rwanda. No accurate census of the Muslim population has been done.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

[[Image:Jamshid Halved.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Persian people|Persian]] painting, depicting Jamshid halved before [[Zahhak]]]]

'''Jamshid ''' ({{IPA-fa|dʒæmˈʃiːd|}}) &lt;!-- ǰæmšīd --&gt; ({{lang-fa|جمشید}}, ''Jamshīd'') ([[Middle Persian|Middle-]] and [[New Persian]]: جم, ''Jam'') ([[Avestan language|Avestan]]: ''Yima'') is a mythological figure of [[Greater Iran]]ian culture and tradition.

In tradition and folklore, Jamshid is described as the fourth and greatest king of the epigraphically unattested [[Pishdadian Dynasty]] (before the [[Kayanian dynasty]]). This role is already alluded to in [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] scripture (e.g. ''[[Yasht]]'' 19, ''[[Vendidad]]'' 2), where the figure appears as [[Avestan language]] Yima(-Kshaeta) "(radiant) Yima," and from which the name 'Jamshid' is derived.

''Jamshid'' remains a common Iranian and Zoroastrian male name. [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]] transliterated the name as ''Jamshyd''. In the eastern regions of [[Greater Iran]], [[Central Asia]], and by the [[Zoroastrians]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]] it is rendered as ''[[Jamshed]]''.

==Etymology==
The name ''Jamshid'' is originally a compound of two parts, ''Jam'' and ''shid'', corresponding to the [[Avestan language|Avestan]] names ''Yima'' and ''Xšaēta'', derived from the proto-Iranian ''*Yamah Xšaitah''. ''Yamah'' and the related Sanskrit ''[[Yama]]'' are interpreted as "the twin," perhaps reflecting an Indo-Iranian belief in a primordial Yama and Yami pair. By regular sound changes (y → j, and the loss of the final syllable) Avestan ''Yima'' became Middle Persian ''Jam'', which was subsequently continued into New Persian.

There are also a few functional parallels between Avestan Yima and Sanskrit Yama, for instance, ''Yima'' was the son of ''Vivaŋhat'', who in turn corresponds to the Vedic ''Vivasvat'', "he who shines out", a divinity of the Sun. Both Yamas in Iranian and Indian myth guard Hell with the help of two four-eyed dogs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/iml/iml08.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherman2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sherman, Josepha |title=Storytelling: An Encyclopedia of Mythology and Folklore|date=August 2008|publisher=Sharpe Reference|isbn=978-0-7656-8047-1|pages=118–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Xšaitah'' meant "bright, shining" or "radiant" and is probably cognate with the Sanskrit word "[[Shrestha]]". By regular sound changes (initial xš → š (sh); ai → ē; t → d between vowels; and dropping of the final syllable) ''xšaitah'' became Persian ''shēd'' or ''shid''. In the [[Western Iranian languages]] such as [[Persian language|Persian]], the vowel /ē/ is pronounced as /i/. Consequently, ''Jamshēd'' (as it is still pronounced in [[Tajikistan]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]]) is now pronounced ''Jamshid'' in [[Iran]]. The suffix ''-shid'' is the same as that found in other names such as ''khorshid'' ("the Sun" from Avestan ''hvarə-xšaēta'' "radiant Sun").

The modern [[Turkish language|Turkish]] name ''[[Cem (given name)|Cem]]'' is derived from Persian ''Jam''.

One contributor has posited that Persian ''jam''  is the root of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''[[ajam]]'', assuming that this Arabic word for the Persian-speaking population was derived from a Persian endonym, meaning the people of Jam. However, this is incorrect. ʿAjam comes from the Arabic root ʿ(ʿayn) ج (jim) م (mim), meaning to speak gibberish, and was used among Arabs, initially, for all peoples who spoke languages that were incomprehensible to Arabic speakers, whether they spoke Persian, Fulani, or a Turkic language.  Persian speakers later adopted this label to distinguish themselves from Arabic speakers. The word ʿajam or ʿajami is still used in other parts of the Islamic world to denote languages other than Arabic, particularly in the Saharan and sub-Saharan regions.

==In scripture==
&lt;small&gt;Quotations in the following section are from [[James Darmesteter]]'s translation [http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd2sbe.htm] of the ''Vendidad '', as published in the 1898 American edition of [[Max Müller]]'s ''[[Sacred Books of the East]]''&lt;/small&gt;

In the second chapter of the ''[[Vendidad]]'' of the [[Avesta]], the omniscient Creator [[Ahura Mazda]] asks Yima, a good shepherd, to receive his law and bring it to men. However, Yima refuses, and so Ahura Mazda charges him with a different mission: to rule over and nourish the earth, to see that the living things prosper. This Yima accepts, and Ahura Mazda presents him with a golden seal and a dagger inlaid with gold.

Yima rules as king for three hundred years, and soon the earth was full of men, flocks of birds and herds of animals. He deprived the ''daevas'', who were demonic servants of the evil Ahriman, of wealth, herds and reputation during his reign.  Good men, however, lived lives of plenty, and were neither sick nor aged. Father and son walked together, each appearing no older than fifteen.  Ahura Mazda visits him once more, warning him of this overpopulation. Yima, shining with light, faced southwards and pressed the golden seal against the earth and boring into it with the poniard, says "O [[Armaiti|Spenta Armaiti]], kindly open asunder and stretch thyself afar, to bear flocks and herds and men."

The earth swells and Yima rules for another six hundred years before the same problem occurred once more. Once again he pressed the seal and dagger to the earth and asked the ground to swell up to bear more men and beasts, and the earth swells again. Nine hundred years later, the earth was full again. The same solution is employed, the earth swelling again.

The next part of the story tells of a meeting of Ahura Mazda and the [[Yazata]]s in ''[[Airyanem Vaejah]]'', the first of the "perfect lands". Yima attends with a group of "the best of mortals", where Ahura Mazda warns him of an upcoming catastrophe: "O fair Yima, son of Vivaŋhat! Upon the material world the evil winters are about to fall, that shall bring the fierce, deadly frost; upon the material world the evil winters are about to fall, that shall make snow-flakes fall thick, even an arədvi deep on the highest tops of mountains."

Ahura Mazda advises Yima to construct a ''Vara'' (Avestan: enclosure) in the form of a multi-level cavern underground, two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) long and two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) wide. This he is to populate with the fittest of men and women; and with two of every animal, bird and plant; and supply with food and water gathered the previous summer. Yima creates the Vara by crushing the earth with a stamp of his foot, and kneading it into shape as a potter does clay. He creates streets and buildings, and brings nearly two thousand people to live therein. He creates artificial light, and finally seals the Vara with a golden ring.

Over time, the Avestan hero ''Yima Xšaēta'' became the world-ruling Shāh ''Jamshid'' of [[Persia]]n legend and mythology.

According to the [[Shahnameh|Shāhnāma]] of the poet [[Ferdowsi|Firdausī]], Jamshid was the fourth king of the world. He had command over all the angels and demons of the world, and was both king and high priest of Hormozd ([[middle Persian]] for [[Ahura Mazda]]). He was responsible for a great many inventions that made life more secure for his people: the manufacture of armor and weapons, the weaving and dyeing of clothes of linen, silk and wool, the building of houses of brick, the mining of jewels and precious metals, the making of perfumes and wine, the art of medicine, the navigation of the waters of the world in sailing ships. The ''[[sudreh]]'' and ''[[kushti]]'' of the [[Zoroastrianism]] are also attributed to Jamshid. From the skin-clad followers of [[Keyumars]], humanity had risen to a great civilization in Jamshid's time.

Jamshid also divided the people into four groups:
* [[Kātouzians]]: The priests who conducted the worship of Hormozd
* Neysārians: The warriors who protected the people by the might of their arms
* Nāsoudians: The farmers who grew the grain that fed the people
* Hotokhoshians: The artisans, who produced goods for the ease and enjoyment of the people

Jamshid had now become the greatest monarch the world had ever known. He was endowed with the royal ''farr'' ([[Avestan language|Avestan]]: ''[[khvarena]]''), a radiant splendor that burned about him by divine favor. One day he sat upon a jewel-studded throne and the [[daeva|''div''s]] who served him raised his throne up into the air and he flew through the sky. His subjects, all the peoples of the world, marvelled and praised him. On this day, which was the first of the month of [[Fravashi|Farvardin]], they first celebrated the holiday of ''[[Norouz|Nawrōz]]'' ("new day"). In the variant of the [[Zoroastrian calendar]] followed by the Zoroastrians of India, the first day of the month of Farvardin is still called ''Jamshēd-i Nawrōz''.

Jamshid was said to have had a magical seven-ringed cup, the ''[[Cup of Jamshid|Jām-e Jam]]'' which was filled with the elixir of immortality and allowed him to observe the universe.

Jamshid's capital was erroneously believed to be at the site of the ruins of [[Persepolis]], which for centuries (down to 1620 CE) was called ''Takht-i Jamshēd'', the "Throne of Jamshid".
However, Persepolis was actually the capital of the [[Achaemenid]] kings and was destroyed by [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]. Similarly, the sculptured tombs of the Achaemenids and [[Sassanid Empire|Sāsānians]] near Persepolis were believed to be images of the legendary hero [[Rostam]], and so were called ''[[Naqsh-e Rustam]]''.

The city of [[Jamkaran]] is named after Jamshid {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

Jamshid ruled well for three hundred years. During this time longevity increased, sicknesses were banished, and peace and prosperity reigned. But Jamshid's pride grew with his power, and he began to forget that all the blessings of his reign were due to God. He boasted to his people that all of the good things they had came from him alone, and demanded that he should be accorded divine honors, as if he were the Creator.

From this time the ''farr'' departed from Jamshid, and the people began to murmur and rebel against him. Jamshid repented in his heart, but his glory never returned to him. The vassal ruler of [[Arabia]], [[Zahhak|Zahhāk]], under the influence of [[Angra Mainyu|Ahriman]], made war upon Jamshid, and he was welcomed by many of Jamshid's dissatisfied subjects. Jamshid fled from his capital halfway across the world, but he was finally trapped by Zahhāk and brutally murdered. After a reign of seven hundred years, humanity descended from the heights of civilization back into a Dark Age.

===Legend of the discovery of wine===
King Jamshid is featured prominently in one [[apocryphal]] tale associated with the [[history of wine]] and its discovery. According to Persian legend, the king banished one of his [[harem]] ladies from his kingdom, causing her to become despondent and wishing to commit [[suicide]]. Going to the king's warehouse, the girl sought out a jar marked "[[poison]]" which contained the remnants of grapes that had spoiled and were deemed undrinkable. Unbeknownst to her, the "spoilage" was actually the result of [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] caused by the breakdown of the grapes by [[yeast]] into [[alcohol]]. After drinking the so-called poison, the harem girl discovered its effects to be pleasant and her spirits were lifted. She took her discovery to the king, who became so enamored with this new "wine" beverage that he not only accepted the girl back into his harem but also decreed that all grapes grown in [[Persepolis]] would be devoted to winemaking. While most wine historians view this story as pure legend, there is archaeological evidence that wine was known and extensively traded by the early Persian kings.&lt;ref name="Pellechia pg XI-XII"&gt;T.

The '''Jewish Public Library (JPL)''', located in [[Montreal]], is a constituent agency of [[Federation CJA]] (Combined Jewish Appeal). The library contains the largest [[circulating library|circulating collection]] of [[Judaica]] in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishpubliclibrary.org/en/aboutus/collections/|title=Jewish Public Library -  Collections - About Us|last=Library|first=Jewish Public|website=www.jewishpubliclibrary.org|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;Founded in 1914, the JPL has close to 4000 members, and receives 700 to 800 visitors weekly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishpubliclibrary.org/en/general+information/faq++ask+us+a+question/#members|title=Jewish Public Library -  FAQ / Ask us a question - General Information|last=Library|first=Jewish Public|website=www.jewishpubliclibrary.org|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is independent of the [[Montreal Public Libraries Network]] and instead receives its funding from [[Jews in Montreal|the city's Jewish community]], membership fees, donations and endowments.

==History==
Founded in 1914, the library's early history is grounded in the [[Yiddish]]-speaking immigrants who fled Europe at the turn of the 20th century. The early homes of the JPL were in rented [[cold water flat]]s on St. Urbain Street and, for 20 years, on the corner of Esplanade Avenue and Mount-Royal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://digitool.Library.McGill.CA:80/R/-?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=64813&amp;silo_library=GEN01|title=The Jewish Public Library of Montreal, 1914-1952|last=Gubbary|first=Sharon Rachel|publisher=McGill University, Faculty of Education|year=1983|isbn=|location=Montreal, QC|pages=89-92|oclc=92985005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1970s, the patterns of Jewish migration within the city had made it apparent that the library should move again, to be nearer to other Jewish agencies and organizations. The [[Segal Centre for Performing Arts]], YM-YWHA [[Jewish community center|Jewish community centre]], [[Montreal Holocaust Memorial Centre]], and all [[Federation CJA]] offices are now within a campus on the corner of Cote Ste. Catherine Road and Westbury Avenue in Montreal's Côte-des-Neiges sector.

==Collection==
[[File:Lea Roback.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Léa Roback]] photo in the collection of the Jewish Public Library Archives, Montreal]]  
Its collection of over 150,000-item is accessible online, including specialist collections in five languages. The Children’s Library offers programs and activities with more than 30,000 items for children up to 14 years of age.  The JPL is a full service lending and research [[library]]. 75% of the collection is [[Judaica]], 25% general interest and popular fiction.

The collection itself is oriented towards both [[academic]] and popular readerships, the Judaica collection being akin to most university library's Judaic collections&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://mcgill.worldcat.org/title/preliminary-guide-to-the-jewish-canadiana-collection-of-the-jewish-public-library/oclc/8908013&amp;referer=brief_results|title=A preliminary guide to the Jewish Canadiana Collection of the Jewish Public Library|last=Jewish Public Library (Montréal|first=Quebec)|last2=Collection of Jewish Canadiana|last3=Caruso|first3=Naomi|last4=Cukier|first4=Golda|last5=Finegold|first5=Ronald|date=1981|publisher=Jewish Public Library|location=Montreal|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A significant membership of Montreal's [[orthodox Jews]] also use the library for religious and Jewish canonical works. The general collection attempts a diversity of popular and literary fiction, as well as an AV collection of first-run films on VHS and DVD, and audiobooks in Yiddish.  The Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Mass. has digitized many of these tapes and made them available on compact disc and free online in a joint project. The JPL's collections are primarily in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Hebrew]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]], with other languages comprising works in its special non-circulating collections. Special collections include&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://mcgill.worldcat.org/title/guide-to-the-archival-holdings-at-the-jewish-public-library-of-montreal-repertoire-des-fonds-darchives-de-la-bibliotheque-publique-juive-de-montreal/oclc/25917273&amp;referer=brief_results|title=A guide to the archival holdings at the Jewish Public Library of Montreal = Répertoire des fonds d'archives de la Bibliothèque publique juive de Montréal|last=Jewish Public Library (Montréal|first=Québec)|last2=Archives|last3=Silverstone|first3=Florence Cymbalista|last4=Rosaminer|first4=Rose Switzman|date=1991|publisher=Jewish Public Library Archives|location=Montreal|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

'''Joseph ben Abraham Gikatilla''' (1248 &amp;ndash; after 1305) ({{lang-he-n|יוסף בן אברהם ג'יקטיליה}}, {{lang-es|Chiquitilla}}, "the very little one") was a Spanish [[kabbalist]], student of [[Abraham Abulafia]].

==Biography==
Born at [[Medinaceli]], [[Old Castile]], Gikatilla was for some time a pupil of the kabbalist [[Abraham Abulafia]], by whom he is highly praised; his [[kabbalistic]] knowledge became so profound that he was supposed to be able to work miracles, and on this account was called "Joseph Ba'al ha-Nissim".. (the Thaumaturge or literally Master of Miracles; [[Zacuto]], ''Yuḥasin,'' p.&amp;nbsp;224a). Like his master, Gikatilla occupied himself with mystic combinations and transpositions of letters and numbers; indeed, Abulafia considered him as the continuator of his school ([[Adolf Jellinek]], ''B.H.'' iii, p. xl). But Gikatilla was not an adversary of [[philosophy]]; on the contrary, he tried to reconcile philosophy with kabbalah, declaring that the latter is the foundation of the former. He, however, strove after the higher science, that is, [[mysticism]]. His works in general represent a progressive development of philosophical insight into mysticism. His first work shows that he had considerable knowledge of secular sciences, and that he was familiar with the works of [[Ibn Gabirol]], [[Abraham ibn Ezra|Ibn Ezra]], [[Maimonides]], and others. He died at [[Penafiel, Portugal|Peñafiel]] after 1305.

In different manuscripts of the work the author's name is variously written "Gribzul," "Karnitol," and "Necatil," all corruptions of "Gikatilla."

==Works==
[[File:Portae Lucis, Joseph Gikatilla.jpg|thumb|right|250px| ''Portae Lucis'', Latin translation of Gikatilla's work ''Shaarei Ora - Gates of Light'']]
===''Ginnat Egoz''===
Gikatilla was a prolific writer; he wrote his first work (''Ginnat Egoz'', {{Hebrew|גנת אגוז}}) when only twenty-six.
It is a kabbalistic treatise in three parts ([[Hanau]], 1615).

* The title (from [[Song of Solomon|Cant]]. vi.11). It literally means "garden of nuts,". Kabalisitically, "Ginnat" consisting of the initials of "[[Gematria|Gemaṭria]]," "[[Notarikon|Noṭariḳon]]," "[[Temurah (Kabbalah)|Temurah]]", the three main elements of Kabbala, while "Egoz" (the nut) is the emblem of mysticism.
* The first part, in five chapters, treats of the various [[Names of God in Judaism|names of God]] occurring in the [[Bible]]. According to Gikatilla, "YHVH" is the only name which represents the substance of God; the other names are merely predicates of the divine attributes. "YHVH" stands for God as He is, while "Elohim" denotes God as the creative power. The name "ẓeba'ot" (hosts), he says, applies to all the beings of the three natures, earthly, heavenly (or spheres), and spirits (or forms). The interpretation of "ẓeba'ot" as ("host of letters") leads him over to the second part.
* The second part treats of the letters of the alphabet. He declares that the number ten emanated from YHVH, the primitive cause, and is the source of all being; he attempts to prove his statement by different combinations based on religion, philosophy, physics, and mysticism. He shows that the [[Talmudic]] view that space is filled with spirits agrees with the belief of the philosophers that there is no vacuum. He also treats here of the revolutions of the sun and moon, giving the relative sizes of the planets.
* The third part is a treatise, in four chapters, on the vowels. The three primitive vowels, "ḥolem," "shuruḳ," and "ḥiriḳ," represent the upper, middle, and lower worlds; the three compound ones, "ẓere," "segol," and "shewa," represent the composition or the construction of the worlds; the "pataḥ" and "ḳameẓ" represent their movements.

Gikatilla at times criticizes the ''[[Sefer Yetzirah|Sefer Yeẓirah]]'' and the ''Pirḳe Hekalot.'' The seven heavens ([[Moed|Ḥag]]. 12a) are identified by him with the seven planets. He holds [[Maimonides]] in great esteem even when he opposes him, and quotes him very often. Other authorities quoted by him are Ibn Gabirol, [[Samuel ibn Naghrela]], and [[Abraham ibn Ezra]]. [[Isaac ben Samuel of Acre]] in his ''Me'irat 'Enayyim'' severely criticizes Gikatilla for too free usage of the Holy Name.

===''Sha'are Orah''===
'''''Sha'are Orah,''''' or '''''Sefer ha-Orah,''''' ({{Hebrew|שערי אורה}}) is Gikatilla's most influential work. [[Isaac Luria|The Arizal]] call it "a key to understanding the mystical studies".&lt;ref&gt;The Rishonim, Artscroll History Series, P. 98&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vilna Gaon]] and [[Zundel Salant]] recommended that their students study it. Among those who quote it are: [[Moshe Cordevero]], [[Joseph Caro]], [[Chaim Vital]], the [[Isaiah Horowitz|Shelah ha-Kadosh]], the [[Yehudah Aryeh Leib Alter|Sefat Emet]],&lt;ref&gt;Sha'are Orah, Yerucham Becker edition, Jerusalem 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shem Tov ibn Shem Tov]], [[Moses al-Ashkar]], and [[Judah Hayyat]], and long extracts from it are inserted by [[Reuben ben Hoshke]] in his ''Yalḳuṭ Reubeni.'' It was translated into Latin by [[Paul Ricius]] and used by [[Reuchlin]] as a defense against his adversaries.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contents and Style====
Sha'are Orah ([[Mantua]], 1561) deals with the names of God. 
* It discusses 300 names,&lt;ref&gt;According to the commentary of [[Mattithiah ben Solomon Delacrut]]&lt;/ref&gt; organized into ten chapters, one for each [[Sephirot|sephirah]]. Each sephirah has one main name, but may have many others. Some names are associated with more than one sphirah.
* The purpose of the book is "so that you can understand and experience the 'fountain of living waters' (Jer. 2,13) that flows from all his names, and when you attain this 'then you will prosper and have good success' ([[Joshua]] 1,8)".&lt;ref&gt;Gikatilla's Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

Gikatilla takes an attitude somewhat hostile to philosophy. He quotes only the ''[[Sefer Yeẓirah]]'' and the ''[[Pirḳe Hekalot]],''.

===Other works===
* '''''Sha'are Ẓedeḳ,''''' or '''''Sha'ar ha-Shamayim,''''' another treatise by Gikatilla on the ten spheres ([[Riva di Trento|Riva]], 1561).
* '''''Sefer ha-Niḳḳud,''''' a mystical explanation of the [[Niqqud|vowel-points]], included with the '''''Arze Lebanon''''' ([[Venice]], 1601);
* '''''Sod ha-Ḥashmal''''', a kabbalistic commentary on the vision of [[Ezekiel]], also printed with the ''Arze Lebanon'';
* '''''Ẓofnat Pa'aneaḥ,''''' commentary on the ''[[Haggadah of Pesach|Pesaḥ Haggadah]]'' (ib. 1600 [?]);
* '''''Sodot ha-Miẓwot,''''' a kabbalistic explanation of the [[Mitzvah|commandments]];
* '''''Iggeret,''''' kabbalistic essays (Feṙrara, 1556);
* '''''Teshubot,''''' ''[[responsa]]'';
* '''''Sha'ar Meshalim,''''' a kabbalistic essay in 138 paragraphs;
* '''''Oẓar ha-Kavod,''''' according to Jellinek, the same as the '''''Sodot ha-Miẓwot,''''' a commentary on [[Song of Solomon|Canticles]].
*'''''Hassagot''''' (unpublished) consists of strictures on the ''Moreh'', ([[Guide to the Perplexed]]) Gikatilla used [[Al-Ḥarizi]]'s translation, in which he corrects many mistakes and sometimes differs from [[Maimonides]]. It seems that he wrote the ''Hassagot'' in the beginning of his literary career, when he was more of a philosopher and less of a mystic.
* Jellinek thinks that Gikatilla composed a kabbalistic treatise entitled '''''Hekalot''''' of the same character as the ''Pirḳe Hekalot.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4168">'''Kanjo Nawa''' ({{lang-ja|勧請縄}}) is a Japanese custom of stretching [[Shimenawa]], a variety of laid rope, with [[Fetishism|fetishes]] hung at the border of a village. {{ill|Michi Kiri|ja|道切り}}(道切り) is just a similar custom. The term Kanjo Nawa also refers to the rope itself.

In rural area around Japan, there remains the custom of enshrining the items such as ropes of straw and grass, dolls, and straw sandals at the border of the village intended to prevent the evil such as an epidemic from entering the village, or to drive out the evil.&lt;ref name="KOTOBANK"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%8B%A7%E8%AB%8B%E7%B8%84-1295507 | title=勧請縄(かんじょうなわ)とは - コトバンク | publisher={{ill|kotobank|ja|コトバンク}} | accessdate=2017-08-11 | language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=印南敏秀|editors= 	植木行宣, 樋口昭|title=民俗文化分布圏論|date=1993-12-28|pages=375-376|isbn=4-626-01486-0| language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=高嶋賢二|title=村境の大草履―四国西南部の事例を中心に|publisher=the Society for MINGU of Japan (日本民具学会)|journal=民具研究 |volume=131|year=2005|pages=45-61| language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=小口千明|title=農村集落における精神的ムラ境の諸相 ―茨城県桜村における虫送りと道切りを事例として―|journal=城西人文研究|publisher=[[Josai University]]|volume=12|pages=37-51|url=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/els/contents110000187832.pdf?id=ART0000550707|date=1987-02-10| language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The custom called Kanjo Nawa can be found around [[Kinki Region]], especially in [[Wakasa, Fukui|Wakasa]], [[Fukui Prefecture]], in the east and south of [[Shiga Prefecture]], in [[Iga, Mie|Iga, Mie Prefecture]], in the east mountainous region of [[Nara Prefecture]], and in Minami-Yamashiro of [[Kyoto Prefecture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=民俗文化分布圏論|author=印南敏秀|date=1993-12-28|isbn=4-626-01486-0|editors=植木行宣, 樋口昭|pages=377| language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Examples ==
*Kanjo Nawa in Asukaji, [[Kasagi, Kyoto]]
*:In Asukaji, in every January, villagers create Shimenawa, which is stretched over Nunome-Gawa River, running through the village, in order to pray for prosperity and safety. One person per household is supposed to attend the event. Tsukurimono (ツクリモノ), imitating farming equipment, daily-life instrument or sexual organs, is hung on Shimenawa. It was recognized as [[Cultural Property (Japan)|Intangible Folk Cultural Properties]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=京都の文化財第16集 | url=http://www.kyoto-be.ne.jp/bunkazai/cms/?action=common_download_main&amp;upload_id=1280 | year=1999 | pages=33-34 | publisher=[[Kyoto Prefecture|Kyoto Prefectural]] Board of Education| language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.town.kasagi.lg.jp/contents_detail.php?frmId=452|title=Kanjo Nawa (Sacred Rope Protecting Local People From Evil Spirits)|publisher=[[Kasagi,_Kyoto|Kasagi Town]]|accessdate=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A complete list of known [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic churches]] in [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhichevan]] built since the adoption of [[Christianity]] in [[Armenia]] would include more than 280 churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://raa.am/Teghekagir/naxijevan_teghekanq_e.html Note on cultural history of Nakhichevan] on Research on Armenian Architecture&lt;/ref&gt;
Recent reports have alleged that probably all of the Armenian churches in Nakhchivan that were still standing in the decade before the collapse of the Soviet Union were destroyed by Azerbaijan in the aftermath of the Nagorno-Karabakh war. A 2006 report about a visit made to Nakhchivan in 2005 stated that of the five churches visited all were found to have been completely destroyed, in particular the 14th-century St. Karapet monastery in [[Əbrəqunus|Abrakunis]], and the 17th-century St. Hakop-Hayrapet church in [[Shurut]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Destruction of Julfa and the Entire Armenian Cultural Heritage in Nakhijevan'' Parliamentary Group Switzerland-Armenia (ed), Bern, 2006. Pages 6 &amp; 7. Quote from page 7, chapter titled "Memorandum submitted to UNESCO": "The destruction of Jugha is not a unique case in this remote province of Nakhijevan. ...what he discovered there convinced him that a deliberate state policy of destruction was carried out throughout all Nakhijevan".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Monumental Effort: Scotsman wants to prove Azeri policy of cultural destruction in Nakhijevan'', Gayane Mkrtchyan, ArmeniaNow, 2 September 2005. 
http://www.armenianow.com/features/5782/monumental_effort_scotsman_wants_t Quote: "But a special state policy of destruction is being implemented in Azerbaijan. In Turkey, after 90 years of staying empty, there are still standing churches today, meanwhile in Nakhijevan, all have been destroyed within just 10 years."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''L'Azerbaïdjan face au désastre culturel: L'Unesco reste impuissante face à la nouvelle campagne que mène le gouvernement azéri pour effacer toute trace de la culture arménienne sur son sol'' Sylvain Besson, Le Temps, 4 November 2006. [http://www.letemps.ch/Page/Uuid/8228e572-adc0-11dd-bf59-ad3d6140ad87/LAzerbaïdjan_face__au_désastre_culturel]&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan has repeatedly barred on-site investigation of the condition of Armenian monuments in the region by outside groups.&lt;ref&gt;http://shr.aaas.org/geotech/azerbaijan/azerbaijan.shtml ''High-Resolution Satellite Imagery and the Destruction of Cultural Artifacts in Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan''. [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]]. December 8, 2010. Quote: "Given that Azerbaijan has barred on-site investigation by outside groups, AAAS acquired and analyzed high-resolution satellite imagery to assess whether damage to the artifacts occurred."&lt;/ref&gt;

Armenians divided the region into 5 [[gavars]] (regions): [[Goghtn]], [[Alinja|Yernjak]], [[Nakhchivan City|Nakhichevan]], [[Şahbuz|Chahuk-Shahaponq]] and [[Sharur]].

===Goghtn region===
Number of known Armenian churches in Goghtn was 94.

The '''Mahakali Caves''', also '''Kondivite Caves''', are a group of 19 rock-cut monuments built between 1st century BCE and 6th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Ancient-caves-battle-neglect/articleshow/4770451.cms|title=Ancient caves battle neglect|last=Jaisinghani|first=Bella|date=13 July 2009|newspaper=[[Times of India]]|accessdate=2009-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This Buddhist monastery is located in the eastern suburb of [[Andheri]] in the city of [[Mumbai]] (Bombay) in western [[India]]. Monument consists of two groups of rock-cut caves - 4 caves more to the north-west and 15 caves more to the south-east. Most caves are [[vihara]]s and cells for monks, but Cave 9 of south-eastern group is [[chaitya]]. Caves in north-west have been created mainly in 4th - 5th century, while south-eastern group is older. Monument contains also rock-cut cisterns and remnants of other structures.

Caves are carved out of a solid black [[basalt]] rock,(volcanic trap breccias, prone to weathering).

The largest cave at Kondivite (Cave 9) has seven depictions of the Buddha and figures from Buddhist mythology but all are mutilated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fline/fl2615/stories/20090731261506600.htm|title=In a shambles|last=Bavadam|first=Lyla|date=18–31 July 2009|publisher=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]|accessdate=2009-10-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130125062548/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fline/fl2615/stories/20090731261506600.htm|archivedate=2013-01-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is located near the junction between the [[Jogeshwari-Vikhroli Link Road]] and [[SEEPZ]]. The road that connects these monuments to [[Andheri Kurla Road]] is named Mahakali Caves Road after it. The caves are located on a hill that overlooks the Jogeshwari-Vikhroli Link Road and the SEEPZ++ area.&lt;ref name="paydirt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040125/spectrum/travel.htm|title=Pay dirt: Treasure amidst Mumbai’s trash|last=Gaur|first=Abhilash|date=2004-01-25|work=The Tribune|accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Direct bus run by the [[Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport|BEST]] links the caves with [[Andheri]] station. The caves was in danger of being encroached upon, now it is steel fenced on the  road side and walled on the hill side.{{clarify|date=October 2017}}

A {{nihongo||神輿|'''''mikoshi'''''|lead=y}} is a divine [[palanquin]] (also translated as portable [[Shinto shrine]]). Shinto followers believe that it serves as the vehicle to transport a deity in [[Japan]] while moving between main shrine and temporary shrine during a festival or when moving to a new shrine. Often, the ''mikoshi'' resembles a miniature building, with pillars, walls, a roof, a [[veranda]] and a railing.

Often the [[Japanese honorific]] prefix {{nihongo4||お|''o-''}} is added, making {{nihongo4||お神輿|'''''omikoshi'''''}}.

== Shapes ==
[[File:JakJapanMatsuriMikoshi 2018.jpg|thumb|A ''mikoshi'' in Jak Japan Matsuri 2018]]
Typical shapes are rectangles, hexagons, and octagons. The body, which stands on two or four poles (for carrying), is usually lavishly decorated, and the roof might hold a carving of a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]].

== Festival and flow ==
During a ''[[matsuri]]'' (Japanese festival) involving a ''mikoshi'', people bear the ''mikoshi'' on their shoulders by means of two, four (or sometimes, rarely, six) poles. They bring the ''mikoshi'' from the shrine, carry it around the neighborhoods that worship at the shrine, and in many cases leave it in a designated area, resting on blocks called ''uma'' (horse), for a time before returning it to the shrine. Some shrines have the custom of dipping the ''mikoshi'' in the water of a nearby lake, river or ocean (this practice is called ''o-hamaori''). At some festivals, the people who bear the ''mikoshi'' wave it wildly from side to side to "amuse" the deity ([[kami]]) inside.

== Methods of shouldering ==
The most common method of shouldering in Japan is {{nihongo|''hira-katsugi''|平担ぎ|extra2="flat carry"}}.  Bearers chant {{nihongo|''wasshoi''|わっしょい}} and may or may not toss and shake the mikoshi.

Other methods include:

[[File:Mikoshi-localshrine-2011.ogv|thumb|(video) A local shrine being carried in Japan. As it is being carried the participants chant.]]

* {{nihongo|''Edomae''|江戸前|extra2="[[Edo]] style"}} is one famous way of shouldering observable at the [[Sanja Matsuri|Asakusa Sanja Festival]]. The shout is "say ya, soi ya, sah, sorya... etc". The mikoshi is swayed rapidly, up and down and a little to the right and left.
* "Dokkoi | ドッコイ " is seen in [[Shonan]] in [[Kanagawa]] Prefecture. This shouldering style usually uses two poles. The mikoshi is moved up and down rhythmically, and more slowly than in the "Edomae style". One shout is "dokkoi dokkoi dokkoi sorya" and there is a song called a "Jink | lively song."
* Another one is "Odawara style | 小田原担ぎ " observed in [[Odawara]] (next to the [[Hakone]]). This is a peculiar way of shouldering in which multiple mikoshis meet and run (Holy Dash). The shout is "oisah;korasah/koryasah." and there is a song called a "Kiyari", a chant traditionally sung by workmen while pulling a heavy load and also by firemen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://n-tobi.or.jp/english/tobi-firefighter-traditions/kiyari/ |title=Kiyari }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The bearers do not sway the mikoshi.
* In this "united" style, the mikoshi uses the full width of the road, moving from side to side and turning corners at full speed.

'''Modesta Lavana Pérez''' (February 24, 1929 &amp;ndash; December 13, 2010) was an indigenous [[Nahua people|Nahua]] healer and activist from the town of [[Hueyapan]], [[Morelos]], Mexico. She was recognized as an important activist for indigenous rights and women's rights in Morelos, where she worked as a healer and as a legal translator of the [[Nahuatl]] language for the state of Morelos.&lt;ref&gt;Adalberto Ríos Szalay. 1997.

As a child, as was common in that period, she was punished for speaking her native Nahuatl language in school,&lt;ref&gt;Yolanda Chávez Leyva. "In ixtli in yóllotl/ a face and a heart: Listening to the Ancestors", ''[[Studies in American Indian Literatures]]'', Series 2, Vol. 15, No. 3/4 (Fall 2003/Winter 2004), pp. 96-127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festivalmedicinatradicional.org/homenaje.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130825165637/http://www.festivalmedicinatradicional.org/homenaje.html |archivedate=2013-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but she kept speaking it and eventually became a translator helping other speakers access their rights in the legal system of the state of Morelos.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13650">[[Modern paganism|Neopaganism]] (''{{lang|de|Neuheidentum}}'') in  [[German-speaking Europe]] has since its emergence in the 1970s diversified into a wide array of traditions, particularly during the [[New Age]] boom of the 1980s.

Schmid (2006) distinguishes four main currents:
* [[Celtic Neopaganism]]/[[Neo-Druidism]]
* [[Germanic neopaganism]]/Ásatrú
* [[Wicca]]
* [[Neoshamanism]]

R. Gründer{{who|date=May 2016}} in Junker (2007) analyzing the role of Neopagan groups in Germany concludes that German Neopaganism has been used as a projection-screen for the attribution of [[Anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]], [[antisemitism|antisemitic]], and [[right extremist]] ideologies mainly by churches and the media.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

==History==

===Early forms===
Neopaganism in Germany and Austria has been strongly influenced by the [[occultism|occultist]] [[Germanic mysticism]] pioneered by [[Guido von List]] and [[Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels]] in the 1890 to 1930 period.
A [[Guido von List Society]] was founded 1908. Other early groups influenced by List were the  ''[[Deutschgläubige Gemeinschaft]]'' (1911), the ''[[Germanenorden]]'' (1912) and the ''[[Germanische Glaubens-Gemeinschaft]]'' (1907).

The contemporary term ''Deutschgläubig'' for these movements may be translated as either "German Faith", "[[Teutons|Teutonic]] Faith" or in the more archaic usage of ''[[theodiscus|Deutsch]]'' as "[[folk belief]]". Several of these groups came together in 1933 forming an ''Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Deutschen Glaubensbewegung''. There was however no unified take on the contents of a ''Deutschgläubig'' religiosity, and approaches varied from a "national Christianity" based on the [[Arianism]] of the Goths, [[German mysticism]], Humanism and [[freethought|free thought]], as well as racialist ideas of a native [[Nordic race|Nordic]] or [[Aryan race|Aryan]] religion. The radical free-thinking tendency combined with the Nordicist one to the effect of pronounced hostility towards Christianity and the Church. Krause et al. (1977:557) distinguish four basic types subsumed under ''Deutschgläubig'':
#the ''Deutscher Glaube'' of [[Jakob Wilhelm Hauer]], inspired by influences of Hinduism and mysticism combined with elements of [[Neoplatonism]], Humanism, Renaissance and the [[German classics]]
#"Nordic" religion embraced as the native religion of the [[Nordic race]], rejecting Christianity on grounds of being a foreign ("Semitic") intrusion. This branch is the closest to later "[[Neo-völkisch|folkish]]" [[Germanic neopaganism]], postulating that a people's native religion is based on a  "racial soul" (''Rassenseele''), comparable to current ideas of [[Metagenetics]] in "folkish" neopaganism. [[Ludwig Fahrenkrog]] and his ''[[Germanische Glaubens-Gemeinschaft]]'' represent a specifically Germanic approach within the "Nordic" group.
#The political approach as represented by [[Alfred Rosenberg]] which rejects religiosity in favour of pure ''[[völkisch]]'' political ideology.
#[[Mathilde Ludendorff]]'s "ethnocentric soteriology" as taken up by the ''[[Tannenbergbund]]'' (1925)

===Third Reich and aftermath===
{{Main|Nazism and occultism}}
{{seealso|German Faith Movement}}
The ''[[Thule Society]]'' originated as an offshoot of the ''Germanenorden'' in 1917, and notoriously became associated with the [[Deutsche Arbeiterpartei]] in 1919 and thus involved in the formative phase of the [[Nazi Party]]. By the rise of the [[Third Reich]] in 1933, the Thule society had been dissolved, and   esoteric organisations (including völkisch occultists) were suppressed by the Nazi regime, many closed down by anti-Masonic legislation in 1935. Nevertheless, some elements of Germanic mysticism found reflection in the symbolism employed by the Nazis, mostly due to [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s interest in the occult and sponsorship of the Austrian [[Ariosophist]] [[Karl Wiligut]]. As early as 1940, the occult scholar and folklorist [[Lewis Spence]] identified a [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] undercurrent in Nazism,&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Lewis, Occult Causes of the Present War, 1940: p85.&lt;/ref&gt; for which he largely blamed [[Alfred Rosenberg]], and which he equated with "[[Theistic Satanism|satanism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Spence 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; This notion of a [[Nazi occultism]] has been relativized as superficial. [[Heinz Höhne]], an authority on the [[SS]], observes that  "Himmler's neo-pagan customs remained primarily a paper exercise".&lt;ref&gt;Höhne 1969: 138, 143&amp;ndash;5, 156&amp;ndash;57.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hamburg]] which was considered a stronghold, only 0.49% of the inhabitants identified as belonging to the neopagan faith movement (in 1937).&lt;ref&gt;Theologische Realenzyklopädie, Volume 8. Page 556. [[Walter de Gruyter|Gruyter Verlag]], 1993. {{ISBN|978-3-11-013898-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the fall of the Third Reich, the ''Deutschgläubig'' movement was finished, appearing suspect at least during the period of [[denazification]] (Krause 1977:558). But völkisch religiosity began to re-surface as early as 1951 with the ''[[Artgemeinschaft]]'' and the ''[[Deutsche Unitarier]]''.

===1970s to 1980s===
Neopaganism saw a revival in the 1970s, partly by [[Neopaganism in the USA|US]] influence,&lt;ref&gt;Hunt (2003:147-148) writes: "Although as a contemporary movement neo-Paganism can be traced back to the nineteenth-century, it was the counter-culture of the mid-twentieth-century which increased its popularity in the USA where a rediscovery of the ancient cultural traditions of the Native American Indians became popular."&lt;/ref&gt; partly by the revival of pre-war occultist societies. The ''Armanenorden'' was re-established in 1976.

The ''Heidnische Gemeinschaft'' (HG; "Heathen Community") was founded in 1985 by [[Géza von Neményi]], formerly of the Armanenorder, and in contrast to that movement explicitly distances itself from extreme-right ideas. Members are urged to forgo racial and fascist ideals, to have a positive and respectful attitude towards the earth and nature, to participate in democracy instead of aiming for totalitarianism, to promote equality of the sexes, and to worship the gods whose existence underlies cultural tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmid|first1=Georg|last2=Eggenberger|first2=Oswald|title=Die Kirchen, Sondergruppen und religiösen Vereinigungen: ein Handbuch|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mJozaihMXl0C&amp;pg=PA429|accessdate=1 February 2012|year=2001|publisher=Theologischer Verlag Zürich|isbn=978-3-290-17215-2|page=429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980s were dominated by the [[New Age]] movement, giving rise to a significant neopagan movement detached in origin from the ''völkisch'' or ''deutschgläubig'' history of German neopaganism. [[Wicca]] and the [[Goddess movement]] begins to take hold in [[German feminist]] subculture in this period,&lt;ref&gt;Gisela Graichen, ''Die neuen Hexen: Gespräche mit Hexen'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;
e.g. with [[Heide Göttner-Abendroth]], whose "International Academy for Modern Matriarchal Studies and Matriarchal Spirituality" (HAGIA) was founded in 1986. 
The German [[Wicca]] movement is dominated by the US [[feminist]] currents of [[Dianic Wicca]] and the ''[[Reclaiming (neopaganism)|Reclaiming]]'' community advocating radical [[environmentalism]] (REMID).

===1990s to present===

====Germanic neopaganism in Germany====
A renewed interest in Germanic neopaganism or [[Asatru]] in particular becomes apparent in the later 1990s,  based on inspiration from the English-speaking world rather than historical ''deutschgläubig'' groups, with the foundation of the ''Rabenclan'' (1994) and of a German chapter of [[Odinic Rite]] in 1995, followed by ''Nornirs Ætt'' in 1997 and the [[Eldaring]] as a chapter of the US [[The Troth]] in 2000.

Fahrenkrog's ''Germanische Glaubens-Gemeinschaft'' was reactivated in 1991 by Géza von Neményi, who had received the organization's archives from Dessel as the result of a hostile split of the ''[[Heidnische Gemeinschaft]]'', which von Neményi had founded in 1985.
Von Neményi had been a member of the board of the [[Green Party (Germany)|Green Party]] in Berlin until 1985, when he was expelled together with his brother for alleged connections to the neo-Nazi milieu, an accusation which both men denied.&lt;ref&gt;[[Der Spiegel]], [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13510856.html?name=Mythos+der+Edda Mythos der Edda] January 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the GGG successfully sued the ''[[Artgemeinschaft]]'', which also claimed to be the legal successor of Fahrenkrog's organization.

However, in 1995 the GGG denied being a continuation of Fahrenkrog's organization. In 1997, the GGG again claimed to have been founded in 1907. Since the foundation/reactivation of GGG, von Neményi has claimed the title of ''[[Allsherjargoði|Allsherjargode]]'' (an Icelandic title translating approximately to "high priest") and position of a spiritual leader, a claim rejected and mocked by most other neopagan groups in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekd.de/ezw/42714_berichte_streit_um_heiden_papst.php Streit um "Heiden-Papst"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210185616/http://www.ekd.de/ezw/42714_berichte_streit_um_heiden_papst.php |date=2009-02-10 }},  Evangelische Zentralstelle für Weltanschauungsfragen (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Germanic neopaganism in Germany in particular, debate on [[Neo-völkisch movements|neopaganism and neo-Nazism]] is very prominent and controversial. The large majority of German neopagans vehemently renounce all right extremist associations, especially since a 1996 case of a [[Sauerland]] neo-Nazi who had confessed to four murders which he claimed were inspired by the command of [[Odin]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lemke, convicted to a life sentence by an [[Essen]] court in 1997. [http://mainz-online.de/old/97/03/19/topnews/lemke.html Mainz-online.de]&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy is kept alive because there remain a number of neo-Nazi or far-right neopagan groups, with [[Jürgen Rieger]]'s ''Artgemeinschaft'' (Rieger died 2009) notoriously [[domain squatting]] asatru.de since 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://asatru.de Archive.org link]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Rabenclan'' and ''Nornirs Ætt'' groups were particularly prominent in this respect in the 1990s, with their [[anti-racist]]  "Ariosophy project" actively denouncing right extremists within the German neopagan movement. Other groups, like the ''[[Germanische Glaubens-Gemeinschaft]]'' do not take a clear position with regard to [[neo-völkisch]] or [[Nouvelle Droite|New Right]] schools of thoughts. The [[Eldaring]] avoids taking any political stance and rejects the "folkish" vs. "universalist" division as inapplicable.

The ''Verein für germanisches Heidentum'' (VfGH), formerly "Odinic Rite Deutschland" has been associated with the folkish [[Odinic Rite]] in Britain from 1995, but later severed organisational ties and was renamed to its present name in 2006. The "folkish" concept of [[Metagenetics]] advocated in US Asatru by [[Stephen McNallen]] was introduced into German discourse by Volker "Stilkam" Wagner of Odinic Rite Deutschland, a position harshly attacked by the Rabenclan as [[völkisch]] or [[Nouvelle Droite|New Right]] ideology. Some fringe groups like the ''[[Artgemeinschaft]]'' and the ''[[Deutsche Heidnische Front]]'' are essentially neo-Nazi groups clad in pagan terminology. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

====Austria and Switzerland====
Celtic neopaganism and neo-Druidism is particularly popular in [[Austria]], by virtue of Austria being the location of the Proto-Celtic [[Hallstatt culture]]. The ''Keltendorf'' in [[Diex]], [[Kärnten]] combines archaeological reconstruction with "European [[geomancy]]".  The ''Europäisch Keltische Gemeinschaft'' has been active since 1998.

The [[Pagan Federation]] has chapters in Austria and Germany. There is no organized neopagan group in Switzerland, the [[Eldaring]] catering also to Swiss and Austrian members. A loose network centered around interest in [[Alpine paganism]] has been active in Switzerland under the name Firner Situ (the Old High German translation of ''Forn Sed'') since 2006.

[[File:QUEMUENCHATOCHA.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Quemuenchatocha]], ''zaque'' of Hunza&lt;br&gt;who allegedly kidnapped Pacanchique's fiancé]]

'''Pacanchique''' was a person in the [[Muisca mythology|mythology]] of the [[Muisca people|Muisca]]. He is said to have been the son of the  ''[[cacique]]'' of [[Ramiriquí]]; [[Baganique]]. During that time, Ramiriquí was part of the ''[[zaque|zacazgo]]'' of [[Quemuenchatocha]] of the northern [[Muisca Confederation]]. Pacanchique's fiancé, Azay, is said to have been kidnapped by Quemuenchatocha and Pacanchique did all to get her back, eventually leading the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]es to [[Tunja|Hunza]] to beat Quemuenchatocha.&lt;ref name=p103&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.19, p.103&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In the centuries before the arrival of the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s, the central highlands ([[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]]) of present-day [[Colombia]] were ruled by ''[[zaque]]s'' (northern [[Muisca Confederation]]) and ''[[zipa]]s'' (southern territories). Other areas were ruled by ''caciques'', one of which was the ruler of Ramiriquí.

== Mythography ==
Pacanchique, who lived in the times of the rule of ''zaque'' [[Quemuenchatocha]], had a beautiful fiancé, Azay. Quemuenchatocha organised pilgrimages to the [[Goranchacha Temple|Temple of the Sun]], built by [[Goranchacha]]. At the temple [[human sacrifice]]s were performed; young boys of twelve years old were offered to worshop [[Sué]], the god of the Sun of the Muisca. These rituals took place at the [[Cojines del Zaque]] ("Cushions of the Zaque"), two round stones of equal rock type, and were accompanied by [[Muisca music|music]] and [[Muisca music#Dance|dances]] with flutes, [[ocarina]]s and drums.&lt;ref name=p103/&gt;

At one of the celebrations, the delegation of Ramiriquí composed of the ''cacique'' Baganchique, his son Pacanchique and his fiancé Azay, together with other leaders of the area around Ramiriquí, came from [[Soracá]] to the temple to worship the Sun. The celebrations started at dawn; when Sué was rising in the east. ''Zaque'' Quemuenchatocha kneeled down on the Cojines to start the ritual. The hearts of the young boys were pulled out and sacrificed to the Sun, while Quemuenchatocha drank their blood. The ''zaque'' saw the beautiful Azay and ordered his servants to bring her to his palace (''gran bohío'') that night. The choice for Azay was considered a great honour according to the Muisca traditions and was arranged by the gods and Azay was captured that same night.&lt;ref name=p104&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.19, p.104&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pacanchique's artifices ===
Desperate for the loss of his lover, Pacanchique needed an artifice to get Azay back. After consulting his father, he went to the [[swamp]]s of Soracá where the Muisca cultivated their medicinal and psychoactive plants. He took two types of plants from here and went to the palace of Quemuenchatocha where he found Azay crying for help. He gave her one of the plants and she immediately fell asleep. When Quemuenchatocha entered and found his conquered beauty dead, he and his shamans tried to save her life, but their attempts were unsuccessful. With a sad funeral march, Quemuenchatocha brought back the body of Azay to Baganique in Ramiriquí. There Pacanchique gave her the other plant he picked from the swamps and Azay came back to life.&lt;ref name=p104/&gt;

When Quemuenchatocha found out his conquered lady was not dead, he sent his [[guecha warrior]]s to Ramiriquí to find her and punish the culprits of the plot. Pacanchique fled the village but Azay and Baganique were captured by the soldiers and taken to Hunza. The protests of former friend Baganchique and his people were in vain; the ''zaque'' ordered Azay and Baganique to be hung at the [[gallows]] on "Gallow Hill". Shortly after the conquistadores led by [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] reached the Muisca territories and found the hanging bodies. Pacanchique wanted revenge on the deaths of his father and fiancé and led the small army of De Quesada to the domains of Quemuenchatocha where he was found sitting in on his throne with [[gold]], [[emerald]]s and expensive cloths. Pacanchique also showed the Spanish troops the way to the [[Temple of the Sun (Sogamoso)|Temple of the Sun]] in sacred city [[Sogamoso|Sugamuxi]]. Pacanchique died close to Bonza by the sword of one of the Spanish soldiers.&lt;ref name=p106&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.19, p.106&lt;/ref&gt;

Other [[chronicler]]s call Azay "Nagantá".&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://eutimioreyesmanosalva.jimdo.com/libros-e-r-m/leyendas-mitos-espantos-y-romer%C3%ADas-de-tunja/ Nagantá or Azay, the story of Pacanchique] - accessed 02-05-2016&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13859">'''Robert Cummings Neville''' (born May 1, 1939 in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], U.S.) is an American systematic philosopher and theologian, author of numerous books and papers, and ex-Dean of the [[Boston University School of Theology]]. J. Harley Chapman and [[Nancy Frankenberry]], editors of a festchrift—a collection of critical essays written in Neville's honor—entitled ''Interpreting Neville'', consider him to be "one of the most significant philosophers and theologians of our time".&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, J. H. &amp; Frankenberry, N. (eds). (1999). Interpreting Neville: Albany: State University of New York Press. vii&lt;/ref&gt;  Neville was Dean of Humanities and Fine Arts at the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]], and has taught at Yale, [[Fordham University|Fordham]], and the [[State University of New York Purchase]].  He is now a professor at [[Boston University]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.robertcummingsneville.com&lt;/ref&gt;  He was granted a Doctorate ''honoris causa'' by the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Far Eastern Studies in 1996.

==Philosophical and theological work==

===Theory of being===
Neville's most significant scholarly contribution is arguably his metaphysical theory of being (or being-itself): a new theory that involves an original solution to the ancient problem of the one and the many.  He developed this theory for his PhD dissertation at [[Yale University]] (graduated 1963), of which his first book, ''God the Creator'', constitutes a substantial revision.  Exploring the implications of that theory has enabled him to produce a philosophy of nature that rivals Alfred North Whitehead's in scope and power, as can be seen from his three-volume ''Axiology of Thinking''. The first volume in that trilogy, ''Reconstruction of Thinking'' (1981), was hailed by Donald W. Sherburne—editor of the corrected edition of Whitehead's ''Process and Reality''—as "a truly important book.  It is the first genuinely neo-Whiteheadian offering on a large, systematic scale."&lt;ref&gt;Publisher's blurb on the dust jacket of Neville's ''Reconstruction of Thinking''&lt;/ref&gt; The second volume of the trilogy, ''Recovery of the Measure: Interpretation and Nature'' (1989), was also well received.  The prominent Confucian scholar and philosopher David L. Hall wrote of it as follows: "Because of its timeliness, the brilliance of its arguments, and the profundity of its conclusions, there is good reason to believe that this work will shortly become the focus of genuine and widespread discussion.  With the publication of this latest installment of his ''Axiology of Thinking'', Neville emerges as one of the strongest voices in American philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;Publisher's blurb on back cover of Neville's ''Recovery of the Measure''&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity, systematic breadth, and analytic depth of Neville's thought is most evident in this second volume of his trilogy.

===Comparative theology===
Neville is also well known as a religious studies scholar, especially for his [[comparative theology]].  He has authored several books in the field of comparative religion: ''The Tao and the Daimon'' (1981), ''Behind the Masks of God'' (1991), ''Boston Confucianism'' (2000), ''Ritual and Deference'' (2008), and ''Realism in Religion'' (2009).  In addition, Neville is the editor of three volumes that resulted from a "Comparative Religious Ideas Project" funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Henry Luce Foundation, and Boston University: ''Religious Truth'', ''Ultimate Realities'', and ''The Human Condition'', (all 2001).  The latter three texts present a theory of comparison that uses C. S. Peirce's notion of "vagueness"&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, Charles S. 1905. “Issues of Pragmaticism” ''in'' The Peirce Edition Project (ed.), ''The Essential Peirce: Selected Philosophical Writings, Volume 2, 1893–1913.&lt;/ref&gt; to develop what Neville calls vague categories of comparison.  (A vague category is any category of thought that is left open to mutually incompatible specifications so as to allow for interpretations that might conflict with each other.  For example, ''all swans are black'' specifies the vague proposition ''all swans are colored'' in a manner that contradicts ''all swans are white''.)  Neville argues that the judicious use of such categories enables comparisons to be made in such a way that respects the integrity and diversity of religious traditions.

===Doctrine of creation===
Neville's comparative work in religion and his systematic philosophy come together in numerous works of theology that attempt to interpret the Christian tradition in a manner that not only respects but even accommodates non-Christian voices. He is encouraged in this attempt by an interpretation of the doctrine of creation ''ex nihilo'' that he developed in his first book, ''God the Creator'' (1968).  In that book, Neville argues that to be is to be determinate, that to be determinate is to contrast with other determinations in a context of mutual relevance, and that the ultimate context of mutual relevance—that which grounds the many determinations of being—is pure indeterminacy.  But if all things are what they are by virtue of their contrast with indeterminacy, then they come to be out of nothing: they are created ''ex nihilo.''  According to the prominent Whiteheadian philosopher Lewis Ford, Neville's is one of the "two most distinctive theories of creation in the twentieth century, both in terms of what it means to bring actualities into being, and in terms of funding the relationship between God and the world in its widest perspective." (The other theory Ford has in mind is Alfred North Whitehead's.)&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Lewis S. 1999. Creation and Concresence ''in'' J. Harley Chapman and Nancy K. Frankenberry (eds.) ''Interpreting Neville'', Albany, NY: SUNY Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Though creation ''ex nihilo'' is typically associated with personalist varieties of theism, Neville's Creator is the purely indeterminate ground of beings.  For this reason, he is encouraged to explore the possibility of Buddhist, Taoist, and Confucian parallels in such texts as ''The Tao and the Daimon'' (1982), and ''Behind the Masks of God'' (1991).  He is currently (April 2011) writing a trilogy of theological texts, the first installment of which was published in 2006 under the title, ''On the Scope and Truth of Theology: Theology as Symbolic Engagement''.  Neville's theology is critically engaged by numerous authors in a festschrift entitled, ''Theology in Global Context: Essays in Honor of Robert Cummings Neville'' (2004), edited by [[Amos Yong]] and Peter Heltzela.&lt;ref&gt;Yong, Amos and Peter G. Heltzela 2004. ''Theology in Global Context: Essays in Honor of Robert Cummings Neville''. New York, NY: T &amp; T Clark. World Wide Web address: https://books.google.com/books?id=FPnTbY7lx-4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ROBERT+CUMMINGS+NEVILLE&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wU6WYYXQNw&amp;sig=tzzH13cXIOe_J2AxfFRvMHmFO84&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hS-cTcOTGpCcOsGGuI8I&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proponent of Confucianism===
Robert Neville is a proponent of [[Confucianism]] as a world philosophy.  Together with several scholars from the Boston area of the United States—especially including Tu Weiming of Harvard University—Neville encourages the development of what has come to be called "[[Boston Confucianism]]."  As its name suggests, Boston Confucianism is a "non-East Asian" expression of the Confucian tradition.  Neville has produced several books devoted to Confucian themes, including one that argues at length for the legitimacy and exhibits the vitality and importance of Boston Confucianism: ''Boston Confucianism: Portable Tradition in the Late-Modern World'' (2000).  His contributions to Chinese philosophy have resulted in his being given an honorary Chinese name: NAN Lo Shana.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, Robert. “Chinese Philosophy in Britain and America,” in Chinese, published under my Chinese name, NAN Lo Shan, in The Map of Contemporary British and American Philosophy, edited by KANG Ouyang, pp. 83–126. Beijing: Dangdai Yingmei Zhexue Ditu, 2005 (appearing in 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic and ecclesiastical positions==
Neville is a past president of the American Academy of Religion, of the International Society for Chinese Philosophy, of the [[Metaphysical Society of America]], of the Association of United Methodist Theological Schools, and of the Trustees of the Boston Theological Institute.  He is a former member of the Accrediting Commission of the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada and of the Commission on Theological Education of the United Methodist Church.  Neville is currently a member of the editorial boards of ''Soundings'' and ''The [[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'', and is the Associate Editor for Behavioral and Neurological Articles for ''The Encyclopedia of Bioethics''. He was formerly on the editorial board of the ''Quarterly Review''.  An ordained elder in the Missouri East Conference of the United Methodist Church, Neville has pastored in Missouri and New York, and was Boston University chaplain from 2005 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bu.edu/religion/faculty/bios/neville/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He is married to Beth Neville, with whom he has three children and several grandchildren.  An accomplished artist (emphasizing oil and watercolor paintings, pen and ink illustrations), Beth creates much of the artwork for Robert Neville's books.  Several color plates of her work appear in his "Symbols of Jesus".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nevilleart.com/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sadhabhisekam''' is one of the religious [[Ceremony|ceremonies]] done in [[Hinduism]].  It is one of the formal ceremonies (and can be called a duty to all children) done by the children to their parents, when the father reaches the age of 80.

The same preparation done for every [[marriage]] will be done for this also, like invitation preparation, food arrangements, booking of hall for guests.

'''Santa María de Melque''' is a church in the border municipality of San Martín de Montalbán in the province of [[Toledo (province)|Toledo]] (in [[Spain]]), 30&amp;nbsp;km south of the capital, and equidistant from the towns of [[La Puebla de Montalbán]] and Gálvez, between the brook Ripas and the river Torcón, a tributary of the river [[Tagus]].

Of the entire complex, recently restored, the church stands out, exemplary [[Mozarabic art|Mozarabic]]-[[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigothic]], as the most important religious monument of the [[Early Middle Ages]] in Spain.

Currently, the church, which occupies the center of the complex, and the center of interpretation which has been installed in the adjoining rooms, also restored, can be visited. The scenery that is observed from '''Santa María''' is also characteristic of the area.

==History==
[[File:Santa María de Melque (Toledo) 01.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Inside of the church.]]

'''Santa María de Melque''' came into being as a monastic collection in the 7th and 8th centuries inside of what was the capital of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. Construction commenced in the 7th century, coinciding with the end of the Visigothic kingdom, and probably came to a halt with the arrival of the Arabs, to be continued later.

There was originally a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] settlement on that location, with five dams across the two brooks that surround the small, rocky hill. Next the monastery was built with the buildings organized around the church.

The Muslim conquest of the Iberian peninsula did not immediately end with this monastic nucleus, because there are testimonies of the survival of a Mozarabic community that later disappeared. Its constructions were used as urban nucleus and its church was fortified with the construction of a tower on the dome of the church, tower that is still preserved. Water from rain and from the gullys was detained by means of dams placed both sides of the complex.

With the conquest of Toledo by King [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile]] in 1085, the temple recovered its liturgical function without losing its military function. The anthropomorphic tombs located to the east and the remains of barbicans that remain are testimonies of this historic period.

==Architecture==
[[File:Planta SMdM.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Plan of the church.]]

It was constructed in 8th century and it's the first one-half monument better preserved of the Spanish [[High Middle Ages]]. Its constructive technique is the architecture's direct inheritance late roman.
However, the lack of decorative elements preserved (filigrees of stucco in the transverse arches of the crossing) that still can be seen in the background of the southern arm of the crossing suggests that Melque could be at first a mausoleum, destined to burial of a distinguished personage from Toledo's [[Visigothic Kingdom]]. The church was later redesigned on at least two occasions.

The [[Knights Templar]] turned the church into defensive tower, like a ''turris'' as the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used to. This tower over the dome base has been recently dismounted. It had a porch with three openings which no longer exists.

The plant is cruciform, with a central apse: the two lateral apses were added later. It keeps in good condition its different naves, some side chapels and a parlor with very pronounced horseshoe arches. And a niche probably for the founder of the temple.

The presbytery is large correspondingly to a monastic community with Round arches at both sides. Also is preserved a moorish tower over the vault.

It was made with enormous unmortared blocks which look like the [[Aqueduct of Segovia]]. The molduration is calculated in [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|Roman cubits]], similar to the [[San Pedro of Arisgotas]] molduration, also in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].

This church has contributions of clearly Visigothic style with new solutions that the mozarabs contribute, and besides memories of the Roman style:
* '''Visigothic contributions''': the horseshoe arch that supports the apse's vault, surpassing 1/3 of the radium. The set unprovided of remains sculptured, of Visigothic tradition. The [[arcosolium]].
* '''Mozarabic contributions''': central horseshoe arches of surpassing 1/2 of the radium. Arches of the windows in 2/3. Strange semicircular pilasters of the inside that neither may be considered semi-detached.
* '''Innovations''': the circular reduction of the corners in its 4 facades and the vertical crack at both sides, having the appearance of pseudo columns. It looks like the columns placed at the corners of the lantern towers of Romanesque Norman style. It's an unprecedented solution.
* '''Roman style''': The enormous granite blocks, the molduration in [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|Roman cubits]], its plant is comparable to [[Mausoleum of Galla Placidia]] in [[Ravenna]] ([[Italy]]).

'''Saul Yaffie''', {{aka}} '''Paul Jeffay''', (1898–1957) was a Scottish Jewish artist.

== Early life ==
Saul Yaffie was born in Blythswood, [[Glasgow]] on 29 April 1898. His mother was Kate Yaffie (née Karkinofski), and his father, Bernard Yaffie, was a master tailor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yaffie, Saul|url=http://www.gsaarchives.net/archon/index.php?p=core/search&amp;subjectid=677|website=Archives and Collections: Glasgow School of Art|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many Russian Jews, Kate and Bernard Yaffie fled persecution in Russia during a wave of anti-Jewish pogroms triggered by the assassination of [[Tsar Alexander II]] in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jewish community in Scotland|url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/higherscottishhistory/migrationandempire/experienceofimmigrants/jewish.asp|website=Education Scotland|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saul's father was naturalised as a British citizen by the time that Saul himself was three; a Bernard Yaffie is recorded as living at Abbortsford Place in the old [[Gorbals]], where the young Saul spent the early years of his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Census|url=http://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/|website=Scotland's People|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yaffies were not unique in their situation: the Gorbals was the centre of Scotland's Jewish community and home to a large proportion of Glasgow's immigrants throughout the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jewish community in Scotland|url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/higherscottishhistory/migrationandempire/experienceofimmigrants/jewish.asp|website=Education Scotland|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, there was a movement to some of the more affluent communities in Glasgow, such as [[Pollokshields]] and [[Garnethill]], as many Jewish families gradually improved their social and economic situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jewish community in Scotland|url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/higherscottishhistory/migrationandempire/experienceofimmigrants/jewish.asp|website=Education Scotland|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like these, the Yaffies also experienced a time of good fortune, moving to a more agreeable address on Sinclair Drive, [[Cathcart]] as Bernard's tailoring business prospered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Census|url=http://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/|website=Scotland's People|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and military service ==
Saul attended day classes in drawing and painting, modelling, and life drawing at [[Glasgow School of Art|The Glasgow School of Art]] from 1912 to 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yaffie, Saul|url=http://www.gsaarchives.net/archon/index.php?p=core/search&amp;subjectid=677|website=Archives and Collections: Glasgow School of Art|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[World War I|First World War]], he was required to interrupt his studies to serve in the King's Own Scottish Borderers in 1916/17. Although subject to military conscription, Yaffie reached the rank of corporal during his service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yaffie, Saul|url=http://www.gsaarchives.net/archon/index.php?p=core/search&amp;subjectid=677|website=Archives and Collections: Glasgow School of Art|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his conscription Yaffie engaged in munitions work, something that was recorded in the GSA's student registers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yaffie, Saul|url=http://www.gsaarchives.net/archon/index.php?p=core/search&amp;subjectid=677|website=Archives and Collections: Glasgow School of Art|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==
The post-war economic depression that affected the country during the 1920s, also affected the Yaffie family directly: Bernard Yaffie's business suffered greatly, and the family eventually emigrated to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yaffie, Saul|url=http://www.gsaarchives.net/archon/index.php?p=core/search&amp;subjectid=677|website=Archives and Collections: Glasgow School of Art|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saul did not emigrate with his family, choosing instead to stay in Europe, and relocate to [[Paris]] where he continued his artistic practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yaffie, Saul|url=http://www.gsaarchives.net/archon/index.php?p=core/search&amp;subjectid=677|website=Archives and Collections: Glasgow School of Art|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now married, Saul sought to escape persecution in Europe by returning to the UK before the [[World War II|Second World War]] with his wife, Estusia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7278">'''Social Betterment Properties International''' (SBPI) is a California-based entity associated with the [[Church of Scientology]], for which it operates as a real estate arm. The organisation states that its purpose is to "develop and maintain buildings and other real estate utilized by social betterment organizations carrying out programs that utilize technology and methods developed by [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and that are associated with and supported by the [[Scientology religion|Scientology]]".&lt;ref name="VCStar-5-Apr-2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vcstar.com/business/scientology-linked-nonprofit-buys-larry-hagmans|title=Scientology-linked nonprofit buys Larry Hagman's Ojai estate|last=Hoops|first=Stephanie|work=Ventura County Star|date=April 5, 2013|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been involved in the purchase of a number of properties in the United States and Canada in order to advance Scientology's "social betterment" programs, notably the controversial [[Narconon]] drug rehabilitation program.

==Status==

SBPI states in its articles of incorporation that it is "an integrated auxiliary of the [[Church of Scientology International]]", organised "to support Church of Scientology International by owning and managing real property used in Church of Scientology International's charitable public benefit program."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xenu-directory.net/documents/corporate/sbpi-incorporation.pdf|title=SBPI Articles of Incorporation|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 2003, it is registered as a [[501(c) organization]] (i.e. a [[tax-exempt]] [[nonprofit organization]]) and is not required to file an annual return with the [[IRS]] as it is designated as a religious organization. SBPI is co-located with the Church of Scientology International at 6331 Hollywood Boulevard, Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Betterment Properties International|url=http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/86-1067526/social-betterment-properties-international.aspx|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, an IRS Form 990 filed by SBPI stated that it had $39,647,311 of assets.&lt;ref name="990-2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/224963946/Church-of-Scientology-Social-Betterment-Properties-International-990-2008-Net-assets-39-573-456|title=Social Betterment Properties International - Form 900|date=2008|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

According to SPBI's IRS Form 990, it owed three properties as of 2008:

* Headquarters of [[Applied Scholastics|Applied Scholastics International]] at [[Spanish Lake, Missouri]];
* Narconon Arrowhead property at [[Canadian, Oklahoma]];
* Headquarters of [[Citizens Commission on Human Rights|Citizens Commission on Human Rights International]] in Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref name="990-2008" /&gt;

The organisation's property portfolio has expanded since then. In April 2013, it was disclosed that SBPI had paid $5 million to purchase the estate of the late actor [[Larry Hagman]] at [[Ojai, California]].&lt;ref name="VCStar-5-Apr-2015" /&gt; The purpose of this purchase was not disclosed but [[Mike Rinder]], the former head of the church's [[Office of Special Affairs]], has suggested that it may be intended for use as a "celebrity Narconon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tony-ortega/scientology-pays-5-millio_b_3028043.html|title=Scientology Pays $5 Million for Larry Hagman's Ojai Estate: And Here's Why|last=Ortega|first=Tony|work=The Huffington Post|date=April 8, 2013|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2013, SBPI purchased the former [[Trout Run (retreat)|Trout Run]] retreat near [[Thurmont, Maryland]] with the intention of converting it into a Narconon facility. The property was purchased for $4.85 million by a [[Delaware]] corporation, West Coast Property Investments Inc., which then turned Trout Run over to SBPI.&lt;ref name="Carignan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fredericknewspost.com/news/environment/natural_resource/myths-obscure-trout-run-s-past/article_4fad9e69-6a00-5a69-82c1-87989f47aa52.html|title=Myths obscure Trout Run's past|work=The Frederick News-Post|last=Carignan|first=Sylvia|date=May 30, 2015|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although zoning restrictions meant that establishing such a facility at Trout Run would ordinarily be impossible, using it as a group home would be permitted under local ordinances if the property was listed on the county's historic register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fredericknewspost.com/news/politics_and_government/governmental_and_political_topics/health_and_welfare/scientology-affiliates-plan-recovery-center-at-historic-retreat/article_0fb90e47-9dde-57a6-9368-df64a7dca59c.html|title=Scientology affiliates plan recovery center at historic retreat|author1=Bethany Rodgers|author2=Sylvia Carignan|work=The Frederick News-Post|date=April 4, 2015|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narconon sought to obtain such a designation but was rejected by the local county council.&lt;ref name="WaPo2-6-2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/frederick-council-rejects-historic-designation-for-trout-run-a-blow-for-a-scientology-backed-drug-rehab/2015/06/02/e3f12b74-0931-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|title=Frederick Council rejects historic designation for Trout Run, a blow for a Scientology-backed drug rehab|last1=Rosenwald|first1=Michael S.|last2=Bogage|first2=Jacob|work=The Washington Post|date=June 2, 2015|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 1, 2015, the decision is currently being appealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fredericknewspost.com/news/politics_and_government/frederick-county-council-s-decision-on-trout-run-questioned-in/article_3674d3e2-992a-533a-861f-74600cb64b93.html|title=Frederick County Council's decision on Trout Run questioned in court|last=Fifield|first=Jen|work=The Frederick News-Post|date=July 6, 2015|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, SBPI acquired a parcel of land in an isolated part of the Canadian town [[Milton, Ontario]] and applied for permission to establish a Narconon center there.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6133">{{Other uses|Over-soul (disambiguation)}}
"'''The Over-Soul'''" is an essay by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], first published in 1841. With the human [[soul]] as its overriding subject, several general themes are treated:  (1) the existence and nature of the human soul; (2) the relationship between the soul and the personal ego; (3) the relationship of one human soul to another; and (4) the relationship of the human soul to God.  Influence of Eastern religions, including [[Vedanta|Vedantism]], is plainly evident, but the essay also develops ideas long present in the Western tradition, e.g., in the works of [[Plato]], [[Plutarch]], and [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] like [[Plotinus]] and [[Proclus]] – all of whose writings Emerson read extensively throughout his career&lt;ref&gt;''The Teachers of Emerson'', John S. Harrison, New York: Sturgis &amp; Walton, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Emerson: The Mind on Fire'', Robert D. Richardson Jr, Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995 pp. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt; – and [[Emanuel Swedenborg]].

The essay attempts no systematic doctrine, but rather serves as a work of art, something like poetry.  Its virtue is in personal insights of the author and the lofty manner of their presentation.  Emerson wishes to exhort and direct the reader to an awakening of similar thoughts or sentiments.

With respect to the four themes listed above, the essay presents the following views:  (1) the human soul is immortal, and immensely vast and beautiful; (2) our conscious ego is slight and limited in comparison to the soul, despite the fact that we habitually mistake our ego for our true self; (3) at some level, the souls of all people are connected, though the precise manner and degree of this connection is not spelled out; and (4) the essay does not seem to explicitly contradict the traditional Western idea that the soul is created by and has an existence (?) that is similar to God, or rather God exists within us.

''The Over-Soul'' is now considered one of Emerson's greatest writings.

==History==
The essay includes the following passage:

{{quote|The Supreme Critic on the errors of the past and the present, and the only prophet of that which must be, is that great nature in which we rest, as the earth lies in the soft arms of the atmosphere; that Unity, that '''Over-soul''', within which every man's particular being is contained and made one with all other; that common heart.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Over-soul, from ''Essays: First Series,'' Ralph Waldo Emerson, 1841&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For Emerson the term denotes a supreme underlying unity which transcends duality or plurality, much in keeping with the philosophy of [[Advaita Vedanta]]. This non-Abrahamic interpretation of Emerson's use of the term is further supported by the fact that Emerson's Journal records in 1845 suggest that he was reading the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke]]'s essays on the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref&gt;''India in the United States: Contribution of India and Indians in the United States of America'', Sachin N. Pradhan, SP Press International, Inc., 1996, p 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Emerson goes on in the same essay to further articulate his view of this dichotomy between phenomenal plurality and transcendental unity:

{{quote|We live in succession, in division, in parts, in particles. Meantime within man is the soul of the whole; the wise silence; the universal beauty, to which every part and particle is equally related, the eternal ONE.  And this deep power in which we exist and whose beatitude is all accessible to us, is not only self-sufficing and perfect in every hour, but the act of seeing and the thing seen, the seer and the spectacle, the subject and the object, are one.  We see the world piece by piece, as the sun, the moon, the animal, the tree; but the whole, of which these are shining parts, is the soul.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;}}

"Over-soul" has more recently come to be used by Eastern philosophers such as [[Meher Baba]] and others as the closest English language equivalent of the Vedic concept of ''[[Paramatman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''God Speaks, The Theme of Creation and Its Purpose'', Meher Baba, Dodd Meade. 1955. Sec. Ed. pp. 1 ff., 156, 172&lt;/ref&gt;  (In [[Sanskrit]] the word ''param'' means "supreme" and ''atman'' means "soul"; thus ''Paramatman'' literally means "Supreme-Soul".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vedabase.net/p/param&lt;/ref&gt;)  The term is used frequently in discussion of Eastern metaphysics and has also entered western vernacular. In this context, the term "Over-soul" is understood as the collective indivisible Soul, of which all individual souls or identities are included. The experience of this underlying reality of the indivisible "I am" state of the Over-soul is said to be veiled from the human mind by [[sanskara (philosophy)|sanskara]]s, or impressions, acquired over the course of evolution and reincarnation. Such past impressions form a kind of sheath between the Over-soul and its true identity, as they give rise to the tendency of identification with the gross differentiated body. Thus the world, as [[apperception|apperceived]] through the impressions of the past appears plural, while reality experienced in the present, unencumbered by past impressions (the unconditioned or liberated mind), perceives itself as the One indivisible totality, i.e. the Over-soul.

'''''The Precious Scroll of the Immortal Maiden Equal to Heaven''''' is a [[Chinese folk religion]] work that originates from Western [[Gansu]], China. This ''[[Baojuan (Precious Scrolls)|baojuan]]'' (Precious Scroll) narrates the life and miracles of the Immortal Maiden, a deity that was widely venerated in Zhangye and elsewhere in the Gansu Corridor. The first 6 chapters are about her mortal life and how she achieved her divine status by her active piety, her persistent meditation, and her spectacular death during a flood. The next 6 chapters narrate how she rescued the Chinese from the Tatars, first by saving the Chinese general Huo Qubing from his enemies by creating a bridge across the Black River, which allowed him to escape, and next by inflicting three plagues on the Tatars who tried to demolish her temple in revenge. The final chapters narrate how she supports public morals among the Chinese by protecting a poor student from murder, by turning an unfilial daughter-in-law into a dog, by extending the life of a good Samaritan, and by saving a poor widow and her son from the shenanigans of her husband’s brother who tries to steal their inheritance. There is a printed edition dated 1698. A later addition includes more miracles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilt L. Idema|Idema, Wilt]].

'''''The Role of the Church in the Causation, Treatment and Prevention of the Crisis in the Priesthood''''', a report submitted to the [[General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops]] in [[Rome]] in 1971, by Dr [[Conrad Baars]], a Dutch-born Catholic psychiatrist from [[Minnesota]], and based on a study of 1500 priests, suggested that seminary training left priests poorly prepared for a lifetime of [[celibacy]].

==Description==
This report was published by Franciscan Herald Press in 1972 as '''''How to Treat and Prevent the Crisis in the Priesthood'''''. It was also expected to be published in 2006 by St. Paul's/Alba House as part of a book of essays on the priesthood and religious life.

#"psychosexual immaturity expressed in heterosexual or homosexual activity was encountered often. Virtually all of these priests were . . . suffering from a severe to moderate frustration neurosis”.
#Less than 15% of priests in Europe and North America were emotionally fully developed;
#Of the remaining 85%, 20–25% had "serious psychiatric difficulties" that they expressed through alcohol abuse, while 60–70% had less severe degrees of emotional immaturity.

Though the report suggested that immediate corrective action was needed, making ten recommendations, and one of those most active in the Synod was Cardinal Wojtyła, who on October 16, 1978 was elected [[Pope John Paul II]], no implementation of the report's detailed recommendations followed.

'''Varadamudra''' is a [[mudra]], and it indicates a gesture by the hand and symbolizes dispensing of [[:wikt:boon|boons]]. For varadamudra, right hand is used. It is held out, with palm uppermost and the fingers pointing downwards. Varadamudra and [[abhayamudra]] are the most common of several other mudras seen on images and [[Iconography|icons]] relating to [[Indian religions]].

'''Virasat-e-Khalsa''' ({{lang-pa|ਵਿਰਾਸਤ-ਏ-ਖਾਲਸਾ}}) is a museum of [[Sikhism]], located in the holy town, [[Anandpur Sahib]], near [[Chandigarh]], the capital of the state of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]. The museum celebrates 500 years of the [[Sikh history]] and the 300th anniversary of the [[Khalsa|birth of Khalsa]], based on the scriptures written by the tenth and last human guru, [[Guru Gobind Singh]].

==Structure==
There are two complexes at each side of a ravine, connected by a ceremonial bridge:
*The smaller western complex includes an entrance plaza, an auditorium with 400 seating-capacity, two-story research and reference library, and changing exhibition galleries.
*The eastern complex contains a round memorial building as well as extensive, permanent exhibition space, consisting of two clusters of galleries that try to evoke the fortress architecture of the region (most evident in a nearby Gurudwara) and form a dramatic silhouette against the surrounding cliff terrain. The gathering of the galleries in groups of five reflects the [[Five Virtues]], a central tenent of Sikhism.

The buildings are constructed of poured-in-place concrete; some beams and columns remain exposed, though a great deal of the structures will be clad in a local honey-colored stone. The rooftops are stainless steel-clad and exhibit a double curvature: they gather and reflect the sky while a series of dams in the ravine create pools that reflect the entire complex at night.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msafdie.com/php/print_project.php?id=27 Moshe Safdie and Associates | Project Details ]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17653">'''Women in [[Shinto]]''' occupy a unique role in the indigenous Japanese traditions of Shinto, including a unique form of participation as temple stewards and shamans, or ''miko''. Though a ban on Shinto priestesses was lifted after 1945, the number of women priests in Shinto is a small fraction of contemporary clergy.

==History of women in Shinto==
Women in Shinto have long been described as miko, or "Children of God." They are consistently seen as conduits between spirits and men, though men are then seen as the actors who implement the will of the spirit.&lt;ref name="Okano-Earhart"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Okano|first1=Haruko|authorlink1=Summary: Woman and the Shinto Religion|editor1-last=Earhart|editor1-first=H.Byron|title=Religion in the Japanese experience : sources and interpretations|date=1997|publisher=Wadsworth Pub. Co.|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=0534524613|pages=35–38|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mythological beginnings===
The diverse roles of women in Shinto myths make it difficult for scholars to generalize about women's roles at Shinto's origin.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt; [[Amateratsu]], the sun goddess, and [[Himiko]], an early shaman queen of Japan, are central figures in the faith. Other goddesses include [[Benten]], a dragon-woman of good luck, and [[Inari Ōkami|Inari]], a rice goddess who takes the form of [[kitsune]], a [[vixen]] (female fox) at many Shinto shrines.&lt;ref name=Monaghan /&gt; The [[Kojiki]], a collection of stories which form Shinto practices, purport to be collected from a courtesan, [[Hieda no Are]], and written down at the request of an Empress, [[Empress Gemmei of Japan|Gemmei]].&lt;ref name=Monaghan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Monaghan|first1=Patricia|title=Encyclopedia of Goddesses and Heroines|date=2014|publisher=New World Library|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest records of Shinto, from the 2nd to 7th centuries, women were valued as representatives, and carriers, of fertility. There is debate among scholars as to the extent of which this translated into political power within society or within Shinto practice, with some evidence suggesting a deferential tendency to women from male counterparts.&lt;ref name="Okano" /&gt; Some scholars suggest that priesthood at this time was seen as a dual role shared by men and women, operating together, often as brother and sister.&lt;ref name="Okano-Earhart" /&gt;

===Royal High Priestesses at Ise shrine===
According to the mythology of Japan described in the ''[[Nihon Shoki]],'' nieces or daughters of the Emperor or Empress served as intermediaries at one of Shinto's holiest sites, the [[Ise Grand Shrine|Ise shrine]], beginning in the 7th century.&lt;ref name=Bock&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bock|first1=Felicia|title=Engishiki: Procedures of the Engi era|date=1970|publisher=Sophia University|location=Tokyo|pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; These priestesses served to connect the reigning Emperor to the purported divine origin of that Emperor's power, and remained an official position until the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Yusa 1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Michigo|first1 = Yusa|authorlink1 = |editor1-last = |editor1-first = |editor1-link = |title = Women in Shinto: Images Remembered|date = 1993|publisher = State University of New York Press|location = Albany|isbn = 978-0791416891|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These priestesses retreated to the Royal Palace for a year after being chosen, followed by another year in seclusion, before moving to the Shrine at Ise, where they participated in, and watched over, purification rituals for about 11 years.&lt;ref name=Bock /&gt; Once retired, the priestess could marry.&lt;ref name="Ambros"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Ambros|first1 = Barbara|title = Women in Japanese Religions|date = 2015|publisher = New York University Press|location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Heian era===
[[File:Kamigamo-Jinjya National Treasure World heritage Kyoto 国宝・世界遺産 上賀茂神社 京都11.JPG|thumb|Kamo shrine, Kyoto]]
The Heian era saw an early synthesis of Buddhist and Shinto beliefs in Japan, and the integration of a Confucian legal system from China.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt; The introduction of a patriarchal Confucian system, combined with the Buddhist concepts of women as "unclean", resulted in a decline in power for female shaman and shrine priestesses.&lt;ref name="Okano-Earhart" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt; For example, women no longer had any claim to official positions at shrines,&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt; and [[miko]] were limited to maintenance and upkeep.&lt;ref name=Cornyetz&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cornyetz|first1=Nina|title=Dangerous Women, Deadly Words: Phallic Fantasy and Modernity|date=1999|publisher=Stanford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars suggest that, while spiritual power was considered equal among male and female priests in this time period, male priests nonetheless wielded larger influence and political power.&lt;ref name="Yanagita 1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yanagita|first1=Kunio|title=Works of Yanagita Kunio|date=1962|publisher=Chikuma Shohu|location=Tokyo|pages=7–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest that the role of women in Shinto is a contemporary myth without connection to ancient Shinto practice.&lt;ref name="Cornyetz"/&gt;

Ise shrine priestess maintained their role during this period, and were complemented by a similar position at the [[Kamo Shrine|Kamo shrine]] in Kyoto.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt; Like Ise priestesses, those at Kamo served one year at the Imperial Palace before overseeing the shrines activities. These priestesses would also perform rituals and purifications, including fasting and overseeing ceremonies.&lt;ref name=Bock /&gt;

===Tokugawa and Meiji era===
During the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], all Shinto priests were consolidated under the control of the [[Yoshida Shintō|Yoshida]] family, which limited the power of female priests.&lt;ref name=Routledge&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kramarae|first1=Cheris|last2=Spender|first2=Dale|title=Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135963156|page=1847}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prohibition was carried through into the [[Meiji period|Meiji era]], which sought to regulate Shinto practices. Here, a nationalist movement toward modernization called for the elimination of magical elements that had come to be most closely associated with women.&lt;ref name="Okano-Earhart" /&gt; This trend continued until the defeat of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]].&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt; After the defeat of Imperial Japan, Shinto and the state were rendered legally distinct, with prohibitions on state involvement, and later, women were again permitted to become priests.&lt;ref name="Okano-Earhart" /&gt;

==Shinto taboos applicable to women==

===Exclusion from sacred sites===
[[File:Omine 2.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Sign announcing the prohibition of women climbers]]

Women were excluded from many Shinto shrines and sacred mountains up to about 1872, a practice known as {{Nihongo||女人結界|nyonin kekkai}}.&lt;ref name=Fumiko /&gt; This practice was abolished under the Meiji constitution.&lt;ref name=Fumiko&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fumiko|first1=Miyazaki|title=Female Pilgrims and Mt. Fuji: Changing Perspectives on the Exclusion of Women|journal=Monumenta Nipponica|date=1 January 2005|volume=60|issue=3|pages=339–391|doi=10.1353/mni.2005.0034|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/monumenta_nipponica/summary/v060/60.3fumiko.html|issn=1880-1390|postscript={{subscription needed|via=[https://muse.jhu.edu/ Project MUSE]}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians suggest that the practice may have originated from folk tales about women who were turned to stone or brought on natural disasters as they approached sacred sites on mountains,&lt;ref name=Fumiko /&gt;&lt;ref name=Yanagita&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yanagita|first1=Kunio|title=Teihon: Yanagita Kunio zenshû (volume 9)|date=1962|publisher=Chikuma Shobo|location=Tokyo|pages=123–146|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; or owing to the choice of religious ascetics that rejected interactions with women, and commonly lived high in the mountains.&lt;ref name=Fumiko /&gt;&lt;ref name=Suzuki-2002&gt;{{cite book|last1=Masataka|first1=Suzuki|title=Nyonin kinsei|date=2002|publisher=Yoshikawa Kōbunkan|location=Tōkyō|isbn=464205538X|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/nyonin-kinsei/oclc/49728832|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest the prohibition is influenced by Buddhist doctrine against sexual relationships between monks and nuns.&lt;ref name=Fumiko /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ushiyama&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ushiyama|first1=Yoshiyuki|title='Nyonin kinsei' sairon ("he System of Exclusion of Women" Reconsidered")|journal=Sangaku shugen|date=1996|volume=17|pages=1–11|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of the practice remain in contemporary Japan. A sign at a World Heritage site, [[Mount Ōmine|Mt. Omine]] in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], forbids women from climbing to the top, which has triggered a number of controversial protests.&lt;ref name=Takemaru&gt;{{cite book|last1=Takemaru|first1=Naoko|title=Women in the Language and Society of Japan|date=2010|publisher=McFarland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some shrines also ask recent mothers not to pass through torii gates to enter shrines for 72 days after childbirth.&lt;ref name=Takemaru /&gt;

Women had been forbidden from participation in Yamakasa, parades in which Shinto shrines are carried through a town, until 2001.&lt;ref name=Takemaru /&gt;

===Blood pollution===
Women's menstrual blood is a taboo in Shinto, thought to be influenced by the popularity of the Buddhist {{Nihongo|Blood Pond Sutra|血盆経|Ketsubonkyô}}. This doctrine preached that women were condemned to a blood pond hell for the sin of pollution through menstrual blood; only the prayer could spare them.&lt;ref name=Fumiko /&gt;&lt;ref name="Matsuoka 1988"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matsuoka|first1=Hideaki|editor1-last=Kenkyûkai|editor1-first=Sôgô Joseishi|title=Nihon joseishi ronshû: Shûkyô to josei (5)|date=1988|publisher=Yoshikawa Kôbunkan|location=Tokyo|language=Japanese|chapter=Wagakuni ni okeru Ketsubonkyô shinkô ni tsuite no ichikôsatsu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Buddhist in origin, Shinto facilities emulated this practice in their teaching, encourage women, and men who had contact with menstrual women, to avoid shrines.&lt;ref name=Fumiko /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ushiyama /&gt;

==Women Shinto priests==
In Shinto, female priests are allowed, but remain rare, and take on the male role of priests from recent history, more so than the traditional Shamanistic role of women in early Shinto.&lt;ref name="Okano-Earhart" /&gt; More common roles for women in the clergy are ''[[miko]]'', shrine stewards who assist the chief priest. Outside of organized Shinto, however, an increasing number of women are taking the title "miko" and tying it to original Shinto practices such as fortune-telling and healing arts.&lt;ref name="Okano-Earhart" /&gt;

Though 20 women per year graduate from [[Kokugakuin University]] with credentials for priesthood, less than two per year become clergy.&lt;ref name=Karan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karan|first1=Pradyumna|title=Japan in the 21st Century: Environment, Economy, and Society|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[Association of Shinto Shrines]] estimated that there were fewer than 25 women priests in Tokyo.&lt;ref name=Karan /&gt;

A ban on female priests was lifted during World War Two, reflecting smaller family sizes and a shrinking interest in religion within Japan,&lt;ref name="Karan"/&gt; as well as a labor shortage after the war.&lt;ref name="Kobayashi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Kobayashi|first1 = Akiko|title = Priestesses of Shinto Religion.|journal = Bangalore: Journal of Dharma|date = 2000|pages = 81–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the first women priests were the wives or daughters of priests who went to war. These women were typically preferred over new priests, because they were well versed in their husband’s duties, and already integrated into the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=John K.|title=A Year in the Life of a Shinto Shrine|date=1996|publisher=University of Washington Press|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special considerations for women priests===
Some Shinto priestesses assert that Shinto is no different from other religions in its treatment of women. Akiko Kobayashi, then a priestess for more than 20 years, has stated that there is "no opposition" from  either male priests or those who attend shrines led by women priests.&lt;ref name="Kobayashi"/&gt;

[[Menstruation]] poses a unique challenge to women priests in Shinto, which considers menstrual blood a defilement of sacred spaces.&lt;ref name="Namihara"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Namihara|first1 = Emiko|title = Pollution on the Folk Belief System.|journal = Current Anthropology|date = 1987|volume = 28|issue = 4|page = |pages = S65–S74 | doi = 10.1086/203590}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "red uncleanness" (''aka fujo'', in Japanese) was invoked as a traditional restriction on women’s participation in sacred space from 1872 to just before World War Two.&lt;ref name="Miyazaki"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Miyazaki|first1 = Fumiko|title = Female Pilgrims and Mt. Fuji: Changing Perspectives on the Exclusion of Women.|journal = Monumenta Nipponica|date = 2005|volume = 60|issue = 3|page = 340|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
At that point, the Association of Shinto Shrines lifted the ban on women priests and encouraged Shinto shrines to reject the association of "''aka fujo''."&lt;ref name="Smyers"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Smyers|first1 = Karen A.|title = Women and Shinto: The Relation Between Purity and Pollution.|journal = Japanese Religions.|date = 1983|volume = 12|issue = 4|page = |pages = 7–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, menstrual periods in Shinto priests are controlled through the use of medication.&lt;ref name=Okano&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Okano|first1=Haruko|title=Women and Sexism in Shinto|journal=Japan Christian Review|date=1993|volume=59|page=29|url=https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/3517}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fujimura&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fujimura-Fanselow|first1=Kumiko|title=Transforming Japan: How Feminism and Diversity Are Making a Difference|date=2011|publisher=CUNY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most important shrines in National Shinto sects, [[Ise Shrine|Ise]] and [[Atsuta Shrine|Atsuta]], continue to limit the participation of women priests.&lt;ref name="Okano"/&gt; Other obstacles to female priesthood in Shinto include the patronage system, in which an elder priest serves as a mentor for a new priest during religious instruction. This patronage system forbids male priests from instructing women. With a majority of Shinto priests being men, this can pose a challenge for aspiring female priests to find elder mentors.&lt;ref name=Lebra&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lebra|first1=Takie S.|title=Identity, Gender, and Status in Japan: Collected Papers of Takie Lebra|date=2007|publisher=Folkestone|location=Kent, UK|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable women Shinto priests===

Nobuyo Otagaki, a female Shinto priest at Amagasaki Ebisu Shrine, in [[Amagasaki]], [[Hyogo Prefecture]], Japan. Otagaki, the daughter of a Shinto priest, was a graduate of [[Ritsumeikan University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://profile.ameba.jp/amaebisu/|title = Ameba Profile Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; After taking on work as a flight attendant, Otagaki began to study Shinto and became certified into priesthood.&lt;ref name=Nishide /&gt; After moving to New York for two years, she returned to Amagasaki to become a resident priest in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profile.ameba.jp/amaebisu/|title=神主Nobbyさんのプロフィールページ|website=profile.ameba.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; She took over the Chief Priesthood position from her father in 2012.&lt;ref name=Nishide&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nishide|first1=Takeshi|title=Women’s entry into Shinto priesthood is on the rise|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2014/03/06/lifestyle/womens-entry-into-shinto-priesthood-is-on-the-rise/#.VmI-GdWrTnA|website=Japan Times|publisher=Japan Times|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mihoko Ishii, 58, had been a housewife. She became the priest of Suwa Shrine in Nambu, [[Aomori Prefecture]], after the death of her husband, who had been chief priest.&lt;ref name=Nishide /&gt;

==Women in folk Shinto==
In popular, localized traditions influenced by, but not officially recognized as,&lt;ref name="Fackler-NYTimes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fackler|first1=Martin|title=As Japan’s Mediums Die, Ancient Tradition Fades|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/21/world/asia/21japan.html?_r=0|website=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=1 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411161542/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/21/world/asia/21japan.html|archivedate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shinto practice, there is a common figure of [[itako]], or ichiko, or ogamisama: blind mediums. These shaman are always women who enter the calling prior to menstruation. Evidence shows some common aspects of initiation practices for these women among schools in Yamagata, Aomori, and Miyagi prefectures in the 1920s and 1930s. They are trained in various practices, including memorization of Shinto and Buddhist prayers and sutras. Training typically involved cold-water ''mizugori'', or purifying baths, which in its most extreme form can involve complete, sustained drenching by ice-cold water for a period of several days. Once named an itako or ichiko, the woman serves as an intermediary for kami and deceased spirits.&lt;ref name="Blacker"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blacker|first1=Carmen|editor1-last=Earhart|editor1-first=Byron|title=Religion in the Japanese experience : sources and interpretations|date=1997|publisher=Wadsworth Pub. Co.|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=0534524613|pages=130–135|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
