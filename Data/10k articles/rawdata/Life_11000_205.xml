Moti '''Abba Rebu''' was king of the [[Gibe region|Gibe]] [[Kingdom of Jimma]], in Ethiopia, (reigned 1855–1859). He was the son of [[Abba Jifar I]].

Abba Rebu was a warlike king, and said to have been tyrannical. He defeated his older brother and designated heir Abba Gommol for control of the throne, and exiled him to the [[Kingdom of Kaffa]]. Abba Rebu was killed in battle, either fighting against the [[Kingdom of Gomma]] who surprised him by bringing soldiers from the kingdoms of [[Limmu-Ennarea]] and [[Kingdom of Gera|Gera]], or by the treachery of his own subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert S. Lewis, ''A Galla Monarchy: Jimma Abba Jifar, Ethiopia'' (Madison, Wisconsin, 1965), pp. 42f.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1864">Saint '''Abran''' ([[Breton language|Breton]] for 'Abraham'), also known as '''Gibrian''', was a 6th-century Irish [[hermit]] in Brittany.

He was born in [[Ireland]] and with eight of his siblings traveled to [[Brittany]]. St. Abran and his siblings chose of life of devotion to [[Trinity|God]] in the [[Consecrated life|consecrated religious life]]. He lived in a [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]] on the [[Marne River]], which had been given to him by [[Saint Remigius]].

Abran and his siblings are all considered [[saint]]s for their positive [[Christian]] influence upon the [[Breton people]].

Saint Abran's [[feast day]] is 8 May on the [[Western Rite Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholic Church]] calendars.

'''Algenol''', founded in 2006, headquartered in [[Fort Myers, Florida]], Algenol is an industrial biotechnology company that is commercializing patented algae technology for production of [[ethanol]] and other fuels. The technology enables the production of the four most important fuels ([[ethanol]], [[gasoline]], [[Jet fuel|jet]], and [[diesel fuel]]) using a proprietary process involving [[algae]], [[sunlight]], [[carbon dioxide]] and [[Seawater|salt water]].

==History==

In 2008 the company announced it would begin commercial production of Ethanol by 2009 in the Sonoran Desert in northwest Mexico. This seems not to have happened though and as of 2015 they are still not in commercial production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenoptimistic.com/algenol-mexico-factory-to-produce-ethanol-from-algae-by-2009-20080617/|title=Algenol Mexico Factory to Produce Ethanol from Algae by 2009 - The Green Optimistic|date=17 June 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015 Paul Woods, the founder, resigned and the company announced they were laying off 25% of the staff and changing to a  “water treatment and carbon capture now, and maybe fuels later” focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2015/10/25/algenol-ceo-exits-staff-cut-by-25-investors-re-up-for-two-years-new-direction-tipped/|title=Algenol CEO exits; staff cut by 25%, investors re-up for two years, new direction tipped : Biofuels Digest|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Algenol celebrated its 10th Anniversary and added algae-based sustainable products to its portfolio.  Their name changed to Algenol Biotech LLC, and they are focusing on algae-based product development and manufacturing.

==Research==
Algenol’s biofuel technology potentially allows production of the four most important fuels ([[ethanol]], [[gasoline]], [[Jet fuel|jet]], and [[diesel fuel]]) for around $1.27 per  gallon each at production levels of 8,000 total gallons of liquid fuel per acre per year, but to date has not been successfully implemented in commercial production. Potentially the fuel would be produced with a 60% reduction in [[carbon footprint]] and could offer customers savings of 75 cents a gallon. The technology could produce high yields and relies on patented photobioreactors and proprietary downstream techniques for low-cost fuel production. These low-cost techniques consume carbon dioxide from industrial sources,  do not use farmland or food crops, and provide [[fresh water]]. 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.algenolbiofuels.com/advantages-weutilize.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115042429/http://www.algenolbiofuels.com/advantages-weutilize.html |date=January 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their biofuel technology uses sunlight, algae, non-arable land and carbon dioxide to produce ethanol and the leftover spent algae that can be converted into other [[biofuels]]. The technology uses [[blue-green algae]] (or [[cyanobacteria]]) to change CO2 and seawater into sugars and then into ethanol and [[biomass]].&lt;ref name="algenol.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://algenol.com/direct-to-ethanol/direct-to-ethanol |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-04-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708120223/http://algenol.com/direct-to-ethanol/direct-to-ethanol |archive-date=2014-07-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The process is the only one that can convert more than 85% of its [[CO2]] [[feedstock]] into the four fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://algenol.com/|title=Home - Algenol|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2014}}

Algenol’s algae are [[non-invasive]] in natural habitats and the company has tested the algae repeatedly to ensure it is [[non-toxic]], non-invasive, and are not plant pests&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://algenol.com/direct-to-ethanol/environmental-benefits |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-04-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329011522/http://algenol.com/direct-to-ethanol/environmental-benefits |archive-date=2014-03-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algenol also offers its algae expertise to develop and manufacture products outside of biofuels.  According to their website, they have the ability to develop: natural food colorants, bio-fertilizers, nutraceuticals, algae-based animal feed, and skin product additives.

==Locations==
Algenol's newest facility is located in [[Southwest Florida]], just north of [[Florida Gulf Coast University]] in [[Fort Myers]], and opened in October 2010.  The new commercial development facility is working to create a commercially viable fuel from algae.&lt;ref name="Grand Opening"&gt;{{cite news|title=Algenol to change SW Fla., the world|url=http://www.news-press.com/article/20101020/BUSINESS/10200379/Algenol-to-change-SW-Fla-the-world}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The site features research labs including engineering facilities, advanced molecular biology, CO2 management, separations, and  green chemistry advanced labs and an outdoor process development production unit on 40 acres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Impending verdict on Algenol’s biofuel production utility|url=http://www.biofuels-news.com/industry_news.php?item_id=1708|publisher=Biofuels International, February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is to cover 43,000sqft and to include {{convert|40|acre|m2}} of photobioreactors&lt;ref name="pr-canada1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Algenol Partners With Lee County as Commission Votes to Approve Incentive Funding for Florida-Based|url=http://pr-canada.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=164477&amp;Itemid=58|publisher=PR-CANADA.net|access-date=2010-02-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724020531/http://pr-canada.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=164477&amp;Itemid=58|archive-date=2011-07-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2011, Algenol began construction on a pilot-scale Integrated Biorefinery, allowing the company to work with algae from a single strain in the lab all the way to commercial-scale production. The Integrated Biorefinery, completed in 2012, demonstrates the commercial viability of the technology.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://algenol.com/about-algenol/facilities-locations |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-04-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918042956/http://www.algenol.com/about-algenol/facilities-locations |archive-date=2013-09-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algenol also has subsidiaries located in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] and [[Zug]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Alia Al Mansoori''' (born July/23/2002) is an Emirati teenage pupil at [[Al Mawakeb School]]. In 2017 she won the Genes in Space UAE competition, with a proposal to study how exposure to space affects the health of live organisms at cellular level. Her experiment was loaded onto the August 2017 [[SpaceX CRS-12]] mission.&lt;ref&gt;James Langton, [https://www.thenational.ae/uae/science/dreams-of-emirati-teenager-alia-al-mansoori-launched-into-space-1.619762 Dreams of Emirati teenager Alia Al Mansoori launched into space], August 14, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anny Ahlers''' (December 21, 1907 &amp;ndash; March 14, 1933) was a [[Germany|German]] actress and singer. She was born in [[Hamburg]].

==Career==
She was born to Wilhelm Ahlers and his wife Augusta Victoria (Lieberg).&lt;ref&gt;''Who Was Who in the Theatre: 1912-1976'' vol.1 A-C p.18; compiled from editions originally published annually by John Parker, this 1976 edition by Gale Research..Retrieved July 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was an Army officer and her maternal grandmother was English. Ahlers began her career at the age of four, appearing as a dancer in [[circus]] acts. At seven she studied at the Operatic School of Dancing in Hamburg. Her breakthrough role was in the operetta ''Casanova'', composed by [[Ralph Benatzky]]. This role established her popularity in [[Berlin]].

In December 1931, she appeared with [[Richard Tauber]] in an operetta by [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]] at the Admiralspalast in Berlin. This was called 'Das Lied der Liebe' and was based on the Johann Strauss operetta [[Das Spitzentuch der Königin]]. [ref: Daniel O'Hara, Richard Tauber: A new Chronology, Saltburn, 2013]. This ran until March 1932, after which she went to [[London]], England to appear with [[Heddle Nash]] in the operetta ''The Dubarry'' at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] [Ref: Eleanor Allen, Heddle Nash: Singing against the Tide, Jubilee House, London, 2010.

On 14 March 1933, while appearing in London, she died in controversial circumstances after jumping out her flat window in an apparent suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title="Ahlers, Anny (1906–1933)." Dictionary of Women Worldwide: 25,000 Women Through the Ages|last= Gale|year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her death has been blamed both on [[morphine]] that she had taken while suffering from [[tuberculosis]], and on sleeping pills she was taking due to insomnia.

'''Barbara Stephens''' (August 30, 1922 – July 31, 1947) was a young American [[journalism|journalist]] who died in a mysterious [[Aviation accidents and incidents|plane crash]] in [[Xinjiang province]], China in 1947. Stephens was investigating the [[Kuomintang]] treatment of ethnic minorities in the province when in 1947 she traveled to [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture|Ili]] to report on the Soviet backed [[Second East Turkestan Republic]]. That year she was killed in the plane crash on a flight from Xinjiang to Beijing that also took the life of a Chinese general and the son of a [[Member of Parliament|British member of Parliament]].&lt;ref name=hrw1993&gt;{{cite book |last=Laird |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Laird |coauthors= |title=Into Tibet: The CIA's First Atomic Spy and his Secret Expedition into Lhasa  |year=2002 |publisher=[[Grove Press]]  |location= |id= |pages=36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

She was born Barbara Ellen Beerbower on August 30, 1922, in [[Yonkers, New York]], to Louis Dumont Beerbower and Margaret Stephens. After her parents' divorce, she changed her name to Stephens, her mother's maiden name. Her family relocated to [[Arlington County, Virginia]] in the Washington, D.C. area.

Miss Stephens attended the [[University of Alabama]] for a year, then transferred to [[Barnard College]] in New York City, from where she graduated. After college, she took an overseas assignment with the [[United States Office of War Information]] (O.W.I.), and was stationed in [[Chungking]]. While in Chungking, she became good friends with, among others, [[Graham Peck]] and [[Christopher Rand]], later a China correspondent for the [[New York Herald Tribune]].

She appeared in the November 5, 1945, issue of [[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine ("''Life'' Goes on a Date in Chungking").
  
At war's end, she resigned from OWI and worked briefly as a [[Stringer (journalism)|stringer]] for [[Agence France-Presse]], filing dispatches on the [[Chinese Civil War]] from her post in Beijing (Peiping). In late 1946 she journeyed overland to [[Xinjiang]] (Sinkiang) to obtain facts about [[Kuomintang]] treatment of ethnic minorities in the province.  She was carrying the dossier of her lengthy investigation when the plane crashed.

Her remains were recovered several weeks after the crash and interred on December 22, 1947, in a courtyard of the American embassy at [[Nanking]]. Ambassador [[John Leighton Stuart]] presided at her funeral service.  According to Peter Rand, the "translated inscription" on the grave marker reads:

:You died and went back to the place
:Where you are from
:But we are still here in this bloody,
:Crazy, unlucky world.
:But as you know we will fight
:Forever without hesitation.
:We will never give up, and will
:Still drink vodka, and laugh loudly.
:Go my dear child without worry.
:You will still be alive in our hearts.

==Fiction==

The character 'Alice James' in the historical novel ''[[Flash House]]'' by [[Aimee Liu]] is based on Stephens.&lt;ref name=ov&gt;{{

'''Sir Robert James Charles''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|ONZ|KNZM|CBE}} (born 14 March 1936) is a New Zealand [[professional golfer]]. His achievements over five decades rank him among the most successful left-handed golfers of all time, being the first lefty to win a golf [[Men's major golf championships|major]], winning more than 70 titles, and beating his age twice during a tournament as a 71-year-old.

==Early years==
Born in [[Carterton (New Zealand)|Carterton]], a small town in the [[Wairarapa]] district in [[New Zealand]]'s [[North Island]], Charles lived in [[Masterton]] where he worked as a bank teller. He won the [[New Zealand Open]] at [[Heretaunga, Wellington|Heretaunga]] on 8 November 1954, as an 18-year-old amateur.

Charles decided to hone his skills as an amateur first, and remained in his bank employment for a further six years. He represented New Zealand several times in international amateur tournaments during this period.

==Professional career==
Charles turned professional in 1960 and the next year won the New Zealand PGA Championship and soon after ventured overseas to the European and North American circuits.

In 1963, Charles won his first [[PGA Tour]] event in the United States, the [[Houston Classic]], the first PGA Tour event won by a left-handed golfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Houston Classic 1963 Champion – Bob Charles | url=http://www.shellhoustonopen.com/t_champs.cfm?task=story&amp;ID=18 | accessdate=12 December 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012160542/http://www.shellhoustonopen.com/t_champs.cfm?task=story&amp;ID=18 | archivedate=12 October 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year he won [[The Open Championship]] at [[Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes Golf Club|Royal Lytham and St. Annes]]. After four rounds (68-72-66-71) his 277 was level with American [[Phil Rodgers]]. Charles won the 36-hole playoff by eight shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theopen.com/en/History/OpenChampions.aspx#player=Bob+CHARLES |title=1963 Bob Charles |publisher=The Open |accessdate=18 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016164928/http://www.theopen.com/en/History/OpenChampions.aspx#player=Bob+CHARLES |archivedate=16 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles has won about 80 tournaments around the world. As well as his PGA Tour victories, his win in the 1969 [[Volvo World Match Play Championship|World Matchplay Championship]] was considered one of his best. He won the [[Senior British Open]] 30 years after winning his British Open title. He remains, along with [[Michael Campbell]], one of only two New Zealanders to win a [[Men's major golf championships|men's major golf championship]].

In 2007 Charles became the oldest golfer to make a cut on the [[European Tour]] at the [[Michael Hill New Zealand Open]]. Charles shot a 68 in the second round, beating his age by three strokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Bob Charles a cut above at age of 71 | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=A1YourView&amp;xml=/sport/2007/12/01/sgeuro101.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | first=Austin | last=Peters | date=1 December 2007 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would go on to finish in a tie for 23rd place.

Charles's move to the Senior PGA Tour (now called [[Champions Tour]]) was very lucrative and successful with 23 titles; and in three years 1988, 1989 and 1993, he recorded lowest scoring average. He finished second on the [[European Seniors Tour]]'s 2007 [[Wentworth Senior Masters]] at the age of 71. He was the first left-hander to win a major, but also the first lefty to be inducted into the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]], in the veterans category. He was inducted in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pgatour.com/2008/r/07/09/wghof.charles/index.html Charles to be inducted into World Golf Hall of Fame] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080712075857/http://www.pgatour.com/2008/r/07/09/wghof.charles/index.html |date=12 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He would remain the only lefty inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame until [[Phil Mickelson]] was elected in 2011.

At the [[Senior British Open Championship]] in 2010, Charles announced in an [[ESPN]] interview that he would retire from golf, stating that he was "74 years old, traveling this world for 50 years, and it's time to slow down and spend more time on my farm in New Zealand with my family."

==Personal life==
Charles is a sporting hero in New Zealand, not only for his achievements but also for his demeanour and philanthropy regarding junior golfers.

'''[[Archduchess]] Cecilia Renata of Austria''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Cäcilia Renata''; [[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Cecylia Renata''; 16 July 1611 – 24 March 1644) was [[List of Polish consorts|Queen of Poland]] as the wife of King [[Władysław IV Vasa]].

==Biography==
Cecilia Renata was a daughter of [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor]], of the [[House of Habsburg]], and [[Maria Anna of Bavaria (1574-1616)|Maria Anna of Bavaria]].
Born in 1611 in [[Graz]], she was chosen as bride by the Polish nobility. She married Władysław on 9 August in Vienna by proxy, and then in Warsaw in person on 12 September 1637, and the same day was [[royal coronations in Poland|crowned]] at [[Katedra św. Jana, Warsaw|St. John's Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Podhorodecki |first=Leszek |authorlink=Leszek Podhorodecki |title=Wazowie w Polsce |year=1985 |publisher=Ludowa Spółdzielnia Wydawnicza |location=Warszawa |isbn=83-205-3639-1 |pages=264–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first royal coronation outside of [[Kraków]], the historic, former capital of Poland, and this greatly angered the Polish nobility. A law was instigated to reserve coronations to Kraków in 1638.

Young and energetic, she soon began organising the royal court to her liking. She was popular, especially for her politeness.  One noble wrote in his memoirs that she insisted other women sit with her, even though she was queen. Cecilia could not remove her husband's mistress, Hedwig Łuszkowska, by herself, so she arranged a marriage between Hedwig and Starosta Merecki, John Wypyski. In 1638, Cecilia and Władysław visited Vienna.

Cecilia advocated the Habsburg and pro-[[Catholic]] point of view and allied herself with the pro-Habsburg faction of chancellor [[Jerzy Ossoliński]] and pro-Catholic [[Albrycht Stanisław Radziwiłł]]. Her political opponent at the court was the faction of [[Adam Kazanowski]], whose influence over King Władysław, his childhood friend, diminished after her marriage. Kazanowski was allied with Chancellor [[Piotr Gembicki]], who thus became one of her opponents.
Her influence was strong for the first 2–3 years of marriage, and she had much to say about the royal nominations for important official positions. After 1638/1639 when Władysław realised that Habsburgs were prepared to give him little assistance, her power waned, and he started to disregard her advice.

Cecilia kept in contact with her brothers and continued an intimate attachment with them; she also became friends with her sister-in-law Anna Catherine. She enjoyed music, concerts, theatre performances and this may have greatly influenced her husband, who was one of the founders of Polish national theatre and brought many famous and well-known artists and performers from all around Europe to the country.

During her marriage she became pregnant three times: Her first child, a son [[Sigismund Casimir of Poland|Sigismund Casimir]] was born on 1 April 1640 and died aged seven, on 9 August 1647; her second child, a daughter Maria Anna Isabella was born on 8 January 1642 and died one month later, on 7 February 1642. On 23 March 1644 Cecilia Renata gave birth her third child, a stillborn daughter.&lt;ref&gt;S. Ochmann-Staniszewska, ''Dynastia Wazów w Polsce'', Warsaw 2006, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; She died next day as a consequence of an infection, likely related to her recent childbirth. Following her sudden death, Cecilia Renata was deeply mourned by both Władysław and the Royal Polish court. She also left a good impression on the public, mostly for her piety and good will.

Such remodeling is principally carried out by 1) covalent [[histone modification]]s by specific enzymes, e.g., histone acetyltransferases (HATs), deacetylases, methyltransferases, and kinases, and 2) ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes which either move, eject or restructure [[nucleosomes]].&lt;ref name="Teif&amp;Rippe_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Teif VB, Rippe K | title = Predicting nucleosome positions on the DNA: combining intrinsic sequence preferences and remodeler activities | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 37 | issue = 17 | pages = 5641–55 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19625488 | pmc = 2761276 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkp610 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides actively regulating gene expression, dynamic remodeling of chromatin imparts an epigenetic regulatory role in several key biological processes, egg cells DNA replication and repair; apoptosis; chromosome segregation as well as development and pluripotency. Aberrations in chromatin remodeling proteins are found to be associated with human diseases, including cancer. Targeting chromatin remodeling pathways is currently evolving as a major therapeutic strategy in the treatment of several cancers.

==Overview==

The Stem Cell Research Community, StemBook, doi/10.3824/stembook.1.45.1.|Chromatin organization: The basic unit of chromatin organization is the nucleosome, which comprises 147 bp of DNA wrapped around a core of histone proteins. The level of nucleosomal packaging can have profound consequences on all DNA-mediated processes including gene regulation. Euchromatin (loose or open chromatin) structure is permissible for transcription whereas heterochromatin (tight or closed chromatin) is more compact and refractory to factors that need to gain access to the DNA template. Nucleosome positioning and chromatin compaction can be influenced by a wide range of processes including modification to both histones and DNA and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes. By Sha, K. and Boyer, L. A., stemBook 2009]] 
The transcriptional regulation of the genome is controlled primarily at the [[Transcription (genetics)#Pre-initiation|preinitiation stage]] by binding of the core transcriptional machinery proteins (namely, RNA polymerase, transcription factors, and activators and repressors) to the core promoter sequence on the coding region of the DNA. However, DNA is tightly packaged in the nucleus with the help of packaging proteins, chiefly histone proteins to form repeating units of [[nucleosomes]] which further bundle together to form condensed chromatin structure.  Such condensed structure occludes many DNA regulatory regions, not allowing them to interact with transcriptional machinery proteins and regulate gene expression. To overcome this issue and allow dynamic access to condensed DNA, a process known as chromatin remodeling alters nucleosome architecture to expose or hide regions of DNA for transcriptional regulation.

By '''definition''', chromatin remodeling is the enzyme-assisted process to facilitate access of nucleosomal DNA by remodeling the structure, composition and positioning of nucleosomes.

==Classification==
Access to nucleosomal DNA is governed by two major classes of protein complexes:
# Covalent histone-modifying complexes.
# ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes.

===Covalent histone-modifying complexes===
Specific protein complexes, known as histone-modifying complexes catalyze addition or removal of various chemical elements on histones. These enzymatic modifications include [[acetylation]], [[methylation]], [[phosphorylation]], and [[ubiquitination]] and primarily occur at N-terminal histone tails. Such modifications affect the binding affinity between histones and DNA, and thus loosening or tightening the condensed DNA wrapped around histones, e.g., Methylation of specific lysine residues in H3 and H4 causes further condensation of DNA around histones, and thereby preventing binding of transcription factors to the DNA leading to gene repression. On contrary, histone acetylation relaxes chromatin condensation and exposes DNA for TF binding, leading to increase gene expression.&lt;ref name="Wang_2007_1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang GG, Allis CD, Chi P | title = Chromatin remodeling and cancer, Part I: Covalent histone modifications | journal = Trends in Molecular Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 9 | pages = 363–72 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17822958 | doi = 10.1016/j.molmed.2007.07.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Known modifications====
Well characterized modifications to histones include:&lt;ref name="Strahl"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strahl BD, Allis CD | title = The language of covalent histone modifications | journal = Nature | volume = 403 | issue = 6765 | pages = 41–5 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10638745 | doi = 10.1038/47412 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Methylation]]
Both lysine and arginine residues are known to be methylated. Methylated lysines are the best understood marks of the histone code, as specific methylated lysine match well with gene expression states. Methylation of lysines H3K4 and H3K36 is correlated with transcriptional activation while demethylation of H3K4 is correlated with silencing of the genomic region. Methylation of lysines H3K9 and H3K27 is correlated with transcriptional repression.&lt;ref name="Rosenfeld_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosenfeld JA, Wang Z, Schones DE, Zhao K, DeSalle R, Zhang MQ | title = Determination of enriched histone modifications in non-genic portions of the human genome | journal = BMC Genomics | volume = 10 | pages = 143 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19335899 | pmc = 2667539 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2164-10-143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, H3K9me3 is highly correlated with constitutive heterochromatin.&lt;ref name="Hublitz"&gt;{{cite journal  | last1 = Hublitz  | first1 = Philip | last2 = Albert | first2 = Mareike | last3 = Peters | first3 = Antoine | name-list-format = vanc | title = Mechanisms of Transcriptional Repression by Histone Lysine Methylation | journal = The International Journal of Developmental Biology | volume = 10 | issue = 1387 | pages = 335–354 | location = Basel | date = 28 April 2009 | issn =1696-3547}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Acetylation]] - by [[Histone acetyltransferase|HAT]] (histone acetyl transferase); deacetylation - by [[HDAC]] (histone deacetylase)
Acetylation tends to define the ‘openness’ of [[chromatin]] as acetylated histones cannot pack as well together as deacetylated histones.
*[[Phosphorylation]]
*[[Ubiquitination]]
However, there are many more histone modifications, and sensitive [[mass spectrometry]] approaches have recently greatly expanded the catalog.&lt;ref name="pmid21925322"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tan M, Luo H, Lee S, Jin F, Yang JS, Montellier E, Buchou T, Cheng Z, Rousseaux S, Rajagopal N, Lu Z, Ye Z, Zhu Q, Wysocka J, Ye Y, Khochbin S, Ren B, Zhao Y | title = Identification of 67 histone marks and histone lysine crotonylation as a new type of histone modification | journal = Cell | volume = 146 | issue = 6 | pages = 1016–28 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21925322 | pmc = 3176443 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2011.08.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Histone code'' hypothesis====
The ''[[histone code]]'' is a hypothesis that the transcription of genetic information encoded in DNA is in part regulated by chemical modifications to histone proteins, primarily on their unstructured ends.  Together with similar modifications such as [[DNA methylation]] it is part of the [[epigenetic code]].

Cumulative evidence suggests that such code is written by specific enzymes which can (for example) methylate or acetylate DNA ('writers'), removed by other enzymes having demethylase or deacetylase activity ('erasers'), and finally readily identified by proteins (‘readers’) that are recruited to such histone modifications and bind via specific domains, e.g., bromodomain, chromodomain. These triple action of ‘writing’, ‘reading’ and ‘erasing’ establish the favorable local environment for transcriptional regulation, DNA-damage repair, etc.&lt;ref name="Jenuwein"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jenuwein T, Allis CD | title = Translating the histone code | journal = Science | volume = 293 | issue = 5532 | pages = 1074–80 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 11498575 | doi = 10.1126/science.1063127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The critical concept of the '''histone code hypothesis''' is that the histone modifications serve to recruit other proteins by specific recognition of the modified histone via [[protein domain]]s specialized for such purposes, rather than through simply stabilizing or destabilizing the interaction between histone and the underlying DNA. These recruited proteins then act to alter chromatin structure actively or to promote transcription.

A very basic summary of the histone code for gene expression status is given below (histone nomenclature is described [[histone#Chromatin regulation|here]]):

===ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling===
[[File:Luong LD SA F2.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Chromatin remodeling complexes in the dynamic regulation of transcription: In the presence of acetylated histones (HAT mediated) and absence of methylase (HMT) activity, chromatin is loosely packaged. Additional nucleosome repositioning by chromatin remodeler complex, SWI/SNF opens up DNA region where transcription machineray proteins, like RNA Pol II, transcription factors and co-activators bind to turn on gene transcription. In the absence of SWI/SNF, nucleosomes can not move farther and remain tightly aligned to one another. Additional methylation by HMT and deacetylation by HDAC proteins condenses DNA around histones and thus, make DNA unavailable for binding by RNA Pol II and other activators, leading to gene silencing.]]  
ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes regulate gene expression by either moving, ejecting or restructuring nucleosomes. These protein complexes have a common ATPase domain and energy from the hydrolysis of ATP allows these remodeling complexes to reposition (slide, twist or loop) nucleosomes along the DNA, expel histones away from DNA or facilitate exchange of histone variants, and thus creating nucleosome-free regions of DNA for gene activation.&lt;ref name="Wang_2007_2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang GG, Allis CD, Chi P | title = Chromatin remodeling and cancer, Part II: ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling | journal = Trends in Molecular Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 9 | pages = 373–80 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17822959 | doi = 10.1016/j.molmed.2007.07.004 | pmc = 4337864 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, several remodelers have DNA-translocation activity to carry out specific remodeling tasks.&lt;ref name="Saha_2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saha A, Wittmeyer J, Cairns BR | title = Chromatin remodelling: the industrial revolution of DNA around histones | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 437–47 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16723979 | doi = 10.1038/nrm1945 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Known chromatin remodeling complexes====
There are at least five families of chromatin remodelers in eukaryotes: [[SWI/SNF]], [[ISWI]], [[Mi-2/NuRD complex|NuRD]]/Mi-2/CHD, INO80 and SWR1 with first two remodelers being very well studied so far, especially in the yeast model.  Although all of remodelers share common ATPase domain, their functions are specific based on several biological processes (DNA repair, apoptosis, etc.). This is due to the fact that each remodeler complex has unique protein domains ([[Helicase]], [[bromodomain]], etc.) in their catalytic ATPase region and also has different recruited subunits.

====Specific functions====
* Several in-vitro experiments suggest that ISWI remodelers organize nucleosome into proper bundle form and create equal spacing between nucleosomes, whereas SWI/SNF remodelers disorder nucleosomes.
* The ISWI-family remodelers have been shown to play central roles in chromatin assembly after DNA replication and maintenance of higher-order chromatin structures.
* INO80 and SWI/SNF-family remodelers participate in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and nucleotide-excision repair (NER) and thereby plays crucial role in TP53 mediated DNA-damage response.
* NuRD/Mi-2/CHD remodeling complexes primarily mediate transcriptional repression in the nucleus and are required for the maintenance of pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.&lt;ref name="Wang_2007_2"/&gt;

==Significance==

===In normal biological processes===
Chromatin remodeling plays a central role in the regulation of gene expression by providing the transcription machinery with dynamic access to an otherwise tightly packaged genome. Further, nucleosome movement by chromatin remodelers is essential to several important biological processes, including chromosome assembly and segregation, DNA replication and repair, embryonic development and pluripotency, and cell-cycle progression. Deregulation of chromatin remodeling causes loss of transcriptional regulation at these critical check-points required for proper cellular functions, and thus causes various disease syndromes, including cancer.

===Response to DNA damage===

Chromatin relaxation is one of the earliest cellular responses to DNA damage.&lt;ref name=Sellou&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sellou H, Lebeaupin T, Chapuis C, Smith R, Hegele A, Singh HR, Kozlowski M, Bultmann S, Ladurner AG, Timinszky G, Huet S |title=The poly(ADP-ribose)-dependent chromatin remodeler Alc1 induces local chromatin relaxation upon DNA damage |journal=Mol.

Chem. |volume=283 |issue=2 |pages=1197–208 |year=2008 |pmid=18025084 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M706734200 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is quickly followed by accumulation of chromatin remodeler [[CHD1L|Alc1]], which has an [[Adenosine diphosphate ribose|ADP-ribose]]–binding domain, allowing it to be quickly attracted to the product of PARP1.  The maximum recruitment of Alc1 occurs within 10 seconds of DNA damage.&lt;ref name=Sellou /&gt;  About half of the maximum chromatin relaxation, presumably due to action of Alc1, occurs by 10 seconds.&lt;ref name=Sellou /&gt;  PARP1 action at the site of a double-strand break allows recruitment of the two DNA repair enzymes [[MRE11A|MRE11]] and [[Nibrin|NBS1]].  Half maximum recruitment of these two DNA repair enzymes takes 13 seconds for MRE11 and 28 seconds for NBS1.&lt;ref name=Haince /&gt;

Another process of chromatin relaxation, after formation of a DNA double-strand break, employs γH2AX, the phosphorylated form of the [[H2AFX|H2AX]] protein.  The [[histone]] variant H2AX constitutes about 10% of the H2A histones in human chromatin.&lt;ref name="Rogakou 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rogakou EP, Pilch DR, Orr AH, Ivanova VS, Bonner WM |title=DNA double-stranded breaks induce histone H2AX phosphorylation on serine 139 |journal=J.

The fast initial chromatin relaxation upon DNA damage (with rapid initiation of DNA repair) is followed by a slow recondensation, with chromatin recovering a compaction state close to its predamage level in ∼ 20 min.&lt;ref name=Sellou /&gt;

===Cancer===
Chromatin remodeling provides fine-tuning at crucial cell growth and division steps, like cell-cycle progression, DNA repair and chromosome segregation, and therefore exerts tumor-suppressor function. Mutations in such chromatin remodelers and deregulated covalent histone modifications potentially favor self-sufficiency in cell growth and escape from growth-regulatory cell signals - two important hallmarks of [[cancer]].&lt;ref name="Hanahan2000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanahan D, Weinberg RA | title = The hallmarks of cancer | journal = Cell | volume = 100 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–70 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10647931 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81683-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Inactivating mutations in  [[SMARCB1]], formerly known as hSNF5/INI1 and a component of the human [[SWI/SNF]] remodeling complex have been found in large number of [[Malignant rhabdoid tumour|rhabdoid tumors]], commonly affecting pediatric population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Versteege I, Sévenet N, Lange J, Rousseau-Merck MF, Ambros P, Handgretinger R, Aurias A, Delattre O | title = Truncating mutations of hSNF5/INI1 in aggressive paediatric cancer | journal = Nature | volume = 394 | issue = 6689 | pages = 203–6 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9671307 | doi = 10.1038/28212 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar mutations are also present in other childhood cancers, such as [[choroid plexus carcinoma]], [[medulloblastoma]] and in some acute leukemias. Further, mouse knock-out studies strongly support SMARCB1 as a tumor suppressor protein.

* Further, HATs have diverse role as transcription factors beside having histone acetylase activity, e.g., HAT subunit, hADA3 may act as an adaptor protein linking transcription factors with other HAT complexes.  In the absence of hADA3, TP53 transcriptional activity is significantly reduced, suggesting role of hADA3 in activating TP53 function in response to DNA-damage.
* Similarly, TRRAP, the human homolog to yeast Tra1, has been shown to directly interact with c-Myc and E2F1 - known oncoproteins.

====Cancer genomics====
Rapid advance in [[Oncogenomics|cancer genomics]] and high-throughput [[ChIP-chip]], [[ChIP-Seq]] and [[Bisulfite sequencing]] methods are providing more insight into role of chromatin remodeling in transcriptional regulation and role in cancer.

====Therapeutic intervention====
Epigenetic instability caused by deregulation in chromatin remodeling is studied in several cancers, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer. Such instability largely cause widespread silencing of genes with primary impact on tumor-suppressor genes. Hence, strategies are now being tried to overcome epigenetic silencing with synergistic combination of [[HDAC inhibitors|HDAC inhibitors or HDI]] and [[DNA demethylation|DNA-demethylating agents]].
HDIs are primarily used as adjunct therapy in several cancer types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marks PA, Dokmanovic M | title = Histone deacetylase inhibitors: discovery and development as anticancer agents | journal = Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs | volume = 14 | issue = 12 | pages = 1497–511 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16307490 | doi = 10.1517/13543784.14.12.1497 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richon_2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Richon VM, O'Brien JP | title = Histone deacetylase inhibitors: a new class of potential therapeutic agents for cancer treatment | journal = Clinical Cancer Research | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 662–4 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11895892 | url = http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/8/3/662.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; HDAC inhibitors can induce [[p21]] (WAF1) expression, a regulator of [[p53]]'s [[tumor suppressor gene|tumor suppressor]]activity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19392">'''Computational neurogenetic modeling (CNGM)''' is concerned with the study and development of dynamic [[neuronal modeling|neuronal models]] for modeling brain functions with respect to [[gene]]s and dynamic interactions between genes. These include [[neural network models]] and their integration with gene network models. This area brings together knowledge from various scientific disciplines, such as [[computer science|computer]] and [[information science]], [[neuroscience]] and [[cognitive science]], [[genetics]] and [[molecular biology]], as well as [[engineering]].

== Levels of processing ==

=== Molecular kinetics ===
Models of the [[Chemical kinetics|kinetics]] of proteins and [[ion channels]] associated with [[neuron]] activity represent the lowest level of modeling in a computational neurogenetic model. The altered activity of proteins in some diseases, such as the [[amyloid beta]] protein in [[Alzheimer's disease]], must be modeled at the molecular level to accurately predict the effect on cognition.&lt;ref name = pCNGM_AD &gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Kasabov | last2 = Schliebs | last3 = Kojima | first1 = Nikola K. | first2 = Reinhard | first3 = Hiroshi | title = Probabilistic Computational Neurogenetic Modeling: From Cognitive Systems to Alzheimer's Disease | journal = IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development | date = 2011 | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 300–311 | doi = 10.1109/tamd.2011.2159839 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ion channels, which are vital to the propagation of [[action potentials]], are another molecule that may be modeled to more accurately reflect biological processes. For instance, to accurately model [[synaptic plasticity]] (the strengthening or weakening of [[synapse]]s) and memory, it is necessary to model the activity of the [[NMDA receptor]] (NMDAR). The speed at which the NMDA receptor lets Calcium ions into the cell in response to [[Glutamate]] is an important determinant of [[Long-term potentiation]] via the insertion of [[AMPA receptor]]s (AMPAR) into the [[plasma membrane]] at the synapse of the postsynaptic cell (the cell that receives the neurotransmitters from the presynaptic cell).&lt;ref name = book /&gt;

=== Genetic regulatory network ===
[[Image:WagnerModel.png|thumb|right|An example of a [[Wagner's gene network model|model]] of a gene network. The genes, ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; through ''G''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, are modified by either inhibitory signals, represented by bars and negative coefficients, or excitatory signals, represented by arrows and positive coefficients. The interactions are represented numerically by the matrix on the right, '''R'''.]]
In most models of neural systems neurons are the most basic unit modeled.&lt;ref name = book /&gt; In computational neurogenetic modeling, to better simulate processes that are responsible for synaptic activity and connectivity, the genes responsible are modeled for each [[neuron]].

A [[gene regulatory network]], protein regulatory network, or gene/protein regulatory network, is the level of processing in a computational neurogenetic model that models the interactions of [[gene]]s and proteins relevant to synaptic activity and general cell functions. Genes and proteins are modeled as individual [[Node (graph theory)|nodes]], and the interactions that influence a gene are modeled as excitatory (increases gene/protein expression) or inhibitory (decreases gene/protein expression) inputs that are weighted to reflect the effect a gene or protein is having on another gene or protein. Gene regulatory networks are typically designed using data from [[DNA microarrays|microarrays]].&lt;ref name = book /&gt;

Modeling of genes and proteins allows individual responses of neurons in an artificial neural network that mimic responses in biological nervous systems, such as division (adding new neurons to the artificial neural network), creation of proteins to expand their cell membrane and foster [[neurite]] outgrowth (and thus stronger connections with other neurons), up-regulate or down-regulate receptors at synapses (increasing or decreasing the weight (strength) of synaptic inputs), uptake more [[neurotransmitters]], change into different types of neurons, or die due to [[necrosis]] or [[apoptosis]]. The creation and analysis of these networks can be divided into two sub-areas of research: the 
gene up-regulation that is involved in the normal functions of a neuron, such as growth, metabolism, and synapsing; and the effects of mutated genes on neurons and cognitive functions.&lt;ref name = gene&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benuskova | first1 = L. | last2 = Kasabov | first2 = N. | year = 2008 | title = Modeling brain dynamics using computational neurogenetic approach | url = | journal = Cognitive Neurodynamics | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 319–334 | doi = 10.1007/s11571-008-9061-1 | pmc = 2585617 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Artificial neural network ===
[[Image:artificial neuron.png|thumb|right|A [[Artificial neuron|model]] of an individual neuron. The inputs, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, are modified by the input weights, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, and then combined into one input, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;. The transfer function, &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, then uses this input to determine the output, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
An [[artificial neural network]] generally refers to any computational model that mimics the [[central nervous system]], with capabilities such as learning and pattern recognition. With regards to computational neurogenetic modeling, however, it is often used to refer to those specifically designed for biological accuracy rather than computational efficiency. Individual neurons are the basic unit of an artificial neural network, with each neuron acting as a node. Each node receives weighted signals from other nodes that are either [[excitatory postsynaptic potential|excitatory]] or [[Inhibitory postsynaptic potential|inhibitory]]. To determine the output, a [[transfer function]] (or [[activation function]]) evaluates the sum of the weighted signals and, in some artificial neural networks, their input rate. Signal weights are strengthened ([[long-term potentiation]]) or weakened ([[long-term depression]]) depending on how synchronous the presynaptic and postsynaptic activation rates are ([[Hebbian theory]]).&lt;ref name = book /&gt;

The synaptic activity of individual neurons is modeled using equations to determine the temporal (and in some 
cases, spatial) summation of synaptic signals, [[membrane potential]], threshold for action potential 
generation, the absolute and relative [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]], and optionally ion receptor channel [[Chemical kinetics|kinetics]] and [[Gaussian noise]] (to increase biological accuracy by incorporation of random elements). In addition to connectivity, some types of artificial neural networks, such as [[spiking neural network]]s, also model the distance between neurons, and its effect on the synaptic weight (the strength of a synaptic transmission).&lt;ref name=CN_sum /&gt;

=== Combining gene regulatory networks and artificial neural networks ===
For the parameters in the gene regulatory network to affect the neurons in the artificial neural network as intended there must be some connection between them. In an organizational context, each node (neuron) in the artificial neural network has its own gene regulatory network associated with it. The weights (and in some networks, frequencies of synaptic transmission to the node), and the resulting membrane potential of the node (including whether an [[action potential]] is produced or not), affect the expression of different genes in the gene regulatory network. Factors affecting connections between neurons, such as [[synaptic plasticity]], can be modeled by inputting the values of synaptic activity-associated genes and proteins to a function that re-evaluates the weight of an input from a particular neuron in the artificial neural network.

=== Incorporation of other cell types ===
Other cell types besides neurons can be modeled as well. [[Glial cells]], such as [[astroglia]] and [[microglia]], as well as [[endothelial cells]], could be included in an artificial neural network. This would enable modeling of diseases where pathological effects may occur from sources other than neurons, such as Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name = pCNGM_AD /&gt;

== Factors affecting choice of artificial neural network ==
While the term artificial neural network is usually used in computational neurogenetic modeling to refer to models of the central nervous system meant to possess biological accuracy, the general use of the term can be applied to many gene regulatory networks as well.

=== Time variance ===
Artificial neural networks, depending on type, may or may not take into account the timing of inputs. Those that do, such as [[spiking neural network]]s, fire only when the pooled inputs reach a membrane potential is reached. Because this mimics the firing of biological neurons, spiking neural networks are viewed as a more biologically accurate model of synaptic activity.&lt;ref name = book /&gt;

=== Growth and shrinkage ===
To accurately model the central nervous system, creation and death of neurons should be modeled as well.&lt;ref name = book /&gt; To accomplish this, constructive artificial neural networks that are able to grow or shrink to adapt to inputs are often used. [[Evolving classification function|Evolving connectionist systems]] are a subtype of constructive artificial neural networks ([[Evolving classification function|evolving]] in this case referring to changing the structure of its neural network rather than [[Evolutionary computation|by mutation and natural selection]]).&lt;ref name = ECoS /&gt;

=== Randomness ===
Both synaptic transmission and gene-protein interactions are [[Stochastic process|stochastic]] in nature. To model biological nervous systems with greater fidelity some form of randomness is often introduced into the network. Artificial neural networks modified in this manner are often labeled as probabilistic versions of their neural network sub-type (e.g., p[[spiking neural network|SNN]]).&lt;ref name = pSNN&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kasabov | first1 = N. | last2 = Schliebs | first2 = S. | last3 = Mohemmed | first3 = A. | year = 2012 | title = Modelling the Effect of Genes on the Dynamics of Probabilistic Spiking Neural Networks for Computational Neurogenetic Modelling | url = | journal = Computational Intelligence Methods for Bioinformatics and Biostatistics | volume = 7548 | issue = | pages = 1–9 | doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-35686-5_1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Incorporation of fuzzy logic ===
[[Fuzzy logic]] is a system of reasoning that enables an artificial neural network to deal in non-[[Binary data|binary]] and linguistic variables. Biological data is often unable to be processed using [[Boolean logic]], and moreover accurate modeling of the capabilities of biological nervous systems requires fuzzy logic. Therefore, artificial neural networks that incorporate it, such as [[Evolving classification function|evolving fuzzy neural networks (EFuNN) or Dynamic Evolving Neural-Fuzzy Inference Systems (DENFIS)]], are often used in computational neurogenetic modeling. The use of fuzzy logic is especially relevant in gene regulatory networks, as the modeling of protein binding strength often requires non-binary variables.&lt;ref name = book /&gt;&lt;ref name = ECoS&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watts | first1 = Michael J | year = 2009 | title = A Decade of Kasabov's Evolving Connectionist Systems: A Review | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, And Cybernetics—Part C: Applications and Reviews | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 253–269 | doi = 10.1109/TSMCC.2008.2012254 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of learning ===
Artificial Neural Networks designed to simulate of the human brain require an ability to learn a variety of tasks that is not required by those designed to accomplish a specific task. [[Supervised learning]] is a mechanism by which an artificial neural network can learn by receiving a number of inputs with a correct output already known. An example of an artificial neural network that uses supervised learning is a [[multilayer perceptron]] (MLP). In [[unsupervised learning]], an artificial neural network is trained using only inputs. Unsupervised learning is the learning mechanism by which a type of artificial neural network known as a [[self-organizing map]] (SOM) learns. Some types of artificial neural network, such as evolving connectionist systems, can learn in both a supervised and unsupervised manner.&lt;ref name = book /&gt;

== Improvement ==
Both gene regulatory networks and artificial neural networks have two main strategies for improving their accuracy. In both cases the output of the network is measured against known biological data using some function, and subsequent improvements are made by altering the structure of the network. A common test of accuracy for artificial neural networks is to compare some parameter of the model to data acquired from biological neural systems, such as from an [[EEG]].&lt;ref name = EEG&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Benuskova | first1 = L. | last2 = Wysoski | first2 = S. G. | last3 = Kasabov | first3 = N. | pages = 4638–4644 | title = Computational Neurogenetic Modeling: A Methodology to Study Gene Interactions Underlying Neural Oscillations | conference = 2006 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks | doi = 10.1109/IJCNN.2006.1716743 | location = Vancouver, BC }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of EEG recordings, the [[local field potential]] (LFP) of the artificial neural network is taken and compared to EEG data acquired from human patients. The [[relative intensity ratios|relative intensity ratio]] (RIRs) and [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) of the EEG are compared with those generated by the artificial neural networks to determine the accuracy of the model.&lt;ref name = FFT&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Kasabov | first1 = N. | last2 = Benuskova | first2 = L. | last3 = Wysoski | first3 = S.

=== Genetic algorithm ===
[[File:A-Numerical-Approach-to-Ion-Channel-Modelling-Using-Whole-Cell-Voltage-Clamp-Recordings-and-a-pcbi.0030169.sv001.ogv|thumb|right|An example of a model being refined through successive generations, using a genetic algorithm, to match experimental data.]]
Because the amount of data on the interplay of genes and neurons and their effects is not enough to construct a rigorous model, 
[[evolutionary computation]] is used to optimize artificial neural networks and gene regulatory networks, a common technique being the [[genetic algorithm]]. A genetic algorithm is a process that can be used to refine models by mimicking the process of natural selection observed in biological ecosystems. The primary advantages are that, due to not requiring derivative information, it can be applied to [[black box]] problems and [[Evolutionary multimodal optimization|multimodal optimization]]. The typical process for using genetic algorithms to refine a gene 
regulatory network is: first, create a population; next, to create offspring via a crossover operation and 
evaluate their fitness; then, on a group chosen for high fitness, simulate mutation via a mutation operator; 
finally, taking the now mutated group, repeat this process until a desired level of fitness is demonstrated.

=== Evolving systems ===
Methods by which artificial neural networks may alter their structure without simulated mutation and fitness selection have been developed. A [[Evolving classification function|dynamically evolving neural network]] is one approach, as the creation of new connections and new neurons can 
be modeled as the system adapts to new data. This enables the network to evolve in modeling accuracy without simulated natural selection. One method by which dynamically evolving networks may be optimized, called evolving layer neuron aggregation, combines neurons with sufficiently similar input weights into one neuron. This can take place during the training of the network, referred to as online aggregation, or between periods of training, referred to as offline aggregation. Experiments have suggested that offline aggregation is more efficient.&lt;ref name = ECoS /&gt;

The simulation of disease states is of particular interest, as modeling both the neurons and their genes and proteins allows linking genetic mutations and protein abnormalities to pathological effects in the central nervous system. Among those diseases suggested as being possible targets of computational neurogenetic modeling based analysis are epilepsy, schizophrenia, mental retardation, brain aging and Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref name = book&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Benuskova | last2 = Kasabov | first1 = Lubica | first2 = Nikola | date = 2007 | title = Computational Neurogenetic Modeling | location = New York | publisher = Springer | ISBN = 0-387-48353-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[education]], '''computational thinking''' is a set of [[problem-solving]] methods that involve expressing problems and their solutions in ways that a [[computer]] could execute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Computational Thinking Benefits Society| journal = 40th Anniversary Blog of Social Issues in Computing |  year = 2014| last1 = Wing | first1 = Jeannette| url = http://socialissues.cs.toronto.edu/index.html%3Fp=279.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The history of computational thinking dates back at least to the 1950s but most ideas are much older.&lt;ref name="Tedre2016"&gt;{{Cite book | title =Proceedings  of the 16th Koli Calling Conference on Computing Education Research| chapter = The Long Quest for Computational Thinking| year = 2016| last1 = Tedre | first1 = Matti| last2 = Denning | first2 = Peter J.| url = http://denninginstitute.com/pjd/PUBS/long-quest-ct.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''computational thinking'' was first used by [[Seymour Papert]] in 1980&lt;ref&gt;Papert, Seymour. Mindstorms: Children, computers, and powerful ideas. Basic Books, Inc., 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00191473| title = An exploration in the space of mathematics educations| journal = International Journal of Computers for Mathematical Learning| volume = 1| year = 1996| last1 = Papert | first1 = Seymour| authorlink1 = Seymour Papert| url = http://www.papert.org/articles/AnExplorationintheSpaceofMathematicsEducations.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computational thinking can be used to [[algorithm]]ically solve complicated problems of scale, and is often used to realize large improvements in efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Computational thinking:

The phrase ''computational thinking'' was brought to the forefront of the [[computer science]] community as a result of an [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] Communications essay on the subject by [[Jeannette Wing]]. The essay suggested that thinking computationally was a fundamental skill for everyone, not just computer scientists, and argued for the importance of integrating computational ideas into other disciplines.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1145/1118178.1118215| title = Computational thinking| journal = [[Communications of the ACM]]| volume = 49| issue = 3| pages = 33| year = 2006| url = https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15110-s13/Wing06-ct.pdf| last1 = Wing | first1 = Jeanette M. | authorlink = Jeannette Wing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

The characteristics that define computational thinking are [[decomposition (computer science)|decomposition]], [[pattern recognition]] / [[data representation]], [[generalization]]/[[abstraction]], and [[algorithm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to computational thinking|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zp92mp3/|website=BBC Bitesize|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploring Computational Thinking|url=https://www.google.com/edu/resources/programs/exploring-computational-thinking/|website=Google for Education|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By decomposing a problem, identifying the variables involved using data representation, and creating algorithms, a generic solution results. The generic solution is a generalization or abstraction that can be used to solve a multitude of variations of the initial problem.

[[File:The Computational Thinking Process.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|The "three As" Computational Thinking Process describes computational thinking as a set of three steps: abstraction, automation, and analysis.]]

Another characterization of computational thinking is the "three As" iterative process based on three stages:
# '''Abstraction''': Problem formulation;
# '''Automation''': Solution expression;
# '''Analyses''': Solution execution and evaluation.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Connection to the "four Cs" ===

The [[four Cs of 21st century learning]] are communication, critical thinking, collaboration, and creativity. The fifth C could be computational thinking which entails the capability to resolve problems algorithmically and logically. It includes tools that produce models and visualize data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.educationdive.com/news/should-the-4-cs-of-21st-century-skills-make-room-for-one-more/517878/|title=Should the 4 Cs of 21st century skills make room for one more?|work=Education Dive|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computational thinking is applicable across subjects beyond science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) which include the social sciences and language arts. Students can engage in activities where they identify patterns in grammar as well as sentence structure and use models for studying relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://educationworld.in//EWIssue.aspx|title=http://educationworld.in//EWIssue.aspx|website=EducationWorld.in|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}} {{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, the 4 Cs have gradually gained acceptance as vital elements of many school syllabi. This development triggered a modification in platforms and directions such as inquiry, project-based, and more profound learning across all K-12 levels. Many countries have introduced computer thinking to all students. The United Kingdom has CT in its national curriculum since 2012. Singapore calls CT as “national capability”. Other nations like Australia, China, Korea, and New Zealand embarked on massive efforts to introduce computational thinking in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-02-25-the-5th-c-of-21st-century-skills-try-computational-thinking-not-coding|title=The 5th ‘C’ of 21st Century Skills? Try Computational Thinking (Not Coding) - EdSurge News|date=2018-02-25|work=EdSurge|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, President Barack Obama created this program, Computer Science for All to empower this generation of students in America with the proper computer science proficiency required to flourish in a digital economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.csforall.org/|title=CSforALL|website=csforall.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computational thinking means thinking or solving problems like computer scientists. CT refers to thought processes required in understanding problems and formulating solutions. CT involves logic, assessment, patterns, automation, and generalization. Career readiness can be integrated into learning and teaching environments in multiple ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eschoolnews.com/2017/10/25/future-5th-c-career-readiness/|title=Future-forward: How to incorporate the 5th ‘C’ of 21st Century learning|date=2017-10-25|work=eSchool News|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In K-12 education ==

Jeannette Wing envisioned computational thinking becoming an essential part of every child's education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, since her article (published in 2006) integrating computational thinking into the K-12 curriculum has faced several challenges including the agreement on the definition of computational thinking.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barr|first=Valerie|last2=Stephenson|first2=Chris|year=2011|title=Bringing computational thinking to K-12: what is Involved and what is the role of the computer science education community?|journal=Acm Inroads|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grover|first=Shuchi|last2=Pea|first2=Roy|year=2013|title=Computational Thinking in K–12 A Review of the State of the Field|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=42|doi=10.3102/0013189x12463051}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, computational thinking is broadly defined as a set of cognitive skills and problem solving processes that include (but are not limited to) the following characteristics:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stephenson|first=Chris|date=May 2011|title=Defining Computational Thinking for K-12|journal=CSTA Voice|volume=7|issue=2|pages=3–4|issn=1555-2128|quote=CT is a problem solving process...|author2=Valerie Barr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Using abstractions and pattern recognition to represent the problem in new and different ways
* Logically organizing and analyzing data
* Breaking the problem down into smaller parts 
* Approaching the problem using programmatic thinking techniques such as iteration, symbolic representation, and logical operations
* Reformulating the problem into a series of ordered steps (algorithmic thinking)
* Identifying, analyzing, and implementing possible solutions with the goal of achieving the most efficient and effective combination of steps and resources
* Generalizing this problem-solving process to a wide variety of problems

Current integration computational thinking into the K-12 curriculum comes in two forms: in computer science classes directly or through the use and measure of computational thinking techniques in other subjects. Teachers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics ([[STEM fields|STEM]]) focused classrooms that include computational thinking, allow students to practice [[Problem solving|problem-solving]] skills such as [[trial and error]] (Barr, et al., 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barr|first1=David|last2=Harrison|first2=John|last3=Leslie|first3=Conery|title=Computational Thinking: A Digital Age Skill for Everyone|journal=Learning &amp; Leading with Technology|date=2011-03-01|volume=38|issue=6|pages=20–23|issn=0278-9175}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valerie Barr]] and Chris Stephenson describe computational thinking patterns across disciplines in a 2011 [http://inroads.acm.org ACM Inroads] article&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However [[Conrad Wolfram]] has argued that computational thinking should be taught as a distinct subject.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/computational-thinking-code-success Computational thinking is the code to success] Conrad Wolfram, The Times Educational Supplement&lt;/ref&gt;

== Center for Computational Thinking ==

[[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]] has a Center for Computational Thinking. The Center's major activity is conducting PROBEs or '''PROB'''lem-oriented '''E'''xplorations. These PROBEs are experiments that apply novel computing concepts to problems to show the value of computational thinking. A PROBE experiment is generally a collaboration between a computer scientist and an expert in the field to be studied. The experiment typically runs for a year. In general, a PROBE will seek to find a solution for a broadly applicable problem and avoid narrowly focused issues. Some examples of PROBE experiments are optimal kidney transplant logistics and how to create drugs that do not breed drug-resistant viruses.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~CompThink/probes.html PROBE Experiments]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computational thinking resources ==

There are a handful of on-line institutions which provide curriculum, and other related resources to build and strengthen pre-college students with computational thinking, analysis and problem-solving. One prominent one is the [http://www.education.rec.ri.cmu.edu Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy]. It offers training sessions for both pre-college students, as well as teachers. CMU's programs exercise [[instructional scaffolding]] methods via [[engineering process]]. There is also another online site named [http://www.legoengineering.com legoengineering.com].&lt;ref name="LEGO Engineering"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legoengineering.com|title=LEGO Engineering|accessdate=30 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; offering similar resources.

As far as a physical facility, in Central New Jersey, there is a small institution, named [[Storming Robots]], offering technology programs to Grade 4 to 12 with an emphasis on algorithmic and computational thinking via robotics projects throughout the school year. Students may follow its road map&lt;ref name="Storming Robots"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stormingrobots.com/prod/roboclub.html#descRoadmap|title=Roadmap for learning path|accessdate=30 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; starting from Grade 4 until they graduate to college.

Designed to increase the use of computational thinking, [http://www.computationalthinking.org computationalthinking.org]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computationalthinking.org|title=Computational Thinking|accessdate=2 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched to provide problem-solving resources to various sectors in an effort to increase the use of computational thinking. The resources include ready-made courses and materials for professionals, colleges, schools, and students. The services also include advising policymakers and governments on education reform and curriculum development.

== Criticism ==

The concept of computational thinking has been criticized as too vague, as it's rarely made clear how it is different from other forms of thought.&lt;ref name="Tedre2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.csteachers.org/resource/resmgr/JonesCTOnePager.pdf|title=The Trouble with Computational Thinking|date=|website=|publisher=ACM|last1=Jones|first1=Elizabeth|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some computer scientists worry about the promotion of computational thinking as a substitute for a broader computer science education, as computational thinking represents just one small part of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Denning|first1=Peter J.|title=Beyond computational thinking|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1 June 2009|volume=52|issue=6|pages=28|doi=10.1145/1516046.1516054}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others worry that the emphasis on Computational Thinking encourages computer scientists to think too narrowly about the problems they can solve, thus avoiding the social, ethical and environmental implications of the technology they create.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Easterbrook|first1=Steve|title=From Computational Thinking to Systems Thinking: A conceptual toolkit for sustainability computing|journal=Proceedings of the 2nd international conference ICT for Sustainability|date=2014|doi=10.2991/ict4s-14.2014.28|url=http://www.atlantis-press.com/php/pub.php?publication=ict4s-14&amp;frame=http%3A//www.atlantis-press.com/php/paper-details.php%3Fid%3D13446}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tedre2016"/&gt;

Of unknown origins, there are multiple variations.&lt;ref name=folkinfo1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folkinfo.org/songs/displaysong.php?songid=455 |title=Folkinfo - Marrowbones |format= |work= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309084416/http://www.folkinfo.org/songs/displaysong.php?songid=455 |archivedate=2012-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most well known variations are "The Old Woman From Boston"&lt;ref name="CazdenHaufrecht1982"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Norman Cazden|author2=Herbert Haufrecht|author3=Norman Studer|title=Folk Songs of the Catskills|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FbTOKRGC3SIC&amp;pg=PA519|accessdate=12 August 2012|year=1982|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-87395-580-5|pages=519–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Rich Old Lady".&lt;ref name="Reed1958"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Hugh Reed|title=American Record Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PFUfAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=12 August 2012|volume=25|year=1958|publisher=Helen Dwight Reid Educational Foundation|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other versions include "The Aul' Man and the Churnstaff", and "Woman from Yorkshire." In [[Scotland]] it is known as "The Wily Auld Carle" or "The Wife of Kelso."  In [[Ireland]] there are variations called "The Old Woman of Wexford" and "Tigaree Torum Orum."  In England the song is widely known as "Marrowbones".

"A similar song,  "Johnny Sands" (Roud 184), was written by John Sinclair  about 1840 and also became popular with local singers."
&lt;ref name=folkinfo1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Newpenguin" /&gt; In this version the husband pretends to be tired of life, and asks his wife to tie his hands behind his back.

Herbert Hughes writes that the song is English in origin.&lt;ref name="Hughes1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Herbert Hughes|title=Irish country songs: highlights edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SjoJAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=12 August 2012|year=1995|publisher=Boosey &amp; Hawkes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The song concerns an old woman who, in one popular version, loves "her husband dearly, but another man twice as well."  She resolves to kill him, and is advised by a local doctor that feeding him eggs and marrowbone will make him blind.  Thus
&lt;blockquote&gt;
She fed him eggs and marrowbone&lt;br&gt;
And made him sup them all&lt;br&gt;
And it wasn't too long before&lt;br&gt;
He couldn't see her at all
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
She then arranges to push him into the river.  He steps aside and she falls in.  Subsequently,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
She cried for help, she screamed for help&lt;br&gt;
And loudly she did bawl&lt;br&gt;
The old man said "I'm so blind&lt;br&gt;
I can't see you at all!"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Despite his blindness, the old man manages to keep her from climbing out of the river by pushing her back in with a pole.  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
She swam around and swam around&lt;br /&gt;
Until she came to the brim&lt;br /&gt;
The old man got the linen prop&lt;br /&gt;
And pushed her further in.&lt;ref name="Newpenguin"&gt;Roud, S, and Bishop, J; The New Penguin Book of English Folk Songs; London, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(A linen prop is a pole used to prevent washing on a line from blowing about too much).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The moral of the song is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now the old woman is dead and gone&lt;br&gt;
And the Devil's got her soul&lt;br&gt;
Wasn't she a gosh-darn fool&lt;br&gt;
That she didn't grab that pole?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Eating eggs and marrowbone&lt;br&gt;
Won't make your old man blind&lt;br&gt;
So if you want to do him in&lt;br&gt;
You must sneak up from behind&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Childhood and family ==
Elizabeth was born in [[Albany, New York]], the second daughter of Continental Army General [[Philip Schuyler]], a [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] general, and Catherine Van Rensselaer Schuyler. The Van Rensselaers of the [[Manor of Rensselaerswyck]] were one of the richest and most politically influential families in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]]. She had seven siblings who lived to adulthood, including [[Angelica Schuyler Church]] and [[Margarita "Peggy" Schuyler Van Rensselaer]], and 14 siblings in total.

Her family was among the wealthy Dutch landowners who had settled around Albany in the mid-1600s, and both her mother and father came from wealthy and well-regarded families. Like many landowners of the time, Philip Schuyler owned slaves, and Eliza would have grown up around slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chernow|first1=Ron|title=Alexander Hamilton|date=2004|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the unrest of the [[French and Indian War]], which her father served in and which was fought in part very near her childhood home, Eliza's childhood was spent comfortably, learning to read and sew from her mother.

Like most Dutch families of the area, her family belonged to the [[First Church in Albany (Reformed)|Reformed Dutch Church of Albany]], which still survives, though the original 1715 building where Elizabeth was baptized and attended services was demolished in 1806.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dutch Reformed Church in Albany, New York |url=http://exhibitions.nysm.nysed.gov//albany/drc.html |accessdate=April 22, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425115259/http://exhibitions.nysm.nysed.gov//albany/drc.html |archivedate=April 25, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Church&gt;{{cite web | title = First Church in Albany: Our History | url = http://www.firstchurchinalbany.org/ | publisher = First Church in Albany | accessdate = 2009-04-14 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080916094529/http://www.firstchurchinalbany.org/ | archivedate = September 16, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her upbringing instilled in her a strong and unwavering faith she would retain throughout her life.

When she was a girl, Elizabeth accompanied her father to a meeting of the [[Iroquois Confederacy|Six Nations]] and met [[Benjamin Franklin]] when he stayed briefly with the Schuyler family while traveling.&lt;ref name="Chernow131"&gt;Chernow, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; She was said to have been something of a tomboy when she was young;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Desmond|first1=Alice Curtis|title=Alexander Hamilton's Wife: A Romance of the Hudson|date=1952|publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; throughout her life she retained a strong will and even an impulsiveness that her acquaintances noted. [[James McHenry]], one of Washington's aides alongside her future husband, would say that "Hers was a strong character with its depth and warmth, whether of feeling or temper controlled, but glowing underneath, bursting through at times in some emphatic expression."&lt;ref name="Chernow131"/&gt; Much later, the son of Joanna Bethune, one of the women she worked alongside to found an orphanage later in her life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to the Records of Graham Windham 1804–2011|url=http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/grahamwindham/bioghist.html|accessdate=July 30, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329001854/http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/grahamwindham/bioghist.html|archivedate=March 29, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; remembered that "Both [Elizabeth and Joanna] were of determined disposition ... Mrs. Bethune the more cautious, Mrs. Hamilton the more impulsive."&lt;ref name="Chernow729"&gt;Chernow, p. 729&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
In early 1780, Elizabeth went to stay with her aunt, Gertrude Schuyler Cochran, in [[Morristown, New Jersey]]. There she met [[Alexander Hamilton]], one of General [[George Washington]]'s aides-de-camp, who was stationed along with the General and his men in Morristown for the winter.&lt;ref name="Chernow128"&gt;Chernow, pp. 128–29&lt;/ref&gt; (In fact, they had met previously, if briefly, two years before, when Hamilton dined with the Schuylers on his way back from a negotiation on Washington's behalf.&lt;ref name="Chernow102"&gt;Chernow, pp. 102–103&lt;/ref&gt;) Also while in Morristown, Eliza met and became friends with [[Martha Washington]], a friendship they would maintain throughout their husbands' political careers. Eliza later said of Mrs. Washington, "She was always my ideal of a true woman."&lt;ref name="Chernow131"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baxter1897"&gt;{{cite book|author=Katharine Schuyler Baxter|title=A Godchild of Washington|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LF4SAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA223|year=1897|publisher=F.T. Neely|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between Eliza and Hamilton quickly grew, even after he left Morristown for a short mission to negotiate a prisoners exchange, only a month after Eliza had arrived. He then returned to Morristown where Elizabeth's father had also arrived in his capacity as representative of the Continental Congress and by early April they were officially engaged, with her father's blessing (something of an anomaly for the Schuyler girls—both Angelica and Catherine would end up eloping).&lt;ref name="Chernow136"&gt;Chernow, p. 136; Chernow, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton followed the Army when they decamped in June 1780. In September that year, Eliza learned that [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] [[John André]], head of the British Secret Service, had been captured in a foiled plot concocted by General [[Benedict Arnold]] to surrender the fort of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] to the British. André had once been a houseguest in the [[Schuyler Mansion]] in Albany as a [[prisoner of war]] en route to Pennsylvania in 1775; Eliza, then seventeen, might have had a juvenile crush on the young British officer who had once sketched for her. Hamilton, while jealous of André for his "accomplishments," promised Eliza he would do what he could to treat the British intelligence chief accordingly; he even begged Washington to grant André's last wish of [[execution by firing squad]], but to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Randall|first1=Willard Sterne|title=Alexander Hamilton: A Life|date=2003|publisher=HarpersCollins|location=New York|pages=191–92, 211–14, 215–16, 219}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two more months of separation punctuated by their correspondence, on December 14, 1780, Alexander Hamilton and Elizabeth Schuyler were married at the Schuyler Mansion.&lt;ref name=ny-museum&gt;{{Cite web|title = Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton|url = http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/albany/bios/s/esh.html|website = New York State Museum|accessdate = 2015-09-30|date = 2004-01-01|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150914213035/http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/albany/bios/s/esh.html|archivedate = September 14, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a short honeymoon at the Pastures, Eliza's childhood home, Hamilton returned to military service in early January 1781. Eliza soon joined him at New Windsor, where Washington's army was now stationed, and she rekindled her friendship with Martha Washington as they entertained their husbands' fellow officers.&lt;ref name="Chernow150"&gt;Chernow, pp. 150–51&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, however, Washington and Hamilton had a falling-out, and the newlywed couple relocated first back to Eliza's father's house in Albany, then to a new home across the river from the New Windsor headquarters.&lt;ref name="Chernow154"&gt;Chernow, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; There Eliza busied herself in creating a home for them and in aiding Alexander with his political writings—parts of his thirty-one-page letter to [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]], laying out much of the financial knowledge that was to aid him later in his career, are written in her handwriting.&lt;ref name="Chernow156"&gt;Chernow, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon, however, Eliza would relocate again, this time back to her parents' house in Albany. This possibly coincided with the discovery that she was pregnant with her first child, who would be born the next January and named Philip, for her father. While apart, Alexander wrote her numerous letters telling her not to worry for his safety; in addition, he wrote her concerning confidential military secrets, including the lead-up to the [[Siege of Yorktown|Battle of Yorktown]] that autumn.&lt;ref name="Chernow160"&gt;Chernow, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the war would come close to home, after British soldiers attempted to raid the Pastures. According to some accounts, the family was spared from any harm, thanks to her sister Peggy's quick thinking when she said her father had gone to town to get help, causing the raiders to flee.&lt;ref name="Chernow159"&gt;Chernow, pp. 159–60&lt;/ref&gt;

After Yorktown, Alexander was able to rejoin Eliza in Albany, where they would remain for almost another two years, before moving to New York City in late 1783.&lt;ref name="Chernow185"&gt;Chernow, pp. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier that year, Angelica and her husband [[John Barker Church]], for business reasons, had moved to Europe. Angelica lived abroad for over fourteen years, returning to America for visits in 1785 and 1789.&lt;ref name="Chernow200"&gt;Chernow, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; On September 25, 1784, Eliza gave birth to her second child, Angelica, named after Eliza's older sister.

In 1787, Eliza sat for a portrait, executed by the painter [[Ralph Earl]] while he was being held in debtors' prison. Alexander had heard of Earl's predicament and asked if Eliza might be willing to sit for him, to allow him to make some money and eventually buy his way out of prison, which he subsequently did.&lt;ref name="Chernow206"&gt;Chernow, pp. 206–7&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, she now had three young children (her third, [[Alexander Hamilton Jr.|Alexander]], was born in May 1786) and may have been pregnant at the time with her fourth, [[James Alexander Hamilton|James Alexander]], who would be born the following April.

In addition to their own children, in 1787, Eliza and Alexander took into their home Frances (Fanny) Antill, the two-year-old youngest child of Hamilton's friend Colonel [[Edward Antill (soldier)|Edward Antill]], whose wife had recently died.&lt;ref name=jc-antill&gt;{{cite book |title=Life of Alexander Hamilton: A History of the Republic of the United States of America, as Traced in His Writings and in Those of His Contemporaries |volume=3 |first=John Church |last=Hamilton |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton, Osgood and Company |year=1879 |pages=361–362 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fFUSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA361&amp;dq=%22Colonel+Antil%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Colonel%20Antil%22&amp;f=false |quote=Colonel Antil {{sic}} of the Canadian Corps, a friend of [[Moses Hazen|General Hazen]], retired penniless from the service—his military claims, a sole dependence, being unsatisfied. Hoping to derive subsistence from the culture of a small clearing in the forest, he retired to the wilds of [[Point Au Roche State Park|Hazenburgh]]. His hopes were baffled, and in his distress he applied to Hamilton for relief. His calamities were soon after embittered by the loss of his wife, leaving infant children.

The Hamiltons had an active social life, often attending the theater as well as various balls and parties.

Eliza also continued to aid Alexander throughout his political career, serving as an intermediary between him and his publisher when he was writing ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'',&lt;ref name="Chernow248"&gt;Chernow, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; copying out portions of his defense of the [[First Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]],&lt;ref name="Chernow353"&gt;Chernow, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; and sitting up with him so he could read [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Washington's Farewell Address]] out loud to her as he wrote it.&lt;ref name="Chernow508"&gt;Chernow, p. 508&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, she continued to raise her children (a fifth, John Church Hamilton, had been born in August 1792) and maintain their household throughout multiple moves between New York, Philadelphia, and Albany.

In 1797, an affair came to light that had taken place several years earlier between Hamilton and [[Maria Reynolds]], a young woman who had first approached him for monetary aid in the summer of 1791. Eliza evidently did not believe the charges when they were first leveled against her husband: John Church, her brother-in-law, on July 13, 1797, wrote to Hamilton that "it makes not the least Impression on her, only that she considers the whole Knot of those opposed to you to be [Scoundrels]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To Alexander Hamilton from John B.

Eliza was at the time pregnant with their sixth child. Despite her advanced pregnancy and her previous miscarriage of November 1794, her initial reaction to her husband's disclosure of his past affair was to leave Hamilton in New York and join her parents in Albany where William Stephen was born on August 4, 1797. She only came back to her marital house in New York in early September 1797 because the local doctor had been unable to cure their eldest son Philip, who had accompanied her to Albany and contracted typhus.&lt;ref name= chernow&gt;{{cite book|last=Chernow|first=Ron|title=Alexander Hamilton|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-1-59420-009-0|year=2004}}, chapter "Too near the sun"&lt;/ref&gt; Over time Eliza and Alexander reconciled and remained married, and had two more children together. The first, Elizabeth, named for Eliza, was born on November 20, 1799. Before their eighth child was born, however, they lost their oldest son, Philip, who died in a duel on November 24, 1801. After being shot on the dueling field, Philip was brought to Angelica and John Church's house, where he died, both of his parents next to him.&lt;ref name="Chernow651"&gt;Chernow, pp. 651–54&lt;/ref&gt; Their last child, born the next June in 1802, was named Philip in his honor.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Only two years later, in July 1804, Alexander Hamilton became involved in a similar "affair of honor," which led to his infamous [[Burr-Hamilton Duel|duel with Aaron Burr]] and untimely death. Before the duel, he wrote Eliza two letters, telling her: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The consolations of Religion, my beloved, can alone support you; and these you have a right to enjoy. Fly to the bosom of your God and be comforted. With my last idea; I shall cherish the sweet hope of meeting you in a better world. Adieu best of wives and best of Women.

In the year before the duel, Eliza's mother Catherine had died suddenly,&lt;ref name="Humphreys240"&gt;Humphreys, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; and only a few months after Hamilton's death Eliza's father died as well.

After her husband's death in 1804, Eliza was left to pay Hamilton's debts. [[Hamilton Grange National Memorial|The Grange]], their house on a 35-acre estate in upper Manhattan, was sold at public auction;&lt;ref name=ny-museum/&gt; however, she was later able to repurchase it from Hamilton's executors, who had decided that Eliza could not be publicly dispossessed of her home, and purchased it themselves to sell back to her at half the price.&lt;ref name=pbs-wgbh/&gt;&lt;ref name=landmarks/&gt; In November 1833, at the age of 76, Eliza resold The Grange for $25,000, funding the purchase of a New York townhouse (now called the [[Hamilton-Holly House]]) where she lived for nine years with two of her grown children, [[Alexander Hamilton Jr.]] and [[Eliza Hamilton Holly]], and their spouses.&lt;ref name=landmarks&gt;{{cite web|title=Hamilton-Holly House Designation Report |publisher=Landmarks Preservation Commission |id=LP-2157 |location=New York, NY |date=October 19, 2004 |format=PDF |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/hamiltonholly.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070435/http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/hamiltonholly.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, she left New York for Washington, D.C., where she lived with her widowed daughter Eliza until 1854.

In 1798, Eliza had accepted her friend [[Isabella Graham]]'s invitation to join the descriptively named Society for the Relief of Poor Widows with Small Children that had been established the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boylan|first1=Anne M.|title=The Origins of Women's Activism: New York and Boston, 1797–1840|date=2002|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1806, two years after her husband's death, she, along with several other women including Joanna Bethune, founded the Orphan Asylum Society. Eliza was appointed second directress, or vice-president.&lt;ref name="Boylan111"&gt;Boylan, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; In 1821, she was named first directress, and served for twenty-seven years in this role, until she left New York in 1848.&lt;ref name="Chernow728"&gt;Chernow, pp. 728–730&lt;/ref&gt; By the time she left she had been with the organization continuously since its founding, a total of forty-two years.

'''Elwood Mead''' (January 16, 1858 &amp;ndash; January 26, 1936) was a professor, [[politician]] and [[engineer]], known for heading the [[United States Bureau of Reclamation]] (USBR) from 1924 until his death in 1936. During his tenure, he oversaw some of the most complex projects the Bureau of Reclamation has undertaken. These included the [[Hoover Dam|Hoover]], [[Grand Coulee Dam|Grand Coulee]] and [[Owyhee Dam|Owyhee]] dams.

==Early life and career==
Mead was born in [[Patriot, Indiana]], and graduated from [[Purdue]] with a [[Bachelor of Science]] in 1882. He worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Indianapolis for seven months and departed for [[Fort Collins, Colorado]], by the end of the year.  

There he started work as a professor by teaching mathematics at [[Colorado Agricultural College]] from 1883 until 1884, and again from 1886 to 1888. He developed and taught the first class on irrigation engineering in the United States. Mead also worked for the Colorado State Engineer's Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/history/commiss.html|title=Commissioners of Reclamation|accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kluger|first1=James|title=Turning on Water with a Shovel: the career of Elwood Mead|date=1992|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public service==
[[File:elwood-mead-2.jpg|thumb|right|Elwood Mead portrait]]
In 1888, Mead became the territorial and state engineer of [[Wyoming]]. From 1888 until 1899, he was key in drafting the water laws for Wyoming. He was also a key supporter of the Cody Canal, one of the nation's first [[Carey Act]] projects undertaken by a group of investors, including [[Buffalo Bill|William F. Cody]].&lt;ref name="Bonner"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bonner| first = Robert| title = William F. Cody's Wyoming empire: the Buffalo Bill nobody knows| publisher = University of Oklahoma Press| year = 2007|pages = 318| isbn = 978-0-8061-3829-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899, Mead was appointed head of irrigation investigations for the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]], based out of Cheyenne. There he had an important role of directing irrigation studies across the west.

In 1907, Mead was appointed Chairman of the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission of [[Victoria, Australia]]. He served there for four years, though the Australian records show that he continued to work there until May, 1915.

In 1911, he returned to the United States to become the professor of Rural Institutions, [[University of California]], and chairman of the [[California Land Settlement Board]].  His ideas about developing efficient rural communities would later influence what would become the [[Resettlement Administration]] communities of the [[New Deal]].

[[File:Elwood-mead.jpg|thumb|left|Elwood Mead]]
He continued to serve in California until 1924, when he was appointed Chairman of the Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) by President [[Calvin Coolidge]]'s administration.  In 1923 and again in 1927, he went to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] to help the [[Zionist]]s develop irrigation and development plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.macam.ac.il/~arnon/Int-ME/water/AN%20AMERICAN%20IN%20PALESTINE.htm|

accessdate=December 4, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the USBR, Mead oversaw the planning and execution of construction of major water control and irrigation projects in the West: the [[Hoover Dam|Hoover]], [[Grand Coulee Dam|Grand Coulee]] and [[Owyhee Dam|Owyhee]] dams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunsetcities.com/lake-mead/dr%20elwood%20mead.html|title=Dr. Elwood Mead Commissioner of Bureau of Reclamation 1924-1936 - Lake Mead NRA|accessdate=December 4, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mead died on January 26, 1936, at the age of 78 in Washington, D.C., from [[thrombosis]], just four months after the completion of Boulder Dam. Originally interred at [[Abbey Mausoleum (Arlington County, Virginia)|Abbey Mausoleum]], he was reburied at National Memorial Park in [[Falls Church, Virginia]], in 2001 after the former crypt closed and was demolished.

==Legacy and honors==
[[Lake Mead]], formed by the construction of the [[Hoover Dam]] on the [[Colorado River]], was named after Mead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://dwgateway.library.unr.edu/keck/histtopoNV/Origin_of_Place_Names_Files/1941NevadaOriginofNames-pt1.pdf | title=Origin of Place Names: Nevada | publisher=W.P.A. | author=Federal Writers' Project | year=1941 | pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the namesake to the [[SS Elwood Mead|SS ''Elwood Mead'']], a [[Liberty ship]] which was launched in 1944.

The '''Flood''' are fictional [[parasite|parasitic]] [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] life forms in the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' video game series created by [[Bungie]]. They are introduced in ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' as a second enemy faction alongside the [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]]; they return in later entries in the series such as ''[[Halo 2]]'', ''[[Halo 3]]'', and ''[[Halo Wars]]''. The Flood are driven by a desire to infect any sentient life they encounter, and are depicted as such a threat that the ancient [[Factions of Halo#Forerunners|Forerunners]] killed themselves and all other sentient life in the galaxy in an effort to stop the Flood.

The Flood's design and fiction was spearheaded by Bungie artist Robert McLees, who utilized unused concepts from the earlier Bungie game ''[[Marathon 2]]''. The setting of the first game, the ringworld [[Halo (megastructure)|Halo]], was stripped of many of its large creatures to make the Flood's appearance more startling. Bungie environment artist Vic DeLeon spent six months of pre-production time refining the Flood's fleshy aesthetic and designing the organic interiors of Flood-infested space ships for ''Halo&amp;nbsp;3''.

The player's discovery of the Flood in ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' is a major plot twist, and was one of the surprises reviewers noted positively upon release. The Flood's return in ''Halo&amp;nbsp;2'' and ''Halo&amp;nbsp;3'' was less enthusiastically praised. Reaction to the Flood has varied over the years; while some found the Flood too derivative and a cliché element of science fiction, some others ranked them among the greatest villains of all time.

==Development==
[[Image:Flood concept.png|thumb|left|alt=Sketch of a humanoid alien. Tentacles sprout out where the head would be and long whiplike tentacles extend from the hand|Concept art of a Flood combat form. The left hand has been replaced with tentacles, and the infection form's sensory apparatus sprout out where the head once was before it was corrupted]]
The Flood are depicted as parasitic organisms that infect any sentient life of sufficient size. The largest self-contained form that the Flood can produce itself without using other biomass is an "infection form".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Trautmann|first=Eric|title=The Art of Halo|date= 2004|publisher= Del Ray Publishing|location=New York |isbn=0-345-47586-0 |page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; These forms seeks hosts living or dead, attempting to drive sharp spines into the host and tap into the nervous system. The host is incapacitated while the infection form burrows into the host's body and begins the mutation process, bringing the host under Flood control.&lt;ref&gt;Dietz (2003), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the size or condition of the body, the infection form mutates the hapless host into various specialized forms in the continual drive for more food. Larger hosts are seen turned into forms for combat, growing long whiplike tentacles,&lt;ref name="piggy"&gt;{{cite book|title=Prima's Official Strategy Guide: Halo 2|pages=120–123|publisher=Random House|location=New York|date=2004|isbn=0-7615-4473-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; while mangled and disused hosts are turned into incubators for more infection forms.&lt;ref name="piggy"/&gt; The Flood also create forms such as a central intelligence or "Gravemind" to drive the infestation.

The Flood were added early in the development of the 2001 video game ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', before the game had made its jump from the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] platform to the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. A design for one Flood form appeared as early as 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Trautmann|first=Eric|title=The Art of Halo|date= 2004|publisher= Del Ray Publishing|location=New York |isbn=0-345-47586-0 |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting upon the inception of the Flood, Bungie staff member Chris Butcher noted that "the idea behind the Flood as the forgotten peril that ended a galaxy-spanning empire is a pretty fundamental tenet of good sci-fi. Yeah, and bad sci-fi too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=January 9, 2002|author=Butch, Chris |author2= |url=http://halo.bungie.org/misc/interviews/getinthegame.butcher.010902/|title=Halo Chat with Developer Chris Butcher|publisher=[[Halo.Bungie.Org]]|accessdate=September 3, 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802081842/http://halo.bungie.org/misc/interviews/getinthegame.butcher.010902/|archivedate=August 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another inspiration was [[Christopher Rowley]]'s ''The Vang'' series.&lt;ref name="gamespot-halo"&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|date=November 17, 2006|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/halo3/news.html?sid=6162009&amp;mode=previews&amp;msg_sort=1&amp;cpage=11|title=Halo Q&amp;A--Past, Present, Future|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early design for the Flood was done by Bungie artist and writer Robert McLees, who considers himself "the architect" of the Flood;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Smith, Luke|url= http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&amp;cid=12753|title= Halo Universe: Covenant Weapons|accessdate= November 9, 2007|publisher= [[Bungie]]|date= September 6, 2007|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011163447/http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&amp;cid=12753|archivedate= October 11, 2007|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Flood's roots are reflected in concept art of a "fungal zombie" that McLees did for the earlier Bungie game ''[[Marathon 2: Durandal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=McLees, Robert|url=http://www.bungie.net/projects/marathon/asset_popup_viewer.aspx?at=51&amp;cc=33&amp;item=2|title=Marathon Series Concept Art|accessdate=November 9, 2007|publisher=[[Bungie]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114162205/http://www.bungie.net/projects/marathon/asset_popup_viewer.aspx?at=51&amp;cc=33&amp;item=2|archivedate=November 14, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLees also did all the early concept art for the Flood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bungie.net/perlbin/blam.pl?file=/site/0/news/stories/robt_mclees_interviewed_by_you.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030608213532/http://www.bungie.net/perlbin/blam.pl?file=%2Fsite%2F0%2Fnews%2Fstories%2Frobt_mclees_interviewed_by_you.html |archivedate=June 8, 2003 |accessdate=April 10, 2008 |title=Robert McLees Interviewed By You! |publisher=[[Bungie]] |date=February 13, 2002 |author=Bungie |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the behavior of viruses and certain bacteria, the Flood were intended to be "disgusting and nasty".&lt;ref name="deleon-flood"/&gt; The creatures were constructed from the corpses and bodies of former combatants, so the artists had to make sure the Flood soldiers were recognizable while changing their silhouette enough to differentiate them from the uninfected.&lt;ref name="art of halo 3"/&gt; Many concepts and ideas were discarded due to time constraints—initially, the Flood were intended to convert any species of the alien [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]] into soldiers. "We didn't have the resources to make it happen," McLees recalled, so they modified the game's fiction to suggest that some Covenant were too small or too frail to be combat troops.&lt;ref name="feast of bones"&gt;{{cite web|author=Osborne, Eric|date=March 29, 2010|url=http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&amp;link=Feast_of_Bones|title=Feast of Bones|publisher=[[Bungie]]|accessdate=March 30, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331183009/http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&amp;link=Feast_of_Bones|archivedate=March 31, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the Flood enemy intelligence was intended to be as complicated as that of the other enemy faction in the game, the Covenant, but full implementation was cut for time. The dinosaur-like terrestrial wildlife that originally dwelled in Halo's environments were dropped due to gameplay constraints and fear that their pretense would reduce the surprise and impact of the Flood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=prexboxhistory040904 |title=One Million Years B.X. |date=February 10, 2006 |publisher=[[Bungie]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210224125/http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=prexboxhistory040904 |archivedate=February 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bungie decided a new visual language for the Flood was needed for ''Halo 3''. The task of developing the new Flood forms, organic Flood terrain, and other miscellaneous changes fell to Vic DeLeon, then Bungie's Senior Environment Artist.&lt;ref name="deleon-flood"&gt;{{cite web|author=DeLeon, Vic |date=May 28, 2008 |url=http://www.bungie.net/Inside/publications.aspx |title=Bungie Publications: Halo 3 Flood Alien Level Autopsy |publisher=[[Bungie]] |accessdate=July 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203200020/http://www.bungie.net//images/Inside/publications/presentations/!Halo3_Flood_Alien_Level_Autopsy.zip |archivedate=February 3, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early concepts of what became new Flood types in the game called "pure forms" featured the creatures wielding an array of weapons via tendrils, while forms like the Flood Infector and Flood Transport concepts never made it into the final game.&lt;ref name="art of halo 3"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bungie|editor=Mario de Govia|date=2008|title=The Art of Halo 3|publisher=Random House|location=Roseville, California|isbn=978-0-7615-6072-2|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flood-infested structures were designed as angular to counterbalance Flood biomass, as well as provide surfaces for the game's artificial intelligence to exploit and move on. New additions were designed to be multi-purpose; exploding "growth pods" that spew Flood forms were added to the game to adjust pacing, provide instant action, and add to the visuals. [[Endoscopy|Endoscopic]] pictures provided further inspiration.&lt;ref name="deleon-flood"/&gt; ''Halo&amp;nbsp;3'' added new capabilities to the Flood, including the ability for the parasite to infect enemies in real time.&lt;ref name="deleon-flood"/&gt; Bungie used ''Halo 3''{{'}}s improved capacity for graphics to make a host's sudden transformation into Flood form more dramatic; two different character models and skeletons were fused and swapped in real-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McEachern, Martin|date=December 2007|title=Making Halo 3 Shine|journal=Computer Graphics World|volume=30|issue=12|pages=18–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
===Main games===
The Flood make their first appearance more than halfway through ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', during the story mission "343 Guilty Spark". A group of humans fleeing the enemy aliens [[Factions of Halo#Covenant|Covenant]] land on "[[Halo (megastructure)|Halo]]", a [[ringworld]] built by the alien Forerunners. The human commander [[Characters of Halo#Jacob Keyes|Jacob Keyes]] disappears in a swamp while searching for a weapons cache. The artificial intelligence [[Cortana (Halo)|Cortana]] sends the supersoldier [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]] to find Keyes. The Master Chief discovers that the Covenant have accidentally released the Flood. Keyes' squad is turned into soldiers for the parasite, while Keyes is interrogated by the Flood in an attempt to learn the location of Earth and ultimately assimilated. The emergence of the Flood prompts Halo's caretaker artificial intelligence [[Characters of Halo#343 Guilty Spark|343 Guilty Spark]] to enlist the help of the Master Chief in activating Halo's defenses and preventing a Flood outbreak. When Master Chief learns that activating Halo would instead wipe the galaxy of sentient life to prevent the Flood's spread, he and Cortana instead detonates the human ship ''Pillar of Autumn''{{'}}s engines, destroying the ring and preventing the Flood from escaping.

The Flood return in ''[[Halo 2]]'' (2004), appearing on [[Halo (megastructure)#Installation 05|Installation 05]] or "Delta Halo". The Flood on Delta Halo are led by the [[Gravemind]], a massive Flood intelligence that dwells in the bowels of the ring. Gravemind brings together the Master Chief and [[Arbiter (Halo)|the Arbiter]] and tasks them with stopping the Covenant leadership from activating the ring. In the meantime, Gravemind infests the human ship ''In Amber Clad'' and crashes it into the Covenant space station of ''High Charity''. Once there, the Flood sweep through the city, and the Gravemind captures Cortana. As the Flood spread, the Covenant form a blockade in an effort to prevent the parasite from leaving its prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|authorlink=Eric Nylund|title=[[Halo: First Strike]]|date= 2003|publisher= [[Ballantine Books]]|location=New York |isbn=0-345-46781-7|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Flood reappear in the ''[[Halo 3]]'' mission "Floodgate", on board a damaged ship that escapes the quarantine around Delta Halo. While the infestation of Earth is prevented, Master Chief and Arbiter form a tenuous alliance with the Flood to stop the activation of all the Halo rings at the Forerunner installation known as the Ark. Once the threat is stopped, the Gravemind turns on them. The Master Chief fights his way to the center of ''High Charity'', freeing Cortana and destroying the city, but Gravemind attempts to rebuild himself on a Halo under construction at the Ark. Realizing that activating the ring will destroy only the local Flood infestation due to the Ark's location outside of the Milky Way, the Master Chief, Arbiter, Cortana and Sergeant Johnson proceed to Halo's control room, activate the ring, and escape. However, the Gravemind warns them that his defeat will only delay the Flood, not stop it.

The Flood also make appearances in the video game spinoffs ''[[Halo Wars]]'' and ''[[Halo Wars 2]]''. In ''Halo Wars'', they are encountered infesting a Forerunner installation and ultimately annihilated by the actions of the crew of the humans ship ''Spirit of Fire''. In the ''Halo Wars 2'' expansion "Awakening the Nightmare", the alien faction known as the Banished accidentally release the Flood while salvaging the wreck of ''High Charity''.

The 2006 anthology ''[[The Halo Graphic Novel]]'' expands upon the Flood's release from Halo in two stories. The first, ''Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor'', takes place at the same time as the Master Chief hunts for Keyes during ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. The Flood manage to pilot a Covenant dropship off Halo, and infest a Covenant ship, ''Infinite Succor''. The Flood are stopped by a Covenant strike team led by [[Characters of Halo#Rtas 'Vadum|Rtas 'Vadumee]], who sets the ship on a course into the nearby sun.&lt;ref name="Hammock 2006"&gt;{{cite book |last= Hammock|first= Lee|title=The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor|date= 2006|publisher= Marvel Comics|isbn=0-7851-2372-5 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second story, ''Breaking Quarantine'', details the escape of Sergeant [[Characters of Halo#Avery Johnson|Avery Johnson]] from the clutches of the Flood, immediately after Keyes' squad is overrun. Whereas the Flood are only hinted at being intelligent in ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', the ''Halo Graphic Novel'' shows the Flood have a [[group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]], assimilating the knowledge of their hosts rapidly. [[Lee Hammock]], writer of ''The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor'', described the basis of the story as a way to showcase the true danger of the Flood as an intelligent menace, rather than something the player encounters and shoots. Hammock also stated that the story would prove the intelligent nature of the Flood, and "hopefully euthanize the idea that they are just space zombies".&lt;ref name="Hammock 2006"/&gt;

The Flood also feature heavily in [[Greg Bear]]'s trilogy of novels, [[The Forerunner Saga]], which takes place thousands of years before the events of ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. It is revealed in the novel ''Halo: Silentium'' that the Flood are what remains of the Precursors, an ancient race that was said to accelerate the evolution of a species and "shape galaxies". The Forerunners overthrew the Precursors; on the verge of extinction, some Precursors reduced themselves to a biological powder that would regenerate into their past selves. However, time rendered the powder defective, and it became mutagenic, reacting with other living organisms to produce what would eventually mutate into the Flood. The Flood would threaten both ancient humanity and then the Forerunners, who would ultimately build and activate the Halo Array to stop the spread of the Flood.

===Merchandise===
The Flood have been featured in four series of ''Halo'' [[action figure]]s, produced by Joyride Studios. For ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', Joyride produced a Carrier Form and Infection form bundle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thorson, Thor|date=February 17, 2004|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/halo/news.html?sid=6089512|title=First Halo 2 action figures appear|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=July 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Halo&amp;nbsp;2''{{'}}s series contains both a human Combat Form and Infection form (bundled with the Master Chief), which were released after the video game.&lt;ref name="armchair empire review"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Simmer, Aaron|date=April 9, 2006|url=http://www.armchairempire.com/action-figures/flood-human-form.htm|title=Flood Human Form (Halo 2)|publisher=The Armchair Empire|accessdate=July 12, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504185934/http://www.armchairempire.com/action-figures/flood-human-form.htm|archivedate=May 4, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewer Aaron Simmer of Armchair Empire.com expressed the sentiment that Joyride's models could not totally capture the ghoulishness texture and detail of the Flood.&lt;ref name="armchair empire review"/&gt; The action figures for ''[[Halo 3]]'' were produced by [[McFarlane Toys]] and although the first series did not feature the Flood, the third series featured a human Combat Form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Burg, Justin|date=March 26, 2008|url=http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2008/03/26/halo-3-series-three-mcfarlane-figures-preview/|title=Halo 3 series three McFarlane figures preview|publisher=[[Joystiq|XBox360Fanboy]]|accessdate=April 3, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330002005/http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2008/03/26/halo-3-series-three-mcfarlane-figures-preview/|archivedate=March 30, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the positive acclaim in ''Halo'', the response to the presence of the Flood in ''Halo&amp;nbsp;2'' and ''Halo&amp;nbsp;3'' was mixed. A panel of online reviewers noted that the Flood appeared in ''Halo&amp;nbsp;2'' for no obvious reasons, and were simply described as "aggravating" to play against.&lt;ref name=free&gt;{{cite web|date=2004|url=http://www.teamfremont.com/reviews/Halo2.shtml|title=Team Fremont: Halo 2 review|publisher=TeamFremont|accessdate=September 5, 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050319203907/http://www.teamfremont.com/reviews/Halo2.shtml| archivedate = March 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, reviewers including Victor Godinez of ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' felt that the Flood were too derivative of other [[science fiction|sci-fi]] stereotypes, and functioned as "space [[zombie]]s".&lt;ref name=free/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Godinez, Victor|date=July 16, 2006|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/ptech/gamereviews2/071806ccdrPTECHhalobook.1d4d3a2.html|title=Review: The Halo Graphic Novel|work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|accessdate=September 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Weissenberger of Gamecritics.com noted in his review of ''Halo&amp;nbsp;3'' that even though the Flood looked better than ever, their single strategy of rushing the player proved tedious over time.&lt;ref name="gamecritics review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamecritics.com/halo-3-review|title=''Halo 3'' Review|author=Weissenberger, Daniel|date=October 1, 2007|accessdate=October 2, 2007|publisher=GameCritics}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GamesRadar]]'s Charlie Barratt listed the Flood as the worst part of ''Halo'', contrasting what he considered fun, vibrant and open levels before the Flood's appearance with confined spaces and predictable enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Barratt, Charlie|date=June 16, 2008|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/the-top-7-worst-parts-of-best-games/a-200806161050968082/p-2|title=The Top 7...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5859">'''François de Civille''', seigneur de [[Saint-Mards]] (1537–1610), French soldier and diplomat. The Civille family of [[Rouen]] was of Spanish origin.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle K. Brunelle, 'Immigration, Assimilation and Success: Three Families of Spanish Origin in Sixteenth Century Rouen', ''The Sixteenth Century Journal'', vol. 20, No. 2 (Summer, 1989), pp. 203–220, 214–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buried Alive==

François de Civille was a soldier in the [[French Wars of Religion]]. He wrote a memoir describing being found dead, buried, and resuscitated at the siege of [[Rouen]] in 1562. He was shot in the head and fell from the ramparts into the ditch, where workers buried him on 12 October 1562. Civille's groom went to collect the body to bury it properly and found he was still alive. During his recovery, soldiers looking for his younger brother discovered him in bed and threw him out of the window. He landed in a dung heap in the courtyard where he remained senseless in his night clothes for three days until he was found by his cousin. His injuries left him unable to close his mouth without pain. Subsequently, Civille would write "Dead, Buried, Resuscitated" under his signature. Civille wrote a memoir of his 1562 experience and had it printed in 1606. [[Pierre de L'Estoile]] noted its publication in July 1606. In a later addition to the story, it was said that Civille died after falling a third time, falling ill on an icy night while peeping into a neighbour's window.&lt;ref&gt;A. Varillas, ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dFIPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA256#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| Histoire de Charles IX]'', vol. 1 (Paris, 1684), 256–7: Ernest Poret Bénigne, Marquis de Blosseville, ''Discours des causes pour lesquelles le Sieur de Civille se dit avoir été mort, enterré et ressuscité'' (Rouen, 1863), XIX, 13–14, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomat and Refugee==
As a diplomat he worked for Françoise de Bourbon, [[Duchess of Bouillon]] and was an informant for [[Francis Walsingham]], reporting on English visitors at Rouen, and declared that he was as sure and constant in Walsingham's service 'as a diamond is hard'.&lt;ref&gt;A. Aubry, ''La Normandie à l'étranger: documents inédits relatifs à l'histoire de Normandie'' (Paris, 1873), 243.&lt;/ref&gt; He sent gifts of dried fruit, apples and pears, to [[Ursula St Barbe]] and [[Lettice Knollys]], the wives of Walsingham and [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]]. He came to London and met [[Elizabeth I]] in 1584 and 1588.&lt;ref&gt;E.J.B. Allen, ''Post and Courier Service in the Diplomacy of Early Modern Europe'' (Hague, 1972), 34–5, 56: ''Calendar State Papers Foreign Elizabeth'', vol. 19, p.524&lt;/ref&gt; He and his wife, Jehanne du Mouchet, and family came to [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]] in July 1585 and were listed as Protestant refugees in London in January 1586.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers London Foreign Elizabeth'', vol. 20 (London, 1921), 293.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Elizabeth I of England holding an olive branch.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Elizabeth I of England said to have been a gift to François de Civille in 1588.]]
In 1588, Elizabeth gave him a jewel and her portrait, according to an inscription on a painting belonging to his descendants.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Poret Blosseville, ''Discours des causes pour lesquelles le sieur de Civille'' (Rouen, 1863), p.XII: [http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/english-school-circa-1585-1590-portrait-of-queen-5701777-details.aspx| Details of the portrait of Elizabeth, Christie's London 2 July 2013, no. 23.]&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving his wife in London, he travelled to Edinburgh in March 1589 to raise an army of 3000 soldiers for [[Henri IV of France |Henri of Navarre]] and work on the unsuccessful negotiations for the marriage of [[James VI of Scotland]] to [[Catherine de Bourbon]] sister of Henri of Navarre. James was advised of Civille's mission by Henri's letter of 23 December 1588. James married [[Anne of Denmark]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;A. Cameron, ''Warrender Papers'', vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1932), 91–2, 107–8: ''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), 7: ''Calendar State Papers Foreign Elizabeth'' vol. 23, (London, 1950), 10: Ernest Poret Blosseville, (Rouen, 1863), p.XIII.&lt;/ref&gt; Civille mentioned in a letter from [[East Wemyss|Wemyss]] that the [[Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon|Earl of Huntingdon]] was his 'old and gracious master'. Civille left Scotland in September 1589 accompanied by [[James Colville, 1st Lord Colville of Culross|Sir James Colville of Easter Wemyss]].&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), 141, 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1598 Henri IV ordered Civille as "Commissaire Ordinaire des Guerres" to take command of troops at [[Saumur]].&lt;ref&gt;Jules Berger de Xivray, ''Recueil des lettres missives de Henri IV'' vol. 4 (Paris, 1848). 895-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Frozen''''' is a 2010 American [[thriller film|thriller]]-[[drama film]] written and directed by [[Adam Green (filmmaker)|Adam Green]] and starring [[Emma Bell]], [[Shawn Ashmore]] and [[Kevin Zegers]].

==Plot==
Childhood friends Dan Walker and Joe Lynch, along with Dan's girlfriend Parker O'Neil, spend a Sunday afternoon at a New England ski resort on Mount Holliston. They are eager to take one last run down the mountain before they go home; however, the ski resort decides to close early because a storm is moving in.

The friends convince the ski lift attendant to let them on one last time. Before the group gets all the way to the top, the attendant is called into the boss's office and is replaced by a co-worker. As he leaves, he tells the co-worker that there are only three skiers left. Another set of three skiers comes down the mountain. When he sees them, he shuts down the ski lift, stranding the three friends in their ski lift chair far above the ground.

They take it as a joke, but the ski resort's lights are then turned off, leaving the three friends in fear and shock. Parker knows the ski slopes have closed for the week. Dan feels he has no choice but to jump from the ski lift chair and get help, as they will not survive up there in the bitter cold until Friday.

After discussing the danger, Dan decides to jump off the lift. Upon hitting the ground, he suffers a [[compound fracture]] on both of his legs. Soon, his screams and the scent of blood attracts a pack of wolves. Joe, now fearing for Dan's safety, decides to try to get to the ground by traversing the suspension cable between the lifts and [[steel]] support tower. However, as wolves close in on Dan, he returns to the chair and holds Parker as Dan is brutally torn apart by the wolves.

In the morning, Parker awakes with her hand frozen on the bar, which she grabbed during her sleep. She is also suffering severe [[frostbite]]. Joe discusses his previous life experiences with her, before attempting to traverse the ski lift cable, and onto a support pole on the other side. By doing this, he also causes the chair Parker is sitting in to dangerously loosen from the cable. After scaring off a pair of wolves by using a ski pole, he slides down the mountain on Parker's snowboard, planning to return with help. The wolves give chase after him. Joe never returns and Parker spends the night alone on the loose cable.

The next day, Parker begins to climb out of the lift, but the screw comes loose and causes the lift to fall. Blocked by a cable, the lift is hanging a few meters above the ground. Parker jumps and then the lift lands on her ankle. Injured, she begins to slide and crawl down the mountain. She encounters the wolves feasting on Joe's mutilated corpse. Too occupied with Joe's corpse, they ignore her as she continues down, eventually crawling to a nearby road.

The first car that passes doesn't see her but soon a minivan appears and the driver, seeing her outstretched body lying in the snow along the side of the road, stops to assist her. The film ends with the driver saying they are going to a nearby hospital, followed by Parker closing her eyes.

===Critical===
[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 62% of 91 surveyed critics gave it a positive review, and the average rating was 5.8/10; the site's consensus is: "Writer/director Adam Green has the beginnings of an inventive, frightening yarn in ''Frozen'', but neither the script nor the cast are quite strong enough to truly do it justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10012051-frozen|title=Frozen|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Richard Roeper]] called the film "an entertaining, suspense-filled, sometimes wonderfully grotesque little scarefest",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-12DB0F1256971C90.html|title=Three friends face a final deep freeze|last=Roeper|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Roeper|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=2010-02-05|accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; though ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' commented that it "is not written, directed, or acted well enough to be a first-rate thriller".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/frozen-film-review-29199|title=Frozen -- Film Review|last=Greenberg|first=James|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=2010-10-14|accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jeannette Catsoulis of ''[[The New York Times]]'' made it a NYT Critics' Pick and wrote, "A minimalist setup delivers maximum fright in ''Frozen'', a nifty little chiller that balances its cold terrain with an unexpectedly warm heart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/05/movies/05frozen.html?partner=Rotten%2520Tomatoes&amp;ei=5083&amp;_r=0|title=A Nightmare on a Ski Lift|last=Catsoulis|first=Jeannette|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2010-02-04|accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Peter Debruge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, "Don’t be surprised if the movie’s most wince-inducing moments come not from the "disturbing images" (as the MPAA describes the sight of a leg bone sticking six inches out of one character's ski pants) but rather of the bad acting and worse dialogue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2010/film/reviews/frozen-1117942010/|title=Review: 'Frozen'|last=Debruge|first=Peter|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2010-01-28|accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1287">In [[artificial intelligence]], especially [[computer vision]] and [[artificial neural network]]s, a '''hard sigmoid''' is non-[[smoothness|smooth]] function used in place of a [[sigmoid function]]. These retain the basic shape of a sigmoid, rising from 0 to 1, but using simpler functions, especially [[piecewise linear function]]s or [[piecewise constant function]]s. These are preferred where speed of computation is more important than precision.

== Examples ==
The most extreme examples are the [[sign function]] or [[Heaviside step function]], which go from −1 to 1 or 0 to 1 (which to use depends on normalization) at 0.&lt;ref&gt;Curves and Surfaces in Computer Vision and Graphics, Volume 1610, SPIE, 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9fpRAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22hard+sigmoid%22 p. 301]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include the [[Theano (software)|Theano]] library, which provides two approximations: &lt;code&gt;ultra_fast_sigmoid&lt;/code&gt;, which is a multi-part piecewise linear approximation and &lt;code&gt;hard_sigmoid&lt;/code&gt;, which is a 3-part piecewise linear approximation (output 0, line with slope 5, output 1).&lt;ref&gt;[http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/library/tensor/nnet/nnet.html nnet – Ops for neural networks]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Army was still conducting interrogations according to the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay model]]: Interrogators were nominally using the methods outlined in the [[U.S. Army Interrogation Field Manual|U.S. Army Field Manual]], the interrogators' bible, but they were pushing in every way possible to bend the rules -- and often break them.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost2008-12-04/&gt;}}

The author has stated that when [[the Pentagon]] vetted the book they initially made 93 [[redaction]]s.&lt;ref name=MiddleEastOnline/&gt;

Alexander is an outspoken opponent of [[torture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://howtobreakaterrorist.blogspot.com/ Terrorist Breaker Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; He refutes the [[effectiveness of torture]], citing its negative long-term effects such as recruiting for Al-Qaeda. He also argues that torture is contrary to the American principles of freedom, liberty, and justice, and that should they resort to torture, American interrogators become the enemy they serve to defeat. Similar arguments have been made by other former interrogators from the [[U.S. military]], [[FBI]], and the [[CIA]], including Colonel [[Steven Kleinman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Background.view&amp;backgroundid=272 Abuse Has No Place in Interrogation Policy, Nieman Watchdog Group Commentary, July 29th, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with human rights lawyer [[Scott Horton (lawyer)|Scott Horton]] for [[Harper's Magazine]], Alexander said

{{quote|The American public has a right to know that they do not have to choose between torture and terror. There is a better way to conduct interrogations that works more efficiently, keeps Americans safe, and doesn't sacrifice our integrity. Our greatest victory to date in this war, the death of [[Abu Musab Al Zarqawi]] (which saved thousands of lives and helped pave the way to the [[Sunni Awakening]]), was achieved using interrogation methods that had nothing to do with torture.

Alexander described [[Marc Thiessen]]'s 2010 book ''Courting Disaster'', which defended the use of [[enhanced interrogation techniques]], as 'a literary defense of war criminals'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2246692/pagenum/all/|title=Courting Fear|first=Matthew|last=Alexander|authorlink=|publisher=''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''|date=February 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human enhancement''' is "any attempt to temporarily or permanently overcome the current limitations of the [[human body]] through natural or artificial means. It is the use of technological means to select or alter human characteristics and capacities, whether or not the alteration results in characteristics and capacities that lie beyond the existing human range."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieet.org/index.php/tpwiki/human_enhancement Human enhancement], IEET&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004 (paper)"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Hughes, James| title = Human Enhancement on the Agenda| year = 2004 |   url = http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/hughes20041101| accessdate=2007-02-02| authorlink = James Hughes (sociologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, P., "Enhancing Me: The Hope and the Hype of Human Enhancement"&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[National Intelligence Council]]'s Global Trends 2030 report, "human augmentation could allow civilian and military people to work more effectively, and in environments that were previously inaccessible". It states that "future retinal eye implants could enable [[night vision]], and [[neuro-enhancement]]s could provide superior [[memory recall]] or [[Nerve conduction velocity|speed of thought]]. [[Neuro-pharmaceutical]]s will allow people to maintain concentration for longer periods of time or enhance their learning abilities. [[Augmented reality]] systems can provide enhanced experiences of real-world situations."&lt;ref name=trends2030&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Trends 2030: Alternative Worlds|url=https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/GlobalTrends_2030.pdf|publisher=National Intelligence Council|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of technological enhancements, [[Kevin Warwick]] lists the possibilities as enhanced memory, enhanced communication, enhanced senses, multi-dimensional thinking, extending the body, in built machine thinking, outsourcing memory, enhanced maths + speed of thinking + problem solving.,&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, K, "Human Enhancement - The Way Ahead" ACM Ubiquity, October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  He also states that "a person's brain and body do not have to be in the same place".&lt;ref&gt;http://ubiquity.acm.org/article.cfm?id=2667642&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nootropics ==
{{main|Nootropic}}
There are many substances that are purported to have promise in augmenting human cognition by various means. These substances are called nootropics and can potentially benefit individuals with cognitive decline and many different disorders, but may also be capable of yielding results in cognitively healthy persons. Some examples of these include [[Huperzine A]], [[Phosphatidylserine]], [[Bacopa monnieri]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aguiar|first1=Sebastian|last2=Borowski|first2=Thomas|title=Neuropharmacological Review of the Nootropic Herb Bacopa monnieri|pmc=3746283|website=US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health|publisher=Rejuvenation Research|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Centella asiatica|Gotu Kola]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gohil|first1=Kashmira J.|last2=Patel|first2=Jagruti A.|last3=Gajjar|first3=Anuradha K.|title=Pharmacological Review on Centella asiatica: A Potential Herbal Cure-all|pmc=3116297|website=US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health Search database|publisher=Indian Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Acetyl-l-Carnitine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smeland|first1=Olav B.|last2=Meisingset|first2=Tore W.|last3=Borges|first3=Karin|last4=Sonnewald|first4=Ursula|title=Chronic acetyl-l-carnitine alters brain energy metabolism and increases noradrenaline and serotonin content in healthy mice|pmid=22549035|website=US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health Search database|publisher=Neurochemistry International|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uridine monophosphate]], [[Theanine|L-theanine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Owen|first1=Gail N.|last2=Parnell|first2=Holly|last3=De Bruin|first3=Eveline A.|last4=Rycroft|first4=Jane A.|title=The combined effects of L-theanine and caffeine on cognitive performance and mood|pmid=18681988|website=US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health Search database|publisher=Nutritional Neuroscience|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Giesbrecht|first1=T.|last2=Rycroft|first2=J.A.|last3=Rowson|first3=M.J.|last4=De Bruin|first4=E.A.|title=The combination of L-theanine and caffeine improves cognitive performance and increases subjective alertness.|pmid=21040626|website=US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health Search database|publisher=Nutritional Neuroscience|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nobre|first1=Anna C.|last2=Rao|first2=Anling|last3=Owen|first3=Gail N.|title=L-theanine, a natural constituent in tea, and its effect on mental state.|pmid=18296328|website=US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health|publisher=Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhodiola rosea, and [[Pinus pinaster|Pycnogenol]] which are all forms of dietary supplement.

==Ethics==
{{See also|Transhumanism|Morphological freedom}}
While in some circles the expression "human enhancement" is roughly synonymous with [[human genetic engineering]],&lt;ref name="Agar 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parens 2000"/&gt; it is used most often to refer to the general application of the [[technological convergence|convergence]] of [[nanotechnology]], [[biotechnology]], [[information technology]] and [[cognitive science]] (NBIC) to [[Performance improvement|improve human performance]].&lt;ref name="Roco and Bainbridge 2004"/&gt;

Since the 1990s, several academics  (such as some of the fellows of the [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]]&lt;ref name="Bailey 2006"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Bailey, Ronald| title = The Right to Human Enhancement: And also uplifting animals and the rapture of the nerds|  year = 2006 | url = http://www.reason.com/news/show/116489.html| accessdate=2007-03-03|    authorlink = Ronald Bailey}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have risen to become advocates of the case for human enhancement while other academics (such as the members of [[The President's Council on Bioethics|President Bush's Council on Bioethics]]&lt;ref name="Members of the President's Council on Bioethics 2003"&gt;{{cite book| author = Members of the President's Council on Bioethics| title = Beyond Therapy: Biotechnology and the Pursuit of Happiness| url = http://www.bioethics.gov/reports/beyondtherapy/| publisher = [[President's Council on Bioethics]]| year = 2003| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070202061234/http://www.bioethics.gov/reports/beyondtherapy/| archivedate = 2007-02-02| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;) have become outspoken critics.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004 (book)"&gt;{{cite book| author = Hughes, James| title = [[Citizen Cyborg]]: Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future| publisher = Westview Press| year = 2004| isbn = 0-8133-4198-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocacy of the case for human enhancement is increasingly becoming synonymous with "[[transhumanism]]", a controversial ideology and movement which has emerged to support the recognition and protection of the right of citizens to either maintain or [[body modification|modify]] their own [[cognitive liberty|mind]]s and [[morphological freedom|bodies]]; so as to guarantee them the [[Choice|freedom of choice]] and [[informed consent]] of using human enhancement technologies on themselves and their children.&lt;ref name="Ford 2005"&gt;{{cite web | last = Ford | first = Alyssa | authorlink =  | title = Humanity: The Remix | work = [[Utne Magazine]] | publisher =  | date = May–June 2005 | url = http://www.twliterary.com/jhughes_utne.html | accessdate = 2007-03-03 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061230170920/http://www.twliterary.com/jhughes_utne.html | archivedate = 2006-12-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Neuromarketing]] consultant Zack Lynch argues that [[neurotechnology|neurotechnologies]] will have a more immediate effect on society than [[gene therapy]] and will face less resistance as a pathway of radical human enhancement. He also argues that the concept of "[[Enablement (disambiguation)|enablement]]" needs to be added to the debate over "therapy" versus "enhancement".&lt;ref name="R. U. Sirius 2005"&gt;{{cite news| author = [[R. U. Sirius]]| title = The NeuroAge: Zack Lynch In Conversation With R.U. Sirius| publisher = Life Enhancement Products| year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many proposals of human enhancement rely on [[fringe science]], the very notion and prospect of human enhancement has sparked public [[controversy]].&lt;ref name="The Royal Society &amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|   author = [[The Royal Society]] &amp; The [[Royal Academy of Engineering]]|   title = Nanoscience and nanotechnologies (Ch. 6)|   year = 2004 |   url = http://www.nanotec.org.uk/report/chapter7.pdf|   accessdate=2006-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="European Parliament 2006"&gt;{{cite journal| author = [[European Parliament]]|  title = Technology Assessment on Converging Technologies|   year = 2006|   url = https://www.itas.kit.edu/downloads/etag_beua06a.pdf| accessdate= 2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="European Parliament 2009"&gt;{{cite journal| author = [[European Parliament]]|  title = Human Enhancement|   year = 2009|   url = https://www.itas.kit.edu/downloads/etag_coua09a.pdf| accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dale Carrico]] wrote that "human enhancement" is a [[loaded language|loaded]] term which has [[eugenic]] overtones because it may imply the improvement of human [[hereditary]] traits to attain a universally accepted [[norm (sociology)|norm]] of [[Fitness (biology)|biological fitness]] (at the possible expense of human [[biodiversity]] and [[neurodiversity]]), and therefore can evoke negative reactions far beyond the specific meaning of the term. Furthermore, Carrico wrote that enhancements which are self-evidently good, like "fewer diseases", are more the exception than the norm and even these may involve ethical tradeoffs, as the [[controversy about ADHD]] arguably demonstrates.&lt;ref name="Carrico 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|  author = Carrico, Dale| title =  Modification, Consent, and Prosthetic Self-Determination| year = 2007 | url = http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/carrico20070226/| accessdate=2007-04-03|  authorlink = Dale Carrico}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=July 2017}}

However, the most common criticism of human enhancement is that it is or will often be practiced with a [[recklessness (psychology)|reckless]] and [[selfishness|selfish]] short-term perspective that is ignorant of the long-term consequences on individuals and the rest of society, such as the fear that some enhancements will create unfair physical or mental advantages to those who can and will use them, or unequal access to such enhancements can and will further the gulf between the "haves" and "have-nots".&lt;ref name="Ian 2002"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Mooney, Pat Roy| title = Beyond Cloning: Making Well People "Better"| year = 2002 | url = http://www.worldwatch.org/node/521| accessdate=2007-02-02| authorlink = Pat Roy Mooney}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fukuyama 2002"&gt;{{cite book| author = Fukuyama, Francis| title = [[Our Posthuman Future]]: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution| publisher = Farrar Straus &amp; Giroux| year = 2002| isbn = 0-374-23643-7| authorlink = Francis Fukuyama}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IBHF"&gt;{{cite journal| author = [[Institute on Biotechnology and the Human Future]]| title = Human "Enhancement"| url = http://www.thehumanfuture.org/themes/human_enhancement/background.html| accessdate = 2007-02-02| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070209224106/http://www.thehumanfuture.org/themes/human_enhancement/background.html| archivedate = 2007-02-09| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hauskeller-2013&gt;Michael Hauskeller, ''Better Humans?: Understanding the Enhancement Project,'' Acumen, 2013, {{ISBN|978-1-84465-557-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Futurist [[Ray Kurzweil]] has shown some concern that, within the century, humans may be required to merge with this technology in order to compete in the marketplace.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Other critics of human enhancement fear that such capabilities would change, for the worse, the dynamic relations within a family. Given the choices of superior qualities, parents make their child as opposed to merely birthing it, and the newborn becomes a product of their will rather than a gift of nature to be loved unconditionally. This is problematic because it could harm the unconditional love a parent could give their child, and it could furthermore lead to serious disappointment if the child does not fulfill its engineered role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2004/04/the-case-against-perfection/302927/|title=The Case Against Perfection|year=2004|author=Sandel, Michael J.|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, some advocates, who want to use more neutral language, and advance the [[public interest]] in so-called "human enhancement technologies", prefer the term "enablement" over "enhancement";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/migrate/uploads/HESummaryReport.pdf Good, Better, Best: The Human Quest for Enhancement] Summary Report of an Invitational Workshop.

===Social and economic inequality concerns===
{{essay|date=December 2017}}
Some believe that the ability to enhance one's self would reflect the overall goal of human life: to improve [[Physical fitness|fitness]] and [[survivability]]. They claim that it is human nature to want to better ourselves via increased [[life expectancy]], strength, intelligence and overall independence.&lt;ref name=Roberta&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berry|first=Roberta|title=A polemic for human enhancement|journal=Metascience|date=July 2010|volume=19|issue=2|pages=263–266|doi=10.1007/s11016-010-9361-z|url=https://link.springer.com.library2.csumb.edu:2048/article/10.1007/s11016-010-9361-z|accessdate=7 November 2013|publisher=Springer Netherlands|issn=1467-9981}}&lt;/ref&gt; In our world, there always have been [[social stratification|stratification]] among [[socioeconomic]] classes that prevent the less wealthy from accessing the best options for goods and opportunities, and so would also restrict access to the best enhancements or prevent them from accessing them at all. The advantage gained by one person's enhancements implies a disadvantage to an weakly enhanced or unenhanced person.&lt;ref name=Allhoff&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allhoff|first=Fritz|author2=Patrick Lin |author3=Jesse Steinberg |title=Ethics of Human Enhancement: An Executive Summary|journal=Science and Engineering Ethics|date=June 2011|volume=17|issue=2|pages=201–212|doi=10.1007/s11948-009-9191-9|url=https://link.springer.com.library2.csumb.edu:2048/article/10.1007/s11948-009-9191-9|accessdate=7 November 2013|publisher=Springer Netherlands|issn=1471-5546}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trends2030/&gt; Human enhancements present a great debate on the [[Economic inequality|equality]] between the individuals throughout the socioeconomic spectrum.

The enhancement of the human body could have profound changes to everyday situations. Sports, for instance, would change dramatically if enhanced people were allowed to compete; there would be a clear disadvantage for those who are not enhanced.&lt;ref name="Allhoff"/&gt; In regards to economic programs, human enhancements would greatly increase life expectancy which would require employers to either adjust their [[pension]] programs to compensate for a longer retirement term, or delay retirement age. When considering [[birth rates]] into this equation, if there is no decline with increased longevity, this could put more pressure on resources like energy and food availability if there is no enhancement for human efficiency. A job candidate enhanced with a neural [[Organ transplantation|transplant]] that heightens their ability to compute and retain information would outcompete someone who is not enhanced. A person with a hearing or sight enhancement could intrude on [[privacy law]]s or expectations in an environment like a classroom or workplace. These enhancements could go undetected and give individuals an overall advantage. However, since restrictions have always existed for any kind of procedure involving children, this might prevent this from affecting schools and competitive junior activities.

Unfairness in those who receive enhancements and those who do not is a cause for concern, although unfairness is inevitable in any field or situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farah|first=Martha J.|title=Emerging ethical issues in neuroscience|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nn1102-1123|journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=5|issue=11|pages=1123–1129|doi=10.1038/nn1102-1123}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual taking a math exam may have had a better teacher, or a greater access to information with a modern handheld device. There also exists the stochastic "genetic lottery" of nature. The long-term physical advantage through [[Human genetic engineering|genetic engineering]] or short-term cognitive advantage of [[nootropic]]s may be part of a greater issue, the real issue being that of [[Social inequality|availability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greely|first=Henry|last2=Sahakian|first2=Barbara|last3=Harris|first3=John|last4=Kessler|first4=Ronald C.|last5=Gazzaniga|first5=Michael|last6=Campbell|first6=Philip|last7=Farah|first7=Martha J.|title=Towards responsible use of cognitive-enhancing drugs by the healthy|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/456702a|journal=Nature|volume=456|issue=7223|pages=702–705|doi=10.1038/456702a}}&lt;/ref&gt;  How easy it is for certain individuals to get a hold of such enhancements depending on their [[Socioeconomic inequality|socioeconomic]] standing. With all technologies it is important to keep in mind the historical trends of technology that relate utility to availability.

[[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]] claims that 21st century Chinese eugenics may allow the Chinese to increase the IQ of each subsequent generation by five to fifteen IQ points, and after a couple generations it "would be game over for Western global competitiveness." Miller recommends that the Western world put aside its "self-righteous" Euro-American ideological biases and learn from the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Geoffrey Miller|work=Edge|url=http://edge.org/response-detail/23838/|title=What should we be worried about?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects on identity ===
Human enhancement technologies can impact human [[Identity (social science)|identity]] by affecting one's self-conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeGrazia|first=David|year=2005|title=Enhancement Technologies and Human Identity|url=https://philosophy.columbian.gwu.edu/sites/philosophy.columbian.gwu.edu/files/image/degrazia_enhancement.pdf|journal=Journal of Medicine and Philosophy|volume=30|pages=261–283|via=|accessdate=12 May 2013|doi=10.1080/03605310590960166}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is problematic because enhancement technologies threaten to alter the self fundamentally to the point where the result is a different person.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} For example, extreme changes in [[personality]] may affect the individual's relationships because others can no longer relate to the new person.&lt;ref name="Hauskeller-2013" /&gt;

=== Human Enhancement Rhetoric (HER) ===
In his essay "Mapping human enhancement rhetoric", Thayer (2014) states that the growth of human enhancement technology means a corresponding growth in the discourse of HET, so he suggests inventing a new classification called Human Enhancement Rhetoric (HER). To establish this classification, Thayer focuses on answering four existential questions: (1) what is HER?, (2) how can HER be mapped?, (3) what does this project of mapping HER accomplish?, and (4) what [[global issue]]s or ethical concerns are raised, or can be further understood, by mapping HER? These foundational questions serve to introduce Thayer's newly conceived boundaries, definitions, nomenclature, and ethical arguments as he works to create a discourse that industry professionals and academics can study, navigate, and grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Mapping human enhancement rhetoric." Global issues and ethical considerations in human enhancement technologies.|last=Thayer|first=K.A.|publisher=IGI Global|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=30–53.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other issues==
{{Expand section|date=December 2016}}
In addition to the issues listed in the ethics section, the enhancement technologies should be sufficiently robust to prevent [[Security hacker|hacking]] and interference of human augmentation.&lt;ref name=trends2030/&gt;

[[Image:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|250px|Da Vinci's [[Vitruvian Man]] is based on the correlations of ideal human proportions with geometry described by the ancient Roman architect [[Vitruvius]]. ]]

'''Human scale''' is the set of physical qualities, and quantities of information, characterizing the [[human]] body, its motor, sensory, or mental capabilities, and human social institutions.

== Science vs. human scale ==

Many of the objects of scientific interest in the universe are much larger than human scale (stars, galaxies) or much smaller than human scale (molecules, atoms, subatomic particles).

Similarly, many time periods studied in science involve time scales much greater than human timescales ([[geologic timescale|geological]] and [[cosmological time scale]]s) or much shorter than human timescales (atomic and subatomic events).

Mathematicians and scientists use very [[large number|large]] and [[small number]]s to describe physical quantities, and have created even larger and smaller numbers for theoretical purposes.

Human scale measurements, however, are more in the order of:

* [[Distance]]: [[1 E0 m|one to two metres]] (3 to 6&amp;nbsp;ft &amp;ndash; human arm's reach, stride, height)
* [[Attention span]]: seconds to hours
* [[Life expectancy|Life span]]: 75 years (mean life expectancy at birth)
* [[Mass]]: [[1 E0 kg|kilograms]] &amp;ndash; most typically, human weights range from about {{convert|3|-|4|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} for newborns to about {{convert|50|-|100|kg|lb|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} for adults
* [[Force]]: [[Newton (unit)|newton]]s (e.g. the weight of a human on Earth, on the order of several hundred newtons, or about 100-200&amp;nbsp;lb&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;)
* [[Pressure]]: one [[Atmosphere (unit)|standard atmosphere]] (average pressure on Earth at sea level, approximately {{convert|100|kPa|inHg|sigfig=1|abbr=on|lk=in}})
* [[Temperature]]: around {{convert|300|K|C F|abbr=on|lk=in}} (room temperature); {{convert|250|to|320|K|C F|abbr=on|-1}} (normal range of temperatures in most inhabited regions of Earth)
* [[Energy]]: typical adult human energy intake is around {{convert|10|MJ|kcal|abbr=on|lk=in}} per day

== Human scale in architecture ==
&lt;!-- Ville Radieuse links here --&gt;
&lt;!-- Tobias Faber links here --&gt;

Humans interact with their environments based on their physical dimensions, capabilities and limits.  The field of [[anthropometrics]] (human measurement) has unanswered questions, but it's still true that human physical characteristics are fairly predictable and objectively measurable.  Buildings scaled to human physical capabilities have steps, doorways, railings, work surfaces, seating, shelves, fixtures, walking distances, and other features that fit well to the average person.

Humans also interact with their environments based on their sensory capabilities.  The fields of human perception systems, like [[perceptual psychology]] and [[cognitive psychology]], are not exact sciences, because human information processing is not a purely physical act, and because perception is affected by cultural factors, personal preferences, experiences, and expectations.  So human scale in architecture can also describe buildings with sightlines, acoustic properties, task lighting, ambient lighting, and spatial grammar that fit well with human senses. However, one important caveat is that human perceptions are always going to be less predictable and less measurable than physical dimensions.

Human scale in architecture is deliberately violated:

* for monumental effect.  Buildings, statues, and memorials are constructed in a scale larger than life as a social/cultural signal that the subject matter is also larger than life.  One extreme example is the [[The Motherland Calls|Rodina (Motherland) statue]] in [[Volgograd]].
* for aesthetic effect.  Many architects, particularly in the [[Modernist]] movement, design buildings that prioritize structural purity and clarity of form over concessions to human scale.  This became the dominant American architectural style for decades.  Some notable examples among many are [[Henry N. Cobb|Henry Cobb]]'s [[200 Clarendon Street|John Hancock Tower]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], much of [[I. M. Pei]]'s work including the [[Dallas City Hall]], and [[Mies van der Rohe]]'s [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] in [[Berlin]].
* to serve automotive scale.  Commercial buildings that are designed to be legible from roadways assume a radically different shape.  The human eye can distinguish about 3 objects or features per second.{{citation needed|reason=I was unable to find a reliable source supporting this. They mostly point back to this very entry.|date=April 2015}}  A pedestrian steadily walking along a {{convert|30|m|ft|adj=on|sigfig=1}} length of department store can perceive about 68 features; a driver passing the same frontage at {{convert|50|km/h|m/s mph|abbr=on}} can perceive about six or seven features.  Auto-scale buildings tend to be smooth and shallow, readable at a glance, simplified, presented outward, and with signage with bigger letters and fewer words.  This urban form is traceable back to the innovations of developer A. W. Ross along [[Miracle Mile, Los Angeles, California|Wilshire Boulevard]] in Los Angeles in 1920.

== Common sense and human scale ==

"[[Common sense]]" ideas tend to relate to events within human experience, and thus commensurate with these scales. There is thus no commonsense intuition of, for example, interstellar distances or speeds approaching the speed of light.

[[Weights and measures]] tend to reflect human scale, and many older systems of measurement featured units based directly on the dimensions of the body, such as the [[foot (unit)|foot]] and the [[cubit]]. The [[metric system]], which is based on precisely reproducible and measurable physical quantities such as the speed of light, still attempts to keep its base units within the range of human experience.  Systems of natural units (such as [[Planck units]]) are useful in theoretical physics, but are not suitable for everyday purposes; because the [[SI]] units are defined in terms of constants of nature they can be thought of as natural units rescaled to human proportions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60348">&lt;!-- I'm commenting out the following image box because the article Capital_punishment_in_Mongolia lists the same picture as being of a woman awaiting trial rather than a woman already sentenced to death.  [[File:Mongolian woman condemned to die of starvation (retouched).jpg|thumb|right|A woman [[Capital punishment in Mongolia|condemned to death in Mongolia]] in 1913 is seen from the porthole of a crate inside which she is encumbered and left to die of starvation.]] --&gt;
'''Immurement''' (from Latin ''im-'' "in" and ''murus'' "wall"; literally "walling in") is a form of imprisonment, usually for life, in which a person is placed within an enclosed space with no exits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/immure Definition of Immurement]&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes instances where people have been enclosed in extremely tight confinement, such as within a coffin. When used as a means of [[execution]], the prisoner is simply left to die from [[starvation]] or [[dehydration]]. This form of execution is distinct from [[premature burial|being buried alive]], in which the victim typically dies of [[asphyxia]]tion.

Some examples of immurement as an established execution practice (with death from thirst or starvation as the intended aim) are attested. Roman [[Vestal Virgins]] could face immurement as punishment if they broke their vows of chastity, and immurement has been well established as a punishment of robbers in [[Persia]], even into the early 20th century. Some ambiguous evidence exists of immurement as a practice of coffin-type confinement in [[Mongolia]].

However, isolated incidents of immurement, rather than elements of continuous traditions, are attested or alleged from numerous parts of the world as well, and some of these notable incidents are included. Instances of immurement as an element of massacre within the context of war or revolution are also noted. Immuring living persons as a type of human sacrifice is also reported, for example, as part of grand burial ceremonies in some cultures.

As a motif in legends and folklore, many tales of immurement exist. In the folklore, immurement is prominent as a form of [[capital punishment]], but its use as a type of [[human sacrifice]] to make buildings sturdy has many tales attached to it as well. Skeletal remains have been, from time to time, found behind walls and in hidden rooms and on several occasions have been asserted to be evidence of such sacrificial practices or of such a form of punishment.

==History==

===Method of execution===
{{cleanup section|reason=poor syntax, poor structure|date=September 2014}}

There is a difference between a form of execution established as a tradition (for example, one crystallized into formal law), and isolated incidents of immurement. This section illustrates that distinction. Furthermore, incidents at war time are explored separately.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

====Established practice====
=====Vestal Virgins in ancient Rome=====
The [[Vestal Virgin]]s in ancient Rome constituted a class of priestesses whose principal duty was to maintain the sacred fire dedicated to [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] (goddess of the home and the family), and they lived under a strict vow of chastity and celibacy. If that vow of chastity was broken, the offending priestess was immured alive as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''Smith,'' (1846), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PeYRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA353 p.353]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|When condemned by the college of pontifices, she was stripped of her vittae and other badges of office, was scourged, was attired like a corpse, placed in a close litter, and borne through the forum attended by her weeping kindred, with all the ceremonies of a real funeral, to a rising ground called the Campus Sceleratus, just within the city walls, close to the Colline gate. There a small vault underground had been previously prepared, containing a couch, a lamp, and a table with a little food. The pontifex maximus, having lifted up his hands to heaven and uttered a secret prayer, opened the litter, led forth the culprit, and placing her on the steps of the ladder which gave access to the subterranean cell, delivered her over to the common executioner and his assistants, who conducted her down, drew up the ladder, and having filled the pit with earth until the surface was level with the surrounding ground, left her to perish deprived of all the tributes of respect usually paid to the spirits of the departed}}
The order of the Vestal Virgins existed for about 1,000 years, but only about 10 effected immurements are attested in extant sources.&lt;ref&gt;''Dowling'' (2001), [http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSAO&amp;Volume=4&amp;Issue=1&amp;ArticleID=14 Vestal Virgins-Chaste keepers of the flame]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====In Persia=====
A tradition existed in Persia of walling up criminals and leaving them to die of hunger or thirst. The traveller M. A. Hume-Griffith stayed in Persia from 1900 to 1903, and she wrote the following:&lt;ref&gt;''Hume-Griffith'' (1909), [https://archive.org/stream/behindveilinpers00humeuoft#page/138/mode/2up p.138-139]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Another sad sight to be seen in the desert sometimes, are brick pillars in which some unfortunate victim is walled up alive...The victim is put into the pillar, which is half built up in readiness; then if the executioner is merciful he will cement quickly up to the face, and death comes speedily. But sometimes a small amount of air is allowed to permeate through the bricks, and in this case the torture is cruel and the agony prolonged. Men bricked up in this way have been heard groaning and calling for water at the end of three days}}
Travelling back and forth to Persia from 1630 to 1668 as a gem merchant, [[Jean Baptiste Tavernier]] observed much the same custom that Hume-Griffith noted some 250 years later. Tavernier notes that immuring was principally a punishment for thieves, and that immurement left the convict's head out in the open. According to him, many of these individuals would implore passersby to cut off their heads, an amelioration of the punishment forbidden by law.&lt;ref&gt;''Tavernier, Phillips'' (1678), [https://archive.org/stream/sixvoyagesJohnB00Tave#page/232/mode/2up p.233]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Fryer (FRS)|John Fryer]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/freyer-john-writer-and-doctor John Fryer]&lt;/ref&gt; travelling Persia in the 1670s writes the following:&lt;ref&gt;''Fryer'' (1698), [https://books.google.com/books?id=CrYIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA318 p.318]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|From this Plain to [[Lorestan Province|Lhor]], both in the Highways, and on the high Mountains, were frequent Monuments of Thieves immured in Terror of others who might commit the like Offence; they having literally a Stone-[[Doublet (clothing)|Doublet]], whereas we say metaphorically, when any is in Prison, ''He has it Stone Doublet on''; for these are plastered up, all but their Heads, in a round Stone Tomb, which are left out, not out of kindness, but to expose them to the Injury of the Weather, and Assaults of the Birds of Prey, who wreak their Rapin with as little Remorse, as they did devour their Fellow-Subjects.}} 
Staying as a diplomat in Persia from 1860–63, [[Edward Backhouse Eastwick|E. B. Eastwick]] met at one time, the [[Sardar|Sardar i Kull]], or military high commander, Aziz Khan. Eastwick notes that he "did not strike me as one who would greatly err on the side of leniency". Eastwick was told that just recently, Aziz Khan had ordered 14 robbers walled up alive, two of them head-downwards.&lt;ref&gt;''Eastwick'' (1864), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PVYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA186 p.186]&lt;/ref&gt; Staying for the year 1887–1888 primarily in [[Shiraz]], [[Edward Granville Browne]] noted the gloomy reminders of a particularly bloodthirsty governor there, Firza Ahmed, who in his four years of office (ending ''circa'' 1880), had caused, for example, more than 700 hands cut off for various offences. Browne continues:&lt;ref&gt;''Browne'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BerYAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA118 p.117-118]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Besides these minor punishments, many robbers and others suffered death; not a few were walled up alive in pillars of mortar, there to perish miserably. The remains of these living tombs may still be seen outside ''Derwaze-i-kassah-khane'' ("Slaughter-house Gate") at Shiraz, while another series lines the road as it enters the little town of [[Abadeh|Abade]]...}}

=====Mongolia=====
[[File:Mongolian woman condemned to die of starvation (retouched).jpg|thumb|A [[Mongolia]]n woman condemned to die {{citation needed|reason=A source is needed to validate whether this was a death sentence|date=March 2016}} of immurement, c. 1913]]
Immurement was [[Capital punishment in Mongolia|practiced in Mongolia]] as recently as the early 20th century. It is not clear that all thus immured were meant to die of starvation. In a newspaper report from 1914, it is written:&lt;ref&gt;''New Zealand Herald'' (1914), [http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=NZH19140217.2.66 p.7]&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|..the prisons and dungeons of the Far Eastern country contain a number of refined Chinese shut up for life in heavy iron-bound coffins, which do not permit them to sit upright or lie down.

=====Neo-Assyrian vengeance=====
The [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] is infamous for its brutal repression techniques, not the least of those reasons being because several of its rulers congratulated themselves upon the vengeance they wrought by going into detail of how they dealt with their enemies. Here is a commemoration [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (r. 883–859 BC) made that includes immurement:&lt;ref&gt;''Kurkijan'' (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-xEyetzPPEC&amp;pg=PA17 p.17]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|I erected a wall in front of the great gate of the city. I flayed the chiefs and covered this wall with their skins. Some of them were walled in alive in the masonry; others were impaled along the wall. I flayed a great number of them in my presence, and I clothed the wall with their skins. I collected their heads in the form of crowns, and their corpses I pierced in the shape of garlands... My figure blooms on the ruins; in the glutting of my rage I find my content}}

=====Revolution at Corfu=====
In book 3 of his ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', [[Thucydides]] goes into great detail on the revolution that broke out at [[Corfu]] in 427 BC. Book three, chapter 81, passage five reads as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''Thucydides'', [http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/GreekScience/Thuc.+3.69-85.html%20Thuc.%203.69-85:Civil%20War%20at%20Corcyra 3.81.5]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Death thus raged in every shape; and, as usually happens at such times, there was no length to which violence did not go; sons were killed by their fathers, and suppliants dragged from the altar or slain upon it; while some were even walled up in the temple of Dionysus and died there.}}

====Notable incidents====
=====Execution of Livilla=====
[[Livilla]], a member of the imperial dynasty under [[Emperor Tiberius]], was condemned in AD 31 for being complicit in the plot [[Sejanus]] staged to overthrow the Emperor. According to [[Cassius Dio]], Tiberius handed Livilla over to her mother, [[Antonia Minor]], who locked her own daughter in the bedroom, ensuring that she starved to death.&lt;ref&gt;''Varner'' (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=5IpPhTqnDJkC&amp;pg=PA93 p.93-94]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Death of an emperor=====
[[Basiliscus|Flavius Basiliscus]], emperor in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] from AD 475-476, was deposed. In winter he was sent to [[Cappadocia]] with his family, where they were imprisoned in either a dry cistern,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Sarris opts for freezing to death, rather than death by starvation ''Sarris'' (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=d6OMefsyv_EC&amp;pg=PT252 p.252]&lt;/ref&gt; or a tower,&lt;ref&gt;Evagrius (2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=YP9cuh3KX3wC&amp;pg=PA143 p.143, footnote 31]&lt;/ref&gt; and perished. The historian Procopius said they died exposed to cold and hunger,&lt;ref&gt;''Procopius'' (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iH1L6UE5_e4C&amp;pg=PA71 p.71]&lt;/ref&gt; while other sources, such as [[Priscus]], merely speaks of death by starvation.&lt;ref&gt;''Rohrbacher'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=VnaF58VDxzAC&amp;pg=PA89 p.89]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Patriarch and the doge=====
The [[patriarch of Aquileia]], [[Poppo of Treffen]] (r. 1019–1045) was a mighty secular potentate, and in 1044 he sacked [[Grado, Friuli-Venezia Giulia|Grado]]. The newly elected [[Doge of Venice]], [[Domenico I Contarini]], captured him and allegedly let him be buried up to his neck, and left guards to watch over him until he died.&lt;ref&gt;''Hübner'' (1700), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kN4GAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PP718 p.590]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====England=====
[[Maud de Braose]] and her son, William, were imprisoned and starved to death under [[John, King of England]], after de Braose accused John of murdering his nephew.
&lt;ref&gt;Histoire des Ducs de Normandie et des Rois d'Angleterre, pp.112-5&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Moravia=====
In 1149 Duke [[Otto III of Olomouc]] of the [[Moravia]]n [[Přemyslid dynasty]] immured the abbot Deocar and 20 monks in the [[refectory]] in the monastery of [[Hradisko Monastery|Rhadisch]], where they starved to death. Ostensibly this was because one of the monks had fondled his wife Duranna when she had spent the night there. However, Otto III confiscated the monastery's wealth, and some said this was the motive for the immurement.&lt;ref&gt;''Wekebrod'' (1814), [https://books.google.com/books?id=djECAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA118 p.118-119]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Paederasts in the Perlachturm=====
[[File:Augsburg-Perlachkirche.jpg|thumb|Perlachturm with [[St. Peter am Perlach|St.&amp;nbsp;Peter by Perlach]]]]
The actual punishment meted out to men found guilty of [[Paederasty|paederasty]] (homosexual intercourse with boys) might vary between different status groups. In 1409 and 1532 in [[Augsburg]], two men were burned alive for their offences, but a rather different procedure was meted out to four clerics in the 1409 case, guilty of the same offence. Instead of being burned alive, they were locked into a wooden casket that was hung up in the [[Perlachturm]], and they starved to death.&lt;ref&gt;''Osenbrüggen'' (1860), [https://books.google.com/books?id=X9NCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA290 p.290]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Guillaume Agassa=====
After confessing in an Inquisition Court to an alleged conspiracy involving lepers, the Jewry, the King of Granada and the Sultan of Babylon, Guillaume Agassa, head of the leper asylum at Lestang, was condemned in 1322 to be immured in shackles for life.&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Ginzburg, ''Ecstasies'', 43&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Elizabeth Báthory{{discuss}}=====
{{Main|Elizabeth Báthory}}
[[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] [[countess]] Elizabeth Báthory de Ecsed (''Báthory Erzsébet'' in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]];  7 August 1560 – 21 August 1614) was immured in a set of rooms in 1610 for the death of several girls, with figures being as high as several hundred, though the actual number of victims is uncertain. Being labeled the most prolific female serial killer in history has earned her the nickname of the "Blood Countess", and she is often compared with [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad III the Impaler]] of [[Wallachia]] in [[folklore]]. She was allowed to live in immurement until she died, four years after being sealed, ultimately dying of causes other than starvation; evidently her rooms were well supplied with food.

=====Fugitive royal family from the Mughal Empire=====
In the late 1650s, various sons of the [[Mughal emperors|Mughal emperor]] [[Shah Jahan]] became embroiled in wars of succession, in which [[Aurangzeb]] was victorious. One of his half-brothers, [[Shah Shuja (Mughal)|Shah Shujah]] proved particularly troublesome, but in 1661 Aurangzeb defeated him, and Shah Shuja and his family sought the protection of the King of [[Rakhine State|Arakan]]. According to [[Francois Bernier]], the King reneged on his promise of asylum, and Shuja's sons were decapitated, while his daughters were immured, and died of starvation.&lt;ref&gt;''Bernier'' (1916), [https://archive.org/stream/travelsinmogulem00bernuoft#page/114/mode/2up p.114-115]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Jezzar Pasha, the tyrant at Beirut=====
[[Jezzar Pasha]], the Ottoman governor of provinces in modern Lebanon, and Palestine from 1775 to 1804, was infamous for his cruelties. When building the new walls of [[Beirut]], he was charged, inter alia, with the following:&lt;ref&gt;''de Tott'' (1786), [https://books.google.com/books?id=6oc2AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA97 p.97]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|..and this monster had taken the name of Dgezar (Butcher) as an illustrious addition to his title.

=====Moroccan serial killer=====
In a newspaper clipping from 1906, the fate of a cobbler from [[Marrakesh]] who was found guilty of murdering 36 women (the bodies were found buried underneath his shop and in his garden) is recounted. In order to deter others from similar heinous crimes, he was sentenced to be walled up alive. For two days after his immurement his screams were heard incessantly, but from the third day, all was silent from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cute news|work=''The St.John''|date=September 8, 1906|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=38&amp;dat=19060908&amp;id=Syg1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SikDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3044,4436382|page=13|title=Tempering Justice in America; Making it Cruel Abroad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Sons of Sikh Guru Gobind Singh=====
During the battle against Wazir Khan, [[Guru Gobind Singh]]'s two elder sons died and the two younger ones, aged nine and seven, were bricked up alive in Wazir Khan's palace.

===Human sacrifice===

====Entombed with the deceased====
In several cultures, it is attested that living persons were entombed along with a deceased person, as part of the funerary ritual. Some such borderline cases between [[buried alive]] and immurement are included here.

=====Excavations at Ur=====
In the ancient [[Sumer|Sumerian]] city of [[Ur]] some graves (as early as 2500 BC.) clearly show the burial of attendants, along with that of the principal dead person. In one such grave, Gerda Lerner writes:
{{quote|The human sacrifices were probably first drugged or poisoned, as evidenced by a drinking cup near each body, then the pit was immured, and covered with earth&lt;ref&gt;''Lerner'' (1986), [https://books.google.com/books?id=szm-8WgGjWgC&amp;pg=PA60 p.60]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=====China=====
In 102 BC, the [[Qin Shi Huang]] died, and all the imperial concubines and the artisans who had worked on the mausoleum were immured alive along with him.&lt;ref&gt;''Taylor'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=63tYpCw4nIYC&amp;pg=PA25 p.25]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Burial of a Mongol Khan=====
The 14th century traveller [[Ibn Batuta]] observed once the burial of a great khan, and writes the following, pertinent to immurement:&lt;ref&gt;''Batuta, Lee'' (1829), [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=220&amp;id=wjAtGKM_-WIC p.220]&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The Khan who had been killed, with about a hundred of his relatives, was then brought, and a large sepulchre was dug for him under the earth, in which a most beautiful couch was spread, and the Khan was with his weapons laid upon it. With him they placed all the gold and silver vessels he had in his house,' together with four female slaves, and six of his favourite [[Mamluk]]s, with a few vessels of drink. They were then all closed up, and the earth heaped upon them to the height of a large hill.}}

=====The Bonny Widows in Africa=====
[[Harold Edward Bindloss]], in his 1898 non-fiction "In the Niger country" writes the following transpiring when a great chief died:
{{quote|Only a few years ago, when a powerful headman died not very far from [[Bonny, Nigeria|Bonny]], several of his wives had their legs broken, and were buried alive with him&lt;ref&gt;''Bindloss'' (1898), [https://archive.org/stream/innigercountry00bind#page/168/mode/2up p.169]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Other types of human sacrifice====
=====Sun festival among Incas=====
Within [[Inca culture]], it is reported that as one element in the great Sun festival was the sacrifice of young maidens (between ten and twelve years old), who after their ceremonial duties done were lowered down in a waterless [[cistern]] and were immured alive.&lt;ref&gt;''French'' (2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=_ACqBJczrO8C&amp;pg=PA78 p.78]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asceticism/Religious practice===

====Anchorites====
A particularly severe form of [[asceticism]] within Christianity is that of [[anchorites]], who typically allowed themselves to be immured, and subsisting on minimal food. For example, in the 4th century AD, one nun named "Alexandra immured herself in a tomb for ten years with a tiny aperture enabling her to receive meager provisions...[[Saint Jerome]] (ca.340-420) spoke of one follower who spent his entire life in a cistern, consuming no more than five figs a day".&lt;ref&gt;''O'Reilly'' (2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=T-9vsaISVKsC&amp;pg=PA180 p.180]&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Vade in pace''====
[[File:Die eingemauerte Nonne.jpg|thumb|Immurement of a nun (fictitious depiction in a painting from 1868)]]
In Catholic monastic tradition, there existed a type of enforced, lifelong confinement against nuns or monks who had broken their vows of chastity, or espoused heretical ideas, and some have believed that this type of imprisonment was, indeed, a form of immurement. The judgment was preceded by the phrase "''vade in pacem''", that is, "go ''into'' peace", rather than "go ''in'' peace". (Latin "in" can be translated to English as either "in" or "into", depending on the case of its object—ablative for "in" or accusative for "into".) As [[Henry Charles Lea]] puts it, the tradition seems to have been that of complete, utter isolation from other human beings, but that food was, indeed, provided:&lt;ref&gt;''Lea'' (2012), [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/39451/39451-h/39451-h.htm#FNanchor_444_444 p.487]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|In the case of Jeanne, widow of B. de la Tour, a nun of Lespenasse, in 1246, who had committed acts of both [[Cathar]]an and [[Waldensian]] heresy, and had prevaricated in her confession, the sentence was confinement in a separate cell in her own convent, where no one was to enter or see her, her food being pushed in through an opening left for the purpose—in fact, the living tomb known as the "''in pace''."}}
In the footnote appended to this passage, Lea writes:&lt;ref&gt;''Lea'' (2012), [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/39451/39451-h/39451-h.htm#Footnote_444_444 footnote 444]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The cruelty of the monastic system of imprisonment known as in pace, or vade in pacem, was such that those subjected to it speedily died in all the agonies of despair. In 1350 the Archbishop of Toulouse appealed to King John to interfere for its mitigation, and he issued an Ordonnance that the superior of the convent should twice a month visit and console the prisoner, who, moreover, should have the right twice a month to ask for the company of one of the monks. Even this slender innovation provoked the bitterest resistance of the Dominicans and Franciscans, who appealed to Pope Clement VI., but in vain}}
Although the "Vade in Pace" tradition therefore seems to one of perpetual, aggravated confinement, but not immurement where the individual was meant to starve to death, several have thought "vade in pace" was just that, a death sentence. For example, Sir Walter Scott, himself an antiquarian, notes in a remark to his poem ''Marmion'' (1808):&lt;ref&gt;''Scott'' (1833), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Sk9AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA392 p.392]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It is well known, that the religious, who broke their vows of chastity, were subjected to the same penalty as the Roman Vestals in a similar case. A small niche, sufficient to enclose their bodies, was made in the massive wall of the convent ; a slender pittance of food and water was deposited in it and the awful words ''Vade in pace'', were the signal for immuring the criminal. It is not likely that, in latter times, this punishment was often resorted to; but, among the ruins of the [[Coldingham Priory|abbey of Coldingham]] were some years ago discovered the remains of a female skeleton which, from the shape of the niche, and the position of the figure seemed to be that of an immured nun}}
The practice of immuring nuns or monks on breaches of chastity has a long history, and Francesca Medioli writes the following in her essay "Dimensions of the Cloister":&lt;ref&gt;''Medioli, Schutte, Kuehn, Menchi'' (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=1TVrePw1sq4C&amp;pg=PA170 p.170-171]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|At Lodi in 1662 Sister Antonia Margherita Limera stood trial for having introduced a man into her cell and entertained him for a few days; she was sentenced to be walled in alive on a diet of bread and water. In the same year, the trial for breach of enclosure and sexual intercourse against the cleric Domenico Cagianella and Sister Vinzenza Intanti of the convent of San Salvatore in Ariano had an identical outcome}}

====Japanese suicide tradition====
{{Main|Buddhist mummies}}
[[Emile Durkheim]] in his work ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' writes the following about certain followers of [[Amida Buddha]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Durkheim'' (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=v23YleX1UskC&amp;pg=PA224 p.224]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The sectarians of Amida have themselves immured in caverns where there is barely space to be seated and where they can breathe only through an air shaft. There they quietly allow themselves to die of hunger.}}

==Legend and folklore==

===Punishments in folklore===
[[File:Estonia Immuration02.JPG|thumb|Recreation of a sixteenth-century knight, who was believed to be immured in a wall of [[Kuressaare Castle]], [[Estonia]].]]

====Sweden, Finland and Estonia====
According to Finnish legends, a young maiden was wrongfully immured into the castle wall of [[Olavinlinna]] as a punishment for treason.  The subsequent growth of a [[rowan tree]] at the location of her execution, whose flowers were as white as her innocence and berries as red as her blood, inspired a ballad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.fi/en/olavinlinna_legends Olavinlinna Legends]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar legends stem from [[Haapsalu]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haapsalu.ee/index.php?lk=270&amp;show=375 The Immured Lady] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819143501/http://www.haapsalu.ee/index.php?lk=270&amp;show=375 |date=2009-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kuressaare]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aulik.se/Baltikumresan/Kuressaare/ppages/ppage6.htm The immured knight] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203100622/http://www.aulik.se/Baltikumresan/Kuressaare/ppages/ppage6.htm |date=2013-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Põlva]]&lt;ref&gt;"''Legend has it that a girl was immured in the wall of the church in a kneeling position and thus the place came to be called Põlva'' (the Estonian word põlv means knee in English).

====Latvia====
According to a [[Latvian people|Latvian]] legend as many as three people might have been immured in tunnels under the [[Grobiņa Castle]]. A daughter of a knight living in the castle did not approve of her father's choice of a young nobleman as her future husband. Said knight also pillaged surrounding areas and took prisoners to live in the tunnels, among these a handsome young man whom the daughter took a liking to, helping him escape. Her fate wasn't so lucky as the knight and his future son-in-law punished her by immuring her in one of the tunnels. Another nobleman's daughter and a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] soldier are also said to be immured in one of the tunnels after she had fallen in love with the Swedish soldier and requested her father to allow her to marry him. According to another legend a maiden and a servant have been immured after a failed attempt at spying on [[Germans]] wanting to know what their plans were for what is now Latvia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pasakas.net/teikas/vietas/g/grobinas-pils/ |title=Grobiņas pils |last=Jansone |first=Una |accessdate=November 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mughal Empire====
By popular legend, [[Anarkali]] was immured between two walls in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]] by order of Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] for having a relationship with crown prince Salim (later Emperor [[Jehangir]]) in the 16th century. A bazaar developed around the site, and was named [[Anarkali Bazaar]] in her honour.&lt;ref&gt;On Anarkali legend and tomb, [https://www.ualberta.ca/~rnoor/tomb_anarkali.html Anarkali's Tomb]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human sacrifice when constructing buildings===
A number of cultures have tales and ballads containing as a motif the sacrifice of a human being to ensure the strength of a building.

====South-Eastern Europe====
The folklore of many [[Southeastern Europe]]an peoples refers to immurement as the mode of death for the victim sacrificed during the completion of a construction project, such as a bridge or fortress (mostly real buildings). The [[Rozafa Castle|Castle of Shkodra]] is the subject of such stories in both the [[Albanian Mythology|Albanian oral tradition]] and in the [[Serbian epic poetry|Slavic one]]: in the Albanian version, three brothers uselessly toiled at building walls that disappeared at night: when told that they had to bury one of their wives in the wall, they pledge to choose the one that will bring them lunch the next day, and not to warn their respective spouse. Two brothers do, however (the topos of two fellows betraying one is common in Balkan poetry, cfr. [[Miorița]] or the [[Song of Çelo Mezani]]), leave Rozafa, the wife of the honest brother, to die. She accepts her fate, but asks to leave exposed her foot (to rock the infant son's cradle), the breast (to feed him) and the hand (to stroke his hair). The Serbian version is [[The Building of Skadar]], and differs on a few details (the name "Rozafa" and the topic of betrayal are absent). A very similar Romanian legend, that of [[Meşterul Manole]], tells of the building of the [[Curtea de Argeş Cathedral|Curtea de Argeş Monastery]]: ten expert masons, among whom Master Manole himself, are ordered by [[Neagu Voda]] to build a beautiful monastery, but incur the same fate, and decide to immure the wife who will bring them lunch. Manole, working on the roof, sees her approach, and pleads with God to unleash the elements, in order to stop her, but in vain: when she arrives, he proceeds to wall her in, pretending to be doing so in jest, with his wife increasingly crying out in pain and distress. When the building is finished, Neagu Voda takes away the masons' ladders, fearing they will build a more beautiful building, and they try to escape but all fall to their death.

Many other [[Bulgarian music|Bulgarian]] and [[Folklore of Romania|Romanian]] folk poems and songs describe a bride offered for such purposes, and her subsequent pleas to the builders to leave her hands and breasts free, that she might still nurse her child. Later versions of the songs revise the bride's death; her fate to languish, entombed in the stones of the construction, is transmuted to her nonphysical shadow, and its loss yet leads to her pining away and eventual death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Троица братя града градяха |last=Моллов |first=Тодор |publisher=LiterNet |date=14 August 2002 |accessdate=2007-05-19 |language=Bulgarian |url=http://liternet.bg/publish/tmollov/troica.htm }}  Examples of Bulgarian songs: [http://liternet.bg/folklor/sbornici/bnt/8/212.htm ''Three Brothers Were Building a Fortress''] recorded near [[Smolyan]], [http://liternet.bg/folklor/sbornici/bnt/4/119.htm ''Immured Bride''] recorded in [[Struga]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other variations include the Hungarian folk ballad "Kőmíves Kelemen" (Kelemen the Stonemason). This is the story of twelve unfortunate stonemasons tasked with building the [[Deva, Romania|fort of Déva]] (a real building). To remedy its recurring collapses, it is agreed that one of the builders must sacrifice his bride, and the bride to be sacrificed will be she who first comes to visit.&lt;ref&gt;Called "Clemens" in ''Eliade, Dundes'' (1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MDmGX5y40IwC&amp;pg=PA77 p.77]&lt;/ref&gt; In some versions of the ballad the victim is shown some mercy; rather than being trapped alive she is burned and only her ashes are immured.&lt;ref&gt;On the sacrifice, with ashes immured, see for example:''Mallows'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Yt1M3egMbWMC&amp;pg=PA219 p.219]&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Greece and Malta====
A Greek story "[[Bridge of Arta|The Bridge of Arta]]" ({{lang-el|Γεφύρι της Άρτας}}) describes numerous failed attempts to build a bridge in that city. A cycle whereby a team of skilled builders toils all day only to return the next morning to find their work demolished is eventually ended when the master mason's wife is immured.&lt;ref&gt;''Eliade, Dundes'' (1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MDmGX5y40IwC&amp;pg=PA75 p.75-76]&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many other European folktales, legend has it that a maiden was immured in the walls of [[Madliena]] church as a sacrifice or offering after continuous failed attempts at building it. The pastor achieved this by inviting all of the most beautiful maidens to a feast and the most beautiful one, Madaļa, falling into a deep sleep after he'd offered her wine from a "certain goblet".&lt;ref&gt;''Pozemovskis'', [http://www.pasakas.net/teikas/vietas/k/ka-celies-madlienas-nosaukums/%20 Kā cēlies Madlienas nosaukums]&lt;/ref&gt;


====Animal sacrifice====
Acknowledging the traditions of '''human''' sacrifice in the context of the building of structures within German and Slavic folklore, [[Jacob Grimm]] proffers some examples of the sacrifice of ''animals'' as well. According to him, within Danish traditions, a lamb was immured under an erected altar in order to preserve it, while a churchyard was to be ensured protection by immuring a living horse as part of the ceremony. In the ceremonies of erection of other types of constructions, Grimm notices that other animals were sacrificed as well, such as pigs, hens and dogs.&lt;ref&gt;''Grimm'' (1854), [https://books.google.com/books?id=jT0CAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1095 p.1095]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quarantine===
====Scotland====
There exist legends that the residents of [[Mary King's Close]] in Edinburgh had been immured and left to perish during an outbreak of the plague; however, this is considered to be untrue.

===Immured skeletons===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
In several places, immured skeletons have been found in buildings and ruins. Many of these finds have been asserted, at one time or another, to be evidence of a historical practice in consonance with the tales and legends of sacrificing human beings when constructing a building, or as being the remains of persons punished by immurement, or possibly, victims of murder.
;Thornton Abbey
[[File:Thornton Abbey Ruins.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of Thornton Abbey]]
In the ruins of [[Thornton Abbey]], [[Lincolnshire]], an immured skeleton was found behind a wall; along with a table, book and a candlestick. By some, he is believed to be the fourteenth abbot, immured for some crime he committed.&lt;ref&gt;''Dodsley'' (1744), [https://books.google.com/books?id=m29bAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA103 p.103]. On suspicion of it being the remains of the fourteenth abbot, [http://www.mspong.org/picturesque/thornton_abbey.html Thornton Abbey; and its "immured" Abbot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612063457/http://www.mspong.org/picturesque/thornton_abbey.html |date=2011-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Castle in Dublin
In 1755, it is reported that in a castle belonging to the [[Duke of Dorset]], the skeleton of a man was found behind the wall of a servant's room. No clothes were found, but a seal with a religious inscription was found, and the skeleton had a pair of wooden clogs on the feet. The author discusses the possibility of the person having been some sort of state prisoner immured, but opts for him being the victim of murder instead.&lt;ref&gt;''Urban'' (1755), [https://books.google.com/books?id=h3VIAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA211 p.211]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Cesvaine Palace, Latvia
[[File:Cesvaine.jpg|thumb|left|Cesvaine Palace]]
In 1778, when some reconstruction was done at [[Cesvaine Palace]], a skeleton in a woman's dress was found behind a wall. Old people assured the visitor August Hupel that she had been immured alive at the building of the castle, but Hupel regarded the whole story as rather fanciful, and remained skeptical.&lt;ref&gt;''Hupel'' (1782), [https://books.google.com/books?id=86lKAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA197 p.197]&lt;/ref&gt;
;The immured knight in Tiefburg, Handschuhsheim
In 1770, human remains were found at the medieval castle Tiefburg in what is now a quarter of [[Heidelberg]], then the village of Handschuhsheim.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Tiefburg (Handschuhsheim)|Tiefburg]]&lt;/ref&gt; Going down a winding stair, the castle owner noticed one wall sounded hollow, and called for a mason to break it open. Inside was a niche that contained a skeleton in full armour; at the opening, it fell together. The helmet still carried traces of [[gilding]], along with several sword strokes. It was assumed that the individual had been defeated in a feud, and had been immured alive at some remote time.&lt;ref&gt;''Schreiber'' (1811), [https://books.google.com/books?id=E34AAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA212 p.212]&lt;/ref&gt;
;The monk in Malmö
In the 1770s, [[Sir Nathaniel Wraxall, 1st Baronet]] toured countries like Sweden and Denmark, and wrote a memoir on his journeys. He was wholly displeased with his visit to [[Malmö]], and said the only thing of interest was that of the skeleton of a monk who had been immured in the church wall. According to tradition, the monk had been found guilty of fornication, and had lived nine days immured, having been fed eggs though a small hole.&lt;ref&gt;''Wraxall'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=Bo1CAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA65 p.65-66]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Immured coffins of infants
In 1686 [[Bremen]], when a 132-year-old city gate was rebuilt, a tiny coffin containing the skeletal remains of a child was found. A century earlier, in 1589, the city walls had been reconstructed. More than 200 years later, in 1812, there was discovered embedded in the walls some 50 tiny oak coffins. These were, however, empty.&lt;ref&gt;''Miesegaes'' (1829), [https://books.google.com/books?id=VSLTAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA182 p.182-183]&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Plesse Castle|Plesse castle]], close by Göttingen, a small child coffin with remains was found in the early 19th century. In 1819, when the city walls of [[Harburg (quarter)|Harburg]] were renewed, a whole series of child coffins were found, just as in the walls of Bremen. The coffins in Harburg, however, did contain skeletal remains. Several other such finds are attested.&lt;ref&gt;''Blumenbach, Spangenberg'' (1828), [https://books.google.com/books?id=uGcAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA268 p.268-282]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Seven Sleepers
One version of the legend of the [[Seven Sleepers]] alleges that during the [[persecution of Christians|persecutions]] by the Roman emperor [[Decius]], around 250 AD, seven young men were accused of following [[Christianity]]. They were given some time to recant their faith, but chose instead to give their worldly goods to the poor and retire to a mountain cave to pray, where they fell asleep. The emperor, seeing that their attitude towards [[paganism]] had not improved, ordered the mouth of the cave to be sealed.&lt;ref name=Fortescue&gt;{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|id=05496a|title=The Seven Sleepers of Ephesus|author=Fortescue, Adrian|author-link=Adrian Fortescue|accessdate=14 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others amongst many involve various tales in Christianity and Islam utilizing various cave sites.

===19th century===
;Walter Scott
In his 1808 poem [[Marmion (poem)|Marmion]], [[Walter Scott]] has as one of his motifs the immurement of the fictional nun, Clara de Clare, on grounds of unchastity. The stanza XXV reads:
{{quote|And now the blind old abbot rose, To speak the chapter's doom. On those the wall was to enclose, Alive, within the tomb}}
Scott, himself an antiquarian, believed that the Catholic Church in earlier times immured monks and nuns found guilty of breaking their vows of chastity, explains his belief in a note appended to the poem.&lt;ref&gt;See both stanza and note at, for example, ''Scott'' (1833), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Sk9AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA392 p.392]&lt;/ref&gt; 
;Edgar Allan Poe
This form of death appears in several of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s works, including "[[The Cask of Amontillado]]".  Montresor, the narrator, immures his enemy, Fortunato, within the [[catacombs]] beyond the wine cellar under his [[palazzo]].  In "[[The Black Cat (short story)|The Black Cat]]", the narrator's pet cat accidentally suffers immurement, but is discovered and rescued.  The cat's rescue leads to the discovery of the body of the narrator's wife, since the cat was walled in with it after the murder.&lt;ref&gt;For the Poe stories, see for example, ''Hayes'' (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=A5i95b_FHvoC&amp;pg=PA101 p.101]&lt;/ref&gt;
;William Harrison Ainsworth
In the opening of [[William Harrison Ainsworth]]'s, ''[[The Lancashire Witches]]'', John Paslew, the abbot of Whalley, reveals to his confessor that he conspired to have his rival for the position of abbot accused of witchcraft and immured in the walls of the abbey. The confessor then reveals himself to be the former rival, escapes from the immurement by consorting with dark powers, and returns to exact his vengeance on the abbot.
;Oscar Wilde
In "[[The Canterville Ghost]]" by [[Oscar Wilde]] it is implied that Sir Simon was immured by his wife's brothers after having killed his wife. When speaking to little Virginia Otis, the ghost remarks, "I don't think it was very nice of her brothers to starve me to death." His skeleton is found chained to the wall in a secret room of Canterville Chase.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''Wilde, Murray'' (1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=__pdWkR_WXQC&amp;pg=PA77 p.77]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Giuseppe Verdi
In [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Aida]]'', Radames is sealed in a vault at the Temple of Vulcan as punishment for treason.  His lover Aida, without his knowledge, has hidden herself in the vault so they can die together. Aida dies as the tomb is being sealed, with Radames awaiting his own death after the final curtain.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''Krehbiel'' (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=v12CCw-1R0gC&amp;pg=PA156 p.156]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catherine Michelle of Spain''' ({{Lang-es|Catalina Micaela de Austria}}; 10 October 1567 – 6 November 1597) was a Duchess consort of Savoy who served as Regent of Savoy several times during the absence of her spouse, [[Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy]]. As the youngest surviving daughter of [[Philip II of Spain]] and [[Elisabeth of Valois]], she was the sister of [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain|Isabella Clara Eugenia]], [[Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Joseph Pitts, ''Henri IV of France: His Reign and Age'', (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2009), 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Catalina Micaela of Spain by Alonso Sánchez Coello.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Infanta Catalina Micaela of Austria by [[Alonzo Sanchez Coello]]]]
Catherine Michelle was described as beautiful, intelligent, arrogant and well aware of her high social status. She had a good relationship with her father and exchanged letters with him after her marriage. Charles Emmanuel I suggested the marriage as a way of gaining Spanish support for his plans to expand Savoy on the coast of the then weakened France. The wedding took place in Zaragoza on 11 March 1585 and the couple made their entrance to Turin in Savoy 10 August 1585.

Catherine Michelle was initially unpopular because of her arrogance and attempts to introduce Spanish pomp, ceremony and way of dress to the Court in Turin. However, she soon gained respect because of her political and diplomatic skill, which she used to defend the autonomy of Savoy against Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 22 (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; She refused the Spanish offer to install a Spanish garrison in Turin from Milan with the excuse of giving her a life guard.&lt;ref&gt;Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 22 (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; She is reported to have had great influence on Charles Emmanuel I and to have reformed him for the better. She also served as regent several times during the absence of the duke on military campaigns, such as during the Lyon campaign in 1594.&lt;ref&gt;Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 22 (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine Michelle also benefited cultural life in Savoy, founded many new buildings including an art gallery and invited several artists such as [[Torquato Tasso]], [[Chiabrera]], [[Marini]], [[Tassoni]] and [[Botero]].

Catherine Michelle died near the end of 1597; she had miscarried earlier that year. Her father died the following year. Her sister Isabella married [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria]], and later became [[Governess of the Netherlands]].

'''Italian submarine ''Gemma''''' was a {{sclass-|Perla|submarine|2}} built for the [[Royal Italian Navy]] (''Regia Marina'') during the 1930s. Her name in Italian means a [[gemstone]] or jewel.

==Design and description==
The ''Perla''-class submarines were essentially repeats of the preceding {{sclass-|Sirena|submarine|4}}. The modifications that were made compared to the boats of the previous series were mostly of upgrade nature. Among them were enlargement of the false tower at the top, more modern engines, installation of a radiogoniometer that could be controlled from inside the ship. Improvements and the installation of new air conditioning equipment meant a slight increase in displacement, and increase in the fuel stowage also increased the autonomy of these boats compared to the previous series.&lt;ref name=ISI1&gt;Pollina, p.155&lt;/ref&gt; Their designed full load [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|695|t|LT|sp=us}} surfaced and {{convert|855|t|LT|sp=us}} submerged, but varied somewhat depending on the boat and the builder. The submarines were {{convert|197|ft|6|in|m|sp=us}} long, had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|21|ft|m|sp=us}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|15|ft|m|sp=us}} to {{convert|15|ft|5|in|m|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=b4&gt;Bagnasco, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ISI&gt;Pollina, pp.152-153&lt;/ref&gt;

For surface running, the boats were powered by two [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]] with overall power of {{convert|675|-|750|hp|abbr=on|lk=in|0|adj=on}}.&lt;ref name=b4/&gt; When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|400|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|14|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|7.5|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the ''Perla'' class had a range of {{convert|5200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|8|kn}}, submerged, they had a range of {{convert|74|nmi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|4|kn}}.&lt;ref name=b4&gt;Bagnasco, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ISI/&gt;

The boats were armed with six internal {{convert|53.3|cm|in|1|abbr=on|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s, four in the bow and two in the stern. One reload torpedo was carried for each tube, for a total of twelve. They were also armed with one [[Škoda 10 cm K10#OTO 100.2F47 History|{{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on|0}}]] [[deck gun]] for combat on the surface. The light anti-aircraft armament consisted of one or two pairs of [[Breda Model 1931 Machine Gun|{{convert|13.2|mm|in|abbr=on}}]]  machine guns.&lt;ref name=ISI/&gt;

==Construction and career==
''Gemma'' was built by [[Cantieri Riuniti dell' Adriatico|CRDA]] at their shipyard in [[Monfalcone]], laid on 7 September 1935, [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 21 May 1936 and completed on 8 July 1936.&lt;ref name=ISI/&gt;

After delivery, ''Gemma'' was assigned to the 35th Squadron (III Submarine group) based at [[Messina]]. After a brief training, she carried out a long endurance cruise in the [[Dodecanese]] in the fall of 1936. She repeated the same endurance cruise in the [[Dodecanese]] in 1937.&lt;ref name="m2"&gt;[http://www.mucamonfalcone.it/aspx/ViewProspettazioneNave.aspx?idCon=1215&amp;idAmb=149&amp;idMenu=-1&amp;liv=0&amp;order=0&amp;tp=vArchivioNavi&amp;cosaCerca=gemma ''Gemma'' at Monfalcone Naval Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

From August 27 through September 5, 1937 ''Gemma'', under command of captain Carlo Ferracuti,  carried out a secret mission in the [[Strait of Sicily]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. She made three attempts to attack during this mission, but no actual attacks happened due to impossibility to identify the targets with certainty. Upon completion she returned to [[Augusta, Sicily|Augusta]].

In 1938, ''Gemma'' together with {{ship|Italian submarine|Perla||2}} were assigned to the [[Red Sea]] base of [[Massawa]] in [[Eritrea]].&lt;ref name=m2/&gt; In the spring of 1939 ''Gemma'' and {{ship|Italian submarine|Perla||2}} performed a cruise in the [[Indian Ocean]] to test the performance of the class in terms of sailing and operational capability in warm seas and during the monsoon season. The results were disappointing: it was discovered that stormy sea prevented the use of submarine's armament and made it very difficult even to remain at a periscope depth. There were also reports of malfunctioning air conditioning system, and leaks of [[chloromethane]] were reported.  In the fall of 1939 she came back to the [[Mediterranean]] and was assigned to the 14th Submarine Squadron (I Submarine group) based at [[La Spezia]]. In 1940 ''Gemma'' was reassigned to the 13th Submarine Squadron (I Submarine Group), but was operating from [[Leros]].

After [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]'s entrance into [[World War II]], ''Gemma'', under command of Guido Lanza Cordero di Montezemolo, was sent to patrol off [[Chios]]. She returned to her base on June 15 without encountering any traffic.

From June 30 through July 8, 1940 ''Gemma'' patrolled off [[Sollum]], and returned to her base without sighting any enemy ships.

From August 7 through August 16, 1940 she patrolled off Crete, but again without any success.

On September 30, 1940, ''Gemma'' sailed to her area of operation, located in the northern section of the Strait of Kasos, just east of [[Crete]]. {{ship|Italian submarine|Amethyst||2}} was deployed to the south of ''Gemma'', in the center of the Strait of Kasos, and further south, another submarine, {{ship|Italian submarine|Tricheco|1930|2}} under command of captain Alberto Avogadro di Cerrione, was deployed. ''Gemma'' arrived in the area on October 1 and was supposed to remain on station until October 8, but in the evening of October 3 she was ordered to patrol further east in the strait between [[Rhodes]] and [[Karpathos]]. On October 6, a new order was sent to ''Gemma'' telling her to return to the base, but due to a mix-up the message was never received by ''Gemma'' and she remained on her station. On October 7, ''Tricheco'' had a sick crew on board and had to return to [[Leros]]. On her return voyage she had to pass near the eastern coast of Karpathos, thus crossing an area where ''Gemma'' was stationed. Due to a mix-up and delay in communication, ''Tricheco'' was unaware of ''Gemma'''s location.

At 1:15 on Oct. 8, ''Tricheco'' sighted in the dark a silhouette of a submarine on the surface. Since it was impossible to recognize the nationality of a submarine at night, it was a normal practice to consider all unknown submarines enemies, unless a presence of a submarine was communicated to the captain. At 1:21 ''Tricheco'' launched two torpedoes from a short distance against an "enemy" ship.&lt;ref name=m2/&gt; ''Gemma'' was hit by both torpedoes right in the middle and immediately sank with the entire crew in the position {{Coord|35|30|N|27|18|E}} just off the coast of Karpathos.
Captain Cordero di Montezemolo, four other officers, and 39 other crew members went down with the boat.&lt;ref name=g5&gt;Giorgerini, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the disappearance of ''Gemma'' was attributed to British anti-submarine activity, as the October 8th radio news reported the loss of two enemy submarines with several survivors captured which gave families some hope. However, soon the coincidence between ''Tricheco'''s attack and the disappearance of ''Gemma'' became all too obvious. ''Gemma'' was declared as lost, and her crew was declared dead, rather than missing.

'''John F. Sheridan''' (1862 – November 2, 1914) was an American [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] in [[Major League Baseball]]. In his 30-year career as an official, he worked 18 seasons between 1890 and 1914 in three major leagues. Several of Sheridan's contemporaries considered him to be the best major league umpire. He pioneered the crouching stance used by modern umpires at home plate. In 1945, Sheridan was named to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946#The Roll of Honor|Roll of Honor]] of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]].

==Early life==
Sheridan was born in [[Decatur, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=Away&gt;{{cite news|title=John Sheridan called away|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19141103&amp;id=BYQWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7SAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3711,3436129|accessdate=September 2, 2014|work=[[The Milwaukee Journal]]|date=November 3, 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother Bridget was born in [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name=Bridget&gt;{{cite news|title=Death of Mrs. B. Sheridan|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1982&amp;dat=19090421&amp;id=JfcxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dOMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6723,4162226|accessdate=September 2, 2014|work=[[San Jose Evening News]]|date=April 21, 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his childhood, Jack's family moved to [[San Jose, California]], where he made his home thereafter. He enjoyed a brief career in the minor leagues as a [[second baseman]]. In 1883, Sheridan secured an advance of funds by convincing the manager of a [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]] minor league team that he would be an asset to the team. The manager was so disappointed in Sheridan's abilities that he took out an arrest warrant on the player. Sheridan was forced to repay the money he earned by working at a cigarette factory.&lt;ref name=Arrested&gt;{{cite news|title=Baseball owner had player arrested for lack of playing ability|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19400402&amp;id=lW5WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9OMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6806,494844|accessdate=September 2, 2014|work=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|date=April 2, 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; He turned to umpiring soon after traveling with a team of California players for an eastern tour.

==Career==
He began his career by umpiring in the Southern League in 1885, then officiated in the [[California League]] from 1886–89, after which he gained his first major league experience in the sole season of the [[Players' League]] in 1890. Nearly all games in that era used a single umpire, and the most outstanding officials generally moved from league to league, going wherever the league presidents were perceived as being most supportive, both in salary and in affirming the umpires' field authority. After returning to the California League for the 1891 season, Sheridan umpired in the [[National League]] in 1892, then again in the Southern League in 1893.

In 1894-95, he umpired in the [[Western League (1900–1958)|Western League]], where he first became associated with that league's president, [[Ban Johnson]]. Johnson was fiercely supportive of his umpiring staff, and apart from a brief return to the NL in 1896-97, Sheridan would remain an umpire in Johnson's league for the remainder of his career. In 1901, the Western League added several eastern cities and renamed itself the [[American League]], and through a series of signings of NL players successfully established itself as a rival major league. In contrast to the rowdier NL, where umpires were routinely subjected to great abuse with little backing from the league office, Johnson staunchly defended his field officials and insisted that players and local authorities maintain respect for them.

When he was not umpiring, Sheridan worked as an undertaker.&lt;ref name=Norwalk&gt;{{cite news|title=Tesreau wore Detroit uniform one afternoon|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1898&amp;dat=19120924&amp;id=FAcgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=umQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2088,1125033|accessdate=September 2, 2014|work=[[The Norwalk Hour]]|date=September 24, 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1905 newspaper article even described Sheridan as having announced his retirement to pursue undertaking in 1905.&lt;ref name=Hot&gt;{{cite news|title=Hot shot from Jack Sheridan|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19051231&amp;id=Uw8bAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DUkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2241,5964105|accessdate=September 2, 2014|work=[[The Pittsburgh Press]]|date=December 31, 1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 1906 season, Sheridan renewed his contract with the American League.&lt;ref name=Spokane&gt;{{cite news|title=Sheridan will umpire again|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1338&amp;dat=19060316&amp;id=7KlXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7vMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5156,5370965|accessdate=September 2, 2014|work=[[Spokane Daily Chronicle]]|date=March 16, 1906}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, Sheridan ejected outfielder [[Bill O'Neill (baseball)|Tip O'Neill]] after an argument and may have been indirectly responsible for the end of O'Neill's career. The outfielder was replaced by [[Patsy Dougherty|Pat Dougherty]], who won the position for the season. O'Neill did not play in the major leagues after that year.&lt;ref name=Eugene&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murphy|first1=Billy|title=Tribulations of an umpire|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19140919&amp;id=1FYUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=X_ADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6229,6531086|accessdate=September 2, 2014|work=[[Eugene Register-Guard]]|date=September 19, 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became the standard after which other umpires patterned themselves; after arriving in the AL at age 22 in 1906, [[Billy Evans]] regularly worked in a team with Sheridan for several years in order to study under the senior umpire, with Sheridan usually working behind the plate and Evans on the bases. Both Evans and fellow Hall of Famer [[Bill Klem]] regarded Sheridan as the game's greatest umpire. Many years later, Evans said, "Each day while working the bases I would follow every move of Sheridan, as he shifted his body and stance back of the plate to follow the flight of the ball."&lt;ref name=Montreal&gt;{{cite news|title=Billy Evans, ex-umpire, calls Jack Sheridan best of all time|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;dat=19440428&amp;id=0oAtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OZkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5622,4677374|accessdate=September 2, 2014|work=[[The Montreal Gazette]]|date=April 28, 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jack Sheridan at South Side Park.jpeg|thumb|230px|Sheridan at [[South Side Park]], 1905.]]
Sheridan umpired in four of the first seven [[World Series]]: [[1905 World Series|1905]], [[1907 World Series|1907]], [[1908 World Series|1908]] and [[1910 World Series|1910]]; he also umpired in the earlier [[Temple Cup]] NL championship series in 1896. In the winter of 1913–1914, he and Klem were the two umpires accompanying the [[Chicago White Sox]] and [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] on their world tour. Along with [[Bob Emslie]] and [[Tim Hurst]], he is one of only three umpires who umpired both before 1893, when the pitching distance was only 50 feet, and also after the NL and AL formally recognized one another as major leagues in 1903. He is the only umpire active prior to 1893 who went on to officiate in a World Series.

In September 1911, Sheridan asked Johnson for permission to permanently retire from umpiring. Johnson presented Sheridan with a medal of appreciation and said that while Sheridan would retire from the field, he expected the umpire to return to the league in an off-the-field capacity the next season.&lt;ref name=Medal&gt;{{cite news|title=Sheridan gets medal|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19110922&amp;id=NIMWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oSAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4734,2941050|accessdate=September 2, 2014|work=[[The Milwaukee Journal]]|date=September 22, 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1912, Sheridan said, "But I guess when the bell rings I'll be back in harness. Ban Johnson will need me when the fight grows hot."&lt;ref name=Evening&gt;{{cite news|title=Baseball Chatter|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1982&amp;dat=19120307&amp;id=3dFcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=R1kNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3576,6439582|accessdate=September 2, 2014|work=The Evening News (Providence)|date=March 7, 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; He umpired between June and August of that season.&lt;ref name=RS1912&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1912 AL Regular Season Umpiring Log for Jack Sheridan|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1912/IUsherj9010161912.htm|publisher=[[Retrosheet]]|accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Pittsburgh Press'' announced that Sheridan would retire before the 1913 season.&lt;ref name=Notes&gt;{{cite news|title=Baseball Notes|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19130405&amp;id=oMEaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JUkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2027,1036549|accessdate=September 2, 2014|work=[[The Pittsburgh Press]]|date=April 5, 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the umpiring staff in late June that year.&lt;ref name=RS1913&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1913 AL Regular Season Umpiring Log for Jack Sheridan|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1913/IUsherj9010171913.htm|publisher=[[Retrosheet]]|accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He suffered [[hyperthermia|sunstroke]] while umpiring a game at [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] in August 1914, and never fully recovered from the affliction. He called his last game on September 24 at Chicago, and despite the pleas of fellow officials insisted on remaining in the city for the crosstown series between the White Sox and Cubs before traveling to his home in California. Once there, his condition continued to deteriorate until he died three weeks later at age 52, at the San Jose home of his sister.

==Legacy==
The day after Sheridan died, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote that he was "the most famous and oldest diamond official before the public and was popular because of his well-known honesty and ability."

Over his 14 seasons as the dean of AL umpires, Sheridan became the prototype of the 20th century umpire. Whereas umpires in the 19th century had worked behind the plate in a standing position, believing that it helped them to better observe the flight of the ball, Sheridan established the practice of crouching while calling balls and strikes, a move which was quickly adopted universally due to its effectiveness. He was also remarkable in that he refused to use any sort of protection other than a mask.&lt;ref name=Human&gt;{{cite news|title=Human breastworks preferred by Jack Sheridan, veteran arbitrator|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19070818&amp;id=e7saAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xUgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4144,3435642|accessdate=September 2, 2014|work=[[The Pittsburgh Press]]|date=August 18, 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was agile enough to reportedly never be hit by a foul ball.

Sheridan was among the several umpires who were named to a [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946#The Roll of Honor|Roll of Honor]] by the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1946, at a time when no umpires had yet received full membership in the Hall. In the initial voting for induction of umpires in 1953, he finished third in the voting behind inductees Bill Klem and [[Tom Connolly|Tommy Connolly]], and was the only other candidate to receive a first-place vote.

'''Jane Elizabeth Lathrop Stanford''' (August 25, 1828 &amp;ndash; February 28, 1905) was a co-founder of [[Stanford University]] in 1885 (opened 1891) along with her husband, [[Leland Stanford]], as a memorial to their only child, [[Leland Stanford Jr.]], who died in 1884 at the age of 15.  After her husband's death in 1893, she funded and operated the university almost single-handedly until her mysterious death in 1905.

==Early life and marriage==
[[Image:MrandMrsLelandStanford1850.JPG|thumb|right|Portrait of [[Leland Stanford|Leland]] and Jane Stanford in 1850]]
Born '''Jane Elizabeth Lathrop''' in [[Albany, New York]], she was the daughter of shopkeeper Dyer Lathrop and Jane Anne (Shields) Lathrop.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of American Biography'', Vo. XVII, p. 502. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jane-stanford-bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Stanford: The woman behind Stanford University|url=http://janestanford.stanford.edu/biography.html|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=13 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521025646/http://janestanford.stanford.edu/biography.html|archivedate=21 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[The Albany Academy for Girls]], the longest running girls' day school in the country. She married [[Leland Stanford]] on September 30, 1850, and went to live with him in [[Port Washington, Wisconsin]], where he had practiced law since 1848.

The Stanfords lived in Port Washington until 1852 when his law library and other property were lost to fire; they then returned to Albany. Leland Stanford went to California to join his brothers in mercantile businesses related to the [[California Gold Rush]], while Jane remained in Albany with her family. He returned in 1855, and the following year they moved to [[San Francisco]], where he engaged in mercantile pursuits on a large scale. Stanford was a cofounder of the [[Central Pacific Railroad]], serving as its president from 1861 until his death in 1893. He was also president of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] from 1868 until ousted from the post by [[Collis Potter Huntington]] in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of American Biography'', Vol. XVII, pp. 502-504 passim.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stanford also served as [[Governor of California]] from 1862 to 1863, and one of [[List of United States Senators from California|California's United States senators]] from 1885 until his death in 1893.  After nearly 18 years of marriage, they finally had a child, a son, in 1868 when Jane Stanford was 39.&lt;ref name=jane-stanford-bio /&gt;

==Stanford University==
After the death of their only child [[Leland Stanford, Jr.]], in 1884 while on a trip in [[Italy]], the elder Leland turned to his wife and said "The children of California shall be our children." They then founded Leland Stanford Junior University in their son's honor. The university opened in 1891. After Leland's death on June 21, 1893, Jane in effect took control of the university. The university suffered severe financial hardship because of Leland's death, and the trustees advocated a temporary closure of the university until tax and legal issues could be resolved, but she insisted it remain in operation. Until the estate left probate in 1898 she paid for the university  out of her personal resources (as the widow she was allowed $10,000/month while the estate was in probate and she also attempted to sell her personal jewels).&lt;ref name=jane-stanford-bio /&gt;  As the remaining founder she wielded a great deal of legal control over the university until her death though she allowed the Board of Trustees greater authority after June 1, 1903.&lt;ref name=jane-stanford-bio /&gt;

It was at her direction that Stanford University gained an early focus on the arts. She also advocated the admission of women; the university had been coeducational since its founding.&lt;ref&gt;''The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography'', Vol. II, p. 129. New York: James T. White &amp; Company, 1899. Reprint of 1891 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of American Biography'', Vol. XVII, p. 504.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland Amory, ''Who Killed Society?'', pp. 432-433. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; She figured prominently in the issue of academic freedom when she sought and ultimately succeeded in having Stanford University economist [[Edward A. Ross]] fired for making speeches favoring Democrat [[William Jennings Bryan]] and favoring racism against Chinese American "coolies", outlining eugenics policies directed against Chinese people and other racial groups, and for his collectivist economic teachings. This case resulted in the [[American Association of University Professors]]' "Report on Academic Freedom and Tenure" of 1915, by [[Arthur Oncken Lovejoy]] and Edwin R. A. Seligman, and in the AAUP 1915 Declaration of Principles.

She traveled to [[London]] during 1897, the year of [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee]], hoping to find a buyer for her rubies and other jewels to raise funds for the university; however, she was not able to sell them at that time. In 1905 she directed the university trustees that after her death, her jewels should be sold and the funds used as a permanent endowment "...to be used exclusively for the purchase of books and other publications."&lt;ref name = "Stam"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stam|first=David H. |title=International Dictionary of Library Histories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pf8rV7tUCN8C&amp;pg=PA707&amp;lpg=PA707&amp;dq=%22lane+medical+library%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eTsMjZGW3_&amp;sig=I6HGVXVQpcSoQqTWGjqg2mj43jA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hT45UKXsFMH1ygGO94DYAw&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lane%20medical%20library%22&amp;f=false|volume=2|year=2001|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|location=Chicago|pages=707–708}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board of trustees confirmed this arrangement, and the Jewel Fund continues to add to the university's [[Stanford University Libraries|library collections]].

In 1905, Jane Stanford was at the center of one of America's legendary murder mysteries. She died of [[strychnine poisoning]] while on the island of [[Oahu]], in a room at the [[Moana Hotel]].{{refn | Today the room in which she stayed, number 120, no longer exists, having been incorporated into an expansion of the lobby.| group = note}}

On January 14, 1905, at her [[Nob Hill]] mansion in San Francisco, Stanford consumed [[Poland Spring|mineral water]] that tasted bitter.  She quickly forced herself to vomit the water (with prompting from and assistance by her maid) and, when both the maid and her secretary agreed that the bottled water tasted strange, sent it to a pharmacy to be analyzed. The findings, returned a few weeks later, showed that the water had been poisoned with a lethal dose of [[strychnine]].{{refn | The assay measured 0.8 [[Grain (unit)|grains]] (52 mg) per glass full (a fatal human dose for an adult can be as little as 30 mg&lt;ref name="Gossel1994"&gt;{{cite book|first1=T.

The water also contained the alkaloid [[brucine]] and other substances, suggesting that the source was a rodent poison derived from the tree ''[[Strychnos nux-vomica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2tRNXXjG9kEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=%22amount%20in%20excess%20of%20the%20dose%22 Cutler, 2003, p. 22]&lt;/ref&gt;| group = note}} Stanford moved out of her mansion,&lt;ref name=Cutler03/&gt; vowing never to return.&lt;ref name = "Morall1999"&gt;{{cite web

At the Moana Hotel on the evening of February 28, Stanford asked for [[sodium bicarbonate|bicarbonate of soda]] to settle her stomach.

&lt;blockquote&gt;As Humphris tried to administer a solution of [[bromide|bromine]] and [[chloral hydrate]],{{refn | [[Anticonvulsant]]s| group = note}} Mrs. Stanford, now in anguish, exclaimed, 'My jaws are stiff. This is a horrible death to die.' Whereupon she was seized by a [[Tetanic contraction|tetanic]] spasm that progressed relentlessly to a state of severe rigidity: her jaws clamped shut, her thighs opened widely, her feet twisted inwards, her fingers and thumbs clenched into tight fists, and her head drew back. Finally, her respiration ceased. Stanford was dead from strychnine poisoning.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The jury's quick verdict was to prove controversial.

==Memorials==

Jane Lathrop Stanford Middle School in the [[Palo Alto Unified School District]] was named after her in 1985.  The town of [[Lathrop, California]] in [[San Joaquin County, California|San Joaquin County]] was developed by her husband's railroad company in the late 1860s and named after Jane and her brother Charles Lathrop.

'''Luther Monroe Perkins''' (January 8, 1928 – August 5, 1968) was an American [[country music]] [[guitarist]] and a member of the [[Tennessee Three]], the backup band for singer [[Johnny Cash]]. Perkins was an iconic figure in what would become known as [[rockabilly]] music. His creatively simple, sparsely embellished, rhythmic use of [[Fender Esquire]], [[Jazzmaster]] and [[Fender Jaguar|Jaguar]] guitars is credited for creating Cash's signature "boom-chicka-boom" style.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.soundunwound.com/music/luther-perkins/234267 |title=Luther Perkins |publisher=Soundunwound: The Personal Music Encyclopedia |accessdate=2011-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and musical beginnings==

Perkins was born in [[Como, Mississippi]], the son of a [[Baptist]] preacher.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{citation |author=Miller, Stephen |title=Johnny Cash: The Life of an American Icon |year=2003 |publisher=Omnibus Press |ISBN=978-1-84449-414-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Como, Mississippi]], and taught himself to play rhythm guitar.

Perkins started his career in 1953 as a [[mechanic]] at Automobile Sales Company in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]. He specialized in electrical systems and radio repairs. Roy Cash, Sr., older brother of Johnny Cash, was service manager at the dealership. At the time, the younger Cash was stationed in [[Germany]] with the [[US Air Force]]. At Automobile Sales, Perkins met co-workers [[Marshall Grant]] and [[The Tennessee Three|A.W. 'Red' Kernodle]]. Grant, Kernodle and Perkins began bringing their guitars to work, and would play together when repair business was slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://countrymusic.about.com/od/allthingscash/a/40momentsjcash.htm |title=Top 40 Johnny Cash Moments |publisher=About.com |accessdate=2011-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Stories Done: Writings on the 1960s and its Discontents |author=Gilmore, Mikal |publisher=Free Press |page=187 |year=2008 |ISBN=978-0-7432-8745-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Johnny Cash moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] after returning from [[Germany]] in 1954, Roy Cash introduced him to Grant, Kernodle and Perkins. The four began to get together in the evenings at Perkins' or Grant's home and play songs. It was during this time that they decided to form a band, with Grant acquiring a [[string bass]], Kernodle a six-string [[steel guitar]], and Perkins buying a somewhat-abused [[Fender Esquire|Fender Esquire electric guitar]] from the O.K. Houck Piano Co. in Memphis.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.scottymoore.net/okhouck.html
|title= One of Rock 'n Roll's First Music Stores |publisher=ScottyMoore.net |accessdate=2011-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guitar had been modified by a previous owner, and the volume and tone controls did not work.

=="Boom-chicka-boom" style==

Since he could not control the volume of the single-[[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]] instrument, Perkins began the practice of muting the three bass strings (E, A and D) with the heel of his right hand, much in the style of [[Merle Travis]], and scratching a rhythm pattern (as heard on [[Sun Records]] recordings prior to 1958). This pattern developed into a more defined, varying 1/8-8/5/8-8 picking (with random [[syncopation]]) on later Sun recordings and for the rest of Perkins’ career.

In late 1954, when Cash got an audition with producer [[Sam Phillips]] at Sun Records, he brought Perkins, Grant and Kernodle along to back him instrumentally. The experience made Kernodle nervous, and he ended up leaving before the session was over, with Perkins and Grant providing the instrumentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.jcinfocenter.com/johnnycash/biography/ |title= Johnny Cash InfoCenter |accessdate=2011-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perkins, as a member of the Tennessee Two (later, the Tennessee Three, with the addition of drummer [[W.S. Holland|W.S. "Fluke" Holland]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.wsflukeholland.com/index.html
|title= W.S."Fluke" Holland-Father of the Drums |accessdate=2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; toured with Cash and appeared on most of his recordings. He was well known for his laconic, focused demeanor on stage. He was often the target of jokes by Cash, who would make comments such as "Luther's been dead for years, but he just doesn't know it".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/LutherPerkins1.html |title=Luther Played The Boogie |publisher=Rockabilly Hall of Fame |accessdate=2011-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perkins was Cash's lead guitarist on many of the popular [[Town Hall Party]] television appearances in the 1950s, often interacting with one another for stage effect and providing the signature "boom-chick-a-boom" background sound that came to define a large part of Johnny Cash's sound.  &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUdTcP-fs9g&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Perkins was married twice. He and his first wife, Bertie, separated while they were living in [[southern California]] in 1959. Perkins had three daughters: Linda, Vickie, and Claudia. He later married Margie Higgins; Margie Higgins' niece Kathy lived with them.&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;{{citation|title=I Was There When It Happened - My Life With Johnny Cash |author1=Grant, Marshall  |author2=Zar, Chris  |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Cumberland House |ISBN=978-1-58182-510-7 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margie Perkins Beaver still appears at Johnny Cash reunion events.

His hobbies were [[knitting]], [[fishing]] and [[guitar]].

He was a close friend of singer-songwriter [[Kris Kristofferson]]. At the time of his death, he was planning to open his own music publishing company and give Kristofferson his first break.&lt;ref name=Cash&gt;{{citation|author1=Cash, Johnny |author2=Carr, Patrick |title=Cash: The Autobiography |publisher=Harper |year=1998 |ISBN=978-0-06-101357-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perkins’ younger brother, Thomas, was a successful [[rock ‘n’ roll]] singer in the 1950s and 1960s, under the name of [[Thomas Wayne (singer)|Thomas Wayne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.somanyrecordssolittletime.com/?cat=1406 |title=Thomas Wayne Perkins |publisher=So Many Records, So Little Time |accessdate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography, Johnny Cash wrote that Perkins was mildly addicted to [[amphetamines]]. They started taking drugs together in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="Cash"/&gt;

Perkins' nickname was "L.M", the initials of his first and second name "Luther Monroe".&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; Singer-guitarist [[Carl Perkins]], who was also a member of Cash's touring show, was not related to Luther Perkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Man In Black |author=Cash, Johnny |publisher=Zondervan |year=1975 |ISBN=978-0-310-22322-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

During the early morning hours of August 3, 1968, Perkins returned from fishing on [[Old Hickory Lake]] to his newly constructed home on Riverwood Drive in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]]. He apparently went to sleep in the living room while holding a lit cigarette. His niece by marriage awoke around 6:00 am to find the living room in flames and Perkins collapsed near the door. An emergency crew rushed Perkins to [[Vanderbilt University]] Hospital, where he was kept in [[intensive care]] until he died on August 5, 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://tripatlas.com/Luther_Perkins |title= Luther Perkins |publisher= Tripatlas |accessdate= 2011-02-05 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His grave is near the graves of [[Johnny Cash]] and [[June Carter Cash]] at Hendersonville Memorial Park in Hendersonville, Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM31PQ
|title= Waymarking.com |accessdate=2011-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther Perkins was inducted into the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. Perkins is #0230.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Certificates.html|title=Rockabilly Hall of Fame Inductees |publisher=Rockabilly Hall of Fame |accessdate=2011-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Perkins's daughters from his first marriage filed suit against Johnny Cash for embezzling funds that were to have provided retirement income for Perkins. This lawsuit was filed coincidentally with actions taken by the other founding Tennessee Three member, Marshall Grant, against Cash for wrongfully firing Grant and embezzlement of Grant's retirement funds. Both lawsuits were eventually settled out-of-court.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt;

==''Walk the Line''==
In ''[[Walk The Line]]'', the 2005 biopic of Johnny Cash, Perkins is portrayed by [[Dan John Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk_the_Line#Cast}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perkins's future death is alluded to in the film in a bus scene where [[Johnny Cash|Cash]]  (played by [[Joaquin Phoenix]]) walks past a sleeping Perkins.  Perkins is depicted as asleep with his cigarette still burning in his mouth.  Cash stubs it out in the ashtray in front of him which foreshadows Perkins's eventual death.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4432">A '''maternity home,''' or maternity housing program, is a form of [[supportive housing]] provided to pregnant women.  Today’s maternity housing programs support a woman in need of a stable home environment to reach her goals in a variety of areas, not just pregnancy. In the past, many maternity homes had jailhouse aspects and forcibly institutionalized lower-class "fallen" unwed pregnant women. 
 
Maternity homes are not to be confused with [[maternity hospital]]s, or other facilities where women give birth. Another sort of temporary housing for pregnant women are the maternity hostels which have become widespread in countries [[Commercial surrogacy in India|such as India]] where commercial [[surrogacy]] is big business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DasGupta|first1=edited by Sayantani|last2=Dasgupta|first2=Shamita Das|title=Globalization and transnational surrogacy in India : outsourcing life|date=2014|isbn=9780739187425|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Maternity homes used to be known as homes for unwed mothers, as [[illegitimacy]] was (and in some places still is) a social taboo.

===United States===
{{See also|Pregnancy options counseling in the United States}}
[[The Salvation Army]] opened its first one in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/15/nyregion/community-no-shame-but-plenty-of-need-at-home-for-unwed-mothers.html|title=No Shame, but Plenty of Need, at Home for Unwed Mothers|last=Mansnerus|first=Laura|date=February 15, 1998|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include Bethany Home&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.qhpress.org/quakerpages/qwhp/bethany.htm|title=Bethany Home for Unwed Mothers, Minneapolis|website=www.qhpress.org|access-date=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Minneapolis, later renamed Harriet Walker Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://housesofworship.umn.edu/node/531|title=Bethany Home, Minneapolis {{!}} Houses of Worship|website=housesofworship.umn.edu|access-date=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prior to the 1980s, housing for pregnant women was offered in larger, institution-like settings that were strongly adoption-oriented. In these homes, confidentiality was a priority due to the social stigma around unwed births and the policies reflected the adoption laws and practices of the time.  It is from these settings that many of the misconceptions around maternity homes that continue to this day grew (e.g. forcing women into adoption, not allowing adoptive mothers to see their child, not providing any information about placement.) &amp;nbsp;

In the 1970s and 80s, the adoption process began to grow in flexibility (e.g. changes to father notification, no longer making short term placements of adopted babies into foster care, making use of probate court adoptions rather than solely via adoption agencies, increased inter-state adoptions.) &amp;nbsp;Offering a more flexible housing option via a new model paralleled the more flexible adoption process. &amp;nbsp;The large, institutional maternity homes began to close during this time.

In the early 1970s, Anne and Jim Pierson were pioneers in the host home model and publicly recognized by [[President Reagan]] for their family-style method of welcoming pregnant women. &amp;nbsp;Shepherding or host homes grew in popularity in the 1980s and 1990s as a new type of housing resource. &amp;nbsp;In this model, pregnant women in crisis pregnancies were housed within the spare bedrooms in the homes of passionate volunteers during their pregnancy. Several long-standing maternity homes used some version of a host home living environment as the launching point for developing a housing program. &amp;nbsp;Additionally, many founders of long-standing maternity homes (and other pregnancy help organizations) began by welcoming women into their own home.

===Ireland===
{{See also|Magdalene laundry}}
Some maternity homes, such as the [[Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home]] in [[Tuam]], were found to have provided highly substandard care.&amp;nbsp; 

===United Kingdom===
The [[American Red Cross]] sponsored maternity hostels in London after World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lost_Hospitals_of_London|url=http://ezitis.myzen.co.uk/americanrxmaternity.html|website=ezitis.myzen.co.uk|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mouse Hunt''''' is a 1997 American [[dark comedy]] [[slapstick]] [[film]] directed by [[Gore Verbinski]], written by [[Adam Rifkin]] and starring [[Nathan Lane]] and [[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]], and featured [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/335174/Mouse-Hunt/full-credits.html|title=Mouse Hunt|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|accessdate=July 4, 2016|location=[[Atlanta]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; who died shortly after the film was shot. It was the first family film to be released by [[DreamWorks|DreamWorks Pictures]].

In the story, two [[Laurel and Hardy]]-like brothers struggle against one small [[house mouse]] for possession of a house that was willed to them by their father. The intelligent and crafty mouse outwits them completely. The film is set in a humorously indeterminate 20th-century time period, with styles ranging from the 1940s to the 1990s.

==Plot==
When once-wealthy string magnate Rudolf Smuntz ([[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]]) dies, he leaves his outdated string factory and a run-down mansion to his two sons, Lars ([[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]]) and Ernie ([[Nathan Lane]]). When Lars refuses a proposal by representatives from the large Zeppco conglomerate to purchase their string factory due to a promise he made to his father, his self-centered, money-hungry wife April ([[Vicki Lewis]]) throws him out. Meanwhile, Ernie serves Mayor McKrinkle ([[Cliff Emmich]]) at his restaurant in anticipation of becoming a famous chef for serving such a high-profile guest. However, the mayor is poisoned by a [[cockroach]] (which came from Rudolf's old box of [[Cuban cigar]]s that Ernie took for himself) and suffers two heart attacks, with the latter fatal. As a result, Ernie's restaurant is closed down by the Board of Health. The despondent brothers encounter each other and find solace in their father's mansion.

Finding the mansion's blueprints, Ernie and Lars discover that it is a lost masterpiece designed by famous architect Charles Lyle LaRue, and could sell for a colossal fortune if properly restored. Multi-millionaire LaRue collector Alexander Falko ([[Maury Chaykin]]) makes a proposal, but Ernie refuses under the belief he and Lars can make a larger profit via auction. However, the brothers have already realized that the house has one stubborn occupant: a tiny and treacherous [[mouse]]. Lars is initially dismissive of the mouse but Ernie, fearing a repeat of the cockroach incident, is determined to rid the house of any vermin that could potentially ruin their plan.

When a single mousetrap proves to be useless against the mouse; Ernie and Lars try all sorts of tactics to kill the rodent, each of which fail spectacularly and damage the house even more. To make matters worse; the brothers are served with a repossession notice by the bank, which warns them that the house will face foreclosure unless they make an overdue mortgage payment of $1,200 within two days, which Ernie had borrowed against to purchase a jacuzzi tub, initially in the hope of raising the property value. They initially attempt to raise the money by withholding the pay of the workers at the factory, but this suggestion triggers an angry response from the workers who then go on strike. In desperation, Lars tries to run the factory on his own but ends up losing his clothes after accidentally feeding loose threads from each article of clothing into the machinery while damaging the machine's [[Fuse (electrical)#Fuse boxes|fuse box]]. He is then unexpectedly reunited with April, who has learned of the auction and the brothers' plans to get rich.

The brothers purchase a monstrous [[cat]] named "Catzilla" to deal with the mouse. Catzilla chases the mouse throughout the house while destroying everything, but gets tricked onto the house's dumbwaiter as the mouse sends him down to his demise. They then hire an eccentric [[pest control|exterminator]], Caesar ([[Christopher Walken]]), to handle the mouse; though he is severely injured after the mouse attaches him to the winch of his own truck which then violently drags him out of the house and destroys the floorboards and plumbing. Meanwhile, Ernie goes behind Lars' back and tries to revive the deal to sell the factory to Zeppco, but his meeting with them is thwarted when he is hit by a bus while trying to impress two attractive Belgian hair models, named Ingrid and Hilde. As Ernie is taken into hospital, Lars arrives and informs him that April has given them the $1,200 to pay off the mortgage.

After getting back to the house and witnessing the damage caused by Catzilla and Caesar, the brothers resume their task to get rid of the mouse. Ernie chases the mouse up a chimney and gets stuck; and Lars attempts to light a match while the mouse starts a gas leak, creating a violent explosion that blasts Ernie out of the chimney, while Lars is blasted into a china cabinet. Driven to the brink of insanity; Ernie takes a shotgun to shoot the mouse, only to accidentally shoot a compressed can of [[pesticide]] that Caesar dropped, igniting it and blowing a huge hole in the floor. The brothers then get into an argument after an answerphone message from Zeppco reveals Lars turning down their offer without telling Ernie, and Ernie attempting to sell the factory in secret, which results in Zeppco's proposal being withdrawn; which culminates with Lars throwing an [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] at Ernie which accidentally knocks the mouse [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]]. Unable to finish him off, they instead seal the mouse in a box and mail him to [[Fidel Castro]] in [[Cuba]]. The brothers quickly reconcile and finish renovating the house.

When the night of the auction arrives, Falko tries to get Ernie to call off the auction with a $10 million offer, but Ernie again refuses, and the auction soon begins. Meanwhile, Lars discovers the mouse's box in the snow returned due to insufficient postage (as he and Ernie forgot to weigh the package) and with a big hole gnawed through it. Lars and Ernie panic upon seeing the mouse return, but attempt to maintain their composure as the auction continues. The mouse also devours Rudolf's "lucky string," which he gave to the brothers before his death, making their vendetta even more personal. The brothers desperately attempt to flush out the mouse by feeding a garden hose into the wall. As the auction reaches a record $25 million bid, the house rapidly floods through the walls and the floors, causing everyone present to be washed out of the house as it collapses. The bidders leave, and April leaves Lars for good for a particularly rich bidder. The brothers' only consolation is the fact that the mouse must finally be dead as their father's "lucky string" is found in the wreckage, only to be quickly disappointed as they accidentally pull it in half.

With nowhere else to go, the brothers return to the factory and fall asleep, with only a single chunk of cheese for food. Having survived his apparent death and followed them on the underside of the car, the mouse restarts and feeds the cheese into the machinery inventing the world's first [[string cheese]], which inspires Ernie and Lars. Ernie and Lars end their war with the mouse and have successfully rebuilt the factory as a novelty string cheese company. Lars has begun a relationship with one of the Belgian hair models, Hilde, and Ernie puts his culinary skill to work in developing new cheese flavors with the mouse as his personal taste tester.

The film ends with the "lucky string" being shown placed in a wall next to Rudolf's portrait with a inscription of his motto: "A world without string is chaos."

==Reception==
''Mouse Hunt'' received mixed reviews from film critics. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 42% of 31 critics had given the film a positive review. Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale. [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film two stars, calling it "not very funny, and maybe couldn't have been very funny no matter what, because the pieces for comedy are not in place... A comedy that hasn't assigned sympathy to some characters and made others hateful cannot expect to get many laughs, because the audience doesn't know who to laugh at, or with."

Regarding the digital special effects, Ebert deemed the film "an excellent example of the way modern advances in special effects can sabotage a picture (''[[Titanic (1996 film)|Titanic]]'' is an example of effects being used wisely). Because it is possible to make a movie in which the mouse can do all sorts of clever things, the filmmakers have assumed incorrectly that it would be funny to see the mouse doing them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mouse-hunt-1997|title=Mouse Hunt Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (1997) - Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=www.rogerebert.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, the film was a financial success. It was released on December 19, 1997, and opened up in North America at #4 and grossed $6,062,922 in its opening weekend, averaging about $2,817 from 2,152 theaters. In its second weekend, it stayed at #4 and increased by 60 percent, making $9,702,770, averaging about $4,428 from 2,191 theaters, and bringing its ten day gross to $21,505,569.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&amp;id=mousehunt.htm|title=Mouse Hunt (1997) - Weekend Box Office Results - Box Office Mojo|website=www.boxofficemojo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It closed on July 1, 1998, with a final gross of $61,917,389 in the North American market and $60,500,000 in other territories for a worldwide total of $122,417,389. Its budget was $38 million. The film was released in the [[United Kingdom]] on April 3, 1998, and opened on #2, behind ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.25thframe.co.uk/charts/chart.php?chart=19980403|title=Weekend box office 3rd April 1998 - 5th April 1998|publisher=www.25thframe.co.uk|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neural network software''' is used to [[Simulation|simulate]], [[research]], [[Software development|develop]], and apply [[artificial neural network]]s, software concepts adapted from [[biological neural network]]s, and in some cases, a wider array of [[adaptive system]]s such as [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]].

==Simulators==
Neural network simulators are software applications that are used to simulate the behavior of artificial or biological neural networks. They focus on one or a limited number of specific types of neural networks. They are typically stand-alone and not intended to produce general neural networks that can be integrated in other software.  Simulators usually have some form of built-in [[Software visualization|visualization]] to monitor the training process. Some simulators also visualize the physical structure of the neural network.

===Research simulators===
[[Image:snns screen.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[SNNS]] research neural network simulator]]

Historically, the most common type of neural network software was intended for researching neural network structures and algorithms. The primary purpose of this type of software is, through simulation, to gain a better understanding of the behavior and the properties of neural networks.  Today in the study of artificial neural networks, simulators have largely been replaced by more general component based development environments as research platforms.

Commonly used artificial neural network simulators include the [[Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator]] (SNNS), [[Emergent (software)|Emergent]] and [[Neural Lab]].

In the study of biological neural networks however, simulation software is still the only available approach. In such simulators the physical biological and chemical properties of neural tissue, as well as the electromagnetic impulses between the neurons are studied.

Commonly used biological network simulators include [[Neuron (software)|Neuron]], [[GENESIS (software)|GENESIS]], [[NEST (software)|NEST]] and [[Brian (software)|Brian]].

===Data analysis simulators===
Unlike the research simulators, data analysis simulators are intended for practical applications of artificial neural networks. Their primary focus is on data mining and forecasting. Data analysis simulators usually have some form of preprocessing capabilities. Unlike the more general development environments data analysis simulators use a relatively simple static neural network that can be configured.  A majority of the data analysis simulators on the market use backpropagating networks or self-organizing maps as their core. The advantage of this type of software is that it is relatively easy to use. [[Neural Designer]] is one example of a data analysis simulator.

===Simulators for teaching neural network theory===
When the [[Connectionism#Parallel distributed processing|Parallel Distributed Processing]] volumes&lt;ref&gt;
Rumelhart, D.E., J.L. McClelland and the PDP Research Group (1986). Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition. Volume 1: Foundations, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;McClelland, J.L., D.E. Rumelhart and the PDP Research Group (1986). Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition. Volume 2: Psychological and Biological Models, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McClelland and Rumelhart "Explorations in Parallel Distributed Processing Handbook", MIT Press, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; were released in 1986-87, they provided some relatively simple software.  The original PDP software did not require any programming skills, which led to its adoption by a wide variety of researchers in diverse fields.  The original PDP software was developed into a more powerful package called PDP++, which in turn has become an even more powerful platform called  [[Emergent (software)|Emergent]].  With each development, the software has become more powerful, but also more daunting for use by beginners.

In 1997, the tLearn software was released to accompany a book.&lt;ref&gt;Plunkett, K. and Elman, J.L., Exercises in Rethinking Innateness: A Handbook for Connectionist Simulations (The MIT Press, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a return to the idea of providing a small, user-friendly, simulator that was designed with the novice in mind.  tLearn allowed basic feed forward networks, along with simple recurrent networks, both of which can be trained by the simple back propagation algorithm. tLearn has not been updated since 1999.

In 2011, the Basic Prop simulator was released.  Basic Prop is a self-contained application, distributed as a platform neutral JAR file, that provides much of the same simple functionality as tLearn.

In 2012, Wintempla included a namespace called NN with a set of C++ classes to implement: feed forward networks, probabilistic neural networks and Kohonen networks.  Neural Lab is based on Wintempla classes.  Neural Lab tutorial and Wintempla tutorial explains some of these clases for neural networks. The main disadvantage of Wintempla is that it compiles only with Microsoft Visual Studio.

==Development environments==
Development environments for neural networks differ from the software described above primarily on two accounts – they can be used to develop custom types of neural networks and they support [[System deployment|deployment]] of the neural network outside the environment. In some cases they have advanced [[Data preprocessing|preprocessing]], analysis and visualization capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2017/03/the-rd-pipeline-continues-launching-version-11-1/|title=The R&amp;D Pipeline Continues: Launching Version 11.1—Stephen Wolfram|last=|first=|date=|website=blog.stephenwolfram.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Component based===
[[Image:synapse screen.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Peltarion]] [[Peltarion Synapse|Synapse]]  component based development environment.]]
A more modern type of development environments that are currently favored in both industrial and scientific use are based on a [[Component-based software engineering|component based paradigm]]. The neural network is constructed by connecting adaptive filter components in a pipe filter flow. This allows for greater flexibility as custom networks can be built as well as custom components used by the network. In many cases this allows a combination of adaptive and non-adaptive components to work together. The data flow is controlled by a control system which is exchangeable as well as the adaptation algorithms. The other important feature is deployment capabilities.

With the advent of component-based frameworks such as [[Microsoft .NET|.NET]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], component based development environments are capable of deploying the developed neural network to these frameworks as inheritable components. In addition some software can also deploy these components to several platforms, such as [[embedded system]]s.

Component based development environments include: [[Peltarion]] [[Peltarion Synapse|Synapse]], [[NeuroDimension]] [[NeuroSolutions]], [[Scientific Software]] [[Neuro Laboratory]], and the [[LIONsolver]] integrated software.  Free [[Open-source software|open source]] component based environments include [[Encog]] and [[Neuroph]].

====Criticism====
A disadvantage of component-based development environments is that they are more complex than simulators. They require more learning to fully operate and are more complicated to develop.

==Custom neural networks==
The majority implementations of neural networks available are however custom implementations in various programming languages and on various platforms. Basic types of neural networks are simple to implement directly. There are also many [[programming libraries]] that contain neural network functionality and that can be used in custom implementations (such as [[tensorflow]], [[Theano (software)|theano]], etc., typically providing bindings to languages such as [[Python (programming language)|python]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]]).

==Standards==
In order for neural network models to be shared by different applications, a common language is necessary. The [[Predictive Model Markup Language]] (PMML) has been proposed to address this need. PMML is an XML-based language which provides a way for applications to define and share neural network models (and other data mining models) between PMML compliant applications.

PMML provides applications a vendor-independent method of defining models so that proprietary issues and incompatibilities are no longer a barrier to the exchange of models between applications. It allows users to develop models within one vendor's application, and use other vendors' applications to visualize, analyze, evaluate or otherwise use the models. Previously, this was very difficult, but with PMML, the exchange of models between compliant applications is now straightforward.

===PMML consumers and producers===
A range of products are being offered to produce and consume PMML. This ever-growing list includes the following neural network products:
* R: produces PMML for neural nets and other machine learning models via the package pmml.
* SAS Enterprise Miner: produces PMML for several mining models, including [[neural networks]], linear and logistic regression, decision trees, and other data mining models.
* SPSS: produces PMML for neural networks as well as many other mining models.
* STATISTICA: produces PMML for neural networks, data mining models and traditional statistical models.

The idea of Örek is present in some Turkic cultures. In some communities it is believed that a dead person can be turned into a Örek by a white dressed girl.  Öreks are undead creatures regularly encountered in folk narratives and legends. They are typically depicted as mindless, reanimated corpses with a hunger for human flesh.

She was born in [[Thames, New Zealand]], one of five children of a devoted mother, Alice (née Wily), and [[Henry Douglas Morpeth Haszard]], a surveyor, who worked for the [[Department of Survey and Land Information|Lands and Survey Department]], later becoming a Commissioner of Crown Lands in 1910.

As a result of her father's job the family moved often and lived in [[Auckland]], [[Christchurch]], [[Hokitika]] and [[Invercargill]].

At the age of 18, she enrolled at the Canterbury College School of Art (now the [[Ilam School of Fine Arts|School of Fine Arts]], [[Canterbury University]]), joining a set of women artists including [[Ngaio Marsh]], [[Evelyn Page]] (née Polson), [[Rata Lovell-Smith]] (née Bird) and [[Olivia Spencer Bower]]. She was taught amongst others by Archibald Nicoll, the newly appointed head of the school.

Haszard was very bohemian. She dressed eccentrically, spoke positively of de facto relationships and  advocated [[vegetarianism]] and unprocessed food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Drayton | first = Joanne | title = Rhona Haszard (1909-1931): An Experimental Expatriate | work = New Zealand Art Monthly | date = July 2002 | url = http://www.nzartmonthly.co.nz/drayton_002.html | accessdate = 14 July 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20020815135753/http://www.nzartmonthly.co.nz/drayton_002.html | archivedate = 15 August 2002 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, she married Ronald McKenzie, a teacher and fellow student. However, in 1925, she abandoned this apparently happy marriage to run off with an ex-British Army officer Leslie Greener. After being confronted with society disapproval, the couple escaped to [[France]] in 1926. They settled in [[Paris]] and studied briefly at the [[Académie Julian]]. Haszard continued to paint landscapes and exhibited in Paris at the [[Paris Salon]]. In 1927, [[London]] with the [[Society of Women Artists]] and [[Cairo]] as well as sending work back to be exhibited in New Zealand.

The couple completed numerous painting trips to the [[Channel Islands]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Greece]]. In 1927, Greener was employed by [[Victoria College, Alexandria]], Egypt to teach art. In 1928 Haszard had a serious accident that left her with a back injury and she returned to London to seek medical treatment in 1929 and 1930. However she remained committed to painting and to the bohemian art and theatre circles. She returned to [[Alexandria]] in 1930.

She was killed when she fell off a four-storey tower at Victoria College, Alexandria in 1931 the night after her last exhibition opened. She was 30.

'''Rok Petrovič''' {{audio|Sl-Rok Petrovič.oga|listen}} (5 February 1966 – 16 September 1993) was a [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] and [[Slovenes|Slovenian]] alpine [[skier]].

Petrovič was born in [[Ljubljana]], [[Yugoslavia]], the son of [[Kresimir Petrovic|Krešimir Petrović]], a well known [[sports psychologist]] of [[Croats|Croatian]] origin (His mother been from Vela Luka). His first success in alpine ski racing was the 1983 Junior World Championship [[Slalom skiing|slalom]] title in [[Sestriere]], Italy.

After this he rapidly advanced up the world slalom rankings. In the 1985–86 [[Alpine Skiing World Cup]] season, he was practically unbeatable in slalom, his competition left to wait for rare mistakes in his highly aggressive and innovative skiing style. That season he won 5 races, is second in [[St. Anton]], Austria and third in [[Geilo]], Norway, easily winning the World Cup [[Slalom skiing|slalom]] title and becoming the first [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] with a crystal globe.

After his championship-winning season, Petrovič was unable to recapture his winning form, the only hint of his championship season being a second place behind his teammate [[Bojan Križaj]] at the unforgettable race in [[Kranjska Gora]] next season.  He finished eighth in the 1988 [[Winter Olympic Games]] [[giant slalom]].

Due to his lack of winning results, he quit skiing in 1988 and began studies at the College of Sports in Ljubljana. He graduated in 1991 and continued with post-graduate study. He was to defend his M.Sc. thesis in the autumn of 1993, but shortly before defending his thesis he took a short break at the Croatian island [[Korčula]] and drowned in a diving accident.

Altogether he won 5 World Cup races, all in slalom and all in his champion season in 1985-86:

[[Image:THES-Heptapyrgion spolia 3.jpg|thumb|Fragments of Greek inscriptions in the masonry of the Ottoman [[Heptapyrgion (Thessaloniki)|Heptapyrgion]] (Yedikule) fortress (1431), [[Thessaloniki]].]]

'''''Spolia''''' ([[Latin]], 'spoils'), repurposed building stone for new construction, or decorative sculpture reused in new monuments, is the result of an ancient and widespread practice whereby stone that has been quarried, cut, and used in a built structure, is carried away to be used elsewhere.  The practice is of particular interest to historians, archaeologists and architectural historians since the gravestones, monuments and architectural fragments of antiquity are frequently found embedded in structures built centuries or millennia later.

Archaeologist [[Philip A. Barker]] gives the example of a late Roman period (probably 1st century) tombstone from [[Wroxeter]] that could be seen to have been cut down and undergone weathering while in use as part of an exterior wall, then, possibly as late as the 5th century, reinscribed for reuse as a tombstone.&lt;ref name=Barker&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barker|first1=A. Philip|title=Techniques of Archaeological Excavation|date=1977 |publisher=Routledge|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice was common in [[late antiquity]].  Entire obsolete structures, including underground foundations, are known to have been demolished to enable the construction of new structures.  According to Baxter, two churches in Worcester  (one 7th century and one 10th,) are thought to have been deconstructed so that  their building stone could be repurposed by [[Wulfstan (died 1095)|St. Wulstan]] to construct a cathedral in 1084.&lt;ref name=Barker/&gt;  And the parish churches of [[Atcham]], [[Wroxeter]], and [[Upton Magna]] are largely built of stone taken from the buildings of [[Viroconium Cornoviorum]].&lt;ref name=Barker/&gt;

Roman examples include the [[Arch of Janus]], the earlier imperial reliefs reused on the [[Arch of Constantine]], the colonnade of [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]]; examples in Byzantine territories include the exterior sculpture on the [[Panagia Gorgoepikoos]] church in [[Athens]]); in the medieval West Roman tiles were reused in [[St Albans Cathedral]], in much of the medieval architecture of [[Colchester]], porphyry columns in the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]], and the colonnade of the basilica of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]]. Spolia in the medieval Islamic world include the columns in the [[hypostyle]] mosques of [[Kairouan]], [[Great Mosque of Gaza|Gaza]] and [[Mezquita|Cordoba]].
[[Image:Trastevere 1.jpg|thumb|left|Re-used reliefs as decoration in Santa Maria in Trastevere, Rome]]
Although the modern literature on spolia is primarily concerned with these and other medieval examples, the practice is common and there is probably no period of art history in which evidence for "spoliation" could not be found.

Interpretations of spolia generally alternate between the "ideological" and the "pragmatic." Ideological readings might describe the re-use of art and architectural elements from former empires or dynasties as triumphant (that is, literally as the display of "spoils" or "booty" of the conquered) or as revivalist (proclaiming the renovation of past imperial glories). Pragmatic readings emphasize the utility of re-used materials: if there is a good supply of old marble columns available, for example, there is no need to produce new ones. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive, and there is certainly no one approach that can account for all instances of spoliation, as each instance must be evaluated within its particular historical context.

Spolia had [[apotropaic]] spiritual value. Clive Foss has noted&lt;ref&gt;Foss, "Late Antique and Byzantine Ankara" ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' '''31''' (1977:65).&lt;/ref&gt; that in the fifth century crosses were inscribed on the stones of pagan buildings, as at [[Ankara#Roman history|Ankara]], where crosses were inscribed on the walls of the temple of [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]] and [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)#Religion and Imperium under Augustus|Augustus]]. Clive Foss suggests that the purpose of this was to ward off the ''[[daimon]]es'' that lurked in stones that had been consecrated to pagan usage.

Liz James extends Foss's observation&lt;ref&gt;James, "'Pray Not to Fall into Temptation and Be on Your Guard': Pagan Statues in Christian Constantinople" ''Gesta'' '''35'''.1 (1996:12–20) p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; in noting that statues, laid on their sides and facing outwards, were carefully incorporated in Ankara's city walls in the Seventh century, at a time when spolia were also being built into city walls in [[Miletus]], [[Sardis]], [[Ephesus]] and [[Pergamum]]: "laying a statue on its side places it and the power it represents under control. It is a way of acquiring the power of rival gods for one's own benefit," Liz James observes. "Inscribing a cross works similarly, sealing the object for Christian purposes".&lt;ref&gt;James 1996, noting O. Hjort, "Augustus Christianus—Livia Christiana: ''Sphragis'' and Roman portrait sculpture", in L. Ryden and J.O. Rosenqvist, ''Aspects of Late Antiquity and Early Byzantium'' (Transactions of the Swedish Institute in Istanbul, IV) 1993:93–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Suicide awareness.jpg|thumb|Suicide awareness]]
'''Suicide awareness''' is a proactive effort to [[Consciousness raising|raise awareness]] around suicidal behaviors.  It is focused on reducing social [[Badge of shame|stigmas]] and [[ambiguity]], by bringing attention to [[suicide]] statistically and sociologically, and encouraging positive dialogue and engagement as a means to prevent suicide. Suicide awareness is linked to [[suicide prevention]] as both address suicide education and the dissemination of information to ultimately decrease the rate of suicide. Awareness is a critical first stage that ultimately can ease the need for prevention. Awareness signifies a fundamental consciousness of the threat, while prevention focuses on stopping the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awareness. (n.d).|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/awareness|accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prevention. (n.d.).|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prevention|accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide awareness is not a medical engagement, but a combination of medical, social, emotional and even financial counseling. Suicide awareness in adolescents focuses on the age group between 10–24 years, beginning with the onset of puberty, according to combined definitions and theories found in [[developmental psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=S|title=Adolescence: Its psychology and its relations to physiology, anthropology, sociology, sex, crime, religion, and education.|volume=1|date=1904|publisher=D. Appleton and Co.|location=New York|pages=v-XX}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lerner, R. M . &amp; Steinberg, L.|title=The scientific study of adolescent development: Historical and contemporary perspectives.|date=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=3–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stigma and ambiguity ==
Stigma is a negative impact that society can often attribute to the suicidal condition, and which can hinder and prevent positive engagement with those demonstrating suicidal behavior. It can be experienced as self-stigma or cultural, public stigma. Self-stigma is the adverse effect of internalized prejudice, manifesting itself in reduced self-esteem, decreased self-efficacy, and a feeling of “why try” or self-deprecation (undervaluing any attempts to get a job, be social, etc. because of lack of self-worth).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Corrigan, P. W., Michaels, P. J., Vega, E., Gause, M., Watson, A. C., Rüsch, N. (2012). Self-stigma of mental illness scale--short form: Reliability and validity. Psychiatry Research, 199(1), 65-9. {{doi|10.1016/j.psychres.2012.04.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is experienced not only by those facing suicidal thoughts, but also by those directly and indirectly affected such as family members and friends. Public stigma is experienced by prejudice and discrimination through public misuse of stereotypes associated with suicide.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 
Stigma can create a detrimental barrier for some seeking help. Research has consistently illustrated the physical link between suicide and [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], but ignorance and outdated beliefs can sometimes lead to these disorders being identified as a weakness or a lack of [[Volition (psychology)|willpower]].&lt;ref&gt;Caruso, K. Stigma and suicide. Suicide.org. Retrieved from http://www.suicide.org/stigma-and-suicide.html&lt;/ref&gt; Stigma can prevent survivors of suicide attempts, and those affected by suicide deaths, from reaching out for support from professionals and advocates to make positive change.&lt;ref&gt;BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information. (2005, Summer). Stigma and discrimination. Visions: BC’s Mental Health and Addictions Journal, 2(6), 21-22. Retrieved from http://www.heretohelp.bc.ca/sites/default/files/visions_stigma_discrim.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical stigma ===
Historically, suicide has not always been considered a societal taboo.&lt;ref name="lighthousecharity.com"&gt;Lighthouse, “A Beacon of Hope,” (2012, June 4). The stigma of suicide. Retrieved from http://www.lighthousecharity.com/stigma-of-suicide/&lt;/ref&gt; It is critical to understand the historical context in order to raise awareness of suicide's impact on our current culture.

Suicide was embraced as a philosophical escape by the followers of the Greek philosopher Epicurus when life's happiness seemed lost.&lt;ref&gt;Lighthouse, “A Beacon of Hope,” (2012, June 4) The stigma of suicide. Retrieved from http://www.lighthousecharity.com/stigma-of-suicide/&lt;/ref&gt; It has been glorified in [[self-immolation]] as an act of martyrdom as in the case of [[Thích Quảng Đức|Thich Quang Duc]] who burned himself to death in protest of the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, J. (2016). Incendiary acts and apocryphal avant-gardes thích quảng ðức, self-Immolation, and buddhist spiritual vanguardism. Paj: A Journal of Performance &amp; Art, 114, 31-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Assisted suicide as a release from suffering can be traced back to ancient Roman society.&lt;ref&gt;Lighthouse, “A Beacon of Hope,” (2012, June 4). The stigma of suicide. Retrieved from http://www.lighthousecharity.com/stigma-of-suicide&lt;/ref&gt; In Jewish culture, there is a reverence for the mass suicide at [[masada]] in the face of attack by the Roman empire, showing how suicide has sometimes had a contradictory relationship with established religion. This indicates a tension between the presentation of suicide in this historical context, and its associations in our current society with personal anguish.
Today, suicide is generally perceived as an act of despair or hopelessness, or a criminal act of terrorism ([[suicide attack]]). This negative backdrop was seen in [[Colonial history of the United States|Colonial America]], where suicides were considered criminal and brought to trial, even if mental illness had been present.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, S. &amp; Institute of Medicine (U.S.) Committee on Pathophysiology &amp; Prevention of Adolescent &amp; Adult Suicide. (2002). Reducing suicide: A national imperative. Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide was identified in Roman Catholicism as a sinful act, with religious burial prohibited until 1983, when the [[Catholic Church]] altered the [[canon law]] to allow funerals and burials within the church of those who died by suicide.&lt;ref name="lighthousecharity.com"/&gt;  Today, many current societies and religious traditions condemn suicide, especially in Western culture.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, S. &amp; Institute of Medicine (U.S.) Committee on Pathophysiology &amp; Prevention of Adolescent &amp; Adult Suicide. (2002). Reducing suicide: A national imperative. Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Public consideration of suicide in our culture is further complicated by society's struggle to rationalize such cult events as the [[Jonestown]] mass suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Fondakowski, L. (2013). Stories from jonestown. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In light of these mixed historical messages, it can be confusing for youth, presented with an academic and historical profile for suicide. The ambiguity of accepted suicide and suicidal behavior definitions impedes progress with its utilization of variable terminology.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, S. &amp; Institute of Medicine (U.S.) Committee on Pathophysiology &amp; Prevention of Adolescent &amp; Adult Suicide. (2002). Reducing suicide: A national imperative. Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public and cultural stigma ===
Today, even though suicide is considered a public health issue by advocates, the general public often still consider it a private shame; a final desperate solution for the emotionally weak.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, B. M. (2015, January 18). Suicide attempt survivors come out of the shadows. ''Chicago Tribune''. Retrieved from http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/ct-suicide-attempt-survivors-met-20150118-story.html#page=1&lt;/ref&gt; It is stigmatized in the public perception by being associated with weakness, a “cry for attention,” shame, and [[depression (mood)|depression]], without understanding the contributing factors. There can be a visceral and emotional reaction to suicide rather than an attempt to understand it. This reaction is based on stereotypes (overgeneralizations about a group: weak or crazy), prejudices (agreement with stereotypical beliefs and related emotional reactions: Sue attempted suicide; ‘I’m afraid of her’), and discrimination (unfair behavior towards the suicidal individual or group: avoidance; ‘suicidal persons should be locked up’).&lt;ref&gt;Corrigan, P.

&lt;/ref&gt; Public stigma is felt by medical professionals whose clients die by suicide and whose treatment is then questioned by colleagues and in lawsuits, often contributing to their being less inclined to work with suicidal patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/01/how-patient-suicide-affects-psychiatrists/384563/|title=How Patient Suicide Affects Psychiatrists|first=Sulome|last=Anderson|date=20 January 2015|website=TheAtlantic.com|access-date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Property can also be [[stigmatized property|stigmatized]] by suicide: property sellers in certain jurisdictions in the United States, in California for example, are required by law to reveal if a suicide or murder occurred on the premises in the past three years, putting suicide in the same category as homicide.
These issues compound and perpetuate the public stigma of suicide, exacerbating the inclination for suicidal individuals, and their family and friends, to bury their experiences, creating a barrier to care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/10.1027/0227-5910/a000456|title=Making Sense of the Public Stigma of Suicide|first1=Patrick W.|last1=Corrigan|first2=Lindsay|last2=Sheehan|first3=Maya A.|last3=Al-Khouja|date=24 March 2017|publisher=|journal=Crisis|volume=38|issue=5|pages=351–359|access-date=4 January 2018|via=econtent.Hogrefe.com (Atypon)|doi=10.1027/0227-5910/a000456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emotional stigma ===
Emotionally, the negative stigma of suicide is a powerful force creating isolation and exclusion for those in suicidal crisis.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Scocco, P., Castriotta, C., Toffol, E., Preti, A. (2012). Stigma of suicide attempt (STOSA) scale and stigma of suicide and suicide survivor (STOSASS) scale: Two new assessment tools. Psychiatry Research, 200(2-3), 872-878. doi:10.1016/j.psychres.2012.06.033&lt;/ref&gt; The use of stereotypes, discrimination and prejudices can strip the dignity of those experiencing suicidal behavior. It also has the potential to inhibit compassion from others and to diminish hope.&lt;ref&gt;Suicide Attempt Survivors Task Force of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention. (2014, July). The way forward: Pathways to hope, recovery, and wellness with insights from lived experience, p. 17. Retrieved from http://actionallianceforsuicideprevention.org/sites/actionallianceforsuicideprevention.org/files/The-Way-Forward-Final-2014-07-01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of being socially rejected and labeled suicidal can prevent communication and support.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Distress and reduced life satisfaction are directly affected by subjective feelings of being devalued and marginalized. This develops into an internalized stigma; it creates self-stigmatized emotions, self-deprecation and self-actualization of negative stereotypes, causing further withdrawal, reduction in quality of life and the inhibiting access to care.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

This emotional stigma also affects suicide survivors: those suffering a loved one's loss, stirring up guilt, self-blame, isolation, depression and post-traumatic stress.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, K, Cunningham, C., Murphy, G., &amp; Jackson, D. (2016). Helpful and unhelpful responses after suicide: Experiences of bereaved family members. International Journal of Mental Health Nursing, 25(5), 418-425. doi:10.1111/inm.12224&lt;/ref&gt; Subjective experiences of feeling shunned or blamed for an incident can cause those close to the victim to bury the truth of what transpired.

==Societal impact==
===Statistics===
Trend analysis shows there is an increase in suicide among the youth population.&lt;ref name="Spirito, A. 2003 p. 1"&gt;Spirito, A., Overholser, J. (2003). Evaluating and treating adolescent suicide attempters: From research to practice (Practical resources for the mental health professional). Amsterdam: Academic Press, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1999-2006, according to the Center for Disease Control, suicide was the third leading cause of death in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years, and the fourth leading cause of death for children aged 10 to 14 years.&lt;ref name="Spirito, A. 2003 p. 1"/&gt;  As of 2011, suicide increased in this age group, becoming the second cause of death for youth between the ages of 15 and 24 years, below homicide statistics and above those of accidents.&lt;ref&gt;American Association of Suicidology.

Among college students, suicide has become the second leading cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;Taub, D. J., Robertson, J. (2013). Preventing college student suicide: New directions for student services. No. 141, Spring, 2013. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Mental Health Association has divided students at risk for suicide into two groups upon college entrance: those already diagnosed with mental health issues, and those who develop issues while in college.&lt;ref name="Taub, D.

San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests poor sleep habits, substance and alcohol experimentation, in addition to academic and social stress, may trigger or worsen mental health issues and increase suicide risk.&lt;ref name="Taub, D. J. 2013 p. 6"/&gt;

Geographically within the United States, western states have statistically higher rates of suicide. Per 100,000 people, Montana is ranked first, Alaska ranked second, and Wyoming is third.&lt;ref&gt;Drapeau, C. W. &amp; McIntosh, J. L., for American Association of Suicidology. (2015, January 22).

Within the last 100 years, suicides have outnumbered homicides by 3 to 2.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, S., Institute of Medicine (U.S.). Committee on Pathophysiology &amp; Prevention of Adolescent &amp; Adult Suicide, (2002). Reducing suicide: A national imperative. Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Statistics show that the number of youth who [[self-harm]] is increasing, but it is difficult to determine if suicide is the ultimate intention. In 2015, 494,169 people were treated at US hospitals for injuries as a result of self-harm. This suggests approximately 12 people harm themselves for every reported death by suicide.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, (2015). Suicide statistics. Retrieved from https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/&lt;/ref&gt; Recent surveys have tallied as many as one million people in the US engaging in intentional self-harm.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Many suicides go unreported because of social stigma or are left untreated due to lack of education, which clouds the available statistics.

===Risk factors===
Suicide does not have one single cause or factor. Suicide is considered to occur most often when stress and pressures exceed the coping abilities of a person suffering from mental health issues. Depressive disorders are considered to be the most frequently associated cause of suicide, but they are often undiagnosed or untreated,&lt;ref&gt;American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, (2015). About suicide. Retrieved from American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, (2015). Suicide statistics. Retrieved from https://afsp.org/about-suicide/&lt;/ref&gt;  and are not always the singular factor.
&lt;br&gt;
Risk factors have been evaluated for suicide as characteristic markers or conditions that can increase the chance a person may try to take their life. Odds are significantly increased when several risk factors are present at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, (2016). Model school district policy on suicide prevention: Model language, commentary, and resources, p. 2.

Over 90% of suicides in the United States are a result of mental illness and/or alcohol and substance abuse, but 10% of those who die by suicide do not have any psychologically-known diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, S. &amp; Institute of Medicine (U.S.) Committee on Pathophysiology &amp; Prevention of Adolescent &amp; Adult Suicide. (2002). Reducing suicide: A national imperative. Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth vulnerability to suicide is compounded by the increased levels of impulsivity, more than other age groups, as reported by the United States Institute of Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, S. &amp; Institute of Medicine (U.S.) Committee on Pathophysiology &amp; Prevention of Adolescent &amp; Adult Suicide. (2002). Reducing suicide: A national imperative. Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be attributed to neurological and cognitive changes in adolescent brain function, stimulated by a rapid increase in [[dopamine]] during [[puberty]].&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, L. (2010). A dual systems model of adolescent risk-taking. Developmental Psychobiology, 52(3), p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;   It is also suggested this impulsive, risk-taking behavior is often associated with the early use of alcohol and illegal substances.&lt;ref&gt;Susman, E. &amp; Dorn, L.

(2002). Reducing suicide: A national imperative. Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;    Abuse of illicit substances and alcohol can also be attributed to family dysfunction and genetic personality traits, and can be a predictor of hopelessness, especially among lonely and isolated youth.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, S. &amp; Institute of Medicine (U.S.) Committee on Pathophysiology &amp; Prevention of Adolescent &amp; Adult Suicide. (2002). Reducing suicide: A national imperative. Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;
A comprehensive list of risk factors is outlined on [https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/how-we-can-all-prevent-suicide/ Suicide Prevention Lifeline website].

==Awareness factors==
Suicide awareness expresses the need for open constructive dialogue as an initial step towards preventing incidents of adolescent suicide. Once the stigmas have been overcome, there is an increased possibility that education, medical care and support can provide a critical framework for those at risk. Lack of information, awareness of professional services, judgment and insensitivity from religious groups, and financial strain have all been identified as barriers to support access for those youth in suicidal crisis. The critical framework is a necessary component to implementing suicide awareness and suicide prevention, and breaking down these barriers.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, K, Cunningham, C., Murphy, G., &amp; Jackson, D. (2016). Helpful and unhelpful responses after suicide: Experiences of bereaved family members. International Journal of Mental Health Nursing, 25(5), p. 419. doi:10.1111/inm.12224&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Awareness can focus on the individual with social and non-threatening education (introduced at schools as a foundational program for all adolescents), and on the public and societal level, encompassing media across all platforms to destigmatize suicide and its perpetuation. Education for the individual and public raises awareness to the protective factors that may assist in suicide risk reduction.

===Protective factors===
Protective factors are characteristics or conditions that may have a positive effect on youth and reduce the possibility of suicide attempts.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, (2016). Model school district policy on suicide prevention: Model language, commentary, and resources, p. 3. Retrieved from https://afsp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Model-Policy_FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  These factors have not been studied in as much depth as risk factors, so there is less research. They include: 
*Receiving effective mental health care. 
*Positive social connections and support with family and peers provides coping skills.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, S., Institute of Medicine (U.S.). Committee on Pathophysiology &amp; Prevention of Adolescent &amp; Adult Suicide, (2002). Reducing suicide: A national imperative. Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Participation in community and social groups (i.e. religious) that foster resilience.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;
*Optimism enables youth to engage and acquire adaptive skills in reinterpreting adverse experiences to find meaning and benefit.&lt;ref name="Goldsmith, S. 2002 p. 92"&gt;Goldsmith, S., Institute of Medicine (U.S.). Committee on Pathophysiology &amp; Prevention of Adolescent &amp; Adult Suicide, (2002). Reducing suicide: A national imperative. Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Life satisfaction, spiritual wellbeing and belief that a person can survive beyond their pain is protective against suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, S., Institute of Medicine (U.S.). Committee on Pathophysiology &amp; Prevention of Adolescent &amp; Adult Suicide, (2002). Reducing suicide: A national imperative. Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Resiliency based on adaptive coping skills has can reduce suicide risk, and research suggests these skills can be taught.&lt;ref name="Goldsmith, S. 2002 p. 92"/&gt;
*Finding hope can be a key protective factor and a catalyst for the recovery process.&lt;ref&gt;National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention: Suicide Attempt Survivors Task Force. (2014). The way forward: Pathways to hope, recovery, and wellness with insights from lived experience. Washington, DC: Author, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is important to note, however, that in-depth training is paramount for those involved in any service that looks to the awareness and needs of those touched by suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, K, Cunningham, C., Murphy, G., &amp; Jackson, D. (2016). Helpful and unhelpful responses after suicide: Experiences of bereaved family members. International Journal of Mental Health Nursing, 25(5), 418. doi:10.1111/inm.12224&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social media===
In a world where social media drives both the activities and knowledge for today's youth, it is important that there is a constructive discourse on the subject of suicide, rather than glamorizing it as an aspect of storytelling. Constructive social media is illustrated in the documentary [http://theswordmovie.com/ “The S Word movie”] which presents suicide attempt survivors and their stories. It is the mission of the film to uncover personal survivors’ accounts of their conflicts, highlighting their courage, insight and humor. The film aims to create a national community transforming personal struggles into positive action.&lt;ref&gt;The “S Word Movie,” (2017). Retrieved from http://theswordmovie.com/our-story/&lt;/ref&gt; This project is considered constructive to suicide awareness as, historically, suicide attempt survivors have either not come forward to speak out, or have done so anonymously. This documentary, created by a suicide attempt survivor, encourages them to talk openly of their experiences, so that others can learn from exploring a world that has been stigmatized for too long.&lt;ref&gt;Stage, D. L. (2010-2017). Live through this. Retrieved from http://livethroughthis.org/the-project/&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide awareness and prevention have in the past only relied on research from clinical observation. In bringing insights, intimate experience, and real-world wisdom of suicide attempt survivors to the table, professionals, educators, other survivors and suicide attempt survivors can learn firsthand from their “lived experience.”&lt;ref&gt;National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention: Suicide Attempt Survivors Task Force. (2014). The way forward: Pathways to hope, recovery, and wellness with insights from lived experience. Washington, DC: Author, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media can also glamorize or romanticize suicide as suggested by media reporter Korin Miller of Self magazine and Phyllis Alongi (clinical director at the Society for the Prevention of Teen Suicide).&lt;ref&gt;Miller, K. (2017, April 13). '13 Reasons Why' Is Not the Force for Mental Health Awareness People Say It Is. Retrieved fromhttps://www.self.com/story/13-reasons-why-suicide-and-mental-health&lt;/ref&gt;   Miller highlights the negative aspects of the new Netflix show “[[13 Reasons Why]]” which had been touted as a suicide awareness and mental health force. Alongi and her organization do not agree with aspects of the show, in which they feel suicide is romanticized, graphic details are depicted, the counselor is portrayed as ineffective, the placing of blame is confusing, and most importantly that teens may not recognize all of this.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, K. (2017, April 13). '13 Reasons Why' Is Not the Force for Mental Health Awareness People Say It Is. Retrieved from https://www.self.com/story/13-reasons-why-suicide-and-mental-health&lt;/ref&gt;  This opinion is shared by Zoe Williams of the U.S. online edition of The Guardian, stating the Netflix series is aimed at a young audience, susceptible to contagion, who are particularly vulnerable to experiencing suicidal thoughts. Williams argues that the series normalizes and legitimizes the act of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Z. (2017, April 26). Netflix's 13 Reasons Why and the trouble with dramatising suicide.

Media and journalism, when reporting on suicide, have moved forward in their discussion of suicide. The Recommendations for Reporting on Suicide discovered the powerful impact media coverage, newspapers and journalists can have on the perpetuating stigma of suicide, and that it can lead to greater risk of occurrence.  The specific rules that media representatives should follow are:
* Don't sensationalize the suicide.
*	Don’t talk about the contents of the suicide note, if there is one.
*	Don't describe the suicide method.
*	Report on suicide as a public health issue.
*	Don’t speculate why the person might have done it.
*	Don’t quote or interview police or first responders about the causes of suicide.
*	Describe suicide as “died by suicide” or “completed” or “killed themselves,” rather than “committed suicide.”
*	Don’t glamorize suicide''.''&lt;ref&gt;Pirkis, J., Blood, R. W., Skehan, J., &amp; Dare, A. (2010). Suicide in the news: Informing strategies to improve the reporting of suicide. Health Communication, 25(6-7), 576-7. doi:10.1080/10410236.2010.496771&lt;/ref&gt;
This is to prevent certain types of messaging around suicide that could increase the chances of at-risk youth considering or attempting suicide. This initiative brought awareness to the sensitivity of reporting on suicide in a constructive, destigmatized method of messaging.&lt;ref&gt;National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention. (2017) Safety. Retrieved from http://suicidepreventionmessaging.actionallianceforsuicideprevention.org/safety&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social agency===
Education in a non-threatening environment is critical to a growth in awareness among adolescents. Health education is closely related to health awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Jodoin, E. C., Robertson, J. (2013). The public health approach to campus suicide prevention. New Directions for Student Services, 2013(141), 15-25. {{doi|10.1002/ss.20037}}&lt;/ref&gt;  School can be the best place to implement a suicide education program because it is the pivotal location that brings the major influences in an adolescent's life together.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;  Pilot programs for awareness, and coping and resiliency training should be put into place for all adolescent school-aged children to combat life stressors and to encourage healthy communication.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, S., Institute of Medicine (U.S.). Committee on Pathophysiology &amp; Prevention of Adolescent &amp; Adult Suicide, (2002). Reducing suicide: A national imperative. Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. John Draper, psychologist and director of the [https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/ National Suicide Prevention Lifeline], “The best way to effectively prevent suicide is to give voice to the suicidal,"&lt;ref name="chicagotribune.com"&gt;Rubin, B. M., (2015, January 18). Suicide attempt survivors come out of the shadows. ChicagoTribune.com, Retrieved from http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/ct-suicide-attempt-survivors-met-20150118-story.html#page=1&lt;/ref&gt;  meaning that their stories can inspire and teach others, and aid in reducing stigma. Dr. Christine Moutier, chief medical officer at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, agrees that it is imperative to encourage suicide attempt survivors to speak up, and is holding focus groups with those who tried to kill themselves. Her message is to treat suicide awareness the same as [[breast cancer awareness]], which also had been stigmatized in the past, but has now been brought into the public eye through research, communication, marketing and survivors speaking out publicly.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune.com"/&gt;

''Send Silence Packing'' is a suicide awareness program trademarked by Active Minds, Inc. to connect college students to mental health resources, raise awareness about the impact of suicide, and inspire action and dialogue regarding suicide.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Send Silence Packing, (2017). Active Minds, Inc. Retrieved from http://activeminds.org/our-programming/send-silence-packing&lt;/ref&gt;  The program uses donated backpacks (from loved ones), each one representing a student lost to suicide, in an exhibition which travels around US college campuses. The backpacks are displayed in the college quads and emphasize the scope of suicide and the connection to real individuals. Since its initial exhibition in 2008 in Washington DC, ''Send Silence Packing'' has traveled to more than 140 cities around the United States. Surveys of students viewing the exhibit rated the experience as “powerful to very powerful” and 97% reported it was very educational. The program determined that each person who witnessed the exhibition told three friends, and that it encourages help-seeking for those viewing it and those they tell about it.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

Another program promoting education is [http://www.centerforsuicideawareness.org/ The Center for Suicide Awareness]. This organization's mission is to reduce suicide by providing proactive education and support resources to suicide attempt survivors and survivors, in addition to providing student presentations and training for educators, healthcare professionals, youth, police and community leaders. Their environment is compassionate, barrier-free and stigma-free.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Suicide Awareness, (2017). Mission statement and vision statement. Retrieved from http://www.centerforsuicideawareness.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also organizations who deal with specifically vulnerable groups. [http://www.thetrevorproject.org/ The Trevor Project] raises suicide awareness within the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning (LGBTQ) community, aged 13–24 years of age. Their mission to end suicide is fostered through four strategies: providing crisis counseling to LGBTQ youth considering suicide; offering a sense of non-judgmental community, supportive counseling and resources to reduce risk; educate youth and adults on LGBTQ-competent suicide risk detection and response; and advocacy for laws and policies to reduce suicide in the LGBTQ community.&lt;ref&gt;The Trevor Project, (2017). Retrieved from http://www.thetrevorproject.org/section/about&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
With the lack of constructive dialogue and resistance to suicide reporting due to stigma, it is critical to continue to explore the medical science of suicide, using it in a delicate balance with emotional and social education. Researchers have recently looked at developing a measure for suicide stigma, both for suicide attempt survivors and suicide survivors. The Stigma of Suicide Attempt scale (STOSA) and the Stigma of Suicide and Suicide Survivor scale (STOSASS) were created to quantify stigma at the individual level and general population levels.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;Scocco, P., Castriotta, C., Toffol, E., Preti, A. (2012). Stigma of suicide attempt (STOSA) scale and stigma of suicide and suicide survivor (STOSASS) scale: Two new assessment tools. Psychiatry Research, 200(2-3), p. 872. {{doi|10.1016/j.psychres.2012.06.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Results underlined the importance of both groups coming forward and participating in a study of this nature. It also illustrated differences in stigma evaluation for suicide attempt survivors and survivors. However, the study was based on self-reporting which can be limited in capturing behavioral attitudes. Also, the scales developed did not distinguish whether suicide stigma is specific to suicide or to mental illness in general. Still, the researchers believe STOSA and STOSASS could be beneficial in predicting therapeutic intervention outcomes for suicide attempters and survivors. More in-depth research needs to be continued on this, as well as exploring internalized stigma, which has not been measured thus far.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;

'''Tensor network theory''' is a theory of [[brain]] function (particularly that of the [[cerebellum]]) that provides a mathematical model of the [[transformation geometry|transformation]] of sensory [[space-time]] coordinates into motor coordinates and vice versa by cerebellar [[neuronal networks]]. The theory was developed by Andras Pellionisz and [[Rodolfo Llinas]] in the 1980s as a [[geometrization]] of brain function (especially of the [[central nervous system]]) using [[tensor]]s.

===Geometrization movement of the mid-20th century===
The mid-20th century saw a concerted movement to quantify and provide geometric models for various fields of science, including biology and physics.&lt;ref name=GeoBio&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rashevsky|first=N|title=The Geometrization of Biology|journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics|date=1956|volume=18|pages=31–54|doi=10.1007/bf02477842}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GeoPhysics&gt;{{cite journal|last=Palais|first=Richard|title=The Geometrization of Physics|journal=Lecture Notes in Mathematics|date=1981|pages=1–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=physicstoday&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mallios|first=Anastasios|title=Geometry and physics of today|journal=International Journal of Theoretical Physics|date=August 2006|volume=45|issue=8|doi=10.1007/s10773-006-9130-3|pages=1552–1588}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[geometrization]] of biology began in the 1950s in an effort to reduce concepts and principles of biology down into concepts of geometry similar to what was done in physics in the decades before.&lt;ref name="GeoBio"/&gt; In fact, much of the geometrization that took place in the field of biology took its cues from the geometrization of contemporary physics.&lt;ref name=BioPhysics&gt;{{cite book|last=Bailly|first=Francis|title=Mathematics and the Natural Sciences: The Physical Singularity of Life|year=2011|publisher=Imperial College Press|isbn=978-1848166936}}&lt;/ref&gt; One major achievement in [[general relativity]] was the geometrization of [[gravity|gravitation]].&lt;ref name="BioPhysics"/&gt;  This allowed the trajectories of objects to be modeled as [[geodesic curvature|geodesic curves]] (or optimal paths) in a [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian space manifold]].&lt;ref name="BioPhysics"/&gt;   During the 1980s, the field of [[theoretical physics]] also witnessed an outburst of geometrization activity in parallel with the development of the [[Unified Field Theory]], the [[Theory of Everything]], and the similar [[Grand Unified Theory]], all of which attempted to explain connections between known physical phenomena.&lt;ref name=GeoUnity&gt;{{cite journal|last=KALINOWSKI|first=M|title=The Program of Geometrization of Physics: Some Philosophical Remarks|journal=Synthese|date=1988|pages=129–138| doi = 10.1007/bf00869432|volume=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geometrization of biology in parallel with the geometrization of physics covered a multitude of fields, including populations, disease outbreaks, and evolution, and continues to be an active field of research even today.&lt;ref name=epidemicmodels&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahil|first=M|title=Geometrization of Some Epidemic Models|journal=Wseas Transactions on Mathematics|date=2011|volume=10|issue=12|pages=454–462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=evolutionmodels&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nalimov|first=W|title=Geometrization of biological ideas: probablistic model of evolution|journal=Zhurnal Obshchei Biologii|date=2011|volume=62|issue=5|pages=437–448}}&lt;/ref&gt; By developing geometric models of populations and disease outbreaks, it is possible to predict the extent of the epidemic and allow public health officials and medical professionals to control disease outbreaks and better prepare for future epidemics.&lt;ref name="epidemicmodels"/&gt; Likewise, there is work being done to develop geometric models for the evolutionary process of species in order to study the process of evolution, the space of morphological properties, the diversity of forms and spontaneous changes and mutations.&lt;ref name="evolutionmodels"/&gt;

===Geometrization of the brain and tensor network theory===
Around the same time as all of the developments in the geometrization of biology and physics, some headway was made in the geometrization of neuroscience. At the time, it became more and more necessary for brain functions to be quantified in order to study them more rigorously. Much of the progress can be attributed to the work of Pellionisz and Llinas and their associates who developed the tensor network theory in order to give researchers a means to quantify and model central nervous system activities.&lt;ref name="Neuroscience1980-Pellionisz"/&gt;&lt;!--
  --&gt;&lt;ref name="Neuroscience1985-Pellionisz"/&gt;

In 1980, Pellionisz and Llinas introduced their tensor network theory to describe the behavior of the cerebellum in transforming afferent sensory inputs into efferent motor outputs.&lt;ref name="Neuroscience1980-Pellionisz"/&gt; They proposed that intrinsic multidimensional central nervous system space could be described and modeled by an extrinsic network of tensors that together describe the behavior of the central nervous system.&lt;ref name="Neuroscience1980-Pellionisz"/&gt; By treating the brain as a "geometrical object" and assuming that (1) neuronal network activity is [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vectorial]] and (2) that the networks themselves are organized [[tensor]]ially, brain function could be quantified and described simply as a network of tensors.&lt;ref name="Neuroscience1980-Pellionisz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neuroscience1985-Pellionisz"/&gt;
*Sensory input = [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] tensor
*Motor output = [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] tensor
*Cerebellar neuronal network = [[metric tensor]] that transforms the sensory input into the motor output

==Example==

[[File:VOR coordinates.PNG|thumb|300px|Six rotational axes about which the extraocular muscles turn the eye and the three rotational axes about which the vestibular semicircular canals measure head-movement. According to tensor network theory, a metric tensor can be determined to connect the two coordinate systems.]]

===Vestibulo-ocular reflex===
In 1986, Pellionisz described the [[geometrization]] of the "three-neuron [[vestibulo-ocular reflex]] arc" in a cat using tensor network theory.&lt;ref name="VOR arc"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pellionisz|first=Andras|author2=Werner Graf |title=Tensor Network Model of the "Three-Neuron Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex-Arc" in Cat|journal=Journal of Theoretical Neurobiology|date=October 1986|volume=5|pages=127–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "three-neuron [[vestibulo-ocular reflex]] arc" is named for the three neuron circuit the arc comprises. Sensory input into the [[vestibular system]] ([[angular acceleration]] of the head) is first received by the primary vestibular neurons which subsequently [[synapse]] onto secondary vestibular neurons.&lt;ref name="VOR arc"/&gt; These secondary neurons carry out much of the signal processing and produce the efferent signal heading for the [[oculomotor nerve|oculomotor neurons]].&lt;ref name="VOR arc"/&gt;  Prior to the publishing of this paper, there had been no quantitative model to describe this "classic example of a basic [[sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] transformation in the [[central nervous system]]" which is precisely what tensor network theory had been developed to model.&lt;ref name="VOR arc"/&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
Here, Pellionisz described the analysis of the sensory input into the [[vestibular system|vestibular canals]] as the [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] vector component of tensor network theory. Likewise, the synthesized motor response ([[reflex]]ive [[eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]]) is described as the [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] vector component of the theory. By calculating the [[neuronal network]] transformations between the sensory input into the [[vestibular system]] and the subsequent motor response, a [[metric tensor]] representing the [[neuronal network]] was calculated.&lt;ref name="VOR arc"/&gt;

The resulting metric tensor allowed for accurate predictions of the neuronal connections between the three intrinsically orthogonal [[vestibular system|vestibular canals]] and the six [[extraocular muscles]] that control the [[eye movement (sensory)|movement of the eye]].&lt;ref name="VOR arc"/&gt;

==Applications==

===Neural Networks and Artificial Intelligence===
Neural networks modeled after the activities of the central nervous system have allowed researchers to solve problems impossible to solve by other means. [[Artificial neural networks]] are now being applied in various applications to further research in other fields.
One notable non-biological application of the tensor network theory was the simulated automated landing of a damaged F-15 fighter jet on one wing using a "Transputer parallel computer neural network".&lt;ref name=flightcontrol&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pellionisz|first=Andras|title=Flight Control by Neural Nets: A Challenge to Government/Industry/Academia|journal=International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fighter jet's sensors fed information into the flight computer which in turn transformed that information into commands to control the plane's wing-flaps and ailerons to achieve a stable touchdown. This was synonymous to sensory inputs from the body being transformed into motor outputs by the cerebellum. The flight computer's calculations and behavior was modeled as a metric tensor taking the covariant sensor readings and transforming it into contravariant commands to control aircraft hardware.&lt;ref name="flightcontrol"/&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2015}}

'''''The Chips Are Down''''' ({{lang-fr|Les jeux sont faits}}) is a screenplay written by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] in 1943 and published in 1947.  The original title translates literally as "The Plays are Made", an idiomatic French expression used mainly in casino gambling meaning ''the bets have been placed.''  It is also the French translation of [[Alea iacta est]]. An English translation (no longer in print) was made from the French by [[Louise Varese]] in 1948, and published as ''The Chips Are Down''.

The story is set in [[Paris]], in a setting vaguely suggestive of [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German-occupied northern France]] (or perhaps [[Vichy France]]) during [[World War II]]. The plot concerns two characters, Pierre Dumaine and Ève Charlier. They are predestined to be [[soulmate]]s, but this destiny is prevented by their premature violent deaths, and they do not meet until passing into the [[afterlife]].

==Plot synopsis==
Ève and Pierre have never met each other in their respective lives. At the beginning of the book, Ève is very sick, and unknown to her, her husband André is poisoning her in order to marry her sister Lucette and keep the [[dowry]]. Pierre on the other hand is planning a revolution, but is killed by his friend Lucien. Both Pierre and Ève do not realize that they have been dead for a while. Pierre and Ève realize different truths about their own lives as they walk invisibly as ghosts amongst the living, with the power to interact only with other deceased souls. Pierre and Ève have difficulty adjusting to this powerless condition. They meet each other in line to register at a bureaucratic clearing house for the recently deceased where both of them slowly find out that there has been a mistake in the paperwork. They are surprised to learn that according to article 140, they were predestined to be [[soulmate]]s.

Successfully appealing their case, Pierre and Ève are brought back to life and given twenty-four hours to show their love to each other, or their second chance at living will be revoked. However, they are each distracted by unfinished business from their previous lives. Because Ève was poisoned by her husband, she wants to convince her sister that he is not a good man. Pierre wants to stop the revolution to overthrow the Regency that he had planned, because in death he discovered the Regent knew about it, and realizes that if carried out, it will result in the massacre of his friends and the end of the resistance.

Unable to explain the unique circumstances in which they acquired their knowledge, they both have difficulty convincing their friends that they know what is the right thing to do. Neither is able to completely dissociate themselves from the things that were once important to them, and they realize that by not concentrating on their love they might be sacrificing their second chance at life.

==Characters==
'''Pierre Dumaine''' &amp;ndash; Pierre is a leader of an underground resistance movement against the local Regent in the unnamed city in which the story is set. His death was a result of a betrayal by Lucien, another member of the rebellion, and a police informant.

'''Ève Charlier''' &amp;ndash;  Ève is the wife of André Charlier, the Chief of the Militia (''[[Milice]]''). Like Pierre, her death is a result of betrayal. Her husband André slowly killed her by poisoning her drinks as she lay stricken in bed, in order to inherit her wealth and marry her beautiful younger sister for her dowry.

'''André Charlier''' &amp;ndash; Ève's husband,the Chief of the Militia (''[[Milice]]''), who kills her and is warming up to Lucette

'''Lucette''' &amp;ndash; Ève's sister, who is very naive

==Analysis==
Pierre and Ève are permitted to return to the living for the express purpose of falling in love. But in the afterlife they have seen terrible things that they overlooked while living and attempt to prevent these things from occurring, rather than loving one another. After 24 hours, the pair die once more, having accomplished nothing besides saving a young girl, Marie Astruc, whose life Eve and Pierre promised her father (a man referred to in the boutique of the dead) they would improve. While they managed to succeed in their quest to better Marie's life they fail in the consummation of their love. This reinforces Sartre's view that one is condemned to follow one's choices (see [[determinism]]),&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Paul Carrière in ''Le Figaro'' 29 April 1947; in this interview Sartre makes clear that the screenplay is not influenced by the controversial idea of [[existentialism]].&lt;/ref&gt; no matter how good or bad. He also shows that it is impossible to know if a choice is right, even if it is done with the best possible motivations. To Sartre, there is no absolute truth or morality. Instead, he suggests in this screenplay that destiny will always win over the power of life.

Sartre shows that though freedom is perhaps an illusion, it is also a necessity. Pierre and Ève realize the absurdity of death as they wander the streets and witness the problems of friends and loved ones after their second demise. They are powerless to help and thus powerless to relieve themselves of their own suffering in reaction to what they see; they are forced to view life, yet they cannot participate in it themselves since they are mere ghosts. All that keeps us from leading useless, fleeting lives is our power and freedom to interact with the surrounding world according to our own choices.

==Film adaptation==
{{Main|Les jeux sont faits (film)}}
A film adaptation directed by [[Jean Delannoy]] was made in 1947, with [[Micheline Presle]] playing the role of Eve and [[Marcello Pagliero]] as Pierre.

'''Vadym Mykolayovych Tyshchenko''' or '''Vadim Nikolayevich Tishchenko''' ({{lang-ua|Вадим Миколайович Тищенко}}; 24 March 1963 &amp;ndash; 14 December 2015) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Ukrainia]]n [[association football]] player and Ukrainian coach.

==Biography==
Tyshchenko was born on 24 March 1963 in a small city of [[Horodok, Lviv Oblast|Horodok]] near [[Lviv]]&lt;ref name=dvkbvt&gt;Verbitsky, I. ''[http://www.ua-football.com/ukrainian/high/1450142916-dobrodushnyy-velikan-kakim-byl-vadim-tischenko.html Good-tempered giant. Whom was Vadym Tyshchenko]''. [[UA-Football]]. 15 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; in a family of Mykola Romanovych Tyshchenko from [[Sumy Oblast]]. When Vadym was 12, he moved to [[Lviv]] and enrolled in the Lviv sports boarding school (today Lviv Sports College).&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt; His first football coach was Fred Bushansky.&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt; Among his classmantes was [[Bohdan Samardak]] and many others.&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt; In the tenth grade Tyshchenko joined [[Komsomol of Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt; He graduated the boarding school back 1981 and soon appeared in [[Vinnytsia]] playing for the [[Soviet Second League|Second League]] team [[FC Nyva Vinnytsia|Nyva Vinnytsia]] that was coached by [[Yukhym Shkolnykov]].&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt;

In 1983 Nyva placed fifth in the Second League and Tyshchenko was approached by scouts of [[Dynamo Kyiv]] and joined the big club.&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt; In 1984 together with the team he visited the [[United States]] and got a $40 hair cut.&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt; Tyshchenko did not stayed in the club for long and after a year ran away.&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt; In 1985 as part of military obligation, he joined [[SKA Karpaty Lviv]] that played in the [[Soviet First League]].&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt; Tyshchenko played for the club two full seasons in 77 games scoring 11 goals.&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt;

Finally, in 1987 [[Yevhen Kucherevsky|Kucherevsky]], who noticed Tyshchenko when he played for Nyva, invited him to [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]].&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt; In 1988 Tyshchenko became a champion of the Soviet Union playing for Dnipro.&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt; Yet already since 1987 [[Valeriy Lobanovsky|Lobanovsky]] started to invite him for the [[Soviet Union national football team]].&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt; Tyshchenko however most of his time dedicated to the [[Soviet Union Olympic football team]] that won gold medals in [[Seoul]].&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt; He did not played a single game in finals, but also received the [[Olympic gold medal]].&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt; Tyshchenko had to miss most of the [[1988 Soviet Top League]] season and the [[1988 European Championship]] (where Soviet team lost in the final) due to his injury of [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] that he received on 12 March 1988 playing against [[Metalist Kharkiv]].&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt; He was hospitalized to one of [[Moscow]]'s hospitals.&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt; Tyshchenko however returned to [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]] in 1989 and that season the club won the [[Soviet Cup]].&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt; He also was a candidate for the national team, but later did not make list for the finals in [[Italy]] ([[1990 FIFA World Cup]]).&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt;

Tyshchenko stayed with Dnipro for another couple of years during which the [[Soviet Union]] fell apart and Vadym started to play in the [[Ukrainian Premier League|Higher League of Ukraine]] where Dnipro won bronze medals&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt; against [[Shakhtar Donetsk]]. In 1992 along with [[Volodymyr Horilyi]], he joined [[Hapoel Haifa F.C.]] in [[Israel]] where he played another two season.&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt; Tyshchenko retired in 1994 after he was hospitalized again due to another foot injury already in [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt; During the hospitalization he experienced several surgeries during which had his hip and knee joints replaced.&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt;

In summer of 1996 Tyshchenko returned to Dnipro where he was an assistant of [[Vyacheslav Hroznyi]].&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt; Since then with insignificant pauses, he stayed in the club for some 15 years as coaching staff.&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt;

===Family===
Tyshchenko was married for 27 years to his wife Svitlana.&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt; He was also survived by his daughter Kateryna and son Serhii.&lt;ref name=dvkbvt/&gt;

In [[law]], '''vesting''' is to give an immediately secured right of present or future deployment.  One has a '''vested right''' to an asset that cannot be taken away by any third party, even though one may not yet possess the asset.  When the right, interest, or title to the present or future possession of a legal estate can be transferred to any other party, it is termed a '''vested interest'''.

The concept can arise in any number of contexts, but the most common are [[inheritance]] law and [[retirement plan]] law. In real estate, '''to vest''' is to create an entitlement to a privilege or a right. For example, one may cross someone else’s property regularly and unrestrictedly for several years, and one’s right to an [[easement]] becomes vested. The original owner still retains the possession, but can no longer prevent the other party from crossing.

==Inheritance==
Some [[bequest]]s do not vest immediately upon death of the [[testator]]. For example, many [[Will (law)|will]]s specify that an [[heir]] who dies within a set period (such as 60 days) is not to inherit, and further specify how the corresponding share is to be distributed. This is generally done to obviate disputes over the precise time of death, and to avoid paying taxes twice in rapid succession should multiple members of a family die in the wake of a disaster. Such a bequest does not vest until the expiration of the specified period, because the actual heir cannot be determined with certainty.

It is also possible to give a person, A, a life interest in a property, with the [[Remainder (law)|remainder]] to go to another person or persons, B. If the beneficiary of the remainder cannot yet be known, then the remainder is said not to have vested, and the remainder is said to be [[Remainder (law)#Contingent remainder|contingent]]. This may happen with [[Fee tail|entail]]ed [[Estate (law)|estate]]s, or when property is left in trust to care for a child or relative without heirs. (See [[trust law]] for details).

==Employment==

===Retirement plans===
Vesting is an issue in conjunction with [[employer]] contributions to an [[employee stock option]] plan, deferred compensation plan, or to a retirement plan such as a [[401(k)]], [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]] or [[pension]] plan.

A '''vested right''' is "an absolute right; when a plan is fully vested, the employee has an absolute right to the entire amount of money in the account".&lt;ref&gt;[http://lectlaw.com/def2/u032.htm Lectric Law Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a "basic right that has been granted, or has accrued, and cannot be taken away"; for example. one has a right to a vested [[pension]].&lt;ref&gt;Ballentine's Law Dictionary, p. 577 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the portion ''vested'' cannot be reclaimed by the employer, nor can it be used to satisfy the employer's debts. Any portion not vested may be forfeited under certain conditions, such as termination of employment. The portion invested is often determined [[pro-rata]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Generally, for retirement plans in the [[United States]], employees are fully vested in their own salary deferral contributions upon inception.  For employer contributions, however, the employer has limited options under the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] (ERISA) to delay the vesting of their contributions to the employee. For example, the employer can say that the employee must work with the company for three years or they lose any employer contributed money, which is known as ''cliff vesting''. Or it can choose to have the 20% of the contributions vest each year over five years, known as ''graduated vesting''.

Choosing a vesting plan allows an employer to selectively reward employees who remain employed for a period of time. In theory, this allows the employer to make greater contributions than would otherwise be prudent, because the money they contribute on behalf of employees goes to the ones they most want to reward.

===Ownership in startup companies===
Small entrepreneurial companies usually offer grants of [[common stock]] or positions in an [[employee stock option]] plan to employees and other key participants such as [[independent contractor|contractors]], [[board of directors|board members]], [[Advisory board|advisors]] and major vendors. To make the reward commensurate with the extent of contribution, encourage loyalty, and avoid spreading ownership widely among former participants, these grants are usually subject to vesting arrangements.

Vesting of options is straightforward. The grantee receives an option to purchase a block of common stock, typically on commencement of employment, which vests over time. The option may be exercised at any time but only with respect to the vested portion. The entire option is lost if not exercised within a short period after the end of the employer relationship. The vesting operates simply by changing the status of the option over time from fully unexercisable to fully exercisable according to the vesting schedule.

Common stock grants are similar in function but the mechanism is different.  An employee, typically a company founder, purchases stock in the company at nominal price shortly after the company is formed. The company retains a [[Repurchase agreement|repurchase]] right to buy the stock back at the same price should the employee leave. The repurchase right diminishes over time so that the company eventually has no right to repurchase the stock (in other words, the stock becomes fully vested).

Beginning in the 1990s, vesting periods in the United States are usually 3–5 years for employees, but shorter for board members and others whose expected tenure at a company is shorter. The vesting schedule is most often a [[pro-rata]] monthly vesting over the period with a six or twelve month cliff. Alternative vesting models are becoming more popular including milestone-based vesting and dynamic equity vesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://slicingpie.com/bootstrapper-equity-why-time-based-vesting-is-a-waste-of-time/|title=Perfect Equity Splits for Bootstrapped Startups|work=Slicing Pie|access-date=2017-09-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of both stock and options, large initial grants that vest over time are more common than periodic smaller grants because they are easier to account for and administer, they establish the arrangement up-front and are thus more predictable, and (subject to some complexities and limitations) the value of the grants and holding period requirements for tax purposes are set upon the initial grant date, giving a considerable tax advantage to the employee.

=== Profit sharing plans ===

[[Profit-sharing]] plans are usually vested in ten years, although in some cases a plan may serve essentially as a pension by allowing a limited amount of vesting should the employee retire or leave on good terms after an extended period of employment.

== Vested rights doctrine in zoning law ==
The '''vested rights doctrine''' is the rule of [[zoning]] law by which an owner or developer is entitled to proceed in accordance with the prior zoning provision where there has been a substantial change of position, expenditures, or incurrence of obligations made in good faith by an innocent party under a [[building permit]] or in reliance upon the probability of its issuance.

== Vesting arrangements and terminology==

A "vesting period" is a period of time an investor or other person holding a right to something must wait until they are capable of fully exercising their rights and until those rights may not be taken away.

In many cases vesting does not occur all at once. Specific portions of the rights grant vest on different dates over the duration of the period of the vesting.  When part of a right is vested and part remains unvested, it is considered "partly vested".

In cases of partial vesting, a "vesting schedule" is a table or chart showing the portion of a right that is vested over time; typically the schedule provides for equal portions to vest on periodic vesting dates, usually once per day, month, quarter, or year, in stairstep fashion over the course of the vesting period.  Often there is a cliff by which the first few steps in the graph are missing, so that there is no vesting at all for a period (usually six or twelve months in the case of employee equity), after which there is a cliff date upon which a large amount of vesting occurs all at once.

Some arrangements provide for "accelerated vesting", by which all or a major portion of the unvested right vests all at once upon the occurrence of a specified event such as a termination of employment by the company or acquisition of the company by another. Less commonly, the vesting schedule may call for variable grants or subject to conditions such as reaching milestones or employee performance. "Graded vesting" (vesting after each year until the employee is fully vested) may be "uniform" (e.g., 20% of the compensation vested each year for five years) or "non-uniform" (e.g., 20%, 30%, and 50% of the compensation vested each year for the next three years).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/graded-vesting.asp#ixzz20GyLrEjY Graded Vesting]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27886">[[File:WillyMünzenberg2.jpg|thumb|right|Willi Münzenberg (undated)]]'''Wilhelm "Willi" Münzenberg''' (14 August 1889, [[Erfurt]], Germany – June 1940, [[Saint-Marcellin, Isère|Saint-Marcellin]], France) was a communist [[political activist]]. Münzenberg was the first head of the [[Young Communist International]] in 1919–20 and established the famine-relief and [[propaganda]] organization [[Workers International Relief]] in 1921. He was a leading propagandist for the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) during the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Era]], but later grew disenchanted with Communism due to [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]] of the 1930s. Condemned by Stalin to be purged and arrested for treason,&lt;ref name="KOC"&gt;Koch, Stephen, ''Double Lives: Stalin, Willi Münzenberg and the Seduction of the Intellectuals'', New York: Enigma Books (2004), Revised Edition, pp. 14, 20, 77, 90–91, 333, 362&lt;/ref&gt; Münzenberg left the KPD and in Paris became a leader of the German émigré anti-fascism and anti-Stalinist community until forced to flee the Nazi advance into France in 1940. Arrested and imprisoned by the [[Édouard Daladier|Daladier]] government in France, he escaped prison camp only to be found dead a few months later in a forest near the [[commune]] of [[Saint-Marcellin, Isère|Saint-Marcellin]], France.&lt;ref name="MORA"&gt;Mora, Henri, ''Les vérités qui dérangent parcourent des chemins difficiles'', 29 Septembre 2008 (retrieved 26 July 2011), p. 2: "On le retrovera mort une corde autour de cou, au pied d'un chêne, le 17 Octobre 1940 (selon le rapport de gendarmerie), dans le bois de Caugnet entre [[Saint-Antoine-l'Abbaye]] et [[Montagne, Isère|Montagne]], près de [[Saint-Marcellin, Isère|Saint Marcellin]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Münzenberg was born 14 August 1889 in [[Erfurt]], in the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]n [[Province of Saxony]] (present-day [[Thuringia]]). The son of a tavern keeper, Münzenberg grew up in poverty. As a young man, he became involved with trade unions and in the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). Following the SPD split in 1914 between the moderate majority (known as the Majority SPD, [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|MSPD]]) and the radical minority (known as the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent SPD]], USPD) over the issue of the First World War, Münzenberg sided with the Independent faction.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

During World War I, Münzenberg often visited [[Vladimir Lenin]] at his home in [[Zürich]], Switzerland. In 1918, Münzenberg was a founding member of the KPD.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Münzenberg was also the head of the [[Young Communist International]] and was the delegate of the YCI to the [[Comintern#2nd World Congress of the Communist International|2nd World Congress of the Communist International]] in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Münzenberg was disappointed that the 2nd Congress was unable to take up the matter of the Young Communist movement due to insufficient time and called an informal conference to discuss the so-called "youth question" for 7 August 1920. See: John Riddell (ed.), ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!: Proceedings and Documents of the Second Congress, 1920.'' In Two Volumes. New York: Pathfinder Press, 1991; vol. 2, p. 773.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
In 1924, Münzenberg was elected to the ''Reichstag'' and served as a member until the banning of the KPD in 1933. Münzenberg was one of the few KPD leaders of [[working-class]] origin, a fact that was a source of immense pride for Münzenberg.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

During the Weimar period, Münzenberg earned the reputation of a brilliant propagandist. His first major success was an effort to raise money and food for the victims of the [[Russian famine of 1921]]. Through his famous Berlin organization ''[[Workers International Relief|Internationale Arbeiter-Hilfe]]'' (International Workers' Aid or IAH, also known as Worker's International Relief or WIR), based in Berlin, Münzenberg was reputed to have sent millions of dollars' worth of aid to the Soviet Union during the famine.&lt;ref&gt;McMeekin, Sean, ''The Red Millionaire: A Political Biography of Willi Münzenberg, Moscow's Secret Propaganda Tsar in the West, 1917-1940'', New Haven, CT: Yale University Press (2004), p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 he launched ''[[Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung]]'', which became the most widely read socialist pictorial newspaper in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Kasper Brasken: Willi Münzenberg und die Internationale Arbeiterhilfe (IAH) 1921 bis 1933: eine neue Geschichte, in: [[Jahrbuch für Forschungen zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung]], No.III/2012, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Münzenberg worked closely with the [[Comintern]] and the Soviet secret police (known as the [[Cheka]] in 1917&amp;ndash;22 and as the [[OGPU]] in 1922&amp;ndash;34) to advance the communist cause internationally.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

In order to broaden the Comintern's influence, Münzenberg created numerous [[front organization]]s he termed "Innocents' Clubs".&lt;ref name="KOC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WIL"&gt;Wilford, Hugh, ''The Mighty Wurlitzer: How the CIA Played America'', Harvard University Press, 2008; pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; These front groups, such the [[Friends of Soviet Russia]], the [[World League Against Imperialism]], and the [[International Worker's Relief]] Fund, were superficially devoted to an undeniably benign cause such as famine relief, anti-imperialism, or peace, but Münzenberg created them to enlist the support of liberals and moderate socialists in defending the Bolshevik revolution.&lt;ref name="KOC"/&gt; As he told a fellow Comintern member, "These people have the belief they are actually doing this themselves. This belief must be preserved at any price."&lt;ref name="WIL"/&gt; The front organizations, in turn, helped fund the acquisition of the Münzenberg Trust, a collection of small newspapers, publishing houses, movie houses, and theatres in locations around the world.&lt;ref name="WIL"/&gt;  Münzenberg, referred to by some as the ''Red Millionaire'', used the businesses to pay for a limousine and an elegantly furnished apartment for himself.&lt;ref name="KOC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WIL"/&gt;

After directing the Comintern's handling of the [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] case in 1925, Münzenberg took charge of the [[League against Imperialism]], created in [[Brussels]] in 1927.&lt;ref name="Pennybacker216-217"/&gt;
The World Congress Against War was held in Amsterdam on 27–29 August 1932 and was attended by more than 2,000 delegates from 27 countries.&lt;ref name="Ceplair1987 79-80"&gt;{{cite book|pages=79–80 |last=Ceplair|first=Larry|title=Under the Shadow of War: Fascism, Anti-Fascism, and Marxists, 1918-1939 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ccjJauxjlIC&amp;pg=PA79|accessdate=2015-03-06 |date=1987|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-06532-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the meeting, Münzenberg formed the permanent [[World Committee Against War and Fascism]], based in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page=22|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/mat_0769-3206_1985_num_1_1_403982?_Prescripts_Search_tabs1=standard&amp; |last=Dreyfus|first=Michel |title=Le fonds féministe à la BDIC |journal=Matériaux pour l'histoire de notre temps |year=1985 |volume=1 |issue=1 |language=French |accessdate=2015-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Executive Committee of the Communist International]] was uncomfortable with Münzenberg's views and replaced him by [[Georgi Dimitrov]]. 
Early the next year, [[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed chancellor of Germany. The World Committee had to move its headquarters to Paris and Münzenberg resumed the leadership.

Dimitrov was arrested and tried on a charge of responsibility for the [[Reichstag fire]].&lt;ref name="Ceplair1987 79-80"/&gt;
The League Against Imperialism organised a countertrial, which concluded that the Nazis had set the 1933 [[Reichstag fire]] themselves.&lt;ref name="Pennybacker216-217"/&gt;

[[Image:Kischdomain1935.JPG|thumb|right|Münzenberg [[Attempted exclusion of Egon Kisch from Australia|sent Czechoslovak writer Egon Kisch to Australia]] where he addressed a crowd of 18,000 in Sydney's Domain, telling Australians of his firsthand experience with the dangers of Hitler's Nazi regime]]
Barred from entering Britain during the trial, Münzenberg toured the northeastern and midwestern United States on a June 1934 speaking tour with Welsh Labour figure [[Aneurin Bevan]], [[Margarete Buber-Neumann|Babette Gross]] and SPD lawyer [[Kurt Rosenfeld]]. Speaking at well-attended rallies at venues like [[Madison Square Garden]] and the [[Bronx Coliseum]], he appeared alongside [[Sinclair Lewis]] and [[Malcolm Cowley]].&lt;ref name="Pennybacker216-217"&gt;From Scottsboro to Munich: Race and Political Culture in 1930s Britain, by Susan Dabney Pennybacker, pages 216-217&lt;/ref&gt;
Later in 1934, Münzenberg's influence reached the antipodes when his Comintern machine sent [[Egon Kisch]] to the All-Australian Conference of the [[Movement Against War and Fascism]] (an Australian Communist Party front organization). What could have been a lowkey visit from an unknown Czech writer quickly polarized Australian society when the [[Joseph Lyons]] government declared Kisch as "undesirable as an inhabitant of, or visitor to, the Commonwealth" and [[attempted exclusion of Egon Kisch from Australia|attempted to exclude Kisch from Australia]]. With the government unable to produce any legal proof that Kisch was a communist, its case collapsed, and Kisch became a popular speaker disseminating Münzenberg's Comintern message. However, attempts to foster a United Front against fascism in Australia eventually came to nothing.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Münzenberg instructed his assistant, fellow Comintern agent [[Otto Katz]], to travel to the United States to garner support for various pro-Soviet and anti-Nazi causes, as part of the 1935 Comintern Seventh World Congress' proclamation of a "Peoples' Front Against Fascism", aka the [[Popular Front]]. Katz made his way to Hollywood, and in July 1936 he formed the [[Hollywood Anti-Nazi League]] with [[Dorothy Parker]].&lt;ref name="KOC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WIL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caute, David, ''The Fellow Travellers: Intellectual Friends of Communism'', Revised edition, New Haven: Yale University Press (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DOH"&gt;Doherty, Thomas, ''Hollywood's Censor: Joseph I. Breen and the Production Code Administration'', New York: Columbia University Press, 2007; pp. 206–207&lt;/ref&gt; Many artists and writers in the U.S. flocked to join the Popular Front, the Anti-Nazi League, and related groups such as the [[League of American Writers]], and movie stars such as [[Paul Muni]], [[Melvyn Douglas]], and [[James Cagney]] all agreed to sponsor the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League.&lt;ref name="WIL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DOH"/&gt;

Münzenberg lived intermittently in Paris from 1933 to 1940. He took a common-law wife, [[Margarete Buber-Neumann|Babette Gross]], a party member who had separated from her husband shortly after her marriage. It has been suggested that during his years in exile, Münzenberg had some role in recruiting [[Kim Philby]] to work for the [[Soviet Union]], but there is no clear evidence. The argument for the theory is that Philby was recruited to work for Soviet intelligence by one of the Münzenberg Trust's front organizations, the [[World Society for the Relief of the Victims of German Fascism]] based in Paris.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Defection==
Until 1936, Münzenberg remained loyal to [[Joseph Stalin]] and to the aims of Soviet foreign policy. In late 1936, fellow KPD exile [[Walter Ulbricht]], who had parted ways with Münzenberg over the latter's refusal to carry out Stalin's directive to purge the KPD, urged him to take up an offer by Bulgarian Communist party leader [[Georgi Dimitrov]], then residing in Moscow, to return there and assume other missions on behalf of the Comintern.&lt;ref name="BRA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DIM"&gt;Dimitrov, Georgi, ''The Diary of Georgi Dimitrov, 1933-1949'', Yale University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Münzenberg refused, stating that he could not go to the Soviet Union unless he had assurances that he could leave Moscow when he was ready. He was also concerned that controls on his movements in Moscow and the inevitable delays in getting permission to visit others would greatly impede his work, and he may also have suspected that he would be implicated and liquidated in the same Stalinist purges his disinformation organizations had previously sought to obscure by propaganda statements.&lt;ref name="BRA"/&gt; Ulbricht appears to have been well aware of Münzenberg's probable fate if he returned to Moscow since he had been communicating to Moscow reports on Münzenberg "deviance" from Stalinist orthodoxy. (One of Ulbricht's coworkers allegedly stated to a party cell, "Wenn Münzenberg gefahren wäre, wäre er schon erschossen" (if Münzenberg had gone [to Moscow], he would have already been shot by now&lt;ref name="BRA"/&gt;). In Paris, Ulbricht revealed to [[Otto Klepper]], the German jurist and former Prussian minister of finance, "Wir schicken ihn nur nach Moskau, damit er erledigt wird" (We're sending him to Moscow so that he is liquidated).&lt;ref name="BRA"/&gt;

Shortly after urging Münzenberg to visit Moscow, Ulbricht traveled to Republican Spain, where his work consisted of identifying "disloyal" German communists (anyone not totally loyal to Stalin) who were fighting on the Republican side in Spain; the men were either returned to the Soviet Union to face a tribunal or executed on the spot.&lt;ref&gt;Wistrich, Robert S., ''Who's Who in Nazi Germany'' (see entry for Ulbricht, Walter), Routledge Press, 2nd ed., 1995; p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FUE"&gt;Fuegi, John, ''Brecht and Company: Sex, Politics and the Making of the Modern Drama'', Grove Press, 2002; p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annan, Noel, ''Changing Enemies: The Defeat and Regeneration of Germany'', Cornell University Press, 1997; p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; From Spain, Ulbricht went directly to Paris, where, over protest from some Committee members, he began purging the Popular Front Committee (PFC) of individuals "disloyal" to Stalin.&lt;ref name="FUE"/&gt; In less than two years "virtually all the writers who had been willing to work closely with the Comintern and their publisher Willi Münzenberg would be driven out or murdered by the [[NKVD]]".&lt;ref name="FUE"/&gt;

Münzenberg was becoming increasingly marginalized by the actions of his Stalinist opponents, and in an October 1937 letter to Dimitrov, he threatened to reveal every detail of his secret work for the Comintern to the public to show that he was being falsely accused.&lt;ref name="BRA"/&gt; In the KPD, which was rapidly being reorganized to conform to Stalinist doctrine, Münzenberg was officially condemned as a traitor who had deviated from Marxism–Leninism.&lt;ref name="BRA"&gt;Braskén, Kasper, ''[https://www.abo.fi/student/media/7957/cowopa22brasken.pdf Hauptgefahr jetzt nicht Trotzkismus, sondern Münzenberg: East German Uses of Remembrance and the Contentious Case of Willi Münzenberg]'', Åbo Akademi University (2011), retrieved 24 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Münzenberg responded by resisting any attempt to expel him from the Communist movement, and his protests and arguments grew in acrimony and intensity. In late 1938, the chairman of the KPD [[Wilhelm Pieck]] concluded during a meeting of party leadership, "Hauptgefahr jetzt nicht Trotzkismus, sondern Münzenberg" (The present danger is not Trotskyism but Münzenberg).&lt;ref name="BRA"/&gt; Unknown to Münzenberg or the leaders of the KPD, his fate had already been determined in 1937 by Stalin.&lt;ref name="DIM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BAY"&gt;Bayerlein, Bernhard H. (ed.), ''Georgi Dimitroff: Tagebücher 1933–1943'' (Ger.), Berlin: Aufbau-Verlag, 2000; p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, Dimitrov had noted in his diary of a private conversation with Stalin regarding Münzenberg in which Stalin had exclaimed, "Münzenberg is a Trotskyist. If he comes (to Moscow), we will arrest him. Give some thought on how to best to lure him here."&lt;ref name="BRA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DIM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BAY"/&gt;

Having been expelled from the German Communist Party (KPD) on trumped-up charges, Münzenberg finally moved into open opposition to Stalin. A final article on the disgraced propagandist in the Comintern journal ''[[Die Internationale]]'' warned, "Unser fester Wille, die Einheit unter den Antifaschistischen herzustellen, unser Gefühl der Verantwortlichkeit vor dem deutschen Volk macht es uns daher zur Pflicht, vor Münzenberg zu warnen. ''Er ist ein Feind!''" ("Our unshaking determination to unify anti-Fascists, our sense of duty before the German people, obliges us to warn them about Münzenberg. ''He is an enemy!)&lt;ref name="BRA"/&gt;

Back in Paris, Münzenberg became a genuine leader of German émigré antifascism and a confirmed anti-Stalinist. His new journal, ''[[Die Zukunft]]'', was the intellectual forerunner of ''Encounter'' and other [[Cold War]] publications.&lt;ref name="KOC"/&gt; Münzenberg continued to work on behalf of antifascist causes throughout Western Europe, where he played a role in organizing the recruitment and acquisition of Soviet arms for the [[International Brigades]] to fight for the Republican side in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name="KOC"/&gt;

However, his time was running out. His closest professional associates in the party, [[Karl Radek]], [[Heinz Neumann]], and countless others were arrested and either shot or worked to death in Soviet concentration camps. [[Margarete Buber-Neumann]], Heinz Neumann's wife and the sister of his common-law wife Babette Gross, was arrested and imprisoned in [[Karaganda]]. The NKVD eventually arranged for her to be handed over to Hitler in 1940, inadvertently saving her life. After spending the war in the relative safety of [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]], she fled at the end of the war, reaching safety with Anglo-American forces just ahead of the advancing Soviet troops.&lt;ref name="KOC"/&gt;

==Death==
In June 1940, Münzenberg fled from Paris, where he had been making anti-Nazi broadcasts, to escape the advance of German forces. While in the south of France, he was imprisoned by the Daladier government at ''Camp militaire de Chambaran'', an internment camp located in the great ''Forêt des Chambarans'' (Chambaran Forest) near the commune of [[Roybon]], in southeastern France.&lt;ref name="MCM"&gt;McMeekin, Sean, ''The Red Millionaire: A Political Biography Of Willi Münzenberg'', New Haven: Yale University Press (2004), pp. 304–305&lt;/ref&gt; There, another camp inmate, unknown to Münzenberg and his colleagues, befriended Münzenberg and proposed that the two of them escape in the chaos of the [[Second Armistice at Compiègne|Armistice]].&lt;ref name="MCM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WILL"&gt;''Willi Münzenberg, Un Homme Contre: Actes, Colloque International'', La Bibliothèque Méjanes, Institut de l'image, Aix-en-Provence (March 1992), pp. 179–181&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources believe the unknown communist was actually an agent of [[Lavrentiy Beria]]'s [[NKVD]].&lt;ref name="MCM"/&gt; Münzenberg agreed, and he, the stranger, and several of Münzenberg's colleagues (including Valentin Hartig, a former SPD official, and [[Hans Siemsen]], Münzenberg's ''[[The Brown Book of the Reichstag Fire and Hitler Terror|Brown Books]]'' collaborator) fled southward, in the direction of the Swiss border {{dubious|reason=the Swiss border is North of Roybon|date=October 2015}}.&lt;ref name="MCM"/&gt; Münzenberg disappeared a few days later;&lt;ref name="MCM"/&gt; it was the last anyone saw of him alive.

On October 17, 1940, in the [[Bois de Caugnet]] between [[Saint-Antoine-l'Abbaye]] and [[Montagne, Isère|Montagne]], near Saint Marcellin,&lt;ref name="MORA"/&gt; French hunters discovered Münzenberg's partially decomposed corpse at the foot of an oak tree.&lt;ref name="MORA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koch, Stephen,''Double Lives: Stalin, Willi Münzenberg and the Seduction of the Intellectuals'', Revised edition. New York: Enigma Books, 2004; p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McMeekin, Sean, pp. 304–305, 369–370&lt;/ref&gt; The initial newspaper report stated that the cause of death was strangulation caused by a "knotted cord"&lt;ref name="MCM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Babette, ''Willi Münzenberg: A Political Biography'', East Lansing: Michigan State University Press (1974), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Survey'', Stanford CA: Stanford University, International Association for Cultural Freedom, Congress for Cultural Freedom, Issues 54-57 (1965), pp. 86–88.&lt;/ref&gt; but other sources state that the cause of death was a [[garrote]] (a weapon usually formed from a knotted rope or cord).&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, Helmut Gruber, ''Willi Münzenberg: Propagandist for and against the Comintern'', International Review of Social History 10, (1965), pp. 188–210.&lt;/ref&gt; The body was found resting upright on the knees, with a knotted cord draped over the skull.&lt;ref name="MCM"/&gt; The knotted cord had apparently snapped soon after the body had been suspended from an overhead branch.&lt;ref name="MCM"/&gt; The police investigation of the circumstances of his death, including the brief coroner's report,&lt;ref&gt;McMeekin, Sean, pp. 304–306: No attempt was made by the coroner to examine the neck vertebrae or the knotted cord to determine the traumatic force used to cause Münzenberg's death, a determination that could have provided evidence of foul play vs. an act of suicide.&lt;/ref&gt; did not interrogate Münzenberg's fellow camp inmates, and cause of death was listed officially as suicide. However, several eyewitnesses at the prison camp, including Valentin Hartig and Hans Siemsen, reported that Münzenberg remained in high spirits both during his days at Chambaran and in the first days of his flight to freedom after which they lost sight of their comrade.&lt;ref name="MCM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McMeekin, pp. 369–370: Only one alleged witness, Heinz Hirth, who first reported his version of Münzenberg's death in 1945 in a special report to the postwar KPD, asserted that the latter was suffering "extraordinary nervous tension". Hirth, who stated that he joined up with Münzenberg "in order to keep watch on him" stated that Münzenberg belatedly acknowledged his deviation from the party, confessing to Hirth that "he had committed very great errors that he could never make good", whereupon he began crying uncontrollably. Hirth claimed that the very next day he found Münzenberg's body hanging from a tree.&lt;/ref&gt; That tends to support the conclusion that Münzenberg was intentionally killed, either by Soviet NKVD agents or by party members acting on Stalin's orders.&lt;ref name="KOC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Conquest, ''The Great Terror: A Reassessment.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1990; p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the end of World War II, members of Münzenberg's circle that had survived both Stalin's purges and the war were closely tracked by the ''Abteilung Personalpolitik'' of the ''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschland'' (SED), the predecessor to the [[Stasi]], the state security service of [[East Germany]].&lt;ref name="BRA"/&gt; Among the most notable was the return to Paris of Münzenberg's former companion, Babette Gross, who, since 1940, had been living in Mexico with the former Prussian finance minister [[Otto Klepper]] &lt;small&gt;([[:de:Otto Klepper|de]])&lt;/small&gt; and married him after returning to Paris in 1947.&lt;ref name="BRA"/&gt; SED agents reported that Gross was "spreading rumors" that Münzenberg had been murdered by Soviet state security agents.&lt;ref name="BRA"/&gt;

Another theory is that Münzenberg was killed by German agents working for the Gestapo, who had apparently infiltrated his organization in 1939.&lt;ref name="BRA"/&gt; One of the most notable documents in the BStU (Bundesbeauftragte für die Stasi-Unterlagen, or East German Stasi state security files) is a letter referring to information obtained from the prewar ''Deutschen Institut für Militärgeschichte'' files in Potsdam. The letter was authored by the head of Haupabteilung I, [[Karl Kleinjung|Generalmajor Kleinjung]] &lt;small&gt;([[:de:Karl Kleinjung|de]])&lt;/small&gt;, to [[Erich Mielke]], who at the time was the Minister of State Security.&lt;ref name="BRA"/&gt; Kleinjung informed him on 10 June 1969 that there was proof that a secret agent of the Gestapo with the code name V 49 had infiltrated Münzenberg's group in 1939.&lt;ref name="BRA"/&gt; The identity of the agent remains unknown.&lt;ref name="BRA"/&gt; The widely circulated theory that he was executed by the NKVD was also countered by the theory of Wilhelm Leo's son, Gerhard, in his reminiscences of the French Résistence - that Wilhelm Leo escaped the Chambaran Internment Camp with Münzenberg and confirmed that he committed suicide, as confirmed by French investigators.{{cn|date=October 2018}}
