Falconer Lecture''' is an award and lecture series which honors "women who have made distinguished contributions to the mathematical sciences or mathematics education". It is sponsored by the [[Association for Women in Mathematics]] and the [[Mathematical Association of America]]. The lectures began in 1996 and were named after the mathematician [[Etta Zuber Falconer|Etta Z. Falconer]] in 2004 "in memory of Falconer's profound vision and accomplishments in enhancing the movement of minorities and women into scientific careers". The recipient presents the lecture at [[MathFest]] each summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Falconer Lectures |url=https://sites.google.com/site/awmmath/programs/falconer-lectures |publisher=Association for Women in Mathematics |accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==
Alison invites publishers to put some of their courses on the platform, some who wish do to so for no monetary return, others in turn agree to provide their content for free on Alison's website due to the shared revenue gleaned 'mostly from advertising and sales of certificates.'&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"/&gt; According to [[The Economist]], the company seeks to drive education through advertising in the manner of television and radio.&lt;ref name=ECONOMIST&gt;{{cite news|title=The Attack Of The MOOCs|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21582001-army-new-online-courses-scaring-wits-out-traditional-universities-can-they|accessdate=26 July 2013|newspaper=The Economist|date=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the online [[pay per click]] advertising revenue model, Alison has founded a business model whereby "learners in the developed countries are essentially paying for those in developing countries" while providing the learning materials for free.&lt;ref name="WIRED"/&gt;

==Courses==
Alison currently offers over 1000 courses across certificate and diploma level in ten languages.&lt;ref name="Information Week" /&gt; The certificate level courses necessitate 1–2 hours study with the more rigorous diploma level offerings requiring 9–11 hours study on the part of the learner.&lt;ref name=NYTIMES /&gt; Alison note on their website that "there is no time limit on completing a course, so learners can study entirely at their own pace" and that some of the courses such as the [[Microsoft]] [[Digital Literacy]] Program may take up to 20 hours to complete.&lt;ref name="ALISON HELP 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Long Do Courses Take to Complete?|url=http://alison.com/knowledgebase/entry/49/|work=ALISON: help|publisher=ALISON|accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Alison's courses named ABC IT, a 15–20 hour training suite, is cited by the [[New York Times]] as "covering similar ground" to the [[International Computer Driving License]] without the cost of certification.&lt;ref name=NYTIMES /&gt;

==Reception==
David Bornstein noted that "practical skills training is usually expensive".&lt;ref name=NYTIMES /&gt; Some have argued for the ineffectiveness of the [[MOOC]] model of this kind in delivering real educational impact, highlighting the lack of personal interaction with educators and the high drop-out rate of users with no incentive to commit without any material investment of their own.&lt;ref name=SLATE&gt;{{cite web|last=Rees|first=Jonathan|title=The MOOC Racket|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/07/moocs_could_be_disastrous_for_students_and_professors.html|work=Future Tense: The Slate|publisher=The Slate Group|accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other sources have noted the "sustainable" manner of Alison's operating procedure, [[The Economist]] suggesting that Alison generates "plenty of revenue" on its website while still providing its learning materials of "mostly vocational education" for free.&lt;ref name=ECONOMIST /&gt;

'''Bellur Krishnamachar Sundararaja Iyengar''' (14 December 1918&amp;nbsp;– 20 August 2014), better known as '''B.K.S.

Iyengar's home town, Bellur, was in the grip of the [[Spanish flu|influenza pandemic]] at the time of his birth, and an attack of that disease left the young boy sickly and weak for many years. Throughout his childhood, he struggled with [[malaria]], [[tuberculosis]], [[typhoid fever]], and general [[malnutrition]]. "My arms were thin, my legs were spindly, and my stomach protruded in an ungainly manner," he wrote.

==Education in yoga==
In 1934, his brother-in-law, the yogi [[Tirumalai Krishnamacharya|Sri Tirumalai Krishnamacharya]], asked the 15-year-old Iyengar to come to [[Mysore]], so as to improve his health through yoga practice.&lt;ref name=freedom/&gt; There, Iyengar learned [[asana]] practice, which steadily improved his health.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Krishnamacharya had Iyengar and other students give yoga demonstration in the Maharaja's court at [[Mysore]], which had a positive influence on Iyengar.&lt;ref name=freedom/&gt; Iyengar considers his association with his brother-in-law a turning point in his life&lt;ref name=freedom/&gt; saying that over a two-year period "he (Krishnamacharya) only taught me for about ten or fifteen days, but those few days determined what I have become today!"&lt;ref name="Namarupa Interview"&gt;{{cite journal | others = Interview by R.

|page= 57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Iyengar had very high regard for Krishnamacharya,&lt;ref name="Namarupa Interview"/&gt; and occasionally turned to him for advice, he had a troubled relationship with his guru during his tutelage.&lt;ref name="IBN Interview Pt 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQMv7nb4HLU&amp;feature=BFa&amp;list=PL8E21F1429241A270 |title=Being BKS Iyengar: The enlightened yogi of yoga(part1-2) |publisher=YouTube |date=22 June 2008 |accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning, Krishnamacharya predicted that the stiff, sickly teenager would not be successful at yoga. He was neglected and tasked with household chores. Only when Krishnamacharya's favorite pupil at the time, Keshavamurthy, left one day did serious training start.&lt;ref name="Ruiz"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pag |first=Fernando |url=http://www.yogajournal.com/wisdom/465 |title=Krishnamacharya's Legacy |publisher=Yogajournal.com |accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krishnamacharya began teaching a series of difficult postures, sometimes telling him to not eat until he mastered a certain posture. These experiences would later inform the way he taught his students.&lt;ref name="IBN Interview Pt 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQgrw3iYzR0&amp;feature=BFa&amp;list=PL8E21F1429241A270 |title=Being BKS Iyengar: The enlightened yogi of yoga(part2-2) |publisher=YouTube |date=22 June 2008 |accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching career==
With the encouragement of Krishnamacharya, Iyengar, aged 18,&lt;ref name="notablebiographies" /&gt; moved to [[Pune]] in 1937 to teach yoga. He spent many hours each day learning and experimenting with various techniques.

He taught yoga to several noted personalities including [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], and [[Yehudi Menuhin]].&lt;ref name=sakal1&gt;{{cite news|title=Life is yoga, yoga is life |newspaper=Sakal Times |date=13 December 2012 |url=http://www.sakaaltimes.com/20121213/4658387397657793443.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130216175734/http://www.sakaaltimes.com/20121213/4658387397657793443.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 February 2013 |accessdate=9 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught [[sirsasana]] (head stand) to [[Elisabeth of Bavaria, Queen of Belgium|Elisabeth, Queen of Belgium]] when she was 80.&lt;ref name=queen&gt;{{cite journal |date= September–October 2005|title=Light on Iyengar |journal=Yoga Journal |page=96 |location=San Francisco |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ukDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA96 |accessdate=10 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his other devotees were the novelist [[Aldous Huxley]], the actress [[Annette Bening]], the film maker [[Mira Nair]] and the designer [[Donna Karan]], as well as prominent Indian figures, including the cricketer [[Sachin Tendulkar]] and the [[Bollywood]] actress [[Kareena Kapoor]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

==International recognition==
In 1952, Iyengar befriended the violinist [[Yehudi Menuhin]].&lt;ref name=yehudi1&gt;{{cite news | last =SenGupta | first =Anuradha | title = Being BKS Iyengar: The yoga guru | newspaper =IBNlive-CNN-F¨sÀt | date =22 June 2008 | url =http://ibnlive.in.com/news/being-bks-iyengar-the-yoga-guru/67552-17.html |accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Menuhin gave him the break that transformed Iyengar from a comparatively obscure Indian yoga teacher into an international guru. Because Iyengar had taught the famous philosopher [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], he was asked to go to Bombay to meet Menuhin, who was known to be interested in yoga. Menuhin said he was very tired and could spare only five minutes. Iyengar told him to lie down in Savasana (lying on his back), and he fell asleep. After one hour, Menuhin awoke refreshed and spent another two hours with Iyengar. Menuhin came to believe that practising yoga improved his playing, and in 1954 invited Iyengar to Switzerland. At the end of that visit, he presented his yoga teacher with a watch on the back of which was inscribed, "To my best violin teacher, BKS Iyengar". From then on Iyengar visited the west regularly, and schools teaching his system of yoga sprang up all over the world. There are now hundreds of Iyengar yoga centres.&lt;ref name="BKS Iyengar obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/20/bks-iyengar |title=BKS Iyengar obituary |publisher=theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iyengar made his first visit to the United States in 1956, when he taught in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] and gave several lecture-demonstrations.

In 1966, Iyengar published his first book, ''[[Light on Yoga]]''. It became an international best-seller. {{As of|2005|10|10}}, it has been translated into 17 languages and sold three million copies.&lt;ref name=gather/&gt; ''Light on Yoga'' was followed by titles on [[pranayama]] and aspects of yoga philosophy. Iyengar authored 14 books. (See [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]].)

In 1975, Iyengar opened the Ramamani Iyengar Memorial Yoga Institute in Pune, in memory of his late wife. He officially retired from teaching in 1984, but continued to be active in the world of Iyengar Yoga, teaching special classes, giving lectures, and writing books. Iyengar's daughter, [[Geeta Iyengar|Geeta]], and son, Prashant, have gained international acclaim as teachers.&lt;ref name="BKS"/&gt;

In 2005, Iyengar visited the United States to promote his latest book, ''Light on Life'', and to teach a special workshop at the [[Yoga Journal]] conference in Estes Park, Colorado. 3 October 2005 was declared as "B.K.S.Iyengar Day" by San Francisco city's [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors|Board of Supervisors]].&lt;ref name=gather/&gt; Anthropologist Joseph S. Alter of the [[University of Pittsburgh]] stated that Iyengar "has by far had the most profound impact on the global spread of yoga."&lt;ref name=gather/&gt;  In June 2011, he was presented with a [[commemorative stamp]] issued in his honour by the [[Beijing]] branch of [[China Post]]. There are now over thirty thousand Iyengar yoga students in 57 cities in China.&lt;ref name=chi_visit_hindu&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/article2123617.ece|title=Indian yoga icon finds following in China | location=Chennai, India |work=[[The Hindu]]|first=Ananth|last=Krishnan|date=21 June 2011 |accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The noun "Iyengar" is defined by [[Oxford Dictionaries]] as "a type of Hatha yoga focusing on the correct alignment of the body, making use of straps, wooden blocks, and other objects as aids in achieving the correct postures."&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite web |first=Oxford |last=Dictionaries |title=Iyengar |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Iyengar?q=Iyengar |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |accessdate=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 December 2015, what would have been Iyengar's 97th birthday, he was honoured with a [[Google Doodle]]. It was shown in India, North America, much of Europe, Russia, and Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= 97th birthday of B. K. S. Iyengar|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/bks-iyengars-97th-birthday |accessdate=14 December 2015 |publisher=Google Doodles Archive |date=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal practice==
Iyengar reported in interviews&lt;ref name="Namarupa Interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IBN Interview Pt 1"/&gt; that, at the age of 90, he continued to practice asanas for 3 hours and pranayamas for an hour daily. Besides this, he mentioned that he found himself performing non-deliberate pranayamas at other times.

==Approach to teaching==
Iyengar attracted his students by offering them just what they sought&amp;nbsp;– which tended to be physical stamina and flexibility.&lt;ref name="IBN Interview Pt 1"/&gt; He conducted demonstrations and later, when a scooter accident dislocated his spine, began exploring the use of props to help disabled people practice Yoga. He also drew inspiration from Hindu deities such as Yoga Narasimha and stories of yogis using trees to support their asanas.&lt;ref name="IBN Interview Pt 2"/&gt;

==Recognition by Krishnamacharya==
In an interview, Iyengar said of Krishnamacharya’s endorsement of his teaching style:&lt;ref name="Namarupa Interview"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He [Krishnamacharya] never taught me much about teaching, but he saw me teach. In 1961, he came to Pune and was teaching my daughter and son. He taught them for many hours, but unfortunately they could not get what he was trying to show them. When I came up and asked what was wrong, my daughter told me what she did not understand about a posture. So, I explained to her, "You must stretch from this end to that end". And immediately when Krishnamacharya saw this, he gave me a gold medal known as Yoga Shikshaka Chakravarti, which means "Emperor of Yoga Teachers, Teacher of Teachers". He said I must teach like this and not just in private, but in public.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Family==
In 1943, Iyengar married 16-year-old Ramamani in a marriage that was arranged by their parents in the usual Indian manner. He said of their marriage: "We lived without conflict as if our two souls were one."&lt;ref name="BKS Iyengar obituary"/&gt; Together, they raised five daughters and a son. Ramamani Iyengar died in 1973 aged 46. Later, Iyengar named his yoga institute, the Ramamani Iyengar Memorial Yoga Institute, after her.

Both Iyengar's eldest daughter Geeta (born in 1944) and his son Prashant have become internationally-known teachers in their own right.  The other children of B.K.S. Iyengar are Vanita, Sunita, Suchita, and Savita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=BKS Iyengar Archive Project 2007| publisher =IYNAUS| year=2007}} {{No ISBN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geeta Iyengar is the author of ''Yoga: A Gem for Women'' (2002), and Prashant is the author of several books, including ''A Class after a Class: Yoga, an Integrated Science (1998)'', and ''Yoga and the New Millennium'' (2008).  Geeta and Prashant co-direct the Ramamani Iyengar Memorial Yoga Institute (RIMYI) in Pune.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bksiyengar.com/modules/guruji/geeta.htm Biography: Geeta Iyengar]&lt;/ref&gt;  Iyengar's granddaughter, Abhijata Sridhar Iyengar, trained for a number of years under his tutelage, and is now a teacher both at the Institute in Pune and internationally.

==Philanthropy and activism==
Iyengar supported nature conservation, stating that it is important to conserve all animals and birds.&lt;ref name=zoo/&gt; He donated Rs. 2&amp;nbsp;million to [[Mysore Zoo|Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens, Mysore]], thought to be the largest donation by an individual to any zoo in India.&lt;ref name=zoo&gt;{{cite news | title =Zoo felicitates B.K.S. Iyengar  | newspaper =The Hindu | date =10 June 2009 | url =http://www.hindu.com/2009/06/10/stories/2009061053180300.htm |accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also adopted a tiger and a cub in memory of his wife, who died in 1973.&lt;ref name=zoo/&gt;

Iyengar helped promote awareness of [[multiple sclerosis]] with the Pune unit of the [[List of multiple sclerosis organizations#India|Multiple Sclerosis Society of India]].&lt;ref name=fight&gt;{{cite news | title =BKS Iyengar to participate in multiple sclerosis awareness drive | newspaper =The Indian Express | date =22 May 2010 | url =http://www.indianexpress.com/news/bks-iyengar-to-participate-in-multiple-sclerosis-awareness-drive/622144 |accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iyengar's most important charitable project involved donations to his ancestral village of Bellur, in the Kolar district of Karnataka.  Through a trust fund that he established, he led a transformation of the village, supporting a number of charitable activities there.  He built a hospital, India's first temple dedicated to Sage Patanjali, a free school that supplies uniforms, books, and a hot lunch to the children of Bellur and the surrounding villages, a secondary school, and a college.

==Death==
Iyengar died on 20 August 2014 in Pune, India from [[heart failure]] and [[renal failure]], aged 95.&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/yoga-guru-b-k-s-iyengar-dies-in-pune-hospital/article6333707.ece|title=Yoga guru B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1372">'''Certified Practising Accountant''' ('''CPA''') is the title used by members of the [[CPA Australia]] [[professional accounting body]]. [[Accountants]] practising in Australia have the choice of becoming members of CPA Australia (and hence becoming a Certified Practising Accountant or "CPA"), joining the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Australia]] (and becoming a [[Chartered Accountant]] or "CA") or the [[Institute of Public Accountants]] (and becoming a Public Accountant or "MIPA").

==International context==
The designation ''Certified Practising Accountant'' also exists as an accounting designation in the [[United Kingdom]], unrelated to the Australian CPA designation.   Accountants in the United Kingdom may obtain the Certified Practising Accountant designation through becoming a member of the [[Institute of Certified Practising Accountants]] (ICPA). The ICPA does not require its members to have achieved or possess any formal post-secondary accountancy education at the pre-qualification stage. It does however require a prospective member to have relevant accountancy experience.

'''Co-cultural communication theory''' was built upon the frameworks of [[muted group theory]] and [[standpoint theory]]. The cornerstone of co-cultural communication theory is muted group theory as proposed in the mid 1970s by Shirley and [[Edwin Ardener]].  The Ardeners were [[cultural anthropologists]] who made the observation that most other cultural anthropologists practicing [[ethnography]] in the field were talking only to the leaders of the cultures, who were by and large adult males. The researchers would then use this data to represent the culture as a whole, leaving out the perspectives of women, children and other groups made voiceless by the cultural hierarchy (S. Ardener, 1975).&lt;ref&gt;Ardener, Shirley, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ardeners maintained that groups which function at the top of the society hierarchy determine to a great extent the dominant communication system of the entire society (E. Ardener, 1978).&lt;ref&gt;Ardener, Edwin, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ardener's 1975 muted group theory also posited that dominant group members formulate a "communication system that support their perception of the world and conceptualized it as ''the'' appropriate language for the rest of society".&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, 1998a, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication faculty Stanback and Pearce (1981) referred to these non-dominant groups as "subordinate social groups".  They noted 4 ways in which the non-dominant groups tend to communicate with the dominant groups. They also asserted that "From the perspective of the dominant group, the behaviors in each form of [[communication]] are appropriate. However, the meaning of these behaviors to the members of the lower-statused  group are quite different, making them different forms of communication with different implications for the relations among the groups".&lt;ref&gt;Stanback and Pearce, 1981, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study of communication, Stanback and Pearce as well as Kramarae used muted group theory to help explain communication patterns and social representation of non-dominant cultural groups Kramarae (1981) believed that "those experiences unique to subordinate group members often cannot be effectively expressed within the confinements of the dominant communication system".&lt;ref&gt;Kramarae, 1981, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; She suggested that people within these groups create alternative forms of communication to articulate their experiences. Although, Kramarae used muted group theory to communications strategies of women she suggested that the framework can be applied with equal validity to a number of dominant/non-dominant relationships (Orbe, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, M., 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kramarae (1981)&lt;ref&gt;Kramarae, C., 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; presented three assumptions of muted group theory as applied to communication between men and women concluding that women traditionally have been muted by a male-dominated communications system. Additionally, Kramarae proposed seven hypotheses originating in muted group theory.
Standpoint theory was mainly used as a  [[feminist]] theoretical framework to explore experiences of women as they participate in and oppose their own subordination, however, (Smith, 1987)&lt;ref&gt;Smith, D. E., 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the theory had applications for other subordinate groups. A basic tenet of [[standpoint theory]] is that it "seeks to include the experiences of subordinate groups within the process of research inquiry in meaningful ways".&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, 1998a, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;   In other words, the members of the underrepresented groups become co-researchers.

==Theory==
The theory of co-cultural communication was introduced in 1996 by Mark Orbe, professor in the School of Communication at [[Western Michigan University]], when he found previously used names for the groups under consideration to have negative connotations. He cites previous studies which looked at the communication styles of different co-cultural groups which were referred to by a variety of terms.  Orbe was the first to refer to this type of work as "co-cultural communication theory".  Orbe&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, 1996, p.158&lt;/ref&gt; states, "in the past researchers have used a variety of terms to describe co-cultural communication: "intracultural" (Sitaram and Cogdell, 1976); "subordinate", "inferior", "minority" (Stanban and Pearce, 1981); "sub-cultural" (Pearson &amp; Nelson, 1991); (Folb, 1994); and "muted group" (Kramarae, 1981)."&lt;ref&gt;See video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x87QW8Jybk&lt;/ref&gt;

Orbe combined the frameworks of muted group theory with that of standpoint theory to arrive at five fundamental concepts which describe co-cultural theory. Orbe&lt;ref&gt;Orbe,  1998b, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; states, "co-cultural theory seeks to uncover the commonalities among co-cultural group members as they function in dominant society while substantiating the vast diversity of experiences between and among groups."

==Application==
Since the introduction of co-cultural theory in "Laying the foundation for co-cultural communication theory: An inductive approach to studying "non-dominant" communication strategies and the factors that influence them" (1996), Orbe has published two works describing the theory and its use as well as several studies on communication patterns and strategies based on different co-cultural groups.

In Orbe's "A Co-cultural communication approach to intergroup relations" (1997), he provides an overview of co-cultural theory, including an explanation of the process by which co-cultural group members strategically select different communications styles.

Orbe (1998a) "Constructing co-cultural theory: an explication of culture, power, and communication", presents the theoretical framework for co-cultural theory including the development of the theory, clarification of the co-cultural communication process, and limitations and future directions for its use. Orbe (1998b) "From the standpoint(s) of traditionally muted groups: Explicating a co-cultural communication theoretical model", in which he designated 9 co-cultural orientations based on the intersections of three communication approaches: Non-assertive, Assertive, and Aggressive with 3 preferred outcomes: Separation, Accommodation and Assimilation.

In 2000, Orbe and C. M. Greer presented a paper: "Recognizing the diversity of lived experience: The utility of co-cultural theory in communication and disabilities research" at the annual meeting of the [[Central States Communication Association]], in [[Detroit]].  In 2001, Heuman presented "Multiracial/ethnic identity: A co-cultural approach" during the annual meeting of the Central States Communication Association in Cincinnati. During the same meeting Dixon presented "Naming issues in the future of [[intercultural communication]] research: The contributions of Mark Orbe's co-cultural theory".

Orbe (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, M., 2004, pp. 191-211&lt;/ref&gt; used co-cultural theory as a foundation to explore the processes by which public dialogue can be facilitated across cultural boundaries. Orbe and Spellers (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, M. and Spellers, R. E.,2005, pp. 173-191&lt;/ref&gt; reflected in this book chapter on the origins of co-cultural theory from the perspectives of their different areas of research as well as point to implications for future work.

Orbe &amp; Lapinski (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Lapinski, M. K., &amp; Orbe, M., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; published the design of a self-report measure of the two components of co-cultural theory, preferred outcome and communication approach, and provides evidence from two studies for the [[construct validity]] and [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of the co-cultural theory scales (C-CTS).

Ramirez-Sanchez (2008) examines the possibility of applying co-cultural theory to co-cultural groups that are [[marginalized]] in a larger co-cultural context and to "offer a complex cultural context to which co-cultural theory can be applied and generate questions that could serve to enrich the analytical scope of co-cultural theory and its implications".&lt;ref&gt;Ramirez-Sanchez, 2008, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Camara and Orbe published the article "Analyzing Strategic Responses to Discriminatory Acts: A Co-Cultural Communicative Investigation" in the Journal of International and Intercultural Communication. Two authors utilized Orbe's (1998) co-cultural theory model of the 9 communication orientations and 26 communication practices to identify how co-cultural group members response to the acts of discrimination. Two authors used qualitative content analysis to code the participants’ stories. The paper also oriented the directions of future research.

In 2012, Jungmi Jun, an assistant professor of Department of Communication at Wayne State University, published her article "Why Are Asian Americans Silent? Asian Americans' Negotiation Strategies for Communicative Discriminations" in the ''Journal of International and Intercultural Communication''. The author utilized Orbe's co-cultural theory model to explore two questions. One is what types of racially discriminatory messages target Asian Americans; another one is what communicative approaches do Asian Americans apply to negotiate those messages. The paper used content analysis to code 176 stories gained through an online survey. The research found that Asian Americans tend to use nonassertive approaches to respond to racially discriminatory messages due to internal/environmental factors including emotional shock and humiliation, a lack of knowledge of proper responses, peer pressure, and strategic intent.

'''Edmund Henry Elwin''', [[Doctor of Divinity|DD]] (18 September 1871 &amp;ndash; 10 November 1909) was an English Anglican missionary and [[Anglican]] [[Bishop]] of [[Sierra Leone]].

==Biography==
Elwin was educated at [[Dover College]] and [[Merton College]], [[Oxford]], [[England]], where he gained a third class degree in Theology. Later he studied at [[Wycliffe Hall]] in Oxford, a theological training college in the Evangelical tradition.

After his curacy in Oxford, Edmund Elwin became a missionary in [[Sierra Leone]] and soon became Vice Principal of Fourah Bay College which was affiliated to [[Durham University]]. He eventually became Principal and Secretary of the Sierra Leone Mission. When the then Bishop of Sierra Leone became Chaplain General to the British Forces in November 1901, Elwin was appointed his successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Ecclesiastical intelligence |day_of_week=Thursday |date=7 November 1901 |page_number=8 |issue=36606| }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was consecrated as [[Bishop]] by the Archbishop of Canterbury in [[Westminster Cathedral]] 25 January 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Ecclesiastical intelligence|day_of_week=Monday |date=27 January 1902 |page_number=7 |issue=36675| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1902 he received the degree [[Doctor of Divinity]] ''([[Honoris causa]])'' from the [[University of Oxford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Wednesday |date=12 March 1902 |page_number=11 |issue=36713| }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was elected a [[Fellow]] of the [[Royal Colonial Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court Circular |day_of_week=Thursday |date=13 March 1902 |page_number=6 |issue=36714| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elwin died of yellow fever in Sierra Leone on 10 November 1909, a few weeks before being due to return to England as the appointed Bishop of Bristol.  He was the father of [[Verrier Elwin]].

The '''Enhancing Student Mobility through Online Support (ESMOS)''' project is a European-funded partnership between higher education institutions from [[Austria]], [[Bulgaria]], Italy, [[Lithuania]] and the United Kingdom. It has the aims of developing, evaluating and modelling the use of [[Virtual learning environment|Virtual Learning Environments]] and online technologies to support students who take part in either a study exchange ([[ERASMUS]]) or work placement programme (LEONARDO), spending part of their studies overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The ESMOS Project and an SMS Pilot Study with International Exchange Students|author1=H Keegan |author2=L Griffiths |author3=M James |author4=S Whittle |publisher= iop.pcz.pl|url= http://iop.pcz.pl/esmos.org/documents/publications/papers/BBSMS.pdf|format= &amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AThe+ESMOS+Project+and+an+SMS+Pilot+Study+with+International+Exchange+Students&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt;}} {{dead link|date=April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ESMOS has generated interesting and relevant research and practice results from the implementation (Case Studies) of the Methodology, IT Support Model and Guidelines for the Online Support of International Mobility Students. These results have been disseminated widely through journal papers, conference papers, presentations, workshops, training sessions, promotional leaflets and media coverage.

The two-year project is funded by the [[SOCRATES Programme]]/Minerva Action, which seeks to promote European co-operation in the field of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Open and Distance Learning (ODL) in education.

'''''Escape from Childhood: The Needs and Rights of Children''''' is a book by [[John Caldwell Holt]]. {{ISBN|978-0-345-24434-5}}

For most of John Holt’s career as an author he wrote primarily about schooling. ''Escape from Childhood'' still holds ties to the messages of his other books, but it focuses on Holt's thoughts and beliefs about the rights of children in society in general rather than schooling specifically. The book advocates for [[youth rights]] and against [[adultism]] and [[ephebiphobia]], as evidenced in Holt's opening statement, 

:I propose...that the rights, privileges, duties of adult citizens be made available to any young person, of whatever age, who wants to make use of them.&lt;ref&gt; Holt, J. (1974) ''Escape from Childhood'' Boston: E. P. Dutton.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7463">{{Confuse|Folk etymology}}
A '''false etymology''' ('''popular etymology''', '''etymythology''',&lt;ref name="Zuckerman2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann]] |first=Ghil'ad |year=2003 |url=http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9781403917232 |title=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |isbn=978-1403917232}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''pseudo-etymology''', or '''par(a)etymology'''), sometimes called '''folk etymology''' – although the last term is also [[folk etymology|a technical term in linguistics]] – is a popularly held but false belief about the origin or derivation of a specific word.

Such [[etymology|etymologies]] often have the feel of [[urban legend]]s, and can be much more colorful and fanciful than the typical etymologies found in dictionaries, often involving stories of unusual practices in particular subcultures (e.g. Oxford students from non-noble families being supposedly forced to write ''sine nobilitate'' by their name, soon abbreviated to ''s.nob.'', hence the word ''[[Wikt:snob|snob]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/22147/etymology-of-snob |title=nouns – Etymology of "snob" – English Language &amp; Usage Stack Exchange |publisher=English.stackexchange.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/words/what-is-the-origin-of-the-word-snob |title=What is the origin of the word 'snob'? – Oxford Dictionaries Online |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date=2013-08-21 |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many recent examples are "backronyms" ([[acronym]]s made up to explain a term), as in ''snob'', and ''posh'' for "port outward, starboard homeward"; many other sourced examples are listed in the article on [[backronym]]s.

==Source and influence of false etymologies==
Erroneous etymologies can exist for many reasons.  Some are reasonable interpretations of the evidence that happen to be false.  For a given word there may often have been many serious attempts by scholars to propose etymologies based on the best information available at the time, and these can be later modified or rejected as linguistic scholarship advances.  The results of [[medieval etymology]], for example, were plausible given the insights available at the time, but have often been rejected by modern linguists.  The etymologies of [[Humanism|humanist]] scholars in the early modern period began to produce more reliable results, but many of their hypotheses have also been superseded.

Other false etymologies are the result of specious and untrustworthy claims made by individuals, such as the unfounded claims made by [[Daniel Cassidy]] that hundreds of common English words such as ''baloney'', ''grumble'', and ''bunkum'' derive from the [[Irish language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zwicky |first=Arnold |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005098.html |title=Language Log: Gullibility in high places |publisher=Itre.cis.upenn.edu |date=2007-11-09 |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liberman |first=Mark |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003326.html |title=Language Log: The bunkum of "The Bunkum of Bunkum"? |publisher=Itre.cis.upenn.edu |date=2006-07-06 |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association with urban legends==
Some etymologies are part of [[urban legend]]s, and seem to respond to a general taste for the surprising, counter-intuitive and even scandalous. One common example has to do with the phrase ''[[rule of thumb]]'', meaning "a rough guideline". An urban legend has it that the phrase refers to an old English law under which a man could legally beat his wife with a stick no thicker than his thumb.&lt;ref name=thumb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quinion.com/words/qa/qa-rul1.htm |title=World Wide Words: Rule of thumb |publisher=Quinion.com |date=1999-11-13 |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Centuries ago, under common law a man might chastise his wife in moderation, as he might a servant or child.  In 1782 Judge [[Sir Francis Buller, 1st Baronet|Sir Francis Buller]] appears to have codified this as a thin stick: chastisement compared to bludgeoning.&lt;ref name=thumb /&gt;}}

In the [[United States]], some of these scandalous legends have had to do with [[racism]] and [[slavery]]; common words such as ''picnic'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/language/offense/picnic.htm |title=Picnic Pique |publisher=Snopes.com |accessdate=5 March 2018|date=21 January 2017|last= Mikkelson|first =David}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''buck'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/language/offense/buck.htm |title=Etymology on the phrase 'passing the buck' |publisher=Snopes.com |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''crowbar''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/language/offense/crowbar.asp |title=Etymology of Crowbar |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been alleged to stem from derogatory terms or racist practices. The "discovery" of these alleged etymologies is often believed by those who circulate them to draw attention to racist attitudes embedded in ordinary discourse. On one occasion, the use of the word ''[[Controversies about the word "niggardly"|niggardly]]'' led to the resignation of a US public official because it sounded similar to the unrelated word ''[[nigger]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mniggard.html |title=Is "niggardly" a racist word? |publisher=The Straight Dope |date=2000-01-03 |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivational-Only Popular Etymology (DOPE) versus Generative Popular Etymology (GPE)==

[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] proposes a clear-cut distinction between '''Derivational-Only Popular Etymology (DOPE)''' and '''Generative Popular Etymology (GPE)''':&lt;ref name="Zuckerman2003"/&gt;

* "DOPE consists of etymological reanalysis of a pre-existent lexical item [...] The DOPE producer is applying his/her '''Apollonian Tendency''', the wish to describe and create order, especially with unfamiliar information or new experience [...], the craving for meaningfulness."&lt;ref name="Zuckerman2003"/&gt; DOPE is "merely passive", "mistaken derivation, where there is a rationalization ''ex postfacto''."&lt;ref name="Zuckerman2003"/&gt;
* GPE, on the other hand, involves the introduction of a new sense (meaning) or a new lexical item – see, for example, [[Phono-semantic matching]].

'''Grace Llewellyn''' is an American educator, author, and publisher. Her work in the fields of [[youth liberation]], [[unschooling]] and [[homeschool]]ing is widely regarded. She is the founder of ''Lowry House Publishers'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lowryhousepublishers.com&lt;/ref&gt; founder/director of ''Not Back To School Camp'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbtsc.org&lt;/ref&gt; and founder/director of ''The Hive: Self-Directed Learning for Teens'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehiveforteens.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liberatedlearners.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachermagazine.org/tm/articles/2004/03/01/05grace.h15.html "Grace under pressure"], ''Teacher Magazine.'' March 1, 2004. Retrieved 4/5/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
After teaching for three years, Llewellyn came across the work of [[John Holt (educator)|John Holt]] (a pioneer in youth rights theory), which led her to re-consider her approach to education{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}. In 1991, at age 26, she wrote ''[[The Teenage Liberation Handbook: How to Quit School and Get a Real Life and Education]]''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schaeffer|first1=Brett|title=Grace Under Pressure|url=https://www.edweek.org/tm/articles/2004/03/01/05grace.h15.html|work=Education Week Teacher|date=March 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book concludes that education is greater than school, and aims at presenting high-school-aged teenagers with a viable alternative to the United States' compulsory school system. Llewellyn uses examples of rural and urban teenagers who choose various, alternative paths of intentional learning, and she details a variety of possible ways that teens can pursue a rich and multifaceted education and go on to attend college, without attending high school. She emphasizes using personal interests as motivation to learn in a meaningful, real-world context.

One reviewer, Jamie Littlefield, says, "Llewellyn sympathizes with teenagers who get a sub-par education, wasting hours of their time on worksheets, "classroom management," and other needless time-busters. Instead of such waste, she contends that teens should quit school and take charge of their own learning. ...this book isn't just about lofty philosophical ideas. Llewellyn backs her claim with hundreds of pages of practical suggestions on how to claim responsibility for your educational life."

Llewellyn published the ''Teenage Liberation Handbook'' through her publishing company, Lowry House Publishers. Since its release, the book has sold tens of thousands of copies, and in 1998 it was revised and released in an international edition.

==Not Back to School Camp==
In 1996, Llewellyn started a summer camp called [[Not Back to School Camp]], or NBTSC, attracting teens from all over the U.S., Canada, and other countries with opportunities to grow spiritually, emotionally, creatively, physically and intellectually. Llewellyn founded the camp as a response to the reactions of teens garnered by the ''Handbook''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; NBTSC offers campers support in pursuing varied avenues of education by connecting them with a pool of unschooling peers (about 100 other campers per session) and an eclectic staff.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.nbtsc.org Not Back to School Camp], Retrieved 4/5/2008.&lt;/ref&gt; NBTSC activities range from kung fu to cob-oven building to Zimbabwean singing to college applications, reflecting the talents and interests of staff and campers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Today, Llewellyn continues to direct NBTSC, and she lives in [[Eugene, Oregon]] with her son. Since 2017, Llewellyn has directed [http://www.thehiveforteens.org/ The Hive], a Self-Directed learning center for teens. The center is an alternative to traditional school that follows the 22-year tested [http://liberatedlearners.net/about/what-is-the-north-star-model/ Liberated Learners model] pioneered by [[North Star Self-Directed Learning for Teens|North Star]].

==Bibliography==
Llewellyn's best known book is ''[[The Teenage Liberation Handbook: How to Quit School and Get a Real Life and Education]]'' ({{ISBN|0-9629591-7-0}})

Mortenson was accused of financial irregularities in handling donations to the CAI and falsehoods in his books. In 2012, Mortenson repaid $1 million to the CAI after an inquiry by the Montana Attorney General, though no criminality was found.

==Early life==
Mortenson was born in 1957 in [[St. Cloud, Minnesota]]. His parents, Irvin and Jerene, went with the Lutheran Church to [[Tanganyika]] (now [[Tanzania]]) in 1958 to be teachers in at a girls' school in the Usambara mountains. In 1961, Dempsey became a fundraiser and development director for the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center,&lt;ref name=kcmc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcmc.ac.tz|title=Karibu|publisher=Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre|accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first teaching hospital in Tanzania. Jerene was the founding principal of [[International School Moshi]].&lt;ref name=ismoshi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ismoshi.org|title=Welcome to International School Moshi|publisher=International School Moshi|accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spending his early childhood and adolescence in Tanzania, Mortenson learned to speak fluent [[Swahili language|Swahili]].&lt;ref name=ismoshi/&gt;&lt;ref name=goreads&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goreads.me/three-cups-tea-greg-mortenson?page=0,16|title=Three Cups of Tea|publisher=Go Reads|accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/printmember/mor0bio-1 Academy of Achievement Living History Museum online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016153213/http://achievement.org/autodoc/printmember/mor0bio-1 |date=2011-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wingspan.lccc.wy.edu/issues/Mar11/Mortenson/gregMortenson.html Will Herbert, “Speaker to Promote Peace Through Education” Laramie County Community County Wingspan March 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324061205/http://wingspan.lccc.wy.edu/issues/Mar11/Mortenson/gregMortenson.html |date=2011-03-24 }}; accessed December 9, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, when he was 15 years old, Mortenson and his family left Tanzania and moved back to Minnesota. He attended Ramsey High School in [[Roseville, Minnesota]], from 1973–75, where he graduated.&lt;ref name=usd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usd.edu/press/news/news.cfm?nid=818|title=Over 1,000 Candidates to Receive Degrees During 2006 Spring Commencement at The U|publisher=University of South Dakota|accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humanitarian work and career==
===Origins in K2===
[[File:K2 2006b.jpg|thumb|K2]]
Mortenson describes the origins of his humanitarian work in his best-selling (but later discredited) book, ''[[Three Cups of Tea]]''. He states he traveled to northern [[Pakistan]] in 1993 to climb the world's second-highest mountain, [[K2]], as a memorial to his sister, Christa. After more than 70 days on the mountain located in the [[Karakoram]] range, Mortenson failed to reach the summit. Earlier, Mortenson and fellow climber, Scott Darsney, were also involved in a 75-hour life-saving rescue of another climber, Etienne Fine, which put them in a weakened state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alpinejournal.org.uk/Contents/Contents_1995_files/AJ%201995%2037-46%20Pratt%20K2.pdf|title=Against All Odds: Expeditions|publisher=The Alpine Journal|date=1995|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the rescue, he descended the mountain and set out with a local [[Balti people|Balti]] porter, Mouzafer Ali, to the nearest city.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

According to the now-discredited account in ''Three Cups of Tea'', Mortenson stated he took a wrong turn on the trail and ended up in the small village of [[Korphe]]. Physically exhausted, ill, and alone at the time of his arrival there, Mortenson was cared for by some of Korphe's residents while he recovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gregmortenson.com/Articles/FeaturedArticles/02-07-02NPR.html "Fresh Air"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401074647/http://www.gregmortenson.com/Articles/FeaturedArticles/02-07-02NPR.html |date=2008-04-01 }}, with Terry Gross, National Public Radio (NPR), February 7, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unlikely"&gt;Elizabeth Bumiller. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/18/world/asia/18tea.html "Unlikely Tutor Giving Military Afghan Advice"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As a gesture of gratitude to the community for their assistance to him, Mortenson said he would build a school for the village after he noticed local students attending school in an outdoor location and writing out their lessons in the dirt.

Mortenson has since admitted in a 2011 interview that the timing in the [[Korphe]] account in ''Three Cups of Tea'' is inaccurate, and that the events actually took place long after his descent from K2, over a longer period of time and during separate trips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=April 18, 2011|title=Mortenson Concedes He Conflated Parts of Memoir|first=Stephanie|last=Strom|work=New York Times|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/18/mortenson-concedes-he-conflated-parts-of-memoir}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mortenson speaks"&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview: Greg Mortenson Speaks|first=Alex |last=Heard|date=April 18, 2011|work=[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]|url=http://outsideonline.com/adventure/travel-ga-greg-mortenson-interview-sidwcmdev_155690.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literacy in Central Asia===
[[File:Defense.gov photo essay 090715-N-0696M-323.jpg|thumb|left|Mortenson and [[Mike Mullen]] in Afghanistan in 2009]]
Mortenson has written and spoken widely about the importance of education and literacy for girls worldwide. He has further stated that girls' education is the most important investment all countries can make to create stability, bring socio-economic reform, decrease [[infant mortality]] and population explosion, as well as improving health, hygiene, and sanitation standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gregmortenson.com/Articles/FeaturedArticles/03-05-06%20Parade%20Article.pdf "Another Way to Stop Terrorism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924023700/http://www.gregmortenson.com/Articles/FeaturedArticles/03-05-06%20Parade%20Article.pdf |date=2015-09-24 }}, ''Parade'' magazine'', March 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; His view is that "fighting terrorism" perpetuates a cycle of violence where there should instead be a global priority to "promote peace" through education and literacy, with an emphasis on educating girls.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

''Three Cups of Tea'' describes his travels in Pakistan's [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North-West Frontier Province]] including his escape from a 2003 firefight between Afghan [[opium]] warlords, how he was subject to two ''[[fatwā]]s'' by conservative Islamist clerics for [[educating girls]], and receiving hate mail and threats from fellow [[United States|Americans]] for helping educate [[Muslim]] children.&lt;ref name=pbsnow&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/now/news/309-transcript.html|title=Transcript: Greg Mortenson on Building Schools in Afghanistan and Pakistan|publisher=PBS NOW|accessdate=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tea&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mortenson, Greg|author2=Relin, David Oliver|date=January 22, 2009|title=Three Cups of Tea: The Young Reader's Edition|isbn=978-0-8037-3392-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[op-ed]] columnist and friend of Mortenson's, [[Nicholas D. Kristof]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kristof: 'Reserve Judgment' On 'Three Cups Of Tea' Author Mortenson|date=April 21, 2011|first=Mark |last=Memmott|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/04/21/135595686/kristof-reserve-judgment-on-three-cups-of-tea-author-mortenson|publisher=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the schools built by CAI have local support and have been able to avoid retribution by the Taliban and other groups opposed to girls' education because of community "buy-in", which involves getting villages to donate land, subsidized or free labor ("[[sweat equity]]"), wood and resources.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

As of 2014, CAI reports it has established or significantly supported over 300 projects, including 191 schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explorersweb.com/everest_k2/news.php?url=3000-cups-of-tea_1396643715|title=Greg Mortenson's Saga Not Over Yet: ExWeb Interview with "3000 Cups of Tea" Producers|publisher=Explorers Web|date=April 15, 2014|accessdate=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in rural and often volatile regions of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan.&lt;ref name=ikat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikat.org/wp-includes/documents/masterprojectlist.pdf |title=Master Project List &amp; Key |publisher=Central Asia Institute |accessdate=February 8, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720045101/http://www.ikat.org/wp-includes/documents/masterprojectlist.pdf |archivedate=July 20, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central Asia Institute==
[[File:GregMortensonKhandayPakistan2006-12-16USMC.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Mortenson with children in Pakistan in 2006]]
After experiencing frustration in his efforts to raise money for the school, Mortenson convinced [[Silicon Valley]] computer pioneer [[Jean Hoerni]] to fund the building of the Korphe school.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Romano, [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&amp;s_site=mercurynews&amp;p_multi=SJ&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB7206EC5408A67&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM  "Memorial Service Set Feb. 13 for Scientist Jean Hoerni, 72"], ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', February 3, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoerni, who was critically ill at the time, formed the [[Central Asia Institute]] so that he and others could make tax-exempt donations to support Mortenson's work,&lt;ref name="krakauer" /&gt; and Mortenson became its first executive director. The mission of the non-profit organization is to promote education and literacy, especially for girls, in remote mountain regions of Pakistan and [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stmartin.edu/whatsnew/MediaReleases/2010/20100423NoblePeacePrizeGregMortenson.aspx|title=Nobel Peace Prize nominee Greg Mortenson to speak at Saint Martin's University on May 13|publisher=[[Saint Martin's University]]|date=April 23, 2010|accessdate=June 30, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127030444/http://stmartin.edu/whatsnew/MediaReleases/2010/20100423NoblePeacePrizeGregMortenson.aspx|archivedate=November 27, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/51-0376237/central-asia-institute.aspx|title=Mission Statement|publisher=GuideStar|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2006 through 2011, Greg Mortenson promoted his book as well as fundraising and promoting [[girls' education]] through public speaking events at schools throughout the United States. Travel expenses for his speaking engagements were paid for by Central Asia Institute through the end of 2010.&lt;ref name=boardresponse&gt;[http://www.ikat.org/wp-includes/documents/60minutesresponses.pdf Board of Directors, Central Asia Institute responds to 60 Minutes questions, April 16, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429080321/http://www.ikat.org/wp-includes/documents/60minutesresponses.pdf |date=April 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortenson personally kept the money received in exchange for his service as a public speaker as well as royalties from the sale of his book.&lt;ref name = boardresponse/&gt; In 2009, the total cost of his book promotion, fundraising, and awareness-building for girls education paid for by CAI amounted to $4.6 million.&lt;ref name="ikat.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ikat.org/wp-includes/documents/Financials/CAIAuditedFSFYE%209-30-09.pdf |title=Financial Report, 2009 |accessdate=2011-04-21 |date=May 21, 2010 |publisher=Central Asia Institute |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720021724/https://www.ikat.org/wp-includes/documents/Financials/CAIAuditedFSFYE%209-30-09.pdf |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, after a year long investigation by the Montana attorney general, Mortenson agreed to repay $1 million to the CAI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/entertainment/movie-guide/Three+Cups+author+must+repay+charity+million/6420660/story.html |title=Three Cups author must repay charity $1 million |publisher=[[Vancouver Sun]] |date=2012-04-06 |accessdate=June 21, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=March 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Montana inquiry had found that he had misspent over $6 million of the organization's money, although no criminality was found. [[Montana Attorney General]] [[Steve Bullock (American politician)|Steve Bullock]] said: "Mr Mortenson may not have intentionally deceived the board or his employees, but his disregard for and attitude about basic record-keeping and accounting for his activities essentially had the same effect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=BBC|title=Three Cups of Tea author must pay $1m to his charity|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-17634694|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullock also wrote in the report that "CAI's mission is worthwhile and important," and "Its accomplishments, driven by the vision and dedication of Mortenson, are significant – as even their harshest critics acknowledge."&lt;ref name=bozeman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/article_77e76d9e-7f3c-11e1-beee-0019bb2963f4.html|title=Greg Mortenson, Central Asia Institute mismanaged money, reach $1M settlement with attorney general's office|publisher=Bozeman Daily Chronicle|accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Mortenson was required to resign as executive director and could no longer serve as a voting member of CAI's board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bullock |first=Steve |title=Montana Attorney General's Investigative Report of Greg Mortenson and Central Asia Institute |url=https://files.doj.mt.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012_0405_FINAL-REPORT-FOR-DISTRIBUTION.pdf |accessdate=2012-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027082246/https://files.doj.mt.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012_0405_FINAL-REPORT-FOR-DISTRIBUTION.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was allowed to remain with CAI as an employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flandro|first=Carly|title=Mortenson, CAI mismanaged money, but will be able to continue work in the future|url=http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/article_dabeb576-7f91-11e1-a001-001a4bcf887a.html|accessdate=2012-10-24|newspaper=Bozeman Daily Chronicle|date=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mortenson and [[David Oliver Relin]] are co-authors of the ''New York Times'' bestselling book ''[[Three Cups of Tea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/books/bestseller/0316bestpapernonfiction.html?scp=1&amp;sq=three+cups+of+tea&amp;st=nyt "Paperback Nonfiction Bestsellers"], ''The New York Times'', March 16, 2008,&lt;/ref&gt; ''Listen to the Wind'', a 32-page book Young Reader's version of ''Three Cups of Tea'' for ages 4–8, was written by Greg Mortenson and illustrated by Susan Roth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2010-12-26/paperback-books/list.html | title = Best Sellers: Children's Paperback Books | work = New York Times | date = 26 December 2010 | accessdate = 21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a ''New York Times'' bestseller for 97 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0803730586|title=Listen to the Wind: The Story of Dr. Greg &amp; Three Cups of Tea|first=Greg|last=Mortenson|date=22 January 2009|publisher=Dial Books|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; As detailed in a ''[[New York Times]]'' article, Relin "suffered emotionally and financially as basic facts in the book were called into question" and ultimately committed suicide on November 15, 2012.&lt;ref name="Relin"&gt;Leslie Kaufman.

===''60 Minutes'' and Jon Krakauer===
On the April 17, 2011 broadcast of [[CBS News]]' ''[[60 Minutes]]'', correspondent [[Steve Kroft]] alleged inaccuracies in Mortenson's books ''Three Cups of Tea'' and its sequel, ''Stones into Schools: Promoting Peace with Books, Not Bombs, in Afghanistan and Pakistan'' as well as financial improprieties in the operation of the [[Central Asia Institute]].&lt;ref name=cbsnews /&gt;

''60 Minutes'' asked Mortenson for an interview prior to their broadcast.

In an April 2011 ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]'' magazine interview, Greg Mortenson insisted that Krakauer contacted him only once and inaccurately claimed that he had been trying to get a hold of him for some time. He claimed although he arranged to meet with Krakauer, the interview was eventually cancelled "once I realized how deep and dirty this whole thing was".&lt;ref name="mortenson speaks"/&gt;

Mortenson wrote a statement in response to the allegations against him that were published in the ''[[Bozeman Chronicle]]'': "I stand by the information conveyed in my book, and by the value of CAI's work in empowering local communities to build and operate schools that have educated more than 60,000 students", and added, "The time about our final days on K2 and ongoing journey to Korphe village and Skardu is a compressed version of events that took place in the fall of 1993..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mortenson under fire from '60 Minutes' — Bozeman philanthropist denies allegations|author=Gail Schontzler|url=http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/article_4d3125cc-67d7-11e0-b861-001cc4c002e0.html|newspaper=Bozeman Daily Chronicle|date=April 15, 2011|accessdate=April 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, writing for ''Outside Online'', Grayson Schaffer investigated Mortenson's claims regarding Korphe, and found them likely spurious, as there was no plausible way for Mortenson to have ended up in Korphe while descending K2 in the route he claimed. Additionally, Schaffer concludes that there is no evidence that Mortenson was actually an accomplished Himalayan climber, even though he claimed to have climbed six Himalayan peaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Can't Get There From Here|author=Grayson Schaffer|url=https://www.outsideonline.com/1895581/cant-get-there-here|newspaper=Outside Online|date=April 27, 2011|accessdate=November 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon Krakauer]], a former financial supporter of CAI, questioned Mortenson's accounts of his exploits independently and was interviewed for the ''60 Minutes'' segment mentioned above. The day after the broadcast, Krakauer released his own allegations in a lengthy online article, ''[[Three Cups of Deceit]] - How Greg Mortenson, Humanitarian Hero, Lost His Way''.&lt;ref name="krakauer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004XHVOW4|title=Three Cups of Deceit: How Greg Mortenson, Humanitarian Hero, Lost His Way (Kindle Single) - Kindle edition by Jon Krakauer.

In response to Krakauer's allegations, CAI produced a comprehensive 'Master Project List' on work CAI had completed, or currently was then working on. The list was released in December 2011.&lt;ref name=ikatorg/&gt;

In January 2014, Mortenson was interviewed on ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' by [[Tom Brokaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2014/0121/Greg-Mortenson-speaks-out-in-first-interview-since-60-Minutes-expose|title=Greg Mortenson speaks out in first interview since '60 Minutes' exposé|author=Husna Haq|work=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=January 21, 2014|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He apologized and acknowledged that he had let a lot of people down, and said "I failed in many ways, and it's an important lesson."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/books/three-cups-author-greg-mortenson-i-let-lot-people-down-2D11961320|title='Three Cups' author Greg Mortenson: 'I let a lot of people down'|author=Eun Kyung Kim|work=Today|date=January 21, 2014|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014 Krakauer wrote a follow-up article for [[The Daily Beast]] in which he stated that an audit of CAI's overseas projects indicated that the charity was still "beset by widespread corruption" and that Mortenson remaining as the public face of the charity was not "in the best interest of the charity or the people it serves".&lt;ref name=krakauerbeast/&gt; He concluded that "anyone thinking about donating to CAI should probably reconsider".&lt;ref name=krakauerbeast/&gt;

===Lawsuits===
In May 2011, [[Jean Price]] and [[Michele Reinhart]], and Dan Donovan, a [[Great Falls, Montana|Great Falls]] attorney, filed a class action lawsuit against Mortenson on behalf of readers, asking federal judge James Malloy in Missoula to place all proceeds from the purchases of Mortenson's books into a trust to be used for humanitarian purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Giglio|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/05/06/greg-mortenson-sued-for-fraud-and-racketeering-for-three-cups-of-tea.html|title=Greg Mortenson Sued for Fraud and Racketeering for 'Three Cups of Tea'|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=2011-05-06|accessdate=December 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2011/SHOWBIZ/05/06/montana.mortenson.lawsuit "Planned lawsuit targets charity, author of 'Three Cups of Tea'"],  ''[[CNN]]'', May 7, 2011; retrieved December 9, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=complaint&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/050611mortensonlawsuit.pdf Complaint against Greg Mortenson and CAI, May 5, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Several named plaintiffs dropped the lawsuit after confessing they had never read the books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zoomers.ca/profiles/blogs/illinois-woman-drops-lawsuit?xg_source=activity Price drops out of lawsuit in Montana]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kbzk.com/news/illinois-woman-joins-lawsuit-against-mortenson|title=Illinois woman joins lawsuit against Mortenson|publisher=KBZK.com|accessdate=2012-06-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313134827/http://www.kbzk.com/news/illinois-woman-joins-lawsuit-against-mortenson/|archivedate=2012-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/jul/7/apnewsbreak-woman-drops-three-cups-of-tea-suit/print "Woman Drops out of Three Cups of Tea Lawsuit"], Washington Times'', July 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/article_a811e23e-a7fa-11e0-9695-001cc4c03286.html Illinois Woman Drops Lawsuit Against Mortenson], missoulian.com; accessed December 9, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in federal court in May 2012.

In May 2015, the Montana Attorney General stated that Central Asia Institute and Mortenson had completed the terms of a three-year compliance monitoring period, and CAI stated that the IRS had completed its examination of the nonprofit.

===''3000 Cups of Tea''===
Jennifer Jordan (Mortenson's longtime friend) and Jeff Rhoads began attempting to refute the claims against Mortenson and made a 2016 documentary ''3000 Cups of Tea''. In the film and interviews Jordan claims that the extensively-researched and sourced accusations against Mortenson put forward by ''60 Minutes'' and Jon Krakauer are largely not true.

Jordan said in 2014: "We are still investigating this story. So far, our findings are indicating that the majority of the allegations are grossly misrepresented to make him appear in the worst possible light, or are outright false. Yes, Greg is a bad manager and accountant, and he is the first to admit that, but he is also a tireless humanitarian with a crucially important mission." However, the "documentary" she and Rhoads produced consisted of little more than friends of Mortenson claiming that he was a good person who would never do the things the ''60 Minutes''/Krakauer investigation uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.3000cupsoftea.org/about-the-film.php | title=About the Film | work=3000 Cups of Tea | accessdate=December 9, 2017 | author=Jennifer Jordan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="3000 Cups of Tea Interview"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.explorersweb.com/everest_k2/news.php?url=3000-cups-of-tea_1396643715 | title=Greg Mortenson's Saga Not Over Yet: ExWeb Interview with "3000 Cups of Tea" Producers | publisher=ExplorersWeb | date=April 15, 2014 | accessdate=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gresham College''' is an institution of higher learning located at [[Barnard's Inn]] Hall off [[Holborn]] in [[Central London]], [[England]]. It does not enroll students and does not award any degrees. It was founded in [[1597]] under the [[will (law)|will]] of Sir [[Thomas Gresham]], and it hosts over 140 free [[public lecture]]s every year. Since 2001, all lectures have also been made available online.

==History==
===Founding and early years===
Sir Thomas Gresham, founder of the [[Royal Exchange (London)|Royal Exchange]], left his estate jointly to the [[City of London Corporation]] and to the [[Mercers' Company]], which today support the college through the Joint Grand Gresham Committee under the presidency of the [[Lord Mayor of London]]. Gresham's will provided for the setting up of the College – in Gresham's mansion in [[Bishopsgate]], on the site now occupied by [[Tower 42]], the former NatWest Tower – and endowed it with the rental income from shops sited around the [[Royal Exchange (London)|Royal Exchange]], which Gresham had established.

The early success of the College led to the incorporation of the [[Royal Society]] in 1663,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/Gresham-College-and-Arunde-House/|title=Gresham College and Arundel House - Royal Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which pursued its activities at the College in Bishopsgate before moving to its own premises in Crane Court in 1710. The College remained in Gresham's mansion in Bishopsgate until 1768, and moved about London thereafter until the construction in 1842 of its own buildings in Gresham Street EC2. Gresham College did not become part of the [[University of London]] on the founding of the University in the 19th century, although a close association between the College and the University persisted for many years. Since 1991, the College has operated at [[Barnard's Inn|Barnard’s Inn Hall]], [[Holborn]] EC1.

===Gresham College today===
Since 2000, the college regularly welcomes visiting speakers who deliver lectures on topics outside its usual range, and it also hosts occasional seminars and conferences.  Today the college provides in the region of 130 lectures a year, all of which are free and open to the public.

Although many of the lectures are held in Barnard's Inn Hall, the majority are now held in the lecture hall at the [[Museum of London]], for reasons of capacity.

Since 2001, the college has been recording its lectures and releasing them online in what is now an [http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/past archive] of over 2,000 lectures. Since 2007, lectures have also been available through [[YouTube]] with 20,755,968 views {{as of|2018|August|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1t6kKXoBvjdr8m9KJ2Fx7A|title=GreshamCollege|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual lectures series of particular note hosted by the college include: the Gresham Special Lecture, the Annual Lord Mayor's Event, and the [[Gray’s Inn]] Reading.

The College does not enroll any students and awards no [[academic degree|degrees]].

==Professors==
[[File:Barnard's Inn Hall (Gresham College).jpg|thumb|Barnard's Inn Hall, the current home of Gresham College]]The seven original Gresham College Professorships that date back to the origins of the college are as follows:

* [[Gresham Professor of Astronomy|Astronomy]]
* [[Gresham Professor of Divinity|Divinity]]
* [[Gresham Professor of Geometry|Geometry]]
* [[Gresham Professor of Law|Law]]
* [[Gresham Professor of Music|Music]]
* [[Gresham Professor of Physic|Physic]]
* [[Gresham Professor of Rhetoric|Rhetoric]]

These original endowed chairs reflect the curriculum of the medieval [[university]] (the [[trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]]); but as a place for the public and frequent voicing of new ideas, the college played an important role in [[the Enlightenment]] and in the formation of the Royal Society. Early distinguished Gresham College professors  included [[Christopher Wren]], who lectured on astronomy in the 17th century and [[Robert Hooke]], who was Professor of Geometry from 1665 until 1704.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gresham.ac.uk/gresham-professor-of-geometry|title=Gresham Professor of Geometry|work=gresham.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Gresham College, 1740.jpg|thumb|275px|Gresham College, engraving by [[George Vertue]], 1740|left]]The professors received £50 a year, and the terms of their position were very precise, for example:

:''The geometrician is to read as followeth, every Trinity term arithmetique, in [[Michaelmas term|Michaelmas]] and [[Hilary term]]s theoretical geometry, in Easter term practical geometry. The astronomy reader is to read in his solemn lectures, first the principles of the sphere, and the theory of the planets, and the use of the [[astrolabe]] and the staff, and other common instruments for the capacity of mariners.''&lt;ref name="Will"&gt;[http://www.gresham.ac.uk/event.asp?PageId=4&amp;EventId=385 "Who invented the calculus? – and other 17th century topics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928035913/http://www.gresham.ac.uk/event.asp?PageId=4&amp;EventId=385 |date=28 September 2007 }} Gresham lecture by Robin Wilson, 16 November 2005. Retrieved 16 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today three further Professorships have been added to take account of areas not otherwise covered by the original Professorships:

* [[Gresham Professor of Commerce|Commerce]], established in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercers.co.uk/gresham-college|title=Gresham College|work=mercers.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[IT Livery Company Professor of Information Technology|Information Technology]], established in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gresham.ac.uk/gresham-college-press-release-260615 "Elizabethan "University" Appoints Professor of IT"], Gresham College press release, 26 June 2015 (accessed 27/07/15)&lt;/ref&gt;

The professors currently hold their positions for three years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uk-universities.net/Universities/Gresham-College.html|title=Profile of Gresham College|work=uk-universities.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; extendable for a fourth year, and give six lectures a year.  There are also regular [[Visiting Gresham Professor|visiting professors]] appointed to give series of lectures at the College, and a large number of single-lecture speakers.

==Gresham Special Lecture series==

'''Hopscotch''' is a [[visual programming language]] developed by Hopscotch Technologies, designed to allow young or beginner [[programmers]] to develop simple projects. Its simple UI allows its users to drag and drop blocks to create scripts of which can be played when activated. Although the language is easy to use, to develop more advanced pieces of code is almost impossible and requires more powerful languages. The use of the language is through an iPad or iPhone supporting Hopscotch. &lt;ref name="Hanselminutes Podcast"&gt;[http://www.hanselminutes.com/417/i-am-teaching-my-daughter-to-code-with-hopscotch-fitzgerald-steele Hanselminutes Podcast, Show #417], Apr 04 2014, titled "I am teaching my daughter to code with Hopscotch - Fitzgerald Steele", 30 minute interview with father whose daughter tried Hopscotch app on iPad.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software development==

The idea sprang from an already existing programming tool, [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch]], where the user drags blocks into scripts in succession to create a script. This is found much easier by children than typing out the code manually like other programming languages tend to use. Though the developers wanted to take a step back from Scratch and make it slightly easier to grasp the concepts and make Hopscotch easier to use, therefore removing many blocks and adding some of their own in hope to make it easier to use.

Hopscotch includes basic programming blocks and functionalities such as variables, sprites (called objects) and text objects, but also features considered more advanced such as self variables, math functions like [[sine]], [[cosine]], modulo, [[tangent]], [[Inverse tangent|inversed tangent]] and more.

The app is updated frequently with more and more features. See "Editor history" below for a short summary of the app updates.

== Editor ==
[[File:Hopscotch iPhone editor.png|thumb|Hopscotch iPhone editor]]
[[File:Hopscotch ipad editor.jpg|thumb|Hopscotch iPad editor|223x223px]]
The Hopscotch app uses a UI very similar to that of [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch]]. Use of the editor is simple, all one has to do is open the editor, tap the object and script you wish to edit, open one of the block tabs, and drag out code blocks. Most code blocks can have numeric, text, or math inputs. e.g. the "move" block. The editor work area is mainly based on a grid divided in X- and Y-coordinates.

=== Editor history ===
The Hopscotch Editor is available on iPhone and iPad. The iPhone version only supported viewing projects until early 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/help-us-test-the-new-iphone-app/10154|title=Help us test the *new* iPhone app!|website=Hopscotch Forum|language=en|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;, when an update supporting editing and account functionality was released. The Hopscotch iPhone projects play in an iPhone format even in the iPad and web player.

=== When blocks/inputs ===
When inputs are the trigger for the script to activate, when a "when" block's input is true (the "when project starts" when block is triggered when one opens the player or taps the refresh button)

&lt;blockquote&gt;list of "when" blocks:&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;play button is tapped&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;character is tapped&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;iPad (iPhone) is tapped&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;() is tapped&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;() is pressed&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;() bumps ()&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;() is touching ()&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;iPad (iPhone) is tilted (up, down, left, right)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;iPad (iPhone) detects a loud noise&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;iPad is shaken&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;() is swiped (up, down, left, right)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;() equals ()&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;() &gt; ()&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;() &lt; ()&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;() != ()&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;object is cloned&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;(&gt;,&lt;,=,!=) (and, or) (&gt;,&lt;,=,!=)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Code blocks ===
Code blocks are the actions completed when the blocks are triggered, code blocks fall into 6 categories: abilities, movement, drawing, looks &amp; sounds, values, and control flow. 
Drag these into and out of the scripts to modify them. Movement blocks make the character move physically on the screen. Ability blocks let you make your own subprogram blocks to duplicate code in a Hopscotch project. Drawing blocks make an object draw stuff. There are 2 “draw” blocks, Draw a Trail and Clear. Draw a trail obviously draws a trail of selected color and width. There are HSB and RGB options for color. Width is determined by the amount of pixels in that trail (citation needed). Looks &amp; sounds blocks are blocks which change the object’s looks (such as size, invisibility and color). Value blocks are blocks that set a value to a specific number or change a value by a specific number. Finally, control flow blocks are blocks that either repeat a code multiple or infinite times, or add a condition which will make the code inside it execute only if the condition is matched. There is 1 exception, the “Create a Clone” block creates a clone of the object. The clone will not execute any of the code programmed for the original object. That’s the job of the “When object is cloned” block.&lt;!-- This section needs to be completed. --&gt;

=== Drawing blocks ===
Drawing blocks in Hopscotch work similar to the [https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html turtle] module in [[Python (programming language)|Python]], allowing easy and more complex art to be coded.

== Player ==
[[File:Hopscotch iPad player.jpg|thumb|Hopscotch iPad player, playing project]]

=== In-app player ===
The Hopscotch player activates the blocks in the scripts upon activation of their individual triggers.

=== Webplayer ===
The "player" is also available on the web (known as the "Webplayer"). The webplayer brings Hopscotchs projects to almost any browser. It is designed to work the same as the in-app player. Although, the webplayer does not have any functionality for coding, uploading or liking projects. The web version of a project is only accessible via it´s unique link that is formatted like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://c.gethopscotch.com/p/(project&lt;/nowiki&gt; id)

== Languages ==
Supported languages:  English, Simplified Chinese, Spanish.

How to change languages in Hopscotch:  iPad  &gt;&gt;  Settings  &gt;&gt; General  &gt;&gt;  Language &amp; Region  &gt;&gt;  iPad Language  &gt;&gt;  (Select a Hopscotch-supported language).

Industrial Technology programs typically include instruction in optimization theory, human factors, organizational behavior, industrial processes, industrial planning procedures, computer applications, and report and presentation preparation.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education Institute of Education Sciences: Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP). Retrieved on October 26, 2009 from http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/cip2000/occupationallookup6d.ASP?CIP=15.0612&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ATMAE Membership Venn Diagram. {{cite web |url=http://atmae.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=227&amp;Itemid=48 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113190247/http://atmae.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=227&amp;Itemid=48 |archivedate=2013-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planning and designing manufacturing processes and equipment is a main aspect of being an industrial technologist. An Industrial Technologist is often responsible for implementing certain designs and processes.
== Accreditation and certification ==

The USA based [[Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering]] (ATMAE), accredits selected collegiate programs in Industrial Technology in the USA. An instructor or graduate of an Industrial Technology program may choose to become a Certified Technology Manager (CTM) by sitting for a rigorous exam administered by ATMAE covering [[Production Planning]] &amp; Control, Safety, Quality, and Management/Supervision.

ATMAE program accreditation is recognized by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA) for accrediting Industrial Technology programs. CHEA recognizes ATMAE in the U.S. for accrediting associate, baccalaureate, and master's degree programs in technology, applied technology, engineering technology, and technology-related disciplines delivered by national or regional accredited institutions in
the United States.(2011)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chea.org/pdf/d_Summary%20for%20ATMAE.pdf ATMAE Scope of Recognition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231001220/http://chea.org/pdf/d_Summary%20for%20ATMAE.pdf |date=2011-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Knowledge base ==

"A career in industrial technology typically entails formal education from an accredited college or university. Opportunities are available to professionals with all levels of education. Those who hold associate degrees typically qualify for entry-level technician and technologist positions, such as in the maintenance and operation of machinery. Bachelor's degree-holders could fill management and engineering positions, such as plant manager, production supervisor and quality systems engineering technologist. A graduate degree in industrial technology could qualify individuals for jobs in research, teaching and upper-level management".&lt;ref name="Benefits of Industrial Technology"/&gt;

Industrial Technology includes wide-ranging subject matter and could be viewed as an amalgamation of [[industrial engineering]] and business topics with a focus on practicality and management of technical systems with less focus on actual engineering of those systems.

Typical curriculum at a four-year university might include courses on [[manufacturing|manufacturing process]], technology and impact on society, mechanical and electronic systems, [[quality assurance]] and [[quality control|control]], [[materials science]], [[packaging]], [[Operations management|production and operations management]], and manufacturing facility planning and design. In addition, the Industrial Technologist may have exposure to more [[Vocational education|vocational-style education]] in the form of courses on [[CNC]] manufacturing, [[welding]], and other tools-of-the-trade in manufacturing.

== Industrial technologist ==

Industrial technology program graduates obtain a majority of positions which are applied engineering and/or management oriented.  Since "industrial technologist" is not a common job title in the United States, the actual bachelor's degree or associate degree earned by the individual is obscured by the job title he/she receives. Typical job titles for industrial technologists having a bachelor's degree include quality systems engineering technologist, manufacturing engineering technologist, industrial engineering technologist, plant manager, production supervisor, etc.&lt;ref name="Benefits of Industrial Technology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Common Industrial Technology Jobs "&gt;{{cite web|title= What Are Some Common Jobs in the Field of Industrial Technology? |url=http://learn.org/articles/What_are_Some_Common_Jobs_in_the_Field_of_Industrial_Technology.html|publisher=utr zfeqaLearn.org|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical job titles for industrial technologists having a two-year associate degree include project technologist, manufacturing technologist, process technologist, etc.&lt;ref name="Benefits of Industrial Technology"/&gt;

A technologist curriculum may focus or specialize in a certain technical area of study. Examples of this includes [[electronics]], [[manufacturing]], [[construction]], [[graphics]], [[automation]]/[[robotics]], [[CADD]], [[nanotechnology]], [[aviation]], etc.

== Technological development in industry ==

A major subject of study is technological development in industry. This has been defined as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* the introduction of new tools and techniques for performing given tasks in production, distribution, data processing (etc.);
* the mechanization of the production process, or the achievement of a state of greater autonomy of technical production systems from human control, responsibility, or intervention;
* changes in the nature and level of integration of technical production systems, or enhanced interdependence;
* the development, utilization, and application of new scientific ideas, concepts, and information in production and other processes; and
* enhancement of technical performance capabilities, or increase in the efficiency of tools, equipment, and techniques in performing given tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, Lewis F. ''Technological Development in Industry: A Business-Economic Survey and Analysis'', ISR Publications, Manchester UK, revised second edition 2003, page 1. {{ISBN|978-0-906321-29-4}}.  
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Studies in this area often employ a multi-disciplinary research methodology and shade off into the wider analysis of [[business]] and [[economic growth]] (development, performance). The studies are often based on a mixture of industrial field research and desk-based data analysis and aim to be of interest and use to practitioners in business management and investment (etc.) as well as academics. In [[engineering]], [[construction]], [[textiles]], [[food]] and [[drugs]], [[chemicals]] and [[petroleum]], and other industries, the focus has been on not only the nature and factors facilitating and hampering the introduction and utilization of new technologies but also the impact of new technologies on the production organization (etc.) of firms and various social and other wider aspects of the technological development process.&lt;ref&gt;''Technological Development In Industry: A Business-Economic Survey and Analysis'', op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

How and When Technological development in industry Performed :
#Technological Processes based always on (Material, Equipment, Human skills and operating circumstances.
#So, If any of these parameters changed, we have to re-calibrate this technology to match the designed product.
#This re-calibration can't be considered as a technology change because industrial technology is not more than an Engineering guide to achieve the required specification of the designed product.
#To calibrate any industrial technology, we should make a documented copy of manufacturing experiments until matching the final product specifications based on original technology, new changed parameters and scientific basics.
#Finally, documentation of the new change should be done to the original industrial technology for that new case as a new addition.
#Any application of industrial technology for 1st time or after a long time stop,Technology processes should be tested by a primary samples triers as a Re-calibration process.

The annual '''International Literature and Psychology Conference (ILPC)''', also called the '''International Conference on Literature and Psychoanalysis''' or '''International Conference in Literature-and-Psychology''',&lt;ref name="clas.ufl.edu"&gt;[http://www.clas.ufl.edu/ipsa/2003/leibovic.htm A History of the International Conference in Literature-and-Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt; provides a forum for the exchange of ideas on the [[Psychology|psychological]] study of [[literature]] and other arts. The conference welcomes papers that deal with the application of psychology—including psychoanalysis, object relations theory, feminist, Jungian, or Lacanian approaches, cognitive psychology, or neuroscience–to the study of literature, film and visual media, painting, sculpture, music, performance, or the other arts.

Participants come from nations around the world including [[France]], [[England]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Hungary]], [[Serbia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]], [[Turkey]], [[Japan]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States of America]]. The PsyArt Foundation, IPSA (at the [[University of Florida]]), along with various other universities, the [[University of Helsinki]], the [[University of Paris]] VII and X, the [[University of Freiburg]], the [[Instituto Superior de Psicologia Applicada]] in [[Lisbon]], and other institutions, have for a number of years sponsored the annual International Conference in Literature and Psychology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clas.ufl.edu/ipsa/intl-gen.htm The International Conference In Literature-And-Psychology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the conference was renamed to '''International Conference on Psychology and the Arts'''.

'''Ismail al-Qabbani''' ({{lang-ar|إسماعيل القباني}}; born in 1898 in [[Asyut Governorate]]–1963) was an [[Egypt]]ian reforming educationalist. He introduced to the [[Education in Egypt|Egyptian education system]] the concept of [[Pragmatism]]. He was also convinced that education in Egypt should be indigenous and rooted in [[Egyptian culture|Egyptian]] and [[Arabic culture]].&lt;ref name=ttrb1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ttrb.ac.uk/viewArticle2.aspx?contentId=13152 |title=Ismail al-Qabbani: Educational Thinker |publisher=Ttrb.ac.uk |date=2007-02-18 |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became Dean of the Institute of Education.

'''Junior Solar Sprint''' ('''JSS''') is a competitive program for 5th- to 8th-grade students to create a small [[solar-powered]] vehicle. JSS competitions are sponsored by the [[Army Educational Outreach Program]] (AEOP), and administered by the [[Technology Student Association]] (TSA). Objectives of JSS are to create the fastest, most interesting, or best crafted vehicle.&lt;ref name="USAEOP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaeop.com/programs/competitions/jss/|title=Junior Solar Sprint|publisher=Army Educational Outreach Program|date=January 14, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skills in [[science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] (STEM) are fostered when designing and constructing the vehicles, as well as principles of [[alternative fuel]]s, [[engineering design]], and [[aerodynamics]].&lt;ref name="Cvent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvent.com/events/2017-junior-solar-sprint/event-summary-e8ce8d1c824945599517fd21b66af5af.aspx|title=About Junior Solar Sprint|publisher=[[Cvent|Cvent, Inc.]]|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Junior Solar Sprint was created in the 1980s by the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL) to teach younger children about the importance and challenges of using [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref name="NREL Intro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/gen/fy01/30828.pdf|title=Junior Solar Sprint: An Introduction to Building a Model Solar Car|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|first=Krisztina|last=Holly|first2=Akhil|last2=Madhani|date=August 23, 2001|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NREL Host"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/gen/fy01/30825.pdf|title=Junior Solar Sprint: Host Guide Book|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|date=September 19, 2001|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project also teaches students how the [[engineering process]] is applied, and how [[solar panel]]s,  [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], and [[aerodynamics]] can be used in practice.&lt;ref name="NREL Intro"/&gt;

Since 2001, the AEOP has funded JSS events. TSA began hosting competitions in 2011, and it became a middle school-level event in 2014.&lt;ref name="USAEOP"/&gt; In association with TSA, [[Pitsco Education]] has sold recommended materials for the project.&lt;ref name="Pitsco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitsco.com/clubs_and_competitions/sustainable_energy_-_competition&amp;loc=mm|title=Sustainable Energy - Competition|publisher=Pitsco Education|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition==
[[File:JSS Car 1.jpg|thumb|A car created for JSS on its shoebox display at the 2017 national TSA conference]]
[[File:JSS Gallery.jpg|thumb|Open viewing for all the JSS entries to the 2017 national TSA conference]]

Since Junior Solar Sprint became a TSA event, the rules for creating the vehicle have been defined in the TSA rulebook. At the conference, the total cost of creating each car must be less than US$50. The team must also document their process in a notebook.&lt;ref name="Cvent rules"/&gt;

During the time trials section, each car is raced three times down a lane {{convert|65|ft|m|0}} long, on a hard surface like a tennis court. To keep the vehicle pointed straight ahead, a guide wire is run across every lane attached by an [[eyelet]]. When the cars are racing, they must remain attached to the wire with no external control. During the race, no modifications are allowed, though anyone may watch.&lt;ref name="Cvent rules"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://custom.cvent.com/F7EAB83BF0404E16A0CA3BC13304CF63/files/event/5653C4C3A46A4746BCE6DBA17FD6BBAA/a4583aab7d904bcfaaba249fd9d5daf0.pdf|title=Junior Solar Sprint|publisher=Cvent|author=Technology Student Association|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NREL Host"/&gt;

The fastest time of the three trials is used for qualification to the semifinal round. In the next stage, a [[Single-elimination tournament|single-]] or [[double-elimination tournament]], cars are raced against each other at the same time, until one of the 16 semifinalists is determined the fastest.&lt;ref name="Cvent rules"/&gt;

Junior Solar Sprint competitions are held at the national-, state-, and some regional-level TSA conferences,&lt;ref name="TSAweb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsaweb.org/Junior-Solar-Sprint|title=Junior Solar Sprint|publisher=Technology Student Association|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other AEOP-hosted locations.&lt;ref name="USAEOP"/&gt; In the event that the site is overcast, and the solar panels won't work, two 1.5 volt AA batteries will be given to each team.&lt;ref name="Cvent rules"/&gt; Judges determine the three best vehicles for each category: speed, craftsmanship, and appearance.&lt;ref name="FSEC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/education/k-12/energywhiz_olympics/jss.htm|title=Junior Solar Sprint|date=2014|accessdate=June 17, 2017|publisher=[[Florida Solar Energy Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 national TSA conference was held June 21–25, in Orlando, Florida, and many middle school students across the country traveled to compete with their vehicles.&lt;ref name="Californian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eccalifornian.com/article/winner-largest-junior-solar-sprint-california-heading-nationals|title=Winner of the largest Junior Solar Sprint in California is heading to nationals|date=June 7, 2017|accessdate=June 15, 2017|author=Special to the East County Californian|work=[[The East County Californian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/communities/east-county/sd-se-alpine-sprintcar-20170530-story.html|title=Alpine kids headed to Florida for solar power sprint car race|first=Karen|last=Pearlman|date=June 5, 2017|work=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team from Joan MacQueen Middle School in [[Alpine, California|Alpine]], [[California]], won first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.registermychapter.com/tsa/nat/Results.aspx|title=2017 National TSA Conference Results|publisher=Technology Student Association|website=RegisterMyChapter.com|date=June 25, 2017|accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/communities/east-county/sd-se-alpine-kids-20170625-story.html|title=Alpine kids bring home sprint car national championship|first=Karen|last=Pearlman|date=June 26, 2017|accessdate=July 1, 2017|work=The San Diego Union Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6150">'''Lightwriters''' are a type of [[speech-generating device]].

Lightwriter is the brand name of Toby Churchill Limited, a British company founded by [[Toby Churchill]].
[[File:SL35 Lightwriter.jpg|right|thumb|SL35 Lightwriter, manufactured from 1994 - 2008]]
[[File:SL40 Lightwriter Connect.jpg|right|thumb| SL40 Lightwriter, manufactured from 2008]]

==About Lightwriters==
Lightwriters are text-to-speech devices - the person who cannot speak types a message on the keyboard, and this message is displayed on two displays, one facing the user and a second outfacing display for the communication partner(s). A [[speech synthesiser]] is also used to provide speech output.

For people who are unable to use a keyboard, some models of Lightwriter offer the option of an on-screen keyboard with selection made by a switch using a scanning technique.

Some models of Lightwriter offer the facility to connect to a printer to provide printed output.

Word prediction is included to make a significant reduction in the number of keystrokes.

The latest model of Lightwriter, the SL40, has a built-in mobile phone which provides text messaging and the option of voice telephony with the synthesised speech sent to the person on the other end and the incoming speech message being broadcast through the Lightwriter's loudspeaker&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abilia.com/en/our-products/communication/communication-devices|title=Communication devices {{!}} abilia.com|website=www.abilia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Lightwriters are available in a wide range of European languages.

==People who use Lightwriters==
Lightwriters are text-to-speech devices and so require some degree of literacy.

Lightwriters are used by many people with acquired speech loss following [[laryngectomy]], [[tracheostomy]], [[stroke]], [[head injury]], or with progressive neurological diseases such as [[Motor Neurone Disease]] (also known as Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis or [[ALS]]), [[Parkinson's Disease]], [[Multiple Sclerosis]] (MS) or [[Huntington's Chorea]].

Lightwriters are also used by people with congenital speech loss with conditions such as [[Cerebral Palsy]] after literacy has been gained.

==Lightwriters in the news==
[[Diane Pretty]] was a British woman diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease who attempted to change British law so she could end her own life with the assistance of her husband without it being classed as assisted suicide, which is illegal in the United Kingdom.
Pretty went to the [[House of Lords]] and the [[European Court on Human Rights]] using her Lightwriter to argue her case, but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pretty v. United Kingdom]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lightwriters in the media==
In the 1998 film [[The Theory of Flight]] starring [[Kenneth Branagh]] and [[Helena Bonham Carter]], she used a Lightwriter while playing the part of a young woman with [[Motor Neurone Disease]].

==The History of Lightwriters==
In 1969 Toby Churchill was working in France when he fell ill after swimming in a polluted lake.  The doctors initially believed he had sunstroke and that the symptoms would soon pass, but became perplexed as he began to deteriorate rapidly and decided to get him back to England as quickly as possible for further treatment, and he was transferred to [[Addenbrookes Hospital]] in Cambridge where doctors could not decide whether the problem was neurological or vascular, and their diagnostic tools were limited since this was before the days of [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]] and [[MRI]] scanners which nowadays can look inside someone's body non-invasively.

[[File:Toby Churchill.jpg|left|thumb|Toby Churchill in 2004]]Within a few days the only voluntary movement Toby had left was an eyeblink, all other physical movement and speech being frozen.  He was then in a state of ‘locked-in syndrome’, where he was perfectly aware of everything that was said to him but unable to respond, a condition eloquently described by [[Jean-Dominique Bauby]] in his book ''[[The Diving Bell and the Butterfly]]''.  Toby’s family and friends had to quickly learn new communication techniques: the use of ‘closed’ questions (ones to which only a “yes” or “no” reply is required - with 1 eyeblink for “yes” or 2 eyeblinks blinks for “no”), and using an alphabet board with auditory scanning “first row?, second row? etc” until Toby blinked to select that row, and the same for each letter across the row.  It was a tedious process but all that was available at that time.

Gradually, some movement returned to his left hand and arm, and a little to his legs, so he was no longer bed-bound and after a few months was transferred to [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]] (National Spinal Injury Unit) for further physiotherapy and rehabilitation and was there introduced to the early [https://web.archive.org/web/20100819235708/http://www.possum.co.uk/eat/communication POSSUM] Row/Column scanner.  While this was less tiring for the communication partner, it was not portable and became unnecessarily slow after Toby had regained hand movement and the ability to type.  Toby then quickly put his engineering skills into practice to design a portable communication aid - a typewriter which instead of typing on paper, typed the message on a display, and this was the logically named the Lightwriter.  Toby had no plans at that time to make more than just for himself but, as he met other people in a similar position, realised that there was a demand for them and started to manufacture them for other people, founding the Company in 1973.

'''Lorenz Educational Press''' is an educational [[publisher]] based in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. The company focuses on educational materials for the [[K–12]] market, including language arts, math, science, social studies, critical thinking, team building, movement and music, and test preparation.&lt;ref name=LEPAboutUs&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.lorenzeducationalpress.com/About.aspx|publisher=Lorenz Educational Press|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its [[parent company]], [[The Lorenz Corporation]], has been in the publishing industry since 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.lorenz.com/about-lorenz|publisher=The Lorenz Corporation|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Lorenz Educational Press was founded in 2008, bringing The Lorenz Corporation into the general education market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KLEO Welcomes The Lorenz Corporation as Newest Vendor Partner|url=http://www.mykleo.com/kleo/modal_media2.html|publisher=KLEO INC|accessdate=10 February 2014|date=13 August 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222172440/http://www.mykleo.com/kleo/modal_media2.html|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within its first year, the company acquired two established companies in the educational market: Milliken Publishing and the Teaching &amp; Learning Company.  In 2011, Lorenz Educational Press began distributing Show What You Know Publishing materials.

==Imprints==
As of February 2014, Lorenz Educational Press has five [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]]s.

===Lorenz Educational Press===
The Lorenz Educational Press imprint focuses on [[supplement (publishing)|supplementary]] materials that are outside of the core [[curriculum]] but can be integrated into those classes. This includes critical thinking, music and movement, team building, and cross-curricular learning.&lt;ref name=LEPAboutUs/&gt;

===Milliken Publishing===
When the Milliken Publishing Company was purchased by Lorenz Educational Press in May 2008, it had been producing supplementary educational products for over 45 years.&lt;ref name=LEPAboutUs/&gt;  The operation, originally based in St. Louis, Missouri, was moved to Dayton, Ohio after the [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dayton firm acquires St. Louis publishing company|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/dayton/stories/2008/05/05/daily22.html|publisher=Dayton Business Journal|accessdate=10 February 2014|date=8 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The materials under this imprint are intended for pre-kindergarten through high school students and cover core curriculum areas, including language arts, math, science, and social studies.

===Teaching &amp; Learning Company===
The Teaching &amp; Learning Company was originally based in Carthage, Illinois, but it was moved to Dayton, Ohio when Lorenz Educational Press purchased the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lorenz Corp. buys Illinois-based company|url=http://mhe.daytondailynews.com/tools/SharedOH/press/press.html?p=1800|publisher=Dayton Daily News|accessdate=10 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222162711/http://mhe.daytondailynews.com/tools/SharedOH/press/press.html?p=1800|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Teaching &amp; Learning Company had been in business for almost 15 years before it was acquired in November 2008.&lt;ref name=LEPAboutUs/&gt;

This imprint includes supplementary materials for preschool through high school. In 1999, Judith S. Gould&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SDE Featured Presenter: Judith Gould|url=http://www.sde.com/onsitetraining/featuredpresenter.asp?id=72&amp;page=list|publisher=Staff Development for Educators|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   and Evan Jay Gould developed the [[Four Square Writing Method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gould|first=Judith S.|title=Four Square Writing Method: A Unique Approach to Teaching Basic Writing Skills, Grades 1-3|year=1999|publisher=Teaching and Learning Co.|isbn=9781573101882|author2=Evan J. Gould }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A series of books based on this method, and written by Judith and Evan Gould and Mary F. Burke, is published by the Teaching &amp; Learning Company.

===Show What You Know Publishing===
Show What You Know Publishing (SWYK) was originally maintained by Englefield &amp; Associates and based in Columbus, Ohio. In 2011, Lorenz Educational Press became the exclusive distributor for Show What You Know Publishing, moving the headquarters to its office in Dayton, Ohio.&lt;ref name=LEPAboutUs/&gt;

This imprint focuses on test-preparation materials for state tests, such as the [[Ohio Achievement Assessment]], [[Ohio Graduation Test]], [[State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness]], [[Measurements of Student Progress]] in Washington, the Colorado Academic Standards tests, and the [[Common Core]] tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lorenz Educational Press|url=http://www.lorenzeducationalpress.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, SWYK launched the web-based program Show What You Know Online, partnering with technology entrepreneurs Robert Ott and Ken Reed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Show What You Know Publishing Introduces Online Program for Common Core|url=http://www.eschoolnews.com/2012/06/01/show-what-you-know-publishing-introduces-online-program-for-common-core/|publisher=eSchool News|accessdate=10 February 2014|date=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and with Sunburst Digital for national sales and marketing.&lt;ref name=PR385867&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunburst Digital Partners with Show What You Know Online|url=http://www.pr.com/press-release/385867|publisher=PR.com|accessdate=10 February 2014|date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The program provides teachers with online assessments and lessons for math and language arts based on either the Common Core State Standards  or the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness.  The lessons include videos from [[Khan Academy]], making the program the first educational system to officially license lesson videos from the educational website.&lt;ref name=PR385867/&gt;

===LEP Interactive===
LEP interactive focuses on digital products, such as interactive whiteboard software and instant downloads.&lt;ref name=LEPAboutUs/&gt;

His research interests cover both theoretical and practical aspects of mathematics thinking, teaching, and learning. His current research draws on [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s historical-cultural school of thought, as well as [[Evald Ilyenkov]]'s epistemology, in a conceptual framework influenced by [[Emmanuel Levinas]] and [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], leading to a non-utilitarian and a non-instrumentalist conception of the classroom and education.

Radford is an editor of the education journal [[For the learning of mathematics]]. In 2011 he was the recipient of the [[Hans Freudenthal]] Medal of the
[[International Commission on Mathematical Instruction]] for his "development of a semiotic-cultural theory of learning".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|department=ICMI Column|journal=[[Newsletter of the European Mathematical Society]]|url=http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2012-06-84.pdf|volume=84|date=June 2012|title=The Hans Freudenthal Medal for 2011 goes to Luis Radford, Université Laurentienne, Sudbury, Canada|pages=49–50}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the editor of book series "Semiotic Perspectives in the Teaching &amp; Learning of Math" with [[Springer Verlag]].

'''Mobile Associate Communication Platform''' (mACP) is primarily used by [[Retail]]ers, [[Restaurant]]s and [[Hospitality]] industries. The platform communicates product knowledge, educational content, internal and external communications, and general communications to field associates. The mACP category marks a major shift in single iPad users’ training and communications.

It’s a sophisticated, highly branded, private broadcast network with instant-on, non-streaming video; a self-publishing interface; granular targeting; real-time metrics; field accessibility; instant, internal global broadcasting from an iPad or desktop; and a simple dashboard interface

Advances that shaped the new mACP category at last fill the gaping void in how [[Learning Management Systems]] (LMS) and [[Learning and Development]] (L&amp;D) departments prepare associates for today’s fast-paced, digitally-influenced in-store selling environment. These advances ultimately deliver the last-mile solution to educating, informing, evaluating and empowering customer-facing employees, allowing them to create the personalized retail engagement and experiences that only the physical store can provide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9710">'''Monsieur Pierre''' was the professional name of '''Pierre Jean Phillipe Zurcher-Margolle''' (born c. 1890, [[Toulon|Toulon, France]] – died 1963, London). He was a professional dancer and dance teacher, largely responsible for introducing the [[Latin American culture|Latin American]] dances to England, and for codifying them, and laying the groundwork for their use in competitions and in [[social dance]]. The system he and his colleagues developed became the basis for all Latin and American competitions held under the [[World Dance Council]] (WDC).

==Early life==
As a young man, Pierre's engineering studies at [[University of Zurich|Zurich University]] were abruptly halted when he was struck in the eye by a tennis ball. This accident resulted in the loss of sight in that eye. After this accident he went to live in Paris where his spare time was spent in the night clubs where Cuban and other Latin immigrants enjoyed their music and dances. He next worked in the French [[Consulate|consular service]] in [[Liverpool]], but was forced to resign when the eye strain began to affect the sighted eye. He moved to London, where he enjoyed [[ice skating]] and dancing. After [[World War I]] ended in 1918 he started on a career as a professional ballroom dancer.&lt;ref name="ISTD Examinations Board p. 62"&gt;Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing 2004. ''100 years of dance: a history of the ISTD Examinations Board'', London. p. 62.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although he spent the rest of his life resident in London, Pierre remained a [[French citizenship|French citizen]] for his entire life.

==Latin dance in England==
The rhythms which make Latin American dance popular were brought to Britain between the two World Wars. Pierre was already an accomplished dancer and teacher in the English ballroom style. In Latin dances, his repertoire first consisted of the [[Argentine Tango|Argentine tango]], the [[Paso Doble|Paso doble]] and the [[Samba (ballroom dance)|Samba]].

:"The tango was always his speciality in demonstrations and as a result many teachers were attracted to it and first learnt it from him." &lt;ref name="ISTD Examinations Board p. 62"/&gt;
:"Pierre had been a celebrated exponent and teacher of tango, dancing first with Countess Gioia, then Mme Bayo, followed by Meredyth Owen. He had established a reputation as the leading specialist for all Latin dances."&lt;ref&gt;[[Lyndon Wainwright|Wainwright, Lyndon]]. ''The story of British popular dance'' (1997), International Dance Publications, Brighton, UK.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

For a number of years Pierre's studio was in or near [[Regent Street]].&lt;ref&gt;Adverts in ''The Dancing Times''. By 1934 the studio was at 28 Heddon Street, off Regent Street.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Doris Lavelle went to him to learn the tango. He quickly realised her potential and after training she became his next dance partner. They demonstrated as often as three nights a week at London restaurants, ballrooms and night clubs, of which there were many at that time. 

By the 1930s Pierre had moved more towards the Latin American dances, and in 1934 his full-page trade adverts featured the rumba.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson PJS (ed) 1934. ''The Dancing Times: Double Xmas issue''. December 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; The studio stayed open all through [[World War II]], and was a popular meeting place for the [[Free French]] fighters on leave in London.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

After the war, the studio was re-established at 15, [[Greek Street]], [[Soho]]. A small studio on the top floor with a good maple floor, and a sound system installed by James Arnell, who later became [[International Latin American Dance Champions|International Latin American dance champion]].&lt;ref name="comedancing"&gt;Spencer, Frank and Peggy. 1968. ''Come dancing''. Allen, London. pp. 137, 179–81.&lt;br&gt;James Arnell won the International Amateur Latin American Championship in its first year (1953) with E. Pescador, and the Professional with Jillian LaValette five years in succession 1955–1959, and 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===The rumba arrives in London===
The ballroom [[Rhumba|rumba]] is so called despite the music, and the dance, being of a different [[Music genre|genre]] from the authentic [[Cuban rumba]]. The rumba danced in America and Europe was, and is, a music of the ''[[Son (music)|son]]'' type: 'rumba' was a marketing term to cover several terms used by Cubans; [[Salsa (music)|salsa]] is a comparable case today.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

In 1932, Monsieur and Madame Chapoul, well known French demonstrators, gave an exhibition of rumba at the ''[[Café de Paris (London)|Café de Paris]]'' in London, followed by [[Don Azpiazú]] and his band, the very group who had had such a hit with their recording of ''Peanut Vendor''. Pierre was present and later went to the ''Cabine Cubaine'' club in Paris to take a look at the dancers.&lt;ref name="comedancing"/&gt;

Originally, Pierre had visited Paris to find out how their dancers and teachers dealt with the rumba. He discovered they used a system devised in the USA, the ''square rumba'', so called after its basic figure. By 1934 he was featuring the rumba in his demonstrations, his adverts, his classes and in magazine articles.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson PJS (ed) 1934. ''The Dancing Times: Double Xmas issue'' (December). Article by Pierre: The basic steps of the rumba, pp. 298-99.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the war, in 1947, Pierre visited Cuba, where he discovered to his surprise that the Cubans danced it differently. When he danced with Suzy of Pepe and Suzy Rivera, the then Cuban champions, according to Lavelle's diary,&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Irene. ''A concise history of Latin American dancing in the UK'' Part II, ISTD LA Faculty website (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; the first thing she said was "you are out of time". So he had a lesson every day and danced at the ''acadamias'' [sic] every night. After this period of study he returned to London determined to replace the square rumba with the Cuban rumba, "el sistema cubano".{{cn|date=March 2018}}

To this end, Pierre wrote the first account of his ideas on the rumba as a dance.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre 1948. ''Latin &amp; American dances for students and teachers''. Self-published, London. In this short book, Pierre gives the square rumba at the start of the book, and the first published account of the Cuban 'rumba' in Chapter 7. This latter was substantially the same as in the finally agreed syllabus of 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans 1992"&gt;Evans, Irene 1992. ''A concise history of Latin American dancing in the UK'' UK Alliance of Professional Teachers of Dancing; also web-site of ISTD LA Faculty.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the characteristics of Cuban dance to the ''son'', and other similar rhythms, was, and still is, their method of taking three steps to four beats of music (whether 2/4 or 4/4). Whereas the Square rumba had been danced on beat 1, the Cuban rumba figure starts on beat 2, counting (pause) 2, 3, 4-1 as (pause) quick, quick, slow with the hip settling over the standing foot on 4-1. All social dances in Cuba involve a hip-sway over the standing leg and, though this is scarcely noticeable in fast salsa, it is more pronounced in the slow ballroom rumba.&lt;ref&gt;Laird, Walter. ''The Laird Technique of Latin Dancing'' (2003). International Dance Publications Ltd. pg. 9.&lt;br&gt;"Transfer full weight to this foot allowing the pelvis to move sideways and back so that the weight is felt to be near the heel of the standing foot. The knee of the supporting leg is locked back." This description incidentally illustrates the difficulty of describing body movements in print.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Latin and American section'' of the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing]] (ISTD) Ballroom Branch was formed in 1947 by Monsieur Pierre as Chairman, his partner [[Doris Lavelle]], and their colleague, Doris Nichols. They were the first examiners, soon joined by [[Gwenethe Walshe]] and [[Dimitri Petrides]]. This small band of specialists worked to establish an examination system and syllabus for both amateur and professional dancers. [[Walter Laird]] and [[Peggy Spencer]], were other important members, among others, added a few years later. The syllabus which was finally agreed in 1955 has been the foundation of teaching and competition in the Latin American dances ever since. This work naturally included the samba, paso doble and [[Jive (dance)|jive]] as well, but it was the composition of the rumba which was critical. After further visits to Cuba in the early 1950s, when Doris Lavelle and James Arnell accompanied Pierre, the [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha cha cha]] was added to make the five Latin American dances that are still the basis of teaching and competition today in the international dance community.&lt;ref name="Evans 1992"/&gt;

On Monsieur Pierre's death in 1963, his colleague Doris Nichols commented:
"The Latin American dancing world was so influenced, fostered and built up by him that the names of 'Pierre' and 'Latin American' became virtually synonymous." &lt;ref&gt;Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing 2004. ''100 years of dance: a history of the ISTD Examinations Board'', London. pg. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Monsieur Pierre was a Fellow, Examiner and committee member of the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing]] (ISTD) and a Member of the [[Official Board of Ballroom Dancing]] (OBBD).

[[File:Valentin Hauy.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Valentin Haüy|Valentin Hauy]].]]

The '''Musée Valentin Haüy''' is a private museum dedicated to tools and education of the [[blindness|blind]], and located in the building of the Valentin Haüy Association, in the [[7th arrondissement of Paris]] at 5, rue Duroc, [[Paris]], [[France]]. It is open Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons without charge.

The museum was established in 1886 by Prof. Edgard Guilbeau of the Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles, and named in honor of [[Valentin Haüy]] (1745–1822), founder of the first school for the blind. It is now operated by the Association Valentin Haüy. The museum contains objects, equipment, and books from 1771 to the present day that document the history of tools and education for the [[visually impaired]].

The '''Natural Sciences Tripos''' ('''NST''') is the framework within which most of the science at the [[University of Cambridge]] is taught. The [[tripos]] includes a wide range of [[Natural Sciences]] from [[physical science]]s to [[biology]] which are taught alongside the [[history and philosophy of science]]. The tripos covers several courses which form the [[University of Cambridge]] system of [[Tripos]]. It is known for its broad range of study in the first year, in which students cannot study just one discipline, but instead must choose three courses in different areas of the natural sciences and one in mathematics.  As is traditional at Cambridge, the degree awarded after Part II is a Bachelor of Arts (BA). A Master of Science degree (MSci) is available to those who take the optional Part III.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cam.ac.uk/about/natscitripos/ Natural Sciences Tripos homepage&lt;/ref&gt; It was started in the 19th Century.&lt;ref name="Bettany1879"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nsttl/&gt;&lt;ref name=studentsguide&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/the-students-guide-to-the-university-of-cambridge/the-natural-sciences-tripos/4AD642E39CDCA633F2214CA9252C5022|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511694158.008|title=The Student's Guide to the University of Cambridge|first=G. D.|last= Liveing|year=1874|authorlink=George Downing Liveing|website=''cambridge.org''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==

Teaching is carried out by 16 different departments. Subjects offered in Part IA in 2010 are Biology of Cells, Chemistry, Computer Science, Elementary Mathematics for Biologists, Evolution and Behaviour, Earth Sciences, Materials Science, Mathematics, Physics, Physiology of Organisms and Mathematical Biology; students must take three experimental subjects and mathematics. There are three options for the compulsory mathematics element in IA: "Mathematics A", "Mathematics B" and  "Mathematical Biology".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/degree/1aquantbio/index.html |title=IA Mathematical Biology Site |access-date=8 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031094750/http://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/degree/1aquantbio/index.html |archive-date=2008-10-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students specialize further in the second year (Part IB) of their [[Tripos]], taking three subjects from a choice of twenty, and completely in their third year (Part II) in, for example, [[genetics]] or [[astrophysics]], although general third year courses do exist – Biomedical and Biological Sciences for biologists and Physical Sciences for chemists, physicists, etc. Fourth year options (Part III) are available in a number of subjects, and usually have an entry requirement of obtaining a 2:1 or a First in second year Tripos Examinations, and is applied for before the commencement of the third year. As of 2008, options with an available Part III option are: [[Astrophysics]]; [[Biochemistry]]; [[Chemistry]]; [[Geological Sciences]]; [[Materials Science]] and [[Metallurgy]]; and [[physics|Experimental and Theoretical Physics]]. {{As of|2018}} the tripos is delivered by sixteen different departments including:
* The [[Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge|Department of Chemistry]]
* The [[Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge|Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology]]
* The Department of Genetics
* The [[Cavendish Laboratory|Department of Physics]]
* The Department of Astronomy
* The Department of Biochemistry
* The Department of Pharmacology
* The [[Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge|Department of Plant Sciences]]
* The [[Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge|Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience]]
* The Department of Zoology
* The Department of Psychology
* The [[Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge|Department of Computer Science and Technology]]
* The [[Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge|Department of Earth Sciences]]
* The [[Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, University of Cambridge|Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy]]
* The [[Department of History and Philosophy of Science, University of Cambridge|Department of History and Philosophy of Science]]

==Motivation==
The University of Cambridge believes that their course's generalisation, rather than specialisation, gives their students an advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxbridgeapplications.com/blog/is-natural-science-right-for-you/|title=Is Natural Science Right For You?|website=''oxbridgeapplications.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, it allows students to experience subjects at university level before specialising. Second, many modern sciences exist at the boundaries of traditional disciplines, for example, applying methods from a different discipline. Third, this structure allows other scientific subjects, such as [[Computer science]]s, [[Mathematics]] (traditionally a very strong subject at Cambridge), Medicine and the [[History of science and technology|History]] and [[Philosophy of science|Philosophy]] of Science, to link with the Natural Sciences Tripos so that once, say, the two-year Part I of the Medical Sciences [[tripos]] has been completed, one can specialise in another biological science in Part II during one's third year, and still come out with a science degree specialised enough to move into postgraduate studies, such as a PhD.

==Student enrolment==
As a result of this structure, the Natural Sciences Tripos has by far the greatest number of students of any Tripos.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Undergraduates who are reading for the NST in order to gain their degrees are colloquially known in University slang as '''NatSci''s (pronounced "Nat-Ski"'s), being broadly nicknamed [[physical science]] ('phys') or [[biological science]] ('bio') NatScis, according to their course choices. (Of course, many students choose both physical and biological options in first year.) The split tends to be about 50:50 between the physical and biological sciences.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In 2007, 2112 students applied and 639 were admitted to the Natural Sciences Tripos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/statistics/subjects.html#natsci Cambridge Undergraduate Admissions Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4582">The '''[[People's Commissar]]iat for Education''' (or '''Narkompros'''; {{lang-ru|Народный комиссариат просвещения, Наркомпрос}}) was the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agency charged with the administration of public education and most other issues related to culture. In 1946, it was transformed into the [[Ministry of Education (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Education]]. Its first head was [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]]. However he described [[Krupskaya]] as the "soul of Narkompros".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aHkkdjbc00UC&amp;pg=PA347&amp;lpg=PA347&amp;dq=Vestnik+teatra&amp;source=web&amp;ots=yB8am4YNP9&amp;sig=5_dy_omF9FoGqYWSlM5Ayj8P1Ak&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPP1,M1 The Commissariat of Enlightenment]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikhail Pokrovsky]] and [[Evgraf Litkens]] also played important roles.
 
Lunacharsky protected most of the avant-garde artists such as [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Vladimir Tatlin]] and [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]]. Despite his efforts, the official policy after [[Joseph Stalin]] put him in disgrace.

Narkompros had seventeen sections,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the main ones related to general education, e.g.,
* [[Likbez]], a section for liquidation of illiteracy,
* "Profobr", a section for professional education,
* [[Glavlit]], a section for literature and publishing (also in charge of censorship in publishing),
* "Glavrepertkom" (Главрепертком), a commission for approval of performers' repertoires.
* Department of the Mobilisation of Scientific Forces, to which the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] reported to after 1918.
* A Theatre Department which published [[Vestnik Teatra]]
* ''Vneshkol'nyi Otdel'', the adult Education Department run by Krupskaya
Some of these evolved into separate entities, others discontinued.

== Relationship with Proletkult ==
[[Pavel Lebedev-Polianskii]], as chair of the organizing bureau for the national [[Proletkult]] argued that Narkompros, as a state organ, had responsibilities for the whole of society, whereas Proletkult asserted its autonomy as an organisation set up specifically for workers. However, there was concern with "parallelism" - the situation which arose when similar work was carried out in parallel by different organisations. In early 1918 Narkompros gave Proletkult a budget of over 9,200,000 rubles, whereas the entire Adult Education Division received 32,500,000 rubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== Izo-Narkompros ==
The Izo-Narkompros (Изо-наркомпрос), or the section of [[visual arts]] (отдел изобразительных искусств) created in May 1918, consisted of two parts: the collegium (deliberative organ) and the section proper (executive organ). The first collegium was headed by [[Vladimir Tatlin]]  and included  [[Kasimir Malevich]], I. Mashkov (И. Машков), N. Udaltsova (Н. Удальцова), O.Rozanova (О. Розанова),  [[Alexander Rodchenko]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. It was subdivided into a number of subsections.

Lunacharsky directed some of the great experiments in public arts after the Revolution such as the [[agit-train]]s and agit-boats, that circulated over all [[Russia]] spreading Revolution and revolutionary arts.

He also gave support to [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism's]] theatrical experiments and the initiatives such as the ''[[ROSTA Windows]]'', revolutionary posters designed and written by Mayakovsky,  Rodchenko, and others.

'''Project GRAD Houston''' (Graduation Really Achieves Dreams), is a non-profit&lt;ref&gt;https://www.guidestar.org/profile/76-0450397&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Houston]] providing free college access, college success, and career advising services.  Project GRAD's mission is to improve lives in low-income communities by helping individuals develop and achieve their educational aspirations.

Founded in 1994 by James and Kathryn Ketelsen,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Former-CEO-James-Ketelsen-who-made-helping-11110836.php&lt;/ref&gt; Project GRAD originally worked in five [[Houston Independent School District|Houston ISD]] high schools: [[Northside High School (Houston)]], [[Wheatley High School (Houston)]], [[Sam Houston Math, Science, and Technology Center]], [[Heights High School]], and [[Yates High School]] offering scholarships through their GRAD Scholar Program to students who met certain requirements as a way to increase graduation rates. From there, GRAD began working in the high school feeder patterns offering educators, math and reading curriculum, and strict disciplinary practices&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/HISD-board-to-vote-on-future-of-Project-GRAD-1886579.php&lt;/ref&gt; to 70 HISD schools.

Nearly 20 years after its founding and after becoming a "nationally renowned college-prep program",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Project-GRAD-changing-its-Houston-model-5097403.php&lt;/ref&gt; Project GRAD shifted away from the scholarship provider model to a community based model outside of the school district. In 2015, in partnership with the [[City of Houston]] and [[Houston Public Library]], Project GRAD brought [http://cafecollege.org cafécollege], originally a San Antonio "'one-stop-shop' for free college access advice, guidance, and workshops"&lt;ref&gt;http://cafecollege.org/&lt;/ref&gt; to Houston in the form of [http://www.cafecollegehouston.org cafécollege Houston]. Staffed by Project GRAD advisors, cafécollege Houston provides free college and career information in English and Spanish to anyone in the greater Houston area.

Project GRAD has had more than 6,800 of its GRAD Scholars enroll in a community college or university and over 2,100 Scholars who have earned a certificate, associate degree or bachelor's degree.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.projectgradhouston.org/who-we-are/our-impact/&lt;/ref&gt;  cafécollege Houston has welcomed over 10,000 visitors and GRAD has provided its services to more than 4,000 Houstonians.

== New Model ==
In December 27, 2013, The Houston Chronicle reported that Project GRAD Houston phased out its local scholarship grants and pulled out staff from the Houston Independent School District. This is where the college preparatory program was founded more than two decades ago to assist financially needy students at problematic institutions. However, this model continued to be practiced in some areas which include Alaska, Atlanta, and Los Angeles. The non-profit organization maintained a hundred employees during its peak. The ISD also gave Project GRAD a subsidy of $5 million until the platform was scrutinized. The last fund grant worth $1.3 million for the Project came in during the 2011 – 20112 school year. After this, the non-profit deemed it necessary to create a different model. Project GRAD uses its yearly budget ($4 million) for 18 employees and 23 AmeriCorps (voluntary civil society program that the US federal government supports) members in area non-profit offices as well as universities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Project-GRAD-changing-its-Houston-model-5097403.php|title=Project GRAD changing its Houston model|work=Houston Chronicle|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Round Table''' or '''Rally Table''' is a strategic learning method and comes under [[cooperative learning]] method.

== Method ==
In this process, the class or the students are divided into groups. This is done to encourage group learning, team building and cooperative learning. It is the written version of Robin Table. The group of students are given a sheet of paper and a pencil. A question is posed to the students in such a manner that the students can write multiple answers for a given question. A timer is set and the students are asked to write the answers. Each student of a group writes one answer and passes the paper to his other group member. Till the time is up, the students keep writing answers by passing the paper in group. After the time is up, the student is asked to read out the answer he has written. This enables the entire group to work together and come up with suitable answers.

== Advantages ==
* Positive Group Work
* [[Brainstorming]]
* Equal Opportunity
* Helps to reflect upon one's thoughts

== Disadvantages ==
* Difficult for slow learners
* Takes more time as it is written than the oral work
* Questions should be clear and concise 
* Questions should be in such a manner that it has multiple answers/approaches

'''Recyclebank ''' is a company based in [[New York City]] that claims to encourage recycling and environmentally-friendly habits. Recyclebank claims to bring together people, businesses, and communities to achieve real world impact by participating in household recycling and teaching how to live more sustainable lifestyles. Over 2 million people have signed up through '''Recyclebank''''s rewards program, which offers magazine subscriptions and discounts among other goods.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.recyclebank.com/about-us|title = Recyclebank|date = |accessdate = 2014-07-15|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recyclebank’s online shop, OneTwine.com claims to  enable members to make more green choices when purchasing products.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url =https://onetwine.recyclebank.com/about-us|title =One Twine|date =2014-07-15|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Certified [[B Corporation (certification)|B Corporation]], Recyclebank is headquartered in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Brief history==

In 2001, New York City was considering cancelling its recycling program.  [https://www.forbes.com/2006/12/19/waste-management-starbucks-whole-foods-ent-manage-cx_mc_1219recycle.html Then Fordham Law student Patrick FitzGerald realized that there was no true economic incentive to encourage people to recycle].  He drafted a business model wherein people would be financially incentivized to recycle, businesses would be able to promote sustainability and cities and municipalities could see the results of dramatically increased recycling rates.  [http://www.newsweek.com/saving-world-latte-89241 In 2003, he contacted an old high school friend of his, Ron Gonen, who was then pursuing his MBA at Columbia.]  Together, the two of them set out to build Recyclebank and a year later, they completed the company’s founding business plan. By 2004, they rolled out a pilot recycling rewards program in Philadelphia. Today, Recyclebank partners with communities all over the country and offers new ways for one to learn, earn points, and shop online.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Further, since 2009, Recyclebank has been a certified B Corporation, meeting B Corporation's standards of social and environmental performance, transparency, and accountability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bcorporation.net/community/recyclebank|title = B Corporation|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recyclebank also partners with [http://www.nativeenergy.com/ NativeEnergy], a company that helps businesses reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, in order to offset its own carbon footprint. Between 2011 and 2012, Recyclebank reduced its carbon footprint by nearly 30% by making smarter travel decisions and being more conscious of its waste and recycling habits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==How it works==
# '''For Members:''' Recyclebank claims to use a mix of education, rewards and impact metrics help people live more sustainable lifestyles. Through online engagement and a recycling incentives program, the company has helped increase recycling rates in some of its 300 member communities, has partnered to recycle nearly 3.8 billion pounds of waste, and helped move people toward a more sustainable future. On Recyclebank’s website, users earn points by working their way through a tiered series of questions and answers, learning about greener living practices and pledging to follow them, and exchanging points for rewards.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://blogs.clicksoftware.com/clickipedia/top-25-best-examples-of-gamification-in-business/|title = Top 25 Best Examples of Gamification in Business|last = Stanley|first = Robert|date = 2014-03-24|work = |accessdate = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140720171644/http://blogs.clicksoftware.com/clickipedia/top-25-best-examples-of-gamification-in-business/|archive-date = 2014-07-20|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''For Communities:''' In some communities, members can also earn points for recycling at home, as Recyclebank partners with municipalities and waste haulers in different cities around the country to track home recycling and reward it. These members who can earn this way are either part of the Collect and Click program, or the Curbside program. The Collect and Click subscribed members are automatically awarded points based on the frequency with which they engage with Recyclebank's website. These members are also able to earn 10 additional points for reporting that they recycled each week. The Curbside members that set out their recycling container are awarded points based on the average weight recycled by participating households on their collection route. Through [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] or [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] technology installed on recycling containers and in the recycling truck, Recyclebank is able to track which households are actually recycling. The collective weight is then converted to Recyclebank points and shared amongst all of the residents in the community that recycled.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# '''For Brands:''' Recyclebank is also an advertising and sponsorship platform able to reach highly engaged consumers. Brands can sponsor content on Recyclebank and promote their own green strides, for example [[Ziploc]], [[Domtar]], and [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] have partnered with Recyclebank to educate enthusiastic green users on how to recycle the products they sell. Once members earn points, they can then redeem them for discounts and deals from community businesses and major national brands like [[SC Johnson]], [[Unilever]], [[Macy’s]], as well as hundreds of community businesses, all found in Recyclebank’s Rewards Catalog. In this way it offers brands a unique opportunity to reach and engage millions of consumers by rewarding people through online and offline touch points.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Gamification==

Recyclebank claims that it uses the idea of "gaming for good," which combines game mechanics with environmental good, as they believe it can have a measurable impact on consumer behavior and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.recyclebank.com/corporate-info|title = Recyclebank|date = |accessdate = 2014-07-15|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gamification]] can be used by brands to motivate employees, create healthy competition among teams, generate buzz or social proof, and encourage customer loyalty, among other benefits.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

When Recyclebank was founded in 2004, gamification was not a well-known term, however elements of gamification, such as points and rewards,
have been embedded in Recyclebank from the start. These gaming elements make recycling easy for people to relate to, it provides motivation and it helps put behavior in context of the larger community. Though Recyclebank started by focusing on curbside recycling, there are now many more ways to earn points. Members can earn by pledging to do various things: unplugging appliances, choosing greener products, taking shorter showers, and making green travel decisions (like carpooling and taking public transportation), or by taking quizzes to learn more about how to recycle certain things, or even by simply reading a slideshow for tips or more information about new advances in sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://mashable.com/2012/03/27/recyclebank/|title = How One Startup Gamifies Recycling for a Greener World|last = Fox|first = Zoe|date = 2012-03-27|work = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Green Schools Program==
Each year, the Recyclebank Green Schools Program awards grants for unique environmental projects that positively affect students, schools and communities. Through the Green Schools Program, Recyclebank teaches children how to turn sustainable ideas into action and inspire them to make a real impact in their classrooms and communities. Recyclebank's partner Domtar Corporation, the sustainable paper company, helped make more green projects a reality by contributing additional donation dollars to participating schools. As part of its support for the Green Schools Program, in 2014 Domtar also planned to award a year's supply of Domtar EarthChoice® Office Paper to the school with the most innovative project.

Since 2007, the Recyclebank Green Schools Program has awarded close to $500,000 to more than 150 schools for projects designed to creatively improve their schools. Each year participating schools, their students and their communities work to encourage residents to donate Recyclebank points that the company then transfers into real dollars for schools—turning a community's green actions into funds for a local school. Because of this year's impressive submissions, Recyclebank is also funding up to 50 percent of each proposal that did not meet its goal.

In addition to providing a year's supply of paper to the C.W. Henry School, Domtar awarded $500 to each school that was able to reach 50 percent of its donation goal. More than half of the 29 participating schools reached 50 percent of their fundraising goals and will receive funds from Domtar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20140514-909745.html|title = Recyclebank Funds 29 Eco Projects with Green Schools Program|last = |first = |date = 2014-05-14|work = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the launch of the new online shop, One Twine, Recyclebank also announced that it will donate 5% of profits to the Green Schools Program.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==One Twine==
On Earth Day 2014 (April 22), Recyclebank launched One Twine, a new online shop to discover carefully vetted products that are better for your home, your wallet and the planet. In addition to discovering socially and environmentally conscious goods, customers will also find great deals on the products they love on OneTwine.com. To get even more value, Recyclebank members can apply the points they've earned for learning how to live more sustainably and taking actions toward purchases on One Twine.

Building on Recyclebank's expertise in sustainability, every item on One Twine has been evaluated through their Impact Lens, a list of nine criteria that consider the product's total environmental impact. To help people make more informed choices, One Twine clearly displays icons next to each product that highlight which criteria it meets, and includes insightful content related to those principles.

One Twine's Impact Lens considers the following criteria for each product:
*  '''Renewable''' – Made from recycled materials or renewable resources 
*  '''Gentle Impact''' – Ingredients and by-products are free of harsh chemicals that may be bad for health or the environment 
*  '''Fair''' – Makers of this product were treated fairly 
* ''' Sustainably Made''' – Manufacturer has worked to minimize environmental impact 
*  '''Efficient''' – Product more efficiently uses resources and/or helps reduce pollution 
*  '''Promotes Sustainability''' – This product makes it easier and more convenient to lead a more eco-friendly life 
*  '''Reclaimable''' – This product itself is recyclable, reusable and/or biodegradable 
*  '''Smart Packaging '''– Packaging materials are minimal and/or made from recyclable, reusable or biodegradable materials 
*  '''Merchant Buy Back''' – This product can be re-sold or given back to the manufacturer 
The name One Twine is a nod to the traditional corner store, the community hub where shopkeepers connected individuals with high-quality, all-natural goods. Purchases at this store were often bound by brown paper and twine—a single thread woven from many fibers. Recyclebank feels this image ties into the online shop’s theme because just like those durable, interwoven threads of twine, they believe that through making small actions and buying great products, people and the brand can be collectively bound for a better future.

At launch, One Twine featured more than 400 products from nearly 30 brands across household, health and beauty, children, pets, and gear and gadgets categories. Shoppers can find a mix of established brands as well as up-and-coming companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/business_models/sustainable_brands/recyclebank_launches_one_twine_-_marketplace_consc|title = Recyclebank Launches One Twine - A Marketplace for the Conscious Consumer|last = |first = |date = 2014-04-22|work = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One Twine now has 1,000 products on the site.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Revans University''', also known as '''The University of Action Learning''' ('''UAL'''), is the [[unaccredited institutions of higher education|unaccredited degree-awarding body]] for the UK-based International Management Centres Association (IMCA or IMC Association).&lt;ref name="tes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6003546 |date=October 10, 2008 |title=Cyber university's credibility in question |publisher=''Times Educational Supplement'' (London) |accessdate=February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revans University's registered address is in [[Port Vila]], [[Vanuatu]],&lt;ref name="tes"/&gt; though it has also been associated with [[Boulder, Colorado]].&lt;ref name="DETC" /&gt; It has no physical campus and all its activities take place online.&lt;ref name="tes"/&gt;  As of 2005, Revans University's partner organization IMCA was based in [[Buckingham]], UK.&lt;ref name="DETC" /&gt;

Revans University and ICMA are proponents of [[action learning]], pioneered by [[Reg Revans]].

Rather than requiring a traditional thesis, Revans University and IMCA award doctoral degrees on the basis of an "explication" – a short, 10,000 word document describing a candidate's professional experience and original contributions to knowledge.&lt;ref name="tes" /&gt;

==Accreditation==
Prior to 2005, Revans University and IMCA were accredited by the US [[Distance Education and Training Council|Distance Education and Training Council (DETC)]], but this accreditation was removed by DETC in 2005.&lt;ref name="tes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DETC"&gt;{{cite journal| journal=DETC News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612214226/http://detc.org/publications/DETCNews/DETC%20News%20-%20Spring%202005.pdf |url=http://www.detc.org/publications/DETCNews/DETC%20News%20-%20Spring%202005.pdf |deadurl=yes |title=Report from the Accrediting Commission |page=26 |archivedate=June 12, 2010 |accessdate=February 2, 2014 |location=Washington, DC |date=Spring 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Revans University nor IMCA is recognised as a UK degree-awarding body or course provider.&lt;ref name="tes"/&gt; 

According to ''The Times Educational Supplement'', British universities are not accepting qualifications accredited by Revans University;&lt;ref name="Milne1"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6003545|title=Teachers' wasted study on popular emotional literacy course|newspaper=Times Educational Supplement |location=London |date=October 10, 2008|accessdate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Milne2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6003528|date=October 12, 2008|accessdate=February 2, 2014|publisher=''Times Educational Supplement'' (London)|title=Emotional literacy course proves 'worthless'}}&lt;/ref&gt; this has led to complaints from former students.&lt;ref name="Milne1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milne2" /&gt;

Revolution Prep, based in [[Santa Monica, California]], began in 2002 after founders Ramit Varma and Jake Neuberg met at UCLA's Anderson School of Business. After years of teaching for Kaplan and The Princeton Review, Neuberg and Varma started a company to  improve upon traditional educational tools and creating new and innovative solutions to academic problems. They created their own SAT Reasoning Test* curriculum and a program that offers scholarships to students who otherwise could not afford their services.The firm's products and services now address a  range of academic areas, including ACT, GRE, high-stakes [[No Child Left Behind]] testing, and online education.

In   2010, the firm  worked with the Partnership for LA Schools to offer free SAT classes to students at the Santee Educational Complex in Los Angeles, and  was commended in an open letter by Los Angeles Mayor [[Antonio Villaraigosa]].&lt;ref name=partnership&gt;{{cite news|title= Santee Education Complex Seniors Gain Unprecedented 230-Point Hike on SAT Scores |publisher= Partnership for Los Angeles Schools |date= 2010-04-05 |url=http://www.partnershipla.org/news/?id=0058 |format= Online |accessdate= 2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mock SAT Test controversy==
In fall 2008, questions were raised by students at [[Lowell High School (San Francisco)]] over the mock tests used by Revolution Prep.&lt;ref name=mock1&gt;{{cite news|title= Revolution Prep's mock tests' integrity under fire (10/08) |publisher= The Lowell |date= Fall 2008 |url=http://thelowell.org/2008/10/20/revolution-preps-mock-tests-integrity-under-fire-1008/ |format= Online |accessdate= 2015-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claims were made that the difficulty of the first test was too high, resulting in artificial score increases. In May 2009, the story was covered by the [[Wall Street Journal]].&lt;ref name=mock2&gt;{{cite news|title= SAT Coaching Found to Boost Scores -- Barely |publisher= The Wall Street Journal |date= 2009-05-20 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124278685697537839.html |format= Online |accessdate= 2009-08-09 | first=John | last=Hechinger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revolution Prep disputed the claims, stating in the article that the results were "outliers."

'''Room to Read''' is a [[non-profit]] organization for improving [[literacy]] and [[gender equality]] in education in the [[developing world]]. Headquartered in [[San Francisco, California]], and founded on the belief that "World Change Starts With Educated Children," the organization focuses on working in collaboration with local communities, partner organizations and governments. Room to Read develops literacy skills and the habit of reading among primary school children, and supports girls in completing secondary school with the relevant [[life skills]] to succeed in school and beyond.&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.roomtoread.org/Page.aspx?pid=209|website=Official Website|publisher=Room to Read}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Room to Read is serving communities in ten countries in Asia and Africa: [[South Africa]], [[Zambia]], [[Tanzania]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Programs|url=http://www.roomtoread.org/Page.aspx?pid=433|website=Official Website|publisher=Room to Read}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[John Wood (Room to Read)|John Wood]], founder and board co-chair, launched Room to Read in 1999 after a trek through Nepal where he visited several local schools. He was amazed by the warmth and enthusiasm of the students and teachers, but saddened by the shocking lack of resources. Driven to help, John quit his senior executive position with [[Microsoft]] and built a global team to work with rural villages to build sustainable solutions to their education challenges.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://business.financialpost.com/executive/leadership/john-wood-i-had-to-get-out-of-microsoft-and-make-education-for-the-worlds-poorest-children-my-job|title=John Wood: 'I had to get out of Microsoft and make education for the world’s poorest children my job'|work=Financial Post|access-date=2017-03-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast

Beginning in Nepal, John and his Nepali Co-Founder, Dinesh Shrestha, started by working with rural communities to build schools (School Room) and establish libraries (Reading Room). John and Dinesh quickly recognized the need to expand the scope of work beyond libraries, and wanted to address the fact that many girls in the developing world are overlooked in the educational system due to cultural bias. To that end, in 2000, Room to Read began the Girls' Education program, which targets young girls and provides a long-term commitment to their education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2001, co-founder and CEO Erin Keown Ganju spearheaded Room to Read’s expansion into [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=John|title=Leaving Microsoft to Change the World|date=2006|publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York|isbn=9780061121074|pages=119–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Room to Read's operations have expanded to include Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Laos, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Zambia. In 2010, Room to Read celebrated its "Year of Tens," marking its ten-year anniversary with the opening of its 10,000th library in Nepal, along with the construction of its 1,000th school and support of its 10,000th girl through the Girls' Education Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scher|first1=Eddie|title=Financial Times Features Room To Read and ‘Year of Tens’|url=http://www.skollfoundation.org/financial-times-features-room-to-read-and-%E2%80%98year-of-tens%E2%80%99/|website=[[Skoll Foundation]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119121207/http://www.skollfoundation.org/financial-times-features-room-to-read-and-%E2%80%98year-of-tens%E2%80%99/|archivedate=19 November 2010|date=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rostock University of Music and Theatre''' (short '''HMT''', '''Hochschule für Musik und Theater Rostock''' in German) is a  [[College or university school of music|college of music]] in [[Rostock]], [[Mecklenburg]], [[Germany]]. It opened in 1994 and is situated in a former abbey called ''Katharinenkloster'' in the historical core of the city. The college is a member of the Association of Baltic Academies of Music. 

== History ==
In 1947, a University of Music, Theatre and Dance was inaugurated in Rostock under the direction of the composer [[Rudolf Wagner-Régeny]]. In 1978, it became a branch of the [[Hochschule für Musik "Hanns Eisler"|Hans Eisler University of Music]] in Berlin and was directed by Professor Karl-Heinz Will up until 1990.
After the political revolution of 1989, this branch was incorporated into the university as the department of musical science. 

The Drama College (Rostocker Schauspielschule) was founded in 1968 as the state drama school in Rostock, which in the 80s was turned into a branch of the [["Ernst Busch" Academy of Dramatic Art]] in Berlin. By the turn of 1990/91, the college became the Academy of Dramatic Art of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], a German federal state, and was temporarily continued as the drama department of the [[University of Rostock]]. 

The University of Music and Theatre in Rostock was legally established by the government of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania on January 1, 1994. The founding rector was Professor Wilfrid Jochims from the [[Hochschule für Musik Köln|University of Music in Cologne]]. Today, the Rostock University of Music and Theatre is a favourite choice among students throughout Europe. Since June 2004, Prof. Christfried Göckeritz has been the rector of the University. 

The first accommodation was in a former school at Bussebart and at the Ulmenstraße, which soon revealed to be very small for the increasing number of students. Since its move in 2001 into the beautifully restored Katharinenstift, made by architect Jons Reimann, the University of Music and Theatre has become a noticed venue for concerts, plays and events. Students and lecturers of the University stage over 300 performances every year for the Rostock public.

The actor, painter and writer [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]] is since 2009 part of the direction of this University.

'''STS ''Sedov''''' ({{lang-ru|Седов}}), formerly '''''Magdalene Vinnen II''''' (1921–1936) and '''''Kommodore Johnsen''''' (–1948), is a four-masted steel [[barque]] that for almost 80 years was the largest traditional [[sailing ship]] in operation. Originally built as a German cargo ship, ''Sedov'' is today a sail training vessel, training cadets from the universities of [[Murmansk]], [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Arkhangelsk]]. She participates regularly in the big maritime international events as a privileged host and has also been a regular participant in [[The Tall Ships' Races]].

==History ==
===''Magdalene Vinnen II''===
''Sedov'', originally named ''Magdalene Vinnen II'', was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] at [[Kiel]], Germany in 1921 by the [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft]] for the shipping company [[F. A. Vinnen &amp; Co.]] of [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]], one of the largest German shipping companies at the beginning of the 20th century. The shipping company initially objected to have an engine installed in the ship, but the ship yard (with backing from a Government committee) successfully argued for an engine, making the ship the first sailing ship with auxiliary engine designed to modern principles. 

''Magdalene Vinnen II'' was at the time the world’s largest auxiliary barque and exclusively used as a cargo ship with a crew that was partially made up of cadets. She sailed on her maiden voyage on 1 September 1921. Her voyage took her from Bremen via [[Cardiff]], where she took on coal, to [[Buenos Aires]]. Despite bad weather, the journey from England to Argentina with holds full of coal took just 30 days. ''Magdalene Vinnen II'' carried all sorts of cargo: apart from coal, she took timber from Finland, [[wheat]] from Australia, [[pyrite]] from Italy and unit load from Belgium. The four-masted barque made two voyages around [[Cape Horn]] to Chile. Until her last voyage as ''Magdalene Vinnen II'' in 1936, the ship sailed to Argentina, South Africa, Australia, [[Réunion|Reunion]] and the [[Seychelles]].

===''Kommodore Johnsen''===
On 9 August 1936, ''Magdalene Vinnen II'' was sold to [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] of Bremen and renamed ''Kommodore Johnsen''. The new owner modified her to a cargo-carrying training ship. More accommodation was provided, as the ship, apart from her permanent crew, was to have a complement of 50 to 60 trainee officers on each journey.

===''Sedov''===

She came under Russian state ownership after the surrender of Germany — on 20 December 1945, the British handed over the ship to the Soviet Union as war reparation. In the Soviet Union, she was converted into a sail training vessel of the [[Soviet Navy]]. Renamed ''Sedov'' after the Arctic explorer [[Georgy Sedov]] who died during an investigation in the [[Arctic]] in 1914, she was used as a training ship of the Navy from 1952 to 1957. She made several friendly visits to South America and Africa during this period. From 1957 to 1966 she was used as an [[oceanographic research ship]] in the [[North Atlantic]]. During these voyages, the Soviet Navy also used her for training of young cadets. In 1966 when she was transferred to the reserve in [[Kronstadt]], formally under the civil ownership of the Ministry of Fisheries. In the 1970s, she was only infrequently used as a training ship, sailing in the [[Gulf of Finland]].

In 1981, ''Sedov'' reappeared after renovation which had new features added such as a glass-domed banquet hall with a stage and a movie theater. She was now based at the Baltic Division of Training Ships in [[Riga]]. She embarked cadets from schools of navigation of [[Kaliningrad]] and Murmansk. After the [[On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia|declaration of independence]] of [[Latvia]] in 1991, she left Riga for Murmansk, transferred to the Murmansk naval school with the city of Murmansk ensuring her management and maintenance.

On 20 June 2013, ''Sedov'' was in collision with the [[caravel]] ''[[Lisa von Lübeck]]'' off [[Texel]], [[North Holland]], Netherlands. Both vessels put into [[Den Helder]].&lt;ref name=FM1646&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fleetmon.com/maritime-news/2013/1646/russian-training-tall-ship-sedov-allided-german-re/ |title=Russian training tall ship Sedov allided with German replica cog Lisa Von Luebeck |first=Mikhail |last=Voytenko |publisher=Fleetmon |date=21 June 2013 |accessdate=14 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, ''Sedov'' changed her home port to Kaliningrad and she is managed by the Kaliningrad State Technical University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tass.com/world/940520|title=World’s biggest sailing ship Sedov changes home port |website=Tass |date=10 April 2017 |accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sedov'' has regularly been targeted by unpaid creditors of the Russian Federation such as Nissim Gaon (of now defunct Swiss group NOGA, an anagram of Gaon) and also by French holders of defaulted Russian bonds; in 2002 ''Sedov'' was forced to precipitously and unexpectedly leave [[Marseilles]] in the dead of night&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/maritime/Scheepvaartnieuws/Pdf/scheepvaartnieuws/2002/september/036-24-09-2002.PDF  France, Russia in row over sailing ship] {{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid being served a writ by [[AFPER]] (French association of holders of Russian Empire bonds) the following morning.

For over a year French holders of defaulted Russian bonds were warning they were going to reorganize and export their claim to Anglo-Saxon jurisdictions, more friendly to private citizens than the French.

In May 2008, in the wake of British-Russian tension, ''Sedov'' was instructed by Moscow not to dock&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echo-news.co.uk/display.var.2237582.0.0.php Sedov not allowed to dock at pier Falmouth Echo, May 1, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502030822/http://www.echo-news.co.uk/display.var.2237582.0.0.php |date=May 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as planned at [[Southend-on-Sea]]. The September 2008 visit to [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]], the starting point of FUNCHAL 500 race to [[Madeira]], also seemed to be in jeopardy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://falmouthpacket.co.uk/mostpopular.var.2331243.mostcommented.russian_tall_ship_in_doubt_for_falmouth.php |title=Russian tall ship in doubt for Falmouth |work=the Packet |date=10 June 2008 |accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 ''Sedov'' celebrated her 90th anniversary. In 2012 ''Sedov'' started her first voyage around the world of more than 13 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rbth.ru/articles/2012/04/27/round-the-world_trip_to_mark_russias_anniversary_15419.html |title=Russia to launch round-the-world trip |work=Russia Beyond the Headlines |last=Darmaros |first=Marina |date=27 April 2012 |accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voyage ended on 20 July 2013 at [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://englishrussia.com/2013/07/22/sailing-ship-sedov-in-saint-petersburg/ |title=Sailing Ship Sedov in Saint Petersburg |website=English Russia |date=22 July 2013 |accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solidarity''' is unity  (as of a group or class) that produces or is based on unities of interests, objectives, standards, and sympathies.&lt;ref name="dict1"&gt;''Merriam Webster'', http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/solidarity.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/solidarity|title=solidarity|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the [[social relations|ties in a society]] that bind people together as one. The term is generally employed in [[sociology]] and the other [[social sciences]] as well as in [[philosophy]] or in [[Catholic social teaching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://apcz.umk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/CJFA/article/view/CJFA.2013.013|title=Social Security in Poland – cultural, historical and economical issues|first1=Stanisław|last1=Adamiak|first2=Ewa|last2=Chojnacka|first3=Damian|last3=Walczak|date=1 December 2013|publisher=|journal=Copernican Journal of Finance &amp; Accounting|volume=2|issue=2|pages=11–26|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=wydawnictwoumk.pl|doi=10.12775/cjfa.2013.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, solidarity is a core concept in [[Christian democracy]] political ideology.&lt;ref name="FitzpatrickKwon2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fitzpatrick |first1=Tony |last2=Kwon |first2=Huck-ju |last3= Manning |first3=Nick |author4=James Midgley, Gillian Pascall |title= International Encyclopedia of Social Policy |date= 4 July 2013 |publisher= Routledge |language=English |isbn= 978-1-136-61003-5|page=1866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What forms the basis of solidarity varies between societies. In simple societies it may be mainly based on [[kinship]] and shared values. In more complex societies there are various theories as to what contributes to a sense of social solidarity.&lt;ref name="dict1" /&gt;

Solidarity is also one of six principles of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union#The text|Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]], Title IV&lt;/ref&gt; and December 20 of each year is International Human Solidarity Day recognized as an [[international observance]].

== Émile Durkheim ==
According to [[Émile Durkheim]], the types of social solidarity correlate with types of society. Durkheim introduced the terms [[mechanical and organic solidarity|''mechanical'' and ''organic solidarity'']] as part of his theory of the development of societies in ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' (1893). In a society exhibiting mechanical solidarity, its cohesion and integration comes from the homogeneity of individuals—people feel connected through similar work, educational and religious training, and lifestyle. Mechanical solidarity normally operates in "traditional" and small scale societies.&lt;ref name="dict2"&gt;''Collins Dictionary of Sociology'', p405-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  In simpler societies (e.g., [[tribe|tribal]]), solidarity is usually based on [[kinship]] ties of familial networks. Organic solidarity comes from the interdependence that arises from specialization of work and the complementarities between people—a development which occurs in "modern" and "industrial" societies.&lt;ref name="dict2" /&gt;
* Definition: it is [[social cohesion]] based upon the dependence individuals have on each other in more advanced societies.

Although individuals perform different tasks and often have different values and interest, the order and very solidarity of society depends on their reliance on each other to perform their specified tasks. Organic here is referring to the interdependence of the component parts.  Thus social solidarity is maintained in more complex societies through the interdependence of its component parts (e.g., farmers produce the food to feed the factory workers who produce the tractors that allow the farmer to produce the food).

== Peter Kropotkin ==
A connection between the biological and the social was of principal importance for the idea of solidarity as expressed by the anarchist ideologist and former Prince [[Peter Kropotkin]] (1842–1921). In his most famous book, ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' (1902), written partly in response to Huxleyan Social Darwinism, Kropotkin studied the use of cooperation as a survival mechanism in human societies at their various stages, as well as with animals. According to him, [[mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]], or cooperation, within a species has been an important factor in the evolution of social institutions. Solidarity is essential for mutual aid; supportive activity towards other people does not result from the expectation of reward, but rather from instinctive feelings of solidarity.

In his introduction to the book, Kropotkin wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The number and importance of mutual-aid institutions which were developed by the creative genius of the savage and half-savage masses, during the earliest clan-period of mankind and still more during the next village-community period, and the immense influence which these early institutions have exercised upon the subsequent development of mankind, down to the present times, induced me to extend my researches to the later, historical periods as well; especially, to study that most interesting period&amp;nbsp;– the free medieval city republics, whose universality and influence upon our modern civilization have not yet been duly appreciated. And finally, I have tried to indicate in brief the immense importance which the mutual-support instincts, inherited by mankind from its extremely long evolution, play even now in our modern society, which is supposed to rest upon the principle "every one for himself, and the State for all," but which it never has succeeded, nor will succeed in realizing".&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, P. Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution.&amp;nbsp;– L.: Freedom press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Kropotkin advocated an alternative economic and social system, which would be coordinated through a horizontal network of voluntary associations with goods distributed in compliance with the physical needs of the individual, rather than according to labour.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in philosophy ==
Solidarity is an emerging concept in contemporary philosophy&amp;nbsp;– it is subject to ongoing studies in various subfields of [[ethics]] and [[political philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |editor=Bayertz, Kurt |year=1999 |title=Solidarity |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |publication-place=Dordrecht |isbn=978-0-7923-5475-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable approach in [[bioethics]] is to identify solidarity primarily as a three-tiered practice enacted at the interpersonal, communal, and contractual and legal levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Prainsack, Barbara |author2=Buyx, Alena |year=2012 |title=Solidarity in Contemporary Bioethics&amp;nbsp;– Towards a New Approach |journal=Bioethics |issue=26/7 |pages=343–350 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.2012.01987.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is driven by the quest to differentiate between the diverse applications of the concept and to clarify its meaning, both historically and in terms of its potential as a fruitful concept for contemporary moral, social and political issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Prainsack, Barbara |author2=Buyx, Alena |year=2011 |title=Solidarity: reflections on an emerging concept in bioethics |publisher=Nuffield Council on Bioethics |publication-place=London |url=http://nuffieldbioethics.org/project/solidarity/ |accessdate= 2013-11-04 |isbn= 978-1-904384-25-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catholic social teaching ==
Solidarity is an integral element of [[Catholic social teaching]]. According to [[Pope Francis]]:
{{blockquote|No one can remain insensitive to the inequalities that persist in the world ... the Brazilian people, particularly the humblest among you, can offer the world a valuable lesson in solidarity, a word that is too often forgotten or silenced because it is uncomfortable ... I would like to make an appeal to those in possession of greater resources, to public authorities and to all people of good will who are working for social justice: never tire of working for a more just world, marked by greater solidarity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicsocialteaching.org.uk/themes/solidarity/|title=Solidarity|author=|date=|website=catholicsocialteaching.org.uk|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Church's teaching on solidarity is explained in the [[Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church]], and briefly summarised in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]:
{{blockquote|

* 1939. The principle of solidarity, also articulated in terms of "friendship" or "social charity," is a direct demand of human and Christian brotherhood 

* 1940. Solidarity is manifested in the first place by the distribution of goods and remuneration for work ...

* 1941. Socio-economic problems can be resolved only with the help of all the forms of solidarity: solidarity of the poor among themselves, between rich and poor, of workers among themselves, between employers and employees in a business, solidarity among nations and peoples. International solidarity is a requirement of the moral order; world peace depends in part upon this

* 1942. The virtue of solidarity goes beyond material goods. In spreading the spiritual goods of the faith, the Church has promoted, and often opened new paths for, the development of temporal goods as well. And so throughout the centuries has the Lord's saying been verified: "Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well."

'''Sophia Magdalena Scholl''' (9 May 1921 – 22 February 1943) was a German student and anti-Nazi political activist, active within the [[White Rose]] [[Nonviolence|non-violent]] [[Widerstand|resistance]] group in [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="Scholl 1983"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Scholl | first1 = Inge | authorlink = Inge Scholl | year = 1983 | title = The White Rose: Munich, 1942–1943 | page = 114 | publisher = Wesleyan University Press | location = Middletown, CT | others = Schultz, Arthur R.

She was convicted of high [[treason]] after having been found distributing anti-war leaflets at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]] (LMU) with her brother, [[Hans Scholl|Hans]]. As a result, she was [[Capital punishment|executed]] by [[guillotine]]. Since the 1970s, Scholl has been extensively commemorated for her anti-Nazi resistance work.

== Early life ==

Scholl was the daughter of Magdalena (Müller) and liberal politician and ardent Nazi critic [[Robert Scholl]], who was the [[Bürgermeister|mayor]] of her hometown of [[Forchtenberg am Kocher]] in the [[Free People's State of Württemberg]], when Scholl was born. She was the fourth of six children:

Scholl was brought up in the [[Lutheran]] church. She entered junior or grade school at the age of seven, learned easily, and had a carefree childhood. In 1930, the family moved to [[Ludwigsburg]] and then two years later to [[Ulm]] where her father had a business consulting office.

In 1932, Scholl started attending a secondary school for girls. At the age of twelve, she chose to join the ''[[Bund Deutscher Mädel]]'' (League of German Girls), as did most of her classmates. Her initial enthusiasm gradually gave way to criticism. She was aware of the dissenting political views of her father, friends, and some teachers. Even her own brother Hans, who once eagerly participated in the [[Hitler Youth]] program, became entirely disillusioned with the [[Nazi Party]].&lt;ref name="Atwood 2011 16"&gt;{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|year=2011|ISBN=9781556529610|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political attitude had become an essential criterion in her choice of friends. The arrest of her brothers and friends in 1937 for participating in the [[German Youth Movement]] left a strong impression on her.

She had a talent for drawing and painting and for the first time, came into contact with a few so-called "[[degenerate art|degenerate]]" artists. An avid reader, she developed a growing interest in [[philosophy]] and [[theology]].

In spring 1940, she graduated from secondary school, where the subject of her essay was "The Hand that Moved the Cradle, Moved the World." Scholl nearly did not graduate, having lost any desire to participate in the classes which had largely become Nazi indoctrination.&lt;ref name="Atwood 2011 16"/&gt; Being fond of children, she became a [[kindergarten]] teacher at the [[Friedrich Fröbel|Fröbel]] Institute in [[Ulm]]. She also had chosen this kindergarten job hoping that it would be recognized as an alternative service to ''[[Reichsarbeitsdienst]]'' (National Labor Service), a prerequisite to be admitted to the university. This was not the case, though, and in spring 1941 she began a six-month stint in the auxiliary war service as a nursery teacher in [[Blumberg]]. The military-like regimen of the Labor Service caused her to think very hard about the political situation and to begin practicing [[passive resistance]].

After her six months in the [[National Labor Service]], in May 1942, she enrolled at the [[University of Munich]] as a student of [[biology]] and philosophy.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Her brother Hans, who was studying medicine there, introduced her to his friends. Although this group of friends eventually was known for their [[politics|political]] views, they initially were drawn together by a shared love of art, music, literature, philosophy, and theology. [[Hiking]] in the mountains, [[skiing]] and [[human swimming|swimming]] were also of importance to them. They often attended concerts, plays, and lectures together.

In Munich, Scholl met a number of artists, writers, and philosophers, particularly [[Carl Muth]] and [[Theodor Haecker]], who were important contacts for her. The question they pondered the most was how the individual must act under a dictatorship. During the summer vacation in 1942, Scholl had to do war service in a metallurgical plant in Ulm. At the same time, her father was serving time in prison for having made a critical remark to an employee about [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]].

== Origins of the White Rose ==

{{main|White Rose}}

Based upon letters between Scholl and her boyfriend, Fritz Hartnagel (reported and analyzed by Gunter Biemer and Jakob Knab in the journal ''Newman Studien''), she had given two volumes of Cardinal [[John Henry Newman]]'s sermons to Hartnagel when he was deployed to the eastern front in May 1942. This discovery by Jakob Knab shows the importance of religion in Scholl's life and was highlighted in an article in the ''Catholic Herald'' in the UK. Scholl learned of the White Rose pamphlet when she found one at her university. Realizing her brother helped write the pamphlet, Scholl herself began to work on the White Rose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|year=2011|ISBN=9781556529610|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group of authors had been horrified by Hartnagel's reports of [[German war crimes]] on the Eastern Front where Hartnagel witnessed Soviet POWs being shot in a [[mass grave]] and learned of mass killings of Jews. Her correspondence with Hartnagel deeply discussed the "theology of conscience" developed in Newman's writings. This is seen as her primary defense in her transcribed interrogations leading to her "trial" and execution. Those transcripts became the basis for a 2005 film treatment, ''[[Sophie Scholl – The Final Days]]''.

With six core members, three more White Rose pamphlets were created and circulated over the summer of 1942.&lt;ref name="Atwood 2011 17"&gt;{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|year=2011|ISBN=9781556529610|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities of the White Rose ==

{{main|White Rose}}

The core members initially included Hans Scholl (Sophie's brother), [[Willi Graf]], [[Christoph Probst]] and [[Alexander Schmorell]] (Schmorell was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church in 2012.) Initially, her brother had been keen to keep her unaware of their activities, but once she discovered them, she joined him and proved valuable to the group because, as a woman, her chances of being randomly stopped by the [[SS]] were much smaller. Calling themselves the White Rose, they instructed Germans to passively resist the Nazi government. The pamphlet used both Biblical and philosophical support for an intellectual argument of resistance.&lt;ref name="Atwood 2011 17"/&gt; In addition to authorship and protection, Scholl helped copy, distribute, and mail pamphlets while also managing the group's finances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|year=2011|ISBN=9781556529610|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She and the rest of the White Rose were arrested for distributing the sixth leaflet at the [[University of Munich]] on 18 February 1943. In the [[People's Court (Germany)|People's Court]] before Judge [[Roland Freisler]] on 22 February 1943, Scholl was recorded as saying these words:

{{quote| Somebody, after all, had to make a start. What we wrote and said is also believed by many others. They just don't dare express themselves as we did.&lt;ref name="GERschollS"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Spartacus Educational |url=http://spartacus-educational.com/GERschollS.htm |first= John |last=Simkin |title=Sophie Scholl |date=January 2016 |accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There was no testimony allowed for the defendants; this was their only defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|year=2011|ISBN=9781556529610|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grab Sophie und Hans Scholl Christoph Probst-1.jpg|thumb|Grave of [[Hans Scholl]], Sophie Scholl, and [[Christoph Probst]], in the Perlacher Friedhof, next to the Stadelheim prison in [[Munich]]]]

On 22 February 1943, Scholl, [[Hans Scholl|her brother, Hans]], and their friend, [[Christoph Probst]], were found guilty of treason and condemned to death. They were all beheaded by a guillotine by executioner [[Johann Reichhart]] in Munich's [[Stadelheim Prison]] only a few hours later, at 17:00 hrs. The execution was supervised by Walter Roemer, the enforcement chief of the Munich district court. Prison officials, in later describing the scene, emphasized the courage with which she walked to her execution. Her last words were:

{{quote| How can we expect righteousness to prevail when there is hardly anyone willing to give himself up individually to a righteous cause? Such a fine, sunny day, and I have to go, but what does my death matter, if through us, thousands of people are awakened and stirred to action?&lt;ref name="GERschollS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burns"&gt;{{cite web | last = Burns | first = Margie | date = | title = Sophie Scholl and the White Rose | publisher = The [[International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation]] | url = http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/holocaust/articles-20/sophie-scholl-white-rose/ | accessdate = 21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fritz Hartnagel was evacuated from [[Stalingrad]] in January 1943, but did not return to Germany before Sophie was executed. In October 1945, he married Sophie's sister Elisabeth.&lt;ref name="zeit"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
Following her death, a copy of the sixth leaflet was smuggled out of Germany through Scandinavia to the UK by German jurist [[Helmuth James Graf von Moltke]], where it was used by the Allied Forces. In mid-1943, they dropped over Germany millions of [[propaganda]] copies of the tract, now retitled ''The Manifesto of the Students of Munich''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|year=2011|ISBN=9781556529610|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a historical context, the White Rose's legacy has significance for many commentators, both as a demonstration of exemplary spiritual courage, and as a well-documented case of social [[dissent]] in a society of violent repression, censorship, and [[Conformity|conformist]] pressure.

Playwright [[Lillian Garrett-Groag]] stated in ''Newsday'' on 22 February 1993, that "It is possibly the most spectacular moment of resistance that I can think of in the twentieth century&amp;nbsp;... The fact that five little kids, in the mouth of the wolf, where it really counted, had the tremendous courage to do what they did, is spectacular to me. I know that the world is better for them having been there, but I do not know why."&lt;ref name="Keeler 1993"&gt;{{cite news|last=Keeler|first=Bob|last2=Ewich|first2=Heidi|date=22 February 1993|newspaper=[[Newsday]]|page=13|title=Anti-Nazi Movement Still Inspires Germans recall rare courage of `White Rose'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same issue of ''Newsday'', [[Holocaust]] historian [[Jud Newborn]] noted that "You cannot really measure the effect of this kind of resistance in whether or not X number of bridges were blown up or a regime fell&amp;nbsp;... The White Rose really has a more symbolic value, but that's a very important value."&lt;ref name="Keeler 1993" /&gt;

Else Gebel shared Sophie Scholl's cell and recorded her last words before being taken away to be executed. "It is such a splendid sunny day, and I have to go. But how many have to die on the battlefield in these days, how many young, promising lives. What does my death matter if by our acts thousands are warned and alerted. Among the student body there will certainly be a revolt."&lt;ref name="GERschollS"/&gt;

=== Honors ===

[[File:Sophie scholl bust.JPG|thumb|Bust of Sophie Scholl]]

On 22 February 2003, a bust of Scholl was placed by the government of [[Bavaria]] in the [[Walhalla temple]] in her honor.

The Geschwister-Scholl-Institut ("Scholl Siblings Institute") for Political Science at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] (LMU) is named in honour of Sophie Scholl and her brother Hans. The institute is home to the university's political science and communication departments, and is housed in the former [[Radio Free Europe]] building close to the city's [[Englischer Garten]].

Many local schools as well as countless streets and squares in Germany have been named after Scholl and her brother.

In 2003, Germans were invited by television broadcaster [[ZDF]] to participate in ''[[Unsere Besten]]'' (Our Best), a nationwide competition to choose the top ten most important Germans of all time. Voters under the age of forty helped Scholl and her brother Hans to finish in fourth place, above [[Bach]], [[Goethe]], [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]], [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], [[Willy Brandt]], and [[Albert Einstein]]. If the votes of young viewers alone had been counted, Sophie and Hans Scholl would have been ranked first. Several years earlier, readers of ''[[Brigitte (magazine)|Brigitte]]'', a German magazine for women, voted Scholl "the greatest woman of the twentieth century".

On May 9, 2014, [[Google]] depicted Scholl for its [[Google Doodle]] on the occasion of what would have been her 93rd birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sophie Scholl's 93rd Birthday|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/sophie-scholls-93rd-birthday|website=www.google.com|publisher=Google|accessdate=22 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
==== In film ====
In the 1970s and 1980s, there were three film accounts of Sophie Scholl and the White Rose resistance. The first film was financed by the Bavarian state government and released in the 1970s, entitled ''Das Versprechen'' (''The Promise''). In 1982, [[Percy Adlon]]'s ''Fünf letzte Tage'' (''Five Last Days'') presented [[Lena Stolze]] as Scholl in her last days from the point of view of her cellmate Else Gebel. In the same year, Stolze repeated the role in [[Michael Verhoeven]]'s ''[[Die Weiße Rose (film)|Die Weiße Rose]]'' (''The White Rose''). In an interview, Stolze said that playing the role was "an honour".&lt;ref name="brigitte.de"&gt;{{cite interview |last1=Jentsch |first1=Julia |last2=Stolze |first2=Lena |date=March 2005 |language=German |title="Es war uns eine Ehre, Sophie Scholl zu sein" |trans-title="It was an honour for me to be Sophie Scholl" |publisher=[[Brigitte (magazine)|Brigitte]] | url = http://www.brigitte.de/kultur/kino-tv/scholl-534141/ |accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005, a movie about Scholl's last days, ''[[Sophie Scholl – The Final Days|Sophie Scholl – Die letzten Tage]] (Sophie Scholl – The Final Days)'', featuring actress [[Julia Jentsch]] in the title role, was released. Drawing on interviews with survivors and transcripts that had remained hidden in East German archives until 1990, it was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] in January 2006. For her portrayal of Scholl, Jentsch won the best actress at the [[European Film Awards]], best actress at the [[German Film Awards]] (Lolas), along with the [[Silver Bear]] for best actress at the [[Berlin Film Festival]].

In 2018, Scholl is featured in Dinesh D'Souza's Film ''Death of a Nation''. Her bravery and heroism is shown, as well as her interrogation and execution. She is portrayed by Victoria Chilap. 

==== In literature ====
[[Jud Newborn]] and Annette Dumbach's 1986 book about the White Rose, ''Shattering the German Night'' (Little, Brown) was reissued in an expanded, updated, and illustrated edition in 2006, ''[[Sophie Scholl and the White Rose]]'', to accompany the new film's release and provide an account of the history behind the White Rose.

In February 2009, [[The History Press]] released ''Sophie Scholl: The Real Story of the Woman who Defied Hitler'' by Frank McDonough.&lt;ref name="McDonough 2009"&gt;{{cite book | last = McDonough | first = Frank | year = 2009 | title = Sophie Scholl: The Real Story of the Woman who Defied Hitler | publisher = [[The History Press]] |isbn=9780752446752}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THE"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Times Higher Education]]|date=9 April 2009|page=50|title=Sophie Scholl: The Real Story of the Woman who Defied Hitler|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/sophie-scholl-the-real-story-of-the-woman-who-defied-hitler/406082.article|accessdate=21 March 2016|last=Evans|first=Richard J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, [[Carl Hanser Verlag]] released ''Sophie Scholl: A Biography'' (in German), by Barbara Beuys.&lt;ref name="Beuys 2010"&gt;{{cite book | publisher = [[Carl Hanser Verlag]] | date = | title = Sophie Scholl Biographie | last = Beuys | first = Barbara |url=http://www.hanser-literaturverlage.de/buch/sophie-scholl-biographie/978-3-446-23505-2/ |accessdate=21 March 2016 |isbn=978-3-446-23505-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In theatre ====
American playwright Lillian Garrett-Groag's play ''[[The White Rose (play)|The White Rose]]'' features Scholl as a major character.

''We Will Not Be Silent'', a dramatization by [[David Meyers (writer)|David Meyers]] of Scholl's imprisonment and interrogation, premiered at the [[Contemporary American Theater Festival]] in [[Shepherdstown, West Virginia]] in July, 2017.&lt;ref name="american-theatre"&gt;{{cite web|title=Contemporary American Theater Festival Announces 2017 Summer Season|url=http://www.americantheatre.org/2017/03/10/contemporary-american-theater-festival-announces-2017-summer-season/|website=American Theatre|publisher=Theatre Communications Group|accessdate=29 July 2017|date=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washington-post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marks|first1=Peter|title=A theater festival in the bucolic countryside, but boiling underneath|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater_dance/a-theater-festival-in-the-bucolic-countryside-but-boiling-underneath/2017/07/11/e3683c0c-6581-11e7-83d7-7a628c56bde7_story.html|accessdate=29 July 2017|work=Washington Post|date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frederick-news-post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGuire|first1=Colin|title=CATF: 'We Will Not Be Silent'|url=https://www.fredericknewspost.com/news/arts_and_entertainment/catf-we-will-not-be-silent/article_b6d50bfe-95a8-5cb1-89d6-160858a3c413.html|accessdate=29 July 2017|work=The Frederick News-Post|date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Naked Scientists''''' is a one-hour audience-interactive [[science]] radio talk show broadcast live by the [[BBC]] in the [[East of England]], nationally by BBC Radio 5 Live and internationally on [[Radio National|ABC Radio National, Australia]]; it is also distributed globally as a [[podcast]].

The programme was created and is edited by [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] consultant virologist [[Chris Smith (doctor)|Dr Chris Smith]]. The present ''Naked Scientists'' line up also includes science broadcaster and harpist Kat Arney and producers Georgia Mills, Adam Murphy, Katie Haylor and Izzie Clarke, with [[Peter Cowley]] adding a technology perspective

In 2009 the group appointed the first official ''Naked Scientists'' PhD student, Diana O'Carroll, to examine the educational impacts of science broadcasting and new media. O'Carroll also set up a 
''Naked Scientists'' spin-off podcast, ''Naked Archaeology'', which launched in 2008. A second spin-off, ''Naked Astronomy'', featuring Cambridge University-based space scientists and astronomers, has been podcast since December 2009. Naked Astronomy also hosts the Space Boffins podcast, produced by journalists Richard Hollingham and Sue Nelson. A combined video and audio programme, ''Naked Engineering'', produced by Dave Ansell and Meera Senthilingam and supported by the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]], launched in September 2010. For Christmas 2010 the group also showcased a new video podcast strand, the ''Naked Science Scrapbook''. In 2012, a Naked Neuroscience strand was unveiled, and in 2013 the Material Chef video series, showcasing materials science, was launched.

==''Naked Scientists'' show content==
Each episode of the main ''Naked Scientists'' programme is one hour long and includes a digest of topical science news stories, audience questions answered live on the air and interviews with guest scientists. These individuals join the hosts in the studio to talk about their work and to take questions live from listeners. Previous featured guests include the discoverer of the DNA fingerprint,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/html/shows/2005.12.04.htm |title=Forensics, DNA Fingerprinting and Human Origins |publisher=The Naked Scientists |date=2005-12-04 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alec Jeffreys]], the  [[Astronomer Royal]]  Sir [[Martin Rees]], and the co-discoverer of [[DNA]] structure, [[James D. Watson]].

The show also features on-location reports and interviews, and an ad-hoc interactive segment called ''Kitchen Science'' where listeners are encouraged to attempt a science experiment at home during the show. Kitchen Science experiments have included building a desktop [[trebuchet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/the-trebuchet/ |title=The Trebuchet |publisher=The Naked Scientists |date=2008-11-16 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[chocolate]] [[teapot]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/how-useless-is-a-chocolate-teapot/ |title=How useless is a Chocolate Teapot? |publisher=The Naked Scientists |date=2008-08-31 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Liver]] powered [[Bottle Rocket]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/fizzes-from-peroxide/ |title=Fizzes from peroxide |publisher=The Naked Scientists |date=2008-09-21 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kitchen Science segment also hosts experiments that listeners may not be able to do at home, such as generating [[X-rays]] from Sticky Tape &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/glowing-tape/ |title=Glowing tape |publisher=The Naked Scientists |date=2008-11-30 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Dr Carlos Camara of [[UCLA]] and testing how much fat would stop a bullet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/how-fat-would-you-have-to-be-to-stop-a-bullet/ |title=How fat would you have to be to stop a bullet? |publisher=The Naked Scientists |date=2007-06-17 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; with researchers at [[Cambridge University]]'s [[Cavendish Laboratory]].

==Awards and prizes==
''The Naked Scientists'' have won eight national and international awards for science communication since 2006. The show won the [[Biosciences Federation]] Prize for Science Communication, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsf.ac.uk/Media/award/sci_comm2006.htm Biosciences Federation Science Communication Award 2006] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113175023/http://www.bsf.ac.uk/Media/award/sci_comm2006.htm |date=2008-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Joshua Phillips Award for Innovation in Science Engagement in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manchestersciencefestival.com/news/article.aspx?ID=232 |title=And the winner is... |publisher=[[Manchester Science Festival]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218231113/http://www.manchestersciencefestival.com/news/article.aspx?ID=232 |archivedate=2009-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Society for General Microbiology]]'s Peter Wildy Prize 2008, the [[Royal Society]] [[Kohn Award]] for 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://royalsociety.org/awards/kohn-award/ |title=Royal Society Kohn Award |publisher=[[Royal Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Best Radio Show Award at the Population Institute's 29th Global Media Awards, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.populationinstitute.org/newsroom/press-release/?id=89 |title=29th Annual Global Media Award Winners Announced |publisher=The Population Institute |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224102213/http://www.populationinstitute.org/newsroom/press-release/?id=89 |archivedate=2009-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Podcast Award]] for UK Non-Profit podcast,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.european-podcast-award.eu/european-podcast-award-0809-winners-announced-44 |title=European Podcast Award 08/09 Winners announced |date=2009-04-01 |publisher=European Podcast Award |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; the inaugural Royal College of Pathologists Furness Prize for science communication 2010 and the Society of Biology Science Communication Prize 2012.

''The Naked Scientists'' was also in the five finalists in the 2006 World Podcast Awards and received two nominations, for "best produced" and "best science and technology podcast" in the 2007 awards. It was also a top five finalist in the 2008 and 2009 awards.

Bandwidth consumed by the programme's podcast exceeds 28TB (terabytes) of downloads per month and more than 40 million copies have been downloaded since 2007.

==Other media==
The Naked Scientists appeared on [[Five (TV channel)|TV Channel Five's]] [[panel game]] ''[[The What in the World? Quiz]]'' and have contributed to the 2007 [[Channel 4]] programme "The Farm Revealed". In September 2008, with the [[Open University]], the Naked Scientists launched a new UK national radio edition of their programme, ''The Naked Scientists - Up All Night'' (subsequently renamed "Breaking Science") which was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] for 12 months before finishing in 2009.

In November 2008, with the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]], a series entitled ''The Naked Scientists In Africa'' began on [[Channel Africa]], the [[international broadcasting]] service of the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]].   ''The Naked Scientists in Africa'' was produced by Naked Scientist team-member Meera Senthilingam, incorporating international science news and a focus on science stories originating in, or pertinent to, African countries. This project ran until 2010.

==Scheduling changes==
In August 2012, BBC East announced an impending change to the Sunday schedule, which would see the show discontinued. In response to public reaction, the head of BBC East, Mick Rawsthorne, was interviewed on national radio about the decision to end the programme. Rawsthorne explained that the ''Naked Scientists'' did not fit the station's core purpose of providing "local radio".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Curry |first=Stephen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2012/nov/20/1 |title=Radio Ga Ga: BBC axes popular science radio show|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2012-11-20 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01nq3lx |title=BBC Radio 4 - Feedback, 09/11/2012 |publisher=[[BBC Radio 4]] |date=2012-11-11 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rawsthorne did acknowledge the quality of the ''Naked Scientists'' programming and recognised that, with Cambridge University at the heart of Cambridgeshire, special consideration should be made for science in Cambridgeshire. Consequently, the BBC reconsidered their decision to terminate the programme and developed a proposal for it to continue as well as a way for enhanced scientific coverage and content to be integrated within the other mainstream mid-week outputs of [[BBC Cambridgeshire]], significantly increasing the reach of the programme and the representation of science within the outputs of BBC Radio Cambridgeshire.

From January 2013, a new initiative involving the Naked Scientists began on BBC Radio Norfolk. A dedicated hour of science Q and A was included within the station's Tea Time output (hosted by Matthew Gudgin) on alternate Wednesday evenings from 1800-1900. Listeners call, text, tweet or email with questions on any scientific subject and the team answer them.

==ABC Radio National, Australia==
From January 2013, the ''Naked Scientists'' programme also began to air across Australia on [[ABC Radio National]], initially on a Sunday morning. From January 2014 the first airing of the programme was moved to a Friday evening 10pm slot, repeated on Sundays at 1500. This show is also released as the Naked Scientists Podcast.

==BBC Radio 5 live Science==
Launched in May 2014, ''5 live Science'' is a new weekly one-hour programme from the Naked Scientists aired by [[BBC Radio 5 Live|BBC 5 live]]. Under the banner ''5 live Science'' it's a newly formatted version of the show produced by the Naked Scientists team and fronted by [[Chris Smith, The Naked Scientist|Dr Chris Smith]]; it airs nationally every Sunday morning. The programme is also released as a podcast under the same name. 

==Internship Programme==
The Naked Scientists regularly host paid internships including positions supported in the past by Cambridge University, the Royal Academy of Engineering, MRC (Medical Research Council), STFC (Science and Technology Facilities Council), the UK's Genetics Society and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). The present programme targets science PhD students. Applicants are "bought out" from their research projects for two months to join the Naked Scientists team where they learn to participate in the programme-making process, including presenting, writing and publishing skills. In 2017 the Naked Scientists hosted their first international trainee when University of Western Australia PhD student Michael Wheeler joined the team, and in 2018 Virginia Tech students Marika Ottman and Vy Nguyen received support from Rolls-Royce to pursue a placement with the Naked Scientists.

==Funders and supporters==
The Naked Scientists have received funding and awards from the [[Wellcome Trust]], the [[Natural Environment Research Council]], the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] (EPSRC), Cambridge University including the Isaac Newton Trust, the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] (STFC), the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]], the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] and [[Rolls-Royce Holdings|Rolls-Royce]].

[[File:WATSONVILLE HIGH SCHOOL.JPG|thumb|alt=Watsonville High School.|Watsonville High School on East Beach Street.]]
'''Watsonville High School''' is a [[high school]] located in [[Watsonville, California]] in [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz County]], and is part of the [[Pajaro Valley Unified School District]]. This is an open campus school, thus students are able to leave and come back after lunch. However, this has been a problem for many years; too many students skip class and end up either not graduating or having to move to other schools because of their cuts. The school mascot is Willy the Wildcat. The school colors are black and gold. Their most recent rival (in sports) is Pajaro Valley High School, which is also located in Watsonville. Watsonville High's long-time rival is Aptos High School; football games between the two schools is known as the "Black and Blue Bowl." Watsonville High School is a large school with over 2,000 students and staff, making it the largest school in the Pajaro Valley Unified School district.

The '''Western canon''' is the body of [[Western literature]], [[European classical music]], philosophy, and [[works of art]] that represents the [[high culture]] of Europe and North America: "a certain Western intellectual tradition that goes from, say, [[Socrates]] to [[Wittgenstein]] in philosophy, and from [[Homer]] to [[James Joyce]] in literature".&lt;ref name="Searle"/&gt;  The word [[wikt:canon|canon]] is derived from ancient Greek ''κανών, kanṓn'', meaning a measuring rod, or standard. The [[Bible]], a product of [[ancient Jewish]] culture, from western Asia, has been a major force in shaping [[Western culture]], and "has inspired some of the great monuments of human thought, literature, and art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Bible: A Very Short Introduction|edition= |last= Riches|first= John|year= 2000|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-285343-1|page= 134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The canon of books has been fairly stable, although it has expanded to include more women and [[racial minorities]], while the canons of music and the visual arts have greatly expanded to cover the [[Middle Ages]] and subsequent centuries once largely overlooked. But some examples of newer media such as [[Film|cinema]] have attained a precarious position in the canon. Also during the twentieth century there has been a growing interest in the West as well as globally, in major works, both in literature and in the other arts, of the cultures of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and South America and the former colonies of European countries.

There has been an ongoing debate internationally, over the nature and status of the canon since at least the 1960s, much of which is rooted in [[critical theory]], [[feminism]], [[critical race theory]], and [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name="Hicks 2004 p. 18"&gt;[[Stephen Hicks|Hicks, Stephen]]. (2004). ''Explaining Postmodernism: Skepticism and Socialism from Rousseau to Foucault''. Scholargy Press, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[postmodern]] studies have argued that the body of scholarship is [[bias]]ed because the traditional main focus of academic studies of [[Western culture]] and history has only been on works produced by Western [[Patriarchy|men]].

==A classic==
[[Image:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|100ox|thumb|In painting, the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], c. 1503–1506, is the archetypal masterpiece, though it was not produced for admission to a guild or academy.]]
A [[classic]] is a book, or any other work of art, accepted as being exemplary or noteworthy, for example through an [[imprimatur]] such as being listed in a list of [[great books]], or through a reader's personal opinion. Although the term is often associated with the Western canon, it can be applied to works of literature, music and art, etc. from all traditions, such as the [[Chinese classics]] or the [[Veda]]s. A related word is [[masterpiece]] or ''chef d'œuvre'', which in modern use refers to a creation that has been given much critical praise, especially one that is considered the greatest work of a person's career or to a work of outstanding creativity, skill, or workmanship. Historically, the word refers to a work of a very high standard produced in order to obtain membership of a [[Guild]] or [[Academy]].

The first writer to use the term "classic" was [[Aulus Gellius]], a 2nd-century [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writer who, in the [[miscellany]] ''Noctes Atticae'' (19, 8, 15), refers to a writer as a ''classicus scriptor, non proletarius'' ("A distinguished, not a commonplace writer"). Such classification began with the Greeks' ''ranking'' their cultural works, with the word ''[[wikt:canon|canon]]'' (ancient Greek κανών, kanṓn: "measuring rod, standard"). Moreover, early [[Christianity|Christian]] Church Fathers used ''canon'' to rank the authoritative texts of the [[New Testament]], preserving them, given the expense of [[vellum]] and [[papyrus]] and mechanical book reproduction, thus, being comprehended in a ''canon'' ensured a book's preservation as the best way to retain information about a civilization.&lt;ref name="Gellius"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gellius |first1=Aulus |title=Auli Gellii Noctes Atticae: ex editione Jacobi Gronovii, cum notis et interpretatione in usum Delphini, variis lectionibus, notis variorum, recensu editionum et codicum, et indice locupletissimo, accurate recensitae |date=1824 |publisher=curante et imprimente A.J.

In the ancient world, at the [[Alexandrian Library]], scholars coined the Greek term ''Hoi enkrithentes'' ("the admitted", "the included") to identify the writers in the canon.

{{main article|Classic book|Great books}}
With regard to books, what makes a book "classic" has concerned various authors, from [[Mark Twain]] to [[Italo Calvino]], and questions such as "Why Read the Classics?", and "What Is a Classic?" have been considered by others, including Calvino, [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]], [[Michael Dirda]], and [[Ezra Pound]].

The terms "classic book" and Western canon are closely related concepts, but are not necessarily synonymous. A "canon" is a list of books considered to be "essential", and it can be published as a collection (such as [[Great Books of the Western World]], [[Modern Library]], [[Everyman's Library]], or [[Penguin Classics]]), presented as a list with an academic's imprimatur (such as [[Harold Bloom]]'s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bloom, Harold|title= The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|location= New York|publisher= Harcourt Brace &amp; Company|date= 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or be the official reading list of a university.

Some of the writers who are generally considered the most important in [[Western literature]] are [[Homer]], [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], [[Euripides]], [[Aristophanes]], [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], [[Ovid]],  [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[Dante Alighieri]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[François Rabelais]], [[Jean Racine]], [[Molière]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]], [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[John Milton]], [[Samuel Johnson]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[William Wordsworth]], [[Jane Austen]], [[Stendhal]], [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Walt Whitman]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Herman Melville]], [[George Eliot]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[James Joyce]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[T.S. Eliot]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Pablo Neruda]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Fernando Pessoa]], [[Albert Camus]] and [[Samuel Beckett]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Bloom]], ''[[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages]]'', 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ken|last=Tucker|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,304173,00.html|title=Book Review: 'The Western Canon: The Books and the School of the Ages'; Books|work=EW.com|date=21 October 1994|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harold Bloom]] has divided the body of Western Literature into four ages&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sonic.net/~rteeter/grtbloom.html|title=Bloom. Western Canon|first=Teeter,|last=Robert|date=|website=sonic.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

*The Theocratic Age (2000 BC - 1321 AD), with five main traditions that influenced the West:
**The Ancient Near East; e.g. ''[[Gilgamesh]]'', ''[[The Book of the Dead]]'' and the ''[[Bible]]''
**Ancient India; e.g. ''[[Mahabharata]]''
**Ancient Greece; e.g. the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' of [[Homer]]
**Ancient Rome; e.g. the ''[[Aeneid]]'' ([[Virgil]]) and the ''[[Metamorphoses (Ovid)|Metamorphoses]]'' ([[Ovid]])
**The Middle Ages; e.g. the ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'' of [[Saint Augustine]]

*The Aristocratic Age (1321 - 1832), with five major bodies of literature:
**Italy; e.g. the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' ([[Dante]]), ''[[The Prince]]'' ([[Machiavelli]]) and ''[[The Servant of Two Masters]]'' ([[Carlo Goldoni]])
**France; e.g. [[The Misanthrope]] ([[Molière]]), the [[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]] ([[Montaigne]]) and the [[Candide]] ([[Voltaire]])

**[[Great Britain]] &amp; [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]]; e.g. ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' ([[William Shakespeare]]), ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' ([[John Milton]]) and ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' ([[Jonathan Swift]])

*The Democratic Age (1832 - 1900), when the strength of American and Russian literature begins
**[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain &amp; Ireland]]; e.g. ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' ([[Oscar Wilde]]) and ''[[The Adventures of Oliver Twist]]'' ([[Charles Dickens]])
**Italy; e.g. ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' ([[Alessandro Manzoni]]) and ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' ([[Carlo Collodi]])

**Russia; e.g. ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' ([[Dostoevsky]]) and ''[[War and Peace]]'' ([[Leo Tolstoy]])
**United States; e.g. ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' ([[Mark Twain]]) and ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' ([[Herman Melville]])

*The Chaotic Age (1900-today), which includes a multitude of countries and authors.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Great Books Program===
[[Image:Great Books.jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[Great Books of the Western World]]'' in 60 volumes]]
A university or college [[Great Books]] Program is a program inspired by the Great Books movement begun in the United States in the 1920s by Prof. [[John Erskine (educator)|John Erskine]] of [[Columbia University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radicalacademy.com/adlerlowelllec.htm |title=radicalacademy.com |publisher=radicalacademy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proposed to improve the higher education system by returning it to the western [[liberal arts]] tradition of broad cross-disciplinary learning. These academics and educators included [[Robert Hutchins]], [[Mortimer Adler]], [[Stringfellow Barr]], [[Scott Buchanan]], [[Jacques Barzun]], and [[Alexander Meiklejohn]]. The view among them was that the emphasis on narrow specialization in American colleges had harmed the quality of [[higher education]] by failing to expose students to the important products of Western civilization and thought.

The essential component of such programs is a high degree of engagement with primary texts, called the Great Books. The curricula of Great Books programs often follow a canon of texts considered more or less essential to a student's education, such as Plato's ''Republic'', or Dante's ''Divine Comedy''. Such programs often focus exclusively on Western culture. Their employment of primary texts dictates an interdisciplinary approach, as most of the Great Books do not fall neatly under the prerogative of a single contemporary academic discipline. Great Books programs often include designated discussion groups as well as lectures, and have small class sizes. In general students in such programs receive an abnormally high degree of attention from their professors, as part of the overall aim of fostering a community of learning.

Over 100 institutions of higher learning, mostly in the United States, offer some version of a Great Books Program as an option for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Casement|first=William|title=College Great Books Programs|url=http://www.coretexts.org/college-great-books-programs/#tz|publisher=The Association for Core Texts and Courses (ACTC)|accessdate=May 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debate===
{{anchor|Dead white men}}
There has been an ongoing debate, especially in the US, over the nature and status of the canon since at least the 1960s, much of which is rooted in [[critical theory]], [[feminism]], [[critical race theory]], and [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name="Hicks 2004 p. 18"/&gt; In particular, [[postmodern]] studies have argued that the body of scholarship is biased, because the main focus traditionally of the academic studies of history and [[Western culture]] has only been on Europe and men. American philosopher [[Jay Stevenson]] argues:
:[In] the postmodern period […] [t]raditional literature has been found to have been written by "dead white males" to serve the ''ideological'' aims of a conservative and repressive Anglo ''hegemony'' […] In an array of reactions against the race, gender, and class biases found to be woven into the tradition of Anglo lit, multicultural writers and political literary theorists have sought to expose, resist, and redress injustices and prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jay Stevenson|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to English Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SoL1Di1HRBIC&amp;pg=PA9|year=2007|publisher=Alpha Books|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Classicist]] [[Bernard Knox]] made direct reference to this topic when he delivered his 1992 [[Jefferson Lecture]] (the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the [[humanities]]).&lt;ref name="jefflect"&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/jefflect.html Jefferson Lecturers] at NEH Website (retrieved May 25, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  Knox used the intentionally "provocative" title "The Oldest Dead White European Males"&lt;ref&gt;Nadine Drozan, [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/06/style/chronicle-879492.html  "Chronicle"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 6, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; as the title of his lecture and his subsequent book of the same name, in both of which Knox defended the continuing relevance of [[Classics|classical]] culture to modern society.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Knox, ''The Oldest Dead White European Males and Other Reflections on the Classics'' (1993) (reprint, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1994), {{ISBN|978-0-393-31233-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lehmann"&gt;[[Christopher Lehmann-Haupt]], [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/29/books/books-of-the-times-putting-in-a-word-for-homer-herodotus-plato-etc.html "Books of The Times; Putting In a Word for Homer, Herodotus, Plato, Etc."], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 29, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some intellectuals have championed a "high conservative modernism" that insists that universal truths exist, and have opposed approaches that deny the existence of universal truths.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald J. Russello, ''The Postmodern Imagination of Russell Kirk'' (2007) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Many argued that "[[natural law]]" was the repository of timeless truths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hyrum S. Lewis|title=Sacralizing the Right: William F. Buckley Jr., Whittaker Chambers, Will Herberg and the Transformation of Intellectual Conservatism, 1945–1964|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QviaoxgkmFwC&amp;pg=PA122|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allan Bloom]], in his highly influential ''[[The Closing of the American Mind|The Closing of the American Mind: How Higher Education Has Failed Democracy and Impoverished the Souls of Today's Students]]'' (1987) argues that moral degradation results from ignorance of the great [[classics]] that shaped Western culture. Bloom further comments: "But one thing is certain: wherever the Great Books make up a central part of the curriculum, the students are excited and satisfied."&lt;ref&gt;Allan Bloom (2008), p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; His book was widely cited by some intellectuals for its argument that the classics contained universal truths and timeless values which were being ignored by [[cultural relativism|cultural relativists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=M. Keith Booker|title=Encyclopedia of Literature and Politics: A–G|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JcFC4oiDmpgC&amp;pg=PA180|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood|pages=180–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Williams, ed. ''PC wars: Politics and theory in the academy'' (Routledge, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yale University]] Professor of Humanities and famous literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] (no relation) has also argued strongly in favor of the canon, in his 1994 book ''[[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages]]'',  and in general the canon remains as a represented idea in many institutions,&lt;ref name="Searle"/&gt; though its implications continue to be debated.

Defenders maintain that those who undermine the canon do so out of primarily political interests, and that such criticisms are misguided and/or disingenuous. As [[John Searle]], Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley, has written:
{{Quote|There is a certain irony in this [i.e., politicized objections to the canon] in that earlier student generations, my own for example, found the critical tradition that runs from [[Socrates]] through the [[The Federalist Papers|''Federalist Papers'']], through the writings of [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] and [[Karl Marx|Marx]], down to the twentieth century, to be liberating from the stuffy conventions of traditional American politics and pieties. Precisely by inculcating a critical attitude, the "canon" served to demythologize the conventional pieties of the American bourgeoisie and provided the student with a perspective from which to critically analyze American culture and institutions. Ironically, the same tradition is now regarded as oppressive. The texts once served an unmasking function; now we are told that it is the texts which must be unmasked.&lt;ref name="Searle"&gt;Searle, John. (1990) "The Storm Over the University", ''The New York Review of Books'', December 6, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of the main objections to a canon of literature is the question of authority; who should have the power to determine what works are worth reading? Searle's rebuttal suggests that "one obvious difficulty with it [i.e., arguments against hierarchical ranking of books] is that if it were valid, it would argue against any set of required readings whatever; indeed, any list you care to make about anything automatically creates two categories, those that are on the list and those that are not."&lt;ref name="Searle"/&gt;

[[Charles Altieri]], of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], states that canons are "an institutional form for exposing people to a range of idealized attitudes." It is according to this notion that work may be removed from the canon over time to reflect the contextual relevance and thoughts of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-a-literary-canon.htm|title=What is a Literary Canon? (with pictures)|author=|date=|website=wisegeek.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; American historian [[Todd M. Compton]] argues that canons are always communal in nature; that there are limited canons for, say a literature survey class, or an English department reading list, but there is no such thing as one absolute canon of literature. Instead, there are many conflicting canons. He regards Bloom's "Western Canon" as a personal canon only.&lt;ref&gt;[http://toddmcompton.com/infinitecanonsprint.htm Compton, "''Infinite Canons: A Few Axioms and Questions, and in Addition, a Proposed Definition. A response to Harold Bloom''"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of defining the boundaries of the canon is endless. The philosopher [[John Searle]] has said, "In my experience there never was, in fact, a fixed 'canon'; there was rather a certain set of tentative judgments about what had importance and quality. Such judgments are always subject to revision, and in fact they were constantly being revised."&lt;ref name="Searle"/&gt; One of the notable attempts at compiling an authoritative canon for literature in the [[English language|English]]-speaking world was the ''[[Great Books of the Western World]]'' program. This program, developed in the middle third of the 20th century, grew out of the curriculum at the [[University of Chicago]]. University president [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] and his collaborator [[Mortimer Adler]] developed a program that offered reading lists, books, and organizational strategies for reading clubs to the general public.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} An earlier attempt had been made in 1909 by [[Harvard University]] president [[Charles W. Eliot]], with the [[Harvard Classics]], a 51-volume anthology of classic works from world literature. Eliot's view was the same as that of Scottish philosopher and historian [[Thomas Carlyle]]: "The true University of these days is a Collection of Books". ("The Hero as Man of Letters", 1840)

===In the English-speaking world===

==== British renaissance poetry ====

{{main article|Elizabethan literature|Metaphysical poets}}
The canon of Renaissance English poetry of the 16th and early 17th century has always been in some form of flux and towards the end of the 20th century the established canon was criticized, especially by those who wished to expand it to include, for example, more women writers.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waller|first1=Gary F.|title=English Poetry of the Sixteenth Century|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0582090962|pages=263–70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L9gFBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR4&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=Waller,+Gary.+English+Poetry+of+the+Sixteenth+Century|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the central figures of the British renaissance canon remain, [[Edmund Spenser]], Sir [[Philip Sidney]], [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Ben Jonson]], and [[John Donne]].&lt;ref&gt;"English Poetry" James P. Bednarz. Oxford Bibliographies [http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399301/obo-9780195399301-0209.xml]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]], [[John Donne|Donne]], and [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]] were major influences on 17th-century poetry. However, poet [[John Dryden]] condemned aspects of the metaphysical poets in his criticism. In the 18th century [[Metaphysical poetry]] fell into further disrepute,&lt;ref&gt;"Life of Cowley," in Samuel Johnson's ''Lives of the Poets''&lt;/ref&gt; while the interest in [[Elizabethan literature|Elizabethan poetry]] was rekindled through the scholarship of [[Thomas Warton]] and others. However, the canon of Renaissance poetry was formed in the Victorian period with anthologies like Palgrave's ''[[Golden Treasury]]''.&lt;ref&gt; Gary F. Waller, (2013). ''English Poetry of the Sixteenth Century''. London: Routledge. p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twentieth century [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Yvor Winters]] were two literary critics who were especially concerned with revising the canon of renaissance English literature. Eliot, for example, championed poet [[Sir John Davies]] in an article in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' in 1926. During the course of the 1920s, Eliot did much to establish the importance of the metaphysical school, both through his critical writing and by applying their method in his own work. However, by 1961 [[A. Alvarez]] was commenting that "it may perhaps be a little late in the day to be writing about the Metaphysicals. The great vogue for Donne passed with the passing of the Anglo-American experimental movement in modern poetry."&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Two decades later, a hostile view was expressed that emphasis on their importance had been an attempt by Eliot and his followers to impose a 'high Anglican and royalist literary history' on 17th-century English poetry.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Brown &amp; Taylor (2004), ''ODNB''&lt;/ref&gt;

The American critic [[Yvor Winters]] suggested in 1939 an alternative canon of [[Elizabethan poetry]],&lt;ref&gt;''Poetry'', LII (1939, pp. 258-72, excerpted in Paul. J. Alpers (ed): ''Elizabethan Poetry. Modern Essays in Criticism''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; which would exclude the famous representatives of the [[Petrarchan|Petrarchan school]] of poetry, represented by Sir [[Philip Sidney]] and [[Edmund Spenser]]. Winters claimed that the Native or Plain Style ''anti-Petrarchan'' movement had been undervalued and argued that [[George Gascoigne]] (1525–1577) "deserves to be ranked […] among the six or seven greatest lyric poets of the century, and perhaps higher".&lt;ref&gt;''Poetry'', LII (1939, pp. 258–72, excerpted in Paul. J. Alpers (ed): ''Elizabethan Poetry. Modern Essays in Criticism''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1967: 98&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the 20th century the established canon was increasingly under fire.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Expansion of the literary canon in the 20th century===
In the twentieth century there was a general reassessment of the [[literary canon]], including [[Women's writing in English|women's writing]], [[post-colonial literature]]s, [[LGBT literature|gay and lesbian literature]], writing by people of colour, working people's writing, and the cultural productions of historically marginalized groups. This reassessment has resulted in a whole scale expansion of what is considered "literature", and genres hitherto not regarded as "literary", such as children's writing, journals, letters, travel writing, and many others are now the subjects of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name=Blain/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Buck |editor1-first=Claire |title=The Bloomsbury Guide to Women's Literature |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1992 |page=vix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Salzman |first=Paul |chapter=Introduction |title=Early Modern Women's Writing |publisher=Oxford UP |year=2000 |pages=ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western literary canon has also expanded to include the literature of Asia, Africa, the [[Middle East]], and South America. Writers from countries like Turkey, China, Egypt, Peru, and Colombia, Japan, etc., have received Nobel prizes since the late 1960s. Writers from Asia and Africa have also been nominated for, and also won, the [[List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize for Fiction|Booker prize]] in recent years. 

==== Feminism and the literary canon ====
{{See also|Écriture féminine|List of American feminist literature|List of feminist literature|List of feminist poets}}
[[File:Sartre and de Beauvoir at Balzac Memorial.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] at [[Balzac]] Memorial ]]
The feminist movement produced both feminist fiction and non-fiction and created new interest in women's writing. It also prompted a general reevaluation of women's [[Women's history|historical]] and academic contributions in response to the belief that women's lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name=Blain&gt;{{cite book |author=Blain, Virginia |author2=Clements, Patricia |author3=Grundy, Isobel  |title=The feminist companion to literature in English: women writers from the Middle Ages to the present |year=1990 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-04854-8 |pages=vii–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, in Britain and America at least women achieved major literary success from the late eighteenth century, and many major nineteenth-century British novelists were women, including [[Jane Austen]], the [[Brontës|Brontë family]], [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], and [[Mary Ann Evans|George Eliot]]. There were also three major female poets, [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]],&lt;ref name="Leighton"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angela Leighton|title=Elizabeth Barrett Browning|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wHp90dJD7fkC&amp;pg=PA8|accessdate=22 October 2011|year=1986|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-25451-1|pages=8–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christina Rossetti]] and [[Emily Dickinson]].&lt;ref name="Bloo9"&gt;Bloom (1999), 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ford (1966), 122&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century there were also many major female writers, including [[Katherine Mansfield]], [[Dorothy Richardson]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Eudora Welty]], and [[Marianne Moore]]. Notable female writers in France include [[Colette]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]]; and in Russia, [[Anna Akhmatova]].

Much of the early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women. [[Virago Press]] began to publish its large list of 19th and early 20th-century novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation.

====Black authors====
In the twentieth century, the Western literary canon started to include black writers not only from [[African-American literature|black American writers]], but also from the [[African diaspora|wider black diaspora]] of writers in Britain, France, Latin America, and Africa. This is largely due to the shift in social and political views during the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States.  The first global recognition came in 1950 when [[Gwendolyn Brooks]] was the first black American to win a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Literature. [[Chinua Achebe]]'s novel ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'' helped draw attention to [[African literature]]. Nigerian [[Wole Soyinka]] was the first African to win the [[Nobel Prize]] in Literature in 1986, and American [[Toni Morrison]] was the first black woman to win in 1993.

Some early American [[Black writers]] were inspired to defy ubiquitous racial prejudice by proving themselves equal to white American authors. As Henry Louis Gates, Jr., has said, "it is fair to describe the subtext of the history of black letters as this urge to refute the claim that because blacks had no written traditions they were bearers of an inferior culture."&lt;ref name = "Stryz_p140"&gt;"The Other Ghost in Beloved: The Specter of the Scarlet Letter" by Jan Stryz from ''The New Romanticism: a collection of critical essays'' by Eberhard Alsen, p. 140, {{ISBN|0-8153-3547-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

African-American writers were also attempting to subvert the literary and power traditions of the United States. Some scholars assert that writing has traditionally been seen as "something defined by the dominant culture as a white male activity."&lt;ref name = "Stryz_p140"/&gt; This means that, in American society, literary acceptance has traditionally been intimately tied in with the very power dynamics which perpetrated such evils as racial discrimination. By borrowing from and incorporating the non-written oral traditions and folk life of the [[African diaspora]], African-American literature broke "the mystique of connection between literary authority and [[patriarchal]] power."&lt;ref&gt;Quote from Marjorie Pryse in "The Other Ghost in Beloved: The Specter of the Scarlet Letter" by Jan Stryz, from ''The New Romanticism: a collection of critical essays'' by Eberhard Alsen, p. 140, {{ISBN|0-8153-3547-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In producing their own literature, African Americans were able to establish their own literary traditions devoid of the white intellectual filter. This view of African-American literature as a tool in the struggle for Black political and cultural liberation has been stated for decades, most famously by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].&lt;ref name = "jhu_theory"&gt;Mason, [http://www.press.jhu.edu/books/hopkins_guide_to_literary_theory/free/african-american_theory_and_criticism-_1.html "African-American Theory and Criticism"] (accessed July 6, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Asia and Africa====
Since the 1960s the Western literary canon has been expanded to include writers from Asia, Africa, the Middle East. This is reflected in the Nobel prizes awarded in literature.

[[Yasunari Kawabata]] (1899 – 1972)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yasunari Kawabata - Facts|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1968/kawabata-facts.html|accessdate=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[novelist]] and [[short story]] writer whose spare, lyrical, subtly-shaded prose works won him the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1968, the first Japanese author to receive the award. His works have enjoyed broad international appeal and are still widely read.

[[Naguib Mahfouz]] (1911 &amp;ndash; 2006) was an [[Egypt]]ian writer who won the 1988 [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. He is regarded as one of the first contemporary writers of [[Arabic literature]], along with [[Tawfiq el-Hakim]], to explore themes of [[existentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Haim Gordon|title=Naguib Mahfouz's Egypt: Existential Themes in His Writings|url=http://doi.contentdirections.com/mr/greenwood.jsp?doi=10.1336/0313268762|accessdate=2007-04-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927042834/http://doi.contentdirections.com/mr/greenwood.jsp?doi=10.1336%2F0313268762|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published 34 novels, over 350 short stories, dozens of movie scripts, and five plays over a 70-year career. Many of his works have been made into [[Egyptian cinema|Egyptian]] and foreign films.

[[Kenzaburō Ōe]] (b. 1935) is a Japanese writer and a major figure in contemporary [[Japanese literature]]. His novels, short stories, and essays, strongly influenced by French and American literature and [[literary theory]], deal with political, social, and philosophical issues, including [[nuclear weapon]]s, [[nuclear power]], [[anticonformism|social non-conformism]], and [[existentialism]].

García Márquez started as a journalist, and wrote many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories, but is best known for his novels, such as ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'' (1967), ''[[The Autumn of the Patriarch]]'' (1975), and ''[[Love in the Time of Cholera]]'' (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style labeled as [[magic realism]], which uses magical elements and events in otherwise ordinary and realistic situations. Some of his works are set in a fictional village called [[Macondo]] (the town mainly inspired by his birthplace [[Aracataca]]), and most of them explore the theme of [[solitude]]. On his death in April 2014, [[Juan Manuel Santos]], the President of Colombia, described him as "the greatest Colombian who ever lived."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/19/gabrielgarciamarquez-colombia|title=Gabriel García Márquez: 'The greatest Colombian who ever lived'|first=Ed|last=Vulliamy|date=19 April 2014|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canon of Western philosophers==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2016}}

{{see also|List of important publications in philosophy}} 

The discussion of the literary canon above, especially with regard to "Great Book" and the "debate" over the canon, is also relevant.

[[Ancient Greek philosophy]] has consistently held a prominent place in the canon. Only a relatively small number of works of Greek philosophy have survived, essentially those thought most worth copying in the Middle Ages. [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]] and, indirectly, [[Socrates]] are the primary figures. [[Roman philosophy]] is included, but regarded as less significant (as it tended to be even by the Romans themselves).  The [[ancient philosophy]] of other cultures now receives more attention than before the 20th century.  The vast body of [[Christian philosophy]] is typically represented on reading lists mainly by Saints [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]], and the 12th-century Jewish scholar [[Maimonides]] is now usually represented, mostly by ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]''. The academic canon of [[early modern philosophy]] generally includes [[Descartes]], [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[David Hume|Hume]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], though influential contributions to philosophy were made by many thinkers in this period.&lt;ref&gt;Aloysius Martinich, Fritz Allhoff, Anand Vaidya, ''Early modern philosophy: essential readings with commentary''. Oxford : Blackwell, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Women in philosophy|Women have engaged in philosophy]] throughout the field's history. There were female [[philosopher]]s since ancient times, notably [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active c. 325 BC) and [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BC), and some were accepted as philosophers during the [[ancient philosophy|ancient]], [[Medieval philosophy|medieval]], [[Modern philosophy|modern]] and [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] eras, but almost no female philosophers have entered the philosophical Western canon.&lt;ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"&gt;Duran, Jane.

While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."&lt;ref name="salon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/08/15/philosophy_has_a_sexual_harassment_problem/|title=Philosophy has a sexual harassment problem|author=|date=15 August 2013|website=salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greeks===
Many [[philosopher]]s today agree that Greek philosophy has influenced much of [[Western culture]] since its inception. [[Alfred North Whitehead]] once noted: "The safest general characterization of the [[Europe]]an philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to [[Plato]]."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead (1929), ''[[Process and Reality]]'', Part II, Chap. I, Sect. I.&lt;/ref&gt; Clear, unbroken lines of influence lead from [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophers]] to [[Early Islamic philosophy]], the European [[Renaissance]], and the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141031222017/http://kevinscharp.com/Kevin%20Scharp%20-%20%20Diagrams.htm Kevin Scharp (Department of Philosophy, Ohio State University) – Diagrams].&lt;/ref&gt; Greek philosophy was probably influenced by the philosophy and mythological cosmogonies of the [[ancient Near East]], as well as Indian Vedanta philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;J.

[[Plato]] was a [[philosopher]] in [[Classical Greece]] and the founder of the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] in [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], the first institution of higher learning in the [[Western world]]. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the [[Western philosophy|Western tradition]], unlike nearly all of his [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosophical contemporaries]].&lt;ref&gt;"...the subject of philosophy, as it is often conceived—a rigorous and systematic examination of ethical, political, metaphysical, and epistemological issues, armed with a distinctive method—can be called his invention" ({{cite web |last=Kraut |first=Richard |title=Plato |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato/ |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |publisher=Stanford University |date=11 September 2013 |accessdate=3 April 2014 |ref=harv}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, John M.; Hutchinson, D. S., eds. (1997): "Introduction".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]] and scientist. His writings cover many subjects –&amp;nbsp;including [[Physics (Aristotle)|physics]], [[Aristotle's biology|biology]], [[zoology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], ethics, [[aesthetics]], [[Poetics (Aristotle)|poetry]], theater, music, [[rhetoric]], [[linguistics]], politics and government—and constitute the first comprehensive system of [[Western philosophy]].&lt;ref name="philosophy1972"&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;
Aristotle's views on [[Aristotelian physics|physical science]] had a profound influence on medieval scholarship. Their influence extended from [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]] into the [[Renaissance]], and his views were not replaced systematically until [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] and theories such as [[classical mechanics]]. In metaphysics, [[Aristotelianism]] profoundly influenced [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800–1400)|Judeo-Islamic philosophical and theological thought]] during the [[Middle Ages]] and continues to influence [[Christian theology]], especially the [[Neoplatonism]] of the [[Early Church]] and the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Aristotle was well known among medieval Muslim intellectuals and revered as "The First Teacher" ({{lang-ar|{{big|المعلم الأول}}}}). His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of [[virtue ethics]]. All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cicero |first=Marcus Tullius |publication-date=1874 |origyear=106–43 BC |chapter=Book II, chapter XXXVIII, §119 |title=The Academica of Cirero  |editor-first=James S. |editor-last=Reid  |location=London |publisher=Macmillian and company |ref=harv}} "''veniet flumen orationis aureum fundens Aristoteles''", (Google translation: "Aristotle will come pouring forth a golden stream of eloquence")&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian philosophy===

Major Western writers and philosophers have been influenced by [[Eastern philosophy]]. 

Through his teacher [[Ammonius Saccas]] (died {{circa|AD 265}}, the Greek speaking philosopher [[Plotinus]] may have been influenced by Indian thought, because of the similarities between [[neoplatonism]] and the [[Vedanta]] philosophies of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Bussanich. The roots of Platonism and Vedanta. International Journal of Hindu Studies. January 2005, Volume 9, Issue 1, pp 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, R.

===Renaissance philosophy===
Major philosophers of the [[Renaissance]] include [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Pico della Mirandola]], [[Nicholas of Cusa]], [[Giordano Bruno]] and [[Galileo Galilei]].

===Seventeenth-century philosophers===
{{expand section|date=November 2018}}
The seventeenth century was important for philosophy, and the major figures were [[Francis Bacon]] (1561–1626), [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679), [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650), [[Baruch Spinoza]] (1632–1677), [[John Locke]] (1632–1704), [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646–1716),  and [[Isaac Newton]] (1642– c.1726).&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;"Western Philosophy", [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Western-philosophy/Modern-philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eighteenth-century philosophers===
Major philosophers of the eighteenth century include [[George Berkeley]] (1685–1753), [[David Hume]] (1711–1776), [[Adam Smith]] (1723–1790), [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804), [[Jeremy Bentham]] (1748–1832), [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778), [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712–1778), and [[Edmund Burke]] (1729–1797).&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

===Nineteenth-century philosophers===
Important nineteenth century philosophers include [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770-1831), [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (1813-1855), [[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900).

===Twentieth-century philosophers===

Major twentieth century figures are [[Henri Bergson]] (1859–1941), [[Edmund Husserl]] (1859-1938), [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872-1970), [[Martin Heidegger]] (1889-1976) and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] (1889–1951). A porous distinction between [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[Continental philosophy|continental]] approaches emerged during this period. The term "continental" is misleading, as many prominent British philosophers such as [[R. G. Collingwood]] and [[Michael Oakeshott]] were non-analytic, and many non-British European philosophers like [[Wittgenstein]] were analytic. Moreover, analytic approaches are dominant in the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Germany, and parts of east-central Europe today. Some argue in English-speaking countries, it is better to distinguish between the dominant approaches of university departments, where Modern Language departments tend to favor continental methods and philosophy department tends to favor analytic ones. However, the humanities/social sciences departments in general such as history, sociology, anthropology, and political science departments in English-speaking countries tend to favor continental methods such as those by [[Michel Foucault]] (1926-1984), [[Pierre Bourdieu]] (1930-2002) and [[Jürgen Habermas]] (1929- ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Most cited authors of books|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/most-cited-authors-of-books-in-the-humanities-2007/405956.article|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are the most-cited publications in the social sciences (according to Google Scholar)?|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2016/05/12/what-are-the-most-cited-publications-in-the-social-sciences-according-to-google-scholar/|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female philosophers have begun to gain prominence in the last hundred years. Notable female philosophers from the contemporary period include [[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985), [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986), and [[Martha Nussbaum]] (1947–  ).

==Classical music==
[[File:Johann Sebastian Bach.jpg|left|thumb|[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] ]]
The term "classical music" did not appear until the early 19th century, in an attempt to distinctly canonize the period from [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] to [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] as a golden age. In addition to Bach and Beethoven, the other major figures from this period were [[Joseph Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Rushton, Julian]], ''Classical Music'', (London, 1994), 10&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to "classical music" recorded by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is from about 1836.&lt;ref name="Music 2007"&gt;"Classical", ''The Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music'', ed. Michael Kennedy, (Oxford, 2007), ''Oxford Reference Online''. Retrieved July 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[classical music]], during the nineteenth century a "canon" developed which focused on what was felt to be the most important works written since 1600, with a great concentration on the later part of this period, termed the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]], which is generally taken to begin around 1750. After Beethoven, the major nineteenth-century composers include [[Robert Schumann]], [[Frédéric Chopin]], [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Richard Wagner]], [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Giacomo Puccini]], and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ten Top Romantic Composers".''Gramapne'' [https://www.gramophone.co.uk/feature/top-10-romantic-composers].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, the standard concert repertoire of professional orchestras, chamber music groups, and choirs tends to focus on works by a relatively small number of mainly 18th- and 19th-century male composers. Many of the works deemed to be part of the musical canon are from genres regarded as the most ''serious'', such as the [[symphony]], [[concerto]], [[string quartet]], and [[opera]]. [[Folk music]] was already giving [[art music]] melodies, and from the late 19th century, in an atmosphere of increasing [[nationalism]], folk music began to influence composers in formal and other ways, before being admitted to some sort of status in the canon itself.

Since the early twentieth century [[non-Western music]] has begun to influence Western composers. In particular, direct homages to [[Java]]nese [[gamelan music]] are found in works for western instruments by [[Claude Debussy]], [[Béla Bartók]], [[Francis Poulenc]], [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[John Cage]], [[Steve Reich]], and [[Philip Glass]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.coastonline.org/mml/topic/topicsSearch_detail.php?id=312 Western Artists and Gamelan]", ''CoastOnline.org''.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307082145/http://www.coastonline.org/mml/topic/topicsSearch_detail.php?id=312 |date=2014-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Debussy was immensely interested in non-Western music and its approaches to composition. Specifically, he was drawn to the Javanese [[Gamelan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rest Is Noise|last=Ross|first=Alex|publisher=Fourth Estate|year=2008|isbn=978-1-84115-475-6|location=London|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which he first heard at the 1889 Paris Exposition. He was not interested in directly quoting his non-Western influences, but instead allowed this non-Western aesthetic to generally influence his own musical work, for example, by frequently using quiet, unresolved dissonances, coupled with the damper pedal, to emulate the "shimmering" effect created by a [[gamelan]] ensemble.

In the latter half of the 20th century the canon expanded to cover the so-called [[Early music]] of the pre-classical period, and [[Baroque music]] by composers other than Bach and [[George Frideric Handel]]. including [[Antonio Vivaldi]], [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Domenico Scarlatti]], [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]], [[François Couperin]], [[Heinrich Schütz]], and [[Dieterich Buxtehude]]. Earlier composers, such as [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Orlande de Lassus]] and [[William Byrd]], have also received more attention in the last hundred years.{{Citation needed|reason=List of names with no source|date=January 2017}}

The absence of female composers from the canon has been debated in the twentieth century, even though there have been [[women composers|female composers]] throughout the classical music period.  Marcia J Citron, for example, has examined "the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women [sic] composers from the received 'canon' of performed musical works."&lt;ref name=Citron&gt;Citron, Marcia J. "Gender and the Musical Canon." CUP Archive, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently the music of [[Hildegard von Bingen]] (1098–1179), a German Benedictine abbess, has been rediscovered, and both the Russian [[Sofia Gubaidulina]] (born 1931) and Finnish [[Kaija Saariaho]] (born 1952) have achieved international reputations. Saariaho's opera ''[[L'amour de loin]]'' has been staged in some of the world's major opera houses, including The [[English National Opera]] (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Fiona Maddocks | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/12/rusalka-glyndebourne-opera-review-coliseum | title=Singin' through the pain | work=The Guardian | date=2009-07-11 | accessdate=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016 the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York.

{{main article|Art history}}
The backbone of traditional Western [[art history]] are [[artwork]]s commissioned by wealthy patrons for private or public enjoyment. Much of this was religious art, mostly [[Roman Catholic art]]. The [[classical art]] of Greece and Rome has, since the Renaissance, been the fount of the Western tradition.

[[Giorgio Vasari]] (1511–1574) is the originator of the artistic canon and the originator of many of the concepts it embodies.  His ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'' covers only artists working in Italy,&lt;ref&gt;With nods in the text to [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Albrecht Dürer]], but not lives.&lt;/ref&gt; with a strong pro-Florentine prejudice, and has cast a long shadow over succeeding centuries.  Northern European art has arguably never quite caught up to Italy in terms of prestige, and Vasari's placing of [[Giotto]] as the founding father of "modern" painting has largely been retained.  In painting, the rather vague term of [[Old master]] covers painters up to about the time of [[Goya]].

This "canon" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection present in art history textbooks, as well as the prices obtained in the [[art trade]]. But there have been considerable swings in what is valued. In the 19th century the [[Baroque]] fell into great disfavour, but it was revived from around the 1920s, by which time the [[Academic art|art]] of the 18th and 19th century was largely disregarded. The [[High Renaissance]], which Vasari regarded as the greatest period, has always retained its prestige, including works by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], and [[Raphael]], but the succeeding period of [[Mannerism]] has fallen in and out of favour. 

In the 19th century the beginnings of academic art history, led by German universities, led to much better understanding and appreciation of [[medieval art]], and a more nuanced understanding of classical art, including the realization that many if not most treasured masterpieces of sculpture were late Roman copies rather than Greek originals. The European tradition of art was expanded to include [[Byzantine art]] and the new discoveries of [[archaeology]], notably [[Etruscan art]], [[Celtic art]] and [[Upper Paleolithic art]].

Since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of art made by women; vernacular creativity, especially in printed media; and an expansion to include works in the Western tradition produced outside Europe.  At the same time there has been a much greater appreciation of non-Western traditions, including their place with Western art in wider global or [[Eurasia]]n traditions. The [[decorative arts]] have traditionally had a much lower critical status than [[fine art]], although often highly valued by collectors, and still tend to be given little prominence in undergraduate studies or popular coverage on television and in print.

===Women and art===
{{main article|Women artists}}

English artist and sculptor [[Barbara Hepworth]] [[Order of the British Empire|DBE]] (1903&amp;nbsp;– 1975), whose work exemplifies [[Modernism]], and in particular modern sculpture, is one of the few female artists to achieve international prominence.&lt;ref name=gale&gt;Gale, Matthew [http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/dame-barbara-hepworth-1274 "Artist Biography: Barbara Hepworth 1903–75"] Retrieved 31 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the art of American [[modernist]] [[Georgia O'Keefe]] has been staged at the [[Tate Modern]], in London, and is then moving in December 2016 to [[Vienna]], Austria, before visiting the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]], Canada in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ago.net/art-gallery-of-ontario-partners-with-tate-modern-to-present-georgia-okeeffe-retrospective-in-summer-2017|title=Art Gallery of Ontario partners with Tate Modern to present Georgia O'Keeffe retrospective in summer 2017 – AGO Art Gallery of Ontario|author=|date=|website=www.ago.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical exclusion of Women====
Women were discriminated against in terms of obtaining the training necessary to be an artist in the mainstream Western traditions. In addition, since the Renaissance the [[Nude (art)|nude]], more often than not female,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} has had a special position as subject matter. In her 1971 essay, "[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]", [[Linda Nochlin]] analyzes what she sees as the embedded privilege in the predominantly male Western art world and argues that women's outsider status allowed them a unique viewpoint to not only critique women's position in art, but to additionally examine the discipline's underlying assumptions about gender and ability.&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nochlin|first=Linda|author-link=Linda Nochlin|chapter=[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]|title=Women, Art and Power and Other Essays|year=1971|publisher=Westview Press|url=&lt;!-- |accessdate = 2014-11-28 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nochlin's essay develops the argument that both formal and social education restricted artistic development to men, preventing women (with rare exception) from honing their talents and gaining entry into the art world.&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists" /&gt;

In the 1970s, feminist art criticism continued this critique of the institutionalized sexism of art history, art museums, and galleries, and questioned which genres of art were deemed museum-worthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Atkins |first1= Robert |author-link1= |year= 2013|title= Artspeak: A Guide to Contemporary Ideas, Movements, and Buzzwords, 1945 to the Present |edition= 3rd|location= New York|publisher= Abbeville Press |isbn= 9780789211507 |oclc=855858296}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position is articulated by artist [[Judy Chicago]]:
"[I]t is crucial to understand that one of the ways in which the importance of male experience is conveyed is through the art objects that are exhibited and preserved in our museums. Whereas men experience presence in our art institutions, women experience primarily absence, except in images that do not necessarily reflect women's own sense of themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chicago|first1=Judy|author-link1=Judy Chicago|last2=Lucie-Smith|first2=Edward|author-link2=Edward Lucie-Smith|title=Women and Art: Contested Territory|year=1999|publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications|location=New York|isbn=0-8230-5852-2|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contemporary anthologies of renaissance literature====
The preface to the [[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]] anthology of ''Renaissance Literature'' from 2003 acknowledges the importance of online access to literary texts on the selection of what to include, meaning that the selection can be made on basis of functionality rather than representativity".&lt;ref&gt;''Michael Payne &amp; John Hunter (eds). Renaissance Literature: an anthology''. Oxford: Blackell, 2003, {{ISBN|0-631-19897-0}}, p. xix&lt;/ref&gt; This anthology has made its selection based on three principles. One is "unabashedly ''canonical''", meaning that Sidney, Spenser, Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Jonson have been given the space prospective users would expect. A second principle is "non-canonical", giving female writers such as [[Anne Askew]], [[Elizabeth Cary, Lady Falkland|Elizabeth Cary]], [[Emilia Lanier]], [[Martha Moulsworth]], and [[Lady Mary Wroth]] a representative selection. It also includes texts that may not be representative of the qualitatively best efforts of Renaissance literature, but of the quantitatively most numerous texts, such as homilies and erotica. A third principle has been thematic, so that the anthology aims to include texts that shed light on issues of special interest to contemporary scholars.

The Blackwell anthology is still firmly organised around authors, however. A different strategy has been observed by ''The Penguin Book of Renaissance Verse'' from 1992.&lt;ref&gt;''David Norbrook &amp; H. R. Woudhuysen (eds.): ''The Penguin Book of Renaissance Verse''. London: Penguin Books, 1992, {{ISBN|0-14-042346-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here the texts are organised according to topic, under the headings ''The Public World'', ''Images of Love'', ''Topographies'', ''Friends, Patrons and the Good Life'', ''Church, State and Belief'', ''Elegy and Epitaph'', ''Translation'', ''Writer, Language and Public''. It is arguable that such an approach is more suitable for the interested reader than for the student. While the two anthologies are not directly comparable, since the Blackwell anthology also includes prose and the Penguin anthology goes up to 1659, it is telling that while the larger Blackwell anthology contains work by 48 poets, seven of which are women, the Penguin anthology contains 374 poems by 109 poets, including 13 women and one poet each in Welsh, [[Siôn Phylip]], and Irish, [[Eochaidh Ó Heóghusa]].

An initiative of [[Brian Mikkelsen]] in 2004, it was developed by a series of committees under the auspices of the [[Ministry of Culture (Denmark)|Danish Ministry of Culture]] in 2006–2007 as "a collection and presentation of the greatest, most important works of Denmark's cultural heritage."  Each category contains 12 works, although music contains 12 works of score music and 12 of popular music, and the literature section's 12th item is an anthology of 24 works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturalpolicies.net/web/denmark.php?aid=41 "Denmark/ 4.
