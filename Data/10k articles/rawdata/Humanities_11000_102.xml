'''''African Silences''''' is a 1991 book by [[Peter Matthiessen]] published by [[Random House]]. It recounts journeys through Equatorial Africa to study the situation of elephants and other wildlife and is a meditation upon the natural world and mankind's relationship to it and effect upon it.

==Content==
The book recounts two sets of journeys: firstly, trips in the 1970s to Senegal, Gambia, and the Ivory Coast (with the primatologist [[Gilbert Boese]]) and secondly a 1986 trip to Gabon and Zaire. In different areas he explored different animals - for example, in Zaire, he was concerned primarily with the [[Congo peacock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=African Silences Essay - Critical Essays|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/african-silences|website=Enotes|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthiessen observed that the situation in terms of animal populations and their sustainability was often far worse than anticipated - in certain cases "the animals are so scarce that they have no reality in daily life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=African Silences|url=http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/peter-matthiessen/african-silences/|website=Kirkus|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The silence of the title refers to the silences caused by the absence of animals on the one hand and the growing absence of verdant forest away from the greater and greater proliferation of human urbanisation.

One element of slight optimism amongst the rather despairing reports of the 'silencing' of nature (which has an echo of [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'') is the discussion of moves for an international ban on the ivory trade, which Matthiessen thought were influenced by the study conducted by him in collaboration with the ecologist [[David Western]] regarding the population of the [[forest elephant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gould|first1=Stephen Jay|title=The Last Chance Continent|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/23/home/matthiessen-silences.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also has a political subtext, since Matthiessen also commented on the brutality of certain governments in the region, as well as discussing the environment and the natural world. Certain human groups are described in far more glowing terms, such as the [[Mbuti pygmies]] in the [[Ituri Forest]].

'''''Aglaura''''' is a late [[Literature in English#Caroline and Cromwellian literature|Caroline]] era stage play, written by Sir [[John Suckling (poet)|John Suckling]]. Several aspects of the play have led critics to treat it as a key development and a marker of the final decadent phase of [[English Renaissance theatre|English Renaissance drama]].

==Performance==
Suckling's earliest play, ''Aglaura'' was staged in [[1637 in literature|1637]] by the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] at the [[Blackfriars Theatre]] &amp;mdash; not because they thought it was a good play or a potential popular hit, but because Suckling subsidized its production, reportedly spending between £300 and £400. The acting company was paid with the production's lavish costumes (lace cuffs and ruffs made of cloth of silver and cloth of gold), a form of hand-me-down compensation that the King's men accepted only in the 1630s, at a time when the company's fortunes were in relative decline. (When the same company staged a revival of [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher's]] ''[[The Faithful Shepherdess]]'' in [[1634 in literature|1634]], they used the sumptuous costumes that had been created for Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria's]] [[masque]] of that year, ''[[The Shepherd's Paradise]];'' they were then allowed to keep the costumes.)

A 1638 production of ''Aglaura'' at the English royal court borrowed [[Inigo Jones]]'s scenery from ''[[Luminalia]],'' the Queen's masque of that year. Again, the hand-me-down nature of the proceedings is a noteworthy departure from the practices of the 1620s and earlier.

==Genre==
Unusually, Suckling wrote the play as a [[tragedy]], but added an alternative happy ending, so creating an optional [[tragicomedy]]. Suckling changed the ending for the April 1638 performance before the King, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], and Queen Henrietta Maria.

==Publication==
''Aglaura'' was entered into the [[Stationers' Register]] on 18 April, [[1638 in literature|1638]] and published later that year, in an edition printed by John Haviland for the bookseller [[Thomas Walkley]] &amp;mdash; a vanity edition subsidized by Suckling. Instead of the [[book size|quarto]] format then standard for individual plays, ''Aglaura'' was printed in the larger [[book size|folio]] format, normally restricted for serious works. (Stage plays were then treated largely as ephemera with little claim as serious literature.) Critics &amp;mdash; [[Richard Brome]]&lt;ref&gt;Brome wrote a satiric poem "Upon Aglaura in Folio". For Brome's hostility to Suckling, see: ''[[The Court Beggar]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; was prominent among them &amp;mdash; mocked the folio edition of ''Aglaura,'' especially the unusually broad page margins that compensated for the limited text. (For modern readers, the pleasing innovation of the 1638 edition is that it abstained from the full and verbose titles fashionable in the 17th century, and employed a title of one word.) The play was reprinted by [[Humphrey Moseley]] in his [[book size|octavo]] collection of Suckling's works, ''Fragmenta Aurea,'' in [[1646 in literature|1646]] and [[1648 in literature|1648]], and was included in subsequent collections. An early manuscript of the work also exists, in the collection of the [[British Museum]] (''Royal MS. 18 C. 25'').

A modern facsimile edition of ''Aglaura'' was issued in 1970, reproduced from the copy in the collection of the [[British Museum]].

==Inspiration==
Suckling may have based his heroine on a young woman named Mary Bulkeley, the daughter of Sir [[Richard Bulkeley (d. 1621)|Richard Bulkeley]]. She was courted by the author, and is thought to have inspired him to write much of his best work.&lt;ref&gt;Madoc-Jones, pp. 196-203.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Restoration==
''Aglaura'' was revived during the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] era; it was reportedly played at the [[Red Bull Theatre]] on 27 February [[1662 in literature|1662]], in the original version, "the tragical way." Later that same year, the actor Theophilus Bird was said to have broken his leg while fencing onstage in a performance of ''Aglaura''.&lt;ref&gt;Downes, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Pepys]] saw a [[King's Company]] production on 10 January [[1668 in literature|1668]] (but he didn't like it). A Suckling lyric from the play, "Why so pale and wan, fond lover," became a popular song of the era. [[John Dryden]], an admirer of Suckling's verse, borrowed lines from ''Aglaura'' for his first comedy, ''[[The Wild Gallant]].'' Sir [[Robert Howard (playwright)|Robert Howard]] was impressed with Suckling's dual ending, and imitated it in his own play ''The Vestal Virgin.''

==Plot==
Suckling's plot is set in a wildly ahistorical and inauthentic [[Persia]]. The King of Persia and his son, Prince Thersames, are both in love with Aglaura; she loves the Prince, but the King takes precedence. The Queen, Orbella, is in love with the King's brother Ariaspes but is the mistress of Ziriff alias Zorannes, captain of the guard and Aglaura's brother. Iolas, a member of the royal council, is a pretended friend of the prince, but in fact a traitor; he is in love with Semanthe, who is in love with Ziriff. Complications ensue.

(Semanthe loves Ziriff &amp;mdash; but platonically. This is Suckling's nod to the cult of [[Platonic love]] that was a cornerstone of Henrietta Maria's Court culture. Suckling also includes an anti-Platonic lord named Orsames, but doesn't do much with the Platonic theme.)

In the original tragic version, Aglaura secretly marries Thersames, but mistakenly stabs him to death, thinking he is the king. Most of the other characters, including Aglaura herself, die violent deaths. In the tragicomic revision, Aglaura merely wounds the prince, and the king repents and dispenses justice. (The actual difference between the versions amounts to only about 50 lines).

'''Bajan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|eɪ|dʒ|ə|n}}) or '''Barbadian English''' is an [[English-based creole language]] with African influences spoken on the [[Caribbean island]] of [[Barbados]]. Bajan is primarily a [[spoken language]], meaning that in general, standard English is used in print, in the media, in the judicial system, in government, and in day-to-day business, while Bajan is reserved for less formal situations, in music, or in social commentary. Ethnologue estimates that Barbados has around 1,000 people who use English as their main language and 286,000 people who use Bajan as their main language.

==Languages==
Bajan is the Caribbean creole with grammar that most resembles [[Standard English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hancock|1980|p=22}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Le Page|1957|pp=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is academic debate on whether its creole features are due to an earlier pidgin state or to some other reason, such as contact with neighboring English-based creole languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hancock|1986|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one historical model, Bajan arose when captive West Africans were forcibly transported to the island, enslaved and forced to speak English, though learned imperfectly. Bajan later became a means of communicating without always being understood by the slave holders.

Due to emigration to the [[Province of Carolina]], Bajan has influenced [[American English]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barbados.org/usa_bdos.htm Barbados Tourism Encyclopaedia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/r/robertson-vesey.html ''New York Times'' – "The Buried History of America's Largest Slave Rebellion and the Man Who Led It"]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Gullah language]] spoken in the Carolinas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Carrington, Sean |title=A~Z of Barbados Heritage |year=2007 |publisher=Macmillan Caribbean Publishers Limited|pages=113, 114 |isbn=0-333-92068-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgewashingtonbarbados.org/index.asp?pgid=5 |title=Historical Facts on George Washingtons visit to Barbados in 1751 |accessdate=6 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115181915/http://www.georgewashingtonbarbados.org/index.asp?pgid=5 |archivedate=15 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regionally, Bajan has ties to [[Belizean Kriol language|Belizean]] and [[Guyanese Creole]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Unlike Jamaica, Guyana or Trinidad, Barbados was the destination of few enslaved African-born captives after 1800.&lt;ref name="Insight Guide Pg. 58"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Caroline |editor1-last=Radula-Scott |editor1-link= |others= |title=Barbados |edition= 3rd |series=Insight Guide |volume= |year= 2000|publisher=APA Publications |location= Singapore|isbn=981-234-067-X |page= 58 |chapter=Features: All o' We Is Bajan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[African Barbadians]] became "Bajanized" relatively early on in the island's history. This tended to make them less resistant to local culture, with its Anglicised language, religion and customs.&lt;ref name="Insight Guide Pg. 58"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carrington |first1=Sean |authorlink1= |last2=Fraser |first2=Henry |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=A~Z of Barbados Heritage |trans-title=|url= |format= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2003 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Macmillan Caribbean, |location=  |isbn=0-333-92068-6 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages=2–3 |trans-chapter=|chapter=African Heritage |chapterurl= |quote=Direct African influence declined in Barbados earlier than in other major Caribbean societies. In 1817 only 7 percent of Barbadian slaves had been born in Africa, whereas in Jamaica the proportion was 36 percent and 44 percent in Trinidad. An important result was that the process of acculturation, whereby Afro-Barbadians were persuaded or coerced into accepting European cultural norms was more intensive in Barbados. To give two examples, the proportion of words of African origin in the Barbadian vocabulary is much lower than it is in Jamaica, and there are in Barbados none of the religions of African or partly African origin found elsewhere in the Caribbean, such as Voodoo in Haiti, Shango in Trinidad, or Kélé in St. Lucia. (It may be claimed that the [[Spiritual Baptists]] are an exception, but this church came to Barbados from Trinidad in comparatively recent times.) |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bajan is a primarily spoken language with no standardised written form. Due to the lack of standardisation, spelling may vary widely from person to person. There is much dialectal variation throughout the island. Barbadians practicing Rastafari on the island also tend to speak more with a Jamaican accent than full Bajan. Bajan words and sentences presented below are largely spelled as they are pronounced. New terminology, expressions, jargon, and idioms are regularly added to the dialect by social commentary sung during the annual [[Crop Over]] festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barbadosadvocate.com/newsitem.asp?more=columnists&amp;NewsID=25888 Musings: In this jurisdiction, solely] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407060123/http://www.barbadosadvocate.com/newsitem.asp?more=columnists&amp;NewsID=25888 |date=7 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
As in most English-based Caribbean creoles, the [[dental fricative|interdental]]s {{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/ð/}} (as in "&lt;u&gt;th&lt;/u&gt;ing", and "&lt;u&gt;th&lt;/u&gt;e respectively) have merged with other consonants (in this case, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}}, respectively, resulting in "ting" and "de").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cassidy|1986|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most other Caribbean creoles, Bajan is fully [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]], and if anything more rhotic than [[North American Standard English]]. Bajan also has a strong tendency to realize syllable-final {{IPA|/t/}} as a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[ʔ]}}. Thus the Bajan pronunciation of ''start'', {{IPA|[stɑːɹʔ]}}, contrasts sharply with the pronunciation of other Caribbean speakers, {{IPA|[staːt]}} or {{IPA|[stɑːt]}} or {{IPA|[staːɹt]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aceto |first1=Michael |last2=Williams |first2=Jeffrey P. |date=1 Jan 2003 |title=Contact Englishes of the Eastern Caribbean |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L42oT48bPCEC&amp;pg=PA260&amp;lpg=PA260&amp;dq=bajan+rhotic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QRsxPMi39K&amp;sig=grDSMe_0yJHWiXOoI8MP4oM7MzY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-6crdyYzaAhUCxVkKHV73A04Q6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bajan%20rhotic&amp;f=false |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |page=260 |isbn=9789027248909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pronouns===
Pronouns in Bajan creole don't diverge too far from Standard English, however there are differences. As with other similar creoles, Bajan does not differentiate subject and object pronouns, as well as possessive pronouns, except in the case of the first person singular. Another difference is the word for the plural '''you''', which is ''wunna'', similar to the Jamaican word ''unnu'' / ''unna'' or Bahamian ''yinna''. Here is a list of [[Grammatical_person|pronouns]] in Bajan creole:

The word "yuh" is interchangeably pronounced {{IPA|/yu/}} or {{IPA|/yə/}}.

===Questions===
The structure of questions in Bajan creole varies from that of Standard English, as it is generally the same format as regular statements. Questions seeking yes or no answers are usually pronounced as a statement with only a raised [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] to differentiate, usually on the last word. For example ''Wunna win de cricket? '' means "Did you (pl.) win the cricket match?"; ''dahs yours?'' means "Is that yours?"

On the other hand, questions asking for information, i.e [[Five_Ws|who, what, when, where, why or how]], usually begin with a 'question word/phrase', saying what is being asked for, followed by a partial, or incomplete statement. For example ''"Wha he waun?"'' means ''"What does he want?"'' or ''"He wants what?"''. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Some question words, however, don't exist, or are seldom used in Bajan creole, including ''when, where and why'', and are achieved by making questions beginning with "wha" (what). For example, ''"Wha time you see he?"'' means ''"When did you see him?"'', and ''"Wha part de [[Chefette]]?"'' means ''"Where is the Chefette?"''. In addition, “why” questions can be achieved by asking “how come”. For example, “How come you get hey so late?”.

===Tenses===
The tense/aspect system of Bajan is fundamentally unlike that of English. In Bajan, verbs are seldom conjugated, and only have a few forms, lacking forms to express tense or distinguish between singular and plural. In particular, there are no morphological marked past tense forms corresponding to English "-ed", "-t" or other past tense forms.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} 

'''Continuous Tenses'''&lt;br&gt;
:Continuity is shown in Bajan creole in much the same way as it is in Standard English. In Bajan, the base of the verb is changed by adding "-in", "ing" or "ine" to the end. For many verbs, this simply results in a contracted form of the Standard English. For example, the base "do", from "to do", becomes "doin" in continuous tenses, which is a contracted form of the Standard English "doing".{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} 

'''Showing Tense'''&lt;br&gt;
:In Bajan creole, the tense of a verb is expressed through 'tense indicators'. These are special verbs which are conjugated for this purpose, and generally derive from the verbs ''"to be"'', ''"to do"'' and ''"to go"''.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} 

::'''[[Simple_present|The present tense]]''' is indicated by the words ''is'' or ''does'', with ''is'' being considered less proper. For example, 
::::"I does guh church pun a Sunduh" → "I go to church on Sundays"
::::"He is eat bare apples" → "He eats a lot of apples"
::The phrase "I is" or "I does", is quite commonly shortened to ''"I's"''. e.g. ''"I's guh church pun a Sunduh."''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
::'''[[Simple_past|The past tense]]''' unlike other tenses, is not indicated by a tense indicator, and uses only the base of the verb. For example,
::::"He walk town" → "He walked to town"
::::"Dem eat all de food" → "They ate all of the food".
::As an exception to the rules, the verb "to go" is conjugated to "went". For example,
::::"I went to church Sunduh" → "I went to church on Sunday"

::In Bajan creole, when the past tense structure is made continuous, it instead becomes the [[present continuous]], for example ''"He watchin de show"'' means ''"He is watching the show"'', and ''"She gine eat"'' means ''"She is going to eat"''. The present and past perfect continuous tenses replaces the [[Uses_of_English_verb_forms#Past_progressive|past continuous]].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
::'''[[Present_perfect|The present perfect tense]]''' uses the indicator "duh". For example,
::::"He duh dun get hey" → "He has already arrived"
::::"Wunna duh guh school" → "You all have gone to school.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
::'''[[Pluperfect|The past perfect or pluperfect tense]]''' is indicated by the word "did" or "dih". For example,
::::"He did waun guh tuh de confrunce" → "He had wanted to go to the conference".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
::'''[[Future_tense|The future tense]]''' is indicated by the word "gun" or "gon". For example,
::::"She gon bring wunna de receipt" → "She will bring you all the receipt"

:There are many more nuances to Bajan verbs and tenses in addition. One such nuance is that unlike Standard English, Bajan also tends towards using a [[zero copula]]. E.g. ''"We in de garage"'' means ''"We are in the garage"''. Moreover, the indicators are also used [[Copula_(linguistics)|copulas]], much like [[E-Prime#Different_functions_of_"to_be"|"to be"]] in Standard English. E.g. ''"She duh in de house"'' means ''"She was in the house"''.

'''Negative'''&lt;br&gt;
:Negatives are achieved by modifying the tense indicator of the sentence to end in ''n'', or by adding ''ain'' before the verb in the past tense, present continuous or in place of the copula, or in front of the indicator in the present perfect tense. Here is a list of indicators and their negative form.

| din/din did
| Dem din walk tuh she party&lt;br&gt; Wunna din did eat de cake.
| They hadn't walked to her party&lt;br&gt; You all hadn't eaten the cake.
|}

:"I ain" is usually contracted to "Ah'n". e.g "Ah'n see she dis evening" means "I didn't see her this evening".

==Proverbs==
Bajan is peppered with a number of colourful proverbs and sayings that have been passed down through the generations. These are just a few examples below:

{|class="wikitable"

! Meaning
|-
| '''De higha de monkey climb, de more he show he tail'''
| The more you show off the more you show your faults.
|-
| '''Gol' (gold) teet (teeth) doan suit hog mout (mouth)'''
| Fancy things don't suit those that aren't accustomed to them.
|-
| '''Cat luck ain' dog luck'''
| What one person may get away with may cause problems for another.
|-
|'''Wuh ain' see you, ain' pass you'''
|Just because you got away with something so far does not mean that it won't catch up with you later.
|-
| '''Ef greedy wait hot wud (would) cool'''
| Patience will be rewarded.
|}

==African words in Bajan==

Although most words in Bajan Creole are English in origin, many words are borrowed from West Africa languages and Irish dialects. The largest portion contributed to Bajan is from the Igbo language.

;wunna: You all from the [[Igbo language|Igbo]] word unu, which means You (plural).
;[[obeah]]: From Igbo Obia, 'doctoring, mysticism, or oracle'.
;Bim: From Igbo ''bé mụ́'', 'my place, people, kindred', common nickname for Barbados
;de, deh: From Igbo ''dị̀'', 'present in'
;eye-water: calque from ''ányá mmírí'' (eye + water), tears&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allsopp|Allsopp|2003|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;duppy: From [[Twi]] Adope.
;[[Cou-Cou]]: Part of the local [[national dish]], but comes from "Fou Fou" in Africa.
;nyam: (Pronounced "ng-yam" or "yamm") Means to eat ravenously or greedily, as in "Don't yamm the food like that boy!" – In [[Manjak language|Manjaku]] (language spoken in [[Guinea-Bissau]]) and in [[Pulaar]]it it means ''to chew ''(pronounced "nyam"); it also means ''chew'' in [[Luo languages|Luo]] (language spoken in [[East Africa]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}
;jook/juk: From the [[Fula language|Fula]] word jukka 'poke, spur'
;soso: From the [[Igbo language]] word soso 'only'
;hard-head: From [[ísí íké,]] (head + hard, strength), 'obstinate

'''Carmunnock''' ({{lang-gd|Cathair Mhanach}}) is a [[conservation area (United Kingdom)|conservation]] village within the [[City of Glasgow]] boundary, lying within {{convert|3|mi|0}} of [[East Kilbride]] and [[Rutherglen]] in South Lanarkshire and [[Busby, East Renfrewshire|Busby]] in [[East Renfrewshire]]. The nearest other district within Glasgow is [[Castlemilk]]. 
[[File:Carmunnock Parish Church (The Kirk o' the Braes).jpg|thumb|left|Carmunnock Parish Church]]
[[File:Carmunnock.jpg|thumb|left|Village store and the Clason hall]]

This ancient settlement which is associated with the early [[Christian]] missionary Saint [[Cadoc]], has a [[medieval]] street plan set within the lands of an estate held by variously the [[Clan Murray|Morays of Bothwell]], the [[Earl of Douglas|Earls of Douglas]] and eventually to the Lords, Marquesses and [[Duke of Hamilton|Dukes of Hamilton]] until 1700 when it passed to the Stuarts of [[Castlemilk House|Castlemilk]].

The village is a popular residential area. The village has its own primary school (Carmunnock Primary School) with around 178 pupils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=H.M.I.E|title=Carmunnock Primary School|url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/Images/CarmunnockPrimarySchIns20110207_tcm4-703478.pdf|date=2011-02-08|accessdate=2013-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007195533/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/Images/CarmunnockPrimarySchIns20110207_tcm4-703478.pdf#|archive-date=7 October 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a newsagent/village shop,

==Religion==
The only religious body in Carmunnock is the [[Church of Scotland]]'s Carmunnock Parish Church on Kirk Road, which is also known as 'The Kirk in the Braes'. The original church was built on site of the current Church around 800 years, with the current building being built in 1767 in the Civil Parish of Carmunnock.&lt;ref&gt;The Imperial gazetteer of Scotland. 1854. Vol.I. (AAN-GORDON) by Rev. John Marius Wilson. p.248. https://archive.org/stream/imperialgazettee01wils#page/248/mode/1up&lt;/ref&gt; The church features external stone staircases to three galleries within the sanctuary and contains examples of stained glass by Norman Macleod MacDougall.

The church is surrounded by the old village graveyard which includes a watch-house with original instructions for grave watchers of 1828, when grave robbing was a problem. Within the structure of the church is a vault where some members of the Stirling-Stewart family, the [[Castlemilk#Early History|Lairds of Castlemilk]], are buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Sacred Scotland|title =Carmunnock Parish Church|url=http://www.scotlandschurchestrust.org.uk/church/carmunnock-parish-church|accessdate =2013-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
The village's only public transport link is the number 31 bus service operated by  [[First Glasgow]] to [[Glasgow]] City Centre and East Kilbride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=First Bus Glasgow Online|title =31 Bus Timetable| url=http://www.firstgroup.com/ukbus/glasgow/journey_planning/timetables/index.php?operator=10&amp;service=31&amp;page=1&amp;redirect=no| year = 2013| accessdate =2013-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nearest train station is at [[Busby railway station|Busby]], which is on the East Kilbride to Glasgow line.

The main route through the village is the [[B roads in Zone 7 of the Great Britain numbering scheme|B759]] which runs from [[Busby, East Renfrewshire]] to [[Cambuslang]].

==Etymology==
Carmunnock is of [[British language (Celtic)|Brythonic]] origin, from [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] ''caer'' "fort" with an unknown second element. The name was recorded as ''Cerminok'' in 1183.

== Parts of ''Childbirth and Authoritative Knowledge: Cross-Cultural Perspectives'' ==

=== Part One "The Social Construction of Authoritative Knowledge in Childbirth" ===
This part of the book contains [[Brigitte Jordan]]'s essay ("Authoritative Knowledge and Its Construction") along with context for the reader about the other essays in the book.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Brigitte Jordan elaborates on the theme of authoritative knowledge in her book ''[[Birth in Four Cultures: A Crosscultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden, and the United States|Birth in Four Cultures: A Crosscultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden and the United States]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Primarily, this section of essays describes how technology is used in the American setting.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Firstly, Jordan elaborates on her idea of authoritative knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She specifically defines it as follows:

"For any particular domain several knowledge systems may exist, some of which, by consensus, carry more weight than others, either because they explain the state of the world better for the purposes at hand...or because they are associated with a stronger power base."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Jordan also uses her essay to critique the hierarchical use of authoritative knowledge in a birth setting and provide context for the rest of the essays in the book.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This theme is mentioned by other authors throughout the book.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Also in Part One of the book is an essay by Wenda R. Trevathan titled, "An Evolutionary Perspective on Authoritative Knowledge about Birth".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This essay compares the human birth process to that of the apes in order to take an evolutionary perspective.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=1997|title="Book Review", Davis-Floyd E, Sargent C F, eds.

=== Part Two "Intracultural Variations in Authoritative Knowledge about Birth: Biomedical Hegemony and Women's Choices" ===
This second section of Davis-Floyd and Sargent's edited collection contains four essays.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This set of papers looks at the large scale, macro-factors that effect pre-natal care and childbirth in [[Greece]], [[Japan]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This section of the book also examines the power dynamics that the biomedical field possesses in governing the way that women make choices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byford|first=Julia|year=1998|title="Childbirth and Authoritative Knowledge: Cross Cultural Perspectives" (Book Review)|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1299128178?accountid=15131|journal=Australian Journal of Anthropology|volume=9|pages=336–338|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eugenia Georges writes that in Greece, the ultrasound plays an important role in how a Greek mother views her pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For these mothers, authoritative knowledge is perpetuated by the ultrasound machine and the way that these women rely on it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In America, giving birth is often determined by class, income and authoritative knowledge.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is the topic of Carole H. Browner and Nancy Press's essay ("The Production of Authoritative Knowledge in American Prenatal Care") as well as the essay in the following chapter "What Do Women Want? Issues of Choice, Control and Class in American Pregnancy and Childbirth" written by Ellen Lazarus.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Browner and Press's essay specifically covers the role that biomedics play in what is perceived as authoritative knowledge for a successful birth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Ellen Lazarus shows that the lack of knowledge surrounding the technology used in hospitals, especially in terms of the race and class of the patient, combined with the good intentions of all those involved also perpetuates authoritative knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Lazarus elaborates on how things can go wrong despite the mother-to-be carefully selecting who will be involved in the birthing process.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The fourth and final essay in this part of the book "Authoritative Knowledge and Birth Territories in Contemporary Japan" by Deborah Cordero Fiedler discusses the role of authoritative knowledge in Japan.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In contrast to the United States, Japan uses technology during birth, however physicians will not immediately intervene.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Fiedler's findings discuss the role that culture has in impacting birth and motherhood in contemporary Japan.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Part Three "Intercultural Variations in Authoritative Knowledge about Birth Hierarchy, Community and the Social Ground" ===
This third section of the book also contain four essays giving examples of women in [[North America]], [[Nepal]], [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] who have given birth and some difficulties faced while doing so.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This group of chapters also examines how a top-down community approach and other approaches to childbirth intersect to create the way that authoritative knowledge surrounding this technology came to exist.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Carolyn F. Sargent and Grace Bascope ("Ways of Knowing about Birth in Three Cultures") write and essay that compares the ways that women view birth practitioners and decisions made during birth in [[Texas]], [[Jamaica]] and the [[Yucatán|Yucatan]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The author shows the ways that authoritative knowledge is used in certain social / cultural groups in relation to others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The essay by Shiela Kitzinger ("Authoritative Tough in Childbirth: A Cross-Cultural Approach") explores the way that women experience touch during birth, the different kinds of touch experiences and the ways that authoritative knowledge plays into this experience.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The following essay, by Stacy Leigh Pigg ("Authority in Translation: Finding, Knowing, Naming, and Training 'Traditional Birth Attendants' in [[Nepal]]") explores how training programs designed to train traditional birth attendants end up creating a unique hierarchy and power relation in Nepal.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The final essay in this part of the book "Changing Childbirth in Eastern Europe: Which Systems of Authoritative Knowledge Should Prevail?" written by Beverley Chalmers investigates the highly medicalized birth systems in Europe and which ones play a role in authoritative knowledge.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Part Four "Fighting the System: Creating and Maintaining Alternative Models of Authoritative Knowledge" ===
The fourth part of the book contains four essays, two of which follow the idea about the power that traditional birthing practices, such as midwifery can hold.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This part of the book shows some of the different models through which authoritative knowledge can be employed.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Which also works to encapsulate the ways that authoritative knowledge surrounding technology has been resisted in some countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There are also examples of the ways that mothers receive knowledge via childbirth activists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The first essay in this part is written by Jane Szurek ("Resistance to Technology-Enhanced Childbirth in [[Tuscany]]: The Political Economy of Italian Birth") and discusses the authority of the medical field in [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This essay takes a particular focus on the way that a more medicalized way of birth has been resisted, specifically by birth activists, in this part of the world.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An essay by [[Robbie Davis-Floyd]] and [[Elizabeth Davis (midwife)|Elizabeth Davis]] ("Intuition as Authoritative Knowledge in Midwifery and Home Birth") explores the dangers that American midwives face in their practice and the ways that their knowledge is used as authoritative knowledge.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The specific focus of this chapter is the viability of midwives' intuition as a source of knowledge.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The third author in this part of the book, Kenneth C. Johnson, ("Randomized Control Trials as Authoritative Knowledge: Keeping an Ally from Becoming a Threat to [[North America]]n Midwifery Practice") discusses the impact that evidenced-based care has on the use of the randomized control trial and the ways in which this kind of research can impede on the rights of women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The following essay in this part, written by Marsden Wagner, ("Confessions of a Dissident") explains the perspective that the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has on the care of mothers, only after describing how he got into the field of public health.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Part Five "Viable Indigenous Systems of Authoritative Knowledge: Continuity in the Face of Change" ===
The final part of the book follows communities and countries that utilize indigenous birthing systems, resist change and are able to maintain their existing systems of authoritative knowledge.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The cultures examined are: [[Oaxaca]], [[Mexico]], the Puejehun District, [[Sierra Leone]], the [[Inuit]] community, and the Kung of Kalahari.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Paola M.

'''''Clinton: The Musical''''' is a [[satiric]] [[musical theatre|musical]] with music and lyrics by Paul Hodge, and a book by Paul Hodge and Michael Hodge and based on the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton]]. After success in various festivals, the show played [[Off-Broadway]] in the spring of 2015.

==Background==
The musical is based on the premise that there are two sides to [[Bill Clinton]]: the mature and charismatic side ("WJ") and the fun and reckless side ("Billy").  Imagining  the two personalities as distinct characters, the musical follows the two Bill Clintons and [[Hillary Clinton]] through the major events of Bill Clinton's presidency.

==Synopsis==

===Act 1===

As the show begins, Hillary Rodham Clinton introduces herself and her husband, William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton. She reveals that Bill is actually two personalities, WJ and Billy, and that she is the only person who can see both of them. ("Overture"). With help from Hillary, WJ and Billy win the 1992 presidential election ("Awful-Awesome"). After arriving at the White House, WJ states his plans to be a serious and successful president, Hillary states her plan to be loved by the American people, and Billy states his plan to "get some tail" ("The Me I See"). In order to remain focused on his job, WJ starts ignoring Billy's fun-loving urges. Just a few days after being inaugurated, the media starts reporting on the Whitewater scandal, despite the fact that nobody who is reporting has any idea what the scandal actually is, and are just stretching the story out to gain viewers ("The Day After That"). Kenneth Starr is hired to investigate the scandal. Starr announces to the audience that he doesn't actually care about the American people or the Whitewater scandal, he's just in it for the fame ("A Starr is Born"). Hillary becomes increasingly worried that Billy will use his new office to cheat on her. As WJ reassures Hillary that he'll control Billy, Billy seduces White House intern Monica Lewinsky in the Oval Office ("Lie to You"). In order to comfort Hillary, WJ tells her that she can write the country's new healthcare plan. Republican Newt Gingrich is infuriated by this, and he works with Ken Starr to rally other Republicans and take control of the Congress majority ("Say Nay"). During an encounter with Billy in the Oval Office, Monica Lewinsky exclaims that she can't believe she's having an affair with the president ("Monica's Song"). WJ finds out about this and confronts Billy, starting an argument between the two. Hillary finds out about their fight and explains to them that "the public likes it better when politicians work together" ("Both Ways"). After settling his differences with Billy, WJ confronts Newt Gingrich and convinces him to pass Hillary's healthcare bill. WJ and Billy are reelected in the presidential election of 1996, but Billy is the only one that takes the oath of office, which means Billy is able to start ignoring WJ as payback for the beginning of their first term ("Both Ways (Reprise)").

===Act 2===

As his second term begins, Billy celebrates in the Oval Office, while Linda Tripp secretly collects evidence of his affair with Monica ("What Could Go Wrong?"). Linda's evidence becomes public, but Billy attempts to convince the American people that the affair never happened ("That Woman, Miss Lewinsky"). Since he is officially the president, Billy must give the State of the Union address, a job WJ had previously done. Billy can't resist making sexual innuendos while writing his speech, so Hillary is forced to write the address and let Billy take all the credit ("State of the Union"). Having been abandoned by Billy and the American people, WJ reflects on all the things he was hoping to accomplish in his second term ("A Place Called Hope"). Monica, whom Billy has also abandoned, looks back on how confident he made her feel during their affair ("Monica's Song (Reprise)"). Hillary becomes increasingly angry at both WJ and Billy for the things they do behind her back. Though she still loves them, she decides she can't handle the stress anymore and tells the audience that she plans to divorce them ("Enough"). Meanwhile, Kenneth and Newt lead the movement to impeach and remove Billy from office ("Sexual Relations"). Hillary is visited by a vision of Elenor Roosevelt, who tries to convince her to stay with Billy and WJ, but Hillary misinterprets Eleanor and instead decides that she's going to run for president ("Brew It For Your Country"). Billy and WJ realize that their legacy will not be the work they did to advance universal healthcare, but instead, they will always be remembered for Billy's affair ("The Me I See / What Could Go Wrong? (Reprise)"). WJ and Billy forgive each other and apologize to Hillary. The three decide that the only way to ensure that Billy remains in office is to reveal to the world that William Jefferson Clinton is, in fact, two people. Newt is hesitant to forgive the Clintons but is forced to when WJ reveals Newt's affair with Calista Bisek. The senate votes to keep Billy in office and Hillary announces her 2008 candidacy for president ("Finale").

The "'''Dark Ages'''" is a historical [[periodization]] traditionally referring to the [[Middle Ages]], that asserts that a demographic, cultural, and economic deterioration occurred in Western Europe following the [[decline of the Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|year=1989|edition=2|quote=a term sometimes applied to the period of the Middle Ages to mark the intellectual darkness characteristic of the time; often restricted to the early period of the Middle Ages, between the time of the fall of Rome and the appearance of vernacular written documents.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dark+age|title=Definition of DARK AGE|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Petrarch===
[[File:Tommaso.Laureti Triumph.of.Christianity.jpg|thumb|''Triumph of Christianity'' by [[Tommaso Laureti]] (1530&amp;ndash;1602), ceiling painting in the [[Raphael Rooms#Sala di Costantino|Sala di Constantino]], [[Vatican City|Vatican Palace]]. Images like this one celebrate the triumph of Christianity over the paganism of Antiquity.]]

The idea of a Dark Age originated with the Tuscan scholar [[Petrarch]] in the 1330s.&lt;ref name=mommsen&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mommsen | first = Theodore E.| authorlink =Theodor Ernst Mommsen | title = Petrarch's Conception of the 'Dark Ages' | journal = [[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]] | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 226–242 | publisher = [[Medieval Academy of America]] | location = Cambridge MA | year = 1942 | jstor = 2856364| doi = 10.2307/2856364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt; Writing of the past, he said: "Amidst the errors there shone forth men of genius; no less keen were their eyes, although they were ''surrounded by darkness'' and dense gloom".&lt;ref&gt;[[Petrarch]] (1367). ''Apologia cuiusdam anonymi Galli calumnias'' (''Defence against the calumnies of an anonymous Frenchman''), in Petrarch, ''Opera Omnia'', Basel, 1554, p. 1195. This quotation comes from the English translation of Mommsen's article, where the source is given in a footnote. Cf. also Marsh, D, ed., (2003), ''Invectives'', Harvard University Press, p. 457.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity|Christian]] writers, including Petrarch himself,&lt;ref name=mommsen/&gt; had long used traditional [[metaphor]]s of '[[light versus darkness]]' to describe '[[Good and evil|good versus evil]]'. Petrarch was the first to give the metaphor [[secularity|secular]] meaning by reversing its application. He now saw Classical Antiquity, so long considered a 'dark' age for its lack of Christianity, in the 'light' of its cultural achievements, while Petrarch's own time, allegedly lacking such cultural achievements, was seen as the age of darkness.&lt;ref name=mommsen/&gt;

From his perspective on the Italian peninsula, Petrarch saw the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and classical period as an expression of greatness.&lt;ref name=mommsen/&gt; He spent much of his time travelling through Europe, rediscovering and republishing classic [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] texts. He wanted to restore the Latin language to its former purity. [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanists]] saw the preceding 900 years as a time of stagnation, with history unfolding not along the religious outline of [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]'s [[Six Ages of the World]], but in ''cultural'' (or secular) terms through progressive development of classical ideals, literature, and art.

Petrarch wrote that history had two periods: the classic period of [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], followed by a time of darkness in which he saw himself living. In around 1343, in the conclusion of his epic ''[[Africa (Petrarch)|Africa]]'', he wrote: "My fate is to live among varied and confusing storms. But for you perhaps, if as I hope and wish you will live long after me, there will follow a better age. This sleep of forgetfulness will not last forever. When the darkness has been dispersed, our descendants can come again in the former pure radiance."&lt;ref&gt;[[Petrarch]] (1343). ''[[Africa (Petrarch)|Africa]]'', IX, 451-7. This quotation comes from the English translation of Mommsen's article.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century, historians [[Leonardo Bruni]] and [[Flavio Biondo]] developed a three-tier outline of history. They used Petrarch's two ages, plus a modern, 'better age', which they believed the world had entered. Later the term 'Middle Ages' - Latin ''media tempestas'' (1469) or  ''medium aevum'' (1604) - was used to describe the period of supposed decline.&lt;ref name="Albrow"&gt;
Albrow, Martin, ''The global age: state and society beyond modernity'' (1997), p. 205.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformation===
During the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]s of the 16th and 17th centuries, Protestants generally had a similar view to Renaissance Humanists such as Petrarch, but also added an [[Anti-Catholicism|Anti-Catholic]] perspective. They saw classical antiquity as a golden time, not only because of its Latin literature, but also because it witnessed the beginnings of Christianity. They promoted the idea that the 'Middle Age' was a time of darkness also because of corruption within the Roman Catholic Church, such as:  Popes ruling as kings, veneration of [[Relic|saints' relics]], a licentious priesthood, and institutionalized moral hypocrisy.&lt;ref&gt;F. Oakley, ''The medieval experience: foundations of Western cultural singularity'' (University of Toronto Press, 1988), pp. 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baronius=== 
In response to the Protestants, Catholics developed a counter-image to depict the [[High Middle Ages]] in particular as a period of social and religious harmony, and not 'dark' at all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Daileader|Daileader, Philip]] (2001). ''The High Middle Ages''. The Teaching Company. {{ISBN|1-56585-827-1}}. "Catholics living during the Protestant Reformation were not going to take this assault lying down. They, too, turned to the study of the Middle Ages, going back to prove that, far from being a period of religious corruption, the Middle Ages were superior to the era of the Protestant Reformation, because the Middle Ages were free of the religious schisms and religious wars that were plaguing the 16th and 17th centuries."&lt;/ref&gt; The most important Catholic reply to the ''Magdeburg Centuries'' was the ''[[Annales Ecclesiastici]]'' by Cardinal [[Caesar Baronius]]. Baronius was a trained historian who produced a work that the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' in 1911 described as "far surpassing anything before"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=History |volume=13} |page=530 |first=James Thomson |last=Shotwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Acton]] regarded as "the greatest history of the Church ever written".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]] (1906). ''[[s:Lectures on Modern History|Lectures on Modern History]]'', p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Annales'' covered the first twelve centuries of Christianity to 1198, and was published in twelve volumes between 1588 and 1607. It was in Volume X that Baronius coined the term "dark age" for the period between the end of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in 888&lt;ref&gt;Baronius's actual starting-point for the "dark age" was 900 (''annus Redemptoris nongentesimus''), but that was an arbitrary rounding off due mainly to his strictly [[annalists|annalistic]] approach. Later historians, e.g. Marco Porri in his Catholic ''History of the Church'' [http://contemplativinelmondo.splinder.com (''Storia della Chiesa'')] or the Lutheran ''Christian Cyclopedia'' [http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=s&amp;word=SAECULUMOBSCURUM ("Saeculum Obscurum")], have tended to amend it to the more historically significant date of 888, often rounding it down further to 880. The first weeks of 888 witnessed both the final break-up of the Carolingian Empire and the death of its deposed ruler [[Charles the Fat]]. Unlike the end of the Carolingian Empire, however, the end of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] cannot be precisely dated, and it was the latter development that was responsible for the "lack of writers" that Baronius, as a historian, found so irksome.&lt;/ref&gt; and the first stirrings of [[Gregorian Reform]] under [[Pope Clement II]] in 1046:

{{quote|"The new age (''saeculum'') which was beginning, for its harshness and barrenness of good could well be called iron, for its baseness and abounding evil leaden, and moreover for its lack of writers (''inopia scriptorum'') dark (''obscurum'')".&lt;ref&gt;[[Caesar Baronius|Baronius, Caesar]] (1602). ''[[Annales Ecclesiastici]]'', Vol. X. Roma, p. 647. "Novum incohatur saeculum quod, sua asperitate ac boni sterilitate ferreum, malique exudantis deformitate plumbeum, atque inopia scriptorum, appellari consuevit obscurum."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Significantly, Baronius termed the age 'dark' because of the paucity of written records. The "lack of writers" he referred to may be illustrated by comparing the number of volumes in [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]]'s ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' containing the work of Latin writers from the 10th century (the heart of the age he called 'dark') with the number containing the work of writers from the preceding and succeeding centuries. A minority of these writers were historians.

[[File:European Output of Manuscripts 500–1500.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Medieval production of manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Buringh, Eltjo; van Zanden, Jan Luiten: "Charting the "Rise of the West": Manuscripts and Printed Books in Europe, A Long-Term Perspective from the Sixth through Eighteenth Centuries", ''The Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 69, No. 2 (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;409–445 (416, table 1)&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the Middle Ages was also a period of low activity in copying. Note that this graph does not include the Byzantine Empire.]]

There is a sharp drop from 34 volumes in the 9th century to just 8 in the 10th. The 11th century, with 13, evidences a certain recovery, and the 12th century, with 40, surpasses the 9th, something the 13th, with just 26, fails to do. There was indeed a 'dark age', in Baronius's sense of a "lack of writers", between the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] in the 9th century and the beginnings, some time in the 11th, of what has been called the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]]. Furthermore, there was an earlier period of "lack of writers" during the 7th and 8th centuries.  So, in Western Europe, two 'dark ages' can be identified, separated by the brilliant but brief [[Carolingian Renaissance]].

Baronius's 'dark age' seems to have struck historians, for it was in the 17th century that the term started to proliferate in various European languages, with his original Latin term ''{{lang|la|saeculum obscurum}}'' being reserved for the period he had applied it to. But while some, following Baronius, used 'dark age' neutrally to refer to a dearth of written records, others used it pejoratively, lapsing into that lack of objectivity that has discredited the term for many modern historians.

The first British historian to use the term was most likely [[Gilbert Burnet]], in the form 'darker ages' which appears several times in his work during the later 17th century. The earliest reference seems to be in the "Epistle Dedicatory" to Volume I of ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'' of 1679, where he writes: "The design of the reformation was to restore Christianity to what it was at first, and to purge it of those corruptions, with which it was overrun in the later and darker ages."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilbert Burnet|Burnet, Gilbert]] (1679). ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'', Vol. I. Oxford, 1929, p. ii.&lt;/ref&gt; He uses it again in the 1682 Volume II, where he dismisses the story of "St George's fighting with the dragon" as "a legend formed in the darker ages to support the humour of chivalry".&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilbert Burnet|Burnet, Gilbert]] (1682). ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'', Vol. II. Oxford, 1829, p. 423. Burnet also uses the term in 1682 in ''The Abridgement of the History of the Reformation of the Church of England'' (2nd Edition, London, 1683, p. 52) and in 1687 in ''Travels through France, Italy, Germany and Switzerland'' (London, 1750, p. 257). The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' erroneously cites the last of these as the earliest recorded use of the term in English.&lt;/ref&gt; Burnet was a bishop chronicling how England became Protestant, and his use of the term is invariably pejorative.

===Enlightenment===
During the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 17th and 18th centuries, many critical thinkers saw religion as antithetical to reason. For them the Middle Ages, or "Age of Faith", was therefore the opposite of the [[Age of Reason]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Bartlett (historian)|Bartlett, Robert]] (2001). "Introduction: Perspectives on the Medieval World", in ''Medieval Panorama''. {{ISBN|0-89236-642-7}}. "Disdain about the medieval past was especially forthright amongst the critical and rationalist thinkers of the Enlightenment. For them the Middle Ages epitomized the barbaric, priest-ridden world they were attempting to transform."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Voltaire]] were vocal in attacking the Middle Ages as a period of social regress dominated by religion, while [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' expressed contempt for the "rubbish of the Dark Ages".&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon, Edward]] (1788). ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Vol. 6, Ch. XXXVII, paragraph 619.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet just as Petrarch, seeing himself at the cusp of a "new age", was criticising the centuries before his own time, so too were Enlightenment writers.

Consequently, an evolution had occurred in at least three ways. Petrarch's original metaphor of light versus dark has expanded over time, implicitly at least. Even if later humanists no longer saw themselves living in a ''dark'' age, their times were still not ''light'' enough for 18th-century writers who saw themselves as living in the ''real'' Age of Enlightenment, while the period to be condemned stretched to include what we now call [[Early Modern]] times. Additionally, Petrarch's metaphor of darkness, which he used mainly to deplore what he saw as a lack of secular achievement, was sharpened to take on a more explicitly anti-religious and [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] meaning.

Nevertheless, the term 'Middle Ages', used by Biondo and other early humanists after Petrarch, was in general use before the 18th century to denote the period before the Renaissance. The earliest recorded use of the English word "medieval" was in 1827. The concept of the Dark Ages was also in use, but by the 18th century it tended to be confined to the earlier part of this period. The earliest entry for a capitalized "Dark Ages" in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' is a reference in [[Henry Thomas Buckle]]'s ''History of Civilization in England'' in 1857.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; Starting and ending dates varied: the Dark Ages were considered by some to start in 410, by others in 476 when there was no longer an emperor in Rome, and to end about 800, at the time of the Carolingian Renaissance under [[Charlemagne]], or alternatively to extend through to the end of the 1st millennium.

===Romanticism===
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the [[Romanticism|Romantics]] reversed the negative assessment of Enlightenment critics with a vogue for [[medievalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Michael (2007). ''Medievalism: The Middle Ages in Modern England''. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "[[Goths|Gothic]]" had been a term of opprobrium akin to "[[Vandal]]" until a few self-confident mid-18th-century English "Goths" like [[Horace Walpole]] initiated the [[Gothic Revival]] in the arts. This stimulated interest in the Middle Ages, which for the following generation began to take on the idyllic image of an "Age of Faith". This, reacting to a world dominated by Enlightenment [[rationalism]], expressed a romantic view of a [[Golden Age]] of [[chivalry]].  The Middle Ages were seen with [[nostalgia]] as a period of social and environmental harmony and spiritual inspiration, in contrast to the excesses of the [[French Revolution]] and, most of all, to the environmental and social upheavals and [[utilitarianism (architecture)|utilitarianism]] of the developing [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, Alice K. (1971). ''A Dream of Order: The Medieval Ideal in Nineteenth-Century English Literature''. University of Nebraska Press, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romantics' view is still represented in modern-day [[Renaissance fair|fairs and festivals]] celebrating the period with '[[Merry England|merrie]]' costumes and events.

Just as Petrarch had twisted the meaning of light versus darkness, so the Romantics had twisted the judgment of the Enlightenment. However, the period they idealized was largely the [[High Middle Ages]], extending into [[Early modern period|Early Modern]] times. In one respect, this negated the religious aspect of Petrarch's judgment, since these later centuries were those when the power and prestige of the Church were at their height. To many, the scope of the Dark Ages was becoming divorced from this period, denoting mainly the centuries immediately following the fall of Rome.

==Modern academic use==
{{See also|Medieval studies}}
The term was widely used by 19th-century historians. In 1860, in ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'', [[Jacob Burckhardt]] delineated the contrast between the medieval 'dark ages' and the more enlightened [[Renaissance]], which had revived the cultural and intellectual achievements of antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, John (2008). ''The Road from Eden: Studies in Christianity and Culture''. Palo Alto, CA: Academica Press, p. 148, fn 3.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the early 20th century saw a radical re-evaluation of the Middle Ages, which called into question the terminology of darkness,&lt;ref name=dmas/&gt; or at least its more pejorative use. The historian [[Denys Hay]] spoke ironically of "the lively centuries which we call dark".&lt;!--This quote has also been attributed to A. T. Hatto, and if correct, this would be the more original reference, but but pending a source we must be content with the Hay reference.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Denys Hay|Hay, Denys]] (1977). ''Annalists and Historians''. London: Methuen, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; More forcefully, a book about the [[history of German literature]] published in 2007 describes "the dark ages" as "a popular if ignorant manner of speaking".&lt;ref&gt;Dunphy, Graeme (2007). "Literary Transitions, 1300–1500: From Late Mediaeval to Early Modern" in: ''The Camden House History of German Literature'' vol IV: "Early Modern German Literature".  The chapter opens: "A popular if uninformed manner of speaking refers to the medieval period as "the dark ages." If there is a dark age in the literary history of Germany, however, it is the one that follows: the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, the time between the Middle High German ''Blütezeit'' and the full blossoming of the Renaissance. It may be called a dark age, not because literary production waned in these decades, but because nineteenth-century aesthetics and twentieth-century university curricula allowed the achievements of that time to fade into obscurity."&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern historians do not use the term "dark ages", preferring terms such as [[Early Middle Ages]].  But when used by some historians today, the term "Dark Ages" is meant to describe the economic, political, and cultural problems of the era.&lt;ref&gt;Review Article: Travel and Trade in the Dark Ages, Treadgold, Warren, Journal

Chew, Journal of Global Society,Volume 16, 2002 - Issue 4&lt;/ref&gt;  For others, the term Dark Ages is intended to be neutral, expressing the idea that the events of the period seem 'dark' to us because of the paucity of the [[Recorded history|historical record]].&lt;ref name=dmas/&gt; The term is used in this sense (often in the singular) to reference the [[Bronze Age collapse]] and the subsequent [[Greek Dark Ages]],&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; the [[dark ages of Cambodia]] (c. 1450-1863), and also a hypothetical [[Digital Dark Age]] which would ensue if the [[electronic document]]s produced in the current period were to become unreadable at some point in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/10/081027174646 'Digital Dark Age' May Doom Some Data], ''[[Science Daily]]'', October 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Byzantinist]]s have used the term "Byzantine Dark Ages" to refer to the period from the earliest [[Muslim conquests]] to about 800,&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Lemerle|Lemerle, Paul]] (1986). ''Byzantine Humanism'', translated by Helen Lindsay and Ann Moffat. Canberra, pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; because there are no extant historical texts in Greek from this period, and thus the history of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and its territories that were conquered by the Muslims is poorly understood and must be reconstructed from other contemporaneous sources, such as religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Whitby|Whitby, Michael]] (1992).

''Byzantine Humanism'', translated by Helen Lindsay and Ann Moffat. Canberra, p. 81-84.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "dark age" is not restricted to the discipline of history. Since the archaeological evidence for some periods is abundant and for others scanty, there are also archaeological dark ages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onderzoekinformatie.nl/en/oi/nod/onderzoek/OND1320349/ Project: Exploring the Early Holocene Occupation of North-Central Anatolia: New Approaches for Studying Archaeological Dark Ages] Period of Project: 09/2007-09/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Late Middle Ages]] significantly overlap with the [[Renaissance]], the term 'Dark Ages' has become restricted to distinct times and places in medieval Europe. Thus the 5th and 6th centuries in [[Britain in the Middle Ages|Britain]], at the height of the [[Saxon people|Saxon]] invasions, have been called "the darkest of the Dark Ages",&lt;ref&gt;[[John Cannon (historian)|Cannon, John]] and Griffiths, Ralph (2000). ''The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Monarchy (Oxford Illustrated Histories)'', 2nd Revised edition. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, p. 1. The first chapter opens with the sentence: "In the darkest of the Dark Ages, the fifth and sixth centuries, there were many kings in Britain but no kingdoms."&lt;/ref&gt; in view of the [[societal collapse]] of the period and the consequent lack of historical records. Further south and east, the same was true in the formerly Roman province of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]], where history after the Roman withdrawal went unrecorded for centuries as [[Slavs]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Bulgars]], and others struggled for supremacy in the [[Danube]] basin, and events there are still disputed. However, at this time the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Arab Empire]] is often considered to have experienced its [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age]] rather than Dark Age; consequently, usage of the term must also specify a geography. While [[Petrarch]]'s concept of a Dark Age corresponded to a mostly Christian period following pre-Christian Rome, today the term mainly applies to the cultures and periods in Europe that were least Christianized, and thus most sparsely covered by [[chronicle]]s and other contemporary sources, at the time mostly written by Catholic clergy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

However, from the later 20th century onwards, other historians became critical even of this nonjudgmental use of the term, for two main reasons.&lt;ref name=dmas/&gt; Firstly, it is questionable whether it is ever possible to use the term in a neutral way: scholars may intend this, but ordinary readers may not understand it so. Secondly, 20th-century scholarship had increased understanding of the history and culture of the period,&lt;ref&gt;Welch, Martin (1993). ''[http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/0-271-00894-6.html Discovering Anglo-Saxon England]''. University Park, PA: Penn State Press.&lt;/ref&gt; to such an extent that it is no longer really 'dark' to us.&lt;ref name=dmas/&gt; To avoid the value judgment implied by the expression, many historians now avoid it altogether.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/151663/Dark-Ages Encyclopædia Britannica] "It is now rarely used by historians because of the value judgment it implies. Though sometimes taken to derive its meaning from the fact that little was then known about the period, the term's more usual and pejorative sense is of a period of intellectual darkness and barbarity."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Fate of Rome: Climate, Disease, and the End of an Empire (The Princeton History of the Ancient World) |publisher=Princeton University Press |author=Kyle Harper |year=2017 |page=12 |quote=These used to be called the Dark Ages. That label is best set aside. It is hopelessly redolent of Renaissance and Enlightenment prejudices. It altogether underestimates the impressive cultural vitality and enduring spiritual legacy of the entire period that has come to be known as "late antiquity". At the same time we do not have to [[wikt:euphemize|euphemize]] the realities of imperial disintegration, economic collapse and societal disintegration.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern popular use==

Science historian [[David C. Lindberg]] criticised the public use of 'dark ages' to describe the entire Middle Ages as "a time of [[ignorance]], [[Barbarian|barbarism]] and [[superstition]]" for which "blame is most often laid at the feet of the [[Christian Church|Christian church]], which is alleged to have placed religious authority over personal experience and rational activity".&lt;ref&gt;David C. Lindberg, "The Medieval Church Encounters the Classical Tradition: Saint Augustine, Roger Bacon, and the Handmaiden Metaphor", in David C. Lindberg and Ronald L. Numbers, ed. ''When Science &amp; Christianity Meet'', (Chicago: University of Chicago Pr., 2003), p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Historian of science [[Edward Grant]] writes that "If revolutionary rational thoughts were expressed in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]], they were made possible because of the long medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities".&lt;ref&gt;Edward Grant. ''God and Reason in the Middle Ages'', Cambridge 2001, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Lindberg says that, contrary to common belief, "the late medieval scholar rarely experienced the coercive power of the church and would have regarded himself as free (particularly in the natural sciences) to follow reason and observation wherever they led".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in the essay of Ted Peters about Science and Religion at "Lindsay Jones (editor in chief). Encyclopedia of Religion, Second Edition. Thomson Gale. 2005. p.8182"&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] due to the [[Migration Period]] a lot of classical Greek texts were lost there, but part of these texts survived and they were studied widely in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. Around the eleventh and twelfth centuries in the [[High Middle Ages]] stronger monarchies emerged; borders were restored after the invasions of [[Vikings]] and [[Hungarians|Magyars]]; technological developments and agricultural innovations were made which increased the food supply and population. And the rejuvenation of science and scholarship in the West was due in large part to the new availability of Latin translations of [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, D. (1992) ''The Beginnings of Western Science''  Chicago. University of Chicago Press. p.204.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view of the period is reflected by more specific notions such as the 19th-century claim&lt;ref name=bunk&gt;Historian [[Jeffrey Burton Russell]], in his book ''[[Inventing the Flat Earth]]'' "... shows how nineteenth-century anti-Christians invented and spread the falsehood that educated people in the Middle Ages believed that the earth was flat" [http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/history/1997Russell.html Russell's summary of his book]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flat"&gt;{{Cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2932">'''Duplex perception''' refers to the [[natural language|linguistic]] phenomenon whereby "part of the [[sound|acoustic signal]] is used for both a [[Speech communication|speech]] and a nonspeech percept."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vorperian | first1 = H.

One ear receives an isolated third-[[formant]] transition that sounds like a nonspeech chirp. At the same time the other ear receives a base [[syllable]]. This base syllable consists of the first two [[formants]], complete with formant transitions, and the third formant without a transition. Normally, there would be peripheral [[Auditory masking|masking]] in such a [[Sound localization|binaural]] listening task but this does not occur. Instead, the listener's percept is duplex, that is, the completed syllable is perceived and the nonspeech chirp is heard at the same time. This is interpreted as  being due to the existence of a special speech module.

The phenomenon was discovered in 1974 by Timothy C. Rand at the [[Haskins Laboratories]] associated with [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6478">The '''Forest Grove Sound''' was an unexplained noise, described by ''[[The Oregonian]]'' as a "mechanical scream", heard in [[Forest Grove, Oregon]] in February 2016.

In February 2016, a high pitched noise was heard at night in [[Forest Grove, Oregon]].  The department of Forestry determined that their equipment was not the cause of the sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kgw.com/news/local/forest-grove-neighbors-mystified-by-annoying-noise/45296369|title=Forest Grove Neighbors Mystified by Annoying Noise|last=Cook|first=Katherine|date=25 February 2016|work=KGW|access-date=5 January 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The noise was first shared with Dave Nemeyer by a Forest Grove resident, who shared a video of it on the city's Facebook page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/mysterious-shrieking-sound-frustrates-oregon-community/story?id=36998846|title=Mysterious Shrieking Sound Frustrates Oregon Community|last=Pelletiere|first=Nicole|date=17 February 2016|work=ABC News|access-date=2 March 2016|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' described the noise as sounding like a "giant flute played off pitch," car brakes, or a [[steam whistle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/02/21/listen-to-the-mysterious-nocturnal-noise-baffling-experts-and-terrifying-an-oregon-community/?tid=sm_fb|title=Listen to the mysterious nocturnal noise baffling experts and terrifying an Oregon community|last=Holley|first=Peter|date=21 February 2016|work=The Washington Post|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC News described it as "akin to a bad one-note violin solo broadcast over a microphone with nonstop feedback."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/mystery-forest-grove-oregon-noise-may-never-be-solved-n579456|title=Mystery of Forest Grove, Oregon, Noise May Never Be Solved|last=Fieldstadt|first=Elisha|date=28 May 2016|work=[[NBC News]]|access-date=22 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was described by ''The Oregonian'' as sounding like a "mechanical scream," and reportedly lasts from ten seconds to several minutes.

Throughout February 2016, approximately 200 calls and were made to the Forest Grover Police Department, according to captain Mike Herb, who said that most of the calls were suggesting explanations for the sound, ranging from frogs to aliens to [[Bigfoot]]. In late February 2016, the Forest Grove police department announced via [[Facebook]] that the noise did not pose a safety hazard,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/forest-grove/index.ssf/2016/02/forest_grove_police_address_my.html|title=Forest Grove police address mystery noise on Facebook|last=Campuzano|first=Eder|date=24 February 2016|work=The Oregonian|access-date=2 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the police announced they were stopping their investigation until further information appeared. However, after February 2016, the noise was not heard. The final point was plotted on Dawes' map on February 27, 2016,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the police and fire departments closed the case. Dave Nemeyer, the Forest Grove Fire Marshal, suspected the noise to be "a faulty attic fan or heat pump."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/geek/2016/03/forest_groves_creepy_noise_aut.html|title=Forest Grove's creepy noise: Authorities close case; no J.J.

'''Fractionalism''' is the [[System of government|government system]] that is the closest to a [[confederation]] but differs when the [[market system]] is a central market owned mostly by the government and very little by the people, yet the people have more control over it than the control of the government. This is possible by the fact that in fractionalism, the central government, on the federal level, is made up of several levels to ensure the utmost security for the people's government.

The whole nation is broken down into several small city-states. The national government cannot intervene in any acts that the city-state chooses to enforce unless it could weaken the unity of the country as a whole. Other than that, the national government cannot intervene unless there is an almost guaranteed economic collapse in the city state, a widespread famine or biological plague, or other state of emergencies declared by that city state. However, in the case of war, the national military can inhabit any city state without the need to ask permission of any form of state or local government.

== Education ==
Morley studied French Literature at UC Berkeley and earned a doctorate degree in Art History from a fellowship with the University of Paris (1923), a D.Litt. doctoral degree from the [[Sorbonne University]] of Paris France in Art and Literature (1926), an honorary degree from [[Mills College]] (1937), and an honorary "Doctor of Humane Letters" degree from Smith in 1957.

== Career ==
Her first general curating position was at the [[Cincinnati Museum of Art]] in Ohio at 1930.

In her first years at [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] she organized three shows dedicated to Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, and Henri Matisse. By the 1940s and 50s she was holding 100 shows per year, many from the New York MoMA and Peggy Guggenheim’s gallery in Manhattan. She also established the first gallery tours for any museum in the West as well as art history courses, a public art library, an art rental gallery, the first film program at an American museum, "Art in Cinema", and the television series, "Art in Your Life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Grace McCann Morley|agency=San Francisco Chronicle|date=January 10, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Time Magazine carried an article in her twentieth year with the museum,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,861242,00.html|title=Art: Twenty Years of Grace|last=|first=|date=1955-02-28|work=Time|access-date=|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then another article on her resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,868592,00.html|title=Art: 23 Years of Grace|last=|first=|date=1958-07-14|work=Time|access-date=|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During these years, she was active in the art world in the US. She was Second Vice-President, [[American Federation of Arts]], 1939; Counsellor for Arts at the [[Bureau of Inter-American Affairs]], 1941; a Member of the Committee of the Fine Arts Buildings of the [[Golden Gate International Exposition]] in San Francisco and Director of Pacific House 1940, a Member of the Committee of Experts on the Arts, State Department, 1940-1945. Between 1946-1949, she took leave from the [[San Francisco Museum of Art]], and became Consultant for Museums at [[UNESCO]] Preparatory Commission, and then as the Head of its Museums Division.

She was active in the [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM), and was the Head of the ICOM Regional Agency for South and South-East Asia from 1967 to 1978.

She authored a number of articles on Contemporary Art, and on Latin American Civilizations, and was the subject of a book edited by Dipa Chaudhuri.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=UDRzXz6r3AoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=grace+morley&amp;ots=X5oyOCXdAj&amp;sig=Pi9jkIzKK4BXxzvawu2wSPaMW4g#v=onepage&amp;q=grace%20morley&amp;f=false|title=Indian Sculpture|last=Morley|first=Grace|date=2005|publisher=Roli Books Private Limited|isbn=9788174363527|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She moved to India in 1960, and remained there until her death in 1985. She was the Founder Director of the [[National Museum, New Delhi|National Museum]] in New Delhi and was awarded the [[Padma Bhushan]] by the Indian government.

== Personal life ==
Morley did not attend school until she was about 10 years old. She excelled in school and was an exceptional student. Her high school, St. Helena High School, did not offer French classes, therefore, she decided to teach herself French. In 1923, she wrote her master’s thesis at UC Berkeley in French on the poetics of Aristotle.

Morley started her career in Cincinnati in 1930, but is best remembered for her years in San Francisco and her second career in India. She formed some passionate friendships with women during this time. From 1946 to 1949, Morley worked for UNESCO in Germany as a consultant with French, American, and British authorities. She helped with theft and the return of multiple artworks. In 1949, she returned to San Francisco as a popular art star. Due to her fame and travels to Brazil, Chile, and Greece, the San Francisco Museum of Art became very well known across the world. However, in 1958, she decided to leave San Francisco along with her ties to the museum due to disagreements with the board of directors. "After being forced to leave S.F. in 1958, she cut off ties with most of her friends and colleagues in the Bay Area, which is one reason her memory has been somewhat buried," Morley scholar Kristy Phillips wrote in a 2006 e-mail on ArtsJournal.com. "She felt betrayed here by the museum and its trustees and at one point declared that she wanted to forget S.F. completely." In 1959, she served as the assistant director of the Guggenheim Museum before she decided to move to India in 1960.

In India, under the supervision of Prime Minister Jawawarlal Nehru she opened the country's first major art museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Grace-Morley-forgotten-pioneer-behind-SFMOMA-3204269.php|title=Grace Morley - forgotten pioneer behind SFMOMA|website=SFGate|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was awarded the Padma Bhush award, which is given to civilians who have contributed greatly in a specific line of work that is valued in India. In her case, it was due to her knowledge in art history and expertise on museums.

For the last twenty years of her life, she shared an apartment with a retired Indian Air Force officer and his wife, who became her Indian family, and it was there she died at the age of 84. They believe she had converted to [[Buddhism]] at some point in time. Morley's body was cremated in the Indian tradition, and her ashes immersed in a holy river.

== Memorials ==
Research fellowships in her honor are awarded by [[International Council of Museums|ICOM]] India Trust each year.&lt;ref&gt;http://icom.museum/ICOM2007/gracemorley2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art has established the Grace McCann Morley Legacy Society for donors who provide for the museum in their estate plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607071037/http://www.sfmoma.org/membership/giving_lasting_legacy.html|title=SFMOMA {{!}} Membership {{!}} Estate + Planned Gifts: A Lasting Legacy|last=|first=|date=2007-06-07|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, the National Museum Institute holds an annual Dr Grace Morley Memorial Seminar.

Berit Potter, Visiting Faculty of History and Theory of Contemporary Art at SFAI, is writing a book about Morley’s impact on the development of modern art in California and role as an early advocate for global perspectives in the study of contemporary art called ''Grace McCann Morley and the Origins of Global Contemporary Art''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usfca.edu/faculty/berit-potter|title=Berit Potter|last=Anonymous|date=2015-07-06|work=University of San Francisco|access-date=2017-03-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfai.edu/bios/berit-potter1|title=SFAI|website=www.sfai.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology''' is [[Brown University]]'s teaching [[museum]].  The museum has a {{convert|2000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} gallery in Manning Hall on the university campus in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. Its Collections Research Center is located in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]].

== Mission ==
The Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology is Brown University’s teaching museum.  A resource across the university, it aims to inspire creative and critical thinking about culture by fostering interdisciplinary understanding of the material world. It provides opportunities for faculty and students to work with collections and the public, teaching through objects and programs in classrooms, in the CultureLab and exhibitions in Manning Hall, and at the Collections Research Center.

== Exhibitions ==
Changing exhibitions in the museum’s gallery in [https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=M0080 Manning Hall], at the center of Brown University's campus, highlight the museum's collections from around the world and the work of Brown University faculty, staff and students. The museum also offers public lectures, performances, symposia, festivals, school activities, and a broad range of programs and events for all ages.

== Educational programs==
In addition to extensive educational programs for Brown students, centered in the CultureLab in the Manning Gallery, the Museum provides structured group programs delivered to local schools and an extensive array of public lectures.

== Artifact collections ==
The Museum's holdings total approximately one million items. While strongest in Native North American materials, the museum also contains significant material from Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, including:
* 900,000 archeological artifacts excavated by Arctic researchers from National Park Service and Bureau of Land Management lands in Alaska (a federal repository)
* 70,000 archeological and 6,000 ethnological objects from elsewhere in North America
* 2,500 archeological and 3,000 ethnological items from South and Central America
* 40 archeological and 3,000 ethnological items from Africa, some by contemporary artisans
* 400 archeological and 400 ethnological items from Europe
* 1,100 ethnological items from Asia
* 1,500 ethnological items from Oceania.

== Image collections ==
The Haffenreffer Museum Research Collections Center's photographic archive, in addition to collection record shots, contains photographs from the founder's archives, the Spinden collection of images of Central and South America, and field photographs that accompanied collections. The Center library has some 10,000 volumes. Highlights of the collection include:
* Herbert Spinden Photographic Archive, with over 20,000 images and documents related to Central American archaeology and ethnography from the early 20th century, including many images of important archaeological sites that have since been altered or destroyed.
* The Kensinger Collection has over 5000 photographs and related field notes and texts from Anthropologist Ken Kensinger’s research with the Cashinahua of Peru from 1960 - 1996
* The Conti Collection has over 3000 photographs dating from the late 1950s through to the early 1970s taken by Rhode Island photographer Gino Conti, primarily on the Hopi, Apache and Navaho reservations and in Mexico.
* Photographs of Southwest prehistoric petroglyphs taken by Salvatore Mancini, many of which are published by the Museum in the book Terra Incognita.
* Lithographs, serigraphs and two dimensional artwork by and about the Inuit, the Ainu, Plains Indians and many others.

== History ==
The Museum originated with the private collection of Rudolf F. Haffenreffer, who founded the King Philip Museum in the early 20th century on the Mount Hope Grant in Bristol RI, the former headquarters of Metacom, or King Philip, a 17th-century Wampanoag sachem. The Museum became part of Brown University in 1955 and opened its gallery on the Brown campus in 2006.

'''''Handbook of Latin American Studies''''' is an annotated guide to publications in Latin American studies by topic and region, published since 1936. Its editorial offices are in the Hispanic Division of the [[Library of Congress]]. According to a Seminar on the Acquisition of Latin American Studies Materials (SALALM) report, “The Handbook of Latin American Studies is the oldest and most prestigious area studies bibliography in the world.”&lt;ref&gt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/hlas/salalm.html accessed 13 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It now publishes in both print and digital format.

The ''Handbook of Latin American Studies'' (HLAS), a multidisciplinary bibliographic project, grew out of a 1935 meeting held at the [[Social Science Research Council]] offices in New York City.  The [[American Council of Learned Societies]] provided the initial funding for the project via its Advisory Committee on Latin American Studies.  [[Lewis Hanke]], Director of the Hispanic Division of the Library of Congress, became its first editor.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Delpar, ''Looking South: The Evolution of Latin Americanist Scholarship in the United States, 1850-1975''. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press 2008, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Clarence H. Haring]] of the History Department, Harvard University chaired the committee that led to the project.&lt;ref&gt;Clarence H. Haring, “The ''Handbook of Latin American Studies'', reprinted in ''Latin American History: Essays on Its Study and Teaching, 1898-1965'' 2 vols. Austin:  University of Texas Press 1965, vol. 1, pp.251-52.&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for the project initially was provided by the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], and the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]].&lt;ref&gt;Delpar, ''Looking South'', pp. 114-15&lt;/ref&gt;

The bibliography of the Handbook is selective, not comprehensive, with annotated entries on the most important publications on the particular topic. Each field has an introductory overview of trends by a contributing editor.&lt;ref&gt;Charmino Shelby, “The ''Handbook of Latin American Studies'': Its First Fifteen Years.” Reprinted In ''Latin American  History: Essays on Its Study and Teaching'', vol. 1, pp. 252-256.&lt;/ref&gt;  The specialists who serve as contributing editors play an important role in shaping the field. “Every evaluation that a Contributing Editor makes may have far-reaching consequences for the future of a publication," with the inclusion or exclusion of a publication and the phrasing of the annotation influencing scholars and librarians.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan A. Haverstock, “Handbook of Latin American Studies’’, Nos. 1-21.” Reprinted in ''Latin American History: Essays on Its Study and Teaching'', vol. 1, pp. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of sections on Brazil reflects the increased awareness in the U.S. of its importance.&lt;ref&gt;Delpar, ''Looking South'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the tenure of Hispanic Foundation Director [[Howard F. Cline]] (1952–71), HLAS expanded the number of topics, with volumes alternating by year between humanities and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/hlas/salalm.html accessed 13 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Ending a period of uncertainty in its funding, the Library of Congress assumed the responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Delpar, ''Looking South'', p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Since volume 50, HLAS has been published in digital format, with the Library of Congress hosting HLAS Online.  Hispanic Division Director Dr. Georgette Dorn began the project of digitizing earlier print volumes of HLAS.  Publications considered for inclusion are monographs, journal articles, book chapters, conference papers, websites, and maps written in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, or Russian.&lt;ref&gt;http://salalm.org/Conf/2016/04/panel-11-the-hispanic-division-and-the-handbook-of-latin-american-studies-highlighting-luso-hispanic-collections-in-the-library-of-congress/ accessed 13 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prior to 1950==

[[Two-spirit]] is a modern [[umbrella term]] used by some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous North Americans]] for [[Gender variance|Gender variant]] individuals in their communities. The presence of male two-spirits existed before European contact, and "was a fundamental institution among most tribal peoples".&lt;ref&gt;Gilley, Brian Joseph (2006: 8). ''Becoming Two-Spirit: Gay Identity and Social Acceptance in Indian Country''. {{ISBN|0-8032-7126-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Will Roscoe, male and female two-spirits have been "documented in over 130 North America tribes, in every region of the continent".&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe, Will (1991). ''The Zuni Man-Woman,'' p.5. {{ISBN|0-8263-1253-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Two-spirits might have relationships with people of either sex.&lt;ref name=glbtq&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/berdache.html |title=Berdache |work=[[glbtq.com]] |first=Susan |last=Stryker |year=2004 |accessdate=2007-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703030150/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/berdache.html |archivedate=2007-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lang, female assigned at birth two-spirits usually have sexual relations or marriages with only females.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, S. (1998), pp. 289–298.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in most tribes a relationship between a two-spirit and non-two-spirit was seen for the most part as neither [[heterosexual]] nor [[homosexual]] (in modern-day terms) but more hetero-normative; Partners of two-spirits have not historically viewed themselves as homosexual, and moreover drew a sharp conceptual line between themselves and two-spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, S. (1998), pp. 208-212.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were few openly gay European men in America at this time, due to legal consequences as well as social ostracism. Anal sex was specifically prohibited by a statute passed in 1563 during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, and the English colonies in America were subject to this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.newsobserver.com/under_the_dome/n_c_sodomy_law_dates_to_henry_viii |title=N.C. sodomy law dates to Henry VIII &amp;#124; newsobserver.com projects |publisher=Projects.newsobserver.com |date=2008-05-27 |accessdate=2012-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1814 [[crime against nature]] has been used as a legal term in published cases in the [[United States]], normally defined as a form of [[human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]] that is not considered natural and is seen as a punishable [[offence (law)|offense]] in dozens of countries and several [[U.S. state]]s; this often included homosexual sex. Other sexual practices that have historically been considered to be crimes against nature include [[anal sex]], as well as [[fellatio]], [[Zoophilia|bestiality]], [[incest]], [[miscegenation]] and [[necrophilia]]. The term is sometimes also seen as a [[synonym]] for [[sodomy]] or [[buggery]].&lt;ref&gt;See Rose v. Locke, 1975, 96 S.Ct. 243, 423 U.S. 48, 46 L.Ed.2d 185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Andrews v. Vanduzer, [[Supreme Court of New York|N.Y.Sup.]] 1814 (January Term, 1814) (Vanduzer accused Andrews of having had connection with a cow and then a mare and the court understood this to mean that Vanduzer was going around telling others that Andrews had been guilty of the crime against nature with a beast.)&lt;/ref&gt; Legal punishments for sodomy often included lengthy prison sentences, fines, and hard labor.&lt;ref name="equalitymatters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://equalitymatters.org/blog/201108080012|title=State Sodomy Laws Continue To Target LGBT Americans|publisher=www.equalitymatters.org|date=August 8, 2011 |accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first recorded police raid in American history on a [[gay bathhouse]] took place in [[New York City]] on February 21, 1903, when [[New York City Police Department|New York police]] raided the Ariston Hotel Baths. 26 men were arrested and 12 brought to trial on sodomy charges; 7 men received sentences ranging from 4 to 20 years in prison.&lt;ref name=Chauncey&gt;(Chauncey, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; After all, police raids on gay hangouts and other examples of formal and/or informal harassment were common practice prior during the first half of the 20th century.

[[File:Walt Whitman 1854.jpg|thumb|Walt Whitman 1854]]

Nevertheless, there were some gay men who had an important impact on American history at this time, particularly literature. [[Walt Whitman]], a prominent and influential American poet, is widely believed to have been gay or bisexual.&lt;ref name="eriegaynews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eriegaynews.com/news/article.php?recordid=200910whitmandoyle |title=Gay History Project: Walt Whitman and Peter Doyle |publisher=Eriegaynews.com |date=2009-10-01 |accessdate=2012-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860 he published ''[[Calamus (poems)|Calamus]],'' a series of homoerotic poems, for which he was fired from his job at the Department of the Interior, though he quickly obtained a similar job in the Attorney General's office.&lt;ref name="eriegaynews1"/&gt; Another important homoerotic book was published in 1870 by the American author [[Bayard Taylor]], titled ''[[Joseph and His Friend: A Story of Pennsylvania]].''&lt;ref&gt;Whitcomb, Selden L. and Matthews, Brander, ''Chronological Outlines of American Literature'', Norwood Press, 1893, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; This book has been deemed the 'first [[gay novel]]' in America.&lt;ref&gt;Austen, Roger, ''Playing the Game: The Homosexual Novel in America'', Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1977, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been noted for its enigmatic treatment of homosexuality. Roger Austen notes "In the nineteenth century [[Bayard Taylor]] had written that the reader who did not feel 'cryptic forces' at play in ''[[Joseph and His Friend: A Story of Pennsylvania]]'' would hardly be interested in the external movement of his novel."&lt;ref&gt;Austen, Roger, ''Playing the Game: The Homosexual Novel in America'', Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1977, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Another such work is ''[[Imre: A Memorandum]]'', written in Europe by the expatriate American-born author, [[Edward Irenaeus Prime-Stevenson]], who originally published it under the pseudonym of Xavier Mayne in a limited-edition imprint of 500 copies in Naples, Italy, in 1906. ''[[Imre: A Memorandum]]'' is the first American gay novel with a happy ending.

The first recognized gay rights organization in America, the [[Society for Human Rights]], was founded by [[Henry Gerber]] in [[Chicago]] in 1924. It only existed for a few months before disbanding due to the arrests of several of the Society's members. Still, it was officially recognized due to having received a charter from the state of [[Illinois]], and produced the first American publication for gays, ''Friendship and Freedom''.

The gay male community gained more visibility in 1948 with the publication of ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]'', by [[Alfred Kinsey]], a sexologist who was himself bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Baumgardner, Jennifer|title=Look Both Ways: Bisexual Politics|origyear=2008|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux; Reprint edition|location=New York, New York|isbn= 978-0-374-53108-9 |page=48|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book states, among other things, that 37% of the male subjects surveyed had at least one homosexual experience,&lt;ref&gt;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, p. 656&lt;/ref&gt; and that 10% of American males surveyed were "more or less exclusively homosexual for at least three years between the ages of 16 and 55".&lt;ref&gt;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, p. 651&lt;/ref&gt;

==1950s==

In 1950, gay activist [[Harry Hay]] and several other men founded the [[Mattachine Society]], the first enduring LGBT rights organization in the United States. The [[Mattachine Society]] was involved in two landmark gay rights cases in the 1950s. In the spring of 1952, [[William Dale Jennings]], one of the cofounders of the Mattachine Society, was arrested in Los Angeles for allegedly soliciting a police officer in a bathroom in Westlake Park, now known as [[MacArthur Park]]. His trial drew national attention to the [[Mattachine Society]], and membership increased dramatically after Jennings contested the charges, resulting in a hung jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Vern L. Bullough, RN|title=Before Stonewall, Activists for Gay and Lesbian Rights in Historical Context|origyear=2002|publisher=Harrington Park Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-56023-192-9|page=424|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of [[ONE, Inc.]], a spinoff of the Mattachine Society, which had published "ONE: The Homosexual Magazine" beginning in 1953. After a campaign of harassment from the [[United States Post Office Department|U.S. Post Office Department]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the [[Postmaster]] of [[Los Angeles]] declared the October, 1954 issue obscene and therefore unmailable under the [[Comstock laws]].&lt;ref name="MurdochPrice2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murdoch|first1=Joyce|last2=Price|first2=Deb|title=Courting justice: gay men and lesbians v. the Supreme Court|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mH5mzdA1gtMC|accessdate=9 October 2011|date=8 May 2002|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-01514-6|pages=27–50|chapter=ONE Standard of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The magazine sued. The Supreme Court reversed the Postmaster's decision, marking the first time the Supreme Court had explicitly ruled on free press rights around homosexuality. The case is known as ''[[One, Inc. v. Olesen]]''.

However, because the psychiatric community regarded homosexuality as a [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] during the 1950s, gay people were considered susceptible to [[blackmail]], thus constituting a security risk. U.S. government officials assumed that [[Communism|communist]]s would blackmail gay employees of the federal government who would provide them classified information rather than risk exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Gay Today |url=http://gaytoday.com/interview/010104in.asp |title=Historian David K.

The [[Cooper Do-nuts Riot]] was a May 1959 incident in Los Angeles, in which gay men, lesbians, transgender women, and drag queens rioted, one of the first [[LGBT]] uprisings in the US.&lt;ref name="Out"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moffitt|first1=Evan|title=10 Years Before Stonewall, There Was the Cooper's Donuts Riot|url=https://www.out.com/today-gay-history/2015/5/31/today-gay-history-10-years-stonewall-there-was-coopers-donuts-riot|accessdate=30 June 2017|work=Out Magazine|agency=Here Media Inc.|date=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was sparked by police harassment of LGBT people at a 24-hour cafe called "Cooper Do-nuts".

==1960s==

[[File:James Baldwin Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|right|[[James Baldwin]], a popular writer of the 1950s and 1960s wrote about homosexuality in his novel ''Giovanni's Room''|200px]]
As of 1960, every state had an anti-sodomy law.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/26/politics/26WIRE-SODO.html Supreme Court Strikes Down Texas Law Banning Sodomy," June 26, 2003], accessed July 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, the American Law Institute's [[Model Penal Code]] advocated repealing sodomy laws as they applied to private, adult, consensual behavior.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Illinois in 1961 became the first state to repeal its sodomy law. Laws of Illinois 1961, page 1983, enacted July 28, 1961, effective January 1, 1962. [http://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/sensibilities/illinois.htm#fn74 The History of Sodomy Laws in the United States: Illinois].&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) took its first major case in opposition to these laws, [[Enslin v. Walford]], which was denied certiorari by the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/lgbt/gen/24578res20060316.html |title=Aclu.org |publisher=Aclu.org |date=March 26, 2006 |accessdate=May 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018055939/http://www.aclu.org/lgbt/gen/24578res20060316.html |archivedate=October 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant case came in 1961, when astronomer [[Frank Kameny]] protested his firing by the [[U.S. Civil Service Commission]] due to his homosexuality, arguing this case to the [[United States Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="usatodaylandmark"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2009-02-27-gay-rights-home_N.htm |title=Gay rights epicenter named landmark |publisher=USA Today |date=2009-02-27 |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the court denied his petition, it is notable as the first civil rights claim based on [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2009312960_apuscapitalpride.html |title=DC pride festival honors gay rights pioneer Kameny |last=Gaynair |first=Gillian |date=06-08-2009 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=2009-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019000306/http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2009312960_apuscapitalpride.html |archivedate=October 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kameny and fellow gay activist [[Jack Nichols (activist)|Jack Nichols]] also launched some of the [[List of pre-Stonewall LGBT actions in the United States|earliest public protests by gays and lesbians]] with a picket line at the White House on April 17, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gay Civil Rights Movement Turns to Public Picketing |url=http://www.rainbowhistory.org/Pickets.htm |publisher=The Rainbow History Project |accessdate=9 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517153305/http://www.rainbowhistory.org/Pickets.htm |archivedate=May 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In coalition with New York's Mattachine Society and the [[Daughters of Bilitis]], the picketing expanded to target the [[United Nations]], the [[Pentagon (building)|Pentagon]], the [[United States Civil Service Commission]], and to [[Philadelphia]]'s [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]] for what became known as the [[Annual Reminder]] for gay rights.

In 1964, organized by gay activist [[Randy Wicker]], a small group picketed the Whitehall Street Induction Center after the confidentiality of gay men's [[Selective Service System|draft]] records was violated. This action has been identified as the first gay rights demonstration in the United States.&lt;ref name = campbell&gt;Campbell, J. Louis (2007). ''[[Jack Nichols (activist)|Jack Nichols]], Gay Pioneer: "Have You Heard My Message?"''. Haworth Press. {{ISBN|1-56023-653-1}}., p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 the case ''[[Scott v. Macy]]'', about how Bruce Scott was denied a Defense Department job because of "immoral conduct", was decided. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the charge was too vague, thus granting the first major court victory for gay employment rights. The case was argued by lawyer [[David Carliner]] December 17, 1964 and decided June 16, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/books/2015/06/04/excerpt-how-barbara-gittings-became-mother-movement|title=Excerpt: How Barbara Gittings Became the Mother of the Movement|date=4 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ChristopherAndGayStreets9.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The [[Oscar Wilde Bookshop|Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop]], pictured in 2007, was founded by [[Craig Rodwell]] in 1967.]]

[[Craig Rodwell]], who had conceived of the [[Annual Reminder]] (which was led by [[Frank Kameny]] and [[Barbara Gittings]]) went on to begin the pro-gay group [[Homophile Youth Movement in Neighborhoods]] (HYMN) in 1967. He also published its periodical, ''[[HYMNAL]]''. On November 24, 1967, he founded the [[Oscar Wilde Bookshop|Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop]] in New York, the first bookstore devoted to gay and lesbian authors.&lt;ref name="Rodwell papers"&gt;[http://www.nypl.org/archives/1839 Craig Rodwell Papers, 1940-1993], [[New York Public Library]] (1999). Retrieved on July 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, pg. 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marotta, pg. 65"&gt;Marotta, pg. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Considering this and his work as the prime mover for the creation of the original [[pride parade]] (see below), Rodwell is considered by some to be quite possibly ''the'' leading [[gay rights]] activist in the early [[homophile]] movement of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Stores, pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important gay rights activist of the 1960s was [[Troy Perry]]. In 1968, after a [[suicide]] attempt following a failed love affair and witnessing a close friend being arrested by the police at the [[Black Cat Tavern]] (see below), Perry founded the [[Metropolitan Community Church]]. He put an advertisement in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]],'' announcing a worship service designed for gays in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Twelve people turned up on October 6, 1968 for the first service, and "Nine were my friends who came to console me and to laugh, and three came as a result of the ad."&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, p. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt; After six weeks of services in his living room, the congregation shifted to a woman's club, an auditorium, a church, and finally to a theater that could hold 600 within several months. In 1971, the [[Metropolitan Community Church]]'s own building was dedicated with over a thousand members in attendance.

There were also several protests of legal restrictions on gay bars in the 1960s. In 1966 the [[Mattachine Society]] staged a "Sip-In" at [[Julius (New York City)|Julius Bar]] in New York City challenging a New York State Liquor Authority prohibition on serving alcohol to gays.  The bartender initially started preparing the men a drink but then put his hand over the glass, which was photographed. The ''New York Times'' ran a headline the next day saying "3 Deviates Invite Exclusion by Bars". The Mattachines then challenged the liquor rule in court and the courts ruled that gays had a right to peacefully assemble, which undercut the previous state liquor authority contention that the presence of gay clientele automatically was grounds for charges of operating a "disorderly" premises.  With this right a new era of licensed, legally operating gay bars began. [[Julius (New York City)|Julius Bar]] now holds a monthly party called [[Mattachine]] in remembrance of the protest. On January 1, 1967, there was a police raid on the Los Angeles gay bar [[Black Cat Tavern]] which led to months of protests and demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camprehoboth.com/issue09_14_07/past_out.htm |title=Camprehoboth article |publisher= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518032727/http://www.camprehoboth.com/issue09_14_07/past_out.htm |archivedate=May 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by this, ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' was first published in September of that year as a local newsletter alerting gay men to police raids in Los Angeles gay bars.

[[Craig Rodwell]] and his partner Fred Sargeant, [[Michael Brown (UK politician)|Michael Brown]], [[Marty Nixon]], [[Foster Gunnison]] of [[Mattachine]], and Ellen Broidy made up the core group of the [[CSLD Umbrella Committee]] (CSLDUC). For initial funding, Gunnison served as treasurer and sought donations from the national homophile organizations and sponsors, while Sargeant solicited donations via the [[Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop]] customer mailing list and Nixon worked to gain financial support from GLF in his position as treasurer for that organization.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teal, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; Other mainstays of the organizing committee were Jack Waluska, Steve Gerrie, Judy Miller, and [[Brenda Howard]] of GLF.&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that more people would turn out for the march on a Sunday, and so as to mark the date of the start of the Stonewall uprising, the CSLDUC scheduled the date for the first march for Sunday, June 28, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable gay writers of the 1950s and 1960s who explored male homosexuality in their work included [[James Baldwin]], [[John Rechy]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]]. Another 20th-century writer, [[Gore Vidal]],  had a lifelong male partner but preferred not to categorize himself as gay.  Vidal wrote about homosexuality in  [[The City and the Pillar]] (1948) and transgenderism in [[Myra Breckinridge]](1969). [[Mart Crowley]]'s play [[The Boys in the Band (play)|Boys in the Band]], about a group of gay male friends,  was produced in 1968, then made into a [[The Boys in the Band (film)|groundbreaking film]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Canby,  'Boys in the Band':Crowley Study of Male Homosexuality Opens,  New York Times,  March 18, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Along with a liberalization of censorship laws, the 1950s and 1960s also saw the rise of [[Gay pulp fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;Bronski, Michael, ed.

Yet as the original marchers left Christopher Street to walk uptown, hundreds, and then thousands, of supporters joined in. The crowd marched from Greenwich Village into uptown Manhattan and Central Park, holding gay pride signs and banners, chanting "Say it clear, say it loud. Gay is good, gay is proud." &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

On the same weekend gay activist groups on the West Coast of the United States held a march in [[Los Angeles]] and a march and 'Gay-in' in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name="SFChron"&gt;"The San Francisco Chronicle", June 29, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CanPress"&gt;"As of early 1970, Neil Briggs became the vice-chairman of the LGBTQ Association", CanPress, February 28, 1970.

One day earlier, on Saturday, 27 June 1970, Chicago Gay Liberation organized a march &lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"&gt;"Chicago Tribune", June 28, 1970, p. A3&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Washington Square Park, Chicago|Washington Square Park]] ("Bughouse Square") to the [[Chicago Water Tower|Water Tower]] at the intersection of [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan]] and [[Chicago Avenue|Chicago]] avenues, which was the route originally planned, and then many of the participants extemporaneously marched on to the [[Richard J. Daley Center#Daley Plaza|Civic Center (now Richard J. Daley) Plaza]].&lt;ref name="CGP1971w"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newberry.org/outspoken/exhibit/objectlist_section3.html |title= Outspoken: Chicago's Free Speech Tradition |publisher= Newberry Library |accessdate=2008-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The date was chosen because the Stonewall events began on the last Saturday of June and because organizers wanted to reach the maximum number of Michigan Avenue shoppers. Subsequent Chicago parades have been held on the last Sunday of June, coinciding with the date of many similar parades elsewhere.

On May 18, 1970, two [[University of Minnesota]] gay student activists, [[Jack Baker (activist)|Richard Baker]] and [[James Michael McConnell]], applied for a marriage license in [[Minneapolis]]. The clerk of the [[Hennepin County Government Center|Hennepin County District Court]], Gerald Nelson, denied the request on the sole ground that the two were of the same sex. The couple filed suit in district court to force Nelson to issue the license.&lt;ref&gt;Appellant's Jurisdictional Statement, ''Baker v. Nelson,'' Supreme Court docket no. 71-1027, at 3-4 (statement of the case); ''Court Won't Let Men Wed,'' N.Y. Times, January 10, 1971 at 65.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple first contended that Minnesota's marriage statutes contained no explicit requirement that applicants be of different sexes. If the court were to construe the statutes to require different-sex couples, however, Baker claimed such a reading would violate several provisions of the U.S. Constitution:&lt;ref&gt;Appellant's Jurisdictional Statement, ''Baker v. Nelson'' at 6 (how the federal questions were raised); ''Baker v. Nelson,'' 191 N.W.2d 185, 185-86 (Minn. 1971); ''The Legality of Homosexual Marriage,'' 82 Yale L.J. 573, 573-74 (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] (cruel and unusual punishment),
* [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] (unenumerated right to privacy), and
* [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] (fundamental right to marry under the Due Process Clause and sex discrimination contrary to the Equal Protection Clause).

The trial court dismissed the couple's claims and ordered the clerk not to issue the license.&lt;ref&gt;''Baker,'' 191 N.W.2d at 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually this case reached the Minnesota Supreme Court in ''[[Baker v. Nelson]]'', 291 [[Minnesota Supreme Court|Minn.]] 310, 191 N.W.2d 185 (1971), in which the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that a state law limiting marriage to persons of the opposite sex did not violate the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]]. Baker appealed, and on October 10, 1972, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] dismissed the appeal "for want of a substantial federal question".&lt;ref&gt;409 U.S. 810 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; Because the case came to the Supreme Court through mandatory appellate review (not ''[[certiorari]]''), the dismissal constituted a decision on the merits and established ''Baker v. Nelson'' as [[precedent]],&lt;ref&gt;Project, ''Developments in the Law: The Constitution and the Family,'' 93 Harv. L.

The Rev. William R. Johnson was an important gay religious figure in the 1970s. In 1972 the [[United Church of Christ]] ordained him at the Community United Church of Christ in San Carlos, California, making him the first openly gay person to be ordained as a minister in a mainline Protestant denomination.&lt;ref name=ucc.org&gt;{{cite web|title=UCC 'Firsts'| url = http://www.ucc.org/about-us/old-firsts.html| accessdate = 5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lgbtran.org&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Religious Archives Network, Profile, William R.

The reaction by the city and media following the attack was indifferent. Those seeking burial services for the dead were turned away by many churches, and several families refused to come forward to claim victims' bodies out of shame. While most news outlets ignored the story, mentions of the incident in editorials and [[talk radio]] made light of the tragedy, mocking the victims because of their sexual orientation.

A significant action of the gay rights movement in the 1970s was the creation of the [[Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|Gay Pride flag]] by gay activist [[Gilbert Baker (artist)|Gilbert Baker]]. Thirty volunteers had helped Baker hand-dye and stitch the first two flags for the parade.&lt;ref name = witt&gt;Witt, Lynn, Sherry Thomas &amp; Eric Marcus (1995).

* [[Hot pink|Hot Pink]]: ''sexuality''
* [[Red]]: ''life''

* [[Green]]: ''nature''

First appearing around 1971 in San Francisco, visual [[code (semiotics)|codes]] signifying availability and preferences during [[cruising for sex|cruising]] activities started to spread within the gay subculture in the 1970s, expanding on the existing [[handkerchief code#Origin|handkerchief code]] by assigning meanings to more colors beyond the traditional red and blue.&lt;ref name="gay-semiotics"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fischer |first=Hal |date=1977 |title=Gay Semiotics ♂ |url=http://www.queerculturalcenter.org/Pages/HalPages/GaySempg2.html |location=San Francisco |publisher=NFS Press |isbn=0-917986-03-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further codes included [[keychain]]s openly worn on a belt loop as well as [[earring]]s.&lt;ref name="gay-semiotics" /&gt;

The organization works to end discrimination based on [[sexual orientation]], [[HIV]] status, and gender identity and expression. An early victory came in ''[[Fricke v. Lynch]]'' (1980), in which GLAD represented [[Aaron Fricke]], an 18-year-old student at [[Cumberland High School (Rhode Island)|Cumberland High School]] in Rhode Island, who won the right to bring a same-sex date to a high school dance. GLAD is based in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], and serves the [[New England]] area of the United States. Services it provides include litigation, advocacy, and educational work in all areas of LGBT (lesbian, gay,  bisexual, transgender) civil rights and the rights of people living with HIV. The organization also operates a telephone hotline and website.

Before March 2013, the name "GLAAD" had been an acronym for "Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation," but became the primary name due to its inclusiveness of [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] and [[transgender]] issues.&lt;ref name="Peeples"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jase|last=Peeples|title=GLAAD Affirms Commitment To Trans and Bi People, Alters Name |publisher=''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''|date=March 24, 2013|accessdate=March 25, 2013|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/2013/03/24/glaad-affirms-commitment-trans-and-bi-people-alters-name}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its stated mission, in part, is to "[amplify] the voice of the LGBT community by empowering real people to share their stories, holding the media accountable for the words and images they present, and helping grassroots organizations communicate effectively".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glaad.org/mission |title=Mission Statement |publisher=GLAAD |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formed in [[New York City]] in 1985 to protest against what it saw as the ''[[New York Post]]'''s defamatory and sensationalized [[AIDS]] coverage, GLAAD put pressure on media organizations to end what it saw as [[homophobic]] reporting.  Initial meetings were held in the homes of several New York City activists as well as after-hours at the [[New York State Council on the Arts]].

In 1987, after a meeting with GLAAD, ''[[The New York Times]]'' changed its editorial policy to use the word ''gay'' instead of harsher terms referring to homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.claynewsnetwork.com/2009/03/26/glaad-for-clay-aiken/ |title=GLAAD for Clay Aiken |publisher=Claynewsnetwork.com |accessdate=2013-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528101434/http://claynewsnetwork.com/2009/03/26/glaad-for-clay-aiken/ |archivedate=2013-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; GLAAD advocated that the ''[[Associated Press]]'' and other television and print news sources follow. GLAAD's influence soon spread to [[Los Angeles]], where organizers began working with the entertainment industry to change the way LGBT people were portrayed on screen.
''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' has named GLAAD as one of Hollywood's most powerful entities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amiannoying.com/%28S%28w3qmj555gowyo22cuk3dlbvf%29%29/collection.aspx?collection=366 |title=Entertainment Weekly's 101 Most Influential People (1992) |publisher=Amiannoying.com |date=1976-11-25 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described GLAAD as "possibly one of the most successful organizations lobbying the media for inclusion".&lt;ref&gt;[[#MC04|Myers and Cress 2004]]: 200&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 [[Cleve Jones]], a gay activist and [[Harvey Milk]]'s former lover, conceived the idea of the [[AIDS Memorial Quilt]] at a candlelight memorial for Harvey Milk. In 1987 he created the first quilt panel in honor of his friend Marvin Feldman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

During the course of the House Ethics Committee's investigation, Studds publicly acknowledged his homosexuality, a disclosure that, according to a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' article, "apparently was not news to many of his constituents". Studds stated in an address to the House, "It is not a simple task for any of us to meet adequately the obligations of either public or private life, let alone both, but these challenges are made substantially more complex when one is, as I am, both an elected public official and gay." He acknowledged that it had been inappropriate to engage in a relationship with a subordinate, and said his actions represented "a very serious error in judgment".&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953990,00.html | work=Time | title=Housecleaning | date=July 25, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won reelection in 1984.&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"/&gt; In 1987 [[Barney Frank]] became the first U.S. congressman to come out as gay of his own volition.

In this case it was ruled that a man's life partner was legally a family member as protected by rent control law.

==1990s==
On March 20, 1990, sixty LGBTQ people gathered at the [[Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Services Center]] in New York's [[Greenwich Village]] to create a [[direct action]] organization. The goal of the unnamed organization was the elimination of [[homophobia]], and the increase of [[gay]], [[lesbian]] and [[bisexual]] visibility through a variety of tactics. Group's breakthrough was at New York's Gay Pride parade when militant [[AIDS]] activists passed out to the assembled crowd an inflammatory manifesto, bearing the titles I Hate Straights! and Queers Read This! Within days, in response to the brash, "in-your-face" tone of the broadside, Queer Nation chapters had sprung up in San Francisco and other major cities. The name [[Queer Nation]] had been used casually since the group's inception, until it was officially approved at the group's general meeting on May 17, 1990.

There were several legal successes for gay men in the 1990s. Hawaii's denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples was first challenged in state court in 1991 in ''[[Baehr v. Miike]]'' (originally ''[[Baehr v. Lewin]]'') and the plaintiffs (a gay male couple, Patrick Lagon and Joseph Melillo, as well as two lesbian couples, Ninia Baehr and Genora Dancel, and Antoinette Pregil and Tammy Rodrigues) initially met with some success. But Hawaii voters modified the state constitution in 1998 to allow the legislature to restrict marriage to mixed-sex couples. By the time the Supreme Court of Hawaii considered the final appeal in the case in 1999, it upheld the state's ban on same-sex marriage, but same-sex marriage was legalized in Hawaii in 2013. In 1993 the "[[Don't Ask Don't Tell]]" policy was enacted, which mandated that the military could not ask servicemembers about their sexual orientation or go on "witch hunts" to find and expel homosexual service members.&lt;ref&gt;Craig A.

There was also one prominent political success for gay men in the 1990s. In 1994, President [[Bill Clinton]] considered [[James Hormel]] for the [[ambassador]]ship to [[Fiji]], but did not put the nomination forward due to protests from Fiji officials.&lt;ref name="GALAAPP"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_boGY8AUTIC | title=Gay and lesbian Americans and political participation: a reference handbook | author=Raymond A.

The [[Bear flag (gay culture)|International Bear Brotherhood Flag]] was created in 1995. There is debate over its creator, but Craig Byrnes claims to have created it. Bear is an affectionate gay slang term for those in the bear communities, a subculture in the gay male community with its own events, codes, and culture-specific identity.

In 2002, a lawsuit brought by [[Henkle v. Gregory|Derek R. Henkle]] against the [[Washoe County School District]] (Nevada) ended in a settlement in which the district agreed to implement policies to support openly gay and lesbian students and to pay the plaintiff, a student who had complained of [[bullying|harassment]] and inaction on the part of school officials, $451,000 in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merjian|first=Armen H.|year=2009|title=Henkle v.

Perhaps the most important court case ever for gay men was 2003's ''[[Lawrence vs Texas]]'' ([[Case citation|539 U.S. 558]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://supreme.justia.com/us/539/558/case.html |title=Official 52-page written document compilation }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(539&amp;nbsp;KB)}} Syllabus, majority opinion, concurrence, and dissents.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the [[sodomy law]] in [[Texas]] and, by extension, invalidated [[Sodomy laws in the United States|sodomy laws in thirteen other states]], making same-sex sexual activity legal in every U.S. state and territory. The Court thus overturned its previous ruling on the same issue in the 1986 case ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'', where it had upheld a challenged [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] statute and did not find a [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] protection of sexual privacy.

Another important victory for gay men came when in 2009, due to the [[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act]] being signed into law, the definition of federal hate crime was expanded to include those violent crimes in which the victim is selected due to their sexual orientation; previously federal hate crimes were defined as only those violent crimes where the victim is selected due to their race, color, religion, or national origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/09/us/politics/09hate.html | work=The New York Times | title=House Votes to Expand Hate Crimes Definition | first=Carl | last=Hulse | date=October 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also the first same sex marriage legally performed in the State of Michigan, despite Michigan's constitutional prohibition, and held legal standing because of the federally recognized status of the Tribe, which is sovereign on its own lands within the state.

====Supreme Court Decision====

Finally, on June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5-to-4 vote in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' that the Constitution guarantees a right to same-sex marriage, legalizing it throughout the United States.&lt;ref name="NYT-20150626"&gt;{{cite news |last=Liptak |first=Adam |title=Same-Sex Marriage Is a Right, Supreme Court Rules, 5-4 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage.html |date=June 26, 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=June 26, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case began when a male same-sex couple from Cincinnati, Ohio, filed a lawsuit, ''Obergefell v. Kasich'' (the named [[defendant]] was [[John Kasich]], the 69th governor of Ohio), in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio|U.S. Southern District of Ohio]] on July 19, 2013, alleging that the state discriminates against same-sex couples who have married lawfully out-of-state. Because one partner, John Arthur, was [[terminally ill]] and suffering from [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), they wanted the Ohio Registrar to identify the other partner, James Obergefell ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|b|ər|ɡ|ə|f|ɛ|l}}), as his surviving spouse on his [[death certificate]] based on their [[Same-sex marriage in Maryland|marriage in Maryland]] on July 11, 2013.

===Victories in law and the military===

Aside from the legalization of same-sex marriage, there were four other prominent successes for gay men in this decade. In 2011 the "Don't Ask Don't Tell" policy was ended, allowing gay men, bisexuals, and lesbians in the U.S. military to be open about their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nbjc.org/issues/dont-ask-dont-tell |title="Don't Ask, Don't Tell" &amp;#124; National Black Justice Coalition |publisher=Nbjc.org |accessdate=2012-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104042214/http://nbjc.org/issues/dont-ask-dont-tell |archivedate=2012-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Join the discussion: Click to view comments, add yours |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/president-obama-signs-repeal-of-dont-ask-dont-tell-policy/1141601 |title=President Obama signs repeal of 'don't ask, don't tell' policy&amp;nbsp;— Tampa Bay Times |publisher=Tampabay.com |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/23/us/23military.html | work=The New York Times | first=Elisabeth | last=Bumiller | title=Obama Ends ‘Don't Ask, Don't Tell' Policy | date=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/09/20/repeal-ban-on-gay-military-service-official-tuesday/ | work=Fox News | title=Official Repeal of Gay Ban Causing Few Waves in Military | date=2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in 2014, President Obama signed [[Executive Order 13672]], adding both "sexual orientation" and "gender identity" to the categories protected against discrimination in employment and hiring on the part of federal government contractors and sub-contractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/07/21/executive-order-further-amendments-executive-order-11478-equal-employmen|title=Executive Order -- Further Amendments to Executive Order 11478, Equal Employment Opportunity in the Federal Government, and Executive Order 11246, Equal Employment Opportunity|work=The White House|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important victory came in 2015, when the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission concluded that [[Title VII]] of the 1964 Civil Rights Act does not allow sexual orientation discrimination in employment because it is a form of sex discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carpenter |first=Dale |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/07/16/anti-gay-discrimination-is-sex-discrimination-says-the-eeoc/ |title=Anti-gay discrimination is sex discrimination, says the EEOC |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2012-12-14 |accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tatectate |first=Curtis |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/gay-south-florida/article27469123.html |title=EEOC: Federal law bans workplace bias against gays, lesbians, bisexuals &amp;#124; Miami Herald Miami Herald |publisher=Miamiherald.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the Supreme Court ruled in ''Pavan v.

The '''Houthi movement''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|uː|θ|i}}; {{lang-ar|الحوثيون}} ''al-Ḥūthiyyūn'' {{IPA-ar|ˈħuːθij.juːn|}}), officially called '''Ansar Allah''' (''{{transl|ar|[[:wikt:نصر|anṣār]] [[Allah|allāh]]}}'' {{lang|ar|أنصار الله}} "Supporters of God"), is an Islamic religious-political-armed movement that emerged from [[Sa'dah]] in northern [[Yemen]] in the 1990s. They are of the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] sect though the movement reportedly also includes [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalvoices.org/2015/04/01/debunking-media-myths-about-the-houthis-in-war-torn-yemen/|title=Debunking Media Myths About the Houthis in War-Torn Yemen · Global Voices|date=1 April 2015|website=GlobalVoices.org|access-date=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-29319423|title=Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom?|date=2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the leadership of [[Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi]], the group emerged as a Zaydi opposition to former Yemeni president [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]], whom they charged with massive financial corruption and criticized for being backed by Saudi Arabia and the United States&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; at the expense of the Yemeni people&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and Yemen's sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2015/02/12/5-things-houthis-yemen/|title=5 Things to Know About the Houthis of Yemen|last=Streuly|first=Dick|date=2015-02-12|website=WSJ|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resisting Saleh's order for his arrest,&lt;ref name="IRIN" /&gt; Hussein was killed in [[Sa'dah]] in 2004 along with a number of his guards by the Yemeni army, sparking the [[Houthi insurgency in Yemen]].&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; Since then, except for a short intervening period, the movement has been led by his brother [[Abdul-Malik al-Houthi]].&lt;ref name="IRIN" /&gt;

The Houthi movement attracts its Zaidi-Shia followers in Yemen by promoting regional political-religious issues in its media, including the overarching [[Conspiracy theories in the Arab world|US-Israeli conspiracy]] and Arab "collusion".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|title= An Interview With President Ali Abdullah Saleh|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/28/world/middleeast/28saleh-interview.html|accessdate= 15 October 2016|agency= NyTimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alaraby"&gt;{{cite news|title= Houthi propaganda: following in Hizbullah's footsteps|url= https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2015/4/12/houthi-propaganda-following-in-hizballahs-footsteps|accessdate= 15 October 2016|agency= alaraby|publisher= alaraby|ref= houthis_slogan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the Houthis' slogan "God is great, death to the US, death to Israel, curse the Jews, and victory for Islam", became the group's trademark.&lt;ref name="alaraby" /&gt; Houthi officials, however, have rejected the literal interpretation of the slogan.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The Houthis took part in the [[2011 Yemeni Revolution]] by participating in street protests and by coordinating with [[Political parties in Yemen|other opposition groups]]. They joined the [[National Dialogue Conference]] in Yemen as part of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] (GCC) initiative to broker peace following the unrest. However, the Houthis would later reject the November 2011 GCC deal's provisions stipulating formation of six federal regions in Yemen, claiming that the deal did not fundamentally reform governance and that the proposed federalization "divided Yemen into poor and wealthy regions". Houthis also feared the deal was a blatant attempt to weaken them by dividing areas under their control between separate regions.&lt;ref name="JUNEAU" /&gt; In late 2014 Houthis repaired their relationship with the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, and with his help, they [[Houthi takeover in Yemen|took control of the capital]] and much of the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/yemen|title=Yemen|last1=HRW|accessdate=15 October 2016|agency=HRW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ahmed Addaghashi, a professor at [[Sanaa University]], the Houthis began as a moderate theological movement that preached tolerance and held a broad-minded view of all the Yemeni peoples.&lt;ref name="AlJazIntro"&gt;{{cite news|author=Al Batati, Saeed|title=Who are the Houthis in Yemen?|newspaper=Al Jazeera|date=21 August 2014|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/08/yemen-houthis-hadi-protests-201482132719818986.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823035209/http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/08/yemen-houthis-hadi-protests-201482132719818986.html|archivedate=23 August 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first organization, "the Believing Youth" (BY), was founded in 1992 in [[Saada Governorate]]&lt;ref name="Freeman2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=Jack|title=The al Houthi Insurgency in the North of Yemen: An Analysis of the Shabab al Moumineen|journal=Studies in Conflict &amp; Terrorism|volume=32|issue=11|year=2009|pages=1008–1019|issn=1057-610X|doi=10.1080/10576100903262716}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1008}} by either [[Mohammed al-Houthi]],&lt;ref name="RAND"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/2010/RAND_MG962.pdf|title=Regime and Periphery in Northern Yemen: The Huthi Phenomenon|publisher=RAND|year=2010|accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|98}} or his brother [[Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi|Hussein al-Houthi]].&lt;ref name="BBCAbd-al-Malak"&gt;{{cite news|title=Yemen's Abd-al-Malik al-Houthi|newspaper=BBC|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/monitoring/yemens-abd-almalik-alhouthi|date=3 October 2014|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Believing Youth established school clubs and summer camps&lt;ref name="RAND"/&gt;{{rp|98}} in order to "promote a [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] revival" in Saada.&lt;ref name="BBCAbd-al-Malak"/&gt; By 1994–1995, 15–20,000 students had attended BY summer camps. The religious material included lectures by Mohammed Hussein Fadhlallah (a Lebanese Shiite scholar) and [[Hassan Nasrallah]] (Secretary General of Lebanon's Hezbollah Party) "&lt;ref name="RAND"/&gt;{{rp|99}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.scot/world/profile-the-crisis-in-yemen.1317|title=Profile: The crisis in Yemen|work=thenational.scot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the Houthi organisations have been described by Adam Baron of the [[European Council on Foreign Relations]] as a reaction to foreign intervention. Their views include shoring up Zaidi support against the perceived threat of Saudi-influenced ideologies in Yemen and a general condemnation of the former Yemeni government's alliance with the United States, which, along with complaints regarding the government's corruption and the marginalisation of much of the Houthis' home areas in Saada, constituted the group's key grievances.&lt;ref name=PoliticoMagazine&gt;{{cite news|author=Adam Baron|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/03/yemen-intervention-116396.html|title=What Went Wrong with Yemen|date=25 March 2015|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hussein al-Houthi, who was killed in 2004, had no official relation with Believing Youth, according to Zaid, he contributed to the radicalisation of some Zaydis after the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. BY-affiliated youth adopted [[anti-American]] and [[anti-Jewish]] slogans which they chanted in the [[Saleh Mosque]] in [[Sana'a]] after Friday prayers.
According to Zaid, the followers of Houthi's insistence on chanting the slogans attracted the authorities' attention, further increasing government worries over the extent of the al-Houthi movement's influence. "The security authorities thought that if today the Houthis chanted `[[Death to America]]', tomorrow they could be chanting `Death to the president [of Yemen]".
800 BY supporters were arrested in Sana'a in 2004. President [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] then invited Hussein al-Houthi to a meeting in Sana'a, but Hussein declined. On 18 June 2004 Saleh sent government forces to arrest Hussein.&lt;ref name="IRIN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Yemen: The conflict in Saada Governorate – analysis|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/488f180d1e.html|publisher=IRIN|date=24 July 2008|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hussein responded by launching [[Shia insurgency in Yemen|an insurgency]] against the central government but was killed on 10 September 2004.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite news|title=Yemeni forces kill rebel cleric|date=10 September 2004|newspaper=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3643600.stm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121091116/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3643600.stm|archivedate=21 November 2006|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The insurgency continued intermittently until a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2010.&lt;ref name="AlJazIntro" /&gt; During this prolonged conflict, the Yemeni army and air force was used to suppress the Houthi rebellion in northern Yemen. The Saudis joined these anti-Houthi campaigns but the Houthis won against both Saleh and the Saudi army. According to the [[Brookings Institution]], this particularly humiliated the Saudis, who spent tens of billions of dollars on their military.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Later, the Houthis participated in the 2011 [[Yemeni Revolution]], as well as the ensuing [[National Dialogue Conference]] (NDC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Huthis: From Saada to Sanaa |series=Middle East Report N°154 |publisher=International Crisis Group |date=10 June 2014 |url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/middle-east-north-africa/iraq-iran-gulf/yemen/154-the-huthis-from-saada-to-sanaa.aspx |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XdzKSIiM?url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/middle-east-north-africa/iraq-iran-gulf/yemen/154-the-huthis-from-saada-to-sanaa.aspx |archivedate=8 April 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they rejected the provisions of the November 2011 [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Cooperation Council]] deal on the ground that "it divide[d] Yemen into poor and wealthy regions" and also in response to assassination of their representative at NDC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yemen Al Houthi rebels slam federation plan as unfair|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/yemen/yemen-al-houthi-rebels-slam-federation-plan-as-unfair-1.1289512|accessdate=16 March 2014|newspaper=Gulf News|date=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=al-Hassani|first=Mohammed|title=HOUTHI SPOKESPERSON TALKS TO THE YEMEN TIMES|url=http://www.yementimes.com/en/1753/intreview/3454/Houthi-spokesperson-talks-to-the-Yemen-Times.htm|accessdate=16 March 2014|newspaper=Yemen Times|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the revolution went on, Houthis gained control of greater territory. By 9 November 2011, Houthis were said to be in control of two Yemeni governorates (Saada and Al Jawf) and close to taking over a third governorate (Hajjah),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Houthis Close to Control Hajjah Governorate, Amid Expectations of Expansion of Control over Large Parts of Northern Yemen |publisher=Islam Times|date=29 November 2011 |url=http://www.islamtimes.org/vdcirrazyt1azq2.ilct.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405064347/http://www.islamtimes.org/vdcirrazyt1azq2.ilct.html |archivedate=5 April 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would enable them to launch a direct assault on the Yemeni capital of [[Sana'a]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Al-Houthi Expansion Plan in Yemen Revealed|newspaper=Yemen Post |date= 9 November 2011 |url=http://yemenpost.net/Detail123456789.aspx?ID=3&amp;SubID=4288&amp;MainCat=3 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109115052/http://yemenpost.net/Detail123456789.aspx?ID=3&amp;SubID=4288&amp;MainCat=3 |archivedate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, it was reported that the Houthis controlled a majority of Saada, Al Jawf, and Hajjah governorates; they had also gained access to the [[Red Sea]] and started erecting barricades north of Sana'a in preparation for more conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yobserver.com/front-page/10022057.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120919191535/http://www.yobserver.com/front-page/10022057.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 September 2012|title=New war with al-Houthis is looming|publisher=Yemen observer|accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:President Ali Abdullah Saleh.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Yemen's former president [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] was allied with Houthis between 2014 until his death in 2017. He was assassinated by the Houthis on charges of treason.]]

It was believed by the Gulf States that the Houthis had accepted aid from Iran while Saudi Arabia was aiding their Yemeni rivals.&lt;ref name=NYT010715&gt;{{cite news|author1=Kareem Fahim|title=Violence Grows in Yemen as Al Qaeda Tries to Fight Its Way Back|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/world/violence-grows-in-yemen-as-al-qaeda-tries-to-fight-its-way-back.html|accessdate=8 January 2015|work=The New York Times|publisher=The Times Company|date=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a televised speech on 22 March, Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi accused the US and Israel of supporting the terrorists attacks.

According to a 2015 September report by [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire magazine]], the Houthis, once the outliers, are now one of the most stable and organised social and political movements in Yemen. The power vacuum created by Yemen's uncertain transitional period has drawn more supporters to the Houthis. Many of the formerly powerful parties, now disorganised with an unclear vision, have fallen out of favour with the public, making the Houthis — under their newly branded Ansar Allah name — all the more attractive.&lt;ref name="Yemen in crisis"/&gt;

Houthi spokesperson Mohamed Abdel Salam stated that his group had spotted messages between UAE and Saleh three months before his death. He told [[Al-Jazeera]] that there was communication between Saleh, UAE and a number of other countries such as Russia and [[Jordan]] through encrypted messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://alkhaleejonline.net/articles/1512415225521026500/الحوثيون-رصدنا-رسائل-بين-صالح-وأبوظبي-قبل-3-شهور/ | title= الحوثيون: رصدنا رسائل بين صالح وأبوظبي قبل 3 شهور |date= 4 December 2017|accessdate=5 December 2017|publisher=[[Al Khaleej (newspaper)|Al Khaleej]]|language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alliance between Saleh and the Houthi broke down in late 2017,&lt;ref name="AJ_H-S"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Edroos|first1=Faisal|title=How did Yemen's Houthi-Saleh alliance collapse?|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/yemen-houthi-saleh-alliance-collapse-171204070831956.html|accessdate=4 December 2017|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Battle of Sana'a (2017)|armed clashes]] occurring in Sana'a from 28 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/violence-escalates-sanaa-saleh-loyalists-battle-houthis/|title=Violence escalates in Sanaa as Saleh loyalists battle Houthis|date=2 December 2017|accessdate=2 December 2017|author=Leith Fadel|publisher=[[Al Masdar News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership and support==
[[File:Ansar Allah fighters.jpg|thumb|Ansar Allah fighters in Yemen, August 2009.]]
There is a difference between the [[Houthi tribe|al-Houthi family]]&lt;ref name="RAND"/&gt;{{rp|102}} and the Houthi movement. The movement was called by their opponents and foreign media "Houthis". The name came from the surname of the leader of the movement [[Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi]] who died in 2004.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The Houthis avoid assuming a singular tribal identity. Instead, the group strategically draws support from tribes of the northern Bakil federation, rival to the Hashid federation which had been a traditional ally of the central government. The Houthis' lack of centralised command structure allows them to generate immense support, as Yemenis from diverse backgrounds have joined their cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/shabab-al-moumineen.htm|title=Hothi / Houthi / Huthi; Ansar Allah; al-Shabab al-Mum'en / Shabab al-Moumineen (Believing Youth)|publisher=globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
[[File:Yemen ethno 2002.jpg|thumb|right|Ethnoreligious groups in 2002. [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] [[Shia Islam|Shia]] followers make up over 42% of Muslims in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;M. Izady.

Houthis belong to the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] branch of [[Islam]], also known as Fivers, a sect of Islam almost exclusively present in Yemen.&lt;ref name="Al-Shamahi"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Al-Shamahi, Abubakr |title=Yemen is more nuanced than 'Sunni' &amp; 'Shia' |date=7 February 2014 |newspaper=Yemen Times |url=http://www.yementimes.com/en/1759/opinion/3540/Yemen-is-more-nuanced-than-%E2%80%98Sunni%E2%80%99-amp;%C2%A0%E2%80%98Shia%E2%80%99.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102062350/http://www.yementimes.com/en/1759/opinion/3540/Yemen-is-more-nuanced-than-%E2%80%98Sunni%E2%80%99-amp%3B%C2%A0%E2%80%98Shia%E2%80%99.htm |archivedate=2 January 2015 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zaydis make up about 25 percent of the population, [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]] make up 75 percent, and there are also tiny minorities of Muslims who are members of other Shia sects — the [[Ismaili]] and [[Twelver]] communities. Al-Houthi Zaydis are estimated to make up about 30 percent of the Shiite population, according to Hassan Zaid, secretary-general of the al-Haq opposition party. The Zaydis ruled Yemen for 1,000 years up until 1962. During this time they ferociously defended their independence and fought off foreign powers (Egypt, the Ottomans) who controlled lower Yemen and tried to extend their rule to the north.&lt;ref name="IRIN"/&gt;

Similar to Shia Muslims in matters of religious law and rulings, the Houthi belief in the concept of an [[Imamate]] as being essential to their religion makes them distinct from Sunnis.&lt;ref name=Globalsecurity.org&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pike|first1=John|title=Zaydi Islam|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/intro/islam-zaydi.htm|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014 it has been observed that "The Houthi group's approach is in many ways similar to that of [[Hezbollah|Hizbollah]] in Lebanon. Similarly religiously based and Iran-backed, both groups follow the same military doctrine and glorify the [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini]] revolution in Iran".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/opinion/houthis-seek-to-impose-a-new-reality-on-yemen|title=Houthis seek to impose a new reality on Yemen|publisher=The National|date=23 September 2014|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence, the Houthis have regularly been accused, even by many fellow Zaidis, of secretly being converts or followers of the [[Twelver]] sect, which is the official religion of their ally and backer Iran.&lt;ref name="Al-Shamahi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Profile: Who are Yemen's Houthis"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Manuel Almeida|title=Profile: Who are Yemen's Houthis?|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/perspective/profiles/2014/10/08/Profile-Who-are-Yemen-s-Houthis-.html|accessdate=2 February 2015|work=Al Arabiya News|date=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hothi/Houthi/Huthi: al-Shabab al-Mum'en/Shabab al-Moumineen (Believing Youth)|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/shabab-al-moumineen.htm|website=GlobalSecurity|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Bengio|editor1-first=Ofra|editor2-last=Litvak|editor2-first=Meir|title=The Sunna and Shi'a in History: Division and Ecumenism in the Muslim Middle East|date=8 November 2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230370739|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

The group's flag reads as following: "''[[Takbir|God Is Great]], [[Death to America]], Death to [[Israel]], Curse on the [[Jews]], Victory to [[Islam]]''".&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-ar|الله أكبر، الموت لأمريكا، الموت لإسرائيل، اللعنة على اليهود، النصر للإسلام}}; Transliterated as ''"alllah 'akbara, almawt li'amrika, almawt li'iisrayiyla, alllaenat ealaa alyahud, alnnasr lil'iislam"''&lt;/ref&gt; This motto is partially modelled on the motto of [[Iranian Revolution|revolutionary Iran]], which reads "Death to U.S. and death to Israel".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=ShahidSaless, Shahir |title=Does Iran really control Yemen |newspaper=Al Monitor |date=30 March 2015 |url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/02/iran-yemen-houthis-axis-of-resistance.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213230210/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/02/iran-yemen-houthis-axis-of-resistance.html |archivedate=13 February 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Houthi supporters stress that their ire for the U.S. and Israel is directed toward the governments of America and Israel. Ali al-Bukhayti, the spokesperson and official media face of the Houthis, tried to reject the literal interpretation of the slogan by stating that in one of his interview "We do not really want death to anyone. The slogan is simply against the interference of those governments [i.e. U.S. and Israel]".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news|title=Photo Essay: Rise of the Houthis|url=http://www.newsweek.com/photo-essay-rise-houthis-305511|work=[[Newsweek]]|date=9 February 2015|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Arabic Houthi-affiliated TV and radio stations they use religious connotations associated with jihad against Israel and the US.&lt;ref name="alaraby"/&gt; They also call Saudi Arabia a U.S. puppet state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2015/03/26/403503/Saudi-Arabia-puppet-of-US-Israel|title=PressTV-'Saudi Arabia puppet of US, Israel'|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charges of harassment against Jews===
The Houthis have been accused of expelling or restricting members of the rural [[Jews of Yemen|Yemeni Jewish community]]. Reports of abuse include Houthi supporters bullying or attacking the country's Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Amid-persecution-Yemeni-Jews-face-extinction|title=Amid persecution, Yemeni Jews face extinction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yementimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yementimes.com/en/1861/report/4905/%E2%80%9CDamn-the-Jews%E2%80%9D-proving-more-than-just-a-slogan.htm|title="Damn the Jews" proving more than just a slogan|newspaper=Yemen Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houthi officials, however, have denied any involvement in the harassment, asserting that under Houthi control, Jews in Yemen would be able to live and operate freely as any other Yemeni citizen. "Our problems are with Zionism and the occupation of Palestine, but Jews here have nothing to fear," said Fadl Abu Taleb, a spokesman for the Houthis. But despite insistence by Houthi leaders that the movement is not sectarian, a Yemeni Jewish rabbi has reportedly said that many Jews remain terrified by the movement's slogan.&lt;ref name="yementimes.com"/&gt; As a result, Yemeni Jews reportedly retain a negative sentiment towards the Houthis, who they allege have committed persecutions against them.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/world/middleeast/persecution-defines-life-for-yemens-few-jews.html?_r=1|title=Persecution Defines Life for Yemen's Remaining Jews|publisher=New York Times|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ayoob Kara]], Houthi militants had given an ultimatum telling Jews to "convert to Islam or leave Yemen".&lt;ref&gt;[http://yemenonline.info/special-reports/827 Houthis militants to Jews: Convert or leave Yemen]. 11 October 2015.

=== Charges of harassment against Baha’i minority===

The Houthis have been accused of detaining, torturing, arresting and held incommunicado of [[Bahá'í Faith]] members on charges of espionage and apostasy, which are punishable by death.&lt;ref name="mei.edu"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Majidyar |first1=Ahmed |last2=Al Jarallah |first2=Lama |url=http://www.mei.edu/content/article/io/iran-backed-houthi-rebels-step-persecution-baha-i-minority-yemen |accessdate=28 September 2018 |agency=mei |publisher=mei |date=September 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yemen: Houthis Sentence Baha'i Man to Death |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/02/27/yemen-houthis-sentence-bahai-man-death |website=hrw |publisher=hrw |accessdate=28 September 2018|date=2018-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Houthi leader Abdel-Malek al-Houthi has targeted Bahais in public speeches and accused the followers of [[Bahá'í Faith]] of being “satanic” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Michael |first1=Maggie |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/amnesty-decries-houthi-prosecution-of-bahais-in-yemen/2018/09/18/0d26eb2e-bb5d-11e8-adb8-01125416c102_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.c53fa596a76c |accessdate=28 September 2018 |agency=Washington Post |publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; and agents for the western countries, citing a 2013 fatwa issued by Iran’s Supreme Leader.&lt;ref name="mei.edu"/&gt;

==Motives and objectives==
When armed conflict for the first time erupted back in 2004 between the Yemeni government and Houthis, the [[Ali Abdullah Saleh|then-Yemeni President]] accused Houthis and other Islamic opposition parties of trying to overthrow the government and the republican system. However Houthi leaders for their part rejected the accusation by saying that they had never rejected the president or the republican system but were only defending themselves against government attacks on their community.&lt;ref name="arrabyee-2005"&gt;{{cite news| first=Nasser| last=Arrabyee| title=Rebellion continues| url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/743/re10.htm| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051024172005/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/743/re10.htm| dead-url=yes| archive-date=24 October 2005| work=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]]| date=25 May 2005| accessdate=11 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] Shi'ites compose one-third of the population of [[Yemen]] and Houthis have often voiced the grievances of the Zaidi population.&lt;ref name="Iran_support"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/15/us-yemen-houthis-iran-insight-idUSKBN0JT17A20141215|title=Iranian support seen crucial for Yemen's Houthis|newspaper=Reuters|date=15 December 2014|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group has also exploited the popular discontent over corruption and reduction of government subsidies.&lt;ref name="Iran_support"/&gt; According to a February 2015 [[Newsweek]] report, Houthis are fighting "for things that all Yemenis crave: government accountability, the end to corruption, regular utilities, fair fuel prices, job opportunities for ordinary Yemenis and the end of Western influence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Photo Essay: The Rise of the Houthis|url=http://www.newsweek.com/photo-essay-rise-houthis-305511|newspaper=[[Newsweek]]|date=9 February 2015|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Houthis have asserted that their actions are to fight against the expansion of [[Salafi movement|Salafism]] in Yemen,&lt;ref name="Profile: Who are Yemen's Houthis" /&gt; and for the defence of their community from discrimination, whereas the [[Government of Yemen|Yemeni government]] has in turn accused the insurgents of intending to overthrow the regime out of a desire to institute Zaidi religious law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7379929.stm|title=Deadly blast strikes Yemen mosque|date=2 May 2008|accessdate=11 November 2009|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; destabilising the government and stirring anti-American sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;Sultan, Nabil (10 July 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/FG10Ak02.html|title=Asia Times – Asia's most trusted news source for the Middle East|website=www.atimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hassan al-Homran, a former spokesperson for Ansar Allah, has said that "Ansar Allah supports the establishment of a civil state in Yemen. We want to build a striving modern democracy. Our goals are to fulfil our people's democratic aspirations in keeping with the Arab Spring movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://yemenpost.net/Detail123456789.aspx?SubID=7375|title=Hassan al-Homran, spokesperson for Ansar Allah|newspaper=Yemen Post|date=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Yemen Times]]'', Hussein al-Bukhari, a Houthi insider, said that Houthis' preferable political system is a republic with elections where women can also hold political positions, and that they do not seek to form a cleric-led government after the model of [[Politics of Iran|Islamic Republic of Iran]] for "we cannot apply this system in Yemen because the followers of the [[Shafi'i|Shafi]] ([[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]) doctrine are bigger in number than the Zaydis."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yementimes.com/en/1826/intreview/4467|title=Al-Bukhari to the Yemen Times: "The Houthis' takeover can not be called an invasion"|newspaper=[[Yemen Times]]|date=21 October 2014|access-date=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
[[Ali Akbar Velayati]], International Affairs Advisor to Supreme Iranian Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, stated in October 2014 that "We are hopeful that Ansar-Allah has the same role in Yemen as [[Hezbollah]] has in eradicating the terrorists in Lebanon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/03/analysis-iranian-reactions-to-operation-decisive-storm.php|title=Analysis: Iranian Reactions to Operation Decisive Storm|publisher=The Long War Journal|date=31 March 2015|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism and tactics==

===Political===
During their campaigns against Hadi government, Houthis used civil disobedience. Following the Yemeni government's decision in 13 July 2014 to increase fuel prices,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Yemenis protest fuel price hikes in several cities |newspaper=Press TV |url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/07/31/373453/yemenis-protest-fuel-price-hikes/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911002405/http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/07/31/373453/yemenis-protest-fuel-price-hikes/ |archivedate=11 September 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houthi leaders succeeded in organising massive rallies in the capital Sana'a to protest the decision and to demand resignation of the incumbent government of [[Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi]] for "state-corruption".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=1000s of Yemen's Houthis protest in Sana'a|newspaper=Press TV|date=20 August 2014|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/08/20/376026/houthis-protest-in-yemen-capital|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824115142/http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/08/20/376026/houthis-protest-in-yemen-capital|archivedate=24 August 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These protests developed into the 2014–2015 phase of the insurgency. Similarly, following [[2015 military intervention in Yemen|2015 Saudi-led airstrikes]] against Houthis which claimed civilians lives, Yemenis responded to the [[Abdul-Malik al-Houthi]]'s call and took to streets of the capital, Sana'a, in tens of thousands to voice their anger at the Saudi invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Supporters of Houthi revolutionaries take to streets in capital, Sana'a|date=26 March 2015|newspaper=[[Press TV]]|url=http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2015/03/26/403448/Houthi-supporters-take-to-Sanaa-streets|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401164622/http://presstv.ir/Detail/2015/03/26/403448/Houthi-supporters-take-to-Sanaa-streets |archivedate=1 April 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=[[Al Jazeera]]|title=Coalition jets continue to hit Houthi targets in Yemen|date=27 March 2015|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/03/coalition-jets-continue-hit-houthi-targets-yemen-150327022702372.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402134533/http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/03/coalition-jets-continue-hit-houthi-targets-yemen-150327022702372.html|archivedate=2 April 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural===
[[File:Houthis protest against airstrikes 3.png|thumb|right|A Houthi holds up an image of [[Abdul-Malik Badreddin al-Houthi]], the movement leader, during protests against the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|Saudi Arabian-led coalition]] ]]

The Houthis have also held a number of mass gatherings since the revolution. On 24 January 2013, thousands gathered in Dahiyan, [[Sa'dah]] and Heziez, just outside Sana'a, to celebrate [[Mawlid|Mawlid al-Nabi]], the birth of Mohammed. A similar event took place on 13 January 2014 at the main sports' stadium in Sana'a. On this occasion, men and women were completely segregated: men filled the open-air stadium and football field in the centre, guided by appointed Houthi safety officials wearing bright vests and matching hats; women poured into the adjacent indoor stadium, led inside by security women distinguishable only by their purple sashes and matching hats. The indoor stadium held at least five thousand women — ten times as many attendees as the 2013 gathering.&lt;ref name="Yemen in crisis" /&gt;

=== Media ===
The Houthis are said to have "a huge and well-oiled propaganda machine". They have established "a formidable media arm" with the Lebanese Hezbollah's technical support. The format and content of the group's leader, [[Abdul-Malik Badreddin al-Houthi|Abdul-Malik al-Houthi]]'s televised speeches are said to have been modeled after those of Hezbollah's Secretary General, [[Hassan Nasrallah]]. Following the peaceful youth uprising in 2011, the group launched its official TV channel, [[Almasirah]]. "The most impressive part" of Houthi propaganda, though, is their media print which includes 25 print and electronic publications.&lt;ref name="alaraby" /&gt;

Another western-based media, "Uprising Today", is also known to be extensively pro-Houthi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uprising.today|title=Home – Uprising Today|last=|first=|date=|website=Uprising Today Media|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combat and military===
In 2009, US Embassy sources have reported that Houthis used increasingly more sophisticated tactics and strategies in their conflict with the government as they gained more experience, and that they fought with religious fervor.&lt;ref name="Wikileaks"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09SANAA2186_a.html#efmAB5ACu|title=Cable:09SANAA2186_a|date=9 December 2009|publisher=Wikileaks|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scoop&gt;{{cite news|title=Cablegate: Who Are the Houthis, Part Two: How Are They|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WL0912/S01637/cablegate-who-are-the-houthis-part-two-how-are-they.htm|newspaper=[[Scoop (website)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in 2015, Houthis announced the local production of short-range ballistic missile [[Qaher-1]] on Al-Masirah TV. On May 19, 2017 Saudi Arabia intercepted a Houthi-fired ballistic missile targeting a deserted area south of the Saudi capital and most populous city Riyadh.

== Allegations of Iranian support ==

In April 2015, the [[United States National Security Council]] spokesperson [[Bernadette Meehan]] remarked that "It remains our assessment that Iran does not exert command and control over the Houthis in Yemen".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/030917_Rand_Testimony.pdf|title=United states senate committee on foreign relations|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joost Hiltermann]] wrote that Iran does not control the Houthis' decision-making as evidenced by Houthis' flat rejection of Iran's demand not to take over Sanaa in 2015.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Thomas Juneau, writing in the journal, [[International Affairs (journal)|International Affairs]], states that even though Iran's support for Houthis has increased since 2014, it remains far too limited to have a significant impact in the balance of power in Yemen.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A December 2009 cable between Sanaa and various intelligence agencies disseminated by [[WikiLeaks]] states that US State Dept. analysts believed the Houthis obtained weapons from the Yemeni [[black market]] and corrupt members of the Yemenis Republican Guard.&lt;ref name="Wikileaks" /&gt;
On the edition of 8 April 2015 of ''[[PBS Newshour]]'', [[Secretary of State]] John Kerry stated that the US knew Iran was providing military support to the Houthi rebels in Yemen, adding that Washington "is not going to stand by while the region is destabilised".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/world/middleeast/kerry-us-iran-military-aid-houthi-yemen.html|title=Kerry Says U.S. Knew of Iran's Military Aid to Houthi Rebels|date=10 April 2015|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillip Smyth of the [[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]] told [[Business Insider]] that Iran views Shia groups in the Middle East as "integral elements to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)." Smyth claimed that there is a strong bond between Iran and the Houthi uprising working to overthrow the government in Yemen. According to Smyth, in many cases Houthi leaders go to Iran for ideological and religious education, and Iranian and Hezbollah leaders have been spotted on the ground advising the Houthi troops, these Iranian advisers are likely responsible for training the Houthis to use the type of sophisticated guided missiles fired at the US Navy.&lt;ref&gt;cf. {{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/us-general-suspects-iran-role-in-houthi-attacks-on-us-ships/|title=US general suspects Iran role in Houthi attacks on US ships|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|date=2016-10-20|access-date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Iran, supporting the revolt in Yemen is "a good way to bleed the Saudis," Iran's regional and ideological rival. Essentially, Iran is backing the Houthis to fight against a Saudi-led coalition of Gulf States fighting to maintain government control of Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= businessinsider |title=Why the US confronted Iranian-backed militants in Yemen, and the risks that lie ahead|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/us-yemen-strike-houthi-iran-saudi-arabia-2016-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discord has led some publishers to fear that further confrontations may lead to an all-out Sunni-Shiite war.&lt;ref&gt;The Arab Revolts, 2013 David Mcmurray&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, photographs released by the Yemeni government show the United States Navy and Yemen's security forces seized a class of shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles not publicly known to have been out of state control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Seizure of Antiaircraft Missiles in Yemen Raises Fears That Iran Is Arming Rebels There|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/world/middleeast/weapons-seizure-in-yemen-raises-worries-of-irans-influence.html|accessdate=15 October 2016|agency=nytimes|publisher=nytimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, the U.S. Navy intercepted a large Iranian arms shipment, seizing thousands of weapons, AK-47 rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers that likely were headed to Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US seizes thousands of Iranian weapons, including grenade launchers, in Arabian Sea|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/04/04/us-seizes-thousands-iranian-weapons-including-grenade-launchers-in-arabian-sea.html|accessdate=15 October 2016|agency=fox news}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Allegations of human rights violations ==
Houthis have been accused of violations of international humanitarian law such as using [[child soldiers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/912|title=WHO ARE THE HOUTHIS, PART TWO: HOW ARE THEY  FIGHTING?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CC18"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.yementimes.com/en/1828/report/4489/Checkpoint-children-Armed-Houthis-under-18.htm |title=Checkpoint children: Armed Houthis under 18 |work=Yemen Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/06/q-conflict-yemen-and-international-law|title=Q &amp; A on The Conflict in Yemen and International Law – Human Rights Watch|work=hrw.org|date=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; shelling civilian areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Al-Haj|first1=Ahmed|last2=Youssef|first2=Nour|url=https://news.yahoo.com/aid-group-yemens-death-toll-rebel-shelling-nearly-104006790.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150720160828/http://news.yahoo.com/aid-group-yemens-death-toll-rebel-shelling-nearly-104006790.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 July 2015|title=Death toll from Yemen rebel shelling doubles to nearly 100|work=Yahoo!

According to Human Right Watch, Houthis inclined up their recruitment of children in 2015. The UNICEF mentioned that children with the Houthis and other armed groups in Yemen comprise up to a third of all fighters in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=HRW|title=Yemen: Houthis Send Children Into Battle|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/05/12/yemen-houthis-send-children-battle|website=HRW|publisher=HRW|date=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human Rights Watch has further accused Houthi forces of using landmines in Yemen's third-largest city of Taizz which has caused many civilian casualties and prevent the return of families displaced by the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=HRW|title=Yemen: Houthi Landmines Claim Civilian Victims|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/09/08/yemen-houthi-landmines-claim-civilian-victims|access-date=14 October 2016|agency=HRW|publisher=HRW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HRW has also accused the Houthis of interfering with the work of Yemen's human rights advocates and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=HRW|title=Yemen: Houthis Ban Rights Advocate's Travel|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/03/12/yemen-houthis-ban-rights-advocates-travel|access-date=14 October 2016|agency=HRW|publisher=HRW}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
An HRW researcher, quoted in 2009 US embassy report, has downplayed the repeated allegations by the former government of Yemen accusing the Houthis of using civilians as human shields, by saying that they did not have enough evidence to conclude that the Houthis have been intentionally using civilians as human shields.&lt;ref name=Wikileaks /&gt;&lt;ref name="scoop" /&gt;

The Human Rights Watch impicated that the Houthis using hostage taking as a tactic to generate profit. Human Rights Watch documented 16 cases in which Houthi authorities held people unlawfully, in large part to extort money from relatives or to exchange them for people held by opposing forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/09/25/yemen-houthi-hostage-taking| title=Yemen: Houthi Hostage-Taking| publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=September 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
According to the 2009 US Embassy cable leaked by [[WikiLeaks]], Houthis have reportedly established courts and prisons in areas they control. They impose their own laws on local residents, demand protection money, and dispense rough justice by ordering executions. [[Associated Press|AP]]'s reporter, Ahmad al-Haj argued that the Houthis were winning hearts and minds by providing security in areas long neglected by the Yemeni government while limiting the arbitrary and abusive power of influential sheikhs. According to the Civic Democratic Foundation, Houthis help resolve conflicts between tribes and reduce the number of revenge killings in areas they control. The US ambassador believed that the reports that explain Houthi role as arbitrating local disputes were more likely than the sinister{{Lopsided|date=August 2015}} suggestions.&lt;ref name="Wikileaks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scoop"/&gt;

==Areas under administration==

An '''idyll''' ([[British English]]) or '''idyl''' ([[American English]]) ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|d|əl}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|d|əl}}; from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|εἰδύλλιον}}, ''eidullion'', "short poem")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dei%29du%2Fllion εἰδύλλιον], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; is a short [[poem]], descriptive of rustic life, written in the style of [[Theocritus]]' short [[pastoral]] poems, the ''Idylls''. 

Unlike [[Homer]], Theocritus did not engage in heroes and warfare. His idylls are limited to a small intimate world, and describe scenes from everyday life. Later imitators include the Roman poets [[Virgil]] and [[Catullus]], Italian poets [[Torquato Tasso]], [[Sannazaro]] and [[Leopardi]], the English poet [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] (''[[Idylls of the King]]''), and Nietzsche's ''[[Idylls from Messina]]''. [[Goethe]] called his poem ''[[Hermann and Dorothea]]''—which [[Schiller]] considered the very climax in Goethe's production—an idyll.&lt;ref&gt;Gjert Vestrheim: "Hellas som ideal", ''Antikken i ettertiden'' (s. 170-2), edited by Universitetsforlaget, Oslo 2009, {{ISBN|978-82-15-01482-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The term is used in music to refer generally to a work evocative of pastoral or rural life such as [[Edward MacDowell]]'s ''Forest Idylls'', and more specifically to a kind of French courtly entertainment (''[[divertissement]]'') of the [[Baroque music|baroque era]] where a pastoral poem was set to music, accompanied by ballet and singing. Examples of the latter are [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]]'s ''L'Idylle sur la Paix'' set to a text by [[Jean Racine|Racine]] and [[Henri Desmarets|Desmarets]]' ''Idylle sur la naissance du duc de Bourgogne'' set to a text by [[Antoinette Deshoulières]].&lt;ref&gt;Randel, Don Michael (1999). "Idyll", [https://books.google.com/books?id=7iuZ6HaEMmoC&amp;q=Idyll#v=snippet&amp;q=Idyll&amp;f=false ''The Harvard Concise Dictionary of Music and Musicians'']. Harvard University Press, p. 312 and ''[[passim]]''. {{ISBN|0-674-00084-6}}; Sadie, Julie Anne (1998). ''Companion to Baroque Music''. University of California Press, p. 53. {{ISBN|0-520-21414-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the visual arts, an idyll is a painting depicting the same sort of subject matter to be found in idyllic poetry, often with rural or peasant life as its central theme. One of the earliest examples is the early 15th century ''[[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, Rose-Marie and Hagen, Rainer (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=e2DvEibWkKsC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=idyll+painting&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gs9OTZGtF4mChQex3OiVDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=idyll%20painting&amp;f=false ''What Great Paintings Say'', Volume 1]. Taschen, p.20. {{ISBN|3-8228-2100-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genre was particularly popular in English paintings of the Victorian era.&lt;ref&gt;Treble, Rosemary (1989).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5450">The '''International Computer Archive of Modern and Medieval English''' ('''ICAME''') is an international group of linguists and data scientists working in [[corpus linguistics]] to digitise [[English language|English]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Corpus Linguistics and Beyond: Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on English Language Research on Computerized Corpora|volume=59|page=vi|publisher=Rodopi|year=1987|isbn=978-9-062-03569-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation was founded in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]] in 1977 as the International Computer Archive of Modern English, before being renamed to its current title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Corpus Linguistics|first=Graeme|last=Kennedy|publisher=Routledge|p=85|isbn=978-1-317-89258-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The portal to their materials is hosted at the [[University of Bergen]], where they have set out the aim of the organization to "collect and distribute information on English language material available for computer processing and on linguistic research to compile an archive of English text corpora in [[Machine-readable data|machine-readable]] form, and to make material available to research institutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://clu.uni.no/icame/|title = ICAME|date = |accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Creating computer corpora, i.e. collections of texts in machine-readable form, is the most accessible way to study both transcribed spoken language and various genres of written texts for modern scholars, including both "descriptive and more theoretically-minded linguists".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = ICAME-Quo Vadis? Reflections on the use of computer corpora in linguistics|last = Johansson|first = Stig|authorlink=Stig Johansson (linguist)|date = 1994|journal = Computers and the Humanities |volume=28 |issue=4-5 |pages=243–252|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICAME group hosts academic conferences that focus on corpus linguistic studies of historical changes and contemporary grammatical descriptions of English, and makes corpora of different varieties of English available to scholars, starting with editions of the 1960s [[Brown Corpus]]. Their first academic conference was held in [[Bergen, Norway]] in 1979, and scholars who were interested in corpus linguistics continued to meet each spring in different European and English-speaking countries. At these meetings, the compilation and distribution of corpora they enabled played a key role in the creation of the field of corpus linguistics in the 20th century, a precursor to current big data analytics. In summarizing the field, Kennedy's ''Introduction to Corpus Linguistics'' notes that "for corpus linguists with an interest in the description of English, the International Computer Archive of Modern and Medieval English has been the major resource".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Introduction to Corpus Linguistics|last = Kennedy|first = Graeme|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014 |isbn = |location = |pages = ch. 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of ICAME on the field has also be laid out in Facchinetti's history, ''Corpus Linguistics Twenty-five Years On''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Corpus Linguistics Twenty-Five Years On|last = Facchinetti|first = Roberta|publisher = Brill / Rodopi|year = 2007|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One influential resource that ICAME made available was a CD of 20 different corpora, including those covering different regional Englishes (such as the [[Australian Corpus of English]], the [[Wellington Corpus of Spoken New Zealand English]], the [[Kolhapur Corpus of Indian English]], the [[Bergen Corpus of London Teenage Language]] (COLT), the [[Helsinki Corpus of Older Scots]], and the [[International Corpus of English]]—East-African component), as well as versions of the Brown Corpus and the [[Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen Corpus|Lancaster-Bergen-Oslo]] (LOB) corpus tagged for [[part of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = ICAME collection of English language corpora [CD]|last = Hofland|first = K.|publisher = |year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICAME also published an annual journal, the ''ICAME Journal'', formerly ''ICAME News'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.degruyter.com/view/supplement/s15025462_International_Computer_Archive_of_Modern_and_Medieval_English.pdf|title = degruyter ICAME supplement|date = |accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; that contains articles, conference reports, reviews and notices related to corpus linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://linguistlist.org/pubs/journals/get-journals.cfm?JournalID=6657|title = The LinguistList--ICAME Journal|date = |accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current editors of the ''ICAME Journal'' are Merja Kytö and [[Anna-Brita Stenström]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://clu.uni.no/icame/journal.html|title = ICAME Journal|date = |accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke Professor Emeritus position at [[Duke University]].  He was a major scholar of colonial Spanish American history and worked to strengthen organizations devoted to Latin American scholarship. In one obituary he was called, “a true giant” in the field. His work on the [[Spanish Enlightenment]] in Spanish America challenged received understandings of Spanish [[obscurantism]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur R. Steele, "John Tate Lanning (1902-1976)" ''The Hispanic American Historical Review” 57, no. 3, 1977, pp. 516.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1957, Lanning’s book ''The Eighteenth-Century Enlightenment in the University of San Carlos de Guatemala'' won the first [[Herbert E. Bolton]] Prize of the [[Conference on Latin American History]] for the best book in English.&lt;ref&gt;http://clah.h-net.org/?page_id=174 accessed 1 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  He served as editor of ''[[The Hispanic American Historical Review]]'', expanding its readership and maintaining high standards for each issue.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt; He served as chair of the Conference on Latin American History, the professional organization of Latin American historians, in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;http://clah.h-net.org/?page_id=542&lt;/ref&gt;

Lanning was a student of Herbert E. Bolton, a leading figure in U.S. borderlands history at [[University of California, Berkeley]]; and Lanning's early publications were on Southeast borderlands history, both monographs and edited historical texts.  He began pursuing Spanish American intellectual history when he held a [[John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur R. Steele, "John Tate Lanning (1902-1976)" ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 57, no. 3, 1977, pp. 516-519.&lt;/ref&gt;  As editor of The Hispanic American Historical Review, he expanded the circulation of the journal arranging with the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (and later the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] by giving gratis copies to scholars in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, pp. 516-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kfar Tebnit''' or '''Kfar Tibnit'''   ({{lang-ar|كفر تبنيت}})     is a village located approximately {{convert|4|km|mi}} south southeast of [[Nabatieh]], {{convert|37|km|mi}} southeast of [[Sidon]] in [[Lebanon]].

Kfar Tebnit takes its name from [[Tabnith]] ([[Hebrew]] "Tibni"), a ruler in the area ca. 280 BC and known as the "king of two Sidons". The [[Eshmunazar II sarcophagus|sarcophagus of his son Eshmun-'azar]] was found to bear a long inscription aimed to prevent looting with assurances that the  tomb contained no treasure.&lt;ref name="Hitti2004"&gt;Hitti, 2004, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
A [[Heavy Neolithic]] archaeological site of the [[Qaraoun culture]] was discovered here in 1926 by E. Passemard. Heavy Neolithic materials were found alongside one [[Trihedral Neolithic]] along with more regular [[Neolithic]] pieces. The tools were in sharp condition, made of fresh chert or grey-green flint and are stored in the [[National Museum of Beirut]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"&gt;Copeland and Wescombe, 1966, pp.  35-36&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
In 1875  [[Victor Guérin]] visited, and found here 130 [[Metualis]].&lt;ref&gt;Guérin, 1880, p. [https://archive.org/stream/descriptiongogr00gugoog#page/n561/mode/1up 521]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4833">The anonymous '''''Liber diversarum arcium''''' ('Book of various arts') is a [[medieval]] [[:Category:Art technological sources | handbook of painting]]. It contains over 500 art-technological instructions or recipes in [[Latin]], forming a complete structured painting course. It is probably the most substantial and comprehensive mediaeval [[:Category:Art technological sources | painters' technical recipe book]] to survive, and summarises the state of the art in the European workshops of the fourteenth century. In particular it is an important witness to the practice of [[oil painting]] before [[Van Eyck]]. The majority of the [[:Category:Art technological sources | recipes]] are unique.&lt;ref name=clarke&gt;Clarke, M. (2011) ''Mediaeval Painters’ Materials and Techniques: The Montpellier ‘Liber diversarum arcium’.'' London: Archetype Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Liber diversarum arcium'' is preserved in Manuscript H 277, fonds ancien, Bibliothèque interuniversitaire, section médecine, [[Montpellier]], [[France]] ([[Recto and verso|folios]] 81v-101v).&lt;ref&gt;Ravaisson, F. and Libri, G. (1849) ''Catalogue général des manuscrits des bibliothèques publiques des departments'', Vol. 1. Paris:  Imprimerie National, pp. 394–9, 739–811.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this manuscript dates from circa 1430 and was written in or near [[Venice]], in fact the textual core of the ''Liber diversarum arcium'' itself mainly reflects northern European practices, and probably dates from c.1300. This core consists partly of compilations of earlier technical recipes (but re-worked to make them more useful), and partly of newly composed material. During the fourteenth century various material (much of it Italian) was added to this core. &lt;ref name=clarke/&gt;

== Content ==
The text is substantial (26,000 words in Latin - thus containing far more on painting than the more famous ''[[Theophilus Presbyter]]''), and is unusual among medieval artists' recipe books in being highly structured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uhb.fr/alc/medieval/cd10/Oltrogge.pdf |format=PDF |last=Oltrogge |first=Doris |year=1998 |title=Cum sesto et rigula', l’organisation du savoir technologique dans le Liber diversarum artium de Montpellier et dans le De diversis artibus de Théophile, ''Cahiers Diderot'' 10: 67–99.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7617">[[File:Nixon 30-0316a.jpg|thumb|upright|The madman theory was an important part of [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[foreign policy]].]]

The '''madman theory''' is a [[political theory]] commonly associated with [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[foreign policy]]. He and his administration tried to make the leaders of hostile [[Communist Bloc]] nations think Nixon was irrational and volatile. According to the theory, those leaders would then avoid provoking the [[United States]], fearing an unpredictable American response.

==History==
In 1517, [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] had argued that sometimes it is "a very wise thing to simulate madness" (''[[Discourses on Livy]]'', book 3, chapter 2). Although in ''Nixon's Vietnam War'', Kimball argues that Nixon arrived at the strategy independently, as a result of practical experience and observation of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s handling of the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref name=Welch&gt;{{cite book|title=Painful Choices|author=David A. Welch|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780691123400|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="veconomist" /&gt;

In his 1962 book, ''Thinking About the Unthinkable'', futurist [[Herman Kahn]] argued that to "look a little crazy" might be an effective way to induce an adversary to stand down.&lt;ref name="STEVENSON-26-10-17"&gt;{{cite news|last1=STEVENSON|first1=JONATHAN|title=The Madness Behind Trump's 'Madman' Strategy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/opinion/the-madness-behind-trumps-madman-strategy.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=opinion-c-col-right-region&amp;region=opinion-c-col-right-region&amp;WT.nav=opinion-c-col-right-region|accessdate=26 October 2017|agency=New York Times|date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nixon===
Nixon's [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]], [[H. R. Haldeman]], wrote that Nixon had confided to him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I call it the Madman Theory, Bob. I want the North Vietnamese to believe I've reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We'll just slip the word to them that, "for God's sake, you know Nixon is obsessed about communism. We can't restrain him when he's angry—and he has his hand on the [[nuclear button]]" and [[Ho Chi Minh]] himself will be in [[Paris]] in two days begging for peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=H. R. | last=Haldeman | authorlink=H. R. Haldeman | title=The Ends of Power | publisher=Times Books |  year=1978 | page=122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In October 1969, the Nixon administration indicated to the [[Soviet Union]] that "the madman was loose" when the [[United States military]] was ordered to full global war readiness alert (unbeknownst to the majority of the American population), and [[bomber]]s armed with [[thermonuclear weapons]] flew patterns near the Soviet border for [[Operation Giant Lance|three consecutive days]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=James | last=Carroll | url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2005/06/14/nixons_madman_strategy/ | title=Nixon's madman strategy | publisher=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=2005-06-14 | accessdate=2007-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The administration employed the "madman strategy" to force the [[North Vietnam]]ese government to negotiate an end to the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=U.S. Diplomacy Since 1900|author=Robert D. Schulzinger|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2002|isbn=9780195142211|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1969, according to a recently-declassified CIA report, President Nixon may have suggested to South Vietnamese President Thieu that the two paths he was considering were either a nuclear weapons option or setting up a coalition government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nixon, Thieu, and the Bomb: CIA Report Sheds Light on Richard Nixon's Madman Diplomacy|editor=Jeffrey Kimball and William Burr|publisher=[[National Security Archive]]|url=https://unredacted.com/2018/02/20/thieu-and-the-bomb-cia-report-sheds-light-on-richard-nixons-madman-diplomacy/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the same lines, American diplomats, especially [[Henry Kissinger]], portrayed the [[Cambodian Campaign|1970 incursion into Cambodia]] as a symptom of Nixon's supposed instability.&lt;ref&gt;Michael S. Sherry. ''In the Shadow of War''. Yale University Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-300-07263-5}}. Page 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trump===
The theory is believed by some to be a strategy used by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Donald Trump]]&lt;ref name="veconomist" &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Rex Tillerson's agonies|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21730055-some-friction-between-president-and-secretary-state-normal-not-rex|work=[[The Economist]]|date=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in dealing with both allied and hostile nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Naftali|first1=Tim|title=The Problem With Trump's Madman Theory|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/10/madman-theory-trump-north-korea/542055/|accessdate=8 October 2017|work=The Atlantic|date=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Stevenson argues Trump's strategy may be even less effective than Nixon's because Nixon tried to give the impression that "he'd been pushed too far, implying that he would return to his senses if the Soviets and North Vietnamese gave in." Whereas the [[North Korea]]n government is unlikely to believe that "Trump would do the same" because his threats are "standard operating procedure", not a temporary emotional reaction.&lt;ref name="STEVENSON-26-10-17"/&gt;

==Criticism==
The theory was criticized as "ineffective and dangerous," by political scientist [[Scott Sagan]] and the historian Jeremi Suri, citing the belief that the Soviet leader [[Brezhnev]] did not understand what Nixon was trying to communicate and also the chance of an accident from the increased movements of U.S. forces.&lt;ref name="NYMad" /&gt;
President Trump's use of the theory with [[North Korea]] has been similarly criticized, suggesting the chance of an accident arising from North Korea's string of [[2017 North Korean missile tests|missile testing]] was also increased.&lt;ref name="NYMad"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Coll|first1=Steve|title=The Madman Theory of North Korea|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/02/the-madman-theory-of-north-korea|accessdate=8 October 2017|work=The New Yorker|date=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="STEVENSON-26-10-17"/&gt;

[[Image:RWS Tarot 01 Magician.jpg|thumb|200px|The Magician (I), an illustration from the [[Rider-Waite tarot deck]] first published in 1910.]]
'''Magic''' is a category in [[Western culture]] into which since the [[Age_of_Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] have been placed various beliefs and practices considered separate from both [[religion]] and [[science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2006|last=Bailey|first=Michael D.|title=Magic and Superstition in Europe: A Concise History from Antiquity to the Present|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|pages=2–3|isbn=9780742533875}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the term often had pejorative connotations, with things labelled ''magical'' perceived as being primitive, foreign, and [[Other (philosophy)|Other]]. The concept has been adopted by scholars in the [[study of religion]] and the [[social sciences]], who have proposed various different—and often mutually exclusive—definitions of the term; much contemporary scholarship regards the concept to be so problematic that it is better to reject it altogether as a useful analytic construct.

The term ''magic'' comes from the [[Old Persian]] ''magu'', a word that applied to a form of religious functionary about which little is known. During the late sixth and early fifth centuries BCE, this term was adopted into [[Ancient Greek]], where it was used with negative connotations, to apply to religious rites that were regarded as fraudulent, unconventional, and dangerous. This meaning of the term was then adopted by [[Latin]] in the first century BCE. Via Latin, the concept was incorporated into [[Christian theology]] during the first century CE, where magic was associated with [[demons]] and thus defined against (Christian) religion. This concept was pervasive throughout the Middle Ages, when Christian authors categorised a diverse range of practices—such as enchantment, [[witchcraft]], [[incantation]]s, [[divination]], [[necromancy]], and [[astrology]]—under the label ''magic''. In [[early modern Europe]], Italian [[Humanism|humanists]] reinterpreted the term in a positive sense to create the idea of [[natural magic]]. Both negative and positive understandings of the term were retained in Western culture over the following centuries, with the former largely influencing early academic usages of the word.

Since the nineteenth century, academics in various disciplines have employed the term ''magic'' but have defined it in different ways and used it in reference to different things. One approach, associated with the [[anthropology|anthropologists]] [[Edward Tylor]] and [[James G. Frazer]], uses the term to describe beliefs in [[sympathetic magic|hidden sympathies]] between objects that allow one to influence the other. Defined in this way, magic is portrayed as the opposite to science. An alternative approach, associated with the [[sociology|sociologists]] [[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Émile Durkheim]], employs the term to describe private rites and ceremonies and contrasts it with religion, which it defines as a communal and organised activity. Many scholars of religion have rejected the utility of the term ''magic'', arguing that it is arbitrary and ethnocentric; it has become increasingly unpopular within scholarship since the 1990s.

Throughout Western history, there have been examples of individuals who engaged in practices that their societies called ''magic'' and who sometimes referred to themselves as ''magicians''. Within modern [[occultism]], there are many self-described magicians and people who practice ritual activities that they term magic. In this environment, the concept of magic has again changed, usually being defined as a technique for bringing about changes in the physical world through the force of one's will. This definition was pioneered largely by the influential British occultist [[Aleister Crowley]].

==Definition==

{{Main|Magic and religion}}

Since the emergence of the [[study of religion]] and the [[social science]]s, magic has been a "central theme in the theoretical literature" produced by scholars operating in these academic disciplines.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=3}} According to the scholar of religion Randall Styers, attempting to define magic represents "an act of demarcation" by which it is juxtaposed against "other social practices and modes of knowledge" such as "religion" and "science".{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=25}} Scholars have engaged in extensive debates as to how to define magic,{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=3}} with such debates resulting in intense dispute.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=1}} Throughout such debates, the scholarly community has failed to agree on a definition of magic, in a similar manner to how they have failed to agree on a definition of religion.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=1}} Even among those throughout history who have described themselves as magicians, there has been no common understanding of what magic is.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=7}} Thus, as the historian Michael D. Bailey describes it, "magic" represents "a deeply contested category and a very fraught label";{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=8}} the fellow historian [[Owen Davies (historian)|Owen Davies]] stated that the word was "beyond simple definition".{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=2}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="Magic has often been dismissed as either primitive and irrational and therefore alien to modern society, as inherently opposed to the Judeo-Christian traditions of the West, or as incompatible with religion in general. These antipathetic sentiments are deeply embedded in Western culture, and the term magic has typically been used to describe non-mainstream beliefs and practices — non-Christians, heretics, non-Westerners, indigenous, ancient or 'primitive' cultures — any that might be considered 'Other.' The image of magic as inherently linked with the Other has functioned as an important factor in the construction of the self-identity of Western culture, for by defining magic as something alien, exotic, primitive, evil, deviant or even ridiculous, our society also makes a tacit statement as to its self-perceptions."|source=&amp;ndash; Historian of religion Henrik Bogdan{{sfn|Bogdan|2012|p=2}} }}

Many scholars have argued that the use of the term as an analytical tool within academic scholarship should be rejected altogether.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=2003|1p=103|2a1=Styers|2y=2004|2p=7|3a1=Otto|3a2=Stausberg|3y=2013|3p=1|4a1=Bailey|4y=2018|4p=3}}  The scholar of religion [[Jonathan Z. Smith]] for example argued that it had no utility as an [[etic]] term that scholars should use.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|p=166}} The historian of religion [[Wouter Hanegraaff]] agreed, stating that "the term magic is an important object ''of'' historical research, but not intended ''for'' doing research."{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|p=168}} The scholars of religion Berndt-Christian Otto and [[Michael Stausberg]] suggested that it would be perfectly possible for scholars to talk about [[amulet]]s, [[curse]]s, healing procedures, and other cultural practices often regarded as magical in Western culture without any recourse to the concept of magic itself.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=11}} The idea that "magic" should be rejected as an analytic term developed in anthropology, before moving into [[Classical studies]] and [[Biblical studies]] in the 1980s.{{sfn|Hutton|2003|p=100}} Since the 1990s, the term's usage among scholars of religion has declined.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|p=166}}

The concept and term "magic" developed in European society and thus using it when discussing non-Western cultures or pre-modern forms of Western society raises problems, as it may impose Western categories that are alien to them.{{sfnm|1a1=Otto|1a2=Stausberg|1y=2013|1p=6|2a1=Bailey|2y=2018|2p=27}} While "magic" remains an emic term in the history of Western societies, it remains an etic term when applied to non-Western societies.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=27}} During the twentieth century, many scholars focusing on Asian and African societies rejected the term "magic", as well as related concepts like "[[witchcraft]]", in favour of the more precise terms and concepts that existed within these specific societies.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=19}} A similar approach has been taken by many scholars studying pre-modern societies in Europe, such as [[Classical antiquity]], who find the modern concept of 'magic' inappropriate and favour more specific terms originating within the framework of the ancient cultures which they are studying.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=2003|1p=104|2a1=Bailey|2y=2018|2p=20}} Alternately, this term implies that all categories of magic are ethnocentric and that such Western preconceptions are an unavoidable component of scholarly research.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=6}}

Within Western culture, the term "magic" has been linked to ideas of the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]],{{sfn|Bogdan|2012|p=2}} foreignness,{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=89}} and primitivism.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=1}} In Styers' words, it has become "a powerful marker of cultural difference".{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=14}} It has also been repeatedly presented as the archetypally non-modern phenomenon.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=8}} Among Western intellectuals in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, magic was seen as a defining feature of "primitive" mentalities and was commonly attributed to marginal groups, locations, and periods.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=14}}

==Etymology and conceptual development==

===Ancient world===

====The Old Persian ''maguš''====

[[File:Herodotos Met 91.8.jpg|150px|thumb|right|One of the earliest surviving accounts of the Persian ''mágoi'' was provided by the Greek historian [[Herodotus]].]]

The English words ''magic'', ''mage'' and ''magician'' come from the Latin ''magus'', through the Greek ''μάγος'', which is from the [[Old Persian]] ''maguš'' ("magician").{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2012|1p=169|2a1=Otto|2a2=Stausberg|2y=2013|2p=16}} The Old Persian ''magu-'' is derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''*magh'' ("be able"), which was absorbed into the Iranian language; Iranians thereafter began using the word ''maguš'' ("magician"; i.e., an "able [specialist in ritual]") or ''*maghu'', which may have led to the [[Old Chinese|Old Sinitic]] ''*Mᵞag'' ("mage" or "shaman").{{sfn|Mair|2015|p=47}} The Old Persian form seems to have permeated Ancient [[Semitic languages]] as the [[Talmudic]] [[Hebrew]] ''magosh'', the [[Aramaic]] ''amgusha'' ("magician"), and the [[Chaldea]]n ''maghdim'' ("wisdom and philosophy"); from the first century BCE onwards, [[Syria]]n ''magusai'' gained notoriety as magicians and soothsayers.{{sfn|Mair|2015|p=36}}

The Magi are mentioned in both the [[Book of Jeremiah]] and the [[Behistun Inscription]] of [[Darius I]], indicating that they had gained considerable power and influence by the middle of the first millennium BCE.{{sfn|Mair|2015|p=36-37}} A number of ancient Greek authors discuss these Persian ''mágoi'' in their works. Among the first to do so was the historian [[Herodotus]], who states that the ''mágoi'' were one of seven Median tribes and that they served as functionaries at the court of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], where they acted as advisers to the king.{{sfnm|1a1=Bremmer|1y=2002|1p=2|2a1=Otto|2a2=Stausberg|2y=2013|2p=16}} According to Herodotus, these Persian ''mágoi'' were also in charge of various religious rites, namely sacrifices and the interpretation of dreams.{{sfnm|1a1=Davies|1y=2012|1p=3|2a1=Otto|2a2=Stausberg|2y=2013|2p=16}}

====In ancient Greece====

The term ''magic'' has its origins in [[Ancient Greece]].{{sfn|Bremmer|2002|p=1}}
During the late sixth and early fifth centuries BCE, the Persian ''maguš'' was Graecicized and introduced into the ancient Greek language as ''μάγος'' and ''μαγεία''.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=16}} In doing so it underwent a transformation of meaning, gaining negative connotations, with the ''magos'' being regarded as a charlatan whose ritual practices were fraudulent, strange, unconventional, and dangerous.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=16}} As noted by Davies, for the ancient Greeks—and subsequently for the ancient Romans—"magic was not distinct from religion but rather an unwelcome, improper expression of it - the religion of the other".{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=41}}

This change in meaning was influenced by the military conflicts that the Greek city-states were then engaged in against the Persian Empire.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=16}} In this context, the term makes appearances in such surviving text as [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', [[Hippocrates]]' ''[[De morbo sacro]]'', and [[Gorgias]]' ''[[Encomium of Helen]]''.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=16}} In Sophocles' play, for example, the character [[Oedipus]] derogatorily refers to the seer [[Tiresius]] as a ''magos''—in this context meaning something akin to 'quack' or 'charlatan'—reflecting how this epithet was no longer reserved only for Persians.{{sfnm|1a1=Bremmer|1y=2002|1pp=2–3|2a1=Bailey|2y=2018|2p=19}}

In the first century BCE, the Greek concept of the ''magos'' was adopted into [[Latin]] and used by a number of [[ancient Roman]] writers as ''magus'' and ''magia''.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=16}} The Roman use of the term was similar to that of the Greeks, but placed greater emphasis on the judicial application of it.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=16}} Within the [[Roman Empire]], laws would be introduced criminalising things regarded as magic.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=17}}
In ancient Roman society, magic was associated with societies to the east of the empire; the first century CE writer [[Pliny the Elder]] for instance claimed that magic had been created by the Persian philosopher [[Zoroaster]], and that it had then been brought west into Greece by the magician [[Osthanes]], who accompanied the military campaigns of the Persian King [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]].{{sfn|Davies|2012|pp=32–33}}

===Early Christianity and the Middle Ages===

In the first century CE, early Christian authors absorbed the Greco-Roman idea of magic and incorporated it into their developing [[Christian theology]].{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=17}} These Christians retained the Graeco-Roman negative connotations of the term and enhanced them by incorporating conceptual patterns borrowed from Jewish thought.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=17}} Like earlier Graeco-Roman thinkers, the early Christians attributed the origins of magic to an area to the east of Europe, among the Babylonians, Persians, or Egyptians.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=34}}

For early Christian writers like [[Augustine of Hippo]], magic did not merely constitute fraudulent and unsanctioned ritual practices, but was the very opposite of religion because it relied upon cooperation from [[demons]], the henchmen of [[Satan]].{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=17}} In this, Christian ideas of magic were closely linked to the Christian category of [[paganism]].{{sfn|Davies|2012|pp=41–42}} Ever since, the idea that magic is something defined in opposition to religion has been pervasive throughout Western culture.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=1}} This Christian emphasis on the inherent immorality and wrongness of magic as something conflicting with good religion was far starker than the approach in the other large [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religions of the period, Judaism and Islam.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=72}} For instance, while Christians regarded demons as inherently evil, the [[jinn]]—comparable entities in [[Islamic mythology]]—were perceived as more ambivalent figures by Muslims.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=72}}

The model of the magician in Christian thought was provided by [[Simon Magus]], or "Simon the Magician", a figure who opposed [[Saint Peter]] in both the [[Acts of the Apostles]] and the apocryphal yet influential [[Acts of Peter]].{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=99}} The historian Michael D. Bailey stated that in medieval Europe, "magic" was a "relatively broad and encompassing category".{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=21}} Christian theologians believed that there were multiple different forms of magic, the majority of which were types of [[divination]].{{sfn|Kieckhefer|2000|pp=10–11}} For instance, [[Isidore of Seville]] produced a catalogue of things he regarded as magic in which he listed [[augury]], [[necromancy]], [[astrology]], [[incantations]], [[horoscopes]], [[amulets]], [[geomancy]], [[hydromancy]], [[aeromancy]], [[pyromancy]], enchantment and [[ligature (medicine)|ligature]]s.{{sfnm|1a1=Kieckhefer|1y=2000|1p=11|2a1=Bailey|2y=2018|2p=21}} Medieval Europe also saw magic come to be associated with the Old Testament figure of [[Solomon]]; various [[grimoires]], or books outlining magical practices, were written that claimed to have been written by Solomon, most notably the ''[[Key of Solomon]]''.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=35}}

In early medieval Europe, ''magia'' was a term of condemnation.{{sfn|Flint|1991|p=5}} In medieval Europe, Christians often suspected Muslims and Jews of engaging in magical practices;{{sfnm|1a1=Davies|1y=2012|1p=6|2a1=Bailey|2y=2018|2p=88}} in certain cases, these perceived magical rites—including the [[Blood libel|alleged Jewish sacrifice of Christian children]]—resulted in Christians massacring these religious minorities.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=6}} Christian groups often also accused other, rival Christian groups—which they regarded as [[heresy|heretical]]—of engaging in magical activities.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=99}} Medieval Europe also saw the term ''maleficium'' applied to forms of magic that were conducted with the intention of causing harm.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=21}} The later Middle Ages saw words for these practitioners of harmful magical acts appear in various European languages: ''sorcière'' in French, ''Hexe'' in German, ''strega'' in Italian, and ''bruja'' in Spanish.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=22}} The English term for malevolent practitioners of magic, ''witch'', derived from the earlier [[Old English]] term ''wicce''.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=22}}

===Early modern Europe===

[[File:Natural Magick by Giambattista della Porta.jpg|thumb|right|Frontispiece of an English translation of ''Natural Magick'' published in London in 1658.]]

During the early modern period, the concept of magic underwent a more positive reassessment through the development of the concept of ''[[natural magic|magia naturalis]]'' (natural magic).{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=17}} This was a term introduced and developed by two Italian humanists, [[Marsilio Ficino]] and [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]].{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=17}} For them, ''magia'' was viewed as an elemental force pervading many natural processes,{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=17}} and thus was fundamentally distinct from the mainstream Christian idea of demonic magic.{{sfnm|1a1=Kieckhefer|1y=2000|1p=12|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2012|2p=170}} Their ideas influenced an array of later philosophers and writers, among them [[Paracelsus]], [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Johannes Reuchlin]], and [[Johannes Trithemius]].{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=17}} According to the historian [[Richard Kieckhefer]], the concept of ''magia naturalis'' took "firm hold in European culture" during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries,{{sfn|Kieckhefer|2000|p=12}} attracting the interest of [[natural philosophy|natural philosophers]] of various theoretical orientations, including [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelians]], [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]], and [[Hermeticism|Hermeticists]].{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=35}}

Adherents of this position argued that ''magia'' could appear in both good and bad forms; in 1625, the French librarian [[Gabriel Naudé]] wrote his ''Apology for all the Wise Men Falsely Suspected of Magic'', in which he distinguished "Mosoaicall Magick"—which he claimed came from God and included prophecies, miracles, and [[speaking in tongues]]—from "geotick" magic caused by demons.{{sfn|Davies|2012|pp=35–36}} While the proponents of ''magia naturalis'' insisted that this did not rely on the actions of demons, critics disagreed, arguing that the demons had simply deceived these magicians.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006b|p=739}} By the seventeenth century the concept of ''magia naturalis'' had moved in increasingly 'naturalistic' directions, with the distinctions between it and science becoming blurred.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006b|p=738}} The validity of ''magia naturalis'' as a concept for understanding the universe then came under increasing criticism during the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=18}}

Despite the attempt to reclaim the term ''magia'' for use in a positive sense, it did not supplant traditional attitudes toward magic in the West, which remained largely negative.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=18}} At the same time as ''magia naturalis'' was attracting interest and was largely tolerated, Europe saw an active persecution of accused witches believed to be guilty of ''maleficia''.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=35}} Reflecting the term's continued negative associations, [[Protestantism|Protestants]] often sought to denigrate [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] sacramental and devotional practices as being magical rather than religious.{{sfnm|1a1=Styers|1y=2004|1pp=9, 36–37|2a1=Davies|2y=2012|2p=7}} Many Roman Catholics were concerned by this allegation and for several centuries various Roman Catholic writers devoted attention to arguing that their practices were religious rather than magical.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=9}} At the same time, Protestants often used the accusation of magic against other Protestant groups which they were in contest with.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=37}} In this way, the concept of magic was used to prescribe what was appropriate as religious belief and practice.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=9}}
Similar claims were also being made in the Islamic world during this period. The Arabian cleric [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]]—founder of [[Wahhabism]]—for instance condemned a range of customs and practices such as divination and the veneration of spirits as ''sihr'', which he in turn claimed was a form of ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'', the sin of idolatry.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=9}}

===Colonialism and academia===

In the sixteenth century, European societies began to conquer and colonise other continents around the world, and as they did so they applied European concepts of "magic" and "witchcraft" to practices found among the peoples whom they encountered.{{sfnm|1a1=Styers|1y=2004|1p=60|2a1=Bailey|2y=2018|2p=23}} Usually, these European colonialists regarded the natives as primitives and savages whose belief systems were diabolical and needed to be eradicated and replaced by Christianity.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=23}} Because Europeans typically viewed these non-European peoples as being morally and intellectually inferior to themselves, it was expected that such societies would be more prone to practicing magic.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=98}} Women who practiced traditional rites were labelled "witches" by the Europeans.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=98}}

[[File:Affaire de Bizoton 1864.png|thumb|left|In the nineteenth century, the Haitian government began to legislate against Vodou, describing it as a form of witchcraft; this conflicted with Vodou practitioners' own understanding of their religion.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=25}}]]

In various cases, these imported European concepts and terms underwent new transformations as they merged with indigenous concepts.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=24}} In West Africa, for instance, Portuguese travellers introduced their term and concept of the ''feitiçaria'' (often translated as ''sorcery'') and the ''feitiço'' (spell) to the native population, where it was transformed into the concept of the ''[[Fetishism|fetish]]''. When later Europeans encountered these West African societies, they wrongly believed that the ''fetiche'' was an indigenous African term rather than the result of earlier inter-continental encounters.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=24}} Sometimes, colonised populations themselves adopted these European concepts for their own purposes. In the early nineteenth century, the newly independent Haitian government of [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] began to suppress the practice of [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]], and in 1835 Haitain law-codes categorised all Vodou practices as ''sortilège'' (sorcery/witchcraft), suggesting that it was all conducted with harmful intent, whereas among Vodou practitioners the performance of harmful rites was already given a separate and distinct category, known as ''maji''.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=25}}

By the nineteenth century, European intellectuals no longer saw the practice of magic through the framework of [[sin]] and instead regarded magical practices and beliefs as "an aberrational mode of thought antithetical to the dominant cultural logic - a sign of psychological impairment and marker of racial or cultural inferiority".{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=27}}
As educated elites in Western societies increasingly rejected the efficacy of magical practices, legal systems ceased to threaten practitioners of magical activities with punishment for the crimes of diabolism and witchcraft, and instead threatened them with the accusation that they were defrauding people through promising to provide things which they could not.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=103}}

This spread of European colonial power across the world influenced how academics would come to frame the concept of magic.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=61}}
In the nineteenth century, a number of scholars adopted the traditional, negative concept of magic.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=18}} That they chose to do so was not inevitable, for they could have followed the example adopted by prominent [[Western esotericism|esotericists]] active at the time like [[Helena Blavatsky]] who had chosen to use the term and concept of magic in a positive sense.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=18}}
Various writers also used the concept of magic to criticise religion by arguing that the latter still displayed many of the negative traits of the former. An example of this was the American journalist [[H. L. Mencken]] in his polemical 1930 work ''[[Treatise on the Gods]]''; he sought to critique religion by comparing it to magic, arguing that the division between the two was misplaced.{{sfn|Styers|2004|pp=9–10}}

In the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, [[folkloristics|folklorists]] examined rural communities across Europe in search of magical practices, which at the time they typically understood as survivals of ancient belief systems.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=29}} It was only in the 1960s that anthropologists like [[Jeanne Favret-Saada]] also began looking in depth at magic in European contexts, having previously focused on examining magic in non-Western contexts.{{sfn|Davies|2012|pp=30–31}}

The scholarly application of magic as a ''sui generis'' category that can be applied to any socio-cultural context was linked with the promotion of [[modernity]] to both Western and non-Western audiences.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|p=167}}

The term ''magic'' has become pervasive in the popular imagination and idiom.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=1}}
In contemporary contexts, the word ''magic'' is sometimes used to "describe a type of excitement, of wonder, or sudden delight", and in such a context can be "a term of high praise".{{sfn|Flint|1991|p=3}} Despite its historical contrast against science, scientists have also adopted the term in application to various concepts, such as [[magic acid]], [[Magic bullet (medicine)|magic bullets]], and [[magic angle]]s.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=1}}

===Modern Western occultism===

[[File:Aleister Crowley.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Concepts of modern magic are often heavily influenced by the ideas of Aleister Crowley]]

Modern Western magic has challenged widely-held preconceptions about contemporary religion and spirituality.{{sfn|Bogdan|2012|pp=1–2}}
The polemical discourses about magic influenced the self-understanding of modern magicians, a number of whom—such as [[Aleister Crowley]] and [[Julius Evola]]—were well versed in academic literature on the subject.{{sfn|Bogdan|2012|p=11}}
According to scholar of religion Henrik Bogdan, "arguably the best known emic definition" of the term "magic" was provided by Crowley.{{sfn|Bogdan|2012|p=11}} Crowley—who favoured the spelling "[[Magick (Thelema)|magick]]" over "magic" to distinguish it from stage illusionism{{sfnm|1a1=Bogdan|1y=2012|1p=12|2a1=Bailey|2y=2018|2pp=22–23}}—was of the view that "Magick is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will".{{sfn|Bogdan|2012|p=11}} Crowley's definition influenced that of subsequent magicians.{{sfn|Bogdan|2012|p=11}} [[Dion Fortune]] of the [[Fraternity of the Inner Light]] for instance stated that "Magic is the art of changing consciousness according to Will".{{sfn|Bogdan|2012|p=11}} [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], the founder of [[Gardnerian Wicca]], stated that magic was "attempting to cause the physically unusual",{{sfn|Bogdan|2012|p=11}} while [[Anton LaVey]], the founder of [[LaVeyan Satanism]], described magic as "the change in situations or events in accordance with one's will, which would, using normally acceptable methods, be unchangeable."{{sfn|Bogdan|2012|p=11}}

The [[chaos magic]] movement emerged during the late 20th century, as an attempt to strip away the [[symbol]]ic, [[ritual]]istic, [[Theology|theological]] or otherwise ornamental aspects of other occult traditions and distill magic down to a set of basic techniques.&lt;ref name=Urban&gt;{{cite book |last=Urban |first=Hugh |author-link=Hugh Urban |year=2006 |title=Magia Sexualis: Sex, Magic, and Liberation in Modern Western Esotericism |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6wVBx9yriTUC&amp;pg=PA240 |publisher=University of California Press |pages=240–243 |isbn=9780520932883 |ref=refUrban}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Drury&gt;{{cite book |title=The Watkins Dictionary of Magic: Over 3000 Entries on the World of Magical Formulas, Secret Symbols and the Occult |last=Drury |first=Nevill |author-link=Nevill Drury |publisher=Duncan Baird Publishers| year=2011 |orig-year=2002 |isbn=9781780283623 |url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=Bmg8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT96 |page=86 |ref = refDrury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These modern Western concepts of magic rely on a belief in correspondences connected to an unknown occult force that permeates the universe.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006b|p=741}} As noted by Hanegraaff, this operated according to "a ''new'' meaning of magic, which could not possibly have existed in earlier periods, precisely because it is elaborated in reaction to the "disenchantment of the world"."{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006b|p=741}}
For many, and perhaps most, modern Western magicians, the goal of magic is deemed to be personal spiritual development.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006b|p=743}}
The perception of magic as a form of self-development is central to the way that magical practices have been adopted into forms of [[modern Paganism]] and the [[New Age]] phenomenon.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006b|p=743}}
One significant development within modern Western magical practices has been [[sex magic]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006b|p=743}} This was a practice promoted in the writings of [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]] and subsequently exerted a strong interest on occultist magicians like Crowley and [[Theodor Reuss]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006b|p=743}}

The adoption of the term "magic" by modern occultists can in some instances be a deliberate attempt to champion those areas of Western society which have traditionally been marginalised as a means of subverting dominant systems of power.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=19}} The influential American [[Wicca]]n and author [[Starhawk]] for instance stated that "''Magic'' is another word that makes people uneasy, so I use it deliberately, because the words we are comfortable with, the words that sound acceptable, rational, scientific, and intellectually correct, are comfortable precisely because they are the language of estrangement."{{sfn|Styers|2004|pp=19–20}}

==Academic definitions==

Magic is one of the most heavily theorized concepts in the study of religion,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|p=164}} and also played a key role in early theorising within anthropology.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=21}} Styers believed that it held such a strong appeal for social theorists because it provides "such a rich site for articulating and contesting the nature and boundaries of modernity".{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=21}} Scholars have commonly used it as a foil for the concept of religion, regarding magic as the "illegitimate (and effeminized) sibling" of religion.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=6}} Alternately, others have used it as a middle-ground category located between religion and science.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=6}}

The context in which scholars framed their discussions of magic was informed by the spread of European colonial power across the world in the modern period.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=61}}
These repeated attempts to define magic resonated with broader social concerns,{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=8}} and the pliability of the concept has allowed it to  be "readily adaptable as a polemical and ideological tool".{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=9}} The links that intellectuals made between magic and "primitives" helped to legitimise European and Euro-American imperialism and colonialism, as these Western colonialists expressed the view that those who believed in and practiced magic were unfit to govern themselves and should be governed by those who, rather than believing in magic, believed in science and/or (Christian) religion.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=14}} In Bailey's words, "the association of certain peoples [whether non-Europeans or poor, rural Europeans] with magic served to distance and differentiate them from those who ruled over them, and in large part to justify that rule."{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=89}}

Many different definitions of magic have been offered by scholars, although — according to Hanegraaff — these can be understood as variations of a small number of heavily influential theories.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|p=164}}

===Intellectualist approach===

[[File:Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Edward Tylor, an anthropologist who used the term ''magic'' in reference to sympathetic magic, an idea that he associated with his concept of animism]]

The intellectualist approach to defining magic is associated with two prominent British [[Anthropology|anthropologists]], [[Edward Tylor]] and [[James G. Frazer]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|pp=164–165}} This was an approach that viewed magic as being the theoretical opposite of [[science]],{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2012|1p=165|2a1=Otto|2a2=Stausberg|2y=2013|2p=4}} and came to preoccupy much anthropological thought on the subject.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=4}} This approach was situated within the evolutionary models which underpinned thinking in the social sciences during the early 19th century.{{sfn|Davies|2012|pp=14–15}} The first social scientist to present magic as something that predated religion in an evolutionary development was [[Herbert Spencer]];{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=15}} in his ''A System of Synthetic Philosophy'', he used the term ''magic'' in reference to [[sympathetic magic]].{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|pp=16–17}} Spencer regarded both magic and religion as being rooted in false speculation about the nature of objects and their relationship to other things.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=17}}

Tylor's understanding of magic was linked to his concept of [[animism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Davies|1y=2012|1p=15|2a1=Bailey|2y=2018|2p=15}} In his 1871 book ''Primitive Culture'', Tylor characterized magic as beliefs based on "the error of mistaking ideal analogy for real analogy".{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=716|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2012|2p=164}} In Tylor's view, "primitive man, having come to associate in thought those things which he found by experience to be connected in fact, proceeded erroneously to invert this action, and to conclude that association in thought must involve similar connection in reality. He thus attempted to discover, to foretell, and to cause events by means of processes which we can now see to have only an ideal significance".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=716}} Tylor was dismissive of magic, describing it as "one of the most pernicious delusions that ever vexed mankind".{{sfnm|1a1=Cunningham|1y=1999|1p=18|2a1=Davies|2y=2012|2p=16}} Tylor's views proved highly influential,{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=16}} and helped to establish magic as a major topic of anthropological research.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=15}}

[[File:JamesGeorgeFrazer.jpg|thumb|left|150px|James Frazer regarded ''magic'' as the first stage in human development, to be followed by religion and then science]]

Tylor's ideas were adopted and simplified by James Frazer.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=716|2a1=Davies|2y=2012|2p=16}} He used the term "magic" to mean sympathetic magic,{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=716|2a1=Bailey|2y=2018|2pp=15–16}} describing it as a practice relying on the magician's belief "that things act on each other at a distance through a secret sympathy", something which he described as "an invisible ether".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=716}} He further divided this magic into two forms, the "homeopathic (imitative, mimetic)" and the "contagious". The former was the idea that "like produces like", or that the similarity between two objects could result in one influencing the other. The latter was based on the idea that contact between two objects allowed the two to continue to influence one another at a distance.{{sfnm|1a1=Cunningham|1y=1999|1p=19|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2006|2p=716}} Like Taylor, Frazer viewed magic negatively, describing it as "the bastard sister of science", arising from "one great disastrous fallacy".{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=19}}

Where Frazer differed from Taylor was in characterizing a belief in magic as a major stage in humanity's cultural development, describing it as part of a tripartite division in which "magic" came first, "religion" came second, and eventually "science" came third.{{sfnm|1a1=Cunningham|1y=1999|1p=19|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2006|2p=716|3a1=Davies|3y=2012|3p=16|4a1=Bailey|4y=2018|4pp=15–16}} For Frazer, all early societies started as believers in magic, with some of them moving away from this and into religion.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=20}} He believed that both magic and religion involved a belief in spirits but that they differed in the way that they responded to these spirits. For Frazer, magic "constrains or coerces" these spirits while religion focuses on "conciliating or propitiating them".{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=20}} He acknowledged that their common ground resulted in a cross-over of magical and religious elements in various instances; for instance he claimed that the [[sacred marriage]] was a fertility ritual which combined elements from both world-views.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|pp=20–21}}

Some scholars retained the evolutionary framework used by Frazer but changed the order of its stages; the German ethnologist [[Wilhelm Schmidt (linguist)|Wilhelm Schmidt]] argued that ''religion''—by which he meant [[monotheism]]—was the first stage of human belief, which later degenerated into both magic and [[polytheism]].{{sfn|Davies|2012|pp=18–19}} Others rejected the evolutionary framework entirely. Frazer's notion that magic had given way to religion as part of an evolutionary framework was later deconstructed by the folklorist and anthropologist [[Andrew Lang]] in his essay "Magic and Religion"; Lang did so by highlighting how Frazer's framework relied upon misrepresenting ethnographic accounts of beliefs and practiced among indigenous Australians to fit his concept of magic.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=17}}

===Functionalist approach===

The functionalist approach to defining magic is associated with the French [[sociology|sociologists]] [[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Emile Durkheim]].{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=716|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2012|2p=165}}
In this approach, magic is understood as being the theoretical opposite of religion.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|p=165}}

Mauss set forth his conception of "magic" in a 1902 essay, "A General Theory of Magic".{{sfnm|1a1=Davies|1y=2012|1p=18|2a1=Bailey|2y=2018|2p=16}} Mauss used the term ''magic'' in reference to "any rite that is not part of an organized cult: a rite that is private, secret, mysterious, and ultimately tending towards one that is forbidden".{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=716|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2012|2p=165}} Conversely, he associated religion with organised cult.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=47}} By saying that magic was inherently non-social, Mauss had been influenced by the traditional Christian understandings of the concept.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=717}} Mauss deliberately rejected the intellectualist approach promoted by Frazer, believing that it was inappropriate to restrict the term ''magic'' to sympathetic magic, as Frazer had done.{{sfnm|1a1=Cunningham|1y=1999|1p=47|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2006|2p=716}} He expressed the view that "there are not only magical rites which are not sympathetic, but neither is sympathy a prerogative of magic, since there are sympathetic practices in religion".{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=47}}

Mauss' ideas were adopted by Durkheim in his 1912 book ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=716|2a1=Davies|2y=2012|2p=17}} Durkheim was of the view that both magic and religion pertained to "sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden".{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=44}} Where he saw them as being different was in their social organisation. Durkheim used ''magic'' to describe things that were inherently anti-social, existing in contrast to what he referred to as a "Church," the religious beliefs shared by a social group; in his words, "There is no Church of magic."{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2012|1p=165|2a1=Davies|2y=2012|2pp=17–18}} Durkheim expressed the view that "there is something inherently anti-religious about the maneuvers of the magician",{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|p=165}} and that a belief in magic "does not result in binding together those who adhere to it, nor in uniting them into a group leading a common life."{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=44}}

Scholars have criticized the idea that magic and religion can be differentiated into two distinct, separate categories.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|pp=5–6}} The social anthropologist [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]] suggested that "a simple dichotomy between magic and religion" was unhelpful and thus both should be subsumed under the broader category of [[ritual]].{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=49}} Many later anthropologists followed his example.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=49}}
Nevertheless, this distinction is still often made by scholars discussing this topic.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|pp=5–6}}

===Emotionalist approach===
{{Further|Magical thinking|Psychological theories of magic}}
The emotionalist approach to magic is associated with the English anthropologist [[Robert Ranulph Marett]], the Austrian psychologist [[Sigmund Freud]], and the Polish anthropologist [[Bronisław Malinowski]].{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=23}}

Marett viewed magic as a response to stress.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=24}} In a 1904 article, he argued that magic was a cathartic or stimulating practice designed to relieve feelings of tension.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=24}} As his thought developed, he increasingly rejected the idea of a division between magic and religion and began to use the term "magico-religious" to describe the early development of both.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=24}} Malinowski understood magic in a similar manner to Marett, tackling the issue in a 1925 article.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|pp=28–29}} He rejected Frazer's evolutionary hypothesis that magic was followed by religion and then science as a series of distinct stages in societal development, arguing that all three were present in each society.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=29}} In his view, both magic and religion "arise and function in situations of emotional stress" although whereas religion is primarily expressive, magical is primarily practical.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=29}} He therefore defined magic as "a practical art consisting of acts which are only means to a definite end expected to follow later on".{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=29}} He for instance believed that fertility rituals were magical because they were carried out with the intention of meeting a specific need.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=29}} As part of his [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] approach, Malinowski saw magic not as irrational but as something that served a useful function, being sensible within the given social and environmental context.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=22}}

Freud also saw magic as emerging from human emotion but interpreted it very differently to Marett.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=25}}
Freud explains that "the associated theory of magic merely explains the paths along which magic proceeds; it does not explain its true essence, namely the misunderstanding which leads it to replace the laws of nature by psychological ones".{{sfn|Freud|Strachey|1950|p=83}} Freud emphasizes that what led primitive men to come up with magic is the power of wishes: "His wishes are accompanied by a motor impulse, the will, which is later destined to alter the whole face of the earth in order to satisfy his wishes. This motor impulse is at first employed to give a representation of the satisfying situation in such a way that it becomes possible to experience the satisfaction by means of what might be described as motor [[hallucination]]s. This kind of representation of a satisfied wish is quite comparable to children's play, which succeeds their earlier purely sensory technique of satisfaction. [...] As time goes on, the psychological accent shifts from the ''motives'' for the magical act on to the ''measures'' by which it is carried out—that is, on to the act itself. [...] It thus comes to appear as though it is the magical act itself which, owing to its similarity with the desired result, alone determines the occurrence of that result."{{sfn|Freud|Strachey|1950|p=84}}

In the early 1960s, the anthropologists Murray and Rosalie Wax put forward the argument that scholars should look at the "magical worldview" of a given society on its own terms rather than trying to rationalize it in terms of Western ideas about scientific knowledge.{{sfn|Davies|2012|pp=25–26}} Their ideas were heavily criticised by other anthropologists, who argued that they had set up a false dichotomy between non-magical Western worldview and magical non-Western worldviews.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=26}} The concept of the "magical worldview" nevertheless gained widespread use in history, folkloristics, philosophy, cultural theory, and psychology.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=27}}

According to [[Stanley Tambiah]], magic, science, and religion all have their own "quality of rationality", and have been influenced by politics and ideology.{{sfn|Tambiah|1991|p=2}} As opposed to religion, Tambiah suggests that mankind has a much more personal control over events. Science, according to Tambiah, is "a system of behavior by which man acquires mastery of the environment."{{sfn|Tambiah|1991|p=8}}

==Magicians==
[[File:Magician visconti.jpg|thumb|The "[[The Magician (Tarot card)|Magician]]" card from a 15th-century [[tarot deck]].]]

Many of the practices which have been labelled magic can be performed by anyone.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=85}} For instance, some charms can be recited by individuals with no specialist knowledge nor any claim to have having a specific power.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=85}} Others require specialised training in order to perform them.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=85}} Some of the individuals who performed magical acts on a more than occasional basis came to be identified as magicians, or with related concepts like sorcerers/sorceresses, [[witch]]es, or cunning folk.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=85}} Identities as a magician can stem from an individual's own claims about themselves, or it can be a label placed upon them by others.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=85}} In the latter case, an individual could embrace such a label, or they could reject it, sometimes vehemently.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=85}}

There can be economic incentives that encouraged individuals to identify as magicians.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=103}} In the cases of various forms of traditional healer, as well as the later stage magicians or illusionists, the label of magician could become a job description.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=85}} Others claim such an identity out of a genuinely held belief that they have specific unusual powers or talents.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=105}}

Some historians have drawn a differentiation between those practitioners who engage in high magic, and those who engage in low magic.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=40}} In this framework, high magic is seen as more complex, involving lengthy and detailed ceremonies as well as sophisticated, sometimes expensive, paraphernalia.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=40}} Low magic is associated with simpler rituals such as brief, spoken charms.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=40}}

In some cultures, terms such as ''sorcerer'', ''sorceress'', ''wizard'', ''witch'', etc. are applied to specific types of magicians based on their gender, abilities, sources of power, moral standing within the community, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Filotas|first1=Bernadette|title=Pagan Survivals, Superstitions, Popular Cultures|date=2005|publisher=Pontifical Inst. of Medieval Studies|location=Toronto|isbn=9780888441515|page=222|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qh1lrIM5nd4C&amp;pg=PA222&amp;lpg=PA222&amp;dq=classification+of+magicians#v=onepage&amp;q=classification%20of%20magicians&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of personal traits may be credited with giving magical power, and frequently they are associated with an unusual birth into the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glucklich|first1=Ariel|title=The End of Magic|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0195355239 |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the most common method of identifying, differentiating, and establishing magical practitioners from common people is by [[initiation]]. By means of rites the magician's relationship to the supernatural and his entry into a closed professional class is established (often through rituals that simulate death and rebirth into a new life).{{sfn|Mauss|Bain|Pocock|2007|pp=41–44}}
Mauss argues that the powers of both specialist and common magicians are determined by culturally accepted standards of the sources and the breadth of magic: a magician cannot simply invent or claim new magic. In practice, the magician is only as powerful as his peers believe him to be.{{sfn|Mauss|Bain|Pocock|2007|p=33, 40}}

Throughout recorded history, magicians have often faced scepticism regarding their purported powers and abilities.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=49}} For instance, in sixteenth-century England, the writer [[Reginald Scot]] wrote ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'', in which he argued that many of those accused of witchcraft or otherwise claiming magical capabilities were fooling people using illusionism.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=51}}

===Suspicions and accusations of witchcraft===
{{See also|Witchcraft}}

Those regarded as being magicians have often faced suspicion from other members of their society.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=68}} This is particularly the case if these perceived magicians have been associated with social groups already considered morally suspect in a particular society, such as foreigners, women, or the lower classes.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=71}} In contrast to these negative associations, many practitioners of activities that have been labelled magical have emphasised that their actions are benevolent and beneficial.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|pp=71–2}} This conflicted with the common Christian view that all activities categorised as being forms of magic were intrinsically bad regardless of the intent of the magician, because all magical actions relied on the aid of demons.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=72}} There could be conflicting attitudes regarding the practices of a magician; in European history, authorities often believed that cunning folk and traditional healers were harmful because their practices were regarded as magical and thus stemming from contact with demons, whereas a local community might value and respect these individuals because their skills and services were deemed beneficial.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=90}}

In Western societies, the practice of magic, especially when harmful, was usually associated with women.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=92}} For instance, during the witch trials of the early modern period, around three quarters of those executed as witches were female, to only a quarter who were men.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=93}} That women were more likely to be accused and convicted of witchcraft in this period might have been because their position was more legally vulnerable, with women having little or no legal standing that was independent of their male relatives.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=93}} The conceptual link between women and magic in Western culture may be because many of the activities regarded as magical—from rites to encourage fertility to potions to induce [[abortion]]s—were associated with the female sphere.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=94}} It might also be connected to the fact that Western cultures regularly portrayed women as being inferior to men on an intellectual, moral, spiritual, and physical level.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=96}}

Major temples inhabited by a divine triad could be completed by a [[peristyle]]-surrounded mammisi, in which the goddess of the triad would give birth to the son of the triad itself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The son, whose divine birth was celebrated annually, was associated with the Pharaoh (even in the [[Hieros gamos|hierogamy]] scenes on the walls).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Taweret]], [[Raet-Tawy]] and the Seven [[Hathor]]s who presided over [[childbirth]] were particularly revered here, but it is equally common to find references to [[Bes]], [[Khnum]] and [[Osiris]] himself as [[List of fertility deities|fertility deities]]. Mammisis thus formed an [[Architecture|architectural]] translation of the myth of divine birth and its eternal repetition. From the end of the Late Period these buildings confirm the restoration of [[Monarchy|royal power]] that each [[List of ancient Egyptian dynasties|dynasty]] will strive to assert in the very heart of the great sanctuaries of the country — including the Roman emperors.

Equipped with a [[hypostyle]] by Pharaoh [[Ptolemy VI Philometor]] (181–145 BC) and with a peristyle by [[Ptolemy X Alexander I]] (110–88 BC), it was dedicated to Harsiese ("Horus son of [[Isis]]").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This 30th dynasty project was then repeated, by the Græco-Roman rulers, for some of the major shrines in the country.

The famous Roman mammisi — the less ancient one associated with the Dendera Temple complex — was built by [[Augustus]] immediately after [[Battle of Actium|his conquest of Egypt]] (31 BC). The murals show Augustus' far successor [[Trajan]] at the sacrificial ceremony for Hathor and are among the most beautiful in Egypt. The mammisi was dedicated to Hathor and her child [[Ihy]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On the [[Abacus (architecture)|abacus]] above the pillar capitals are representations of Bes as the patron god of birth.  &lt;gallery mode="nolines" widths="200" heights="160"&gt;

A '''mascot race''' is a promotional [[sports entertainment]] or charity competition consisting of costumed runners racing around a [[baseball field]] or race course, usually as a form of between-innings entertainment. The racers are typically [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] inanimate objects or [[mascot]]s related to local culture, a sponsor's products, or sport culture. The outcomes of races can both be decided in a legitimate race or may be predetermined for purely entertainment purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10170/1066854-63.stm|title=Out at the plate: Pirates dump outspoken pierogi|author=|date=|work=post-gazette.com|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's largest ever mascot race was the Sue Ryder Mascot Gold Cup held at Wetherby Racecourse in West Yorkshire, United Kingdom, on April 26 2015. The race featured 131 mascots with 125 of them completing the {{Convert|1|km|mi}} distance and becoming the new [[Guinness World Record]] for most mascots in a race.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/375286-largest-mascot-race|title=Largest mascot race|work=Guinness World Records|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winning mascot was the Red Marauder entered by the Ingmanthorpe Racing Stables and helped to victory by Scottish international footballer Gary McAllistair.&lt;ref name=Weatherby&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wetherbynews.co.uk/news/mascot-record-tumbles-at-wetherby-races-1-7233478|title=Mascot record tumbles at Wetherby races|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Races==

===Major League Baseball===
[[File:Presidents Racing.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Washington Nationals]]' racing presidents]]
[[File:Cleveland Indians Hot Dog Race.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cleveland Indians]]' racing hot dogs]]
The best known{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} of this type of race is the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]' [[Sausage Race]]. Introduced in the early 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.klements.com/racing_sausages/all_started.html&lt;/ref&gt; the race features [[bratwurst]], Polish sausage, Italian sausage, hot dog, and [[chorizo]] characters. The race takes place before the sixth inning of every home game. Players have also been involved; during a 2003 race during a Brewers–[[Pittsburgh Pirates]] game, Pirates slugger [[Randall Simon]] hit one of the sausages with a [[baseball bat]], causing the woman in the costume to require medical care. Milwaukee police fined Simon. The incident subsequently became known as "[[Sausage Race#Randall Simon incident|Sausagegate]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/sausagegate/030710.html|title=ESPN.com - Page2 - Police report: Sausagegate|author=|date=|work=go.com|access-date=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sausage Race inspired the creation of the [[Great Pierogi Race]] in Pittsburgh. A rivalry has developed between the Sausages and the Pierogies, and the two groups compete twice yearly in relay races. Another well known{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} mascot race is the [[Presidents Race]] of the [[Washington Nationals]]. [[George Washington]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and [[William Howard Taft]] mascots compete. As a [[Running gag|running joke]], Teddy Roosevelt did not win until the Nationals made the playoffs for the first time in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.letteddywin.com/presidents-race-standings/|title=Presidents Race Standings|author=|date=April 7, 2016|work=letteddywin.com|access-date=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Milwaukee Sausages, the Presidents also have a rivalry with the Pierogies.

Other teams have their own versions. The [[Tampa Bay Rays]] have a race sponsored by [[PepsiCo]], the owners of the naming rights to [[Tropicana Field]]. Their race is between large bottles of [[Pepsi]], [[Pepsi Max]], [[Aquafina]], and [[Sierra Mist]]. Before 2007, these were computer-generated. As of 2010, the race is only computer-generated for certain games.

The  [[Cleveland Indians]] and the [[Kansas City Royals]] have similar races involving [[hot dogs]]. The Royals' version features live runners dressed as [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]] condiments – ketchup, relish and mustard. The live racers made their first appearance during the 2007 season, with the race being limited to the video board prior to this.  The Indians also started a live hot dog race in 2007 with the racers being mustard, onion, and ketchup (who wears thick glasses as a nod to [[Charlie Sheen]]'s "Wild Thing" character from the movie ''[[Major League (film)|Major League]]''). In late 2007 the ketchup racer started cutting the corner at home plate to win the race, and this "cheating" has led to several stage skits by players, mascots, and the ground crew to slow or trip him up during the race.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The  [[New York Mets]] race cardboard automobiles. As of May 29, 2016, they include an anthropomorphized police car, fire truck, yellow cab and black limo. As of May 29, 2016, Freddie the Firetruck leads the 2016 series with 9 wins, including the two most recent Sunday races. 

[[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] games feature a live action version of the "Dot Race", in which three dots (Red, Green, and Blue) compete in the middle of the sixth inning. Each fan is given a coupon for [[Ozarka]] bottled water (the race sponsor) that has one of the three colors. A coupon with the "winning color" can be taken to a [[Texas]] store to purchase [[Ozarka]] (in actuality, the coupons do not feature the date they were presented, thus any coupon can be redeemed at any time prior to their expiration date).  The "dots" were later joined by three action figures, all resembling figures in Texas history ([[Davy Crockett]] with his long rifle, [[Jim Bowie]] with his [[Bowie knife]], and [[Sam Houston]]).

The [[Atlanta Braves]] race involves (Atlanta-based) [[Home Depot]]'s hammer, saw (later replaced by a bucket after suffering a serious injury), paint brush, and power drill racing against each other. Before the 2009 season, the race was seen only on the scoreboard, but it now features live runners dressed in costumed versions of these tools; the race takes place on the warning track and starts in right field and ends in front of the scoreboard.

In 2009 the [[San Francisco Giants]] featured periodically a bobble head race with likenesses of announcers [[Duane Kuiper]] and [[Mike Krukow]], but they only occasionally raced in 2009.

The [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] dress three children up in hot dog suits – one representing ketchup, one representing mustard and one representing relish. The three kids run in place in front of the Diamondbacks' dugout while the scoreboard shows a race between the three hot dogs.  The winner receives a prize for their victory.

The [[Houston Astros]]' race involves [[Taco Bell]] hot sauce packets named Fire, Hot, and Mild that race from the right field corner around the outfield and up to the visitors' dugout. This race started in 2010, but starting in the 2015 season the Astros introduced their new race, the Space Race, featuring three dressed in astronauts costume; they are Apollo, Squeeze, and Doc Rocket. Also in 2010, the Arizona Diamondbacks added a "Legends Race&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/ari/fan_forum/legends_race.jsp|title=Legends Race|author=|date=|work=mlb.com|access-date=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;" with {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}} likenesses of [[Randy Johnson]], [[Mark Grace]], [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]] and [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]]. The race debuted on July 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20100621&amp;content_id=11435062&amp;vkey=pr_ari&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=ari D-backs Reveal Johnson, Gonzalez as First Members of Legends Race], ''arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com'', June 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Diamondbacks previously had a race between live runners dressed as menu items from fast-food chain and sponsor Taco Bell, including a giant cup of [[Pepsi]].  The Mark Grace figure finally won his first race August 8, 2015, on the day Randy Johnson's number was retired; Johnson let him pass him for the win. Mark Grace won another race on October 3, leading the race from beginning to end.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In 2012, the [[Minnesota Twins]] introduced “The Race at Target Field” mascot race—an evolution of their "Race to Target Field" animated video race which began in 2009 for the inaugural season of [[Target Field]]. The race features five Minnesota-inspired characters: Louie the loon, Wanda the walleye, Babe the blue ox, Skeeta the mosquito and Bullseye the dog (mascot of hometown company and sponsor, [[Target Corporation]]).

Also in 2012, the [[Miami Marlins]] added the Great Sea race featuring Bob the Shark, Julio the Octopus, Angel the Stone Crab and Spike the Sea Dragon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/lists/major-league-baseball-competitive-racing-mascots-gallery-032711#photo-title=The%20Great%20Sea%20Race%252C%20Marlins&amp;photo=30991122|title=MLB's racing mascots|first=Fox|last=Sports|date=|work=foxsports.com|access-date=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, 2013, the [[Oakland Athletics]] held the first Hall of Famer Big Head race, featuring mascot versions of [[Rickey Henderson]], [[Rollie Fingers]], and [[Dennis Eckersley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://baseballhall.org/discover/short-stops/oakland-athletics-mascot-race|title=Off to the Races|work=baseballhall.org|access-date=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, it is still being run at home games.

'''''Mind''''' is a quarterly [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published by [[Oxford University Press]] on behalf of the [[Mind Association]]. Having previously published exclusively [[philosophy]] in the [[Analytic philosophy|analytic tradition]], it now "aims to take quality to be the sole criterion of publication, with no area of philosophy, no style of philosophy, and no school of philosophy excluded."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://academic.oup.com/mind/pages/About |title=About the journal |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its institutional home is shared between the [[University of Oxford]] and [[University College London]].

==History and profile==
The journal was established in 1876 by the Scottish philosopher [[Alexander Bain]] ([[University of Aberdeen]])&lt;ref name=bret&gt;{{cite journal|author=D. Brett King et. al.|title=History of Sport Psychology in Cultural Magazines of the Victorian Era|journal=The Sport Psychologist|date=1995|volume=9|url=http://journals.humankinetics.com/AcuCustom/Sitename/Documents/DocumentItem/8296.pdf|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his colleague and former student [[George Croom Robertson]] ([[University College London]]) as [[editor-in-chief]]. With the death of Robertson in 1891, [[George Stout]] took over the editorship and began a 'New Series'. Early on, the journal was dedicated to the question of whether psychology could be a legitimate natural science. In the first issue, Robertson wrote:

{{quote|Now, if there were a journal that set itself to record all advances in psychology, and gave encouragement to special researches by its readiness to publish them, the uncertainty hanging over the subject could hardly fail to be dispelled. Either psychology would in time pass with general consent into the company of the sciences, or the hollowness of its pretensions would be plainly revealed. Nothing less, in fact, is aimed at in the publication of ''Mind'' than to procure a decision of this question as to the scientific standing of psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, [http://fair-use.org/mind/1876/01/prefatory-words#e1p4 "Prefatory Words," ''Mind'', 1 (1): 1876, p. 3]; quoted at Alexander Klein, ''The Rise of Empiricism: William James, Thomas Hill Green, and the Struggle over Psychology,'' p. 92 {{cite web|url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/alex_klein/Scholarship.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104065835/http://individual.utoronto.ca/alex_klein/Scholarship.htm |archivedate=2007-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Throughout the 20th century, the journal was leading in the publishing of [[analytic philosophy]]. In 2015, under the auspices of its new editors-in-chief [[Lucy O'Brien (professor)|Lucy O'Brien]] (University College London) and [[A. W. Moore (philosopher)|Adrian William Moore]] (University of Oxford), it started accepting papers from all styles and schools of philosophy.

Many famous essays have been published in ''Mind'' by such figures as [[Charles Darwin]], [[J. M. E. McTaggart]] and [[Noam Chomsky]]. Three of the most famous, arguably, are [[Lewis Carroll]]'s "[[What the Tortoise Said to Achilles]]" (1895), [[Bertrand Russell]]'s "[[On Denoting]]" (1905), and [[Alan Turing]]'s "[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]" (1950), in which he first proposed the [[Turing test]].

'''Poor People's Campaign: A National Call for a Moral Revival''' is an American anti-poverty campaign led by [[William Barber II]] and [[Liz Theoharis]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-new-poor-peoples-campaign-wants-to-change-how-society-defines-morality/2017/12/05/d4524b68-d90d-11e7-b1a8-62589434a581_story.html|title=Opinion - A new Poor People’s Campaign wants to change how society defines morality|first=Katrina vanden|last=Heuvel|date=5 December 2017|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/5048917/poor-peoples-campaign-martin-luther-king/|title=Rev. Barber &amp; Rev. Theoharis: It's Time to Fight for America's Soul|author=|date=|website=Time|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals and mission ==
According to [[Jelani Cobb]], writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', the movement demands "federal and state living-wage laws, equity in education, an end to mass incarceration, a single-payer health-care system, and the protection of the right to vote."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/14/william-barber-takes-on-poverty-and-race-in-the-age-of-trump|title=William Barber Takes on Poverty and Race in the Age of Trump|last=Cobb|first=Jelani|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the campaign centers on connecting movements that seem to be interconnected, such as [[racism]], [[sexism]], anti-[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] policies, [[ableism]], and [[classism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://talkpoverty.org/2018/06/26/poor-peoples-campaign-just-getting-started/|title=The Poor People’s Campaign Is Just Getting Started|date=2018-06-26|work=Talk Poverty|access-date=2018-11-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign takes its name from the original 1968 [[Poor People's Campaign]], which was an effort to gain economic justice for [[Poverty in the United States|poor people in the United States]], organized by [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), and carried out under the leadership of [[Ralph Abernathy]] in the wake of [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|King's assassination]].&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

Rev. Barber has explained the movement saying, "This is about the [[Morality|moral]] center. This is about our humanity."&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; The campaign is supported by the [[International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace &amp; Agricultural Implement Workers of America, UAW v. Johnson Controls, Inc.|International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers of America]] (UAW).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blackpressusa.com/uaw-leader-on-civil-rights-and-black-labor/|title=UAW Leader on Civil Rights and Black Labor {{!}} {{!}} BlackPressUSA|website=www.blackpressusa.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 40 days of civil disobedience ==
They performed "40 days of coordinated action in the spring of 2018 at statehouses across the US", starting in May.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/15/poor-peoples-campaign-systemic-poverty-a-sin|title=America once fought a war against poverty – now it wages a war on the poor|first1=Reverend William|last1=Barber|first2=Dr Liz|last2=Theoharis|date=15 April 2018|website=the Guardian|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/02/a-new-poor-peoples-campaign/552503/|title=America’s Moral Malady|last=II|first=William J.

Rev. Barber said of the event, “This is not a commemoration of what happened 50 years ago. This is a reenactment and reinauguration.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/in-dc-the-poor-peoples-campaign-hits-50-and-looks-ahead/2018/06/23/16a6e08e-770e-11e8-9780-b1dd6a09b549_story.html?utm_term=.0c53c6af6995|title=In D.C., the Poor People’s Campaign hits 50 and looks ahead|last=Thebault|first=Reis|date=June 23, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] decision determining that purging inactive [[Ohio]] voters from the registration lists is constitutional in ''[[Husted v. Randolph Institute]]'', Rev. Barber and Rev. Theoharis were arrested and detained for 26 hours at the Supreme Court. A week prior, Dr. Theoharis was arrested in [[Lansing, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/06/the-return-of-the-poor-peoples-campaign.html|title=The Return of the Poor People’s Campaign|last=Stieb|first=Matt|work=Intelligencer|access-date=2018-11-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 21, the campaign hung two banners on both sides of a raised stage at the National Mall that read, "Fight Poverty Not The Poor".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Within the 40 days, more than 2,000 people were arrested nationwide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Protesters stopped traffic and petitioned state legislatives. and performed more acts of direct action.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Comparisons to the 1960s Poor People's Campaign ==
Rev. Barber has stated, “We have these mythologies about the civil rights movement, about what it took to bring about change in America, but none of that happened overnight. You need to have a long-term vision. This right here, this is only our foundation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/50-years-later-the-new-poor-peoples-campaign-lays-out-a-political-strategy-beyond-its-washington-rally/2018/06/22/bd2c38a2-7626-11e8-805c-4b67019fcfe4_story.html|title=50 years later, the new Poor People’s Campaign lays out a political strategy beyond its Washington rally|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pratishakhyas''' ({{lang-sa|प्रातिशाख्य}} ''{{IAST|prātiśākhya}}''), collectively constituting four treatises, are the earliest of the [[Shiksha]]s:  works dealing with the [[phonetic]] aspects of the  [[Sanskrit]] language used in [[Vedas]]. These works mainly pertain to euphonic permutation and combination of letters and special characteristics of their pronunciation as they prevailed in various schools of Vedic studies.

==Rig Veda==
One of the Pratisakhyas deal with the phonetic aspects of the [[Rig Veda]]. The work is generally ascribed to be written by [[Shaunaka]], an ancient [[rishi]] (sage). It has been translated into [[German language|German]] by [[Max Müller]]. A [[French language|French]] translation done by M. Regnier is also available.

==Yajur Veda==
There are two treatises dealing with phonetic and related aspects of the [[Yajur Veda]]. The first, commonly known as the ''Krishna (Black) Yajur'',  is known as ''Taittriya Pratisakhya''.  Its translation done by Professor Whitney is also available, and the same has been published in the Journal of the [[American Oriental Society]]. The second treatise is commonly called the ''Shukla (White) Yajur'', and is known as ''Vajasaneyi Pratisakhya''. The later is believed to have been written by Katyayana. Its translation done by Weber is available.

==Atharva Veda==
The treatise pertaining to the phonetic and other aspects of [[Atharva Veda]] is also ascribed to the sage [[Saunaka]], and derives its name from him: the ''Saunakiya Chaturadhyayika'', which means the Book having four chapters by Saunak. Whitney has translated the work into English.

==Sama Veda==
The name of the pratisakhya belonging to Sama Veda is Rk Tantra. Most of the mantras in Sama Veda are either from the Rk Veda or adapted from it, though sung differently. Hence the name Rk Tantra. The book is available.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4680">'''Research Committee on Sociology of Law''' (RCSL) was established in 1962 by [[William M. Evan]] ([[University of Pennsylvania]]) and [[Adam Podgórecki]] ([[University of Warsaw]]), with the support of [[Renato Treves]] ([[University of Milan]]) during the Congress of the [[International Sociological Association]] (ISA), which was held in Weshington D. C. Treves was elected as the first president of the RCSL, Podgórecki as the vice-president and Evan as the Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_intro.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The RCSL aimed at "opening up a broader
range of opportunities for the participation of individual members in the activities of
the Association in the field of [[sociology of law]]".&lt;ref&gt;The RCSL Statutes (as modified in July 2009) are available at http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_Statutes_2009.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

The RCSL was initially formed as a largely informal forum to encourage and facilitate exchanges between sociologists of law from different countries. A Board was created in 1968, formal by-laws were adopted in 1973, and regular election were organised once every fourth year.&lt;ref&gt;The RCSL Statutes (as modified in July 2009) are available at http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_Statutes_2009.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The RCSL also holds annual meetings, occasionally together with other similar associations such as the Law and Society Associations or the Socio-Legal Studies Association.&lt;ref&gt;See the editoria by Johannes Feest, on the 40th anniversary of RCSL in RCSL Newsletter, Summer Issue 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The annual meetings are often devoted to specific theoretical and methodological themes, but space is reserved for organising sessions on general topics. The selection of themes and the call for papers are the responsibility of the RCSL Board and is carried out in cooperation with the local organising committee. The RCSL Board encourages countries not represented by its Board members to participate and to submit suggestions for organising its annual meetings.

Since the late 1960s, RCSL has supported the formation of permanent Working Groups, which focus on various research areas such as Comparative Studies of Legal Professions, Social and Legal Systems, Comparative Legal Cultures, Gender, Law and Politics, Law and Urban Space, Family and Human Rights, in order to promote research in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;For a complete list of Working Groups see: http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_wg.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 December 1988, the RCSL signed an agreement with Government of the Basque Country creating the [[International Institute for the Sociology of Law]] in [[Oñati]] which is located in the province of [[Guipúzcoa]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] in the north of [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;See RCSL, ''30 Years for the Sociology of Law'', Oñati, IISL, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:University Onate.JPG|right|thumb|The University of Oñati which houses the International Institute for the Sociology of Law.]]

Since its establishment in 1962, the RCSL has contributed to the development of the [[Sociology of law]] by systematically promoting social scientific research about law, legal institutions and legal systems. For more information see the section on [[Sociology of law]] and the [[International Institute for the Sociology of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;For a worldwide overview of socio-legal scholarship, produced in the late 1980s, see Ferrari, Vincenzo (ed.), ''Developing Sociology of Law. A World-Wide Documentary Enquiry'', Milano, Giuffré, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Masayuki Murayama (Japan) is currently the President of the RCSL. Previous Presidents include Vittorio Olgiati (Italy), Anne Boigeol (France), [[Lawrence Friedman]] (Stanford, USA), Johannes Feest (Bremen, Germany), Rogelio Perez Perdomo (IESA, Caracas, Venezuela), Mavis Maclean (Oxford, UK), Vincenzo Ferrari (Degli Studi Milano, Italy), Jean van Houtte (Belgian), Jan Glastra Van Loon (the Netherlands) and Renato Treves (Italy).

'''Adam Podgórecki Prize'''

"In honour and memory of the lifetime achievements of [[Adam Podgórecki]] and his place in the history of RCSL, the Board of RCSL established the annual RCSL Adam Podgórecki Prize at its meeting in 2004. The Prize is awarded for outstanding achievements in socio-legal research, either in the form of distinguished and outstanding lifetime achievements in one year or in the form of outstanding scholarship of a socio-legal researcher at an earlier stage of his or her career, in the next year of the award."&lt;ref&gt;For more information see ee http://www.isa-sociology.org/rc12_prize.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the journal has a 2016 [[impact factor]] of 0.667. It is also indexed by [[Scopus]] with 2016 CiteScore 0.39, SCImago Journal Rank 0.215, and [[Source normalized impact per paper]] (SNIP) 0.931.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scopus.com/sourceid/7100153146|title=Scopus preview – Scopus – Review of Central and East European Law|last=|first=|date=|website=www.scopus.com|publisher=|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=7100153146&amp;tip=sid|title=Review of Central and East European Law|website=www.scimagojr.com|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RCEEL is a leading academic journal  in its field. It offers a forum for discussion of topical questions of public and private law from domestic, regional, and international perspectives. It encourages comparative research; it is hoped that, in this way, additional insights in legal developments can be communicated to those interested in questions, not only of law, but also of politics, economics, and of society of countries in the region.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3852">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Roman de la Rose'' Digital Library}}
The '''''Roman de la Rose'' Digital Library'''  (''Rose'' DL) is a joint project of the [[Johns Hopkins University#Libraries|Sheridan Libraries]] of the [[Johns Hopkins University]] and the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]. The goal of the ''Rose'' DL is to create an online library of all manuscripts containing the 13th-century poem ''[[Roman de la Rose]]''. The library currently displays digital surrogates of more than 140 ''Roman de la Rose'' manuscripts, and the collection continues to grow. The entire collection is freely available to the public for scholarly research and personal use.

==History==
This project first began in 1996 when [http://grll.jhu.edu/french/bios/stephen-nichols/ Stephen G. Nichols], James M. Beall Professor of French and Chair of the [http://grll.jhu.edu/ Romance Languages and Literatures Department] at Johns Hopkins University, approached staff at the Milton S. Eisenhower Library about digitizing ''Roman de la Rose'' manuscripts for teaching purposes. After receiving funding from Ameritech Library Services, the [http://www.getty.edu/grants/ Getty Grant Program], the [http://www.kressfoundation.org/ Samuel H. Kress Foundation], and the [http://www.delmas.org/ Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation], the Eisenhower Library created the prototype ''Roman de la Rose: Digital Surrogates of Medieval Manuscripts'', which came to include six ''Rose'' manuscripts from various libraries in the US and UK. The original library contained manuscripts from the [[Walters Art Museum]] in Baltimore, the [[Morgan Library]] in New York, the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] in Los Angeles, and the [[Bodleian Library]] in Oxford.

In 2007, the Bibliothèque nationale de France and the ''Rose'' DL began a partnership to digitize all the ''Rose'' manuscripts held in Paris and in municipal and university libraries in France for the site. With funding from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], this joint project makes available about half of the roughly 300 ''Rose'' manuscripts known to be extant.

==Features==
All page images in the digital library may be viewed in a page turner application or in an image browsing format. Researchers may pan on a page or zoom down to a high degree of magnification. In addition to the images themselves, the ''Rose'' DL provides metadata that supports the research process. Many of the manuscripts have detailed manuscript descriptions that provide information about the history of the manuscript and about its physical characteristics such as binding, quire structure, material, and decoration. Full transcriptions exist for a few manuscripts and illustration descriptions are available for many.

It is often difficult to find the same narrative section in multiple manuscripts since they differ in line length, number of columns, and number of lines on a leaf. To get around this, the ''Rose'' DL includes a [http://romandelarose.org/#sections narrative sections tool] that approximates the start and finish of each section. These are usually accurate to within two columns.

'''Saraain El Faouqa'''  ({{lang-ar|سرعين الفوقا }})   is a village located {{convert|6|km|mi}} northeast of [[Rayak]] in [[Baalbek District]], [[Baalbek-Hermel Governorate]], [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=L.

Catholique}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==

There is an archaeological site located on the right of the road from Rayak, immediately before the village. It was discovered by [[Henri Fleisch]] in 1946 and mentioned by L. Burkhalter in a list of prehistoric sites published in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Burkhalter, L., Bibliographie préhistorique - Inventaire, Bulletin du Musée Beyrouth, Volume 8, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; Various small bifaces, flakes and cores were found that were originally assessed to be [[Mousterian]] by Burkhalter. Fleisch was said to ''"deplore the lack of [[typology (archaeology)|typology]]"'' to distinguish the [[Assemblage (archaeology)|assemblage]], but suggested some pieces were similar to [[Levalloiso-Mousterian]] and the [[Shepherd Neolithic]] tools found at [[Rayak North]] and [[Fleywe]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"/&gt;

==Roman Temple, quarry and tombs==
The village of Sarain El Faouqa is suggested to have been build on the remains of a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[quarry]]. There is a [[Roman temple]] on the left within the village that is included in a group of [[Temples of the Beqaa Valley]]. There are also numerous rock-cut tombs visible nearby. Although the walls of the temple [[cella]] have long since disappeared, the podium still remains. Further remains were found when a house that had been built on the temple was demolished, revealing part of a cast door frame, a block from the ceiling and parts of a column base and shaft.&lt;ref name="Taylor1971"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Taylor|title=The Roman temples of Lebanon: a pictorial guide.

'''Social media''' are interactive [[Computer-mediated communication|computer-mediated]] technologies that facilitate the creation and sharing of [[information]], ideas, career interests and other forms of expression via [[Virtual community|virtual communities]] and [[social network|network]]s.&lt;ref name="Kietzmann" /&gt; The variety of stand-alone and built-in social media services currently available introduces challenges of definition; however, there are some common features:&lt;ref name="SMDefinition"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Obar |first1=Jonathan A. |last2=Wildman |first2=Steve |title=Social media definition and the governance challenge: An introduction to the special issue |journal=Telecommunications Policy |date=2015 |volume=39 |issue=9 |pages=745–750 |doi=10.1016/j.telpol.2015.07.014 |ssrn=2647377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Users typically access social media services via [[World Wide Web|web-based]] technologies on [[desktop computer|desktop]]s and [[laptop]]s, or [[download]] services that offer social media functionality to their mobile devices (e.g., [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer|tablet]]s). When engaging with these services, users can create highly interactive platforms through which individuals, communities, and organizations can share, co-create, discuss, and modify user-generated content or pre-made content posted online. They "introduce substantial and pervasive changes to communication between organizations, communities, and individuals."&lt;ref name="Kietzmann"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kietzmann |first=Jan H. |author2=Kristopher Hermkens |title=Social media?

These changes are the focus of the emerging fields of [[technoself]] studies. Social media differ from paper-based media (e.g., magazines and newspapers) to traditional electronic media such as [[TV broadcasting]] in many ways, including quality,&lt;ref name="qualitymedia"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Agichtein |first=Eugene |author2=Carlos Castillo.

Some of the most popular social media websites are [[Facebook]] (and its associated [[Facebook Messenger]]), [[Instagram]], [[WhatsApp]], [[Google+]], [[Myspace]], [[LinkedIn]], [[Pinterest]], [[Snapchat]], [[Tumblr]], [[Twitter]], [[Viber]], [[VK (social networking)|VK]], [[WeChat]], [[Sina Weibo|Weibo]], [[Baidu Tieba]], and [[Wikia]]. These social media websites have more than 100,000,000 registered users.

Observers have noted a range of positive and negative impacts of social media use. Social media can help to improve an individual's sense of connectedness with real or online communities, and can be an effective communication (or marketing) tool for corporations, entrepreneurs, nonprofit organizations, advocacy groups, political parties, and governments. At the same time, concerns have been raised about possible links between heavy social media use and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and even the issues of [[cyberbullying]], online [[harassment]] and "[[Internet troll|trolling]]". Currently, about half of young adults have been [[Cyberbullying|cyberbullied]], and of those, 20% said that they have been cyberbullied regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cyberbullying Statistics |url=https://nobullying.com/cyber-bullying-statistics-2014/ |website=NObullying.com |accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another survey in the U.S. applied the Precaution Process Adoption Model to cyberbullying on Facebook among 7th grade students. According to this study, 69% of 7th grade students claim to have experienced cyberbullying, and they also said that it was worse than face-to-face bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chapin |first=John |year=2016 |title=Adolescents and Cyber Bullying: The Precaution Adoption Process Model |journal=Education and Information Technologies |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=719–728 |doi=10.1007/s10639-014-9349-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the bully and the victim are negatively affected, and the intensity, duration, and frequency of bullying are the three aspects that increase the negative effects on both of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peebles|first=E|date=2014|title=Cyberbullying: Hiding behind the screen.|url=|journal=Pediatrics Child Health.|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Interface Message Processor Front Panel.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Front panel of the late-1960s-era [[ARPANET]] Interface Message Processor.]]
Social media may have been influenced by the 1840s introduction of the telegraph in the US, which connected the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  [[ARPANET]], which first came online in 1967, had by the late 1970s developed a rich cultural exchange of non-government/business ideas and communication, as clearly evidenced by [[ARPANET#Rules and etiquette]]'s "A 1982 handbook on computing at MIT's AI Lab stated regarding network etiquette," and fully met the current definition of the term "social media" found in this article. The [[PLATO system]] launched in 1960, which was developed at the [[University of Illinois]] and subsequently commercially marketed by [[Control Data Corporation]], offered early forms of social media with 1973-era innovations such as Notes, PLATO's message-forum application; TERM-talk, its instant-messaging feature; [[Talkomatic]], perhaps the first online chat room; News Report, a crowd-sourced online newspaper and blog; and Access Lists, enabling the owner of a notesfile or other application to limit access to a certain set of users, for example, only friends, classmates, or co-workers. [[Tom Truscott]] and [[Jim Ellis (computing)|Jim Ellis]] conceived the idea of [[Usenet]] in 1979 at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and [[Duke University]], and it was established in 1980.
[[File:The IMP Log The Very First Message Sent on the Internet (6293913865).jpg|thumb|right|200px|IMP log for the first message sent over the Internet, using ARPANET.]]
[[Usenet]], which arrived in 1979, was beat by a precursor of the electronic [[bulletin board system]] (BBS) known as [[Community Memory]] in 1973.  True electronic bulletin board systems arrived with the Computer Bulletin Board System in Chicago, which first came online on 16 February 1978.  Before long, most major cities had more than one BBS running on [[TRS-80]], [[Apple II]], [[Atari Corporation|Atari]], [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Sinclair Research|Sinclair]], and similar [[personal computer]]s. The IBM PC was introduced in 1981, and subsequent models of both Mac computers and PCs were used throughout the 1980s.  Multiple modems, followed by specialized telecommunication hardware, allowed many users to be online simultaneously.  [[Compuserve]], [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]] and [[AOL]] were three of the largest BBS companies and were the first to migrate to the Internet in the 1990s.  Between the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s, BBSes numbered in the tens of thousands in North America alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  Message forums (a specific structure of social media) arose with the BBS phenomenon throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.  When the Internet proliferated in the mid-1990s, message forums migrated online, becoming [[Internet forum]]s, primarily due to cheaper per-person access as well as the ability to handle far more people simultaneously than telco modem banks.

[[GeoCities]] was one of the Internet's earliest social networking websites, appearing in November 1994, followed by [[Classmates.com|Classmates]] in December 1995, [[SixDegrees.com|Six Degrees]] in May 1997, [[Open Diary]] in October 1998, [[LiveJournal]] in April 1999, [[Ryze]] in October 2001, [[Friendster]] in March 2002, [[LinkedIn]] in May 2003, [[hi5]] in June 2003, [[MySpace]] in August 2003, [[Orkut]] in January 2004, [[Facebook]] in February 2004, [[Yahoo! 360°]] in March 2005, [[Bebo]] in July 2005, [[Twitter]] in July 2006, [[Tumblr]] in February 2007, and [[Google+]] in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; As [[operating system]]s with a [[graphical user interface]], such as [[Windows 95]] and [[classic Mac OS|Mac OS]] begin to emerge and gain popularity, this created an environment that allows for early social media platforms to thrive and exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/windows-95-remains-most-popular-operating-system/|title=Windows 95 remains most popular operating system|website=CNET|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/us/news/software/operating-systems/happy-birthday-windows-95-the-os-that-changed-it-all-711984|title=Happy birthday, Windows 95 - the OS that changed it all|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and classification==

The variety of evolving stand-alone and built-in social media services makes it challenging to define them.&lt;ref name="SMDefinition" /&gt; However, marketing and social media experts broadly agree that social media includes the following 13 types of social media: [[blog]]s, [[Professional network service|business networks]], collaborative projects, [[Enterprise social networking|enterprise social networks]], [[Internet forum|forums]], [[Microblogging|microblogs]], [[photo sharing]], [[Review site|products/services review]], [[social bookmarking]], [[social network game|social gaming]], [[social network]]s, [[Video hosting service|video sharing]], and [[virtual world]]s.&lt;ref name="IJMR Article"/&gt;

The idea that social media are defined simply by their ability to bring people together has been seen as too broad, as this would suggest that fundamentally different technologies like the [[telegraph]] and [[telephone]] are also social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schejter |first1=A.M. |last2=Tirosh |first2=N. |title="Seek the meek, seek the just": Social media and social justice |journal=Telecommunications Policy |date=2015 |volume=39 |issue=9 |pages=796–803 |doi=10.1016/j.telpol.2015.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terminology is unclear, with some early researchers referring to social media as [[social network]]s or [[social networking service]]s in the mid 2000s.&lt;ref name="boydEllison"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00393.x |title=Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=210–30 |year=2007 |last1=boyd |first1=danah m. |last2=Ellison |first2=Nicole B. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent paper from 2015&lt;ref name="SMDefinition" /&gt; reviewed the prominent literature in the area and identified four common features unique to then-current social media services:

# social media are [[Web 2.0]] Internet-based applications,&lt;ref name="SMDefinition" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt;
# [[user-generated content]] (UGC) is the lifeblood of the social media organism,&lt;ref name="SMDefinition" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaplan /&gt;
# users create service-specific profiles for the site or app that are designed and maintained by the social media organization,&lt;ref name="SMDefinition" /&gt;&lt;ref name="boydEllison" /&gt; 
# social media facilitate the development of online [[social network]]s by connecting a user's profile with those of other individuals or groups.&lt;ref name="SMDefinition" /&gt;&lt;ref name="boydEllison" /&gt;

In 2016, [[Merriam-Webster]] defined social media as "forms of electronic communication (such as Web sites) through which people create online communities to share information, ideas, personal messages, etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/social%2520media |title=Dictionary and Thesaurus {{!}} Merriam-Webster |website=www.merriam-webster.com |access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Importance of social media for different corporate functions.png|thumb|Classification of social media and overview of how important different types of social media (e.g. [[blog]]s) are for each of a company's operational functions (e.g. [[marketing]])&lt;ref name='IJMR Article'&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Aichner, T. |author2=Jacob, F. |title=Measuring the Degree of Corporate Social Media Use |journal=International Journal of Market Research |date=March 2015 |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=257–275}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The development of social media started off with simple platforms such as sixdegrees.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kirkpatrick |first1=David |title=The Facebook effect: the real inside story of Mark Zuckerberg and the world's fastest-growing company |date=2011 |publisher=Virgin |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike instant messaging clients, such as ICQ and AOL's AIM, or chat clients like IRC, iChat or Chat Television, sixdegrees.com was the first online business that was created for real people, using their real names. The first social networks were short-lived, however, because their users lost interest. The Social Network Revolution has led to the rise of the networking sites. Research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nielsen Company |title=Social Networks Blogs Now Account for One in Every Four and a Half Minutes Online |url=http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2010/social-media-accounts-for-22-percent-of-time-online.html |website=Nielsen |accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that the audience spends 22% of their time on social networks, thus proving how popular social media platforms have become. This increase is because of the widespread daily use of smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://marketingland.com/facebook-usage-accounts-1-5-minutes-spent-mobile-171561 |title=Cell phones |last=Metzger |first=Justin |date=2016-04-04|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media are used to document memories, learn about and explore things, advertise oneself and form friendships as well as the growth of ideas from the creation of blogs, podcasts, videos and gaming sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Keeffe|first=Gwenn Schurgin|last2=Clarke-Pearson|first2=Kathleen|last3=Media|first3=Council on Communications and|date=2011-04-01|title=The Impact of Social Media on Children, Adolescents, and Families|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/4/800|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=127|issue=4|pages=800–804|doi=10.1542/peds.2011-0054|issn=0031-4005|pmid=21444588}}&lt;/ref&gt; Networked individuals create, edit, and manage content in collaboration with other networked individuals. This way they contribute in expanding knowledge. [[Wiki]]s are examples of collaborative content creation.

===Mobile social media===
[[File:Young people texting on smartphones using thumbs.JPG|thumb|The heavy usage of smartphones among young people relates to the significant percentage of social media users who are from this demographic.]]
Mobile social media refer to the use of social media on mobile devices such as [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer]]s. Mobile social media are a useful application of [[mobile marketing]] because the creation, exchange, and circulation of user-generated content can assist companies with marketing research, communication, and relationship development.&lt;ref name='mobileKaplan'&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kaplan |first=Andreas M. |title=If you love something, let it go mobile: Mobile marketing and mobile social media 4x4 |journal=Business Horizons |date=March–April 2012 |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=129–139 |doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2011.10.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile social media differ from others because they incorporate the current location of the user (location-sensitivity) or the time delay between sending and receiving messages (time-sensitivity). According to [[Andreas Kaplan]], mobile social media applications can be differentiated among four types:&lt;ref name='mobileKaplan' /&gt;

# ''Space-timers'' (location and time sensitive): Exchange of messages with relevance mostly for one specific location at one specific point in time (e.g. [[Facebook Places]] [[WhatsApp]]; [[Foursquare]])
# ''Space-locators'' (only location sensitive): Exchange of messages, with relevance for one specific location, which is tagged to a certain place and read later by others (e.g. [[Yelp, Inc.|Yelp]]; [[Qype]], [[Tumblr]], [[Fishbrain]])
# ''Quick-timers'' (only time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media applications to mobile devices to increase immediacy (e.g. posting [[Twitter]] messages or [[Facebook]] status updates)
# ''Slow-timers'' (neither location nor time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media applications to mobile devices (e.g. watching a [[YouTube]] video or reading/editing a [[Wikipedia]] article)

==Elements and function==

===Viral content===
Some social media sites have potential for content posted there to spread ''[[Viral phenomenon|virally]]'' over social networks. The term is an analogy to the concept of [[viral infections]], which can spread rapidly from person to person. In a social media context, content or websites that are "viral" (or which "go viral") are those with a greater likelihood that users will reshare content posted (by another user) to their social network, leading to further sharing. In some cases, posts containing popular content or fast-breaking news have been rapidly shared and reshared by a huge number of users. Many social media sites provide a specific functionality to help users reshare content, such as [[Twitter]]'s retweet button, [[Pinterest]]'s pin function, [[Facebook]]'s share option or [[Tumblr]]'s reblog function. [[Business]]es have a particular interest in [[viral marketing]] tactics because a viral campaign can achieve widespread advertising coverage (particularly if the viral reposting itself makes the news) for a fraction of the cost of a traditional marketing campaign, which typically uses printed materials, like newspapers, magazines, mailings, and billboards, and television and radio commercials. [[Nonprofit organization]]s and [[activist]]s may have similar interests in posting content on social media sites with the aim of it going viral. A popular component and feature of Twitter is retweeting. Twitter allows other people to keep up with important events, stay connected with their peers, and can contribute in various ways throughout social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint=1106.0346 |title=Entropy-based Classification of 'Retweeting' Activity on Twitter |last=Ghosh |first=Rumi |date=June 2011 |class=cs.SI}}&lt;/ref&gt; When certain posts become popular, they start to get [[Retweet|retweeted]] over and over again, becoming viral. Hashtags can be used in tweets, and can also be used to take count of how many people have used that hashtag.

===Bots ===
Social media can enable companies to get in the form of greater market share and increased audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castronovo|first=Cristina|date=2012|title=Social Media in Alternative Marketing Communication Model|url=|journal=Journal of Marketing Development &amp; Competitivness|volume=6|pages=117–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internet bot]]s have been developed which facilitate social media marketing has been developed.

Such accounts try to pose as real people; in particular, the number of their friends or followers should be resembling that of a real person. Often, such accounts use "friend farms" to collect a large number of friends in a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Romanov|first=Aleksei|author2=Alexander Semenov|author3=Jari Veijalainen|title=Revealing Fake Profiles in Social Networks by Longitudinal Data Analysis |journal=Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies|pages=51–58|date=2017|doi=10.5220/0006243900510058|isbn=978-989-758-246-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patents of social media technology===
{{main|Software patent}}
[[File:Soc-net-paten-growth-chart.png|thumb|Number of US social network patent applications published and patents issued per year since 2003. The chart shows that the number of [[software application]]s published (the green bars) increased steadily from 2003 to 2007, and then shot up from 2008 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ipwatchdog.com/2011/01/23/don't-steal-my-avatar-challenges-of-social-networking-patents/id=14531/ |title=Mark Nowotarski, "Do not Steal My Avatar!

There has been rapid growth in the number of US patent applications that cover new technologies related to social media, and the number of them that are published has been growing rapidly over the past five years. There are now over 2000 published patent applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&amp;r=0&amp;p=1&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;Query=spec%2F%22social+media%22&amp;d=PG01 |title=USPTO search on published patent applications mentioning "social media" |publisher=Appft.uspto.gov |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many as 7000 applications may be currently on file including those that haven't been published yet. Only slightly over 100 of these applications have issued as patents, however, largely due to the multi-year backlog in examination of [[business method patents]], patents which outline and claim new methods of doing business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=0&amp;p=1&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;Query=spec%2F%22social+media%22&amp;d=PTXT |title=USPTO search on issued patents mentioning "social media" |publisher=Patft.uspto.gov |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics on usage and membership==
[[File:Smartphone Zombies.png|thumb|Social media websites are popular on mobile devices such as [[smartphone]]s.]]

===Usage===
A survey conducted (in 2011), by Pew Internet Research, discussed in Lee Rainie and [[Barry Wellman]]'s ''Networked – The New Social Operating System'', illustrates that 'networked individuals' are engaged to a further extent regarding numbers of content creation activities and that the 'networked individuals' are increasing over a larger age span. These are some of the content creation activities that networked individuals take part in:

* writing material, such as text or online comments, on a social networking site such as Facebook: 65% of Internet users do this
* sharing [[digital photo]]s: 55%
* contributing rankings and reviews of products or services: 37%
* creating "tags" of content, such as tagging songs by genre: 33%
* posting comments on third-party websites or blogs: 26%
* taking online material and [[Mashup (culture)|remixing it into a new creation]]: 15% of Internet users do this with photos, video, audio, or text
* creating or working on a [[blog]]: 14%

Another survey conducted (in 2015) by Pew Internet Research shows that the Internet users among American adults who uses at least one social networking site has increased from 10% to 76% since 2005. Pew Internet Research illustrates furthermore that it nowadays is no real gender difference among Americans when it comes to social media usage. Women were even more active on social media a couple of years ago, however today's numbers point at women: 68%, and men: 62%.&lt;ref name="PIR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/08/social-networking-usage-2005-2015/ |title=Social Media Usage: 2005–2015 |first=Andrew |last=Perrin |date=8 October 2015 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, a 2018 survey reported that 88 percent of people 18-29 years old have at least one social media account&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/03/01/social-media-use-in-2018/|title=Social Media Use 2018: Demographics and Statistics {{!}} Pew Research Center|date=2018-03-01|work=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Over 60% of 13 to 17-year-olds have at least one profile on social media, with many spending more than two hours per day on social networking sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hajirnis|first=Aditi|date=2015-12-01|title=Social media networking: Parent guidance required|journal=The Brown University Child and Adolescent Behavior Letter|volume=31|issue=12|pages=1–7|doi=10.1002/cbl.30086}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nielsen, Internet users continue to spend more time on social media sites than on any other type of site. At the same time, the total time spent on social media sites in the U.S. across PCs as well as on mobile devices increased by 99 percent to 121 billion minutes in July 2012, compared to 66 billion minutes in July 2011.&lt;ref name="nielsen2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/social/2012/|title=State of the media: The social media report 2012|work=Featured Insights, Global, Media + Entertainment|publisher=Nielsen|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For content contributors, the benefits of participating in social media have gone beyond simply social sharing to building a reputation and bringing in career opportunities and monetary income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tang|first1=Qian|last2=Gu|first2=Bin|last3=Whinston|first3=Andrew B.|year=2012|title=Content Contribution for Revenue Sharing and Reputation in Social Media: A Dynamic Structural Model|journal=Journal of Management Information Systems|volume=29|issue=2|pages=41–75|doi=10.2753/mis0742-1222290203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use by organizations==

===Use by businesses===
{{Main|Social media use by businesses}}
Mobile social media tools can be used for [[marketing research]], communication, [[sales promotion]]s/discounts, informal employee learning/organizational development, relationship development/[[loyalty program]]s,&lt;ref name='mobileKaplan' /&gt; and e-Commerce. Other applications include [[marketing research]], communication, sales promotions and discounts, relationship development and loyalty programs, and informal employee learning/organizational development is facilitated by the social media.

Companies are increasingly using [[social media monitoring]] tools to monitor, track, and analyze online conversations on the Web about their brand or products or about related topics of interest. This can be useful in [[public relations]] management and [[advertising campaign]] tracking, allowing the companies to measure [[return on investment]] for their social media ad spending, competitor-auditing, and for public engagement. Tools range from free, basic applications to subscription-based, more in-depth tools.

Social media becomes effective through a process called "building social authority". One of the foundation concepts in social media has become that you cannot completely control your message through social media but rather you can simply begin to participate in the "conversation" expecting that you can achieve a significant influence in that conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mprcenter.org/blog/2010/08/04/research-survey-launched-social-media-and-influence-of-photos-on-body-image/ |title=Research Survey |publisher=Mprcenter.org |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social media mining===
{{main|Social media mining}}

Social media "mining" is a type of [[data mining]], a technique of [[data analysis|analyzing data]] to detect patterns. Social media mining is a process of representing, analyzing, and extracting actionable patterns from data collected from people's activities on social media. Google mines data in many ways including using an [[algorithm]] in [[Gmail]] to analyze information in emails. This use of information will then affect the type of advertisements shown to the user when they use Gmail. Facebook has partnered with many data mining companies such as [[Datalogix]] and [[BlueKai]] to use customer information for [[targeted advertising]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |url= http://journal.media-culture.org.au/index.php/mcjournal/article/viewArticle/625 |title= The Social Media Contradiction: Data Mining and Digital Death |last= Leaver |first= Tama |date=May 2013 |access-date=June 20, 2018 |journal= M/C Journal |volume= 16 |issue= 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethical questions of the extent to which a company should be able to utilize a user's information have been called "big data".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Users tend to click through Terms of Use agreements when signing up on social media platforms, and they do not know how their information will be used by companies. This leads to questions of privacy and surveillance when user data is recorded. Some social media outlets have added capture time and [[Geotagged|Geotagging]] that helps provide information about the context of the data as well as making their data more accurate.

Social media has a range of uses in political processes and activities.

Younger generations are becoming more involved in politics due to the increase of political news posted on social media. Due to the heavier use of social media among younger generations, they are exposed to politics more frequently, and in a way that is integrated into their online social lives. Social media was influential in the widespread attention given to the [[Arab Spring|revolutionary outbreaks in the Middle East and North Africa during 2011]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/01/tunisia/ |work=Wired |first1=Nate |last1=Anderson |first2=Ars |last2=Technica |title=Tweeting Tyrants Out of Tunisia: Global Internet at Its Best |date=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/10youth.html?_r=1 |work=The New York Times |first=David D. |last=Kirkpatrick |title=Wired and Shrewd, Young Egyptians Guide Revolt |date=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/the-cascading-effects-of-the-arab-spring-28575/ |title=The Arab Uprising's Cascading Effects |publisher=Miller-mccune.com |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227051329/http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/the-cascading-effects-of-the-arab-spring-28575/ |archivedate=27 February 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Tunisian revolution in 2011, people used Facebook to organize meetings and protests.&lt;ref name="WellmanBarry"/&gt; However, there is debate about the extent to which social media facilitated this kind of change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/67325/malcolm-gladwell-and-clay-shirky/from-innovation-to-revolution |title=Malcolm Gladwell and Clay Shirky on Social Media and Revolution, Foreign Affairs March/April 2011 |journal=Foreign Affairs |issue=March/April 2011 |date=1 March 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in hiring===
{{Main|Social media use in hiring}}

[[File:Smoking Crack.jpg|thumb|200px|If a college applicant has posted photos of engaging in activities that are contrary to college rules or values, it could adversely affect their chances of getting in.]]
Some employers examine job applicants' social media profiles as part of the hiring assessment. This issue raises many ethical questions that some consider an employer's right and others consider [[discrimination]]. Many Western European countries have already implemented laws that restrict the regulation of social media in the workplace. States including Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin have passed legislation that protects potential employees and current employees from employers that demand them to give forth their username or password for a social media account.&lt;ref name="Marche2012"&gt;{{cite web |author=Marche, S. |year=2012 |title=Is Facebook Making Us Lonely? |publisher=The Atlantic |accessdate=July 12, 2013 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/is-facebook-making-us-lonely/308930/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of social media by young people has caused significant problems for some applicants who are active on social media when they try to enter the job market. A survey of 17,000 young people in six countries in 2013 found that 1 in 10 people aged 16 to 34 have been rejected for a job because of online comments they made on social media websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Elaine |last=Burke for Silicon Republic |date=30 May 2013 |url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/careers/item/32880-1-in-10-young-people-losing |title=1 in 10 young people losing out on jobs because of pics and comments on social media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in school admissions===
It is not only an issue in the workplace, but an issue in post-secondary school admissions as well. There have been situations where students have been forced to give up their social media passwords to school administrators.&lt;ref name=ACLU1&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.aclu-mn.org/news/2012/03/06/aclu-mn-files-lawsuit-against-minnewaska-area-schools |title=ACLU-MN Files Lawsuit Against Minnewaska Area Schools |website=www.aclu-mn.org |access-date=2016-11-30|date=March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are inadequate laws to protect a student's social media privacy, and organizations such as the ACLU are pushing for more privacy protection, as it is an invasion. They urge students who are pressured to give up their account information to tell the administrators to contact a parent or lawyer before they take the matter any further. Although they are students, they still have the right to keep their password-protected information private.&lt;ref name=ACLU2&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.aclu.org/other/employers-schools-and-social-networking-privacy |title=Employers, Schools, and Social Networking Privacy |newspaper=American Civil Liberties Union |access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010s, while colleges and universities still use these traditional methods to evaluate applicants, these institutions are increasingly accessing applicants' social media profiles to learn about their character and activities. According to [[Kaplan, Inc]], a corporation that provides higher education preparation, in 2012 27% of admissions officers used [[Google]] to learn more about an applicant, with 26% checking Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press.kaptest.com/press-releases/kaplan-test-prep-survey-more-college-admissions-officers-checking-applicants-digital-trails-but-most-students-unconcerned/ |title=Kaplan Test Prep Online Pressroom » Kaplan Test Prep Survey: More College Admissions Officers Checking Applicants' Digital Trails, But Most Students Unconcerned |work=kaptest.com|date=2013-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students whose social media pages include offensive jokes or photos, racist or homophobic comments, photos depicting the applicant engaging in illegal drug use or drunkenness, and so on, may be screened out from admission processes.

===Use by law enforcement agencies===
Social media have been used to assist in searches for missing persons. When a [[University of Cincinnati]] student disappeared in 2014, his friends and family used social media to organize and fund a search effort.&lt;ref name="foxfoxx /ref"&gt;{{cite web |last=Foxx |first=Kara |title=Social media plays a major role in search for Brogan Dulle |url=http://www.fox19.com/story/25606632/social-media-plays-major-role-in-brogan-dulle-search-efforts |publisher=Fox 19 News |accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wcpocunningham0521&gt;{{cite web |last=Cunningham |first=Libby |title=In the search for two Tri-State missing persons, contrasting pictures of social media's role emerge |url=http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/-in-the-search-for-two-tri-state-missing-persons-contrasting-pictures-of-social-medias-role-emerge |publisher=WCPO-TV |accessdate=24 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525205708/http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/-in-the-search-for-two-tri-state-missing-persons-contrasting-pictures-of-social-medias-role-emerge |archivedate=25 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wcpoweldon0523&gt;{{cite web |last=Weldon |first=Casey |title=Brogan Dulle missing update: Family of missing UC student makes emotional plea for his return. |url=http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/brogan-dulle-missing-update-family-of-brogan-dulle-makes-emotional-plea-for-his-return |publisher=WCPO-TV |accessdate=24 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525213413/http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/brogan-dulle-missing-update-family-of-brogan-dulle-makes-emotional-plea-for-his-return |archivedate=25 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; when their efforts went [[Viral marketing|viral]]&lt;ref name="foxfoxx /ref"/&gt;&lt;ref name=wcpoalter0523&gt;{{cite web |last=Alter |first=Maxim |title=TIMELINE: Retracing the last known steps of missing UC student Brogan Dulle |url=http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/brogan-dulle-timeline-retracing-the-last-known-steps-of-the-missing-uc-student |publisher=WCPO-TV |accessdate=24 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525213635/http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/brogan-dulle-timeline-retracing-the-last-known-steps-of-the-missing-uc-student |archivedate=25 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[GoFundMe]], and ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' during the week-long search.

===Use in court cases===
Social media is being used in a range of court cases including employment law, child custody/child support and insurance disability claims. After an Apple employee criticized his employer on Facebook, he was fired. When the former employee sued Apple for unfair dismissal, the court, after seeing the man's Facebook posts, found in favour of Apple, as the man's social media comments breached Apple's policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.blogherald.com/2017/08/24/5-court-cases-social-media-played-part/ |title=

===Social media marketing===
[[File:Linkedin Chocolates.jpg|thumb|Social media websites can also use "traditional" marketing approaches, as seen in these [[LinkedIn]]-branded chocolates.]]
{{main|social media marketing}}
Social media marketing has increased due to the growing active user rates on social media sites. For example, [[Facebook]] currently has 2.2 billion users, [[Twitter]] has 330 million active users and [[Instagram]] has 800 million users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Most famous social network sites worldwide as of January 2018, ranked by number of active users (in millions)|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/|website=Statista|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main uses is to interact with audiences to create awareness of their brand or service, with the main idea of creating a two-way communication system where the audience and/or customers can interact back; providing feedback as just one example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaffey|first1=Dave|last2=Ellis-Chadwick|first2=Fiona|title=Digital Marketing|date=2012|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9780273746102|pages=30–31|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media can be used to advertise; placing an advert on Facebook's Newsfeed, for example, can allow a vast number of people to see it or targeting specific audiences from their usage to encourage awareness of the product or brand. Users of social media are then able to like, share and comment on the advert, becoming message senders as they can keep passing the advert's message on to their friends and onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shu-Chuan|first1=Chu|title=VIRAL ADVERTISING IN SOCIAL MEDIA: PARTICIPATION IN FACEBOOK GROUPS AND RESPONSES AMONG COLLEGE-AGED USERS|journal=Journal of Interactive Advertising|date=2011|volume=12|issue=1|pages=32|url=https://is.muni.cz/el/1423/podzim2013/ZUR589b/um/SM_W8_Facebook_Viral_Advertising.pdf|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use by individuals==

===As a news source===
{{Main|Social media as a news source}}

In the United States, 81% of look online for news of the weather, first and foremost, with the percentage seeking national news at 73%, 52% for sports news, and 41% for entertainment or celebrity news. According to CNN, in 2010 75% of people got their news forwarded through e-mail or social media posts, whereas 37% of people shared a news item via Facebook or Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/03/01/social.network.news/index.html |title=Survey: More Americans get news from Internet than newspapers or radio |work=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] make news a more participatory experience than before as people share news articles and comment on other people's posts. Rainie and Wellman have argued that media making now has become a participation work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Networked: The New Social Operating System |author1=Rainie, Lee |author2=Wellman, Barry |lastauthoramp=yes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bYJGna0AhdAC|isbn=9780262300407 |date=2012-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which changes communication systems. However, 27% of respondents worry about the accuracy of a story on a blog.&lt;ref name=Reuters2013/&gt; 
====Effects on individual and collective memory====
News media and television journalism have been a key feature in the shaping of American collective memory for much of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kitch |first1=Carolyn |year=2002 |title=Anniversary Journalism, Collective Memory, and the Cultural Authority to Tell the Story of the American Past |url=|journal=Journal of Popular Culture |volume=36 |issue=|pages=44–67 |doi=10.1111/1540-5931.00030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Edy |first1=Jill |year=1999 |title=Journalistic Uses of Collective Memory |url=|journal=Journal of Communication |volume=49 |issue=2|pages=71–85 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1999.tb02794.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, since the United States' colonial era, news media has influenced collective memory and discourse about national development and trauma. In many ways, mainstream journalists have maintained an authoritative voice as the storytellers of the American past. Their documentary style narratives, detailed exposes, and their positions in the present make them prime sources for public memory. Specifically, news media journalists have shaped collective memory on nearly every major national event – from the deaths of social and political figures to the progression of political hopefuls. Journalists provide elaborate descriptions of commemorative events in U.S. history and contemporary popular cultural sensations. Many Americans learn the significance of historical events and political issues through news media, as they are presented on popular news stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pajala |first1=Mary |year=2012 |title=Television as an Archive of Memory? |url=|journal=Critical Studies in Television |volume=5 |issue=2|pages=133–145 |doi=10.7227/cst.5.2.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, journalistic influence is growing less important, whereas social networking sites such as [[Facebook]], YouTube and [[Twitter]], provide a constant supply of alternative news sources for users.

As [[social networking]] becomes more popular among older and younger generations, sites such as Facebook and YouTube, gradually undermine the traditionally authoritative voices of news media. For example, American citizens contest media coverage of various social and political events as they see fit, inserting their voices into the narratives about America's past and present and shaping their own collective memories.&lt;ref&gt;Motti Neiger, Oren Meyers and Eyal Zandberg. On Media Memory: Collective Memory in a New Media Age. New York : Palgrave MacMillan, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barnhurst |first1=Kevin |last2=Wartella |first2=Ellen |year=1998 |title=Young Citizens, American TV Newscasts and the Collective Memory |url=|journal=Critical Studies in Mass Media |volume=15 |issue=3|pages=279–305 |doi=10.1080/15295039809367049}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the public explosion of the [[Trayvon Martin]] shooting in Sanford, Florida. News media coverage of the incident was minimal until social media users made the story recognizable through their constant discussion of the case. Approximately one month after the fatal shooting of [[Trayvon Martin]], its online coverage by everyday Americans garnered national attention from mainstream media journalists, in turn exemplifying [[media activism]]. In some ways, the spread of this tragic event through alternative news sources parallels that of [[Emmitt Till]] – whose murder by lynching in 1955 became a national story after it circulated African American and Communist newspapers.

===Interpersonal relationships===
[[File:Social media team.jpeg|thumb|Modern day teenagers interacting]]
Social media is used to fulfill perceived social needs, but not all needs can be fulfilled by social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Z. |last2=Tchernev |first2=J.

She posits that people tend to act differently online and are less afraid to hurt each other's feelings. Some online behaviors can cause stress and anxiety, due to the permanence of online posts, the fear of being hacked, or of universities and employers exploring social media pages.

According to research from UCLA, teenage brains' reward circuits were more active when teenager's photos were liked by more peers. This has both positive and negative features.  Teenagers and young adults befriend people online whom they don't know well.  This opens the possibility of a child being influenced by people who engage in risk-taking behavior. When children have several hundred online connections there is no way for parents to know who they are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/the-teenage-brain-on-social-media |title=Teenage Brain on Social Media |website= |accessdate=May 31, 2016 |author=Wolpert, Stuart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-presentation===
The more time people spend on Facebook, the less satisfied they feel about their life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chan |first=TH |title=Facebook and its Effects on Users' Empathic Social Skills and Life Satisfaction: A Double Edged Sword Effect |year=2014 |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=276–280 |journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking |doi=10.1089/cyber.2013.0466 |pmid=24606026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-presentational theory explains that people will consciously manage their self-image or identity related information in social contexts.

===Health improvement===
Social media might can also function as a supportive system for adolescents' health, because by using social media, adolescents are able to mobilize around health issues that they themselves deem relevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Patton |first=George C. |last2=Sawyer |first2=Susan M. |last3=Santelli |first3=John S. |last4=Ross |first4=David A. |last5=Afifi |first5=Rima |last6=Allen |first6=Nicholas B. |last7=Arora |first7=Monika |last8=Azzopardi |first8=Peter |last9=Baldwin |first9=Wendy |date=June 2016 |title=Our future: a Lancet commission on adolescent health and wellbeing |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673616005791 |journal=The Lancet |volume=387 |issue=10036 |pages=2423–2478 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(16)00579-1 |issn=0140-6736 |pmc=5832967 |pmid=27174304}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in a clinical study among adolescent patients undergoing treatment for [[obesity]], the participants' expressed that through social media, they could find personalized [[weight-loss]] content as well as social support among other adolescents with obesity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1177/1460458218759699|pmid = 29499615|title = Health literacy in a complex digital media landscape: Pediatric obesity patients' experiences with online weight, food, and health information|journal = Health Informatics Journal|pages = 146045821875969|year = 2018|last1 = Holmberg|first1 = Christopher|last2 = Berg|first2 = Christina|last3 = Dahlgren|first3 = Jovanna|last4 = Lissner|first4 = Lauren|last5 = Chaplin|first5 = John Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same authors also found that as with other types of online information, the adolescents need to possess necessary skills to evaluate and identify reliable health information, competencies commonly known as [[health literacy]].

==Social impacts==

===Disparity===
[[File:Sleeping in a Parking Lot.jpg|thumb|People who live in poverty, such as [[homelessness|homeless people]], have low levels of access to computers and Internet or a lack of familiarity with these technologies. This means that these marginalized people are not able to use social media tools to find information, jobs, housing, and other necessities.]]

[[Eric Ehrmann]] contends that social media in the form of [[public diplomacy]] create a patina of inclusiveness that covers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eric-ehrmann/uruguay-prodded-to-end-ba_b_1144833.html |title=Eric Ehrmann: Uruguay Prodded by G-20 to End Bank Secrecy |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=2013-06-16 |date=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; traditional economic interests that are structured to ensure that wealth is pumped up to the top of the economic pyramid, perpetuating the digital divide and post Marxian class conflict. He also voices concern over the trend that finds social utilities operating in a quasi-[[Libertarianism|libertarian]] global environment of oligopoly that requires users in economically challenged nations to spend high percentages of annual income to pay for devices and services to participate in the social media lifestyle. [[Neil Postman]] also contends that social media will increase an information disparity between "winners" – who are able to use the social media actively – and "losers" – who are not familiar with modern technologies or who do not have access to them. People with high social media skills may have better access to information about job opportunities, potential new friends, and social activities in their area, which may enable them to improve their standard of living and their [[quality of life]].

===Ideological polarization===
While [[Selective exposure theory|selective exposure]] has been seen in many aspects of human life, social media has arguably created a greater avenue for people to actively participate in selective exposure. Selective exposure generally refers to people's tendencies to favor information that reinforces their ideas and reject information that opposes their ideas. As technology has become increasingly more personalized, the prevalence of selective exposure has increased. With technology such as televisions, people became able to choose from which organization they received news. A survey done by The Pew Research Center found Democrats 1.5 times more likely to watch CNN than Republicans and Republicans 1.5 times more likely to watch FOX News than Democrats. These results were magnified when examining more opinion based talk shows such as ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, William et al. "Feeling Validated Versus Being Correct: A Meta-Analysis of Selective Exposure to Information." ''Psychological bulletin'' 135.4 (2009): 555–588. ''PMC''. Web. 4 Dec. 2017. {{PMC|4797953}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the political opinions of Republicans or Democrats who exclusively tuned into media outlets affirming their own views were significantly more polarized.&lt;ref&gt;Perloff, R. M. (2013). Political persuasion. In James Price Dillard and Lijiang Shen (Eds.), ''The SAGE Handbook of Persuasion: Developments in Theory and Practice.'' Retrieved from the Gale Virtual Reference Library database.&lt;/ref&gt; As social media makes selective exposure even easier through its features such as a news feed filled with media from sources which consumers actively follow, critics argue that the currently visible effects, both political and not, of selective exposure will only be magnified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayat|first=Tsahi|last2=Samuel-Azran|first2=Tal|date=2017-04-03|title="You too, Second Screeners?"

The authors found evidences for ideological [[homophily]] among the followers of the Twitter handles of different cable news shows. The followers of [[The O'Reilly Factor]], were predominantly [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], while the followers of [[The Rachel Maddow Show]], where predominantly [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. Hayat and Samuel-Azran further found that there was very little cross-camp interactions between democrats and republicans, and that users who were more active in posting content while watching news shows, were the least likely to be involved in cross camp interaction.

===Stereotyping===
Recent research has demonstrated that social media, and media in general, have the power to increase the scope of stereotypes not only in children but people all ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Díaz-Fernández|first=Antonio M.|last2=del-Real-Castrillo|first2=Cristina|date=2018-07-01|title=Spies and security: Assessing the impact of animated videos on intelligence services in school children|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=26|issue=56|pages=81–89|doi=10.3916/c56-2018-08|issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three researchers at Blanquerna University, Spain, examined how adolescents interact with social media and specifically Facebook. They suggest that interactions on the website encourage representing oneself in the traditional gender constructs, which helps maintain gender stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Basow |first1=susan A. |title=Gender : stereotypes and roles . |date=1992 |publisher=Thomson Brooks/ Cole publishing Co. |location=Belmont CA. U.S |page=447 |edition=3rd |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1992-97754-000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors noted that girls generally show more emotion in their posts and more frequently change their profile pictures, which according to some psychologists can lead to self-objectification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oberst |first1=Ursala |last2=Chamarro |first2=Andres |last3=Renau |first3=Vanessa |title=Gender Stereotypes 2.0: Self-Representations of Adolescents on Facebook |journal=Media Education Research Journal |volume=24 |issue=48 |pages=81–89 |doi=10.3916/c48-2016-08|year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the researchers found that boys prefer to portray themselves as strong, independent, and powerful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Peter |first2=J |title=Women on Display: The Effect of Portraying the Self Online on Women's Self-objectification |journal=Computers in Human Behavior |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=1,483–1489 |last1=De Vies |first1=D|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2013.01.015 |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, men often post pictures of objects and not themselves, and rarely change their profile pictures; using the pages more for entertainment and pragmatic reasons. In contrast girls generally post more images that include themselves, friends and things they have emotional ties to, which the researchers attributed that to the higher emotional intelligence of girls at a younger age. The authors sampled over 632 girls and boys from the ages of 12–16 from Spain in an effort to confirm their beliefs. The researchers concluded that masculinity is more commonly associated with a positive psychological well-being, while femininity displays less psychological well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Facebook Involvement, Objectified Body Consciousness, Body Shame, and Sexual Assertiveness in College Women and Men |journal=Sex Roles |volume=72 |doi=10.1007/s11199-014-0441-1 |year=2014 |pages=1–14 | last1 = Manago | first1 = Adriana M. | last2 = Ward | first2 = L. Monique | last3 = Lemm | first3 = Kristi M. | last4 = Reed | first4 = Lauren | last5 = Seabrook | first5 = Rita}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the researchers discovered that people tend not to completely conform to either stereotype, and encompass desirable parts of both. Users of Facebook generally use their profile to reflect that they are a "normal" person. Social media was found to uphold gender stereotypes both feminine and masculine. The researchers also noted that the traditional stereotypes are often upheld by boys more so than girls. The authors described how neither stereotype was entirely positive, but most people viewed masculine values as more positive.

===Cognition and memory===
According to writer Christine Rosen in "Virtual Friendship, and the New Narcissism," many social media sites encourage status-seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/virtual-friendship-and-the-new-narcissism |title=Virtual Friendship and the New Narcissism |work=The New Atlantis |accessdate=February 29, 2016 |author=Rosen, Christine}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rosen, the practice and definition of "friendship" changes in virtuality. Friendship "in these virtual spaces is thoroughly different from real-world friendship. In its traditional sense, friendship is a relationship which, broadly speaking, involves the sharing of mutual interests, reciprocity, trust, and the revelation of intimate details over time and within specific social (and cultural) contexts. Because friendship depends on mutual revelations that are concealed from the rest of the world, it can only flourish within the boundaries of privacy; the idea of public friendship is an oxymoron." Rosen also cites Brigham Young University researchers who "recently surveyed 184 users of social networking sites and found that heavy users 'feel less socially involved with the community around them.'"
Critic Nicholas G. Carr in "Is Google Making Us Stupid?" questions how technology affects [[cognition]] and [[memory]].&lt;ref name=Google&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/306868/ |year=2008 |title=Nicholas Carr, "Is Google Making Us Stupid?-What the Internet is doing to our brains" |access-date=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The kind of deep reading that a sequence of printed pages promotes is valuable not just for the knowledge we acquire from the author's words but for the intellectual vibrations those words set off within our own minds. In the quiet spaces opened up by the sustained, undistracted reading of a book, or by any other act of contemplation, for that matter, we make our own associations, draw our own inferences and analogies, foster our own ideas... If we lose those quiet spaces, or fill them up with "content," we will sacrifice something important not only in ourselves but in our culture."

===Physical and mental health===
There are several negative effects to social media which receive criticism, for example regarding privacy issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite citeseerx |last1=Lundblad |first1=Niklas |title=Privacy in a Noisy Society |citeseerx=10.1.1.67.965}}&lt;/ref&gt; information overload&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Postman |first1=Neil |title=Informing ourselves to death |url=https://w2.eff.org/Net_culture/Criticisms/informing_ourselves_to_death.paper}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Internet fraud]]. Social media can also have negative social effects on users. Angry or emotional conversations can lead to real-world interactions outside of the Internet, which can get users into dangerous situations. Some users have experienced threats of violence online and have feared these threats manifesting themselves offline. Studies also show that social media have negative effects on peoples' self-esteem and self-worth. The authors of "Who Compares and Despairs? The Effect of Social Comparison Orientation on Social Media Use and its Outcomes"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2015.06.026 |title=Who compares and despairs? The effect of social comparison orientation on social media use and its outcomes |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=86 |pages=249–56 |year=2015 |last1=Vogel |first1=Erin A. |last2=Rose |first2=Jason P. |last3=Okdie |first3=Bradley M. |last4=Eckles |first4=Katheryn |last5=Franz |first5=Brittany }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that people with a higher social comparison orientation appear to use social media more heavily than people with low social comparison orientation. This finding was consistent with other studies that found people with high social comparison orientation make more social comparisons once on social media. People compare their own lives to the lives of their friends through their friends' posts. People are motivated to portray themselves in a way that is appropriate to the situation and serves their best interest. Often the things posted online are the positive aspects of people's lives, making other people question why their own lives are not as exciting or fulfilling. This can lead to depression and other self-esteem issues as well as decrease their satisfaction of life as they feel if their life is not exciting enough to put online it is not as good as their friends or family.&lt;ref&gt;Hawi, N.S. &amp; Samaha, M. 2017, "The Relations Among Social Media Addiction, Self-Esteem, and Life Satisfaction in University Students", Social Science Computer Review, vol. 35, no. 5, pp. 576-586&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that self comparison on social media can have dire effects on physical and mental health because they give us the ability to seek approval and compare ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Stefanone, M.A. |author2=Lackaff, D. |author3=Rosen, D. |date=2011 |title=Contingencies of Self-Worth and Social-Networking-Site Behavior |url=http://www.buffalo.edu/content/dam/cas/communication/files/Stefanone/Stefanone_cyberpsych.2011.pdf |journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media has both a practical usage- to connect us with others, but also can lead to fulfillment of gratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Quan-Haase |first=Anabel |last2=Young |first2=Alyson L.|date=2010-09-14|title=Uses and Gratifications of Social Media: A Comparison of Facebook and Instant Messaging |journal=Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society |language=en |volume=30|issue=5|pages=350–361 |doi=10.1177/0270467610380009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, one study suggests that because a critical aspect of social networking sites involve spending hours, if not months customizing a personal profile, and encourage a sort of social currency based on likes, followers and comments- they provide a forum for persistent "appearance conversations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/children-teens-media-and-body-image# |title=Children, Teens, Media, and Body Image |website=Common Sense Media|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These appearance centered conversations that forums like Facebook, Instagram among others provide can lead to feelings of disappointment in looks and personality when not enough likes or comments are achieved. In addition, social media use can lead to detrimental physical health effects. A large body of literature associates body image and disordered eating with social networking platforms. Specifically, literature suggests that social media can breed a negative feedback loop of viewing and uploading photos, self comparison, feelings of disappointment when perceived social success is not achieved, and disordered body perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Holland, G. |author2=Tiggerman, M. |date=2016 |title=A systematic review of the impact of the use of social networking sites on body image and disordered eating outcomes |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298794212 |journal=Body Image|volume=|pages=101–109|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, one study shows that the microblogging platform, Pinterest is directly associated with disordered dieting behavior, indicating that for those who frequently look at exercise or dieting "pins" there is a greater chance that they will engage in extreme weight-loss and dieting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lewallen |first=Jennifer |last2=Behm-Morawitz |first2=Elizabeth |date=2016-03-30 |title=Pinterest or Thinterest?: Social Comparison and Body Image on Social Media|journal=Social Media + Society |language=en |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1177/2056305116640559 |page=205630511664055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bo Han, a social media researcher at Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce, finds that users are likely to experience the "social media burnout" issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/08874417.2016.1208064 |title=Social Media Burnout: Definition, Measurement Instrument, and Why We Care |journal=Journal of Computer Information Systems |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=1–9 |year=2016 |last1=Han |first1=Bo }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambivalence, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization are usually the main symptoms if a user experiences social media burnout. Ambivalence refers to a user's confusion about the benefits she can get from using a social media site. Emotional exhaustion refers to the stress a user has when using a social media site. Depersonalization refers to the emotional detachment from a social media site a user experiences. The three burnout factors can all negatively influence the user's social media continuance. This study provides an instrument to measure the burnout a user can experience, when her social media "friends" are generating an overwhelming amount of useless information (e.g., "what I had for dinner", "where I am now").

====Adolescents====
Excessive use of digital technology, like social media, by adolescents can cause disruptions in their physical and mental health, in sleeping patterns, their weight and levels of exercise and notably in their academic performance. Research has continued to demonstrate that long hours spent on mobile devices have shown a positive relationship with an increase in teenagers' BMI and a lack of physical activity. Moreover, excessive internet usage has been linked to lower grades compared to users who don't spend an excessive amount of time online, even with a control over age, gender, race, parent education and personal contentment factors that may affect the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s11920-014-0472-x|pmid = 25070673|title = Adolescents and the Internet: What Mental Health Clinicians Need to Know|journal = Current Psychiatry Reports|volume = 16|issue = 9|pages = 472|year = 2014|last1 = Rafla|first1 = Malak|last2 = Carson|first2 = Nicholas J|last3 = Dejong|first3 = Sandra M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of multiple social media platforms is more strongly associated with depression and anxiety among young adults than time spent online. The analysis showed that people who reported using the most platforms (7 to 11) had more than three times the risk of depression and anxiety than people who used the least amount (0 to 2).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zagorski|first=Nick|date=2017-01-20|title=Using Many Social Media Platforms Linked With Depression, Anxiety Risk|journal=Psychiatric News|language=en|volume=52|issue=2|pages=1|doi=10.1176/appi.pn.2017.1b16|issn=0033-2704}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media addiction and its sub-dimensions have a high positive correlation. The more the participants are addicted to social media, the less satisfied they are with life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1160611.pdf|title=The Predictive Level of Social Media Addiction for Life Satisfaction: A Study on University Students|journal=Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology - TOJET|last=Şahin|first=Cengiz|volume=16|issue=4|date=October 2017|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sleep disturbances====
According to a study released in 2017 by researchers from the [[University of Pittsburgh]], the link between sleep disturbance and the use of social media was clear. It concluded that blue light had a part to play—and how often they logged on, rather than time spent on social media sites, was a higher predictor of disturbed sleep, suggesting "an obsessive 'checking'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180104-is-social-media-bad-for-you-the-evidence-and-the-unknowns|title=Is social media bad for you?

====Changes in mood====
Many teenagers suffer from sleep deprivation as they spend long hours at night on their phones, and this, in turn, could affect grades as they will be tired and unfocused in school. Social media has generated a phenomenon known as " Facebook depression", which is a type of depression that affects adolescents who spend too much of their free time engaging with social media sites. "Facebook depression" leads to problems such as reclusiveness which can negatively damage ones health by creating feelings of loneliness and low self-esteem among young people.&lt;ref&gt;(O’Keefe Schurgen, Gwenn. Clarke-Pearson, Kathleen. (2011) The impact of Social Media on Children, Adolescents, and Families. American Academy of Pediatrics, Volume 127 (issue 4), 800-805)&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, a 2017 shown that there is a link between social media addiction and negative mental health effects. In this study, almost 6,000 adolescent students were examined using the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale. 4.5% of these students were found to be "at risk" of social media addiction. Furthermore, this same 4.5% reported low self-esteem and high levels of depressive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bányai|first=Fanni|last2=Zsila|first2=Ágnes|last3=Király|first3=Orsolya|last4=Maraz|first4=Aniko|last5=Elekes|first5=Zsuzsanna|last6=Griffiths|first6=Mark D.|last7=Andreassen|first7=Cecilie Schou|last8=Demetrovics|first8=Zsolt|date=2017-01-09|title=Problematic Social Media Use: Results from a Large-Scale Nationally Representative Adolescent Sample|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=12|issue=1|pages=e0169839|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0169839|pmid=28068404|pmc=5222338|issn=1932-6203|bibcode=2017PLoSO..1269839B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UK researchers used a dataset of more than 800 million [[Twitter]] messages to evaluate how collective mood changes over the course of 24 hours and across the seasons. The research team collected 800 million anonymous Tweets from 33,576 time points over four years, to examine anger and sadness and compare them with fatigue. The "research revealed strong circadian patterns for both positive and negative moods. The profiles of anger and fatigue were found remarkably stable across the seasons or between the weekdays/weekend." The "positive emotions and sadness showed more variability in response to these changing conditions and higher levels of interaction with the onset of sunlight exposure." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320381.php|title=How social media reflects our daily mood changes|work=Medical News Today|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on youth communication===
Social media has affected the way youth communicate, by introducing new forms of language.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lebedko |first1=Maria |title=Globalization, Networking and Intercultural Communication |url=http://web.uri.edu/iaics/files/3-XXIII-1-G.-Lebedko.pdf |journal=Intercultural Communication Studies |date=2014 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=28–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbreviations have been introduced to cut down on the time it takes to respond online. The commonly known "[[LOL]]" has become globally recognized as the abbreviation for "laugh out loud" thanks to social media.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Other catchphrases and [[neologism]]s include "[[YOLO (motto)|YOLO]]", which stands for "you only live once", and "BAE", which stands for "before anyone else".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zarinsky |first1=Natasha |title=What the Hell is Up with 'Bae'? |url=http://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/news/a29423/where-did-bae-come-from/ |website=Esquire|date=2014-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other trends that influence the way youth communicate is through [[hashtag]]s. With the introduction of social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, the hashtag was created to easily organize and search for information. As hashtags such as #tbt ("[[throwback Thursday]]") become a part of online communication, it influenced the way in which youth share and communicate in their daily lives.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Because of these changes in linguistics and communication etiquette, researchers of media semiotics have found that this has altered youth's communications habits and more.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Social media has allowed for mass cultural exchange and intercultural communication. For example, people from different regions or even different countries can discuss current issues on Facebook. As different cultures have different value systems, cultural themes, grammar, and worldviews, they also communicate differently.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guo-Ming |first1=Chen |title=The Impact of New Media on Intercultural Communication in Global Context |url=http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&amp;context=com_facpubs |journal=China Media Research |date=2012 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of social media platforms collided different cultures and their communication methods together, forcing them to realign in order to communicate with ease with other cultures.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; As different cultures continue to connect through social media platforms, thinking patterns, expression styles and cultural content that influence cultural values are chipped away.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Social media has offered a new platform for [[peer pressure]] with both positive and negative communication. From Facebook comments to likes on Instagram, how the youth communicate and what is socially acceptable is now heavily based on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=O'Keeffe |first1=Gwenn |last2=Clarke-Pearson |first2=Kathleen |title=The Impact of Social Media on Children, Adolescents, and Families |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/4/800 |journal=Pediatrics|volume=127 |issue=4 |pages=800–804 |doi=10.1542/peds.2011-0054 |pmid=21444588 |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticisms of social media range from criticisms of the ease of use of specific platforms and their capabilities, disparity of information available, issues with trustworthiness and reliability of information presented,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flanigin |first=Andrew J |author2=Metzger, Miriam |title=The role of site features, user attributes, and information verification behaviors on the perceived credibility of web-based information. |journal=New Media and Society |year=2007 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=319–342 |url=http://www.annehelmond.nl/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/319.pdf |accessdate=15 February 2014 |doi=10.1177/1461444807075015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the impact of social media use on an individual's concentration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Paul |first1=Jomon Aliyas |last2=Baker |first2=Hope M. |last3=Cochran |first3=Justin Daniel |title=Effect of online social networking on student academic performance |journal=Computers in Human Behavior |date=November 2012 |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=2117–2127 |doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.06.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ownership of media content, and the meaning of interactions created by social media. Although some social media platforms offer users the opportunity to cross-post simultaneously, some social network platforms have been criticized for poor interoperability between platforms, which leads to the creation of information silos, viz. isolated pockets of data contained in one social media platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hinchiffe |first=Don |title=Are social media silos holding back business |url=http://www.zdnet.com/are-social-media-silos-holding-back-business-results-7000017227/ |publisher=ZDNet.com |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is also argued that social media have positive effects such as allowing the democratization of the Internet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kaplan Andreas M. |author2=Haenlein Michael |year=2010 |title=Users of the world, unite!

There has been a dramatic decrease in face-to-face interactions as more and more social media platforms have been introduced with the threat of cyber-bullying and online sexual predators being more prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Ukpe |first=Kufre |title=The Impact of Social Media on Technology }}{{full citation needed|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media may expose children to images of alcohol, [[tobacco]], and sexual behaviors{{Relevance inline|date=April 2013}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ray |first=Munni |title=Effect of Electronic Media on Children |url=http://www.lib.umich.edu/articles/details/FETCH-LOGICAL-c1141-77ca8b617088157d8525719159302e357cc9e8ca93e520729bdfdadbf588ffcd1 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to cyber-bullying, it has been proven that individuals who have no experience with cyber-bullying often have a better well-being than individuals who have been bullied online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spears |first1=B.

Twitter is increasingly a target of heavy activity of marketers. Their actions, focused on gaining massive numbers of followers, include use of advanced scripts and manipulation techniques that distort the prime idea of social media by abusing human trustfulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Trimarchi |first=Maria |title=5 Myths About Twitter |url=https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/tech-myths/5-myths-about-twitter.htm |publisher=Howstuffworks |accessdate=22 October 2017|date=2009-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  British-American entrepreneur and author [[Andrew Keen]] criticizes social media in his book ''[[The Cult of the Amateur]]'', writing, "Out of this anarchy, it suddenly became clear that what was governing the infinite monkeys now inputting away on the Internet was the law of digital Darwinism, the survival of the loudest and most opinionated. Under these rules, the only way to intellectually prevail is by infinite filibustering."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Keen |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Keen |title=The Cult of the Amateur |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-385-52081-2 |page=15|year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is also relative to the issue "justice" in the social network. For example, the phenomenon "[[Human flesh search engine]]" in Asia raised the discussion of "private-law" brought by social network platform. Comparative media professor [[José van Dijck]] contends in her book "[[The Culture of Connectivity]]" (2013) that to understand the full weight of social media, their technological dimensions should be connected to the social and the cultural. She critically describes six social media platforms. One of her findings is the way Facebook had been successful in framing the term 'sharing' in such a way that third party use of user data is neglected in favour of intra-user connectedness.

===Trustworthiness and reliability===
&lt;!--This paragraph was moved here from the section previously called 'Building social authority'--&gt;
There is speculation that social media is becoming perceived as a trustworthy source of information by a large number of people. The continuous interpersonal connectivity on social media has led to people regarding peer recommendations as a reliable source of information. However, this trust can be exploited by marketers, who can utilise consumer-created content about brands and products to influence public perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dickey, Irene J. |author2=Lewis, William F.|title=The Evolution (Revolution) of Social Media and Social Networking as a Necessary Topic in the Marketing Curriculum: A Case for Integrating Social Media into Marketing Classes|url=http://ecommons.udayton.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1037&amp;context=mgt_fac_pub|website=ecommons.udayton.edu|publisher=Department of Management and Marketing, eCommons|accessdate=14 November 2017|ref=Dickey, Irene J. and Lewis, William F., "The Evolution (Revolution) of Social Media and Social Networking as a Necessary Topic in the Marketing Curriculum: A Case for Integrating Social Media into Marketing Classes" (2010).

Because large-scale collaborative co-creation is one of the main ways of forming information in the social network, the user generated content is sometimes viewed with skepticism; readers do not trust it as a reliable source of information. Aniket Kittur, Bongowon Suh, and Ed H. Chi took wikis under examination and indicated that, "One possibility is that distrust of wiki content is not due to the inherently mutable nature of the system but instead to the lack of available information for judging trustworthiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kittur |first=Aniket |last2=Suh |first2=Bongowon |last3=Chi |first3=Ed H. |chapter=Can you ever trust a wiki?: Impacting perceived trustworthiness in wikipedia |chapter-url=http://kittur.org/files/Kittur_2008_CSCW_TrustWiki.pdf |editor-last1=Begole |editor-first1=Bo |editor-last2=McDonald |editor-first2=David M. |title=Proceedings of the ACM 2008 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work: November 8-12, 2008, San Diego, California |date=2008 |publisher=ACM Press |location=New York, N.Y. |isbn=978-1-60558-007-4 |doi=10.1145/1460563.1460639 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141130182046/http://kittur.org/files/Kittur_2008_CSCW_TrustWiki.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To be more specific, the authors mention that reasons for distrusting collaborative systems with user-generated content, such as Wikipedia, include a lack of information regarding accuracy of contents, motives and expertise of editors, stability of content, coverage of topics and the absence of sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dennings |first1=P. |last2=Horning |first2=J. |last3=Parnas |first3=D. |last4=Weinstein |first4=L. |year=2005 |title=Wikipedia risks |url= |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=48 |issue=12 |page=152 |doi=10.1145/1101779.1101804|bibcode=1985CACM...28...22S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evgeny Morozov]], 2009–2010 Yahoo fellow at Georgetown University, contends that the information uploaded to Twitter may have little relevance to the rest of the people who do not use Twitter. In the article "Iran: Downside to the "Twitter Revolution"" in the magazine ''Dissent '',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morozov |first=Evgeny |title=Iran: Downside to the "Twitter Revolution" |journal=Dissent |date=2009 |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=10–14 |doi=10.1353/dss.0.0092|url=http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/TEKN/article/view/51780 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; he says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Twitter only adds to the noise: it's simply impossible to pack much context into its 140 characters. All other biases are present as well: in a country like Iran it's mostly pro-Western, technology-friendly and iPod-carrying young people who are the natural and most frequent users of Twitter. They are a tiny and, most important, extremely untypical segment of the Iranian population (the number of Twitter users in Iran — a country of more than seventy million people.)"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Even in the United States, the birth-country of Twitter, currently in 2015 the social network has 306 million accounts.&lt;ref&gt;(Media Bistro, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Because there are likely to be many multi-account users, and the United States in 2012 had a population of 314.7 million,&lt;ref&gt;(U.S. POPClock Projection". U.S. Census Bureau., 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; the adoption of Twitter is somewhat limited. Professor [[Matthew Auer]] of [[Bates College]] casts doubt on the conventional wisdom that social media are open and participatory. He also speculates on the emergence of "anti-social media" used as "instruments of pure control."&lt;ref name=Auer2001&gt;{{cite journal |last=Auer |first=Matthew R. |year=2011 |title=The Policy Sciences of Social Media |journal=Policy Studies Journal |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=709–736 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2011.00428.x |ssrn=1974080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism of data harvesting on Facebook====
On April 10, 2018, in a hearing held in response to revelations of data harvesting by [[Cambridge Analytica]], Mark Zuckerberg, the [[Facebook]] chief executive, faced questions from senators on a variety of issues, from privacy to the company’s business model and the company's mishandling of data. This was Mr. Zuckerberg’s first appearance before Congress, prompted by the revelation that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm linked to the Trump campaign, harvested the data of an estimated 87&amp;nbsp;million Facebook users to psychologically profile voters during the 2016 election. Zuckerburg was pressed to account for how third-party partners could take data without users’ knowledge. Lawmakers grilled the 33-year-old executive on the proliferation of so-called fake news on Facebook, Russian interference during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]] and censorship of conservative media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/us/politics/mark-zuckerberg-testimony.html|title=Mark Zuckerberg Testimony: Senators Question Facebook’s Commitment to Privacy|last=Times|first=The New York|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique of activism===
For [[Malcolm Gladwell]], the role of social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, in revolutions and protests is overstated.&lt;ref name="Gladwell 2010-10-04"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/10/04/small-change-3 |author=Malcolm Gladwell |title=Small Changes – Why the revolution will not be tweeted |date=4 October 2010 |accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, social media make it easier for individuals, and in this case activists, to express themselves. On the other hand, it is harder for that expression to have an impact.&lt;ref name="Gladwell 2010-10-04"/&gt; Gladwell distinguishes between social media activism and high risk activism, which brings real changes. Activism and especially high-risk activism involves strong-tie relationships, hierarchies, coordination, motivation, exposing oneself to high risks, making sacrifices.&lt;ref name="Gladwell 2010-10-04"/&gt; Gladwell discusses that social media are built around weak ties and he argues that "social networks are effective at increasing participation — by lessening the level of motivation that participation requires".&lt;ref name="Gladwell 2010-10-04"/&gt; According to him "Facebook activism succeeds not by motivating people to make a real sacrifice, but by motivating them to do the things that people do when they are not motivated enough to make a real sacrifice".&lt;ref name="Gladwell 2010-10-04"/&gt;

Disputing Gladwell's theory, in the study "Perceptions of Social Media for Politics: Testing the Slacktivism Hypothesis," Kwak and colleagues conducted a survey which found that people who are politically expressive on social media are also more likely to participate in offline political activity. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kwak|first=Nojin|last2=Lane|first2=Daniel S|last3=Weeks|first3=Brian E|last4=Kim|first4=Dam Hee|last5=Lee|first5=Slgi S|last6=Bachleda|first6=Sarah|date=2018-04-01|title=Perceptions of Social Media for Politics: Testing the Slacktivism Hypothesis|journal=Human Communication Research|volume=44|issue=2|pages=197–221|doi=10.1093/hcr/hqx008|issn=0360-3989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ownership of content===
Social media content is generated through social media interactions done by the users through the site. There has always been a huge debate on the ownership of the content on social media platforms because it is generated by the users and hosted by the company. Added to this is the danger to security of information, which can be leaked to third parties with economic interests in the platform, or parasites who comb the data for their own databases.&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite web |url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/student-papers/fall05-papers/facebook.pdf |last1=Jones |first1=Harvey |last2=Soltren |first2=José Hiram |title=Facebook: Threats to Privacy |publisher=MIT Computer Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence Lab |year= 2005 |format=PDF |accessdate=4 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of ''Social Media Is Bullshit'', [[Brandon Mendelson]], claims that the "true" owners of content created on social media sites only benefits the large corporations who own those sites and rarely the users that created them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://socialmediaisbs.com/2013/06/26/the-revised-edition-chapter-five-of-social-media-is-bs/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713090935/http://socialmediaisbs.com/2013/06/26/the-revised-edition-chapter-five-of-social-media-is-bs/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-07-13 |title=Chapter 5: There Is Nothing New Under The Sun (Excerpt From Social Media Is Bullshit) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy===
[[Privacy concerns with social networking services|Privacy]] rights advocates warn users on social media about the collection of their personal data. Some information is captured without the user's knowledge or [[consent]] through electronic tracking and third party applications. Data may also be collected for law enforcement and governmental purposes,&lt;ref name=Auer2001/&gt; by [[social media intelligence]] using [[data mining]] techniques.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt; Data and information may also be collected for third party use. When information is shared on social media, that information is no longer private. There have been many cases in which young persons especially, share personal information, which can attract predators. It is very important to monitor what you share, and to be aware of who you could potentially be sharing that information with. Teens especially share significantly more information on the internet now than they have in the past. Teens are much more likely to share their personal information, such as email address, phone number, and school names.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/05/21/teens-social-media-and-privacy/ |title=Teens, Social Media, and Privacy |last=Madden |first=Mary |display-authors=etal |date=2013-05-21 |website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech |access-date=2016-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies suggest that teens are not aware of what they are posting and how much of that information can be accessed by third parties.

There are arguments that "privacy is dead" and that with social media growing more and more, some heavy social media users appear to have become quite unconcerned with privacy. Others argue, however, that people are still very concerned about their privacy, but are being ignored by the companies running these social networks, who can sometimes make a profit off of sharing someone's personal information. There is also a disconnect between social media user's words and their actions. Studies suggest that surveys show that people want to keep their lives private, but their actions on social media suggest otherwise. Another factor is ignorance of how accessible social media posts are. Some social media users who have been criticized for inappropriate comments stated that they did not realize that anyone outside their circle of friends would read their post; in fact, on some social media sites, unless a user selects higher privacy settings, their content is shared with a wide audience.

According to a 2016 article diving into the topic of sharing privately and the effect social media has on expectations of privacy, "1.18 billion people will log into their [[Facebook]] accounts, 500 million tweets will be sent, and there will be 95 million photos and videos posted on [[Instagram]]" in a day. Much of the privacy concerns individuals face stem from their own posts on a form of social network. Users have the choice to share voluntarily, and has been ingrained into society as routine and normative. Social media is a snapshot of our lives; a community we have created on the behaviors of sharing, posting, liking, and communicating. Sharing has become a phenomenon which social media and networks have uprooted and introduced to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/sunday-review/we-want-privacy-but-cant-stop-sharing.html|title=We Want Privacy, but Can't Stop Sharing|last=Murphy|first=Kate|date=2014-10-04|journal=The New York Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of privacy is redundant; once something is posted, its accessibility remains constant even if we select who is potentially able to view it. People desire privacy in some shape or form, yet also contribute to social media, which makes it difficult to maintain privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mills|first=Max|date=|title=Sharing Privately|journal=Journal of Media Law|volume=9|pages=45–71|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mills offers options for reform which include copyright and the application of the law of confidence; more radically, a change to the concept of privacy itself.

A 2014 [[Pew Research Center]] survey found that 91% of Americans "agree" or "strongly agree" that people have lost control over how personal information is collected and used by all kinds of entities. Some 80% of social media users said they were concerned about advertisers and businesses accessing the data they share on social media platforms, and 64% said the government should do more to regulate advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/27/americans-complicated-feelings-about-social-media-in-an-era-of-privacy-concerns/|title=Americans’ complicated feelings about social media in an era of privacy concerns|date=2018-03-27|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of commercialization===
The commercial development of social media has been criticized as the actions of consumers in these settings has become increasingly value-creating, for example when consumers contribute to the marketing and branding of specific products by posting positive reviews. As such, value-creating activities also increase the value of a specific product, which could, according to the marketing professors Bernad Cova and Daniele Dalli, lead to what they refer to as "double exploitation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cova |first=Bernard |last2=Dalli |first2=Daniele |date=2009 |title=Working consumers: the next step in marketing theory?  |journal=Marketing Theory |doi=10.1177/1470593109338144 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=315–339|url=https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/36717/1/MPRA_paper_36717.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies are getting consumers to create content for the companies' websites for which the consumers are not paid.

As social media usage has become increasingly widespread, social media has to a large extent come to be subjected to commercialization by marketing companies and advertising agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/27913/1/gupea_2077_27913_1.pdf |title=Marketing fads and fashions – exploring digital marketing practices and emerging organisational fields |last=Pihl |first=Christofer |publisher=Gothenburg University |year=2011 |isbn=|location=Gothenburg |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christofer Laurell, a digital marketing researcher, suggested that the social media landscape currently consists of three types of places because of this development: consumer-dominated places, professionally dominated places and places undergoing commercialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:682055/FULLTEXT01.pdf |title=Commercialising social media: a study of fashion (blogo)spheres |last=Laurell |first=Christofer |publisher=Stockholm University |year=2014 |isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As social media becomes commercialized, this process have been shown to create novel forms of value networks stretching between consumer and producer&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pihl |first=Christofer |date=2013 |title=When customers create the ad and sell it –a value network approach |journal=Journal of Global Scholars of Marketing Science |doi=10.1080/21639159.2013.763487|volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=127–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which a combination of personal, private and commercial contents are created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pihl |first=Christofer |last2=Sandström |first2=Christian |date=2013 |title=Value creation and appropriation in social media –the case of fashion bloggers in Sweden  |journal=International Journal of Technology Management |doi=10.1504/IJTM.2013.052673 |volume=61 |issue=3/4 |page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debate over addiction===
As one of the biggest preoccupations among adolescents is social media usage, researchers have begun using the term "F.A.D.," or "Facebook addiction disorder," a form of [[internet addiction disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/facebook-addiction-disorder-the-6-symptoms-of-f-a-d/ |title=Facebook Addiction Disorder — The 6 Symptoms of F.A.D. |work=adweek.com |date=May 2, 2011 |accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; FAD is characterized by a compulsive use of the social networking site Facebook, which generally results in physical or psychological complications. The disorder, although not classified in the latest Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) or by the World Health Organization, has been the subject of several studies focusing on the negative effects on the psyche. One German study, published in 2017, investigated a correlation between extensive use of the social networking site and narcissism; the results were published in the journal PLoS One. According to the findings: "FAD was significantly positively related to the personality trait narcissism and to negative mental health variables (depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms)."&lt;ref&gt;Brailovskaia, J (2017). Facebook Addiction Disorder (FAD) among German students—A longitudinal approach PLOS One, 12(12), 2423-2478. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0189719&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debate over use in academic settings===
{{Main|Use of social media in education}}
Having social media in the classroom was a controversial topic in the 2010s. Many parents and educators have been fearful of the repercussions of having social media in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kist |first=W. |year=2012 |title=Class get ready to tweet: Social media in the classroom. Our children |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ991339.pdf |format=PDF |website=files.eric.ed.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are concerns that social media tools can be misused for [[cyberbullying]] or sharing inappropriate content. As result, cell phones have been banned from some classrooms, and some schools have blocked many popular social media websites. Many schools have realized that they need to loosen restrictions, teach digital citizenship skills, and even incorporate these tools into classrooms. Some schools permit students to use [[smartphone]]s or [[tablet computer]]s in class, as long as the students are using these devices for academic purposes, such as doing research. Using Facebook in class allows for integration of multimodal content such as student-created photographs and video and URLs to other texts, in a platform that many students are already familiar with. Twitter can be used to enhance communication building and critical thinking and it provides students with an informal "[[back channel]]"), and extend discussion outside of class time.  YouTube is a frequently used social media tool in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Moran, M. |author2=Seaman, J. |author3=Tinti-Kane, H. |year=2012 |title=How today's higher education faculty use social media |url=http://www.pearsonlearningsolutions.com/assets/downloads/pdfs/pearson-social-media-survey-2012-color.pdf |format=PDF |website=pearsonlearningsolutions.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2014}} Students can watch videos, answer questions, and discuss content. Additionally, students can create videos to share with others.

===Censorship===
{{Main|Internet censorship}}
[[File:Thai-coup-detat-2014-social-media-banner.jpg|thumb|Banner in [[Bangkok]], observed on the 30th of June 2014, informing the Thai public that 'like' or 'share' activity on social media may land them in jail]]

Social media often features in political struggles to control public perception and online activity. In some countries, [[Internet police]] or [[secret police]] monitor or control citizens' use of social media. For example, in 2013 some social media was banned in [[Turkey]] after the Taksim [[Gezi Park protests]]. Both Twitter and YouTube were temporarily suspended in the country by a court's decision. A new law, passed by [[Turkish Parliament]], has granted immunity to Telecommunications Directorate (TİB) personnel. The TİB was also given the authority to block access to specific websites without the need for a court order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Salih Sarıkaya |title=Social Media Ban In Turkey: What Does It Mean? by Salih Sarıkaya |url=http://www.salihsarikaya.com/en/social-media-ban-in-turkey-what-does-it-mean-by-salih-sarikaya/ |date=30 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006012638/http://www.salihsarikaya.com/en/social-media-ban-in-turkey-what-does-it-mean-by-salih-sarikaya/ |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet TİB's 2014 blocking of Twitter was ruled by the constitutional court to violate free speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-twitter-ban-idUSBREA311BF20140402 |title=Turkey's Twitter ban violates free speech: constitutional court |journal=Reuters |date=2 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, in the [[2014 Thai coup d'état]], the public was explicitly instructed not to 'share' or 'like' dissenting views on social media or face prison. In July of that same year, in response to [[WikiLeaks]]' release of a secret suppression order made by the [[Supreme Court of Victoria|Victorian Supreme Court]], media lawyers were quoted in the [[Australia]]n media to the effect that "anyone who tweets a link to the Wikileaks report, posts it on Facebook, or shares it in any way online could also face charges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/social-media-users-could-be-charged-for-sharing-wikileaks-story-20140730-zye0b.html |title=Social media users could be charged for sharing Wikileaks story |author=Mex Cooper |publisher=[[Brisbane Times]] |date=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
''The Boy Who Grew Flowers'' follows the character of Rink Bowagon, a little boy disliked among his peers that has the ability to sprout flowers on his body on full moons. This changes one day when a new girl named Angelina starts attending his class, causing Rink to become enamored of her. Rink has no way of knowing that like him, Angelina also has something special about her that he will eventually discover during the school's full moon dance.

==Reception==
Critical response to the book was positive. Reviewers for the [[School Library Journal]] called it "A lovely story about celebrating differences." In addition, the School Library Journal praised the "luminous scenes and soulful relationship between Rink and Angelina".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6704257.html?&amp;rid= Flower Power] School Library Journal&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6304308.html Preschool to Grade 4] School Library Journal&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Stage]] wrote that the book's message might be "a little sophisticated and hidden away for the lower end of the target age group." However, The Stage liked that the book expressed "the mother’s dialogue solely in musical phrases and the giant school satchel which Rink uses to hide his blushes - and his petunias."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/18636/the-boy-who-grew-flowers The Boy Who Grew Flowers] The Stage&lt;/ref&gt; [[Booklist]] praised the book, calling it an "odd, lovely offering".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.booklistonline.com/The-Boy-Who-Grew-Flowers-Steve-Adams/pid=1505059 Booklist review: The Boy Who Grew Flowers] Booklist&lt;/ref&gt; [[Publishers Weekly]] positively reviewed the book, citing "If the narrative doesn't follow through on its early promise of helping young readers understand the beauty of being different, it will remind them of the power of kindness."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-84148-686-4 Children's review: The Boy Who Grew Flowers] Publishers Weekly&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wired News]] praised the book's artwork while saying that "the fantasy on which the story is based prevents, I think, most little kids from realizing the message is there, even while they absorb it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2008/07/the-geekly-re-1-3/ The Geekly Reader: The Boy Who Grew Flowers by Jen Wojtowicz (art by Steve Adams)] Wired News&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Lincoln Conspiracy''''' is a [[book]] by David W. Balsiger and Charles E. Sellier, Jr. promoting certain [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] concerning the 1865 [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|assassination]] of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]].

==Major themes and arguments==

===Cover-up of the plan to kidnap Lincoln===
The central premise of the book is that "traditional" historians have perpetuated a [[cover-up]], originally orchestrated by Lincoln's [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]](D) and some [[Radical Republicans|Radical Republican]] allies in 1865, by over-reliance on false documentation produced by Stanton and his conspirators. This was done, the book argues, to disguise the fact that Stanton, Union spy [[Lafayette C. Baker]], [[United States Senator|Senator]] [[Benjamin F. Wade]], Senator [[John Conness]], other congressional Radical Republicans, and a group of Northern bankers and speculators were all involved in a plot to [[kidnap]] Lincoln.  Lincoln was then intended to be hidden for a time while bogus articles of [[impeachment]] would be drafted to remove him as President.  The primary motivations for this supposed plot would have been strong opposition to Lincoln's generous [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] plans and the loss of profits due to Lincoln's restrictions on the cotton trade during the [[U.S. Civil War]].

===Kidnapping changes to assassination===
The book then states that in 1864, Baker uncovered the plans of Lincoln's future assassin, [[John Wilkes Booth]], to kidnap Lincoln with the help of a different group of conspirators with different motives.  The Stanton group, through Baker and Conness, supposedly provided Booth with money and information on Lincoln's movements.  After several abortive attempts, Booth was ordered to halt his efforts in March 1865, and made no further attempts to kidnap Lincoln, but secretly resolved to murder him instead, the book alleges.

===Booth's "incriminating" diary===
Lincoln's assassination by Booth on April 14 is said to have thrown Stanton and his allies into a panic, fearing that their involvement in the kidnap plots would be exposed.  A frantic search soon turned up Booth's coat, which contained a highly incriminating [[diary]] documenting meetings with several members of the Stanton group.  A few days later on April 26, a Confederate double agent ([[James William Boyd]]), [[Mistaken identity|mistakenly identified]] as Booth, was shot and killed in [[Virginia]], according to the authors.  Stanton, aware of the mistaken identity, allegedly saw to it that the [[autopsy]] records were altered to remove or obscure descriptions of the body not consistent with Booth.  Booth's diary, now in Stanton's personal possession, is said to have had 13 pages of incriminating references removed.  Baker quietly pursued the hunt for Booth as far as [[Harper's Ferry, West Virginia]], where the trail went cold.

At the military trials of Booth's conspirators (theorized to not have been members of the Stanton group), held in May and June 1865, the proceedings were rushed, the government produced witnesses against the defendants who the authors suggest were paid, and even the trial records were supposedly altered.  Four of Booth's co-conspirators were hanged on July 7, 1865.  Others received long prison sentences, but Booth himself, the book concludes, eventually escaped to England, his whereabouts after that uncertain.

==Cold reception by historians==
''The Lincoln Conspiracy'' was greeted with hostility and derision from academic [[historian]]s.  Many objections were raised against the book's sensational theories and the authors' use (and misuse) of source materials.&lt;ref&gt;''Lincoln Legends: Myths, Hoaxes, and Confabulations Associated with Our Greatest President'' by Edward Steers Jr. ({{ISBN|1-60671-007-9}}). p.185ff&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Lincoln Conspiracy'' is often considered a form of [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|negationist]] or even [[alternate history]].

''The Lincoln Conspiracy'' was the basis of the [[1977 in film|1977]] [[The Lincoln Conspiracy (film)|film of the same name]] by [[Sunn Classic Pictures]], the publishing division of which also released the book.

==Aim ==
In the essay, Le Clézio conducts an inquiry into the brutal disappearance of the indigenous cultures of [[Mesoamerica]] in the 16th century, particularly the end of the [[Mexico|Mexican]] civilization at the hands of the Spanish [[conquistador]]s.
The author analyses the personalities of characters such as [[Hernán Cortés]], [[La Malinche]], [[Moctezuma II]], [[Cuauhtémoc]], and other key players in the conquest of Mesoamerica. He refers extensively to the descriptions offered by [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]] in his  ''[[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España]]'' in analysing the events. He imagines what might have happened if the native populations had not been reduced to silence by brutality, and what their impact on [[Western civilization]] might have been. Understanding that the West holds both economic and cultural sway over the contemporary world because of the [[European colonization of the Americas|colonization of America]], he wonders how the cultural life of Mesoamerica – particularly that of the [[Aztecs]] – would have evolved if the arrival of the Europeans had not decimated the indigenous societies through war, disease and slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pressblog.uchicago.edu/2008/10/09/the_mexican_dream_by_jmg_le_cl.html |title=The Mexican Dream by JMG Le Clézio |accessdate=10 December 2008 |work= Archived in Books for the News  |publisher=University of Chicago Press  |date=2008-10-09|quote=Teresa Lavender Fagan said"I am delighted—but not at all surprised!—that Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio has won the Nobel Prize in Literature.

{{Performing arts}}

'''Theatre''' or '''theater'''&lt;ref&gt;Originally spelled ''theatre'' and ''teatre''. From around 1550 to 1700 or later, the most common spelling was ''theater''. Between 1720 and 1750, ''theater'' was dropped in [[British English]], but was either retained or revived in [[American English]] (''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd edition, 2009, CD-ROM: {{ISBN|978-0199563838}}). Recent dictionaries of American English list ''theatre'' as a less common variant, e.g., ''Random House Webster's College Dictionary'' (1991); ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', 4th edition (2006); ''New Oxford American Dictionary'', third edition (2010); [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/theater ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary'' (2011)].&lt;/ref&gt; is a collaborative form of [[fine art]] that uses live performers, typically [[actor|actors or actresses]], to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and [[stagecraft]] such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marvin Carlson|M. Carlson]], [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/jdtc/article/view/1642/1606 "Psychic  Polyphony"], pp. 35–47 in ''Journal of Dramatic Theory and Criticism'', Fall 1986, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The specific place of the performance is also named by the word "theatre" as derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] θέατρον (théatron, "a place for viewing"), itself from θεάομαι (theáomai, "to see", "to watch", "to observe").

Modern Western theatre comes, in large measure, from the [[theatre of ancient Greece]], from which it borrows technical terminology, classification into genres, and many of its themes, [[stock character]]s, and plot elements. Theatre artist [[Patrice Pavis]] defines theatricality, [[Theatre language|theatrical language]], stage writing and the [[Medium specificity|specificity]] of theatre as synonymous expressions that differentiate theatre from the other [[performing arts]], [[literature]] and [[the arts]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pavis|1998|pp=345–346}}. Drawing on the "[[semiotic]]s" of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], Pavis goes on to suggest that "the specificity of theatrical signs may lie in their ability to use [[Semiotic theory of Charles Sanders Peirce#II. Icon, index, symbol|the three possible functions of signs]]: as [[Iconicity|icon]] ([[Mimesis|mimetically]]), as [[Indexicality|index]] (in the situation of [[enunciation]]), or as symbol (as a [[Semiotics|semiological system]] in the fictional mode). In effect, theatre makes the sources of the words visual and concrete: it indicates {{em|and}} incarnates a fictional world by means of signs, such that by the end of the process of signification and symbolization the spectator has reconstructed a theoretical and aesthetic model that accounts for the dramatic universe."&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern theatre includes performances of [[play (theatre)|plays]] and [[musical theatre]]. The art forms of [[ballet]] and [[opera]] are also theatre and use many conventions such as acting, costumes and staging. They were influential to the development of musical theatre; see those articles for more information.

[[File:Phlyax scene Louvre CA7249.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A depiction of actors playing the roles of a master (right) and his slave (left) in a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[phlyax play]], circa 350/340 BCE]]
The [[Polis|city-state]] of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] is where western theatre originated.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 441), Cartledge (1997, 3–5), Goldhill (1997, 54). Brown writes that [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greek drama]] "was essentially the creation of [[classical Athens]]: all the dramatists who were later regarded as classics were active at Athens in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE (the time of the [[Athenian democracy]]), and all the surviving plays date from this period" (1998, 441). "The dominant culture of [[Classical Athens|Athens in the fifth century]]", Goldhill writes, "can be said to have invented theatre" (1997, 54).&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of a broader [[culture]] of theatricality and performance in [[classical Greece]] that included [[Athenian festivals|festivals]], [[Religion in ancient Greece|religious rituals]], [[Ancient Greece#Political structure|politics]], [[Ancient Greek law|law]], athletics and gymnastics, [[Music of ancient Greece|music]], [[Ancient Greek literature#Classical and Pre-Classical Antiquity|poetry]], weddings, funerals, and ''[[Symposium|symposia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cartledge (1997, 3, 6), Goldhill (1997, 54) and (1999, 20–xx), and Rehm (1992. 3). Goldhill argues that although activities that form "an integral part of the exercise of citizenship" (such as when "the Athenian citizen speaks in the Assembly, exercises in the gymnasium, sings at the symposium, or courts a boy") each have their "own regime of display and regulation," nevertheless the term "performance" provides "a useful heuristic category to explore the connections and overlaps between these different areas of activity" (1999, 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Participation in the city-state's many festivals—and mandatory attendance at the [[Dionysia#City Dionysia|City Dionysia]] as an audience member (or even as a participant in the theatrical productions) in particular—was an important part of [[citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;Pelling (2005, 83).&lt;/ref&gt; Civic participation also involved the evaluation of the [[rhetoric]] of [[orators]] evidenced in performances in the [[Athenian law court (classical period)|law-court]] or [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|political assembly]], both of which were understood as analogous to the theatre and increasingly came to absorb its dramatic vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhill (1999, 25) and Pelling (2005, 83–84).&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks also developed the concepts of [[dramatic criticism]] and theatre architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Dukore (1974, 31), Janko (1987, ix), and Ward (1945, 1).&lt;!-- These citations only support "criticism" - need others for professional actors and architecture --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Actors were either amateur or at best semi-professional.&lt;ref&gt;novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/spd130et/ancientgreek.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The [[theatre of ancient Greece]] consisted of three types of [[drama]]: [[tragedy]], [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], and the [[satyr play]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–19).&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of theatre in ancient Greece, according to Aristotle (384–322 BCE), the first theoretician of theatre, are to be found in the festivals that honoured Dionysus. The performances were given in semi-circular auditoria cut into hillsides, capable of seating 10,000–20,000 people. The stage consisted of a dancing floor (orchestra), dressing room and scene-building area (skene). Since the words were the most important part, good acoustics and clear delivery were paramount. The actors (always men) wore masks appropriate to the characters they represented, and each might play several parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/chambdictwh/theatre|title=Credo Reference Library Login Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athenian tragedy—the oldest surviving form of tragedy—is a type of [[dance]]-drama that formed an important part of the theatrical culture of the city-state.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 441), Cartledge (1997, 3–5), Goldhill (1997, 54), Ley (2007, 206), and Styan (2000, 140). Taxidou notes that "most scholars now call 'Greek' tragedy 'Athenian' tragedy, which is historically correct" (2004, 104).&lt;/ref&gt; Having emerged sometime during the 6th century BCE, it flowered during the 5th century BCE (from the end of which it began to spread throughout the Greek world), and continued to be popular until the beginning of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 32–33), Brown (1998, 444), and Cartledge (1997, 3–5). Cartledge writes that although [[Classical Athens|Athenians]] of the 4th century judged [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]] "as the nonpareils of the [[genre]], and regularly honoured their plays with revivals, tragedy itself was not merely a 5th-century phenomenon, the product of a short-lived [[Fifth-century Athens|golden age]]. If not attaining the quality and stature of the fifth-century 'classics', original tragedies nonetheless continued to be written and produced and competed with in large numbers throughout the remaining life of the [[Athenian democracy|democracy]]—and beyond it" (1997, 33).&lt;/ref&gt;

No tragedies from the 6th century BCE and only 32 of the more than a thousand that were performed in during the 5th century BCE have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15) and Kovacs (2005, 379). We have seven by Aeschylus, seven by Sophocles, and eighteen by Euripides. In addition, we also have the ''[[Cyclops (play)|Cyclops]]'', a satyr play by Euripides. Some critics since the 17th century have argued that one of the tragedies that the classical tradition gives as Euripides'—''[[Rhesus (play)|Rhesus]]''—is a 4th-century play by an unknown author; modern scholarship agrees with the classical authorities and ascribes the play to Euripides; see Walton (1997, viii, xix). (This uncertainty accounts for Brockett and Hildy's figure of 31 tragedies.)&lt;/ref&gt; We have complete texts [[Extant literature|extant]] by [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15). The theory that ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' was not written by [[Aeschylus]] adds a fourth, anonymous playwright to those whose work survives.&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of tragedy remain obscure, though by the 5th century BCE it was [[institution]]alised in competitions (''[[agon]]'') held as part of festivities celebrating [[Dionysus]] (the [[Family tree of the Greek gods|god]] of [[wine]] and [[fertility]]).&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 13–15) and Brown (1998, 441–447).&lt;/ref&gt; As contestants in the City Dionysia's competition (the most prestigious of the festivals to stage drama) playwrights were required to present a [[tetralogy]] of plays (though the individual works were not necessarily connected by story or theme), which usually consisted of three tragedies and one satyr play.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 442) and Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–17).

Exceptions to this pattern were made, as with [[Euripides]]' ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'' in 438 BCE. There were also separate competitions at the [[Dionysia#City Dionysia|City Dionysia]] for the performance of [[dithyramb]]s and, after 488–7 BCE, [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedies]].&lt;/ref&gt; The performance of tragedies at the City Dionysia may have begun as early as 534 BCE; official records (''didaskaliai'') begin from 501 BCE, when the satyr play was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 13, 15) and Brown (1998, 442). Rehm offers the following argument as evidence that tragedy was not institutionalised until 501 BCE: "The specific cult honoured at the [[Dionysia#City Dionysia|City Dionysia]] was that of Dionysus Eleuthereus, the god 'having to do with [[Eleutherae]]', a town on the border between [[Boeotia]] and [[Attica]] that had a sanctuary to Dionysus. At some point [[Classical Athens|Athens]] annexed Eleutherae—most likely after the overthrow of the [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratid]] tyranny in 510 and the democratic reforms of [[Cleisthenes]] in 508–07 BCE—and the cult-image of Dionysus Eleuthereus was moved to its new home. Athenians re-enacted the incorporation of the god's cult every year in a preliminary rite to the City Dionysia. On the day before the festival proper, the cult-statue was removed from the [[Greek temple|temple]] near the [[theatre of Dionysus]] and taken to a temple on the road to Eleutherae. That evening, after [[Animal sacrifice|sacrifice]] and [[hymn]]s, a torchlight procession carried the statue back to the temple, a symbolic re-creation of the god's arrival into Athens, as well as a reminder of the inclusion of the Boeotian town into Attica. As the name Eleutherae is extremely close to eleutheria, 'freedom', Athenians probably felt that the new cult was particularly appropriate for celebrating their own political liberation and democratic reforms." (1992, 15).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Athenian tragedies dramatise events from [[Greek mythology]], though ''[[The Persians]]''—which stages the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] response to news of their military defeat at the [[Battle of Salamis]] in 480 BCE—is the notable exception in the surviving drama.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 442). [[Jean-Pierre Vernant]] argues that in ''[[The Persians]]'' [[Aeschylus]] substitutes for the usual temporal distance between the audience and the [[Greek Heroic Age|age of heroes]] a spatial distance between the Western audience and the Eastern [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian culture]]. This substitution, he suggests, produces a similar effect: "The 'historic' events evoked by the chorus, recounted by the messenger and interpreted by Darius' ghost are presented on stage in a legendary atmosphere. The light that the tragedy sheds upon them is not that in which the political happenings of the day are normally seen; it reaches the Athenian theatre refracted from a distant world of elsewhere, making what is absent seem present and visible on the stage"; Vernant and Vidal-Naquet (1988, 245).&lt;/ref&gt; When Aeschylus won first prize for it at the City Dionysia in 472 BCE, he had been writing tragedies for more than 25 years, yet its tragic treatment of recent history is the earliest example of [[drama]] to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 442) and Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–16).&lt;/ref&gt; More than 130 years later, the philosopher [[Aristotle]] analysed 5th-century Athenian tragedy in the oldest surviving work of [[dramatic theory]]—his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE).

[[Ancient Greek comedy|Athenian comedy]] is conventionally divided into three periods, "Old Comedy", "Middle Comedy", and "New Comedy". Old Comedy survives today largely in the form of the eleven surviving plays of [[Aristophanes]], while Middle Comedy is largely lost (preserved only in relatively short fragments in authors such as [[Athenaeus of Naucratis]]). New Comedy is known primarily from the substantial papyrus fragments of [[Menander]]. Aristotle defined comedy as a representation of laughable people that involves some kind of blunder or ugliness that does not cause pain or disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1449a line 1449a]: "Comedy, as we have said, is a representation of inferior people, not indeed in the full sense of the word bad, but the laughable is a species of the base or ugly. It consists in some blunder or ugliness that does not cause pain or disaster, an obvious example being the comic mask which is ugly and distorted but not painful'."&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the categories of comedy and tragedy at the City Dionysia, the festival also included the [[Satyr play|Satyr Play]]. Finding its origins in rural, agricultural rituals dedicated to Dionysus, the satyr play eventually found its way to Athens in its most well-known form. Satyr's themselves were tied to the god Dionysus as his loyal woodland  companions, often engaging in drunken revelry and mischief at his side. The satyr play itself was classified as tragicomedy, erring on the side of the more modern burlesque traditions of the early twentieth century. The plotlines of the plays were typically concerned with the dealings of the pantheon of Gods and their involvement in human affairs, backed by the chorus of [[Satyrs]]. However, according to Webster, satyr actors did not always perform typical satyr actions and would break from the acting traditions assigned to the character type of a mythical forest creature.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, T.B.L. “Monuments Illustrating Tragedy and Satyr Play (Second Edition with Appendix).” Bulletin Supplement (University of London. Institute of Classical Studies), no. 20, 1967, pp. iii–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman theatre===
{{Main article|Theatre of ancient Rome}}
[[File:Pompeii - Villa del Cicerone - Mosaic - MAN.jpg|thumb|Mosaic depicting masked actors in a play: two women consult a "witch"]]
Western theatre developed and expanded considerably under the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The Roman historian [[Livy]] wrote that the Romans first experienced theatre in the 4th century BCE, with a performance by [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] actors.&lt;ref&gt;Beacham (1996, 2).&lt;/ref&gt; Beacham argues that they had been familiar with "pre-theatrical practices" for some time before that recorded contact.&lt;ref&gt;Beacham (1996, 3).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[theatre of ancient Rome]] was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from [[Roman festival|festival]] performances of [[street theatre]], nude dancing, and [[acrobatics]], to the staging of [[Plautus]]'s broadly appealing situation [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]], to the [[high culture|high-style]], verbally elaborate [[Tragedy|tragedies]] of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Although Rome had a native tradition of performance, the [[Hellenization]] of [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] in the 3rd century BCE had a profound and energizing effect on Roman theatre and encouraged the development of [[Latin literature]] of the highest quality for the stage. The only surviving Roman tragedies, indeed the only plays of any kind from the Roman Empire, are ten dramas- nine of them pallilara- attributed to Lucuis Annaeus Seneca (4 BCE–65 CE), the Corduba-born Stoic philosopher and tutor of Nero.&lt;ref&gt;John, Gassner, and Allen Ralph.

[[File:Kovalan.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Koothu]] is an ancient form of performing art that originated in early [[Tamilakam]].]]
The earliest-surviving fragments of [[Sanskrit drama]] date from the 1st century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1981, xvii) and  (1998, 516–517).&lt;/ref&gt; The wealth of archeological evidence from earlier periods offers no indication of the existence of a tradition of theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond516" &gt;Richmond (1998, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient ''[[Vedas]]'' ([[hymn]]s from between 1500 and 1000 BCE that are among the earliest examples of [[History of literature#India|literature]] in the world) contain no hint of it (although a small number are composed in a form of [[dialogue]]) and the [[ritual]]s of the [[Vedic period]] do not appear to have developed into theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond516" /&gt; The ''[[Mahābhāṣya]]'' by [[Patañjali]] contains the earliest reference to what may have been the seeds of Sanskrit drama.&lt;ref name="Richmond517" &gt;Richmond (1998, 517).&lt;/ref&gt; This treatise on [[grammar]] from 140 BCE provides a feasible date for the beginnings of [[theatre in India]].&lt;ref name="Richmond517" /&gt;

The major source of evidence for Sanskrit theatre is ''[[Natyashastra|A Treatise on Theatre]]'' (''Nātyaśāstra''), a compendium whose date of composition is uncertain (estimates range from 200 BCE to 200 CE) and whose authorship is attributed to [[Bharata Muni]]. The ''Treatise'' is the most complete work of dramaturgy in the ancient world. It addresses [[acting]], [[dance]], [[music]], [[Dramaturgy|dramatic construction]], [[Theatre architecture|architecture]], [[Costume design|costuming]], [[Theatrical makeup|make-up]], [[Theatrical properties|props]], the organisation of companies, the audience, competitions, and offers a [[Hindu mythology|mythological]] account of the origin of theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond517" /&gt; In doing so, it provides indications about the nature of actual theatrical practices. Sanskrit theatre was performed on sacred ground by priests who had been trained in the necessary skills (dance, music, and recitation) in a [hereditary process]. Its aim was both to educate and to entertain.

[[File:കൂടിയാട്ടത്തിലെസുഗ്രീവൻ.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Performer playing [[Sugriva]] in the [[Koodiyattam]] form of [[Sanskrit drama|Sanskrit theatre]].]]

Under the patronage of royal courts, performers belonged to professional companies that were directed by a stage manager (''sutradhara''), who may also have acted.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1981, xvii) and Richmond (1998, 517).&lt;/ref&gt; This task was thought of as being analogous to that of a [[Puppetry|puppeteer]]—the literal meaning of "''sutradhara''" is "holder of the strings or threads".&lt;ref name="Richmond517" /&gt; The performers were trained rigorously in vocal and physical technique.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond (1998, 518).&lt;/ref&gt; There were no prohibitions against female performers; companies were all-male, all-female, and of mixed gender. Certain sentiments were considered inappropriate for men to enact, however, and were thought better suited to women. Some performers played characters their own age, while others played ages different from their own (whether younger or older). Of all the elements of theatre, the ''Treatise'' gives most attention to acting (''abhinaya''), which consists of two styles: realistic (''lokadharmi'') and conventional (''natyadharmi''), though the major focus is on the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond (1998, 518). The literal meaning of ''abhinaya'' is "to carry forwards".&lt;/ref&gt;

Its drama is regarded as the highest achievement of [[Sanskrit literature]].&lt;ref name="Brandonxvii" &gt;Brandon (1981, xvii).&lt;/ref&gt; It utilised [[stock character]]s, such as the hero (''nayaka''), heroine (''nayika''), or clown (''vidusaka''). Actors may have specialised in a particular type. [[Kālidāsa]] in the 1st century BCE, is arguably considered to be ancient [[India]]'s greatest Sanskrit dramatist. Three famous romantic plays written by Kālidāsa are the ''[[Mālavikāgnimitram]]'' (''Mālavikā and Agnimitra''), ''[[Vikramuurvashiiya]]'' (''Pertaining to Vikrama and Urvashi''), and ''[[The Recognition of Sakuntala|Abhijñānaśākuntala]]'' (''The Recognition of Shakuntala''). The last was inspired by a story in the ''Mahabharata'' and is the most famous. It was the first to be translated into [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]]. ''[[Abhijñānaśākuntalam|Śakuntalā]]'' (in English translation) influenced [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe's]] ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' (1808–1832).&lt;ref name="Brandonxvii" /&gt;

The next great Indian dramatist was [[Bhavabhuti]] (c. 7th century CE). He is said to have written the following three plays: ''Malati-Madhava'', ''Mahaviracharita'' and ''Uttar Ramacharita''. Among these three, the last two cover between them the entire epic of ''Ramayana''. The powerful Indian emperor [[Harsha]] (606–648) is credited with having written three plays: the comedy ''[[Ratnavali]]'', ''[[Priyadarsika]]'', and the [[Buddhist]] drama ''[[Nagananda]]''.

===Chinese theatre===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
[[File:Lijiang Yunnan China-Naxi-people-carrying-baskets-01.jpg|thumb|Public performance in Jade Dragon Snow Mountain Open Air Theatre.]]
There are references to theatrical entertainments in China as early as the [[Shang Dynasty]]; they often involved happiness, mimes, and acrobatic displays.The [[Tang Dynasty]] is sometimes known as "The Age of 1000 Entertainments". During this era, Ming Huang formed an acting school known as The [[Pear Garden]] to produce a form of drama that was primarily musical. That is why actors are commonly called "Children of the Pear Garden." During the Dynasty of Empress Ling, [[Shadow play|shadow puppetry]] first emerged as a recognized form of theatre in China. There were two distinct forms of shadow puppetry, Pekingese (northern) and Cantonese (southern). The two styles were differentiated by the method of making the puppets and the positioning of the rods on the [[puppets]], as opposed to the type of [[Play (theatre)|play]] performed by the puppets. Both styles generally performed plays depicting great adventure and fantasy, rarely was this very stylized form of theatre used for political propaganda.

Cantonese shadow puppets were the larger of the two. They were built using thick leather which created more substantial shadows. Symbolic color was also very prevalent; a black face represented honesty, a red one bravery. The rods used to control Cantonese puppets were attached perpendicular to the puppets’ heads. Thus, they were not seen by the audience when the shadow was created. Pekingese puppets were more delicate and smaller. They were created out of thin, translucent leather (usually taken from the belly of a donkey).They were painted with vibrant paints, thus they cast a very colorful shadow. The thin rods which controlled their movements were attached to a leather collar at the neck of the puppet. The rods ran parallel to the bodies of the puppet then turned at a ninety degree angle to connect to the neck. While these rods were visible when the shadow was cast, they laid outside the shadow of the puppet; thus they did not interfere with the appearance of the figure. The rods attached at the necks to facilitate the use of multiple heads with one body. When the heads were not being used, they were stored in a muslin book or fabric lined box. The heads were always removed at night. This was in keeping with the old superstition that if left intact, the puppets would come to life at night. Some puppeteers went so far as to store the heads in one book and the bodies in another, to further reduce the possibility of reanimating puppets. Shadow puppetry is said to have reached its highest point of artistic development in the eleventh century before becoming a tool of the government.

In the [[Song Dynasty]], there were many popular plays involving acrobatics and music. These developed in the [[Yuan Dynasty]] into a more sophisticated form known as ''[[zaju]]'', with a four- or five-act structure. Yuan drama spread across China and diversified into numerous regional forms, one of the best known of which is Beijing Opera,{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} which is still popular today.

[[Xiangsheng]] is a certain traditional Chinese comedic performance in the forms of monologue or dialogue.

===Post-classical theatre in the West===

Theatre took on many alternate forms in the West between the 15th and 19th centuries, including ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' and [[melodrama]]. The general trend was away from the poetic drama of the Greeks and the [[Renaissance]] and toward a more naturalistic prose style of dialogue, especially following the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuritz (1988, 305).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Obviously, this is just a place-holder, as much is missing. --&gt;

Theatre took a big pause during 1642 and 1660 in England because of the [[Puritans|Puritan]] Interregnum. Theatre was seen as something sinful and the Puritans tried very hard to drive it out of their society. This stagnant period ended once Charles II came back to the throne in 1660 in the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]. Theatre (among other arts) exploded, with influence from French culture, since Charles had been exiled in France in the years previous to his reign.

One of the big changes was the new theatre house. Instead of the type of the Elizabethan era, such as the [[Globe Theatre]], round with no place for the actors to really prep for the next act and with no "theatre manners,” the theatre house became transformed into a place of refinement, with a stage in front and stadium seating facing it. Since seating was no longer all the way around the stage, it became prioritized—some seats were obviously better than others. The king would have the best seat in the house: the very middle of the theatre, which got the widest view of the stage as well as the best way to see the point of view and vanishing point that the stage was constructed around. [[Philippe Jacques de Loutherbourg]] was one of the most influential set designers of the time because of his use of floor space and scenery.

Because of the turmoil before this time, there was still some controversy about what should and should not be put on the stage. [[Jeremy Collier]], a preacher, was one of the heads in this movement through his piece ''A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage''. The beliefs in this paper were mainly held by non-theatre goers and the remainder of the Puritans and very religious of the time. The main question was if seeing something immoral on stage affects behavior in the lives of those who watch it, a controversy that is still playing out today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Scott R.|title=The English Theatre, 1642–1800|url=http://www.cwu.edu/~robinsos/ppages/resources/Theatre_History/Theahis_10.html|work=Scott R.

The seventeenth century had also introduced women to the stage, which was considered inappropriate earlier. These women were regarded as celebrities (also a newer concept, thanks to ideas on individualism that arose in the wake of [[Renaissance Humanism]]), but on the other hand, it was still very new and revolutionary that they were on the stage, and some said they were unladylike, and looked down on them. Charles II did not like young men playing the parts of young women, so he asked that women play their own parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's Lives Surrounding Late 18th Century Theatre|url=http://engl3621mgc.tripod.com/|work=English 3621 Writing by Women|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because women were allowed on the stage, playwrights had more leeway with plot twists, like women dressing as men, and having narrow escapes from morally sticky situations as forms of comedy.

Comedies were full of the young and very much in vogue, with the storyline following their love lives: commonly a young roguish hero professing his love to the chaste and free minded heroine near the end of the play, much like [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan's]] ''[[The School for Scandal]]''. Many of the comedies were fashioned after the French tradition, mainly Molière, again hailing back to the French influence brought back by the King and the Royals after their exile. [[Molière]] was one of the top comedic playwrights of the time, revolutionizing the way comedy was written and performed by combining Italian [[commedia dell'arte]] and [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] French comedy to create some of the longest lasting and most influential satiric comedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bermel|first=Albert|title=Moliere – French Dramatist|url=http://www.discoverfrance.net/France/Theatre/Moliere/moliere.shtml|work=Discover France|publisher=Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tragedies were similarly victorious in their sense of righting political power, especially poignant because of the recent Restoration of the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=Joseph|title=The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: Volume 3: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century|year=2010|publisher=Broadview Press|location=Canada|isbn=978-1551116112|pages=533–535|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also imitations of French tragedy, although the French had a larger distinction between comedy and tragedy, whereas the English fudged the lines occasionally and put some comedic parts in their tragedies. Common forms of non-comedic plays were sentimental comedies as well as something that would later be called ''tragédie bourgeoise'', or [[domestic tragedy]]—that is, the tragedy of common life—were more popular in England because they appealed more to English sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matthew|first=Brander|title=The Drama in the 18th Century|url=http://www.imagi-nation.com/moonstruck/clsc20w1.html|work=Moonstruch Drama Bookstore|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While theatre troupes were formerly often travelling, the idea of the national theatre gained support in the 18th century, inspired by [[Ludvig Holberg]]. The major promoter of the idea of the national theatre in Germany, and also of the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' poets, was [[Abel Seyler]], the owner of the [[Hamburgische Entreprise]] and the [[Seyler Theatre Company]].&lt;ref name="abel-seyler"&gt;Wilhelm Kosch, "Seyler, Abel", in ''Dictionary of German Biography'', eds. Walther Killy and Rudolf Vierhaus, Vol. 9, Walter de Gruyter, 2005, {{ISBN|3110966298}}, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the [[Nineteenth-century theatre|19th century]], the popular theatrical forms of [[Romanticism]], [[melodrama]], [[Victorian burlesque]] and the [[well-made play]]s of [[Eugène Scribe|Scribe]] and [[Victorien Sardou|Sardou]] gave way to the [[problem play]]s of [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]] and [[Realism (theatre)|Realism]]; the [[farce]]s of [[Georges Feydeau|Feydeau]]; [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] [[opera]]tic ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]''; [[musical theatre]] (including [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s operas); [[F. C. Burnand]]'s, [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s and [[Oscar Wilde]]'s drawing-room comedies; [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]; proto-[[Expressionism]] in the late works of [[August Strindberg]] and [[Henrik Ibsen]];&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 293–426).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edwardian musical comedy]].

These trends continued through the [[Twentieth-century theatre|20th century]] in the [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] of [[Constantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]] and [[Lee Strasberg]], the political theatre of [[Erwin Piscator]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]], the so-called [[Theatre of the Absurd]] of [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Eugène Ionesco]], American and British musicals, the collective creations of companies of actors and directors such as [[Joan Littlewood]]'s [[Theatre Workshop]], experimental and [[postmodern theatre]] of [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] and [[Robert Lepage]], the [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] theatre of [[August Wilson]] or [[Tomson Highway]], and [[Augusto Boal]]'s [[Theatre of the Oppressed]].

[[File:Demon Yakshagana.jpg|upright|thumb|''[[Rakshasa]]'' or the demon as depicted in [[Yakshagana]], a form of musical [[dance]]-[[drama]] from [[Theatre of India|India]]]]
The first form of [[Theatre of India|Indian theatre]] was the [[Sanskrit drama|Sanskrit theatre]].&lt;ref name="Richmond, Swann 1993"&gt;Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 12).&lt;/ref&gt; It began after the development of [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]] and before the development of theatre in other parts of Asia.&lt;ref name="Richmond, Swann 1993"/&gt; It emerged sometime between the 2nd century BCE and the 1st century CE and flourished between the 1st century CE and the 10th, which was a period of relative peace in the [[history of India]] during which hundreds of plays were written.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1997, 70) and Richmond (1998, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese forms of [[Kabuki]], [[Noh|Nō]], and [[Kyōgen]] developed in the 17th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Deal (2007, 276).&lt;/ref&gt; Theatre in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] included [[puppet]] theatre (which included hand puppets, [[shadow play]]s and [[marionette]] productions) and live passion plays known as ''ta'ziya'', where actors re-enact episodes from [[Muslim history]]. In particular, [[Shia Islam]]ic plays revolved around the ''[[Shahid|shaheed]]'' (martyrdom) of [[Ali]]'s sons [[Hasan ibn Ali]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali]]. Secular plays were known as ''akhraja'', recorded in medieval ''[[Adab (behavior)|adab]]'' literature, though they were less common than puppetry and ''ta'ziya'' theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Moreh (1986, 565–601).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Drama===
{{main article|Drama}}
[[Drama]] is the specific [[Mode (literature)|mode]] of [[fiction]] [[Mimesis|represented]] in [[performance]].&lt;ref name="elam98"&gt;Elam (1980, 98).&lt;/ref&gt; The term comes from a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning "[[Action (philosophy)|action]]", which is derived from the verb δράω, ''dráō'', "to do" or "to act". The enactment of drama in theatre, performed by [[actor]]s on a [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] before an [[audience]], presupposes [[Collaboration|collaborative]] modes of production and a [[collective]] form of reception. The [[Dramatic structure|structure of dramatic texts]], unlike other forms of [[literature]], is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception.&lt;ref name="Pfister 1977, 11"&gt;Pfister (1977, 11).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[English Renaissance theatre|early modern]] [[tragedy]] ''[[Hamlet]]'' ([[1601 in literature|1601]]) by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|classical Athenian]] tragedy ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' (c. 429 BCE) by [[Sophocles]] are among the masterpieces of the art of drama.&lt;ref&gt;Fergusson (1949, 2–3).&lt;/ref&gt; A modern example is ''[[Long Day's Journey into Night]]'' by [[Eugene O'Neill]] (1956).&lt;ref&gt;Burt (2008, 30–35).&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered as a genre of [[poetry]] in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the [[Epic poetry|epic]] and the [[Lyric poetry|lyrical]] modes ever since [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE)—the earliest work of [[dramatic theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Fergusson]] writes that "a drama, as distinguished from a [[Lyric poetry|lyric]], is not primarily a composition in the verbal medium; the [[Dialogue (fiction)|words]] result, as one might put it, from the underlying [[Dramatic structure|structure of incident]] and [[Character (arts)|character]]. As [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Aristotle]] remarks, 'the poet, or "maker" should be the maker of [[Plot (narrative)|plots]] rather than of verses; since he is a poet because he [[Mimesis|imiates]], and what he imitates are [[Action (philosophy)|actions]]'" (1949, 8).&lt;/ref&gt; The use of "drama" in the narrow sense to designate a specific ''type'' of [[Play (theatre)|play]] dates from the [[Nineteenth-century theatre|19th century]]. Drama in this sense refers to a play that is ''neither'' a comedy nor a tragedy—for example, [[Émile Zola|Zola's]] ''[[Thérèse Raquin]]'' ([[1873 in literature|1873]]) or [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov's]] ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'' ([[1887 in literature|1887]]). In Ancient Greece however, the word ''drama'' encompassed all theatrical plays, tragic, comic, or anything in between.

Drama is often combined with [[theatre music|music]] and [[dance]]: the drama in [[opera]] is generally sung throughout; [[Musical theatre|musicals]] generally include both spoken [[dialogue]] and [[song]]s; and some forms of drama have [[incidental music]] or musical accompaniment underscoring the dialogue ([[melodrama]] and Japanese [[Noh|Nō]], for example).&lt;ref name="cgt"&gt;See the entries for "opera", "musical theatre, American", "melodrama" and "Nō" in Banham (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In certain periods of history (the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and modern [[Romanticism|Romantic]]) some dramas have been written to be [[Closet drama|read]] rather than performed.&lt;ref name="closet"&gt;While there is some dispute among theatre historians, it is probable that the plays by the Roman [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] were not intended to be performed. ''[[Manfred]]'' by [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]] is a good example of a "[[Verse drama and dramatic verse|dramatic poem]]." See the entries on "Seneca" and "Byron (George George)" in Banham (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Improvisational theatre|improvisation]], the drama does not pre-exist the moment of performance; performers devise a dramatic script spontaneously before an audience.&lt;ref name="impro"&gt;Some forms of improvisation, notably the [[Commedia dell'arte]], improvise on the basis of '[[lazzi]]' or rough outlines of scenic action (see Gordon (1983) and Duchartre (1929)). All forms of improvisation take their cue from their immediate response to one another, their characters' situations (which are sometimes established in advance), and, often, their interaction with the audience. The classic formulations of improvisation in the theatre originated with [[Joan Littlewood]] and [[Keith Johnstone]] in the UK and [[Viola Spolin]] in the US; see Johnstone (1981) and Spolin (1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical theatre===
{{Main article|Musical theatre}}
[[Music]] and theatre have had a close relationship since ancient times—[[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[tragedy]], for example, was a form of [[dance]]-[[drama]] that employed a [[Greek chorus|chorus]] whose parts were sung (to the accompaniment of an ''[[aulos]]''—an instrument comparable to the modern [[clarinet]]), as were some of the actors' responses and their 'solo songs' ([[Monody|monodies]]).&lt;ref&gt;Rehm (1992, 150n7).&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[musical theatre]] is a form of theatre that also combines music, spoken dialogue, and dance. It emerged from [[comic opera]] (especially [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]), [[Variety show|variety]], [[vaudeville]], and [[music hall]] genres of the late [[Nineteenth-century theatre|19th]] and early [[Twentieth-century theatre|20th century]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones (2003, 4–11).&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Edwardian musical comedy]] that began in the 1890s, the [[Princess Theatre, New York City|Princess Theatre]] musicals of the early 20th century, and comedies in the 1920s and 1930s (such as the works of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]), with ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943), musicals moved in a more dramatic direction.&lt;ref&gt;The first "[[Edwardian musical comedy]]" is usually considered to be ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'' (1892), even though it was produced eight years before the beginning of the [[Edwardian era]]; see, for example, Fraser Charlton, [http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/fraser.charlton/edmuscom/page12/edmuscom_what.html "What are EdMusComs?"] (FrasrWeb 2007, accessed May 12, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Famous musicals over the subsequent decades included ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' (1956), ''[[West Side Story]]'' (1957), ''[[The Fantasticks]]'' (1960), ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' (1967), ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' (1975), ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' (1980), ''[[Into the Woods]]'' (1986), and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1986),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first = John| last = Kenrick | title = History of Stage Musicals| url = http://www.musicals101.com/erastage.htm| year = 2003| accessdate = May 26, 2009}}&lt;!-- Looking for a printed source in preference to theatre dept's webpage --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as more contemporary hits including ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' (1994), ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]'' (1997), ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'' (2003), and ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]'' (2015).

Musical theatre may be produced on an intimate scale [[Off-Broadway]], in [[Community theatre|regional theatres]], and elsewhere, but it often includes spectacle. For instance, [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and [[West End theatre|West End]] musicals often include lavish costumes and sets supported by multimillion-dollar budgets.&lt;!-- Need a source that says B/WE musicals often include these, rather than an example --&gt;

===Comedy===
{{Main article|Comedy}}

Theatre productions that use [[humour]] as a vehicle to tell a story qualify as comedies. This may include a modern [[farce]] such as ''[[Boeing-Boeing (play)|Boeing Boeing]]'' or a classical play such as ''[[As You Like It]]''. Theatre expressing bleak, controversial or taboo subject matter in a deliberately humorous way is referred to as [[black comedy]]. Black Comedy can have several genres like slapstick humour, dark and sarcastic comedy.

===Tragedy===
{{Main article|Tragedy}}
{{quote|Tragedy, then, is an imitation of an action that is serious, complete, and of a certain magnitude: in language embellished with each kind of artistic ornament, the several kinds being found in separate parts of the play; in the form of action, not of narrative; through pity and fear effecting the proper purgation of these emotions.|[[Aristotle]]|[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]&lt;ref&gt;S.H. Butcher, [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/poetics/], 2011&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aristotle's phrase "several kinds being found in separate parts of the play" is a reference to the structural origins of drama. In it the spoken parts were written in the [[Attic dialect]] whereas the choral (recited or sung) ones in the [[Doric Greek|Doric dialect]], these discrepancies reflecting the differing religious origins and [[Metre (poetry)|poetic metres]] of the parts that were fused into a new entity, the theatrical ''drama''.

[[Tragedy]] refers to a specific [[Poetic tradition|tradition]] of [[drama]] that has played a unique and important role historically in the self-definition of [[Western culture|Western civilisation]].&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 1118) and Williams (1966, 14–16).&lt;/ref&gt; That tradition has been multiple and discontinuous, yet the term has often been used to invoke a powerful effect of [[cultural identity]] and historical continuity—"the [[Classical Athens|Greeks]] and the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethans]], in one cultural form; [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenes]] and [[Christian]]s, in a common activity," as [[Raymond Williams]] puts it.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1966, 16).&lt;/ref&gt; From its obscure origins in the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theatres of Athens]] 2,500 years ago, from which there survives only a fraction of the work of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], through its singular articulations in the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]], and [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], to the more recent [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] tragedy of [[August Strindberg|Strindberg]], [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett's]] [[Modernism|modernist]] meditations on death, loss and suffering, and [[Heiner Müller|Müller's]] [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] reworkings of the tragic canon, tragedy has remained an important site of cultural experimentation, negotiation, struggle, and change.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1966, 13–84) and Taxidou (2004, 193–209).&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (335 BCE), tragedy has been used to make [[genre]] distinctions, whether at the scale of [[poetry]] in general (where the tragic divides against [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[Lyric poetry|lyric]]) or at the scale of the drama (where tragedy is opposed to [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]]). In the [[Modernity|modern]] era, tragedy has also been defined against drama, [[melodrama]], [[Tragicomedy|the tragicomic]], and [[epic theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;See Carlson (1993), Pfister (1977), Elam (1980) and Taxidou (2004). [[Drama]], in the narrow sense, cuts across the traditional division between comedy and tragedy in an anti- or a-[[Genre|generic]] [[deterritorialization]] from the [[Nineteenth century theatre|mid-19th century]] onwards. Both [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Augusto Boal]] define their [[epic theatre]] projects ([[Non-Aristotelian drama]] and [[Theatre of the Oppressed]] respectively) against models of [[tragedy]]. Taxidou, however, reads epic theatre as an incorporation of tragic functions and its treatments of mourning and speculation (2004, 193–209).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improvisation===
{{Main article|Improvisational theatre}}
Improvisation has been a consistent feature of theatre, with the Commedia dell'arte in the sixteenth century being recognised as the first improvisation form. Popularized by Nobel Prize Winner [[Dario Fo]] and troupes such as the [[Upright Citizens Brigade]] improvisational theatre continues to evolve with many different streams and philosophies. [[Keith Johnstone]] and [[Viola Spolin]] are recognized as the first teachers of improvisation in modern times, with Johnstone exploring improvisation as an alternative to scripted theatre and Spolin and her successors exploring improvisation principally as a tool for developing dramatic work or skills or as a form for situational comedy. Spolin also became interested in how the process of learning improvisation was applicable to the development of human potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=194|title=The Purpose of Playing: Modern Acting Theories in Perspective|first=Robert|last=Gordon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FmAue-VUMmYC&amp;lpg=PA194&amp;dq=Viola%20Spolin%20purpose&amp;pg=PA194#v=onepage&amp;q=Viola%20Spolin%20purpose&amp;f=false|date=2006|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|isbn=978-0472068876}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spolin's son, [[Paul Sills]] popularized improvisational theatre as a theatrical art form when he founded. as its first director, [[the Second City]] in [[Chicago]].

==Theories==
{{Main article|Dramatic theory}}
[[File:Kirmestheater1.JPG|thumb|Village feast with theatre performance circa 1600.]]
Having been an important part of human culture for more than 2,500 years, theatre has evolved a wide range of different [[Dramatic theory|theories]] and practices. Some are related to political or spiritual ideologies, while others are based purely on "artistic" concerns. Some processes focus on a story, some on theatre as event, and some on theatre as catalyst for social change. The [[Ancient Greek philosophy|classical Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]], in his seminal treatise, ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE) is the earliest-surviving example and its arguments have influenced theories of theatre ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Dukore (1974, 31) and Janko (1987, ix).&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he offers an account of what he calls "poetry" (a term which in Greek literally means "making" and in this context includes [[drama]]—[[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], [[tragedy]], and the [[satyr play]]—as well as [[lyric poetry]], [[epic poetry]], and the [[dithyramb]]). He examines its "first principles" and identifies its [[genre]]s and basic elements; his analysis of [[tragedy]] constitutes the core of the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Poetics'' 1447a13 (1987, 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle argues that tragedy consists of six qualitative parts, which are (in order of importance) ''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]'' or "plot", ''[[ethos]]'' or "character", ''[[dianoia]]'' or "thought", ''[[Lexis (Aristotle)|lexis]]'' or "diction", ''[[Melos (Aristotle)|melos]]'' or "song", and ''[[opsis]]'' or "spectacle".&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 19) and Janko (1987, xx, 7–10).&lt;/ref&gt; "Although Aristotle's ''Poetics'' is universally acknowledged in the [[Western culture|Western]] critical tradition", [[Marvin Carlson]] explains, "almost every detail about his seminal work has aroused divergent opinions."&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 16).&lt;/ref&gt; Important [[theatre practitioner]]s of the [[Twentieth-century theatre|20th century]] include [[Konstantin Stanislavski]], [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]], [[Jacques Copeau]], [[Edward Gordon Craig]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Joan Littlewood]], [[Peter Brook]], [[Jerzy Grotowski]], [[Augusto Boal]], [[Eugenio Barba]], [[Dario Fo]], [[Viola Spolin]], [[Keith Johnstone]] and [[Robert Wilson (director)]].

Stanislavski treated the theatre as an [[The arts|art-form]] that is [[Medium specificity|autonomous]] from [[literature]] and one in which the [[playwright]]'s contribution should be respected as that of only one of an ensemble of creative artists.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999a, 124, 202) and (2008b, 6), Carnicke (1998, 162), and Gauss (1999, 2). In 1902, Stanislavski wrote that "the author writes on paper. The actor writes with his body on the stage" and that the "score of an opera is not the opera itself and the script of a play is not drama until both are made flesh and blood on stage"; quoted by Benedetti (1999a, 124).&lt;/ref&gt; His innovative contribution to modern acting theory has remained at the core of mainstream [[Western culture|western]] performance training for much of the last century.&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 1032), Carnicke (1998, 1), Counsell (1996, 24–25), Gordon (2006, 37–40), and Leach (2004, 29).&lt;/ref&gt; That many of the precepts of his [[Stanislavski's system|system of actor training]] seem to be common sense and self-evident testifies to its hegemonic success.&lt;ref name="Counsell 1996, 25"&gt;Counsell (1996, 25).&lt;/ref&gt; Actors frequently employ his basic concepts without knowing they do so.&lt;ref name="Counsell 1996, 25"/&gt; Thanks to its promotion and elaboration by acting teachers who were former students and the many translations of his theoretical writings, Stanislavski's 'system' acquired an unprecedented ability to cross cultural boundaries and developed an international reach, dominating debates about acting in Europe and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 1032), Carnicke (1998, 1, 167), Counsell (1996, 24), and Milling and Ley (2001, 1).&lt;/ref&gt; Many actors routinely equate his 'system' with the North American [[Method acting|Method]], although the latter's exclusively psychological techniques contrast sharply with Stanislavski's multivariant, holistic and [[Psychophysiology|psychophysical]] approach, which explores character and action both from the 'inside out' and the 'outside in' and treats the actor's mind and body as parts of a continuum.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (2005, 147–148) and Carnicke (1998, 1, 8).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical aspects==
[[File:Vienna - Vienna Opera Backstage - 9729.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A theatre stage building]]
{{Main article|Stagecraft}}
Theatre presupposes [[Collaboration|collaborative]] modes of production and a [[collective]] form of reception. The [[Dramatic structure|structure of dramatic texts]], unlike other forms of [[literature]], is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception.&lt;ref name="Pfister 1977, 11"/&gt; The production of [[Play (theatre)|plays]] usually involves contributions from a [[playwright]], [[theatre director|director]], a [[Cast member|cast]] of [[actor]]s, and a technical [[production team]] that includes a [[set designer|scenic or set designer]], [[lighting designer]], [[costume designer]], [[sound design]]er, [[Stage management|stage manager]], [[production manager]] and technical director. Depending on the production, this team may also include a [[composer]], [[Dramaturge|dramaturg]], [[video design]]er or [[fight director]].

Stagecraft is a generic term referring to the technical aspects of theatrical, film, and video production. It includes, but is not limited to, constructing and rigging scenery, hanging and focusing of lighting, design and procurement of costumes, makeup, procurement of props, stage management, and recording and mixing of sound. Stagecraft is distinct from the wider umbrella term of scenography. Considered a technical rather than an artistic field, it relates primarily to the practical implementation of a designer's artistic vision.

In its most basic form, stagecraft is managed by a single person (often the stage manager of a smaller production) who arranges all scenery, costumes, lighting, and sound, and organizes the cast. At a more professional level, for example in modern Broadway houses, stagecraft is managed by hundreds of skilled carpenters, painters, electricians, stagehands, stitchers, wigmakers, and the like. This modern form of stagecraft is highly technical and specialized: it comprises many sub-disciplines and a vast trove of history and tradition. The majority of stagecraft lies between these two extremes. Regional theatres and larger community theatres will generally have a technical director and a complement of designers, each of whom has a direct hand in their respective designs.

==Sub-categories and organization==
There are many modern theatre movements which go about producing theatre in a variety of ways. Theatrical enterprises vary enormously in sophistication and purpose. People who are involved vary from novices and hobbyists (in community theatre) to professionals (in Broadway and similar productions). Theatre can be performed with a shoestring budget or on a grand scale with multimillion-dollar budgets. This diversity manifests in the abundance of theatre sub-categories, which include:
* [[Broadway theatre]] and [[West End theatre]]
* [[Community theatre]]
* [[Dinner theater]]
* [[Fringe theatre]]
* [[Off-Broadway]] and [[Off West End]]
* [[Off-Off-Broadway]]
* [[Regional theater in the United States|Regional theatre in the United States]]
* [[Summer stock theatre]]

===Repertory companies===
[[File:Cruikshank Pierce' Egan's Real Life - Drury Lane Theatre 1821.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], London, circa 1821]]
While most modern theatre companies rehearse one piece of theatre at a time, perform that piece for a set "run", retire the piece, and begin rehearsing a new show, [[repertory]] companies rehearse multiple shows at one time. These companies are able to perform these various pieces upon request and often perform works for years before retiring them. Most dance companies operate on this repertory system. The [[Royal National Theatre]] in London performs on a repertory system.

Repertory theatre generally involves a group of similarly accomplished actors, and relies more on the reputation of the group than on an individual star actor. It also typically relies less on strict control by a director and less on adherence to theatrical conventions, since actors who have worked together in multiple productions can respond to each other without relying as much on convention or external direction.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson (1982.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Producing vs. presenting===
In order to put on a piece of theatre, both a theatre company and a [[theatre (structure)|theatre venue]] are needed. When a theatre company is the sole company in residence at a theatre venue, this theatre (and its corresponding theatre company) are called a resident theatre or a producing theatre, because the venue produces its own work. Other theatre companies, as well as dance companies, who do not have their own theatre venue, perform at rental theatres or at presenting theatres. Both rental and presenting theatres have no full-time resident companies. They do, however, sometimes have one or more part-time resident companies, in addition to other independent partner companies who arrange to use the space when available. A rental theatre allows the independent companies to seek out the space, while a presenting theatre seeks out the independent companies to support their work by presenting them on their stage.

Some performance groups perform in non-theatrical spaces. Such performances can take place outside or inside, in a non-traditional performance space, and include [[street theatre]], and [[site-specific theatre]]. Non-traditional venues can be used to create more immersive or meaningful environments for audiences. They can sometimes be modified more heavily than traditional theatre venues, or can accommodate different kinds of equipment, lighting and sets.&lt;ref&gt;Alice T. Carter, "[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_575857.html Non-traditional venues can inspire art, or just great performances] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903150133/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_575857.html |date=2010-09-03 }}", ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'', 2008-07-07. Retrieved 2011-02-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[touring theatre|touring company]] is an independent theatre or dance company that travels, often internationally, being presented at a different theatre in each city.

===Unions===
There are many theatre unions including: [[Actors' Equity Association]] (for actors and stage managers), the [[Stage Directors and Choreographers Society]] (SDC), and the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] (IATSE, for designers and technicians). Many theatres require that their staff be members of these organizations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3845">The '''two headed alligator''' is a [[Fearsome critters|folkloric animal]] of the [[United States|American]] state of [[Florida]]. Its history is focused mainly within the neighborhood of [[Seminole Heights]] in the city of [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], where it appears on the official seal. It is also the subject of art murals, statues, flags, tee-shirts and other ephemera related to the neighborhood.

== Origins ==
[[File:Advertisement for North Tampa Pan-Am Garage Seminole Heights history Florida Ave.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for North Tampa Pan-Am Garage Seminole Heights history Florida Ave]]
The earliest recorded reference to the two headed alligator was in 1911 when real estate developer, T. Roy Young and his Seminole Development Company purchased 40 acres of land and developed Seminole Heights, Tampa's first suburb. In the promotion of the real estate venture, Young adopted an image of a two headed alligator as part of a neighborhood seal.

A folktale entitled, ''Bite or Smite'', was recorded by R. Perez and A.L. Lopez in 1930 during their research on local superstitions for the [[Federal Writers' Project|Federal Writers’ Project]] of the [[Works Progress Administration|Work Projects Administration]] for the State of Florida. Like many folktales from the region, its characters consist of an anthropomorphic rabbit, alligator and turtle. In the story, the rabbit ignores the warning of the turtle and is eaten by the alligator, who had been concealing a second head. Since it is difficult to date the creation of folklore, it is unclear whether Bite or Smite was the inspiration for, or inspired by, the Seminole Heights seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://patch.com/florida/seminoleheights/two-headed-alligator-statue-turning-heads-seminole-heights|title=Two-Headed Alligator (Statue) Turning Heads in Seminole Heights|newspaper=Seminole Heights, FL Patch|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2014 Sighting ==
In 2014, a man claiming to be a "local naturalist" sent an image of a two-headed alligator he spotted at a Seminole Heights park to the local newspaper, [[Tampa Bay Times]], who ran the image on the cover of the follow day's publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2014/07/01/Two-headed-alligator-spotted-in-Florida/5141404226010/|title=Two-headed alligator spotted in Florida?|newspaper=UPI|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the story became an international headline, scientists started to question the authenticity of the creature. The story was later discovered to be a hoax.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/its-a-total-crock/2186639|title= That photo of a two-headed Seminole Heights alligator? It's a total crock!}}&lt;/ref&gt;A local restaurant, [[Ella's Folkart Cafe]], displays a taxidermied two headed alligator that it claims was caught by local trappers soon after the news story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/46112|title=Tampa, FL - Famous Two-Headed Alligator|website=RoadsideAmerica.com|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statue ==
In 2016 a Seminole Heights community art fund, [[Urban Art Attack]], funded the building of a 6-foot two headed alligator statue in front of Southern Brewing and Winemaking at 4500 Nebraska Ave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://patch.com/florida/seminoleheights/two-headed-alligator-statue-turning-heads-seminole-heights|title=Two-Headed Alligator (Statue) Turning Heads in Seminole Heights|newspaper=Seminole Heights, FL Patch|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
''Upadesasahasri'' is divided into two parts – one is in metric verse and another is in prose. There are nineteen chapters (''prakarana'') in the verse (or Metrical Part (''Padyabandha''). The manuscript of this work indicates that the two parts (prose and verse) were regarded as independent works and studied or commented upon separately. Manuscript also suggests the possibility that any single chapter could be studied differently – apart from the rest. This means one could/can start reading this work anywhere.&lt;ref name="ŚaṅkarācāryaMayeda1979" /&gt;

The text states in verse 1.1 that it is a description of the "method and means" of Self-knowledge and [[moksha]].&lt;ref name="ŚaṅkarācāryaMayeda1979"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S Jagadananda (Translator, 1949), Upadeshasahasri, Vedanta Press, {{ISBN|978-8171200597}}, page 1 verse 1; {{oclc|218363449}}; Sanskrit: अथ '''मोक्ष'''साधनोपदेशविधिं व्याख्यास्यामो मुमुक्षूणां श्रद्दधानानामर्थिनामर्थाय ॥ १॥ ([http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_shankara/US_itran_new.html?lang=sa Source])&lt;/ref&gt;

===On teacher===
In Chapter 1, it states that teacher is the pilot as the student walks in the journey of knowledge, he is the raft as the student rows. The text describes the need, role and characteristics of a teacher,&lt;ref name=mayeda92/&gt; as follows,

{{Quote|
The teacher is one who is endowed with the power of furnishing arguments pro and con, of understanding questions [of the student], and remembers them. The teacher possesses tranquility, self-control, compassion and a desire to help others, who is versed in the Śruti texts ([[Vedas]], [[Upanishads]]), and unattached to pleasures here and hereafter, knows the subject and established in that knowledge. He is never a transgressor of the rules of conduct, devoid of weaknesses such as ostentation, pride, deceit, cunning, jugglery, jealousy, falsehood, egotism and attachment. The teacher's sole aim is to help others and a desire to impart the knowledge.
|Adi Shankara, Upadesha Sahasri 1.6&lt;ref&gt;S Jagadananda (Translator, 1949), Upadeshasahasri, Vedanta Press, {{ISBN|978-8171200597}}, page 5; {{oclc|218363449}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|
When the teacher find from signs that knowledge has not been grasped or has been wrongly grasped by the student, he should remove the causes of non-comprehension in the student. This includes the student's past and present knowledge, want of previous knowledge of what constitutes subjects of discrimination and rules of reasoning, behavior such as unrestrained conduct and speech, courting popularity, vanity of his parentage, ethical flaws that are means contrary to those causes. The teacher must enjoin means in the student that are enjoined by the [[Śruti]] and [[Smriti|Smrti]], such as avoidance of anger, [[Yamas]] consisting of [[Ahimsa]] and others, also the rules of conduct that are not inconsistent with knowledge. He [teacher] should also thoroughly impress upon the student qualities like humility, which are the means to knowledge.

===On Smriti and Self===
Adi Shankara states in prose paragraph 1.24 that, "Smriti texts elucidate the same truth [as Sruti], that is all gods are the Self, know the individual Self to be myself, the same in all beings".&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit:[http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_shankara/upadeshasaahasrii1.pdf Upadesha sahasri]&lt;br /&gt;English Translation: S Jagadananda (Translator, 1949), Upadeshasahasri, Vedanta Press, {{ISBN|978-8171200597}}, page 16; {{oclc|218363449}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the metric verse part of the text (''prakarana''), chapters 17 and 18 similarly state for example,

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
आत्मलाभात् परो नायो लाभः कश्चन विद्यते &lt;nowiki&gt;।
यदर्था वेदवादाश्च स्मार्ताश्चापि तु याः किर्याः ॥&lt;/nowiki&gt;
There is no attainment higher than the attainment of the ''Atman'' (Self).
For that is the purpose for which the teachings of the ''Vedas'', the ''Smritis'' and the ''Kriya'' (rites and ritual actions) are there.
&lt;/poem&gt;

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
स्वसंवेद्यत्वपर्यायः '''स्वप्रमाणक''' इष्यताम् &lt;nowiki&gt;। 
निवृत्तावह्मः सिद्धः स्वात्मनोऽनुभवश्च नः ॥&lt;/nowiki&gt;
Therefore accept the Self as '''self-evident''', which means the same thing as self-knowable.
The knowledge of the Innermost Self according to us thus becomes possible when the ego&lt;ref&gt;contextually, this is described in preceding verses as the "doctrine of difference"; that is, when a person sees his own Self, Soul, Atman as different from the Self, Soul, Atman of any other person&lt;/ref&gt; vanishes.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Adi Shankara, Upadesha Sahasri 2.18.203&lt;ref&gt;S Jagadananda (Translator, 1949), Upadeshasahasri, Vedanta Press, {{ISBN|978-8171200597}}, page 278; {{oclc|218363449}}; '''Note''': some manuscripts have slightly different numbering, and some different chapter sequencing; this verse appears as 2.18.200 or 1.18.203 in some manuscripts.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===On ritual idol worship===
Adi Shankara, in verse 1.25 to 1.26, discourages ritual worship and oblations to ''Deva'' (God), because that assumes the Self within is different than Brahman. The "doctrine of difference" is wrong, asserts Shankara, because, "he who knows the Brahman is one and he is another, does not know Brahman".&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit:[http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_shankara/upadeshasaahasrii1.pdf Upadesha sahasri]&lt;br /&gt;English Translation: S Jagadananda (Translator, 1949), Upadeshasahasri, Vedanta Press, {{ISBN|978-8171200597}}, page 16-17; {{oclc|218363449}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, prior to this declaration, Shankara asserts that the Self-knowledge is understood and realized when one's mind is purified by observation of [[Yamas]] (ethical precepts) such Ahimsa (non-injury, non-violence to others in body, mind and thoughts). Rituals and rites such as [[yajna]] (a fire ritual) can help draw and prepare the mind for the journey to Self-knowledge.&lt;ref name=mayeda92&gt;{{cite book|author1=Śaṅkarācārya|author2=Sengaku Mayeda|title=A Thousand Teachings: The Upadeśasāhasrī of Śaṅkara|year=2006|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-8120827714|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On discrimination between people and living beings===
In verses 1.26-1.28, Upadesasahasri states that any ''Bheda'' (discrimination) based on class or caste or parentage is a mark of inner error and lack of liberating knowledge.&lt;ref name=upadesasahasri29&gt;Sanskrit:[http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_shankara/upadeshasaahasrii1.pdf Upadesha sahasri]&lt;br /&gt;English Translation: S Jagadananda (Translator, 1949), Upadeshasahasri, Vedanta Press, {{ISBN|978-8171200597}}, page 17-19; {{oclc|218363449}}&lt;/ref&gt; In verse 1.29, Shankara states the ''Sruti'' text explain all creatures here, whether a tiger or another, are part of One, that one becomes a Brahman when one fully realizes the knowledge of non-difference. Anyone who refers to "classes or orders of life", or treats himself as different from any other creature, lacks that knowledge of "one's identity with supreme self", states verse 1.30.&lt;ref name=upadesasahasri29/&gt;

{{Quote|
One, who is eager to realize this right knowledge spoken of in the Sruti, should rise above the desire for a son, for wealth, for this world and the next, which are described in a five-fold&lt;ref&gt;See [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] chapter 1.4&lt;/ref&gt; manner, and are the outcome of a false reference to the Self of Varna (castes, colors, classes) and orders of life. These references are contradictory to right knowledge, and reasons are given by the Srutis regarding the prohibition of the acceptance of difference. For when the knowledge that the one non-dual Atman (Self) is beyond phenomenal existence is generated by the scriptures and reasoning, there cannot exist a knowledge side by side that is contradictory or contrary to it.
|Adi Shankara, Upadesha Sahasri 1.44&lt;ref&gt;'''English Translation''': S Jagadananda (Translator, 1949), Upadeshasahasri, Vedanta Press, {{ISBN|978-8171200597}}, page 32; {{oclc|218363449}};&lt;br /&gt;'''Sanskrit''': तच् चैतत् परमार्थदर्शनं प्रतिपत्तुमिच्छता वर्णाश्रमाद्यभिमान-कृतपाञ्क्तरूपपुत्रवित्तलोकैषणादिभ्यो व्युत्थानं कर्तव्यम् । सम्यक्प्रत्ययविरोधात् तदभिमानस्य भेददर्शनप्रतिषेधार्थोपपत्तिश्चोपपद्यते । न ह्येकस्मिन्नात्मन्यसंसारित्वबुद्धौ शास्त्रन्यायोत्पादितायां तद्विपरीता बुद्धिर्भवति । न ह्य् अग्नौ शितत्वबुद्धिः, शरीरे वाजरामरणबुद्धिः । तस्मादविद्याकार्यत्वात् सर्वकर्मणां तत्साधनानां च यज्ञोपवीतादीनां परमार्थदर्शनिष्टेन त्यागः कर्तव्यः ॥ ४४॥ [http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_shankara/upadeshasaahasrii1.pdf Upadesha sahasri]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===On education as discovery between teacher and student===
{{Quote|
Disciple asked, "Sir, is the mutual superimposition of the body and the Self made by the combination of the body or by the Self?"&lt;br /&gt;
The teacher said, "Does it matter if it be made by the one or the other?"
|Adi Shankara, Upadesha Sahasri 2.62 - 2.63&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit: [http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_shankara/upadeshasaahasrii1.pdf Upadesha sahasri];&lt;br /&gt;English Translation: S Jagadananda (Translator, 1949), Upadeshasahasri, Vedanta Press, {{ISBN|978-8171200597}}, prose section, page 43; {{oclc|218363449}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===On mind===
Adi Shankara writes, in verse 2.14.40 of ''Upadeshasahasri'', that "the mind is a place of pilgrimage where the gods, all knowledge [Vedas] and all other purifying agencies become one; a bath in that place of pilgrimage makes one immortal".&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit: [http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_shankara/upadeshasaahasrii1.pdf Upadesha sahasri];&lt;br /&gt;English Translation: S Jagadananda (Translator, 1949), Upadeshasahasri, Vedanta Press, {{ISBN|978-8171200597}}, page 147; {{oclc|218363449}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mayeda21440&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sengaku Mayeda (Translator)|title=A Thousand Teachings: The Upadeśasāhasrī of Śaṅkara|year=2006|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=8120827716 |page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1136">'''Videogrammetry''' is a measurement technology in which the three-dimensional coordinates of points on an object are determined by measurements made in two or more [[video]] images taken from different angles. Images can be obtained from two cameras which simultaneously view the object or from successive images captured by the same camera with a view of the object. Videogrammetry is typically used in [[manufacturing]].
