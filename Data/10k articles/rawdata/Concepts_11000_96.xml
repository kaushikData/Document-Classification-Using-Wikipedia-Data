'''Aish HaTorah''' ({{lang-he-n|אש התורה}}, ''Esh HaTorah'', "Fire of the Torah") is a [[Orthodox Judaism|Jewish Orthodox]] organization and [[yeshiva]].

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}

==History==

Aish HaTorah was established in Jerusalem by Rabbi [[Noah Weinberg]] in 1974, after he left the [[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem|Ohr Somayach yeshiva]], which he had previously co-founded. The organization worked to engage young Jews in discussion and study about the relevance of their heritage. It later expanded worldwide, and continues promotes its extensive adult education classes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forward.com/opinion/348004/is-new-israeli-initiative-trying-to-turn-american-jews-into-orthodox-right/|title=Is Israel Trying To Turn American Jews Into Orthodox Right-Wingers?|last=Goldberg|first=J.J.|date=2016-08-16|website=The Forward|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Aish HaTorah describes itself as blending the traditions of the [[Litvishe|Lithuanian]] [[yeshiva]]s with the doctrines of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Weinberg himself was a product of Lithuanian schools but he was also a grandson of the [[Slonim (Hasidic dynasty)|Slonimer]] [[Rebbe#Hasidic Rebbe|Rebbe]]. His teachings reflect influences of both schools as well as certain facets of the [[Kabbalah]] of Rabbi [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], the [[Vilna Gaon]] and others.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Aish HaTorah describes itself as pro-Israel and encourages Jewish people to visit Israel and connect to the land and its history. The organization's stated mission is "providing opportunities for Jews of all backgrounds to discover their heritage."

===Name===

The name Aish HaTorah, literally "Fire [of] the Torah", was inspired by the [[Talmud]]ic story of [[Rabbi Akiva]], the once illiterate 40-year-old shepherd who subsequently became the most famous sage of the [[Mishnah]]. [[Elie Wiesel]] said, "Aish HaTorah means to me the passion of teaching, the passion of learning. The study of Torah, the source of Jewish values, is the way to Jewish survival."

==Programs==

Aish HaTorah operates about 35 full-time branches on five continents, providing seminars, singles events, executive learning groups, [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holiday]] programs, and community building.

In Jerusalem, the Aish HaTorah yeshiva offers both beginners' drop-in classes and full-time, intensive study programs for Jewish men and women of all backgrounds and levels of knowledge. It has a high-tech main campus and outreach center that features a rooftop vista overlooking the [[Temple Mount]], and the [[Kirk Douglas]] Theatre, which houses a dramatic film presentation of the Jewish contribution to humanity. An "Explorium" of Jewish History is scheduled to open in 2013, designed to accommodate 300,000 visitors annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simmons|first=Shraga|title=Premier Educational Programs Amidst an Architectural Marvel|url=http://www.aish.com/ci/s/78061807.html|work=News article|publisher=Aish.com|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aish HaTorah runs the Discovery Seminar. The four-hour seminar reviews [[Jewish history]], [[Jewish philosophy]], and Jewish philosophy questions.

===Films===
In 2005 Aish HaTorah produced a documentary film, ''Inspired'' which chronicles the lives of selected [[baal teshuva|baalei teshuvah]] ("returnees to Jewish observance"). Aish HaTorah believes that the high rate of [[Interreligious marriage#Judaism|intermarriage]] between Jews and non-Jews has diluted the Jewish people’s vitality. ''Inspired'' was produced to encourage more [[Orthodox Judaism|observant Jews]] to share their positive Jewish religious experiences of Jewish life with non-observant Jews, as a way to strengthen the baal teshuva movement and revitalize Jewish life.

In 2007 Aish released a sequel, ''Inspired Too''. These films paved the way for Project Inspire, the grassroots organization that helps inspire Orthodox Jews to reach out to non-affiliated Jews to teach them about their heritage. Once an offshoot of Aish HaTorah, Project Inspire is now an independent organization under the umbrella of Aish Global.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inspire Yourself to Inspire Others|url=http://www.projectinspire.com/about.php|website=Project Inspire|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[Clarion Project]], an organization that shares staff, fundraising sources and an address with Aish HaTorah, and has been linked in media reports with Aish HaTorah,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/nyregion/in-police-training-a-dark-film-on-us-muslims.html|title=In Police Training, a Dark Film on U.S. Muslims|last=Powell|first=Michael|date=2012-01-23|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/senders-of-islam-movie-obsession-tied-to-jewish-charity/827910|title=Senders of Islam movie 'Obsession' tied to Jewish charity|last=Laughlin|first=Meg|date=2008-09-26|website=Tampa Bay Times|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910042700/http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/senders-of-islam-movie-obsession-tied-to-jewish-charity/827910|archive-date=2016-09-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; distributed its film called "Obsession." The film had been criticized for being unfair in its portrayal of Muslims as violent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The film was sent to more than 28 million people in the [[United States]] in anticipation of the [[United States presidential election, 2008|United States presidential election]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2008/10/the-jewish-extremists-behind-quot-obsession-quot/9006/|title=The Jewish Extremists Behind "Obsession"|last=Goldberg|first=Jeffrey|date=|website=The Atlantic|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Aish HaTorah denied any connection to the film.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The [[Council on American–Islamic Relations]] filed a complaint about the film with the [[Federal Election Commission]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 2012, the [[Clarion Project]] released a film called [[The Third Jihad: Radical Islam's Vision For America|The Third Jihad]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The film was produced by Raphael Shore, who works for Aish HaTorah.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forward.com/opinion/150677/islamophobic-film-and-its-jewish-backers/|title=Islamophobic Film and Its Jewish Backers|last=Goldberg|first=J.J.|date=|website=[[The Forward]]|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was called "Islamophobic" by [[The Forward]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Hasbara Fellowships===
{{Main article|Hasbara Fellowships}}
When the Israeli Foreign Ministry sought to combat anti-Israel ideas on college campuses, it worked with Aish HaTorah to develop the [[Hasbara Fellowships]]. This program has flown hundreds of student leaders to Israel for intensive training in pro-Israel activism training. In North America, Hasbara Fellowships guides and funds pro-Israel activities on over 100 college campuses.

===The Israel-Diaspora Initiative===
In August 2016, the Israeli government announced an Israel-[[Diaspora]] outreach program called The Israel-Diaspora Initiative. The program partners were announced as [[Chabad]] and Olami Worldwide, an organization that works closely with Aish.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.737097|title=Orthodox Groups to Lead Israel's New Bid to 'Strengthen Jewish Identity' of Diaspora Youth – Israel News – Haaretz|website=www.haaretz.com|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Ann Coulter HS Yearbook.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|Coulter as a senior in high school, 1980]]
Ann Hart Coulter was born on December 8, 1961, in New York City, to John Vincent Coulter (1926–2008), an FBI agent of Irish–German heritage,&lt;ref name=hufpost1&gt;Smolenyak, Megan. {{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/megan-smolenyak-smolenyak/ann-coulters-immigrant-an_b_8332212.html |title=Ann Coulter's Immigrant Ancestors |work=The Huffington Post |access-date=October 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was a native of [[Albany, New York]]; and Nell Husbands Coulter (née Martin; 1928–2009), a native of [[Paducah, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2008-01-09.html|title=Ann Coulter – January 9, 2008 – John Vincent Coulter|publisher=anncoulter.com}}&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.humanevents.com/2009/04/22/nell-husbands-martin-coulter/ "Nell Husbands Nartin CoulterLL"]. humanevents.com. April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Her family later moved to [[New Canaan, Connecticut]], where Coulter and her two older brothers, James and John, were raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holson|first1=Laura M.|title=Outflanked on Right, Coulter Seeks New Image|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/fashion/10coulter.html|website=nytimes.com|publisher=The New York Times|access-date=January 27, 2018|date=October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was brought up in a conservative household in Connecticut by Republican parents, with a father who idolized [[Joseph McCarthy]]. Coulter says that she has identified as a conservative since [[kindergarten]]. To prepare for arguments, she read books like ''[[The Conscience of a Conservative]]'' by [[Barry Goldwater]].&lt;ref name="broadly.vice.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/ann-coulter-is-a-human-being|title=Ann Coulter Is a Human Being|website=Broadly|language=en-US|access-date=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 14, Coulter visited her older brother in New York City, where he attended law school. While he was in class, he had his little sister read books by [[Milton Friedman]] and [[William E. Simon]]. When he got home from class, he quizzed Coulter. As a reward, he and his friends took her out to bars on the Upper East Side. Reading Republican books made Coulter dream about working as a writer.&lt;ref name="broadly.vice.com" /&gt; She graduated from [[New Canaan High School]] in 1980. Coulter's age was disputed in 2002, while she was arguing that she was not yet 40, yet ''[[The Washington Post]]'' columnist [[Lloyd Grove]] cited that she provided a birthdate of December 8, 1961, when registering to vote in [[New Canaan, Connecticut]], prior to the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 Presidential election]]. Meanwhile, a driver's license issued several years later purportedly listed her birthdate as December 8, 1963. Coulter will not confirm either date, citing privacy concerns.&lt;ref name="Grove_Lloyd"&gt;{{cite news|last=Grove|first=Lloyd|title=Mystery of the Ages|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=September 6, 2002|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2002/09/06/the-reliable-source/dc20d57b-0508-45e7-a7f1-7a93d293f840/|access-date=September 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coulter's career is highlighted by the publication of twelve books, as well as the weekly syndicated [[newspaper]] column that she publishes. She is particularly known for her polemical style,&lt;ref name="coulter_style"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1203281,00.html|title=What Would Ann Coulter Do?|last=Schmidt|first=Tracy Samantha|date=June 12, 2006|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and describes herself as someone who likes to "stir up the pot.

Coulter typically spends 6–12 weeks of the year on speaking engagement tours, and more when she has a book coming out.&lt;ref&gt;

===Books===
[[File:Ann Coulter2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Ann Coulter at the [[2004 Republican National Convention]]]]

Coulter is the author of twelve books, many of which have appeared on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]], with a combined 3 million copies sold {{as of|2009|May|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="depasquale"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/LisaDePasquale/2009/05/06/being_ann|title=Being Ann|last=De Pasquale|first=Lisa|date=May 6, 2009|publisher=[[Townhall.com]]|access-date=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coulter's first book, ''[[High Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Case Against Bill Clinton]]'', was published by [[Regnery Publishing]] in 1998 and made the New York Times Bestseller list.&lt;ref name="Howard Kurtz" /&gt; It details Coulter's case for the [[Clinton impeachment|impeachment]] of [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]].

Her second book, ''[[Slander: Liberal Lies About the American Right]]'', published by [[Crown Publishing Group|Crown Forum]] in 2002, reached the number one spot on ''The New York Times'' non-fiction best seller list.&lt;ref name="slander_bestseller"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/ann_coulter/index.html|title=Ann Coulter|date=March 10, 2009|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 21, 2009 | first=Ian | last=Austen}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Slander'', Coulter argues that President [[George W. Bush]] was given unfair negative media coverage. The factual accuracy of ''Slander'' was called into question by then-[[comedian]] and author, later Democratic [[U.S. Senator]] from [[Minnesota]], [[Al Franken]]; he also accused her of citing passages out of context.&lt;ref name="frankenbook"&gt;{{cite book|author = Franken, Al|title=Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right|publisher = Dutton Books|year = 2003|isbn = 0-525-94764-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others investigated these charges, and also raised questions about the book's accuracy and presentation of facts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spinsanity.org/columns/20020713.html "Throwing the book at her"], ''Spinsanity''.

In her third book, ''[[Treason: Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism]]'', also published by Crown Forum, she reexamines the 60-year history of the [[Cold War]]—including the career of [[Joseph McCarthy|Senator Joseph McCarthy]], the [[Whittaker Chambers]]-[[Alger Hiss]] affair, and [[Ronald Reagan]]'s challenge to [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to "[[tear down this wall]]"—and argues that liberals were wrong in their Cold War political analyses and policy decisions, and that McCarthy was correct about Soviet agents working for the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claremont.org/publications/crb/id.1200/article_detail.asp |title=Tailgunner Ann |author=William F.

She also argues that the correct identification of [[Annie Lee Moss]], among others, as [[communist]]s was misreported by the liberal media.&lt;ref&gt;

Crown Forum published a collection of Coulter's columns in 2004 as her fourth book, ''[[How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must)|How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must): The World According to Ann Coulter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

In it, she argues, first, that [[Liberalism in the United States|American liberalism]] rejects the idea of God and reviles people of faith, and second, that it bears all the attributes of a religion itself.&lt;ref&gt;

On June 7, 2011, [[Crown Publishing Group|Crown Forum]] published her eighth book ''[[Demonic: How the Liberal Mob Is Endangering America]]''. Coulter said she based this book heavily on the work of [[France|French]] [[social psychologist]] [[Gustave Le Bon]], who wrote on mass psychology, and in it she argues that liberals have mob-like characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;"Why liberals behave the way they do" by Ann Coulter, ''The Dailer Caller'', August 15, 2012, [http://dailycaller.com/2012/08/15/why-liberals-behave-the-way-they-do/ Retrieved 2012-08-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her ninth book, published September 25, 2012, is ''[[Mugged: Racial Demagoguery from the Seventies to Obama]]''. It argues that liberals, and Democrats in particular, have taken undue credit for racial civil rights in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ISBN =1595230998|title=Mugged: Racial Demagoguery from the Seventies to Obama|publisher= Sentinel|date=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Columns===
In the late 1990s, Coulter's weekly (biweekly from 1999–2000) [[Print syndication|syndicated]] column for [[Universal Press Syndicate]] began appearing. Her column is featured on six conservative websites: ''[[Human Events|Human Events Online]]'', [[WorldNetDaily]], [[Townhall.com]], [[VDARE]], ''[[FrontPage Magazine]]'', ''[[Jewish World Review]]'' and her own website. Her syndicator says, "Ann's client newspapers stick with her because she has a loyal fan base of conservative readers who look forward to reading her columns in their local newspapers".&lt;ref name="EP_mitchell-astor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.neilrogers.com/news/articles/2006061922.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714162642/http://www.neilrogers.com/news/articles/2006061922.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 14, 2011 |title=Newspaper Clients, and Syndicate, Stick With Coulter |date=June 16, 2006 |work=[[Editor &amp; Publisher]] |access-date=June 28, 2009 |author1=Astor, Dave |author2=Mitchell, Greg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Coulter worked as a regular [[columnist]] for ''[[George (magazine)|George]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="arm candy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tribute-to-john"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uexpress.com/anncoulter/index.html?uc_full_date=19990728|title=A Republican Tribute to John|last=Coulter|first=Ann|date=July 28, 1999|publisher=uexpress.com|access-date=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coulter also wrote exclusive weekly columns between 1998 and 2003 and with occasional columns thereafter for the conservative magazine ''[[Human Events]]''. In her columns for the magazine, she discusses judicial rulings, [[Constitution]]al issues, and legal matters affecting Congress and the [[executive branch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanevents.com/author/ann-coulter/|title=Ann Coulter's Articles |work=Human Events}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, as a contributing editor and syndicated columnist for ''[[National Review Online]]'' (NRO), Coulter was asked by editors to make changes to a piece written after the [[September 11 attacks]]. On the national television show ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'', Coulter accused ''NRO'' of [[censorship]] and said that she was paid $5 per article. NRO dropped her column and terminated her editorship. [[Jonah Goldberg]], editor-at-large of ''NRO'', said, "We did not 'fire' Ann for what she wrote... we ended the relationship because she behaved with a total lack of professionalism, friendship, and loyalty [concerning the editing disagreement]."&lt;ref name="goldbergjonah"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/220676/laffaire-coulter/jonah-goldberg |title=L'Affaire Coulter |last=Goldberg |first=Jonah |date=October 2, 2001 |work=[[National Review]] |access-date=November 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140901162828/http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/220676/laffaire-coulter/jonah-goldberg |archivedate=September 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coulter contracted with ''[[USA Today]]'' to cover the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]]. She wrote one article that began, "Here at the Spawn of [[Satan]] convention in [[Boston]]&amp;nbsp;..." and referred to some unspecified female attendees as "[[corn-fed (disambiguation)|corn-fed]], no make-up, natural fiber, no-bra needing, sandal-wearing, [[hirsutism|hirsute]], somewhat fragrant [[hippie]] chick pie wagons". The newspaper declined to print the article citing an editing dispute over "basic weaknesses in clarity and readability that we found unacceptable". An explanatory article by the paper went on to say "Coulter told the online edition of ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'' magazine that {{'}}''USA Today'' doesn't like my "tone", humor, sarcasm, etc., which raises the intriguing question of why they hired me to write for them.'" ''USA Today'' replaced Coulter with [[Jonah Goldberg]], and Coulter published it instead on her website.&lt;ref name="speakerscage"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=39644|title=Put the speakers in a cage|last=Coulter|first=Ann|date=July 26, 2004|work=[[World Net Daily]]|access-date=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatodaydrops"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/07/26/politics/main631949.shtml|title=USA Today Drops Ann Coulter|last=Collins|first=Dan|date=July 26, 2004|publisher=[[CBS News]]|access-date=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatodaydrops2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/2004-07-26-coulter-column_x.htm|title=Coulter column canceled after editing dispute|last=Memmott|first=Mark|date=July 26, 2004|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, the ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]'' dropped Coulter's syndicated column, citing reader complaints: "Many readers find her shrill, bombastic, and mean-spirited. And those are the words used by readers who identified themselves as conservatives".&lt;ref name="AZDailyStar"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.com/dailystar/opinion/90500.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050925074100/http://www.dailystar.com/dailystar/opinion/90500.php |archivedate=September 25, 2005 |title=Opinion pages get a makeover|last=Stoeffler|first=David|date=August 28, 2005|publisher=[[Arizona Daily Star]]|access-date=July 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006, some newspapers replaced Coulter's column with those of other conservative columnists following the publication of her fourth book, ''[[Godless: The Church of Liberalism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/news/another-newspaper-decides-to-drop-ann-coulter-s-column/|title=Another Newspaper Decides to Drop Ann Coulter's Column |website=editorandpublisher.com|access-date=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''[[The Augusta Chronicle]]'' dropped her column, newspaper editor Michael Ryan explained: "it came to the point where she was the issue rather than what she was writing about".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002878146 |title=Augusta Editor Explains Why He Dropped Coulter Column |date=July 24, 2006 |work=[[Editor &amp; Publisher]] |access-date=July 26, 2006 |author1=Astor, Dave |author2=Mitchell, Greg |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404200542/http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002878146 |archivedate=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan also stated that "pulling Ann Coulter's column hurts; she's one of the clearest thinkers around".

===Television and radio===
[[File:Ann Coulter 2012 Shankbone.JPG|right|thumb|upright|Ann Coulter at the 2012 Time 100]]
Coulter made her first national media appearance in 1996 after she was hired by the then-fledgling network [[MSNBC]] as a legal correspondent. She later appeared on [[CNN]] and [[Fox News]].&lt;ref name="msright"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1050304-1,00.html |title=Ms. Right |last=Cloud |first=John |date=April 17, 2005 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=June 28, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524145603/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1050304-1%2C00.html |archivedate=May 24, 2009 |deadurl=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coulter went on to make frequent guest appearances on many television and radio [[talk show]]s.

===Films===
Coulter appeared in three films released during 2004.

She then mocked "the message of Jesus... according to liberals", summarizing it as "something along the lines of 'be nice to people{{'"}}, which, in turn, she said "is, in fact, one of the incidental tenets of Christianity."&lt;ref name="Passion-of-the-Liberal"&gt;{{cite news|last=Coulter|first=Ann|title=The Passion of the Liberal|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/anncoulter/2004/03/04/the_passion_of_the_liberal|access-date=September 27, 2011|publisher=Townhall.com|date=March 4, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Hate crimes
Coulter opposes [[hate crime laws]], calling them "unconstitutional". She also stated that "Hate-crime provisions seem vaguely directed at capturing a sense of cold-bloodedness, but the law can do that without elevating some victims over others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter011000.asp|title=Ann Coulter|website=www.jewishworldreview.com|accessdate=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration ===
Coulter has criticized former president [[George W. Bush]]'s immigration proposals, saying they led to "amnesty". In a 2007 column, she claimed that the current immigration system was set up to deliberately reduce the percentage of whites in the population. In it, she said:&lt;ref name="roachmotel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/printer_friendly.cgi?article=188 |title=Bush's America: Roach Motel |last=Coulter |first=Ann |date=June 6, 2007 |publisher=anncoulter.com |access-date=April 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102051234/http://anncoulter.com/cgi-local/printer_friendly.cgi?article=188 |archivedate=January 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In 1960, whites were 90 percent of the country. The Census Bureau recently estimated that whites already account for less than two-thirds of the population and will be a minority by 2050. Other estimates put that day much sooner.

One may assume the new majority will not be such compassionate overlords as the white majority has been. If this sort of drastic change were legally imposed on any group other than white Americans, it would be called genocide. Yet whites are called racists merely for mentioning the fact that current immigration law is intentionally designed to reduce their percentage in the population.}}

Coulter strongly opposes the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2007-06-06.html|title=June 6, 2007 - BUSH'S AMERICA: ROACH MOTEL|website=www.anncoulter.com|accessdate=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding illegal immigration, she strongly opposed [[amnesty]] for [[undocumented immigration|undocumented immigrants]], and at the 2013 CPAC said she has now become "a single-issue voter against amnesty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ann Coulter Becomes a Single Issue Voter|url=http://barelyablog.com/ann-coulter-becomes-a-single-issue-voter/|access-date=January 31, 2013|publisher=barelyablog.com|date=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, during the controversy caused by the [[Trump administration family separation policy]], Coulter dismissed immigrant children as "child actors weeping and crying" and urged Trump not to "fall for it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Thomsen |first1=Jacqueline |title=Ann Coulter calls immigrant children 'child actors' |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/media/392774-ann-coulter-calls-immigrant-children-child-actors |publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |access-date=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;;LGBT conservatism

Since the 1990s, Coulter has had many acquaintances in the LGBT community. She considers herself "the [[Judy Garland]] of the Right". In the last few years,{{vague|date=August 2018}} she has attracted many LGBT fans, namely gay men and [[drag queen]]s.&lt;ref name="broadly.vice.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/queen-of-the-hill-the-worlds-best-hillary-impersonator-is-ready-for-2016|title=Queen of the Hill: The World's Best Hillary Impersonator Is Ready for 2016|website=Broadly|language=en-US|access-date=April 4, 2016}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/video/shooting-guns-with-ann-coulter|title=Shooting Guns With Ann Coulter|website=Broadly|language=en-US|access-date=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2007 [[Conservative Political Action Conference|CPAC]], Coulter said, "I do want to point out one thing that has been driving me crazy with the media—how they keep describing [[Mitt Romney]]'s position as being pro-gays, and that's going to upset the right wingers", and "Well, you know, screw you! I'm not anti-gay. We're against gay marriage. I don't want gays to be discriminated against." She added, "I don't know why all gays aren't Republican. I think we have the pro-gay positions, which is anti-crime and for tax cuts. Gays make a lot of money and they're victims of crime. No, they are! They should be with us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coulter under fire for anti-gay slur |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/04/coulter.edwards/|access-date=May 3, 2013|publisher=CNN|date= March 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Coulter's 2007 book ''[[If Democrats Had Any Brains, They'd Be Republicans]]'', in the chapter "Gays: No Gay Left Behind!", she argued that Republican policies were more pro-gay than Democratic policies. Coulter attended the 2010 HomoCon of [[GOProud]], where she commented that same-sex marriage "is not a civil right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ann Coulter Loves the Gays?

She did however describe the Texas branch of Log Cabin Republicans, for whom she's been signing books for years, as "{{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} real conservatives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2011-02-09.html|author=Ann Coulter |date= February 9, 2011 |title= Dear Mainstream Media Reporter Who Wasted My Time ...|website=anncoulter.com|access-date=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2011 [[Conservative Political Action Conference|CPAC]], during her question-and-answer segment, Coulter was asked about GOProud and the controversy over their inclusion at the 2011 CPAC. She boasted how she talked GOProud into dropping its support for same-sex marriage in the party's platform, saying, "The left is trying to co-opt gays, and I don't think we should let them. I think they should be on our side", and "Gays are natural conservatives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coulter Says 'Gays Are Natural Conservatives' – To Cheers From CPAC Crowd |url=http://www.metroweekly.com/poliglot/2011/02/coulter-says-gays-are-natural.html |access-date=January 31, 2013 |newspaper=[[Metro Weekly]] |date=February 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922134505/http://metroweekly.com/poliglot/2011/02/coulter-says-gays-are-natural.html |archivedate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, she joined advisory board for GOProud.

==Political activities and commentary==
{{update|date=March 2018}}
Ann Coulter has described herself as a "[[polemics|polemicist]]" who likes to "stir up the pot" and does not "pretend to be impartial or balanced, as broadcasters do".&lt;ref name="polemicist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/April06/coulter.pre.dea.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430010955/http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/April06/coulter.pre.dea.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 30, 2006 |title=Conservative pundit Ann Coulter '84 to speak May 7 |last=Aloi |first=Daniel |date=April 17, 2006 |publisher=[[Cornell University]] |access-date=September 27, 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While her political activities in the past have included advising a plaintiff suing President [[Bill Clinton]] as well as considering a run for Congress, she mostly serves as a political [[Pundit (expert)|pundit]], sometimes creating [[controversy]] ranging from rowdy uprisings at some of the colleges where she speaks to protracted discussions in the media. ''Time'' magazine's John Cloud once observed that Coulter "likes to shock reporters by wondering aloud whether America might be better off if women lost the right to vote".&lt;ref name="msright" /&gt; This was in reference to her statement that "it would be a much better country if women did not vote. That is simply a fact. In fact, in every presidential election since 1950—except [[Barry Goldwater|Goldwater]] in '64—the Republican would have won, if only the men had voted."&lt;ref name="appmagic" /&gt; Similarly, in an October 2007 interview with the ''[[New York Observer]]'', Coulter said:&lt;ref name="Gurley_George"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gurley|first=George|title=Coulter Culture|url=http://www.observer.com/2007/coulter-culture|access-date=September 27, 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Observer]]|date=October 2, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112214238/http://www.observer.com/2007/coulter-culture|archivedate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|If we took away women's right to vote, we'd never have to worry about another Democrat president. It's kind of a pipe dream, it's a personal fantasy of mine, but I don't think it's going to happen. And it is a good way of making the point that women are voting so stupidly, at least single women.

It also makes the point, it is kind of embarrassing, the Democratic Party ought to be hanging its head in shame, that it has so much difficulty getting men to vote for it. I mean, you do see it's the party of women and 'We'll pay for health care and tuition and day care—and here, what else can we give you, soccer moms?'}}
In addition to questioning whether women's right to vote is a good thing, Coulter has also appeared on Fox News and advocated for a poll tax and a literacy test for voters (this was in 1999, and she reiterated her support of a literacy test in 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plutocrats United: Campaign Money, the Supreme Court, and the Distortion of American Elections|last=Hasen|first=Richard L.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780300212457|location=New Haven, CT|page=66|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not a viewpoint widely shared by members of the Republican Party.

===Paula Jones – Bill Clinton case===
Coulter first became a public figure shortly before becoming an unpaid legal adviser for the attorneys representing [[Paula Jones]] in her [[sexual harassment]] suit against President Bill Clinton. Coulter's friend George Conway had been asked to assist Jones' attorneys, and shortly afterward Coulter, who wrote a column about the Paula Jones case for ''[[Human Events]]'', was also asked to help, and she began writing legal briefs for the case.

Coulter later stated that she would come to mistrust the motives of Jones' head lawyer, Joseph Cammaratta, who by August or September 1997 was advising Jones that her case was weak and to [[legal settlement|settle]], if a favorable settlement could be negotiated.&lt;ref name=Daley1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=conason /&gt; From the outset, Jones had sought an apology from Clinton at least as eagerly as she sought a settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Barak, Daphne. "[http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/1998/09/23/fhead.htm Jones would have been happy with an apology]". ''[[Irish Examiner]]''. September 23, 1998. Retrieved July 10, 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812211212/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/1998/09/23/fhead.htm |date=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a later interview Coulter recounted that she herself had believed that the case was strong, that Jones was telling the truth, that Clinton should be held publicly accountable for his misconduct, and that a settlement would give the impression that Jones was merely interested in [[extortion|extorting]] money from the President.&lt;ref name=Daley1999 /&gt;

David Daley, who wrote the interview piece for ''[[The Hartford Courant]]'' recounted what followed:

{{quote|Coulter played one particularly key role in keeping the Jones case alive. In ''Newsweek'' reporter Michael Isikoff's new book ''Uncovering Clinton: A Reporter's Story'', Coulter is unmasked as the one who leaked word of Clinton's "distinguishing characteristic"—his reportedly bent penis that Jones said she could recognize and describe—to the news media. Her hope was to foster mistrust between the Clinton and Jones camps and forestall a settlement ... I thought if I leaked the distinguishing characteristic it would show bad faith in negotiations. [Clinton lawyer] Bob Bennett would think Jones had leaked it. Cammaratta would know he himself hadn't leaked it and would get mad at Bennett. It might stall negotiations enough for me to get through to [Jones adviser] Susan Carpenter-McMillan to tell her that I thought settling would hurt Paula, that this would ruin her reputation, and that there were other lawyers working for her. Then 36 hours later, she returned my phone call. I just wanted to help Paula. I really think Paula Jones is a hero. I don't think I could have taken the abuse she came under. She's this poor little country girl and she has the most powerful man she's ever met hitting on her sexually, then denying it and smearing her as president. And she never did anything tacky. It's not like she was going on TV or trying to make a buck out of it."&lt;ref name=Daley1999 /&gt;}}

In his book, Isikoff also reported Coulter as saying: "We were terrified that Jones would settle. It was contrary to our purpose of bringing down the President."&lt;ref name=conason&gt;Conason, Joe; Lyons, Gene. "[http://archive.salon.com/news/feature/2000/03/04/willey/print.html Impeachment's little elves]". ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''. March 4, 2000.

{{quote|The only motive for leaking the distinguishing characteristic item that [Isikoff] gives in his book is my self-parodying remark that "it would humiliate the president" and that a settlement would foil our efforts to bring down the president ... I suppose you could take the position, as [Isikoff] does, that we were working for Jones because we thought Clinton was a lecherous, lying scumbag, but this argument gets a bit circular. You could also say that Juanita Broaddrick's secret motive in accusing Clinton of rape is that she hates Clinton because he raped her. The whole reason we didn't much like Clinton was that we could see he was the sort of man who would haul a low-level government employee like Paula to his hotel room, drop his pants, and say, "Kiss it." You know: Everything his defense said about him at the impeachment trial. It's not like we secretly disliked Clinton because of his administration's position on California's citrus cartels or something, and then set to work on some crazy scheme to destroy him using a pathological intern as our Mata Hari.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, Ann (May 1999). "Spikey and me". [[George (magazine)|''George''.]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The case went to court after Jones broke with Coulter and her original legal team, and it was dismissed via [[summary judgment]]. The judge ruled that even if her allegations proved true, Jones did not show that she had suffered any damages, stating, "... plaintiff has not demonstrated any tangible job detriment or adverse employment action for her refusal to submit to the governor's alleged advances. The president is therefore entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's claim of [[quid pro quo]] sexual harassment." The ruling was [[appeal]]ed by Jones' lawyers. During the pendency of the appeal, Clinton settled with Jones for $850,000 ($151,000 after legal fees) in November 1998, in exchange for Jones' dismissal of the appeal. By then, the Jones lawsuit had given way to the [[Lewinsky scandal|Monica Lewinsky sex scandal]].

In October 2000, Jones revealed that she would pose for nude pictures in an adult magazine, saying she wanted to use the money to pay taxes and support her grade-school-aged children, in particular saying, "I'm wanting to put them through college and maybe set up a college fund."&lt;ref name=larryking&gt;Jones, Paula.

Coulter wrote:

"Ann Coulter's use of this anti-gay slur is vile and unacceptable," said Neil G.

[[John McCain]], a Republican presidential candidate, called Coulter's comments "wildly inappropriate".&lt;ref name="CNN_edwards_faggot_comment" /&gt;

As the campaign waged on, she continued to insert her commentary regarding the candidates, both Democrats and Republicans. In a June 2007 interview, Coulter named [[Duncan Hunter]] as her choice for the 2008 Republican Presidential nomination, highlighting his views on immigration and specifically his anti-abortion credentials, saying "[t]his is a winning issue for us, protecting little babies".&lt;ref&gt;''Good Morning America'', ABC: [http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=3312795 What's Wrong With The Republicans?] June 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 16, 2008, Coulter began endorsing Governor [[Mitt Romney]] as her choice for the 2008 Republican nomination, saying he is "manifestly the best candidate" (contrasting Romney with Republican candidates [[John McCain]], [[Mike Huckabee]], and [[Rudy Giuliani]]).&lt;ref name="Coulter_endorses_Romney"&gt;{{cite news|last=Coulter |first=Ann |title=The Elephant in the Room |url=http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/article.cgi?article=230 |access-date=September 27, 2011 |publisher=AnnCoulter.com |date=January 16, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927112540/http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/article.cgi?article=230 |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Coulter was critical of eventual Republican nominee [[John McCain]]. On the January 31, 2008, broadcast of ''[[Hannity and Colmes]]'', Coulter claimed that if McCain won the Republican nomination for president, she would support and campaign for [[Hillary Clinton]], stating, "[Clinton] is more conservative than McCain."&lt;ref name="Parker_Jennifer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Parker |first=Jennifer |title=Coulter: I Will Vote for Hillary Over McCain |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2008/02/coulter-i-will/ |access-date=September 27, 2011 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=February 1, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110092504/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2008/02/coulter-i-will/ |archivedate=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding then-presidential-candidate [[Barack Obama]] in an April 2, 2008, column, she characterized his book ''[[Dreams from My Father]]'' as a "dimestore ''[[Mein Kampf]]''{{-"}}. Coulter writes, "He says the reason black people keep to themselves is that it's 'easier than spending all your time mad or trying to guess whatever it was that white folks were thinking about you.' Here's a little inside scoop about white people: We're not thinking about you. Especially [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASPs]].

===2010 Canadian university tour===
[[File:Ann Coulter by Gage Skidmore 4.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ann Coulter at [[Conservative Political Action Conference|CPAC]] in February 2012]]

In March 2010, Coulter announced that she would be embarking on a speaking tour of three Canadian universities, The [[University of Western Ontario]], the [[University of Ottawa]] and the [[University of Calgary]]. The tour was organized by the [[International Free Press Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/783585--watch-your-mouth-ann-coulter-warned-for-canadian-tour?bn=1 | location=Toronto | work=The Star | title=Watch your mouth, Ann Coulter warned for Canadian tour | first=Bruce | last=Cheadle | date=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eve of Coulter's first speech at the University of Western Ontario, an e-mail to Coulter from François Houle, provost of the University of Ottawa, was leaked to the media. The e-mail warned that "promoting hatred against any identifiable group would not only be considered inappropriate, but could in fact lead to criminal charges." Coulter released a public statement alleging that by sending her the e-mail, Houle was promoting hatred against conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsmax.com/InsideCover/coulter-canada-provost-hate/2010/03/23/id/353652 |title=Coulter: Canadian U Provost Guilty of Hate Crimes |publisher=Newsmax.com |date=March 23, 2010 |access-date=December 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her speech at the University of Western Ontario, she told a Muslim student to "take a [[camel]]", in response to the student's question about previous comments by Coulter that Muslims should not be allowed on airplanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawa.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20100324/OTT_Coulter_Rxn_100324/20100324/?hub=OttawaHome |title=Students divided over Coulter's cancelled speech |publisher=Ottawa.ctv.ca |access-date=December 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 22, the University of Ottawa made international news when liberal protesters conspired to prevent Coulter from speaking. The event was canceled in spite of a massive security presence; Alain Boucher of the [[Ottawa Police Service]] said there were ten officers visible at the scene, "plus other resources" nearby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/289589 Ottawa police say they didn't shut Coulter down]; March 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Boucher alleged that Coulter's security team decided to call off the event, saying, "We gave her options," including, he said, to "find a bigger venue." But "they opted to cancel ...

===Comments on Islam, Arabs, and terrorism===
On September 14, 2001, three days after the [[September 11 attacks]] (in which her friend [[Barbara Olson]] had been killed), Coulter wrote in her column:
{{quote|Airports scrupulously apply the same laughably ineffective airport harassment to Suzy Chapstick as to Muslim hijackers. It is preposterous to assume every passenger is a potential crazed homicidal maniac. We know who the homicidal maniacs are. They are the ones cheering and dancing right now. We should invade ''their'' countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity. We weren't punctilious about locating and punishing only Hitler and his top officers. We carpet-bombed German cities; we killed civilians. That's war. And this is war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/coulter/coulter091301.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010914225811/http://www.nationalreview.com/coulter/coulter091301.shtml |archivedate=September 14, 2001 |title=This Is War |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=September 14, 2001 |access-date=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This comment resulted in Coulter's being fired as a columnist by the ''National Review'', which she subsequently referred to as "squeamish girly-boys".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Rough sailing for the new darling on the racial right. (2002). ''The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education,'' (34), 44. Via ProQuest.&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to this comment, Ibrahim Hooper of the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] remarked in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' that before September 11, Coulter "would have faced swift repudiation from her colleagues", but "now it's accepted as legitimate commentary".&lt;ref&gt;Jim Ritter, "Muslims see a growing media bias", ''Chicago Sun-Times'', September 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

One day after the attacks (when death toll estimates were higher than later), Coulter asserted that only Muslims could have been behind the attacks:
{{quote|Not all Muslims may be terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims—at least all terrorists capable of assembling a murderous plot against America that leaves 7,000 people dead in under two hours.&lt;ref name="Future widows"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter092801.asp |author=Coulter, Ann |title= Future widows of America: Write your congressman |work=Jewish World Review |access-date=April 16, 2007 |date=September 28, 2001| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070416152942/http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter092801.asp| archivedate=April 16, 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Coulter was highly critical in 2002 of the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] and especially its then-secretary [[Norman Mineta]]. Her many criticisms include their refusal to use [[racial profiling]] as a component of airport screening.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, Ann. "[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter022802.asp Mineta's Bataan death march]", ''Jewish World Review''. February 28, 2002. Retrieved July 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; After a group of Muslims was expelled from a [[US Airways]] flight when other passengers expressed concern, sparking a call for Muslims to boycott the airline because of the [[Flying Imams controversy|ejection from a flight of six imams]], Coulter wrote:
{{quote|If only we could get Muslims to boycott all airlines, we could dispense with airport security altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/printer_friendly.cgi?article=158 |title=What can I do to make your flight more uncomfortable? |author=Coulter, Ann |date=November 22, 2006 |access-date=April 17, 2007 |publisher=AnnCoulter.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070326071242/http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/printer_friendly.cgi?article=158 |archivedate=March 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Coulter also cited the 2002 Senate testimony of FBI whistleblower [[Coleen Rowley]], who was acclaimed for condemning her superiors for refusing to authorize a [[search warrant]] for 9-11 conspirator [[Zacarias Moussaoui]] when he refused to consent to a search of his computer. They knew that he was a Muslim in flight school who had overstayed his visa, and the [[List of intelligence agencies of France|French Intelligence Service]] had confirmed his affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups. Coulter said she agreed that [[probable cause]] existed in the case, but that refusing consent, being in flight school and overstaying a visa should not constitute grounds for a search. Citing a poll which found that 98 percent of Muslims between the ages of 20 and 45 said they would not fight for Britain in the war in Afghanistan, and that 48 percent said they would fight for [[Osama bin Laden]] she asserted "any Muslim who has attended a mosque in Europe—certainly in England, where Moussaoui lived—has had 'affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups,'" so that she parsed Rowley's position as meaning that {{"'}}probable cause' existed to search Moussaoui's computer because he was a Muslim who had lived in England". Coulter says the poll was "by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''", actually it was by Sunrise, an "[[British Asian|Asian]]" (therefore an Indian subcontinent-oriented) radio station, canvassing the opinions of 500 Muslims in Greater London (not Britain as a whole), mainly of Pakistani origin and aged between 20 and 45. Because "FBI headquarters ... refused to engage in racial profiling", they failed to uncover the 9-11 plot, Coulter asserted. "The FBI allowed thousands of Americans to be slaughtered on the altar of [[political correctness]]. What more do liberals want?"&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, Ann.

Coulter wrote in another column that she had reviewed the [[civil rights]] lawsuits against certain airlines to determine which of them had subjected Arabs to the most "egregious discrimination" so that she could fly only that airline. She also said that the airline should be bragging instead of denying any of the charges of discrimination brought against them.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, Ann.

In a May 2007 article looking back at the life of then recently deceased evangelical Reverend [[Jerry Falwell]], Coulter commented on his (later retracted) statement after the 9/11 attacks that "the [[paganism|pagans]], and the [[abortion]]ists, and the [[feminist]]s, and the [[Homosexuality|gays]] and the [[lesbian]]s who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the [[ACLU]], [[People For the American Way]], all of them who have tried to secularize America ... helped this happen."

On October 22, 2012, following a presidential debate between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, Coulter published the following tweet from her official Twitter account: "I highly approve of Romney's decision to be kind and gentle to the retard", drawing stiff criticism for her use of a word which some find offensive to describe the president of the United States. The [[Special Olympics]] condemned Coulter in a tweet shortly after Coulter's.&lt;ref&gt;Grinberg, Emanuella.

After the election, in which [[Barack Obama]] won, Ann Coulter wrote a column titled "Romney Was Not the Problem". In it she argued against the idea that Mitt Romney lost because he failed to get his message across. She also said that Mitt Romney lost because he was running against an incumbent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2012-11-21.html|title=Ann Coulter: Romney Was Not the Problem|author=Ann Coulter|date=November 22, 2012|access-date=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 CPAC Conference===
In March 2013, Coulter was one of the keynote speakers at the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]], where she made references to New Jersey Governor [[Chris Christie]]'s weight ("CPAC had to cut back on its speakers this year about 300 pounds") and progressive activist [[Sandra Fluke]]'s hairdo. (Coulter quipped that Fluke didn't need birth control pills because "that haircut is birth control enough".) Coulter advocated against a path to citizenship for [[undocumented immigrants]] because such new citizens would never vote for Republican candidates: "If amnesty goes through, America becomes California and no Republican will ever win another election."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mediaite.com/tv/ann-coulter-blasts-chris-christie-says-hes-off-my-list-for-2016-in-fiery-cpac-speech/|title=Ann Coulter Blasts Chris Christie, Says He's 'Off My List' For 2016 In Fiery CPAC Speech|author=Garrett Quinn|date=March 16, 2013|website=Mediaite|access-date= May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffpost.130316"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://huff.to/16AsRy4|title=Ann Coulter CPAC: Pundit Tells Chris Christie Weight Joke, Calls Bill Clinton 'Forcible Rapist' |author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line. --&gt;|date=March 16, 2013|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 presidential election===
In the summer of 2015, Coulter appeared on ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'' and said that of all the declared Republican primary candidates, [[Donald Trump]] had the best chance of winning the general election, prompting the studio audience to laugh in disbelief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/05/04/flashback_june_2015_bill_maher__his_audience_laugh_at_ann_coulter_for_saying_trump_could_win.html/|title=Flashback June 2015: Bill Maher &amp; His Audience Laugh At Ann Coulter For Saying Trump Could Win Nomination|author=Tim Haines|date=May 4, 2016|website=[[RealClearPolitics]]|access-date= April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coulter later endorsed [[Donald Trump]] in the general election, which he went on to win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://time.com/4730511/trump-fans-react-missile-attack-syria/|title=Some of President Trump's Biggest Fans Aren't Happy About the Syria Strike|author=Kate Samuelson|date=April 7, 2017|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date= April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
=== Anti-semitism accusations ===
Coulter was accused of [[Antisemitism|anti-semitism]] in an October 8, 2007, interview with [[Donny Deutsch]] on ''[[The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch|The Big Idea]]''. During the interview, Coulter stated that the United States is a Christian nation, and said that she wants "Jews to be perfected, as they say" (referring to them being converted to Christianity).&lt;ref name="perfected_jews"&gt;{{cite news|title=Coulter: We Want Jews To Be "Perfected"|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/11/national/main3358373.shtml|access-date=September 27, 2011|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=February 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deutsch, a practicing Jew, implied that this was an anti-semitic remark, but Coulter said she didn't consider it to be a hateful comment.&lt;ref name="Perfected_Jews_FOX"&gt;{{cite news|title=Columnist Ann Coulter Shocks Cable TV Show, Declaring 'Jews Need to be Perfected by Becoming Christians'|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,301216,00.html|access-date=September 27, 2011|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=October 11, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007220454/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,301216,00.html|archivedate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deutsch_response"&gt;{{cite news|title=Coulter draws fire over remarks about Jews|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21257498/ns/business-cnbc_tv/t/coulter-draws-fire-over-remarks-about-jews/|access-date=September 27, 2011|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coulter's comments on the show were condemned by the [[Anti-Defamation League]], [[American Jewish Committee]] and [[Bradley Burston]],&lt;ref&gt;Burston, B.

Didn't need to hear applause lines about them all night."&lt;ref name=debate /&gt;

=== Plagiarism accusations ===
In October 2001, Coulter was accused of plagiarism in her 1998 book ''High Crimes and Misdemeanors'' by Michael Chapman, a columnist for the journal ''Human Events'' who claims that passages were taken from a supplement he wrote for the journal in 1997 titled "A Case for Impeachment".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

On the July 5, 2006, episode of ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]]'' on [[MSNBC]], guest John Barrie, the CEO of iParadigms, offered his professional opinion that Coulter plagiarized in her book ''Godless'' as well as in her columns over the previous year.&lt;ref name="Dietz"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dietz|first=Rob|url=https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2006/07/06/olbermann-hosted-plagiarism-expert-to-spell-out/136106|title=Olbermann hosted plagiarism expert to spell out allegations against Coulter|work=Media Matters for America|date=July 6, 2006|accessdate=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barrie ran "Godless" through iThenticate, his company's machine which is able to scan works and compare them to existing texts. He points to a 25 word section of the text that exactly matches a Planned Parenthood pamphlet and a 33 word section almost duplicating a 1999 article from the ''Portland Press'' as some examples of evidence.&lt;ref name="Dietz"/&gt;

[[Media Matters for America]] has appealed to Random House publishing to further investigate Coulter's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mediamatters.org/research/2006/07/07/media-matters-asks-random-house-to-investigate/136111|title=Media Matters asks Random House to investigate Coulter plagiarism allegations|date=October 10, 2007|newspaper=Media Matters for America|access-date=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The syndicator of her columns cleared her of the plagiarism charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2006-07-11-0607110267-story.html|title=Sorry, harpies--syndicator sees no Coulter plagiarism|last=Bowles|first=Cheryl|date=July 11, 2006|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Universal Press Syndicate and Crown Books also defended Coulter against the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2006/07/11/Syndicate-supports-Ann-Coulter/90741152652128/?sl=3|title=Syndicate supports Ann Coulter|last=|first=|date=July 11, 2006|work=United Press International|access-date=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Columnist Bill Nemitz from the ''[[Portland Press Herald]]'' accused Coulter of plagiarizing a very specific sentence from his newspaper in her book ''Godless'', but he also acknowledged that one sentence is insufficient grounds for filing suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lib.umich.edu/articles/details/FETCH-proquest_newspapers_2773031853|title=Wonder how Ann Coulter fills her books?|last=Nemitz|first=Bill|date=July 23, 2006|work=Portland Press Herald|access-date=November 29, 2016|via=lib.umich.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Annie Lee Wilkerson Cooper''' (June 2, 1910 – November 24, 2010) was an African-American [[civil rights activist]] in the 1965 [[Selma to Montgomery march|Selma Voting Rights Movement]] who is best known for punching [[Dallas County, Alabama]] Sheriff [[Jim Clark (sheriff)|Jim Clark]].

==Life and work==
Annie Lee Cooper was born on June 2, 1910 as Annie Lee Wilkerson in Selma, Alabama, one of ten children of Lucy Jones and Charles Wilkerson Sr. By the seventh grade, Cooper dropped out of school, and moved to [[Kentucky]] to live with an older sister.&lt;ref name="Cooper100"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20100602/NEWS02/6020357/Woman-known-run-sheriff-turns-100-today|title=Woman known for run-in with sheriff turns 100 today |work=[[Montgomery Advertiser]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=June 2, 2010|accessdate=November 7, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107203740/http://archive.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20100602/NEWS02/6020357/Woman-known-run-sheriff-turns-100-today|archivedate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Cooper returned to Selma to care for her elderly mother.&lt;ref name="Jet Magazine"&gt;{{cite news|title=none|last1=Britton|first1=John H.|work=Jet Magazine|date=February 11, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appalled by the fact that although she had been a registered voter in Pennsylvania and Ohio she was unable to register to vote in Alabama, Cooper began to participate in the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selmatimesjournal.com/2010/12/03/annie-l-cooper-huff-2/|title=Annie L. Cooper Huff Obituary|newspaper=[[Selma Times-Journal]]|date=December 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her attempt to register to vote in 1963 resulted in her being fired from her job as a nurse at a rest home.&lt;ref name="Jet Magazine"/&gt; She then worked as a clerk at the Torch Motel.

In January 1965, Cooper stood in line for hours outside the [[Dallas County Courthouse (Alabama)|Dallas County Courthouse]] to register to vote until Sheriff [[Jim Clark (sheriff)|Jim Clark]] ordered her to vacate the premises. Clark prodded Cooper in the neck with a [[billy club]] until Cooper turned around and hit the sheriff in the jaw, knocking him down. Deputies then wrestled Cooper to the ground as Clark continued to beat her repeatedly with his club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/06/AR2007060602455.html | title=Ala.

She spent the period of her incarceration singing spirituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=May|first1=Gary|title=Bending Toward Justice: The Voting Rights Act and the Transformation of American Democracy|date=2013|publisher=Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some in the sheriff's department wanted to charge her with attempted murder.&lt;ref name="Cooper death"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selmatimesjournal.com/2010/11/24/annie-lee-cooper-civil-rights-legend-dies/ |title=Annie Lee Cooper, civil rights legend, dies |publisher=''Selma Times-Journal'' |date=November 24, 2010 |accessdate=June 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this incident, Cooper became a registered voter in her home state.&lt;ref name="Cooper100" /&gt;

On June 2, 2010, Annie Lee Cooper became a [[centenarian]]. Reflecting on her longevity, she stated, "My mother lived to be 106, so maybe I can live that long, too."&lt;ref name="Cooper100" /&gt; She died on November 24, 2010, at the Vaughan Regional Medical Center in Selma, Alabama.&lt;ref name="Cooper death" /&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the 2014 film ''[[Selma (film)|Selma]]'', Cooper was portrayed by [[Oprah Winfrey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/oprah-winfrey-star-civil-rights-drama-selma-article-1.1825391 | title=Oprah Winfrey to play Annie Lee Cooper in civil rights drama 'Selma' | last=Rivera | first=Zayda | publisher=''[[New York Daily News]]'' | date=20 June 2014 | accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winfrey said that she took the role "because of the magnificence of Annie Lee Cooper and what her courage meant to an entire movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/609922/oprah-winfrey-opens-up-about-her-violent-scene-in-selma-watch-now|author= Marc Malkin|title=Oprah Winfrey Opens Up About Her Violent Scene in Selma|publisher=E!

The concept of an '''archetype''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|k|ɪ|t|aɪ|p}} appears in areas relating to [[behavior]], [[History of psychology#Emergence of German experimental psychology|modern psychological theory]], and [[literary analysis]]. An archetype can be:

# a statement, pattern of behavior, or [[Prototype theory|prototype]] (model) which other statements, patterns of behavior, and objects copy or emulate. (Frequently used informal synonyms for this usage include "standard example", "basic example", and the longer form "archetypal example". Mathematical archetypes often appear as "[[canonical (disambiguation)|canonical]] examples".)
# a [[Platonic philosophy|Platonic philosophical idea]] referring to pure [[Theory of Forms|forms]] which embody the fundamental characteristics of a thing in Platonism
# a collectively-inherited unconscious idea, pattern of thought, image, etc., that is universally present, in individual psyches, as in [[Jungian psychology]]
# a constantly recurring symbol or motif in literature, painting, or mythology (this usage of the term draws from both [[Cultural anthropology|comparative anthropology]] and from [[Jungian archetypes|Jungian archetypal theory]]). In various seemingly unrelated cases in classic storytelling, media, etc., characters or ideas sharing similar traits recur.

==Etymology==
The word ''archetype'', "original pattern from which copies are made", first entered into English usage in the 1540s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=archetype&amp;searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary - Archetype|author=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; and derives from the [[Latin]] [[noun]] ''archetypum'', [[Latinisation of Greek|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] noun {{lang|grc|ἀρχέτυπον}} (''archétypon'')'','' whose [[adjective]] form is {{lang|grc|ἀρχέτυπος}} (''archétypos''), which means "first-molded",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29rxe%2Ftupos {{lang|grc|ἀρχέτυπος}}], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; which is a compound of {{lang|grc|ἀρχή}} ''archḗ'', "beginning, origin",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29rxh%2F ἀρχή], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|grc|τύπος}} ''týpos'', which can mean, amongst other things, "pattern", "model", or "type".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtu%2Fpos τύπος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
Usage of archetypes in specific pieces of writing is a holistic approach, which can help the writing win universal acceptance. This is because readers can relate to and identify with the characters and the situation, both socially and culturally. By deploying common archetypes contextually, a writer aims to impart realism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://literarydevices.net/archetype/|title=Online Literary Device - Archetype Function}}&lt;/ref&gt; to their work.
According to many literary critics, archetypes have a standard and recurring depiction in a particular human culture and/or the whole human race that ultimately lays concrete pillars and can shape the whole structure in a literary work.

==Plato==
{{Main|Theory of Forms}}
The origins of the archetypal hypothesis date as far back as [[Plato]]. Plato's ''ideas'' were pure mental forms that were imprinted in the soul before it was born into the world. They were collective in the sense that they embodied the fundamental characteristics of a thing rather than its specific peculiarities. In the seventeenth century, Sir [[Thomas Browne]] and [[Francis Bacon]] both employ the word 'archetype' in their writings; Browne in ''[[The Garden of Cyrus]]'' (1658) attempted to depict archetypes in his usage of symbolic proper-names.

==Jungian archetypes==
{{Main|Jungian archetypes}}

The concept of psychological archetypes was advanced by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]], c. 1919. In Jung's psychological framework, archetypes are innate, universal prototypes for ideas and may be used to interpret observations. A group of memories and interpretations associated with an archetype is a [[Complex (psychology)|complex]] ( e.g. a mother complex associated with the mother archetype). Jung treated the archetypes as psychological organs, analogous to physical ones in that both are morphological constructs that arose through [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ship.edu/~cgboeree/jung.html| title = Carl Jung| first = C. George| last = Boeree| accessdate = 2006-03-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060206030011/http://www.ship.edu/~cgboeree/jung.html| archivedate= 6 February 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it has also been observed that evolution can itself be considered an archetypal construct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atpweb.org/jtparchive/trps-45-13-02-159.pdf Brown, R.S.(2013). Beyond the Evolutionary Paradigm in Consciousness Studies. The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, 45.2, 159-171.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Jung states in part one of ''Man And His Symbols'' that:&lt;blockquote&gt;My views about the 'archaic remnants', which I call 'archetypes' or 'primordial images,' have been constantly criticized by people who lack a sufficient knowledge of the psychology of dreams and of mythology. The term 'archetype' is often misunderstood as meaning certain definite mythological images or motifs, but these are nothing more than conscious representations. Such variable representations cannot be inherited. The archetype ''is a tendency to form such representations'' of a motif—representations that can vary a great deal in detail without losing their basic pattern.&lt;/blockquote&gt;While there are a variety of categorizations of archetypes, Jung's configuration is perhaps the most well known and serves as the foundation for many other models. The four major archetypes to emerge from his work, which Jung originally terms ''primordial images,'' include the anima/animus, the self, the shadow, and the persona. Additionally, Jung referred to images of the wise old man, the child, the mother, and the maiden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Archetypes of the Collective Unconscious|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9781400850969.3|work=Collected Works of C.G. Jung, Volume 9 (Part 1): Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400850969|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He believed that each human mind retains these basic unconscious understandings of the human condition and the collective knowledge of our species in the construct of the collective unconscious.

Other authors have attributed 12 different archetypes to Jung, organized in three overarching categories, based on a fundamental driving force. These include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soulcraft.co/essays/the_12_common_archetypes.html|title=The 12 Common Archetypes|website=www.soulcraft.co|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dichter's application of archetypes ==
Later in the 1900s, a Viennese psychologist named Dr. [[Ernest Dichter]] took these psychological constructs and applied them to marketing. Around 1939, he moved to New York and sent every ad agency on Madison Avenue a famous letter boasting his new discovery. He found that applying these universal themes to products promoted easier discovery and stronger loyalty for brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Retail therapy.

== Story archetypes ==
Christopher Booker, author of ''The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57131450|title=The seven basic plots : why we tell stories|last=Christopher.|first=Booker,|date=2004|publisher=Continuum|year=|isbn=0826452094|location=London|pages=|oclc=57131450}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the following basic archetypes underlie all stories:
# Overcoming the Monster
# Rags to Riches
# The Quest
# Voyage and Return
# Comedy
# Tragedy
# Rebirth
These themes coincide with the characters of Jung's archetypes.

==Archetypal literary criticism==
{{Main|Archetypal literary criticism}}

Archetypal literary criticism argues that archetypes determine the form and function of literary works and that a [[text (literary theory)|text]]'s meaning is shaped by [[culture|cultural]] and [[psychology|psychological]] myths. Cultural archetypes are the unknowable basic forms personified or made concrete by recurring [[image]]s, [[symbol]]s, or [[pattern]]s (which may include motifs such as the "[[quest]]" or the "[[Ascent to Heaven|heavenly ascent]]"; recognizable character types such as the "[[trickster]]", "[[saint]]", "[[martyr]]" or the "[[hero]]"; symbols such as the apple or the snake; and imagery) and that have all been laden with meaning prior to their inclusion in any particular work.

The archetypes reveal shared roles among universal societies, such as the role of the mother in her natural relations with all members of the family. This archetype may create a shared imagery which is defined by many stereotypes that have not separated themselves from the traditional, biological, religious and mythical framework.&lt;ref&gt;

A hub of tourism, many private banks service the city and maintain underground bunkers and storage facilities for gold at the foothills of the [[Swiss Alps]].]]{{Culture of Switzerland}}'''Banking in Switzerland''' began in the early 18th century through [[Switzerland]]'s merchant trade and has, over the centuries, grown into a complex, regulated, and international industry. Along with the [[Swiss Alps]], [[Swiss chocolate]], watchmaking and mountaineering, banking is seen as [[Culture of Switzerland|emblematic of Switzerland]]. Switzerland has a [[Banking in Switzerland#Banking secrecy|long, kindred history of banking secrecy]] and client confidentiality reaching back to the early 1700s. Started as a way to protect wealthy European banking interests, Swiss banking secrecy was codified in 1934 with the passage of the landmark federal law, the [[Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks]].   &lt;!--This article's banking secrecy section is mean't to be the *most comprehensive treatment of Swiss banking secrecy* on Wikipedia, everything else should be directed or redirected appropriately. --&gt;&lt;!--There is a purposeful lack of citations in the lede of this article as per WP:WHENNOTCITE. The standard allows the lead to remain relatively cite-less if all the information is sourced in the main body.

Controversial protection of foreign accounts and assets during [[World War II]] sparked a series of proposed financial regulations seeking to temper bank secrecy to little success. Switzerland, considered the "grandfather of bank secrecy", has been one of the largest [[Offshore financial centre|offshore financial centers]] and [[tax haven]]s in the world since the mid-20th century. Despite [[Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks#Revisions|an international push]] to meaningfully roll back banking secrecy laws in the country, Swiss social and political forces have minimized and reverted much of proposed roll backs. Disclosing client information has been considered a serious social and criminal offence since the early 1900s. Employees working in Switzerland and abroad at Swiss banks "have long adhered to an unwritten code similar to that [[Non-disclosure agreement|observed by doctors or priests]]".&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Since 1934, banking secrecy laws have been violated by four people: [[Christoph Meili]] (1997), [[Bradley Birkenfeld]] (2007), [[Rudolf Elmer]] (2011), and [[Hervé Falciani]] (2014). After insurmountable professional setbacks, all the men were either fired or resigned from their banks, served with federal arrest warrants and fined.

The [[Swiss Bankers Association]] (SBA) estimated in 2018 that Swiss banks held [[United States dollar|US$]]6.5 trillion in assets or 25% of all global cross-border assets. Switzerland's main lingual hubs, [[Geneva]] (for French), [[Lugano]] (for Italian), and [[Zürich]] (for German) service the different geographical markets. It consistently ranks in the top three states on the [[Financial Secrecy Index]] and was named first many times, most recently in 2018. The three largest banks–[[UBS]], [[Credit Suisse]], [[Julius Baer Group|Julius Bär]]–are all regulated by the [[Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority]] (FINMA), and the [[Swiss National Bank]] (NSB) which derives its authority from a series of federal statutes. Banking in Switzerland has historically played, and still continues to play, a dominant role in the [[Economy of Switzerland|Swiss economy]] and society. According to the [[OECD|Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), total banking assets amount to 467% of total gross domestic product.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;[[Banking in Switzerland#Bibliography|Financial Secrecy Index: Narrative Report on Switzerland (2018)]], p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Banking in Switzerland [[Banking in Switzerland#In popular culture|has been portrayed]], to varying degrees of accuracy, in overall popular culture, books, movies, and television shows.

'''Behaviorism''' (or '''behaviourism''') is a systematic approach to understanding the behavior of humans and other animals. It assumes that all behaviors are either [[reflex]]es produced by a response to certain stimuli in the environment, or a consequence of that individual's history, including especially reinforcement and punishment, together with the individual's current motivational state and controlling stimuli.  Although behaviorists generally accept the important role of inheritance in determining behavior, they focus primarily on environmental factors.
 
Behaviorism combines elements of philosophy, methodology, and psychological theory. It emerged in the late nineteenth century as a reaction to [[depth psychology]] and other traditional forms of psychology, which often had difficulty making predictions that could be tested experimentally. The earliest derivatives of Behaviorism can be traced back to the late 19th century where [[Edward Thorndike]] pioneered the [[law of effect]], a process that involved strengthening behavior through the use of [[reinforcement]].

During the first half of the twentieth century, [[John B. Watson]] devised [[methodological behaviorism]], which rejected [[introspection|introspective methods]] and sought to understand behavior by only measuring observable behaviors and events. It was not until the 1930s that [[B. F. Skinner]] suggested that private events—including thoughts and feelings—should be subjected to the same controlling variables as observable behavior, which became the basis for his philosophy called "[[radical behaviorism]]."&lt;ref name=RadicalBehaviorismCAB&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.behavior.org/item.php?id=154|title=Radical Behaviorism: The Philosophy and the Science|author=Chiesa, Mecca|publisher=Authors Cooperative, Inc.|isbn=0962331147|pages=1–241|date=1994|accessdate=July 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904195958/http://www.behavior.org/item.php?id=154|archive-date=2017-09-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABA&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13668250902845244|title=None of the As in ABA stand for autism: Dispelling the myths|author1=Dillenburger, Karola|author2=Keenan, Mickey|lastauthoramp=yes|journal=Journal of Intellectual and Developmental Disability|volume=34|issue=2|pages=193–195|date=2009|accessdate=2014-12-24|doi=10.1080/13668250902845244|pmid=19404840}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Watson and [[Ivan Pavlov]] investigated the stimulus-response procedures of [[classical conditioning]], Skinner assessed the controlling nature of consequences and also its potential effect on the [[Stimulus control|antecedents (or discriminative stimuli) that strengthens behavior]]; the technique became known as [[operant conditioning]].

Skinner's radical behaviorism has been highly successful experimentally, revealing new phenomena with new methods, but Skinner’s dismissal of theory limited its development.  Theoretical behaviorism&lt;ref&gt;Staddon, John (2014) The New Behaviorism (2nd edition)  Philadelphia, PA: Psychology Press.  &lt;/ref&gt; recognized that a historical system, an organism, has a state as well as sensitivity to stimuli and the ability to emit responses.  Indeed, Skinner himself acknowledged the possibility of what he called “latent” responses in humans, even though he neglected to extend this idea to rats and pigeons&lt;ref&gt;Staddon, J. Theoretical behaviorism. Philosophy and Behavior. (45) in press.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Latent responses constitute a repertoire, from which operant reinforcement can select.  

The application of radical behaviorism—known as [[applied behavior analysis]]—is used in a variety of settings, including, for example, [[organizational behavior management]], to the treatment of mental disorders, such as [[autism]] and [[substance abuse]].&lt;ref name=JABA1968&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1310980|title=Some current dimensions of applied behavior analysis|author1=Baer, Donald M.|author2=Wolf, Montrose M.|author3=Risley, Todd R.|work=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=1|issue=1|date=1968|pmid=16795165|pages=91–7|doi=10.1901/jaba.1968.1-91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APA-Handbook-BehaviorAnalysis"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/books/4311509.aspx|title=APA Handbook of Behavior Analysis|editor=Madden, Gregory J.|date=2013|accessdate=December 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APA-BehaviorAnalysis"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/bar/index.aspx?tab=1|title=Behavior Analysis: Research and Practice|editor=Crone-Todd, Darlene|date=2015|accessdate=2014-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, while behaviorism and [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]] schools of psychological thought may not agree theoretically, they have complemented each other in [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavior therapies]], which have demonstrated utility in treating certain pathologies, including simple [[phobia]]s, [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]], and [[mood disorders]].

==Varieties&lt;!--'Methodological behaviorism' redirects here--&gt;==
There is no universally agreed-upon classification, but some titles given to the various branches of behaviorism include:
* '''Methodological behaviorism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;: [[John B. Watson|Watson]]'s behaviorism states that only public events (behaviors of an individual) can be objectively observed, and that therefore private events (thoughts and feelings) should be ignored.&lt;ref name=RadicalBehaviorismCAB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Skinner1976&gt;{{cite book |last=Skinner |first=BF |title=About Behaviorism |year=1976 |publisher=Random House, Inc. |location=New York |isbn=0-394-71618-3 |page=18 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/About_Behaviorism.html?id=K7WKkwPzNqsC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; It also became the basis for the early approach [[behavior modification]] in the 1970s and early 1980s.
* [[Radical behaviorism]]: [[B. F. Skinner]]'s behaviorism theorizes that processes within the organism should be acknowledged, particularly the presence of private events (such as thoughts and feelings), and suggests that environmental variables also control these internal events just as they control observable behaviors. Radical behaviorism forms the core philosophy behind [[applied behavior analysis|behavior analysis]]. [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] used many of radical behaviorism's ideas in his study of knowledge and language.&lt;ref name=Skinner1976/&gt;
* [[Teleological behaviorism]]: Post-Skinnerian, purposive, close to [[microeconomics]]. Focuses on objective observation as opposed to cognitive processes.
* [[Psychological behaviorism]]: As proposed by [[Arthur W. Staats]], unlike the previous behaviorisms of Skinner, Hull, and Tolman, was based upon a program of human research involving various types of human behavior. Psychological behaviorism introduces new principles of human learning. Humans learn not only by the animal learning principles but also by special human learning principles. Those principles involve human's uniquely huge learning ability. Humans learn repertoires that enable them to learn other things. Human learning is thus cumulative. No other animal demonstrates that ability, making the human species unique.
* [[Interbehaviorism]]: Founded by [[Jacob Robert Kantor]] before Skinner's writings.

Two subtypes are:
* [[Clark L. Hull|Hullian]] and post-Hullian: theoretical, group data, not dynamic, physiological
* Purposive: [[Edward C. Tolman|Tolman]]'s behavioristic anticipation of cognitive psychology

===Radical behaviorism===
{{main article|Radical behaviorism}}
B. F. Skinner proposed radical behaviorism as the conceptual underpinning of the [[experimental analysis of behavior]]. This view differs from other approaches to behavioral research in various ways but, most notably here, it contrasts with methodological behaviorism in accepting feelings, states of mind and introspection as behaviors subject to scientific investigation. Like methodological behaviorism it rejects the reflex as a model of all behavior, and it defends the science of behavior as complementary to but independent of physiology. Radical behaviorism overlaps considerably with other western philosophical positions such as American pragmatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moxley |first=R.A. |year=2004 |title=Pragmatic selectionism: The philosophy of behavior analysis |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=108–25 |url=http://www.baojournal.com |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental and conceptual innovations==
This essentially philosophical position gained strength from the success of Skinner's early experimental work with rats and pigeons, summarized in his books ''The Behavior of Organisms''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Skinner |first=B.F. |authorlink= B.F. Skinner |title=[[The Behavior of Organisms]] |publisher=Copley Pub Group |year=1991 |page=473 |isbn=0-87411-487-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Schedules of Reinforcement''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cheney, Carl D. |author2=Ferster, Charles B. |title=Schedules of Reinforcement (B.F. Skinner Reprint Series) |publisher=Copley Publishing Group |location=Acton, MA |year=1997 |page=758 |isbn=0-87411-828-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular importance was his concept of the operant response, of which the canonical example was the rat's lever-press. In contrast with the idea of a physiological or reflex response, an operant is a class of structurally distinct but functionally equivalent responses. For example, while a rat might press a lever with its left paw or its right paw or its tail, all of these responses operate on the world in the same way and have a common consequence. Operants are often thought of as species of responses, where the individuals differ but the class coheres in its function-shared consequences with operants and reproductive success with species. This is a clear distinction between Skinner's theory and [[S–R theory]].

Skinner's empirical work expanded on earlier research on [[trial-and-error]] learning by researchers such as Thorndike and Guthrie with both conceptual reformulations—Thorndike's notion of a stimulus–response "association" or "connection" was abandoned; and methodological ones—the use of the "free operant", so called because the animal was now permitted to respond at its own rate rather than in a series of trials determined by the experimenter procedures. With this method, Skinner carried out substantial experimental work on the effects of different schedules and rates of reinforcement on the rates of operant responses made by rats and pigeons. He achieved remarkable success in training animals to perform unexpected responses, to emit large numbers of responses, and to demonstrate many empirical regularities at the purely behavioral level. This lent some credibility to his conceptual analysis. It is largely his conceptual analysis that made his work much more rigorous than his peers', a point which can be seen clearly in his seminal work ''Are Theories of Learning Necessary?'' in which he criticizes what he viewed to be theoretical weaknesses then common in the study of psychology. An important descendant of the experimental analysis of behavior is the [[Society for Quantitative Analysis of Behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Commons |first=M.L. |year=2001 |title=A short history of the Society for the Quantitative Analysis of Behavior |journal=Behavior Analyst Today |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=275–9 |url=http://www.baojournal.com |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Thornbury |first1= Scott|title=The Lexical Approach: A journey without maps|journal=Modern English Teacher|date=1998|volume=7 | issue = 4 |pages= 7–13| url= http://nebula.wsimg.com/9129eed8a13130f4ee92cf2c3ce5b13e?AccessKeyId=186A535D1BA4FC995A73&amp;disposition=0&amp;alloworigin=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to language==
As Skinner turned from experimental work to concentrate on the philosophical underpinnings of a science of behavior, his attention turned to human language with his 1957 book ''[[Verbal Behavior]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Burrhus Frederick |last=Skinner |title=Verbal Behavior |location=Acton, Massachusetts |publisher=Copley Publishing Group |year=1957 |isbn= 1-58390-021-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other language-related publications;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Skinner |first=B.F. |year=1969 |title=An operant analysis of problem-solving |pages=133–57}}; chapter in {{cite book |last= Skinner| first= B.F. |year=1969 |title=Contingencies of reinforcement: a theoretical analysis |publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts |isbn=0-13-171728-6 |page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Verbal Behavior'' laid out a vocabulary and theory for functional analysis of verbal behavior, and was strongly criticized in a review by [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Review of B.F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior |journal=Language |issue=1 |url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1967----.htm |year=1959 |pages=26–58 |author1=Chomsky, Noam |authorlink1=Noam Chomsky |doi=10.2307/411334 |volume=35 |jstor=411334 |author2=Skinner, B.F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennison |first=Shelia M.|year=2013 |title= Introduction to language development |location=Los Angeles |publisher= SAGE Publications| isbn= 9781483315324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner did not respond in detail but claimed that Chomsky failed to understand his ideas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Skinner| first= B.F. |title=I Have Been Misunderstood. |journal=Center Magazine |year=1972 |issue= March–April |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the disagreements between the two and the theories involved have been further discussed.&lt;ref name=MacCorquodale1970&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacCorquodale |first=K. |year=1970 |title=On Chomsky's Review of Skinner's VERBAL BEHAVIOR |journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=83–99 |url=https://www.behavior.org/computer-modeling/maccorquodale/maccorquodale2.cfm |accessdate=2008-01-10 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1970.13-83 |pmc=1333660 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106061500/http://www.behavior.org/computer-modeling/maccorquodale/maccorquodale2.cfm |archive-date=2009-01-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid2103585"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Stemmer| first= N. |title=Skinner's verbal behavior, Chomsky's review, and mentalism |journal=J Exp Anal Behav |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=307–15 |year=1990 |pmid=2103585 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1990.54-307 |pmc=1323000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Innateness hypothesis|Innateness theory]] is opposed to behaviorist theory which claims that language is a set of habits that can be acquired by means of conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1= Thornbury| first1= Scott| title= An A-Z of ELT|date=2006|publisher=Macmillan|location=Oxford|isbn=1405070633|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Douglas Brown |first1= H| title= Principles of Language Learning and Teaching|date=2000|publisher=Longman/Pearson Education|location=White Plains |isbn= 0-13-017816-0| pages= 8–9| edition= Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some, the behaviorist account is a process which would be too slow to explain a phenomenon as complicated as language learning. What was important for a behaviorist's analysis of human behavior was not [[language acquisition]] so much as the interaction between language and overt behavior. In an essay republished in his 1969 book ''Contingencies of Reinforcement'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Skinner| first= B.F. |year=1969 |title=Contingencies of reinforcement: a theoretical analysis |publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts |isbn=0-13-171728-6 |page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner took the view that humans could construct linguistic stimuli that would then acquire control over their behavior in the same way that external stimuli could. The possibility of such "instructional control" over behavior meant that contingencies of reinforcement would not always produce the same effects on human behavior as they reliably do in other animals. The focus of a radical behaviorist analysis of human behavior therefore shifted to an attempt to understand the interaction between instructional control and contingency control, and also to understand the behavioral processes that determine what instructions are constructed and what control they acquire over behavior. Recently, a new line of behavioral research on language was started under the name of [[relational frame theory]].

==Education==
{{see also|Philosophy of education#Realism}}
Behaviourism focuses on one particular view of learning: a change in external behaviour achieved through using reinforcement and repetition ([[Rote learning]]) to shape behavior of learners. Skinner found that behaviors could be shaped when the use of reinforcement was implemented. Desired behavior is rewarded, while the undesired behavior is not rewarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.learning-theories.com/behaviorism.html|title=Behaviorism - Learning Theories|date=2007-01-31|work=Learning Theories|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporating behaviorism into the classroom allowed educators to assist their students in excelling both academically and personally. In the field of language learning, this type of teaching was called the [[audio-lingual method]], characterised by the whole class using choral chanting of key phrases, dialogues and immediate correction.

Within the behaviourist view of learning, the "teacher" is the dominant person in the classroom and takes complete control, evaluation of learning comes from the teacher who decides what is right or wrong. The learner does not have any opportunity for evaluation or reflection within the learning process, they are simply told what is right or wrong.
The conceptualization of learning using this approach could be considered "superficial" as the focus is on external changes in behaviour i.e. not interested in the internal processes of learning leading to behaviour change and has no place for the emotions involved the process.

==Operant conditioning==
{{main article|Operant conditioning}}
[[Operant conditioning]] was developed by [[B.F. Skinner]] in 1937 and deals with the [[behaviour modification|modification of "voluntary behaviour"]] or operant behaviour. Operant behavior operates on the environment and is maintained by its consequences. [[Reinforcement]] and [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]], the core tools of operant conditioning, are either positive (delivered following a response), or negative (withdrawn following a response).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.learning-theories.com/operant-conditioning-skinner.html|title=Classical and Operant Conditioning - Behaviorist Theories|date=2015-06-19|work=Learning Theories|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner created the ''Skinner Box'' or [[operant conditioning chamber]] to test the effects of operant conditioning principles on rats. From this study, he discovered that the rats learned very effectively if they were rewarded frequently. Skinner also found that he could shape the rats' behavior through the use of rewards, which could, in turn, be applied to human learning as well.

==Classical conditioning==
{{main article|Classical conditioning}}
Although [[operant conditioning]] plays the largest role in discussions of behavioral mechanisms, [[classical conditioning]] (or Pavlovian conditioning or respondent conditioning) is also an important behavior-analytic process that need not refer to mental or other internal processes. Pavlov's experiments with dogs provide the most familiar example of the classical conditioning procedure.  In simple conditioning, the dog was presented with a stimulus such as a light or a sound, and then food was placed in the dog's mouth.  After a few repetitions of this sequence, the light or sound by itself caused the dog to salivate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ivan Pavlov|url=http://www.ivanpavlov.com/|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Pavlov proposed some tentative physiological processes that might be involved in classical conditioning, these have not been confirmed.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The idea of classical conditioning helped behaviorist John Watson discover the key mechanism behind how humans acquire the behaviors that they do, which was to find a natural reflex that produces the response being considered.

[[John B. Watson|Watson]]'s "Behaviourist Manifesto" has three aspects that deserve special recognition: one is that psychology should be purely objective, with any interpretation of conscious experience being removed, thus leading to psychology as the "science of behaviour"; the second one is that the goals of psychology should be to predict and control behaviour (as opposed to describe and explain conscious mental states; the third one is that there is no notable distinction between human and non-human behaviour. Following Darwin's theory of evolution, this would simply mean that human behaviour is just a more complex version in respect to behaviour displayed by other species.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gross, Psychology: The Science of Mind and Behaviour&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==
{{main|Logical behaviorism}}
Behaviorism is a psychological movement that can be contrasted with [[philosophy of mind]]. The basic premise of ''radical behaviorism'' is that the study of behavior should be a [[natural science]], such as [[chemistry]] or [[physics]], without any reference to hypothetical inner states of organisms as causes for their behavior. Less radical varieties are unconcerned with philosophical positions on internal, mental and subjective experience. Behaviorism takes a functional view of behavior. According to [[Edmund Fantino]] and colleagues: "Behavior analysis has much to offer the study of phenomena normally dominated by cognitive and social psychologists. We hope that successful application of behavioral theory and methodology will not only shed light on central problems in judgment and choice but will also generate greater appreciation of the behavioral approach."&lt;ref name=Fantino2003&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fantino, E. |author2=Stolarz-Fantino, S. |author3=Navarro, A.  |year=2003 |title=Logical fallacies: A behavioral approach to reasoning |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=4 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bar/4/1/109.html |accessdate=2008-01-10 |at=p.116 (pp.109–117)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behaviorist sentiments are not uncommon within [[philosophy of language]] and [[analytic philosophy]]. It is sometimes argued that [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] defended a [[Logical behaviorism|logical behaviorist]] position&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=behaviorism |title=Behaviorism}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., the ''[[Philosophical Investigations#Wittgenstein's beetle|beetle in a box]]'' argument). In [[logical positivism]] (as held, e.g., by [[Rudolf Carnap]]&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; and [[Carl Hempel]]),&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;  the meaning of psychological statements are their verification conditions, which consist of performed overt behavior. [[W. V. O. Quine]] made use of a type of behaviorism,&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;  influenced by some of Skinner's ideas, in his own work on language. Quine's work in semantics differed substantially from the empiricist semantics of Carnap which he attempted to create an alternative to, couching his semantic theory in references to physical objects rather than sensations. [[Gilbert Ryle]] defended a distinct strain of philosophical behaviorism, sketched in his book ''The Concept of Mind''.&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;  Ryle's central claim was that instances of dualism frequently represented "[[category mistake]]s", and hence that they were really misunderstandings of the use of ordinary language. [[Daniel Dennett]] likewise acknowledges himself to be a type of behaviorist,&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/msgisno.htm |title=The Message is: There is no Medium |last=Dennett |first=D.C. |authorlink=Daniel Dennett |accessdate=2008-01-10 |publisher=Tufts University| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080111100055/http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/msgisno.htm| archivedate= 11 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he offers extensive criticism of radical behaviorism and refutes Skinner's rejection of the value of intentional idioms and the possibility of free will.&lt;ref name="Dennett1981"&gt;{{cite book |first=Daniel |last=Dennett |year=1981 |title=Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology |series=Bradford Books |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-54037-7 |lccn=78013723 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xwObaAZEwoC&amp;pg=PA53 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|This is Dennett's main point in "Skinner Skinned." Dennett argues that there is a crucial difference between explaining and explaining away… If our explanation of apparently rational behavior turns out to be extremely simple, we may want to say that the behavior was not really rational after all. But if the explanation is very complex and intricate, we may want to say not that the behavior is not rational, but that we now have a better understanding of what rationality consists in. (Compare: if we find out how a computer program solves problems in linear algebra, we don't say it's not really solving them, we just say we know how it does it. On the other hand, in cases like [[Joseph Weizenbaum|Weizenbaum's]] [[ELIZA]] program, the explanation of how the computer carries on a conversation is so simple that the right thing to say seems to be that the machine isn't really carrying on a conversation, it's just a trick.)|Curtis Brown|Philosophy of Mind|"Behaviorism: Skinner and Dennett"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Behaviorism: Skinner and Dennett |year=2001 |work=Philosophy of Mind |first=Curtis |last=Brown |publisher=Trinity University |location=San Antonio, TX |url=http://www.trinity.edu/cbrown/mind/behaviorism.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
===Molecular versus molar behaviorism===
Skinner's view of behavior is most often characterized as a "molecular" view of behavior; that is, behavior can be decomposed into atomistic parts or molecules. This view is inconsistent with Skinner's complete description of behavior as delineated in other works, including his 1981 article "Selection by Consequences".&lt;ref name=Skinner1981&gt;{{Cite journal |date=31 July 1981 |author=Skinner, B.F |title=Selection by Consequences |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=213 |issue=4507 |pages=501–4 |doi=10.1126/science.7244649 |url=http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/Classes/31174/Documents/Selection%20by%20Consequences.pdf |accessdate=14 August 2010 |pmid=7244649 |bibcode=1981Sci...213..501S |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702230825/http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/Classes/31174/Documents/Selection%20by%20Consequences.pdf |archivedate=2 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner proposed that a complete account of behavior requires understanding of selection history at three levels: [[biology]] (the [[natural selection]] or [[phylogeny]] of the animal); behavior (the reinforcement history or ontogeny of the behavioral repertoire of the animal); and for some species, [[culture]] (the cultural practices of the social group to which the animal belongs). This whole organism then interacts with its environment. Molecular behaviorists use notions from [[melioration theory]], [[hyperbolic discounting|negative power function discounting]] or additive versions of negative power function discounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fantino, E. |title=Delay-reduction theory—the case for temporal context: comment on Grace and Savastano (2000) |journal=J Exp Psychol Gen |volume=129 |issue=4 |pages=444–6 |year=2000 |pmid=11142857 |doi=10.1037/0096-3445.129.4.444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molar behaviorists, such as [[Howard Rachlin]], [[Richard Herrnstein]], and William Baum, argue that behavior cannot be understood by focusing on events in the moment. That is, they argue that behavior is best understood as the ultimate product of an organism's history and that molecular behaviorists are committing a fallacy by inventing fictitious proximal causes for behavior. Molar behaviorists argue that standard molecular constructs, such as "associative strength", are better replaced by molar variables such as [[rate of reinforcement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baum, W.M. |year=2003 |title=The molar view of behavior and its usefulness in behavior analysis |journal=Behavior Analyst Today |volume=4 |pages=78–81 |url=http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=abstract&amp;id=206927 |accessdate=2008-01-10 |doi=10.1037/h0100009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904101644/http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=abstract&amp;id=206927 |archive-date=2009-09-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a molar behaviorist would describe "loving someone" as a pattern of [[love|loving behavior]] over time; there is no isolated, proximal cause of loving behavior, only a history of behaviors (of which the current behavior might be an example) that can be summarized as "love".

===21st-century behavior analysis===
{{Advert|section|date=March 2015}}
The early term [[behavior modification]] has been obsolete since the 1990s as it currently refers to the brief revival of methodological behaviorism in the 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name=JABA1994&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1297814|title=The significance and future of functional analysis methodologies|author=Mace, F.

The independent development of behaviour analysis outside the US also continues to develop, In terms of motivation, there remains strong interest in the variety of human motivational behaviour factors, e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kellaway|first1=Lucy|title=My team gets more excited by loo roll than business budgets: Work problems answered|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a06bab2a-8ab7-11e4-8e24-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3sEMws3TI|accessdate=22 November 2015|publisher=Financial Times|date=7 January 2015|location=London|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eyres|first1=Harry|title=Peaks in a trough year: The Slow Lane|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/ec975ad6-e9cb-11de-ae43-00144feab49a,Authorised=false.html?siteedition=uk&amp;_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2Fec975ad6-e9cb-11de-ae43-00144feab49a.html%3Fsiteedition%3Duk&amp;_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.ft.com%2Fsearch%3FqueryText%3DPeaks%2Bin%2Ba%2Btrough%2BEYRES&amp;classification=conditional_standard&amp;iab=barrier-app|accessdate=22 November 2015|publisher=Financial Times|date=19 December 2009|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stern|first1=Stefan|title=Keep up motivation levels through long summer days|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/8e995bca-6284-11dd-9a1e-000077b07658,Authorised=false.html?siteedition=uk&amp;_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F8e995bca-6284-11dd-9a1e-000077b07658.html%3Fsiteedition%3Duk&amp;_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.ft.com%2Fsearch%3FqueryText%3DKeep%2Bup%2Bmotivation%2Blevels%2Bstern&amp;classification=conditional_standard&amp;iab=barrier-app#axzz3sEMws3TI|accessdate=22 November 2015|publisher=Financial Times|date=5 August 2008|location=London|page=12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122232423/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/8e995bca-6284-11dd-9a1e-000077b07658,Authorised=false.html?siteedition=uk&amp;_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F8e995bca-6284-11dd-9a1e-000077b07658.html%3Fsiteedition%3Duk&amp;_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.ft.com%2Fsearch%3FqueryText%3DKeep%2Bup%2Bmotivation%2Blevels%2Bstern&amp;classification=conditional_standard&amp;iab=barrier-app#axzz3sEMws3TI|archive-date=2015-11-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Skapinker|first1=Michael|title=Human capitalism: Does treating workers well help business too?

Some, may go as far as suggesting that the current rapid change in organisational behaviour could partly be attributed to some of these theories and the theories that are related to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reinventing the deal; American capitalism|issue=417.8961|publisher=The Economist|date=24 October 2015|location=London|pages=21–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interests among behavior analysts today are wide-ranging, as a review of the 30 Special Interest Groups (SIGs) within ABAI indicates. Such interests include everything from developmental disabilities and autism, to cultural psychology, clinical psychology, verbal behavior, [[Organizational Behavior Management]] (OBM; behavior analytic I–O psychology). OBM has developed a particularly strong following within behavior analysis, as evidenced by the formation of the OBM Network and the influential ''Journal of Organizational Behavior Management'' (JOBM; recently rated the 3rd highest impact journal in applied psychology by ISI JOBM rating).

Applications of behavioral technology, also known as applied behavior analysis or ABA, have been particularly well established in the area of developmental disabilities since the 1960s.  Treatment of individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders has grown especially rapidly since the mid-1990s.  This demand for services encouraged the formation of a professional credentialing program administered by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board, Inc. (BACB) and accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies.  As of early 2012, there are over 300 BACB approved course sequences offered by about 200 colleges and universities worldwide preparing students for this credential and approximately 11,000 BACB certificants, most working in the United States.  The Association of Professional Behavior Analysts was formed in 2008 to meet the needs of these ABA professionals.

Modern [[behavior analysis]] has also witnessed a massive resurgence in research and applications related to language and cognition, with the development of [[relational frame theory]] (RFT; described as a "Post-Skinnerian account of language and cognition").&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, S.C.; Barnes-Holmes, D. &amp; Roche, B. (2001) Relational Frame Theory: A Post-Skinnerian account of human language and cognition. Kluwer Academic: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; RFT also forms the empirical basis for the highly successful and data-driven [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT). In fact, researchers and practitioners in RFT/ACT have become sufficiently prominent that they have formed their own specialized organization that is highly behaviorally oriented, known as the [[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]] (ACBS). 

Some of the current prominent behavior analytic journals include the ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis'' (JABA), the ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'' (JEAB) JEAB website, the ''Journal of Organizational Behavior Management'' (JOBM), ''Behavior and Social Issues'' (BSI), as well as ''[[the Psychological Record]]''. Currently, the US has 14 ABAI accredited MA and PhD programs for comprehensive study in behavior analysis.

==Behavior analysis and culture==
Cultural analysis has always been at the philosophical core of radical behaviorism from the early days (as seen in Skinner's ''[[Walden Two]]'', ''Science &amp; Human Behavior'', ''Beyond Freedom &amp; Dignity'', and ''About Behaviorism'').

During the 1980s, behavior analysts, most notably Sigrid Glenn, had a productive interchange with cultural anthropologist [[Marvin Harris]] (the most notable proponent of "cultural materialism") regarding interdisciplinary work. Very recently, behavior analysts have produced a set of basic exploratory experiments in an effort toward this end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ward |first=Todd A. |last2=Eastman |first2= Raymond |last3=Ninness |first3=Chris |year=2009 |title=An Experimental Analysis of Cultural Materialism: The Effects of Various Modes of Production on Resource Sharing |url=http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/bsi/article/view/1950/2185 |journal=Behavior and Social Issues |volume=18 |pages=1–23 |doi=10.5210/bsi.v18i1.1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviorism is also frequently used in [[game development]], although this application is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Gamification, Behaviorism and Bullsh$!|author=Jon Radoff|year=2011|journal=Radoff.com|url=http://radoff.com/blog/2011/08/09/gamification-behaviorism-bullshit/|access-date=2011-08-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003003247/http://radoff.com/blog/2011/08/09/gamification-behaviorism-bullshit/|archive-date=2011-10-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavior informatics and behavior computing ==
With the fast growth of big behavioral data and applications, behavior analysis is ubiquitous. Understanding behavior from the informatics and computing perspective becomes increasingly critical for in-depth understanding of what, why and how behaviors are formed, interact, evolve, change and affect business and decision. [[Behavior informatics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cao|first=Longbing|date=|year=2010|title=In-depth Behavior Understanding and Use: the Behavior Informatics Approach|url=|journal=Information Science|volume=180|issue=17|pages=3067–3085|doi=10.1016/j.ins.2010.03.025|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cao|first=Longbing|last2=Joachims|first2=Thorsten|date=|year=2014|title=Behavior Informatics: A New Perspective.|url=|journal=IEEE Intelligent Systems|volume=29|issue=4|pages=62–80|doi=10.1109/mis.2014.60|pmid=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[behavior computing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Behavior Computing: Modeling, Analysis, Mining and Decision|last=Cao|first=Longbing|last2=Yu|first2=Philip (eds)|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4471-2969-1|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Behavior and Social Computing|last=Cao|first=Longbing|last2=Motoda|first2=Hiroshi|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=978-3-319-04047-9|location=|pages=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; deeply explore behavior intelligence and behavior insights from the informatics and computing perspectives.

== Criticisms and limitations ==
{{See also|Cognitive psychology|Cognitive neuroscience}}
In the second half of the 20th century, behaviorism was largely eclipsed as a result of the [[cognitive revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Friesen, N. (2005). Mind and Machine: Ethical and Epistemological Implications for Research. Thompson Rivers University, B.C., Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waldrop, M.M. (2002). ''The Dream Machine: JCR Licklider and the revolution that made computing personal''. New York: Penguin Books. (pp. 139–40).&lt;/ref&gt; This shift was due to methodological behaviorism being highly criticized for not examining mental processes, and this led to the development of the [[cognitive therapy]] movement.
In the mid-20th century, three main influences arose that would inspire and shape cognitive psychology as a formal school of thought:
* [[Noam Chomsky]]'s 1959 critique of behaviorism, and empiricism more generally, initiated what would come to be known as the "[[cognitive revolution]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chomsky | first1 = N | year = 1959 | title = Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior | url = | journal = Language | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 26–58 | doi = 10.2307/411334 }}
Chomsky N. Preface to the reprint of A Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior. In: Jakobovits L.A, Miron M.S, editors. Readings in the psychology of language. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Developments in computer science would lead to parallels being drawn between human thought and the computational functionality of computers, opening entirely new areas of psychological thought. [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] spent years developing the concept of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) and later worked with cognitive psychologists regarding the implications of AI. The effective result was more of a framework conceptualization of mental functions with their counterparts in computers (memory, storage, retrieval, etc.)
* Formal recognition of the field involved the establishment of research institutions such as [[George Mandler]]'s Center for Human Information Processing in 1964. Mandler described the origins of cognitive psychology in a 2002 article in the ''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mandler|first=George|title=Origins of the cognitive (r)evolution|year=2002|journal=Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences|volume=38|pages=339–353|doi=10.1002/jhbs.10066|pmid=12404267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of cognitive psychology, behaviorist critics held that the empiricism it pursued was incompatible with the concept of internal mental states. [[Cognitive neuroscience]], however, continues to gather evidence of direct correlations between physiological brain activity and putative mental states, endorsing the basis for cognitive psychology.

{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}
In science, computing, and engineering, a '''black box''' is a device, system or object which can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs (or [[Transfer function|transfer characteristics]]), without any knowledge of its internal workings. Its implementation is "opaque" (black). Almost anything might be referred to as a black box: a [[transistor]], an [[algorithm]], or the [[human brain]].

[[File:Blackbox3D-withGraphs.png|thumb|centre|595x595px|&lt;center&gt;Black box model&lt;/center&gt;]]

To analyse something modeled as an [[open system (systems theory)|open system]], with a typical "black box approach", only  the behavior of the stimulus/response will be accounted for, to infer the (unknown) ''box''. The usual representation of this ''black box system''  is a [[data flow diagram]] centered in the box.

The opposite of a black box is a system where the inner components or logic are available for inspection, which is most commonly referred to as a [[white box (software engineering)|white box]] (sometimes also known as a "clear box" or a "glass box"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Holzinger|first=Andreas|last2=Plass|first2=Markus|last3=Holzinger|first3=Katharina|last4=Crisan|first4=Gloria Cerasela|last5=Pintea|first5=Camelia-M.|last6=Palade|first6=Vasile|date=2017-08-03|title=A glass-box interactive machine learning approach for solving NP-hard problems with the human-in-the-loop|eprint=1708.01104|class=cs.AI}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==History==

The modern meaning of the term "black box" seems to have entered the English language around 1945. In electronic [[circuit theory]] the process of [[network synthesis filters|network synthesis]] from [[transfer function]]s, which led to electronic circuits being regarded as "black boxes" characterized by their response to signals applied to their [[Port (circuit theory)|ports]], can be traced to [[Wilhelm Cauer]] who published his ideas in their most developed form in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Cauer, Wilhelm; ''Theorie der linearen Wechselstromschaltungen'', '''Vol.I''', Akademische Verlags-Gesellschaft Becker und Erler, Leipzig, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Cauer did not himself use the term, others who followed him certainly did describe the method as black-box analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Cauer, Emil; Mathis, Wolfgang; and Pauli, Rainer; "Life and Work of Wilhelm Cauer (1900&amp;nbsp;– 1945)", ''Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Symposium of Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems (MTNS2000)'', p4, Perpignan, June, 2000. [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall03/cs323/links/cauer.pdf Retrieved online] 19 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vitold Belevitch]]&lt;ref&gt;Belevitch, Vitold; "Summary of the history of circuit theory", ''Proceedings of the IRE'', '''vol 50''', Iss 5, pp. 848-855, May 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; puts the concept of black-boxes even earlier, attributing the explicit use of [[two-port network]]s as black boxes to [[Franz Breisig]] in 1921 and argues that 2-terminal components were implicitly treated as black-boxes before that.

In [[cybernetics]], a full treatment was given by [[Ross Ashby]] in 1956.&lt;ref name="ash56"&gt;Ashby, W. Ross; ''An introduction to cybernetics'', London: Chapman &amp; Hall, 1956, chapter 6: ''The black box'', pp. 86{{ndash}}117.&lt;/ref&gt; A black box was described by [[Norbert Wiener]] in 1961 as an unknown system that was to be identified using the techniques of [[system identification]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiener, Norbert; ''Cybernetics: or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine'', MIT Press, 1961, {{ISBN|0-262-73009-X}}, page xi&lt;/ref&gt;  He saw the first step in [[Self organization#Self-organization in cybernetics|self-organization]] as being to be able to copy the output behavior of a black box. Many other engineers, scientists and epistemologists, as [[Mario Bunge]],&lt;ref name="Bunge63"/&gt;  used and perfected the black box theory in the 1960s.

==System theory==
[[File:OpenSystemRepresentation.svg|thumb|252px|The ''[[Open system (systems theory)|open system theory]]'' is the foundation of ''black box theory''. Both have focus on input and output flows, representing exchanges with the surroundings.]]
The ''black box'' is an abstraction representing a class of concrete [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]] which can be viewed solely in terms of its ''stimuli inputs'' and ''output reactions'':
{{Quotation|The constitution and structure of the box are altogether irrelevant to the approach under consideration, which is purely external or phenomenological. In other words, only the behavior of the system will be accounted for.|[[Mario Bunge|Bunge]]&lt;ref name="Bunge63"&gt;Bunge, Mario; "A general black-box theory", Philosophy of Science, Vol. 30, No. 4, 1963, pp. 346-358. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/186066 jstor/186066]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The understanding of a ''black box'' is based on the "explanatory principle", the [[hypothesis]] of a [[causal relation]] between the ''input'' and the ''output'', and:&lt;ref name="gla09"&gt;Glanville, Ranulph; "Black Boxes", Cybernetics and Human Knowing, 2009, pp. 153-167.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''input'' and ''output'' being believed to be distinct,
* having observable (and relatable) inputs and outputs,
* being black to the observer (non-openable).

=== Recording of observed states ===
[[File:Hidrograma.png|thumb|252px|The observed [[hydrograph]] is a graphic of the response of a [[Drainage basin|watershed]] (a blackbox) with its [[Surface runoff|runoff]] (red) to an input of rainfall (blue).]]

An observer makes observations over time. All observations of inputs and outputs of a ''black box'' can be written in a table with the form:
{|border="1"
!↓Time
!States of input and output
|-
|...
|... ...
|-
|...
|... ...
|}

in which, at each of a sequence of times, the states of the ''box’s'' various parts, input and output, are recorded. Thus, using an example from [[William Ross Ashby|Ashby]], examining a box that has fallen from a [[flying saucer]] might lead to this protocol:&lt;ref name="ash56" /&gt;

{|border="1"
!↓Time
!States of input and output
|-
|11:18&amp;nbsp;a.m.
|I did nothing—the Box emitted a steady hum at 240&amp;nbsp;Hz.
|-
|11:19
|I pushed over the switch marked K: the note rose to 480&amp;nbsp;Hz and remained steady.
|-
|11:20
|I accidentally pushed the button marked “!”—the Box increased in temperature by 20&amp;nbsp;°C.
|-
|...
|... Etc.
|}
[[File:Blackbox3D-obs.png|thumb|252px|When the observer (an [[Multi-agent system|agent]]) can also do some stimulus (input), the relation with the black box is not only an observation, but an [[experiment]].]]

Thus every system, fundamentally, is investigated by the collection of a long protocol, drawn out in time, showing the sequence of input and output states. From this there follows the fundamental deduction that all knowledge obtainable from a Black Box (of given input and output) is such as can be obtained by re-coding the protocol (the ''observation table''); all that, and nothing more.&lt;ref name="ash56" /&gt;

If the observer also controls input, the investigation turns into an [[experiment]] (illustration), and hypotheses about [[Causality|cause and effect]] can be tested directly.

When the experimenter is also motivated to control the box, there is an active feedback in the box/observer relation, promoting what in [[Control system|control theory]] is called a [[Feed forward (control)|feed forward]] architecture.

===Modeling ===
The ''modeling process'' is the construction of a predictive [[mathematical model]], using existing historic data (observation table).

=== Testing the black box model===
A developed ''black box model'' is a validated model when ''[[black-box testing]]'' methods&lt;ref name="BS7925"&gt;See for ex. the British standard BS 7925-2 (Software component testing), or its 2001 work draft,&lt;br /&gt;BCS SIGIST (British Computer Society Specialist Interest Group in Software Testing), "Standard for Software Component Testing", Working Draft 3.4, 27 April 2001 [http://www.testingstandards.co.uk/bs_7925-2.htm webpage].&lt;/ref&gt; ensures that it is, based solely on [[Observation#Observation in science|observable]] elements.

With [[backtesting]], inputs for past events (not used in the "modeling effort") are entered into the model to see how well the output matches the known results.

==Other theories==
''Black box theories'' are things defined only in terms of their function.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/black-box-theory Definition from Answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1O98-blackboxtheory.html definition from highbeam]&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''black box theory'' is applied to any field, [[philosophy]] and [[science]] or otherwise where some inquiry or definition is made into the relations between the appearance of something (exterior/outside), i.e. here specifically the thing's black box state, related to its  characteristics and behaviour within (interior/inner).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new-science-theory.com/isaac-newton.html Black box theory applied briefly to Isaac Newton]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 374288 | volume=9 | issue=2 | title=What's inside the black box: a case study of allocative politics in the Hill-Burton program | journal=Int J Health Serv | pages=313–39 | last1 = Feshbach | first1 = D | doi=10.2190/ltd9-c9c7-x1lf-pmnm| year=1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, the inquiry is focused upon a thing that has no immediately apparent characteristics and therefore has only factors for consideration held within itself hidden from immediate observation. The observer is assumed ignorant in the first instance as the majority of available [[data]] is held in an inner situation away from [[wikt:facile|facile]] investigations. The ''black box'' element of the definition is shown as being characterised by a system where observable elements enter a perhaps imaginary box with a set of different outputs emerging which are also observable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/186066 Physics dept, Temple University, Philadelphia]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adoption in humanities ===
In [[Humanities|humanities disciplines]] such as [[philosophy of mind]] and [[behaviorism]], one of the uses of black box theory is to describe and understand [[psychological]] factors in fields such as marketing when applied to an analysis of [[consumer behaviour]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcbowles.com/courses/adv_dip/module12/chapter4/amc12_ch4_two.htm Institute for working futures] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626014001/http://www.marcbowles.com/courses/adv_dip/module12/chapter4/amc12_ch4_two.htm |date=26 June 2012 }} part of Advanced Diploma in Logistics and Management.

The ''black box theory of [[consciousness]]'' states that the [[mind]] is fully understood once the [[Information|inputs]] and outputs are well-defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.politicsprofessor.com/politicaltheories/black-box-model.php |title=the Professor network |access-date=6 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928220823/http://www.politicsprofessor.com/politicaltheories/black-box-model.php |archive-date=28 September 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- DROP non-soursed and generally couples this with a [[radical skepticism]] regarding the possibility of ever successfully describing the underlying structure, mechanism, and dynamics of the mind.{{clarify|date=May 2016}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} --&gt;

==Examples==
* In [[computer programming]] and [[software engineering]], ''[[black box testing]]'' is used to check that the output of a program is as expected, given certain inputs.&lt;ref&gt;Beizer, Boris; ''Black-Box Testing: Techniques for Functional Testing of Software and Systems'', 1995, {{ISBN|0-471-12094-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "black box" is used because the actual program being executed is not examined.
* In [[computing]] in general, a ''black box program'' is one where the user cannot see the inner workings (perhaps because it is a [[closed source]] program) or one which has no side effects and the function of which need not be examined, a routine suitable for re-use.
* Also in [[computing]], a black box refers to a piece of equipment provided by a vendor, for the purpose of using that vendor's product. It is often the case that the vendor maintains and supports this equipment, and the company receiving the black box typically is hands-off.
* In [[neural network]]ing or [[heuristic algorithm]]s (computer terms generally used to describe 'learning' computers or 'AI simulations'), a black box is used to describe the constantly changing section of the program environment which cannot easily be tested by the programmers. This is also called a [[White box (software engineering)|white box]] in the context that the program code can be seen, but the code is so complex that it is functionally equivalent to a black box.
* In [[physics]], a black box is a system whose internal structure is unknown, or need not be considered for a particular purpose.
* In [[mathematical model]]ing, a limiting case.
* In [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]], the school of [[behaviorism]] sees the human mind as a black box;&lt;ref name="FriSil06"&gt;"Mind as a Black Box: The Behaviorist Approach", pp. 85-88, in Friedenberg, Jay; and Silverman, Gordon; ''Cognitive Science: An Introduction to the Study of Mind'', Sage Publications, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; see ''[[#Other theories|other theories]]''.
* In [[neorealism in international relations|neorealist]] [[international relations theory]], the [[sovereign state]] is generally considered a black box: states are assumed to be unitary, [[homo economicus|rational, self-interested actors]], and the actual decision-making processes of the state are disregarded as being largely irrelevant. [[Liberalism in international relations|Liberal]] and [[constructivism in international relations|constructivist]] theorists often criticize neorealism for the "black box" model, and refer to much of their work on how states arrive at decisions as "breaking open the black box".
* In [[cryptography]] to capture the notion of knowledge obtained by an algorithm through the execution of a [[cryptographic protocol]] such as a [[zero-knowledge proof]] protocol. If the output of an algorithm when interacting with the protocol matches that of a simulator given some inputs, it 'need not know' anything more than those inputs.

''Black Box theory'' is, however, even wider in application than these professional studies:

{{Quotation|The child who tries to open a door has to manipulate the handle (the input) so as to produce the desired movement at the latch (the output); and he has to learn how to control the one by the other without being able to see the internal mechanism that links them. In our daily lives we are confronted at every turn with systems whose internal mechanisms are not fully open to inspection, and which must be treated by the methods appropriate to the Black Box.|Ashby&lt;ref name="ash56" /&gt;}}

{{Quotation|(...) This simple rule proved very effective and is an illustration of how the Black Box principle in cybernetics can be used to control situations that, if gone into deeply, may seem very complex. &lt;br&gt;A further example of the Black Box principle is the treatment of mental patients. The human brain is certainly a Black Box, and while a great deal of neurological research is going on to understand the mechanism of the brain, progress in treatment is also being made by observing patients' responses to stimuli.|Duckworth, Gear and Lockett&lt;ref&gt;WE Duckworth, AE Gear and AG Lockett (1977), "A Guide to Operational Research". {{DOI|10.1007/978-94-011-6910-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Other uses of the term==
* In [[aviation]], the [[flight recorder]] is often called a "black box", especially by the media, although it is usually bright orange to facilitate its discovery after a crash. In an [[airplane]] or [[helicopter]], the flight recorder consists of two independent devices that are usually combined in a single unit. The flight [[data recorder]] logs information about controls and sensors, and the [[cockpit]] voice recorder preserves the most recent sounds in the cockpit, including conversation of the pilots. If an accident happens, investigators can use the recordings to assist in the investigation.
** Similarly, the [[train event recorder]] in [[rail transport]] and the [[voyage data recorder]] in maritime transport are often called "black boxes".
* In [[amateur radio]] the term "black box operator" is a disparaging or self-deprecating description of someone who operates factory-made radios without having a good understanding of how they work. Such operators do not build their own equipment (an activity called "homebrewing") or repair their own "black boxes".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.g3ngd.talktalk.net/1950.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Kenneth J. Gergen]] describes civil discourse as "the language of dispassionate objectivity", and suggests that it requires respect of the other participants, such as the reader. It neither diminishes the other's moral worth, nor questions their good judgment; it avoids hostility, direct antagonism, or excessive persuasion; it requires modesty and an appreciation for the other participant's experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kenneth J.

'''Classical conditioning''' (also known as '''Pavlovian''' or '''respondent conditioning''') refers to a [[learning]] procedure in which a biologically potent [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] (e.g. food) is paired with a previously neutral stimulus (e.g. a bell). It also refers to the learning process that results from this pairing, through which the neutral stimulus comes to elicit a response (e.g. salivation) that is usually similar to the one elicited by the potent stimulus. These basic facts, which require many qualifications (see below), were first studied in detail by [[Ivan Pavlov]] through [[experiment]]s with dogs.  Together with [[operant conditioning]], classical conditioning became the foundation of [[behaviorism]], a school of [[psychology]] which was dominant in the mid-20th century and is still an important influence on the practice of [[Psychotherapy|psychological therapy]] and the study of animal behavior. Classical conditioning is a basic learning process, and its [[neural substrate]]s are now beginning to be understood.

==Definition==
Classical conditioning occurs when a conditioned stimulus (CS) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US). Usually, the conditioned stimulus is a neutral stimulus (e.g., the sound of a tuning fork), the unconditioned stimulus is biologically potent (e.g., the taste of food) and the unconditioned response (UR) to the unconditioned stimulus is an unlearned [[reflex]] response (e.g., salivation). After pairing is repeated the organism exhibits a conditioned response (CR) to the conditioned stimulus when the conditioned stimulus is presented alone. (A conditioned response may occur after only one pairing.) Thus, unlike the UR, the CR is acquired through experience, and it is also less permanent than the UR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://psychology.about.com/od/cindex/g/condresp.htm |title= What Is a Conditioned Response? |first= Kendra |last= Cherry |work= About.com Guide |publisher= [[About.com]] |location= |accessdate= 2013-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually the conditioned response is similar to the unconditioned response, but sometimes it is quite different. For this and other reasons, most learning theorists suggest that the conditioned stimulus comes to signal or predict the unconditioned stimulus, and go on to analyze the consequences of this signal.&lt;ref name="Shet"&gt;Shettleworth, Sara J.(2010) ''Cognition, Evolution, and Behavior (2nd edn)'' Oxford Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert A. Rescorla]] provided a clear summary of this change in thinking, and its implications, in his 1988 article "Pavlovian conditioning: It's not what you think it is".&lt;ref name="Rescorla1988"&gt;Rescorla, Robert A. [http://www.stanford.edu/class/psych227/RESCORLA%20(1988).pdf Pavlovian Conditioning — It's Not What You Think It Is]. (1988) ''[[American Psychologist]]'', ''43'', 151–160.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its widespread acceptance, Rescorla's thesis may not be defensible.&lt;ref&gt;Papini, M. R., &amp; Bitterman, M. E. (1990). The role of contingency in classical conditioning. ''[[Psychological Review]]'', ''97''(3), 396-403.&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical conditioning differs from [[Operant conditioning|''operant'' or ''instrumental'' conditioning]]: in classical conditioning, behaviors are modified through the association of stimuli as described above, whereas in operant conditioning behaviors are modified by the effect they produce (i.e., reward or punishment).&lt;ref name = "Bouton"&gt;Bouton, M. E. (2016) ''Learning and Behavior: A Contemporary Synthesis (2nd ed)'', Sunderland, MA: Sinauer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedures==

===Pavlov's research===
The best-known and most thorough early work on classical conditioning was done by [[Ivan Pavlov]], although [[Edwin Twitmyer]] published some related findings a year earlier.&lt;ref name = "Pavlov"&gt;Pavlov, I. P. (1927/1960). ''Conditional Reflexes''. New York: Dover Publications (the 1960 edition is not an unaltered republication of the 1927 translation by Oxford University Press http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Pavlov/).&lt;/ref&gt; During his research on the physiology of digestion in dogs, Pavlov developed a procedure that enabled him to study the digestive processes of animals over long periods of time. He redirected the animal's digestive fluids outside the body, where they could be measured. Pavlov noticed that his dogs began to salivate in the presence of the technician who normally fed them, rather than simply salivating in the presence of food. Pavlov called the dogs' anticipatory salivation "psychic secretion". Putting these informal observations to an experimental test, Pavlov presented a stimulus (e.g. the sound of a metronome) and then gave the dog food; after a few repetitions, the dogs started to salivate in response to the stimulus. Pavlov concluded that if a particular stimulus in the dog's surroundings was present when the dog was given food then that stimulus could become associated with food and cause salivation on its own.

===Terminology===
In Pavlov's experiments the '''unconditioned stimulus (US)''' was the dog food because its effects did not depend on previous experience.  The metronome's sound is originally a '''neutral stimulus  NS''' because it does not elicit salivation in the dogs.  After conditioning, the metronome's sound becomes the '''conditioned stimulus (CS)'' or conditional stimulus; because its effects depend on its association with food.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas L. Medin, Brian H. Ross, and Arthur B. Markmen. ''Cognitive Psychology''. N.p.:n.p,2009. Print 50–53&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the responses of the dog follow the same conditioned-versus-unconditioned arrangement.  The '''conditioned response (CR)''' is the response to the conditioned stimulus, whereas the '''unconditioned response (UR)''' corresponds to the unconditioned stimulus.

Pavlov reported many basic facts about conditioning; for example, he found that learning occurred most rapidly when the interval between the CS and the appearance of the US was relatively short.&lt;ref&gt;T.L. Brink (2008) Psychology: A Student Friendly Approach. [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/TLBrink_PSYCH06.pdf "Unit 6: Learning."] pp.&amp;nbsp;97–98&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted earlier, it is often thought that the conditioned response is a replica of the unconditioned response, but Pavlov noted that saliva produced by the CS differs in composition from that produced by the US. In fact, the CR may be any new response to the previously neutral CS that can be clearly linked to experience with the conditional relationship of CS and US.&lt;ref name=Rescorla1988/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bouton"/&gt; It was also thought that repeated pairings are necessary for conditioning to emerge, but many CRs can be learned with a single trial, especially in [[fear conditioning]] and [[taste aversion]] learning.

[[Image:delay,trace conditioning.svg|thumb|right|384px|Diagram representing forward conditioning. The time interval increases from left to right.]]

===Forward conditioning===
Learning is fastest in forward conditioning. During forward conditioning, the onset of the CS precedes the onset of the US in order to signal that the US will follow.&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;Chang, Raymond C.; Stout, Steven; Miller, Ralph R. [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raymond_Chang/publication/8945976_Comparing_excitatory_backward_and_forward_conditioning/links/5404a9f60cf23d9765a6919f.pdf "Comparing excitatory backward and forward conditioning."] ''Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology: Section B'' January 2004. Vol. 57 Issue 1, pp. 1–23. State University of New York at Binghamton, New York, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chance, Paul. Learning and Behavior. Belmont/CA: Wadsworth, {{ISBN|0-495-09564-8}}, 2008. Print. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Two common forms of forward conditioning are delay and trace conditioning.

* '''Delay conditioning''': In delay conditioning, the CS is presented and is overlapped by the presentation of the US. For example, if a person hears a buzzer for five seconds, during which time air is puffed into their eye, the person will blink. After several pairings of the buzzer and the puff, the person will blink at the sound of the buzzer alone. This is delay conditioning.
* '''Trace conditioning''': During trace conditioning, the CS and US do not overlap. Instead, the CS begins and ends before the US is presented. The stimulus-free period is called the ''trace interval'' or the ''conditioning interval''. If in the above buzzer example, the puff came a second after the sound of the buzzer stopped, that would be trace conditioning, with a trace or conditioning interval of one second.
[[File:Forward Conditioning.svg]]

===Simultaneous conditioning===
[[File:Classical Conditioning.svg|thumb|Classical conditioning procedures and effects]]

During simultaneous conditioning, the CS and US are presented and terminated at the same time. For example: If a person hears a bell and has air puffed into their eye at the same time, and repeated pairings like this lead to the person blinking when they hear the bell despite the puff of air being absent, this demonstrates that simultaneous conditioning has occurred.

[[File:Simultaneous Conditioning.svg]]

===Second-order and higher-order conditioning===
{{main|Second-order conditioning}}
Second-order or higher-order conditioning follow a two-step procedure. First a neutral stimulus ("CS1") comes to signal a US through forward conditioning. Then a second neutral stimulus ("CS2") is paired with the first (CS1) and comes to yield its own conditioned response.&lt;ref&gt;Chance, Paul. ''Learning and Behavior''. Belmont/CA: Wadsworth, {{ISBN|0-495-09564-8}}, 2008. Print. p.66&lt;/ref&gt; For example: A bell might be paired with food until the bell elicits salivation. If a light is then paired with the bell, then the light may come to elicit salivation as well. The bell is the CS1 and the food is the US. The light becomes the CS2 once it is paired with the CS1.

[[File:Second Order Conditioning.svg]]

===Backward conditioning===
Backward conditioning occurs when a CS immediately follows a US.&lt;ref name="Chang"/&gt; Unlike the usual conditioning procedure, in which the CS precedes the US, the conditioned response given to the CS tends to be inhibitory. This presumably happens because the CS serves as a signal that the US has ended, rather than as a signal that the US is about to appear.&lt;ref&gt;Chance, Paul. ''Learning and Behavior''. Belmont/CA: Wadsworth, {{ISBN|0-495-09564-8}}, 2008. Print. pp.71&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a puff of air directed at a person's eye could be followed by the sound of a buzzer.

===Temporal conditioning===
In temporal conditioning, a US is presented at regular intervals, for instance every 10 minutes. Conditioning is said to have occurred when the CR tends to occur shortly before each US. This suggests that animals have a biological clock that can serve as a CS. This method has also been used to study timing ability in animals (see [[Animal cognition]]).

The example below shows the temporal conditioning, as US such as food to a hungry mouse is simply delivered on a regular time schedule such as every thirty seconds. After sufficient exposure the mouse will begin to salivate just before the food delivery. This then makes it temporal conditioning as it would appear that the mouse is conditioned to the passage of time. (see [[Basic Principle of Learning]]).
[[File:Temporal Conditioning.svg]]

===Zero contingency procedure===
In this procedure, the CS is paired with the US, but the US also occurs at other times. If this occurs, it is predicted that the US is likely to happen in the absence of the CS. In other words, the CS does not "predict" the US. In this case, conditioning fails and the CS does not come to elicit a CR.&lt;ref&gt;Rescorla, R. A. (1967). [http://www.uk.sagepub.com/upm-data/23600_Ch_1.pdf Pavlovian conditioning and its proper control procedures].  ''Psychological Review'', 74, 71–80&lt;/ref&gt; This finding – that ''prediction'' rather than CS-US pairing is the key to conditioning – greatly influenced subsequent conditioning research and theory.

===Extinction===
{{main|Extinction (psychology)}}
In the extinction procedure, the CS is presented repeatedly in the absence of a US. This is done after a CS has been conditioned by one of the methods above. When this is done, the CR frequency eventually returns to pre-training levels. However, extinction does not completely eliminate the effects of the prior conditioning. This is demonstrated by [[spontaneous recovery]] – when there is a sudden appearance of the (CR) after extinction occurs – and other related phenomena (see "Recovery from extinction" below). These phenomena can be explained by postulating accumulation of inhibition when a weak stimulus is presented.

==Phenomena observed==

===Acquisition===
During acquisition, the CS and US are paired as described above. The extent of conditioning may be tracked by test trials. In these test trials, the CS is presented alone and the CR is measured. A single CS-US pairing may suffice to yield a CR on a test, but usually a number of pairings are necessary and there is a gradual increase in the conditioned response to the CS. This repeated number of trials increase the strength and/or frequency of the CR gradually. The speed of conditioning depends on a number of factors, such as the nature and strength of both the CS and the US, previous experience and the animal's [[motivation]]al state.&lt;ref name="Shet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bouton"/&gt; The process slows down as it nears completion.&lt;ref name="Schacter 2009 267"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Daniel L|title=PSYCHOLOGY|year=2009|publisher=Catherine Woods|isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extinction===
If the CS is presented without the US, and this process is repeated continuously, the CS will eventually stop eliciting a CR. This means that the CR has been "extinguished".&lt;ref name = Shet/&gt; This occurs due to a temporal sensitive relationship between the US and CS. The cessation or long temporal delay of CS-US pairing results in a learned decision to stop responding to a CS since there is a sufficient change in the rate at which the CS is being reinforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chan|first=C. K. J.|last2=Harris|first2=Justin A.|date=2017-08-01|title=Extinction of Pavlovian conditioning: The influence of trial number and reinforcement history|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376635717301961|journal=Behavioural Processes|series=SQAB 2016: Persistence and Relapse|volume=141|issue=Part 1|pages=19–25|doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2017.04.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 [[File:Classical conditioning - extinction.svg]]

===External inhibition===
[[External inhibition]] may be observed if a strong or unfamiliar stimulus is presented just before, or at the same time as, the CS. This causes a reduction in the conditioned response to the CS.

===Recovery from extinction===
Several procedures lead to the recovery of a CR that had been first conditioned and then extinguished. This illustrates that the extinction procedure does not completely eliminate the effect of conditioning.&lt;ref name = "Bouton"/&gt; These procedures are the following:
* Reacquisition: If the CS is again paired with the US, a CR is again acquired, but this second acquisition usually happens much faster than the first one.
* [[Spontaneous recovery]]: Spontaneous recovery is defined as the reappearance of a previously extinguished conditioned response after a rest period. That is, if the CS is tested at a later time (for example an hour or a day) after extinction it will again elicit a CR. This renewed CR is usually much weaker than the CR observed prior to extinction.
* [[Disinhibition#Associative learning concept|Disinhibition]]: If the CS is tested just after extinction and an intense but associatively neutral stimulus has occurred, there may be a temporary recovery of the conditioned response to the CS.
* Reinstatement: If the US used in conditioning is presented to a subject in the same place where conditioning and extinction occurred, but without the CS being present, the CS often elicits a response when it is tested later.
* Renewal: Renewal is a reemergence of a conditioned response following extinction when an animal is returned to the environment in which the conditioned response was acquired.

===Stimulus generalization===
''Stimulus generalization'' is said to occur if, after a particular CS has come to elicit a CR, another similar stimulus will elicit the same CR. Usually the more similar the CS and the test stimulus are, the stronger the CR to the test stimulus.&lt;ref name = Shet/&gt; The more the test stimulus differs from the CS, the weaker the CR will be, or the more it will differ from that previously observed.

===Stimulus discrimination===
One observes ''stimulus discrimination'' when one stimulus ("CS1") elicits one CR and another stimulus ("CS2") elicits either another CR or no CR at all. This can be brought about by, for example, pairing CS1 with an effective US and presenting CS2 with no US.&lt;ref name = Shet/&gt;

===Latent inhibition===
{{main|Latent inhibition}}
Latent inhibition refers to the observation that it takes longer for a familiar stimulus to become a CS than it does for a novel stimulus to become a CS, when the stimulus is subsequently paired with an effective US.&lt;ref name = Shet/&gt;

===Conditioned suppression===
This is one of the most common ways to measure the strength of learning in classical conditioning. A typical example of this procedure is as follows: a rat first learns to press a lever through [[operant conditioning]].  Then, in a series of trials, the rat is exposed to a CS, a light or a noise, followed by the US, a mild electric shock.  An association between the CS and US develops, and the rat slows or stops its lever pressing when the CS comes on. The rate of pressing during the CS measures the strength of classical conditioning; that is, the slower the rat presses, the stronger the association of the CS and the US. (Slow pressing indicates a "fear" conditioned response, and it is an example of a conditioned emotional response; see section below.)

===Conditioned inhibition===
Typically, three phases of conditioning are used.

====Phase 1====
A CS (CS+) is paired with a US until asymptotic CR levels are reached.

====Phase 2====
CS+/US trials are continued, but these are interspersed with trials on which the CS+ is paired with a second CS, (the CS-) but not with the US (i.e. CS+/CS- trials).  Typically, organisms show CRs on CS+/US trials, but stop responding on CS+/CS− trials.

====Phase 3====
* ''Summation test for conditioned inhibition:'' The CS- from phase 2 is presented together with a new CS+ that was conditioned as in phase 1. Conditioned inhibition is found if the response is less to the CS+/CS- pair than it is to the CS+ alone.
* ''Retardation test for conditioned inhibition:'' The CS- from phase 2 is paired with the US. If conditioned inhibition has occurred, the rate of acquisition to the previous CS− should be less than the rate of acquisition that would be found without the phase 2 treatment.

===Blocking===
{{main|Blocking effect}}
This form of classical conditioning involves two phases.

====Phase 1====
A CS (CS1) is paired with a US.

====Phase 2====
A compound CS (CS1+CS2) is paired with a US.

====Test====
A separate test for each CS (CS1 and CS2) is performed. The blocking effect is observed in a lack of conditional response to CS2, suggesting that the first phase of training blocked the acquisition of the second CS.

[[File:Classical conditioning - blocking.svg]]

==Theories==

===Data sources===

Experiments on theoretical issues in conditioning have mostly been done on vertebrates, especially rats and pigeons. However, conditioning has also been studied in invertebrates, and very important data on the neural basis of conditioning has come from experiments on the sea slug, ''Aplysia''.&lt;ref&gt;Shettleworth, S. J. (2010) ''Cognition, Evolution and Behavior'' (2nd Ed), New York: Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most relevant experiments have used the classical conditioning procedure, although [[Operant conditioning|instrumental (operant) conditioning]] experiments have also been used, and the strength of classical conditioning is often measured through its operant effects, as in ''conditioned suppression'' (see Phenomena section above) and [[Shaping (psychology)|autoshaping]].

===Stimulus-substitution theory===
{{further|Counterconditioning}}
According to Pavlov, conditioning does not involve the acquisition of any new behavior, but rather the tendency to respond in old ways to new stimuli. Thus, he theorized that the CS merely substitutes for the US in evoking the reflex response. This explanation is called the stimulus-substitution theory of conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Chance, Paul. ''Learning and Behavior''. Belmont/CA: Wadsworth, {{ISBN|0-495-09564-8}}, 2008. Print. p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; A critical problem with the stimulus-substitution theory is that the CR and UR are not always the same. Pavlov himself observed that a dog's saliva produced as a CR differed in composition from that produced as a UR.&lt;ref name="Pavlov"/&gt; The CR is sometimes even the opposite of the UR. For example: the unconditional response to electric shock is an increase in heart rate, whereas a CS that has been paired with the electric shock elicits a decrease in heart rate. (However, it has been proposed that only when the UR does not involve the [[central nervous system]] are the CR and the UR opposites.)

===Rescorla–Wagner model===
{{main|Rescorla–Wagner model}}

The Rescorla–Wagner (R–W) model&lt;ref name="Bouton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rescorla,  R. A. &amp; A. R. Wagner (1972). A theory of Pavlovan conditioning: Variations in the effectiveness of reinforcement and nonreinforcement.  In ''Classical Conditioning II: Current Theory and Research'' Black &amp; Prokasy (eds), pp. 64–99. New York: Appleton-Century.&lt;/ref&gt;  is a relatively simple yet powerful model of conditioning.  The model predicts a number of important phenomena, but it also fails in important ways, thus leading to a number of modifications and alternative models.  However, because much of the theoretical research on conditioning in the past 40 years has been instigated by this model or reactions to it, the R–W model deserves a brief description here.&lt;ref name = "M&amp;E"&gt;Miller, R. &amp; M. Escobar ''Learning: Laws and Models of Basic Conditioning''.  In ''Stevens' Handbook of Experimental Psychology'',(3rd Edition)  Vol 3: Learning, Motivation &amp; Emotion, Pashler &amp; Gallistel, (eds) pp 47–102, New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chance, Paul. ''Learning and Behavior''. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, {{ISBN|0-495-09564-8}}, 2008. Print. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rescorla-Wagner model argues that there is a limit to the amount of conditioning that can occur in the pairing of two stimuli. One determinant of this limit is the nature of the US. For example: pairing a bell with a juicy steak is more likely to produce salivation than pairing the bell with a piece of dry bread, and dry bread is likely to work better than a piece of cardboard.  A key idea behind the R–W model is that a CS signals or predicts the US. One might say that before conditioning, the subject is surprised by the US. However, after conditioning, the subject is no longer surprised, because the CS predicts the coming of the US. (Note that the model can be described mathematically and that words like predict, surprise, and expect are only used to help explain the model.) Here the workings of the model are illustrated with brief accounts of acquisition, extinction, and blocking.  The model also predicts a number of other phenomena, see main article on the model.

==== Equation ====
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\Delta V=\alpha\beta (\lambda - \Sigma V)&lt;/math&gt;

This is the Rescorla-Wagner equation. It specifies the amount of learning that will occur on a single pairing of a conditioning stimulus (CS) with an unconditioned stimulus (US). The above equation is solved repeatedly to predict the course of learning over many such trials.

In this model the degree of learning is measured by how well the CS predicts the US, which is given by the "associative strength" of the CS. In the equation, V represents the current associative strength of the CS, and ∆V is the change in this strength that happens on a given trial. ΣV is the sum of the strengths of all stimuli present in the situation. λ is the maximum associative strength that a given US will support; its value is usually set to 1 on trials when the US is present, and 0 when the US is absent. α and β are constants related to the salience of the CS and the speed of learning for a given US. How the equation predicts various experimental results is explained in following sections.  For further details, see the main article on the model.&lt;ref&gt;Chance, Paul. ''Learning and Behavior''. Belmont/CA: Wadsworth, {{ISBN|0-495-09564-8}}, 2008. Print pp 85–89&lt;/ref&gt;

====R–W model: acquisition====
The R–W model measures conditioning by assigning an "associative strength" to the CS and other local stimuli.  Before a CS is conditioned it has an associative strength of zero. Pairing the CS and the US causes a gradual increase in the associative strength of the CS. This increase is determined by the nature of the US (e.g. its intensity).&lt;ref name="Chance, Paul 2008. pp. 85-89"&gt;Chance, Paul. ''Learning and Behavior''. Belmont/CA: Wadsworth, {{ISBN|0-495-09564-8}}, 2008. Print. pp. 85–89&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of learning that happens during any single CS-US pairing depends on the difference between the total associative strengths of CS and other stimuli present in the situation (ΣV in the equation), and a maximum set by the US (λ in the equation). On the first pairing of the CS and US, this difference is large and the associative strength of the CS takes a big step up. As CS-US pairings accumulate, the US becomes more predictable, and the increase in associative strength on each trial becomes smaller and smaller.  Finally the difference between the associative strength of the CS (plus any that may accrue to other stimuli) and the maximum strength reaches zero. That is, the US is fully predicted, the associative strength of the CS stops growing, and conditioning is complete.

====R–W model: extinction====
The associative process described by the R–W model also accounts for extinction (see "procedures" above).  The extinction procedure starts with a positive associative strength of the CS, which means that the CS predicts that the US will occur.  On an extinction trial the US fails to occur after the CS.  As a result of this “surprising” outcome, the associative strength of the CS takes a step down. Extinction is complete when the strength of the CS reaches zero; no US is predicted, and no US occurs. However, if that same CS is presented without the US but accompanied by a well-established conditioned inhibitor (CI), that is, a stimulus that predicts the absence of a US (in R-W terms, a stimulus with a negative associate strength) then R-W predicts that the CS will not undergo extinction (its V will not decrease in size).

====R–W model: blocking====
{{main|Blocking effect}}
The most important and novel contribution of the R–W model is its assumption that the conditioning of a CS depends not just on that CS alone, and its relationship to the US, but also on all other stimuli present in the conditioning situation.  In particular, the model states that the US is predicted by the sum of the associative strengths of all stimuli present in the conditioning situation.  Learning is controlled by the difference between this total associative strength and the strength supported by the US. When this sum of strengths reaches a maximum set by the US, conditioning ends as just described.&lt;ref name="Chance, Paul 2008. pp. 85-89"/&gt;

The R–W explanation of the blocking phenomenon illustrates one consequence of the assumption just stated.  In blocking (see "phenomena" above), CS1 is paired with a US until conditioning is complete. Then on additional conditioning trials a second stimulus (CS2) appears together with CS1, and both are followed by the US.  Finally CS2 is tested and shown to produce no response because learning about CS2 was “blocked” by the initial learning about CS1.  The R–W model explains this by saying that after the initial conditioning, CS1 fully predicts the US.  Since there is no difference between what is predicted and what happens, no new learning happens on the additional trials with CS1+CS2, hence CS2 later yields no response.

===Theoretical issues and alternatives to the Rescorla–Wagner model===
One of the main reasons for the importance of the R–W model is that it is relatively simple and makes clear predictions.  Tests of these predictions have led to a number of important new findings and a considerably increased understanding of conditioning.  Some new information has supported the theory, but much has not, and it is generally agreed that the theory is, at best, too simple. However, no single model seems to account for all the phenomena that experiments have produced.&lt;ref name = "Bouton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, R. R., Barnet, R. C. &amp; Grahame, N. J. (1995) Assessment of the Rescorla–Wagner model. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 117, 363–386&lt;/ref&gt;   Following are brief summaries of some related theoretical issues.&lt;ref name="M&amp;E"/&gt;

====Content of learning====
The R–W model reduces conditioning to the association of a CS and US, and measures this with a single number, the associative strength of the CS.  A number of experimental findings indicate that more is learned than this. Among these are two phenomena described earlier in this article
* Latent inhibition:  If a subject is repeatedly exposed to the CS before conditioning starts, then conditioning takes longer.  The R–W model cannot explain this because preexposure leaves the strength of the CS unchanged at zero.
* Recovery of responding after extinction:  It appears that something remains after extinction has reduced associative strength to zero because several procedures cause responding to reappear without further conditioning.&lt;ref name = "Bouton"/&gt;

====Role of attention in learning====
Latent inhibition might happen because a subject stops focusing on a CS that is seen frequently before it is paired with a US.  In fact, changes in attention to the CS are at the heart of two prominent theories that try to cope with experimental results that give the R–W model difficulty.  In one of these, proposed by [[Nicholas Mackintosh]],&lt;ref&gt;Mackintosh, N. J. (1975) A theory of attention: Variations in the associability of stimuli with reinforcement  ''Psychological Review'', 82, 276–298&lt;/ref&gt; the speed of conditioning depends on the amount of attention devoted to the CS, and this amount of attention depends in turn on how well the CS predicts the US.  Pearce and Hall proposed a related model based on a different attentional principle&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, J. M. &amp; Hall, G. (1980) [http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~elliot/PearceHall1980_PsychReview.pdf A model for Pavlovian learning: Variations in the effectiveness of conditioned but not of unconditioned stimuli] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407081232/http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~elliot/PearceHall1980_PsychReview.pdf |date=2014-04-07 }}. ''Psychological Review'', 87, 532–552.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both models have been extensively tested, and neither explains all the experimental results. Consequently, various authors have attempted hybrid models that combine the two attentional processes. Pearce and Hall in 2010 integrated their attentional ideas and even suggested the possibility of incorporating the Rescorla-Wagner equation into an integrated model.&lt;ref name="Bouton"/&gt;

====Context====
As stated earlier, a key idea in conditioning is that the CS signals or predicts the US  (see "zero contingency procedure" above).  However, for example, the room in which conditioning takes place also "predicts" that the US may occur. Still, the room predicts with much less certainty than does the experimental CS itself, because the room is also there between experimental trials, when the US is absent. The role of such context is illustrated by the fact that the dogs in Pavlov's experiment would sometimes start salivating as they approached the experimental apparatus, before they saw or heard any CS.&lt;ref name="Schacter 2009 267"/&gt; Such so-called "context" stimuli are always present, and their influence helps to account for some otherwise puzzling experimental findings. The associative strength of context stimuli can be entered into the Rescorla-Wagner equation, and they play an important role in the ''comparator'' and ''computational'' theories outlined below.&lt;ref name = "Bouton"/&gt;

====Comparator theory====
To find out what has been learned, we must somehow measure behavior ("performance") in a test situation. However, as students know all too well, performance in a test situation is not always a good measure of what has been learned.  As for conditioning, there is evidence that subjects in a blocking experiment do learn something about the "blocked" CS, but fail to show this learning because of the way that they are usually tested.

"Comparator" theories of conditioning are "performance based", that is, they stress what is going on at the time of the test.  In particular, they look at all the stimuli that are present during testing and at how the associations acquired by these stimuli may interact.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, J. &amp; Balsam P. (1981) Spreading association in time.  In Locurto, Terrace &amp; Gibbon (Eds.), ''Autoshaping and conditioning theory'' (pp. 219–235). New York: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, R. R. &amp; Escobar, M. (2001) [http://faculty.oxy.edu/clint/learn/articles/contrastingacquisitionfocusedandperformancefocusedmodelsofacquiredbehavior.pdf Contrasting acquisition-focused and performance-focused models of acquired behavior]. ''Current Directions in Psychological Science'' 10, 141–145.&lt;/ref&gt;  To oversimplify somewhat, comparator theories assume that during conditioning the subject acquires both CS-US and context-US associations. At the time of the test, these associations are compared, and a response to the CS occurs only if the CS-US association is stronger than the context-US association. After a CS and US are repeatedly paired in simple acquisition, the CS-US association is strong and the context-US association is relatively weak. This means that the CS elicits a strong CR. In “zero contingency” (see above), the conditioned response is weak or absent because the context-US association is about as strong as the CS-US association. Blocking and other more subtle phenomena can also be explained by comparator theories, though, again, they cannot explain everything.&lt;ref name="Bouton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M&amp;E"/&gt;

====Computational theory====
An organism's need to predict future events is central to modern theories of conditioning. Most theories use associations between stimuli to take care of these predictions. For example: In the R–W model, the associative strength of a CS tells us how strongly that CS predicts a US. A different approach to prediction is suggested by models such as that proposed by Gallistel &amp; Gibbon (2000, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Gallistel, R. &amp; Gibbon, J. (2000). [http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/faculty/GnG/Gal&amp;Gib_Preprint.pdf Time, rate and conditioning]. ''Psychological Review'', 107, 289–304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallistel, R. &amp; Gibbon, J. (2002) ''The Symbolic Foundations of Conditioned Behavior''. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; Here the response is not determined by associative strengths.  Instead, the organism records the times of onset and offset of CSs and USs and uses these to calculate the probability that the US will follow the CS. A number of experiments have shown that humans and animals can learn to time events (see [[Animal cognition]]), and the Gallistel &amp; Gibbon model yields very good quantitative fits to a variety of experimental data.&lt;ref name = "Shet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M&amp;E"/&gt; However, recent studies have suggested that duration-based models cannot account for some empirical findings as well as associative models.&lt;ref&gt;Golkar, A., Bellander, M., &amp; Öhman, A. (2013). Temporal properties of fear extinction--does time matter? "Behavioral neuroscience", 127(1), 59–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Element-based models====
The Rescorla-Wagner model treats a stimulus as a single entity, and it represents the associative strength of a stimulus with one number, with no record of how that number was reached.  As noted above, this makes it hard for the model to account for a number of experimental results.  More flexibility is provided by assuming that a stimulus is internally represented by a collection of elements, each of which may change from one associative state to another. For example, the similarity of one stimulus to another may be represented by saying that the two stimuli share elements in common.  These shared elements help to account for stimulus generalization and other phenomena that may depend upon generalization.  Also, different elements within the same set may have different associations, and their activations and associations may change at different times and at different rates.  This allows element-based models to handle some otherwise inexplicable results.

=====The SOP model=====
A prominent example of the element approach is the “SOP” model of Wagner.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, A. R. (1981). SOP: A model of automatic memory processing in animal behavior.  In Spear &amp; Miller (Eds.) Information processing in animals: Memory mechanisms (pp.5-47). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt;  The model has been elaborated in various ways since its introduction, and it can now account in principle for a very wide variety of experimental findings.&lt;ref name="Bouton"/&gt;  The model represents any given stimulus with a large collection of elements. The time of presentation of various stimuli, the state of their elements, and the interactions between the elements, all determine the course of associative processes and the behaviors observed during conditioning experiments.

The SOP account of simple conditioning exemplifies some essentials of the SOP model.  To begin with, the model assumes that the CS and US are each represented by a large group of elements. Each of these stimulus elements can be in one of three states: 
* primary activity (A1)  - Roughly speaking, the stimulus is  “attended to.”  (References to “attention” are intended only to aid understanding and are not part of the model.)
* secondary activity (A2)  -  The stimulus is “peripherally attended to.”
* inactive (I) – The stimulus is “not attended to.”
Of the elements that represent a single stimulus at a given moment, some may be in state A1, some in state A2, and some in state I.

When a stimulus first appears, some of its elements jump from inactivity I to primary activity A1. From the A1 state they gradually decay to A2, and finally back to I.  Element activity can only change in this way; in particular, elements in A2 cannot go directly back to A1.  If the elements of both the CS and the US are in the A1 state at the same time, an association is learned between the two stimuli.  This means that if, at a later time, the CS is presented ahead of the US, and some CS elements enter A1, these elements will activate some US elements.  However, US elements activated indirectly in this way only get boosted to the A2 state.  (This can be thought of the CS arousing a memory of the US, which will not be as strong as the real thing.)   With repeated CS-US trials, more and more elements are associated, and more and more US elements go to A2 when the CS comes on. This gradually leaves fewer and fewer US elements that can enter A1 when the US itself appears. In consequence, learning slows down and approaches a limit. One might say that the US is “fully predicted” or “not surprising” because almost all of its elements can only enter A2 when the CS comes on, leaving few to form new associations.

The model can explain the findings that are accounted for by the Rescorla-Wagner model and a number of additional findings as well.  For example, unlike most other models, SOP takes time into account. The rise and decay of element activation enables the model to explain time-dependent effects such as the fact that conditioning is strongest when the CS comes just before the US, and that when the CS comes after the US  (“backward conditioning”) the result is often an inhibitory CS.  Many other more subtle phenomena are explained as well.&lt;ref name="Bouton"/&gt;
 
A number of other powerful models have appeared in recent years which incorporate element representations.  These often include the assumption that associations involve a network of connections between “nodes” that represent stimuli, responses, and perhaps one or more “hidden” layers of intermediate interconnections.  Such models make contact with a current explosion of research on [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]], [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]].

==Applications==

===Neural basis of learning and memory===

Pavlov proposed that conditioning involved a connection between brain centers for conditioned and unconditioned stimuli. His physiological account of conditioning has been abandoned, but classical conditioning continues to be to study the neural structures and functions that underlie learning and memory. Forms of classical conditioning that are used for this purpose include, among others, [[fear conditioning]], [[eyeblink conditioning]], and the foot contraction conditioning of ''[[Hermissenda crassicornis]]'', a sea-slug. Both fear and eyeblink conditioning involve a neutral stimulus, frequently a tone, becoming paired with an unconditioned stimulus.  In the case of eyeblink conditioning, the US is an air-puff, while in fear conditioning the US is threatening or aversive such as a foot shock.

"Available data demonstrate that discrete regions of the cerebellum and associated brainstem areas contain neurons that alter their activity during conditioning – these regions are critical for the acquisition and performance of this simple learning task. It appears that other regions of the brain, including the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex, contribute to the conditioning process, especially when the demands of the task get more complex."&lt;ref&gt;Steinmetz, J. E. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=RMH8iUZdAFYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Neural%20Basis%20of%20Classical%20Conditioning%22&amp;f=false Neural Basis of Classical Conditioning]" in Encyclopedia of Behavioral Neuroscience, Academic Press, 2010, pp 313-319s&lt;/ref&gt;

Fear and eyeblink conditioning involve generally non overlapping neural circuitry, but share molecular mechanisms.  
Fear conditioning occurs in the basolateral amygdala, which receives glutaminergic input directly from thalamic afferents, as well as indirectly from prefrontal projections.  The direct projections are sufficient for delay conditioning, but in the case of trace conditioning, where the CS needs to be internally represented despite a lack of external stimulus, indirect pathways are necessary.  The anterior cingulate is one candidate for intermediate trace conditioning, but the hippocampus may also play a major role. Presynaptic activation of [[protein kinase A]] and postsynaptic activation of [[NMDA receptor]]s and its signal transduction pathway are necessary for conditioning related plasticity.  [[CREB]] is also necessary for conditioning related plasticity, and it may induce downstream synthesis of proteins necessary for this to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fanselow|first1=Michael S.|last2=Poulos|first2=Andrew M|title=The Neuroscience of Mammalian Associative Learning|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=February 2005|volume=56|issue=1|pages=207–234|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070213}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As NMDA receptors are only activated after an increase in presynaptic calcium(thereby releasing the Mg2+ block), they are a potential coincidence detector that could mediate [[spike timing dependent plasticity]].  STDP constrains LTP to situations where the CS predicts the US, and LTD to the reverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markram|first1=H|last2=Gerstner|first2=W|last3=Sjöström|first3=PJ|title=A history of spike-timing-dependent plasticity.|journal=Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience|date=2011|volume=3|pages=4|doi=10.3389/fnsyn.2011.00004|pmid=22007168|pmc=3187646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavioral therapies===
{{main|Behavior therapy}}
Some therapies associated with classical conditioning are [[aversion therapy]], [[systematic desensitization]] and [[flooding (psychology)|flooding]].
Aversion therapy is a type of behavior therapy designed to make patients cease an undesirable habit by associating the habit with a strong unpleasant unconditioned stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;Kearney, Christopher A. ''Abnormal Psychology and Life: A Dimensional Approach''. N.p.: n.p., January 1, 2011. Print. p.336&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a medication might be used to associate the taste of alcohol with stomach upset. Systematic desensitization is a treatment for phobias in which the patient is trained to relax while being exposed to progressively more anxiety-provoking stimuli (e.g. angry words). This is an example of [[counterconditioning]], intended to associate the feared stimuli with a response (relaxation) that is incompatible with anxiety&lt;ref&gt;Kearney, Christopher A. ''Abnormal Psychology and Life: A Dimensional Approach''. N.p.: n.p., January 1, 2011. Print. p 136&lt;/ref&gt; Flooding is a form of desensitization that attempts to eliminate phobias and anxieties by repeated exposure to highly distressing stimuli until the lack of reinforcement of the anxiety response causes its extinction.&lt;ref&gt;Kearney, Christopher A. ''Abnormal Psychology and Life: A Dimensional Approach''. N.p.: n.p., January 1, 2011. Print. p 133&lt;/ref&gt; "Flooding" usually involves actual exposure to the stimuli, whereas the term "implosion" refers to imagined exposure, but the two terms are sometimes used synonymously.

Conditioning therapies usually take less time than [[humanistic psychology|humanistic]] therapies.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, Donald Loring. ''Behavior Modification.'' Wellness.com, Inc. 2006. Retrieved on 2012-2-14. http://www.wellness.com/reference/health-and-wellness/behavior-modification&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conditioned drug response===
A stimulus that is present when a drug is administered or consumed may eventually evoke a conditioned physiological response that mimics the effect of the drug. This is sometimes the case with caffeine; habitual coffee drinkers may find that the smell of coffee gives them a feeling of alertness. In other cases, the conditioned response is a compensatory reaction that tends to offset the effects of the drug. For example, if a drug causes the body to become less sensitive to pain, the compensatory conditioned reaction may be one that makes the user more sensitive to pain. This compensatory reaction may contribute to [[drug tolerance]]. If so, a drug user may increase the amount of drug consumed in order to feel its effects, and end up taking very large amounts of the drug. In this case a dangerous overdose reaction may occur if the CS happens to be absent, so that the conditioned compensatory effect fails to occur. For example, if the drug has always been administered in the same room, the stimuli provided by that room may produce a conditioned compensatory effect; then an overdose reaction may happen if the drug is administered in a different location where the conditioned stimuli are absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Psychology: The Science of Behaviour|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=New Jersey, United States|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4|pages=599–604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conditioned hunger{{anchor|Conditioned hunger}}===
Signals that consistently precede food intake can become conditioned stimuli for a set of bodily responses that prepares the body for food and digestion. These reflexive responses include the secretion of digestive juices into the stomach and the secretion of certain hormones into the blood stream, and they induce a state of hunger. An example of conditioned hunger is the "appetizer effect." Any signal that consistently precedes a meal, such as a clock indicating that it is time for dinner, can cause people to feel hungrier than before the signal. The lateral hypothalamus (LH) is involved in the initiation of eating. The nigrostriatal pathway, which includes the substantia nigra, the lateral hypothalamus, and the basal ganglia have been shown to be involved in hunger motivation.

===Conditioned emotional response{{anchor|Conditioned emotional response}}===
{{further|Conditioned emotional response|Fear conditioning}}
The influence of classical conditioning can be seen in emotional responses such as [[phobia]], disgust, nausea, anger, and sexual arousal. A familiar example is conditioned nausea, in which the CS is the sight or smell of a particular food that in the past has resulted in an unconditioned stomach upset. Similarly, when the CS is the sight of a dog and the US is the pain of being bitten, the result may be a conditioned fear of dogs. An example of conditioned emotional response is [[#Conditioned suppression|conditioned suppression]].

As an adaptive mechanism, emotional conditioning helps shield an individual from harm or prepare it for important biological events such as sexual activity. Thus, a stimulus that has occurred before sexual interaction comes to cause sexual arousal, which prepares the individual for sexual contact. For example, sexual arousal has been conditioned in human subjects by pairing a stimulus like a picture of a jar of pennies with views of an erotic film clip. Similar experiments involving blue gourami fish and domesticated quail have shown that such conditioning can increase the number of offspring. These results suggest that conditioning techniques might help to increase fertility rates in infertile individuals and endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Psychology: The Science of Behaviour|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=New Jersey, United States|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4|pages=198–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pavlovian-instrumental transfer===
{{Main|Pavlovian-instrumental transfer}}
{{expand section|date=May 2017}}
Pavlovian-instrumental transfer is a phenomenon that occurs when a conditioned stimulus (CS, also known as a "cue") that has been associated with [[reward system|rewarding]] or [[aversives|aversive]] [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] via classical conditioning alters [[motivational salience]] and [[operant behavior]].&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cartoni E, Puglisi-Allegra S, Baldassarre G | title = The three principles of action: a Pavlovian-instrumental transfer hypothesis | journal = Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 153 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24312025 | pmc = 3832805 | doi = 10.3389/fnbeh.2013.00153 | quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aversive PIT in humans - review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Geurts DE, Huys QJ, den Ouden HE, Cools R | title = Aversive Pavlovian control of instrumental behavior in humans | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 25 | issue = 9 | pages = 1428–1441 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23691985 | doi = 10.1162/jocn_a_00425 | quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer of reward - review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cartoni E, Balleine B, Baldassarre G | title = Appetitive Pavlovian-instrumental Transfer: A review | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 829–848 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27693227 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.09.020 | quote = This paper reviews one of the experimental paradigms used to study the effects of cues, the Pavlovian to Instrumental Transfer paradigm. In this paradigm, cues associated with rewards through Pavlovian conditioning alter motivation and choice of instrumental actions.&amp;nbsp;... Predictive cues are an important part of our life that continuously influence and guide our actions. Hearing the sound of a horn makes us stop before we attempt to cross the street. Seeing an advertisement for fast food might make us hungry and lead us to seek out a specific type and source of food. In general, cues can both prompt us towards or stop us from engaging in a certain course of action. They can be adaptive (saving our life in crossing the street) or maladaptive, leading to suboptimal choices, e.g. making us eat when we are not really hungry (Colagiuri and Lovibond, 2015). In extreme cases they can even play a part in pathologies such as in addiction, where drug associated cues produce craving and provoke relapse (Belin et al., 2009).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic computation of reward motivation review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berridge KC | title = From prediction error to incentive salience: mesolimbic computation of reward motivation | journal = Eur.

This is a signature feature of incentive salience. In daily life, the smell of food may make you suddenly feel hungry, when you hadn’t felt that way a minute before. In animal neuroscience experiments, a CS for reward may trigger a more frenzied pulse of increased instrumental efforts to obtain that associated UCS reward in situations that purify the measurement of incentive salience, such as in Pavlovian-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) experiments&amp;nbsp;... Similarly, including a CS can often spur increased consumption of a reward UCS by rats or people, compared to consumption of the same UCS when CSs are absent&amp;nbsp;... Thus Pavlovian cues can elicit pulses of increased motivation to consume their UCS reward, whetting and intensifying the appetite. However, the motivation power is never simply in the cues themselves or their associations, since cue-triggered motivation can be easily modulated and reversed by drugs, hungers, satieties, etc., as discussed below.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a typical experiment, a rat is presented with sound-food pairings (classical conditioning).  Separately, the rat learns to press a lever to get food (operant conditioning). Test sessions now show that the rat presses the lever faster in the presence of the sound than in silence, although the sound has never been associated with lever pressing.

Pavlovian-instrumental transfer is suggested to play a role in the [[differential outcomes effect]], a procedure which enhances operant discrimination by pairing stimuli with specific outcomes.

==In popular culture==

In the 1932 novel ''[[Brave New World]]'' by [[Aldous Huxley]], conditioning plays a key role in the maintenance of social peace, especially in maintaining the [[caste system]] upon which society is based. Another example is in [[Anthony Burgess]]' 1962 dystopian novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' in which the novel's [[anti-hero]] and [[protagonist]], Alex, undergoes a procedure called the [[Ludovico technique]], where he is fed a solution to cause severe nausea and then forced to watch violent acts. This renders him unable to perform any violent acts without inducing similar nausea. Unintentionally, he also forms an aversion to classical music.

Some general examples that involve the classical conditioning theory in action include, in a lot of cases, advertising. This is a tactic used in order to elicit a response. Advertising on game shows is one of many examples. With the exciting and positive environment of a game show, the viewer may then start to generate an exciting response to the advertisement because of the association with the environment. Another example, very similar to Pavlov's experiment, involves food. Every time a person goes into the kitchen, they begin to feel hungry. This can also relate to eating certain foods while watching a scary movie turning into associating terror with the food that was being consumed at the times of watching the movie. Any type of music, such as Christmas music, that triggers certain sweet memories are related to classical conditioning as well.

The '''Count's Feud''' ({{lang-da|Grevens Fejde}}), also called the '''Count's War''', was a [[war of succession]] that raged in [[Denmark]] in 1534–36 and brought about the [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein|Reformation in Denmark]]. In the international context, it was part of the [[European wars of religion]]. The Count's Feud takes its name from the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Count [[Christopher of Oldenburg]], who supported the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] King [[Christian II of Denmark|Christian II]], deposed in 1523, over the election of [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | language = Danish | place = DK | title = Danske Konger | url = http://www.danskekonger.dk/biografi/andre/grevefejde.html | contribution = Grevens Fejde | trans-title = Danish Kings and their History | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100920120934/http://danskekonger.dk/biografi/andre/grevefejde.html | archivedate = 2010-09-20 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | language = Danish | title = Danmark Historien | place = DK | url = http://www.danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/grevens-fejde-1534-36 | contribution = Grevens Fejde 1534–36 | publisher = Aarhus Universitet}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a staunch Protestant who had already implemented [[Lutheranism]] as the state religion in [[Duchy of Schleswig|Schleswig]] and [[Duchy of Holstein|Holstein]] in 1528.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite web|url=https://snl.no/Christian_3|title= Christian 3|publisher= Store norske leksikon|author= Erik Opsahl|accessdate= August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/Danmark_1536-1849/Wolfgang_von_Utenhof|title=Wolfgang von Utenhof

== Background ==
[[File:Christian III.jpg|right|thumb|150 px|King [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]]]]
After [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederick I]]'s death in 1533, the [[Election of Christian III|Jutland nobility proclaimed his son]], then Duke Christian of [[Gottorp]], as King under the name [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]]. Meanwhile, Count Christopher (or Christoffer) organized an uprising against the new king, demanding that Christian II be set free. Supported by [[Lübeck]] and troops from [[Oldenburg]] and [[Mecklenburg]], parts of the [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] and [[Skåneland|Skåne]] nobilities rose up, together with cities such as [[Copenhagen]] and [[Malmø]]. The violence itself began in 1534, when a [[privateer]] captain who had earlier been in Christian II's service, Klemen Andersen, called [[Skipper Clement]], at Count Christoffer's request instigated the peasants of [[Vendsyssel]] and [[North Jutland County|North Jutland]] to rise up against the nobles. The headquarters for the revolt came to be in [[Aalborg]]. A large number of manors were burned down in northern and western Jutland. On 10 August 1534, Count Christoffer accepted [[Skåneland|Skåne]] for Christian II's rule. The month before, Christoffer was heralded as [[regent]] on Christian II's behalf by the Zealand Council in [[Ringsted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | language = Danish | publisher = Roennebech | url = http://www.roennebech.dk/www_fredericiashistorie/html/fredericia/artikler/Grevens_fejde.html | contribution = Grevens Fejde | title = Danmarks historie | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100525172351/http://www.roennebech.dk/www_fredericiashistorie/html/fredericia/artikler/Grevens_fejde.html | archivedate = 2010-05-25 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The battles of Svenstrup and Aalborg==
[[Image:Johan rantzau.jpg|right|thumb|150 px|Johan Rantzau]]
An army of nobles under the leadership of [[Niels Brock]] and [[Holger Rosenkrantz]] was defeated at the Battle of Svenstrup on 16 October 1534. Christian III, in the meantime, forced a peace with Lübeck, from which great reinforcements could be freed up to fight against the rebels.  Under the leadership of [[Johan Rantzau]], the royal troops pursued the peasants all the way to Aalborg, where the latter, under the leadership of Skipper Clement, had taken refuge behind the city's fortifications.

On 18 December, Rantzau's troops stormed the city, and it fell.  At least 2,000 people are thought to have lost their lives in the storming of the city and in the plundering of the following days.  For his part, Skipper Clement, badly wounded, managed to escape, but a few days later was recognized by a peasant in [[Storvorde]] east of Aalborg and handed over to Rantzau.  Skipper Clement was later sentenced to death by the judicial council in [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]] and executed in 1536.&lt;ref&gt;[http://graenseforeningen.dk/artikel/3724 ''Grevens Fejde, borgerkrig 1534-1536'' (Grænseforeningen)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719124213/http://graenseforeningen.dk/artikel/3724 |date=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The battles of Helsingborg and Øksnebjerg==
Fortune did not fare well for the rebelling supporters of the Catholic faith, nor for the farmers on the [[Sweden|Swedish]] front.  The Swedish King [[Gustav Vasa]] sent a Swedish army to the aid of Christian III, which invaded [[Skåne]] at [[Loshult]] and plundered, burned, and murdered their way throughout the {{Interlanguage link multi|Göinge (region)|sv|3=Göinge|lt=Gønge}} area as it advanced toward the town of [[Vä|Væ]].  Later, a Swedish army invaded [[Halland]], which was destroyed by fire and sword.  Some of the Scanian nobles sided with the Swedes, but [[Tyge Krabbe]] in [[Helsingborg]] Castle supported Count Christoffer.  In January 1535, the Swedes and the army of nobles advanced on Helsingborg.  An army consisting of residents of Lübeck and Malmø under [[Jørgen Kock]] was entrenched outside of the castle, and in a decisive moment, Tyge Krabbe suddenly had the castle's cannons open fire against its defenders, after which he opened the castle to the Swedes, who set fire to Helsingborg and reduced the town to ashes.  With that, Denmark east of the [[Oresund|Sound]] was lost for Count Christoffer.

After the victory at Aalborg, Rantzau brought his troops to Funen, and on 11 June 1535, they fought the [[Battle of Øksnebjerg]], where the rest of Count Christoffer's army was decisively defeated.  Both Copenhagen and Malmø, however, were able to hold out until 1536, when they were forced to capitulate after several months' siege.  With this, the Count's Feud was officially over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bricksite.com/grevensfejde?id=377277|title=Grevensfejde|website=www.bricksite.com|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The aftermath==
In the aftermath of the feud, the nobles regrouped and healed the rifts the usual way, namely through inter-marriage. One of the most powerful among the Danish nobility in [[Skåneland|Skåne]] at this time was the Bille family, who were tied through blood relations to seven of the eight Catholic bishops of Denmark. The Billes also had six family members on the Council of the Realm and owned castles throughout Denmark and Norway. In order to keep the family's powerful position, in spite of the religious affiliation with the Catholic faith, [[Claus Bille]] (of [[Stockholm Bloodbath]] fame, second cousin to [[Gustav Vasa]]), protected the family by forming a political alliance through marriage with the Brahe family, another powerful Scanian family among the Danish nobility at this time. The Brahe family was one of the first among the nobility to convert to Lutheranism. Claus Bille gave his 18-year-old daughter Beate in marriage to [[Otte Brahe]], and thus became a grandfather in 1546 to the perhaps most famous Scanian of the era, the astronomer Tyge Brahe, better known as [[Tycho Brahe]]. Tycho Brahe's paternal grandfather, whom he was named after, Tyge Brahe of Tosterup in eastern Skåne, was killed 7 September 1523 during the siege of Malmø, fighting for Frederick I. Axel Brahe, the brother of the older Tyge Brahe, served as governor of Scania for a long period, and was one of the first to convert to Lutheranism.

In contrast, the consequences of the peasant uprising cost all parties dearly.  Many were forced to purchase their lives with great gifts both to the king and to the nobles.  Moreover, the dissatisfactions of the peasants, which had culminated in the uprising of the Count's Feud, were only made worse, as the nobility began to stick together even more after this incident.  Moreover, Christian III's rule, ushered in by this war, saw the rise of royal absolutism in Denmark, and, with it, greater repression of the peasant classes.

An important consequence not sufficiently appreciated by Danes at the time was the introduction of a Swedish army into Skåne. Though in this case the Swedes came at the invitation of a Danish King to help subdue his rebellious subjects and duly handed over to the King the territory which they conquered, it had a clear effect of whetting Swedish appetite to gain the territory for themselves, which was manifested in a long series of subsequent wars culminating with the final Swedish victory and conquest in 1658.

==Dates of the Count's Feud battles==
* Battle of Svenstrup – 16 October 1534
* Storming of Aalborg – 18 December 1534
* Battle of Helsingborg (Kernen) – 12 January 1535
* Battle of Øksnebjerg – 11 June 1535

==In popular culture==
The science fiction novel ''[[The Corridors of Time]]'' by [[Poul Anderson]]&amp;nbsp;— an American of Danish origin, whose work often includes themes from Danish and Scandinavian history&amp;nbsp;— includes a vivid description of Jutland in the immediate aftermath of the Count's Feud and the continuing struggle by hunted diehard rebels, as seen by a time-traveller from the 20th century.

The '''crystallized self''' is a theory that refers to the idea that individual selves are neither “real” nor “fake,” but rather “crystallized” with multiple facets.

==Theory behind the metaphor==
There are many theories that explain the evolution of [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. The identity is something that is not set in stone, but rather it is something that is constantly re-purposing itself and changing.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; According to the skeptical [[Postmodern philosophy|post-modern theories]], the self cannot be based off a foundation of mere experiences because a constant flow of information is streaming through the mind and changing the very way people identify with themselves and their environment. To remedy this, [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist theorists]] expanded on this because of the infinite way significance can be perceived by way of knowledge in language.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, J. (2014). Understanding Poststructuralism. Abingdon, Oxon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between words and what they symbolize is constantly evolving which creates the notion that identity and the self is "a product and effect of competing, fragmentary and contradictory discourses."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This leads to the comparison of the self to a crystal. Crystals are multidimensional much like identity. No matter the condition, crystals are still able to exist in different states, sizes, and colors. The more the crystal endures throughout its existence, the more complex and unique it becomes. Identity, on the other hand, becomes more complex and unique by way of discourse and language-base, thus leading to the metaphor known as the "crystallized self".

==Alternative metaphor==
An alternative metaphor is the “crystallized self,” a notion that pulls from Laurel Richardson’s (2001) [[epistemological]] notion of "crystallization". The “crystallized self” is considered a positive term that helps people to experience and talk about the self in more appropriately politicized and layered ways. Tracy and Tretheway say:
“The crystallized self is neither real nor fake…. The crystallized self is multidimensional; the more facets, the more beautiful and complex. Certainly crystals may feel solid, stable, and fixed. But just as crystals have differing forms, depending upon whether they grow rapidly or slowly, under constant or fluctuating conditions, or from highly variable or remarkably uniform fluids or gasses, crystallized selves have different shapes depending on the various discourses through which they are constructed and constrained”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Tracy &amp; Trethewey, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;186&lt;/ref&gt;
Viewing the self as crystallized moves away from ideas of which parts of the self are more “authentic” and rather suggests that the self is constructed through context and communication. Multiple facets can be “real” and competing simultaneously.

==In Practice==
To better realize a crystallized self, individuals might consider the following:
#Rather than privileging work as the only productive realm of everyday experience, individuals should begin to elevate their nonprofessional selves alongside those that intersect with work
#Play with language. Next time you’re at a party and asked what you do, rather than responding with your job title, consider playing with the answer. You could say, for instance, “I play with my child. I volunteer. I do yoga.”
#Place yourself in various situations in which you are not comfortable or an expert, and in this way, inch closer to the edges in your life.

''Dhrtavarta'' was the son of ''Dhrti'' and father of ''Satyakarma''. ''Nandi'' was a consort of ''Dhrti''. ''Niyama'' was a son of ''Dhrti''.

In the ''Stuti'' of ''[[Devi-Bhagavata Purana|Devi Bhagavatam]]'' (V.22.25-42), ''[[Shakti|Devi]]'', who is the Energy for the creation and destruction of the universe, has been praised as having many names and as residing in all in the form of ''[[shakti]]'' ('power and energy'), ''amrti'' ('memory'), ''dhrti'' ('steadfastness'), ''[[buddhi]] '' ('intelligence'), so on. According to the Puranas, ''[[Brahma]]'' is the creator, ''Mukunda'' (''[[Vishnu]] '') is the preserver and ''[[Hara (Hinduism)|Hara]]'' (''[[Rudra]]) is the destroyer but they themselves are created by Devi at the beginning of a [[yuga]], therefore, she is the mother of all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Purana Vol.VIII|publisher=All-India Kashiraj Trust, Fort Ramnagar, Varanasi|url= https://archive.org/stream/puranavolviii015194mbp/puranavolviii015194mbp_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Implication==

''Dhrti'' meaning 'fortitude' and 'determination' is defined as the subtle faculty in man that makes him strive continuously towards a goal. It provides courage, enthusiasm and perseverance to face and overcome all odds and obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Holy Gita Ready Reference|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=417|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fNNGYOGoibgC&amp;pg=PA433&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JV8FU6PBIoOjhgfaioGQAQ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the three types of  ''Dhrtis'' mentioned in the Bhagavad [[Gita]], Swami Tejomayananda states that  ''Sattvic dhrti'' is the unswerving fortitude with which one works for a noble cause with enthusiasm and dedication, despite obstacles; ''Rajasic dhrti'' is the fortitude displayed for a while, in a part, place or under particular circumstances to achieve particular goals and may dissolve under different circumstances and situations, and  ''Tamasic dhrti'' is the stubbornness with which one holds on to the false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ponder Awhile|author=Swami Tejomayananda|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SbYR4Bw39ckC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JV8FU6PBIoOjhgfaioGQAQ&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two factors that supply the fuel and the motive force in all sustained endeavours are - ''buddhi'' ('understanding') and ''dhrti'' ('fortitude'), the former is 'the intellectual capacity to grasp what is happening' and the latter is 'the constancy of purpose and self-application'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Holy Gita Ready Reference|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=433|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fNNGYOGoibgC&amp;pg=PA433&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JV8FU6PBIoOjhgfaioGQAQ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abhinavagupta]] states that since everyone works therefore, everyone possesses  ''dhrti''; he holds  ''buddhi'' to mean 'resolution' and  ''dhrti'' to mean 'satisfaction'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gitarthasangrha|author=Abhinavagupta|publisher=BRILL|page=209|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U9oUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA209&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y2UFU4mjMtOShQeeu4CIAQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], four things viz. [[Śruti]] and [[Smriti]] which are society’s codes of ethics, ''sadacara'' which is good noble conduct accepted by society; and ''svasya ca priyam atmanah'' which is one’s own joy and pleasure, determine [[Dharma]]. The ''sanatana dharma'' is the eternal universal values to be followed by all people in life, and ''varnasrama dharma'' consists of specific duties given to each individual; Dharma means that holds everyone and everything together which leads to material prosperity and spiritual realization in this life itself. According to [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]], ''Dhrti'' is one of the ten values necessary for all people at all times that characterize Dharma. ''Dhrti'' means fortitude; it means the capacity to hold on to something. It is the ''sattavic dhrti'' which is strength, force and ability that makes us hold on to noble values of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hindu Culture|author=Swami Tejomayananda|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|pages=95–96|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5VZtNRl24fsC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JV8FU6PBIoOjhgfaioGQAQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sattavic dhrti'' and ''Sattvic buddhi'' are mutually related terms. [[Krishna]] explains to [[Arjuna]] ([[Bhagavad Gita]] Sl. XVIII.30):

:प्रवृति च निवृति च कार्याकार्ये भयाभये |
:बन्धं मोक्षं च या वेत्ति बुद्धिः सा पार्थ सात्त्विकी ||

that "That which knows the paths of work and renunciation, what ought to be done and what not to be done, fear and fearlessness, bondage and liberation, that  'understanding' is  ''sattvic'' ('pure')." Which means the function of the intellect is discrimination, the faculty of 'right understanding ' (''buddhi'') which gives real joy, success and prosperity. With regard to sattvic dhrti he states ([[Bhagavad Gita]] l. XVIII.33):

:धृत्या यया धारयते मनः प्राणेन्द्रियकिर्याः |
:योगेनव्यभिचरिण्या धृतिः सा पार्थ सात्त्विकी ||

that the unwavering 'fortitude' by which through [[Yoga]] the functions of the mind, the [[Prana]] and the senses are restrained, that 'fortitude', is ''sattvic'' ('pure').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimad Bhagavad Gita Chapter XVIII|author=Swami Chinmayananda|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|pages=67, 75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VMX3-54zcYMC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JV8FU6PBIoOjhgfaioGQAQ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this context [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] in his Bhasya on the Bhagavad Gita explains that 'action' (way of works) is movement leading to bondage and 'inaction' (renunciation) leads to liberation. The remote expression – unwavering or unfaltering or unbroken concentration, should be related to resolve or  ''dhrti''; the sense is that the functions of the mind and so forth, maintained through unfaltering resolve, are in fact maintained through concentration. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita Bhasya of Sankaracarya|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|pages=578-580|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/bhagavad-gita-bhashya-sankara/|quote=Bhagavad Gita Slokas XVIII.30-33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yogic relevance==

[[Patanjali]]’s [[Yoga Sutra]] II.28 reads:-

:योगाङगानुष्ठानादशुध्दिक्षये ज्ञानदीप्तिराविवेकख्यातेः |

:"From the consistent practice of the parts of the Yoga-process, on the elimination of the impurity, the radiant organ of perception becomes manifest, until there is a steady discriminative insight."

This means – as impurities are eliminated through the observance of the steps of [[yoga]], a gradual kindling of knowledge occurs up to the full illumination of discriminatory wisdom. Discriminatory wisdom as virtue is the cause of happiness, and both, Vyasa and Vijnanabhikshu in their commentaries list nine causes including as the ninth cause  ''Dhrti'' here meaning sustenance; and agree that the  ''yoga-angas'' eradicate the impurity in both tangible (''drshta'') and intangible (''adrshta'') ways i.e. the physical practices such as purification (''shaucha''), and through  ''japa''. Elimination means disappearance of the veil on the  ''sattva mind-field''. The body is the sustainer of the senses being their resort but the senses sustain the body by way of providing spiritual and material welfare. The gross elements are the sustainers of the body and also sustain each other; the diverse sub-human, human and celestial bodies are mutually the sustainers and the sustained. ''Dhrti'' also means patience, remaining true to duty even in calamities, and perfection in maintaining wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga Sutras Of Patanjali|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=445, 450, 465, 675, 677|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2G3KR32j-T4C&amp;pg=PA677&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JV8FU6PBIoOjhgfaioGQAQ&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vaishno relevance==

Verse II.vi.145 of  ''Sri Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu'' states – the steadiness of heart arising from attaining realization of the Lord, from absence of suffering in attaining the realization of the Lord, and from realizing  ''prema'' with the Lord is called  ''dhrti''; in this state there is no lamentation for things not attained or for things that have disappeared. ''Ksama'' ('tolerance') is included in  ''dhrti-bhava''. The three types of  ''rati'' ('relationship of love', 'attraction') are  ''priti'' ('affection'), '' sakhya'' ('friendship') and  ''vatsalya'', ''dhrti'' along with  ''vitarka'' ('conjecture'), '' mati'' ('scriptural conclusion'), ''nirveda'' ('self-disgust'), ''smrti '' ('remembrance'), ''harsa'' ('joy'), and the type of  ''bodha'' arising from destruction of ignorance become somewhat causes of  ''rati''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu Part 1|publisher=David Bruce Hughes|page=279,293,295,317|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vuncDaOZSDkC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JV8FU6PBIoOjhgfaioGQAQ&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Disjunctive union}}

In [[set theory]], the '''disjoint union''' (or '''discriminated union''') of a family of sets is a modified [[union (set theory)|union]] operation that indexes the elements according to which set they originated in. Or slightly different from this, the disjoint union of a family of subsets is the usual union of the subsets which are [[pairwise disjoint]] &amp;ndash; [[disjoint sets]] means they have no element in common.

Note that these two concepts are different but strongly related. Moreover, it seems that they are essentially identical to each other in [[category theory]]. That is, both are realizations of the [[coproduct]] of [[category of sets]].  

==Example==
Consider the sets &lt;math&gt;A_0 = \{1, 2, 3\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_1 = \{1, 2\}&lt;/math&gt;. We can index the set elements according to  set origin by forming the associated sets
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
    A^*_0 &amp; = \{(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0)\} \\
    A^*_1 &amp; = \{(1, 1), (2, 1)\},
\end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;
where the second element in each pair matches the subscript of the origin set (e.g., the &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;(1, 0)&lt;/math&gt; matches the subscript in &lt;math&gt;A_0&lt;/math&gt;, etc.). The disjoint union &lt;math&gt;A_0 \sqcup A_1&lt;/math&gt; can then be calculated as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;
    A_0 \sqcup A_1 = A^*_0 \cup A^*_1 = \{(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1)\}.
  &lt;/math&gt;

==Set theory definition==
Formally, let {''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''i'' ∈ ''I''} be a [[family of sets]] indexed by ''I''. The '''disjoint union''' of this family is the set
: &lt;math&gt;
    \bigsqcup_{i\in I}A_i = \bigcup_{i\in I}\{(x,i) : x \in A_i\}.
  &lt;/math&gt;
The elements of the disjoint union are [[ordered pairs]] (''x'', ''i''). Here ''i'' serves as an auxiliary index that indicates which ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; the element ''x'' came from. 

Each of the sets ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is canonically isomorphic to the set
: &lt;math&gt;
    A_i^* = \{(x,i) : x \in A_i\}.
  &lt;/math&gt;
Through this isomorphism, one may consider that ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is canonically embedded in the disjoint union.
For ''i'' ≠ ''j'', the sets ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;* and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;* are disjoint even if the sets ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; are not. 

In the extreme case where each of the ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to some fixed set ''A'' for each ''i'' ∈ ''I'', the disjoint union is the [[Cartesian product]] of ''A'' and ''I'':
: &lt;math&gt;
    \bigsqcup_{i\in I}A_i = A \times I.
  &lt;/math&gt;

One may occasionally see the notation
: &lt;math&gt;
    \sum_{i\in I}A_i
  &lt;/math&gt;
for the disjoint union of a family of sets, or the notation ''A'' + ''B'' for the disjoint union of two sets. This notation is meant to be suggestive of the fact that the [[cardinality]] of the disjoint union is the [[summation|sum]] of the cardinalities of the terms in the family. Compare this to the notation for the [[Cartesian product]] of a family of sets. 

Disjoint unions are also sometimes written &lt;math&gt;\biguplus_{i\in I}A_i&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\ \cdot\!\!\!\!\!\bigcup_{i\in I}A_i&lt;/math&gt;.

In the language of [[category theory]], the disjoint union is the [[coproduct]] in the [[category of sets]]. It therefore satisfies the associated [[universal property]]. This also means that the disjoint union is the [[categorical dual]] of the [[Cartesian product]] construction. See [[coproduct]] for more details.

For many purposes, the particular choice of auxiliary index is unimportant, and in a simplifying [[abuse of notation]], the indexed family can be treated simply as a collection of sets. In this case &lt;math&gt;A_i^*&lt;/math&gt; is referred to as a ''copy'' of &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; and the notation &lt;math&gt;\underset{A \in C}{\,\,\bigcup\nolimits^{*}\!} A&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes used.

==Category theory point of view==
In [[category theory]] the disjoint union is defined as a [[coproduct]] in the category of sets. 

As such, the disjoint union is defined up to an isomorphism, and the above definition is just one realization of the coproduct, among others. When the sets are pairwise disjoint, the usual union is another realization of the coproduct. This justifies the second definition in the lead.

This categorical aspect of the disjoint union explains why &lt;math&gt; \coprod&lt;/math&gt; is frequently used, instead of &lt;math&gt; \bigsqcup&lt;/math&gt;, to denote ''coproduct''.

The '''Doctrine of Cash Equivalence''' states that the [[Income tax in the United States|U.S. Federal income tax law]] treats certain non-cash payment transactions like cash payment transactions for federal income tax purposes.&lt;ref name="Donaldson"&gt;{{cite
|first=Samuel A.|last=Donaldson
|title=Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials
|edition=2nd

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine is used most often for deciding when cash method (as opposed to [[accrual method]]) taxpayers are to include certain non-cash income items.  Another doctrine often used when trying to determine the timing of the inclusion of income is the [[constructive receipt]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;

Most individuals begin as [[cash method]] taxpayers because their first form of bookkeeping is a checkbook.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, some businesses start as accrual method taxpayers because businesses use different rules for recording income and expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) § 446(a) states, however, that  "[t]axable income shall be computed under the method of accounting on the basis which the taxpayer regularly computes his income in keeping his books."&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major advantages to the cash method of accounting is the ability to defer taxation because the recognition of income applicable to amounts in accounts receivable can be deferred to a later year.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Doctrine of Cash Equivalence''' is important because many people are cash method taxpayers and would be subject to this rule.

==Elements==
Cash method taxpayers include income items (cash and cash equivalents) in the year the items are received.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; See also Treasury Regulations &lt;ref&gt;§ 1.446-1(c)(i)&lt;/ref&gt;  Certain payment transactions involve cash equivalents, such as receipts of checks and credit card payments. The cash equivalence doctrine arose out of a need to determine whether certain items that were either actually or constructively received must be accrued as income. A dispute over timing of income recognition for tax purposes may arise when the thing received is really not much more than a promise of payment, such as a promissory note or a bond. If mere promises to pay were considered cash equivalents, then there would be little difference between the cash and accrual methods for tax purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] established the standard for applying the cash equivalence doctrine to promises of payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Cowden v. Commissioner |vol=289 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=20 |pinpoint= |court=5th Cir. |date=1961 |url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/253663/frank-cowden-sr-and-wife-gladys-cowden-petitioner-respondent-v/ |accessdate=2017-10-18 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court first noted that the principle that "[a] [[promissory note]], negotiable in form, is not necessarily the equivalent of cash" remains true.&lt;ref name="cc24"&gt;''Cowden v Commissioner'', 289 F.2d at 24.&lt;/ref&gt; But that principle also has a true inverse—that a non-[[negotiable instrument]] can be a cash equivalent if the following factors are met.&lt;ref name="cc24"/&gt; A promise to pay will be considered a cash equivalent for cash method taxpayers if:

# the promise to pay is unconditional;
# the promise is made by a solvent person;
# the promise is assignable;
# the promise is not subject to set-offs; and
# the promise is marketable.&lt;ref name="cc24"/&gt;

Since taxpayers generally prefer to defer recognition of income to subsequent tax years (due to the [[time value of money]]), a finding of cash equivalence will typically be to the disadvantage of the individual taxpayer.

==Mechanics==
To use the doctrine of cash equivalence, a taxpayer must have either actually received an item, or constructively received an item. If either of these situations exist, a taxpayer must determine whether the item received is cash equivalence, using the six factors described in Cowden v. Commissioner. If the item is deemed cash equivalent, then the taxpayer has income. If it is not cash equivalent, the taxpayer does not have income.

'''Ecological modernization''' is a school of thought in the social sciences that argues that the [[economy]] benefits from moves towards [[environmentalism]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} It has gained increasing attention among scholars and policymakers in the last several decades internationally. It is an analytical approach as well as a policy strategy and [[environmentalism|environmental]] [[discourse]] (Hajer, 1995).

==Origins and key elements==
Ecological modernization emerged in the early 1980s within a group of scholars at Free University and the Social Science Research Centre in Berlin, among them [[Joseph Huber (economist)|Joseph Huber]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Martin Jänicke|de}} and {{ill|Udo E. Simonis|de}}. Various authors pursued similar ideas at the time, e.g. [[Arthur H. Rosenfeld]], [[Amory Lovins]], Donald Huisingh, René Kemp, or [[Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker]]. Further substantial contributions were made by [[Arthur P.J. Mol]], [[Gert Spaargaren]] and [[David A Sonnenfeld]] (Mol and Sonnenfeld, 2000; Mol, 2001).

One basic assumption of ecological modernization relates to environmental readaptation of economic growth and industrial development. On the basis of [[enlightened self-interest]], economy and ecology can be favourably combined: Environmental [[productivity]], i.e. productive use of natural resources and environmental media (air, water, soil, ecosystems), can be a source of future growth and development in the same way as [[labour productivity]] and capital productivity. This includes increases in energy and resource efficiency as well as product and process innovations such as environmental management and sustainable [[supply chain management]], [[clean technology|clean technologies]], benign substitution of hazardous substances, and product design for environment. Radical innovations in these fields can not only reduce quantities of resource turnover and emissions, but also change the quality or structure of the [[industrial metabolism]]. In the co-evolution of humans and nature, and in order to upgrade the environment’s [[carrying capacity]], ecological modernization gives humans an active role to play, which may entail conflicts with nature conservation.

There are different understandings of the scope of ecological modernization - whether it is just about techno-industrial progress and related aspects of policy and economy, and to what extent it also includes cultural aspects (ecological modernization of mind, value orientiations, attitudes, behaviour and lifestyles). Similarly, there is some pluralism as to whether ecological modernization would need to rely mainly on government, or markets and entrepreneurship, or civil society, or some sort of [[multi-level governance]] combining the three. Some scholars explicitly refer to general [[modernization theory]] as well as non-Marxist [[world-systems approach|world-system theory]], others don’t.

Ultimately, however, there is a common understanding that ecological modernization will have to result in innovative structural change. So research is now still more focused on environmental innovations, or eco-innovations, and the interplay of various societal factors (scientific, economic, institutional, legal, political, cultural) which foster or hamper such innovations (Klemmer et al., 1999; Huber, 2004; Weber and Hemmelskamp, 2005; Olsthoorn and Wieczorek, 2006).

Ecological modernization shares a number of features with neighbouring, overlapping approaches. Among the most important are
*the concept of [[sustainable development]]
*the approach of [[industrial metabolism]] ([[Robert Ayres (scientist)|Ayres]] and [[Udo Simonis|Simonis]], 1994)
*the concept of [[industrial ecology]] ([[Robert H. Socolow|Socolow]], 1994)

==Additional elements==
A special topic of ecological modernization research during recent years was ''sustainable household'', i.e. environment-oriented reshaping of lifestyles, consumption patterns, and demand-pull control of supply chains (Vergragt, 2000; OECD 2002). 
Some scholars of ecological modernization share an interest in [[industrial symbiosis]], i.e. inter-site recycling that helps to reduce the consumption of resources via increasing efficiency (i.e. pollution prevention, waste reduction), typically by taking externalities from one economic production process and using them as raw material inputs for another (Christoff, 1996). 
Ecological modernization also relies on product life-cycle assessment and the analysis of materials and energy flows. In this context, ecological modernization promotes 'cradle to cradle' manufacturing ([[Michael Braungart|Braungart]] and [[William McDonough|McDonough]], 2002), contrasted against the usual 'cradle to grave' forms of manufacturing - where waste is not re-integrated back into the production process. 
Another special interest in the ecological modernization literature has been the role of [[social movement]]s and the emergence of civil society as a key agent of change ([[Dana R. Fisher|Fisher]] and Freudenburg, 2001).

As a [[strategy]] of change, some forms of ecological modernization may be favored by [[business]] interests because they seemingly meet the triple bottom line of economics, society, and environment, which, it is held, underpin sustainability, yet do not challenge [[free market]] principles. This contrasts with many [[environmental movement]] perspectives, which regard [[free trade]] and its notion of business self-regulation as part of the problem, or even an origin of [[environmental degradation]]. Under ecological modernization, the [[State (polity)|state]] is seen in a variety of roles and capacities: as the enabler for [[Market (economics)|market]]s that help produce the technological advances via competition; as the regulatory (see [[regulation]]) medium through which [[corporation]]s are forced to 'take back' their various wastes and re-integrate them in some manner into the production of new goods and services (e.g. the way that [[Automobile|car]] corporations in Germany are required to accept back cars they manufactured once those vehicles have reached the end of their product lifespan); and in some cases as an institution that is incapable of addressing critical local, national, and global environmental problems. In the latter case, ecological modernization shares with [[Ulrich Beck]] (1999, 37-40) and others notions of the necessity of emergence of new forms of [[environmental governance]], sometimes referred to as subpolitics or political modernization, where the [[environmental movement]], community groups, businesses, and other stakeholders increasingly take on direct and leadership roles in stimulating environmental transformation. Political modernization of this sort requires certain supporting norms and institutions such as a free, independent, or at least critical press, basic [[human rights]] of expression, organization, and assembly, etc.  [[New media]] such as the [[Internet]] greatly facilitate this.

==Criticisms==
Critics argue that ecological modernization will fail to protect [[environment (biophysical)|the environment]] and does nothing to alter the  impulses within the capitalist economic mode of production (see [[capitalism]]) that inevitably lead to environmental degradation (Foster, 2002). As such, it is just a form of '[[green-washing]]'. Critics question whether [[technology|technological]] advances alone can achieve resource conservation and better [[environmental protection]], particularly if left to business [[self-regulatory organization|self-regulation]] practices (York and Rosa, 2003). For instance, many technological improvements are currently feasible but not widely utilized. The most [[environmentally friendly]] product or manufacturing process (which is often also the most economically efficient) is not always the one automatically chosen by self-regulating corporations (e.g. [[hydrogen]] or [[biofuel]] vs. [[peak oil]]). In addition, some critics have argued that ecological modernization does not redress gross [[injustices]] that are produced within the capitalist system, such as [[environmental racism]] - where [[people of color]] and low income earners bear a disproportionate burden of environmental harm such as pollution, and lack access to environmental benefits such as [[parks]], and [[social justice]] issues such as eliminating [[unemployment]] (Bullard, 1993; Gleeson and Low, 1999; Harvey, 1996) - [[environmental racism]] is also referred to as issues of the asymmetric distribution of environmental resources and services (Everett &amp; Neu, 2000). Moreover, the theory seems to have limited global efficacy, applying primarily to its countries of origin - [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]], and having little to say about the [[developing world]] (Fisher and Freudenburg, 2001). Perhaps the harshest criticism though, is that ecological modernization is predicated upon the notion of 'sustainable growth', and in reality this is not possible because growth entails the consumption of natural and human capital at great costs to [[ecosystem]]s and societies.

Ecological modernization, its effectiveness and applicability, strengths and limitations, remains a dynamic and contentious area of environmental social science research and policy discourse in the early 21st century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19733">{{History of the Jews in England}}
The '''Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom''' was the culmination in the 19th century of efforts over several hundred years to loosen the legal restrictions set in place on [[History of the Jews in England|England's Jewish]] population. The nation's mercantile class had long recognised Jews as an economic asset, and they and their allies in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] sought and eventually won the passage of laws that placed male Jews in the United Kingdom on an equal legal footing with the kingdom's other emancipated males.

==Freedom for Catholics bodes well for Jews==
When in 1829 the [[Roman Catholic]]s of the United Kingdom were freed from all their [[civil disabilities]], the hopes of the Jews rose high; and the first step toward a similar alleviation in their case was taken in 1830 when [[William Huskisson]] presented a petition signed by 2,000 merchants and others of [[Liverpool]]. This was immediately followed by a bill presented by [[Robert Grant (MP)|Robert Grant]] on 15 April that year which was destined to engage the British [[legislature]] in one form or another for the next thirty years. [[Thomas Macaulay]], later a well-known and influential historian, was elected to Parliament in 1830 and – among other issues he took up – distinguished himself by attacking the exclusion of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertystory.net/LSDOCMACAULAYJEWS.htm Macaulay's speech on the exclusion of Jews from parliament]&lt;/ref&gt;

At first the bill failed to get through the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Against the opposition of [[Sir Robert Inglis, 2nd Baronet|Sir Robert Inglis]], the first reading was passed by 115 to 97 votes. But the second reading, on 17 May, notwithstanding a sizable petition in its favour from 14,000 citizens of London, was rejected by 265 to 228 votes. The next year, 1833, however, it passed its third reading in the Commons on 22 July by a majority of 189 to 52, and was read for the first time in the [[House of Lords|Lords]]. On the second reading in the Lords on 1 August it was rejected by 104 to 54, with the [[Duke of Wellington]] speaking and voting against the Bill, though the [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex|Duke of Sussex]], a constant friend to the Jews, presented a petition in its favour signed by 1,000 distinguished citizens of [[Westminster]]. The same thing happened in 1834, the bill being lost in the House of Lords by a majority of 92 votes. The whole force of the Tory Party and the personal antagonism of King [[William IV of England|William IV]] was against the bill. In the following year it was deemed inadvisable{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} to make the annual appeal to [[British Parliament|Parliament]], as the battle for religious liberty was going on in another part of the field{{Vague|date=November 2015}}; but by the passing of the [[Sheriffs' Declaration Act]]{{Dubious |Transferring accuracy challenge from hidden comment to talk page |reason=Hidden comment on page asserts that there is no such act and the link is a redlink |date=November 2015}} on 21 August 1835, Jews were allowed to hold the ancient and important office of sheriff.{{fact|date=April 2014}} In the following year the [[Jew Bill]] was introduced late in the session, and succeeded in passing its first reading in the Lords on 19 August but was then dropped owing to the lateness of the session.

==Membership of parliament==
[[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], who was born Jewish and  baptised aged 12 into the [[Church of England]], was a member of parliament from 1837, served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 1852, 1858–1859 and 1867–1868 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] governments. He went on to become, in 1868 and again in 1874, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]].  He was elevated to the House of Lords in 1876. His willingness to take Christian oaths meant there were no barriers to his political career; for Jews who had not converted to Christianity the oath remained the key obstacle. The oath of office included the words “and I make this Declaration upon the true Faith of a Christian”.

For a time the advocates of Jewish emancipation seemed to have lost heart. The chief supporters of the bill, R. Grant in the Commons, and [[Henry Richard Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland|Lord Holland]] in the Lords, died within a few months of each other in 1840, and during the next four years the political activity of the English Jews was concentrated on the attempt to obtain admission to municipal office. A bill to that effect got as far as a first reading in the Lords by one vote, in 1841, but was lost on a second reading. It was not until 31 July 1845 that the bill was carried. On 18 August 1846, the [[Religious Opinions Relief Act]] removed some of minor disabilities that affected British Jews and dissenters from the [[Established Church]]; the only state office that still remained closed to Jews was Parliament.

The success with which British Jews had induced Parliament to admit them to the shrievalty and to municipal offices had been because Jews had been actual candidates, and had been elected to those offices before any parliamentary relief was asked. It was now decided to adopt the same policy in regard to a seat in Parliament itself.

A Jewish candidate, [[Lionel de Rothschild]], was elected as one of the four members of Parliament for the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London]] in 1847 but could not take his seat without taking an oath of office, and the bill that was introduced on 16 December that year was intended to carry out the wishes of a definite English constituency. This passed its third reading in the Commons on 4 May 1848, by a majority of 62 votes, but was rejected in the Lords by 163 non-contents to 128 contents. The same thing happened in 1849 when Lionel de Rothschild was again elected, but in the following year the struggle took on another and more dramatic form.

[[David Salomons]], who had successfully fought the battle for the shrievalty and the aldermanic chair, had been elected member for [[Greenwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Greenwich]] and insisted on taking his seat, refusing to withdraw on being ordered to do so by the speaker, and adding to his offence by voting in the division on the motion for adjournment which was made to still the uproar caused by his bold course of action. The [[Prime minister]], [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], moved that Salomons be ordered to withdraw, and on that motion Salomons spoke in a dignified and forcible manner, and won the sympathy of the House, which nevertheless passed the Prime Minister's motion. The matter was then referred to the law courts, which decided that Salomons had no right to vote without having taken the oath of abjuration in the form appointed by Parliament, and fined him £500 for each vote he had recorded in the Commons. The government then brought in another bill in 1853, which was also rejected by the Lords. In 1855, Salomons was elected [[Lord Mayor of London]].

In the following two years, bills were introduced by the government to modify the parliamentary oath, but they failed to obtain the assent of the Lords. In 1858 when the Oath Bill reached the Lords they eliminated the clause relating to Jews; but when the bill was referred again to the Commons, the lower house refused to accept it as amended, and appointed a committee to formulate its reasons, upon which committee, as if to show the absurdity of the situation, the member for the City of London, Lionel de Rothschild, was appointed to serve, something which he could legally do, even though he had not taken his seat. A conference was appointed between the two houses, and ultimately a compromise was reached with the passage of the ''[[Jews Relief Act 1858]]'' by which either house might admit Jews by resolution, allowing them to omit the words "on the true faith of a Christian."

As a consequence, on Monday, 26 July 1858, Lionel de Rothschild took the oath with covered head, substituting "so help me, [[Jehovah]]" for the ordinary form of oath, and thereupon took his seat as the first Jewish member of Parliament; David Salomons was re-elected for Greenwich in a by-election and took his seat in early 1859.  Two years later a more general form of oath for all members of Parliament was introduced, which freed the Jews from all cause of exclusion.

==Reforms and political freedoms==
The [[Reform Act 1867]] granted every adult male householder the right to vote. Before this legislation only very few men in Britain could vote. In 1871, in the wake of the case of [[Numa Edward Hartog]], the [[Universities Tests Act]] removed the difficulties in the way of a Jew becoming a scholar or a fellow in an English university. In 1885, [[Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild|Sir Nathaniel de Rothschild]] was raised to the upper house as Lord Rothschild, the first Jewish Lord. In 1876 Disraeli was made [[Earl of Beaconsfield]]. They were followed within a few years by [[Henry de Worms, 1st Baron Pirbright|Henry de Worms]] as Lord Pirbright and [[Sydney Stern, 1st Baron Wandsworth|Sydney Stern]] as Lord Wandsworth. In 1890 all restrictions for every position in the [[British Empire]]  were removed being thrown open to every British subject without distinction of creed, except for that of monarch and the offices of [[Lord Chancellor|Lord High Chancellor]] and of [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]].

For some time after their admission to Parliament, the Jewish MPs belonged to the party that had given them that privilege, the Liberal Party, and Sir [[George Jessel (jurist)|George Jessel]] acted as solicitor-general in [[William Ewart Gladstone]]'s first ministry. But from the time of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] reaction in 1874 Jewish voters and candidates showed an increasing tendency toward the Conservatives. The influence of [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]] may have had some effect on this change, but it was in the main due to the altered politics of the middle and commercial classes, to which the Jews chiefly belonged. Baron Henry de Worms acted as under [[Secretary of State]] in one of [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]'s ministries, while Sir [[Julian Goldsmid]], a [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]] after the [[Home Rule]] policy of Gladstone was declared, made a marked impression as [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons]].

Altogether the struggle had lasted for sixty years; nearly all that was contended for had been gained in half that period, but complete equality was not granted to Roman Catholics and Jews until 1890. The many political friendships made during the process had facilitated social intercourse{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}.

==Communal organisations and disunity==
The pause which occurred between 1840 and 1847 in the [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] struggle was due in large measure to a schism, which at the time seemed unfortunate, which had split the Jewish community in two and which prevented the members acting in unison for the defence of their rights. The Reform movement had reached England in a mild form under the influence of the [[Goldsmid family]], which had been touched by the [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohnian movement]]. In 1841 a [[Reform Jew|Reform]] congregation was established in London, and was practically excommunicated by both the [[Spanish haham]] and the German chief rabbi. The effect of these differences was to delay common action as regards emancipation and other affairs; and it was not until 1859 that the charity organisation was put on a firm footing by the creation of the [[Jewish Board of Guardians (United Kingdom)|Jewish Board of Guardians]]. Ten years later the congregations were brought under one rule by the formation of the [[United Synagogue]] (1870), in the charter of which an attempt was made to give the [[Chief Rabbi]] autocratic powers over the doctrines to be taught in the Jewish communities throughout the [[British empire]]. But Parliament, which had recently disestablished the [[Church of Ireland|Irish Church]], did not feel disposed to establish the Jewish Synagogue, and the clause was stricken out. The chief rabbi's salary is paid partly out of contributions from the provincial synagogues, and this gives him a certain amount of authority over all the Jews of the empire with the exception of the 3,000 or more Sephardim, who have a separate [[haham]], and of the dwindling band of Reformers, who number about 2,000, scattered in London, Manchester, and Bradford. In 1871 the [[Anglo-Jewish Association]] was established to take the place, so far as regards the British empire, of the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle|Alliance Israélite]], which had been weakened by the [[Franco-German war]]. The Jews of England felt that they should be organised to take their proper part in Jewish affairs in general. For many years they, together with the French Jews, were the only members of the religion who were unhampered by disabilities; and this enabled them to act more freely in cases where the whole body of Israel was concerned.

==Fighting false "blood libels"==
As early as 1840, when the [[blood libel against Jews|blood accusation]] was revived with regard to the [[Damascus affair]], and Jewish matters were for the first time treated on an international basis, the Jews of England took by far the most prominent position in the general protest of the European Jewries against the charge. Not only was the [[Board of Deputies]] at London the sole Jewish body in Europe to hold public meetings, but owing to their influence a meeting of protest was held by eminent Christians at the [[Mansion House, London]] (3 July 1840), which formed a precedent for subsequent distinguished gatherings. [[Sir Moses Montefiore]], after aiding the Damascus Jews by obtaining, in an interview with the [[Sultan]] at [[Constantinople]], a [[firman (decree)|firman]] repudiating the blood accusation, visited Russia in 1846 to intercede for his coreligionists there. In 1860 he went to Rome in connection with the [[Edgardo Mortara|Mortara]] affair; and in 1863 he led a mission to [[Morocco]] on behalf of Jews of that country. Action was likewise taken by the chief English Jews in behalf of the unfortunate [[Hebrews]] of the [[Danubian principalities]]. [[Francis Goldsmid]] made an interpellation in the House of Commons with regard to the Jews of [[Serbia]] (29 March 1867), and started a debate in that assembly (19 April 1872) on the subject of the persecutions of the Jews in [[Romania]]. As a consequence a Romanian committee was formed, which watched the activities of the illiberal government of that country.

==Pogroms in Russia==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pogrom]] --&gt;
When in 1881 the [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|outburst of violence in Russia]] brought the position of the Russian Jews prominently before the world, it was their coreligionists in England who took the lead in organising measures for their relief. Articles in "[[The Times]]" of 11 and 13 January 1882, drew the attention of the whole world to the extent of the persecutions, and a meeting of the most prominent citizens of London was held at the Mansion House on 1 February 1882 (see Mansion House Meeting). As a consequence a fund was raised amounting to more than £108,000, and a complete scheme of distributing in the United States the Russian [[refugee]]s from Brody was organised by the committee of the [[Mansion House Fund]]. Similarly, when a revival of the persecutions took place in 1891, another meeting was held at the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]], and a further sum of over £100,000 was collected and devoted to facilitating the westward movement of the Russian exodus. An attempt was made this time to obtain access directly to the czar by the delivery of a petition from the lord mayor and citizens of London; but this was contemptuously rejected, and the [[Russian Jews|Russo-Jewish]] committee which carried out the work of the Mansion House Fund was obliged to confine its activity to measures outside Russia. When [[Maurice de Hirsch]] formed his elaborate scheme for the amelioration of the condition of the persecuted Jews, headquarters were established by him in London, though the administration was practically directed from Paris. The [[immigrant]]s being excluded from most of the cities of the Continent, the burden of receiving most of the Russian refugees moving westward fell on England, as well as America.&lt;ref&gt;http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=602&amp;letter=M#2023&lt;/ref&gt;

===Result of the Russian exodus===
"The advent of such a large number of Jews, unprovided with capital, and often without a definite occupation, brought with it difficulties. It was only natural that the newcomers should arouse a certain amount of prejudice by their foreign habits, by the economic pressure they brought to bear upon certain trades, especially on that of clothing, and by their overcrowding in certain localities. While [[the Continent]] had seen the rise of strong [[anti-Semitic]] feeling, England had been comparatively free from any exhibition of this kind. During Lord Beaconsfield's ministry, a few murmurs had been heard from the more advanced Liberals against the "Semitic" tendencies of the prime minister and his brethren in the race, but as a rule social had followed political emancipation almost automatically. The Russian influx threatened to disturb this natural process, and soon after 1891 protests began to be heard against the "alien immigrants. Bills were even introduced into Parliament to check their entry into England. Nothing came of these protests, however, till the year 1902, when the question had reached such a point that it was deemed desirable to appoint a royal commission to inquire into the whole subject. The commission heard evidence both from those favouring and from those opposed to restricted immigration. Reports were made to the House of Commons that the arrival, in the [[East End of London]], of Eastern European Jews, had brought [[smallpox]] and [[scarlet fever]]. The evidence, however, does not appear to have supported these accusations. "&lt;ref&gt;'Parliamentary Debates, 4th series, vol. 145, col.711.'' and ''L.Marks.

The '''fight-or-flight response''' (also called '''hyperarousal''', or the '''acute stress response''') is a physiological reaction that occurs in response to a perceived [[Psychological trauma|harmful event]], [[Trauma (medicine)|attack]], or threat to survival.&lt;ref name="Cannon - Fight or Flight Response"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cannon|first=Walter|title=Wisdom of the Body|year=1932|publisher=W.W.

==Physiology ==

===Autonomic nervous system===
{{See also|Autonomic nervous system}}
The autonomic nervous system is a control system that acts largely unconsciously and regulates [[heart rate]], [[digestion]], [[respiratory rate]], [[pupillary dilation|pupillary response]], [[Micturition|urination]], and [[sexual arousal]]. This system is the primary mechanism in control of the fight-or-flight response and its role is mediated by two different components: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system.&lt;ref name="Human Physiology - Janig"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Janig|editor-first=W|title=Human Physiology|year=1989|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York, NY|pages=333–370|author=Schmidt, A; Thews, G|edition=2|chapter=Autonomic Nervous System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sympathetic nervous system====
{{See also|Sympathetic nervous system}}
The sympathetic nervous system originates in the [[spinal cord]] and its main function is to activate the physiological changes that occur during the fight-or-flight response. This component of the autonomic nervous system utilises and activates the release of [[norepinephrine]] in the reaction.&lt;ref name="Autonomic Nervous System - Chudler"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chudler|first=Eric|title=Neuroscience For Kids|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/auto.html|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parasympathetic nervous system====
{{See also|Parasympathetic nervous system}}
The parasympathetic nervous system originates in the sacral spinal cord and [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]], physically surrounding the sympathetic origin, and works in concert with the sympathetic nervous system. Its main function is to activate the "rest and digest" response and return the body to [[homeostasis]] after the fight or flight response. This system utilises and activates the release of the neurotransmitter [[acetylcholine]].&lt;ref name="Autonomic Nervous System - Chudler" /&gt;

===Reaction===
[[File:The Fight or Flight Response.png|thumb|upright=1.3|The fight-or-flight response]]
The reaction begins in the [[amygdala]], which triggers a neural response in the [[hypothalamus]]. The initial reaction is followed by activation of the [[pituitary gland]] and secretion of the hormone [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|ACTH]].&lt;ref name="ACTH Action"&gt;{{cite web |last=Margioris |first=Andrew |title=ACTH Action on the Adrenal |url=http://www.endotext.org/adrenal/adrenal5/adrenal5.htm |publisher=Endotext.org |accessdate=18 April 2013 |author2=Tsatsanis, Christos |date=April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306182338/http://www.endotext.org/adrenal/adrenal5/adrenal5.htm |archivedate=6 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[adrenal gland]] is activated almost simultaneously, via the sympathetic nervous system, and releases the hormone [[epinephrine]]. The release of chemical messengers results in the production of the hormone [[cortisol]], which increases [[blood pressure]], [[blood sugar]], and suppresses the [[immune system]].&lt;ref name="physiological reactions - Padgett &amp; Glaser"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Padgett|first=David|author2=Glaser, R|title=How stress influences the immune response|journal=Trends in Immunology|date=August 2003|volume=24|issue=8|pages=444–448|doi=10.1016/S1471-4906(03)00173-X|pmid=12909458|citeseerx=10.1.1.467.1386}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial response and subsequent reactions are triggered in an effort to create a boost of energy. This boost of energy is activated by epinephrine binding to [[cells (biology)|liver cells]] and the subsequent production of [[glucose]].&lt;ref name="Glycogen Metabolism - King"&gt;{{cite web|last=King|first=Michael|title=PATHWAYS: GLYCOGEN &amp; GLUCOSE|url=http://neuromuscular.wustl.edu/pathol/diagrams/glycogen.htm|publisher=Washington University, St. Louis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the circulation of cortisol functions to turn [[fatty acids]] into available energy, which prepares muscles throughout the body for response.&lt;ref name="Cell Communication in Fight or Flight"&gt;{{cite web |title=HOW CELLS COMMUNICATE DURING THE FIGHT OR FLIGHT RESPONSE |url=http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/begin/cells/fight_flight/ |publisher=University of Utah |accessdate=18 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808004906/http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/begin/cells/fight_flight/ |archivedate=8 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Catecholamine hormones, such as [[Epinephrine|adrenaline]] ([[epinephrine]]) or [[noradrenaline]] (norepinephrine), facilitate immediate physical reactions associated with a preparation for violent [[muscular]] action and:&lt;ref name=gleitman&gt;{{Cite book|author= [[Henry Gleitman]], Alan J.

===Function of physiological changes===
The physiological changes that occur during the fight or flight response are activated in order to give the body increased strength and speed in anticipation of fighting or running. Some of the specific physiological changes and their functions include:&lt;ref name="Physiological Changes - Tripod"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stress Management for Health Course|title=The Fight Flight Response|url=http://stresscourse.tripod.com/id11.html|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Science of Stress - Olpin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Olpin|first=Michael|title=The Science of Stress|url=http://faculty.weber.edu/molpin/healthclasses/1110/bookchapters/stressphysiologychapter.htm|publisher=Weber State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increased [[blood flow]] to the muscles activated by diverting blood flow from other parts of the body.
* Increased blood pressure, heart rate, blood sugars, and fats in order to supply the body with extra energy.
* The [[Coagulation|blood clotting]] function of the body speeds up in order to prevent [[bleeding|excessive blood loss]] in the event of an injury sustained during the response.
* Increased [[Muscle tone|muscle tension]] in order to provide the body with extra speed and strength.

==Emotional components==

===Emotion regulation===
{{See also|Emotional self-regulation}}
In the context of the fight or flight response, emotional regulation is used proactively to avoid threats of stress or to control the level of emotional arousal.&lt;ref name="Emotional Regulation - Cistler"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cistler|first=Josh|author2=Bunmi O. Olatunji |author3=Matthew T. Feldner |author4=John P. Forsyth |title=Emotion Regulation and the Anxiety Disorders: An Integrative Review|journal=Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment|year=2010|volume=32|issue=1|pages=68–82|doi=10.1007/s10862-009-9161-1|pmid=20622981|pmc=2901125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emotional Regulation - Gross"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gross|first=James|title=Sharpening the Focus: Emotion Regulation, Arousal, and Social Competence|journal=Psychological Inquiry|year=1998|volume=9|issue=4|pages=287–290|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0904_8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emotional reactivity===
During the reaction, the intensity of emotion that is brought on by the stimulus will also determine the nature and intensity of the behavioral response.&lt;ref name="Emotional Reactivity - Avero"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Avero|first=Pedro|author2=Calvo, M|title=Emotional reactivity to social-evaluative stress: genderdifferences in response systems concordance|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=1 July 1999|volume=27|issue=1|pages=155–170|doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(98)00229-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with higher levels of emotional reactivity may be prone to [[anxiety]] and [[aggression]], which illustrates the implications of appropriate emotional reaction in the fight or flight response.&lt;ref name="Emotional Reactivity - Carthy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carthy|first=T|author2=Horesh N |author3=Apter A |author4=Edge MD |author5=Gross JJ |title=Emotional reactivity and cognitive regulation in anxious children|journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy|date=May 2010|volume=48|issue=5|pages=384–393|doi=10.1016/j.brat.2009.12.013|pmid=20089246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emotional reactivity - Valiente"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Valiente|first=C|author2=Eisenberg N |author3=Smith CL |author4=Reiser M |author5=Fabes RA |author6=Losoya S |author7=Guthrie IK |author8=Murphy BC |title=The relations of effortful control and reactive control to children's externalising problems: A longitudinal assessment|journal=Personality|date=December 2003|volume=71|issue=6|pages=1171–1196|doi=10.1111/1467-6494.7106011 |pmid=14633062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive components==

===Content specificity===
The specific components of cognitions in the fight or flight response seem to be largely negative. These negative cognitions may be characterised by: attention to negative stimuli, the perception of ambiguous situations as negative, and the recurrence of recalling negative words.&lt;ref name="Content specificity - Reid"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reid|first1=Sophie C.|last2=Salmon|first2=Karen|author3=Peter F. Lovibond|title=Cognitive Biases in Childhood Anxiety, Depression, and Aggression: Are They Pervasive or Specific?|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|date=October 2006|volume=30|issue=5|pages=531–549|doi=10.1007/s10608-006-9077-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also may be specific negative thoughts associated with emotions commonly seen in the reaction.&lt;ref name="Content Specificity - Beck"&gt;{{cite book|last=Beck|first=Aaron|title=Cognitive Therapy and the Emotional Disorders|year=1979|publisher=Penguin Books|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perception of control===
{{See also|Control (psychology)}}
[[Perceived control]] relates to an individual's thoughts about control over situations and events.&lt;ref name="Perceived Control - Weems"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weems|first=CF|author2=Silverman, WK|title=An integrative model of control: implications for understanding emotion regulation and dysregulation in childhood anxiety|journal=Journal of Affective Disorders|date=April 2006|volume=91|issue=2|pages=113–124|doi=10.1016/j.jad.2006.01.009|pmid=16487599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceived control should be differentiated from actual control because an individual's beliefs about their abilities may not reflect their actual abilities. Therefore, overestimation or underestimation of perceived control can lead to anxiety and aggression.&lt;ref name="Perceived Control - Brendgen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brendgen|first=M|author2=Vitaro F |author3=Turgeon L |author4=Poulin F |author5=Wanner B |title=Is there a dark side of positive illusions?

===Social information processing===
{{See also|Social information processing (cognition)}}
The social information processing model proposes a variety of factors that determine behavior in the context of social situations and preexisting thoughts.&lt;ref name="Social Information Processing - Crick"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crick|first=Nicki|author2=Dodge, Kenneth|title=A review and reformulation of social information-processing mechanisms in children's social adjustment|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=January 1994|volume=115|issue=1|pages=74–101|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.115.1.74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attribution of hostility, especially in ambiguous situations, seems to be one of the most important cognitive factors associated with the fight or flight response because of its implications towards aggression.&lt;ref name="Social Information Processing - Dodge"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodge|first=Kenneth|title=Social cognition and children's aggressive behavior|journal=Journal of Child Development|date=March 1980|volume=51|issue=1|pages=162–170|doi=10.2307/1129603|jstor=1129603}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==

===Evolutionary perspective===
An [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation is that early animals had to react to threatening stimuli quickly and did not have time to psychologically and physically prepare themselves. The fight or flight response provided them with the mechanisms to rapidly respond to threats against survival.&lt;ref name="Purpose of fight or fight - Grohol"&gt;{{cite web|last=Grohol|first=John|title=What's the purpose of the fight or flight response?|url=http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2012/12/04/whats-the-purpose-of-the-fight-or-flight-response/|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Concepts of Stress - Goldstein"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=David|author2=Kopin, I|title=Evolution of concepts of stress|journal=Stress|year=2007|volume=10|issue=2|doi=10.1080/10253890701288935|pages=109–20|pmid=17514579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
A typical example of the stress response is a grazing [[zebra]]. If the zebra sees a [[lion]] closing in for the kill, the stress response is activated as a means to escape its [[Predatory imminence continuum|predator]]. The escape requires intense muscular effort, supported by all of the body’s systems. The [[sympathetic nervous system]]’s activation  provides for these needs. A similar example involving fight is of a cat about to be attacked by a dog. The cat shows accelerated heartbeat, [[piloerection]] (hair standing on end), and pupil dilation, all signs of sympathetic arousal.&lt;ref name=gleitman/&gt; Note that the zebra and cat still maintain [[homeostasis]] in all states.

===Varieties of responses===
{{more citations needed|date=October 2016}}
[[File:Ruseckas-Stumbro medžioklė.jpg|thumb|Bison hunted by dogs]]
Animals respond to threats in many complex ways. Rats, for instance, try to escape when threatened, but will fight when cornered. Some animals stand perfectly still so that predators will not see them. Many animals freeze or play dead when touched in the hope that the predator will lose interest.

Other animals have alternative self-protection methods. Some species of [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]] animals [[Chromatophore|change color]] swiftly, to camouflage themselves.&lt;ref name="Fish changing colors"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gill|first=A.C.|title=Revision of the Indo-Pacific dottyback fish subfamily Pseudochrominae (Perciformes: Pseudochromidae)|year=2004|publisher=Smithiana Monographs|pages=1–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; These responses are triggered by the sympathetic nervous system, but, in order to fit the model of fight or flight, the idea of flight must be broadened to include escaping capture either in a physical or sensory way. Thus, flight can be disappearing to another location or just disappearing in place. And often both fight and flight are combined in a given situation.

The fight or flight actions also have polarity – the individual can either fight or flee against something that is threatening, such as a hungry lion, or fight for or fly towards something that is needed, such as the safety of the shore from a raging river.

A threat from another animal does not always result in immediate fight or flight. There may be a period of heightened awareness, during which each animal interprets behavioral signals from the other. Signs such as paling, piloerection, immobility, sounds, and body language communicate the status and intentions of each animal. There may be a sort of negotiation, after which fight or flight may ensue, but which might also result in playing, mating, or nothing at all. An example of this is kittens playing: each kitten shows the signs of sympathetic arousal, but they never inflict real damage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2089">In [[differential geometry]], the '''fundamental theorem of space curves''' states that every regular [[curve]] in three-dimensional space, with non-zero curvature, has its shape (and size) completely determined by its [[curvature]] and [[Torsion of curves|torsion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces|first1=Thomas F.|last1=Banchoff|first2=Stephen T.|last2=Lovett|publisher=CRC Press|year=2010|isbn=9781568814568|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EkfyHkB2ltMC&amp;pg=PA84}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Global Analysis: Differential Forms in Analysis, Geometry, and Physics|volume=52|series=[[Graduate Studies in Mathematics]]|first1=Ilka|last1=Agricola|author1-link= Ilka Agricola |first2=Thomas|last2=Friedrich|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2002|isbn=9780821829516|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4pA2P1HyTPoC&amp;pg=PA133}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
A curve can be described, and thereby defined, by a pair of [[scalar field]]s: curvature &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; and torsion &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, both of which depend on some parameter which [[parametric equation|parametrizes]] the curve but which can ideally be the [[arc length]] of the curve.  From just the curvature and torsion, the [[vector field]]s for the tangent, normal, and binormal vectors can be derived using the [[Frenet–Serret formulas]].  Then, [[Integral|integration]] of the tangent field (done numerically, if not analytically) yields the curve.

==Congruence==
If a pair of curves are in different positions but have the same curvature and torsion, then they are [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] to each other.

A '''genogram''' (also known as a '''McGoldrick–Gerson study''',&lt;ref name=mgstudy&gt;{{cite journal|author1-first=W.|author1-last=Jolly|author2-first=J.|author2-last=Froom|author3-first=M. G.|author3-last=Rosen|journal=The Journal of family practice|year=1980|pmid=7354276|volume=10|issue=2|title=The genogram|pages=251–255}}&lt;/ref&gt; a '''Lapidus schematic'''&lt;ref name=mgstudy /&gt; or a '''family diagram'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Butler|first=John|title=The Family Diagram and Genogram: Comparisons and Contrasts|journal=American Journal of Family Therapy|volume=36|issue=3|year=2008|pages=169–180|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/uaft/2008/00000036/00000003/art00001|accessdate=5 April 2013|doi=10.1080/01926180701291055}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a pictorial display of a person's [[family relationships]] and [[medical history]]. It goes beyond a traditional [[family tree]] by allowing the user to visualize hereditary patterns and psychological factors that punctuate relationships.&lt;ref name=mgstudy /&gt; It can be used to identify repetitive patterns of behavior and to recognize hereditary tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1-last=Friedman|author1-first=H.|author2-last=Rohrbaugh|author2-first=M.|author3-last=Krakauer|author3-first=S.|title=The time‐line genogram: Highlighting temporal aspects of family relationships|journal=Family Process|series=27|pages=293–303|year=1988|doi=10.1111/j.1545-5300.1988.00293.x|volume=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Murray Bowen]] invented the concept of the genogram as part of his family systems model in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stagoll|first=Brian|last2=Lang|first2=Moshe|date=1 July 1980|title=Climbing the Family Tree: Working with Genograms|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.1467-8438.1980.tb00022.x/abstract|journal=Australian Journal of Family Therapy|language=en|volume=1|issue=4|pages=161–170|doi=10.1002/j.1467-8438.1980.tb00022.x|issn=1467-8438}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genograms were later developed and popularized in clinical settings by Monica McGoldrick and Randy Gerson through the publication of a book titled ''Genograms: Assessment and Intervention'' in 1985. Genograms are now used by various groups of people in a variety of fields such as [[medicine]], [[psychiatry]], [[psychology]], [[social work]], [[genetics|genetic]] research, [[education]], and many more.  Some practitioners in personal and [[family therapy]] use genograms for personal records and/or to explain family dynamics to the client.  Few if any genealogists use them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=R. L.|last=Beck|title=The genogram as process|journal=American Journal of Family Therapy|volume=15|issue=4|year=1987|pages=343–351|doi=10.1080/01926188708250694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbols ==
A genogram is created with simple symbols representing the gender, with various lines to illustrate family relationships. Some genogram users also put circles around members who live in the same living spaces.  Genograms can be prepared by using a complex word processor, or a computer drawing program.  There are also computer programs that are custom designed for genograms.

[[File:Genogram symbols.svg|720px|Basic Genogram Symbols]]

Genogram symbols will usually have the date of birth (and date of death if applicable) above, and the name of the individual underneath. The inside of the symbol will hold the person's current age or various codes for [[genetic disorder|genetic diseases]] or user-defined properties:  abortions, still-births, [[Sudden infant death syndrome|SIDS]], cohabitations, etc.

== Content ==
A genogram can contain a wealth of information on the families represented. It will not only show the names of people who belong to a family lineage, but how these relatives relate to each other. For example, a genogram will not only show that a person called Paul and his wife Lily have three children, but that their eldest child was sent to boarding school; that their middle child is always in conflict with her mother; that their youngest has juvenile diabetes; that Paul suffered from [[clinical depression|depression]], was an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]], and a philosopher; and that Lily has not spoken to her brother for years, has breast cancer, and has a history of quitting her jobs.

== Family relationships ==
One of the advantages of a genogram is the ability to use colour-coded lines to define different types of relationships such as [[cousin chart|family relationships]], emotional relationships and [[social relation]]ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=A.|last=Hartman|title=Diagrammatic assessment of family relationships|journal=Families in Society|volume=76|issue=2|year=1995|pages=111–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within family relationships, you can illustrate if a couple is married, divorced, common-law, engaged, etc.

[[Image:Family rel2.png|750px|Family Relationship Symbols in a Genogram]]

== Emotional relationships ==
Genograms may also include emotional relationships. These provide an in-depth analysis of how individuals relate to one another. Colour-coded lines represent various emotional relationships that bond individuals together.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Emotional-relationships.jpg|750px|Emotional Relationship Symbols in a Genogram]]

== Social relationships ==
Another component of genograms is social relationships. These allow users to link individuals who are not related to one another, but who have a connection in society-at-large, such as neighbor, co-worker, boss-employee, pastor-church member, teacher-student, etc. Social relationships can also illustrate an individual's relation to a social entity. The use of social relationships links allows the genogram to be used in a business environment to create [[organizational chart]]s or [[floor plan]] layouts of the employees.

A genogram looks like a [[family tree]], but with all the different types of relationships, it contains a significantly more detailed and complete picture of the family or group it illustrates.

== Purpose ==

=== Genealogy ===
In [[genealogy]], genograms are used to record [[family history]] through the lives of each of its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=H. C.|last=Mullins|chapter=Collecting and recording family data: The genogram|title=Working with the Family in Primary Care|editor-last=Christie-Seely|editor-first=J.|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genograms allow the genealogist to graphically portray complex family trees that show marriages and divorces, [[reconstituted family|reconstituted families]], adoptions, strained relationships, family cohesion, etc. Genealogists can use genograms to discover and analyze interesting facts about their family history, such as a naming pattern, sibling rivalry, or significant events like immigration.

=== Medicine ===
In [[medicine]], medical genograms provide a quick and useful context in which to [[Risk assessment|evaluate an individual's health risks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1-first=E.|author1-last=Schilson|author2-first=K.|author2-last=Braun|title=Use of genograms in family medicine: A family physician/family therapist collaboration|journal=Family Systems Medicine|volume=11|issue=2|pages=201–208|year=1993|doi=10.1037/h0089389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of diseases and conditions that occur within a family can give a health care team invaluable information that may aid in a swift, accurate diagnosis and treatment of health problems.  And, a knowledge of diseases and illnesses that "run" in families can give individuals an important head start in pursuing effective preventive measures. A medical genogram is helpful in determining patterns of disease or illness within a family.  Medical genograms can include many generations, however four generations may prove to be enough detail.

[[File:Genogramma medico.png|650px|Medical Genogram Symbols|Medical Genogram Lege]]

=== Sociology ===
Genograms are used by [[sociology|sociologists]] to gather objective and consistent information from the clients and their family, helping them to view the client's issues in the larger context of their marital relationship, family relationships and culture of origin and underlining key issues to discuss in client [[psychotherapy|counseling]]. Genograms portray emotional relationships, which allow Sociologists to see and evaluate possible conflicts within the family. Psychological patterns may be detected in the genogram which provide the basis for precautionary and preventive measures that otherwise might not be warranted.

=== Social work ===
In [[social work]], genograms are used to display emotional bonds between individuals composing a family or [[social unit]]. A genogram will help social workers to make an assessment of the level of cohesiveness within a family or a group and to evaluate if proper care is available within that unit. Genograms also allow displaying social relationships that illustrate the places people attend such as schools, churches, youth facilities, associations or [[retirement home]]s.

=== Family therapy ===
In [[family therapy]], genograms are used to study and record relationship patterns between family members and the individual characteristics that make up these patterns that occur. A genogram will help family therapists to make an appropriate assessment of the relationship patterns and where intervention may be needed to help the family reduce the dysfunction and/or problematic situation that brought them into therapy.

=== Research ===
In research, genograms allow researchers to understand multi generational processes within various plant and animal species, such as the development of mutations. Genograms can also illustrate rates of renewal, mechanisms of survival, or processes involved in the regulation of tolerance, among other things.

=== Education ===
In education, genograms can be used by teachers and students for illustrating book reviews, or family trees of a famous politician, philosopher, scientist, musician, etc. They allow them to focus their attention on specific details and also see the big picture of the books and individuals they are studying.

== Creating genograms ==
Genograms can be useful in almost any profession that deals with [[social interactions|social interaction]]. Genograms can help to visualize complex interactions between individuals and to study patterns of behaviors or diseases. Genograms are easily created with [[genealogy software]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nslij-genetics.org/soft/|author=Dr. Wentian Li|authorlink=Wentian Li|publisher=Columbia University|location=New York, NY|title=An Alphabetic List of Genetic Analysis Software|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826024732/http://www.nslij-genetics.org/soft/|archivedate=26 August 2012|date=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as advanced software allows the user to include tremendous amounts of data. Genealogy software also allows the user to create detailed reports containing analysis of the information stored in each person's individual properties.  Commercial software, such as [[Genopro]], Genome Analytics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genogramanalytics.com/|title=Genome Analytics Software}}&lt;/ref&gt; and iGenogram for iPad&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilogotec.com/igenogram-1-8/|title=iGenogram for iPad}}&lt;/ref&gt; is available to produce genograms, as well as hundreds of different academic and scientific programs for specialized uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animalgenome.org/cgi-bin/util/sw_index|title=A Database of Genetic Analysis Software|publisher=Iowa State University|date=21 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genograms are often drawn by hand, sketched working right with the client.  It is also possible to create a Genogram in any graphics or [[word processing]] program.

'''Giuseppe Chiari''' (1926&amp;ndash;2007) was an [[Avant-Garde]] Florentine [[conceptual artist]] and [[experimental music]]ian active in [[Neo-Dada]] circles, specifically the [[Fluxus]] art movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=36943 Giuseppe Chiari at MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt; Chiari was a supporter of [[intermedia]] work conducted between music, speech, gesture and image.

==Life and work==
Giuseppe Chiari was born in Florence, Italy on September 26, 1926. In Florence he devoted himself to studying [[piano]] and music composition in parallel with studies in mathematics and engineering (1946–51).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giuseppechiari.it/index.php?id=4 Giuseppe Chiari in the dalla Enciclopedia Italiana]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was especially drawn to the work of [[John Cage]], and himself began to take an interest in promoting experimental research in visual music in 1961. In 1962, at the Fluxus Festspiele internationale Neuester Musik in Wiesbaden, he joined the [[Fluxus]] group, taking on the role of artist-composer-philosopher. Among his writings are: Music without counterpoint (1969), Untitled (1971), Mother Music (1973); Teatrino (1974) Art (1974), Method for playing (1976); Aesthetik (1984), Doubt harmony (1990) and Music (1994).

Chiari made what he called "action music" based on a complex method of execution and traditional instruments: music that takes as its essential element [[random]] sounds (water, dry leaves, stones). His work “Giuocare con l’acqua e dire la parola acqua” (“Playing with water and saying the word water”) is quite remarkable for both the transformation of the pages of the script into an aesthetic object, and the clarity and rigour of the texts that preludes to the later production of statements typical of [[conceptual art]]. His Work ''Fogli pentagrammati'', 1975, is in Museo cantonale d'arte of [[Lugano]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-mca.ti.ch/lugano/eMuseumPlus?service=direct/1/ResultDetailView/result.inline.lightbox.t1.collection_lightbox.$TspTitleImageLink.link&amp;sp=13&amp;sp=Sartist&amp;sp=SfilterDefinition&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=1&amp;sp=3&amp;sp=SdetailView&amp;sp=19&amp;sp=Sdetail&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=T&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=Slightbox_3x4&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=T&amp;sp=0 Museo cantonale d'arte, Lugano: Giuseppe Chiari]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiari experimented with different visual mediums: from painting-[[collage]]s, [[sheet music]], and photographs. His graphic and pictorial work is partially preserved at the International Centre of Contemporary Art Tornabuoni in Florence.

'''''Ḥayy ibn Yaqẓān''''' (''[[arabic|ar.]]'' حي بن يقظان ''Alive, son of Awake'') is an [[Arabic]] [[philosophical novel]] and an [[allegorical]] tale written by [[Ibn Tufail]] in the early 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199917389.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199917389-e-35 | title=The Oxford Handbook of Islamic Philosophy | chapter=Ibn Ṭufayl’s (d. 1185) Ḥayy ibn Yaqẓan | first=Taneli | last=Kukkonen | editor-first1=Khaled | editor-last1=El-Rouayheb | editor-first2=Sabine | editor-last2=Schmidtke | date=November 2016 | accessdate=2 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also known as (''[[latin|lat.]]'') '''Philosophus Autodidactus''' ''The Self-Taught Philosopher'' and as (''[[English language|en.]]'') ''The Improvement of Human Reason: Exhibited in the Life of Hai Ebn Yokdhan''.

== Plot ==
The story revolves around Ḥayy ibn Yaqẓān, a little boy who grew up on an island in the Indies under the equator, isolated from the people, in the bosom of an antelope that raised him feeding him with her milk.

Ḥayy has just learned to walk: imitating the sounds of antelopes, birds and other animals in his surrounding, he learns the languages of the animals around him; and he learns to guide himself to the actions of animals by imitating their instinct.

He makes his own shoes and clothes from the skins of the animal, studies the stars, till he reaches a higher level of knowledge of the finest of astrologist. His continuous explorations and observation of creatures and environment led him to gain great knowledge in natural science, philosophy and religion.

He will conclude that, at the basis of the creation of the universe, a great creator must  exist.

Ḥayy ibn Yaqẓān lived a humble modest life as [[Sufism|Sufi]] and forbade himself from eating meat. 
Once thirty years old, he met the first human, landed on his isolated Island.

By the age of forty-nine years, he will be ready to teach other people about the knowledge he gained throughout his life.

A '''''jivan mukta''''' or '''''mukta'''''&lt;ref&gt;The Vivekacūḍāmaṇi of Śaṅkarācārya Bhagavatpāda: An Introduction and Translation edited by John Grimes "A mukta is a mukta, with or without a body.110 It may be said that a knower of the Self with a body is a jivanmukta and when that person sheds the body, he attains videhamukti. But this difference exists only for the onlooker, not the mukta."&lt;/ref&gt; is someone who, in the [[Advaita Vedanta]] philosophy of [[Hinduism]], has gained and assimilated infinite and divine knowledge and power and gained complete self-knowledge and self-realisation and attained [[Kaivalya]] or [[Moksha]] (enlightenment), thus is liberated with an inner sense of freedom while living and not yet died.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gavin Flood]] (1998), An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521438780}}, page 92-93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Klostermaier, Mokṣa and Critical Theory, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Jan., 1985), pages 61-71&lt;/ref&gt; The state is the aim of [[moksha]] in Advaita Vedanta, [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] and other schools of Hinduism, and it is referred to as ''jivanmukti'' (Self-realization).&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Fort and Patricia Mumme (1996), Living Liberation in Hindu Thought, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-2706-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman E.

Jivanmukti contrasts with the concept of ''[[Videha mukti|videhamukti]]''; the latter means "liberation or emancipation after death, in afterlife".&lt;ref&gt;M. von Brück (1986), Imitation or Identification?, Indian Theological Studies, Vol. 23, Issue 2, pages 95-105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], {{Google books|2h0YAAAAYAAJ|The philosophy of the Upanishads|page=356}}, pages 356-357&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Jivanmukti'' is derived from a combination of [[Sanskrit]] words ''[[jiva]]'' and ''[[Moksha|mukti]]'', which mean "life" and "freedom" respectively. The word means, "liberation during life, liberation before death",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan Gonda|authorlink=Jan Gonda|title=Medieval Religious Literature in Sanskrit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XEkqAAAAYAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Harrassowitz|isbn=978-3-447-01743-5|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey A.

==Description==
{{main|Moksha}}

The various texts and schools of Hinduism describe ''Jivanmukti'' state of existence as one of liberation and freedom reached within one’s life.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Muktika Upanishad, Varaha Upanishad, Adhyatma Upanishad, Sandilya Upanishad, [[Tejobindu Upanishad]], etc.; in K.N. Aiyar (Transl. 1914), [[:iarchive:thirtyminorupani00xxxxuoft|Thirty Minor Upanishads]], University of Toronto Robart Library Archives, Canada&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], [[:iarchive:philosophyupani00deusgoog|The philosophy of the Upanishads]], Translated by A.S. Geden (1906), T&amp;T Clark, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; Some contrast ''jivanmukti'' with ''videhamukti'' (moksha from samsara after death).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1 &amp; 2, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1467-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jivanmukti is a state that transforms the nature, attributes and behaviors of an individual, claim these ancient texts of Hindu philosophy. For example, according to Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad, the enlightened individual shows attributes such as:&lt;ref&gt;see:

* he is not bothered by disrespect and endures cruel words, treats others with respect regardless of how others treat him;
* when confronted by an angry person he does not return anger, instead replies with soft and kind words;
* even if tortured, he speaks and trusts the truth;
* he does not crave for blessings or expect praise from others;
* he never injures or harms any life or being ([[ahimsa]]), he is intent in the welfare of all beings;&lt;ref&gt;see also Sandilya Upanishad for ahimsa and other virtues; Quote: “तत्र हिंसा नाम मनोवाक्कायकर्मभिः सर्वभूतेषु सर्वदा क्लेशजननम्”; Aiyar translates this as: He practices Ahimsa - no injury or harm to any living being at any time through actions of his body, his speech or in his mind; K.N. Aiyar (Transl. 1914), [[:iarchive:thirtyminorupani00xxxxuoft|Thirty Minor Upanishads]], University of Toronto Robart Library Archives, Canada, pp 173-174&lt;/ref&gt;
* he is as comfortable being alone as in the presence of others;
* he is as comfortable with a bowl, at the foot of a tree in tattered robe without help, as when he is in a mithuna (union of mendicants), grama (village) and nagara (city);
* he doesn’t care about or wear [[sikha]] (tuft of hair on the back of head for religious reasons), nor the holy thread across his body. To him, knowledge is sikha, knowledge is the holy thread, knowledge alone is supreme. Outer appearances and rituals do not matter to him, only knowledge matters;
* for him there is no invocation nor dismissal of deities, no mantra nor non-mantra, no prostrations nor worship of gods, goddess or ancestors, nothing other than knowledge of Self;
* he is humble, high spirited, of clear and steady mind, straightforward, compassionate, patient, indifferent, courageous, speaks firmly and with sweet words.

==Advaita view==
Adi Shankara explains that nothing can induce one to act who has no desire of his own to satisfy. The supreme limit of [[vairagya]] ("detachment"), is the non-springing of ''vasanas'' in respect of enjoyable objects; the non-springing of the sense of the “I” (in things which are the ''[[Anatman (Hinduism)|ānatman]]'') is the extreme limit of ''bodha'' ("awakening"), and the non-springing again of the modifications which have ceased is the extreme limit of ''[[Uparati]]'' ("abstinence"). The Jivanmukta gains divine and infinite knowledge and has complet self-knowledge and Self-realization, a Jivanmukta by reason of his ever being Brahman, is freed from awareness of external objects and no longer aware of any difference between the inner atman and Brahman and between Brahman and the world, he knows the he is same as Brahman and has a ever experiencing infinite consciousness. ''"Vijnatabrahmatattvasya yathapurvam na samsrtih"'' – "there is no [[saṃsāra]] as before for one who has known Brahman".&lt;ref name=Vivekacudamani&gt;{{cite book |title=Vivekacūḍāmaṇi of Śrī Samkara Bhagavatpāda |author=Śaṅkarācārya |pages=403–423 |publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan |year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three kinds of ''[[prarabdha karma]]'': ''Ichha'' ("personally desired"), ''Anichha'' ("without desire") and ''Parechha'' ("due to others' desire"). For a self realized person, a Jivanamukta, there is no ''Ichha-Prarabdha'' but the two others, ''Anichha'' and ''Parechha'', remain,&lt;ref name=kar/&gt; which even a jivanmukta has to undergo.&lt;ref name=kar&gt;{{cite web |first=Ramana |last=Maharshi |url=http://www.hinduism.co.za/karma&amp;.htm |title=Karma and Destiny |authorlink=Ramana Maharshi |work=Hinduism.co.za |accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Paths to Transcendence: According to Shankara, Ibn Arabi, and Meister Eckhart |first=Reza |last=Shah-Kazem |publisher=World Wisdom, Inc. |year=2006 |isbn=0-941532-97-6 |pages=59-60}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Advaita school for those of wisdom ''Prarabdha'' is liquidated only by experience of its effects; ''Sancita'' ("accumulated karmas") and ''Agami'' ("future karmas") are destroyed in the fire of ''[[Jnana]]'' ("knowledge").&lt;ref name=Vivekacudamani/&gt;

The term '''Paramukti''' is commonly used to refer to final liberation, which occurs upon the death of the body of someone who has attained Jivanmukti or Kaivalya during his or her lifetime. It implies the ultimate release of the soul ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]) from the Saṃsāra and karma and merger of the atman in [[Brahman]], so when a Jivanmukta dies he becomes a '''Paramukta'''. In the Hindu view, when an ordinary person dies and his physical body disintegrates, the person's unresolved karma causes his atman to pass on to a new birth; and thus the karmic inheritance is reborn in one of the six realms of [[samsara]]. However, when a person attains Jivanmukti, he is liberated from karmic rebirth. When such a person dies and his physical body disintegrates, his cycle of rebirthing ends and he become one with Brahman, then that person is said to have achieved '''Paramukti''' and became a Paramukta, so, a Jivanmukta has a body while a Paramukta is bodyless and pure.
 
In the ''[[Śramaṇa|śramaṇic]]'' traditions, the jivanmukta is called an ''[[arhat]]'' in Buddhism and ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|arihant]]'' in Jainism.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

==Implication==

The Advaita school holds the view that the world appearance is owing to ''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]]'' (ignorance) that has the power to project i.e. to superimpose the unreal on the real ([[adhyasa]]), and also the power to conceal the real resulting in the delusion of the [[Jiva]] who experiences objects created by his mind and sees difference in this world, he sees difference between the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]] ("the individual self") and [[Brahman]] ("the supreme Self"). This delusion caused by ignorance is destroyed when ignorance itself is destroyed by knowledge. When all delusion is removed there remains no awareness of difference. He who sees no difference between Self and Brahman is said to be a Jivanmukta. Jivanmukta experience enlightenment and liberation while alive and also after death i.e., after becoming paramukta, while Videhmukta experiences enlightenment and liberation only after death.
There are four stages of Jivanmukti:–

1. '''Sālokya''' – living in the same world.

2. '''Sārūpya''' – having the same form

3. '''Sāmīpya''' – being close to

4. '''Sāyujya''' – merging into.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Constructive Survey Of Upanishadic Philosophy: Being An Introduction To The Thought Of The Upanishads |first=R. D. |last=Ranade |publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan |place=Mumbai |year=1986 |orig-year=1926 |page=157 |url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

STAGE 1. The first stage is called sālokya — corresponding to the waking state of consciousness (jāgrata) — the realization that the entire vast universe of billions of galaxies and universes is all pervaded by the Divine Consciousness. (Viṣṇu means That which pervades the entire universe and everything in it.) It is the undifferentiated Ocean of Being.
When this stage is achieved then the person gets the freedom from the idea that the world is separate and independent from us and is an ultimate source of abiding pleasure and joy.

STAGE 2. The second stage is sarūpya or sadhārmya — corresponding to the dreaming state of consciousness – realization that every being is interconnected and all “apparently” separate jivas are embodiments of the One Divine Consciousness. When this stage is achieved then the person gets the freedom from ahaṅkāra - the notion of self-identity and the notion of difference and the other, thus being able to cultivate empathy with all and universal compassion for all beings.

STAGE 3. The third stage samīpya — is intimacy with the Divine — corresponding to the unconscious dreamless state of consciousness – God-realization occurs when the nature of the saguṇa īśvara is cognized and one surrenders to Him/Her. When this stage is achieved then the person gets the freedom from all self-effort to achieve liberation, freedom from religion and its bondage and the relinquishing of all self-imposed burdens – achieving a state of equanimity, tranquility, abiding joy and peace.

STAGE 4. The final stage sāyujya — communion with, or unification with the Absolute Godhead — corresponding to the Turiya or inconceivable and inexpressible fourth state of consciousness – a merging with the Godhead bordering on complete identity.
When this stage is achieved then the person becomes a complete Jivanmukta and gets the absolute freedom from rebirth and suffering — the final stage of Brahma-nirvāna.

==Significance==

The Advaita philosophy rests on the premise that noumenally the Absolute alone exists, Nature, Souls and God are all merged in the Absolute; the Universe is one, that there is no difference within it, or without it; Brahman is alike throughout its structure, and the knowledge of any part of it is the knowledge of the whole ([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] II.4.6-14), and, since all causation is ultimately due to Brahman, since everything beside Brahman is an appearance, the Atman is the only entity that exists and nothing else. All elements emanated from the Atman ([[Taittiriya Upanishad]] II.1) and all existence is based on Intellect ([[Aitareya Upanishad]] III.3). The universe created by Brahman from a part of itself is thrown out and re-absorbed by the Immutable Brahman ([[Mundaka Upanishad]] I.1.7). Therefore, the [[Jiva]] (the individual self) is non-different from [[Brahman]] (the supreme Self), and the Jiva, never bound, is ever liberated. Through [[Self-consciousness (Vedanta)|Self-consciousness]] one gains the knowledge of existence and realizes Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bhagavad-Gita As It Is |author=[[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] |publisher=The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust |year=1972 |place=Mumbai |page=621 |url=http://vedabase.net/bg/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kancha Ilaiah was born in the village of Papaiahpet, [[Warangal district]] in erstwhile [[Hyderabad State]].&lt;ref name=rediff&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2000/may/24ap.htm |work=Rediff |title=The attempt to censor my writings is part of a larger game plan |date=24 May 2000 |accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family belonged to the sheep-grazing [[Kuruba|Kuruma]] [[Golla (caste)|Golla]] caste, a community designated by the Government of India as an [[Other Backward Class]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-a-caste-reference-in-his-2009-book-has-come-back-to-haunt-kancha-ilaiah/story-q7EbiFUWXbW902JDn5u1MI.html|title=How a caste reference in his 2009 book has come back to haunt Kancha Ilaiah}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ilaiah credited his mother, Kancha Kattamma, as pivotal in shaping his political thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/how-cow-protection-laws-brutalise-our-culture/articleshow/53691544.cms|title=How cow protection laws brutalise our culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ilaiah, she was at the forefront of the Kurumas' struggle against the [[forest range officer|forest guards']] discriminatory behaviour. Kancha Kattamma was killed during a violent confrontation while protesting against police brutality.&lt;ref name="Kancha Ilaiah"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ambedkar.org/reformers/KanchaIlaiah.htm |title=Kancha Ilaiah |publisher=Ambedkar.org |date=16 November 2000 |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Dalit activist,&lt;ref name=rediff/&gt; Ilaiah is often identified as being a Dalit himself in news reports,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/07/india-president-ram-nath-kovind-takes-oath-170725074458219.html  India's President Ram Nath Kovind takes oath, Aljazeera]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/we-need-a-new-god-says-dalit-thinker-kancha-ilaiah/story-ooWKO6iUKLAXv7qFqEW4ML.html  Good Shepherd: Dalit thinker Kancha Ilaiah on name, caste,  May 27, 2016, Sudipto Mondal , Hindustan Times]&lt;/ref&gt; although he was in fact born into an Other Backward Class community.

==Professional life==
Ilaiah received an M.A. degree in [[political science]] and an M.Phil., awarded for his study of [[land reform in India|land reform]] in the south Indian state of [[Andhra Pradesh]].&lt;ref name=rediff/&gt; He has been a recipient of the [[Mahatma Jyotirao Phule]] Award and was a [[Jawarharlal Nehru Fellowship|Nehru Fellow]] between 1994-97.&lt;ref name=rediff/&gt;

Ilaiah earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] on the basis of his work exploring the political dimension of [[Buddhism in India|Buddhism]], culminating in ''God as Political Philosopher - Buddha Challenge to Brahminism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/modi-should-ask-sadhus-to-clean-the-streets/article8830075.ece|title=Modi should ask sadhus to clean the streets}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Ilaiah has encouraged proficiency in the English language for Dalits, arguing that it would allow Dalits in India to intellectually engage the world outside India without non-Dalits speaking "for them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/telangana/Introduce-English-in-all-schools-says-Kancha-Ilaiah/2016/08/08/article3568906.ece|title=Introduce English in all schools, says Dalit scholar Kancha Ilaiah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/interviews/Kancha-Ilaiah-Even-if-10-dalit-children-got-English-education-India-would-change/articleshow/18503625.cms&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/808852/in-defense-of-english-blame-the-education-system-not-the-language|title=In defence of English: Blame the Indian education system, not the language}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, in protest against "Brahmanic hegemony" he claims continues to persist in India, Ilaiah appended "Shepherd" to his name. Ilaiah identified in this choice recognition and reaffirmation of his family origins. As an English-language proper noun rather than its equivalent in an Indian language, "Shepherd" is meant to demonstrate a symbolic break with the cultural norms Ilaiah believed "Brahmins" sought to "impose" on Indian society. Ilaiah characterises his name change as a tool for the upliftment of Dalits.&lt;ref name="hindustantimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/we-need-a-new-god-says-dalit-thinker-kancha-ilaiah/story-ooWKO6iUKLAXv7qFqEW4ML.html |title=Good Shepherd: Dalit thinker Kancha Ilaiah on name, caste |work=Hindustan Times |date=2016-05-27 |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Ilaiah is serving as director of the Centre for Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy at [[Maulana Azad National Urdu University]] (MANUU) in [[Hyderabad]].

==Criticism==
While working as an associate professor in the Department of Political Science at [[Osmania University]], several of Ilaiah's colleagues as well as academics affiliated with the university expressed, in an open-letter, their concern with respect to certain articles and opinions Ilaiah had contributed to a local newspaper and advised him against writing material that could inflame sectarian discontent or prejudice.&lt;ref name=rediff/&gt;

In February 2013, at the [[Jaipur Literary Festival]], Ilaiah and [[Javed Akhtar]] engaged in a heated discussion over the implications of religion in Indian social life.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jaipur-literature-festival-ends-but-controversy-lingers/article4354622.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

Ilaiah has also been criticised for believing in the [[Indo-Aryan migration#"Aryan_invasion"|Aryan invasion theory]].&lt;ref name="hindustantimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2005/oct/18franc.htm|title=Who are real Dalits of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, Ilaiah stated that if [[Vallabhbhai Patel]], the first Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of India credited with forging national unity amidst the intense violence and bloodletting that followed the creation of Pakistan, had been Prime Minister of India, India "would have become Pakistan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/if-sardar-patel-was-pm-india-would-ve-become-pakistan-kancha-ilaiah/story-l3SqCY5Dqta6uu0TeLIYHJ.html |title=If Sardar Patel was PM, India would’ve become Pakistan: Kancha Ilaiah |work=Hindustan Times |date=2015-11-30 |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Ilaiah gave a controversial remark that vegetarianism is anti-nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/politics/vegetarians-are-anti-national-kancha-ilaiahs-hyperbole-illustrating-ambedkars-food-democracy-2728650.html|title=Vegetarianism is anti-nationalism: Kancha Ilaiah on Ambedkar's food democracy}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 September 2017, [[T. G. Venkatesh]], a member of [[Indian Parliament]] representing the [[Telugu Desam Party]] and a prominent leader of [[Arya Vysya]] said at a press conference that Ilaiah was a traitor and should be hanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TD MP TG Venkatesh says ‘Hang ilaiah’ for his book|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/180917/td-mp-tg-venkatesh-says-hang-ilaiah-for-his-book.html|publisher=The Deccan Chronicle|accessdate=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{why|date=March 2018}}

{{More citations needed|date=July 2017}}
'''Libido''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ɪ|ˈ|b|iː|d|oʊ}}; [[colloquial]]: '''sex drive''') is a person's overall sexual drive or desire for [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]]. Libido is influenced by [[biological]], [[psychological]] and social factors. Biologically, the [[sex hormone]]s and associated neurotransmitters that act upon the [[nucleus accumbens]] (primarily [[testosterone]] and [[dopamine]], respectively) regulate libido in humans.&lt;ref name="MEDRS review" /&gt; Social factors, such as work and family, and internal psychological factors, such as personality and stress, can affect libido. Libido can also be affected by medical conditions, medications, lifestyle and relationship issues, and age (e.g., [[puberty]]). A person who has extremely frequent or a suddenly increased sex drive may be experiencing [[hypersexuality]], while the opposite condition is [[hyposexuality]].

A person may have a desire for sex, but not have the opportunity to act on that desire, or may on personal, moral or religious reasons [[Sexual abstinence|refrain from acting on the urge]]. Psychologically, a person's urge can be [[Psychological repression|repressed]] or [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimated]]. On the other hand, a person can engage in sexual activity without an actual desire for it. Multiple factors affect human sex drive, including stress, illness, pregnancy, and others. A 2001 review found that on average, men have a higher desire for sex than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Roy F. Baumeister, Kathleen R. Catanese, and Kathleen D. Vohs|title=Is There a Gender Difference in Strength of Sex Drive? Theoretical Views, Conceptual Distinctions, and a Review of Relevant Evidence|url=http://assets.csom.umn.edu/assets/71520.pdf|work=Department of Psychology Case Western Reserve University|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|quote=All the evidence we have reviewed points toward the conclusion that men desire sex more than women. Although some of the findings were more methodologically rigorous than others, the unanimous convergence across all measures and findings increases confidence. We did not find a single study, on any of nearly a dozen different measures, that found women had a stronger sex drive than men. We think that the combined quantity, quality, diversity, and convergence of the evidence render the conclusion indisputable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sexual desire]]s are often an important factor in the formation and maintenance of [[intimate relationship]]s in humans. A lack or loss of sexual desire can adversely affect relationships. Changes in the sexual desires of any partner in a sexual relationship, if sustained and unresolved, may cause [[Relationship breakup|problems in the relationship]]. The [[infidelity]] of a partner may be an indication that a partner's changing sexual desires can no longer be satisfied within the current relationship. Problems can arise from disparity of sexual desires between partners, or poor communication between partners of sexual needs and preferences.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;

== Psychological perspectives ==

===Psychoanalysis===
{{Psychoanalysis |Concepts}}
[[File:Sigmund Freud, by Max Halberstadt (cropped).jpg|thumb|160px|[[Sigmund Freud]]]]

[[Sigmund Freud]] defined libido as "the energy, regarded as a quantitative magnitude... of those instincts which have to do with all that may be comprised under the word 'love'."&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, [[Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego]], 1959&lt;/ref&gt; It is the instinct energy or force, contained in what Freud called the [[Id, Ego and Superego|id]], the strictly unconscious structure of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]].

Freud developed the idea of a series of developmental phases in which the libido fixates on different erogenous zones—first in the [[oral stage]] (exemplified by an infant's pleasure in nursing), then in the [[anal stage]] (exemplified by a toddler's pleasure in controlling his or her bowels), then in the [[phallic stage]], through a [[latency stage]] in which the libido is dormant, to its reemergence at puberty in the [[genital stage]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 2) p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Karl Abraham]] would later add subdivisions in both oral and anal stages.)&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946)p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud pointed out that these libidinal drives can conflict with the conventions of civilised behavior, represented in the psyche by the [[superego]]. It is this need to conform to society and control the libido that leads to tension and disturbance in the individual, prompting the use of [[ego defenses]] to dissipate the psychic energy of these unmet and mostly unconscious needs into other forms. Excessive use of ego defenses results in [[neurosis]]. A primary goal of [[psychoanalysis]] is to bring the drives of the id into [[consciousness]], allowing them to be met directly and thus reducing the patient's reliance on ego defenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud viewed libido as passing through a series of [[Psychosexual development|developmental stages]] within the individual. Failure to adequately adapt to the demands of these different stages could result in libidinal energy becoming 'dammed up' or [[Fixation (psychology)|fixated]] in these stages, producing certain pathological character traits in adulthood. Thus the psychopathologized individual for Freud was an immature individual, and the goal of psychoanalysis was to bring these fixations to conscious awareness so that the libido energy would be freed up and available for conscious use in some sort of constructive [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]].

===Analytical psychology===
According to Swiss psychiatrist [[Carl Jung|Carl Gustav Jung]], the libido is identified as the totality of psychic energy, not limited to sexual desire.&lt;ref&gt;P. Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 397&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://frithluton.com/articles/libido/ |title=Libido |last=Sharp |first=Daryl |date= |website=frithluton.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Jung states in "The Concept of Libido,"&lt;ref&gt;“The Concept of Libido,” Collected Works Vol. 5, par. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; "[libido] denotes a desire or impulse which is unchecked by any kind of authority, moral or otherwise. Libido is appetite in its natural state. From the genetic point of view it is bodily needs like hunger, thirst, sleep, and sex, and emotional states or affects, which constitute the essence of libido." The Duality (opposition) creates the energy (or libido) of the psyche, which Jung asserts expresses itself only through symbols: "It is the energy that manifests itself in the life process and is perceived subjectively as striving and desire." (Ellenberger, 697) These symbols may manifest as "fantasy-images" in the process of psychoanalysis which embody the contents of the libido, otherwise lacking in any definite form.&lt;ref&gt;“The Technique of Differentiation,” Collected Works Vol. 7, par. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; Desire, conceived generally as a psychic longing, movement, displacement and structuring, manifests itself in definable forms which are apprehended through analysis.

Defined more narrowly, libido also refers to an individual's urge to engage in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], and its [[antonym]] is the force of destruction termed [[mortido]] or [[destrudo]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalyis'' (1976) p. 69 and 101&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors that affect libido ==

=== Endogenous compounds ===
{{See also|Sexual motivation and hormones}}
Libido is governed primarily by activity in the [[mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic dopamine pathway]] ([[ventral tegmental area]] and [[nucleus accumbens]]).&lt;ref name="MEDRS review" /&gt;  Consequently, [[dopamine]] and related [[trace amine]]s (primarily [[phenethylamine]])&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Miller GM | title = The emerging role of trace amine-associated receptor 1 in the functional regulation of monoamine transporters and dopaminergic activity | journal = J.

These three behavioural repertoires appear to be based on brain systems that are largely distinct yet interrelated, and they interact in specific ways to orchestrate reproduction, using both hormones and monoamines.&amp;nbsp;... Animal studies indicate that elevated activity of dopaminergic pathways can stimulate a cascade of reactions, including the release of testosterone and oestrogen (Wenkstern et al. 1993; Kawashima &amp;Takagi 1994; Ferrari &amp; Giuliana 1995; Hull et al. 1995, 1997, 2002; Szezypka et al. 1998; Wersinger &amp; Rissman 2000). Likewise, increasing levels of testosterone and oestrogen promote dopamine release&amp;nbsp;...This positive relationship between elevated activity of central dopamine, elevated sex steroids and elevated sexual arousal and sexual performance (Herbert 1996; Fiorino et al. 1997; Liu et al. 1998; Pfaff 2005) also occurs in humans (Walker et al. 1993; Clayton et al. 2000; Heaton 2000).&amp;nbsp;... This parental attachment system has been associated with the activity of the neuropeptides, oxytocin (OT) in the nucleus accumbens and arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the ventral pallidum&amp;nbsp;... The activities of central oxytocin and vasopressin have been associated with both partner preference and attachment behaviours, while dopaminergic pathways have been associated more specifically with partner preference. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and sex hormones that affect sex drive by modulating activity in or acting upon this pathway include:

==== Sex hormone levels and the menstrual cycle ====
A woman's desire for sex is correlated to her [[menstrual cycle]], with many women experiencing a heightened sexual desire in the several days immediately before [[ovulation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Susan B. Bullivant |author2=Sarah A. Sellergren |author3=Kathleen Stern |title=Women's sexual experience during the menstrual cycle: identification of the sexual phase by noninvasive measurement of luteinizing hormone |journal=Journal of Sex Research |date=February 2004 |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=82–93 (in online article, see pp.14–15, 18–22) |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2372/is_1_41/ai_n6032944 |pmid=15216427 |doi=10.1080/00224490409552216 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |df= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070923001735/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2372/is_1_41/ai_n6032944 |archivedate=2007-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is her peak fertility period, which normally occurs two days before until two days after the ovulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duofertility.com/en/my-body/my-cycle/my-fertile-period.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221225600/http://www.duofertility.com/en/my-body/my-cycle/my-fertile-period.html |archivedate=2008-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This cycle has been associated with changes in a woman's [[testosterone]] levels during the menstrual cycle. According to Gabrielle Lichterman, testosterone levels have a direct impact on a woman's interest in sex. According to her, testosterone levels rise gradually from about the 24th day of a woman's menstrual cycle until ovulation on about the 14th day of the next cycle, and during this period the woman's desire for sex increases consistently. The 13th day is generally the day with the highest testosterone levels. In the week following ovulation, the testosterone level is the lowest and as a result women will experience less interest in sex.&lt;ref name="Lichterman"&gt;{{cite book|title=28 Days: What Your Cycle Reveals about Your Love Life, Moods, and Potential|first=Gabrielle|last=Lichterman|isbn=978-1-59337-345-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=October 2015}}

Also, during the week following ovulation, [[progesterone]] levels increase, resulting in a woman experiencing difficulty achieving [[orgasm]]. Although the last days of the menstrual cycle are marked by a constant testosterone level, women's libido may get a boost as a result of the thickening of the [[Endometrium|uterine lining]] which stimulates [[nerve endings]] and makes a woman feel aroused.&lt;ref name="C"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emaxhealth.com/48/4247.html |title=Women Can Now Predict When They Will Have The Best Sex |accessdate=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, during these days, [[estrogen]] levels decline, resulting in a decrease of [[vaginal lubrication|natural lubrication]].

Although some specialists disagree with this theory, [[menopause]] is still considered by the majority a factor that can cause decreased sex desire in women. The levels of [[estrogen]] decrease at menopause and this usually causes a lower interest in sex and vaginal dryness which makes intercourse painful. However, the levels of [[testosterone]] increase at menopause and this may be why some women may experience a contrary effect of an increased libido.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

=== Psychological and social factors ===
Certain psychological or social factors can reduce the desire for sex. These factors can include lack of privacy or [[intimacy]], [[stress (medicine)|stress]] or [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], distraction or depression. Environmental stress, such as prolonged exposure to [[noise health effects|elevated sound levels]] or [[over-illumination|bright light]], can also affect libido.  Other causes include experience of sexual abuse, assault, trauma, or neglect, body image issues, and anxiety about engaging in sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irvin D. Yalom|Yalom, I.D.]], ''Love's Executioner and Other Tales of Psychotherapy''. New York: Basic Books, 1989. {{ISBN|0-06-097334-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical factors ===
Physical factors that can affect libido include [[Endocrine system|endocrine]] issues such as [[hypothyroidism]], the effect of certain prescription medications (for example [[flutamide]]), and the attractiveness and biological fitness of one's partner, among various other lifestyle factors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19960101-000028.html Psychology Today – The orgasm Wars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002134500/http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19960101-000028.html |date=2007-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In males, the frequency of ejaculations affects the levels of serum testosterone, a hormone which promotes libido. A study of 28 males aged 21–45 found that all but one of them had a peak (145.7% of baseline [117.8%–197.3%]) in serum testosterone on the 7th day of abstinence from ejaculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Anemia]] is a cause of lack of libido in women due to the loss of [[iron]] during the period.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/sex_relationships/facts/lackingsexdrive.htm |title=Lack of sex drive in men (lack of libido) |accessdate=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Smoking]], [[alcohol abuse]], and the use of certain drugs can also lead to a decreased libido.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}  Moreover, specialists suggest that several lifestyle changes such as [[exercising]], [[quitting smoking]], lowering consumption of alcohol or using prescription drugs may help increase one's sexual desire.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==== Medications ====

Some people purposefully attempt to increase their libido through the usage of [[anaphrodisiac]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rebal Jr, Ronald F., Robert A. Faguet, and Sherwyn M. Woods. "Unusual sexual syndromes." Extraordinary Disorders of Human Behavior. Springer US, 1982. 121-154.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aphrodisiac]]s, such as [[dopaminergic]] psychostimulants, are a class of drugs which can increase libido. On the other hand, a reduced libido is also often [[iatrogenic]] and can be caused by many medications, such as [[hormonal contraception]], [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]]s and other [[antidepressants]], [[antipsychotic]]s, [[opioid]]s and [[beta blocker]]s.

== Sexual desire disorders ==
{{See also|Hypoactive sexual desire disorder|Hypersexuality}}

There is no widely accepted measure of what is a healthy level for sex desire. Some people want to have sex every day, or more than once a day; others once a year or not at all. However, a person who lacks a desire for sexual activity for some period of time may be experiencing a [[hypoactive sexual desire disorder]] or may be [[asexuality|asexual]]. A sexual desire disorder is more common in women than in men.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} [[Erectile dysfunction]] may happen to the penis because of lack of sexual desire, but these two should not be confused.&lt;ref name="malelacksexdrive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/sex_relationships/facts/malelacksexdrive.htm |title=Lack of sex drive in men (lack of libido) |accessdate=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, large recreational doses of [[amphetamine]] or [[methamphetamine]] can simultaneously cause erectile dysfunction and significantly increase libido.&lt;ref name="Human amph effects"&gt;{{cite book | author=Gunne LM | title=Drug Addiction II: Amphetamine, Psychotogen, and Marihuana Dependence | date=2013 | publisher=Springer | location=Berlin, Germany; Heidelberg, Germany | isbn=9783642667091 | pages=247–260 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gb_uCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA247#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate=4 December 2015 | chapter=Effects of Amphetamines in Humans | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, men can also experience a decrease in their libido as they age.

The [[American Medical Association]] has estimated that several million US women suffer from a [[female sexual arousal disorder]], though arousal is not at all synonymous with desire, so this finding is of limited relevance to the discussion of libido.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt; Some specialists claim that women may experience low libido due to some hormonal abnormalities such as lack of [[luteinising hormone]] or androgenic hormones, although these theories are still controversial. Also, women commonly lack sexual desire in the period immediately after giving [[birth]]. Moreover, any condition affecting the [[genital area]] can make women reject the idea of having [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]]. It has been estimated that half of women experience different health problems in the area of the [[vagina]] and [[vulva]], such as thinning, tightening, dryness or [[atrophy]]. [[Frustration]] may appear as a result of these issues and because many of them lead to painful sexual intercourse, many women prefer not having sex at all. [[Surgery]] or major health conditions such as [[arthritis]], [[cancer]], [[diabetes]], [[high blood pressure]], [[coronary artery disease]] or [[infertility]] may have the same effect in women.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/low-sex-drive-in-women/DS01043/DSECTION=causes |title=Low sex drive in women |accessdate=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surgery that affects the hormonal levels in women include [[Oophorectomy|oophorectomies]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4445">[[File:Logical-hexagon.png|thumb|250px|right|The logical hexagon extends the [[square of opposition]] to six statements.]]

The '''logical hexagon''' (also called the '''hexagon of opposition''') is a [[conceptual model]] of the relationships between the [[truth value]]s of six [[statement (logic)|statement]]s. It is an extension of [[Aristotle]]'s [[square of opposition]]. It was discovered independently by both [[Augustin Sesmat]] and [[Robert Blanché]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://alessiomoretti.perso.sfr.fr/NOTLogicalHexagon.html N-opposition theory ''logical hexagon'']&lt;/ref&gt;

This extension consists in introducing two statements '''U''' and '''Y'''. Whereas '''U''' is the [[Logical disjunction|disjunction]] of '''A''' and '''E''', '''Y''' is the [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] of the two traditional particulars '''I''' and '''O'''.

== Summary of relationships ==

The traditional square of opposition demonstrates two sets of contradictories '''A''' and '''O''', and '''E''' and '''I''' (i.e. they cannot both be true and cannot both be false), two contraries '''A''' and '''E''' (i.e. they can both be false, but cannot both be true), and two subcontraries '''I''' and '''O''' (i.e. they can both be true, but cannot both be false) according to Aristotle’s definitions. However, the logical hexagon provides that '''U''' and '''Y''' are also contradictory.

== Interpretations of the logical hexagon ==

The logical hexagon may be interpreted in various ways, including as a model of traditional logic, quantifications, modal logic, order theory, or paraconsistent logic.

For instance, the statement A may be interpreted as "Whatever x may be, if x is a man, then x is white."

    (x)(M(x) → W(x))

The statement E may be interpreted as "Whatever x may be, if x is a man, then x is non-white."

    (x)(M(x) → ~W(x))

The statement I may be interpreted as "There exists at least one x that is both a man and white."

    (∃x)(M(x) &amp; W(x))

The statement O may be interpreted as "There exists at least one x that is both a man and non-white"

    (∃x)(M(x) &amp; ~W(x))

The statement Y may be interpreted as "There exists at least one x that is both a man and white and there exists at least one x that is both a man and non-white"

    (∃x)(M(x) &amp; W(x)) &amp; (∃x)(M(x) &amp; ~W(x))

The statement U may be interpreted as "One of two things, either whatever x may be, if x is a man, then x is white or whatever x may be, if x is a man, then x is non-white."

    (x)(M(x) → W(x)) w (x)(M(x) → ~W(x)) 

The logical hexagon may be interpreted in various ways, including as a model of traditional logic, quantifications, modal logic, order theory, or paraconsistent logic.



=== Modal logic ===

The logical hexagon may be interpreted as a model of modal logic such that

* '''A''' is interpreted as [[necessary and sufficient condition|necessity]]
* '''E''' is interpreted as impossibility
* '''I''' is interpreted as [[logical possibility|possibility]]
* '''O''' is interpreted as 'not necessarily'
* '''U''' is interpreted as non-contingency
* '''Y''' is interpreted as [[contingency (philosophy)|contingency]]

== Further extension ==
It has been proven that both the square and the hexagon, followed by a “[[logical cube]]”, belong to a regular series of n-dimensional objects called “logical bi-simplexes of dimension n.” The pattern also goes even beyond this.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, Pellissier&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''many-worlds interpretation''' is an [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretation of quantum mechanics]] that asserts the [[Philosophical realism|objective reality]] of the [[universal wavefunction]] and denies the actuality of [[wavefunction collapse]]. Many-worlds implies that all [[probability|possible]] alternate histories and futures are real, each representing an actual "world" (or "universe").

The theory is also referred to as '''MWI''', the '''relative state formulation''', the '''Everett interpretation''', the '''theory of the universal wavefunction''', '''many-universes interpretation''',  '''multiverse theory''' or just '''many-worlds'''.

The original relative state formulation is due to [[Hugh Everett III|Hugh Everett]] in 1957.&lt;ref name=everett56&gt;[[Hugh Everett]] [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/manyworlds/pdf/dissertation.pdf Theory of the Universal Wavefunction], Thesis, Princeton University, (1956, 1973), pp 1–140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=everett57&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Everett | first1 = Hugh | authorlink = Hugh Everett | year = 1957 | title = Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics | url = http://www.univer.omsk.su/omsk/Sci/Everett/paper1957.html | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 454–462 | bibcode = 1957RvMP...29..454E | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.29.454 | access-date = 2011-10-24 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111027191052/http://www.univer.omsk.su/omsk/Sci/Everett/paper1957.html | archive-date = 2011-10-27 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, this formulation was popularized and renamed ''many-worlds'' by [[Bryce Seligman DeWitt]] in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name=dewitt71&gt;[[Bryce Seligman DeWitt]], Quantum Mechanics and Reality: Could the solution to the dilemma of indeterminism be a universe in which all possible outcomes of an experiment actually occur?, ''Physics Today'', 23(9) pp 30–40 (September 1970) "every quantum transition taking place on every star, in every galaxy, in every remote corner of the universe is splitting our local world on earth into myriads of copies of itself."

MWI is one of many [[Multiverse|multiverse hypotheses]] in [[physics]] and [[philosophy]]. It is currently considered a mainstream interpretation along with the other decoherence interpretations, [[collapse theory|collapse theories]] (including the historical [[Copenhagen interpretation]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/everett.ps The Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hidden variable theories]] such as the [[De Broglie–Bohm theory|Bohmian mechanics]].

Before many-worlds, reality had always been viewed as a single unfolding history. Many-worlds, however, views historical reality as a many-branched tree, wherein every possible quantum outcome is realised.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Deutsch]] argues that a great deal of fiction is close to a fact somewhere in the so called [[multiverse]], ''Beginning of Infinity'', p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; Many-worlds reconciles the observation of non-[[Determinism|deterministic]] events, such as [[Radioactive decay|random radioactive decay]], with the fully deterministic [[partial differential equations|equations]] of [[quantum physics]].

In many-worlds, the [[Phenomenalism|subjective appearance]] of wavefunction collapse is explained by the mechanism of [[quantum decoherence]], and this is supposed to resolve all of the [[quantum paradox|correlation paradoxes]] of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], such as the [[EPR paradox]]&lt;ref name=dewitt73paradox&gt;[[Bryce Seligman DeWitt]], [[R.

==Origin==
In Dublin in 1952 [[Erwin Schrödinger]] gave a lecture in which at one point he jocularly warned his audience that what he was about to say might "seem lunatic". He went on to assert that what the [[Schrödinger equation|equation]] that won him a Nobel prize seems to be describing is several different histories, they are "not alternatives but all really happen simultaneously". This is the earliest known reference to the many-worlds.&lt;ref&gt;David Deutsch. The Beginning of infinity. Page 310.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/9188438/Erwin-Schrodinger-and-the-Quantum-Revolution-by-John-Gribbin-review.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline==
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Hugh-Everett.jpg|188px|thumb|right|Hugh Everett III (1930–1982) was the first [[physicist]] who proposed the many-worlds interpretation (MWI) of [[quantum physics]], which he termed his "relative state" formulation.]] --&gt;
Although several versions of many-worlds have been proposed since [[Hugh Everett III|Hugh Everett]]'s original work,&lt;ref name=everett57/&gt; they all contain one key idea: the equations of physics that model the time evolution of systems ''without'' embedded observers are sufficient for modelling systems which ''do'' contain observers; in particular there is no observation-triggered [[wave function collapse]] which the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] proposes. Provided the theory is [[linear]] with respect to the wavefunction, the exact form of the [[quantum]] dynamics modelled, be it the non-relativistic [[Schrödinger equation]], [[relativistic quantum field theory]] or some form of [[quantum gravity]] or [[string theory]], does not alter the validity of MWI since MWI is a [[metatheory]] applicable to all linear [[quantum mechanics|quantum theories]], and there is no experimental evidence for any non-linearity of the wavefunction in physics.&lt;ref name="weinberglinearitydoft"/&gt;&lt;ref name="weinberglinearityannalsop"/&gt; MWI's main conclusion is that the universe (or [[multiverse]] in this context) is composed of a [[quantum superposition]] of very many, possibly even [[Uncountable set|non-denumerably]] [[Infinity|infinitely]]&lt;ref name="Heresy"/&gt; many, increasingly divergent, non-communicating parallel universes or quantum worlds.&lt;ref name=dewitt73/&gt;

The idea of MWI originated in Everett's [[Princeton University|Princeton]] [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] thesis "The Theory of the [[Universal Wavefunction]]",&lt;ref name=dewitt73/&gt; developed under his thesis advisor [[John Archibald Wheeler]], a shorter summary of which was published in 1957 entitled "Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics" (Wheeler contributed the title "relative state";&lt;ref name=wheeler&gt;[[John Archibald Wheeler]], ''Geons, Black Holes &amp; Quantum Foam'', {{ISBN|0-393-31991-1}}. pp 268–270&lt;/ref&gt; Everett originally called his approach the "Correlation Interpretation", where "correlation" refers to [[quantum entanglement]]). The phrase "many-worlds" is due to [[Bryce DeWitt]],&lt;ref name=dewitt73/&gt; who was responsible for the wider popularisation of Everett's theory, which had been largely ignored for the first decade after publication. DeWitt's phrase "many-worlds" has become so much more popular than Everett's "Universal Wavefunction" or Everett–Wheeler's "Relative State Formulation" that many forget that this is only a difference of terminology; the content of both of Everett's papers and DeWitt's popular article is the same.

The many-worlds interpretation shares many similarities with later, other "post-Everett" interpretations of quantum mechanics which also use [[decoherence]] to explain the process of measurement or wavefunction collapse. MWI treats the other histories or worlds as real since it regards the universal wavefunction as the "basic physical entity"&lt;ref name="reality wf57"&gt;Everett 1957, section 3, 2nd paragraph, 1st sentence&lt;/ref&gt; or "the fundamental entity, obeying at all times a deterministic wave equation".&lt;ref name="reality wf73"&gt;Everett [1956]1973, "Theory of the Universal Wavefunction", chapter 6 (e)&lt;/ref&gt; The other decoherent interpretations, such as [[consistent histories]], the [[Existential Interpretation]] etc., either regard the extra quantum worlds as metaphorical in some sense, or are [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] about their reality; it is sometimes hard to distinguish between the different varieties. MWI is distinguished by two qualities: it assumes [[philosophical realism|realism]],&lt;ref name="reality wf57"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reality wf73"/&gt; which it assigns to the wavefunction, and it has the minimal formal structure possible, rejecting any [[hidden variable theory|hidden variables]], [[quantum potential]], any form of a collapse postulate (i.e., [[Copenhagen Interpretation|Copenhagenism]]) or mental postulates (such as the [[many-minds interpretation]] makes).

Decoherent interpretations of many-worlds using [[einselection]] to explain how a small number of classical [[pointer state]]s can emerge from the enormous [[Hilbert space]] of superpositions have been proposed by [[Wojciech H. Zurek]]. "Under scrutiny of the environment, only pointer states remain unchanged. Other states decohere into mixtures of stable pointer states that can persist, and, in this sense, exist: They are einselected."&lt;ref name="ZurekNature2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zurek | first = Wojciech | authorlink = Wojciech Hubert Zurek | title = Quantum Darwinism | date = March 2009 | arxiv = 0903.5082 |bibcode = 2009NatPh...5..181Z |doi = 10.1038/nphys1202 | volume=5 | issue=3 | journal=Nature Physics | pages=181–188}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas complement MWI and bring the interpretation in line with our perception of reality.

Many-worlds is often referred to as a [[theory]], rather than just an interpretation, by those who propose that many-worlds can make testable predictions (such as [[David Deutsch]]) or is [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] (such as Everett) or by those who propose that all the other, non-MW interpretations, are inconsistent, illogical or unscientific in their handling of measurements; [[Hugh Everett]] argued that his formulation was a [[metatheory]], since it made statements about other interpretations of quantum theory; that it was the "only completely coherent approach to explaining both the contents of quantum mechanics and the appearance of the world."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/everett/ Everett&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Deutsch is dismissive that many-worlds is an "interpretation", saying that calling it an interpretation "is like talking about dinosaurs as an 'interpretation' of fossil records."&lt;ref name="MAD"/&gt;

==Interpreting wavefunction collapse==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
As with the other interpretations of quantum mechanics, the many-worlds interpretation is motivated by behavior that can be illustrated by the [[double-slit experiment]]. When [[photon|particles of light]] (or anything else) are passed through the double slit, a calculation assuming wave-like behavior of light can be used to identify where the particles are likely to be observed. Yet when the particles are observed in this experiment, they appear as particles (i.e., at definite places) and not as non-localized waves.

Some versions of the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics proposed a process of "[[wavefunction collapse|collapse]]" in which an indeterminate quantum system would probabilistically collapse down onto, or select, just one determinate outcome to "explain" this phenomenon of observation. Wavefunction collapse was widely regarded as artificial and ''[[ad hoc]]''{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}, so an alternative interpretation in which the behavior of measurement could be understood from more fundamental physical principles was considered desirable.

Everett's Ph.D. work provided such an alternative interpretation. Everett stated that for a composite system &amp;ndash; for example a subject (the "observer" or measuring apparatus) observing an object (the "observed" system, such as a particle) &amp;ndash; the statement that either the observer or the observed has a well-defined state is meaningless; in modern parlance, the observer and the observed have become [[quantum entanglement|entangled]]; we can only specify the state of one ''relative'' to the other, i.e., the state of the observer and the observed are correlated ''after'' the observation is made. This led Everett to derive from the unitary, deterministic dynamics alone (i.e., without assuming wavefunction collapse) the notion of a ''relativity of states''.

Everett noticed that the unitary, deterministic dynamics alone decreed that after an observation is made each element of the [[quantum superposition]] of the combined subject–object wavefunction contains two "relative states": a "collapsed" object state and an associated observer who has observed the same collapsed outcome; what the observer sees and the state of the object have become correlated by the act of measurement or observation. The subsequent evolution of each pair of relative subject–object states proceeds with complete indifference as to the presence or absence of the other elements, ''as if'' wavefunction collapse has occurred, which has the consequence that later observations are always consistent with the earlier observations. Thus the ''appearance'' of the object's wavefunction's collapse has emerged from the unitary, deterministic theory itself. (This answered Einstein's early criticism of quantum theory, that the theory should define what is observed, not for the observables to define the theory).&lt;ref name="einstein26"&gt;"Whether you can observe a thing or not depends on the theory which you use. It is the theory which decides what can be observed." [[Albert Einstein]] to [[Werner Heisenberg]], objecting to placing observables at the heart of the new quantum mechanics, during Heisenberg's 1926 lecture at Berlin; related by Heisenberg in 1968, quoted by [[Abdus Salam]], ''Unification of Fundamental Forces'', Cambridge University Press (1990) {{ISBN|0-521-37140-6}}, pp 98–101&lt;/ref&gt; Since the wavefunction merely appears to have collapsed then, Everett reasoned, there was no need to actually assume that it had collapsed. And so, invoking [[Occam's razor]], he removed the postulate of wavefunction collapse from the theory.

==The unreal/real interpretation==

According to [[Martin Gardner]], the "other" worlds of MWI have two different interpretations: real or unreal; he claims that [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Steven Weinberg]] both favour the unreal interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071021033103/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_3_26/ai_85932634 A response to Bryce DeWitt], Martin Gardner, May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner also claims that the nonreal interpretation is favoured by the majority of physicists, whereas the "realist" view is only supported by MWI experts such as Deutsch and [[Bryce DeWitt]]. Hawking has said that "according to Feynman's idea", all the other histories are as "equally real" as our own,&lt;ref name="hawkingreal"&gt;Award winning 1995 Channel 4 documentary "Reality on the rocks: Beyond our Ken" {{cite web|url=http://www.windfallfilms.com/html/awards.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022030220/http://www.windfallfilms.com/html/awards.htm |archivedate=2007-10-22 |df= }} where, in response to [[Ken Campbell]]'s question "all these trillions of Universes of the Multiverse, are they as real as this one seems to be to me?" Hawking states, "Yes.... According to Feynman's idea, every possible history (of Ken) is equally real."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martin Gardner]] reports Hawking saying that MWI is "trivially true".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gardner | first = Martin | authorlink = Martin Gardner | title = Are universes thicker than blackberries? | publisher = W.W.

In the same interview, he also said, "But, look: All that one does, really, is to calculate conditional probabilities—in other words, the probability of A happening, given B. I think that that's all the many worlds interpretation is. Some people overlay it with a lot of mysticism about the wave function splitting into different parts. But all that you're calculating is conditional probabilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ferris | first = Timothy | authorlink = Timothy Ferris | title = The Whole Shebang | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | year= 1997 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=qjYbQ7EBAKwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA345#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 345] | isbn = 978-0-684-81020-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere Hawking contrasted his attitude towards the "reality" of physical theories with that of his colleague [[Roger Penrose]], saying, "He's a [[Platonic realism|Platonist]] and I'm a [[Positivism|positivist]]. He's worried that Schrödinger's cat is in a quantum state, where it is half alive and half dead. He feels that can't correspond to reality. But that doesn't bother me. I don't demand that a theory correspond to reality because I don't know what it is. Reality is not a quality you can test with litmus paper. All I'm concerned with is that the theory should predict the results of measurements. Quantum theory does this very successfully."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hawking | first = Stephen |author2=Roger Penrose | title = The Nature of Space and Time | publisher = Princeton University Press | year= 1996 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=LstaQTXP65cC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA121#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 121] | isbn = 978-0-691-03791-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his own part, Penrose agrees with Hawking that QM applied to the universe implies MW, although he considers the current lack of a successful theory of [[quantum gravity]] negates the claimed universality of conventional QM.&lt;ref name="penrose"&gt;{{cite web|last=Penrose |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Penrose |title=Roger Penrose Looks Beyond the Classic-Quantum Dichotomy |publisher=Sciencewatch |date=August 1991 |url=http://www.sciencewatch.com/interviews/roger_penrose2.htm |accessdate=2007-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023063403/http://www.sciencewatch.com/interviews/roger_penrose2.htm |archivedate=2007-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similarities with the de Broglie–Bohm interpretation===
Kim Joris Boström has proposed a non-relativistic quantum mechanical theory that combines elements of the de Broglie–Bohm mechanics and that of Everett’s many-‘worlds’. In particular, the unreal MW interpretation of Hawking and Weinberg is similar to the Bohmian concept of unreal empty branch ‘worlds’:

{{quote|The second issue with Bohmian mechanics may at first sight appear rather harmless, but which on a closer look develops considerable destructive power: the issue of empty branches. These are the components of the post-measurement state that do not guide any particles because they do not have the actual configuration ''q'' in their support. At first sight, the empty branches do not appear problematic but on the contrary very helpful as they enable the theory to explain unique outcomes of measurements. Also, they seem to explain why there is an effective “collapse of the wavefunction”, as in ordinary quantum mechanics. On a closer view, though, one must admit that these empty branches do not actually disappear. As the wavefunction is taken to describe a really existing field, all their branches really exist and will evolve forever by the Schrödinger dynamics, no matter how many of them will become empty in the course of the evolution. Every branch of the global wavefunction potentially describes a complete world which is, according to Bohm’s ontology, only a possible world that would be the actual world if only it were filled with particles, and which is in every respect identical to a corresponding world in Everett’s theory. Only one branch at a time is occupied by particles, thereby representing the actual world, while all other branches, though really existing as part of a really existing wavefunction, are empty and thus contain some sort of “zombie worlds” with planets, oceans, trees, cities, cars and people who talk like us and behave like us, but who do not actually exist. Now, if the Everettian theory may be accused of ontological extravagance, then Bohmian mechanics could be accused of ontological wastefulness. On top of the ontology of empty branches comes the additional ontology of particle positions that are, on account of the quantum equilibrium hypothesis, forever unknown to the observer. Yet, the actual configuration is never needed for the calculation of the statistical predictions in experimental reality, for these can be obtained by mere wavefunction algebra. From this perspective, Bohmian mechanics may appear as a wasteful and redundant theory. I think it is considerations like these that are the biggest obstacle in the way of a general acceptance of Bohmian mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint=1208.5632|author1=Kim Joris Boström|title=Combining Bohm and Everett: Axiomatics for a Standalone Quantum Mechanics|class=quant-ph|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Probability===
Attempts have been made, by many-world advocates and others, over the years to ''derive'' the [[Born rule]], rather than just conventionally ''assume'' it, so as to reproduce all the required statistical behaviour associated with quantum mechanics. There is no consensus on whether this has been successful.&lt;ref&gt;N.P. Landsman, [http://www.math.ru.nl/~landsman/Born.pdf "The conclusion seems to be that no generally accepted derivation of the Born rule has been given to date, but this does not imply that such a derivation is impossible in principle."], in ''Compendium of Quantum Physics'' (eds.)

Falkenburg (Springer, 2008), {{ISBN|3-540-70622-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|arxiv=0905.0624|last1=Kent|first1=Adrian|chapter=One world versus many: The inadequacy of Everettian accounts of evolution, probability, and scientific confirmation|title=Many Worlds?

===Frequency-based approaches===
Everett (1957) briefly derived the Born rule by showing that the Born rule was the only possible rule, and that its derivation was as justified as the procedure for defining probability in [[classical mechanics]]. Everett stopped doing research in theoretical physics shortly after obtaining his Ph.D., but his work on probability has been extended by a number of people. [[Andrew Gleason]] (1957) and [[James Hartle]] (1965) independently reproduced Everett's work&lt;ref&gt;[[James Hartle]], Quantum Mechanics of Individual Systems, ''American Journal of Physics'', 1968, vol 36 (#8), pp. 704–712&lt;/ref&gt; which was later extended.&lt;ref&gt;E. Farhi, J. Goldstone &amp; S. Gutmann. ''How probability arises in quantum mechanics.'', Ann. Phys. (N.Y.) 192, 368–382 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bryce DeWitt]] and his doctoral student R. Neill Graham later provided alternative (and longer) derivations to Everett's derivation of the Born rule.&lt;ref name="dewitt73"/&gt; They demonstrated that the [[Normed vector space|norm]] of the worlds where the usual statistical rules of quantum theory broke down vanished, in the limit where the number of measurements went to infinity.

==MWI overview==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Many-worlds-bloch.png|thumb|400px|Schematic representation of pair of "smallest possible" quantum mechanical systems prior to interaction: Measured system '''S''' and measurement apparatus '''M'''. Systems such as '''S''' are referred to as 1-[[qubit]] systems.]] --&gt;
In Everett's formulation, a measuring apparatus '''M''' and an object system '''S''' form a composite system, each of which prior to measurement exists in well-defined (but time-dependent) states. Measurement is regarded as causing '''M''' and '''S''' to interact. After '''S''' interacts with '''M''', it is no longer possible to describe either system by an independent state. According to Everett, the only meaningful descriptions of each system are relative states: for example the relative state of '''S''' given the state of '''M''' or the relative state of '''M''' given the state of '''S'''. In DeWitt's formulation, the state of '''S''' after a sequence of measurements is given by a quantum superposition of states, each one corresponding to an alternative measurement history of '''S'''.

[[Image:Splittings-1.png|thumb|left|350px|Schematic illustration of splitting as a result of a repeated measurement.]]
For example, consider the smallest possible truly quantum system '''S''', as shown in the illustration. This describes for instance, the spin-state of an electron. Considering a specific axis (say the ''z''-axis) the north pole represents spin "up" and the south pole, spin "down". The superposition states of the system are described by (the surface of) a sphere called the [[Bloch sphere]]. To perform a measurement on '''S''', it is made to interact with another similar system '''M'''. After the interaction, the combined system is described by a state that ranges over a six-dimensional space (the reason for the number six is explained in the article on the Bloch sphere). This six-dimensional object can also be regarded as a quantum superposition of two "alternative histories" of the original system '''S''', one in which "up" was observed and the other in which "down" was observed. Each subsequent binary measurement (that is interaction with a system '''M''') causes a similar split in the history tree. Thus after three measurements, the system can be regarded as a quantum superposition of 8 = 2 × 2 × 2 copies of the original system '''S'''.

The accepted terminology is somewhat misleading because it is incorrect to regard the universe as splitting at certain times; at any given instant there is one state in one universe.

===Relative state===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
In his 1957 doctoral dissertation, Everett proposed that rather than modeling an isolated quantum system subject to external observation, one could mathematically model an object as well as its observers as purely physical systems within the mathematical framework developed by [[Paul Dirac]], [[von Neumann]] and others, discarding altogether the ''ad hoc'' mechanism of [[wave function collapse]].

Since Everett's original work, there have appeared a number of similar formalisms in the literature. One such is the relative state formulation. It makes two assumptions: first, the wavefunction is not simply a description of the object's state, but that it actually is entirely equivalent to the object, a claim it has in common with some other interpretations. Secondly, observation or measurement has no special laws or mechanics, unlike in the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] which considers the wavefunction collapse as a special kind of event which occurs as a result of observation. Instead, measurement in the relative state formulation is the consequence of a configuration change in the memory of an observer described by the same basic wave physics as the object being modeled.

The many-worlds interpretation is DeWitt's popularisation of Everett's work, who had referred to the combined observer–object system as being split by an observation, each split corresponding to the different or multiple possible outcomes of an observation. These splits generate a possible tree as shown in the graphic below. Subsequently, DeWitt introduced the term "world" to describe a complete measurement history of an observer, which corresponds roughly to a single branch of that tree. Note that "splitting" in this sense is hardly new or even quantum mechanical. The idea of a space of complete alternative histories had already been used in the theory of probability since the mid-1930s for instance to model [[Brownian motion]]. [[Image:Many-worlds.svg|thumb|300px|Partial trace as relative state. Light blue rectangle on upper left denotes system in pure state. Trellis shaded rectangle in upper right denotes a (possibly) mixed state. Mixed state from observation is partial trace of a linear superposition of states as shown in lower right-hand corner.]][[Image:Paths-many-worlds.svg|thumb|right|300px|Successive measurements with successive splittings]]

Under the many-worlds interpretation, the [[Schrödinger equation]], or relativistic analog, holds all the time everywhere. An observation or measurement is modeled by applying the wave equation to the entire system comprising the observer ''and'' the object. One consequence is that every observation can be thought of as causing the combined observer–object's wavefunction to change into a quantum superposition of two or more non-interacting branches, or split into many "worlds". Since many observation-like events have happened and are constantly happening, there are an enormous and growing number of simultaneously existing states.

If a system is composed of two or more subsystems, the system's state will be a superposition of products of the subsystems' states. Each product of subsystem states in the overall superposition evolves over time independently of other products. Once the subsystems interact, their states have become correlated or [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] and it is no longer possible to consider them independent of one another. In Everett's terminology each subsystem state was now ''correlated'' with its ''relative state'', since each subsystem must now be considered relative to the other subsystems with which it has interacted.

===Properties of the theory===

MWI removes the observer-dependent role in the [[quantum measurement]] process by replacing [[wavefunction collapse]] with [[quantum decoherence]]. Since the role of the observer lies at the heart of most if not all "quantum paradoxes," this automatically resolves a number of problems; see for example [[Schrödinger's cat]] [[thought experiment]], the [[EPR paradox]], [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]]'s "boundary problem" and even [[wave-particle duality]]. [[Quantum cosmology]] also becomes intelligible, since there is no need anymore for an observer outside of the universe.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

MWI is a [[philosophical realism|realist]], [[deterministic]], arguably [[local realism|local]] theory, akin to [[classical physics]] (including the [[theory of relativity]]), at the expense of losing [[counterfactual definiteness]]. MWI achieves this by removing [[wavefunction collapse]], which is indeterministic and non-local, from the [[deterministic]] and [[local realism|local]] equations of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]].&lt;ref name=rubinlocality&gt;[[Mark A. Rubin]], Locality in the Everett Interpretation of Heisenberg-Picture Quantum Mechanics, ''Foundations of Physics Letters'', 14, (2001) , pp.&amp;nbsp;301–322, {{arxiv|quant-ph/0103079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MWI (or other, broader [[multiverse]] considerations) provides a context for the [[anthropic principle]] which may provide an explanation for the [[fine-tuned universe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul C.W. Davies]], ''Other Worlds'', chapters 8 &amp; 9 ''The Anthropic Principle'' &amp; ''Is the Universe an accident?'', (1980) {{ISBN|0-460-04400-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul C.W. Davies]], ''The Accidental Universe'', (1982) {{ISBN|0-521-28692-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MWI, being a [[quantum decoherence|decoherent]] formulation, is axiomatically more streamlined than the [[Copenhagen Interpretation|Copenhagen]] and other [[wavefunction collapse|collapse]] interpretations; and thus favoured under certain interpretations of [[Occam's razor]].&lt;ref name="FAQ occam"/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2013}} Of course there are other decoherent interpretations that also possess this advantage with respect to the collapse interpretations.

===Comparative properties and possible experimental tests===
One of the salient properties of the many-worlds interpretation is that it does not require an exceptional method of wave function collapse to explain it. "It seems that there is no experiment distinguishing the MWI from other no-collapse theories such as [[Bohmian mechanics]] or other variants of MWI... In most no-collapse interpretations, the evolution of the quantum state of the Universe is the same. Still, one might imagine that there is an experiment distinguishing the MWI from another no-collapse interpretation based on the difference in the correspondence between the formalism and the experience (the results of experiments)."&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web |last=Vaidman |first=Lev |title=Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/ |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1985, David Deutsch published three related thought experiments which could test the theory vs the Copenhagen interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, D., (1986) 'Three experimental implications of the Everett interpretation', in R. Penrose and C.J. Isham (eds.), Quantum Concepts of Space and Time, Oxford: The Clarendon Press, pp. 204–214.&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments require macroscopic quantum state preparation and [[quantum erasure]] by a hypothetical quantum computer which is currently outside experimental possibility. Since then Lockwood (1989), Vaidman and others have made similar proposals.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt; These proposals also require an advanced technology which is able to place a macroscopic object in a coherent superposition, another task which it is uncertain will ever be possible to perform. Many other controversial ideas have been put forward though, such as a recent claim that cosmological observations could test the theory,&lt;ref&gt;Page, D., (2000) '[http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/0001001 Can Quantum Cosmology Give Observational Consequences of Many-Worlds Quantum Theory?]'&lt;/ref&gt; and another claim by Rainer Plaga (1997), published in ''[[Foundations of Physics]]'', that communication might be possible between worlds.&lt;ref name="plaga"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Plaga | first1 = R. | year = 1997 | title =  On a possibility to find experimental evidence for the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics| url = | journal = Foundations of Physics | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 559–577 |arxiv = quant-ph/9510007 |bibcode = 1997FoPh...27..559P |doi = 10.1007/BF02550677 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copenhagen interpretation===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
In the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], the mathematics of quantum mechanics allows one to predict [[probability|probabilities]] for the occurrence of various events. When an event occurs, it becomes part of the definite reality, and alternative possibilities do not. There is no necessity to say anything definite about what is not observed.

===The universe decaying to a new vacuum state===
Any event that changes the number of observers in the universe may have experimental consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Page, Don N. |doi=10.1063/1.1301589 |title=Can Quantum Cosmology Give Observational Consequences of Many-Worlds Quantum Theory? |year=2000|arxiv = gr-qc/0001001 |journal=Eighth Canadian conference on general relativity and relativistic astrophysics|volume=493 |pages=225 |isbn=156396905X |bibcode=1999AIPC..493..225P }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quantum tunnelling]] to a new [[vacuum state]] would reduce the number of observers to zero (i.e., kill all life).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Some [[Physical cosmology|cosmologists]]{{citation needed|reason=Who?|date=March 2015}} argue that the [[universe]] is in a [[False vacuum|false vacuum state]] and that consequently the universe should have already experienced quantum tunnelling to a true vacuum state. This has not happened and is cited as evidence in favor of many-worlds. In some worlds, quantum tunnelling to a true vacuum state has happened but most other worlds escape this tunneling and remain viable. This can be thought of as a variation on [[Quantum suicide and immortality|quantum suicide]].

===Many-minds===
{{Main|Many-minds interpretation}}
The ''many-minds'' interpretation is a multi-world interpretation that defines the splitting of reality on the level of the observers' minds.  In this, it differs from Everett's many-worlds interpretation, in which there is no special role for the observer's mind.&lt;ref name="plaga" /&gt;

==Common objections==
The many-worlds interpretation is very vague about the ways to determine when splitting happens, and nowadays usually the criterion is that the two branches have [[Quantum decoherence|decohered]]. However, present day understanding of decoherence does not allow a completely precise, self-contained way to say when the two branches have decohered/"do not interact", and hence many-worlds interpretation remains arbitrary. This objection is saying that it is not clear what is precisely meant by branching, and point to the lack of self-contained criteria specifying branching.
::MWI response: the decoherence or "splitting" or "branching" is complete when the [[quantum measurement|measurement]] is complete. In [[Bra–ket notation|Dirac notation]] a measurement is complete when:
:::&lt;math&gt;\lang O_i|O_j\rang = \delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=dewitt71ortho&gt;[[Bryce Seligman DeWitt]], Quantum Mechanics and Reality: Could the solution to the dilemma of indeterminism be a universe in which all possible outcomes of an experiment actually occur?, ''Physics Today'', 23(9) pp 30–40 (September 1970); see equation 10&lt;/ref&gt;
::where &lt;math&gt;O_i&lt;/math&gt; represents the observer having detected the object system in the ''i''th state. Before the measurement has started the observer states are identical; after the measurement is complete the observer states are [[Orthonormality|orthonormal]].&lt;ref name=everett57/&gt;&lt;ref name=dewitt73/&gt; Thus a measurement defines the branching process: the branching is as well- or ill-defined as the measurement is; the branching is as complete as the measurement is complete – which is to say that the delta function above represents an idealised measurement. Although true "for all practical purposes" in reality the measurement, and hence the branching, is never fully complete, since delta functions are unphysical,&lt;ref&gt;Penrose, R. ''The Road to Reality'', §21.11&lt;/ref&gt;
::Since the role of the observer and measurement per se plays no special role in MWI (measurements are handled as all other interactions are) there is no need for a precise definition of what an observer or a measurement is — just as in [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]] no precise definition of either an observer or a measurement was required or expected. In all circumstances the [[universal wavefunction]] is still available to give a complete description of reality.
::Also, it is a common misconception to think that branches are completely separate. In Everett's formulation, they may in principle [[Quantum interference|quantum interfere]] (i.e., "merge" instead of "splitting") with each other in the future,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=quant-ph/9709032|last1=Tegmark|first1=Max|title=The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics: Many Worlds or Many Words?|journal=Fortschritte der Physik|volume=46|issue=6–8|pages=855–862|year=1997|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-3978(199811)46:6/8&lt;855::AID-PROP855&gt;3.0.CO;2-Q}}. To quote: "What Everett does NOT postulate: ''"At certain magic instances, the world undergoes some sort of metaphysical 'split' into two branches that subsequently never interact."'' This is not only a misrepresentation of the MWI, but also inconsistent with the Everett postulate, since the subsequent time evolution could in principle make the two terms...interfere. According to the MWI, there is, was and always will be only one wavefunction, and only decoherence calculations, not postulates, can tell us when it is a good approximation to treat two terms as non-interacting."&lt;/ref&gt; although this requires all "memory" of the earlier branching event to be lost, so no observer ever sees two branches of reality.&lt;ref name="davis86"/&gt;&lt;ref name=csimon&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=0908.0322|last1=Simon|first1=Christoph|title=Conscious observers clarify many worlds|class=quant-ph|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MWI states that there is no special role, or need for precise definition of measurement in MWI, yet Everett uses the word "measurement" repeatedly throughout its exposition.
::MWI response: "measurements" are treated as a subclass of interactions, which induce subject–object correlations in the combined wavefunction. There is nothing special about measurements (such as the ability to trigger a [[wave function collapse]]), that cannot be dealt with by the usual [[Unitarity (physics)|unitary]] time development process.&lt;ref name=everett56/&gt; This is why there is no precise definition of measurement in Everett's formulation, although some other formulations emphasize that measurements must be effectively irreversible or create classical information.

The splitting of worlds forward in time, but not backwards in time (i.e., merging worlds), is time asymmetric and incompatible with the time symmetric nature of [[Schrödinger's equation]], or [[CPT invariance]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Gerver, The past as backward movies of the future, ''Physics Today'', letters followup, 24(4), (April 1971), pp 46–7&lt;/ref&gt;
::MWI response: The splitting is time asymmetric; this observed temporal asymmetry is due to the [[boundary conditions]] imposed by the [[Big Bang]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryce Seligman DeWitt]], ''Physics Today'', letters followup, 24(4), (April 1971), pp 43&lt;/ref&gt;

There is circularity in Everett's measurement theory. Under the assumptions made by Everett, there are no 'good observations' as defined by him, and since his analysis of the observational process depends on the latter, it is void of any meaning. The concept of a 'good observation' is the [[Projection (linear algebra)|projection]] postulate in disguise and Everett's analysis simply derives this postulate by having assumed it, without any discussion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~neum/manyworlds.txt Arnold Neumaier's comments on the Everett FAQ, 1999 &amp; 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2013}}
::MWI response: Everett's treatment of observations / measurements covers ''both'' idealised good measurements and the more general bad or approximate cases.&lt;ref&gt;Everett [1956]&amp;nbsp;1973, "''Theory of the Universal Wavefunction''", chapter&amp;nbsp;V, section&amp;nbsp;4 "Approximate Measurements", pp.&amp;nbsp;100–103 (e)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it is legitimate to analyse probability in terms of measurement; no circularity is present.

Talk of probability in Everett presumes the existence of a preferred basis to identify measurement outcomes for the probabilities to range over. But the existence of a preferred basis can only be established by the process of decoherence, which is itself probabilistic&lt;ref name=baker&gt;David J Baker, [http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00002717/01/OutcomeProbEverett.pdf Measurement Outcomes and Probability in Everettian Quantum Mechanics], ''Studies In History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies In History and Philosophy of Modern Physics'', Volume 38, Issue 1, March 2007, Pages 153–169&lt;/ref&gt; or arbitrary.&lt;ref name = stappbasis&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stapp | first1 = Henry | year = 2002 | title = The basis problem in many-world theories | url = http://www-physics.lbl.gov/~stapp/bp.PDF | journal = Canadian Journal of Physics | volume = 80 | issue = 9| pages = 1043–1052 | doi=10.1139/p02-068|arxiv = quant-ph/0110148 |bibcode = 2002CaJPh..80.1043S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conservation of energy]] is grossly violated if at every instant near-infinite amounts of new matter are generated to create the new universes.
::MWI response: There are two responses to this objection. First, the law of conservation of energy says that energy is conserved ''within each universe''. Hence, even if "new matter" were being generated to create new universes, this would not violate conservation of energy. Second, conservation of energy is not violated since the energy of each branch has to be weighted by its probability, according to the standard formula for the [[Conservation of energy#Quantum theory|conservation of energy in quantum theory]]. This results in the total energy of the multiverse being conserved.&lt;ref name="FAQ energy conservation"&gt;[http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm#conservation Everett FAQ "Does many-worlds violate conservation of energy?"]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2013}}

[[Occam's razor]] rules against a plethora of unobservable universes – Occam would prefer just one universe; i.e., any non-MWI.
::MWI response: Occam's razor actually is a constraint on the complexity of physical theory, not on the number of universes. MWI is a simpler theory since it has fewer postulates.&lt;ref name="FAQ occam"&gt;[http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm#ockham's Everett FAQ "Does many-worlds violate Ockham's Razor?"]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2013}} Occams's razor is often cited by MWI adherents as an advantage of MWI.

Unphysical universes: If a state is a superposition of two states &lt;math&gt;\Psi_A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Psi_B&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\Psi = (a \Psi_A + b \Psi_B)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., weighted by coefficients ''a'' and ''b'', then if &lt;math&gt;b \ll a&lt;/math&gt;, what principle allows a universe with vanishingly small probability ''b'' to be instantiated on an equal footing with the much more probable one with probability ''a''? This seems to throw away the information in the probability amplitudes.
::MWI response: The magnitude of the coefficients provides the weighting that makes the branches or universes "unequal", as Everett and others have shown, leading the emergence of the [[Born rule|conventional probabilistic rules]].&lt;ref name="dewitt71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="everett57"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dewitt67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dewitt72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dewitt73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FAQ probability"&gt;[http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm#probabilities Everett FAQ "How do probabilities emerge within many-worlds?"]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2013}}

Violation of the [[principle of locality]], which contradicts [[special relativity]]: MWI splitting is instant and total: this may conflict with relativity, since an alien in the Andromeda galaxy can't know I collapse an electron over here before she collapses hers there: the relativity of [[simultaneity]] says we can't say which electron collapsed first – so which one splits off another universe first? This leads to a hopeless muddle with everyone splitting differently. Note: [[EPR paradox|EPR]] is not a get-out here, as the alien's and my electrons need never have been part of the same quantum, i.e., [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]].
::MWI response: the splitting can be regarded as causal, local and relativistic, spreading at, or below, the speed of light (e.g., we are not split by [[Schrödinger's cat]] until we look in the box).&lt;ref name="FAQ splithow"&gt;[http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm#splitsh Everett FAQ "When does Schrodinger's cat split?"]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2013}} For [[spacelike]] separated splitting you can't say which occurred first — but this is true of all spacelike separated events, [[simultaneity]] is not defined for them. Splitting is no exception; many-worlds is a local theory.&lt;ref name=rubinlocality/&gt;

==Reception==
There is a wide range of claims that are considered "many-worlds" interpretations. It was often claimed by those who do not believe in MWI&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeffrey A. Barrett]], ''The Quantum Mechanics of Minds and Worlds'', Oxford University Press, 1999. According to Barrett (loc. cit. Chapter 6) "There are many many-worlds interpretations."&lt;/ref&gt; that Everett himself was not entirely clear&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Barrett |first=Jeffrey A. |title=Everett's Relative-State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-first=Edward N. |editor-last=Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/qm-everett/ |year=2010 |edition=Fall 2010}} Again, according to Barrett "It is... unclear precisely how this was supposed to work."&lt;/ref&gt; as to what he believed; however, MWI adherents (such as [[Bryce DeWitt|DeWitt]], [[Max Tegmark|Tegmark]], [[David Deutsch|Deutsch]] and others) believe they fully understand Everett's meaning as implying the literal existence of the other worlds. Additionally, recent biographical sources make it clear that Everett believed in the literal reality of the other quantum worlds.&lt;ref name="MAD"&gt;Peter Byrne, [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0199552274 The Many Worlds of Hugh Everett III: Multiple Universes, Mutual Assured Destruction, and the Meltdown of a Nuclear Family], {{ISBN|978-0-19-955227-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Oliver Everett|Everett's son]] reported that Hugh Everett "never wavered in his belief over his many-worlds theory".&lt;ref name="newsciMark"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Aldhous | first = Peter | title = Parallel lives can never touch | magazine = New Scientist | issue = 2631 |date=2007-11-24 | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19626311.800-interview-parallel-lives-can-never-touch.html | accessdate = 2007-11-21 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also Everett was reported to believe "his many-worlds theory guaranteed him [[Quantum suicide and immortality|immortality]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/everett/everett.html#e23 Eugene Shikhovtsev's Biography of Everett, in particular see "''Keith Lynch remembers 1979–1980''"]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of MWI's strongest advocates is [[David Deutsch]].&lt;ref name="deutsch98"&gt;[[David Deutsch]], ''The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes And Its Implications'', Penguin Books (1998), {{ISBN|0-14-027541-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Deutsch, the single photon interference pattern observed in the [[double slit experiment]] can be explained by interference of photons in multiple universes. Viewed in this way, the single photon interference experiment is indistinguishable from the multiple photon interference experiment. In a more practical vein, in one of the earliest papers on quantum computing,&lt;ref name="deutsch85"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deutsch | first1 = David | authorlink = David Deutsch | year = 1985 | title = Quantum theory, the Church–Turing principle and the universal quantum computer | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A | volume = 400 | issue = 1818| pages = 97–117 | doi=10.1098/rspa.1985.0070|bibcode = 1985RSPSA.400...97D | citeseerx = 10.1.1.144.7936 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he suggested that parallelism that results from the validity of MWI could lead to "''a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it''". Deutsch has also proposed that when [[Reversible computing|reversible computers]] become conscious then MWI will be testable (at least against "naive" Copenhagenism) via the reversible observation of spin.&lt;ref name="davis86"&gt;[[Paul C.W. Davies]], J.R. Brown, ''The Ghost in the Atom'' (1986) {{ISBN|0-521-31316-3}}, pp. 34–38: "The Many-Universes Interpretation", pp 83–105 for [[David Deutsch]]'s test of MWI and reversible quantum memories&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asher Peres]] was an outspoken critic of MWI.  For example, a section in his 1993 textbook had the title ''Everett's interpretation and other bizarre theories''. Peres not only questioned whether MWI is really an "interpretation", but rather, if ''any'' interpretations of quantum mechanics are needed at all. An interpretation can be regarded as a purely formal transformation, which adds nothing to the rules of the [[quantum mechanics]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Peres seems to suggest{{according to whom|date=January 2016}} that positing the existence of an infinite number of non-communicating [[Multiverse|parallel universes]] is highly suspect per those{{who|date=January 2016}} who interpret it as a violation of [[Occam's razor]], i.e., that it does not minimize the number of hypothesized entities. However, it is understood{{by whom|date=January 2016}} that the number of elementary particles are not a gross violation of Occam's razor, one counts the types, not the tokens. [[Max Tegmark]] remarks{{where|date=January 2016}} that the alternative to many-worlds is "many words", an [[allusion]] to the complexity of [[von Neumann]]'s collapse postulate. On the other hand, the same derogatory qualification "many words" is often applied to MWI by its critics{{who|date=January 2016}} who see it as a word game which obfuscates rather than clarifies by confounding the von Neumann branching of possible worlds with the Schrödinger parallelism of many worlds in superposition.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

MWI is considered by some{{who|date=January 2016}} to be [[unfalsifiable]] and hence unscientific because the multiple [[Multiverse|parallel universes]] are non-communicating, in the sense that no information can be passed between them. Others&lt;ref name="davis86"/&gt; claim MWI is directly testable. Everett regarded MWI as falsifiable since any test that falsifies conventional [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] would also falsify MWI.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

=== Polls ===
Advocates of MWI often cite a poll of 72 "leading [[cosmologist]]s and other quantum field theorists" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=35–36 |title= The Universe – Solved! |first= Jim |last= Elvridge. |isbn= 978-1-4243-3626-5 |date= 2008-01-02 |oclc= 247614399 |quote= 58% believed that the Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI) was true, including Stephen Hawking and Nobel Laureates [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and Richard Feynman }}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by the American political scientist [[David Raub]] in 1995 showing 58% agreement with "Yes, I think MWI is true".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |quote= [the poll was] published in the French periodical ''Sciences et Avenir'' in January 1998 |page= 33 |title= Beyond the bleep : the definitive unauthorized guide to What the bleep do we know!? |first= Alexandra |last= Bruce. |isbn= 978-1-932857-22-1 |chapter= How does reality work?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the poll is controversial. For example, [[Victor J. Stenger]] remarks that [[Murray Gell-Mann]]'s published work explicitly rejects the existence of simultaneous parallel universes. Collaborating with [[James Hartle]], Gell-Mann is working toward the development a more "palatable" ''post-Everett quantum mechanics''. Stenger thinks it's fair to say that most physicists dismiss the many-world interpretation as too extreme, while noting it "has merit in finding a place for the observer inside the system being analyzed and doing away with the troublesome notion of wave function collapse".&lt;ref name="stenger1995"&gt;{{cite book |first=V.J. |last=Stenger |year=1995 |title=The Unconscious Quantum: Metaphysics in Modern Physics and Cosmology |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-57392-022-3 |lccn=lc95032599 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ZbvAAAAMAAJ |page=176 |quote=Gell-Mann and collaborator James Hartle, along with a score of others, have been working to develop a more palatable interpretation of quantum mechanics that is free of the problems that plague all the interpretations we have considered so far. This new interpretation is called, in its various incarnations, '''post-Everett quantum mechanics''', alternate histories, consistent histories, or decoherent histories. I will not be overly concerned with the detailed differences between these characterizations and will use the terms more or less interchangeably.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Tegmark]] also reports the result of a "highly unscientific" poll taken at a 1997 quantum mechanics workshop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/quantum.html Max Tegmark on many-worlds (contains MWI poll)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tegmark, "The many worlds interpretation (MWI) scored second, comfortably ahead of the [[consistent histories]] and [[Bohm interpretation|Bohm&amp;nbsp;interpretations]]." Such polls have been taken at other conferences, for example, in response to [[Sean M. Carroll|Sean Carroll]]'s observation, "As crazy as it sounds, most working physicists buy into the many-worlds theory" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://preposterousuniverse.blogspot.com/2004_04_01_preposterousuniverse_archive.html#108087902367974365 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040908014703/http://preposterousuniverse.blogspot.com/2004_04_01_preposterousuniverse_archive.html#108087902367974365 |first=Sean |last=Caroll |title=Preposterous Universe |date=1 April 2004 |archivedate=8 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Nielsen]] counters: "at a quantum computing conference at Cambridge in 1998, a many-worlder surveyed the audience of approximately 200 people... Many-worlds did just fine, garnering support on a level comparable to, but somewhat below, Copenhagen and decoherence." However, Nielsen notes that it seemed most attendees found it to be a waste of time: [[Asher Peres]] "got a huge and sustained round of applause… when he got up at the end of the polling and asked 'And who here believes the laws of physics are decided by a democratic vote?'" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qinfo.org/people/nielsen/blog/archive/000060.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040520222807/http://www.qinfo.org/people/nielsen/blog/archive/000060.html |first=Michael |last=Nielsen |title=Michael Nielsen: The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics | archivedate=20 May 2004 |date=3 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 poll of fewer than 40 students and researchers taken after a course on the Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics at the Institute for Quantum Computing University of Waterloo found "Many Worlds (and decoherence)" to be the least favored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iqc.ca/~qipcourse/interpret/survey.html Survey Results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104152717/http://www.iqc.ca/~qipcourse/interpret/survey.html |date=2010-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 poll of 33 participants at an Austrian conference found 6 endorsed MWI, 8 "Information-based/information-theoretical", and 14 Copenhagen;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1301.1069|last1=Schlosshauer|first1=Maximilian|title=A Snapshot of Foundational Attitudes Toward Quantum Mechanics|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|volume=44|issue=3|pages=222–230|last2=Kofler|first2=Johannes|last3=Zeilinger|first3=Anton|year=2013|doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2013.04.004|bibcode=2013SHPMP..44..222S}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authors remark that the results are similar to the previous Tegmark's 1998 poll.

==Speculative implications==
Speculative physics deals with questions which are also discussed in science fiction.

===Quantum suicide thought experiment===
{{main|Quantum suicide and immortality}}
'''Quantum suicide''', as a [[thought experiment]], was published independently by [[Hans Moravec]] in 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestargarden.co.uk/ManyMinds.html |title=The Many Minds Approach |date=25 October 2010 |accessdate=7 December 2010 |quote=This idea was first proposed by Austrian mathematician Hans Moravec in 1987...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moravec1987"&gt;{{cite book |last=Moravec |first=Hans |year=1988 |title=Mind Children: The Future of Robot and Human Intelligence |chapter=The Doomsday Device |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |location=Harvard |page=188 |isbn=978-0-674-57618-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=56mb7XuSx3QC&amp;lpg=PP188&amp;pg=PA188}} (If MWI is true, apocalyptic particle accelerators won't function as advertised).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bruno Marchal]] in 1988&lt;ref name="Marchal1988"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marchal |first=Bruno |year=1988 |title=Informatique théorique et philosophie de l'esprit |journal=Acte du 3ème colloque international Cognition et Connaissance [Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference Cognition and Knowledge] |location=Toulouse |pages=193–227 |trans-title=Theoretical Computer Science and Philosophy of Mind}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marchal1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marchal |first=Bruno |year=1991 |title=Mechanism and personal identity |editor1-last=De Glas |editor1-first=M. |editor2-last=Gabbay |editor2-first=D. |journal=Proceedings of WOCFAI 91 |pages=335–345 |location=Paris. Angkor. |url=http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/M&amp;PI_15-MAI-91.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was independently developed further by [[Max Tegmark]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=quant-ph/9709032|last1=Tegmark|first1=Max|title=The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics: Many Worlds or Many Words?|journal=Fortschritte der Physik|volume=46|issue=6–8|pages=855–862|year=1997|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-3978(199811)46:6/8&lt;855::AID-PROP855&gt;3.0.CO;2-Q}}&lt;/ref&gt; It attempts to distinguish between the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics and the Everett many-worlds interpretation by means of a variation of the [[Schrödinger's cat]] [[thought experiment]], from the cat's point of view. '''Quantum immortality''' refers to the subjective experience of surviving quantum suicide regardless of the odds.&lt;ref name="mit_edu"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tegmark |first=Max |title=Quantum immortality |url=http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/quantum.html#immortality |date=November 1998 |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weak coupling===
Another speculation is that the separate worlds remain weakly coupled (e.g., by gravity) permitting "communication between parallel universes". A possible test of this using quantum-optical equipment is described in a 1997 ''[[Foundations of Physics]]'' article by [[Rainer Plaga]].&lt;ref name="plaga"/&gt; It involves an isolated [[ion]] in an [[ion trap]], a quantum measurement that would yield two parallel worlds (their difference just being in the detection of a single photon), and the [[Excited state|excitation]] of the ion from only one of these worlds. If the excited ion can be detected from the other parallel universe, then this would constitute direct evidence in support of the many-worlds interpretation and would automatically exclude the orthodox, "logical", and "many-histories" interpretations. The reason the ion is isolated is to make it not participate immediately in the decoherence which insulates the parallel world branches, therefore allowing it to act as a gateway between the two worlds, and if the measure apparatus could perform the measurements quickly enough before the gateway ion is decoupled then the test would succeed (with electronic computers the necessary time window between the two worlds would be in a time scale of [[millisecond]]s or [[nanosecond]]s, and if the measurements are taken by humans then a few seconds would still be enough). R. Plaga shows that macroscopic decoherence timescales are a possibility. The proposed test is based on technical equipment described in a 1993 ''[[Physical Review]]'' article by Itano et al.&lt;ref name="itano"&gt;W.M.Itano et al., Phys. Rev. A47,3354 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; and R. Plaga says that this level of technology is enough to realize the proposed inter-world communication experiment. The necessary technology for precision measurements of single ions already exists since the 1970s, and the ion recommended for excitation is &lt;sup&gt;199&lt;/sup&gt;Hg&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The excitation methodology is described by Itano et al. and the time needed for it is given by the [[Rabi flopping]] formula.&lt;ref&gt;M. SargentIII, M. O. Scully and W. E. Lamb, Laser physics (Addison-Wesley, Reading, 1974), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a test as described by R. Plaga would mean that energy transfer is possible between parallel worlds. This does not violate the fundamental principles of physics because these require energy conservation only for the whole universe and not for the single parallel branches.&lt;ref name="plaga" /&gt; Neither the excitation of the single ion (which is a [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] of the proposed system) leads to decoherence, something which is proven by [[Welcher Weg]] detectors which can excite atoms without momentum transfer (which causes the loss of coherence).&lt;ref&gt;M.O. Scully and H. Walther, Phys. Rev. A 39,5229 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed test would allow for low-bandwidth inter-world communication, the limiting factors of bandwidth and time being dependent on the technology of the equipment. Because of the time needed to determine the state of the partially decohered isolated excited ion based on Itano et al.'s methodology, the ion would decohere by the time its state is determined during the experiment, so Plaga's proposal would pass just enough information between the two worlds to confirm their parallel existence and nothing more. The author contemplates that with increased bandwidth, one could even transfer television imagery across the parallel worlds.&lt;ref name="plaga" /&gt; For example, Itano et al.'s methodology could be improved (by lowering the time needed for state determination of the excited ion) if a more efficient process were found for the detection of fluorescence radiation using 194&amp;nbsp;nm photons.&lt;ref name="plaga" /&gt;

A 1991 article by J. Polchinski also supports the view that inter-world communication is a theoretical possibility.&lt;ref&gt;J. Polchinski, Phys. Rev. Lett. 66,397 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors in a 1994 preprint article also contemplated similar ideas.&lt;ref&gt;M. Gell-Mann and J. B. Hartle, Equivalent Sets of Histories and Multiple Quasiclassical Domains, preprint University of California at Santa Barbara UCSBTH-94-09 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason inter-world communication seems like a possibility is because [[decoherence]] which separates the parallel worlds is never fully complete,&lt;ref name="zeh16"&gt;H. D. Zeh, Found.Phys. 3,109 (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. D. Zeh, Phys. Lett. A 172,189 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; therefore weak influences from one parallel world to another can still pass between them,&lt;ref name="zeh16" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Albrecht, Phys. Rev. D 48, 3768 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; and these should be measurable with advanced technology. Deutsch proposed such an experiment in a 1985 ''[[International Journal of Theoretical Physics]]'' article,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=David|date=1985|title=Quantum theory as a universal physical theory|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00670071|journal=International Journal of Theoretical Physics|language=en|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1–41|doi=10.1007/bf00670071|issn=0020-7748|quote=The actual performance of this experiment, involving as it does fairly detailed adjustments inside an observer's brain and sense organs, is far beyond present-day technology, but perhaps not quite as far as it might seem at first sight.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the technology it requires involves human-level [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref name="plaga" /&gt;

===Absurd or highly improbable timelines===
Many MWI proponents assert that every physically possible event has to be represented in the multiversal stack, and by definition this would include highly unlikely scenarios and timelines.
Bryce Seligman DeWitt has stated that "[Everett, Wheeler and Graham] do not in the end exclude any element of the superposition. All the worlds are there, even those in which everything goes wrong and all the statistical laws break down." &lt;ref&gt;DeWitt, B (1970). "Quantum mechanics and reality". Physics Today 23, 9, 34 (1970); doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.3022331&lt;/ref&gt;
Borrowing a phase from [[T.H. White]]'s [[The Once and Future King]], Murray Gell-Mann describes the implications of his [[Totalitarian principle]], as "Everything not forbidden is compulsory."&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, G. (1999). Strange Beauty: Murray Gell-Mann and the Revolution in Twentieth-Century Physics. Knopf. p. 224. {{ISBN|978-0-679-43764-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Max Tegmark has affirmed in numerous statements that absurd or highly unlikely events are inevitable under the MWI interpretation. To quote Tegmark, "Things inconsistent with the laws of physics will never happen - everything else will... it's important to keep track of the statistics, since even if everything conceivable happens somewhere, really freak events happen only exponentially rarely".&lt;ref&gt;Max Tegmark: Q and A (Multiverse Philosophy) http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/crazy.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Frank J. Tipler]], although a strong advocate for the many-worlds interpretation, has expressed some skepticism regarding this aspect of the theory. In a 2015 interview he stated "We simply don't know...it might be that the modulus over the wavefunction of that possibility [i.e. an extremely absurd yet physically possible event] is zero in which case there is no such world...There are universes out there, which you could imagine which...would not be actualized." &lt;ref&gt;Audio interview with Frank Tipler- White Gardenia interview with Frank Tipler, December 2015

===Similarity to modal realism===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
The many-worlds interpretation has some similarity to [[modal realism]] in [[philosophy]], which is the view that the [[possible world]]s used to interpret modal claims exist and are of a kind with the actual world. Unlike the possible worlds of philosophy, however, in quantum mechanics counterfactual alternatives can influence the results of experiments, as in the [[Elitzur–Vaidman bomb-testing problem]] or the [[Quantum Zeno effect]]. Also, while the worlds of the many-worlds interpretation all share the same physical laws, modal realism postulates a world for every way things could conceivably have been.

===Time travel===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
The many-worlds interpretation could be one possible way to resolve the paradoxes&lt;ref name="deutsch98"/&gt; that one would expect to arise ''if'' [[time travel]] turns out to be permitted by physics (permitting [[closed timelike curves]] and thus violating [[causality]]). Entering the past would itself be a quantum event causing branching, and therefore the timeline accessed by the time traveller simply would be another timeline of many. In that sense, it would make the [[Novikov self-consistency principle]] unnecessary.

==Many-worlds in literature and science fiction==
{{Main|Parallel universe (fiction)}}
{{See also|Alternate History}}

''[[Star Trek]]'' uses many-worlds in many stories. In the ''[[Star Trek: Original Series|Original Series]]'', Spock and Kirk [[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|make a crossover into a mirror universe]] and encounter versions of themselves from the other universe. This [[Mirror Universe]] is continued in ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space 9|Deep Space 9]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise|Enterprise]],'' and ''[[Star Trek: Discovery|Discovery]]'', with episodes arching between the Terran empire and the Alliance, where characters find mirror versions of themselves and other characters who are currently dead in the central universe, or dead in the parallel universe. In [[Parallels (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|an episode]] of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', Worf crosses over into a parallel universe while piloting a shuttlecraft and manages to encounter several other universes. The TNG finale "[[All Good Things... (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|All Good Things...]]" uses the concept heavily, as Picard jumps between times. 

[[Michael Crichton]]'s 1999 novel, ''[[Timeline (novel)|Timeline]]'', is about time travel into the past. The technology used in the book is based upon the existence of the MWI's multiverse as described by Everett.&lt;ref&gt;The book erroneously attributes the phrase "many worlds" to Everett. 
 It was actually coined by [[Bryce DeWitt]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crichton2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Crichton|title=Timeline|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQL2n6NrQ_MC|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-345-53901-4|pages=121–123, 127-128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author [[Neal Stephenson]] drew on the many-worlds theory for some aspects of his 2008 novel ''[[Anathem]]''.

A more recent iteration, ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', uses the many-worlds interpretation as a basis for the occurrences in the show, with Rick using a portal gun to casually travel between timelines. The cartoon also makes an allusion to [[Schrödinger's Cat]] in an episode in which they split their existence into two hypothetical, equally possible existences.

In [[Stranger Things#Season 1 (2016)|episode 5]] of the [[Netflix]] series, ''[[Stranger Things]]'', the protagonists' middle school teacher Scott Clarke specifically mentions the many-worlds theory when asked about the possibility of "theoretical" alternate dimensions.

Many worlds interpretation was also used in [[The Time Ships]] by [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

'''Markov's principle''', named after [[Andrey Markov (Soviet mathematician)|Andrey Markov Jr]], is a specific statement in [[computability theory]] that is obviously true classically (i.e. it is a [[Validity (logic)|logical validity]]), but must be proved when using [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructive]] mathematics. 
There are many equivalent formulations of Markov's principle.

== Statements of the principle ==
In the language of [[computability theory]], Markov's principle is a formal expression of the claim that if it is impossible that an algorithm does not terminate, then it does terminate. This is equivalent to the claim that if a set and its complement are both [[computably enumerable]], then the set is [[recursive set|decidable]]. 

In [[predicate logic]], if ''P'' is a predicate over the [[natural number]]s, it is expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;(\forall n (P(n) \vee \neg P(n)) \wedge \neg \forall n \neg P(n)) \rightarrow \exists n\;P(n)&lt;/math&gt;

That is, if ''P'' is decidable, and it cannot be false for every natural number ''n'', then it is true for some&amp;nbsp;''n''.  (In general, a predicate ''P'' over some domain is called ''decidable'' if for every ''x'' in the domain, either ''P''(''x'') is true, or ''P''(''x'') is not true, which is not always the case constructively.)

It is equivalent in the language of [[Heyting arithmetic|arithmetic]] to:
:&lt;math&gt;\neg \neg \exists n\;f(n)=0 \rightarrow \exists n\;f(n)=0,&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; a [[computable function|total recursive function]] on the natural numbers.

It is equivalent, in the language of [[real analysis]], to the following principles:

* For each real number ''x'', if it is contradictory that ''x'' is equal to 0, then there exists ''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;[[rational number|Q]] such that 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;|''x''|, often expressed by saying that ''x'' is [[apartness relation|apart]] from, or constructively unequal to,&amp;nbsp;0.
* For each real number ''x'', if it is contradictory that ''x'' is equal to&amp;nbsp;0, then there exists ''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;R such that ''xy''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

== Realizability ==

If constructive arithmetic is translated using [[realizability]] into a classical meta-theory that proves the &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;-consistency of the relevant classical theory (for example, Peano Arithmetic if we are studying [[Heyting arithmetic]]), then Markov's principle is justified: a realizer is the constant function that takes a realization that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is not everywhere false to the [[unbounded search]] that successively checks if &lt;math&gt;P(0), P(1), P(2),\dots&lt;/math&gt; is true. If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is not everywhere false, then by &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;-consistency there must be a term for which &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; holds, and each term will be checked by the search eventually. If however &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; does not hold anywhere, then the domain of the constant function must be empty, so although the search does not halt it still holds vacuously that the function is a realizer. By the Law of the Excluded Middle (in our classical metatheory), &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; must either hold nowhere or not hold nowhere, therefore this constant function is a realizer.

If instead the realizability interpretation is used in a constructive meta-theory, then it is not justified. Indeed, for first-order arithmetic, Markov's principle exactly captures the difference between a constructive and classical meta-theory. Specifically, a statement is provable in [[Heyting arithmetic]] with [[Church's thesis (constructive mathematics)|Extended Church's thesis]] if and only if there is a number that provably realizes it in [[Heyting arithmetic]]; and it is provable in [[Heyting arithmetic]] with [[Church's thesis (constructive mathematics)|Extended Church's thesis]] ''and Markov's principle'' if and only if there is a number that provably realizes it in [[Peano arithmetic]]. 

Modified [[realizability]] does not justify Markov's principle, even if classical logic is used in the meta-theory: there is no realizer in the language of [[simply typed lambda calculus]] as this language is not [[Turing-complete]] and arbitrary loops cannot be defined in it.

== Markov's rule ==
'''Markov's rule''' is the formulation of Markov's principle as a rule. It states that &lt;math&gt;\exists n\;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; is derivable as soon as &lt;math&gt;\neg \neg \exists n\;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; is, for &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; decidable. It was proved by Anne S. Troelstra&lt;ref&gt;Anne S. Troelstra. Metamathematical Investigation of Intuitionistic Arithmetic and Analysis, Springer Verlag (1973), Theorem 4.2.4 of the 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt; that Markov's rule is an [[admissible rule]] in [[Heyting arithmetic]]. Later on, the logician [[Harvey Friedman]] showed that Markov's rule is an admissible rule in all of [[intuitionistic logic]], [[Heyting arithmetic]], and various other intuitionistic theories,&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Friedman. Classically and Intuitionistically Provably Recursive Functions. In Scott, D. S. and Muller, G. H. Editors, Higher Set Theory, Volume 699 of Lecture Notes in Mathematics, Springer Verlag (1978), pp. 21–28.&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[Friedman translation]].

== Weak Markov's principle ==
A weaker form of Markov's principle may be stated in the language of analysis as

: &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in\mathbb{R}\ (\forall y\in\mathbb{R}\ \neg\neg(0&lt;y) \vee \neg\neg(y&lt;x)) \to 0&lt;x.&lt;/math&gt;

This form can be justified by [[L. E. J. Brouwer|Brouwer's]] [[Brouwer's continuity principles|continuity principles]], whereas the stronger form contradicts them. Thus it can be derived from intuitionistic, realizability, and classical reasoning, in each case for different reasons, but this principle is not valid in the general constructive sense of Bishop.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ulrich Kohlenbach]], "[http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.24.7455 On weak Markov's principle]". ''Mathematical Logic Quarterly'' (2002), vol 48, issue S1, pp. 59–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mokomokai''' are the preserved heads of [[Māori people|Māori]], the indigenous people of [[New Zealand]], where the faces have been decorated by [[tā moko]] [[tattoo]]ing.  They became valuable trade items during the [[Musket Wars]] of the early 19th century.

==Moko==
{{Main|Tā moko}}
Moko facial tattoos were traditional in Māori culture until about the mid 19th century when their use began to disappear, although there has been something of a revival from the late 20th century.  In pre-European Māori culture they denoted high social status.  There were generally only men that had full facial moko, though high-ranked women often had moko on their lips and chins.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer &amp; Tano (2004), p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Moko tattoos served as identifying connection between an individual and their ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Heritage, Cultural Rights, Cultural Diversity: New Developments in International Law,
 edited by Silvia Borelli, Federico Lenzerini, page 163&lt;/ref&gt;

Moko marked rites of passage for people of chiefly rank, as well as significant events in their lives.  Each moko was unique and contained information about the person’s rank, tribe, lineage, occupation and exploits.  Moko were expensive to obtain and elaborate moko were usually limited to chiefs and high-ranked warriors.  Moreover, the art of moko, the people who created and incised the designs, as well as the moko themselves, were surrounded by strict [[tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] and protocol.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer &amp; Tano (2004), pp.1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MaoriMoko.png|thumb|left|Moko design]]

==Mokomokai==
When someone with moko died, often the [[head]] would be preserved.  The brain and eyes were removed, with all orifices sealed with [[Phormium|flax]] fibre and [[Gum-digger#Uses of kauri gum|gum]].  The head was then boiled or steamed in an oven before being smoked over an open fire and dried in the sun for several days.  It was then treated with [[shark oil]].  Such preserved heads, mokomokai, would be kept by their families in ornately carved boxes and brought out only for sacred ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-TeIMoko.html NZETC: Mokomokai: Preserving the past] Accessed 25 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The heads of enemy chiefs killed in battle were also preserved; these mokomokai, being considered [[war trophy|trophies of war]], would be displayed on the [[Marae#Marae in New Zealand|marae]] and mocked.  They were important in diplomatic negotiations between warring tribes, with the return and exchange of mokomokai being an essential precondition for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer &amp; Tano (2004), pp.3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musket Wars==
{{Main|Musket Wars}}
In the early 19th century, with the arrival of Europeans in New Zealand, tribes in contact with European sailors, traders and settlers had access to [[firearm]]s, giving them a military advantage over their neighbours.  This gave rise to the Musket Wars, when other tribes became desperate to acquire firearms too, if only to defend themselves.  During this period of social destabilisation, mokomokai became commercial trade items that could be sold as curios, artworks and as museum specimens which fetched high prices in Europe and America, and which could be bartered for firearms and [[ammunition]].&lt;ref&gt;Palmer &amp; Tano (2004), pp.4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The demand for firearms was such that tribes carried out raids on their neighbours to acquire more heads to trade for them.  They also tattooed slaves and prisoners (though with meaningless motifs rather than genuine moko) in order to provide heads to order.  The peak years of the trade in mokomokai were from 1820 to 1831.  In 1831 the [[Governor of New South Wales]] issued a proclamation banning further trade in heads out of New Zealand, and during the 1830s the demand for firearms diminished because of [[market saturation]].  By 1840 when the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] was signed, and New Zealand became a [[British Empire|British colony]], the export trade in mokomokai had virtually ended, along with a decline in the use of moko in Māori society, although occasional small-scale trade continued for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer &amp; Tano (2004), pp.5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janes &amp; Conaty (2005), pp.156-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robley with mokomokai collection 2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|H.G. Robley with his mokomokai collection]]

== Robley collection==
{{Main|Horatio Gordon Robley}}
[[Major-General (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] Horatio Gordon Robley was a British army officer and artist who served in New Zealand during the [[New Zealand land wars]] in the 1860s.  He was interested in [[ethnology]] and fascinated by the art of tattooing as well as being a talented illustrator.  He wrote the classic text on the subject of moko, ''Moko; or Maori Tattooing'', which was published in 1896.  After he returned to England he built up a notable collection of 35–40 mokomokai which he later offered to sell to the New Zealand Government.  When the offer was declined, most of the collection was sold to the [[American Museum of Natural History]].&lt;ref name=sst/&gt;

==Repatriation==
More recently there has been a campaign to repatriate to New Zealand the hundreds of mokomokai held in museums and private collections around the world, either to be returned to their relatives or to the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa|Museum of New Zealand]] for storage, though not display.  It has had some success, though many mokomokai remain overseas and the campaign is ongoing.&lt;ref name=sst&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sundaystartimes/4353909a20455.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130223000152/http://www.stuff.co.nz/sundaystartimes/4353909a20455.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 February 2013 |title=The trade in preserved Maori heads |work=[[The Sunday Star-Times]] |accessdate=25 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, Wellington. 7 April 2000.

==Component definitions==
The term “pantheism" is derived from Greek words ''pan'' (Greek: πᾶν) meaning "all" and ''theos'' (θεός) meaning God. It was coined by [[Joseph Raphson]] in his work ''De spatio reali'', published in 1697.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ann Thomson]]; ''Bodies of Thought: Science, Religion, and the Soul in the Early Enlightenment'', 2008, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was introduced to English by Irish writer [[John Toland]] in his 1705 work ''Socinianism Truly Stated, by a pantheist'' that described pantheism as the "opinion of those who believe in no other eternal being but the universe."&lt;ref name=Toland&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Paul|title=Toland: the father of modern pantheism|url=http://www.pantheism.net/paul/history/toland.htm|work=Pantheist History|publisher=World Pantheist Movement|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "naturalistic" derives from the word "[[Naturalism (disambiguation)|naturalism]]", which has several meanings in philosophy and aesthetics.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;A Dictionary of Philosophy, ed. T. Mautner, Blackwell, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In philosophy the term frequently denotes the view that everything belongs to the world of nature and can be studied with the methods appropriate for studying that world, ''i.e.'' the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Companion to Philosophy, ed. Ted Honderich, Oxford University Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; It generally implies an absence of belief in supernatural beings.&lt;ref name="Dictionary" /&gt;

==Early conceptions==
[[Joseph Needham]], a modern British scholar of Chinese philosophy and science, has identified [[Taoism]] as "a naturalistic pantheism which emphasizes the unity and spontaneity of the operations of Nature."&lt;ref&gt;Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 2, Joseph Needham, Cambridge University Press, 1956, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophy can be dated to the late 4th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, Russell. ''Taoism: The Enduring Tradition.'' (London and New York: Routledge, 2004). p. 61. {{ISBN|978-0-415-26321-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hellenistic Greek philosophical school of [[Stoicism]] (which started in the early 3rd century BCE)&lt;ref name="Stoicism"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoicism], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; rejected the [[Mind-body dualism|dualist]] idea of the separate ideal/conscious and material realms, and identified the substance of God with the entire cosmos and heaven.&lt;ref name="Panentheism" /&gt; However, not all philosophers who did so can be classified as naturalistic pantheists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=John W.|title=Panentheism: The Other God of the Philosophers: From Plato to the Present|year=2006|publisher=Baker Academic|page=16|quote=Naturalistic pantheism anticipates Bruno, Spinoza, Toland, Einstein (not Schelling, Hegel) defining God in terms of Nature should not be construed as naturalistic pantheism. By "Nature" Eriugena means something like "Reality" rather than the mere physical universe. "But his position is in fact closer to the naturalistic pantheism of ancient Stoicism. The World-Soul is not a higher reality that generates the physical world but the rational causal agent immanent in the world"...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern conceptions==
Naturalistic pantheism was expressed by various thinkers,&lt;ref name=Marvin /&gt; including [[Giordano Bruno]], who was burned at the stake for his views.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, William (prof. of philosophy at the Catholic University), "History of Philosophy", 1903, p. 429&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 17th century Dutch philosopher Spinoza became particularly known for it.&lt;ref name=Marvin /&gt;

===Baruch Spinoza===
{{Main|Philosophy of Spinoza}}
Possibly drawing upon the ideas of Descartes,&lt;ref&gt;Elements of general philosophy By George Croom Robertson, p. 282
:"The pantheistic element in Descartes’ thought viz. the tendency to conceive the notion of substance in the truest sence as being only One, and the naturalistic element, viz. the tendency to conceive the One Substance of God as Order of Nature, were brought together and set in the front of Spinoza’s thought as the mother-idea of it all…Spinoza’s philosophy remains as yet and is likely to remain, the very type of a Naturalistic Pantheism."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Spinoza|Baruch Spinoza]] connected God and Nature through the phrase ''deus sive natura'' ("God, or Nature"),&lt;ref&gt;Elements of General Philosophy, George Croom Robertson, John Murray, 1896, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Arnold: Between Two Worlds, AJ Lubell, Modern Language Quarterly, 1961, Duke University Press, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Concise Dictionary of Theology by Gerald O'Collins, Edward G. Farrugia, Paulist Press, 2000, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; making him the father of [[classical pantheism]]. He relied upon rationalism rather than the more intuitive approach of some Eastern traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Philosophies of History: Meeting of East and West in Cycle-pattern ... Grace Edith Cairns, 1962
:This attitude is close to that of Spinoza's naturalistic pantheism in the West although Spinoza reached it by the more characteristically Western method, rationalism, versus the intuitive way of the Taoists&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza's philosophy, sometimes known as [[Spinozism]], has been understood in a number of ways, and caused disagreements such as the [[Pantheism controversy]]. However, many scholars have considered it to be a form of naturalistic pantheism. This has included viewing the pantheistic unity as natural.&lt;ref name=Pafumi&gt;{{cite book|last=Pafumi|first=G.R.|title=Is Our Vision of God Obsolete|year=2010|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=1441590404|page=153|quote=Spinoza = naturalistic pantheism — universe as a "single, interconnected, and solely natural substance."}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Others focus on the deterministic aspect of naturalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tillich|first=Paul|title=Paul Tillich: Theologian of the Boundaries|year=1987|publisher=Collins|location=London|isbn=9780800634032|page=165|edition=1. Fortress Press|author2=Taylor, Mark Kline|quote=Naturalistic pantheism "denies finite freedom" as in Spinoza (as opposed to idealistic type of pantheism which identifies God with the universal essence of being)...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian philosophy, God: being a contribution to a philosophy of theism by John Thomas Driscoll, Benzinger 1904, p. 190
:“In the criticism of his system we meet with the same difficulties that we find in Spinoza, i.e., the nature of the mind and of matter, the character of their interaction and the doctrine of determinism. Both Spinoza and Spencer teach a pure Naturalism … The two theories set forth are phases of Realistic or Naturalistic Pantheism.”&lt;/ref&gt;
Spinoza inspired a number of other pantheists, with varying degrees of idealism towards nature.&lt;ref&gt;
Goethe, Nietzsche, And Wagner: Their Spinozan Epics of Love And Power by T. K. Seung, p. 11
:“The second function of the Earth Spirit was to clarify Goethe’s own version of pantheism. With the revival of Spinoza’s philosophy, naturalistic pantheism became a groundswell for the German intellectuals of Goethe’s generation. Although they rejected the other world, many of them subscribed to an idealistic or Romantic view of Nature, which Goethe regarded as an unreal view of reality…”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The five great skeptical dramas of history by John Owen (theologian), 1896, p. 13
:“If he could be said to have owned a master of philosophy it was Spinoza. Of none other does he speak in such terms of commendation … In all probability Spinoza found his greatest disciple on the road to a naturalistic pantheism.”&lt;/ref&gt; However, Spinoza's influence in his own time was limited.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Ethics by Adolf Wuttke (theologian), 1876, p. 289, p. 327
:“Spinoza exerted in his own age but little influence. Notwithstanding the deep spiritually-moral declension of that dark period, the religious God-consciousness was as yet too vital to fall in with this naturalistic pantheism.”&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Arnold: Between Two Worlds, AJ Lubell, Modern Language Quarterly, 1961, Duke University Press... Page 5
:"the naturalistic pantheism he then or somewhat later learned from Spinoza"&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have considered Spinoza the founder of a line of naturalistic pantheism, though not necessarily the only one.&lt;ref&gt;Nothingness in the theology of Paul Tillich and Karl Barth by Sung Min Jeong University Press of America, 2003, p. 24
:"Spinoza establishes a naturalistic pantheism. Tillich considers Spinoza’s substance as a category"...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Finger Thomas (prof of religious thought), "Philosophy and religious belief", 1970, p. 92
:"..two forms of pantheism we have distinguished, idealistic monism and naturalistic pantheism. Here we shall consider only the naturalistic pantheism we have been describing, especially that of Spinoza."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;The riddle of the universe by Edward Douglas, London: Fawcett, 1893, p. 30
:"Spinoza carried philosophy into the realms of a naturalistic pantheism."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
In 1705 the Irish writer [[John Toland]] endorsed a form of pantheism in which the God-soul is identical with the material universe.&lt;ref name=Toland /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Materialism in Eighteenth-Century European Thought" in New Dictionary of the History of Ideas, 2005, ed. Peter Machamer and Francesca di Poppa&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Middle Works of John Dewey, Volume 2, SIU Press, 1976, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

German naturalist [[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834–1919&lt;ref&gt;"Ernst Haeckel – Britannica Concise" (biography), ''Encyclopædia Britannica Concise'', 2006, Concise.

Randolph, 1896, p217&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Pantheist Movement]], started in 1999, describes Naturalistic Pantheism as including reverence for the universe, [[Philosophical realism|realism]], [[metaphysical naturalism|strong naturalism]], and respect for reason and the scientific method as methods of understanding the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is your spiritual home right here on Earth?|url=http://www.pantheism.net|publisher=World Pantheist Movement|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Harrison (pantheist)|Paul Harrison]] considers its position the closest modern equivalent to Toland's.&lt;ref name=Toland /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10820">'''Non-well-founded set theories''' are variants of [[axiomatic set theory]] that allow sets to contain themselves and otherwise violate the rule of [[well-foundedness]]. In non-well-founded set theories, the [[axiom of regularity|foundation axiom]] of [[ZFC]] is replaced by axioms implying its negation.

The study of non-well-founded sets was initiated by [[Dmitry Mirimanoff]] in a series of papers between 1917 and 1920, in which he formulated the distinction between well-founded and non-well-founded sets; he did not regard well-foundedness as an [[axiom]]. Although a number of axiomatic systems of non-well-founded sets were proposed afterwards, they did not find much in the way of applications until [[Peter Aczel]]’s [[hyperset theory]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Pakkan and Akman (1994, [http://tinf2.vub.ac.be/~dvermeir/mirrors/www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/%257Eakman/jour-papers/air/node8.html section link]); Rathjen (2004); Sangiorgi (2011) pp. 17–19, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of non-well-founded sets has been applied in the [[logic]]al [[model (abstract)|modelling]] of non-terminating [[Computing|computational]] processes in computer science ([[process algebra]] and [[final semantics]]), [[linguistics]] and [[natural language]] [[semantics]] ([[situation theory]]), philosophy (work on the [[Liar Paradox]]), and in a different setting, [[non-standard analysis]].{{sfnp|Ballard|Hrbáček|1992|p=}}

== Details ==
In 1917, Dmitry Mirimanoff introduced&lt;ref&gt;Levy (2002), p.&amp;nbsp;68; Hallett (1986), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TM3AKPYdQVgC&amp;pg=PA186 p.&amp;nbsp;186]; Aczel (1988) p. 105 all citing Mirimanoff (1917)&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of [[well-founded set|well-foundedness]] of a set:

:A set, x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is well-founded if it has no infinite descending membership sequence &lt;math&gt; \cdots \in x_2 \in x_1 \in x_0. &lt;/math&gt;

In ZFC, there is no infinite descending ∈-sequence by the [[axiom of regularity]]. In fact, the axiom of regularity is often called the ''foundation axiom'' since it can be proved within ZFC&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (that is, ZFC without the axiom of regularity) that well-foundedness implies regularity. In variants of ZFC without the [[axiom of regularity]], the possibility of non-well-founded sets with set-like ∈-chains arises. For example, a set ''A'' such that ''A'' ∈ ''A'' is non-well-founded.

Although Mirimanoff also introduced a notion of isomorphism between possibly non-well-founded sets, he considered neither an axiom of foundation nor of anti-foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Aczel (1988) p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, [[Paul Finsler]] introduced the first axiom that allowed non-well-founded sets. After Zermelo adopted Foundation into his own system in 1930 (from previous work of [[von Neumann]] 1925–1929) interest in non-well-founded sets waned for decades.{{sfnp|Aczel|1988|p=107}} An early non-well-founded set theory was [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]’s [[New Foundations]], although it is not merely ZF with a replacement for Foundation.

Several proofs of the independence of Foundation from the rest of ZF were published in 1950s particularly by [[Paul Bernays]] (1954), following an announcement of the result in earlier paper of his from 1941, and by [[Ernst Specker]] who gave a different proof in his [[Habilitationsschrift]] of 1951, proof which was published in 1957. Then in 1957 [[Rieger's theorem]] was published, which gave a general method for such proof to be carried out, rekindling some interest in non-well-founded axiomatic systems.{{sfnp|Aczel|1988|pp=107–108}} The next axiom proposal came in a 1960 congress talk of [[Dana Scott]] (never published as a paper), proposing an alternative axiom now called [[Anti-Foundation Axiom|SAFA]].{{sfnp|Aczel|1988|pp=108–109}} Another axiom proposed in the late 1960s was [[Maurice Boffa]]'s axiom of [[superuniversality]], described by Aczel as the highpoint of research of its decade.{{sfnp|Aczel|1988|p=110}} Boffa's idea was to make foundation fail as badly as it can (or rather, as extensionality permits): Boffa's axiom implies that every [[extensionality|extensional]] [[binary relation|set-like]] relation is isomorphic to the elementhood predicate on a transitive class.

A more recent approach to non-well-founded set theory, pioneered by M. Forti and F. Honsell in the 1980s, borrows from computer science the concept of a [[bisimulation]]. Bisimilar sets are considered indistinguishable and thus equal, which leads to a strengthening of the [[axiom of extensionality]]. In this context, axioms contradicting the axiom of regularity are known as '''anti-foundation axioms''', and a set that is not necessarily well-founded is called a '''hyperset'''.

Four mutually [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] anti-foundation axioms are well-known, sometimes abbreviated by the first letter in the following list:
# '''A'''FA ("Anti-Foundation Axiom") – due to M. Forti and F. Honsell (this is also known as [[Aczel's anti-foundation axiom]]);
# '''S'''AFA ("Scott’s AFA") – due to [[Dana Scott]],
# '''F'''AFA ("Finsler’s AFA") – due to [[Paul Finsler]],
# '''B'''AFA ("Boffa’s AFA") – due to [[Maurice Boffa]].
They essentially correspond to four different notions of equality for non-well-founded sets. The first of these, AFA, is based on [[accessible pointed graph]]s (apg) and states that two hypersets are equal if and only if they can be pictured by the same apg.  Within this framework, it can be shown that the so-called [[Quine atom]], formally defined by Q={Q}, exists and is unique.

Each of the axioms given above extends the universe of the previous, so that: [[Von Neumann universe|V]] ⊆ A ⊆ S ⊆ F ⊆ B. In the Boffa universe, the distinct Quine atoms form a proper class.&lt;ref&gt;Nitta, Okada, Tsouvaras (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worth emphasizing that hyperset theory is an extension of classical set theory rather than a replacement: the well-founded sets within a hyperset domain conform to classical set theory.

== Applications ==
{{expand section|date=November 2012}}
Aczel’s hypersets were extensively used by [[Jon Barwise]] and [[John Etchemendy]] in their 1987 book ''The Liar'', on the [[liar's paradox]]; The book is also good introduction to the topic of non-well-founded sets.

Boffa’s superuniversality axiom has found application as a basis for axiomatic [[nonstandard analysis]].{{sfnp|Kanovei|Reeken|2004|p=303}}

'''Perspicacity''' (also called '''perspicaciousness''') is a penetrating discernment (from the Latin perspicācitās, meaning sharpsightedness, discrimination)—a clarity of [[Visionary|vision]] or [[intellect]] which provides a deep understanding and insight.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Curriculum Building in Nursing |author=Em Olivia Bevis |year=1989 |page=134 |isbn=978-0-7637-0941-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 17th-century Europe, [[René Descartes]] devised systematic rules for clear thinking in his work ''[[Rules for the Direction of the Mind|Regulæ ad directionem ingenii]]'' (Rules for the direction of natural intelligence). In Descartes' scheme, intelligence consisted of two faculties: perspicacity, which provided an understanding or intuition of distinct detail; and sagacity, which enabled reasoning about the details in order to make deductions. Rule 9 was ''De Perspicacitate Intuitionis'' (On the Perspicacity of Intuition).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Regulæ ad directionem ingenii |author=[[René Descartes]], edited and translated by George Heffernan |isbn=978-90-420-0138-1 |year=1998 |publisher=Rodopi |page=122 |chapter=Regula IX De Perspicacitate Intuitionis}}&lt;/ref&gt; He summarised the rule as  {{quote|''Oportet ingenii aciem ad res minimas et maxime faciles totam convertere, atque in illis diutius immorari, donec assuescamus veritatem distincte et perspicue intueri.''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We should totally focus the vision of the natural intelligence on the smallest and easiest things, and we should dwell on them for a long time, so long, until we have become accustomed to intuiting the truth distinctly and perspicuously.}}

In his study of the elements of [[wisdom]], the modern psychometrician [[Robert Sternberg]] identified perspicacity as one of its six components or dimensions; the other five being [[reasoning]], [[wikt:sagacity|sagacity]], [[learning]], [[judgement]] and the expeditious use of [[information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Wisdom |author=[[Robert J. Sternberg]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-521-36718-9 |pages=146, 157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his analysis, perspicacity was described as {{quote|...has [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]]; can offer solutions that are on the side of right and truth;  is able to see through things &amp;mdash; read between the lines; has the ability to understand and interpret his or her environment.|Robert J. Sternberg |Wisdom: its nature, origins, and development}}

In an article dated October 7, 1966, [[Science (journal)|the journal ''Science'']] discussed [[NASA]] [[NASA Astronaut Corps|scientist-astronaut program]] recruitment efforts:
{{quote|To quote an Academy brochure, the quality most needed by a scientist-astronaut is "perspicacity." He must, the brochure says, be able to quickly pick out, from among the thousands of things he sees, those that are significant, and to synthesize observations and develop and test working hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Scientist-Astronauts: Only the "Perspicacious" Need Apply |journal=Science |date=7 October 1966 |volume=154 |pages=133–135 |doi=10.1126/science.154.3745.133 |issue=3745 |pmid=17740099 |author=Carter LJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Being perspicacious about other people, rather than having false illusions, is a sign of good mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.atypon-link.com/GPI/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.2006.25.5.542 |journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology |issn=0736-7236 |volume=25 | issue=5 |date=May 2006 |pages=542–564 |title=On Seeing Clearly and Thriving: Interpersonal Perspicacity as Adaptive (Not Depressive) Realism (Or Where Three Theories Meet) |doi=10.1521/jscp.2006.25.5.542}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quality is needed in  [[psychotherapist]]s who engage in person-to-person dialogue and counselling of the mentally ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Blaine Fowers |year=2005 |title=Virtue and psychology |pages=107–128 |publisher=American Psychological Association |isbn=978-1-59147-251-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[René Magritte]] illustrated the quality in his 1936 painting ''Perspicacity''. The picture shows an artist at work who studies his subject intently: it is an egg.  But the painting which he is creating is not of an egg; it is an adult bird in flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Everyday Practice of Science |author=[[Frederick Grinnell (biologist)|Frederick Grinnell]] |page=84 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-506457-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7578">'''Professional courtesy''' generally refers to a philosophy of particular professional behavior or etiquette which is extended between members of the same profession. The concept of professional courtesy is believed to have originated within the ancient practice of medicine by where physicians provided services to other physicians without charge. However, the philosophy does not necessarily involve the same courtesy across all professions. Nor is professional courtesy a mandated privilege, but is freely given at the discretion of the party extending the courtesy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cji.edu/site/assets/files/1921/professionalcourtesy.pdf|title=Professional Courtesy Ethics in Policing|last=McVay|first=Jerold A.|date=2012-04-22|website=Crim. Justice Institute|publisher=Univ. of Arkansas|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the etiquette is not limited to physicians, the medical profession is likely the oldest and most well known for having such a long-standing tradition of professional courtesy among its professionals. Some other well known groups who have some form of professional courtesy also include attorneys, performing arts, and law enforcement. The phrase may also be applied in a literal form, such as the required ethical behavior of lawyers towards each other.&lt;ref name="KBA"&gt;{{cite web| title = Code of Professional Courtesy| work = Kentucky Bar Association| url = http://www.kybar.org/Default.aspx?tabid=228| accessdate = 2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In medicine==
In 1803, [[Thomas Percival]] wrote his classic essay on medical ethics which endorsed complimentary professional care to “All members of the profession, including apothecaries as well as physicians and surgeons, together with their wives and children, should be attended gratuitously.” In 1847, the American Medical Association’s Code of Ethics similarly endorsed withholding charges for services to other physicians and their families,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; known as professional courtesy. This is likely the first modern day documentation of the philosophy.

Among [[physician]]s, it has been historically traditional to provide medical care at no or reduced cost to physician colleagues and their immediate family members.&lt;ref name="ama"&gt;{{cite web| title = AMA Code of Medical Ethics, E-6.13, Professional Courtesy| work = | url = http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-ethics/code-medical-ethics/opinion613.page?| accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original purpose of this was to discourage physicians from treating themselves and members of their own family.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Jones, MD, PhD, MHA|first = James|last2 = McCullough, PhD|first2 = Laurence|last3 = Richman, MA|first3 = Bruce|date = 2004-05-01|title = Ethics of Professional Courtesy|url = http://www.jvascsurg.org/article/S0741-5214(04)00144-2/pdf|journal = Journal of Vascular Surgery|volume = 39|issue = 5|pages = 1140–1141|doi = 10.1016/j.jvs.2004.01.035|pmid =|lay-url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom dates back to [[Hippocrates]],&lt;ref name="mm"&gt;Rathbun, Katharine C., M.D.; Richards, Edward P. III, J.D.; ''Professional Courtesy''; Missouri Medicine; 1998;95:18-20; [http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/Articles/Professional_Courtesy.html (on-line)].&lt;/ref&gt; well before physicians reached middle-class income levels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  However, physicians regularly providing free or reduced rate services as professional courtesy must remain mindful in the age of copays, insurance only billing, and referrals, the practice can run afoul of the law under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hawleytroxell.com/2011/12/professional-courtesy-problems/|title = Professional Courtesy Problems - Hawley Troxell - Health Law|last =|first =|date =|year = 2011|publisher = Hawley Troxell - Health Law|access-date = 2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the American Medical Association issued a Code of Medical Ethics Opinion advising free of charge and reduced rate services was not an ethical requirement, and physicians should use their own judgment in deciding to extend such professional courtesy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-ethics/code-medical-ethics/opinion613.page?|title=Code of Medical Ethics Opinion 6.13 - Professional Courtesy|last=|first=|date=1994-06-01|website=American Medical Association|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In law enforcement ==
The term has been used to refer to the practice by law enforcement officers allowing other officers to engage in traffic violations and some crimes without being reported or arrested. There are three tools that law enforcement officers use to implement "professional courtesy":

First, some states (such as [[California]]) issue "confidential [[Vehicle registration plate|plate]]s" to employees in law enforcement, and other public officials. The plates keep identities and addresses anonymous, allowing employees the inadvertent ability to travel on toll-ways without charge.&lt;ref name = "Corrupt"&gt;{{cite web| title = Special license plates shield officials from traffic tickets| work = ocregister.com|url = http://www.ocregister.com/articles/dmv-police-confidential-2011354-program-records | accessdate = 2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even serious offences such as drunk driving are subject to professional courtesy "discretion", and [[federal law]] assists in the process by exempting police officers and firefighters from a federal law that requires truck drivers to be blood-tested after an accident.&lt;ref name = "DUI Cops"&gt;{{cite news| title = A broken system works in favor of cops busted for DUI| work = seattlepi.com|url = http://www.seattlepi.com/specials/undueinfluence/326446_dui06.html | accessdate = 2009-06-02| first1=Eric| last1=Nalder| first2=Lewis| last2=Kamb| first3=P-I| last3=Investigative| date=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, there is a web site offering law enforcement employees the purchase of a "family card" they can give to friends and family to produce at, for example, a traffic stop to identify them to the officer as a family member.  Anti-police groups and people wary of the ethical actions of police officers purport that where an ordinary member of the public would get a ticket this notification card will cause the officer to overlook any violations of the law the person may have made and tell them to go on their way.&lt;ref name = "police"&gt;{{cite web| title = Professional Courtesy| work = NJLawman.com|url = http://njlawman.com/Feature%20Pieces/Professional%20Courtesy.htm| accessdate = 2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vendor of this card is explicit about the intention behind these cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leoprocards.com/|title=LEOProCards|work=|accessdate=2012-08-05}}http://leoprocards.com/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619001525/http://leoprocards.com/ |date=2012-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In theater ==
Until the 1960s it was customary for theater managements to permit members of [[Actors' Equity Association|Actors Equity]] and other members of the profession into Broadway shows for free. This practice continues in the [[Off-Off-Broadway]] world where members of Equity must be admitted free of charge to any Showcase production in which there is a member of the union in the cast if there are seats left at curtain time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actorsequity.org AEA website]&lt;/ref&gt; This applies as well to ''bona fide'' producers, directors and casting directors, who do not have to wait until showtime to be seated.

'''Proof-of-authority''' ('''PoA''') is an [[algorithm]] used with [[blockchain]]s that delivers comparatively fast transactions through a consensus mechanism based on identity as a stake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-blockchain-needs-proof-of-authority-instead-of-proof-of-stake|title=Why Blockchain Needs ‘Proof of Authority’ Instead of ‘Proof of Stake’|work=Cointelegraph|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proof-of-authority==
In PoA-based networks, transactions and blocks are validated by approved accounts, known as validators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=parity: Fast, light, robust Ethereum implementation|date=2017-12-12|url=https://github.com/paritytech/parity|publisher=Parity Technologies|accessdate=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Validators run software allowing them to put transactions in blocks. The process is automated and does not require validators to be constantly monitoring their computers. It, however, does require maintaining the computer (the authority [[node (networking)|node]]&lt;ref name="enuma-io"/&gt;) uncompromised. The term was coined by [[Gavin Wood]], co-founder of [[Ethereum]] and Parity Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/ethereum/guide/blob/master/poa.md|title=PoA Private Chains|last=Gavin|first=Wood|date=November 2015|website=Github|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With PoA, individuals earn the right to become validators, so there is an incentive to retain the position that they have gained. By attaching a reputation to identity, validators are incentivized to uphold the transaction process, as they do not wish to have their identities attached to a negative reputation. This is considered more robust than PoS ([[proof-of-stake]]), as:
* In PoS, while a stake between two parties may be even, it does not take into account each party’s total holdings. This means that incentives can be unbalanced. 
* Meanwhile, PoW uses an enormous amount of computing power, which, in itself lowers incentive. It is also vulnerable to attack, as a potential attacker would only need to have 51% of the mining resources (hashrate) to control a network, although this is not easy to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.coinfox.info/news/reviews/6417-proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-merits-and-disadvantages|title=Proof-of-Work vs Proof-of-Stake: merits and disadvantages|last=superadmin|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On the other hand, PoA only allows non-consecutive block approval from any one validator, meaning that the risk of serious damage is centralized to the authority node.

PoA is suited for both private networks and public networks, like POA Network, where trust is distributed.&lt;ref name="enuma-io"/&gt;

== Comparisons ==
{{main|Proof-of-work|Proof-of-stake}}
* The [[proof-of-work]] (PoW) consensus uses a [[cryptocurrency mining|mining]] mechanism, where PoA does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blockgeeks.com/guides/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake/|title=Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake: Basic Mining Guide|date=2017-03-15|work=Blockgeeks|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[proof-of-stake]] (PoS) mechanism works using an algorithm that selects participants with the highest stakes as validators, assuming that the highest stakeholders are incentivized to ensure a transaction is processed. PoW works by verifying that work (mining) has been done before transactions are carried out.&lt;ref name="enuma-io"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.enuma.io/update/2017/08/29/proof-of-authority-ethereum-networks.html|title=Rolling your own Proof-of-Authority Ethereum consortium|website=blog.enuma.io|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Meanwhile, PoA uses identity as the sole verification of the authority to validate, meaning that there is no need to use mining.
* [[Delegated proof-of-stake]] (DPoS) works using witnesses, who generate blocks. Witnesses are elected by stakeholders at a rate of one vote per share per witness. However, with PoA, the appointment of an authority is automatic, meaning that there can be no bias or uneven process caused by unequal stakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bitshares.org/technology/delegated-proof-of-stake-consensus/|title=Delegated Proof-of-Stake Consensus - BitShares|website=bitshares.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In PoA, validators need to have their identity verified formally via DApps, and have this identity information available in the public domain for everyone to cross-reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/oracles-network/proof-of-authority-consensus-model-with-identity-at-stake-d5bd15463256|title=Proof of Authority: consensus model with Identity at Stake.|last=Network|first=Oracles|date=2017-11-11|website=Medium|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Since PoA security is centralized in the form of the authority node, a lot of PoA critics wonder the point of using a blockchain for this kind of usages - stating that PoA blockchains are not really decentralized and a simple DB would be more efficient, faster, and cost effective.

{{Buddhism}}
'''''Rangtong''''' and '''''shentong''''' are two [[Distinctive feature|distinctive]] views on emptiness ([[sunyata]]) and the [[two truths doctrine]] within [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

''Rangtong'' ({{bo|w=rang stong}}; "empty of self-nature") is a [[Buddhist philosophy|philosophical]] term in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] that is used to distinguish the majority Madhyamaka teaching on the nature of [[śūnyatā]] or "emptiness", namely that all phenomena are empty of an enduring and/or unchanging essence or "self," and that this emptiness is not an absolute reality, but a mere nominal characterisation of phenomena.&lt;ref name=Stearns/&gt; It is related to the ''[[prasangika]]'' approach, which argues that no syllogistic forms of reasoning should be used to debate the notion of inherent existence, but only arguments which show the logical implications and absurdity of positions based upon inherent existence. This position is the mainstream Gelugpa interpretation of [[Madhyamaka]], one of the main [[Mahayana]] schools, which dominates [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism.

''Shentong'' ({{Bo|t=གཞན་སྟོང་|w=gzhan stong|l=ɕɛ̃̀tṍŋ}}, also transliterated ''zhäntong'' or ''zhentong''; literally "other-emptiness") is a position within Tibetan Madhyamaka. It applies ''śūnyatā'' in a specific way, agreeing that relative reality is empty of self-nature, but stating that absolute reality (''Paramarthasatya''){{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=21}}{{refn|group=note|name="Absolute"}} is "non-dual [[Buddha-nature|Buddhajnana]]"{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=21}}{{refn|group=note|name="Buddhajnana"}} and "empty" ({{bo|w=stong}}) only of "other," ({{bo|w=gzhan}}) relative phenomena, but is itself not empty{{sfn|Stearns|1999|p=3}} and "truly existing."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=12}} This absolute reality is described by positive terms, an approach which helps "to overcome certain residual subtle concepts"{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=22}} and "the habit [...] of negating whatever experience arises in his/her mind."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=23}} It destroys false concepts, as does ''prasangika'', but it also alerts the practitioner "to the presence of a dynamic, positive Reality that is to be experienced once the conceptual mind is defeated."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=23}}

Shentong was systematized and articulated under that name by [[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen]] (1292–1361), who identified absolute reality with the Buddha-nature.{{sfn|Stearns|1999|p=3}} Shentong was suppressed by the dominant Gelug school for several hundred years, equally for political reasons as doctrinal reasons. In 1658, the [[Gelug]] authorities banned the Jonang school for political reasons, forcibly converting its [[bhikkhu|monks]] and monasteries to the Gelug school, as well as banning shentong philosophy and books, thus making the rangtong position the overwhelmingly majority one in Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;ref name=Stearns/&gt;

After this suppression various shentong views were propagated mainly by [[Karma Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] lamas. The 19th century saw a revival of Shentong-views,{{sfn|Stearns|2002|p=76}} and continued with the [[Rimé movement]]. Nowadays Shentong is present primarily as the main philosophical theory of the [[Jonang]] school, although it is also taught by the [[Sakya]] and [[Kagyu]] schools,&lt;ref name=TaiSitupa&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pema Tönyö Nyinje, 12th Tai Situpa|authorlink1=Pema Tönyö Nyinje|title=Ground, Path and Fruition|publisher=Zhyisil Chokyi Ghatsal Charitable Trust|isbn=978-1877294358|page=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=13}} where it is identified with centerless awareness.

==Etymology==
The term ''rangtong'' is not an autonym but rather arose from the shentong theorist [[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen]], who coined the term "shentong" to characterise his own teachings and "rangtong" to refer to the teachings he opposed.&lt;ref name=Stearns /&gt;

''Shentong'' literally means "other-emptiness", "empty" ({{bo|w=stong}}) of "other" ({{bo|w=gzhan}}), i.e., empty of all qualities other than its own inherent existent.  Yet, the term ''shentong'' also refers to Yogacara teachings,{{sfn|Brunholzl|2009|p=446}} or ''Yogacara Madhyamaka'',{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=22}} which includes the teachings of [[Śāntarakṣita]]. In the Gelugpa understanding of the [[Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika distinction]], ''Yogacara Madhyamaka'' is labeled as ''svatantrika'', and set against a strict ''prasaṅgika'' approach which rejects any inherent existence.

Another translation of ''shentong'' is "extrinsic emptiness,"{{sfn|Pettit|1999|p=113}} a term which is also used to refer to "Great Mādhyamaka" (''dbu ma chen po''), a term which has also been used by [[Longchenpa|Klong chen pa]] and [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham]] to refer to Prasaṅgika Madhyamaka, and [[Tsongkhapa]] has also used this term.{{sfn|Pettit|1999|p=113}}

==Rangtong==
''Rangtong'' is the majority Tibetan teaching on the nature of [[śūnyatā]] or "emptiness", namely that all phenomena are empty of a self-nature in both the relative and absolute sense, without positing anything beyond that.&lt;ref name=Stearns&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stearns|first1=Cyrus|title=The Buddha from Dölpo: A Study of the Life and Thought of the Tibetan Master Dölpopa Sherab Gyaltsen|date=2010|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=9781559393430|edition=Rev. and enl.|url=https://books.google.fi/books?id=t9rlyjOHZ98C&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;ots=ZB4NCICYy9&amp;dq=%22The%20Buddha%20from%20D%C3%B6lpo%20%3A%20a%20study%20of%20the%20life%20and%20thought%20of%20the%20Tibetan%20master%20D%C3%B6lpopa%20Sherab%20Gyaltsen%22&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=autonym&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position is the mainstream Tibetan interpretation of [[Madhyamaka]], especially by the followers of [[Prasaṅgika]] [[Madhyamaka|Mādhyamaka]]

[[Tsongkhapa]] (1357–1419), who also wrote in response to ''shentong'', is the most outspoken defendant of ''rangtong''. He saw [[Sunyata|emptiness]] as a consequence of dependent designation, the teaching that no ''thing or phenomenon'' has an existence of its own, but always comes into existence in dependence upon conceptual designation by a conscious mind. (See [[Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika distinction#Designation .26 .22Conventional Truth.22|Designation &amp; "Conventional Truth"]])

Tsongkhapa's view on "ultimate reality" is condensed in the sort text ''In Praise of Dependent Arising''&lt;ref name="Berzin"&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/en/tibetan-buddhism/original-texts/sutra-texts/in-praise-of-dependent-arising Alexander Berzin, ''In Praise of Dependent Arising'']&lt;/ref&gt; c.q. ''In Praise of Relativity''&lt;ref name="RobertThurman"&gt;[http://www.bodhicitta.net/Essence%20of%20Eloquence.htm Robert Thurman, ''Praise of Buddha Shakyamuni for his teaching of Relativity. The Short Essence of Eloquence'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PatrickJennings" /&gt; c.q. ''The Essence of Eloquency''.&lt;ref name="PatrickJennings" /&gt; It states that "things" ''do'' exist conventionally, but ultimately everything is dependently arisen, and therefore void of inherent existence:&lt;ref name="PatrickJennings" /&gt;
{{quote|Whatever depends on causes and conditions&lt;br&gt;Is empty of intrinsic reality&lt;br&gt;What excellent instruction could there be&lt;br&gt;More marvellous than this discovery?&lt;ref name="PatrickJennings"&gt;[http://thenonbuddhist.com/2014/01/12/tsongkhapa-in-praise-of-relativity-the-essence-of-eloquence/ Patrick Jennings, ''Tsongkhapa: In Praise of Relativity; The Essence of Eloquence''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518074106/http://thenonbuddhist.com/2014/01/12/tsongkhapa-in-praise-of-relativity-the-essence-of-eloquence/ |date=2015-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This means that conventionally things ''do'' exist, and that there is no use in denying that. But it also means that ultimately those things have no 'existence of their own', and that cognizing then as such results from cognitive operations, not from some unchangeable essence.&lt;ref name="SusanKahn"&gt;[http://emptinessteachings.com/2014/09/11/the-two-truths-of-buddhism-and-the-emptiness-of-emptiness/ Susan Kahn, ''The Two Truths of Buddhism and The Emptiness of Emptiness'']&lt;/ref&gt; Tsongkhapa:
{{quote|Since objects do not exist through their own nature, they are established as existing through the force of convention.&lt;ref name="SusanKahn" /&gt;}}

It also means that there is no "transcendental ground," and that "ultimate reality" has no existence of its own, but is the negation of such a transcendental reality, and the impossibility of any statement on such an ultimately existing transcendental reality: it is no more than a fabrication of the mind.&lt;ref name="PatrickJennings" /&gt; Susan Kahn further explains:
{{quote|Ultimate truth does not point to a transcendent reality, but to the transcendence of deception. It is critical to emphasize that the ultimate truth of emptiness is a negational truth. In looking for inherently existent phenomena it is revealed that it cannot be found. This absence is not findable because it is not an entity, just as a room without an elephant in it does not contain an elephantless substance. Even conventionally, elephantlessness does not exist. Ultimate truth or emptiness does not point to an essence or nature, however subtle, that everything is made of.&lt;ref name="SusanKahn" /&gt;}}

==Shentong==
[[File:Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen.jpg|thumb|[[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen]], an early Tibetan exponent of the shentong view.]]

===Philosophy===
{{See also|Buddha-nature|l1=Buddha-nature|Two truths doctrine#East Asian Buddhism|l2=Two Truths doctrine in China}}

''Shentong'' views the [[two truths doctrine]] as distinguishing between relative and absolute reality, agreeing that relative reality is empty of self-nature, but stating that absolute reality is "empty" ({{bo|w=stong}}) only of "other" ({{bo|w=gzhan}}) relative phenomena, but is itself not empty.{{sfn|Stearns|1999|p=3}} This absolute reality is the "ground or substratum" which is "uncreated and undestructible, noncomposite and beyond the chain of dependent origination."{{sfn|Stearns|1999|p=82}} Dolpopa identified this absolute reality with the Buddha-nature.{{sfn|Stearns|1999|p=3}}

The shentong-view is related to the [[Ratnagotravibhāga]] sutra and the Yogacara-Madhyamaka synthesis of [[Śāntarakṣita]]. The truth of sunyata is acknowledged, but not considered to be the highest truth, which is the [[Nature of mind (Buddhism)|empty nature of mind]]. Insight into sunyata is preparatory for the recognition of the nature of mind.

[[Shenpen Hookham|Hookham]] explains the Shentong position, referring to her Kagyu teacher [[Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche|Khenpo Tsultrim]]'s ''Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness''.{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=19}} Khenpo Tsultrim presents five stages of meditation, which he relates to five different schools or approaches:{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=19-26}}{{sfn|Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso|1994}}
* "Sravaka meditation on non-self" - meditation on the emptiness of the skandhas and the non-existence of a personal self;
* "Cittamatra-approach" - meditation on the mind-stream, the ever-continuing process of perception, and the non-duality of perceived and perceiver;
* "Svatantrika-Madhyamaka approach" - meditation on all dhammas, which are empty of self-nature, and the negation of any "substance";
* "Prasangika-Madhyamaka approach" - meditation on "the non-conceptual (nisprapanca) nature of both the appearance of phenomena and their self-emptiness." In this approach, all concepts are to be abandoned;
*  Shentong (Yogacara Madhyamaka) - meditation on ''Paramarthasatya'' ("Absolute Reality"),{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=21}}{{refn|group=note|name="Absolute"|According to Hookham, non-dual experience is Ultimate Reality.{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=37}}}} ''Buddhajnana'',{{refn|group=note|name="Buddhajnana"|According to Hookham, "The Chinese Tathagarba schools describe Buddhajnana as the totality of all that is, which pervades every part of all that is in its totality."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=37}} According to Hookham, for Shentong Buddhajnana is "the non-dual nature of Mind completely unobscured and endowed with its countless Buddha Qualities (''Buddhagunas'').{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=37}}}} which is beyond concepts, and described by terms as "truly existing."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=22}} This approach helps "to overcome certain residual subtle concepts,"{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=22}} and "the habit - fosterd on the earlier stages of the path - of negating whatever experience arises in his/her mind."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=23}} It destroys false concepts, as does prasangika, but it also alerts the practitioner "to the presence of a dynamic, positive Reality that is to be experienced once the conceptual mind is defeated."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=23}}

===Origins and development===
The notion of ''sentong'' grew out the Tibetan attempts to reconcile the contradiction between the Madhyama stance on the emptiness of phenomena, and the later notion of an eternal [[Buddha-nature]].{{sfn|Stearns|1999|p=1}}

The earliest shentong views are usually asserted to have been presented in a group of treatises variously attributed jointly to [[Asanga]] and [[Maitreya-nātha|Maitreyanātha]], especially in the treatise known as the ''[[Ratnagotravibhāga (text)|Unsurpassed Continuum]]'' (''Uttaratantraśāstra'', also called the ''Ratnagotravibhāga''),{{sfn|Hokham|1991}} and in a body of Mādhyamaka treatises attributed to [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] (e.g., the ''[[Dharmadhātustava]]'', "In praise of the [[Dharmadhatu]]").{{sfn|Brunnhölzl|2008}}

The first exposition of a shentong view is sometimes attributed to [[Śāntarakṣita]] ( 725–788), but most scholars argue that his presentation of Madhyamaka thought is more accurately labeled ''Yogācāra-Svātantrika-Madhyamaka''. The eleventh-century Tibetan master [[Yumo Mikyo Dorje]], a student of the Kashmiri scholar Somanatha, was possibly the first Tibetan master to articulate a shentong view, after his experiences during a [[Kalachakra|Kālacakra]] retreat.{{sfn|Stearns|1999}}

Shentong was systematized and articulated under that name by [[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen]] (1292–1361),{{sfn|Stearns|1999|p=2}} who originally was [[Sakya]]-trained [[lama]], and joined the [[Jonang]] school with which ''shentong'' is strongly associated. In 1321 Dolpopa visited [[Tsurphu]] Monastery for the first time, and had extensive discussions with [[Rangjung Dorje, 3rd Karmapa Lama|Rangjung Dorje]] (1284–1339) about doctrinal issues. It appears that Rangjung Dorje almost certainly influenced the development of some of Dolpopa's theories, possibly including his shentong method.{{sfn|Stearns|1999|p=17, 47-48, 51-52, 61}}{{refn|group=note|See also Karl Brunnhölzl (2008), ''In Praise of Dharmadhatu'', a translation of Rangjung Dorje's commentary on the ''[[Dharmadhātustava]]'', "I  Parise of the Dharmadhatu," a treatise which is (incorrectly) attributed to Nagarjuna.}} Dolpopa claimed to have extraordinary insights,{{refn|group=note|Dolpopa: "I discovered many profound essential points which have not been discovered, have not been realized, and have not been mastered by egotistical scholars, most great meditators endowed with experience and realization, and most of those who are arrogant as great upholders of secret mantra. Because a fine realization burst forth from within, and because I have an exceptional certainty untainted by doubts, not only most great meditators endowed with experience and realization, and those who are arrogant as great upholders of secret mantra, but even the Buddha definitely could not turn me back from this."{{sfn|Stearns|1999|p=54}}}} and his meditational experience seems to have played a great role in the development of his ''shentong''-stance.{{sfn|Stears|1999|p=46-47}} Dolpopa developed a new philosophical vocabulary, based on Sanskrit and Tibetan, to express his insights, presenting provisional statements on absolute reality and Buddha-nature as statements of definitive meaning, which didn't requite further interpretation.{{sfn|Stears|1999|p=48-49}}

[[Chödrak Gyatso, 7th Karmapa Lama]] (1454–1506), and the Sakya scholar Sakya Chokden ({{bo|w=gSer mdog Pan chen Sa kya mChog ldan}}, 1428–1507) were also important proponents of a shentong view.{{sfn|Stearns|1999|p=60-63}} In the [[Jonang]] tradition, [[Taranatha|Tāranātha]] [1575–1635] is second in importance only to Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen himself. He was responsible for the short-lived renaissance of the school as a whole in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, and of the widespread revitalization of the shentong theory in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns 1999 p.68&lt;/ref&gt;

After the suppression of the Jonang school and its texts and the texts of Sakya Chokden by the Tibetan government in the seventeenth century, various shentong views were propagated mainly by [[Karma Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] lamas. In particular, the eighth [[Tai Situpa]] (1700–1774) and [[Katok Tsewang Norbu]] (1698–1755)—Karma Kagyu and Nyingma lamas, respectively, and close colleagues—were very instrumental in reviving shentong among their sects.

Also instrumental was [[Situ Panchen]] (1700–1774), senior court chaplain in the [[Kingdom of Derge]], a student of Katok Tsewang Norbu. "In the end it would be Situ more than anyone who would create the environment for the widespread acceptance of the Shentong theories in the next century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Buddha from Dolpo: A Study of the Life and Thought of the Tibetan Master Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen | first = Cyrus | last = Stearns | publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ., | year = 2003 | isbn = 81-208-1833-4 | page = 76 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zYiWkLTrU3oC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=Situ+Panchen&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA76,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This revival was continued by [[Jamgon Kongtrul]], a nineteenth-century [[Rimé movement|ecumenical]] (''rimé'') scholar and forceful exponent of shentong. shentong views were also advanced recently by the eminent Kagyu Lamas [[Kalu Rinpoche]] and [[Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche]].

===Criticisms and repression===
Shentong views have often come under criticism by followers of all four of the main Tibetan Buddhist schools, but particularly by the [[Gelug]]. Shentong was suppressed by the dominant Gelug school for several hundred years, equally for political reasons as doctrinal reasons. In 1658, the [[Gelug]] authorities banned the Jonang school for political reasons, forcibly converting its [[bhikkhu|monks]] and monasteries to the Gelug school, as well as banning shentong philosophy and books, thus making the rangtong position the overwhelmingly majority one in Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;ref name=Stearns/&gt;

"Exclusive Rangtongpas", as the contemporary western [[Kagyu]] scholar S.K. Hookham would call them, have claimed that shentong views are inconsistent with the basic [[mahayana|Mahāyāna]] teaching of [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]], because Shentongpas posit an absolute. They sometimes label ''shentong'' Madhyamaka "eternalistic Madhyamaka."

The great fourteenth-century Sakya master [[Buton Rinchen Drub]] (1290–1364) was very critical of shentong views. [[Gyaltsab Je]] and [[Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, 1st Panchen Lama]], two of Gelug founder Je Tsongkhapa’s primary disciples, were also particularly critical of the shentong views of their time.

Among Kagyupas and [[Nyingma]]pas, the noted nineteenth-century Nyingma lama [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso]] wrote works both supportive and critical of shentong positions,{{refn|group=note|I.e., in his ''Lion's Roar of Extrinsic Emptiness'' (q.v. external link cited below) and in his ''Long Excursus on the Core of Thus-Arrivedness'' i.e., ''tathãgatagarbha'' (''bde-gshegs snying-po stong-thun chen-mo seng-ge'i nga-ro''). In the ''Long Excursus'' Mipham Rinpoche follows closely the gist of an historically much earlier discussion of the subject of "lineage", {{refn|group=note|(Tib. ''rigs'', Skt. ''gotta''), synonymous with Buddha-nature}} that of [[Longchenpa]]'s ''Treasure of Philosophical Systems'' (''grub mtha' mdzod''). There Mipham identifies two general extremes of interpretation, the nihilistic identification of Buddha-nature with emptiness to the exclusion of form, and the identification of Buddha-nature as a substantially real entity that is "empty-of-other" (''gzhan-gyis stong-pa''). Thus it appears that Mipham Rinpoche wished to distance himself from both the Gelug/Sakya mainstream (e.g., rangtong or self-emptiness) interpretation as well as the shentong mainstream. However, what Mipham refers to in the ''Long Excursus'' as shentong is only vaguely defined as such, and to that extent, bears more resemblance to the stock misinterpretations of shentong as given by its ideological opponents, than with any actual position held by classical ''Shentongpas'' themselves. In the final analysis, both [[Longchenpa]]'s and Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso's interpretations of Buddha-nature in the aforementioned texts are substantially identical with most (though not all) of the most important philosophical distinctions invoked by Dolpopa and others in propounding the superiority and definitude of shentong approaches. Where [[Longchenpa]] and [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham]] differ most obviously from self-identified ''Shentongpa'' commentators is in not applying the shentong label to their positions, such as ''Great Madhyamaka of Other-Emptiness" (''gzhan-stong dbu-ma chen-po'').}} as did  [[Mikyö Dorje, 8th Karmapa Lama]].

==Scholarly studies==
According to Burchardi, limited attention given in academic studies to the various interpretations of ''gzhan stong''.&lt;ref&gt;Burchardi, Anne (2007). ''A Look at the Diversity of the Gzhan stong Tradition''. JIATS, no. 3 (December 2007), THDL #T3128, 24 pp. 2007 by Anne Burchardi, IATS, and THDL. Source: [http://www.thdl.org/collections/journal/jiats/index.php?doc=jiats03burchardi.xml&amp;s=d0e287] (accessed: Sunday August 17, 2008) p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary western Kagyu scholar Karl Brunnhölzl argues that there is no such thing as "shentong Madhyamaka," but rather that orthodox [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]] philosophy (when understood properly) is entirely compatible with Madhyamaka, and therefore shentong is not a novel position. He argues that Yogācāra has often been mischaracterized and unfairly marginalized in Tibetan Buddhist curricula.

'''Satellite delay''' is the noticeable [[latency (engineering)|latency]] which occurs due to the [[speed of light]], when sending data to and from satellites, especially the much further out [[geosynchronous satellite]]s.  Bouncing a signal off one geosynchronous satellite takes about a quarter of a second, which is enough to be noticeable, but relaying data between 2 or 3 such satellites increases the delay further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Elbert |first1=Bruce R. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9k5s2-mMKgC&amp;dq |title=The Satellite Communication Applications Handbook |publisher=Artech House |year=2004 |isbn=978-1580538084 |accessdate=2014-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Secular Thought''''' (1887–1911) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[periodical]], published in [[Toronto]], dedicated to promoting the principles of [[freethought]] and [[secularism]]. Founded and edited during its first several years by English freethinker [[Charles Watts (secularist)|Charles Watts]], the editorship was assumed by Toronto printer and publisher [[James Spencer Ellis]] in 1891 when Watts returned to England. During that period, ''Secular Thought'' was the principal organ of the freethought movement in Canada, publishing large amounts of material from England and the United States in addition to commenting on Canadian affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ramsay Cook]], ''The Regenerators: Social Criticism in Late Victorian English Canada'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1985), pp. 46–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Zen Buddhism}}
'''Shoshin''' ([[wikt:初心|初心]]) is a word from [[Zen Buddhism]] meaning "'''beginner's mind.'''"  It refers to having an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions when studying a subject, even when studying at an advanced level, just as a beginner would. The term is especially used in the study of [[Zen Buddhism]] and [[Japanese martial arts]].{{cn|date=May 2014}}

The phrase is also discussed in the book ''[[Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind]]'' by [[Shunryu Suzuki]], a Zen teacher. Suzuki outlines the framework behind shoshin, noting "in the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind|first=Shunryu|last=Suzuki|year=1970|isbn=9780834800793|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1470">In mathematics, a '''simplicially enriched category''',  is a [[category (mathematics)|category]] [[enriched category|enriched]] over the category of [[simplicial set]]s. Simplicially enriched categories are often also called, more ambiguously, '''simplicial categories'''; the latter term however also applies to simplicial objects in Cat (the category of small categories). Simplicially enriched categories can, however, be identified with simplicial objects in Cat whose object part is constant, or more precisely, whose all face and degeneracy maps are bijective on objects. Simplicially enriched categories can model [[(∞, 1)-category|(∞, 1)-categories]], but the dictionary has to be carefully built. Namely many notions, limits for example, are different from the limits in the sense of enriched category theory.

'''Spin-stabilisation''' is the method of stabilizing a [[satellite]] or [[launch vehicle]] by means of spin. For most satellite applications this approach has been superseded by [[three-axis stabilisation]].  It is also used in non-satellite applications such as [[rifle]] and [[artillery]].

Despinning can be achieved by various techniques, including [[yo-yo de-spin]].

==Use==
On rockets with a solid motor upper stage, spin stabilization is used to keep the motor from drifting off course as they don't have their own thrusters. Usually small rockets are used to spin up the spacecraft and rocket then fire the rocket and send the craft off.

Rockets that use spin stabilization
* Jupiter C upper stages
* Delta II on some flights
* [[Minotaur V]]

The [[Pioneer 4]] spacecraft, the second object sent on a lunar flyby in [[1959 in spaceflight|1959]], maintained its attitude using spin-stabilization.&lt;ref name="The Moon Probe"&gt;

The [[Schiaparelli EDM lander]] was spun up to 2.5 RPM before being ejected from the [[ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter]] prior to its attempted landing on Mars in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://spaceflight101.com/exomars/schiaparelli-edm/&lt;/ref&gt;

Another spin-stabilized spacecraft is [[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]], which arrived at Jupiter orbit in 2016.

In operation as a third stage, the [[Star 48]] rocket booster sits on top of spin table, and before it is separated it is spun up to stabilize it during the separation from the previous stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mjAJNZYQ9K8C&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=Star+48B&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrsuykrZreAhUS2FMKHWvlD98Q6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Star%2048B&amp;f=false|title=Space Handbook: A War Fighter's Guide to Space, V. 1|last=Muolo|first=Michael J.|date=November 1993|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=9780160613555|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure-mapping theory''' is a theory of [[analogical reasoning]], developed by [[Dedre Gentner]],&lt;ref name="Gentner 1983"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gentner|first1=Dierdre|title=Structure-Mapping: A Theoretical Framework for Analogy|journal=Cognitive Science|date=1983|volume=7|pages=155–170|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/38bf/b182de181738eb50e142e215c67f4cbb4fe3.pdf|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for which she was awarded the 2016 [[Rumelhart Prize|David E. Rumelhart Prize]] for Contributions to the Theoretical Foundations of Human Cognition.&lt;ref name="rumelhart-prize" /&gt;

==Distinguishing analogy from other comparisons==

Structure-mapping theory aims to improve upon previous theories of analogy, by distinguishing analogy from literal similarity. Previous theories, like [[Amos Tversky]]'s contrast theory, assumed that an analogy is stronger, the more attributes the base and target have in common. Instead, structure-mapping theory recognizes that there can be differences between base and target domains which make no difference to the strength of the analogy. For example, we can see a battery as being like a reservoir despite them being different in shape, size, colour and substance.

Structure-mapping theory respond by arguing that it is not ''object attributes'' which are mapped in an analogy. Instead the theory contends that an analogy alerts the hearer to a similarity in the ''relationships'' between objects in a domain. The distinction is made in terms of the number of predicates - attributes are predicates with one argument, while relationships are predicates which take two or more arguments. So the proposition "x is large" asserts an attribute, while "x revolves around y" asserts a relationship. (Higher order predicates assert relationships between propositions)

===Analogy vs literal similarity===

By distinguishing attributes and relationships, we can distinguish literal similarities from analogies.

For example:
* The X12 star system in the Andromeda nebula is our solar system. - This is a literal similarity, because the intention is to map both relationships (e.g. between planets and the sun) and attributes (e.g. the size and temperature of the sun)
* The hydrogen atom is like our solar system. (Rutherford, 1906) - This is an analogy, because only relational predicates, like relative motion and size, are to be mapped between domains

===Analogy vs general laws===

Analogies can also be distinguished from general laws

* The hydrogen atom is a central force system. - This is a general law, in the sense that the base domain is an abstract domain of relationships, and actually includes no object attributes. Compare this to an analogy, where the base domain includes object attributes, which are ''excluded'' from the comparison.

===Analogy vs chronology===

The distinction in the role of objects, attributes and relationships in the comparison also allows us to characterise a '''chronology''' as a comparison in which objects are compared (remain relatively constant), but relationships are not (i.e. are expected to differ).

===Summary table===

Gentner provides the following table to summarize the different types of domain comparison above:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| || No. attributes mapped || No. relations mapped || Example
|-
| Literal similarity || Many || Many || The K5 solar system is like our solar system
|-
| Analogy || Few || Many || The atom is like our solar system
|-
| Abstraction || Few* || Many || The atom is a central force system
|-
| Anomaly || Few || Few || Coffee is like the solar system
|}

== Systematicity principle ==

"Part of our understanding about analogy is that it conveys a system of connected knowledge, not a mere assortment of independent facts. Such a system can be represented by an interconnected predicate structure in which higher-order predicates enforce connections among lower-order predicates. reflect this tacit preference for coherence in analogy, I propose the '''systematicity principle: A predicate that belongs to a mappable system of mutually interconnecting relationships is more likely to be imported into the target than is an isolated predicate.'''" (Gentner 1983, p162-163; emphasis added)

The systematicity principle helps to explain why, when comparing the atom to the solar system, we don't try to map the relative temperature of sun and the earth onto the nucleus-electron system. In short, the temperature has no strong connection to the other object relationships - such as distance, attractive force, relative mass, and relative motion (who revolves around who) - which we do map. What these other relationships share is a strong interdependence - reversing the mass relationship reverses the relative motion relationship, and changing the distance changes the attractive force, and so on.

'''Thomas Kretschmer''' (born 18 December 1955) is a [[Germany|German]] self-taught artist, specialising in carved wood "picture-images" ({{Interlanguage link multi|Bildschnitzer|de}}).&lt;ref name=TKportraitusw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ev-akademie-thueringen.de/index.php?we_objectID=746|title=Thomas Kretschmer: Reformation und Freiheit   ....

Before and during [[Die Wende|1989]] he was a Christian [[Activism|civil rights activist]] and pacifist who received disproportionate attention from the [[Stasi|security services]] over many years.  At various points between 1973 and 1985 he was held as a [[Political prisoner]] in the [[German Democratic Republic]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenTK&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/wer-war-wer-in-der-ddr-%2363%3B-1424.html?ID=1903|author2=|author1=Christian Halbrock|title=Kretschmer, Thomas  * 18.12.1955 Bürgerrechtler|publisher= Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur: Biographische Datenbanken |language= German| accessdate= 19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Kretschmer was born in [[Dornburg]], a small hilltop town some 12&amp;nbsp;km (7 miles) northeast of [[Jena]].   His father was a biologist: his mother was an education specialist.   He grew up in a [[Roman Catholic]] family and in 1970, at the age of 14 refused to participate in a [[Jugendweihe]], a secular "coming of age" ceremony which in the German Democratic Republic had some of the features of a [[Confirmation|church confirmation]].   He started a professional trade apprenticeship in 1970, but was excluded from further training or schooling in 1972 after he left the [[Free German Youth|Young Communists (FDJ / ''Freie Deutsche Jugend'')]] and announced his refusal to undertake [[military service]] with the [[National People's Army]]:&lt;ref name=JugoppTK&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jugendopposition.de/index.php?id=2005|title= Kretschmer, Thomas|work=DDR-Opposition|publisher=Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung &amp; Robert-Havemann-Gesellschaft e.V.

Kretschmer was persuaded to sign a declaration in which he undertook to [[Informal collaborators (East Germany)|collaborate]] with The Ministry.  Kretschmer had been identified as a committed [[Roman Catholic]] with good contacts among the youth community:  he had told his interrogators that he wanted to become a priest.&lt;ref name=StasilautTMinSpiegel0498/&gt;   He appears in Stasi records as "Agent Kaplain", along with a note by his handler that he was of "above average intelligence".&lt;ref name=StasilautTMinSpiegel0498/&gt;   Unusually, however, he had a change of heart a few days after his recruitment and wrote to his [[Agent handling|handler]] withdrawing the undertaking to collaborate.   He was nevertheless released in 1974 at the end of his fifteen-month sentence.  The [[Stasi]] continued, without success, to try and persuade him to collaborate with them.&lt;ref name=StasilautTMinSpiegel0498/&gt;

It displayed the brief but, in the context of the times, politically powerful injunction, "Learn Polish!" (''"Lernt polnisch!"'').&lt;ref name=TKBatik&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.havemann-gesellschaft.de/index.php?id=392|title=Lernt polnisch!|author=Thomas Kretschmer| publisher= Robert-Havemann-Gesellschaft e.V., Berlin|date=December 1981|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   His seasonal greeting was intercepted by the [[Intelligence collection management|censors]] and he was arrested in January 1982, spending the next six months being looked after by the [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security]] at their [[Berlin-Hohenschönhausen Memorial|Main Interrogation Centre]] in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenTK/&gt;

In August 1982 a military high court in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] condemned Kretschmer under sections §214, §245 and §246 of the criminal code for "activity affecting the state" and "public disrespect".   He was sentenced to four and a half years in prison, some of which he would spend in the country's only military prison, at Schwendt.

In January 1985 Kretschmer was transferred to the Stasi detention centre at [[Chemnitz|Karl-Marx-Stadt (as Chemnitz was then called)]] in preparation for his release to [[West Germany]].   Kretschmer refused to go to West Germany.   His case was taken up by [[Kurt Scharf|Archbishop Kurt Scharf]], [[Werner Leich|Bishop Werner Leich]], and by church organisations more generally, along with [[Amnesty International]] who nominated him their "prisoner of the year".&lt;ref name=GeraChronTK/&gt;      In July 1985 Kretschmer, who had by this time been transferred to [[Leipzig]],  was released.   He now worked, till 1989, as a church manual craftsman in [[:de:Ebersdorf (Saalburg-Ebersdorf)|Ebersdorf]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenTK/&gt;

The [[Die Wende|breach by protestors]] of the [[Berlin Wall]] in November 1989, and the ensuing evidence that the [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Soviet leadership]] had issued no orders to [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany|the military]] for the violent suppression of the burgeoning revolution opened the way for a succession of events that would lead to the demise, as a standalone one-party dictatorship,  of the [[German Democratic Republic]] and, in October 1990, [[German reunification]].   In regional [[Stasi]] establishments across the country one feature of the [[Peaceful revolution|revolutionary phase]] was a desperate scramble to destroy the paper records that the ministry officers had assiduously and meticulously built up and safeguarded during nearly four decades.   Protestors rushed across the country to prevent the destruction of the Stasi records, with varying degrees of success.   Thomas Kretsschmer participated in the occupation of the Stasi regional office at the ;little town of [[Bad Lobenstein]] and he was a member of the Thuringian Citizens' Committee for Resolving Stasi issues (''"thüringischen Bürgerkomitee zur Auflösung des MfS"'').   He participated in local politics as a member of the [[Bad Lobenstein|Lobenstein]] "Ecclesiastical Electorate Community" (''"Kirchliche Wählergemeinschaft"'').&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenTK/&gt;

Today (2015) Krestschmer lives quietly as a wood carver in [[Tegau]].  He also worked from 2001 in a specialist clinic in [[Stadtroda]] with physically handicapped patients.&lt;ref name=TKportraitusw/&gt;

In 2014 his [[civil resistance]] record was honoured in a [[Stasi Records Agency|BStU exhibition]] at the [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]].

{{Neuropsychology}}

'''Thought''' encompasses an “aim-free flow of ideas and associations that can lead to a reality-oriented conclusion.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marić |first=Jovan |date=2005 |title=Klinicka psihijatrija |url=http://www.datastatus.rs/proizvod/8040/klinicka-psihijatrija-11-izdanje |location=Belgrade |publisher=Naša knjiga |page=22 |isbn=9788690155910 |author-link=Jovan Maric}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although thinking is an activity of an existential value for humans, there is no consensus as to how it is defined or understood.

Because thought underlies many human actions and interactions, understanding its physical and metaphysical origins, processes, and effects has been a longstanding goal of many academic disciplines including [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[biology]], [[sociology]] and
[[cognitive science]].

Thinking allows humans to make sense of, interpret, represent or [[Conceptual model|model]] the world they experience, and to make predictions about that world. It is therefore helpful to an organism with needs, objectives, and desires as it makes [[plans]] or otherwise attempts to accomplish those goals.

==Etymology and usage==
[[File:Eugene de Blaas A Pensive Moment.jpg|thumb|right|228px|''A Pensive Moment'' (1904), by [[Eugene de Blaas]]]]

==Philosophy==
{{Main|Phenomenology (philosophy)|Philosophy of mind}}
{{Quotation|What is most thought-provoking in these thought-provoking times, is that we are still not thinking.|[[Martin Heidegger]]&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''What is Called Thinking?''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:ThinkingMan Rodin.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[The Thinker]]'' by [[Rodin]] (1840–1917), in the garden of the [[Musée Rodin]]]]
The phenomenology movement in philosophy saw a radical change in the way in which we understand thought. Martin Heidegger's phenomenological analyses of the existential structure of man in ''[[Being and Time]]'' cast new light on the issue of thinking, unsettling traditional cognitive or rational interpretations of man which affect the way we understand thought. The notion of the fundamental role of non-cognitive understanding in rendering possible thematic consciousness informed the discussion surrounding [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) during the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Dreyfus, Hubert. Dreyfus, Stuart. ''Mind Over Machine''. Macmillan, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Phenomenology, however, is not the only approach to thinking in modern Western philosophy. Philosophy of mind is a branch of [[philosophy]] that studies the nature of the [[mind]], [[mental event]]s, [[mental function]]s, [[mental property|mental properties]], [[consciousness]] and their relationship to the physical body, particularly the brain. The mind–body problem, i.e. the relationship of the mind to the body, is commonly seen as the central issue in philosophy of mind, although there are other issues concerning the nature of the mind that do not involve its relation to the physical body.&lt;ref name="Kim1"/&gt; 

===Mind–body dichotomy===
{{Main|Mind–body problem}}

The mind–body problem concerns the explanation of the relationship that exists between [[mind]]s, or mental processes, and bodily states or processes.&lt;ref name="Kim1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kim |first=J. |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=Problems in the Philosophy of Mind. Oxford Companion to Philosophy |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}}&lt;!--Kim, J., "Problems in the Philosophy of Mind". ''[[Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]''. Ted Honderich (ed.) Oxford:Oxford University Press. 1995.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The main aim of philosophers working in this area is to determine the nature of the mind and mental states/processes, and how—or even if—minds are affected by and can affect the body.

Human perceptual experiences depend on [[stimulation|stimuli]] which arrive at one's various [[sensory system|sensory organs]] from the external world and these stimuli cause changes in one's mental state, ultimately causing one to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain what he or she wants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties. A related problem is to explain how someone's [[propositional attitude]]s (e.g. beliefs and desires) can cause that individual's [[neuron]]s to fire and his muscles to contract in exactly the correct manner. These comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted [[epistemologist]]s and philosophers of mind from at least the time of [[René Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;''Companion to Metaphysics'', By Jaegwon Kim, Gary S. Rosenkrantz, Ernest Sosa, Contributor Jaegwon Kim, 2nd edition, Wiley-Blackwell, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-5298-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Functionalism vs. embodiment===
The above reflects a classical, functional description of how we work as cognitive, thinking systems. However the apparently irresolvable mind–body problem is said to be overcome, and bypassed, by the [[embodied cognition]] approach, with its roots in the work of [[Heidegger]], [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], [[Vygotsky]], [[Merleau-Ponty]] and the pragmatist [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref&gt;Varela, Francisco J., Thompson, Evan T., and Rosch, Eleanor. (1992). ''The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience''. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press. {{ISBN|0-262-72021-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cowart |first=Monica |year=2004 |title=Embodied Cognition |work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |issn= 2161-0002 |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/embodcog/ |accessdate= 27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach states that the classical approach of separating the mind and analysing its processes is misguided: instead, we should see that the mind, actions of an embodied agent, and the environment it perceives and envisions, are all parts of a whole which determine each other. Therefore, functional analysis of the mind alone will always leave us with the mind–body problem which cannot be solved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Di Paolo, Ezequiel|title= Shallow and Deep Embodiment|publisher= University of Sussex|date= 2009  |format=Video, duration: 1:11:38 |url=https://cast.switch.ch/vod/clips/74nrkbwys |accessdate=

==Biology==
{{Main|Neuron}}

A neuron (also known as a neurone or nerve cell) is an excitable [[cell (biology)|cell]] in the [[nervous system]] that processes and transmits information by electrochemical [[signal (biology)|signaling]]. Neurons are the core components of the [[Human brain|brain]], the [[vertebrate]] [[spinal cord]], the [[invertebrate]] [[ventral nerve cord]] and the peripheral nerves. A number of specialized types of neurons exist: sensory neurons respond to touch, sound, light and numerous other stimuli affecting cells of the [[sense|sensory organs]] that then send signals to the spinal cord and brain. Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord that cause [[muscle contraction]]s and affect [[gland]]s. [[Interneuron]]s connect neurons to other neurons within the brain and spinal cord. Neurons respond to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], and communicate the presence of stimuli to the central nervous system, which processes that information and sends responses to other parts of the body for action. Neurons do not go through [[mitosis]] and usually cannot be replaced after being destroyed, although [[astrocytes]] have been observed to turn into neurons, as they are sometimes [[pluripotent]].

{{Main|Cognitive psychology}}

Psychologists have concentrated on thinking as an intellectual exertion aimed at finding an answer to a question or the solution of a practical problem. Cognitive psychology is a branch of [[psychology]] that investigates internal mental processes such as problem solving, memory, and language. The school of thought arising from this approach is known as [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], which is interested in how people mentally represent information processing. It had its foundations in the [[Gestalt psychology]] of [[Max Wertheimer]], [[Wolfgang Köhler]], and [[Kurt Koffka]],&lt;ref&gt;''Gestalt Theory'', By Max Wertheimer. Hayes Barton Press, 1944, {{ISBN|978-1-59377-695-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the work of [[Jean Piaget]], who provided a theory of stages/phases that describes children's cognitive development.

Cognitive psychologists use [[psychophysics|psychophysical]] and experimental approaches to understand, diagnose, and solve problems, concerning themselves with the mental processes which mediate between stimulus and response. They study various aspects of thinking, including the [[psychology of reasoning]], and how people make decisions and choices, solve problems, as well as engage in creative discovery and imaginative thought. Cognitive theory contends that solutions to problems either take the form of [[algorithm]]s: rules that are not necessarily understood but promise a solution, or of [[heuristics]]: rules that are understood but that do not always guarantee solutions. [[Cognitive science]] differs from cognitive psychology in that algorithms that are intended to simulate human behavior are implemented or implementable on a computer. In other instances, solutions may be found through insight, a sudden awareness of relationships.

In [[developmental psychology]], [[Jean Piaget]] was a pioneer in the study of the development of thought from birth to maturity. In his [[theory of cognitive development]], thought is based on actions on the environment. That is, Piaget suggests that the environment is understood through assimilations of objects in the available schemes of action and these accommodate to the objects to the extent that the available schemes fall short of the demands. As a result of this interplay between assimilation and accommodation, thought develops through a sequence of stages that differ qualitatively from each other in mode of representation and complexity of inference and understanding. That is, thought evolves from being based on perceptions and actions at the sensorimotor stage in the first two years of life to internal representations in early childhood. Subsequently, representations are gradually organized into logical structures which first operate on the concrete properties of the reality, in the stage of concrete operations, and then operate on abstract principles that organize concrete properties, in the stage of formal operations.&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, J. (1951). ''Psychology of Intelligence''. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the Piagetian conception of thought was integrated with information processing conceptions. Thus, thought is considered as the result of mechanisms that are responsible for the representation and processing of information. In this conception, [[speed of processing]], [[cognitive control]], and [[working memory]] are the main functions underlying thought. In the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]], the development of thought is considered to come from increasing speed of processing, enhanced [[cognitive control]], and increasing working memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Demetriou |first=A. |year=1998 |title=Cognitive development. In A. Demetriou, W. Doise, K. F. M. van Lieshout (Eds.), ''Life-span developmental psychology''. pp. 179–269. London: Wiley }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Positive psychology]] emphasizes the positive aspects of human psychology as equally important as the focus on mood disorders and other negative symptoms. In ''[[Character Strengths and Virtues]]'', [[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Peterson]] and [[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] list a series of positive characteristics. One person is not expected to have every strength, nor are they meant to fully capsulate that characteristic entirely. The list encourages positive thought that builds on a person's strengths, rather than how to "fix" their "symptoms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schacter |first=Daniel L. |year=2011 |title =Psychology Second Edition, "Positive Psychology" |location= New York}} 584 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalysis==

The "id", "ego" and "super-ego" are the three parts of the "[[psychic apparatus]]" defined in [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[ego psychology|structural model]] of the psyche; they are the three theoretical constructs in terms of whose activity and interaction mental life is described. According to this model, the uncoordinated instinctual trends are encompassed by the "id", the organized realistic part of the psyche is the "ego", and the critical, moralizing function is the "super-ego".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Teach Yourself Freud |first= Ruth |last=Snowden |edition= illustrated |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2006 |isbn= 978-0-07-147274-6 |page=107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] was considered by Freud throughout the evolution of his [[psychoanalytic]] theory to be a [[sentient]] force of [[Will (philosophy)|will]] influenced by human desire and yet operating well below the perceptual [[conscious mind]]. For Freud, the unconscious is the storehouse of instinctual desires, needs and psychic drives. While past thoughts and reminiscences may be concealed from immediate consciousness, they direct the thoughts and feelings of the individual from the realm of the unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Geraskov |first=Emil Asenov |title=The internal contradiction and the unconscious sources of activity |website=The Journal of Psychology |date=November 1, 1994 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16528826.html |accessdate=April 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For psychoanalysis, the unconscious does not include all that is not conscious, rather only what is actively repressed from conscious thought or what the person is averse to knowing consciously. In a sense this view places the self in relationship to their unconscious as an adversary, warring with itself to keep what is unconscious hidden. If a person feels pain, all he can think of is alleviating the pain. Any of his desires, to get rid of pain or enjoy something, command the mind what to do. For Freud, the unconscious was a repository for socially unacceptable ideas, wishes or desires, traumatic memories, and painful emotions put out of mind by the mechanism of [[psychological repression]]. However, the contents did not necessarily have to be solely negative. In the psychoanalytic view, the unconscious is a force that can only be recognized by its effects—it expresses itself in the [[symptom]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge companion to Freud'', By Jerome Neu. Cambridge University Press, 1991, p. 29, {{ISBN|9780521377799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology==
[[File:Thought bubble.svg|thumb|A "[[thought bubble]]" is an illustration depicting thought.]]
{{Main|Social psychology}}

Social psychology is the study of how people and groups interact. Scholars in this [[interdisciplinary]] area are typically either [[psychology|psychologists]] or [[sociologists]], though all social psychologists employ both the [[individual]] and the [[group (sociology)|group]] as their [[unit of analysis|units of analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hrydA45eCk0C&amp;q=social+psychology&amp;dq=social+psychology&amp;pgis=1 ''Social Psychology''], David G. Myers, McGraw Hill, 1993. {{ISBN|0-07-044292-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their similarity, psychological and sociological researchers tend to differ in their goals, approaches, methods, and terminology. They also favor separate [[academic journals]] and [[learned society|professional societies]]. The greatest period of collaboration between sociologists and psychologists was during the years immediately following [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Sewell, W.H. (1989). Some reflections on the golden age of interdisciplinary social psychology. ''Annual Review of Sociology'', Vol. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there has been increasing isolation and specialization in recent years, some degree of overlap and influence remains between the two disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvz5Y8e1N84C ''The Psychology of the Social''], Uwe Flick, Cambridge University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-521-58851-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[collective unconscious]], sometimes known as collective subconscious, is a term of [[analytical psychology]], [[Neologism|coined]] by [[Carl Jung]]. It is a part of the [[unconscious mind]], shared by a [[society]], a people, or all [[human]]ity, in an interconnected system that is the product of all common experiences and contains such concepts as [[science]], [[religion]], and [[morality]]. While [[Freud]] did not distinguish between an "individual psychology" and a "collective psychology", Jung distinguished the collective unconscious from the [[personal unconscious|personal]] [[unconscious mind|subconscious]] particular to each human being. The collective unconscious is also known as "a reservoir of the experiences of our species".&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Peter S., Mrazek, David, Knapp, Penelope K., [[Laurence Steinberg|Steinberg, Laurence]], Pfeffer, Cynthia, Schowalter, John, &amp; Shapiro, Theodore. (Dec 1997) "Evolution and revolution in child psychiatry: ADHD as a disorder of adaptation. (attention-deficit hyperactivity syndrome)". ''Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry''. 36. p. 1672. (10). July 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "Definitions" chapter of Jung's [[wikt:seminal|seminal]] work ''Psychological Types'', under the definition of "collective" Jung references ''representations collectives'', a term coined by [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]] in his 1910 book ''How Natives Think''. Jung says this is what he describes as the collective unconscious. Freud, on the other hand, did not accept the idea of a collective unconscious.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14004">'''Tomasulo’s algorithm''' is a [[computer architecture]] hardware [[algorithm]] for dynamic scheduling of instructions that allows [[out-of-order execution]] and enables more efficient use of multiple execution units. It was developed by [[Robert Tomasulo]] at [[IBM]] in 1967 and was first implemented in the [[IBM System/360 Model 91]]’s [[floating point unit]].

The major innovations of Tomasulo’s algorithm include [[register renaming]] in hardware, [[reservation station|reservation stations]] for all execution units, and a common data bus (CDB) on which computed values broadcast to all reservation stations that may need them. These developments allow for improved [[parallel computing|parallel execution]] of instructions that would otherwise stall under the use of [[scoreboarding]] or other earlier algorithms.

[[Robert Tomasulo]] received the [[Eckert–Mauchly Award]] in 1997 for his work on the algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Implementation concepts==
[[File:Tomasulo Architecture.png|thumb|right|700px|Tomasulo's floating point unit]]
The following are the concepts necessary to the implementation of Tomasulo's Algorithm:

===Common data bus===
The Common Data Bus (CDB) connects reservation stations directly to functional units. According to Tomasulo it "preserves precedence while encouraging concurrency".&lt;ref name="tomasulo"&gt;
 {{cite journal
 | last1 = Tomasulo | first1 = Robert Marco
 | author1-link = Robert Marco Tomasulo
 | title = An Efficient Algorithm for Exploiting Multiple Arithmetic Units 
 | journal = IBM Journal of Research and Development
 | volume = 11
 | issue = 1
 | pages = 25–33
 | publisher = IBM
 | date = Jan 1967
 | issn = 0018-8646
 | doi = 10.1147/rd.111.0025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}} This has two important effects:
#Functional units can access the result of any operation without involving a floating-point-register, allowing multiple units waiting on a result to proceed without waiting to resolve contention for access to register file read ports. 
#Hazard Detection and control execution are distributed. The reservation stations control when an instruction can execute, rather than a single dedicated hazard unit.

===Instruction order===
Instructions are issued sequentially so that the effects of a sequence of instructions, such as [[exception (computing)|exception]]s raised by these instructions, occur in the same order as they would on an in-order processor, regardless of the fact that they are being executed out-of-order (i.e. non-sequentially). 

===Register renaming===
Tomasulo's Algorithm uses [[register renaming]] to correctly perform out-of-order execution. All general-purpose and reservation station registers hold either a real value or a placeholder value. If a real value is unavailable to a destination register during the issue stage, a placeholder value is initially used. The placeholder value is a tag indicating which reservation station will produce the real value. When the unit finishes and broadcasts the result on the CDB, the placeholder will be replaced with the real value.

Each functional unit has a single reservation station. Reservation stations hold information needed to execute a single instruction, including the operation and the operands. The functional unit begins processing when it is free and when all source operands needed for an instruction are real.

===Exceptions===
Practically speaking, there may be exceptions for which not enough status information about an exception is available, in which case the processor may raise a special exception, called an "imprecise" exception. Imprecise exceptions cannot occur in non-[[Out-of-order execution|OoOE]] implementations, as processor state is changed only in program order (see [[Classic_RISC_pipeline#Exceptions|RISC Pipeline Exceptions]]).

Programs that experience "precise" exceptions, where the specific instruction that took the exception can be determined, can restart or re-execute at the point of the exception. However, those that experience "imprecise" exceptions generally cannot restart or re-execute, as the system cannot determine the specific instruction that took the exception.

==Instruction lifecycle==
The three stages listed below are the stages through which each instruction passes from the time it is issued to the time its execution is complete.

===Register legend===

*Op - represents the operation being performed on operands
*Qj, Qk - the reservation station that will produce the relevant source operand (0 indicates the value is in Vj, Vk)
*Vj, Vk - the value of the source operands
*A - used to hold the memory address information for a load or store
*Busy - 1 if occupied, 0 if not occupied
*Qi - (Only register unit) the reservation station whose result should be stored in this register (if blank or 0, no values are destined for this register)

===Stage 1: issue===
In the issue stage, instructions are issued for execution if all operands and reservation stations are ready or else they are stalled. Registers are renamed in this step, eliminating WAR and WAW hazards.

*Retrieve the next instruction from the head of the instruction queue. If the instruction operands are currently in the registers, then
**If a matching functional unit is available, issue the instruction.
**Else, as there is no available functional unit, stall the instruction until a station or buffer is free.
*Otherwise, we can assume the operands are not in the registers, and so use virtual values. The functional unit must calculate the real value to keep track of the functional units that produce the operand.

===Stage 2: execute===

In the execute stage, the instruction operations are carried out. Instructions are delayed in this step until all of their operands are available, eliminating RAW hazards. Program correctness is maintained through effective address calculation to prevent hazards through memory.

*If one or more of the operands is not yet available then: wait for operand to become available on the CDB.
*When all operands are available, then: if the instruction is a load or store
**Compute the effective address when the base register is available, and place it in the load/store buffer
***If the instruction is a load then: execute as soon as the memory unit is available
***Else, if the instruction is a store then: wait for the value to be stored before sending it to the memory unit
*Else, the instruction is an [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU) operation then: execute the instruction at the corresponding functional unit

===Stage 3: write result===
In the write Result stage, ALU operations results are written back to registers and store operations are written back to memory.
* If the instruction was an ALU operation
** If the result is available, then: write it on the CDB and from there into the registers and any reservation stations waiting for this result
* Else, if the instruction was a store then: write the data to memory during this step

&lt;/source&gt;
|}

==Algorithm improvements==
The concepts of reservation stations, register renaming, and the common data bus in Tomasulo's algorithm presents significant advancements in the design of high-performance computers.

Reservation stations take on the responsibility of waiting for operands in the presence of data dependencies and other inconsistencies such as varying storage access time and circuit speeds, thus freeing up the functional units. This improvement overcomes long floating point delays and memory accesses. In particular the algorithm is more tolerant of cache misses. Additionally, programmers are freed from implementing optimized code. This is a result of the common data bus and reservation station working together to preserve dependencies as well as encouraging concurrency.&lt;ref name="tomasulo"/&gt;{{rp|33}}

By tracking operands for instructions in the reservation stations and register renaming in hardware the algorithm minimizes [[Read after write (Hazard)|read-after-write]] (RAW) and eliminates [[Write after write (hazard)#Write_after_write_.28WAW.29|write-after-write]] (WAW) and [[Write after read (hazard)#Write_after_read_.28WAR.29|Write-after-Read]] (WAR) [[computer architecture]] [[hazard (computer architecture)|hazard]]s. This improves performance by reducing wasted time that would otherwise be required for stalls.&lt;ref name="tomasulo"/&gt;{{rp|33}}

An equally important improvement in the algorithm is the design is not limited to a specific pipeline structure. This improvement allows the algorithm to be more widely adopted by multiple-issue processors. Additionally, the algorithm is easily extended to enable branch speculation.&lt;ref name="hennessy" /&gt; {{rp|182}}

== Applications and legacy ==
Tomasulo's algorithm, outside of IBM, was unused for several years after its implementation in the System/360 Model 91 architecture. However, it saw a vast increase in usage during the 1990s for 3 reasons:
# Once caches became commonplace, the Tomasulo algorithm's ability to maintain concurrency during unpredictable load times caused by cache misses became valuable in processors.
# Dynamic scheduling and the branch speculation that the algorithm enables helped performance as processors issued more and more instructions.
# Proliferation of mass-market software meant that programmers would not want to compile for a specific pipeline structure. The algorithm can function with any pipeline architecture and thus software requires few architecture-specific modifications.&lt;ref name="hennessy" /&gt; {{rp|183}}

Many modern processors implement dynamic scheduling schemes that are derivative of Tomasulo’s original algorithm, including popular [[Intel]] [[x86-64]] chips.&lt;ref name="intel" &gt;{{Cite report

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8594">A '''Warnier/Orr diagram''' (also known as a logical construction of a program/system) is a kind of [[hierarchical]] [[flowchart]] that allows the description of the organization of data and procedures. They were initially developed in [[France]] by [[Jean-Dominique Warnier]] and in the [[United States]] by [[Kenneth Orr]]. This method aids the design of program structures by identifying the output and processing results and then working backwards to determine the steps and combinations of input needed to produce them. The simple graphic method used in Warnier/Orr diagrams makes the levels in the system evident and the movement of the [[data]] between them vivid.

==Basic Elements==

Warnier/Orr diagrams show the processes and sequences in which they are performed. Each process is defined in a hierarchical manner i.e. it consists of sets of subprocesses, that define it. At each level, the process is shown in bracket that groups its components.

Since a process can have many different subprocesses, Warnier/Orr diagram uses a set of brackets to show each level of the system. Critical factors in s/w definition and development are iteration or repetition and alternation. Warnier/Orr diagrams show this very well.{{cn|date=November 2014}}

==Using Warnier/Orr diagrams==
To develop a Warnier/Orr diagram, the analyst works backwards, starting with systems output and using output oriented analysis. On paper, the development moves from the set to the element (from left to right) . First, the intended output or results of the processing are defined. At the next level, shown by inclusion with a bracket, the steps needed to produce the output are defined. Each step in turn is further defined. Additional brackets group the processes required to produce the result on the next level.

Warnier/Orr diagrams offer some distinct advantages to systems experts. They are simple in appearance and easy to understand. Yet they are powerful design tools. They have advantage of showing groupings of processes and the data that must be passed from level to level. In addition, the sequence of working backwards ensures that the system will be result oriented. This method is useful for both data and process definition. It can be used for each independently, or both can be combined on the same diagram.

==Constructs in Warnier/Orr diagrams==
There are four basic constructs used on Warnier/Orr diagrams: hierarchy, sequence, repetition, and alternation. There are also two slightly more advanced concepts that are occasionally needed: concurrency and recursion.

===Hierarchy===
Hierarchy is the most fundamental of all of the Warnier/Orr constructs. It is simply a nested group of sets and subsets shown as a set of nested brackets. Each bracket on the diagram (depending on how you represent it, the character is usually more like a brace "{" than a bracket "[", but we call them "brackets") represents one level of hierarchy. The hierarchy or structure that is represented on the diagram can show the organization of data or processing. However, both data and processing are never shown on the same diagram.

===Sequence===
Sequence is the simplest structure to show on a Warnier/Orr diagram. Within one level of hierarchy, the features listed are shown in the order in which they occur. In other words, the step listed first is the first that will be executed (if the diagram reflects a process), while the step listed last is the last that will be executed. Similarly with data, the data field listed first is the first that is encountered when looking at the data, the data field listed last is the final one encountered.

===Repetition===
Repetition is the representation of a classic "loop" in programming terms. It occurs whenever the same set of data occurs over and over again (for a data structure) or whenever the same group of actions is to occur over and over again (for a processing structure). Repetition is indicated by placing a set of numbers inside parentheses beneath the repeating set.

Typically there are two numbers listed in the parentheses, representing the fewest and the most number of times the set will repeat. By convention the first letter of the repeating set is the letter chosen to represent the maximum.

While the minimum bound and maximum bound can technically be anything, they are most often either "(1,n)" as in the example, or "(0,n)." When used to depict processing, the "(1,n)" repetition is classically known as a "DoUntil" loop, while the "(0,n)" repetition is called a "DoWhile" loop. On the Warnier/Orr diagram, however, there is no distinction between the two different types of repetition, other than the minimum bound value.

On occasion, the minimum and maximum bound are predefined and not likely to change: for instance the set "Day" occurs within the set "Month" from 28 to 31 times (since the smallest month has 28 days, the largest months, 31). This is not likely to change. And on occasion, the minimum and maximum are fixed at the same number.

In general, though, it is a bad idea to "[[hard code]]" a constant other than "0" or "1" in a number of times clause—the design should be flexible enough to allow for changes in the number of times without changes to the design. For instance, if a company has 38 employees at the time a design is done, hard coding a "38" as the "number of employees" within company would certainly not be as flexible as designing "(1,n)".

The number of times clause is always an operator attached to some set (i.e., the name of some bracket), and is never attached to an element (a diagram feature which does not decompose into smaller features). The reason for this will become more apparent as we continue to work with the diagrams. For now, you will have to accept this as a formation rule for a correct diagram.

===Alternation===
Alternation, or selection, is the traditional "decision" process whereby a determination is made to execute one process or another. The Exclusive OR symbol (the plus sign inside the circle) indicates that the sets immediately above and below it are mutually exclusive (if one is present the other is not). This diagram indicates that an Employee is either Management or Non-Management, one Employee cannot be both. It is also permissible to use a "negation bar" above an alternative in a manner similar to engineering notation. The bar is read by simply using the word "not".

Alternatives do not have to be binary as in the previous examples, but may be many-way alternatives.

===Concurrency===
Concurrency is one of the two advanced constructs used in the methodology. It is used whenever sequence is unimportant. For instance, years and weeks operate concurrently (or at the same time) within our calendar. The concurrency operator is rarely used in program design (since most languages do not support true concurrent processing anyway), but does come into play when resolving logical and physical data structure clashes.

===Recursion===
Recursion is the least used of the constructs. It is used to indicate that a set contains an earlier or a less ordered version of itself. In the classic "bill of materials" problem components contain parts and other sub-components. Sub-components also contain sub-sub-components, and so on. The doubled bracket indicates that the set is recursive. Data structures that are truly recursive are rather rare.
