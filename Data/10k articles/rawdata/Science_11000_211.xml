The '''meridian 3° east of [[Prime Meridian|Greenwich]]''' is a line of [[longitude]] that extends from the [[North Pole]] across the [[Arctic Ocean]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Europe]], [[Africa]], the [[Southern Ocean]], and [[Antarctica]] to the [[South Pole]].

The 3rd meridian east forms a [[great circle]] with the [[177th meridian west]].

==From Pole to Pole==
Starting at the [[North Pole]] and heading south to the [[South Pole]], the 3rd meridian east passes through:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1243">'''Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay (AMDAR)''' is a program initiated by the [[World Meteorological Organization]]. 
AMDAR is used to collect meteorological data worldwide by using commercial [[aircraft]].

Data is collected by the aircraft navigation systems and the onboard standard [[temperature]] and [[static pressure]] probes.
The data is then preprocessed before linking them down to the ground either via [[VHF]] communication ([[ACARS]])
or via [[satellite]] link [[ASDAR]].

A detailed description is given in the AMDAR Reference Manual (WMO-No 958) available from the [[World Meteorological Organization]], 
[[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].

== Usage ==
AMDAR transmissions are most commonly used in [[numerical weather prediction|forecast models]] as a supplement to [[radiosonde]] data, to aid in the plotting of upper-air data between the standard radiosonde soundings at 00Z and 12Z.

An '''anchialine pool''' or '''pond''' (pronounced "AN-key-ah-lin", from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''ankhialos'', "near the sea") is a landlocked body of water with a subterranean connection to the [[ocean]]. Anchialine pools are a feature of coastal [[aquifer]]s which are density stratified, with the water near the surface being fresh or [[Brackish water|brackish]], and saline water intruding from the coast below at some depth.  Depending on the site, it is sometimes possible to access the deeper saline water directly in the anchialine pool or sometimes it may be accessible by [[cave diving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bozanic, JE |title=Preliminary investigations in anchialine caves of Cuba |journal=In: Heine and Crane (eds). Diving for Science...1993. |volume=Proceedings of the American Academy of Underwater Sciences |issue=13th annual Scientific Diving Symposium |year=1993 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6319 |accessdate=2008-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water levels in anchialine pools often fluctuate with [[Tide|tidal]] changes due to the coastal location and the connection with the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{sp}} [http://www.magrama.gob.es/imagenes/en/0904712280152fdb_tcm11-18373.pdf ''Especies marinas incluidas en el catálogo Español''], in ''magrama.gob.es''.&lt;/ref&gt; The range in water levels fluctuations will be decreased (damped) and delayed compared to the range and time observed for the adjacent tide. The primary controls on the damping and lag are the distance from the coast, and the [[hydraulic conductivity]] of the geological materials.

Anchialine pools are extremely common worldwide especially along neo-tropical coastlines where the geology and aquifer system are relatively young, and there is minimal soil development. Such conditions occur notably where the [[bedrock]] is [[limestone]] or recently formed volcanic [[lava]]. Many anchialine pools are found on the coastlines of the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawaii]], and on the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], where they are locally called [[cenote]]s, as well as [[Christmas Island]].&lt;ref name=IliffeADM2016&gt;{{cite journal |author=Iliffe T, Humphreys W |title=Christmas Islands Hidden Secret |year=2016 |journal=Advanced Diver Magazine |url=http://www.advanceddivermagazine.com/articles/christmasisland.html |accessdate=2016-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Operation Sailor Hat|Sailor's Hat]] crater created by an explosives test in 1965 is an anchialine pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Bailey-Brock|first2=Julie H.|year=1998|title=An Unique Anchialine Pool in the Hawaiian Islands|journal=International Review of Hydrobiology|volume=83|pages=65|doi=10.1002/iroh.19980830107|last1=Brock|first1=Richard E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecological studies of anchialine pools frequently identify regionally rare and sometimes [[Endemism|endemic]] species. In Hawaii, the pools are home to the ʻōpaeʻula (Hawaiian shrimp, ''[[Halocaridina rubra]]''). In [[karst]] anchialine pools and the caves these may be connected to, the fauna are diverse and include [[crustacean]]s, including [[remipedia]] and [[copepod]]s, and among the vertebrates are several species of blind [[cave fish]].&lt;ref&gt;Romero, A., editor (2001).

'''Arago''' is a small impact crater in the [[Arabia quadrangle]] on Mars at 10.22 N and 29.93° E. and is 152&amp;nbsp;km in diameter and is in the northernmost of [[Terra Sabaea]]. Its name was approved in 1973 and is named after the French astronomer [[François Arago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature {{!}} Arago|url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/338|website=usgs.gov|publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]]|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the crater is flat.

Nearby named prominent craters include [[Cassini (Martian crater)|Cassini]] to the north, the large [[Tikhonravov (crater)|Tikhonravov]] to the east, [[Janssen (Martian crater)|Janssen]] to the southeast, Tuscaloosa to the south, [[Henry (Martian crater)|Henry]] to the west and [[Pasteur (Martian crater)|Pasteur]] to the north-northwest.

Just south of the crater rim is [[Naktong Vallis]] and north of the crater is [[Scamander Vallis]].

{{Close Relationships|emotions}}
In [[psychology]], the [[theory of attachment]] can be applied to adult relationships including friendships, emotional affairs, adult romantic or platonic relationships and in some cases relationships with inanimate objects ("[[transitional objects]]").&lt;ref name= "Hooley JM, Wilson-Murphy M"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hooley JM.|author2=Wilson-Murphy M.|title=Adult attachment to transitional objects and borderline personality disorder|pmid=22486448|doi=10.1521/pedi.2012.26.2.179|volume=26|journal=J Pers Disord|pages=179-91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment theory, initially studied in the 1960s and 1970s primarily in the context of children and parents, was extended to adult relationships in the late 1980s.

Four main styles of attachment have been identified in adults:
*secure
*anxious-preoccupied
*dismissive-avoidant
*fearful-avoidant

Investigators have explored the organization and the stability of mental ''working models'' that underlie these attachment styles. They have also explored how attachment impacts relationship outcomes and how attachment functions in relationship dynamics.

==Extending attachment theory==
[[Mary Ainsworth]] and [[John Bowlby]] founded modern attachment theory on studies of children and their caregivers. Children and caregivers remained the primary focus of attachment theory for many years. Then, in the late 1980s, Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver applied attachment theory to adult relationships.&lt;ref name="Hazan Shaver 87"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hazan C. |author2=Shaver P.R. |title=Romantic love conceptualized as an attachment process |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=511–24 |date=March 1987 |pmid=3572722 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.3.511 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/52/3/511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazan Shaver 90"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hazan | first1 = C. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | year = 1990 | title = Love and work: An attachment theoretical perspective | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 270–280 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazan Shaver 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hazan | first1 = C. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | year = 1994 | title = Attachment as an organizational framework for research on close relationships | url = | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 1–22 | doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0501_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazan and Shaver noticed that interactions between adults shared similarities to interactions between children and caregivers. For example, romantic or platonic partners desire to be close to one another. Adults feel comforted when their attachments are present and anxious or lonely when they are absent. Romantic relationships, for example, serve as a secure base that help people face the surprises, opportunities, and challenges life presents. Similarities such as these led Hazan and Shaver to extend attachment theory to adult relationships.

Relationships between adults differ in many ways from relationships between children and caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://internal.psychology.illinois.edu/~rcfraley/attachment.htm|title=A Brief Overview of Adult Attachment Theory and Research {{!}} R. Chris Fraley|website=internal.psychology.illinois.edu|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim is not that these two kinds of relationships are identical. The claim is that the core principles of attachment theory apply to both kinds of relationships.

Investigators tend to describe the core principles of attachment theory in light of their own theoretical interests. Their descriptions seem quite different on a superficial level. For example, Fraley and Shaver&lt;ref name="Fraley Shaver 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fraley | first1 = R.C. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | year = 2000 | title = Adult attachment: Theoretical developments, emerging controversies, and unanswered questions | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 132–154 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.4.2.132}}&lt;/ref&gt; describe the "central propositions" of attachment in adults as follows:
* The emotional and behavioral dynamics of infant–caregiver relationships and adult relationships are governed by the same biological system.
* The kinds of individual differences observed in infant–caregiver relationships are similar to the ones observed in various close adult relationships.
* Individual differences in adult attachment behavior are reflections of the expectations and beliefs people have formed about themselves and their close relationships on the basis of their attachment histories; these "working models" are relatively stable and, as such, may be reflections of early caregiving experiences.
* Romantic love, as commonly conceived, involves the interplay of attachment, caregiving and intimacy.

Compare this with the five "core propositions" of attachment theory listed by Rholes and Simpson:&lt;ref name="Rholes Simpson 04"&gt;Rholes, W.S. &amp; Simpson, J.A. (2004). Attachment theory: Basic concepts and contemporary questions. In W.S. Rholes and J.A. Simpson (Eds.), ''Adult Attachment: Theory, Research, and Clinical Implications'', pp. 3–14. New York, NY: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although the basic impetus for the formation of attachment relationships is provided by biological factors, the bonds that children form with their caregivers are shaped by interpersonal experience.
* Experiences in earlier relationships create internal working models and attachment styles that systematically affect attachment relationships.
* The attachment orientations of adult caregivers influence the attachment bond their children have with them.
* Working models and attachment orientations are relatively stable over time, but they are not impervious to change.
* Some forms of psychological maladjustment and clinical disorders are attributable in part to the effects of insecure working models and attachment styles.

While these two lists clearly reflect the theoretical interests of the investigators who created them, a closer look reveals a number of shared themes. The shared themes claim that:
* People are biologically driven to form attachments with others, but the process of forming attachments is influenced by learning experiences.
* Individuals form different kinds of attachments depending on the expectations and beliefs they have about their relationships. These expectations and beliefs constitute internal "working models" used to guide relationship behaviors.
* Internal "working models" are relatively stable even though they can be influenced by experience.
* Individual differences in attachment can contribute positively or negatively to mental health and to the quality of relationships with others.

No doubt these themes could be described in a variety of ways (and other themes added to the list). Regardless of how one describes the core principles of attachment theory, the key insight is that the same principles of attachment apply to close relationships throughout the lifespan. The principles of attachment between children and caregivers are fundamentally the same as the principles of attachment between adults.

==Styles==
Adults are described as having 4 attachment styles: Secure, Anxious-preoccupied, Dismissive-avoidant, and Fearful-avoidant.

The secure attachment style in adults corresponds to the secure attachment style in children. The anxious–preoccupied attachment style in adults corresponds to the anxious-ambivalent attachment style in children. However, the dismissive-avoidant attachment style and the fearful-avoidant attachment style, which are distinct in adults, correspond to a single avoidant attachment style in children. The descriptions of adult attachment styles offered below are based on the relationship questionnaire devised by Bartholomew and Horowitz&lt;ref name="Bartholomew Horowitz 91"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bartholomew K, Horowitz LM |title=Attachment styles among young adults: a test of a four-category model |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=226–44 |date=August 1991 |pmid=1920064 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.2.226 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/61/2/226}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on a review of studies by Pietromonaco and Barrett.&lt;ref name="Pietromonaco Barrett 97"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pietromonaco PR, Barrett LF |title=Working models of attachment and daily social interactions |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=1409–23 |date=December 1997 |pmid=9418285 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.73.6.1409 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/73/6/1409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several attachment-based treatment approaches that can be used with adults.&lt;ref name="Sable 00"&gt;Sable, P., (2000). Attachment &amp; Adult Psychotherapy. Northvale NJ: Aaronson.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there is an approach to treating couples based on [[attachment theory]].&lt;ref name="Johnson 02"&gt;Johnson, S., (2002). Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy with Trauma Survivors. NY: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secure===
Securely attached people tend to agree with the following statements: "It is relatively easy for me to become emotionally close to others. I am comfortable depending on others and having others depend on me. I don't worry about being alone or others not accepting me." This style of attachment usually results from a history of warm and responsive interactions with their attachments. Securely attached people tend to have positive views of themselves and their attachments. They also tend to have positive views of their relationships. Often they report greater satisfaction and adjustment in their relationships than people with other attachment styles. Securely attached people feel comfortable both with intimacy and with independence. 

Secure attachment and adaptive functioning are promoted by a caregiver who is emotionally available and appropriately responsive to his or her child's attachment behavior, as well as capable of regulating both his or her positive and negative emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sable|first=Pat|title=What is Adult Attachment?|journal=Clin Soc Work J|date=2008|volume=36 |pages=21–30 |doi=10.1007/s10615-007-0110-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insecure===

==== Anxious-preoccupied ====
People with anxious-preoccupied attachment type tend to agree with the following statements: "I want to be completely emotionally intimate with others, but I often find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like", and "I am uncomfortable being without close relationships, but I sometimes worry that others don't value me as much as I value them." People with this style of attachment seek high levels of [[intimacy]], approval, and responsiveness from their attachment figure. They sometimes value intimacy to such an extent that they become overly dependent on the attachment figure. Compared with securely attached people, people who are anxious or preoccupied with attachment tend to have less positive views about themselves. They may feel a sense of anxiousness that only recedes when in contact with the attachment figure. They often [[doubt]] their worth as a person and blame themselves for the attachment figure's lack of responsiveness. People who are anxious or preoccupied with attachment may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, [[emotional dysregulation]], worry, and [[impulsiveness]] in their relationships.

==== Dismissive-avoidant ====
People with a dismissive style of avoidant attachment tend to agree with these statements: "I am comfortable without close emotional relationships", "It is  important to me to feel independent and self-sufficient", and "I prefer not to depend on others or have others depend on me." People with this attachment style desire a high level of independence. The desire for independence often appears as an attempt to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient and invulnerable to feelings associated with being closely attached to others. They often deny needing close relationships. Some may even view close relationships as relatively unimportant. Not surprisingly, they seek less intimacy with attachments, whom they often view less positively than they view themselves. Investigators commonly note the [[Defense mechanism|defensive]] character of this attachment style. People with a dismissive-avoidant attachment style tend to suppress and hide their feelings, and they tend to deal with [[Social rejection|rejection]] by distancing themselves from the sources of rejection (e.g. their attachments or relationships).

==== Fearful-avoidant ====
People with losses or other trauma, such as sexual abuse in childhood and adolescence may often develop this type of attachment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contextualizing the effects of childhood sexual abuse on adult self- and social functioning: an attachment theory perspective|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145213499000812 | doi=10.1016/S0145-2134(99)00081-2 | volume=23|journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect|pages=1141–1157}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tend to agree with the following statements: "I am somewhat uncomfortable getting close to others. I want emotionally close relationships, but I find it difficult to trust others completely, or to depend on them. I sometimes worry that I will be hurt if I allow myself to become too close to other people."
They tend to feel uncomfortable with emotional closeness, and the mixed feelings are combined with sometimes unconscious, negative views about themselves and their attachments. They commonly view themselves as unworthy of responsiveness from their attachments, and they don't trust the intentions of their attachments. Similar to the dismissive-avoidant attachment style, people with a fearful-avoidant attachment style seek less intimacy from attachments and frequently suppress and deny their feelings. Because of this, they are much less comfortable expressing affection.

==Working models==
Bowlby observed that children learn from their interactions with caregivers. Over the course of many interactions, children form expectations about the accessibility and helpfulness of their caregivers. These expectations reflect children's thoughts about themselves and about their caregivers:
{{quote|Confidence that an attachment figure is, apart from being accessible, likely to be responsive can be seen to turn on at least two variables: (a) whether or not the attachment figure is judged to be the sort of person who in general responds to calls for support and protection; (b) whether or not the self is judged to be the sort of person towards whom anyone, and the attachment figure in particular, is likely to respond in a helpful way. Logically, these variables are independent. In practice they are apt to be confounded. As a result, the model of the attachment figure and the model of the self are likely to develop so as to be complementary and mutually confirming. (Bowlby, 1973, p. 238)&lt;ref name="Bowlby 73"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1973). Separation: Anxiety &amp; Anger, Volume 2 of Attachment and loss London. Hogarth Press; New York: Basic Books; Harmondsworth: Penguin (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Children's thoughts about their caregivers, together with thoughts about how deserving they are themselves of good care from their caregivers, form ''working models'' of attachment. Working models help guide behavior by allowing children to anticipate and plan for caregiver responses. Bowlby theorized that once formed,  working models remain relatively stable. Children usually interpret experiences in the light of their working models, rather than change their working models to fit new experiences. However, when experiences cannot be interpreted in the light of their working models children may then modify their working models.

When Hazen and Shaver extended attachment theory to romantic relationships in adults, they also included the idea of working models. Research into adult working models has focused on two issues. First, how are the thoughts that form working models organized in the mind? Second, how stable are working models across time? These questions are briefly discussed below.

===Organization of working models===
Bartholomew and Horowitz have proposed that working models consist of two parts.&lt;ref name="Bartholomew Horowitz 91"/&gt; One part deals with thoughts about the self. The other part deals with thoughts about others. They further propose that a person's thoughts about self are generally positive or generally negative. The same applies to a person's thoughts about others. In order to test these proposals, Bartholomew and Horowitz have looked at the relationship between attachment styles, self-esteem, and sociability. The diagram below shows the relationships they observed:
&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable" align="center"
|+ Security-based strategy of affect regulation
! colspan=2 rowspan=2 style="background: none;" |
! colspan=2 | Self-esteem&lt;br&gt;(thoughts about self)

! Positive
| Secure
| Anxious-preoccupied
|-
! Negative
| Dismissive-avoidant
| Fearful-avoidant
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The secure and dismissive attachment styles are associated with higher self-esteem compared with the anxious and fearful attachment styles. This corresponds to the distinction between positive and negative thoughts about the self in working models. The secure and anxious attachment styles are associated with higher sociability than the dismissive or fearful attachment styles. This corresponds to the distinction between positive and negative thoughts about others in working models. These results suggested working models indeed contain two distinct domains—thoughts about self and thoughts about others—and that each domain can be characterized as generally positive or generally negative.

Baldwin and colleagues have applied the theory of relational schemas to working models of attachment. Relational schemas contain information about the way the attachment figure regularly interact with each other.&lt;ref name= "Baldwin 92"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | year = 1992 | title = Relational schemas and the processing of social information | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 112 | issue = | pages = 461–484 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.112.3.461}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baldwin 97"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | year = 1997 | title = Relational schemas as a source of if-then self-inference procedures | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 326–335 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.1.4.326}}&lt;/ref&gt; For each pattern of interaction that regularly occurs between partners, a relational schema is formed that contains:
* information about the self
* information about the attachment
* information about the way the interaction usually unfolds.

For example, if a person regularly asks his or her partner for a hug or kiss, and the partner regularly responds with a hug or kiss, the person forms a relational schema representing the predictable interaction. The schema contains information about the self (e.g., "I need lots of physical affection"). It also contains information about the partner (e.g., "My partner is an affectionate person"). And it contains information about the way the interaction usually unfolds, which can be summarized by an if–then statement (e.g., "''If'' I ask my partner for a hug or kiss, ''then'' my partner will respond with a hug or kiss and comfort me"). Relational schemas help guide behavior in relationships by allowing people to anticipate and plan for partner responses.

Baldwin and colleagues have proposed that working models of attachment are composed of relational schemas. The fact that relational schemas contain information about the self and information about others is consistent with previous conceptions of working models. The unique contribution of relational schemas to working models is the information about the way interactions with attachments usually unfold. Relational schemas add the if–then statements about interactions to working models. To demonstrate that working models are organized as relational schemas, Baldwin and colleagues created a set of written scenarios that described interactions dealing with trust, dependency and closeness.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Fehr Keedian Seidel Thompson 93"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | last2 = Fehr | first2 = B. | last3 = Keedian | first3 = E. | last4 = Seidel | first4 = M. | last5 = Thompson | first5 = D.W. | year = 1993 | title = An exploration of the relational schemata underlying attachment styles: self-report and lexical decision approaches | url = | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 746–754 | doi=10.1177/0146167293196010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the scenarios for closeness included:
* You want to spend more time with your attachment.
* You reach out to hug or kiss your partner.
* You tell your attachment how deeply you feel for him or her.

Following each scenario, people were presented with two options about how their attachments might respond. One option was "he/she accepts you." The other option was "he/she rejects you." People were asked to rate the likelihood of each response on a seven-point scale. Ratings of likely attachment responses corresponded to people's attachment styles. People with secure attachment styles were more likely to expect accepting responses from their attachments. Their relational schema for the third closeness scenario would be, "''If'' I tell my partner how deeply I feel for him or her, ''then'' my partner will accept me." People with other attachment styles were less likely to expect accepting responses from their attachments. Their relational schema for the third closeness scenario would be, "''If'' I tell my partner how deeply I feel for him or her, ''then'' my attachment will reject me." Differences in attachment styles reflected differences in relational schemas. Relational schemas may therefore be used to understand the organization of working models of attachment, as has been demonstrated in subsequent studies.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Fehr 95"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | last2 = Fehr | first2 = B. | year = 1995 | title = On the Instability of Attachment Style Ratings | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 247–261 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1995.tb00090.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baldwin Keelan Fehr Enns Koh-Rangarajoo 96"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | last2 = Keelan | first2 = J.P.R. | last3 = Fehr | first3 = B. | last4 = Enns | first4 = V. | last5 = Koh-Rangarajoo | first5 = E. | year = 1996 | title = Social-cognitive conceptualization of attachment working models: Availability and accessibility effects | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 94–109 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.71.1.94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baldwin Meunier 99"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | last2 = Meunier | first2 = J. | year = 1999 | title = The Cued Activation of Attachment Relational Schemas | url = | journal = Social Cognition | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 209–227 | doi=10.1521/soco.1999.17.2.209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relational schemas involved in working models are likely organized into a hierarchy. According to Baldwin:
{{quote|A person may have a general working model of relationships, for instance, to the effect that others tend to be only partially and unpredictably responsive to one's needs. At a more specific level, this expectation will take different forms when considering different role relationships, such as customer or romantic partner. Within romantic relationships, expectations might then vary significantly depending on the specific attachment, or the specific situation, or the specific needs being expressed. (Baldwin, 1992, p. 429).&lt;ref name="Baldwin 92"/&gt;}}

The highest level of the hierarchy contains very general relational schemas that apply to all relationships. The next level of the hierarchy contains relational schemas that apply to particular kinds of relationships. The lowest level of the hierarchy contains relationship schemas that apply to specific relationships.

In fact, several theorists have proposed a hierarchical organization of working models.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 80"&gt;Bowlby, J.

''Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development'', 50 (1–2, Serial No. 209).&lt;/ref&gt; Pietromonaco and Barrett note:
{{quote|From this perspective, people do not hold a single set of working models of the self and others; rather, they hold a family of models that include, at higher levels, abstract rules or assumptions about attachment relationships and, at lower levels, information about specific relationships and events within relationships. These ideas also imply that working models are not a single entity but are multifaceted representations in which information at one level need not be consistent with information at another level. (Pietromonaco &amp; Barrett, 2000, page 159)&lt;ref name="Pietromonaco Barrett 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pietromonaco | first1 = P.R. | last2 = Barrett | first2 = L.F. | year = 2000 | title = The internal working models concept: What do we really know about the self in relation to others? | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 155–175 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.4.2.155}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Every hierarchy for working models includes both general working models (higher in the hierarchy) and relationship-specific working models (lower in the hierarchy). Studies have supported the existence of both general working models and relationship-specific working models. People can report a general attachment style when asked to do so, and the majority of their relationships are consistent with their general attachment style.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Keelan Fehr Enns Koh-Rangarajoo 96"/&gt; A general attachment style indicates a general working model that applies to many relationships. Yet, people also report different styles of attachments to their friends, parents and lovers.&lt;ref name="Trinke Bartholomew 97"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trinke | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Bartholomew | first2 = K. | year = 1997 | title = Hierarchies of attachment relationships in young adulthood | url = | journal = [[Journal of Social and Personal Relationships]] | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 603–625 | doi=10.1177/0265407597145002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="La Guardia Ryan Couchman Deci 00"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=La Guardia JG, Ryan RM, Couchman CE, Deci EL |title=Within-person variation in security of attachment: a self-determination theory perspective on attachment, need fulfillment, and well-being |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=367–84 |date=September 2000 |pmid=10981840 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.79.3.367 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/79/3/367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relationship-specific attachment styles indicate relationship-specific working models. Evidence that general working models and relationship-specific working models are organized into a hierarchy comes from a study by Overall, Fletcher and Friesen.&lt;ref name="Overall Fletcher Friesen 03"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Overall | first1 = N.C. | last2 = Fletcher | first2 = G.J.O. | last3 = Friesen | first3 = M.D. | year = 2003 | title = Mapping the [[intimate relationship]] mind: Comparisons between three models of attachment representations | url = | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 1479–1493 | doi=10.1177/0146167203251519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, the mental working models that underlie attachment styles appear to contain information about self and information about others organized into relational schemas. The relational schemas are themselves organized into a three-tier hierarchy. The highest level of the hierarchy contains relational schemas for a general working model that applies to all relationships. The middle level of the hierarchy contains relational schemas for working models that apply to different types of relationships (e.g., friends, parents, lovers). The lowest level of the hierarchy contains relational schemas for working models of specific relationships.

===Stability of working models===
Investigators study the stability of working models by looking at the stability of attachment styles. Attachment styles reflect the thoughts and expectations that constitute working models. Changes in attachment styles therefore indicate changes in working models.

Around 70–80% of people experience no significant changes in attachment styles over time.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Fehr 95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Waters Merrick Treboux Crowell Albersheim 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = E. | last2 = Merrick | first2 = S. | last3 = Treboux | first3 = D. | last4 = Crowell | first4 = J. | last5 = Albersheim | first5 = L. | year = 2000 | title = Attachment security in infancy and early adulthood: A twenty-year longitudinal study | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 684–689 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00176 | pmid=10953934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick Hazen 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kirkpatrick | first1 = L. | last2 = Hazen | first2 = C. | year = 1994 | title = Attachment styles and close relationships: A four year prospective study | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 123–142 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1994.tb00058.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeney Noller 92"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feeney | first1 = J. | last2 = Noller | first2 = P. | year = 1992 | title = Attachment style and romantic love: Relationship dissolution | url = | journal = Australian Journal of Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 69–74 | doi=10.1080/00049539208260145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scharfe Bartholomew 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scharfe | first1 = E. | last2 = Bartholomew | first2 = K. | year = 1994 | title = Reliability and stability of adult attachment patterns | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 23–43 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1994.tb00053.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that attachment styles do not change for a majority of people indicates working models are relatively stable. Yet, around 20–30% of people do experience changes in attachment styles. These changes can occur over periods of weeks or months. The number of people who experience changes in attachment styles, and the short periods over which the changes occur, suggest working models are not rigid personality traits.

Why attachment styles change is not well understood. Waters, Weinfield and Hamilton propose that negative life experiences often cause changes in attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Waters Weinfield Hamilton 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = E. | last2 = Weinfield | first2 = N.S. | last3 = Hamilton | first3 = C.E. | year = 2000 | title = The stability of attachment styles from infancy to adolescence and early adulthood: General discussion | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 703–706 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their proposal is supported by evidence that people who experience negative life events also tend to experience changes in attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Waters Merrick Treboux Crowell Albersheim 00"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Hamilton 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = C.E. | year = 2000 | title = Continuity and discontinuity of attachment from infancy through adolescence | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 690–694 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinfield Sroufe Egelund 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weinfield | first1 = N.

The study found that all four sets of factors cause changes in attachment styles. Changes in attachment styles are complex and depend on multiple factors.

==Relationship outcomes==
Adult relationships vary in their outcomes. The participants of some relationships express more [[Contentment|satisfaction]] than the participants of other relationships. The participants of some relationships stay together longer than the partners of other relationships. Does attachment influence the satisfaction and duration of relationships?

===Satisfaction===
Several studies have linked attachment styles to relationship satisfaction. People who have secure attachment styles usually express greater satisfaction with their relationships than people who have other attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Brennan Shaver 95"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brennan | first1 = K.A. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | year = 1995 | title = Dimensions of adult attachment, affect regulation, and romantic relationship functioning | url = | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 267–283 | doi=10.1177/0146167295213008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeney 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feeney | first1 = J.A. | year = 1994 | title = Attachment style, communication patterns and satisfaction across the life cycle of marriage | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 333–348 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1994.tb00069.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeney 96"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feeney | first1 = J.A. | year = 1996 | title = Attachment, caregiving, and marital satisfaction | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 401–416 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1996.tb00124.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeney Noller Callan 94"&gt;Feeney, J.A., Noller, P., &amp; Callan, V.J.

Although the link between attachment styles and marital satisfaction has been firmly established, the mechanisms by which attachment styles influence marital satisfaction remain poorly understood. One mechanism may be communication. Secure attachment styles may lead to more constructive communication and more intimate self-disclosures, which in turn increase relationship satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Feeney 94"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Keelan Dion Dion 98"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keelan | first1 = J.P.R. | last2 = Dion | first2 = K.K. | last3 = Dion | first3 = K.L. | year = 1998 | title = Attachment style and relationship satisfaction: Test of a self-disclosure explanation | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 24–35 | doi=10.1037/h0087055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other mechanisms by which attachment styles may influence relationship satisfaction include emotional expressiveness,&lt;ref name="Feeney 99"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feeney | first1 = J.A. | year = 1999 | title = Adult attachment, emotional control, and marital satisfaction | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 169–185 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1999.tb00185.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davila Bradbury Fincham 98"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davila | first1 = J. | last2 = Bradbury | first2 = T.N. | last3 = Fincham | first3 = F. | year = 1998 | title = Negative affectivity as a mediator of the association between adult attachment and marital satisfaction | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 467–484 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1998.tb00183.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; strategies for coping with conflict,&lt;ref name="Lussier Sabourin Turgeon 97"/&gt; and perceived support from partners.&lt;ref name="Meyers Landsberger 02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb Davila Bradbury 01"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cobb | first1 = R.J. | last2 = Davila | first2 = J. | last3 = Bradbury | first3 = T.N. | year = 2001 | title = Attachment security and marital satisfaction: The role of positive perceptions and social support | url = | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 1131–1143 | doi=10.1177/0146167201279006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies are needed to better understand how attachment styles influence relationship satisfaction.

===Duration===
Some studies suggest people with secure attachment styles have longer-lasting relationships.&lt;ref name="Simpson 90"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simpson | first1 = J.A. | year = 1990 | title = Influence of attachment styles on romantic relationships | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 971–980 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.5.971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duemmler Kobak 01"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duemmler | first1 = S.L. | last2 = Kobak | first2 = R. | year = 2001 | title = The development of commitment and attachment in dating relationships: attachment security as relationship construct | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescence | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 401–415 | doi=10.1006/jado.2001.0406}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be partly due to commitment. People with secure attachment styles tend to express more commitment to their relationships. People with secure attachment styles also tend to be more satisfied with their relationships, which may encourage them to stay in their relationships longer. However, secure attachment styles are by no means a guarantee of long-lasting relationships.

Nor are secure attachment styles the only attachment styles associated with stable relationships. People with anxious–preoccupied attachment styles often find themselves in long-lasting, but unhappy, relationships.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick Davis 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kirkpatrick | first1 = L.A. | last2 = Davis | first2 = K.E. | year = 1994 | title = Attachment style, gender, and relationship stability: A longitudinal analysis | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 66 | issue = | pages = 502–512 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.3.502}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davila Bradbury 01"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davila | first1 = J. | last2 = Bradbury | first2 = T.N. | year = 2001 | title = Attachment insecurity and the distinction between unhappy spouses who do and do not divorce | url = | journal = Journal of Family Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 371–393 | doi=10.1037/0893-3200.15.3.371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anxious–preoccupied attachment styles often involve anxiety about being abandoned and doubts about one's worth as a relationship. These kinds of feelings and thoughts may lead people to stay in unhappy relationships.

==Relationship dynamics==
Attachment plays a role in the way actors interact with one another. A few examples include the role of attachment in affect regulation, support, intimacy, and [[jealousy]]. These examples are briefly discussed below. Attachment also plays a role in many interactions not discussed in this article, such as conflict, communication and sexuality.&lt;ref name="Rholes Simpson Stevens 98"&gt;Rholes, W.S., Simpson, J.A., &amp; Stevens, J.G.

(pp. 183–201) Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affect regulation===
Bowlby, in studies with children, observed that certain kinds of events trigger anxiety, and that people try to relieve their anxiety by seeking closeness and comfort from caregivers.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 69"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1969/1982) Attachment, Vol. 1 of Attachment and loss. London: Hogarth Press. New York: Basic Books (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; Three main sets of conditions trigger anxiety in children:
* Conditions of the child (fatigue, hunger, illness, pain, cold, etc.)
* Conditions involving the caregiver (caregiver absent, caregiver departing, caregiver discouraging of proximity, caregiver giving attention to another child, etc.)
* Conditions of the environment (alarming events, criticism or rejection by others)

The anxiety triggered by these conditions motivates the individuals to engage in behaviors that bring them physically closer to caregivers. A similar dynamic occurs in adults in relationships where others care about them. Conditions involving personal well-being, conditions involving a relationship partner, and conditions involving the environment can trigger anxiety in adults. Adults try to alleviate their anxiety by seeking physical and psychological closeness to their partners.

Mikulincer, Shaver and Pereg have developed a model for this dynamic.&lt;ref name="Mikulincer Shaver Pereg 03"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mikulincer | first1 = M. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | last3 = Pereg | first3 = D. | year = 2003 | title = Attachment theory and affect regulation: The dynamics, development, and cognitive consequences of attachment-related strategies | url = | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 77–102 | doi=10.1023/a:1024515519160}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the model, when people experience anxiety, they try to reduce their anxiety by seeking closeness with relationship partners. However, the partners may accept or reject requests for greater closeness. This leads people to adopt different strategies for reducing anxiety. People engage in three main strategies to reduce anxiety.

The first strategy is called the ''security-based'' strategy. The diagram below shows the sequence of events in the security-based strategy.
[[File:Attachment Theory Security Based.png|border|center|Security-based strategy of affect regulation.]]
A person perceives something that provokes anxiety. The person tries to reduce the anxiety by seeking physical or psychological closeness to her or his attachment. The attachment responds positively to the request for closeness, which reaffirms a sense of security and reduces anxiety. The person returns to her or his everyday activities.

The second strategy is called the ''hyperactivation'', or anxiety attachment, strategy. The diagram below shows the sequence of events in the hyperactivation strategy.
[[File:Attachment Theory Hyperactivation.png|border|center|Hyperactivation strategy of affect regulation.]]
The events begin the same way. Something provokes anxiety in a person, who then tries to reduce anxiety by seeking physical or psychological closeness to their attachment. The attachment rebuffs the request for greater closeness. The lack of responsiveness increases feelings of insecurity and anxiety. The person then gets locked into a cycle with the attachment: the person tries to get closer, the attachment rejects the request for greater closeness, which leads the person to try even harder to get closer, followed by another rejection from the attachment, and so on. The cycle ends only when the situation shifts to a security-based strategy (because the attachment finally responds positively) or when the person switches to an attachment avoidant strategy (because the person gives up on getting a positive response from the attachment).

The third strategy is called the ''attachment avoidance'' strategy. The following diagram shows the sequence of events in the attachment avoidance strategy.
[[File:Attachment Theory Attachment Avoidance.png|border|center|Attachment avoidance strategy of affect regulation.]]
The events begin the same way as the security-based strategy. A person perceives something that triggers anxiety, and the person tries to reduce anxiety by seeking physical or psychological closeness to her or his attachment. But the attachment is either unavailable or rebuffs the request for closeness. The lack of responsiveness fuels insecurity and heightens anxiety. The person gives up on getting a positive response from the attachment, suppresses her or his anxiety, and distances herself or himself from the attachment.

Mikulincer, Shaver, and Pereg contend these strategies of regulating attachment anxiety have very different consequences.&lt;ref name="Mikulincer Shaver Pereg 03"/&gt; The security-based strategy leads to more positive thoughts, such as more positive explanations of why others behave in a particular way and more positive memories about people and events. More positive thoughts can encourage more creative responses to difficult problems or distressing situations. The hyperactivation and attachment avoidance strategies lead to more negative thoughts and less creativity in handling problems and stressful situations. It is notable that the security-based strategy is contingent on a positive response from their attachment. From this perspective, it would benefit people to have attachments who are willing and able to respond positively to the person's request for closeness, so that they can use security-based strategies for dealing with their anxiety.

===Support===
People feel less anxious when close to their attachments because their attachments can provide support during difficult situations. Support includes the comfort, assistance, and information people receive from their attachments.

Attachment influences both the perception of support from others and the tendency to seek support from others. People who have attachments who respond consistently and positively to requests for closeness allow individuals to have secure attachments, and in return they seek more support, in a generally relaxed way, while people whose attachments are inconsistent in reacting positively or regularly reject requests for support find they need to use other attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Kobak Sceery 88"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kobak | first1 = R.R. | last2 = Sceery | first2 = A. | year = 1988 | title = Attachment in late adolescence: Working models, affect regulation, and representations of self and others | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 135–146 | doi=10.2307/1130395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mikulincer Florian Weller 93"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mikulincer | first1 = M. | last2 = Florian | first2 = V. | last3 = Weller | first3 = A. | year = 1993 | title = Attachment styles, coping strategies, and post-traumatic psychological distress: The impact of the Gulf War in Israel | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 817–826 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.5.817}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simpson Rholes Nelligan 92"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simpson | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Rholes | first2 = W.S. | last3 = Nelligan | first3 = J.S. | year = 1992 | title = Support seeking and support giving within couples in an anxiety provoking situation: The role of attachment styles | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 434–446 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.62.3.434}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Florian Mikulincer Bucholtz 95"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Florian V, Mikulincer M, Bucholtz I |title=Effects of adult attachment style on the perception and search for social support |journal=J Psychol |volume=129 |issue=6 |pages=665–76 |date=November 1995 |pmid=7500299 |doi=10.1080/00223980.1995.9914937}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with secure attachment styles may trust their attachments to provide support because their attachments have reliably offered support in the past. They may be more likely to ask for support when it's needed. People with insecure attachment styles often do not have a history of supportive responses from their attachments. They may rely less on their attachments and be less likely to ask for support when it's needed, though there may be other factors involved, as well.

Changes in the way people perceive attachment tend to occur with changes in the way people perceive support. One study looked at college students' perceptions of attachment to their mothers, fathers, same-sex friends, and opposite-sex friends&lt;ref name="Asendorpf Wilpers 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Asendorpf | first1 = J.B. | last2 = Wilpers | first2 = S. | year = 2000 | title = Attachment security and available support: Closely linked relationship qualities | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 115–138 | doi=10.1177/0265407500171006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and found that when students reported changes in attachment for a particular relationship, they usually reported changes in support for that relationship as well. Changes in attachment for one relationship did not affect the perception of support in other relationships. The link between changes in attachment and changes in support was relationship-specific.

===Intimacy===
Attachment theory has always recognized the importance of intimacy. Bowlby writes:
{{quote|Attachment theory regards the propensity to make intimate emotional bonds to particular individuals as a basic component of human nature, already present in germinal form in the neonate and continuing through adult life into old age. (Bowlby, 1988, pp. 120–121)&lt;ref name="Bowlby 88"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1988). A secure base. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The desire for intimacy has biological roots and, in the great majority of people, persists from birth until death. The desire for intimacy also has important implications for attachment. Relationships that frequently satisfy the desire for intimacy lead to more secure attachments. Relationships that rarely satisfy the desire for intimacy lead to less secure attachments.

Collins and Feeney have examined the relationship between attachment and intimacy in detail.&lt;ref name="Collins Feeney 04"&gt;Collins, N.L. &amp; Freeney, B.C. (2004). An Attachment Theory Perspective on Closeness and Intimacy. In D.J. Mashek &amp; A. Aron (Eds.), ''Handbook of Closeness and Intimacy'', pp. 163–188. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; They define intimacy as a special set of interactions in which a person discloses something important about himself or herself, and their attachment responds to the disclosure in a way that makes the person feel validated, understood, and cared for. These interactions usually involve verbal self-disclosure. However, intimate interactions can also involve non-verbal forms of self-expression such as touching, hugging, kissing, and sexual behavior. From this perspective, intimacy requires the following:
* willingness to disclose one's true thoughts, feelings, wishes, and fears
* willingness to rely on an attachment for care and emotional support
* willingness to engage in physical intimacy in the case of romantic or potential romantic partners

Collins and Feeney review a number of studies showing how each attachment style relates to the willingness to self-disclose, the willingness to rely on partners, and the willingness to engage in physical intimacy. The secure attachment style is generally related to more self-disclosure, more reliance on partners, and more physical intimacy than other attachment styles. However, the amount of intimacy in a relationship can vary due to personality variables and situational circumstances, and so each attachment style may function to adapt an individual to the particular context of intimacy in which they live.

Mashek and Sherman report some findings on the desire for less closeness with partners.&lt;ref name="Mashek Sherman 04"&gt;Mashek, D.J., &amp; Sherman, M.D. (2004). Desiring less closeness with initimate others. In A. Aron and Mashek, D.J. (Eds.), ''Handbook of Closeness and Intimacy'' (pp. 343–356). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes too much intimacy can be suffocating. People in this situation desire less closeness with their partners. On one hand, the relationship between attachment styles and desire for less closeness is predictable. People who have fearful-avoidant and anxious-preoccupied attachment styles typically want greater closeness with their partners. People who have dismissive–avoidant attachment styles typically want less closeness with their partners. On the other hand, the relatively large numbers of people who admit to wanting less closeness with their partners (up to 57% in some studies) far outnumbers the people who have dismissive-avoidant attachment styles. This suggests people who have secure, anxious–preoccupied, or fearful-avoidant attachment styles sometimes seek less closeness with their partners. The desire for less closeness is not determined by attachment styles alone.

===Jealousy===
{{main|Jealousy}}
Jealousy refers to the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that occur when a person believes a valued relationship is threatened by a rival. A jealous person experiences anxiety about maintaining support, intimacy, and other valued qualities of her or his relationship. Given that attachment relates to anxiety regulation, support, and intimacy, as discussed above, it is not surprising that attachment also relates to jealousy.

Bowlby observed that attachment behaviors in children can be triggered by the presence of a rival:
{{quote|In most young children the mere sight of mother holding another baby in her arms is enough to elicit strong attachment behaviour. The older child insists on remaining close to his mother, or on climbing on to her lap. Often he behaves as though he were a baby. It is possible that this well-known behaviour is only a special case of a child reacting to mother's lack of attention and lack of responsiveness to him. The fact, however, that an older child often reacts in this way even when his mother makes a point of being attentive and responsive suggests that more is involved; and the pioneer experiments of Levy (1937) also indicate that the mere presence of a baby on mother's lap is sufficient to make an older child much more clinging. (Bowlby, 1969/1982, page 260)&lt;ref name="Bowlby 69"/&gt;}}

When children see a rival contending for a caregiver's attention, the children try to get close to the caregiver and capture the caregiver's attention. Attempts to get close to the caregiver and capture the caregiver's attention indicate the attachment system has been activated. But the presence of a rival also provokes jealousy in children. The jealousy provoked by a sibling rival has been described in detail.&lt;ref name="Volling McElwain Miller 02"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Volling | first1 = B.L. | last2 = McElwain | first2 = N.L. | last3 = Miller | first3 = A.L. | year = 2002 | title = Emotion regulation in context: The jealousy complex between young siblings and its relations with child and family characteristics | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 581–600 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have shown that a rival can provoke jealousy at very young ages. The presence of a rival can provoke jealousy in infants as young as six months old.&lt;ref name="Hart 02"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = S. | year = 2002 | title = Jealousy in 6-month-old infants | url = | journal = Infancy | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 395–402 | doi=10.1207/s15327078in0303_6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hart 04"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = S. | year = 2004 | title = When infants lose exclusive maternal attention: Is it jealousy? | url = | journal = Infancy | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 57–78 | doi=10.1207/s15327078in0601_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris 04"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = C.R. | year = 2004 | title = The evolution of jealousy | url = | journal = American Scientist | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 62–71 | doi=10.1511/2004.45.919}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment and jealousy can both be triggered in children by the presence of a rival.

Attachment and jealousy can be triggered by the same perceptual cues in adults, too.&lt;ref name="Sharpsteen Kirkpatrick 97"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharpsteen | first1 = D.J. | last2 = Kirkpatrick | first2 = L.A. | year = 1997 | title = Romantic jealousy and adult romantic attachment | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 627–640 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.3.627}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of the attachment can trigger both a need for close proximity and jealousy when people believe the attachment is spending time with a rival. The presence of a rival can also trigger greater need for attachment and jealousy.

Differences in attachment styles influence both the frequency and the pattern of jealous expressions. People who have anxious–preoccupied or fearful-avoidant attachment styles experience jealousy more often and view rivals as more threatening than people who have secure attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Sharpsteen Kirkpatrick 97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buunk 97"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buunk | first1 = B.P. | year = 1997 | title = Personality, birth order and attachment styles as related to various types of jealousy | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 997–1006 | doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(97)00136-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerrero 98"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guerrero | first1 = L.K. | year = 1998 | title = Attachment-style differences in the experience and expression of romantic jealousy | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 273–291 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1998.tb00172.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Radecki-Bush Farrell Bush 93"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Radecki-Bush | first1 = C. | last2 = Farrell | first2 = A.D. | last3 = Bush | first3 = J.I. | year = 1993 | title = Predicting jealous responses: The influence of adult attachment and depression on threat appraisal | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 569–588 | doi=10.1177/0265407593104006}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with different attachment styles also express jealousy in different ways. One study found that:
{{quote|Securely attached participants felt anger more intensely than other emotions and were relatively more likely than other participants to express it, especially toward their attachment. And although anxious participants felt anger relatively intensely, and were as likely as others to express it through irritability, they were relatively unlikely to actually confront their attachment. This might be attributable to feelings of inferiority and fear, which were especially characteristic of the anxiously attached and which might be expected to inhibit direct expressions of anger. Avoidants felt sadness relatively more intensely than did secures in both studies. Further, avoidants were relatively more likely than others to work to maintain their self-esteem and, perhaps as a consequence, relatively unlikely to be brought closer to their attachment. (Sharpsteen &amp; Kirkpatrick, 1997, page 637)&lt;ref name="Sharpsteen Kirkpatrick 97"/&gt;}}

A subsequent study has confirmed that people with different attachment styles experience and express jealousy in qualitatively different ways.&lt;ref name="Guerrero 98"/&gt; Attachment thus plays an important role in jealous interactions by influencing the frequency and the manner in which attachments express jealousy.

===After love===
After dissolution of important romantic relationships people usually go through separation anxiety and grieving. Grief is a process which leads to the acceptance of loss and usually allows the person to move on. During this process people use different strategies to cope. Securely attached individuals tend to look for support, the most effective coping strategy. Avoidantly attached individuals tend to devalue the relationships and to withdraw. Anxiously attached individuals are more likely to use emotionally focused coping strategies and pay more attention to the experienced distress (Pistole, 1996). After the end of the relationships, securely attached individuals tend to have less negative overall emotional experience than insecurely attached individuals  (Pistole, 1995).

===Same-sex relationships===
Ridge &amp; Feeney (1998) have studied a group of gays and lesbians in Australian universities. Results showed that the frequency of attachment styles in the gay and lesbian population was the same as in the heterosexual; at the same time attachment styles have predicted relationship variables in a similar way as in the heterosexual population. However, gay and lesbian adult attachment styles were not related to childhood experiences with parents. Contradicting this last result, Robinson (1999) has found that in the lesbian population there was a link between attachment styles and early parenting. However, unlike in heterosexual females, attachment style was related to participants' relationship with their fathers.

'''Band emission''', is the fraction of the total emission from a [[blackbody]] that is in a certain [[wavelength]] interval or band. For a prescribed temperature, T and the spectral interval from 0 to λ, is the ratio of the total emissive power of a black body  from 0 to λ to the total emissive power over the entire spectrum.
:&lt;math&gt;F_{0,\lambda} = \frac{\int_0^\lambda E_{\lambda,b} d\lambda}{\int_0^\infty E_{\lambda,b} d\lambda} =\frac{\int_0^\lambda E_{\lambda,b} d\lambda}{\sigma T ^4} =\int_0^{\lambda T} \frac{E_{\lambda,b}}{\sigma T ^5} d(\lambda T) = f(\lambda T) &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:WealdBasinCrossSection.png|thumb|300px|[[Cross section (geometry)|Cross section]] of the [[Weald]] in England. A basement high can be seen in the centre-left.]]
In [[geology]], a '''basement high''' is a portion of the [[basement (geology)|basement]] in a [[sedimentary basin]] that is higher than its surroundings. Commonly, structures referred to as basement highs are hidden by the sedimentary fill of the basin. Usually basement highs are elongated features of [[tectonics|tectonic]] origin.

'''Bender Glacier''' ({{Coord|78|43|S|85|20|W|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a [[glacier]] that flows from [[Mount Atkinson]] and [[Mount Craddock]] southwards between [[Chaplin Peak]] and [[Krusha Peak]], and joins [[Nimitz Glacier]] just south of [[Gilbert Spur]] in the southern [[Sentinel Range]], [[Ellsworth Mountains]] in [[Antarctica]]. Receiving ice influx from its left tributaries [[Severinghaus Glacier]], [[Brook Glacier]] and [[Bolgrad Glacier]].

It was named by the [[Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names]] (2006) after Professor [[Michael L. Bender]] at the Department of Geosciences (Geochemistry), [[Princeton University]] (earlier at the Graduate School of Oceanography, [[University of Rhode Island]]), whose paleoclimate research from 1984 centered on the glacial-interglacial climate change and the global carbon cycle.

'''Bibliometrix''' package is a [[R (programming language)|R]] tool (http://www.bibliometrix.org) providing a set of tools for quantitative research in [[scientometrics]] and [[bibliometrics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pritchard, A|year=1969|title=Statistical bibliography or bibliometrics|journal=Journal of documentation|volume=25, 348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bibliometrics is the application of quantitative analysis and statistics to publications such as journal articles and their accompanying citation counts. Quantitative evaluation of publication and citation data is now used in almost all science fields to evaluate growth, maturity, leading authors, conceptual and intellectual maps, trend of a scientific community. Bibliometrics is also used in research performance evaluation,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cuccurullo|first=Corrado|last2=Aria|first2=Massimo|last3=Sarto|first3=Fabrizia|date=2016-05-21|title=Foundations and trends in performance management.

'''Bibliometrix''' is written in [[R (programming language)|R-language]]. [[R (programming language)|R]] is an open-source environment and ecosystem. The existence of substantial of good statistical algorithms, access to high-quality numerical routines, and integrated data visualization tools are perhaps the strongest qualities to prefer R to other languages for scientific computation.

'''Bibliometrix''' supports scholars in three key phases of analysis:
# Data importing and conversion to R data-frame;
# Descriptive analysis of a publication dataset;
# Network extraction for co-citation, coupling, and collaboration analyses. Matrices are the input data for performing network analysis, factorial analysis or multidimensional scaling analysis;
# Text mining of manuscripts (title, abstract, authors'  keywords, etc.);
# Co-word analysis.g

In [[metagenomics]], '''binning''' is the process of grouping reads or [[contig]]s and assigning them to [[operational taxonomic unit]]s. Binning methods can be based on either compositional features or [[sequence alignment|alignment]] (similarity), or both.

== Introduction ==

Metagenomic samples can contain reads from a huge number of organisms. For example, in a single gram of soil, there can be up to 18000 different types of organisms, each with its own genome.&lt;ref name="Nature2005"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metagenomic studies sample DNA from the whole community, and make it available as nucleotide sequences of [[DNA sequencing|certain length]]. In most cases, the incomplete nature of the obtained sequences makes it hard to assemble individual genes,&lt;ref name="Wooley2010"&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; much less recovering the full [[genome]]s of each organism. Thus, binning techniques represent a "best effort" to identify reads or [[contig]]s with certain groups of organisms designated as [[operational taxonomic unit]]s (OTUs).&lt;ref name="thomas2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = T. | last2 = Gilbert | first2 = J. | last3 = Meyer | first3 = F. | doi = 10.1186/2042-5783-2-3 | title = Metagenomics - a guide from sampling to data analysis | journal = Microbial Informatics and Experimentation | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 3 | year = 2012 | pmid =  22587947| pmc =3351745 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These marker genes had been previously sequenced from clonal cultures from known organisms, so, whenever one of such genes appeared in a read or contig from the metagenomic sample that read could be assigned to a known species or to the OTU of that species. The problem with this method was that only a tiny fraction of the sequences carried a marker gene, leaving most of the data unassigned.

Modern binning techniques use both previously available information independent from the sample and intrinsic information present in the sample. Depending on the diversity and complexity of the sample, their degree of success vary: in some cases they can resolve the sequences up to individual species, while in some others the sequences are identified at best with very broad taxonomic groups.

== Algorithms ==

Binning algorithms can employ previous information, and thus act as [[Supervised learning|supervised classifiers]], or they can try to find new groups, those act as [[Unsupervised learning|unsupervised classifiers]]. Many, of course, do both. The classifiers exploit the previously known sequences by performing [[Sequence alignment|alignments]] against [[Biological databases|databases]], and try to separate sequence based in organism-specific characteristics of the DNA,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== TETRA ===

TETRA is a statistical classifier that uses  tetranucleotide usage patterns in genomic fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
| volume = 5

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four possible nucleotides in [[DNA]], therefore there can be &lt;math&gt;4^4=256&lt;/math&gt; different fragments of four consecutive nucleotides; these fragments are called tetramers. TETRA works by tabulating the frequencies of each tetramer for a given sequence. From these frequencies  [[Standard score|z-scores]] are then calculated, which indicate how over- or under-represented the tetramer is in contraposition with what would be expected by looking to individual nucleotide compositions. The z-scores for each tetramer are assembled in a vector, and the vectors corresponding to different sequences are compared pair-wise, to yield a measure of how similar different sequences from the sample are. It is expected that the most similar sequences belong to organisms in the same OTU.

=== MEGAN ===

&lt;/ref&gt; approach, all reads are first aligned against a protein reference database, such as NCBI-nr, and then the resulting alignments are analyzed using the naive LCA algorithm, which places a read on the lowest taxonomic node in the NCBI taxonomy that lies above all taxa to which the read has a significant alignment.  Here, an alignment is usually deemed "significant", if its bit score lies above a given threshold (which depends on the length of the reads) and is within 10%, say, of the best score seen for that read. The rationale of using protein reference sequences, rather than DNA reference sequences, is that current DNA reference databases only cover a small fraction of the true diversity of genomes that exist in the environment. 

=== Phylopythia ===

Phylopythia is one supervised classifier developed by researchers at IBM labs, and is basically a [[support vector machine]] trained with  DNA-kmers from known sequences.&lt;ref name="Phylopythia" /&gt;

=== SOrt-ITEMS ===

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an alignment-based binning algorithm developed by Innovations Labs of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Ltd., India. Users need to perform a similarity search of the input metagenomic sequences (reads) against the nr protein database using BLASTx search. The generated blastx output is then taken as input by the SOrt-ITEMS program. The method uses a range of BLAST alignment parameter thresholds to first identify an appropriate taxonomic level (or rank) where the read can be assigned. An orthology-based approach is then adopted for the final assignment of the metagenomic read. Other alignment-based binning algorithms developed by the Innovation Labs of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) include DiScRIBinATE,&lt;ref name="Ghosh 2010 S14"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methodologies of these algorithms are summarized below.

=== DiScRIBinATE ===

DiScRIBinATE (Ghosh et al., 2010) &lt;ref name="Ghosh 2010 S14"/&gt; is an alignment-based binning algorithms developed by the Innovations Labs of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Ltd., India. DiScRIBinATE replaces the orthology approach of SOrt-ITEMS with a quicker 'alignment-free' approach. Incorporating this alternate strategy was observed to reduce the binning time by half without any significant loss in the accuracy and specificity of assignments. Besides, a novel reclassification strategy incorporated in DiScRIBinATE was seem to reduce the overall misclassification rate.

=== ProViDE ===

ProViDE (Ghosh et al., 2011) &lt;ref name="Ghosh 2011 91–94"/&gt; is an alignment-based binning approach developed by the Innovation Labs of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Ltd. for the estimation of viral diversity in metagenomic samples. ProViDE adopts the reverse orthlogy based approach similar to SOrt-ITEMS for the taxonomic classification of metagenomic sequences obtained from virome datasets. It a customized set of BLAST parameter thresholds, specifically suited for viral metagenomic sequences. These thresholds capture the pattern of sequence divergence and the non-uniform taxonomic hierarchy observed within/across various taxonomic groups of the viral kingdom.

=== PCAHIER ===

PCAHIER (Zheng et al., 2010),&lt;ref name ="zheng2010"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; another binning algorithm developed by the Georgia Institute of Technology., employs n-mer oligonucleotide frequencies as the features and adopts a hierarchical classifier (PCAHIER) for binning short metagenomic fragments. The principal component analysis was used to reduce the high dimensionality of the feature space. The effectiveness of the PCAHIER was demonstrated through comparisons against a non-hierarchical classifier, and two existing binning algorithms (TETRA and Phylopythia).

=== SPHINX ===

SPHINX (Mohammed et al., 2011),&lt;ref name="Mohammed 2011 22–30"/&gt; another binning algorithm developed by the Innovation Labs of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Ltd., adopts a hybrid strategy that achieves high binning efficiency by utilizing the principles of both 'composition'- and 'alignment'-based binning algorithms. The approach was designed with the objective of analyzing metagenomic datasets as rapidly as composition-based approaches, but nevertheless with the accuracy and specificity of alignment-based algorithms. SPHINX was observed to classify metagenomic sequences as rapidly as composition-based algorithms. In addition, the binning efficiency (in terms of accuracy and specificity of assignments) of SPHINX was observed to be comparable with results obtained using alignment-based algorithms.

All these algorithms employ different schemes for binning sequences, such as [[hierarchical classification]], and operate in either a [[supervised learning|supervised]] or [[unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] manner. These algorithms provide a global view of how diverse the samples are, and can potentially connect community composition and function in metagenomes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1411">In a toroidal [[fusion power]] device, a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] is confined within a donut-shaped cylinder. If the gas pressure of the plasma varies across the radius of the cylinder, a self-generated current will spontaneously arise within the plasma, due to [[collisions]] between [[trapped particles]] and passing particles. This current is called the '''bootstrap current''', and is commonly found in [[tokamak]] fusion devices. The tokamak uses a combination of external magnets and a current driven in the plasma to create a stable confinement system. One goal of advanced tokamak designs is to maximize the bootstrap current, and thereby reduce or eliminate the need for an external current driver. This could dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of the device.

From an engineering point of view the '''bootstrap current''' is the effect of trapped particles (which practically lie on poloidal plane) and density gradient: the poloidal current due to trapped particles motion is unbalanced since the density is not constant, therefore the bootstrap current is needed to "close the circuit".

'''Charles Whitwell''' (ca. 1568&amp;nbsp;1611) was an English scientific instrument maker.

An English engraver and maker of mathematical instruments in the tradition of [[Humphrey Cole]] (c. 1530&amp;nbsp;1591) and active between 1591 and 1606, Whitwell engraved maps of [[English counties]] and built many instruments that were invented by [[Robert Dudley (explorer)|Robert Dudley]] (1573&amp;nbsp;1649). These instruments, brought to [[Florence]] by Robert Dudley himself, were bequeathed to [[Ferdinand II de' Medici]] (1610&amp;nbsp;1670)&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Mayger Hind ''Engraving in England in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries''. CUP Archive, 1952, p223-226&lt;/ref&gt; and are now in the possession of the [[Museo Galileo]] of Florence.

{{Alternative medicine sidebar|fringe}}

Clinica 0-19 is a medical clinic in [[Monterrey]], Mexico that has garnered media attention for its treatment of [[Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma]] (DIPG). While the clinic states that their treatment has resulted in patients no longer having any evidence of disease, they have refused to publish their treatment protocol or survival rates. Some patients declared to have no evidence of the disease by the clinic's doctors were found to have tumor growth a few months later. Other oncologists have criticized the clinic's lead doctors, Alberto Siller and Alberto Garcia, for their lack of transparency.

== Treatment of Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma ==

Clinica 0-19 treats DIPG with intra-arterial chemotherapy and [[immunotherapy]]. While consultation and follow-up appointments take place at Clinica 0-19, treatments are carried out at nearby hospitals, especially Hospital Angeles.{{R|"SBM1"}}{{R|"SBM2"}}

For the intra-arterial chemotherapy, a [[catheter]] is inserted into the [[femoral artery]], guided to the patient's [[brainstem]], and used to deliver chemotherapy drugs.{{R|"Aussies"}}{{R|"SBM1"}} The clinic has stated the drugs they use are FDA approved.{{R|"MirFac"}}{{R|"SBM1"}} Their website does not provide any examples of the kinds of drugs used. Drugs they have employed in the past have included unusually low doses of [[cisplatin]], [[cetuximab]], [[doxorubicin]], and [[Avastin]].{{R|"SBM2"}} None of these drugs have been shown to be effective against DIPG, and Avastin has not approved by the FDA for use in children.{{R|"SBM2"}} According to the parents of one patient interviewed in 2018, the doctors administer "10 to 12 different types of medicines."{{R|"Capitol"}} Treatment is provided once every three weeks in some cases and once every six weeks in other cases for a total of ten or more times.{{R|"SBM2"}}{{R|"Annabelle"}} 

The immunotherapy provided by the clinic uses [[dendritic cells]].{{R|"SBM2"}} As of July 2018, very little had been published on the use of dendritic cells to treat DIPG.  

Siller and Garcia have not published their protocol for treatment. They characterize their approach as tailoring the treatment to each child.{{R|"SBM1"}} Surgical oncologist and outspoken skeptic, [[David Gorski]] has criticized this approach, stating "In other words, we make it up as we go along and can’t tell you how we do it in a sufficiently clear manner to make it possible to write a protocol to do it in a clinical trial." 

The clinic has also been criticized for discouraging their patients from using radiation therapy.{{R|"SBM2"}}  

=== Efficacy ===

No studies have been conducted on Clinica 0-19's approach to treating DIPG, and the clinic has not provided information on their patients' survival or recurrence rates.{{R|"SBM1"}}

The clinic has released scans appearing to show that patients' tumors have shrunk following treatment at the clinic.  Dr. David Ziegler, an Australian pediatric oncologist, has stated the scans "do do not accurately depict the tumor."{{R|"MirFac"}}{{R|"Shrunk"}} Gorski has noted the apparent shrinking could be the abatement of inflammation around the tumor caused by previous treatment.{{R|"SBM1"}}

Media coverage of the clinic has highlighted cases of patients who, following treatment by Siller and Garcia, lived longer than was initially expected.{{R|"MirFac"}}{{R|"Annabelle"}}{{R|"Aussies"}}  Gorski has noted that children receiving care at the clinic may have been likely to live longer than average DIPG patients, regardless of treatment by Clinica 0-19, because the clinic only treats patients who can travel to the clinic, forgo treatment with steroids for several months prior to treatment, and who can afford the hundreds of thousands of dollars charged by the clinic for treatment.{{R|"SBM1"}} He notes that patients who are able to travel abroad and thrive without steroids are likely in better health than the average DIPG patient, and that families that can access large amounts of money for treatment may not be typical of DIPG patients in other ways that could impact their survival.

=== Cost ===

The cost of treatment for DIPG through Clinica 0-19 is about $30,000 per treatment, with total costs exceeding $300,000 in some reported cases.{{R|"Aussies"}}{{R|"MirFac"}}

== Criticism ==

Ziegler and Gorski have criticized Siller and Garcia for not publishing their results or treatment protocol.{{R|"SBM1"}}{{R|"Aussies"}}

Australia's Cure Brain Cancer Foundation (CBCF) has sought to visit Clinica 0-19 to research the treatment it provides.{{R|"ABCRace"}}  CBCF has also offered to assist the clinic in reporting their findings.{{R|"Investigated"}} A spokesperson for the clinic stated the doctors would need to develop a program to receive visiting doctors before they could work with the CBCF. As of July 2018, there was no evidence that such visits have been planned.{{R|"SBM2"}}

In February 2018, Siller stated the clinic had "started to do some basic numbers" with the intention of publishing their results "in the next coming months."{{R|"MirFac"}}

== Media coverage of patients ==

Several Clinica 0-19 patients have been the subject of media coverage.

* Alexia Eljourdi, an Australian child, was treated by Clinica 0-19 after three years of living with DIPG.{{R|"Telegraph"}} Her parents exhausted their funds after four treatments, and were unable to continue treatment.{{R|"Riaa"}} Eljourdi died at age five, a month after her last treatment.

* Riaa Kulkarni, an Australian child, was age seven when she was diagnosed with DIPG.{{R|"Riaa"}} Her tumor shrank 40% after the first treatment by Clinica 0-19.{{R|"MirFac"}} Her parents sold their house to pay for treatment at Clinica 0-19.{{R|"Riaa"}}

* Buddy Miller, a child from Michigan, was diagnosed with DIPG at age seven.{{R|"Telegraph"}}{{R|"Capitol"}} In February 2018, Miller's tumor was reported to have disappeared following treatment by Clinica 0-19. By May 2018, the tumor was found to be growing again.

* Parker Monholland, from Silver Lake, Kansas, was diagnosed with DIPG at age 8.{{R|"SBM3"}}. While she was being treated by Clinica 0-19, Monholland's [[Ommaya reservoir]], implanted to deliver the chemotherapy drugs administered as part of the treatment provided by the clinic, became infected. She suffered a series of other health problems, and her parents exhausted their funds to provide her with treatment by Clinica 0-19. Her brain activity stopped, and her parents were not given the option of removing her from life support. She died five days later. The family's bill for the hospital in Mexico was in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

* Annabelle Nguyen, from Perth, Australia, was age two when she was diagnosed with DIPG and was given an estimated six to nine months to live.{{R|"Shrunk"}} Her parents sought treatment for her at Clinica 0-19, at a cost of $300,000, which her parents sold their home to pay for.{{R|"Investigated"}} As of February 2018, she was declared to have no evidence of the disease.{{R|"MirFac"}} In April 2018, they found evidence of tumors again.{{R|"Annabelle"}} Nguyen fell into a coma. While her family wanted to take her back to Australia, the cost of a flight equipped to care for her during the trip was prohibitively expensive, leaving the family with no choice but to have her cared for in a hospital in Mexico at a cost of thousands of dollars per day.{{R|"SBM1"}} In August of 2018, she died at the age of five, and three months after falling into a coma.{{R|"Annabelle"}}

* Annabelle Potts, from Canberra, Australia, was diagnosed with DIPG at age three and estimated to have six to nine months to live.{{R|"Lemon"}}{{R|"Aussies"}}{{R|"Sustain"}} Her parents sought treatment for her by Clinica 0-19. She was declared to have no evidence of the disease in March of 2018.{{R|"Investigated"}} By June 2018, the tumor began growing again.{{R|"Sustain"}} Pott's parent's decided to stop treatments at Clinica 0-19 when her tumors came back and her health declined.{{R|"Wiggles"}} Her mother stated as one of the reasons for stopping treatment with Clinica 0-19 "...I’m upset with them [the Mexican doctors] because they should be sharing what they are doing with the world and I’m upset we can’t do more experimental treatments for terminally ill children here in Australia.”

* Adalynne "Addy" Joy Sooter, a girl from Arkansas, was diagnosed with DIPG at the age of two. Doctors told her parents Sooter likely only had a few months to live.{{R|"SBM1"}} Her parents spent over $200,000 on travel to and treatment by Clinica 0-19. She died just over a year and a half after she was diagnosed, on June 3, 2018.{{R|"Father"}}

* Alan Vasquez, a child from Orlando, FL. was diagnosed with DIPG at age 8.{{R|"Orlando"}} His parents sold their home to pay for treatment at Clinica 0-19. In April 2017, he was reported to have a 50% reduction in the size of his tumor. He died in November 2017.{{R|"Orange"}}

It holds that objects have certain pairs of complementary properties which cannot all be observed or measured simultaneously.

The complementarity principle was formulated by [[Niels Bohr]], a leading founder of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Evan Harris|title=The Physics of Consciousness|year=2000|publisher=Perseus|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-7382-0436-6|page=271|quote=...the founders of quantum mechanics – [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], [[Schrödinger]] and Bohr...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of complementary properties that Bohr considered:

* [[uncertainty principle|Position and momentum]]
* Energy and duration
* [[Spin (physics)|Spin]] on different axes
* [[Wave-particle duality|Wave and particle]]-related properties
* Value of a [[Field (physics)|field]] and its change (at a certain position)
* [[Quantum entanglement|Entanglement]] and coherence&lt;ref&gt; Cramer, J. G. et al. "An Inquiry into the Possibility of Nonlocal Quantum Communication". Foundation of Phys. Submitted. Revised Feb., 2015 [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.5098v2.pdf]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
For example, the [[wave-particle duality|particle and wave aspects]] of physical objects are such complementary phenomena.  Both concepts are borrowed from [[classical mechanics]], where it is impossible to be a particle and wave at the same time. Therefore, it is impossible to measure  the ''full'' properties of the wave and particle at a particular moment.&lt;ref name="Baggott2011"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Jim Baggott]] |title=The Quantum Story: A History in|year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn= |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Bohr implies that it is not possible to regard objects governed by quantum mechanics as having intrinsic properties independent of determination with a measuring device, a viewpoint supported by the [[Kochen-Specker theorem]]. The type of measurement determines which property is shown. However the single and [[double-slit experiment]] and other experiments show that ''some'' effects of wave and particle can be measured in one measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = María C. | last = Boscá Díaz-Pintado | title = Updating the wave-particle duality | booktitle = 15th UK and European Meeting on the Foundations of Physics | pages = | publisher = | date = 29–31 March 2007 | location = Leeds, UK | url = http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00003568/ | doi = | accessdate = 2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature==
An aspect of complementarity is that it not only applies to measurability or knowability of some property of a physical entity, but more importantly it applies to the limitations of that physical entity’s very manifestation of the property in the physical world.  All properties of physical entities exist only in pairs, which Bohr described as complementary or conjugate pairs.  Physical reality is determined and defined by manifestations of properties which are limited by trade-offs between these complementary pairs.  For example, an electron can manifest a greater and greater accuracy of its position only in even trade for a complementary loss in accuracy of manifesting its momentum.  This means that there is a limitation on the precision with which an electron can possess (i.e., manifest) position, since an infinitely precise position would dictate that its manifested momentum would be infinitely imprecise, or undefined (i.e., non-manifest or not possessed), which is not possible.  The ultimate limitations in precision of property manifestations are quantified by the Heisenberg [[uncertainty principle]] and [[Planck units]].  Complementarity and Uncertainty dictate that therefore all properties and actions in the physical world manifest themselves as non-deterministic to some degree.

Physicists F.A.M. Frescura and [[Basil Hiley]] have summarized the reasons for the introduction of the principle of complementarity in physics as follows:&lt;ref&gt;F. A. M. Frescura, [[Basil Hiley|B. J. Hiley]]: [http://www.bbk.ac.uk/tpru/BasilHiley/P12FrescandHiley3.pdf ''Algebras, quantum theory and pre-space''], published in Revista Brasileira de Fisica, Volume Especial, Julho 1984, Os 70 anos de Mario Schonberg, pp. 49–86, p.&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/ref&gt;
::“In the traditional view, it is assumed that there exists a reality in space-time and that this reality is a given thing, all of whose aspects can be viewed or articulated at any given moment. Bohr was the first to point out that quantum mechanics called this traditional outlook into question. To him the ‘indivisibility of the quantum of action’, which was his way of describing the uncertainty principle, implied that not all aspects of a system can be viewed simultaneously. By using one particular piece of apparatus only certain features could be made manifest at the expense of others, while with a different piece of apparatus another complementary aspect could be made manifest in such a way that the original set became non-manifest, that is, the original attributes were no longer well defined. For Bohr, this was an indication that the principle of complementarity, a principle that he had previously known to appear extensively in other intellectual disciplines but which did not appear in classical physics, should be adopted as a universal principle.”
The emergence of complementarity in a system occurs when one considers the circumstances under which one attempts to measure its properties; as Bohr noted, the principle of complementarity "implies the impossibility of any sharp separation between the behaviour of atomic objects and the interaction with the measuring instruments that serve to define the conditions under which the phenomena appear."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Foundations of Quantum Physics II (1933-1958) |author=Jørgen Kalckar, [[Niels Bohr]], [[Léon Rosenfeld]], Erik Rüdinger, Finn Aaserud |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yet5P7f_63oC&amp;pg=RA1-PA210&amp;dq=impossibility+of+any+sharp+separation+between+the+behaviour+of+atomic+objects+and+the+interaction+with+the+measuring+instruments#v=onepage&amp;q=impossibility%20of%20any%20sharp%20separation%20between%20the%20behaviour%20of%20atomic%20objects%20and%20the%20interaction%20with%20the%20measuring%20instruments&amp;f=false |publisher=Elsevier |page=210 |isbn=978-0-444-89892-0 |year=1996 |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important to distinguish, as did Bohr in his original statements, the principle of complementarity from a statement of the uncertainty principle. For a technical discussion of contemporary issues surrounding complementarity in physics see, e.g., Bandyopadhyay (2000),&lt;ref name="Bandyopadhyay2000"&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=quant-ph/0003073 |title=Welcher Weg Experiments and the Orthodox Bohr's Complementarity Principle |first=Supriyo |last=Bandyopadhyay |year=2000 |doi=10.1016/S0375-9601(00)00670-8|bibcode = 2000PhLA..276..233B |journal=Physics Letters A |volume=276 |issue=5–6 |pages=233–239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from which parts of this discussion were drawn.

==Additional considerations==
In his original lecture on the topic, Bohr pointed out that just as the finitude of the speed of light implies the impossibility of a sharp separation between space and time (relativity), the finitude of the [[Planck constant|quantum of action]] implies the impossibility of a sharp separation between the behavior of a system and its interaction with the measuring instruments and leads to the well known difficulties with the concept of 'state' in quantum theory; the notion of complementarity is intended to symbolize this new situation in epistemology created by quantum theory. Some people consider it a philosophical adjunct to [[quantum mechanics]], while others consider it to be a discovery that is as important as the formal aspects of quantum theory. Examples of the latter include [[Leon Rosenfeld]], who claimed that "[C]omplementarity is not a philosophical superstructure invented by Bohr to be placed as a decoration on top of the quantal formalism, it is the bedrock of the quantal description.",&lt;ref name="Bohr1996a"&gt;{{cite book |author=Niels Bohr |authorlink=Niels Bohr |author2=fwd. Léon Rosenfeld |author3=ed.

==Experiments==
The quintessential example of wave–particle complementarity in the laboratory is the [[double slit]]. The crux of the complementary behavior is the question: "What information exists – embedded in the constituents of the universe – that can reveal the history of the signal particles as they pass through the double slit?" If information exists (even if it [[quantum eraser|is not measured by a conscious observer]]) that reveals "which slit" each particle traversed, then each particle will exhibit no wave interference with the other slit. This is the particle-like behavior. But if ''no information'' exists about which slit – so that no conscious observer, no matter how well equipped, will ever be able to determine which slit each particle traverses – then the signal particles will interfere with themselves as if they traveled through both slits at the same time, as a wave. This is the wave-like behavior. These behaviors are complementary, according to the [[Englert–Greenberger duality relation]], because when one behavior is observed the other is absent. Both behaviors ''can'' be observed at the same time, but each only as lesser manifestations of their full behavior (as determined by the duality relation). This superposition of complementary behaviors exists whenever there is partial "which slit" information. While there is some contention to the duality relation, and thus complementarity itself, the [[Afshar experiment|contrary position]] is not accepted by mainstream physics.&lt;ref name=Haroche&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Haroche | first1 =Serge | last2 =Raimond | first2 =Jean-Michel | title =Exploring the Quantum: Atoms, Cavities, and Photons | publisher =Oxford University Press | edition =1st  | year =2006 | isbn =978-0198509141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|35–40}} Double slit experiments with single photons show clearly that photons are particles at the same time as they are waves. Photons impact the screen where they are detected in points, and when enough points have accumulated the wave aspect is clearly visible. Also the particle and wave aspect is seen at the same time in photons that are stationary.

Various [[neutron interferometry]] experiments demonstrate the subtlety of the notions of duality and complementarity. By passing through the [[interferometer]], the [[neutron]] appears to act as a wave.  Yet upon passage, the neutron is subject to [[gravitation]]. As the neutron interferometer is rotated through Earth's [[gravitational field]] a phase change between the two arms of the interferometer can be observed, accompanied by a change in the constructive and destructive interference of the neutron waves on exit from the interferometer.  Some interpretations claim that understanding the interference effect requires one to concede that a single neutron takes both paths through the interferometer at the same time; a single neutron would "be in two places at once", as it were.  Since the two paths through a neutron interferometer can be as far as {{nowrap|5 cm}} to {{nowrap|15 cm}} apart, the effect is hardly microscopic. This is similar to traditional double-slit and mirror interferometer experiments where the slits (or mirrors) can be arbitrarily far apart. So, in interference and diffraction experiments, neutrons behave the same way as photons (or electrons) of corresponding wavelength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==History==
Niels Bohr apparently conceived of the principle of complementarity during a skiing vacation in Norway in February and March 1927, during which he received a letter from [[Werner Heisenberg]] regarding the latter's newly discovered (and not yet published) [[uncertainty principle]].  Upon returning from his vacation, by which time Heisenberg had already submitted his paper on the uncertainty principle for publication, he convinced Heisenberg that the uncertainty principle was a manifestation of the deeper concept of complementarity.&lt;ref name="Baggott2011"/&gt; Heisenberg duly appended a note to this effect to his paper on the uncertainty principle, before its publication, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Bohr has brought to my attention [that] the uncertainty in our observation does not arise exclusively from the occurrence of discontinuities, but is tied directly to the demand that we ascribe equal validity to the quite different experiments which show up in the [particulate] theory on one hand, and in the wave theory on the other hand.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bohr publicly introduced the principle of complementarity in a lecture he delivered on 16 September 1927 at the International Physics Congress held in [[Como, Italy]], attended by most of the leading physicists of the era, with the notable exceptions of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], and [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]].  However, these three were in attendance one month later when Bohr again presented the principle at the [[Solvay Congress|Fifth Solvay Congress]] in [[Brussels, Belgium]].  The lecture was published in the proceedings of both of these conferences, and was republished the following year in ''Naturwissenschaften'' (in German) and in ''Nature'' (in English).&lt;ref name="Bohr1928English"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bohr N |title=The Quantum Postulate and the Recent Development of Atomic Theory |journal=Nature |volume=121 |pages=580–590 |year=1928 |doi= 10.1038/121580a0|bibcode =   1928Natur.121..580B}}  Available in the collection of Bohr's early writings, ''Atomic Theory and the Description of Nature'' (1934).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27110">[[Non-standard analysis]] and its offshoot, [[non-standard calculus]], have been criticized by several authors, notably [[Errett Bishop]], [[Paul Halmos]], and [[Alain Connes]].  These criticisms are analyzed below.

==Introduction==

The evaluation of non-standard analysis in the literature has varied greatly. [[Paul Halmos]] described it as a technical special development in mathematical logic. [[Terence Tao]] summed up the advantage of the hyperreal framework by noting that it

{{Quote|text=allows one to rigorously manipulate things such as "the set of all small numbers", or to rigorously say things like “η&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is smaller than anything that involves η&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;”, while greatly reducing epsilon management issues by automatically concealing many of the quantifiers in one’s argument.|sign=Terence Tao|source=''"Structure and randomness"'', American Mathematical Society (2008)&lt;ref&gt;Tao, T.: Structure and randomness. Pages from year one of a mathematical blog. American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2008. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The nature of the criticisms is not directly related to the logical status of the results proved using non-standard analysis. In terms of conventional mathematical foundations in classical logic, such results are quite acceptable.  [[Abraham Robinson]]'s non-standard analysis does not need any axioms beyond [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZFC) (as shown explicitly by [[Wilhelmus Luxemburg]]'s ultrapower construction of the [[hyperreal number|hyperreal]]s), while its variant by [[Edward Nelson]], known as [[Internal Set Theory|IST]], is similarly a [[conservative extension]] of [[ZFC]].&lt;ref&gt;This is shown in [[Edward Nelson]]'s AMS 1977 paper in an appendix written by William Powell.&lt;/ref&gt; It provides an assurance that the newness of non-standard analysis is entirely as a strategy of proof, not in range of results. Further, model theoretic non-standard analysis, for example based on superstructures, which is now a commonly used approach, does not need any new set-theoretic axioms beyond those of ZFC.{{Dubious|Superstructure approach and ZFC|date=April 2010}}

Controversy has existed on issues of mathematical pedagogy. Also non-standard analysis as developed is not the only candidate to fulfill the aims of a theory of infinitesimals (see [[Smooth infinitesimal analysis]]). [[Philip J. Davis]] wrote, in a book review of ''Left Back: A Century of Failed School Reforms''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43790988|title=Left back : a century of failed school reforms|last=Diane.|first=Ravitch,|date=2000|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=0684844176|location=New York|oclc=43790988}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Diane Ravitch:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.siam.org/news/news.php?id=527|title=SIAM: Educational Enthusiasms and Their Critics|last=Philip|first=J. Davis|date=April 9, 2001|website=archive.siam.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;blockquote&gt;There was the nonstandard analysis movement for teaching elementary calculus. Its stock rose a bit before the movement collapsed from inner complexity and scant necessity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Non-standard calculus in the classroom has been analysed in the study by K. Sullivan of schools in the Chicago area, as reflected in secondary literature at [[Influence of non-standard analysis]].  Sullivan showed that students following the NSA course were better able to interpret the sense of the mathematical formalism of calculus than a control group following a standard syllabus.  This was also noted by Artigue (1994), page 172; Chihara (2007); and Dauben (1988).{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

==Bishop's criticism==
In the view of [[Errett Bishop]], classical mathematics, which includes Robinson's approach to nonstandard analysis, was non-constructive and therefore deficient in numerical meaning {{harv|Feferman|2000}}.  Bishop was particularly concerned about the use of non-standard analysis in teaching  as he discussed in his essay "Crisis in mathematics" {{harv|Bishop|1975}}.  Specifically, after discussing [[Formalism (mathematics)#Formalism|Hilbert's formalist program]] he wrote:

:A more recent attempt at mathematics by formal finesse is non-standard analysis.  I gather that it has met with some degree of success, whether at the expense of giving significantly less meaningful proofs I do not know.  My interest in non-standard analysis is that attempts are being made to introduce it into calculus courses.  It is difficult to believe that debasement of meaning could be carried so far.

Katz &amp; Katz (2010) note that a number of criticisms were voiced by the participating mathematicians and historians following Bishop's "Crisis" talk, at the AAAS workshop in 1974. However, not a word was said by the participants about Bishop's ''debasement'' of Robinson's theory. Katz &amp; Katz point out that it recently came to light that Bishop in fact said not a word about Robinson's theory at the workshop, and only added his ''debasement'' remark at the galley proof stage of publication.  This helps explain the absence of critical reactions at the workshop.  Katz &amp; Katz conclude that this raises issues of integrity on the part of Bishop whose published text does not report the fact that the "debasement" comment was added at galley stage and therefore was not heard by the workshop participants, creating a spurious impression that they did not disagree with the comments.

The fact that Bishop viewed the introduction of non-standard analysis in the classroom as a "debasement of meaning" was noted by J. Dauben.&lt;ref&gt;in [[Donald A. Gillies|Donald Gillies]], ''[[Revolutions in Mathematics]]'' (1992), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was clarified by Bishop (1985, p.&amp;nbsp;1) in his text ''Schizophrenia in contemporary mathematics'' (first distributed in 1973), as follows:
:Brouwer's criticisms of classical mathematics were concerned with what I shall refer to as "the debasement of meaning".

Thus, Bishop first applied the term "debasement of meaning" to classical mathematics as a whole, and later applied it to Robinson's infinitesimals in the classroom.  In his ''Foundations of Constructive Analysis'' (1967, page ix), Bishop wrote:

:Our program is simple: To give numerical meaning to as much as possible of classical abstract analysis. Our motivation is the well-known scandal, exposed by Brouwer (and others) in great detail, that classical mathematics is deficient in numerical meaning.

Bishop's remarks are supported by the  discussion following His lecture:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0315086075901135|title=The crisis in contemporary mathematics |language=en|access-date=2017-05-12|doi=10.1016/0315-0860(75)90113-5|volume=2|journal=Historia Mathematica|pages=507–517 | last1 = Bishop | first1 = Errett |year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* George Mackey (Harvard): "I don't want to think about these questions. I have faith that what I am doing will have some kind of meaning...."  
* Garrett Birkhoff (Harvard): "...I think this is what Bishop is urging. We should keep track of our assumptions and keep an open mind."  
* Shreeram Abhyankar: (Purdue): "My paper is in complete sympathy with Bishop's position."  J.P. Kahane (U. de Paris): "...I have to respect Bishop's work but I find it boring...."  
* Bishop (UCSD): "Most mathematicians feel that mathematics has meaning but it bores them to try to find out what it is...."  
* Kahane: I feel that Bishop's appreciation has more significance than my lack of appreciation."

===Bishop's review===

Bishop reviewed the book ''[[Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach]]'' by [[Howard Jerome Keisler|Keisler]], which presented elementary calculus using the methods of nonstandard analysis. Bishop was chosen by his [[advisor]] [[Paul Halmos]] to review the book.  The review appeared in the ''[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]'' in 1977.  This article is referred to by [[David O. Tall]] {{harv|Tall|2001}} while discussing the use of non-standard analysis in education. Tall wrote:

:the use of the [[axiom of choice]] in the non-standard approach however, draws extreme criticism from those such as Bishop (1977) who insisted on explicit construction of concepts in the intuitionist tradition.

Bishop's review supplied several quotations from Keisler's book, such as:

:In 1960, Robinson solved a three-hundred-year-old problem by giving a precise treatment of infinitesimals.  Robinson's achievement will probably rank as one of the major mathematical advances of the twentieth century.

and

:In discussing the real line we remarked that we have no way of knowing what a line in physical space is really like. It might be like the hyperreal line, the real line, or neither.  However, in applications of the calculus, it is helpful to imagine a line in physical space as a hyperreal line.

The review criticized Keisler's text for not providing evidence to support these statements, and for adopting an axiomatic approach when it was not clear to the students there was any system that satisfied the axioms {{harv|Tall|1980}}. The review ended as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The technical complications introduced by Keisler's approach are of minor
importance. The real damage lies in [Keisler's] obfuscation and devitalization of those
wonderful ideas [of standard calculus]. No invocation of Newton and Leibniz is going to justify
developing calculus using axioms V* and VI*-on the grounds that the usual
definition of a limit is too complicated!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although it seems to be futile, I always tell my calculus students that mathematics is not esoteric: It is common sense. (Even the notorious [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit]] is common sense, and moreover it is central to the important practical problems of approximation and estimation.) They do not believe me. In fact the idea makes them uncomfortable because it contradicts their previous experience. Now we have a calculus text that can be used to confirm their experience of mathematics as an esoteric and meaningless exercise in technique.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Responses===

In his response in ''The'' ''Notices'', Keisler (1977, p.&amp;nbsp;269) asked:

:why did [[Paul Halmos]], the ''Bulletin'' book review editor, choose a [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructivist]] as the reviewer?

Comparing the use of the [[law of excluded middle]] (rejected by constructivists) to wine, Keisler likened Halmos' choice with "choosing a [[teetotaller]] to sample wine".

Bishop's book review was subsequently criticized in the same journal by [[Martin Davis]], who wrote on p.&amp;nbsp;1008 of {{harvtxt|Davis|1977}}:
:Keisler's book is an attempt to bring back the intuitively suggestive Leibnizian methods that dominated the teaching of calculus until comparatively recently, and which have never been discarded in parts of applied mathematics. A reader of Errett Bishop's review of Keisler's book would hardly imagine that this is what Keisler was trying to do, since the review discusses neither Keisler's objectives nor the extent to which his book realizes them.

Davis added (p.&amp;nbsp;1008) that Bishop stated his objections

:without informing his readers of the [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructivist]] context in which this objection is presumably to be understood.

Physicist [[Vadim Komkov]] (1977, p.&amp;nbsp;270) wrote:

:Bishop is one of the foremost researchers favoring the constructive approach to mathematical analysis. It is hard for a constructivist to be sympathetic to theories replacing the real numbers by [[hyperreal number|hyperreal]]s.

Whether or not non-standard analysis can be done constructively, Komkov perceived a foundational concern on Bishop's part.

Philosopher of Mathematics [[Geoffrey Hellman]] (1993, p.&amp;nbsp;222) wrote:

:Some of Bishop's remarks (1967) suggest that his position belongs in [the radical constructivist] category ...

Historian of Mathematics [[Joseph Dauben]] analyzed Bishop's criticism in (1988, p.&amp;nbsp;192). After evoking the "success" of nonstandard analysis

:at the most elementary level at which it could be introduced—namely, at which calculus is taught for the first time,

Dauben stated:

:there is also a ''deeper'' level of meaning at which nonstandard analysis operates.

Dauben mentioned "impressive" applications in

:physics, especially [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and [[thermodynamics]], and in [[economics]], where study of exchange economies has been particularly amenable to nonstandard interpretation.

At this "deeper" level of meaning, Dauben concluded,

:Bishop's views can be questioned and shown to be as unfounded as his objections to nonstandard analysis pedagogically.

A number of authors have commented on the tone of Bishop's book review. Artigue (1992) described it as ''virulent''; Dauben (1996), as ''vitriolic''; Davis and Hauser (1978), as ''hostile''; Tall (2001), as ''extreme''.

[[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] (1986) compared Halmos' asking Bishop to review Keisler's book, to inviting [[Margaret Thatcher]] to review ''[[Das Kapital]]''.

Katz &amp; Katz (2010) point out that

:Bishop is criticizing apples for not being oranges: the critic (Bishop) and the criticized (Robinson's non-standard analysis) do not share a common foundational framework.

They further note that

:Bishop's preoccupation with the extirpation of the law of excluded middle led him to criticize classical mathematics as a whole in as vitriolic a manner as his criticism of non-standard analysis.

G. Stolzenberg responded to Keisler's ''Notices'' criticisms of Bishop's review in a letter, also published in ''The Notices.{{sfn|Stolzenberg|1978}}'' Stolzenberg argues that the criticism of Bishop's review of Keisler's calculus book is based on the false assumption that they were made in a constructivist mindset whereas Stolzenberg believes that Bishop read it as it was meant to be read: in a classical mindset.

==Connes' criticism==
In "Brisure de symétrie spontanée et géométrie du point de vue spectral", Journal of Geometry and Physics 23 (1997), 206–234, [[Alain Connes]] wrote:

:"The answer given by non-standard analysis, namely a nonstandard real, is equally disappointing: every non-standard real canonically determines a (Lebesgue) non-measurable subset of the interval [0, 1], so that it is impossible (Stern, 1985) to exhibit a single [nonstandard real number]. The formalism that we propose will give a substantial and computable answer to this question."

In his 1995 article "Noncommutative geometry and reality" Connes develops a calculus of infinitesimals based on operators in Hilbert space. He proceeds to "explain why the formalism of nonstandard analysis is inadequate" for his purposes. Connes points out the following three aspects of Robinson's hyperreals:

(1) a nonstandard hyperreal "cannot be exhibited" (the reason given being its relation to non-measurable sets);

(2) "the practical use of such a notion is limited to computations in which the final result is independent of the exact value of the above infinitesimal. This is the way nonstandard analysis and ultraproducts are used [...]".

(3) the hyperreals are commutative.

Katz &amp; Katz analyze Connes' criticisms of non-standard analysis, and challenge the specific claims (1) and (2).&lt;ref&gt;See Katz &amp; Katz (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  With regard to (1), Connes' own infinitesimals similarly rely on non-constructive foundational material, such as the existence of a [[Dixmier trace]].  With regard to (2), Connes presents the independence of the choice of infinitesimal as a ''feature'' of his own theory.

Kanovei et al. (2012) analyze Connes' contention that non-standard numbers are "chimerical".  They note that the content of his criticism is that ''ultrafilters'' are "chimerical", and point out that Connes exploited ultrafilters in an essential manner in his earlier work in functional analysis. They analyze Connes' claim that the hyperreal theory is merely "virtual".  Connes' references to the work of [[Robert Solovay]] suggest that Connes means to criticize the hyperreals for allegedly not being definable.  If so, Connes' claim concerning the hyperreals is demonstrably incorrect, given the existence of a definable model of the hyperreals constructed by [[Vladimir Kanovei]] and [[Saharon Shelah]] (2004). Kanovei et al. (2012) also provide a chronological table of increasingly vitriolic epithets employed by Connes to denigrate NSA over the period between 1995 and 2007, starting with "inadequate" and "disappointing" and culminating with "the end of the road for being 'explicit'".

Katz &amp; Leichtnam (2013) note that "two-thirds of Connes' critique of Robinson's infinitesimal approach can be said to be incoherent, in the specific sense of not being coherent with what Connes writes (approvingly) about his own infinitesimal approach."

==Halmos' remarks==
[[Paul Halmos]] writes in "Invariant subspaces", ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'' 85 (1978) 182&amp;ndash;183 as follows:
:"the extension to polynomially compact operators was obtained by Bernstein and Robinson (1966). They presented their result in the metamathematical language called non-standard analysis, but, as it was realized very soon, that was a matter of personal preference, not necessity."

Halmos writes in (Halmos 1985) as follows (p.&amp;nbsp;204):
:The Bernstein–Robinson proof [of the [[Invariant subspace problem|invariant subspace conjecture]] of Halmos]  uses non-standard models of higher order predicate languages, and when [Robinson] sent me his reprint I really had to sweat to pinpoint and translate its mathematical insight.

While commenting on the "role of non-standard analysis in mathematics", Halmos writes (p.&amp;nbsp;204):
:For some other[... mathematicians], who are against it (for instance [[Errett Bishop]]), it's an equally emotional issue...

Halmos concludes his discussion of non-standard analysis as follows (p.&amp;nbsp;204):
:it's a special tool, too special, and other tools can do everything it does.  It's all a matter of taste.

Katz &amp; Katz (2010) note that
:Halmos's anxiousness to evaluate Robinson's theory may have involved a conflict of interests [...] Halmos invested considerable emotional energy (and ''sweat'', as he memorably puts it in his autobiography) into his translation of the Bernstein–Robinson result [...] [H]is blunt unflattering comments appear to retroactively justify his translationist attempt to deflect the impact of one of the first spectacular applications of Robinson's theory.

==Comments by Bos and Medvedev==

Leibniz historian [[Henk J. M. Bos|Henk Bos]] (1974) acknowledged that Robinson's hyperreals provide

:[a] preliminary explanation of why the calculus could develop on the insecure foundation of the acceptance of infinitely small and infinitely large quantities.

F. Medvedev (1998) further points out that

:[n]onstandard analysis makes it possible to answer a delicate question bound up with earlier approaches to the history of classical analysis. If infinitely small and infinitely large magnitudes are regarded as inconsistent notions, how could they [have] serve[d] as a basis for the construction of so [magnificent] an edifice of one of the most important mathematical disciplines?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41480">The '''dialogical self''' is a [[psychological]] [[concept]] which describes the [[mind]]'s ability to imagine the different positions of [[wikt:participation|participant]]s in an internal [[dialogue]], in close connection with external dialogue. The "dialogical self" is the central concept in the dialogical self theory (DST), as created and developed by the Dutch psychologist [[Hubert Hermans]] since the 1990s.

== Overview ==
Dialogical Self Theory (DST) weaves two concepts, self and dialogue, together in such a way that a more profound understanding of the interconnection of [[Self (psychology)|self]] and [[society]] is achieved. Usually, the concept of self refers to something "internal," something that takes place within the mind of the individual [[person]], while dialogue is typically associated with something "external," that is, processes that take place between people involved in [[communication]].

The composite concept "dialogical self" goes beyond the self-other [[dichotomy]] by infusing the external to the internal and, in reverse, to introduce the internal into the external. As functioning as a "society of mind",&lt;ref&gt;Minsky, M. (1985). ''The Society of Mind''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; the self is populated by a [[:wikt:multiplicity|multiplicity]] of "self-positions" that have the possibility to entertain dialogical relationships with each other.

In Dialogical Self Theory (DST) the self is considered as "extended," that is, individuals and groups in the society at large are incorporated as positions in the mini-society of the self. As a result of this extension, the self does not only include internal positions (e.g., I as the son of my mother, I as a teacher, I as a lover of jazz), but also external positions (e.g., my father, my pupils, the groups to which I belong).

Given the basic assumption of the extended self, the other is not simply outside the self but rather an intrinsic part of it. There is not only the actual other outside the self, but also the imagined other who is entrenched as the other-in-the-self. An important theoretical implication is that basic processes, like self-conflicts, [[self-criticism]], self-agreements, and self-consultancy, are taking place in different domains in the self: within the internal domain (e.g., "As an enjoyer of life I disagree with myself as an ambitious worker"); between the internal and external (extended) domain (e.g., "I want to do this but the voice of my mother in myself criticizes me") and within the external domain (e.g., "The way my colleagues interact with each other has led me to decide for another job").

As these examples show, there is not always a sharp separation between the inside of the self and the outside world, but rather a gradual transition.&lt;ref name="MR79"&gt;Rosenberg, M. (1979). ''Conceiving the self''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; DST assumes that the self as a society of mind is populated by internal and external self-positions. When some positions in the self silence or suppress other positions, monological relationships prevail. When, in contrast, positions are recognized and accepted in their differences and alterity (both within and between the internal and external domains of the self), dialogical relationships emerge with the possibility to further develop and renew the self and the other as central parts of the society at large.&lt;ref&gt;Hermans, H., Hermans-Konopka, A. (2010). ''Dialogical Self Theory. Positioning And Counter-Positioning In A Globalizing Society''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2018}}
DST is inspired by two thinkers in particular, [[William James]] and [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], who worked in different countries (USA and Russia, respectively), in different disciplines ([[psychology]] and literary sciences), and in different theoretical traditions ([[pragmatism]] and [[dialogism]]).&lt;ref name="Herm2001"&gt;Hermans, H. (2001). The Dialogical Self: Toward a Theory of Personal and Cultural Positioning. ''Culture &amp; Psychology'', 2001, 7, 243-281&lt;/ref&gt; As the composite term dialogical self suggests, the present theory finds itself not exclusively in one of these traditions but explicitly at their intersection. As a theory about the self it is inspired by William James, as a theory about dialogue it elaborates on some insights of Mikhail Bakhtin. The purpose of the present theory is to profit from the insights of founding fathers like William James, [[George Herbert Mead]] and Mikhail Bakhtin and, at the same time, to go beyond them.

[[File:Wm james.jpg|thumb|[[William James]] (1890) proposed a distinction between the I and the Me.]]
William James (1890) proposed a distinction between the ''I'' and the ''Me'', which, according to Morris Rosenberg,&lt;ref name="MR79"/&gt; is a classic distinction in the psychology of the self. According to James the I is equated with the self-as-knower and has three features: continuity, distinctness, and [[Volition (psychology)|volition]].&lt;ref&gt;Damon, W., &amp; Hart, D. (1982). The development of self-understanding from infancy through adolescence. ''Child Development'', 4, 841-864.&lt;/ref&gt; The continuity of the self-as-knower is expressed in a sense of [[personal identity]], that is, a sense of sameness through time. A feeling of distinctness from others, or individuality, is also characteristic of the self-as-knower. Finally, a sense of personal volition is reflected in the continuous appropriation and rejection of thoughts by which the self-as-knower manifests itself as an active processor of experience.

Of particular relevance to DST is James's view that the ''Me'', equated with the self-as-known, is composed of the empirical elements considered as belonging to oneself. James was aware that there is a gradual transition between ''Me'' and ''mine'' and concluded that the empirical self is composed of all that the person can call his or her own, "not only his body and his psychic powers, but his clothes and his house, his wife and children, his ancestors and friends, his reputation and works, his lands and horses, and yacht and bank-account".&lt;ref&gt;James, W. (1890). ''The principles of psychology'' (Vol. 1). London: Macmillan, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, people and things in the environment belong to the self, as far as they are felt as "mine". This means that not only "my mother" belongs to the self but even "my enemy". In this way, James proposed a view in which the self is 'extended' to the environment. This proposal contrasts with a [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] view of the self which is based on a [[Mind-body dualism|dualistic]] conception, not only between [[Self (psychology)|self]] and [[Human body|body]] but also between self and other. With his conception of the extended self, that defined as going beyond the skin, James has paved the way for later theoretical developments in which other people and groups, defined as "mine" are part of a dynamic multi-voiced self.

[[File:Mikhail bakhtin.jpg|thumb|Mikhail Bakhtin (1920)]]
In the above quotation from William James, we see a constellation of characters (or self-positions) which he sees as belonging to the ''Me/mine'': my wife and children, my ancestors and friends. Such characters are more explicitly elaborated in Mikhail Bakhtin's&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, M. (1973). ''Problems of Dostoevsky's poetics'' (2nd edn.; R. W. Rotsel, Trans.). Ann Arbor, MI: Ardis. (Original work published 1929 as Problemy tvorchestva Dostoevskogo [Problems of Dostoevsky's Art]).&lt;/ref&gt; metaphor of the polyphonic novel, which became a source of inspiration for later dialogical approaches to the self. In proposing this metaphor, he draws on the idea that in [[Dostoevsky]]'s works there is not a single author at work—Dostoevsky himself—but several authors or thinkers, portrayed as characters such as [[Ivan Karamazov]], [[Prince Myshkin|Myshkin]], [[Raskolnikov]], [[Stavrogin]], and the [[Grand Inquisitor]].

These characters are not presented as obedient slaves in the service of one author-thinker, Dostoevsky, but treated as independent thinkers, each with their own view of the world. Each hero is put forward as the author of his own ideology, and not as the object of Dostoevsky's finalizing artistic vision. Rather than a multiplicity of characters within a unified world, there is a plurality of consciousnesses located in different worlds. As in a polyphonic musical composition, multiple voices accompany and oppose one another in dialogical ways. In bringing together different characters in a polyphonic construction, Dostoevsky creates a multiplicity of perspectives, portraying characters conversing with the [[Devil]] (Ivan and the Devil), with their [[alter ego]]s (Ivan and Smerdyakov), and even with caricatures of themselves (Raskolnikov and Svidrigailov).

Inspired by the original ideas of William James and Mikhail Bakhtin, [[Hubert Hermans]], [[Harry Kempen]] and Rens van Loon&lt;ref name="HKL92"&gt;Hermans, H. J. M., Kempen, H. J. G., &amp; Van Loon, R. J. P. (1992). The dialogical self: Beyond individualism and rationalism. ''American Psychologist'', 47, 23–33.&lt;/ref&gt;  wrote the first psychological publication on the "dialogical self" in which they conceptualized the self in terms of a dynamic multiplicity of relatively autonomous ''I''-positions in the (extended) landscape of the mind. In this conception, the ''I'' has the possibility to move from one spatial position to another in accordance with changes in situation and time. The ''I'' fluctuates among different and even opposed positions, and has the capacity to imaginatively endow each position with a voice so that dialogical relations between positions can be established. The voices function like interacting characters in a story, involved in processes of question and answer, agreement and disagreement. Each of them have a story to tell about their own experiences from their own stance. As different voices, these characters exchange information about their respective Me's and mines, resulting in a complex, narratively structured self.

== Construction of assessment and research procedures ==
[[File:Hubert Hermans.JPG|thumb|left|[[Hubert Hermans]] wrote the first psychological publication on the "dialogical self" in 1992.]]
The theory has led to the construction of different assessment and [[research]] procedures for investigating central aspects of the dialogical self. Hubert Hermans&lt;ref&gt;Hermans, H.J.M. (2001b). The construction of a personal position repertoire: Method and practice. ''Culture &amp; Psychology'', 7, 323-365.&lt;/ref&gt; has constructed the ''Personal Position Repertoire'' (PPR) method, an [[idiographic]] procedure for assessing the internal and external domains of the self in terms of an organized position repertoire.

This is done by offering the participant a list of internal and external self-positions. The participants mark those positions that they feel as relevant in their lives. They are allowed to add extra internal and external positions to the list and phrase them in their own terms. The relationship between internal and external positions is then established by inviting the participants to fill out a matrix with the rows representing the internal positions and the columns the external positions. In the entries of the matrix, the participant fills in, on a scale from 0 to 5 the extent to which an internal position is prominent in the relation to an external position. The scores in the matrix allow for the calculation of a number of indices, such as sum scores representing the overall prominence of particular internal or external positions and correlations showing the extent to which internal (or external) positions have similar profiles. On the basis of the results of the [[Mathematical psychology|quantitative analysis]], some positions can be selected, by the client or assessor, for closer examination.

From the selected positions the client can tell a story that reflects the specific experiences associated with that position and, moreover, assessor and client can explore which positions can be considered as a dialogical response to one or more other positions. In this way, the method combines both qualitative and quantitative analyses.

=== Psychometric aspects of the PPR method ===
The [[psychometric]] aspects of the PPR method was refined a procedure proposed by A. Kluger, Nir, &amp; Y. Kluger.&lt;ref&gt;Kluger, A., Nir, D., &amp; Kluger, Y. (2008). Personal position repertoire (PPR) from a bird's eye view. ''Journal of Constructivist Psychology'', 21, 223-238.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors analyze clients' Personal Position Repertoires by creating a [[bi-plot]] of the factors underlying their internal and external positions. A bi-plot provides a clear and comprehensible visual map of the relations between all the meaningful internal and external positions within the self in such a way that both types of positions are simultaneously visible. Through this procedure clusters of internal and external positions and dominant patterns can be easily observed and analyzed.

The method allows researchers or practitioners to study the general deep structures of the self. There are multiple bi-plots technologies available today. The simplest approach, however, is to perform a standard [[principal component analysis]] (PCA). To obtain a bi-plot, a PCA is once performed on the external positions and once on the internal positions, with the number of components in both PCA's restricted to two. Next, a scatter of the two PCAs is plotted on the same plane, where results of the first components are projected to the X-axis and of the second components to Y-axis. In this way, an overview of the organization of the internal and external positions together is realized.

=== The Personality Web assessment method ===
Another assessment method, the ''Personality Web'', is devised by Raggatt.&lt;ref name="LL08"/&gt; This semi-structured method starts from the assumption that the self is populated by a number of opposing narrative voices, with each voice having its own life story. Each voice competes with other voices for dominance in thought and action and each is constituted by a different set of affectively-charged attachments, to people, events, objects and one's own body.

The assessment comprises two phases— 
* In the first phase, 24 attachments are elicited in four categories: people, events, places and objects, and orientations to body parts. In an interview, the history and meaning of each attachment is explored.
* In the second phase, participants are invited to group their attachments by strength of association into [[cluster analysis]] and [[multidimensional scaling]] is used to map the individual's web of attachments.

This method represents a combination of [[qualitative property|qualitative]] and [[quantitative property|quantitative]] procedures that provide insight in the content and organization of a multi-voiced self.

=== Self-Confrontation Method ===
Dialogical relationships are also studied with an adapted version of the ''Self-Confrontation Method'' (SCM).&lt;ref&gt;Hermans, H.J.M., &amp; Hermans-Jansen, E. (1995). ''Self-narratives: The Construction of meaning in psychotherapy''. New York: Guilford. {{ISBN|0-89862-878-4}}. [Polish transl. by P. Oles, 2000, {{ISBN|83-88242-55-5}}.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Take the following example. A client, Mary, reported that she sometimes experienced herself as a witch, eager to murder her husband, particularly when he was drunk. She did a self-investigation in two parts, one from her ordinary position as Mary and another from the position of the witch. Then, she told from each of the positions a story about her past, present, and future. These stories were summarized in the form of a number of sentences. It appeared that Mary formulated sentences that were much more acceptable from a societal point of view than those from the witch. Mary formulated sentences like "I want to try to see what my mother gives me: there's only one of me" or "For the first time in my life, I'm engaged in making a home ("home" is also coming at home, entering into myself)", whereas the witch produced statements like "With my bland, pussycat qualities I have vulnerable things in hand, from which I derive power at a later moment (somebody tells me things that I can use so that I get what I want)" or "I enjoy when I have broken him [husband]: from a power position entering the battlefield."

It was found that the sentences of the two positions were very different in content, style, and affective meaning. Moreover, the relationship between Mary and the witch seemed to be more monological than dialogical, that is, either the one or the other was in control of the self and the situation and there was not no exchange between them. After the investigation, Mary received a therapeutic supervision during which she started to keep a diary in which she learned to make fine discriminations between her own experiences as Mary and those of the witch. She became not only aware of the needs of the witch but learned also to give an adequate response as soon as she noticed that the energy of the witch was upcoming. In a second investigation, one year later, the intensely conflicting relationship between Mary and the witch was significantly reduced and, as a result, there was less tension and stress in the self. She reported that in some situations, she even could make good use of the energy of the witch (e.g., when applying for a job). Whereas in some situations she was in control of the witch, in other situations she could even cooperate with her. The changes that took place between investigation 1 and investigation 2 suggested that the initial monological relationship between the two positions changed clearly into a more dialogical direction.

=== The Initial Questionnaire method ===
Under the supervision of the Polish psychologist Piotr Oleś, a group of researchers&lt;ref name="PTFR00"/&gt; constructed a [[questionnaire]] method, called the ''Initial Questionnaire'', for the measurement of three types of "internal activity" (a) change of perspective, (b) [[internal monologue]] and (c) internal dialogue. The purpose of this questionnaire is to induce the subject's self-reflection and determine which ''I''-positions are reflected by the participant's interlocutors and which of them give new and different points of view to the [[person]].

The method includes a list of potential positions. The participants are invited to choose some of them and can add their own to the list. The selected positions, both internal and external ones, are then assessed as belonging to the dialogue, monologue of perspective categories. Such a questionnaire is well-suited for the investigation of [[correlation]]s with other questionnaires.

For example, correlating the Initial Questionnaire with the [[Revised NEO Personality Inventory]] (NEO PI-R), the researchers found that persons having inner dialogues scored significantly lower on Assertiveness and higher on Self-Consciousness, Fantasy, Aesthetics, Feelings and Openness than people having internal monologues. They concluded that "people entering into imaginary dialogues in comparison with ones having mainly monologues are characterized by a more vivid and creative imagination (Fantasy), a deep appreciation of art and beauty (Aesthetics) and receptivity to inner feelings and emotions (Feelings). They are curious about both inner and outer worlds and their lives are experientially richer. They are willing to entertain novel ideas and unconventional values and they experience positive as well as negative emotions more keenly (Openness). At the same time these persons are more disturbed by awkward social situations, uncomfortable around others, sensitive to ridicule, and prone to feelings of inferiority (Self-Consciousness), they prefer to stay in the background and let others do the talking (Assertiveness)".&lt;ref name="PTFR00"/&gt;

=== Other methods ===
Other methods are developed in fields related to DST. Based on Stiles' assimilation model,&lt;ref&gt;Stiles, W. B. (1999). Signs and voices in psychotherapy. ''Psychotherapy Research'', 9, 1–21. Theory &amp; Psychology (2002), Special issue on the dialogical self, 12, 147-280.&lt;/ref&gt; "Osatuke et al.", describes a method that enables the researcher to compare what is said by a client (verbal content) and how it is said (speech sounds).&lt;ref&gt;Osatuke, K., Gray, M.A., Glick, M.J., Stiles, W.B., &amp; Barkham, M. (2004). Hearing voices: Metholodological issues in measuring internal multiplicity. In H. J. M. Hermans &amp; G. Dimaggio (Eds.), ''The dialogical self in psychotherapy'' (pp. 237-254). London: Brunner-Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; With this method the authors are able to assess to what extent the vocal manifestations (how it is said) of different internal voices of the same client parallel, contradict or complement their written manifestations (what is said). This method can be used to study the non-verbal characteristics of different voices in the self in connection with verbal content.

=== Dialogical sequence analysis ===
On the basis of Mikhail Bakhtin's theory of utterances, Leiman&lt;ref&gt;Leiman, M. (2004). Dialogical sequence analysis. In: H. J. M. Hermans &amp; G. Dimaggio (eds.), ''The dialogical self in psychotherapy'' (pp. 255–270). London: Brunner-Routledge.
&lt;/ref&gt; devised a ''dialogical sequence analysis.'' This method starts from the assumption that every utterance has an addressee. The central question is: To whom is the person speaking?

Usually, we think of one listener as the immediately observable addressee. However, the addressee is rather a multiplicity of others, a complex web of invisible others, whose presence can be traced in the content, flow and expressive elements of the utterance (e.g., I'm directly addressing you but while speaking I'm protesting to a third person who is invisibly present in the conversation). When there are more than one addressees present in the conversation, the utterance positions the author/speaker into more (metaphorical) locations. Usually, these locations form sequences, that can be examined and made explicit when one listens carefully not only to the content but also the expressive elements in the conversation. Leiman's method, which analyzes a conversation in terms of "chains of dialogical patterns", is theory-guided, qualitative and sensitive to the verbal and the non-verbal aspects of utterances.

== Fields of application ==
It is not the main purpose of the presented [[theory]] to formulate testable [[hypotheses]], but to generate new [[idea]]s. It is certainly possible to perform theory-guided [[research]] on the basis of the theory, as exemplified by a special issue on dialogical self research in the ''Journal of Constructivist Psychology'' (2008)&lt;ref name="informaworld.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~db=all~content=g793519042|title=Journal of Constructivist Psychology: Vol 21, No 3|website=www.informaworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in other publications (further on in the present section). Yet, the primary purpose is the generation of new ideas that lead to continued theory, research, and practice on the basis of links between the central concepts of the theory.

Theoretical advances, empirical research, and practical applications are discussed in the ''International Journal for Dialogical Science''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ijds.lemoyne.edu/index.html|title=International Journal for Dialogical Science|website=ijds.lemoyne.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the biennial ''International Conferences on the Dialogical Self'' as they are held in different countries and continents: [[Nijmegen]], [[Netherlands]] (2000), [[Ghent]], Belgium (2002), [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]] (2004), [[Braga]], [[Portugal]] (2006), [[Cambridge]], United Kingdom (2008), [[Athens]], [[Greece]] (2010), [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], United States (2012), and [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] (2014).The aim of the journal and the conferences is to  transcend the boundaries of (sub)disciplines, countries, and continents and create fertile interfaces where theorists, researchers and practitioners meet in order to engage in innovative dialogue.

Fields of applications are also reflected by several special issues that appeared in psychological journals. In ''Culture &amp; Psychology'' (2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cap.sagepub.com/|title=Culture &amp; Psychology: SAGE Journals|website=cap.sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; DST, as a theory of personal and cultural positioning, was exposed and commented on by researchers from different cultures. In ''Theory &amp; Psychology'' (2002),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tap.sagepub.com/content/vol12/issue2/|title=Theory &amp; Psychology - Volume 12, Number 2, Apr 01, 2002|website=tap.sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the potential contribution of the theory for a variety of fields was discussed: developmental psychology, personality psychology, psychotherapy, psychopathology, brain sciences, cultural psychology, Jungian psychoanalysis, and [[semiotic]] dialogism. A second issue of this journal published in 2010 was also devoted to DST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tap.sagepub.com/content/20/3/|title=Theory &amp; Psychology - Volume 20, Number 3, Jun 01, 2010|website=tap.sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Journal of Constructivist Psychology'' (2003) researchers and practitioners focused on the implications of the dialogical self for personal construct psychology, on the [[philosophy]] of [[Martin Buber]], on the rewriting of [[narrative]]s in psychotherapy, and on a psycho-dramatic approach in psychotherapy. The topic of mediated dialogue in a global and digital age was at the heart of a special issue in ''Identity: An International Journal of Theory and Research'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssc.uwo.ca/sociology/identity/|title=''Identity: An International Journal of Theory and Research'' (2004)|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131073327/http://www.ssc.uwo.ca/sociology/identity/|archivedate=2009-01-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Counselling Psychology Quarterly'' (2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/ccpq/2006/00000019/00000001;jsessionid=52agw1b0alg29.alice|title=Counselling Psychology Quarterly: Ingenta Connect Table Of Contents|website=www.ingentaconnect.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the dialogical self was applied to a variety of topics, such as, the relationship between adult attachment and working models of [[emotion]], [[paranoid personality disorder]], narrative impoverishment in [[schizophrenia]], and the significance of social power in psychotherapy. In the ''Journal of Constructivist Psychology'' (2008)&lt;ref name="informaworld.com"/&gt; and in ''Studia Psychologica''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wydawnictwo.uksw.edu.pl/sklep/?p=productsMore&amp;iProduct=605&amp;sName=studia-psychologica-8-2008 ''Studia Psychologica'' (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; (2008), groups of researchers addressed the question of how empirical research can be performed on the basis of DST. The relevance of the dialogical self to developmental psychology was discussed in a special issue of ''New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development'' (2012). The application of the dialogical self in educational settings was presented in a special issue of the ''Journal of Constructivist Psychology'' (2013).

== Evaluation ==
Since its first inception in 1992, DST is discussed and evaluated, particularly at the biennial ''International Conferences on the Dialogical Self'' and in the ''International Journal for Dialogical Science''. Some of the main positive evaluations and main criticisms are summarized here. On the positive side, many researchers appreciate the breadth and the integrative character of the theory. As the above review of applications demonstrates, there is a broad range of fields in psychology and other disciplines in which the theory has received interests from thinkers, researchers and practitioners. The breadth of interest is also reflected by the range of [[scientific]] journals that have devoted special issues to the theory and its implications.

The theory has the potential to bring together scientists and practitioners from a variety of countries, continents and cultures. The ''Fifth International Conference on the Dialogical Self'' in Cambridge, United Kingdom attracted 300 participants from 43 countries.  The conference focused primarily on DST, and dialogism as a related field. However, by focusing on dialogue, dialogical self goes beyond the [[post-modernism]] idea of the decentralization of the self and the notion of fragmentation. Recent work by John Rowan has resulted in the publication of a book by him entitled - 'Personification: Using the Dialogical Self in Psychotherapy and Counselling' published by Routledge. The book shows how to apply the concepts by those working in the therapeutic field.

=== Criticism ===
The theory and its applications have also received several [[criticism]]. Many researchers have noted a discrepancy between theory and research. Certainly, more than most post-modernist approaches, the theory has instigated a variety of empirical studies and some of its main tenets are confirmed in experimental social-psychological research.&lt;ref name="SZWG06"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stemplewska-Zakowicz, K., Walecka, J., Gabinska, A., Zalewski, B., &amp; Zuszek, H. (2005). Experiments on positioning, positioning the experiments. In P. Oles &amp; H. J. M. Hermans (Eds.), ''The dialogical self: Theory and research'' (pp. 183–199). Lublin, Poland: Wydawnictwo KUL.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the gap between theory and research still exists.

Closely related to this gap, there is the lack of connection between dialogical self research and mainstream psychology. Although the theory and its applications have been published in mainstream journals like ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]'' and the ''[[American Psychologist]]'', it has not yet led to the adoption of the theory as a significant development in mainstream (American) [[psychology]]. Apart from the theory-research gap, one of the additional reasons for the lacking connection with mainstream research may be the fact that interest in the notion of dialogue, central in the [[history of philosophy]] since [[Plato]], is largely neglected in psychology and other [[social sciences]]. Another disadvantage of the theory is that it lacks a research procedure that is sufficiently common to allow for the exchange of research data among investigators. Although different research tools have been developed (see the above review of assessment and research methods), none of them are used by a majority of researchers in the field.

Investigators often use different research tools which lead to a considerable richness of information but, at the same time, create a stumbling block for the comparison of research data. It seems that the breadth of the theory and the richness of its applications have a shadowy side in the relative isolation of research in the DST subfields. Other researchers find the scientific work done thus far to be of a too verbal nature. While the theory explicitly acknowledges the importance of pre-linguistic, non-linguistic forms of dialogue,&lt;ref name="JB02"/&gt; the actual research is typically taking place on the verbal level with the simultaneous neglect of the non-verbal level (for a notable exception cultural-anthropological research on shape-shifting).&lt;ref name="Gieser, T. 2006"/&gt; Finally, some researchers would like to see more emphasis on the bodily aspects of dialogue.  Up till now the theory has focused almost exclusively on the transcendence of the self-other dualism, as typical of the modern model of the self. More work should be done on the embodied nature of the dialogical self (for the role of the body in connection with emotions).&lt;ref&gt;Hermans, H.J.M., &amp; Hermans-Konopka, A. (2010).''Dialogical self theory: Positioning and counter-positioning in a globalizing society''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In statistics, a '''dual-flashlight plot''' is a type of scatter-plot in which the standardized mean ([[SMCV]]) is plotted against the mean of a [[contrast variable]] representing a comparison of interest
.&lt;ref name=ZhangPharmacogenomics2010&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zhang XHD
|title= Assessing the size of gene or RNAi effects in multifactor high-throughput experiments 
|journal=Pharmacogenomics |volume=11 |issue= 2|pages=199–213 
|year=2010 |month= |pmid= 20136359|doi=10.2217/PGS.09.136 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commonly used dual-flashlight plot is for the difference between two groups in high-throughput experiments such as [[microarray]]s and [[high-throughput screening]] studies, in which we plot the [[SSMD]] versus average log fold-change on the ''y''- and ''x''-axes, respectively, for all genes or compounds (such as [[siRNA]]s or [[small molecule]]s) investigated in an experiment.&lt;ref name="ZhangPharmacogenomics2010"/&gt;  
As a whole, the points in a dual-flashlight plot look like the beams of a flashlight with two heads, hence the name dual-flashlight plot.&lt;ref name="ZhangPharmacogenomics2010"/&gt;

With the dual-flashlight plot, we can see how the genes or compounds are distributed into each category in effect sizes, as shown in the figure. Meanwhile, we can also see the average fold-change for each gene or compound. The dual-flashlight plot is similar to the [[volcano plot (statistics)|volcano plot]]. In a [[volcano plot (statistics)|volcano plot]], the [[p-value]] (or q-value{{clarify|date=June 2012}}), instead of SMCV or SSMD, is plotted against average fold-change &lt;ref name=Jin2001&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jin W, Riley RM, Wolfinger RD, White KP, Passador-Gurgel G, Gibson G |title= The contributions of sex, genotype and age to transcriptional variance in Drosophila melanogaster

|year=2001 |month= |pmid= 11726925|doi= 10.1038/ng766  |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
.&lt;ref name=Cui2003&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cui X, Churchill GA |title=Statistical tests for differential expression in cDNA microarray experiments

.&lt;ref name=ZhangSBR2010&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zhang XHD

|year=2010 |month= |pmid= |doi=10.1198/sbr.2009.0074 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, the value of SMCV is comparable whereas the value of p-value or q-value is  not comparable in experiments with different sample size, especially when many investigated genes or compounds do not have exactly zero effects. The dual-flashlight plot bears the same advantage that the SMCV has, as compared to the [[volcano plot (statistics)|volcano plot]].

'''EMBRACE''' ('''E'''lectronic '''M'''ulti'''B'''eam '''R'''adio '''A'''stronomy '''C'''onc'''E'''pt) is a prototype telescope for the phase 2 of the [[Square Kilometre Array]] (SKA) project. It's the first dense phased array for radioastronomy in the GHz frequency range (initially planned for covering the 0.5-1.5&amp;nbsp;GHz, mid-frequency band of SKA). It is composed of two sites, one at the [[Nançay radio telescope]] station in France, and one near the [[Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope]] antennas in Netherlands.

'''Ernst Friedrich Germar'''  (3 November 1786 – 8 July 1853) was a [[Germany|German]] professor and director of the [[Mineralogy|Mineralogical Museum]] at [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]]. As well as being a mineralogist he was interested in [[entomology]] and particularly in the [[Coleoptera]] and [[Hemiptera]]. He monographed the [[heteropteran]] family [[Scutelleridae]].

In 1845, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].
== Published works ==
Amongst Germar’s publications are:
*Species Cicadarium enumeratae et sub genera distributae. ''Thon's Entomologisches Archiv''. (2)2: 37-57, pl. 1 (1830).
*Observations sur plusieurs espèces du genre [[Cicada]], ''Latr. Rev. Entomol. Silbermann'' 2: 49-82, pls. 19-26 (1834).
*Ueber die Elateriden mit häutigen Anhängen der Tarsenglieder. Z. Entomol. (Germar) 1: 193-236 (1839) (1839).
*Bemerkungen über Elateriden. ''Z. Entomol. (Breslau)'' 5: 133-192 (1844).
*Beiträge zur insektenfauna von [[Adelaide]]. ''Linn. Entomol.'' 3: 153-247  (1848).
*Fauna Insectorum Europae. There were 24 fascicles in this work; [[August Ahrens]] producing the first two, Germar and [[Georg Friedrich Kaulfuss]] the third (1817) and Germar alone the remaining 21.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/fauna-insectorum-europae/oclc/63604132 Fauna insectorum Europae] OCLC WorldCat&lt;/ref&gt;
He was also editor of the entomological journal ''Zeitschrift für die Entomologie'', which was published from 1839 to 1844.

'''''Famine 1975! America's Decision: Who Will Survive?''''' is a best-selling&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt; 1967 book by William and Paul Paddock. The brothers describe the rapidly [[Human overpopulation|growing population]] of the world, and a situation in which they believe it would be impossible to feed the entire global population within the short-term future. They believed that widespread [[famine]] would be the inevitable result, by 1975.

The basic argument of the book is summarized in a 1969 review by Bruce Trumbo:&lt;ref name="Trumbo"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Trumbo, Bruce E. |title=A Matter of Fertility |date=Winter 1969 |pages=59–63 |journal=Spectrum |url=http://spectrummagazine.org/files/archive/archive01-05/1-1trumbo.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728044440/http://spectrummagazine.org/files/archive/archive01-05/1-1trumbo.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The underdeveloped nations have exploding populations and static agricultures.
# The "Time of Famines" will be seriously in evidence by 1975, when food crises will have been reached in several of these nations.
# The "stricken peoples will not be able to pay for all their needed food imports. Therefore the hunger in these regions can be alleviated only through the charity of other nations" (p.&amp;nbsp;205)
# The only important food in famine relief will be wheat, and only the United States, Canada, Australia, and Argentina grow significant amounts of wheat.
# The United States, the only one of these four countries that has historically given wheat to hungry nations, is the "sole hope of the hungry nations" in the future (p.&amp;nbsp;206)
# "Yet the United States, even if it fully cultivates all its land, even if it opens every spigot of charity, will not have enough wheat and other foodstuffs to keep alive all the starving" (p.&amp;nbsp;206)
# "Therefore, the United States must decide to which countries it will send food, to which countries it will not."&lt;ref name="Trumbo" /&gt;

In response, they suggest a system of [[triage]] in which the United States must "divide the underdeveloped nations into three categories: 1) Those so hopelessly headed for or in the grip of famine (whether because of overpopulation, agricultural insufficiency, or political ineptness) that our aid will be a waste; these "can't-be-saved nations" will be ignored and left to their fate; 2) Those who are suffering but who will stagger through without our aid, "the walking wounded"; and 3) Those who can be saved by our help."&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dan Gardner: The nation-killing famine that never was |publisher=National Post |author=Gardner, Dan |date=October 13, 2010 |url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2010/10/13/dan-gardner-the-nation-killing-famine-that-never-was/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20101013131843/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2010/10/13/dan-gardner-the-nation-killing-famine-that-never-was/ |archivedate=2010-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=JASA Book Reviews for December 1968 |journal=Journal of the American Scientific Affiliation |url=http://www.asa3.org/ASA/BookReviews1949-1989/12-68.html |author=Sire, James W.  |date=December 1968 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paddocks were  aware that their policy of abandoning [[food aid]] to the "hopeless countries" (India and Egypt for example) would lead to an immediate worsening of the situation there, but they wrote "to send food is to throw sand in the ocean." Using the triage system they hoped to avoid a broader catastrophe and stabilize the global population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Future Babble: Why Expert Predictions Fail – and Why We Believe Them Anyway |author=Dan Gardner |publisher=McClelland and Stewart |year=2010 |location=Toronto |page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul R. Ehrlich]], who wrote bestseller ''[[The Population Bomb]]'' along similar lines the following year, lavishly praised the book, calling it courageous for daring to address the problems of the age in a concrete way, and one of the most important books of our age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ehrlich, Paul R. |title=The Population Bomb |publisher=Ballantine Books |year=1968 |page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others criticized the use of extrapolated, and sometimes incorrect, statistics and assumptions to make such drastic and consequential conclusions.&lt;ref name="Trumbo" /&gt; The book is often cited as a classic example of the [[neo-Malthusian]] revival of the 1950s-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;See for example:{{cite book |author=Chase, A. |year=1977 |title=The Legacy of Malthus: The Social Costs of the New Scientific Racism |place=New York |publisher=Knopf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument of the book proved false.  Through policies of public food distribution and work-for-food programs, as well as the use of technology and hybrid seeds to increase food production - the [[Green Revolution]] - the situation changed drastically over the final decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;

The '''Gamma Ray Spectrometer''' (GRS) is a [[gamma-ray spectrometer]] on the ''[[2001 Mars Odyssey]]'' spacecraft, a space probe orbiting the planet [[Mars]] since 2001. Part of [[NASA]]'s [[Mars Surveyor 2001]] program, it returns geological data about Mars's surface such as identifying elements and the location of water. It is maintained by the [[Lunar and Planetary Laboratory]] at the [[University of Arizona]] in the United States.  This instrument has mapped the distribution surface [[hydrogen]], thought to trace water in the surface layer of [[Martian soil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grs.lpl.arizona.edu/latestresults.jsp |title=Gamma Ray Spectrometer : Latest Results |date=January 2008 |publisher=[[Lunar and Planetary Laboratory]], [[University of Arizona]] |accessdate=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gareth Vaughan Williams''' (born 1965,&lt;ref name="springer-Graff" /&gt; in [[Windlesham]],&lt;ref name="Williams-Personal-Webpage" /&gt; England) is an English-American [[astronomer]], who is the associate director of the [[International Astronomical Union]]'s [[Minor Planet Center]] (MPC).&lt;ref name="springer-Graff" /&gt; 

== Career ==

He joined the MPC in January 1990, and as such is the longest-serving staff member presently there. He is an IAU member and is the MPC representative on various IAU committees and working groups, including the ''Working Group on Planetary System Nomenclature'' and is secretary of the ''Working Group on Small Body Nomenclature.'' Gareth got his undergraduate degree in astronomy at [[University College London]], and his PhD in 2013 from the [[Open University]]. He is known for recovering the lost asteroids [[878 Mildred]] in 1991 and [[719 Albert]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="MPC-about" /&gt;

He also identified the earliest known observation of a [[Jupiter trojan]], when he linked A904 RD, an object seen on only a single night by [[Edward Emerson Barnard|E. E. Barnard]], with {{LoMP|12126|{{mp|(12126) 1999 RM|11}}}}.&lt;ref name="MPC-pressinfo-Trojan" /&gt; Barnard's observations, which he initially believed belonged to [[Phoebe (moon)|Saturn IX (Phoebe)]], were sufficient to show that the object was distant, but he did not follow it up. The first Jupiter Trojan to be recognized as such, [[588 Achilles]], was discovered in 1906.&lt;ref name=recoveries&gt;{{cite web|title=The best off - Gareth Williams|url=http://www.astro.hr/gwilliams/The_best_off/the_best_off.html|website=astro.hr |accessdate=2 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403161441/http://www.astro.hr/gwilliams/The_best_off/the_best_off.html |archivedate=3 April 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and honors ==

Minor planet [[3202 Graff]], a [[Hilda family|Hilda]] asteroid discovered by [[Max Wolf]] at [[Heidelberg Observatory|Heidelberg]] in 1908, was named in his honor on 10 April 1990 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 16245}}).&lt;ref name="springer-Graff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18934">'''Geochemical modeling''' is the practice of using [[chemical thermodynamics]], [[chemical kinetics]], or both, to analyze the [[chemical reactions]] that affect [[Geology|geologic systems]], commonly with the aid of a computer. It is used in high-temperature [[geochemistry]] to simulate reactions occurring deep in the Earth's interior, in [[magma]], for instance, or to model low-temperature reactions in [[aqueous solutions]] near the Earth's surface, the subject of this article.

== Applications to aqueous systems ==
Geochemical modeling is used in a variety of fields, including environmental [[Environmental protection|protection]] and [[Environmental remediation|remediation]],&lt;ref&gt;Zhu, C. and G. Anderson, 2002, ''Environmental Applications of Geochemical Modeling''. Cambridge University Press, 300 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[petroleum industry]], and [[economic geology]].&lt;ref name = "GBRM"&gt;Bethke, C.M., 2008, ''Geochemical and Biogeochemical Reaction Modeling''. Cambridge University Press, 547 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Models can be constructed, for example, to understand the composition of natural waters; the mobility and breakdown of [[Pollution|contaminants]] in flowing [[groundwater]] or [[surface water]]; the formation and dissolution of rocks and [[minerals]] in geologic formations in response to injection of industrial wastes, steam, or [[Carbon sequestration|carbon dioxide]]; and the generation of [[Acid mine drainage|acidic waters]] and leaching of metals from mine wastes.

== Development of geochemical modeling ==
[[Robert Garrels|Garrels]] and Thompson (1962) first applied chemical modeling to geochemistry in 25&amp;nbsp;°C and one atmosphere total pressure.  Their calculation, computed by hand, is now known as an ''equilibrium model'', which predicts species distributions, mineral saturation states, and gas fugacities from measurements of bulk solution composition. By removing small aliquots of [[solvent]] water from an equilibrated spring water and repeatedly recalculating the species distribution, Garrels and Mackenzie (1967) simulated the reactions that occur as spring water evaporated.&lt;ref&gt;Garrels, R.M. and F.T. Mackenzie, 1967, Origin of the chemical compositions of some springs and lakes. ''Equilibrium Concepts in Natural Waters, Advances in Chemistry Series'' '''67''', American Chemical Society, Washington, DC, pp. 222-242&lt;/ref&gt; This coupling of mass transfer with an equilibrium model, known as a ''reaction path model'', enabled geochemists to simulate reaction processes.

[[Harold C. Helgeson|Helgeson]] (1968) introduced the first computer program to solve equilibrium and reaction path models,&lt;ref&gt;Helgeson, H.C., 1968, Evaluation of irreversible reactions in geochemical processes involving minerals and aqueous solutions, I. Thermodynamic relations. ''Geochemica et Cosmochimica Acta'' '''32''', 853-877&lt;/ref&gt; which he and coworkers used to model geological processes like [[weathering]], sediment [[diagenesis]], [[evaporation]], [[hydrothermal alteration]], and [[Ore genesis|ore deposition]].&lt;ref&gt;Helgeson, H.C., R.M. Garrels and F.T. Mackenzie, 1969, Evaluation of irreversible reactions in geochemical processes involving minerals and aqueous solutions, II. Applications. ''Geochemica et Cosmochimica Acta'' '''33''', 455-481&lt;/ref&gt; Later developments in geochemical modeling included reformulating the governing equations, first as [[ordinary differential equations]], then later as [[algebraic equations]]. Additionally, [[Component (thermodynamics)|chemical components]] came to be represented in models by aqueous species, minerals, and gases, rather than by the elements and electrons which make up the species, simplifying the governing equations and their numerical solution.&lt;ref name="GBRM" /&gt;

Recent improvements in the power of personal computers and [[#Software programs in common use|modeling software]] have made geochemical models more accessible and more flexible in their implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Zhu, C., 2009, Geochemical Modeling of Reaction Paths and Geochemical Reaction Networks. In E.H. Oelkers and J. Schott(eds.), 2009, Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Water-Rock Interaction. ''Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry'' '''70''', 533-569&lt;/ref&gt; Geochemists are now able to construct on their laptops complex reaction path or [[Reactive transport modeling in porous media|reactive transport models]] which previously would have required a supercomputer.&lt;ref&gt;Brady, P.V. and C.M. Bethke, 2000, Beyond the Kd approach. ''Ground Water'' '''38''', 321-322&lt;/ref&gt;

== Setting up a geochemical model ==
An aqueous system is uniquely defined by its chemical composition, [[temperature]], and [[pressure]].&lt;ref name = "Anderson"&gt;Anderson, G.M. 2009, ''Thermodynamics of Natural Systems''. Cambridge University Press, 664 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  Creating geochemical models of such systems begins by choosing the basis, the set of [[Chemical species|aqueous species]], [[minerals]], and [[gases]] which are used to write chemical reactions and express composition. The number of basis entries required equals the number of [[Component (thermodynamics)|components]] in the system, which is fixed by the [[Gibbs' phase rule|phase rule]] of thermodynamics. Typically, the basis is composed of water, each mineral in equilibrium with the system, each gas at known [[fugacity]], and important aqueous species. Once the basis is defined, a modeler can solve for the [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium state]], which is described by [[Law of mass action|mass action]] and mass balance equations for each component.&lt;ref name="GBRM" /&gt;

In finding the equilibrium state, a geochemical modeler solves for the distribution of mass of all species, minerals, and gases which can be formed from the basis. This includes the [[Activity (chemistry)|activity]], [[activity coefficient]], and [[concentration]] of aqueous species, the [[saturation (chemistry)|saturation]] state of minerals, and the fugacity of gases. Minerals with a saturation index (log Q/K) equal to zero are said to be in equilibrium with the fluid. Those with positive saturation indices are termed [[supersaturation|supersaturated]], indicating they are favored to precipitate from solution. A mineral is undersaturated if its saturation index is negative, indicating that it is favored to dissolve.&lt;ref name = "Anderson" /&gt;

Geochemical modelers commonly create reaction path models to understand how systems respond to changes in composition, temperature, or pressure. By configuring the manner in which mass and heat transfer are specified (i.e., open or closed systems), models can be used to represent a variety of geochemical processes. Reaction paths can assume chemical equilibrium, or they can incorporate kinetic rate laws to calculate the timing of reactions. In order to predict the distribution in space and time of the chemical reactions that occur along a flowpath, geochemical models are increasingly being coupled with [[Groundwater model|hydrologic models]] of mass and heat transport to form [[Reactive transport modeling in porous media|reactive transport models]].&lt;ref name="GBRM" /&gt; Specialized geochemical modeling programs that are designed as cross-linkable re-entrant software objects enable construction of reactive transport models of any flow configuration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ChemPlugin.ORG|url=http://chemplugin.org/|publisher=Aqueous Solutions LLC|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of reactions ==
Geochemical models are capable of simulating many different types of [[Chemical reaction|reactions]]. Included among them are: 
*[[Acid-base reactions]]
*[[Coordination complex|Aqueous complexation]]
*Mineral [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] and [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]]
*Reduction and oxidation ([[redox]]) reactions, including those catalyzed by [[enzyme]]s, [[Reactions on surfaces|surfaces]], and [[microorganism]]s
*[[Adsorption|Sorption]], [[ion exchange]], and surface complexation
*Gas dissolution and [[Degasification|exsolution]]
*[[Stable isotope|Stable isotope fractionation]]
*[[Radioactive decay]]

Simple [[phase diagrams]] or plots are commonly used to illustrate such geochemical reactions. Eh-pH [[Pourbaix diagram|(Pourbaix)]] diagrams, for example, are a special type of activity diagram which represent acid-base and redox chemistry graphically.

== Uncertainties in geochemical modelling ==
Various sources can contribute to a range of simulation results. The range of the simulation results is defined as model uncertainty. One of the most important sources not possible to quantify is the conceptual model, which is developed and defined by the modeller. Further sources are the parameterization of the model regarding the hydraulic (only when simulating transport) and mineralogical properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dethlefsen|first=Frank|last2=Haase|first2=Christoph|last3=Ebert|first3=Markus|last4=Dahmke|first4=Andreas|date=2011-01-01|title=Effects of the variances of input parameters on water-mineral interactions during CO2 sequestration modeling|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187661021100590X|journal=Energy Procedia|series=10th International Conference on Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies|volume=4|pages=3770–3777|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2011.02.311}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parameters used for the geochemical simulations can also contribute to model uncertainty.

Reducing uncertainties can be achieved by comparison of simulation results with experimental data, although experimental data does not exist at every temperature-pressure condition and for every chemical system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although such a comparison or calibration can not be conducted consequently the geochemical codes and thermodynamic databases are state-of-the-art and the most useful tools for predicting geochemical processes.

}}The term '''''choice theory''''' is the work of [[William Glasser]], [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], author of the book so named, and is the culmination of some 50 years of theory and practice in [[psychology]] and [[counselling]].

==Characteristics==
Choice theory posits behaviours we choose are central to our existence. Our behaviour ([[choice]]s) are driven by five genetically driven needs, survival, love and belonging, freedom, fun, and power.
Survival needs include
* food
* clothing
* shelter
* breathing
* personal safety
* security and sex, having children
and four fundamental psychological needs:
* Belonging/connecting/[[love]]
* [[Power (sociology)|Power]]/significance/competence
* [[Liberty|Freedom]]/autonomy
* Fun/learning

Choice theory suggests the existence of a "Quality World". Glasser's idea of a "Quality World" restates the [[Jungian archetypes|Jungian idea of archetypes]] but Glasser never acknowledged this. Nonetheless, Glasser's "Quality World" and what [[Carl Jung|Jung]] would call healthy archetypes are indistinguishable.

Our "Quality World" images are our role models of an individual's "perfect" world of parents, relations, possessions, beliefs, etc. How each person's "Quality World" is somewhat unusual, even in the same family of origin, is taken for granted.

Starting from birth and continuing throughout our lives, each person places significant role models, significant possessions and significant systems of belief (religion, cultural values, and [[icon]]s, etc.) into a mostly unconscious framework Glasser called our "Quality World". Glasser mostly ignores the issues of negative role models and stereotypes in choice theory.

Glasser also posits a "Comparing Place" where we compare-contrast our perception of people, places, and things immediately in front of us against our ideal images (archetypes) of these in our Quality World framework. Our subconscious pushes us towards calibrating—as best we can—our real world experience with our Quality World (archetypes).

Behavior ("Total Behavior" in Glasser's terms) is made up of these four components:  [[acting]], [[thinking]], [[feeling]], and [[physiology]]. Glasser suggests we have considerable control or choice over the first two of these; yet, little ability to directly choose the latter two as they are more deeply sub- and unconscious. These four components remain closely intertwined, the choices we make in our thinking and acting greatly affect our feeling and physiology.

A big conclusion for Glasser, one he repeats often, is the source of much personal unhappiness is failing or failed [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] with people important to us: spouses, parents, [[children]], friends and [[colleague]]s.

The symptoms of unhappiness are widely variable and are often seen as [[mental illness]]. Glasser believed that "pleasure" and "happiness" are related but are far from synonymous. [[Sex]], for example, is a "pleasure" but may well be divorced from a "satisfactory relationship" which is a precondition for lasting "[[happiness]]" in [[life]]. Hence the intense focus on the improvement of relationships in counseling with choice theory—the "new reality therapy". Those familiar with both are likely to prefer choice theory, the more modern formulation.

Choice theory posits most mental illness is, in fact, an expression of unhappiness. Glasser champions how we are able to learn and choose alternate behaviors resulting in greater personal satisfaction. [[Reality therapy]] is the choice theory-based counseling process focused on helping clients to learn to make those self-optimizing choices.

==The ten axioms==

# The only person whose behavior we can control is our own.&lt;br /&gt;
# All we can give another person is information.&lt;br /&gt;
# All long-lasting psychological problems are relationship problems.&lt;br /&gt;
# The problem relationship is always part of our present life.&lt;br /&gt;
# What happened in the past has everything to do with what we are today, but we can only satisfy our basic needs right now and plan to continue satisfying them in the future.&lt;br /&gt;
# We can only satisfy our needs by satisfying the pictures in our Quality World.&lt;br /&gt;
# All we do is behave.&lt;br /&gt;
# All behavior is Total Behavior and is made up of four components: acting, thinking, feeling and physiology&lt;br /&gt;
# All Total Behavior is chosen, but we only have direct control over the acting and thinking components. We can only control our feeling and physiology indirectly through how we choose to act and think.&lt;br /&gt;
# All Total Behavior is designated by verbs and named by the part that is the most recognizable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.choicetheory.com | title=Choice Theory Psychology, Reality Therapy, Lead Management, &amp; Quality Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In classroom management ==
William Glasser's choice theory begins:  behavior is not separate from choice; we all choose how to behave at any time. Second, we cannot control anyone's behavior but our own. Glasser also believed in the vitality of classroom meetings for the purpose of improving communication and solving real classroom problems. In the classroom, it is important for teachers to "help students envision a quality existence in school and plan the choices that lead to it".&lt;ref name="Charles, C.M. 2008"&gt;Charles, C.M. (2008). ''Building Classroom Discipline.'' (9th ed.). Boston: Pearson Education.
&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Johnny Waits is an 18-year-old high school senior and plans on attending college to become a computer programmer. Glasser suggests Johnny could be learning as much as he can about computers instead of reading Plato. This concept is called quality curriculum, which connects students with practical real world topics, chosen by the student according to their leanings. Topics with actual career potential are most encouraged. Under Glasser's strategy, teachers hold discussions with students when introducing new topics asking them to identify what they would like to explore in depth. As part of the process, students need to explain why the material is valuable in life.&lt;ref name="Charles, C.M. 2008"/&gt;

==Education==

Glasser was no supporter of [[Summerhill School|Summerhill]]. Most Quality Schools he supervised had very conventional curriculum topics. The main innovation was a deeper, humanistic approach to group process between teacher, student and learning.

A typical example of choice theory and education are [[Sudbury school|Sudbury Model schools]], where students decide for themselves how to spend their days. In these schools, students of all ages determine what they will do, as well as when, how, and where they will do it. This freedom is at the heart of the school and it belongs to the students as their right, not to be violated. The fundamental premises of the school are: that all people are curious by nature; that the most efficient, long-lasting, and profound learning takes place when started and pursued by the learner; that all people are creative if they are allowed to develop their unique talents; that age-mixing among students promotes growth in all members of the group; and that freedom is essential to the development of personal responsibility. In practice this means that students initiate all their own activities and create their own environments. The physical plant, the staff, and the equipment are there for the students to use as the need arises. The school provides a setting in which students are independent, are trusted, and are treated as responsible people; and a community in which students are exposed to the complexities of life in the framework of a participatory democracy.

Sudbury schools are based on the premise that students are personally responsible for their acts, in opposition to virtually all schools today that deny it. The denial is threefold: schools do not permit students to choose their course of action fully; they do not permit students to embark on the course, once chosen; and they do not permit students to suffer the consequences of the course, once taken. Freedom of choice, freedom of action, freedom to bear the results of action—these are the three great freedoms that constitute personal responsibility. Thus, members of these schools learn democracy by experience, and enjoy the rights of individuals.

Sudbury schools do not perform and do not offer evaluations, assessments, or recommendations, asserting that they do not rate people, and that school is not a judge; comparing students to each other, or to some standard that has been set is for them a violation of the student's right to privacy and to self-determination. Students decide for themselves how to measure their progress as self-starting learners as a process of self-evaluation: real lifelong learning and the proper educational evaluation for the 21st Century, they adduce.

== Critiques ==

Glasser's theories and teachings have not gone without criticism. In a book review,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychiatrist.com/pcc/pccpdf/v07n02/v07n0208.pdf Review of ''Warning: Psychiatry Can Be Hazardous to Your Mental Health''], Jackson, W. Clay.  2005. The Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, Vol. 7, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; W. Clay Jackson writes, "Dr. Glasser postulates that everything contained in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#DSM-IV-TR .282000.29|DSM-IV-TR]] is a result of an individual's brain creatively expressing its unhappiness. ... Dr. Glasser demonizes the entire profession as charlatans who have been brainwashed by their predecessors or who simply misrepresent many of the psychiatric illnesses to patients as having a biological basis. ... Despite claiming to have an appendix full of references demonstrating there is no evidence medications have a role in curing mental illness, the book simply relies on a core group of anti-establishment authors. ... However, what is noticeably absent from the book is a set of randomized clinical trials demonstrating the success of his teachings."

In [[sociology]], a '''group action''' is a situation in which a number of [[Agency (philosophy)|agents]] take [[social action|action]] simultaneously in order to achieve a common goal; their actions are usually coordinated.

Group action will often take place when social agents realize they are more likely to achieve their goal when acting together rather than individually. Group action differs from [[group behaviour]]s, which are uncoordinated, and also from [[mass action (sociology)|mass action]]s, which are more limited in place.

Group action is more likely to occur when the individuals within the group feel a [[identity fusion|sense of unity with the group]], even in personally costly actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swann Jr|first1=William B.|title=Identity Fusion|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=2015|volume=24|doi=10.1177/0963721414551363|pages=52–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though invert sugar syrup can be made by heating table sugar in water alone, the [[Chemical reaction|reaction]] can be sped up by adding [[lemon juice]],  [[cream of tartar]] or other [[Catalysis|catalyst]]s often without changing the flavor noticeably.

The mixture of the two simple sugars is formed by a process of [[hydrolysis]] of sucrose. This mixture has the opposite direction of [[optical rotation]] as the original sugar, which is why it is called an ''invert'' sugar.

==Chemistry==

Table sugar (sucrose) is converted to invert sugar by a chemical reaction called ''hydrolysis''. Heating a mixture or [[solution]] of table sugar and water breaks the [[chemical bond]] that links together the two simple-sugar components.

The [[Chemical equation|balanced chemical equation]] for the hydrolysis of sucrose into glucose and fructose is:

:[[File:Sugar-inversion.png|left|500px]]{{clear left}}

:C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; (sucrose) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (water) → C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (glucose) + C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (fructose)

=== Optical rotation ===
Once a sucrose solution has had some of its sucrose turned into glucose and fructose the solution is no longer said to be pure. The gradual decrease in purity of a sucrose solution as it is hydrolyzed affects a [[chemical property]] of the solution called [[optical rotation]] that can be used to figure out how much of the sucrose has been hydrolyzed and therefore whether the solution has been inverted or not. 

==== Definition and measurement ====
A kind of light called [[Polarization (waves)#Plane waves|plane polarized light]] can be shone through a sucrose solution as it is heated up for hydrolysis. Such light has an 'angle' that can be measured using a tool called a [[polarimeter]]. When such light is shone through a solution of pure sucrose it comes out the other side with a different angle than when it entered; its angle is therefore said to be 'rotated' and how many degrees the angle has changed (the degree of its rotation or its 'optical rotation') is given a letter name, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (alpha). When the rotation between the angle the light has when it enters and when it exits is in the clockwise direction, the light is said to be 'rotated  right' and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is given to have a ''positive'' angle like &lt;math&gt;64 \text{ degrees}&lt;/math&gt;. When the rotation between the angle the light has when it enters and when it exits is in the counterclockwise direction, the light is said to be 'rotated left' and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is given a ''negative'' angle like &lt;math&gt;-39 \text{ degrees}&lt;/math&gt;. 

==== Definition of the inversion point ====
When plane polarized light enters and exits a solution of ''pure'' sucrose its angle is rotated &lt;math&gt;66.5 \text{ degrees}&lt;/math&gt; (clockwise or to the right). As the sucrose is heated up and hydrolyzed the amount of glucose and fructose in the mixture increases and the optical rotation decreases. After &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; passes zero and becomes a negative optical rotation, meaning that the rotation between the angle the light has when it enters and when it exits is in the counter clockwise direction, it is said that the optical rotation has 'inverted' its direction. This leads to the definition of an 'inversion point' as the per cent amount sucrose that has to be hydrolyzed before &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; equals zero. Any solution which has passed the inversion point (and therefore has a negative value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;) is said to be 'inverted'. 

==== Chirality and specific rotation ====
As the [[Chemical structure|shapes of the molecules]] ('chemical structures') of sucrose, glucose and fructose are all [[Asymmetry|asymmetrical]] the three sugars come in several different forms, called [[stereoisomers]]. The existence of these forms is what gives rise to these chemicals' optical properties. When plane polarized light passes through a pure solution of one of these ''forms'' of one of the sugars it is thought to hit and 'glance off' certain asymmetrical [[Chemical bond|chemical bonds]] within the molecule of that form of that sugar. Because those particular bonds (which in [[Cyclic compound|cyclic sugars]] like sucrose, glucose and fructose include a kind of bond called an [[Anomer|anomeric bond]]) are different in each form of the sugar, each form rotates the light to a different degree. 

When any one form of a sugar is purified and put in water, it rapidly takes other forms of the same sugar. This means that a solution of a pure sugar normally has all of its stereoisomers present in the solution in different amounts which usually do not change much. This has an [[Mutarotation|'averaging' effect]] on all of the optical rotation angles (&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; values) of the different forms of the sugar and leads to the pure sugar solution having its own 'total' optical rotation, which is called its 'specific rotation' or 'observed specific rotation' and which is written as &lt;math&gt;[\alpha]&lt;/math&gt;.

|}

==== Effects of water ====
Water molecules do not have [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]], therefore they do not have any effect on the measurement of optical rotation. When plane polarized light enters a body of pure water its angle is no different than when it exits. Thus, for water, &lt;math&gt;[\alpha] = 0 \text{ degrees}&lt;/math&gt;. Chemicals that, like water, have specific rotations that equal zero degrees are called 'optically inactive' chemicals and like water, they do not need to be considered when calculating optical rotation.

==== Mixtures in general ====
The overall optical rotation of a mixture of chemicals can be calculated if the proportion of the amount of each chemical in the solution is known. If there are &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-many optically active different chemicals ('[[chemical species]]') in a solution and the [[molar concentration]] (the number of [[Mole (unit)|moles]] of each chemical per [[Litre|Liter]] of liquid solution) of each chemical in the solution is known and written as &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is a number used to identify the chemical species); and if each species has a specific rotation (the optical rotation of that chemical were it made as a pure solution) written as &lt;math&gt;[\alpha]_i&lt;/math&gt;, then the mixture has the overall optical rotation&lt;math display="block"&gt;\displaystyle \alpha = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N C_i [\alpha]_i}{\sum_{i=1}^N C_i} = \sum_{i=1}^N \left(\frac{C_i}{\sum_{i=1}^N C_i}\right)[\alpha]_i = \sum_{i=1}^N \chi_i[\alpha]_i&lt;/math&gt;Where &lt;math&gt;\chi_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mole fraction]] of the &lt;math&gt;i \mathrm{^{th}}&lt;/math&gt; species. 

==== Fully hydrolyzed sucrose ====
Assuming no extra chemical products are formed by accident (''that is'', there are no [[Side reaction|side reactions]]) a completely hydrolyzed sucrose solution no longer has any sucrose and is a half-and-half mixture of glucose and fructose. This solution has the optical rotation&lt;math display="block"&gt;\displaystyle \alpha = \frac{1}{2}[\alpha]_{\text{glucose}} + \frac{1}{2}[\alpha]_{\text{fructose}} = \frac{1}{2}\cdot (52.7 - 92.0) \text{ degrees} = -19.7 \text{ degrees}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Partly hydrolyzed sucrose ====
If a sucrose solution has been partly hydrolyzed, then it contains sucrose, glucose and fructose and its optical rotation angle depends on the relative amounts of each for the solution;&lt;math display="block"&gt;\displaystyle \alpha = \chi_s[\alpha]_s +\chi_g[\alpha]_g +\chi_f[\alpha]_f&lt;/math&gt;Where &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; stand for sucrose, glucose, and fructose. 

The particular values of &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; do not need to be known to make use of this equation as the inversion point (per cent amount of sucrose that must be hydrolyzed before the solution is inverted) can be calculated from the specific rotation angles of the pure sugars. The reaction [[stoichiometry]] (the fact that hydrolyzing one sucrose molecule makes one glucose molecule and one fructose molecule) shows that when a solution begins with &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; [[Mole (unit)|moles]] of sucrose and no glucose nor fructose and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; [[Mole (unit)|moles]] of sucrose are then hydrolyzed the resulting solution has &lt;math&gt;x_0-x&lt;/math&gt; moles of sucrose, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; moles of glucose and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; moles of fructose. The total number of moles of sugars in the solution is therefore &lt;math&gt;x+x_0&lt;/math&gt;and the [[Reaction progress kinetic analysis|reaction progress]] (per cent completion of the hydrolysis reaction) equals &lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{x_0} \cdot 100 \%&lt;/math&gt;. It can be shown that the solution's optical rotation angle is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of (explicitly depends on) this per cent reaction progress. When the quantity &lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{x_0}&lt;/math&gt; is written as &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and the reaction is &lt;math&gt;r \cdot 100\%&lt;/math&gt; done, the optical rotation angle is&lt;math display="block"&gt;\displaystyle \alpha_{r} = \frac{(x_0-x)[\alpha]_s +x[\alpha]_g +x[\alpha]_f}{x_0 + x} 
= \frac{1}{1 + r}\left([\alpha]_s +  ([\alpha]_g + [\alpha]_f - [\alpha]_s)\cdot r\right) &lt;/math&gt;By definition, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; equals zero degrees at the 'inversion point'; to find the inversion point, therefore, alpha is set equal to zero and the equation is manipulated to find &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. This gives&lt;math display="block"&gt;\displaystyle r_{\text{inversion}} = \frac{[\alpha]_s}{[\alpha]_s - [\alpha]_g - [\alpha]_f} = 0.629 &lt;/math&gt;Thus it is found that a sucrose solution is inverted once at least &lt;math&gt;62.9 \%&lt;/math&gt; of the sucrose has been hydrolyzed into glucose and fructose. 

==== Monitoring reaction progress ====
Holding a sucrose solution at temperatures of {{convert|50|-|60|°C|°F}} hydrolyzes no more than about 85 per cent of its sucrose. Finding &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;r = 0.85&lt;/math&gt; shows that the optical rotation of the solution after hydrolysis is done is &lt;math&gt;- 12.7 \text{ degrees} &lt;/math&gt;; this reaction is said to invert the sugar because its final optical rotation is less than zero. A polarimeter can be used to figure out when the inversion is done by detecting whether the optical rotation of the solution at an earlier time in its hydrolysis reaction equals &lt;math&gt;- 12.7 \text{ degrees} &lt;/math&gt;. 

==Production==
Common sugar can be inverted quickly by mixing sugar and [[citric acid]] or [[cream of tartar]] at a ratio of about 1000:1 by weight and adding water. If [[lemon juice]] which is about five per cent citric acid by weight is used instead then the ratio becomes 1:75. Such a mixture, heated to {{convert|114|°C|°F}}&lt;ref name="eddy.van.damme"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.chefeddy.com/2009/11/invert-sugar/ |title = Invert sugar recipe |first = Eddy |last = Van Damme |accessdate = September 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and added to another food, prevents crystallization without tasting sour. 

Invert sugar syrup can be made without acids or enzymes by heating it up alone: two parts granulated sugar and one part water, [[Simmering|simmered]] for five to seven minutes, will be partly inverted.

Commercially prepared [[enzyme]]-catalyzed solutions are inverted at {{convert|60|°C|°F}}. The optimum pH for inversion is 5.0. Invertase is added at a rate of about 0.15% of the syrup's weight, and inversion time will be about 8 hours. When completed the syrup temperature is raised to inactivate the invertase, but the syrup is concentrated in a vacuum evaporator to preserve color.&lt;ref name="Minifie"&gt;{{cite book |first = Bernard |last = W.

When adding baking soda and whipping or mixing, the hot syrup will foam and bubble up, so some care is required. A much taller pan than otherwise needed will contain the foam.

The amount of water can be increased to increase the time it takes to reach the desired final temperature, and increasing the time increases the amount of inversion that occurs.&lt;ref name="Pennington.baker"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first = Neil L. |editor1-last = Pennington |editor2-first = Charles W. |editor2-last = Baker |title = Sugar: User's Guide To Sucrose |date = 1990 |publisher = Van Nostrand Reinhold |location = New York |isbn = 0442002971 |pages = 108-109 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EiD7ZPwIIEcC&amp;pg=PA108 |accessdate = July 1, 2014 |via = Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, higher final temperatures result in thicker syrups, and lower final temperatures, in thinner ones.

All constituent sugars (sucrose, glucose and fructose) support fermentation, so invert sugar solutions may be fermented as readily as sucrose solutions.

==Shelf life==
Fully inverted sugar's low water content improves the shelf lives of products that contain it. The shelf life of partly inverted sugar is about six months and varies by storage and climatic conditions. 

Crystallized invert sugar solutions can be restored to their liquid state by gently heating.

==In other foods and products==
*[[Honey]] which is mostly a mixture of glucose and fructose, being similar to invert syrup therefore, can remain a liquid for long periods of time.
*[[Fruit preserves|Jam]] contains invert sugar formed by the heating process and the acid content of the fruit. This sugar preserves the jam for long periods of time.
*[[Golden syrup]] is a syrup of about 55% invert syrup and 45% table sugar (sucrose).
*[[Fondant icing|Fondant]] filling for chocolates is unique in that the conversion enzyme is added, but not activated by acidification (microenvironment pH adjustment) or [[cofactor_(biochemistry)|cofactor]] addition depending on the enzyme(s), before the filling is [[enrober|enrobed]] with chocolate.  The very viscous (and thus formable) filling then becomes less viscous with time, giving the creamy consistency desired. This results from the sub-optimal enzyme(s) conditions purposely created by withholding activation factors, which allows only a fraction of the enzyme(s) to be active, or allows all enzyme(s) to proceed at only a fraction of the biological rate [biologically, it's realistically a combination of both: a reduced number of functional enzymes, with the ones that do function having reduced catalytic kinetics/rates].
*[[Cigarette]]s use inverted sugar as a ''casing'' to add flavour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = BAT Global Ingredients |publisher = British American Tobacco |url = http://www.bat-ingredients.com/servlet/PageMerge?mainurl=%2Fgroupms%2Fsites%2FBAT_6X3ENK.nsf%2FvwPagesWebLive%2FEEB7C53A3AC263148025728B005D9C0D%3Fopendocument&amp;alturl=%2Fgroupms%2Fsites%2FBAT_6X3ENK.nsf%2FvwPagesWebLive%2FD23047A62F4081DB8025725E0067DFAF%3Fopendocument&amp;SKN=1&amp;usealt=i_btn4%2Ci_show&amp;i_CTRY=UK+Domestic&amp;i_CLASS=STICK&amp;i_BRAND=LUCKY%2BSTRIKE&amp;i_btn4=%3E%3E&amp;i_INGURL=%2Fgroupms%2Fgbl_ing_v3.nsf%2FvwMarketDetailsProductsTrans%2FLIVESTICKUK+Domestic2007ENGLISH%2F%24file%2FBS29115.html%3Fopenelement |accessdate = August 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with [[Frederic Rousseau]] he is group leader at the [[Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie|VIB]] [[Switch Laboratory]], [[KU Leuven]].

His research interest is on essential cellular processes where functional regulation is governed by [[protein]] conformational switches that have to be actively controlled to ensure cell viability&lt;ref&gt;A systems biology perspective on protein structural dynamics and signal transduction, Rousseau F, Schymkowitz J, Curr Opin Struct Biol 23-30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

He obtained a PhD at the [[University of Cambridge]] ([[Cambridge]], [[United Kingdom]]) in 2001. He did a Postdoc at the [[EMBL]] in [[Heidelberg]] [[Germany]] from 2001 until 2003. Joost Schymkowitz is a [[Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie|VIB]] Group leader since 2003.

Galaxies inside the void experience gravitational pull from matter outside the void, yielding a larger local value for the Hubble constant.

*A/112: [[E-VSB]] (Enhanced [[Vestigal Sideband]])
*A/153: [[ATSC-M/H]]

In 2004, the main ATSC standard was amended to support Enhanced ATSC (A/112); this transmission mode is backwardly compatible with the original [[8VSB|8-Bit Vestigal Sideband]] modulation scheme, but provides much better error correction.

[[ATSC-M/H]] for [[mobile TV]] has been approved and added to some stations, though it is known that it uses [[MPEG-4]] instead of [[MPEG-2]] for encoding, and behaves as an MPEG-4-encoded subchannel, inheriting 8VSB from the remainder of the channel.

== ATSC 3.0 ==
{{Main|ATSC 3.0}}
[[ATSC 3.0]] is a non-backwards-compatible version of ATSC being developed (as of May 18, 2016) that uses [[OFDM]] instead of [[8VSB]] and a much newer video codec (instead of ATSC 1 and 2's [[MPEG-2]]).  At the time of this article's writing, it has several candidate and one finalized standard.

On March 28, 2016, the [[Bootstrapping|Bootstrap component]] of ATSC 3.0 (System Discovery and Signalling) was upgraded from candidate standard to finalized standard.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvtechnology.com/news/0002/first-element-of-atsc-30-approved-for-standard/278263&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 4, 2016, the Audio Codec component of ATSC 3.0 was elevated to candidate standard, with two finalists remaining: [[Dolby AC-4]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dolby.com/us/en/technologies/AC-4.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[MPEG-H]] Audio Alliance format from [[Fraunhofer IIS]], [[Qualcomm]] and [[Technicolor SA]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvtechnology.com/news/0002/atsc-a32-audio-elevated-to-candidate-standard/278594&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpeghaa.com MPEG-H Audio Alliance Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;  A third entry from [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]] named [[DTS:X]] (a successor to [[DTS-HD]]) was withdrawn before the standard was upgraded to candidate status.&lt;ref&gt;http://atsc.org/news-release/advanced-television-systems-committee-begins-review-of-atsc-3-0-audio-system-proposals/&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8, 2016, the Physical Layer Download ([[OFDM]]) component of ATSC 3.0 was upgraded from candidate standard to finalized standard.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvtechnology.com/atsc3/0031/atsc-30-physical-layer-standard-approved/279414&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 5, 2016, the Link Layer Protocol Standard (A/330) was elevated from Candidate to final standard, along with the Audio Watermark Emission Standard (A/334) and Video Watermark Emission Standard (A/335).  ATSC Technology Group 3 (TG3) members have also begun voting on elevating the following Candidate Standards to Proposed Standard status (the final step before becoming an approved standard): Service Announcement (A/322), Service Usage Reporting (A/333) and Captions and Subtitles (A/343).  TG3 members also are voting to elevate Security (A/360) to Candidate Standard status, joining Schedule and Studio-to-Transmitter Link Standard (A/324), which was recently elevated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvtechnology.com/atsc3/0031/atsc-approves-more-30-components/279556&lt;/ref&gt;  On March 30, 2016, A/324 (Schedule and Studio-to-Transmitter Link) was upgraded from Proposed to Candidate Standard.

On January 3, 2017, ATSC announced the updated status of its standards, in time for its debut at the [[Consumer Electronics Show#2017|Consumer Electronics Show]] in [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvtechnology.com/atsc3/0031/atsc-30-getting-the-spotlight-at-ces-2017/280049&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, this update, Captions and Subtitles (A/343) was upgraded from Candidate to Finalized Standard; Security (A-360), Lab Performance Test Plan (A-325) and Field Test Plan (A-326) were upgraded to Candidate Standard from "Under Consideration".

By March 7, 2017, ATSC announced a further update to the status of its standards, with the following as Finalized: A/321 (System Discovery and Signaling); A/322 Physical Layer Protocl (COFDM); A/326 (Field Test Plan [Recommended Practice]); A/330 (Link Layer Protocol); A/333 (Service Usage Reporting); A/334 (Audio Watermark Emission); A/335 (Video Watermark Emission); A/336 (Content Recovery in Redistribution Scenarios [ATSC 3.0 over Cable and Satellite]); A/342 Part 1 (Audio Common Elements); A/342 Part 2 (Audio: Dolby AC-4 System); A/342 Part 3 (Audio MPEG-H System); and A/343 (Captions and Subtitles).  The following are Proposed Standards: A/325 (Lab Performance Test Plan [Recommended Practice]); A/332 (Service Announcement); A/338 (Companion Device); A/341 (Video - H.265/HEVC).  The following are Candidate Standards: A/300 (ATSC 3.0 System); A/324 (Scheduler/Studio-to-Transmitter Link); A/331 (Signalling, Delivery, Sync Error Protection); A/337 (Application Signalling); A/344 (Interactive Content); A/360 (Security and Service Protection).  The following is a Draft Standard: A/323 (Physical Layer Uplink/Downlink).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvtechnology.com/broadcast-engineering/0029/a-tipping-point-for-atsc-30-standards-development/280503&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Metalworking occupations''' include:

==The oldest of the metalworking occupations==

* [[Smith (metalwork)|Smith]] (a.k.a. [[metalsmith]]), such as [[blacksmith]] or [[silversmith]]
* [[Jewellery|Jeweler]]
* [[Foundry|Founder]]

==The machining trades==

* Production [[machinist]], which may involve various related machining occupations that often overlap:
** Manual [[machine tool]] operator
** [[CNC]] programmer, the person who takes the drawings made by engineers and draftspersons and creates a CNC program to cut the part
** CNC setup hand, the person who sets up the machine and its tooling before the operator takes over
** CNC operator, the person who feeds stock to the machine, changes cutting inserts, checks quality, cleans and lubricates the machine, etc.
* [[Tool and die maker]] and related machining occupations:
** [[Moldmaker]]
** [[Pattern (casting)|Patternmaker]]
** [[Modelmaker]]

==The fabricating and erecting trades==

* [[Steel erector]], also known as an iron turtle
* [[Welder]]
* [[Boilermaker]]
* [[Pipefitter]]
* [[Millwright]]
* [[Blacksmith]]
* [[Gunsmith]]
* [[Marquetry|Marquetarian]] (though often dealing exclusively with wood, ivory or other non-metallic materials)
* [[Farrier]]
* [[Furniture|Furniture maker]]

==Other occupations within a metalworking plant== 
* [[Laborer]], unskilled and semiskilled workers who support metalworking operations and who often develop their skills to move into the other occupations listed here. Sometimes laborers' positions may be called by more specific names, such as [[Oiler (occupation)|oiler]]. Technology in general, and [[automation]] especially, tends to exert pressure against laborer-type job creation, with the lowest-skilled positions being most at risk. For example, so-called labor gangs, groups of men assigned to shoveling or other manual tasks, are not employed nearly as much as they used to be, especially in developed economies. Some jobs, despite being classifiable as semiskilled work, actually require quite a bit of talent and experience to be done well, for example, [[band saw]] operators or [[Polishing|buffing and polishing]] workers.
* [[Rigger (industry)|Rigger]], a person specializing in the skills needed to move large, heavy objects
* [[Heavy equipment operator]], a person who operates engineering vehicles (also known as heavy equipment)
* Shipping-and-receiving workers, such as [[Forklift truck|forklift]] drivers and packagers
* [[management|Manager]], a businessperson who manages the work of others
* [[Quality assurance]] (QA) staff, who are usually [[inspection|inspector]]s with additional training in [[quality management system]]s, which focus not only on finding defects that have occurred ([[inspection]]) but also on preventing defects from happening in the first place, by engineering processes that lower the probability of their occurrence. The latter causes QA to overlap with [[statistics]] and [[industrial engineering]]. 
** [[Weld quality assurance]] staff, ensuring the quality of weldments. 
*** Weld inspectors require training in [[metallurgy]] that ranges anywhere from an undergraduate familiarity all the way up to, in some cases, that of a university [[materials science]] academic. This is in addition to learning about the many types of welding equipment and techniques that exist today. A spectrum of capabilities exists between welders and weld inspectors. Practicing welders may have more experience with the technique (holding the wire and torches just right to make an excellent weld rather than a poor one, analogously to how a musician must play a musical instrument just right, with highly practiced deftness of fine motor control, in order to produce an excellent sound rather than a poor one), but inspectors may have greater training in the metallurgy involved and greater overview knowledge of a wider range of ''types'' of welding. Many weld inspectors have been, or could quickly become, practicing welders, and vice versa, while others in each role may lack the experience or training to easily switch to the other. 
** Machining quality assurance staff, who use equipment such as [[coordinate-measuring machine|CMMs]], [[surface plate]]s, [[height gauge]]s, and [[micrometer]]s to check conformance with the [[geometric dimensioning and tolerancing|GD&amp;T]]-defined geometry and dimensions defined by the [[engineering drawing]] or [[model-based definition|3D model]]. The skills of these staff members and of the machinists themselves overlap; some inspectors have been, or could quickly become, practicing machinists, and vice versa, while others in each role may lack the experience or training to easily switch to the other. 
** [[Metallurgy|Metallurgist]], a person who assures the chemical and physical traits of the metal, whether raw mill products or semifinished or finished parts and weldments.

==Occupations closely related to metalworking==

* [[Miner]] of ore or minerals
* [[Scrap]] processor
* [[Trade union|Union]] representative, sometimes a practicing tradesperson doing the job part-time, other times someone doing the job full-time
* [[Truck driver]], a person who drives trucks (also known as lorries)
* The various engineering disciplines, especially:
** [[Mechanical engineering|Mechanical engineer]]
** [[Chemical engineering|Chemical engineer]]
** [[Industrial engineering|Industrial engineer]]
** [[Materials science|Materials engineer]]

'''One-alarm''', '''two-alarm''', '''three-alarm fires''', etc., are categories of [[Conflagration|fire]]s indicating the level of response by local authorities. The term '''multiple-alarm''' is a quick way of indicating that a fire is severe and is difficult to [[Fire containment|contain]]. This system of classification is common in the [[Firefighting in the United States|United States]] and in [[Canada]] {{cn|date=November 2018}} among both [[fire department]]s and news agencies.

==Definition==
A common misconception is that a "3-alarm fire," for example, means that three firehouses responded to the fire. This is not the rule behind the naming convention, although some cities may use the number of firehouses responding for multi-alarm designations because that is the simplest way to determine an alarm number.&lt;ref name="Rochester3alarm"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2015/01/27/firefighters-battle-blaze-behind-memorial-art-gallery/22389473/ |title=Demolition of building near MAG to continue Wednesday |last=MacIntyre-Yee|work=[[Democrat &amp; Chronicle]] |first=Tina |date=January 27, 2015 |accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="engber"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Engber|first1=Daniel|title=How Big Is a '10-Alarm Fire'?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2006/05/how_big_is_a_10alarm_fire.html|website=Slate|accessdate=15 November 2016|date=4 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely used formula for multi-alarm designation is based on the number of units ([[Fire apparatus|firetrucks]] for example) and [[firefighters]] responding to a fire; the more vehicles and firefighters responding, the higher the alarm designation. (Note: In most cities, a "unit" can be anything from a tanker or ladder truck to rescue vehicles to even cars driven by the chief and deputies.&lt;ref name="engber" /&gt;)

With this unit/firefighter alarm designation, the initial dispatch is referred to as a "first alarm" and is typically the largest. Subsequent alarms are calls for additional units, usually because the fire has grown and additional resources are needed to combat it, or that the incident is persisting long enough that firefighters on scene need to be relieved.&lt;ref name="nbc4"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paying For Donated Blood, Ethanol In Lawn Mowers, Numbered Alarm Fires|url=http://www.nbc4.com/money/9208480/detail.html|website=NBC4.com|accessdate=15 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123185444/http://www.nbc4.com/money/9208480/detail.html|archivedate=23 November 2007|date=12 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Requests for units and firefighters from outside jurisdictions do not normally occur in multi-firehouse urban areas until elevated alarms are reached (alarm three and above), but will depend on the location of the incident and the condition of the authority having jurisdiction at the time of the incident.

The system of classification comes from the old tradition of using [[Fire alarm box|pull stations]] to alert the local departments to a fire in their area.&lt;ref name="engber" /&gt; The "box" would send a message to all local stations by telegraph that there was a fire, indicating the location as a number: (station area)-(box number), e.g., 2-11.&lt;ref name="engber" /&gt; Fires are still dispatched as "box alarms," following this tradition, with maps broken up into a grid of "box areas."

==Typical alarm levels==
Below is a list of the alarm levels used in the response policy of the [[New York City Fire Department]]. This is a basic example of how alarm levels are categorized in a fire department, how many fire apparatus or fire units  respond to each alarm level, etc. In New York, however, additional special alarm levels are utilized, aside from the conventional 1st alarm, 2nd alarm, 3rd alarm, etc. Examples of such alarm levels are the signal 10-75 assignment, the signals 10-76 and 10-77 assignments, and the signal 10-60 assignment. A 10-75 is a working fire (i.e., there is fire visible from a building), the 10-76/10-77 assignments are the alarm levels separate from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd alarms, etc. that are the standard fire department responses to fires in high-rise buildings. The signal 10-60 is a separate response to major disasters. 

Below is how alarm levels are categorized in order per protocol. Each apparatus count is in an addition per alarm (a five alarm assignment has 21 engine companies total). Each total is the total number of units on scene. &lt;ref name="fdny"&gt;{{cite web|title=FDNY Dispatch Policy|url=http://www.fdnewyork.com/aa.asp|website=FDNewYork.com|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*SOC battalion
*1 tactical support unit
*field comm
*field comm battalion
*communications unit

*Air Recon Chief (on Brooklyn box)

5th alarm assignment: 
*20 engine companies 
*11 ladder companies 
*6 battalion chiefs
*1 rescue Company 
*1 squad Company 
*1 deputy chief
*1 RAC unit
*1 satellite
*safety battalion
*SOC battalion
*1 tactical support unit
*field comm
*field comm battalion
*communications unit
*mobile command unit
*planning section chief
*Air Recon Chief (on Brooklyn box)

If the incident commander decides that the incident does not require a higher alarm level to be requested, they can specially request an additional unit to the scene without requesting a full alarm level assignment. For example, at a working fire, there are four engine companies, three ladder companies, one squad company, one rescue company, two battalion chiefs, and one division chief operating at the scene. If the fire is not large enough to require a 2nd alarm, but there is a need for more equipment and manpower, the commanding chief can request additional units to respond "specially called" to the scene.

Thus, at the scene of a 5th alarm fire in New York, there are a total of 20 engine companies, 11 ladder companies, one squad company, one rescue company, six battalion chiefs, one division chief, one deputy chief, one assistant chief, and the chief of operations, as well as multiple specialized units and or specially called units operating on the scene.

All of these companies come from many firehouses to the scene. Some companies, however, are quartered together at the same firehouses. So, it is not a matter of how many firehouses respond to a fire, as popularly believed, but rather, how many companies/units and how many firefighters are operating on scene.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27508">In physics, an '''operator''' is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] over a [[State space (physics)|space]] of physical states to another space of physical states. The simplest example of the utility of operators is the study of [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]] (which makes the concept of a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] useful in this context). Because of this, they are a very useful tool in [[classical mechanics]]. Operators are even more important in [[quantum mechanics]], where they form an intrinsic part of the formulation of the theory.

==Operators in classical mechanics==

In classical mechanics, the movement of a particle (or system of particles) is completely determined by the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] &lt;math&gt;L(q, \dot{q}, t)&lt;/math&gt; or equivalently the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] &lt;math&gt;H(q, p, t)&lt;/math&gt;, a function of the [[generalized coordinates]] ''q'', generalized velocities &lt;math&gt;\dot{q} = \mathrm{d} q / \mathrm{d} t&lt;/math&gt; and its [[conjugate momenta]]:

:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}}&lt;/math&gt;

If either ''L'' or ''H'' is independent of a generalized coordinate ''q'', meaning the ''L'' and ''H'' do not change when ''q'' is changed, which in turn means the dynamics of the particle are still the same even when ''q'' changes, the corresponding momenta conjugate to those coordinates will be conserved (this is part of [[Noether's theorem]], and the invariance of motion with respect to the coordinate ''q'' is a [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]]). Operators in classical mechanics are related to these symmetries.

More technically, when ''H'' is invariant under the action of a certain [[group (mathematics)|group]] of transformations ''G'':

:&lt;math&gt;S\in G, H(S(q,p))=H(q,p)&lt;/math&gt;.

the elements of ''G'' are physical operators, which map physical states among themselves.

where &lt;math&gt;R(\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}, \theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[rotation matrix]] about an axis defined by the [[unit vector]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}&lt;/math&gt; and angle ''θ''.

==Generators==
If the transformation is infinitesimal, the operator action should be of the form

: &lt;math&gt; I + \epsilon A &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the identity operator, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter with a small value, and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; will depend on the transformation at hand, and is called a [[generating set of a group|generator of the group]]. Again, as a simple example, we will derive the generator of the space translations on 1D functions.

As it was stated, &lt;math&gt;T_a f(x)=f(x-a)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;a=\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is infinitesimal, then we may  write

: &lt;math&gt;T_\epsilon f(x)=f(x-\epsilon)\approx f(x) - \epsilon f'(x).&lt;/math&gt;

This formula may be rewritten as

: &lt;math&gt;T_\epsilon f(x) = (I-\epsilon D) f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the generator of the translation group, which in this case happens to be the ''derivative'' operator. Thus, it is said that the generator of translations is the derivative.

==The exponential map==
The whole group may be recovered, under normal circumstances, from the generators, via the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]]. In the case of the translations the idea works like this.

The translation for a finite value of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; may be obtained by repeated application of the infinitesimal translation:

: &lt;math&gt;T_a f(x) = \lim_{N\to\infty} T_{a/N} \cdots T_{a/N} f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

with the &lt;math&gt;\cdots&lt;/math&gt; standing for the application &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; times. If &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is large, each of the factors may be considered to be infinitesimal:

: &lt;math&gt;T_a f(x) = \lim_{N\to\infty} (I -(a/N) D)^N f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

But this limit may be rewritten as an exponential:

: &lt;math&gt;T_a f(x)= \exp(-aD) f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

To be convinced of the validity of this formal expression, we may expand the exponential in a power series:

: &lt;math&gt;T_a f(x) = \left( I - aD + {a^2D^2\over 2!} - {a^3D^3\over 3!} + \cdots \right) f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

The right-hand side may be rewritten as

: &lt;math&gt;f(x) - a f'(x) + {a^2\over 2!} f''(x) - {a^3\over 3!} f'''(x) + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

which is just the Taylor expansion of &lt;math&gt;f(x-a)&lt;/math&gt;, which was our original value for &lt;math&gt;T_a f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

The mathematical properties of physical operators are a topic of great importance in itself. For further information, see [[C*-algebra]] and [[Gelfand-Naimark theorem]].

==Operators in quantum mechanics==

The [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]] (QM) is built upon the concept of an operator.

The wavefunction represents the [[probability amplitude]] of finding the system in that state. The terms "wavefunction" and "state" in QM context are usually used interchangeably{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}.

Physical [[pure state]]s in quantum mechanics are represented as [[unit-norm vector]]s (probabilities are normalized to one) in a special [[complex number|complex]] [[Hilbert space]]. [[Time evolution]] in this [[vector space]] is given by the application of the [[evolution operator]].

Any [[observable]], i.e., any quantity which can be measured in a physical experiment, should be associated with a [[self-adjoint]] [[linear operator]]. The operators must yield real [[eigenvalue]]s, since they are values which may come up as the result of the experiment. Although traditionally physicists associated real eigenvalues with [[Hermitian operator|Hermiticity]], in 1998 physicists realized that there also exist non-Hermitian operators with all-real spectra; namely, [[Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics|parity-time (PT) symmetric operators]].&lt;ref name="QUANTUM CHEMISRTY 1977"&gt;Molecular Quantum Mechanics Parts I and II: An Introduction to Quantum Chemistry (Volume 1), P.W. Atkins, Oxford University Press, 1977, {{ISBN|0-19-855129-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bender|first=Carl M.|date=2007-06-01|title=Making Sense of Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians|arxiv=hep-th/0703096|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|volume=70|issue=6|pages=947–1018|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/70/6/R03|issn=0034-4885|bibcode=2007RPPh...70..947B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bender|first=Carl M.|last2=Boettcher|first2=Stefan|date=1998-06-15|title=Real Spectra in Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians Having PT Symmetry|arxiv=physics/9712001|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=80|issue=24|pages=5243–5246|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.80.5243|issn=0031-9007|bibcode=1998PhRvL..80.5243B}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Hermitian operators, the probability of each eigenvalue is related to the projection of the physical state on the subspace related to that eigenvalue. See below for mathematical details about Hermitian operators.

In the [[Schrödinger equation#Particles as waves|wave mechanics]] formulation of QM, the wavefunction varies with space and time, or equivalently momentum and time (see [[position and momentum space]] for details), so observables are [[differential operator]]s.

In the [[matrix mechanics]] formulation, the [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] of the physical state should stay fixed, so the evolution operator should be [[unitary transformation|unitary]], and the operators can be represented as matrices. Any other symmetry, mapping a physical state into another, should keep this restriction.

===Wavefunction ===

{{Main|wavefunction}}

The wavefunction must be [[square-integrable]] (see [[Lp spaces]]), meaning:

:&lt;math&gt;\iiint_{\mathbb{R}^3} |\psi(\mathbf{r})|^2 {\rm d}^3\mathbf{r} = \iiint_{\mathbb{R}^3} \psi(\mathbf{r})^*\psi(\mathbf{r}){\rm d}^3\mathbf{r} &lt; \infty &lt;/math&gt;

and normalizable, so that:

:&lt;math&gt;\iiint_{\mathbb{R}^3} |\psi(\mathbf{r})|^2 {\rm d}^3\mathbf{r} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Two cases of eigenstates (and eigenvalues) are:
*for '''discrete''' eigenstates &lt;math&gt; | \psi_i \rangle &lt;/math&gt; forming a discrete basis, so the state is a [[summation|sum]]
::&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle = \sum_i c_i|\phi_i\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are complex numbers such that |''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = probability of measuring the state &lt;math&gt;|\phi_i\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, and has the corresponding set of eigenvalues ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is also discrete - either [[Finite set|finite]] or [[countably infinite]],
*for a '''continuum''' of eigenstates &lt;math&gt; | \psi_i \rangle &lt;/math&gt; forming a continuous basis, so the state is an [[integral]]
::&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle = \int c(\phi){\rm d}\phi|\phi\rangle &lt;/math&gt;
:where ''c''(φ) is a complex function such that |''c''(φ)|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''c''(φ)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''c''(φ) = probability of measuring the state &lt;math&gt;|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, there is an [[uncountably infinite]] set of eigenvalues ''a''.

===Linear operators in wave mechanics===

{{Main|Wave function|Bra-ket notation}}

Let ''ψ'' be the wavefunction for a quantum system, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; be any [[linear operator]] for some observable ''A'' (such as position, momentum, energy, angular momentum etc.), then

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{A} \psi = a \psi ,&lt;/math&gt;

where:

* ''a'' is the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue]] of the operator, corresponding to the measured value of the observable, i.e. observable ''A'' has a measured value ''a''
*''ψ'' is the [[eigenfunction]] of &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; if this relation holds.

If ''ψ''  is an eigenfunction of a given operator A, then a definite quantity (the eigenvalue a) will be observed if a measurement of the observable A is made on the state ''ψ''. Conversely, if ''ψ'' is not an eigenfunction of A, then it has no eigenvalue for A, and the observable does not have a single definite value in that case. Instead, measurements of the observable A will yield each eigenvalue with a certain probability (related to the decomposition of ''ψ'' relative to the orthonormal eigenbasis of A).

In bra–ket notation the above can be written;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} &amp; \hat{A} \psi = \hat{A} \psi ( \mathbf{r} ) = \hat{A} \left\langle \mathbf{r} \mid \psi \right\rangle = \left\langle \mathbf{r} \mid \hat {A} \mid \psi \right\rangle \\
&amp; a \psi = a \psi ( \mathbf{r} ) = a \left\langle \mathbf{r} \mid \psi \right\rangle = \left\langle \mathbf{r} \mid a \mid \psi \right\rangle \\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

in which case &lt;math&gt; \left| \psi \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; is an [[eigenvector]], or [[eigenket]].

Due to linearity, vectors can be defined in any number of dimensions, as each component of the vector acts on the function separately. One mathematical example is the [[del operator]], which is itself a vector (useful in momentum-related quantum operators, in the table below).

An operator in ''n''-dimensional space can be written:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\hat{A}} = \sum_{j=1}^n \mathbf{e}_j \hat{A}_j &lt;/math&gt;

where '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; are basis vectors corresponding to each component operator ''A&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''. Each component will yield a corresponding eigenvalue. Acting this on the wave function ''ψ'':

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\hat{A}} \psi = \left( \sum_{j=1}^n \mathbf{e}_j \hat{A}_j \right) \psi = \sum_{j=1}^n \left( \mathbf{e}_j \hat{A}_j \psi \right) = \sum_{j=1}^n \left( \mathbf{e}_j a_j \psi \right) &lt;/math&gt;

in which

:&lt;math&gt; \hat{A}_j \psi = a_j \psi .&lt;/math&gt;

In bra–ket notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} &amp; \mathbf{\hat{A}} \psi = \mathbf{\hat{A}} \psi ( \mathbf{r} ) = \mathbf{\hat{A}} \left\langle \mathbf{r} \mid \psi \right\rangle = \left\langle \mathbf{r} \mid \mathbf{\hat{A}} \mid \psi \right\rangle \\

&amp; \left ( \sum_{j=1}^n \mathbf{e}_j \hat{A}_j \right ) \psi = \left ( \sum_{j=1}^n \mathbf{e}_j \hat{A}_j \right ) \psi ( \mathbf{r} ) = \left ( \sum_{j=1}^n \mathbf{e}_j \hat{A}_j \right ) \left\langle \mathbf{r} \mid \psi \right\rangle = \left\langle \mathbf{r} \mid \sum_{j=1}^n \mathbf{e}_j \hat{A}_j \mid \psi \right\rangle \\

\end{align} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

===Commutation of operators on ''Ψ''===

{{main|Commutator}}

If two observables ''A'' and ''B'' have linear operators &lt;math&gt; \hat{A} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \hat{B} &lt;/math&gt;, the commutator is defined by,

:&lt;math&gt; \left [ \hat{A}, \hat{B} \right ] = \hat{A} \hat{B} - \hat{B} \hat{A} &lt;/math&gt;

The commutator is itself a (composite) operator. Acting the commutator on ''ψ'' gives:

:&lt;math&gt; \left [ \hat{A}, \hat{B} \right ] \psi = \hat{A} \hat{B} \psi - \hat{B} \hat{A} \psi . &lt;/math&gt;

If ''ψ'' is an eigenfunction with eigenvalues ''a'' and ''b'' for observables ''A'' and ''B'' respectively, and if the operators commute:

:&lt;math&gt; \left [ \hat{A}, \hat{B} \right ] \psi = 0, &lt;/math&gt;

then the observables ''A'' and ''B'' can be measured simultaneously with infinite precision i.e. uncertainties &lt;math&gt; \Delta A = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \Delta B = 0 &lt;/math&gt;  simultaneously. ''ψ'' is then said to be the simultaneous eigenfunction of  A and B. To illustrate this:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}\left [ \hat{A}, \hat{B} \right ] \psi &amp; = \hat{A} \hat{B} \psi - \hat{B} \hat{A} \psi \\
&amp; = a(b \psi) - b(a \psi) \\
&amp; = 0 .\\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
It shows that measurement of A and B does not cause any shift of state i.e. initial and final states are same (no disturbance due to measurement). Suppose we measure A to get value a. We then measure B to get the value b. We measure A again. We still get the same value a. Clearly the state (''ψ'') of the system is not destroyed and so we are able to measure A and B simultaneously with infinite precision.
 
If the operators do not commute:

:&lt;math&gt; \left [ \hat{A}, \hat{B} \right ] \psi \neq 0, &lt;/math&gt;

they can't be prepared simultaneously to arbitrary precision, and there is an [[uncertainty relation]] between the observables,
&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta A \Delta B \geq \left|\frac{\langle[A,B]\rangle}{2} \right|&lt;/math&gt; 
even if ''ψ''  is an eigenfunction the above relation holds.. Notable pairs are position and momentum, and energy and time - uncertainty relations, and the angular momenta (spin, orbital and total) about any two orthogonal axes (such as ''L&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''L&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', or ''s&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''s&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' etc.).&lt;ref name=Ballentine1970&gt;{{citation

===Expectation values of operators on ''Ψ''===

The [[expectation value]] (equivalently the average or mean value) is the average measurement of an observable, for particle in region ''R''. The expectation value &lt;math&gt;\langle \hat{A} \rangle &lt;/math&gt; of the operator &lt;math&gt; \hat{A} &lt;/math&gt; is calculated from:&lt;ref name="Quantum Mechanics Demystified 2006"&gt;Quantum Mechanics Demystified, D. McMahon, Mc Graw Hill (USA), 2006, {{ISBN|0-07-145546-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\langle \hat{A} \rangle = \int_R \psi^{*}\left( \mathbf{r} \right ) \hat{A} \psi \left( \mathbf{r} \right ) \mathrm{d}^3\mathbf{r} = \langle \psi | \hat{A} | \psi \rangle .&lt;/math&gt;

This can be generalized to any function ''F'' of an operator:

:&lt;math&gt; \langle F ( \hat{A} ) \rangle = \int_R \psi(\mathbf{r})^{*} \left [ F ( \hat{A} ) \psi(\mathbf{r}) \right ] \mathrm{d}^3 \mathbf{r} = \langle \psi | F ( \hat{A} ) | \psi \rangle , &lt;/math&gt;

An example of ''F'' is the 2-fold action of ''A'' on ''ψ'', i.e. squaring an operator or doing it twice:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp; F(\hat{A}) = \hat{A}^2 \\
&amp; \Rightarrow \langle \hat{A}^2 \rangle = \int_R \psi^{*} \left( \mathbf{r} \right ) \hat{A}^2 \psi \left( \mathbf{r} \right ) \mathrm{d}^3\mathbf{r} = \langle \psi \vert \hat{A}^2 \vert \psi \rangle \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

===Hermitian operators===

{{Main|Self-adjoint operator}}

The definition of a [[Hermitian operator]] is:&lt;ref name="QUANTUM CHEMISRTY 1977"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{A} = \hat{A}^\dagger&lt;/math&gt;

Following from this, in bra–ket notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\langle \phi_i | \hat{A} | \phi_j \rangle = \langle \phi_j | \hat{A} | \phi_i \rangle^*.&lt;/math&gt;

Important properties of Hermitian operators include:

===Operators in matrix mechanics ===

An operator can be written in matrix form to map one basis vector to another. Since the operators are linear, the matrix is a [[linear transformation]] (aka transition matrix) between bases. Each basis element &lt;math&gt;\phi_j &lt;/math&gt; can be connected to another,&lt;ref name="Quantum Mechanics Demystified 2006"/&gt; by the expression:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{ij} = \langle \phi_i | \hat{A} | \phi_j \rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

which is a matrix element:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{A} = \begin{pmatrix}
A_{11} &amp; A_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{1n} \\
A_{21} &amp; A_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{2n} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
A_{n1} &amp; A_{n2} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{nn} \\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

A further property of a Hermitian operator is that eigenfunctions corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.&lt;ref name="QUANTUM CHEMISRTY 1977"/&gt; In matrix form, operators allow real eigenvalues to be found, corresponding to measurements. Orthogonality allows a suitable basis set of vectors to represent the state of the quantum system. The eigenvalues of the operator are also evaluated in the same way as for the square matrix, by solving the [[characteristic polynomial]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \det\left ( \hat{A} - a \hat{I} \right ) = 0 ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''I'' is the ''n'' × ''n'' [[identity matrix]], as an operator it corresponds to the identity operator. For a discrete basis:

:&lt;math&gt; \hat{I} = \sum_i |\phi_i\rangle\langle\phi_i|&lt;/math&gt;

while for a continuous basis:

:&lt;math&gt; \hat{I} = \int |\phi\rangle\langle\phi|d\phi&lt;/math&gt;

=== Inverse of an operator ===

A non-singular operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; has an inverse &lt;math&gt; \hat{A}^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; defined by:

:&lt;math&gt; \hat{A}\hat{A}^{-1} = \hat{A}^{-1}\hat{A} = \hat{I} &lt;/math&gt;

If an operator has no inverse, it is a singular operator. In a finite-dimensional space, an operator is non-singular if and only if its determinant is nonzero:

:&lt;math&gt; \det(\hat{A}) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;

and hence the determinant is zero for a singular operator.

===Table of QM operators===

The operators used in quantum mechanics are collected in the table below (see for example,&lt;ref name="QUANTUM CHEMISRTY 1977"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quanta: A handbook of concepts, P.W. Atkins, Oxford University Press, 1974, {{ISBN|0-19-855493-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The bold-face vectors with circumflexes are not [[unit vector]]s, they are 3-vector operators; all three spatial components taken together.

===Examples of applying quantum operators===

The procedure for extracting information from a wave function is as follows. Consider the momentum ''p'' of a particle as an example. The momentum operator in position basis in one dimension is:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{p} = -i\hbar\frac{\partial }{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;

Letting this act on ''ψ'' we obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{p} \psi = -i\hbar\frac{\partial }{\partial x} \psi ,&lt;/math&gt;

if ''ψ'' is an eigenfunction of &lt;math&gt;\hat{p}&lt;/math&gt;, then the momentum eigenvalue ''p'' is the value of the particle's momentum, found by:

:&lt;math&gt; -i\hbar\frac{\partial }{\partial x} \psi = p \psi.&lt;/math&gt;

For three dimensions the momentum operator uses the [[nabla symbol|nabla]] operator to become:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{p}} = -i\hbar\nabla .&lt;/math&gt;

In Cartesian coordinates (using the standard Cartesian basis vectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;) this can be written;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_\mathrm{x}\hat{p}_x + \mathbf{e}_\mathrm{y}\hat{p}_y + \mathbf{e}_\mathrm{z}\hat{p}_z = -i\hbar\left ( \mathbf{e}_\mathrm{x} \frac{\partial }{\partial x} + \mathbf{e}_\mathrm{y} \frac{\partial }{\partial y} + \mathbf{e}_\mathrm{z} \frac{\partial }{\partial z} \right ),&lt;/math&gt;

that is:

:&lt;math&gt; \hat{p}_x = -i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \quad \hat{p}_y = -i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial y} , \quad \hat{p}_z = -i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The process of finding eigenvalues is the same. Since this is a vector and operator equation, if ''ψ'' is an eigenfunction, then each component of the momentum operator will have an eigenvalue corresponding to that component of momentum. Acting &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\hat{p}} &lt;/math&gt; on ''ψ'' obtains:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\hat{p}_x \psi &amp; = -i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \psi = p_x \psi \\
\hat{p}_y \psi &amp; = -i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \psi = p_y \psi \\
\hat{p}_z \psi &amp; = -i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \psi = p_z \psi \\
\end{align} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

'''Peters's tube-nosed bat''' (''Harpiola grisea'') is a species of [[vesper bat]] in the family [[Vespertilionidae]], found in the [[Indian Subcontinent]], mainly in the [[Western Himalayas]]. They have [[wikt:Tube|tube]]-shaped [[nostrils]] (hence the name) which assist them with their feeding. They are brown with white-yellow and underparts and have specks of orange around their neck. While they are [[Bird#Resting and roosting|roosting]], their fur, which seems to appear as a dead plant, [[camouflage]]s them from [[predator]]s. They are 3.3-6.0&amp;nbsp;cm in length and have round heads, large eyes and soft fur. This bat is found in [[India]]. They are endangered due to clearing of the rain forests in which they live in and are not protected by the [[World Conservation Union]]. They feed on rain forest [[fruit]] and blossoms.

'''''Pioneer 2''''' was the last of the three project [[Pioneer program|Able space probes]] designed to probe [[Moon|lunar]] and [[Wiktionary:cislunar|cislunar]] space. Launch took place at 07:30:00 UTC on November 8, 1958. After ''Pioneer 1'' had failed due to guidance system deficiencies, the guidance system was modified with a Doppler command system to ensure more accurate commands and minimize trajectory errors. Once again, the first and second stage portion of the flight was uneventful, but&lt;ref name="STL Vol. 1"&gt;

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the third stage of the launch vehicle failed to ignite, making it impossible for ''Pioneer 2'' to achieve orbital velocity. An attempt to fire the vernier engines on the probe was unsuccessful and the [[spacecraft]] attained a maximum altitude of {{convert|1550|km|mi|abbr=on}} before reentering Earth's atmosphere at 28.7 N, 1.9 E over NW Africa. A small amount of data was obtained during the short flight, including evidence that the equatorial region around Earth has higher flux and higher energy radiation than previously considered and that the micrometeorite density is higher around Earth than in space. The reason for the third stage failure was unclear, but it was suspected that the firing command from the second stage, which contained the guidance package for the entire launch vehicle, was never received, possibly due to damage to electrical lines during staging.

== Spacecraft design ==
''Pioneer 2'' was nearly identical to ''[[Pioneer 1]]''. It consisted of a thin cylindrical midsection with a squat truncated [[cone (geometry)|cone]] [[frustum]] on each side. The cylinder was {{convert|74|cm|in|sp=us}} in diameter and the height from the top of one cone to the top of the opposite cone was {{convert|76|cm|in|sp=us}}. Along the axis of the spacecraft and protruding from the end of the lower cone was an {{convert|11|kg|lb|adj=on}} solid [[propellant]] injection rocket and rocket case, which formed the main structural member of the spacecraft. Eight small low-thrust solid propellant velocity adjustment rockets were mounted on the end of the upper cone in a ring assembly which could be jettisoned after use. A magnetic [[dipole antenna]] also protruded from the top of the upper cone. The shell was composed of laminated plastic. The total mass of the spacecraft after vernier separation but before injection rocket firing was {{convert|39.5|kg|lb}}.

The scientific instrument package had a mass of 15.6&amp;nbsp;kg (34.4&amp;nbsp;lb) and consisted of an STL image-scanning television system (which replaced the NOTS image scanning infrared television system on Pioneer 1), a proportional counter for radiation measurements, an [[ionization chamber]] to measure radiation in space, a diaphragm/microphone assembly to detect micrometeorites, a spin-coil [[magnetometer]] to measure [[magnetic field]]s to 5 microgauss, and temperature-variable resistors to record spacecraft internal conditions. The spacecraft was powered by [[nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium batteries]] for ignition of the rockets, [[silver-oxide battery|silver cell batteries]] for the television system, and [[mercury battery|mercury batteries]] for the remaining circuits. Radio transmission was at 108.06&amp;nbsp;MHz through a magnetic dipole antenna for the television system, telemetry, and doppler. Ground commands were received at 115&amp;nbsp;MHz. The spacecraft was to be [[spin-stabilized satellite|spin-stabilized]] at 1.8 revolutions per second, the spin direction approximately perpendicular to the [[geomagnetic meridian planes]] of the trajectory.

[[File:Six degrees of separation.svg|thumb|250px|Six degrees of separation.]]

'''Six degrees of separation''' is the idea that all living things and everything else in the world are six or fewer steps away from each other so that a chain of "[[friend of a friend|a friend of a friend]]" statements can be made to connect any two people in a maximum of six steps. It was originally set out by [[Frigyes Karinthy]] in 1929 and popularized in an eponymous [[Six Degrees of Separation (play)|1990 play]] written by [[John Guare]].  It is sometimes generalized to the average [[Path length|social distance]] being [[Logarithm|logarithmic]] in the size of the population.

== Early conceptions ==

=== Shrinking world ===
Theories on optimal design of cities, city traffic flows, neighborhoods, and demographics were in vogue after [[World War I]]. These{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;!--What does statism have to do with this? Has some paranoic Libertarian been at work even here? ... Formally, I'm requesting a citation for the claim that the Karinthy story is connected to "statism" in city design.--&gt; conjectures were expanded in 1929 by [[Hungary|Hungarian]] author [[Frigyes Karinthy]], who published a volume of short stories titled ''Everything is Different.'' One of these pieces was titled "Chains," or "Chain-Links." The story investigated{{snd}} in abstract, conceptual, and fictional terms{{snd}} many of the problems that would captivate future generations of mathematicians, sociologists, and physicists within the field of network theory.&lt;ref name=newman&gt;Newman, Mark, Albert-László Barabási, and Duncan J. Watts. 2006. ''The Structure and Dynamics of Networks.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bara/&gt; Due to technological advances in communications and travel, friendship networks could grow larger and span greater distances. In particular, Karinthy believed that the modern world was 'shrinking' due to this ever-increasing connectedness of human beings. He posited that despite great physical distances between the globe's individuals, the growing density of human networks made the actual social distance far smaller.&lt;ref&gt;Karinthy, Frigyes. (1929) "Chain Links."[https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/soc180%3Akarinthy-chain-links/Karinthy-Chain-Links_1929.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this hypothesis, Karinthy's characters believed that any two individuals could be connected through at most five acquaintances. In his story, the characters create a game out of this notion. He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A fascinating game grew out of this discussion. One of us suggested performing the following experiment to prove that the population of the Earth is closer together now than they have ever been before. We should select any person from the 1.5 billion inhabitants of the Earth – anyone, anywhere at all. He bet us that, using no more than ''five'' individuals, one of whom is a personal acquaintance, he could contact the selected individual using nothing except the network of personal acquaintances.&lt;ref name=karinthy&gt;Karinthy, Frigyes. ''Chain-Links.'' Translated from Hungarian and annotated by Adam Makkai and Enikö Jankó.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This idea both directly and indirectly influenced a great deal of early thought on [[social network]]s. Karinthy has been regarded as the originator of the notion of six degrees of separation.&lt;ref name=bara&gt;[http://www.nd.edu/~alb/ Barabási, Albert-László] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050304041427/http://www.nd.edu/~alb/ |date=2005-03-04 }}. 2003. ''[http://www.nd.edu/%7Enetworks/Linked/index.html Linked: How Everything is Connected to Everything Else and What It Means for Business, Science, and Everyday Life.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103151518/http://www.nd.edu/%7Enetworks/Linked/index.html |date=2007-01-03 }}'' New York: Plume.&lt;/ref&gt;
A related theory deals with the quality of connections, rather than their existence. The theory of [[three degrees of influence]] was created by Nicholas A. Christakis and James H. Fowler.{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}}

=== Small world ===
{{Main|Small-world experiment}}
Michael Gurevich conducted seminal work in his empirical study of the structure of social networks in his 1961 [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] PhD dissertation under [[Ithiel de Sola Pool]].&lt;ref&gt;Gurevich, M (1961) The Social Structure of Acquaintanceship Networks, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematician [[Manfred Kochen]], an Austrian who had been involved in urban design, extrapolated these empirical results in a mathematical manuscript, ''[[Contacts and Influences]]'',&lt;ref&gt;de Sola Pool, Ithiel, Kochen, Manfred (1978–1979)."Contacts and influence." ''Social Networks'' 1(1): 42&lt;/ref&gt; concluding that in a U.S.-sized population without social structure, "it is practically certain that any two individuals can contact one another by means of at most two intermediaries. In a [socially] structured population it is less likely but still seems probable. And perhaps for the whole world's population, probably only one more bridging individual should be needed." They subsequently constructed [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] simulations based on Gurevich's data, which recognized that both weak and strong acquaintance links are needed to model social structure. The simulations, carried out on the relatively limited computers of 1973, were nonetheless able to predict that a more realistic three degrees of separation existed across the U.S. population, foreshadowing the findings of American psychologist [[Stanley Milgram]].{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}}

Milgram continued Gurevich's experiments in acquaintanceship networks at [[Harvard University]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. Kochen and de Sola Pool's manuscript, ''Contacts and Influences'',&lt;ref&gt;de Sola Pool, Ithiel, Kochen, Manfred (1978–1979)."Contacts and Influence." ''Social Networks'' 1(1): 5–51&lt;/ref&gt; was conceived while both were working at the [[University of Paris]] in the early 1950s, during a time when Milgram visited and collaborated in their research. Their unpublished manuscript circulated among academics for over 20 years before publication in 1978. It formally articulated the mechanics of social networks, and explored the mathematical consequences of these (including the degree of connectedness). The manuscript left many significant questions about networks unresolved, and one of these was the number of degrees of separation in actual social networks.  Milgram took up the challenge on his return from [[Paris]], leading to the experiments reported in ''The Small World Problem'' &lt;ref name="Stanley Milgram 1968"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Milgram | first1 = Stanley | year = 1967 | title = The Small World Problem | url = | journal = Psychology Today | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 60–67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in popular science journal ''[[Psychology Today]]'', with a more rigorous version of the paper appearing in Sociometry two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Travers, Jeffrey, and Stanley Milgram, [http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/teaching/NetworkedLife/travers_milgram.pdf "An Experimental Study of the Small World Problem"], Sociometry 32(4, Dec. 1969):425–443&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Psychology Today'' article generated enormous publicity for the experiments, which are well known today, long after much of the formative work has been forgotten.

Milgram's article made famous&lt;ref name="Stanley Milgram 1968" /&gt; his 1967 set of experiments to investigate de Sola Pool and Kochen's "small world problem." Mathematician [[Benoit Mandelbrot]], born in [[Warsaw]], growing up in [[Poland]] then [[France]], was aware of the Statist [[rule of thumb]], and was also a colleague of de Sola Pool, Kochen and Milgram at the University of Paris during the early 1950s (Kochen brought Mandelbrot to work at the Institute for Advanced Study and later IBM in the U.S.). This circle of researchers was fascinated by the interconnectedness and "social capital" of human networks. Milgram's study results showed that people in the [[United States]] seemed to be connected by approximately three friendship links, on average, without speculating on global linkages; he never actually used the term "six degrees of separation." Since the ''Psychology Today'' article gave the experiments wide publicity, Milgram, Kochen, and [[Karinthy]] all had been incorrectly attributed as the origin of the notion of six degrees; the most likely popularizer of the term "six degrees of separation" would be [[John Guare]], who attributed the value '6' to [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]].&lt;ref name=SDS-R-01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/exhibitions/peggy-bacon|title= The concept of Six degrees of separation stretches back to Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi |publisher= |accessdate=16 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continued research: Small World Project ===
In 2003, [[Columbia University]] conducted an analogous experiment on social connectedness amongst Internet email users.  Their effort was named the Columbia Small World Project, and included 24,163 e-mail chains, aimed at 18 targets from 13 different countries around the world.&lt;ref name="dodds"&gt;Dodds, Muhamad, Watts (2003)."Small World Project," Science Magazine. pp.827-829, 8 August 2003 https://www.sciencemag.org/content/301/5634/827&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 100,000 people registered, but only 384 (0.4%) reached the final target.  Amongst the successful chains, while shorter lengths were more common some reached their target after only 7, 8, 9 or 10 steps.  Dodds et al. noted that participants (all of whom volunteers) were strongly biased towards existing models of Internet users{{#tag:ref|"More than half of all participants resided in North America and were middle class, professional, college educated, and Christian, reflecting commonly held notions of the Internet-using population"&lt;ref name="dodds"/&gt;|group=Note}} and that connectedness based on professional ties was much stronger than those within families or friendships.  The authors cite "lack of interest" as the predominating factor in the high attrition rate,{{#tag:ref|"suggesting lack of interest ... was the main reason" for the "extremely low completion rate"&lt;ref name="dodds"/&gt;|group=Note}} a finding consistent with earlier studies.&lt;ref name="kleinfeld"/&gt;

== Research ==
Several studies, such as [[Small world experiment|Milgram's small world experiment]], have been conducted to measure this connectedness empirically . The phrase "six degrees of separation" is often used as a synonym for the idea of the "small world" phenomenon.&lt;ref name=AFC-NA-21&gt;[[Steven Strogatz]], [[Duncan J. Watts]] and [[Albert-Laszlo Barabasi]] {{cite web |first =  |last =  |title =  explaining synchronicity, network theory, adaption of complex systems, Six Degrees, Small world phenomenon in the BBC Documentary |work = BBC  |url=http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/six-degrees-of-separation/|publisher= |page =  |accessdate=11 June 2012}} "Unfolding the science behind the idea of six degrees of separation"&lt;/ref&gt;

However, detractors argue that Milgram's experiment did not demonstrate such a link,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/more_or_less/5176698.stm BBC News: More Or Less: Connecting With People In Six Steps] 13 July 2006, "Judith Kleinfeld ... told us, that 95% of the letters sent out had failed to reach the target."&lt;/ref&gt; and the "six degrees" claim has been decried as an "academic [[urban myth]]".&lt;ref name="kleinfeld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~fienberg/Stat36-835/Kleinfeld_SWP.pdf|title=The Small World Problem|publisher=[[Society (journal)|Society (Springer)]], Social Science and Public Policy|author=[[Judith Kleinfeld|Judith S.

===Computer networks===
In 2001, [[Duncan Watts]], a professor at [[Columbia University]], attempted to recreate Milgram's experiment on the Internet, using an e-mail message as the "package" that needed to be delivered, with 48,000 senders and 19 targets (in 157 countries). Watts found that the average (though not maximum) number of intermediaries was around six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Duncan J Watts, Steven H Strogatz |year=1998 |title=Collective dynamics of 'small-world' networks |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v393/n6684/abs/393440a0.html |journal=Nature |pages=440–442 |doi=10.1038/30918 |pmid=9623998 |volume=393 |issue=6684|bibcode=1998Natur.393..440W }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2007 study by [[Jure Leskovec]] and [[Eric Horvitz]] examined a data set of instant messages composed of 30 billion conversations among 240 million people. They found the average path length among Microsoft Messenger users to be 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| arxiv=0803.0939| title=Planetary-Scale Views on an Instant-Messaging Network| author=Jure Leskovec and Eric Horvitz|date=June 2007| bibcode=2008arXiv0803.0939L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested by some commentators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masternewmedia.org/news/2006/03/20/the_power_of_open_participatory.htm|title=The Power Of Open Participatory Media And Why Mass Media Must Be Abandoned|author=Robin Good|work=Robin Good's Master New Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; that interlocking networks of computer mediated lateral communication could diffuse single messages to all interested users worldwide as per the 6 degrees of separation principle via Information Routing Groups, which are networks specifically designed to exploit this principle and lateral diffusion.

===An optimal algorithm to calculate degrees of separation in social networks===
Bakhshandeh ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Reza Bakhshandeh, Mehdi Samadi, Zohreh Azimifar, Jonathan Schaeffer, "[http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SOCS/SOCS11/paper/view/4031 Degrees of Separation in Social Networks]", Fourth Annual Symposium on Combinatorial Search, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; have addressed the search problem of identifying the degree of separation between two users in social networks such as Twitter. They have introduced new search techniques to provide optimal or near optimal solutions. The experiments are performed using Twitter, and they show an improvement of several orders of magnitude over greedy approaches. Their optimal algorithm finds an average degree of separation of 3.43 between two random Twitter users, requiring an average of only 67 requests for information over the Internet to Twitter. A near-optimal solution of length 3.88 can be found by making an average of 13.3 requests.

== Popularization ==
No longer limited strictly to academic or philosophical thinking, the notion of six degrees recently has become influential throughout [[popular culture]]. Further advances in communication technology – and particularly the Internet – have drawn great attention to social networks and human interconnectedness. As a result, many popular media sources have addressed the term. The following provide a brief outline of the ways such ideas have shaped popular culture.

===Popularization of offline practice===

====John Guare's ''Six Degrees of Separation''====
{{Main|Six Degrees of Separation (play)|Six Degrees of Separation (film)}}
American playwright [[John Guare]] wrote a play in 1990 and later released a film in 1993 that popularized it. It is Guare's most widely known work.{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}}

The play ruminates upon the idea that any two individuals are connected by at most five others. As one of the characters states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I read somewhere that everybody on this planet is separated by only six other people. Six degrees of separation between us and everyone else on this planet. The President of the United States, a gondolier in Venice, just fill in the names. I find it A) extremely comforting that we're so close, and B) like [[Chinese water torture]] that we're so close because you have to find the right six people to make the right connection... I am bound to everyone on this planet by a trail of six people.&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;Memorable quotes from ''Six Degrees of Separation.'' Accessed Nov. 11, 2006 from [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108149/quotes IMDB.com].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Guare, in interviews, attributed his awareness of the "six degrees" to Marconi.{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}} Although this idea had been circulating in various forms for decades, it is Guare's piece that is most responsible for popularizing the phrase "six degrees of separation."{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}} Following Guare's lead, many future television and film sources would later incorporate the notion into their stories.{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}}

[[J. J. Abrams]], the executive producer of television series ''[[Six Degrees]]'' and ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', played the role of Doug in the film adaptation of this play.{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}} Many of the play's themes are apparent in his television shows (see below).{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}}

====Kevin Bacon game====
The game "[[Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon]]"&lt;ref name=SDS-T-02&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/8704891/Six-degrees-of-separation-theory-tested-on-Facebook.html|title=Six degrees of separation' theory tested on Facebook|work=Telegraph|accessdate=7 May 2012|date=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was invented as a play on the concept: the goal is to link any actor to [[Kevin Bacon]] through no more than six connections, where two actors are connected if they have appeared in a movie or commercial together. It was created by three students at [[Albright College]] in Pennsylvania,&lt;ref name=SDS-T-03&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8560483/Actors-Hollywood-career-spawned-Six-Degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon.html|title=Actor's Hollywood career spawned 'Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon'|work=Telegraph|accessdate=7 May 2012|date=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who came up with the concept while watching ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]''. On September 13, 2012, Google made it possible to search for any given actor's 'Bacon Number' through their search engine.

Upon the arrival of the 4G mobile network in the United Kingdom, Kevin Bacon appears in several commercials for the [[EE (telecommunications company)|EE]] Network in which he links himself to several well known celebrities and TV shows in the UK.

====Six Degrees of Der Kommissar====
Music critics have fun tracing the history and dissecting the popular song "[[Der Kommissar (song)|Der Kommissar]]" which was first written and recorded by  Austrian musician [[Falco (musician)|Falco]] with German vocals in 1981, then passed on and reworked in English by British band [[After The Fire]] in 1982, then lyrically rewritten and renamed "Deep In The Dark" by [[Laura Branigan]] in 1983 in the U.S., then rerecorded in its traditional style in  2007 by [[Dale Bozzio]], who is the former lead singer of new wave band [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]].   In this situation, connections among six such diverse musical expressionists were generated through a song. In the beginning, the composer might never have thought that the song could spread so far. However, the six degree has demonstrated that "the small world" does exist.

====John L. Sullivan====
An early version involved former world Heavyweight boxing champion, John L. Sullivan, in which people would ask others to "shake the hand that shook the hand that shook the hand that shook the hand of 'the great John L.'"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesweetscience.com/component/content/article/41-articles-of-2005/1514-the-great-john-l-sullivan&lt;/ref&gt;

===Website and application===
==== Six Degrees of Wikipedia ====
In late February 2018, the website [https://www.sixdegreesofwikipedia.com www.SixDegreesOfWikipedia.com] was published by Jacob Wenger.  This site takes any two Wikipedia articles and finds the various hyperlink paths that interconnect the two in the least number of clicks.  It then shows each of the steps that were taken to do so and also presents a graphical display of the connections.  On March 14, 2018, the site stated that among searches up to that date (~half a million), there have been an average separation of 3.0190°.  From these, the number of searches that required six or more degrees was 1.417 percent.  It also stated that searches with no connection found was 1.07%, and this was attributed to certain articles being dead ends or having very few links.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sixdegreesofwikipedia.com/blog/search-results-analysis Insights On Hitler And More From The First 500,000 Searches] by Jacob Wenger, March 14, 2018 (Searches with the same start and end page were not included in this average, and neither were articles in which no connection was found.)&lt;/ref&gt;  (Wenger's open source code is available on GitHub, and this enabled other sites to copy the concept, such as [http://degreesofwikipedia.com/ degreesofwikipedia.com].)

==== Facebook ====
A [[Facebook]] platform application named "Six Degrees" was developed by Karl Bunyan, which calculates the degrees of separation between different people. It had over 5.8 million users, as seen from the group's page. The average separation for all users of the application is 5.73 degrees, whereas the maximum degree of separation is 12. The application has a "Search for Connections" window to input any name of a [[Facebook]] user, to which it then shows the chain of connections. In June 2009, Bunyan shut down the application, presumably due to issues with Facebook's caching policy; specifically, the policy prohibited the storing of friend lists for more than 24 hours, which would have made the application inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.karlbunyan.com/2009/06/24/six-degrees-come-in-your-time-is-up/|title=Six Degrees: come in, your time is up|work=K! - the blog of Karl Bunyan}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new version of the application became available at Six Degrees after Karl Bunyan gave permission to a group of developers led by Todd Chaffee to re-develop the application based on Facebook's revised policy on caching data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.facebook.com/sixdegreesearch|title=Six Degrees on Facebook - Facebook|work=facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidefacebook.com/2010/04/21/facebook-removing-24-hour-caching-policy-on-user-data-for-developers/|title=Facebook Removing 24 Hour Caching Policy on User Data for Developers|work=insidefacebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial version of the application was built at a Facebook Developers Garage London hackathon with [[Mark Zuckerberg]] in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.mikamai.co.uk/2010/06/mikamai-participates-with-zuck-in-london-facebook-hackathon/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120707013246/http://blog.mikamai.co.uk/2010/06/mikamai-participates-with-zuck-in-london-facebook-hackathon/ |archivedate=2012-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yahoo! Research Small World Experiment has been conducting an experiment and everyone with a Facebook account can take part in it. According to the research page, this research has the potential of resolving the still unresolved theory of six degrees of separation.&lt;ref name=SDS-T-02/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smallworld.sandbox.yahoo.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926141619/http://smallworld.sandbox.yahoo.com/ |archivedate=2011-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook's data team released two papers in November 2011 which document that amongst all Facebook users at the time of research (721 million users with 69 billion friendship links) there is an average distance of 4.74.&lt;ref name=SDS-T-01&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/8906693/Facebook-cuts-six-degrees-of-separation-to-four.html|title=Facebook cuts six degrees of separation to four|work=Telegraph|accessdate=7 May 2012|first=Emma|last=Barnett|date=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="facebook2016" /&gt; Probabilistic algorithms were applied on statistical metadata to verify the accuracy of the measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|arxiv=1111.4570|title=Four Degrees of Separation|last=Backstrom|first=Lars |author2=Boldi, Paolo |author3=Rosa, Marco |author4=Ugander, Johan |author5=Vigna, Sebastiano|date=2011-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also found that 99.91% of Facebook users were interconnected, forming a large connected component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|arxiv=1111.4503|title=The Anatomy of the Facebook Social Graph|last=Ugander|first=Johan|author2=Karrer, Brian |author3=Backstrom, Lars |author4= Marlow, Cameron }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== LinkedIn ====
The [[LinkedIn]] professional networking site operates the degree of separation one is away from a person with which he or she wishes to communicate. On [[LinkedIn]], one's network is made up of 1st-degree, 2nd-degree, and 3rd-degree connections and fellow members of LinkedIn Groups. In addition, LinkedIn notifies the user how many connections they and any other user have in common.

==== SixDegrees.com ====
[[SixDegrees.com]] was an early social-networking website that existed from 1997 to 2001. It allowed users to list friends, family members and acquaintances, send messages and post bulletin board items to people in their first, second, and third degrees, and see their connection to any other user on the site. At its height, it had 3,500,000 fully registered members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kirkpatrick |first1=David |title=[[The Facebook Effect]]: The Inside Story of the Company That Is Connecting the World | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster

==== Twitter ====
Users on Twitter can follow other users creating a network. According to a study of 5.2 billion such relationships by social media monitoring firm [[Sysomos]], the average distance on Twitter is 4.67. On average, about 50% of people on Twitter are only four steps away from each other, while nearly everyone is five steps or less away.&lt;ref&gt;Apr 30, 2010, [http://www.sysomos.com/insidetwitter/sixdegrees/ Six Degrees of Separation, Twitter Style], from [[Sysomos]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In another work, researchers have shown that the average distance of 1,500 random users in Twitter is 3.435. They calculated the distance between each pair of users using all the active users in Twitter.&lt;ref name=bakhsh&gt;Reza Bakhshandeh, Mehdi Samadi, Zohreh Azimifar, Jonathan Schaeffer ''[http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SOCS/SOCS11/paper/view/4031 Degrees of Separation in Social Networks.]'' Fourth Annual Symposium on Combinatorial Search, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematics==
Mathematicians use an analogous notion of ''[[collaboration distance]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationDistance.html|title=MR:  Collaboration Distance|work=ams.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; two persons are linked if they are coauthors of an article. The collaboration distance with mathematician Paul Erdős is called the [[Erdős number]]. [[Erdős-Bacon number]]s and Erdős-Bacon-Sabbath (EBS) numbers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://erdosbaconsabbath.com/|title=EBS Project|work=erdosbaconsabbath.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170724075829/http://erdosbaconsabbath.com/|archivedate=2017-07-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are further extensions of the same thinking.

[[Watts and Strogatz model|Watts and Strogatz]] showed that the average path length between two nodes in a [[random network]] is equal to {{math|ln ''N'' / ln ''K''}}, where {{math|''N''}} = total nodes and {{math|''K''}} = acquaintances per node. Thus if
{{math|''N''}} = 300,000,000 (90% of the US population) and {{math|''K''}} = 30 then ''Degrees of Separation'' = 19.5 / 3.4 = 5.7 and if {{math|''N''}} = 6,000,000,000 (90% of the World population) and {{math|''K''}} = 30 then ''Degrees of Separation'' = 22.5 / 3.4 = 6.6.
(Assume 10% of population is too young to participate.)

==Psychology==
A 2007 article published in ''The Industrial-Organizational Psychologist'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siop.org/tip/Oct07/Sheridan%20PDFs/452_029to035.pdf (Michel, 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt; by Jesse S. Michel from Michigan State University, applied Stanley Milgram's small world phenomenon (i.e., “small world problem”) to the field of [[Industrial and organizational psychology|I-O psychology]] through co-author publication linkages.  Following six criteria, Scott Highhouse (Bowling Green State University professor and fellow of the Society of Industrial and Organizational Psychology) was chosen as the target.  Co-author publication linkages were determined for (1) top authors within the I-O community, (2) quasi-random faculty members of highly productive I-O programs in North America, and (3) publication trends of the target.  Results suggest that the small world phenomenon is alive and well with mean linkages of 3.00 to top authors, mean linkages of 2.50 to quasi-random faculty members, and a relatively broad and non-repetitive set of co-author linkages for the target.  The author then provided a series of implications and suggestions for future research.

'''''The Collapse of Chaos: Discovering Simplicity in a Complex World''''' (1994) is a book about [[complex systems|complexity theory]] and the nature of [[scientific explanation]] written by [[biologist]] [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]] and [[mathematician]] [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]].

In this book Cohen and Stewart give their ideas on chaos theory, particularly on how the simple leads to the complex, and conversely, how the complex leads to the simple, and argue for a need for contextual explanation in science as a complement to reduction.  This book dovetails with other books written by the Cohen-Stewart team, particularly ''[[Figments of Reality]]''.

As with other Cohen-Stewart books, topics are illustrated with humorous science fiction snippets dealing with a fictional alien intelligence, the Zarathustrians, whom Cohen and Stewart use as metaphors of the human mind itself.

==Reception==
''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' commented, "Although the book assumes you have zero knowledge of science (and thus is a little patronizing in the early chapters), it presents the concepts of Complexity Theory as well as anything we've seen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first= |title=Essential Reading|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=23 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=November 1996|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Third-party technique''' is a marketing strategy employed by [[public relations]] (PR) firms, that involves placing a premeditated message in the "mouth of the media." Third-party technique can take many forms, ranging from the hiring of journalists to report the organization in a favorable light, to using scientists within the organization to present their perhaps prejudicial findings to the public.

Industry-sponsored groups used to relay these findings to the public are known as [[front groups]].  These groups claim to represent the general public’s agenda, when in reality they are facilitating the hidden interests of the organizations that are sponsoring them.  Also related are [[Astroturfing|astroturf groups]], which are groups that have been formed by the industry, yet appear to have been formed by ordinary citizens.

[[Edward Bernays]], the “father of public relation,” is also said to be the founder of using front groups as [[marketing]] techniques.  Bernays qualified the use of a reputable and prominent sponsoring groups in the statement, “The most useful method in a multiple society like ours to indicate the support of an idea of the many varied elements that make up our society. Opinion leaders and group leaders have an effect in a democracy and stand as symbols to their constituency."

The recent rise of the use of third-party technique has spurred the creation of groups such as [[PR Watch]], an organization that investigates and combats manipulative and misleading PR messages.
Third-party technique is often found within the drug and [[pharmaceutical industry]]. Journalists that may mistakenly report on these front groups' findings can unknowingly perpetuate the spread of biased information. The result is the perpetual exposure of doctors and patients to these carefully crafted messages.

In defense of the practice of third-party technique, public relations firms often qualify the use of a third-party to report on information as not putting words in the mouth of the media, but simply as mechanisms to display accurate information in a manner that the public will not see as biased towards the organization.  
"Developing third party support and validation for the basic risk messages of the corporation is essential. This support should ideally come from medical authorities, political leaders, union officials, relevant academics, fire and police officials, environmentalists, regulators,” says Amanda Little from the world’s fifth largest PR firm, [[Burson-Marsteller]].
