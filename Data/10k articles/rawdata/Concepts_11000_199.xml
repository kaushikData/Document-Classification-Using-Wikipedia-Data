'''Abhava''' means [[non-existence]], [[negation]], [[nothing]] or absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy|author=John A.Grimes|publisher=SUNY Press|page=3|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eP5p0ev3nJEC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=abhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YkonUazIJIf8rAeq44CYCQ&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=abhava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the negative of Bhava which means being, becoming, existing or appearance.

==Overview==
Uddayana divides ''[[Padārtha]]'' (Categories) into ''[[Bhava]]'' ([[existence]]) which is real, and ''Abhava'' ([[non-existence]]) which is not real. ''[[Dravya]]'' ([[Matter|substance]]), ''[[Guṇa]]'' (quality), ''[[Karma]]'' ([[Social actions|action]]), ''Samanya'' (community or generality), ''Visesa'' (particularity or partimerity) and ''Samavaya'' ([[inherence]]) are the marks of existence. ''Abhava'' has not been categorically defined by the [[Vaisheshika]] School of [[Hindu philosophy]] but is of four kinds viz – 1) ''Pragabhava'' i.e. Prior non-existence, 2) ''Pradhvamsabhava'' i.e. Posterior non-existence, 3) ''Atyantabhava'' i.e.  Absolute non-existence, and 4) ''[[Anyonyabhava]]'' i.e. Mutual non-existence.

# ''Pragabhava'' i.e. Prior non-existence, is the non-existence of an effect in its material cause before production; it has a beginning it has an end because it is destroyed by the production of the effect. Without prior non-existence there cannot be an effect.
# ''Pradhvamsabhava'' i.e.Posterior non-existence, is the non-existence of an effect by its destruction; as such it has a beginning but no end i.e. it cannot be destroyed.
# ''Atyantabhava'' i.e. Absolute non-existence, or absolute negation is non-existence in all times i.e. denial of an absolutely non-existent entity in all times and in all places. It is the state of absolute abstraction.
# ''[[Anyonyabhava]]'' i.e. Mutual non-existence, is denial of identity between two things, which have specific nature. [[Negation]] other than mutual negation is negation of relation.

The process with which the sound value collapses into the point value of the gap existing between the first and the next syllable of the first letter of the [[Rigveda]], ''Agnim'', is ''Pradhvamsabhava'', the silent point of all possibilities within the gap is ''Atyantabhava'', the structuring dynamics of what happens within the gap ''[[Anyonyabhava]]'', and the mechanics by which the sound emerges from the point value of the gap i.e. emergence of the following syllable, is ''Pragabhava''; this mechanism is inherent in both syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Plays about Famous Artists|author=Daniel Meyer Dinkgrafe|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Press|page=89|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wR50GEyHk-QC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=abhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YkonUazIJIf8rAeq44CYCQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=abhava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vaisheshika]], the [[Nyaya]], the Bhatta [[Mimamsa]] and [[Dvaita]] schools hold ''Abhava'' as a distinct category. Recognised as a reality by the Nyaya school, ''Abhava'' is often stated to be the reality of the greatest moment in the pluralistic universe and is connected with [[Moksha|Mukti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World Vol.1|author=Ganga Ram Garg|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|page=96|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=w9pmo51lRnYC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=abhava&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O8c7pBYtaP&amp;sig=BfLw4cirP6wV_7Rpusu11hE2MNM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9kInUe_KDsj5rAfSlYGwBw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=abhava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a relative word, for there can be ''abhava'' only when previously there is ''bhava''; moreover it is an event occurring in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=PrasannapadaE|author=Theodor Stcherbatsky|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=itTFXt6ZmVQC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=abhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YkonUazIJIf8rAeq44CYCQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=abhava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nagarjunian Disputations|author=Thomas E.

''Abhava'' is that unmanifest level from where the concrete ''Bhava'' arises or emerges. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mirror of Consciousness|author=Anna J. Bonshek|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=194|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sT13ws7RKgYC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;dq=abhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YkonUazIJIf8rAeq44CYCQ&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=abhava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vasubandhu]] has referred to ''[[Sunyata]]'' having the characteristic of the own-being of ''abhava'', rather than a characteristic consisting of ''bhava'' which [[Sthiramati]] observes is in fact not redundant, which means ''abhava'' does not negate ''bhava''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Buddhist Philosophy of the Middle|author=David S. Ruegg|publisher=Wisdom Publications|page=74|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LFSPAtt7OesC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=abhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YkonUazIJIf8rAeq44CYCQ&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=abhava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Abhava'' refers to particular entities and not to [[Being]] ; it is a theoretical or logical denial of the existence of some particular impossibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global History of Philosophy:The Axial Age Vol.1|author=John C. Plott|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=163|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ODPthacrp_cC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=abhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4FknUaqCNc6mrAfF34CoAw&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=abhava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The acceptance of abhava as an independent padartha having ontological reality of its own is a peculiar feature of Indian philosophical tradition. [[Dharmakirti]] considered ''abhava'' as an ''[[anumana]]''. He had brought in the idea of imaginary presence of that whose absence was apprehended in order to explain the specificity of the absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Contrary Thinking|author=Daya Krishna|page=125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a44AHKGef64C&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=abhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K10nUY_cOsLlrAfV2oGwDA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=abhava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antitheism''' (sometimes '''anti-theism''') is the opposition to [[theism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://atheism.about.com/od/atheismatheiststheism/a/AntiTheism.htm |title=Atheism and Anti-Theism: What's the Difference? What is Anti-Theism? |author=Austin Cline |publisher=[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/antitheism |title=antitheism |publisher=[[The Free Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has had a range of applications.  In [[secularism|secular]] contexts, it typically refers to direct opposition to the belief in any [[deity]].

==Opposition to theism==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines ''antitheist'' as "One opposed to belief in the existence of a god". The earliest citation given for this meaning dates from 1833.&lt;ref&gt;The Shorter OED (1970 reprint) page 78&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Antitheism'' has been adopted as a label by those who regard theism as dangerous, destructive, or encouraging of harmful behavior. [[Christopher Hitchens]] offers an example of this approach in ''[[Letters to a Young Contrarian]]'' (2001), in which he writes: "I'm not even an [[Atheism|atheist]] so much as I am an antitheist; I not only maintain that all religions are versions of the same untruth, but I hold that the influence of churches, and the effect of religious belief, is positively harmful."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to the idea of God==

Other definitions of antitheism include that of the French Catholic philosopher [[Jacques Maritain]] (1953) for whom it is "an active struggle against everything that reminds us of God" (p.&amp;nbsp;104), and that of [[Robert Flint]] (1877), Professor of Divinity at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Flint's [[Baird Lecture]] for 1877 was entitled ''Anti-Theistic Theories''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Flint| first=Robert| title=Anti-Theistic Theories: Being the [[Baird Lecture]] for 1877| edition=5| year=1894| location=London| publisher=William Blackwood and Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used it as a very general [[umbrella term]] for all opposition to his own form of theism, which he defined as the "belief that the heavens and the earth and all that they contain owe their existence and continuance to the wisdom and will of a supreme, self-existent, omnipotent, omniscient, righteous, and benevolent Being, who is distinct from, and independent of, what He has created."&lt;ref&gt;Flint, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In dealing with theories which have nothing in common except that they are antagonistic to theism, it is necessary to have a general term to designate them. Anti-theism appears to be the appropriate word. It is, of course, much more comprehensive in meaning than the term atheism. It applies to all systems which are opposed to theism. It includes, therefore, atheism, but short of atheism there are anti-theistic theories. Polytheism is not atheism, for it does not deny that there is a deity; but it is anti-theistic since it denies that there is only one. Pantheism is not atheism, for it asserts that there is a god; but it is anti-theism, for it denies that god is a being distinct from creation and possessed of such attributes as wisdom, and holiness, and love. Every theory which refuses to ascribe to a god an attribute which is essential to a worthy conception of its character is anti-theistic. Only those theories which refuse to acknowledge that there is evidence even for the existence of a god are atheistic.&lt;ref&gt;Flint, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Flint also acknowledges that antitheism is typically understood differently from how he defines it. In particular, he notes that it has been used as a subdivision of atheism, descriptive of the view that theism has been disproven, rather than as the more general term that Flint prefers. He rejects ''[[nontheism|non-theistic]]'' as an alternative, "not merely because of its hybrid origin and character, but also because it is far too comprehensive. Theories of physical and mental science are non-theistic, even when in no degree, directly or indirectly, antagonistic to theism."&lt;ref&gt;Flint, p. 444–445&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to the existence of a god or gods is frequently referred to as [[dystheism]] (which means "belief in a deity that is not benevolent") or [[misotheism]] (strictly speaking, this means "hatred of God"). Examples of belief systems founded on the principle of opposition to the existence of a god or gods include some forms of [[Atheistic Satanism]] and [[maltheism]].

==Other uses==
{{see also|Misotheism#Terminology}}
Another use of the term ''antitheism'' was coined by [[Christopher New]] in a thought experiment published in 1993. In his article, he imagines what arguments for the existence of an evil god would look like: "Antitheists, like theists, would have believed in an omnipotent, omniscient, eternal creator; but whereas theists in fact believe that the supreme being is also perfectly good, antitheists would have believed that he was perfectly evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=New| first=Christopher|date=June 1993| title=Antitheism – A Reflection| journal=Ratio| volume=6| issue=1| pages=36–43| doi=10.1111/j.1467-9329.1993.tb00051.x}}. See also: Daniels, Charles B. (1997). "God, demon, good, evil", ''The Journal of Value Inquiry'', Vol. 31 (2), June, pp.177–181.&lt;/ref&gt; New's usage has reappeared in the work of Wallace A. Murphree.&lt;ref&gt;Murphree, Wallace A. (1997). "[http://www.springerlink.com/content/n458676824862657/ Natural Theology: theism or antitheism]", ''Sophia'', Vol.36 (1), March, pp.75–83&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word "antitheism" (or the hyphenated "anti-theism") has been recorded in English since 1788.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=antitheism|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=antitheism&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[etymology|etymological]] roots of the word are the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[wikt:ἀντί|anti]]'' and ''[[wikt:θεός#Ancient Greek|theos]].''

An '''area chart''' or '''area graph''' displays graphically quantitative data. It is based on the [[line chart]]. The area between axis and line are commonly emphasized with colors, textures and hatchings. Commonly one compares two or more quantities with an area chart.

== History ==
[[William Playfair]] is usually credited with inventing the area charts as well as the [[Line chart|line]], [[Bar chart|bar]], and [[pie chart]]s. His book ''The Commercial and Political Atlas'', published in 1786, contained a number of [[time-series]] graphs, including ''Interest of the National Debt from the Revolution'' and ''Chart of all the Imports and Exports to and from England from the Year 1700 to 1782'' that are often described as the first area charts in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Playfair's Commercial and Political Atlas and Statistical Breviary|last1=Playfair|first1=William|last2=Wainer|first2=Howard|last3=Spence|first3=Ian|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|ISBN=9780521855549|location=|pages=|author-link1=William Playfair|author-link2=Howard Wainer|author-link3=Ian Spence (psychologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Visual Display of Quantitative Information|last=Tufte|first=Edward|publisher=Graphics Press|year=1983|ISBN=0961392142|location=Cheshire, Connecticut|page=13|pages=|author-link=Edward Tufte}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common uses ==

Area charts are used to represent cumulated totals using numbers or percentages (stacked area charts in this case) over time.
Use the area chart for showing trends over time among related attributes. The area chart is like the plot chart except that the area below the plotted line is filled in with color to indicate volume.

When multiple attributes are included, the first attribute is plotted as a line with color fill followed by the second attribute, and so on.

== Variations ==

Area charts which use vertical and horizontal lines to connect the data points in a series forming a step-like progression are called ''step-area charts''.

Area charts in which data points are connected by smooth curves instead of straight lines are called ''spline-area charts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Area, Spline-Area, Step-Area Charts | url=http://www.anychart.com/products/anychart/gallery/Area,_Spline-Area,_Step-Area_Charts/ | publisher=AnyChart | access-date=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Non-fatal offences against the person in English law}}

===The offence===

In England and Wales, and in Northern Ireland, the offence is created by section 47 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]]:

{{cquote|47. Whosoever shall be convicted upon an indictment of any assault occasioning actual bodily harm shall be liable ... to be kept in penal servitude ...; ... ...}}

The words "at the discretion of the court" omitted in the first place, and the words "for the term of three years, or to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years, with or without hard labour" omitted in the second place, were repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 1892]].

The words from "and" to the end, omitted in the third place, were repealed for England and Wales by section 170(2) of, and Schedule 16 to, the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]] (subject to section 123(6) of, and paragraph 16 of Schedule 8 to, that Act).

The words "with or without hard labour" at the end were repealed for England and Wales by section 1(2) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]].

The text of this section is slightly different in Northern Ireland.

====Assault====
The expression assault includes "[[Battery (crime)|battery]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 2009 edition, at paragraph 19-195. Thomson/Sweet &amp; Maxwell, London, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner]]'' was decided under section 51 of the [[Police Act 1964]], which also used the word "assault" without further explanation and without any explicit reference to battery. James J. said:

{{Blockquote|An assault is any act which intentionally—or possibly recklessly—causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence. Although "assault" is an independent crime and is to be treated as such, for practical purposes today "assault" is generally synonymous with the term "battery" and is a term used to mean the actual intended use of unlawful force to another person without his consent. On the facts of the present case the "assault" alleged involved a "battery."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner]]'' [1969] 1 QB 439 at 444D to E, [1968] 3 All ER 442 at 445&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''R v Williams (Gladstone)'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1983/4.html R v Williams (Gladstone)]'', (1983) 78 Cr App R 276, [1984] Crim LR 163, [[Court of Appeal|CA]] (28 November 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; the defendant was prosecuted for this offence. [[Lord Lane]] said:

{{Blockquote|"Assault" in the context of this case, that is to say using the word as a convenient abbreviation for assault and battery, is an act by which the defendant, intentionally or recklessly, applies unlawful force to the complainant.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1983/4.html R v Williams (Gladstone)]'', (1983) 78 Cr App R 276 at 279, [[Court of Appeal|CA]] (28 November 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''R v Burstow, R v Ireland'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/34.html R v Ireland, R v Burstow]'' [1998] 1 Cr App Rep 177, [1997] 3 WLR 534, [1998] AC 147, [1997] 4 All ER 225, ''[[The Times]]'' (1997) 25 July 1997, [[House of Lords|HL]]&lt;/ref&gt; one of the defendants was prosecuted for this offence. [[Lord Steyn]] said:

{{Blockquote|The starting point must be that an assault is an ingredient of the offence under section 47. It is necessary to consider the two forms which an assault may take. The first is battery, which involves the unlawful application of force by the defendant upon the victim. Usually, section 47 is used to prosecute in cases of this kind. The second form of assault is an act causing the victim to apprehend an imminent application of force upon her: see ''Fagan v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner'' [1969] 1 Q.B. 439, 444D-E.}}

The second form of assault referred to is the offence described as [[common assault]] in section 39 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]], which is also known as [[psychic assault]] or simply [[assault]].

====Occasioning====
[[Blackstone's Criminal Practice]], 2001, says that "occasioning" is equivalent to causing (para B2.21 at p.&amp;nbsp;172) and has a specimen form of indictment that uses the word "caused" (para B2.18 at p.&amp;nbsp;171).

In ''R v Roberts'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1971/4.html R v Roberts]'' (1971) 56 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr. App. R.]] 95, [[Court of Appeal|CA]]&lt;/ref&gt; the defendant gave a lift in his car, late at night, to a girl.

The girl said that while travelling in the defendant's car he sought to make advances towards her and then tried to take her coat off. She said that this was the last straw, and although the car was travelling at some speed, she jumped out and sustained injuries. The defendant said that he had not touched the girl. He said that he had had an argument with her and that in the course of that argument she suddenly opened the door and jumped out.&lt;ref&gt;This is how the facts are described in ''R v Savage''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Stephenson (judge)|Stephenson LJ]] said that the test for determining whether the defendant had "occasioned" the injuries that the girl had suffered as a result of jumping out of the car was this:

{{quote|Was it [the action of the victim which resulted in actual bodily harm] the natural result of what the alleged assailant said and did, in the sense that it was something that could reasonably have been foreseen as the consequence of what he was saying or doing? As it was put in one of the old cases, it had got to be shown to be his act, and if of course the victim does something so "daft" in the words of the appellant in this case, or so unexpected, not that this particular assailant did not actually foresee it but that no reasonable man could be expected to foresee it, then it is only in a very remote and unreal sense a consequence of his assault, it is really occasioned by a voluntary act on the part of the victim which could not reasonably be foreseen and which breaks the chain of causation between the assault and the harm or injury.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1971/4.html R v Roberts]'' (1971) 56 Cr. App. R. 95 at 102, [[Court of Appeal|CA]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This passage was set out in ''R v Savage, DPP v Parmenter'' at page 14.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1992/1.html R v Savage, DPP v Parmenter]'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The book "Archbold" says that this test applies to any case where the injury was not the direct result of the defendant's act.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, paragraph 19-195 at page 1612&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''R v Savage'', ''DPP v Parmenter'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1992/1.html ''R v Savage'', ''DPP v Parmenter''] [1992] 1 AC 699, [1991] 3 WLR 914, [1991] 4 All ER 698, (1991) 94 Cr App R 193, [1992] Crim LR 288, [[House of Lords|HL]]&lt;/ref&gt; Savage threw beer over the victim and, in the struggle, the glass broke and cut the victim. It was held that section 47 did not require proof of [[recklessness (law)|recklessness]] in relation to the "occasioning". The throwing of the beer was an assault, and that "assault" had occasioned the actual bodily harm which occurred in the continuing struggle. Parmenter injured his baby by tossing him about too roughly. Even though the baby was too young to apprehend the physical contact, there was voluntary contact that caused injury, so Parmenter was liable under section 47 because the injury resulted from his intention to play with his son.

====Actual bodily harm====

{{main|Bodily harm}}

In ''Rex v. Donovan'',&lt;ref&gt;''Rex v. Donovan'' [1934] 2 KB 498, 25 Cr App R 1, 30 [[Cox's Criminal Cases|Cox]] 187, 50 TLR 566, [[Court of Criminal Appeal|CCA]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Swift J., in delivering the Judgement of the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]], said:

{{quote|For this purpose, we think that "bodily harm" has its ordinary meaning and includes any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of the prosecutor. Such hurt or injury need not be permanent, but must, no doubt, be more than merely transient and trifling.&lt;ref&gt;''Rex v. Donovan'' [1934] 2 KB 498 at 509, [[Court of Criminal Appeal|CCA]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This passage was cited and approved in ''[[R v Brown]] (Anthony)'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1992/7.html ''R v. Brown (Anthony)''] [1994] 1 AC 212&lt;/ref&gt; by Lord Templeman (at p.&amp;nbsp;230) and Lord Jauncey (at p.&amp;nbsp;242).

In ''R v. Miller'' [1954] 2 All ER 529, [1954] 2 QB 282, Lynskey J. said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;According to ''Archbold's Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice'', 32nd ed, p 959:

"Actual bodily harm includes any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of the prosecutor..."&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However the House of Lords rejected this definition in ''DPP v. Smith'',&lt;ref&gt;''DPP v. Smith'' [1961] AC 290&lt;/ref&gt; a case of grievous bodily harm in which the trial judge had described grievous bodily harm as "some harm which will seriously interfere for a time with health or comfort." The Lord Chancellor, Viscount Kilmuir QC, held:

{{quote|I can find no warrant for giving the words 'grievous bodily harm' a meaning other than that which the words convey in their ordinary natural meaning. 'Bodily harm' needs no explanation, and 'grievous' means no more and no less than 'really serious'.}}

''DPP v. Smith'' was followed in ''R v. Chan-Fook''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1993/1.html R v. Chan-Fook]'' [1994] 2 All ER at 557D&lt;/ref&gt; Hobhouse LJ. said of the expression "actual bodily harm", in contending that it should be given its ordinary meaning:

{{quote|We consider that the same is true of the phrase "actual bodily harm". These are three words of the English language that receive no elaboration and in the ordinary course should not receive any. The word "harm" is a synonym for injury. The word "actual" indicates that the injury (although there is no need for it to be permanent) should not be so trivial as to be wholly insignificant.}}

He went on to say:

{{quote|The danger of any elaboration of the words of the statute is that it may have the effect, as was pointed out by the House of Lords, of altering, or at the least distracting the Jury from, the ordinary meaning of the words. Further, as can be seen from the summing-up in the present case, there may be an elision of the need to show some harm or injury. There will be a risk that language will be used which suggests to the Jury that it is sufficient that the assault has interfered with the heath or comfort of the victim, whether or not any injury or hurt has been caused.}}

''R v Chan-Fook'' also followed the case of ''R v Metharam'',&lt;ref&gt;''R v Metharam'' 45 Cr App R 304&lt;/ref&gt; in which Ashworth J had said:

{{quote|It is a misdirection to adopt the old formula and invite a jury to find a man accused of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm guilty if the only intent established is one to interfere seriously with the health or comfort.}}

In ''R v. Morris (Clarence Barrington)'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1997/2564.html R v. Morris (Clarence Barrington)]'' [1998] Cr. App. R. 386 at 393&lt;/ref&gt; Potter LJ., in delivering the judgement of the Court of Appeal said (the citations that he quotes from the textbook are omitted):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;What constitutes "actual bodily harm" for the purposes of section 47 of the 1861 Act is succinctly and accurately set out in ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice|Archbold]]'' (1997 ed.) at para 19-197:

"Bodily harm has it ordinary meaning and includes any ''hurt'' (our emphasis) or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of the victim: such hurt or injury need not be permanent, but must be more than merely transient or trifling ...

Actual bodily harm is capable of including psychiatric injury but it does not include mere emotion, such as fear, distress or panic ..."&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''DPP v. Smith (Michael Ross)'',&lt;ref&gt;''DPP v. Smith (Michael Ross)'' [2006] EWHC 94 (Admin), [2006] 2 Cr App R. 2, [[Divisional Court|DC]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Igor Judge, Baron Judge|Judge P.]] said:

{{quote|"Actual", as defined in the authorities, means that the bodily harm must not be so trivial or trifling as to be effectively without significance.&lt;ref&gt;''DPP v Smith (Michael Ross)'' [2006] 2 Cr App R 2 at paragraph 17, DC&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Glanville Williams said that actual bodily harm is a silly expression because it suggests that there is some form of bodily harm that is not actual.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville Williams. Textbook of Criminal Law. First Edition. Stevens &amp; Sons. London. 1978. Page 154. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8KpKAQAAIAAJ Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Cutting hair =====

In ''DPP v Smith (Michael Ross)'', the defendant held down his former girlfriend and cut off her ponytail with kitchen scissors a few weeks before her 21st birthday.{{fact|date=June 2017}} The Magistrates acquitted him on the ground that, although there was undoubtedly an assault, it had not caused actual bodily harm, since there was no bruising or bleeding, and no evidence of any psychological or psychiatric harm. The victim’s distress did not amount to bodily harm. The Divisional Court allowed an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions, rejecting the argument for the defendant that the hair was dead tissue above the scalp and so no harm was done. Judge P said:

{{quote|In my judgment, whether it is alive beneath the surface of the skin or dead tissue above the surface of the skin, the hair is an attribute and part of the human body. It is intrinsic to each individual and to the identity of each individual. Although it is not essential to my decision, I note that an individual's hair is relevant to his or her autonomy. Some regard it as their crowning glory. Admirers may so regard it in the object of their affections. Even if, medically and scientifically speaking, the hair above the surface of the scalp is no more than dead tissue, it remains part of the body and is attached to it. While it is so attached, in my judgment it falls within the meaning of "bodily" in the phrase "actual bodily harm". It is concerned with the body of the individual victim.}}{{fact|date=June 2017}}

It has been accepted that actual bodily harm includes any hurt or injury that interferes with the health or comfort of the victim, and which is more than transient or trifling. To damage an important physical aspect of a person’s bodily integrity must amount to actual bodily harm, even if the element damaged is dead skin or tissue. As Creswell J. commented in his short concurring judgment:

{{quote|To a woman her hair is a vitally important part of her body. Where a significant portion of a woman's hair is cut off without her consent, this is a serious matter amounting to actual (not trivial or insignificant) bodily harm.}}

=====CPS charging standards=====
The Crown Prosecution Service has revised the guidance in its publication "Offences Against the Person, Incorporating the Charging Standard" due to the enactment of section 58 of the [[Children Act 2004]] which provides that reasonable [[chastisement]] is not a defence to the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Assertions at that time that minor injuries to children could be charged as actual bodily harm were withdrawn in 2011.

The CPS previously advised that an assault which resulted in nothing more than grazes, scratches, abrasions, minor bruising, swellings, reddening of the skin, superficial cuts or a black eye should be prosecuted as a common assault in the absence of aggravating factors other than injury.&lt;ref&gt;Ormerod, D. Smith and Hogan's Criminal Law. Thirteenth Edition. Oxford University Press. 2011. Page 620. The guidance was located at www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/offences_against_the_person/#P48_1458.&lt;/ref&gt;

The charging standard states: "The offence of Common Assault carries a maximum penalty of six months’ imprisonment. This will provide the court with adequate sentencing powers in most cases. '''ABH should generally be charged where the injuries and overall circumstances indicate that the offence merits clearly more than six months; imprisonment and where the prosecution intend to represent that the case is not suitable for summary trial.'''"

And in reference to vulnerable victims such as children:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There may be exceptional cases where the injuries suffered by a victim are not serious and would usually amount to Common Assault but due to the presence of significant aggravating features (alone or in combination), they could more appropriately be charged as ABH contrary to section 47 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. This would '''only''' be where a sentence clearly in excess of six months' imprisonment ought to be available, having regard to the significant aggravating features.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The CPS also previously said that, by way of example, it considered the following injuries to be actual bodily harm and to be sufficiently serious that they could not be adequately reflected by a charge of [[common assault]] and ought normally to be prosecuted under section 47:

* The loss or breaking of a tooth or teeth
* Extensive or multiple [[bruise|bruising]]
* A displaced [[nosebleed|broken nose]]
* Minor [[bone fracture|fractures]] of bones
* Minor (but not superficial) cuts requiring medical treatment
* A recognised [[psychiatric disorder]]

Causing any of these injuries (by assault or battery) would constitute the [[actus reus]] of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

===Mens rea===

The [[mens rea]] of this offence is identical to that of assault or battery (depending on the mode by which the offence is committed). Accordingly, it does not correspond with the [[actus reus]]. Academic writers have termed this feature of the offence ''half mens rea''&lt;ref&gt;[[Glanville Williams]], ''Textbook of the Criminal Law'', 2 ed., 1983 p.192&lt;/ref&gt; and ''constructive liability''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith&amp;Hogan (2008). ''Criminal law text and materials'' (3rd ed.). OUP, New York, p.608&lt;/ref&gt;

The mens rea for this crime may be one of recklessness rather than [[intention (criminal law)|intention]] as to the commission of an assault or battery, and it is considered to be a crime of [[basic intent]].

The court in ''DPP v Parmenter'' ruled that, for this offence,

{{quote|...it is not necessary to show that Parmenter intended bodily harm; if he intended or was reckless as to the assault, and the actual bodily harm was a reasonably foreseeable result (whether or not it was or should have been foreseen by Parmenter himself), that is sufficient.}}

===Mode of trial===

In England and Wales, assault occasioning actual bodily harm is [[hybrid offence|triable either way]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]] (c.43), section 17(1) and Schedule 1,  paragraph 5(h)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sentence===

In England and Wales, a person guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c.100), section 47; the [[Penal Servitude Act 1891]] (54 &amp; 55 Vict. c.69), section 1(1); the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]] (11 &amp; 12 Geo.6 c.58), section 1(1)&lt;/ref&gt; or on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the [[prescribed sum]], or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]] (c.43), section 32(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a person is convicted on indictment of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, other than an offence for which the sentence falls to be imposed under section 227 or 228 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], the court, if not precluded from sentencing an offender by its exercise of some other power, may impose a fine instead of or in addition to dealing with him in any other way in which the court has power to deal with him, subject however to any enactment requiring the offender to be dealt with in a particular way.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], section 163; this power was previously created by section 30(1) of the [[Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973]] and then by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/6/section/127 section 127] of the [[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Assault occasioning actual bodily harm is a specified offence for the purposes of chapter 5 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] because it is a specified violent offence.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], section 224(1) as read with section 224(3) and paragraph 20 Part 1 of Schedule 15&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a serious offence for the purposes of that Chapter because it is not, apart from section 225, punishable in the case of a person aged 18 or over by imprisonment for life, or by imprisonment for a determinate period of ten years or more.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], section 224(2)&lt;/ref&gt; This means that sections 227 and 228 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] (which relate to extended sentences) apply where a person is convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, committed after the commencement of section 227 or 228 (as the case may be) and the court considers that there is a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission by the offender of further specified offences.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], sections 227(1) and 228(1)(a) and (b)(i)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is inappropriate for the court to sentence an offender on the basis of racial aggravation where he has been convicted of this offence, but not the racially aggravated offence: ''R v. McGilliviray''; ''R v. Kentsch''.

In Northern Ireland, a person guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c.100), section 47; as amended by the [[Criminal Justice (No.2) (Northern Ireland) Order 2004]] (SI 2004/1991 (N.I.15)), article 4(2)(a)&lt;/ref&gt; or on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months, or to a fine not exceeding the prescribed sum, or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Magistrates' Courts (Northern Ireland) Order 1981]] (No.1675 (N.I.26)), article 46(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racially or religiously aggravated offence===

In England and Wales, section 29(1)(b) of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]] (c.37) creates the distinct offence of [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998#Racially or religiously aggravated offences|racially or religiously aggravated assault occasioning actual bodily harm]].

===Visiting Forces===

In England and Wales and Northern Ireland, assault occasioning actual bodily harm is an [[offence against the person]] for the purposes of section 3 of the [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6and1Eliz2/15-16/67/section/3 section 3(6)] and Schedule, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6and1Eliz2/15-16/67/schedule/paragraph/1 paragraph 1(b)(i)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivative offences==

In a number of jurisdictions this offence has been replaced by an offence which is very similar.

=== Australia ===

South Australia's section 20(4) of the [[Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935]] creates the offence of [[assault causing harm]].

=== Canada ===

Section 267(b) of the Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']] creates the offence of [[assault causing bodily harm]].

=== Republic of Ireland ===

Section 3 of the [[Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997]] (No.26) creates the offence of [[assault causing harm]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2604">{{About|a design technique||Forcing function (disambiguation){{!}}Forcing function}} 
A '''behavior-shaping constraint''', also sometimes referred to as a '''forcing function''' or [[poka-yoke]], is a technique used in [[error-tolerant design]] to prevent the user from making common [[error]]s or mistakes.  One example is the reverse lockout on the transmission of a moving [[automobile]].

The microwave oven provides another example of a forcing function.  In all modern microwave ovens, it is impossible to start the microwave while the door is still open.  Likewise, the microwave will shut off automatically if the door is opened by the user.  By forcing the user to close the microwave door while it is in use, it becomes impossible for the user to err by leaving the door open.  Forcing functions are very effective in safety critical situations such as this, but can cause confusion in more complex systems that do not inform the user of the error that has been made.

When automobiles first started shipping with on-board GPS systems, it was not uncommon to use a forcing function which prevented the user from interacting with the GPS (such as entering in a destination) while the car was in motion.  This ensures that the driver's attention is not distracted by the GPS.  However, many drivers found this feature irksome, and the forcing function has largely been abandoned.  This reinforces the idea that forcing functions are not always the best approach to shaping behavior.

These forcing functions are being used in the service industry as well.  [[Call centers]] concerned with [[credit card fraud]] and [[friendly fraud]] are using [[agent-assisted automation]] to prevent the agent from seeing or hearing the credit card information so that it cannot be stolen.  The customer punches the information into their phone keypad, the tones are masked to the agent and are not visible in the [[customer relationship management]] software.&lt;ref name="adsit"&gt;{{cite news | last=Adsit | first=Dennis| url= http://www.isixsigma.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=1854&amp;Itemid=1&amp;Itemid=1| title= Error-proofing strategies for managing call center fraud | work= isixsigma.com |date= February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3560">[[Image:Hogsta domstolen Stockholm.jpg|thumb|300px|'''The Supreme Court''' ([[Högsta Domstolen]]) in Stockholm, Sweden, where the case was handled.]]

'''Bibeltemplet''' (the Bible temple) is a [[Christian]] [[website]] in [[Sweden]], whose administrator Leif Liljeström was sentenced in April 2005 to two months in prison for holding and expressing critical views on [[homosexuality]]. The case was appealed twice, and the [[Supreme Court of Sweden]] acquitted Liljeström in November 2007.

==Court of first instance==
According to the lower court in 2005, the administrator was guilty of "incitement against a group of people" for statements he himself had written, and for crime against "the law on [[Internet forum|electronic bulletin boards]]", for guest-messages which he neglected to delete. Liljeström told the court that his purpose is to preach the [[gospel]] and win people for [[Jesus]], and that the truth is needed to awake people. Among the statements that led to the verdict were the following: "The modern homophilia is the source and engine behind the [[AIDS]]-epidemic", and "AIDS is a punishment from [[God]] against [[sodomy]]". The view that there should be a "[[death penalty]] for homosexual acts" was also uttered on the website by a guest, but that was repudiated by Leif Liljeström directly in the forum. Still, he was convicted to prison also for the guest's statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2005/5/prweb239651.htm |title=Prison For {{sic|nolink=y|Critizism|expected=Criticism}} Against Homosexuality |publisher= [[PRWeb]] |date=2005-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71410.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appeals Court==
In April 2006, an appeals court in [[Gothenburg]] acquitted Liljestrom of the hate-speech and website content charges, but found him guilty of being an accomplice to hate-speech for allowing third parties to post offensive material on his website. The appeals court sentenced Liljestrom to one month's imprisonment.

==The Supreme Court==
Liljestrom then filed an appeal to the Gothenburg court decision. The Supreme Court in [[Stockholm]] decided to accept the case, and on November 7, 2007, after more than four years of struggle (counting from the day he was reported to the police in October, 2003), he was finally acquitted of all charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/9026/20071107/ The Local: "Christian web editor cleared of hate speech"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Ruth Gledhill]] |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article2825811.ece |title=Christian web editor in gay row wins appeal |date=2007-11-07 |work=[[The Times]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case has many similarities with the case of [[Åke Green]], and is expected to be seen as a guideline for coming justice in Sweden.

'''Case Solvers''' is a company founded in September 2012 and run by young Hungarian professionals{{Who|date=March 2018}}. Case Solvers' mission is to train young [[problem solver]]s, and to create a platform between graduates and the actors of the labor market. The organization was called Hungarian Business Case Society until 2013, then it gradually took up the name 'Case Solvers'. The team of 35 young Hungarians held more than 250 trainings to talented university students in 27 countries by 2017.

== History ==
Case Solvers was founded as Hungarian Business Case Society in September 2012 by Zsolt Ábrahám, Gergely Balázs and István Juhász.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forbes.hu/extra/forbes30/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the organization functioned as a blog where professional articles about case solving were published continually. The page, case-study.hu aimed to spread case solving as a teaching method among Hungarian and international business students as well.

Case Solvers (then known as HBCS) held its first training at the College of Management ([[Hungary]]) in March 2013, which was soon followed by several case interview trainings. The team organized its first case study camp, the Case Camp in August 2013. Within a year, Case Solvers held training courses in its home country's most prestigious business universities and prepared top teams for national and international case study competitions.

HBCS held its first training course as Case Solvers in November 2013, in India. The first training was soon followed by another in Romania, then in the Netherlands. By 2017, Case Solvers held more than 250 trainings in 27 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://24.hu/fn/uzleti-tippek/2017/04/29/case-solvers-a-fiatal-magyar-ceg-amely-evente-duplazza-a-beveteleit-vilagszerte/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trainings ==
One of the main activities of Case Solvers is training business students in case solving. There are two main groups of trainings: Case Solving Training and Case Interview Training.

=== Case-solving training ===
Conventional case solving training, where problem solving, structured thinking and logical deduction are the obtainable skills. The case solver's task is to give a solution for an ill-structured, complex business problem, that they also need to present in front of a professional jury. Case Solvers hold trainings in several formats: from one afternoon they can even last a whole weekend. The amount and complexity of the material taught on trainings depend on the length of the training. Case Solvers often prepares teams for specific case competitions, both national and international ones.

=== Case-interview training ===
Corporations, multinationals and consulting firms are likely to choose between candidates based on case interviews. The point is that job candidates must find a solution to a problem during the interview. This is usually a real problem that the interviewer has already faced in the company. The case interviews are perfect for assessing the candidate's abilities. At certain companies, this is a key point in the recruitment process, therefore careful preparation is required from the applicant.

Case interview trainings by Case Solvers prepare for situations like this: students can learn the methods of case interviewing by professionals, who have already undergone similar situations and who are currently working in the most prestigious consulting firms or multinational companies themselves. Case Interview Training – similar to Case Solving – could last from just a half-day up to an entire weekend as well. The amount and complexity of the material taught depends on the length of the training.

=== Investment-banking training ===
IB Day is about revealing the mystery of investment banks by showing training participants what they actually do, and how their recruitment and hiring processes work.

== Case competitions ==
In addition to preparing teams for national and international case competitions, Case Solvers also organizes its own competitions.

=== Case Solver of the Year ranking and competition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://evesetoldoja.hu/|title=Az év esetoldója|last=Solvers|first=Case|website=evesetoldoja.hu|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
The Case Solver of The Year Ranking (founded in 2013) aims to differentiate the case study competitions in Hungary and to make the competitor's performance measurable. The ranking is proposed to present the most successful competitors of the given year to the public, who are among Hungary's best case solvers based on their performance in case study competitions. The most prestigious case competitions of the academic year are the ones that matter in the Ranking.

Case Solver of the Year, the final competition organized by Case Solvers and Vialto Consulting is an invitational competition.  The event aims to create a platform for the country's top case solvers where they can challenge themselves against the other outstanding students from the Case Solver of The Year Ranking. The contestant with the highest score gets a trophy for being the Case Solver of The Year.

Former case studies of the Case Solver of The Year Competition:

'''2014: Gránit Bank'''

'''2015: Budapesti Közlekedési Központ (Centre for Budapest Transport)'''

'''2016: Hungarian Telekom'''

'''2017: ENKSZ'''

=== Solvers’ Cup&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://solverscup.com/|title=What they said about Solvers' Cup 2016 – Solvers' Cup|website=Solvers' Cup|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Solvers' Cup is Hungary's unique international case competition both as an invitational and online competition, which was first organized in 2016. The invitational part of Solvers' Cup, which included teams from Europe's top universities was held in Budapest, at the Corvinus University. Competitors were representatives of Consulting Clubs from for example Oxford and St. Gallen, as well as Czech, Austrian and Hungarian teams, among others. During the three-day event, participants had to provide a solution to a complex business problem followed by two rounds of presentations in front of the professional jury. Among the jury members we could find the dean of the Corvinus University and representatives of Loxon Solutions, DHL Consulting, Roland Berger, PwC, Philip Morris and Ringier Axel Springer.

Case Solvers created an online surface to give an opportunity for case solvers all over the world to join the contest. The 130 registered students had the same task as the invited competitors, but the case solving time was only 10 hours long for them. The online competition gave a chance to participate and to experience dynamic thinking and quick decision-making given the short deadline to all those who did not have the opportunity to compete personally in Budapest. Considering the first year's success, Case Solvers intents to organize Solvers' Cup every year from now on.

== Research ==
Case Solvers continuously publishes international research related to case solving and the expectations of the young generation at work. The research is aimed to inform the key actors of the labor market and to transfer their accumulated international knowledge.

=== Career ambitions report ===
Case Solvers' team first published an English report – Career Ambitions Report – on career expectations of the young entrants of the labor market in March 2016. The survey is made up of three modules:

1.      How students collect information

2.      How students evaluate information

3.      The key aspects of the students’ decision-making process

The 2015 survey reflects the opinion of the youth interested in management consulting from six countries (Hungary, Romania, Switzerland, the Netherlands, India and Ukraine), while the report of 2016 was enlarged by university students of three other countries: Brazil, Argentina and the South African Republic.

=== Case study report&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://case-study.hu/hu/csapat/esetversenyek-riport-2016|title=Esetversenyek riport 2016|date=22 November 2016|work=CASE STUDY|access-date=2017-12-23|language=hu-HU}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Case competitions play every year more important role in the life of business students. The good results achieved in these competitions become an advantage when it comes to finding a job, especially in the consulting area. Case Solvers' research covers the current situation of the Hungarian case competitions, as well as the motivations and opinion of the participants.

The survey was based on interviews and questionnaires, overall it summarizes the opinion of more than a hundred university students. The main conclusions are the following: every year there are a significant increase in the number of case competitions in Hungary, and the main motivation of the competitors is to gain professional experience.

== Corporate social responsibility ==
Case Solvers placed great emphasis on the development of the Hungarian youth from the beginning. In December 2013, they co-founded the National Secondary School Problem Solving Contest (Országos Középiskolai Problémamegoldó Verseny) with Mathias Corvinus Collegium, and they launched the “Where to continue my studies?” (Hol tanuljak tovább?, HTT) initiative in November 2014. To support these projects, Problema Solvenda Foundation was established in January 2016 with the purpose of educating Hungarian high school students.

=== HTT program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://holtanuljaktovabb.hu/|title=Hol Tanuljak Tovább? {{!}} Amit minden diáknak érdemes elolvasnia|website=holtanuljaktovabb.hu|language=hu|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
HTT is a non-profit project of Case Solvers that helps secondary school students make thoughtful decisions about their further studies. On the program's website, people with different fields of education and profession talk about their every day working lives, bringing it closer to graduating students.

=== OKPV – National Secondary School Problem Solving Contest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrportal.hu/hr/ez-a-startup-megoldja-a-problemait-20150805.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===

Net-poetry project ''Karenina it'' (1998)&lt;ref&gt;[http://xoomer.virgilio.it/kareninazoom/kareninarivista.html Karenina.it Experimental] Accessed August 24, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; was the first art-poetry-communication project presented on the web in an Italian context; the website was not a simple cultural on-line journal, but a "space of aggregation", which hosted an ongoing discourse, involving emerging and established experimental artists, critics, and visual poets. The communication aspect was treated as an artistic medium that goes beyond the contents or the quality of the words: borders among art, critic, and communication, in Davinio's own concept, were cancelled. The flow of words and information became art in itself, transcending the necessity to view art in traditional terms of form.&lt;ref&gt;"CommunicAction and Perspectives on Modern Web Literary Avant-Garde", by [[Enrico Gianfranchi]], in Digital Visions Festival, [[Sylvia Borda]] director, [[University of British Columbia]] [http://www.ontherundesign.com/Artists/Caterina_Davinio.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
The suffix ".it" present in Karenina.it title is a geographic locator for the origin of the website. The value of the site resides within the conceptual framework of the [[Fluxus]] art movement."&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Gianfranchi, in Digital Visions Festival, [[Sylvia Borda]] director, University British Columbia [http://www.ontherundesign.com/Artists/Caterina_Davinio.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
Karenina.it won MAD03 Award (section Net-Zin) in 2003, Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;AAVV, ''MAD 03, Secondo encuentro de arte experimental de Madrid'', October 24 to November 16, 2003, catalogue published by AVAM, Artistas Visuales Asociados de Madrid, with the support of Ministerio de Cultura, Concejalia de las artes del ajuntamiento de Madrid, p. 97 and 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Net.art Works==
Other Davinio’s [[net-poetry]] and [[net.art]] performances and events are based on the evolution of the multi-located structure experimented with ''Parallel Action-Bunker'', mentioned before: beyond the simple presence of the performer on stage, performance is considered a ''collaborative'', ''decentralized'', ''multi-located'' action; poetry is conceived as "social structure, e-communication, real/virtual interaction", and "e-communication" is assumed as a new material for the artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://xoomer.alice.it/cprezi/caterinadav.html#net-poetry] definition from the artist's page.

'''Charles Dixon''' (1858-17 June 1926) was an [[English people|English]] [[ornithology|ornithologist]], born in [[London]].  He discovered the [[St Kilda wren]] and a new species in North Africa.  He collaborated with [[Henry Seebohm]] on his great work on ''British Birds'', in the second volume of which he summarized and modified [[Alfred Russel Wallace|A. R. Wallace's]] theory of the relation between nests and coloration of birds. Elliott Coues wrote in the preface to the American edition of Dixon's book "Rural bird life" pointing out the originality of the observations made from the field&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |place=Boston|title=Rural bird life |author=Dixon, Charles| publisher=Estes and Lauriat| year=1880|url=https://archive.org/stream/ruralbirdlifebei00dixo#page/n13/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Julian Huxley]] noted Dixon for recognizing the value of prismatic binoculars for bird study. In his later years, he wrote in the newspapers on agricultural fairs and horse shows. 

==Biography==

Little is known of Dixon's early life. Dixon's early studies on ornithology were followed by numerous books. He did not believe in the role of [[natural selection]] in evolution and in his ''Evolution without Natural Selection'' (1885) he used examples of adaptations that were apparently of little survival value to illustrate his position. Reviewers were quick to point out that natural selection essentially works on adaptations that do have a survival value. He also argued that Darwin was mistaken to conclude that ornate male plumages evolved due to female selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nature |volume=33|page=100|date=3 December 1885|doi=10.1038/033100a0| title=[Letters to the editor] “Evolution without Natural Selection”|author=Dixon, Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/29th-january-1898/8/curiosities-of-bird-life-by-charles-dixon-george-r|newspaper=The Spectator|date=29 January 1898|page=8|title=Curiosities of Bird Life.

Dixon made a special study of [[bird migration]] &amp;mdash; especially in his 1892 book ''The Migration of Birds'' (new edition, 1897), an ingenious theoretical work &amp;mdash; and of geographical distribution of birds. Dixon changed his ideas drastically between the two editions of his book on migration. In the 1892 edition he supported the idea that birds moved out of unfavourable environmental conditions but in the 1897 edition he suggested that migration is essentially derived from dispersal and range extension of birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Journal of Biogeography| year=2008| volume=35| pages=1951–1959| author1=Bruderer, Bruno| author2=Salewski, Volker| title=Evolution of bird migration in a biogeographical context| doi=10.1111/j.1365-2699.2008.01992.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that glaciation in former times could not have induced migration on its own and that southward migration was because of a former mass of tropical land that stretched around the equator. Reviewers did not think of his theories as being well-founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review: Dixon's Migration of Birds |author=Allen, J.A.| journal=Auk| volume=15| issue=1| year=1898| pages=67–70|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v015n01/p0067-p0070.pdf| doi=10.2307/4068450}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julian Huxley recognized him for noting the potential of prismatic binoculars to unravel the life of living birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v033n02/p0142-p0161.pdf|pages=142–161|author=Huxley, Julian|volume=33| issue=2|journal=The Auk|year=1916|title=Bird-watching and biological science|doi=10.2307/4072162}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also published behavioural observations on birds and often incorporated these in his books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Towering of Wounded Birds| author=Dixon, Charles| journal=Nature| volume=17| issue=420| page=45| year=1877| doi=10.1038/017045b0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recognized the threats to birds posed by human activity and was an early conservationist. He was quite opposed to the ideas of [[Acclimatisation society|acclimatisation]] and recognized the problem of introduction of species into Australia and New Zealand and their effects, especially on flightless birds.&lt;ref&gt;Lost and Vanishing Birds. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed his conservation ethic thus:&lt;ref&gt;Lost and Vanishing Birds. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Charles Frederick McDew was born in [[Massillon, Ohio]] in 1938, to Eva (née Stephens) and James McDew. He was one of four children.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paquelet.com/obituary/Charles-Frederick-McDew/St.-Paul-Minnesota/1791521&lt;/ref&gt;  Mcdew's mother worked as a nurse and his father, who had been a chemistry teacher in [[South Carolina]], had become a steel worker after Ohio schools refused to hire him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Sam|authorlink1=Sam Roberts (newspaper journalist)|title=Charles McDew, 79, Tactician for Student Civil Rights Group, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/obituaries/charles-mcdew-79-tactician-for-student-civil-rights-group-dies.html|accessdate=16 April 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=15 April 2018|page=A26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to McDew's autobiography, he believed that his birth date was notable because he was born on the day that boxer [[Joe Louis]] defeated [[Max Schmeling]] for the heavyweight championship of the world. Even though the fight was a rematch, McDew was convinced by his elders that he was destined to do something great or good for the "[[Negro]]" race. McDew also referred to himself as a "race baby", an ideal that had never been defined to him by family members, but one that he believed he was expected to define for himself as his future unfolded. "I had a charge to do something for the race. It was never specified what I would do for the race, but it was expected that I would do something to help the colored race to move ahead."&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;[http://charlesmcdew.com/about/index.html "Teacher, Organizer, Activist - Charles 'Chuck' F. Charles McDew"], Charles McDew website.&lt;/ref&gt;

McDew grew up in a family who talked little about the advancement of [[civil rights]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though there was little talk on that topic, McDew displayed his first example of general protesting when he was only in the eighth grade.&lt;ref name="AAR" /&gt; Protesting the rights of religious freedom, McDew is seen standing up for his peers by representing [[Amish]] religion at a very young age.&lt;ref name="AAR" /&gt;

As he got older, McDew expected to grow up to work in the steel mills, as many men in that area did.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Before he did so, his father requested that McDew go to the South to experience his "own culture" to expand his ideas of what work he could do.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Upon arrival at his university of choice, [[South Carolina State University]], Charles thought that his father was "the most brilliant man alive."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Never having seen so many "pretty black girls," McDew instantly knew he chose the right college.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==College==
During his first [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] on campus, McDew decided to travel with his roommate, Charles Gatson, back to the area where Gatson had family because it would be cheaper than going back to [[Ohio]] and the schools closed during these holidays.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During their vacation, the two of them, and some others, went to a party.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; McDew responsibly decided to be the designated driver, but on their way home, they were pulled over by a police officer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was presumably for the reason of McDew and Gatson being black.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Not knowing how to address an officer in the South different than in the North, McDew answered the officer's questions with a bit too much sass.(I) This is what led to the beating and first arrest of Charles McDew.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A couple days later, McDew was on his way to the train station to head home. The general cart for white people and the end cart for the black people were both filled, so McDew was told to go sit in the luggage cart.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Refusing is what led to the second arrest of Charles McDew.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The day he finally got back to South Carolina, McDew was walking to his dorm. In pain because of his previous beating, he decided to walk home though a park. Being unfamiliar with [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], the park McDew walked through happened to only be open to white people on this particular day, which led to his third arrest in two days.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These events were said to be the beginning of McDew's inspiration towards the Movement and McDew's general distaste for the Southern way of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.pierce.ctc.edu:2189/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=fb4f627f-5243-4669-b37c-b5633b1de798%40sessionmgr4005&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=4207|title = The Orangeburg Massacre: A Case Study Of The Influence Of Social Phenomena On Historical Recollection|date = 2011|accessdate = 4 Nov 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Toth|first = Reid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Movement==
In April 1960, McDew received a letter from [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King Jr.]] stating that they were going to have a [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]] meeting at [[Shaw University]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] to discuss the student sit ins, and as a representative for [[South Carolina State University]], Charles attended.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Biography" /&gt; This meeting talked about student involvement all over the South, along with [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|King]] trying to persuade everyone to join the SCLC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; McDew did not want to join because he did not completely agree with the route of nonviolence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thinking of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], McDew's reasoning was that if Gandhi tried the [[nonviolence]] method in Africa and was beaten, jailed, and ultimately run out of the country, how would this method work in the "most violent country in the world?"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Due to this disagreement, McDew and a few other students went down the hall and talked about creating a new group. This group would compliment the already established SCLC, along with enforcing a few other beliefs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After much talking, the students thought to call their new group the Student Coordinating Committee, but with a couple students completely focused on nonviolence, they ultimately chose to include "Nonviolent" in the name.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The students then proceeded to nominate [[Marion Barry]] as their first chairman. Performing the last touches to establish their organization, McDew even had a hand in developing the dress code and other rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.pierce.ctc.edu:2059/ic/uhic/AcademicJournalsDetailsPage/AcademicJournalsDetailsWindow?failOverType=&amp;query=&amp;prodId=&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;contentModules=&amp;display-query=&amp;mode=view&amp;displayGroupName=Journals&amp;dviSelectedPage=&amp;limiter=&amp;u=puya65247&amp;currPage=&amp;source=&amp;disableHighlighting=&amp;displayGroups=&amp;sortBy=&amp;zid=&amp;search_within_results=&amp;p=UHIC%3AWHIC&amp;action=e&amp;catId=&amp;activityType=&amp;scanId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CA341126703|title = SNCC women, denim, and the politics of dress|date = 2013|accessdate = 4 Nov 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Tanisha C.|first = Ford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] received more publicity and presence in the media, reporters gave them nicknames. This is how SNCC (pronounced "snick") came to be. One reporter referred to them as this in his article, and from then on, the organization was SNCC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During this time, SNCC and McDew wanted to focus on black voter registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.pierce.ctc.edu:2077/docview/468588455?OpenUrlRefId=info:xri/sid:primo&amp;accountid=2280|title = Founder of Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Headlines Vanderbilt University Events Honoring Life and Legacy of Martin Luther King Jr.|date = 8 Jan 2009|accessdate = 4 Nov 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling that the real "threat" in the movement would ultimately be the black voters, McDew and the organization went on to promote registration in the [[Black Belt (U.S. region)|"blackest" parts of the country]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thinking that if they could get people in, for example, [[Baker County, Alabama|Baker's County]] and [[Mississippi]] to register, then they could get anyone to register.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Knowing that "violence was a part of the game," they could not let these areas of the country intimidate them because once these areas were registered, anywhere could get registered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As the movement developed and grew, SNCC kept getting into trouble and people kept getting arrested. This is how the "Jail No Bail" tactic began. This was where activists would get arrested, refuse to pay their fines for 39 days, (they only had 40 days to post bail) and then on the 39th day post their bail.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Civil Rights Movement -- History &amp; Timeline, 1961|url = http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis61.htm|website = www.crmvet.org|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a way of protesting the illegal arrests they were suffering.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As time went on and the need for a second chairman came around, and Charles McDew was elected because of his obvious drive for the movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He remained SNCC's second chairman until 1963.&lt;ref name="AAR" /&gt; Since these years, he has participated in many sit ins, arrests,  protests and more to stand up for what he believes is right and fair for everybody.&lt;ref name="AAR" /&gt;

He, and eleven others, were once arrested for "disrupting racial harmony" and were placed into a cold Mississippi cell described as an "iceberg."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Little food, no eating or drinking utensils, and some having to huddle for warmth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This arrest included, McDew has been arrested 43 times.&lt;ref&gt;McDew, Charles F. "Charles McDew." Telephone interview. 11 November 2015.{{Original research inline|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also active in organizations for social and political change, working as a teacher and as a labor organizer, managing anti-poverty programs in [[Washington, D.C.]], "serving as community organizer and catalyst for change in [[Boston]] and [[San Francisco]], as well as other communities."&lt;ref name="Biography" /&gt;

==Religion==
After moving to the South for college, McDew attempted to attend various churches. All the churches he tried were white churches, so he was rejected from every one. This led him into the arms of a rabbi, who was the first to welcome him religiously in the South.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This, along with the quote "If I am not for myself, who will be for me? If I am for myself only, what am I? If not now, when?" from the [[Talmud]], is what led McDew to [[Judaism]] and McDew's moral "obligation" to fight for justice.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hX2uPnGjp1AC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4 |title= The Shadows of Youth: The Remarkable Journey of the Civil Rights Generation|publisher=Hill and Wang |author= Andrew B. Lewis  |year= 2010|page= 4|isbn=978-0-374-53240-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and death==
McDew had one daughter, Eva (Dion) Goodman. He lived in St. Paul, Minnesota. He was retired from [[Metropolitan State University]] in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he had taught classes in the history of the civil rights movement, African-American history and classes in social and cultural awareness. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.paquelet.com/obituary/Charles-Frederick-McDew/St.-Paul-Minnesota/1791521&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://thetandd.com/news/local/noted-civil-rights-activist-charles-mcdew-dies-at-age/article_be544cf2-2644-5916-afc6-139fb0c7691b.html&lt;/ref&gt;

McDew died on April 3, 2018 of a heart attack while visiting his close longtime friend in Massachusetts. He was 79.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/obituaries/charles-mcdew-79-tactician-for-student-civil-rights-group-dies.html?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=B7F72F5FFAEB4D6626C542B711EE399D&amp;gwt=pay&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.brezniakrodman.com/obituary-archive/charles-frederick-mcdew/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computer simulation''' is the reproduction of the behavior of a system using a [[computer]] to simulate the outcomes of a [[mathematical model]] associated with said system. Since they allow to check the reliability of chosen mathematical models, computer simulations have become a useful tool for the mathematical modeling of many natural systems in [[physics]] ([[computational physics]]), [[astrophysics]], [[climatology]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]] and [[manufacturing]], human systems in [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[social science]], [[health care]] and [[engineering]]. Simulation of a system is represented as the running of the system's model. It can be used to explore and gain new insights into new [[technology]] and to estimate the performance of systems too complex for [[analytical solution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Computer simulations are realized by running [[computer program]]s that can be either small, running almost instantly on small devices, or large-scale programs that run for hours or days on network-based groups of computers. The scale of events being simulated by computer simulations has far exceeded anything possible (or perhaps even imaginable) using traditional paper-and-pencil mathematical modeling. Over 10 years ago, a desert-battle simulation of one force invading another involved the modeling of 66,239 tanks, trucks and other vehicles on simulated terrain around [[Kuwait]], using multiple supercomputers in the [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] High Performance Computer Modernization Program.&lt;ref name="JPLsim"&gt;" [http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/97/military.html "Researchers stage largest Military Simulation ever"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122123958/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/97/military.html |date=2008-01-22 }}, [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], [[Caltech]], December 1997,&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the computational cost of simulation, [[computer experiment]]s are used to perform inference such as [[uncertainty quantification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1=Santner, Thomas J| author2=Williams, Brian J| author3=Notz, William I| title=The design and analysis of computer experiments| year=2003| publisher=Springer Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Simulation versus model ==
A [[computer model]] is the algorithms and equations used to capture the behavior of the system being modeled. By contrast, computer simulation is the actual running of the program that contains these equations or algorithms. Simulation, therefore, is the process of running a model. Thus one would not "build a simulation"; instead, one would "build a model", and then either "run the model" or equivalently "run a simulation".

== History ==
Computer simulation developed hand-in-hand with the rapid growth of the computer, following its first large-scale deployment during the [[Manhattan Project]] in [[World War II]] to model the process of [[nuclear weapon|nuclear detonation]]. It was a simulation of 12 [[hard spheres]] using a [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo algorithm]]. Computer simulation is often used as an adjunct to, or substitute for, modeling systems for which simple [[closed-form solution|closed form analytic solutions]] are not possible. There are many types of computer simulations; their common feature is the attempt to generate a sample of representative scenarios for a model in which a complete enumeration of all possible states of the model would be prohibitive or impossible.

== Data preparation ==
The external data requirements of simulations and models vary widely. For some, the input might be just a few numbers (for example, simulation of a waveform of AC electricity on a wire), while others might require terabytes of information (such as weather and climate models).

Input sources also vary widely:
* Sensors and other physical devices connected to the model;
* Control surfaces used to direct the progress of the simulation in some way;
* Current or historical data entered by hand;
* Values extracted as a by-product from other processes;
* Values output for the purpose by other simulations, models, or processes.

Lastly, the time at which data is available varies:
* "invariant" data is often built into the model code, either because the value is truly invariant (e.g., the value of π) or because the designers consider the value to be invariant for all cases of interest;
* data can be entered into the simulation when it starts up, for example by reading one or more files, or by reading data from a [[preprocessor (CAE)|preprocessor]];
* data can be provided during the simulation run, for example by a sensor network.

Because of this variety, and because diverse simulation systems have many common elements, there are a large number of specialized [[simulation language]]s. The best-known may be [[Simula]] (sometimes called Simula-67, after the year 1967 when it was proposed). There are now many others.

Systems that accept data from external sources must be very careful in knowing what they are receiving. While it is easy for computers to read in values from text or binary files, what is much harder is knowing what the [[accuracy]] (compared to [[Graphic display resolutions|measurement resolution]] and [[Accuracy and precision|precision]]) of the values are. Often they are expressed as "error bars", a minimum and maximum deviation from the value range within which the true value (is expected to) lie. Because digital computer mathematics is not perfect, rounding and truncation errors multiply this error, so it is useful to perform an "error analysis"&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Error Analysis: The Study of Uncertainties in Physical Measurements |author=John Robert Taylor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=giFQcZub80oC&amp;pg=PA128 |pages=128–129 |isbn=0-935702-75-X |year=1999 |publisher=University Science Books |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316103343/http://books.google.com/books?id=giFQcZub80oC&amp;pg=PA128 |archivedate=2015-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to confirm that values output by the simulation will still be usefully accurate.

Even small errors in the original data can accumulate into substantial error later in the simulation. While all computer analysis is subject to the "GIGO" ([[garbage in, garbage out]]) restriction, this is especially true of digital simulation. Indeed, observation of this inherent, cumulative error in digital systems was the main catalyst for the development of [[chaos theory]].

== Types ==
Computer models can be classified according to several independent pairs of attributes, including:
* [[stochastic process|Stochastic]] or [[Deterministic algorithm|deterministic]] (and as a special case of deterministic, chaotic) – see external links below for examples of stochastic vs. deterministic simulations
* Steady-state or dynamic
* [[Continuous function|Continuous]] or [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] (and as an important special case of discrete, [[Discrete event simulation|discrete event]] or DE models)
* [[Dynamic simulation|Dynamic system simulation]], e.g. electric systems, hydraulic systems or multi-body mechanical systems (described primarely by DAE:s) or dynamics simulation of field problems, e.g. CFD of FEM simulations (described by PDE:s).
* Local or [[distributed computing|distributed]].

Another way of categorizing models is to look at the underlying data structures. For time-stepped simulations, there are two main classes:
* Simulations which store their data in regular grids and require only next-neighbor access are called [[stencil code]]s. Many [[Computational fluid dynamics|CFD]] applications belong to this category.
* If the underlying graph is not a regular grid, the model may belong to the [[meshfree method]] class.

Equations define the relationships between elements of the modeled system and attempt to find a state in which the system is in equilibrium. Such models are often used in simulating physical systems, as a simpler modeling case before dynamic simulation is attempted.
*Dynamic simulations model changes in a system in response to (usually changing) input signals.
*''[[stochastic process|Stochastic]]'' models use ''[[random number generator]]s'' to model chance or random events;
*A ''[[discrete event simulation]]'' (DES) manages events in time. Most computer, logic-test and fault-tree simulations are of this type. In this type of simulation, the simulator maintains a queue of events sorted by the simulated time they should occur. The simulator reads the queue and triggers new events as each event is processed. It is not important to execute the simulation in real time. It is often more important to be able to access the data produced by the simulation and to discover logic defects in the design or the sequence of events.
*A ''continuous dynamic simulation'' performs numerical solution of [[Differential algebraic equation|differential-algebraic equations]] or [[differential equations]] (either [[partial differential equation|partial]] or [[ordinary differential equation|ordinary]]). Periodically, the simulation program solves all the equations and uses the numbers to change the state and output of the simulation. Applications include flight simulators, [[construction and management simulation games]], [[chemical process modeling]], and simulations of [[electrical circuit]]s. Originally, these kinds of simulations were actually implemented on [[analog computer]]s, where the differential equations could be represented directly by various electrical components such as [[op-amp]]s. By the late 1980s, however, most "analog" simulations were run on conventional [[digital computer]]s that [[emulator|emulate]] the behavior of an analog computer.
*A special type of discrete simulation that does not rely on a model with an underlying equation, but can nonetheless be represented formally, is [[agent-based model|agent-based simulation]]. In agent-based simulation, the individual entities (such as molecules, cells, trees or consumers) in the model are represented directly (rather than by their density or concentration) and possess an internal state and set of behaviors or rules that determine how the agent's state is updated from one time-step to the next.
*[[Distributed computing|Distributed]] models run on a network of interconnected computers, possibly through the [[Internet]]. Simulations dispersed across multiple host computers like this are often referred to as "distributed simulations". There are several standards for distributed simulation, including [[Aggregate Level Simulation Protocol]] (ALSP), [[Distributed Interactive Simulation]] (DIS), the [[High Level Architecture (simulation)]] (HLA) and the [[Test and Training Enabling Architecture]] (TENA).

== Visualization ==
Formerly, the output data from a computer simulation was sometimes presented in a table or a matrix showing how data were affected by numerous changes in the simulation [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameters]]. The use of the matrix format was related to traditional use of the matrix concept in [[mathematical model]]s. However, psychologists and others noted that humans could quickly perceive trends by looking at graphs or even moving-images or motion-pictures generated from the data, as displayed by [[computer generated imagery|computer-generated-imagery]] (CGI) animation. Although observers could not necessarily read out numbers or quote math formulas, from observing a moving weather chart they might be able to predict events (and "see that rain was headed their way") much faster than by scanning tables of rain-cloud [[coordinate]]s. Such intense graphical displays, which transcended the world of numbers and formulae, sometimes also led to output that lacked a coordinate grid or omitted timestamps, as if straying too far from numeric data displays. Today, [[weather forecasting]] models tend to balance the view of moving rain/snow clouds against a map that uses numeric coordinates and numeric timestamps of events.

Similarly, CGI computer simulations of [[CAT scan]]s can simulate how a [[brain cancer|tumor]] might shrink or change during an extended period of medical treatment, presenting the passage of time as a spinning view of the visible human head, as the tumor changes.

Other applications of CGI computer simulations are being developed to graphically display large amounts of data, in motion, as changes occur during a simulation run.

== Computer simulation in science ==
[[File:Osmosis computer simulation.jpg|250px|thumb|Computer simulation of the process of [[osmosis]] ]]

Generic examples of types of computer simulations in science, which are derived from an underlying mathematical description:
* a numerical simulation of [[differential equation]]s that cannot be solved analytically, theories that involve continuous systems such as phenomena in [[physical cosmology]], [[fluid dynamics]] (e.g., [[climate model]]s, [[roadway noise]] models, [[roadway air dispersion model]]s), [[continuum mechanics]] and [[chemical kinetics]] fall into this category.
* a [[stochastic]] simulation, typically used for discrete systems where events occur [[probabilistic]]ally and which cannot be described directly with differential equations (this is a ''discrete'' simulation in the above sense). Phenomena in this category include [[genetic drift]], [[biochemistry|biochemical]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Ankur|last2=Rawlings|first2=James B.|date=April 2014|title=Comparison of Parameter Estimation Methods in Stochastic Chemical Kinetic Models: Examples in Systems Biology|journal=AIChE Journal |volume=60|issue=4|pages=1253–1268|doi=10.1002/aic.14409|issn=0001-1541|pmc=4946376|pmid=27429455}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[gene regulatory network]]s with small numbers of molecules. (see also: [[Monte Carlo method]]).
* multiparticle simulation of the response of nanomaterials at multiple scales to an applied force for the purpose of modeling their thermoelastic and thermodynamic properties. Techniques used for such simulations are [[Molecular dynamics]], [[Molecular mechanics]], [[Monte Carlo method]], and [[Multiscale Green's function]].

Specific examples of computer simulations follow:
* statistical simulations based upon an agglomeration of a large number of input profiles, such as the forecasting of equilibrium [[temperature]] of [[receiving waters]], allowing the gamut of [[meteorological]] data to be input for a specific locale. This technique was developed for [[thermal pollution]] forecasting.
* agent based simulation has been used effectively in [[ecology]], where it is often called "individual based modeling" and is used in situations for which individual variability in the agents cannot be neglected, such as [[population dynamics]] of [[salmon]] and [[trout]] (most purely mathematical models assume all trout behave identically).
* time stepped dynamic model. In hydrology there are several such [[hydrology transport model]]s such as the [[SWMM]] and [[DSSAM Model]]s developed by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] for river water quality forecasting.
* computer simulations have also been used to formally model theories of human cognition and performance, e.g., [[ACT-R]].
* computer simulation using [[molecular modeling]] for [[drug discovery]].&lt;ref&gt;Atanasov AG, Waltenberger B, Pferschy-Wenzig EM, Linder T, Wawrosch C, Uhrin P, Temml V, Wang L, Schwaiger S, Heiss EH, Rollinger JM, Schuster D, Breuss JM, Bochkov V, Mihovilovic MD, Kopp B, Bauer R, Dirsch VM, Stuppner H. {{doi|10.1016/j.biotechadv.2015.08.001}} Discovery and resupply of pharmacologically active plant-derived natural products: A review.] Biotechnol Adv. 2015, {{PMID|26281720}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Computational fluid dynamics]] simulations are used to simulate the behaviour of flowing air, water and other fluids. One-, two- and three-dimensional models are used. A one-dimensional model might simulate the effects of [[water hammer]] in a pipe. A two-dimensional model might be used to simulate the drag forces on the cross-section of an aeroplane wing. A three-dimensional simulation might estimate the heating and cooling requirements of a large building.
* An understanding of statistical thermodynamic molecular theory is fundamental to the appreciation of molecular solutions. Development of the [[Potential Distribution Theorem]] (PDT) allows this complex subject to be simplified to down-to-earth presentations of molecular theory.

Notable, and sometimes controversial, computer simulations used in science include: [[Donella Meadows]]' [[World3]] used in the ''[[Limits to Growth]]'', [[James Lovelock|James Lovelock's]] [[Daisyworld]] and Thomas Ray's [[Tierra (computer simulation)|Tierra]].

=== Simulation environments for physics and engineering ===
[[Graphical environment]]s to design simulations have been developed. Special care was taken to handle events (situations in which the simulation equations are not valid and have to be changed). The open project [[Open Source Physics]] was started to develop reusable libraries for simulations in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], together with [[EJS|Easy Java Simulations]], a complete graphical environment that generates code based on these libraries.

The reliability and the trust people put in computer simulations depends on the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the simulation [[model (abstract)|model]], therefore [[verification and validation]] are of crucial importance in the development of computer simulations. Another important aspect of computer simulations is that of reproducibility of the results, meaning that a simulation model should not provide a different answer for each execution. Although this might seem obvious, this is a special point of attention in [[stochastic simulation]]s, where random numbers should actually be semi-random numbers. An exception to reproducibility are human-in-the-loop simulations such as flight simulations and [[computer games]]. Here a human is part of the simulation and thus influences the outcome in a way that is hard, if not impossible, to reproduce exactly.

[[Vehicle]] manufacturers make use of computer simulation to test safety features in new designs. By building a copy of the car in a physics simulation environment, they can save the hundreds of thousands of dollars that would otherwise be required to build and test a unique prototype. Engineers can step through the simulation milliseconds at a time to determine the exact stresses being put upon each section of the prototype.&lt;ref&gt;Baase, Sara. A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for Computing and the Internet. 3. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2007. Pages 363–364. {{ISBN|0-13-600848-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Computer graphics]] can be used to display the results of a computer simulation. [[Animations]] can be used to experience a simulation in real-time, e.g., in [[Training Simulation|training simulations]]. In some cases animations may also be useful in faster than real-time or even slower than real-time modes. For example, faster than real-time animations can be useful in visualizing the buildup of queues in the simulation of humans evacuating a building. Furthermore, simulation results are often aggregated into static images using various ways of [[scientific visualization]].

In debugging, simulating a program execution under test (rather than executing natively) can detect far more errors than the hardware itself can detect and, at the same time, log useful debugging information such as instruction trace, memory alterations and instruction counts. This technique can also detect [[buffer overflow]] and similar "hard to detect" errors as well as produce performance information and [[Performance tuning|tuning]] data.

== Pitfalls ==
Although sometimes ignored in computer simulations, it is very important to perform a [[sensitivity analysis]] to ensure that the accuracy of the results is properly understood. For example, the probabilistic risk analysis of factors determining the success of an oilfield exploration program involves combining samples from a variety of statistical distributions using the [[Monte Carlo method]]. If, for instance, one of the key parameters (e.g., the net ratio of oil-bearing strata) is known to only one significant figure, then the result of the simulation might not be more precise than one significant figure, although it might (misleadingly) be presented as having four significant figures.

=== Model calibration techniques ===
The following three steps should be used to produce accurate simulation models: calibration, verification, and validation. Computer simulations are good at portraying and comparing theoretical scenarios, but in order to accurately model actual case studies they have to match what is actually happening today. A base model should be created and calibrated so that it matches the area being studied. The calibrated model should then be verified to ensure that the model is operating as expected based on the inputs. Once the model has been verified, the final step is to validate the model by comparing the outputs to historical data from the study area. This can be done by using statistical techniques and ensuring an adequate R-squared value. Unless these techniques are employed, the simulation model created will produce inaccurate results and not be a useful prediction tool.

Model calibration is achieved by adjusting any available parameters in order to adjust how the model operates and simulates the process. For example, in traffic simulation, typical parameters include look-ahead distance, car-following sensitivity, discharge headway, and start-up lost time. These parameters influence driver behavior such as when and how long it takes a driver to change lanes, how much distance a driver leaves between his car and the car in front of it, and how quickly a driver starts to accelerate through an intersection. Adjusting these parameters has a direct effect on the amount of traffic volume that can traverse through the modeled roadway network by making the drivers more or less aggressive. These are examples of calibration parameters that can be fine-tuned to match characteristics observed in the field at the study location. Most traffic models have typical default values but they may need to be adjusted to better match the driver behavior at the specific location being studied.

Model verification is achieved by obtaining output data from the model and comparing them to what is expected from the input data. For example, in traffic simulation, traffic volume can be verified to ensure that actual volume throughput in the model is reasonably close to traffic volumes input into the model. Ten percent is a typical threshold used in traffic simulation to determine if output volumes are reasonably close to input volumes. Simulation models handle model inputs in different ways so traffic that enters the network, for example, may or may not reach its desired destination. Additionally, traffic that wants to enter the network may not be able to, if congestion exists. This is why model verification is a very important part of the modeling process.

The final step is to validate the model by comparing the results with what is expected based on historical data from the study area. Ideally, the model should produce similar results to what has happened historically. This is typically verified by nothing more than quoting the R-squared statistic from the fit. This statistic measures the fraction of variability that is accounted for by the model. A high R-squared value does not necessarily mean the model fits the data well. Another tool used to validate models is graphical residual analysis. If model output values drastically differ from historical values, it probably means there is an error in the model. Before using the model as a base to produce additional models, it is important to verify it for different scenarios to ensure that each one is accurate. If the outputs do not reasonably match historic values during the validation process, the model should be reviewed and updated to produce results more in line with expectations. It is an iterative process that helps to produce more realistic models.

Validating traffic simulation models requires comparing traffic estimated by the model to observed traffic on the roadway and transit systems. Initial comparisons are for trip interchanges between quadrants, sectors, or other large areas of interest. The next step is to compare traffic estimated by the models to traffic counts, including transit ridership, crossing contrived barriers in the study area. These are typically called screenlines, cutlines, and cordon lines and may be imaginary or actual physical barriers. Cordon lines surround particular areas such as a city's central business district or other major activity centers. Transit ridership estimates are commonly validated by comparing them to actual patronage crossing cordon lines around the central business district.

Three sources of error can cause weak correlation during calibration: input error, model error, and parameter error. In general, input error and parameter error can be adjusted easily by the user. Model error however is caused by the methodology used in the model and may not be as easy to fix. Simulation models are typically built using several different modeling theories that can produce conflicting results. Some models are more generalized while others are more detailed. If model error occurs as a result, in may be necessary to adjust the model methodology to make results more consistent.

In order to produce good models that can be used to produce realistic results, these are the necessary steps that need to be taken in order to ensure that simulation models are functioning properly. Simulation models can be used as a tool to verify engineering theories, but they are only valid if calibrated properly. Once satisfactory estimates of the parameters for all models have been obtained, the models must be checked to assure that they adequately perform the intended functions. The validation process establishes the credibility of the model by demonstrating its ability to replicate actual traffic patterns. The importance of model validation underscores the need for careful planning, thoroughness and accuracy of the input data collection program that has this purpose. Efforts should be made to ensure collected data is consistent with expected values. For example, in traffic analysis it is typical for a traffic engineer to perform a site visit to verify traffic counts and become familiar with traffic patterns in the area. The resulting models and forecasts will be no better than the data used for model estimation and validation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5192">The term '''cotton ceiling''' refers to the difficulty [[transgender|trans people]] experience when seeking [[lesbian]] and [[gay]] relationships, and in lesbian and gay [[social space]]s more generally.

== Controversy ==

Some [[Transgender rights|trans rights activists]] have described this as [[transphobic]] [[social exclusion|exclusion]]. In 2014, [[Julia Serano]] wrote that "when the overwhelming majority of [[cisgender|cis]] [[Dyke (slang)|dykes]] date and fuck cis women, but are not open to, or are even turned off by, the idea of dating or fucking trans women, how is that not transphobic?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-struggle-to-find-trans-love-in-san-francisco|title=The Struggle To Find Trans Love In San Francisco|website=thedailybeast.com|date=14 January 2014|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cisgender]] lesbian Andrea Zanin wrote in 2013 that "a lot of cis and otherwise non-trans gals need to ... take the opportunity to really examine how much of our desire rests on [[cissexism]], and how much of the sexual culture we create and consume excludes trans women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transadvocate.com/if-trans-women-arent-welcome-neither-am-i_n_10232.htm|title=If trans women aren't welcome, neither am I|website=transadvocate.com|date=25 September 2013|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other trans activists consider the concept problematic. Journalist [[Paris Lees]] wrote in 2015 that "there's a huge difference between denying someone a job versus not desiring someone sexually. Sexual attraction may be the one area that it's OK to 'discriminate' in—after all, it's up to you who you want to fuck—but you don't need to be a dick about your preference."&lt;ref name="paris" /&gt; Meanwhile, a 2013 [[Everyday Feminism]] article, written by an anonymous trans woman, stated that "the 'cotton ceiling' should be considered an unhelpful concept for this type of discussion and should be set aside by trans activists moving forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://everydayfeminism.com/2013/05/getting-with-girls-like-us/|title=Getting With Girls Like Us: A Radical Guide To Dating Trans Women For Cis Women|website=everydayfeminism.com|date=12 May 2013|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is almost universally condemned by [[Feminist views on transgender topics|anti-trans activists]]. Academic [[Sheila Jeffreys]] wrote in her 2014 book "Gender Hurts: A Feminist Analysis of the Politics of Transgenderism" that '[t]he campaign relies on guilt-tripping, in which women who resist are accused of transphobia or transmisogyny, in an attempt to induce them to admit unwanted penises to their bodies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kLhwAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA181&amp;lpg=PA181&amp;dq=cotton+ceiling+trans&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4AwdJgbb6J&amp;sig=QLAzz2Shhs-MFvujIEQmAcpWWHQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwijsZ_gvObYAhVRZlAKHQiFCIk4HhDoATAHegQIChAB#v=onepage&amp;q=cotton+ceiling+trans&amp;f=false|title=Gender Hurts: A Feminist Analysis of the Politics of Transgenderism|first=Sheila|last=Jeffreys|date=24 April 2014|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=22 January 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while in the same year blogger Julian Vigo wrote on [[CounterPunch]] that "[w]hile many are sympathetic to the fact that trans women wish to be accepted within social circles as women, they find it preposterous that lesbians are now being asked to deny their sexuality as proof of their solidarity with trans women, least (sic) they be labelled a bigot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.counterpunch.org/2013/06/07/the-left-hand-of-darkness/|title=The Left Hand of Darkness|website=counterpunch.org|date=7 June 2013|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7196">In [[mathematical analysis]], a '''domain''' is any [[connected (topology)|connected]] [[open set|open subset]] of a finite-dimensional vector space. This is a different concept than the [[domain of a function]], though it is often used for that purpose, for example in [[partial differential equations]] and [[Sobolev space]]s.

Various degrees of smoothness of the boundary of the domain are required for various properties of functions defined on the domain to hold, such as integral theorems ([[Green's theorem]], [[Stokes theorem]]), properties of [[Sobolev space]]s, and to define [[Measure (mathematics)|measures]] on the boundary and spaces of [[Trace operator|traces]] (generalized functions defined on the boundary). Commonly considered types of domains are domains with [[continuous function|continuous]] boundary, [[Lipschitz domain|Lipschitz boundary]], [[Smooth function|''C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]] boundary, and so forth.

A '''Bounded domain''' is a domain which is a [[bounded set]], while an '''Exterior''' or '''external domain''' is the [[Interior (topology)|interior]] of the [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] of a bounded domain.

In [[complex analysis]], a '''complex domain''' (or simply '''domain''') is any connected open subset of the [[complex plane]] ℂ. For example, the entire complex plane is a domain, as is the open [[unit disk]], the open [[upper half-plane]], and so forth.  Often, a complex domain serves as the [[domain of a function|domain of definition]] for a [[holomorphic function]].

In the study of [[several complex variables]], the definition of a domain is extended to include any connected open subset of ℂ''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''.

==Historical notes==
{{quote
|text='''Definition'''. Eine offene Punktmenge heißt zusammenhängend, wenn man sie nicht als Summe von zwei offenen Punktmengen darstellen kann. Eine offene zusammenhängende Punktmenge heißt ein Gebiet.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-en|"An open set is connected if it cannot be expressed as the sum of two open sets. An open connected set is called a domain"}}: in this definition, Carathéodory considers obviously [[Empty set|non empty]] [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] sets.&lt;/ref&gt;

|sign= [[Constantin Carathéodory]]
|source={{Harv|Carathéodory|1918|p=222}}
}}

According to [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Hahn|1921|loc=p. 85 footnote 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of a domain as an open connected set was introduced by [[Constantin Carathéodory]] in his famous book {{harv|Carathéodory|1918}}. Hahn also remarks that the word "''Gebiet''" ("''Domain''") was occasionally previously used as a [[synonym]] of [[open set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hahn|1921|loc = p. 61 footnote 3}}, commenting the just given definition of open set ("offene Menge"), precisely states:-"''Vorher war, für diese Punktmengen die Bezeichnung "Gebiet" in Gebrauch, die wir (§ 5, S. 85) anders verwenden werden.''" (Free English translation:-"''Previously, the term "Gebiet" was occasionally used for such point sets, and it will be used by us in (§ 5, p. 85) with a different meaning.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the term "domain" was occasionally used to identify closely related but slightly different concepts. For example, in his influential [[monograph]]s on [[elliptic partial differential equation]]s, [[Carlo Miranda]] uses the term "region" to identify an open connected set,&lt;ref name="M&amp;Mp1"&gt;See {{harvs|last= Miranda|year1=1955|year2=1970|loc1=p. 1|loc2=p. 2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Precisely, in the first edition of his monograph, {{harvtxt|Miranda|1955|p=1}} uses the Italian term "''campo''", meaning literally "field" in a way similar to [[Field (agriculture)|its meaning in agriculture]]: in the second edition of the book, Zane C. Motteler appropriately translates this term as "region".&lt;/ref&gt; and reserves the term "domain" to identify an internally connected,&lt;ref&gt;An internally connected set is a set whose interior is connected.&lt;/ref&gt; [[perfect set]], each point of which is an accumulation point of interior points,&lt;ref name="M&amp;Mp1"/&gt; following his former master [[Mauro Picone]]:&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Picone|1922|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; according to this convention, if a set {{math|''A''}} is a region then its [[Closure (topology)|closure]] {{math|''{{overline|A}}''}} is a domain.&lt;ref name="M&amp;Mp1" /&gt;

The '''Eight-Circuit Model of Consciousness''' is a hypothesis by [[Timothy Leary]], and later expanded on by [[Robert Anton Wilson]] and [[Antero Alli]], that "suggested eight periods [circuits] and twenty-four stages of neurological evolution".&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1987). Info-Psychology. New Falcon Press, Los Angeles. Page xii&lt;/ref&gt; The eight circuits, or eight "brains" as referred by other authors, operate within the human nervous system, each corresponding to its own imprint and direct experience of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, Wilson, Alli, et al. (1977-95)&lt;/ref&gt; Leary and Alli include three stages for each circuit that details developmental points for each level of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1987). ''Info-Psychology.'' New Falcon Press, Los Angeles. Seventh Printing, (2011). Page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alli, A. (2009). The Eight-Circuit Brain. Vertical Pool publishing, Berkeley, CA. Page 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1979) ''Game of Life.'' New Falcon Publications. Phoenix, AZ. 2nd Ed. (1993). Pg. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The first four circuits deal with life on earth, and survival of the species. The last four circuits are post-terrestrial, and deal with the evolution of the species, [[Altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]], [[Enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], [[Mysticism|mystical]] experiences, [[psychedelic experience|psychedelic]] states of mind, and [[psychic]] abilities.  The proposal suggests that these altered states of consciousness are recently realized, but not widely utilized.  Leary describes the first four as "larval circuits", necessary for surviving and functioning in a terrestrial human society, and proposed that the post terrestrial circuits will be useful for future humans who, through a predetermined script, continue to act on their urge to migrate to outer space and live extra-terrestrially.&lt;ref&gt;"Info-Psychology," Chapter 12, Timothy Leary, 1994, New Falcon Publications, Phoenix, Arizona, USA&lt;/ref&gt;  Leary, Wilson, and Alli have written about the idea in depth, and have explored and attempted to define how each circuit operates, both in the lives of individual people and in societies and civilization.

The term "circuit" is equated to a metaphor of the brain being [[computer hardware]], and that the wiring of the brain as [[circuitry]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A.(1983). ''Prometheus Rising.'' New Falcon Publications, Reno, NV. Twenty-first Printing, (2009). Pgs. 33-41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1979) ''Game of Life.'' New Falcon Publications. Phoenix, AZ. 2nd Ed. (1993). Pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leary uses the eight circuits along with [[recapitulation theory]] to explain the evolution of the human species, the personal development of an individual, and the [[biological evolution]] of all life.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1979) ''Game of Life.'' New Falcon Publications. Phoenix, AZ. 2nd Ed. (1993). Pg. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1987). ''Info-Psychology.'' New Falcon Press, Los Angeles. Seventh Printing, (2011). Pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Eight Circuits==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2016}}

Each circuit listed has each name from Leary's book "Exo-Psychology" after the preface,&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1977). Exo-Psychology. Starseed/Peace Press, Los Angeles. Pg. 14 not numbered&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/exopsychologyman00learrich#page/n15/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt; and Wilson's book "Quantum Psychology" pgs.196-201.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. (1990). Quantum Psychology. New Falcon Press, Tempe, AZ. Page 196-201&lt;/ref&gt; ''Note:In other books from Leary, Wilson, and Alli, the eight circuits have different names due to different interpretations and findings of each author. Please reference bibliography section for other works on labeling of each circuit.''

===1. (Leary)The vegetative-invertebrate circuit (Wilson)The oral bio-survival circuit&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1977). Exo-Psychology. Starseed/Peace Press, Los Angeles. Pg. 14 not numbered&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/exopsychologyman00learrich#page/n15/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. (1990). Quantum Psychology. New Falcon Press, Tempe, AZ. Page 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===

This circuit is concerned with nourishment, physical safety, comfort and survival,  [[suckling]], cuddling, etc. It begins with one spatial dimension, forward/back.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

This circuit is [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinted]] early in infancy. The imprint will normally last for life unless it is re-imprinted by a powerful experience. Depending on the nature of the imprint, the organism will tend towards one of two basic attitudes:
*A positive imprint sets up a basic attitude of trust. The organism generally considers the environment benign and accepts and approaches. This is equivalent to a default life position of "you're ok" in the [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|'life positions' model of Transactional analysis]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}
*A negative imprint sets up a basic attitude of suspicion. The organism generally regards the environment as hostile and flees and avoids. This is equivalent to a default life position of "you're not ok" in the [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|'life positions' model of Transactional analysis]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

This circuit is said to have appeared in the earliest evolution of the invertebrate brain and corresponds to the reptilian brain of [[Triune brain|triune brain theory]]. This circuit operates in essentially the same way across mammals, reptiles, fish, primates and humans. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[Robert Anton Wilson]] equated this circuit with the [[oral stage]] in the Freudian theory of [[psychosexual development]], and proposed that this circuit is activated in adults by strong [[opioid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Prometheus Rising, pg. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

===2. (Leary)The emotional-locomotion circuit (Wilson)The anal territorial circuit&lt;ref&gt;''Exo-Psychology, table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===
The emotional-territorial circuit is imprinted in the toddler stage. It is concerned with domination and submission, territoriality, etc.

The imprint on this circuit will trigger one of two states:
*Dominant, aggressive behavior. This imprint creates an '[[Alpha (ethology)|alpha]]' social attitude. Equivalent to the 'top dog' position in the model of [[Fritz Perls]], to 'I'm OK' in the  [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|'life positions' model of Transactional analysis]], and to [[Master–slave morality|master morality]] in the model of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 79.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Submissive, co-operative behavior.  Equivalent to the 'bottom dog' position in the model of Fritz Perls, to 'I'm not OK' in the life positions model and to Nietzschean 'slave morality'.

This circuit is activated by [[depressant]] drugs such as [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[barbiturates]], and [[benzodiazepine]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} This circuit appeared first in territorial vertebrate animals and is preserved across all mammals. It corresponds to the mammalian brain of [[Triune brain|triune brain theory]]. [[Robert Anton Wilson]] equated this circuit with the [[anal stage]] in the Freudian theory of [[psycho-sexual development]]. This circuit introduces a 2nd spatial dimension; up/down.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The first and second circuits both imprint in a binary fashion: trust/suspicion and dominance/submission.&lt;ref&gt;http://deoxy.org/raw1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Thus there are four possible ways of imprinting the first two circuits:

*Trusting 1st circuit and dominant 2nd circuit. [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|I'm OK; you're OK]]. Friendly strength in the [[Interpersonal Circumplex]]. [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]] in the [[Classical element|four elements model]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Choleric in the [[Humorism|four humors model]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Trusting 1st circuit and submissive 2nd circuit. [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|I'm not OK; you're OK]]. Friendly weakness. [[Water (classical element)|Water]] in the four elements model. Phlegmatic humor.
*Suspicious 1st circuit and dominant 2nd circuit. [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|I'm OK; you're not OK]]. Unfriendly strength. [[Air (classical element)|Air]] in the four elements model. Sanguine humor.
*Suspicious 1st circuit and submissive 2nd circuit. [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|I'm not OK; you're not OK]]. Unfriendly weakness. [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]] in the four elements model. Melancholic humor.

This circuit is imprinted by human symbol systems. It is concerned with language, handling the environment, invention, calculation, prediction, building a mental "map" of the universe, physical dexterity, etc.

This circuit is activated by [[stimulant]] drugs such as [[amphetamine]]s, [[cathinone]]s, [[cocaine]], and [[caffeine]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} This circuit supposedly appeared first when [[hominid]]s started differentiating from the rest of the [[primates]].

[[Robert Anton Wilson]], being heavily influenced by [[General Semantics]], writes of this circuit as the 'time-binding circuit'. This means that this circuit's contents&amp;nbsp;– including human know-how, technology, science etc. - are preserved [[meme]]tically and passed on from generation to generation, constantly mutating and increasing in sophistication.

This fourth circuit is imprinted by the first [[orgasm]]-mating experiences and tribal "morals". It is concerned with [[sexual pleasure]] (instead of sexual reproduction), local definitions of "moral" and "immoral", [[reproduction]], rearing of the young, etc. The fourth circuit concerns itself with cultural values and operating within [[society|social networks]]. This circuit is said to have first appeared with the development of tribes. Some have pointed out that [[empathogen-entactogen|entactogen]]s such as [[MDMA]] seem to meet some of the requirements needed to activate this circuit.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===5. (Leary and Wilson)The neurosomatic circuit&lt;ref&gt;''Exo-Psychology, table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===
This is concerned with neurological-somatic feedbacks, feeling high and blissful, [[somatic reprogramming]], etc. It may be called the rapture circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T., "Neurologic" (1973). Starseed Publications, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;

When this circuit is activated, a non-conceptual feeling of well-being arises. This has a beneficial effect on the health of the physical body.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A., "Quantum Psychology" (1990). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 198&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth circuit is consciousness of the [[Human body|body]]. There is a marked shift from linear visual space to an all-encompassing [[aesthetic]] sensory space. Perceptions are judged not so much for their meaning and utility, but for their aesthetic qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T., "Neurologic" (1973). Starseed Publications, San Francisco. Page V-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Experience of this circuit often accompanies an [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] turn-on, a rapturous amusement, a detachment from the previously compulsive mechanism of the first four circuits.

This circuit is activated by ecstatic experiences via physiological effects of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[Hatha Yoga]], [[tantra]] and [[Zen meditation]]. Robert Anton Wilson writes, "Tantra yoga is concerned with shifting consciousness entirely into this circuit"&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 41.&lt;/ref&gt; and that "Prolonged sexual play without orgasm always triggers some Circuit V consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leary describes that this circuit first appeared in the [[upper class]]es, with the development of leisure-class civilizations around 2000 BC.

===6. (Leary)The neuro-electric circuit (Wilson)The metaprogramming circuit&lt;ref&gt;''Exo-Psychology, table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===
''Note: Timothy Leary lists this circuit as the sixth, and the neurogenetic circuit as the seventh.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1977). "Neuropolitics". Starseed Peace Press, Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt; In "Prometheus Rising", Robert Anton Wilson reversed the order of these two circuits,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe.&lt;/ref&gt; describing the neurogenetic circuit as the sixth circuit, and the metaprogramming circuit as the seventh. In the subsequently published "Quantum Psychology", he reverted this back to the order proposed by Leary.''&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. (1990). Quantum Psychology. New Falcon Press, Tempe, AZ. Seventh Printing, (2003). Page 199-200&lt;/ref&gt;

This circuit is concerned with re-imprinting and re-programming all earlier circuits and the relativity of "realities" perceived. The sixth circuit consists of the nervous system becoming aware of itself. Leary says this circuit enables [[Telepathy|telepathic communication]] and is activated by low-to-moderate doses of [[LSD]] (50-150&amp;nbsp;µg), moderate doses of [[peyote]], [[psilocybin mushroom]]s and meditation/chanting especially when used in a group or ritual setting. This circuit is traced by Leary back to 500 BC.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===7. (Leary)The neurogenetic circuit (Wilson)The morphogenetic circuit&lt;ref&gt;''Exo-Psychology, table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===
This circuit is the connection of the individual's mind to the whole sweep of evolution and life as a whole. It is the part of consciousness that echoes the experiences of the previous generations that have brought the individual's brain-mind to its present level.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

It deals with ancestral, societal and scientific [[DNA]]-[[Ribonucleic acid|RNA]]-brain feedbacks. Those who achieve this mutation may speak of [[past lives]], [[reincarnation]], [[immortality]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://deoxy.org/cc-chap4.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It corresponds to the [[collective unconscious]] in the models of [[Carl Jung]]&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 41.&lt;/ref&gt; where archetypes reside.

Activation of this circuit may be equated with consciousness of the [[Pan (god)|Great God Pan]] in his aspect as Life as a whole, or with consciousness of [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia]], the biosphere considered as a single organism.&lt;ref&gt;http://deoxy.org/cc-chap4.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

This circuit is activated by higher doses of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] (200-500&amp;nbsp;µg), higher doses of [[peyote]], higher doses of [[psilocybin mushroom]]s, yoga and [[meditation]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The circuit first appeared among the [[Hindus]] in the early first millennium and later reappeared among the [[Sufi cosmology|Sufi]] sects.

===8. (Leary)The neuro-atomic metaphysiological (Wilson)The non-local quantum circuit&lt;ref&gt;''Exo-Psychology, table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===
The eighth circuit is concerned with [[Quantum mind|quantum consciousness]], [[Quantum entanglement|non-local awareness]] (information from beyond ordinary [[space-time]] awareness which is limited by the [[speed of light]]),  illumination. Some of the ways this circuit can get activated are: the awakening of [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]], shock, a [[near-death experience]], [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], high doses of LSD and according to Robert Anton Wilson almost any dose of ketamine.&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE0gRbyXllI&amp;index=6&amp;list=PL8F393A80E80263B3" Robert Anton Wilson - 8 Circuit Psychology 6/7] 01/12/2018.&lt;/ref&gt; This circuit has even been compared to the [[Buddhist]] concept of [[Indra's net]] from the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Leary's contribution==
Leary stated "They[The theories presented in ''Info-Psychology''] are scientific in that they are based on empirical findings from physics, physiology, pharmacology, genetics, astronomy, behavioral psychology, information science, and most importantly, neurology." &lt;ref&gt;Info-Psychology, pg 8., seventh printing, 2011 or Info-Psychology, pg. 7, third printing, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Leary called his book "science faction" or "psi-phy" and noted he had written it "in various prisons to which the author had been sentenced for dangerous ideology and violations of Newtonian and religious laws".&lt;ref&gt;''Info-Psychology, p7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Leary propounded the basic premise of eight "brains" or brain circuits, he was inspired by sources such as the [[Hindu]] ''[[chakra]]'' system.

Leary claimed that among other things this model explained the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|social conflict in the 1960s]], where the mainstream was said to be those with four circuits active and characterized by Leary as tribal moralists and clashed with the [[counter-culture|counter-culturists]], who were then said to be those with the fifth circuit active and characterized as [[individualists]] and [[hedonism|hedonists]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Leary's first book on the subject, ''Neurologic'', only included seven circuits when it was published in 1973. ''Exo-Psychology'', published in 1977, expanded the number of circuits to eight and clarified the subject. In it, he puts forward the theory that the later four circuits are "post terrestrial;" intended to develop as we migrate off this planet and colonize others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Leary|first= Timothy|date= 1977|title= Exo-Psychology|location= Los Angeles|publisher= Starseed/Peace Press Inc.|page= 103|isbn=0-915238-16-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once we begin space migration, according to Leary, we will have more ready access to these higher circuits. ''Exo-Psychology'' was re-published as revised by Timothy Leary with additional material in 1989 under the title ''Info-Psychology'' (New Falcon Publishing).

==Other authors on the eight circuits==
[[File:ChaosStar.svg|thumb|130px|In [[chaos magic]] the eight circuits are sometimes related to the eight rays of the [[symbol of chaos]]]]
Leary's ideas heavily influenced the work of [[Robert Anton Wilson]]. Wilson's book ''[[Prometheus Rising]]'' is an in-depth work documenting Leary's eight-circuit model of consciousness. Wilson's published screenplay ''[[Reality Is What You Can Get Away With]]'' uses and explains the model. Wilson, like Leary, wrote about the distinction between terrestrial and post-terrestrial life.

''Angel Tech'' by [[Antero Alli]], is structured around the Eight-circuit model of consciousness. Alli defines the word angel as "a being of light" and tech from the word "techne" meaning "art". The title is defined as "the art of being light".&lt;ref&gt;Alli, Antero. (1985) "Angel Tech: A Modern Shaman's Guide to Reality Selection" New Falcon Publications, Tempe.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes suggested activities such as [[meditation]]s and construction of [[Tarot|tarot-card]] collages associated with each circuit and imprint.

The model is fairly prominent in [[chaos magic]]. This concept has been detailed in ''"Chaotopia!"'' by [[Dave_Lee_(chaos_magician)|Dave Lee]], a leading member of the magic society [[Illuminates of Thanateros]]. Leary and Wilson were also members of the society. {{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Rolf Von Eckartsberg also appears to have been influenced by the model.&lt;ref&gt;Von Eckartsberg, R. (1981a). "Maps of the mind". In Valle, R. &amp; von Eckarsberg, R. ''The metaphors of consciousness''. New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earthportals.com/Portal_Messenger/bohm2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Reefs are threatened well beyond coastal areas. Warming causes [[coral bleaching]], which if severe kills the coral.

In 2008, a worldwide study estimated that 19% of the existing area of coral reefs has already been lost, and that a further 17% is likely to be lost over the subsequent 10–20 years.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson&gt;Wilkinson, Clive (2008) [http://www.icriforum.org/sites/default/files/Status%20Coral%20%20Reefs%20of%20World%202008%20%20Executive%20Summary_0.pdf Status of Coral Reefs of the World: Executive Summary].

==Issues==

===Competition===
In the [[Caribbean Sea]] and tropical [[Pacific ocean]], direct contact between coral and 40–70% of common [[seaweed]]s cause [[coral bleaching|bleaching]] and death of coral tissue via [[allelopathic]] competition. The lipid-soluble extracts of seaweeds that harmed coral tissues also produced rapid bleaching. At these sites bleaching and mortality was limited to areas of direct contact with seaweed or their extracts. The seaweed then expanded to occupy the dead coral's habitat.&lt;ref name=RasherHay10&gt;{{cite journal

Competitive seaweed and other [[algae]] thrive in nutrient-rich waters in the absence of sufficient [[herbivore|herbivorous]] [[predator]]s. Herbivores include fish such as [[parrotfish]]s, [[Acanthuridae|surgeonfishes, tangs and unicornfishes]].&lt;ref name=RasherHay10/&gt;

===Predation===
{{Main|Overfishing|Environmental effects of fishing}}

[[Overfishing]], particularly selective overfishing, can unbalance coral ecosystems by encouraging the excessive growth of coral predators. Predators that eat living coral, such as the [[crown-of-thorns starfish]], are called ''corallivores''. Coral reefs are built from [[stony coral]], which evolved with large amounts of the [[wax]] [[cetyl palmitate]] in their tissues. Most predators find this wax indigestible.&lt;ref&gt;Benson AA and Muscatine L (1974) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2834385 Wax in Coral Mucus: Energy Transfer From Corals to Reef Fishes] ''Limnology and Oceanography'', '''19''' (5) 810–814. [http://www.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_19/issue_5/0810.pdf Download]&lt;/ref&gt; The crown-of-thorns starfish is a large (up to one meter) starfish protected by long, venomous spines. Its [[enzyme]] system dissolves the wax in stony corals, and allows the [[starfish]] to feed on the living animal. Starfish face predators of their own, such as the [[Giant Triton|giant triton]] [[sea snail]]. However, the giant triton is valued for its [[mollusc shell|shell]] and has been over fished. As a result, crown-of-thorns starfish populations can periodically grow unchecked, devastating reefs.&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/survival/coral/predators.html Predators and Prey] ''[[PBS.org]]''.

===Fishing practices===
Although some [[marine aquarium]] fish species can reproduce in aquaria (such as [[Pomacentridae]]), most (95%) are collected from coral reefs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Intense harvesting, especially in [[maritime Southeast Asia]] (including [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]]), damages the reefs. This is aggravated by [[destructive fishing practices]], such as [[Cyanide fishing|cyanide]] and [[blast fishing]]. Most (80–90%) aquarium fish from the Philippines are captured with [[sodium cyanide]]. This toxic chemical is dissolved in sea water and released into areas where fish shelter. It narcotizes the fish, which are then easily captured. However, most fish collected with cyanide die a few months later from [[liver]] damage.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Moreover, many non-marketable specimens die in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1444-2906.2006.01114.x | title= David LECCHINI, Sandrine POLTI, Yohei NAKAMURA, Pascal MOSCONI, Makoto TSUCHIYA, Georges REMOISSENET, Serge PLANES (2006) "New perspectives on aquarium fish trade" Fisheries Science 72 (1), 40–47 | accessdate = 16 January 2007 | publisher=Blackwell Synergy |doi=10.1111/j.1444-2906.2006.01114.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 4,000 or more Filipino fish collectors have used over {{convert|1000000|kg}}  of cyanide on Philippine reefs alone, about 150,000&amp;nbsp;kg per year.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt; A major catalyst of [[cyanide fishing]] is poverty within fishing communities. In countries like the Philippines that regularly employ cyanide, more than thirty percent of the population lives below the poverty line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rp.html |title=CIA—The World Factbook—Philippines |accessdate=1 February 2011 |publisher=[[CIA]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111070218/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rp.html |archivedate=11 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dynamite]] [[fishing]] is another destructive method for gathering fish. Sticks of dynamite, [[grenade]]s, or home-made explosives are detonated in the water. This method of fishing kills the fish within the main blast area, along with many unwanted reef animals. The blast also kills the corals in the area, eliminating the reef's structure, destroying habitat for the remaining fish and other animals important for reef health.&lt;ref name="McClellan"&gt;{{cite web
|last1=McClellan |first1=Kate |last2=Bruno |first2=John |year=2008 |url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Coral_degradation_through_destructive_fishing_practices
|title=Coral degradation through destructive fishing practices |publisher=Encyclopedia of Earth |accessdate= 25 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muroami]] is the destructive practice of covering reefs with nets and dropping large stones onto the reef to produce a flight response among the fish. The stones break and kill the coral. Muroami was generally outlawed in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt;

Fishing gear damages reefs via direct physical contact with the reef structure and substrate. Gill nets, fish traps, and anchors break branching coral and cause coral death through entanglement. When fishermen drop lines by coral reefs, the lines entangle the coral. The fisher cuts the line and abandons it, leaving it attached to the reef. The discarded lines abrade coral [[polyp]]s and upper tissue layers. Corals are able to recover from small lesions, but larger and recurrent damage complicates recovery.

Bottom dragging gear such as [[beach seine]]s can damage corals by abrasion and fracturing. A beach seine is a long net about {{convert|150|m|ft|sp=us}} with a mesh size of {{convert|3|cm|in|sp=us}} and a weighted line to hold the net down while it is dragged across the substrate and is one of the most destructive types of fishing gear on Kenya’s reefs.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt;

Bottom [[trawling]] in deep oceans destroys cold–water and deep–sea corals. Historically, industrial fishers avoided coral because their nets would get caught on the reefs. In the 1980s, "rock–hopper" trawls attached large tires and rollers to allow the nets to roll over rough surfaces. Fifty-five percent of Alaskan cold–water coral that was damaged by one pass from a bottom trawl had not recovered a year later. Northeast Atlantic reefs bear scars up to {{convert|4|km|mi|sp=us}} long. In Southern Australia, 90 percent of the surfaces on coral [[seamount]]s are now bare rock. Even in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, seafloor trawling for prawns and scallops is causing localized extinction of some coral species.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt;

=== Marine pollution ===
{{Main|Marine pollution}}
[[File:Cwall99 lg.jpg|thumb|250px|right|This image of an [[algae bloom]] off the southern coast of England, though not in a coral region, shows what a bloom can look like from a satellite remote sensing system.]]

Reefs in close proximity to human populations are subject to poor water quality from land- and marine-based sources. In 2006 studies suggested that approximately 80 percent of ocean pollution originates from activities on land.&lt;ref name="2006 United Nations Environment Program"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/pdf/annualreport/UNEP_AR_2006_English.pdf |format=pdf |title=UNEP in 2006 |accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollution arrives from land via [[Surface runoff|runoff]], the wind and "injection" (deliberate introduction, e.g., drainpipes).
Runoff brings with it sediment from [[erosion]] and land-clearing, nutrients and pesticides from agriculture, [[wastewater]], industrial [[effluent]] and miscellaneous material such as petroleum residue and trash that storms wash away. Some pollutants consume [[oxygen]] and lead to [[eutrophication]], killing coral and other reef inhabitants.&lt;ref name="celebrating200years.noaa.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/visions/coral/side.html |publisher=[[NOAA]] |title=How Pollution Affects Coral Reefs |accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An increasing fraction of the global population lives in coastal areas. Without appropriate precautions, development (e.g., buildings and paved roads) increases the fraction of rainfall and other water sources that enter the ocean as runoff by decreasing the land's ability to absorb it.&lt;ref name="celebrating200years.noaa.gov"/&gt;

Pollution can introduce [[pathogen]]s. For example, [[Aspergillus]] sydowii has been associated with a disease in [[sea fan]]s, and [[Serratia marcescens]], has been linked to the coral disease white pox.&lt;ref name="celebrating200years.noaa.gov"/&gt;

Reefs in close proximity to human populations can be faced with local stresses, including poor water quality from land-based sources of pollution.&lt;ref name="celebrating200years.noaa.gov"/&gt; Copper, a common industrial pollutant has been shown to interfere with the [[Biological life cycle|life history]] and development of coral polyps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Emma Young|date=February 18, 2003|title=Copper decimates coral reef spawning

[[File:Barbadosdustgraph.gif|thumb|right|250px|Barbados dust graph.]]

In addition to runoff, wind blows material into the ocean. This material may be local or from other regions. For example, dust from the [[Sahara]] moves to the [[Caribbean]] and [[Florida]].

==== Nutrient pollution ====
{{main|Nutrient pollution}}
[[File:Runoff from this pipe in the U.S. Virgin Islands spews directly into the ocean only a few hundred yards from reefs.jpg|left|180px|thumb]]

[[Nutrient pollution]], particularly [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] can cause [[eutrophication]], upsetting the balance of the reef by enhancing algal growth and crowding out corals. This nutrient–rich water can enable [[algal blooms|blooms]] of fleshy [[algae]] and [[phytoplankton]] to thrive off coasts. These blooms can create [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] conditions by using all available [[oxygen]]. Biologically available nitrogen (nitrate plus [[ammonia]]) needs to be below 1.0 [[micromole]] per liter (less than 0.014 parts per million of nitrogen), and biologically available phosphorus ([[orthophosphate]] plus dissolved organic phosphorus) needs to be below 0.1 micromole per liter (less than 0.003 parts per million of phosphorus). In addition concentrations of chlorophyll (in the microscopic plants called phytoplankton) needs to be below 0.5 parts per billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both plants also obscure sunlight, killing both fish and coral. High nitrate levels are specifically toxic to corals, while phosphates slow down skeletal growth.

Excess nutrients can intensify existing disease, including potentially doubling the spread of [[Aspergillosis]], a fungal infection that kills soft corals such as sea fans, and increasing yellow band disease, a [[bacteria]]l [[infection]] that kills reef-building hard corals by fifty percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rachel Nowak|publisher=New Scientist|date=11 January 2004|title=Sewage nutrients fuel coral disease|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn4539|accessdate=10 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Air pollution ====
{{main|Air pollution}}
A study released in April 2013 has shown that air pollution can also stunt the growth of [[coral reef]]s; researchers from Australia, Panama and the UK used coral records (between 1880 and 2000) from the western Caribbean to show the threat of factors such as coal-burning coal and volcanic eruptions. The researchers state that the study signifies the first time that the relationship between air pollution and coral reefs has been elucidated, while former chair of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority Ian McPhail referred to the report as "fascinating" upon the public release of its findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air pollution casts a cloud over coral reef growth|url=http://theconversation.com/air-pollution-casts-a-cloud-over-coral-reef-growth-13319|work=The Conversation|publisher=The Conversation Media Group|accessdate=9 April 2013|author=Liz Minchin|date=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine debris===
{{main|Marine debris}}
[[Marine debris]] is any solid object that enters coastal and ocean waters. Debris may arrive directly from a ship or indirectly when washed out to sea via rivers, streams, and storm drains. Human-made items tend to be the most harmful such as [[plastics]] (from [[plastic bag|bags]] to balloons, hard hats to [[fishing line]]), glass, metal, rubber (millions of [[waste tire]]s), and even entire vessels.&lt;ref name="celebrating200years.noaa.gov"/&gt;

[[Plastic debris]] kills several reef species. Derelict (abandoned) fishing nets and other gear—often called "ghost nets" because they still catch fish and other marine life despite being abandoned—can entangle and kill reef organisms and break or damage reefs. Even remote reef systems suffer the effects of marine debris. Reefs in the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]] are particularly prone to the accumulation of marine debris because of their central location in the [[North Pacific Gyre]]. From 2000 to 2006, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] and partners removed over 500 tons of marine debris there.&lt;ref name="celebrating200years.noaa.gov"/&gt;
{{clear}}

===Dredging===
{{Main|Dredging}}
[[Dredging]] operations are sometimes completed by cutting a path through a coral reef, directly destroying the reef structure and killing any organisms that live on it.&lt;ref name="miamiherald"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/06/06/4162375/scientists-race-to-save-coral.html |title=Scientists race to save coral doomed by Government Cut dredging - Environment - MiamiHerald.com |publisher=miamiherald.com |accessdate=21 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715171454/http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/06/06/4162375/scientists-race-to-save-coral.html |archivedate=15 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Operations that directly destroy coral are often intended to deepen or otherwise enlarge [[Channel (geography)|shipping channels]] or [[canals]], due to the fact that in many areas, removal of coral requires a [[License|permit]], making it more cost-effective and simple to avoid coral reefs if possible.

Dredging also releases plumes of suspended sediment, which can settle on coral reefs, damaging them by starving them of food and sunlight. Continued exposure to dredging spoil has been shown to increase rates of diseases such as [[white syndrome]], [[Coral bleaching|bleaching]] and sediment [[necrosis]] among others.&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/16/coral-reefs-face-heightened-risk-of-fatal-disease-from-dredging-says-research|title=Coral reefs face heightened risk of fatal disease from dredging, says research &amp;#124; Environment &amp;#124; theguardian.com|publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted in the [[Montebello Islands|Montebello]] and [[Barrow Island (Western Australia)|Barrow Islands]] showed that the number of coral colonies with signs of poor health more than doubled in [[transects]] with high exposure to dredging sediment plumes.&lt;ref name="plosone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0102498|title=PLOS ONE: Sediment and Turbidity Associated with Offshore Dredging Increase Coral Disease Prevalence on Nearby Reefs|publisher=plosone.org|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sunscreen===
[[Sunscreen]] enters the wastewater system when it is washed off and eventually reaches the ocean. Some 14,000 tons of sunscreen ends up in the ocean each year. Certain formulations of sunscreen are a serious danger to coral health. The common sunscreen ingredient [[oxybenzone]] causes coral bleaching and has an impact on other marine fauna.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/10/20/450276158/chemicals-in-sunscreen-are-harming-coral-reefs-says-new-study|title=Chemicals In Sunscreen Are Harming Coral Reefs, Says New Study|last=Wagner|first=Laura|date=October 20, 2015|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Akumal]], Mexico, visitors are warned not to use sunscreen and are kept out of some areas to prevent damage to the coral. In several other tourist destinations, authorities recommend the use of sunscreens prepared with the naturally occurring chemicals [[titanium dioxide]] or [[zinc oxide]], or suggest the use of clothing rather than chemicals to screen the skin from the sun.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;

===Climate change===
{{Main|Climate change|Coral bleaching}}
[[File:CoralBleaching.jpg|thumbnail|right|Unbleached and [[coral bleaching|bleached coral]].]]

[[Current sea level rise|Rising sea levels due to climate change]] requires coral to grow to stay close enough to the surface to continue [[photosynthesis]]. Also, water temperature changes or disease of the coral&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ocean|last=|first=|publisher=DK|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; can induce [[coral bleaching]], as happened during the 1998 and 2004 [[El Niño]] years, in which [[sea surface temperature]]s rose well above normal, bleaching and killing many reefs. Bleaching may be caused by different triggers, including High sea surface temperature (SST), pollution, or other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ocean|last=|first=|publisher=DK|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=152–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; SST coupled with high irradiance (light intensity), triggers the loss of [[zooxanthellae]], a [[symbiotic]] single cell algae that gives the coral its color and the coral's [[dinoflagellate]] pigmentation, which turns the coral white when it is expelled, which can kill the coral. Zooxanthellae provide up to 90% of their hosts' energy supply.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Healthy reefs can often recover from bleaching if water temperatures cool. However, recovery may not be possible if {{chem|CO|2}} levels rise to 500 [[Parts per million|ppm]] because concentrations of carbonate ions may then be too low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=40021 |title=Environment: Between a Reef and a Hard Place |last=Leahy |first=Stephen |year=2007 |publisher=NoticiasFinancieras |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008064436/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=40021 |archivedate=2009-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoegh-Guldberg|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warming seawater may also encourage an emerging problem: coral disease. Weakened by warm water, coral is much more prone to diseases including [[black band disease]], [[white band disease]] and [[skeletal eroding band]]. If global temperatures increase by 2&amp;nbsp;°C during the twenty-first century, coral may not be able to adapt quickly enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Warming seawater is also expected to cause migrations in fish populations to compensate for the change. This puts coral reefs and their associated species at risk of [[invasive species|invasion]] and may cause their extinction if they are unable to compete with the invading populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=S. |last=Airamé |title=Climate Change, Coral Reef Ecosystems, and Management Options for Marine Protected Areas. |volume=44 |issue=6 |date=June 2009 |pmc=2791481 |pmid=19636605 |doi=10.1007/s00267-009-9346-0|bibcode = 2009EnMan..44.1069K |journal=Environmental Management |pages=1069–1088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 report by the [[Institute of Physics]] predicts that unless the national targets set by the [[Copenhagen Accord]] are amended to eliminate loopholes, then by 2100 global temperatures could rise by 4.2&amp;nbsp;°C and result in an end to coral reefs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iop.org/news/sep10/page_44805.html Climate Accord loopholes could spell 4.2°C rise in temperature and end of coral reefs by 2100] ''[[Institute of Physics]]'', Press release, 29 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rogelj J, Chen C, Nabel J, Macey K, Hare W, Schaeffer M, Markmann K, Höhne N, Andersen KK |display-authors=etal | year = 2010 | title =Analysis of the Copenhagen Accord pledges and its global climatic impacts—a snapshot of dissonant ambitions | url =https://www.iop.org/news/sep10/page_44805.html | journal = Environmental Research Letters | publisher = [[Institute of Physics]] | volume = 5 | issue = | page = 3 | doi = 10.1088/1748-9326/5/3/034013 |bibcode = 2010ERL.....5c4013R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ocean acidification===
{{Main|Ocean acidification}}
[[File:Isidella tentaculum - NOAA.jpg|thumb|[[Bamboo coral]] is an early harbinger of ocean acidification]]

[[File:Ocellaris clownfish.JPG|thumb|left|Higher levels of carbon dioxide in the water harms the ability of young clown and damsel fishes to smell and hear]]

Rising carbon dioxide levels could confuse brain signaling in fish. In 2012, researchers reported on their results after studying the behaviour of baby [[Clownfish|clown]] and [[damselfish]]es for several years in water with elevated levels of dissolved carbon dioxide, in line with what may exist by the end of the century. They found that the higher carbon dioxide disrupted a key brain [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] in the fish, interfering with [[neurotransmitter]] functions. The damaged central nervous systems affected fish behaviour and diminishing their sensory capacity to a point "likely to impair their chances of survival".

===Disease===

Disease is a serious threat to many coral species. The diseases of coral may consist of bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic infections. Due to many of the dramatic changes in climate and stress caused by pollution, coral become more vulnerable to diseases. Some examples of coral disease are vibrio, white syndrome, white band, rapid wasting disease, and many more.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pierce.ctc.edu:2189/ehost/detail/detail?vid=14&amp;sid=f278f495-82f3-4790-a5bf-2bf8783710ca%40sessionmgr4010&amp;hid=4114&amp;bdata=JnNjb3BlPXNpdGU%3d#AN=503444154&amp;db=scf|title=Emerging Infections on the Reefs|last=Bruckner|first=Andrew and Robin|date=1998|website=EBSCO|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; These diseases have different effects on the corals, ranging from damaging individual corals, killing individual coral, or even wiping out entire reefs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the Caribbean, white band disease is one of the primary causes for the death of over eighty percent of Staghorn and Elkhorn coral (Reef Resilience). It is a disease that can destroy miles of coral reef fast. 
A disease such as white plague can spread over a coral colony by a half an inch a day. By the time the disease has fully taken over the colony, it leaves behind a dead skeleton. Dead standing coral structures are what most people see after disease has taken over a reef.

===Other issues===

[[File:CoralSandAruba.jpg|thumb|[[Coral sand]] from a beach on [[Aruba]], [[Caribbean Sea]].]]

Within the last 20 years, once-prolific [[seagrass meadow]]s and [[mangrove forest]]s, which absorb massive amounts of nutrients and [[sediment]], have been destroyed. Both the loss of wetlands, mangrove habitats and seagrass meadows affect the [[water quality]] of inshore reefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Australian Government Productivity Commission|year=2003|title=Industries, Land Use and Water Quality in the Great Barrier Reef Catchment – Key Points| url= http://www.pc.gov.au/study/gbr/finalreport/keypoints.html|accessdate=29 May 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060906134413/http://www.pc.gov.au/study/gbr/finalreport/keypoints.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 6 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coral sand|Coral mining]] is another threat. Both small scale harvesting by villagers and industrial scale mining by companies are serious threats. Mining is usually done to produce construction material which is valued as much as 50% cheaper than other rocks, such as from [[quarries]].&lt;ref name="The Greenpeace Book of Coral Reefs"&gt;The Greenpeace Book of Coral Reefs&lt;/ref&gt; The rocks are ground and mixed with other materials, like cement to make concrete. Ancient coral used for construction is known as [[coral rag]]. Building directly on the reef also takes its toll, altering water circulation and the tides which bring the nutrients to the reef. The pressing reason for building on reefs is simply lack of space.

Boats and ships require access points into bays and islands to load and unload cargo and people. For this, parts of reefs are often chopped away to clear a path. Negative consequences can include altered water circulation and altered [[tide|tidal]] patterns which can disrupt the reef's nutrient supply; sometimes destroying a great part of the reef. [[Fishing vessel]]s and other large boats occasionally run aground on a reef. Two types of damage can result. Collision damage occurs when a coral reef is crushed and split by a vessel's hull into multiple fragments. Scarring occurs when boat propellers tear off the live coral and expose the skeleton. The physical damage can be noticed as striations. [[Mooring (watercraft)|Mooring]] causes damage which can be reduced by using mooring [[buoy]]s. Buoys can attach to the seafloor using concrete blocks as weights or by penetrating the seafloor, which further reduces damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2003/jan03/noaa03r402.html|title=Department of Commerce Awards Bronze Medal to Florida Biologist John Halas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Tetiaroa#Future_of_Teti'aroa|reef docks]] can be used to move over goods from large, seagoing vessels to small, flat-bottomed vessels. 

Coral in Taiwan is being threatened by the influx of human population growth. Since 2007, several local environmental groups conducted research and found that much of the coral populations are being affected by untreated sewage, an influx of tourists taking corals for souvenirs, without fully understanding the destructive impact on the coral's ecological system. Researchers reported to the Taiwanese government that many coral populations have turned black in the southeast coast of Taiwan. Potentially, this could lead to loss of food supply, medicinal sources and tourism due to the breakdown of the food chain.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, R. (Feb. 6, 2009).

==Threatened species==
The global standard for recording [[threatened species|threatened]] marine species is the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] Red List of Threatened Species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/static/introduction The 2008 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706005808/http://www.iucnredlist.org/static/introduction |date=July 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This list is the foundation for marine conservation priorities worldwide. A species is listed in the threatened category if it is considered to be [[Critically endangered species|critically endangered]], [[Endangered species|endangered]], or [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]]. Other categories are [[near threatened]] and [[data deficient]]. By 2008, the [[IUCN]] had assessed all 845 known reef-building corals species, marking 27% as [[threatened species|Threatened]] 20% as [[near threatened]] and 17% as [[data deficient]].&lt;ref name="IUCN factsheet"&gt;[[IUCN]]: [http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/status_of_the_world_s_marine_species.pdf Status of the world's marine species]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Coral Triangle|coral triangle]] (Indo-Malay-Philippine archipelago) region has the highest number of reef-building coral species in threatened category as well as the highest coral species diversity. The loss of coral reef ecosystems will have devastating effects on many marine species, as well as on people that depend on reef resources for their livelihoods.&lt;ref name="IUCN factsheet"/&gt;

===Southeast Asia===
{{See also|Southeast Asia coral reefs}}
Southeast Asian coral reefs are at risk from damaging [[fishing]] practices (such as [[Cyanide fishing|cyanide]] and [[blast fishing]]), [[overfishing]], sedimentation, pollution and bleaching. Activities including education, regulation and the establishment of [[marine protected area]]s help protect these reefs.

====Indonesia====
[[Indonesia]] is home to one-third of the world's coral reefs, with coral that covers nearly {{convert|85000|km2}} and is home to one-quarter of its fish [[species]]. Indonesia's coral reefs are located in the heart of the [[Coral Triangle]] and have fallen victim to destructive fishing, tourism and bleaching. Data from LIPI in 1998 found that only 7 percent is in excellent condition, 24 percent is in good condition and approximately 69 percent is in poor-to-fair condition. According to one source, Indonesia will lose 70 percent of its coral reef by 2050 if restoration action does not occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mengenali Sumberdaya Pesisir dan Laut|url=http://ipmawatisusan.blogspot.com/2010/11/mengenali-sumberdaya-pesisir-dan-laut.html|work=Pelajar Progressif|publisher=Google, Inc.|accessdate=22 April 2013|author=Ditulis oleh susan|language=Malay|date=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caribbean===
It has been estimated that 50% of the [[Caribbean sea]] coral cover has disappeared since the 1960s. According to a [[United Nations Environment Program]] report, the [[Caribbean]] coral reefs might face [[Local extinction|extirpation]] in next 20 years due to population expansion along the coast lines, overfishing, the pollution of coastal areas, global warming, and invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caribbean coral reefs may disappear within 20 years: Report |url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/07/caribbean-coral-reefs-may-disappear-within-20-years-report/|work=IANS|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Esra'a Al Shafei, according to her own account, recalls witnessing inhumane treatment of migrant workers as a child. This, along with stereotypical media portrayals of middle eastern youth, prompted her to found the Mideast Youth network.&lt;ref name="Gulli"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.simoncolumbus.com/2009/07/19/interview-with-esraa-al-shafei-on-freedom-of-expression-in-the-middle-east/ |title = Interview with Esra’a Al Shafei on freedom of expression in the Middle East |author = Simon Columbus |agency = Gulli |date = 19 July 2009 |accessdate = 28 April 2011 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111009132000/http://www.simoncolumbus.com/2009/07/19/interview-with-esraa-al-shafei-on-freedom-of-expression-in-the-middle-east/ |archivedate = 9 October 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the network expanded to include other civil rights issues within the Middle East, and branched out to create a diverse range of platforms with a global reach.

In engineering, a '''factor of safety''' ('''FoS'''), also known as (and used interchangeably with) '''safety factor''' ('''SF'''), expresses how much stronger a system is than it needs to be for an intended load. Safety factors are often calculated using detailed analysis because comprehensive testing is impractical on many projects, such as bridges and buildings, but the structure's ability to carry a load must be determined to a reasonable accuracy.

Many systems are intentionally built much stronger than needed for normal usage to allow for emergency situations, unexpected loads, misuse, or degradation ([[reliability engineering|reliability]]).

== Definition ==
There are two definitions for the factor of safety:  

#The ratio of a structure's absolute strength (structural capability) to actual applied load; this is a measure of the [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] of a particular design. This a calculated value, and is sometimes referred to, for the sake of clarity, as a ''realized factor of safety''.
#A constant required value, imposed by [[law]], [[Technical standard|standard]], [[specification]], [[contract]] or [[Convention (norm)|custom]], to which a structure must conform or exceed. This can be referred to as a ''design factor'', ''design factor of safety'' or ''required factor of safety''.

The realized factor of safety must be greater than the required ''design factor of safety''. However, between various industries and engineering groups usage is inconsistent and confusing; it is important to be aware of which definition(s) are being used. The cause of much confusion is that various reference books and standards agencies use the factor of safety definitions and terms differently. Design codes and [[structural engineering|structural]] and [[mechanical engineering]] textbooks often use "Factor of Safety" to mean the fraction of total structural capability over that needed and are ''realized factor of safety''&lt;ref&gt;Young, W.: ''Roark's Formulas for Stress and Strain'', 6th edition. McGraw-Hill, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shigley, J and Mischke, C: ''Standard Handbook of Machine Design'', page 2-15. McGraw-Hill, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ASME BTH-1: ''Design of Below-the-Hook Lifting Devices'', Section 1-5, ASME, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; (first use). Many undergraduate [[Strength of Materials]] books use "Factor of Safety" as a constant value intended as a minimum target for design&lt;ref&gt;Beer, F and Johnson, R: ''Mechanics of Materials'', second edition. McGraw-Hill,1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Timoshenko, S: ''Strength of Materials'', Volume 1. Krieger, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, G: ''Mechanics of Materials'', Page 55. Holt, Reinhart, and Watson,1988.&lt;/ref&gt; (second use).

== Calculation ==
There are several ways to compare the factor of safety for structures. All the different calculations fundamentally measure the same thing: how much extra load beyond what is intended a structure will actually take (or be required to withstand). The difference between the methods is the way in which the values are calculated and compared. Safety factor values can be thought of as a standardized way for comparing strength and reliability between systems.

The use of a factor of safety does not imply that an item, structure, or design is "safe".  Many [[quality assurance]], [[engineering design]], [[manufacturing]], installation, and end-use factors may influence whether or not something is safe in any particular situation.

=== Design factor and safety factor ===

The difference
between the safety factor and design factor (design safety factor) is as follows: The safety factor, or yield stress, is how much the designed part actually will be able to withstand (first "use" from above). The design factor, or working stress, is what the item is required to be able to withstand (second "use"). The design factor is defined for an application (generally provided in advance and often set by regulatory code or policy) and is not an actual calculation, the safety factor is a ratio of maximum strength to intended load for the actual item that was designed.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Factor of Safety}=\frac{\text{yield stress}}{\text{working stress}}&lt;/math&gt;
*Design load being the maximum load the part should ever see in service.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By this definition, a structure with a FOS of exactly 1 will support only the design load and no more. Any additional load will cause the structure to fail. A structure with a FOS of 2 will fail at twice the design load.

=== Margin of safety ===

Many government agencies and industries (such as aerospace) require the use of a '''margin of safety''' ('''MoS''' or '''M.S.''') to describe the ratio of the strength of the structure to the requirements. There are two separate definitions for the margin of safety so care is needed to determine which is being used for a given application.  One usage of M.S. is as a measure of capability like FoS.  The other usage of M.S. is as a measure of satisfying design requirements (requirement verification).  Margin of safety can be conceptualized (along with the reserve factor explained below) to represent how much of the structure's total capability is held "in reserve" during loading.

'''M.S. as a measure of structural capability:''' This definition of margin of safety commonly seen in textbooks&lt;ref&gt;Burr, A and Cheatham, J: ''Mechanical Design and Analysis'', 2nd edition, section 5.2. Prentice-Hall, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juvinall, R: ''Stress, Strain, and Strength'',  section 14.13, Page 295. McGraw-Hill, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; basically says that if the part is loaded to the maximum load it should ever see in service, how many more loads of the same force can it withstand before failing. In effect, this is a measure of excess capability. If the margin is 0, the part will not take any additional load before it fails, if it is negative the part will fail before reaching its design load in service. If the margin is 1, it can withstand one additional load of equal force to the maximum load it was designed to support (i.e. twice the design load).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Margin of Safety}=\frac{\text{Failure Load}}{\text{Design Load}}-1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Margin of Safety}={\text{Factor of Safety}}-1&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''M.S. as a measure of requirement verification:'''  Many agencies and organizations such as [[NASA]]&lt;ref&gt;NASA-STD-5001: ''Structural Design and Test Factors for Spaceflight Hardware'', section 3. NASA, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[AIAA]]&lt;ref&gt;AIAA S-110: ''Space Systems - Structures, Structural Components, and Structural Assemblies'', section 4.2. AIAA, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; define the margin of safety including the design factor, in other words, the margin of safety is calculated after applying the design factor. In the case of a margin of 0, the part is at exactly the '''required''' strength (the safety factor would equal the design factor). If there is a part with a required design factor of 3 and a margin of 1, the part would have a safety factor of 6 (capable of supporting two loads equal to its design factor of 3, supporting six times the design load before failure). A margin of 0 would mean the part would pass with a safety factor of 3. If the margin is less than 0 in this definition, although the part will not necessarily fail, the design requirement has not been met. A convenience of this usage is that for all applications, a margin of 0 or higher is passing, one does not need to know application details or compare against requirements, just glancing at the margin calculation tells whether the design passes or not. This is helpful for oversight and reviewing on projects with various integrated components, as different components may have various design factors involved and the margin calculation helps prevent confusion.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Design Safety Factor  = [Provided as requirement]
&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Margin of Safety}=\frac{\text{Failure Load}}{\text{Design Load × Design Safety Factor}}-1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Margin of Safety}=\frac{\text{Realized Factor of Safety}}{\text{Design Safety Factor}}-1&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For a successful design, the Realized Safety Factor must always equal or exceed the Design Safety Factor so the Margin of Safety is greater than or equal to zero.  The Margin of Safety is sometimes, but infrequently, used as a percentage, i.e., a 0.50 M.S is equivalent to a 50% M.S.  When a design satisfies this test it is said to have a "positive margin," and, conversely, a “negative margin” when it does not.

In the field of Nuclear Safety (as implemented at U.S. government owned facilities) the Margin of Safety has been defined as a quantity that may not be reduced without review by the controlling government office. The U.S. Department of Energy publishes DOE G 424.1-1, "Implementation Guide for Use in Addressing Unreviewed Safety Question Requirements" as a guide for determining how to identify and determine whether a margin of safety will be reduced by a proposed change.  The guide develops and applies the concept of a qualitative margin of safety that may not be explicit or quantifiable, yet can be evaluated conceptually to determine whether an increase or decrease will occur with a proposed change. This approach becomes important when examining designs with large or undefined (historical) margins and those that depend on 'soft' controls such as programmatic limits or requirements. The commercial U.S. nuclear industry utilized a similar concept in evaluating planned changes until 2001, when 10 CFR 50.59 was revised to capture and apply the information available in facility-specific risk analyses and other quantitative risk management tools.

=== Reserve factor ===

A measure of strength frequently used in Europe is the '''Reserve Factor (RF)'''.  With the strength and applied loads expressed in the same units, the Reserve Factor is defined as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
RF = Proof Strength / Proof Load
&lt;br/&gt;
RF = Ultimate Strength / Ultimate Load
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The applied loads have any factors, including factors of safety applied.

== Yield and ultimate calculations ==

For ductile materials (e.g. most metals), it is often required that the factor of safety be checked against both [[yield strength|yield]] and [[ultimate strength|ultimate]] strengths. The yield calculation will determine the safety factor until the part starts to [[Plastic deformation|plastically deform]]. The ultimate calculation will determine the safety factor until failure. On brittle materials these values are often so close as to be indistinguishable, so is it usually acceptable to only calculate the ultimate safety factor.

== Choosing design factors ==

Appropriate design factors are based on several considerations, such as the [[accuracy]] of predictions on the imposed [[Structural load|loads]], strength, [[wear]] estimates, and the [[Environment (systems)|environmental]] effects to which the product will be exposed in service; the consequences of engineering failure; and the cost of over-engineering the component to achieve that factor of safety. For example, components whose [[failure]] could result in substantial financial loss, serious injury, or death may use a safety factor of four or higher (often ten).  Non-critical components generally might have a design factor of two. [[Risk analysis (engineering)|Risk analysis]], [[failure mode and effects analysis]], and other tools are commonly used. Design factors for specific applications are often mandated by law, policy, or industry standards.

Buildings commonly use a factor of safety of 2.0 for each structural member.  The value for buildings is relatively low because the loads are well understood and most structures are [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundant]]. [[Pressure vessel]]s use 3.5 to 4.0, automobiles use 3.0, and aircraft and spacecraft use 1.2 to 3.0 depending on the application and materials.  [[Ductility|Ductile]], metallic materials tend to use the lower value while [[brittle]] materials use the higher values.  The field of [[aerospace engineering]] uses generally lower design factors because the costs associated with structural weight are high (i.e. an aircraft with an overall safety factor of 5 would probably be too heavy to get off the ground). This low design factor is why aerospace parts and materials are subject to very stringent [[quality control]] and strict preventative maintenance schedules to help ensure reliability. A usually applied Safety Factor is 1.5, but for pressurized fuselage it is 2.0, and for main landing gear structures it is often 1.25.&lt;ref&gt;Burr, A and Cheatham, J: Mechanical Design and Analysis, 2nd edition, section 5.2. Prentice-Hall, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases it is impractical or impossible for a part to meet the "standard" design factor. The penalties (mass or otherwise) for meeting the requirement would prevent the system from being viable (such as in the case of aircraft or spacecraft). In these cases, it is sometimes determined to allow a component to meet a lower than normal safety factor, often referred to as "waiving" the requirement. Doing this often brings with it extra detailed analysis or quality control verifications to assure the part will perform as desired, as it will be loaded closer to its limits.

For loading that is cyclical, repetitive, or fluctuating, it is important to consider the possibility of [[metal fatigue]] when choosing factor of safety.  A cyclic load well below a material's yield strength can cause failure if it is repeated through enough cycles.

'''Generosity''' (also called largess) is the virtue of being unattached to material possessions, often symbolized by the giving of [[gift|gifts]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Pakaluk, ''Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics: An Introduction'', 2005, p. 173 explains the translation difficulties and names ''generosity'' as the least bad translation of Greek ''eleutheriotes'' ([https://books.google.ee/books?id=c1ZR3AU2WIwC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq=eleutheriotes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=x2dWc48SmO&amp;sig=yH411BOBRI3g7wSDJyWViC-FVgY&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bVRPVa-XBsmGywP1uYCACg&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=eleutheriotes&amp;f=false Google Books])&lt;/ref&gt; Generosity is regarded as a [[virtue]] by various world religions, and is often celebrated in cultural and religious ceremonies. Scientific investigation into generosity has examined the effect of a number of scenarios and games on individuals' generosity, and potential links with [[neurochemicals]] such as [[oxytocin]], and relationship with similar feelings, such as that of [[empathy]].

==Other uses==
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=The most generous of people is the one who gives to those from whom he has no hope of return.|salign=right |source=— [[Husain ibn Ali]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Saying of Imam Hussain |url=https://aliimmam.com/tag/imam-hussain-whoishussian/page/2/ |website=POiSON WORLD |publisher=POiSON WORLD |accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Generosity is sometimes used to denote [[Charity (practice)|charity]], (the virtue of giving without expecting anything in return). It can involve offering time, assets or talents to aid someone in need. In times of [[natural disaster]], relief efforts are frequently provided, voluntarily, by individuals or groups acting unilaterally in making gifts of time, resources, goods, money, etc. Generosity is a guiding principle for many registered [[charities]], [[foundation (charity)|foundations]], and [[non-profit organization]]s.

Although the term generosity often goes hand-in-hand with charity, many people in the public's eye want recognition for their good deeds. Donations are needed to support organizations and committees, however, generosity should not be limited to times of great need such as natural disasters and extreme situations.

==Etymology==
The modern English word ''generosity'' derives from the Latin word ''generōsus'', which means "of noble birth", which itself was passed down to English through the Old French word ''généreux''. The Latin stem ''gener–'' is the [[declension]]al stem of ''genus'', meaning "kin", "clan", "race", or "stock", with the root Indo-European meaning of ''gen'' being "to beget". The same root gives the words ''genesis'', ''gentry'', ''gender'', ''genital'', ''gentile'', ''genealogy'', and ''genius'', among others.

Most recorded English uses of the word ''generous'' up to and during the sixteenth century reflect an aristocratic sense of being of noble lineage or high birth. To be generous was literally a way of complying with nobility.

During the 17th century, however, the meaning and use of the word began to change. ''Generosity'' came increasingly to identify not literal family heritage but a nobility of spirit thought to be associated with high birth—that is, with various admirable qualities that could now vary from person to person, depending not on family history but on whether a person actually possessed the qualities. In this way ''generosity'' increasingly came in the 17th century to signify a variety of traits of character and action historically associated (whether accurately or not) with the ideals of actual nobility: gallantry, courage, strength, richness, gentleness, and fairness. In addition to describing these diverse human qualities, ''generous'' became a word during this period used to describe fertile land, the strength of animal breeds, abundant provisions of food, vibrancy of colors, the strength of liquor, and the potency of medicine.

Then, during the 18th century, the meaning of ''generosity'' continued to evolve in directions denoting the more specific, contemporary meaning of munificence, open–handedness, and liberality in the giving of money and possessions to others. This more specific meaning came to dominate English usage by the 19th century. Over the last five centuries in the English speaking world, ''generosity'' developed from being primarily the description of an [[ascribed status]] pertaining to the elite nobility to being an achieved mark of admirable personal quality and action capable of being exercised in theory by any person who had learned virtue and noble character (Smith 2009).

==In religion==
[[File:Flickr - The U.S. Army - www.Army.mil (177).jpg|thumb|Members of the [[1st Sustainment Command (Theater)|US Army 1st Sustainment Command]] wrap [[Gift|Christmas gifts]] for soldiers stationed in or passing through [[Kuwait]], 2008]]
In [[Buddhism]], generosity is one of the [[Ten Perfections]] and is the [[antidote]] to the self-chosen [[poison]] called ''greed''. Generosity is known as [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] in the Bible, and [[Dāna|daan]] in the Eastern religious scriptures.

In [[Islam]] Quran states that whatever one gives away generously, with the intention of pleasing God, He will replace it. God knows what is in the hearts of men. Say: “Truly, my Lord enlarges the provision for whom He wills of His slaves, and also restricts it) for him, and whatsoever you spend of anything (in God’s Cause), He will replace it.  And He is the Best of providers.” (Quran 34:39)

In [[Christianity]], the [[Book of Acts]] states that [[Jesus]] said that giving is better than receiving ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2020:35&amp;version=NASB Acts 20:35]). 

===In knowledge===
* [[Missionary Church of Kopimism]] says that all knowledge is for everyone and copying or sharing information is sacred.
* According to the Bible, having all the knowledge in the world is useless, without the desire for charity (sharing):
{{"|'''And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.'''|[[s:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#Chapter 13|KJV: 1 Corinthians 13:2]]}}
{{"|'''And this I pray, that your charity may more and more abound in knowledge, and in all understanding '''| Douay-Rheims: Philippians 1:9&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drbo.org/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=57&amp;ch=1&amp;l=9#x|title=Douay-Rheims Catholic Bible, Philippians Chapter 1|author=|date=|website=DRBO.org|access-date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* In the Bible, obstruction of the flow of knowledge is suggested to be the destruction of mankind:
{{"|'''my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge. "Because you have rejected knowledge, I also reject you as my priests; because you have ignored the law of your God, I also will ignore your children."'''|[[s:Bible (American Standard)/Hosea#4|Hosea 4:6]]}}
* '''Vidya Daan'''(विद्या दान) translated as ''knowledge charity'', a concept in [[Dāna|daan]], is a [[Niyama|tenet]] of all [[Indian religions|Dharmic religions]] that also values the sharing of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanskrit.us/vidya.html|title=विद्या - Vidya (knowledge)|author=|date=|website=www.Sanskrit.us|access-date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vidyadaan.in/about/|title=About|author=|date=28 April 2009|website=Vidyadaan.in|access-date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Gyan yoga'''/'''[[Jnana yoga]]'''(ज्ञान योग) translated as ''wisdom exercise'' or ''knowledge path'', is the sacred search for true knowledge, in all Dharmic religions.
* In Hinduism, [[Vidya|right knowledge]] is a form of God, and anything knowledge is written or recorded on is considered sacred, to be protected from obscurity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''अपूर्व: कोपि कोशोयं विद्यते तव भारति |&lt;br/&gt;व्ययतो वॄद्धिम् आयाति क्षयम् आयाति संचयात् ||'''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Translation: Oh Goddess Saraswati, your treasure of knowledge ([[Vidya]]) is indeed very amazing! If used(shared) it grows and if unused(obscured) it shrinks!
*In Islam, the [[prophet Muhammad]] said: "'''Wisdom is the lost property of the faithful; wherever he finds it he has the right to take it'''"&lt;ref&gt;Sunan Tirmidhi Tradition:4159, Sunan Ibn Majah Tradition:9784, Ibid Tradition:9785, Mishkat al-Masabih Tradition:216&lt;/ref&gt;
:Prophet Muhammad also said: "Whoever is asked about a knowledge that he knows about and then hides it and keeps it away, he will be bridled on the day of judgement with a bridle of fire."&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:en:Selections from Muhammadan Traditions/II|Ahmad, Abu Dawood, and Al-Tirmidhi]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and scholarship ==
Research has shown that generosity is associated with [[empathy]]. In this research, by  [[Paul J. Zak]] and colleagues and published in Public Library of Science ONE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosone.org/home.action|title=PLOS ONE: accelerating the publication of peer-reviewed science|author=|date=|website=www.PLOSONE.org|access-date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[peptide]] [[oxytocin]] or placebo was given to about 100 men and then they made several decisions regarding money.  One, the [[Dictator Game]], was used to measure altruism by asking people to make a unilateral transfer of $10 they were given by the experimenters to a stranger in the lab; oxytocin had no effect on altruism.

Another task, the [[Ultimatum Game]], was used to measure generosity. In this game, one person was endowed with $10 and was asked to offer some split of it to another person in the lab, all done by computer.  If the second person did not like the split, he could reject it (for example, if it was stingy) and both people would get zero.  In a clever twist, the researchers told participants they would be randomly chosen to be ''either'' the person making the offer or the person responding to it. This required the person making the offer to take the other's perspective explicitly. Generosity was defined as an offer greater than the minimum amount needed for acceptance. Oxytocin increased generosity 80% compared to those on placebo. In addition, oxytocin was quantitatively twice as important in predicting generosity as was altruism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001128|title=Oxytocin Increases Generosity in Humans|first1=Paul J.|last1=Zak|first2=Angela A.|last2=Stanton|first3=Sheila|last3=Ahmadi|date=7 November 2007|publisher=|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=2|issue=11|pages=e1128|access-date=30 June 2017|via=PLoS Journals|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001128|pmid=17987115|pmc=2040517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The science of generosity initiative at the [[University of Notre Dame]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://generosityresearch.nd.edu/|title=Science of Generosity // University of Notre Dame|first=RKD // AgencyND // University of Notre|last=Dame|date=|website=GenerosityResearch.nd.edu|access-date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is investigating the sources, origins, and causes of generosity; manifestations and expressions of generosity; and consequences of generosity for both the givers and receivers involved. Generosity for the purposes of this project is defined as the virtue of giving good things to others freely and abundantly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1222">In [[category theory]], a branch of mathematics, a '''globular set''' is a higher-dimensional generalization of a [[directed graph]]. Precisely, it is a sequence of sets &lt;math&gt;X_0, X_1, X_2, \dots&lt;/math&gt; equipped with pairs of functions &lt;math&gt;s_n, t_n: X_n \to X_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; such that
* &lt;math&gt;s_n \circ s_{n+1} = s_n \circ t_{n+1},&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;t_n \circ s_{n+1} = t_n \circ t_{n+1}.&lt;/math&gt;
(Equivalently, it is a presheaf on the category of “globes”.) The letters "''s''", "''t''" stand for "source" and "target" and one imagines &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt; consists of directed edges at level&amp;nbsp;''n''.

A variant of the notion was used by [[Grothendieck]] to introduce the notion of an [[∞-groupoid]]. Extending Grothendieck's work, {{harv|Maltsiniotis|2010}} gave a definition of a [[weak ∞-category]] in terms of globular sets.

[[Image:Greek manuscript minuscule Aristotle.png|thumb|right|250px|Later minuscule, 15th-century manuscript of [[Aristotle]].]]
The '''minuscule''' script was a [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] writing style which was developed as a book hand in [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] manuscripts during the 9th and 10th centuries.&lt;ref name="thompson"/&gt; It replaced the earlier style of [[uncial script|uncial]] writing, from which it differed in using smaller, more rounded and more connected letter forms, and in using a large number of [[Greek ligatures|ligatures]]. Many of these forms had previously developed as parts of more informal [[cursive]] writing. The basic letter shapes used in the minuscule script are the ancestors of modern [[lower case]] Greek letters.

From the 10th century onwards, most Byzantine manuscripts of classical and early Christian Greek works were gradually rewritten in the new minuscule style, and few of the older uncial manuscripts were preserved. For this reason, uncial manuscripts are today extremely rare, while early minuscule manuscripts are often the oldest preserved sources attesting an ancient work and may therefore be of central importance for its [[philology|philological]] study. Manuscripts from the oldest phase of minuscule writing (mid-9th to mid-10th century) are known in scholarship today as ''codices vetustissimi'' ("oldest codices"). Those from the mid-10th to the mid-12th centuries are known as ''codices vetusti'' ("old codices"), and later ones as ''codices recentiores'' ("newer codices").&lt;ref name="thompson159"/&gt;

Minuscule writing remained in use for handwriting throughout the Byzantine and into the post-Byzantine era. In the modern era, western printers used minuscule book hands as a model for developing early Greek print fonts. Like with Latin, it became common to mix minuscule writing with some uncial or [[Capital letter|capital]] letters, with the latter used for emphasis, in titles and initials. From this practice, the modern orthographic system of [[letter case]] for Greek arose. In modern Greek writing, the upper case letters are generally modeled on the letter shapes of ancient inscriptions, while the lower case letters are based on the tradition of minuscule handwriting.

A '''habit''' (or '''wont''') is a routine of [[behavior]] that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Gillian; Hope, Tony. ''Managing Your Mind: The mental fitness guide''. Oxford Paperbacks, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/habit Definition of ''Habit'']. ''Merriam Webster Dictionary''. Retrieved on August 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MerriamWebster1"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/habituation Definition of ''Habituation'']. ''Merriam Webster Dictionary''. Retrieved on August 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[American Journal of Psychology]]'' (1903) defines a "habit, from the standpoint of psychology, [as] a more or less fixed  way of thinking,  willing,  or feeling acquired through previous repetition of a mental experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Habitual behavior often goes unnoticed in persons exhibiting it, because a person does not need to engage in self-analysis when undertaking routine tasks.  Habits are sometimes compulsory.&lt;ref name="MerriamWebster1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animalbehavioronline.com/habituation.html "Habituation."] Animalbehavioronline.com. Retrieved on August 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; New behaviours can become automatic through the process of '''habit formation'''. Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns which humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Rosenthal|first= Norman|title= Habit Formation|url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/habit-formation|publisher= Sussex Directories|accessdate= November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is possible to form new habits through repetition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/habit-formation|title= Habit Formation|work= psychologytoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action. This increases the [[automaticity]] of the behavior in that context.&lt;ref name="g2007_Wood_Neal"&gt;{{cite journal

== Formation ==
Habit formation is the process by which a behavior, through regular repetition, becomes automatic or habitual. This is modelled as an increase in automaticity with number of repetitions up to an [[asymptote]].&lt;ref&gt;Hull, C. L. (1943). ''Principles of behavior: An introduction to behavior theory.'' New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hull, C. L. (1951). ''Essentials of behavior.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lally"&gt;Lally, P., van Jaarsveld, C. H. M., Potts, H. W. W., &amp; Wardle, J. (2010). How are habits formed: Modelling habit formation in the real world. ''European Journal of Social Psychology''. October 2010. '''40'''(6), 998–1009. {{DOI|10.1002/ejsp.674}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process of habit formation can be slow. Lally ''et al.'' (2010) found the average time for participants to reach the asymptote of automaticity was 66 days with a range of 18–254 days.&lt;ref name="Lally" /&gt;

As the habit is forming, it can be analysed in three parts: the cue, the behavior, and the reward. The cue is the thing that causes the habit to come about, the trigger of the habitual behavior. This could be anything that one's mind associates with that habit and one will automatically let a habit come to the surface. The behavior is the actual habit that one exhibits, and the reward, a positive feeling, therefore continues the "habit loop".&lt;ref&gt;Duhigg, C. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.npr.org/2012/03/05/147192599/habits-how-they-form-and-how-to-break-them&lt;/ref&gt; A habit may initially be triggered by a goal, but over time that goal becomes less necessary and the habit becomes more automatic.

A variety of digital tools, online or mobile apps, have been introduced that are designed to support habit formation. For example, Habitica is a system that uses [[gamification]], implementing strategies found in video games to real life tasks by adding rewards such as experience and gold.&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, Sebastian, et al. "Gamification. using game-design elements in non-gaming contexts." CHI'11 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems. ACM, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A review of such tools, however, suggests most are poorly designed with respect to theory and fail to support the development of automaticity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2556288.2557079 Stawarz, K., Cox, A. L., &amp; Blandford, A. (2014)]. Don't forget your pill!: Designing effective medication reminder apps that support users' daily routines. Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI-2014), 2269–2278. New York: ACM.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chi-med.ac.uk/publicdocs/WP296.pdf Stawarz, K., Cox, A. L., &amp; Blandford, A.

New York: ACM.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shopping habits are particularly vulnerable to change at "major life moments" like graduation, marriage, birth of first child, moving to a new home, and divorce.  Some stores use purchase data to try to detect these events and take advantage of the marketing opportunity.&lt;ref name="think"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kera.org/2012/03/14/habits-life-and-business/|title=Habits, Life, and Business - Think|website=www.kera.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some habits are known as "keystone habits", and these influence the formation of other habits.  For example, identifying as the type of person who takes care of their body and is in the habit of exercising regularly, can also influence eating better and using credit cards less.  In business, safety can be a keystone habit that influences other habits that result in greater productivity.&lt;ref name="think" /&gt;

A recent study by Adriaanse et al. (2014) found that habits mediate the relationship between self-control and unhealthy snack consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adriaanse|first=Marieke A.|last2=Kroese|first2=Floor M.|last3=Gillebaart|first3=Marleen|last4=Ridder|first4=De|last5=D|first5=Denise T.|date=2014|title=Effortless inhibition: habit mediates the relation between self-control and unhealthy snack consumption|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00444/full|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00444|issn=1664-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the study empirically demonstrate that high-self control may influence the formation of habits and in turn affect behavior. 

== Goals ==
The habit–goal interface or interaction is constrained by the particular manner in which habits are learned and represented in memory. Specifically, the associative learning underlying habits is characterized by the slow, incremental accrual of information over time in procedural memory.&lt;ref name="g2007_Wood_Neal" /&gt; Habits can either benefit or hurt the goals a person sets for themselves.

Goals guide habits by providing the initial outcome-oriented motivation for response repetition. In this sense, habits are often a trace of past goal pursuit.&lt;ref name="g2007_Wood_Neal" /&gt; Although, when a habit forces one action, but a conscious goal pushes for another action, an oppositional context occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Gilbert, Wegner. "''Psychology Second Edition''" (2011). New York: Worth Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; When the habit prevails over the conscious goal, a capture error has taken place.

Behavior prediction is also derived from goals. Behavior prediction is to acknowledge the likelihood that a habit will form, but in order to form that habit, a goal must have been initially present. The influence of goals on habits is what makes a habit different from other automatic processes in the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, D., Wood, W., Labrecque, J., &amp; Lally, P. (2011). How do habits guide behavior? perceived and actual triggers of habits in daily life . Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, (48), 492-498. Retrieved from http://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/545/docs/Wendy_Wood_Research_Articles/Habits/neal.wood.labrecque.lally.2012_001_How_do_habits_guide_behavior.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a description of a classic goal devaluation experiment (from a Scientific American MIND guest blog post called [http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/mind-guest-blog/2013/11/12/should-habits-or-goals-direct-your-life-it-depends-2/ Should Habits or Goals Direct Your Life? It Depends]) which demonstrates the difference between goal-directed and habitual behavior: &lt;blockquote&gt;A series of elegant experiments&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Dickinson (1985). Actions and Habits: The Development of Behavioural Autonomy. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, volume 308, pages 67—78. http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/308/1135/67&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by Anthony Dickinson and colleagues in the early 1980s at the University of Cambridge in England clearly exposes the behavioral differences between goal-directed and habitual processes. Basically, in the training phase, a rat was trained to press a lever in order to receive some food. Then, in a second phase, the rat was placed in a different cage without a lever and was given the food, but it was made ill whenever it ate the food. This caused the rat to "devalue" the food, because it associated the food with being ill, without directly associating the action of pressing the lever with being ill. Finally, in the test phase, the rat was placed in the original cage with the lever. (To prevent additional learning, no food was delivered in the test phase.) Rats that had undergone an extensive training phase continued to press the lever in the test phase even though the food was devalued; their behavior was called habitual. Rats that had undergone a moderate training phase did not, and their behavior was called goal-directed. …  [G]oal-directed behavior is explained by the rat using an explicit prediction of the consequence, or outcome, of an action to select that action. If the rat wants the food, it presses the lever, because it predicts that pressing the lever will deliver the food. If the food has been devalued, the rat will not press the lever. Habitual behavior is explained by a strong association between an action and the situation from which the action was executed. The rat presses the lever when it sees the lever, not because of the predicted outcome.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Nervousness ==
There are a number of habits possessed by individuals that can be classified as nervous habits. These include nail-biting, stammering, sniffling, and banging the head. They are known as symptoms of an emotional state and are generally based upon conditions of anxiety, insecurity, inferiority and tension. These habits are often formed at a young age and may be because of a need for attention. When trying to overcome a nervous habit it is important to resolve the cause of the nervous feeling rather than the symptom which is a habit itself or as a result one could experience anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, http://resolver.scholarsportal.info/resolve/00966347/v25i0004/324_tponh&lt;/ref&gt; Anxiety is a disorder known for excessive and unexpected worry that negatively impacts an individuals daily life, and routines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cmha.ca/mental-health/understanding-mental-illness/anxiety-disorders|title=Anxiety Disorders - CMHA National|work=CMHA National|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bad habits ==
A [[bad habit]] is an undesirable behavior pattern. Common examples include: [[procrastination]], [[fidgeting]], [[overspending]], and [[nail-biting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Breaking Bad Habits |author=Suzanne LeVert, Gary R. McClain |year=2001 |isbn=0-02-863986-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QYynTz-w-LQC |publisher=Alpha Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sooner one recognizes these bad habits, the easier it is to fix them.&lt;ref&gt;Murdock, KatharineTHE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NURSING, V. 19 (7), 04/1919, p. 503-506&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than merely attempting to eliminate a bad habit, it may be more productive to seek to replace it with a healthier coping mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jamesclear.com/how-to-break-a-bad-habit|title=How to Break a Bad Habit (and Replace It With a Good One)|date=2013-05-13|work=James Clear|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Will and intention ===
A key factor in distinguishing a bad habit from an [[behavioral addiction|addiction]] or [[mental disease]] is [[self control|willpower]]. If a person can easily control over the behavior, then it is a habit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Diseases of the Will: Alcohol and the Dilemmas of Freedom |author=Mariana Valverde |year=1998 |isbn=0-521-64469-0 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Kl5ugmvDgH0C |chapter=Disease or Habit? Alcoholism and the Exercise of Freedom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Good intentions can override the negative effect of bad habits, but their effect seems to be independent and additive—the bad habits remain, but are subdued rather than cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0992(199908/09)29:5/6&lt;591::AID-EJSP948&gt;3.0.CO;2-H |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/62002770/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 |title=Good intentions, bad habits, and effects of forming implementation intentions on healthy eating |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |volume=29 |issue=5–6 |pages=591–604 |date=21 Jun 1999 |author=Bas Verplanken, Suzanne Faes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elimination ===

Many techniques exist for removing established bad habits, e.g., ''withdrawal of reinforcers''—identifying and removing factors that trigger and reinforce the habit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=0-440-15413-8 |title=Don't Say Yes When You Want to Say No |author=Herbert Fensterheim, Jean Baer |year=1975 |publisher=Dell |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Aog4MHedR-kC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[basal ganglia]] appears to remember the context that triggers a habit, so habits can be revived if triggers reappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/MIT-explains-why-bad-habits-are-hard-to-break/2100-11395_3-5902850.html|title=MIT explains why bad habits are hard to break|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing and eliminating bad habits as soon as possible is advised. Habit elimination becomes more difficult with age because repetitions reinforce habits cumulatively over the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;Murdock, Katharine, The Psychology of Habit http://simplelink.library.utoronto.ca/url.cfm/350245 {{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Charles Duhigg]], there is a loop that includes a cue, routine and reward for every habit. An example of a habit loop is TV program ends (cue), go to the fridge (routine), eat a snack (reward). The key to changing habits is to identify your cue and modify your routine and reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://charlesduhigg.com/how-habits-work/|title=How Habits Work|work=charlesduhigg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Haraç'''  ({{lang-hy|խարջ / kharj}}, {{lang-mk|arač / арач}}, {{lang-gr|χαράτσι / charatsi}}, {{lang-sh|харач / harač}}) was a land tax levied on [[non-Muslim]]s in the [[Ottoman Empire]].

''Haraç'' was developed from an earlier form of land taxation, ''[[kharaj]]'' (''harac''), and was, in principle, only payable by non-Muslims; it was seen as a counterpart to [[zakat]] paid by [[Muslims]].&lt;ref name =Hunter&gt;Hunter, Malik and Senturk, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; The ''haraç'' system later merged into the [[cizye]] taxation system.

Haraç collection was reformed by a [[firman]] of 1834, which abolished the old levying system, and required that ''haraç'' be raised by a commission composed of the [[kadı]] and the ''ayans'', or municipal chiefs of ''[[Rayah|rayas]]'' in each district. The firman made several other changes to taxation.

'''Harry Gordon Frankfurt''' (born May 29, 1929) is an [[American philosopher]]. He is [[professor emeritus]] of [[philosophy]] at [[Princeton University]], where he taught from 1990 until 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholar.princeton.edu/fraharg/biocv |title=Bio &amp;#124; Harry G. Frankfurt |publisher=[[Princeton University]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and previously taught at [[Yale University]], [[Rockefeller University]], and [[Ohio State University]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Frankfurt was born on May 29, 1929, in Pennsylvania. He obtained his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1949 and [[Ph.D.]] in 1954 from [[Johns Hopkins University]].

===Career===
He is [[professor emeritus]] of [[philosophy]] at [[Princeton University]] and has previously taught at [[Yale University]], [[Rockefeller University]], and [[Ohio State University]].

His major areas of interest include [[moral philosophy]], [[philosophy of mind]] and [[philosophy of action|action]], and 17th-century [[rationalism]]. His 1986 paper ''[[On Bullshit]]'', a philosophical investigation of the concept of "bullshit", was republished as a book in 2005 and became a surprise [[bestseller]], leading to media appearances such as [[Jon Stewart]]'s ''[[The Daily Show]]''. In 2006 he released a companion book, ''On Truth'', which explores society's loss of appreciation for truth.

Among philosophers, he was for a time best known for his interpretation of [[Descartes]]'s rationalism.  His most influential work, however, has been on [[freedom of the will]] (on which he has written numerous important papers&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg; Shafer-Landau: ''Reason &amp; Responsibility'', p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt;) based on his concept of [[higher-order volition]]s and for developing what are known as "[[Frankfurt cases]]" or "Frankfurt counterexamples" (i.e., thought experiments designed to show the possibility of situations in which a person could not have done other than he/she did, but in which our intuition is to say nonetheless that this feature of the situation does not prevent that person from being morally responsible).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frankfurt|first=Harry G.|date=1969-01-01|title=Alternate Possibilities and Moral Responsibility|url=http://www.pdcnet.org/oom/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=&amp;rft.imuse_id=jphil_1969_0066_0023_0829_0839&amp;svc_id=info:www.pdcnet.org/collection|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=66|issue=23|doi=10.2307/2023833}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frankfurt is probably the leading living Humean compatibilist, developing Hume's view that to be free is to do what one wants to do.  (Others who develop this view are [[David Velleman]], Gary Watson and [[John Martin Fischer]].)  Frankfurt's version of [[compatibilism]] is  the subject of a substantial literature by other philosophy professors.  More recently, he has written on love and caring.

He is a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. He has been a Visiting Fellow of [[All Souls College]], [[Oxford University]]; he served as President, Eastern Division, [[American Philosophical Association]]; and he has received fellowships and grants from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]], the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], and the [[Andrew Mellon Foundation]].

==Description==
[[File:Infinity Mirror Effect.jpg|thumb|An infinity mirror effect viewed ''between'' the mirrors]]&lt;!-- This is the best image that could be found in a quick search; a clearer image would be  useful  --&gt;
In a classic self-contained infinity mirror, a set of light bulbs, [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]], or other point-source lights are placed around the periphery of a fully reflective mirror, and a second, partially reflective "[[one-way mirror]]" is placed a short distance in front of it, in a  [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] alignment. When an outside observer looks into the surface of the partially reflective mirror, the lights appear to recede into infinity, creating the appearance of a tunnel of lights of great depth.&lt;ref name="Finio" /&gt;

Alternatively, this effect can also be seen when an observer stands ''between'' two parallel fully reflective mirrors, as in some [[dressing room]]s, some [[elevator]]s, or a [[house of mirrors]].&lt;ref name="Gbur" /&gt; A weaker version of this effect can be seen by standing between any two parallel reflective surfaces, such as the glass walls of a small entry lobby into some buildings. The partially reflective glass produces this sensation, diluted by the [[visual noise]] of the views through the glass into the surrounding environment.

== Explanation of effect ==
[[File:Venus in Mirrors.jpg|thumb|Computer simulation image of repeatedly reflected shapes]]
The 3D illusion  mirror effect is produced whenever there are two parallel reflective surfaces which can bounce a beam of light back and forth an indefinite (theoretically infinite) number of times. The reflections appear to recede into the distance because the light actually is traversing the distance it appears to be traveling.  

For example, in a two-centimeter-thick infinity mirror, with the light sources halfway between, light from the source initially travels one centimeter.  The first reflection travels one centimeter to the rear mirror and then two centimeters to, and through the front mirror, a total of three centimeters.  The second reflection travels two centimeters from front mirror to back mirror, and again two centimeters from the back mirror to, and through the front mirror, totaling four centimeters, plus the first reflection (three centimeters) making the second reflection seven centimeters away from the front mirror.  Each successive reflection adds four more centimeters to the total (the third reflection appears 11 centimeters deep, fourth 15 centimeters deep, and so on).&lt;ref name="Gbur" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ExpSnack"&gt;{{cite web|title=Look Into Infinity|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/look_into_infinity/|website=Exploratorium Snacks|publisher=Exploratorium|accessdate=2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each additional reflection adds length to the path the light must travel before exiting the mirror. If the mirrors are not precisely parallel, but instead are canted at a slight angle, the "visual tunnel" will be perceived to be curved (off to one side) as it recedes into infinity.

When studied using the principles of [[geometrical optics]], the series of repeating images forms the infinite mathematical surface known as [[Gabriel's Horn]], or [[Torricelli's Trumpet]], named in honor of Italian mathematician [[Evangelista Torricelli]], who first studied it. In theory, such a surface is infinite in area, but encloses a finite volume.&lt;ref name="Gbur" /&gt;

==Cultural references==
Visual artists, especially contemporary [[sculpture|sculptors]], have made use of infinity mirrors. [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Josiah McElheny]], [[Ivan Navarro (artist)|Ivan Navarro]], and [[Taylor Davis (sculptor)|Taylor Davis]] have all produced works that use the infinity mirror to expand the sensation of unlimited space in their artworks.

Some [[amusement park]] [[dark ride]]s, such as Disney's "[[Space Mountain]]" roller coaster attraction, use infinity mirrors to create the impression of flying through space.

The '''International POPs Elimination Network''' ('''IPEN''') is a global network of [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s dedicated to the common aim of eliminating [[persistent organic pollutants]].

IPEN is composed of public interest non-governmental organizations who support a common platform for the global elimination of POPs. The Participating Organizations (POs) of IPEN are those NGOs which have endorsed the POPs Elimination Platform and/or the Stockholm Declaration. Because the network is primarily engaged in facilitating information exchange and in supporting activities of its constituents, and because the purpose of the network does not include developing network-wide-policy statements, strategies, or action plans, a formal decision-making process for the network can be simple, flexible, and largely administrative in nature. (IPEN 2005)

The International POPs Elimination Network (IPEN) is a global network of more than 600 public interest non-governmental organizations working together for the elimination of persistent organic pollutants, on an expedited yet socially equitable basis. This mission includes achieving a world in which all chemicals are produced and used in ways that eliminate significant adverse effects on human health and the environment, and where persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and chemicals of equivalent concern no longer pollute our local and global environments, and no longer contaminate our communities, our food, our bodies, or the bodies of our children and future generations.

In [[quantum mechanics]], the '''intrinsic parity''' is a [[phase factor]] that arises as an [[eigenvalue]] of the [[Parity (physics)|parity]] operation &lt;math&gt; x_i \rightarrow x_i' = -x_i&lt;/math&gt; (a reflection about the origin). To see that the parity's eigenvalues are phase factors, we assume an eigenstate of the parity operation (this is realized because the intrinsic parity is a property of a [[subatomic particle|particle]] species) and use the fact that two parity transformations leave the particle in the same state, thus the new wave function can differ by only a phase factor, i.e.: &lt;math&gt;P^{2} \psi = e^{i \phi} \psi&lt;/math&gt; thus &lt;math&gt;P \psi = \pm e^{i \phi /2} \psi&lt;/math&gt;, since these are the only eigenstates satisfying the above equation. 

The intrinsic parity's phase is conserved for non-[[Weak interaction|weak]] interactions (the product of the intrinsic parities is the same before and after the reaction). As &lt;math&gt;[P,H]=0&lt;/math&gt; the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] is invariant under a parity transformation. The intrinsic parity of a system is the product of the intrinsic parities of the particles, for instance for noninteracting particles we have &lt;math&gt;P(|1\rangle|2\rangle)=(P|1\rangle)(P|2\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;. Since the parity commutes with the Hamiltonian and &lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt} = 0&lt;/math&gt; its eigenvalue does not [[Heisenberg picture|change with time]], therefore the intrinsic parities phase is a conserved quantity.

A consequence of the [[Dirac equation]] is that the intrinsic parity of fermions and antifermions obey the relation &lt;math&gt;P_{\bar{f}}P_f = - 1&lt;/math&gt;, so particles and their antiparticles have the opposite parity. Single leptons can never be created or destroyed in experiments, as [[lepton number]] is a conserved quantity. This means experiments are unable to distinguish the sign of a leptons parity, so by convention it is chosen that leptons have intrinsic parity +1, antileptons have &lt;math&gt;P = -1&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly the parity of the quarks is chosen to be +1, and antiquarks is -1.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, B.R, Shaw, G. (2002). Particle Physics. Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legal observers''' are individuals, usually representatives of civilian [[human rights]] agencies, who attend [[Demonstration (people)|public demonstrations]], [[protest]]s and other activities where there is a potential for conflict between the public or activists and the [[police]], [[security guard]]s, or other law enforcement personnel. The purpose of legal observers is to monitor, record, and report on any unlawful or improper behaviour. Legal or human rights observers act as an independent third party within a conflictual civil protest context, observing police behaviour in order to keep police accountable for their actions. Legal observers can write [[incident report]]s describing police violence and misbehaviour and compile reports after the event. The use of video and still cameras, incident reports and audio recorders is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.activistrights.org.au/cb_pages/organising_legal_support.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004022928/http://www.activistrights.org.au/cb_pages/organising_legal_support.php |archivedate=2009-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that the concept of using legal observers first emerged during protests in the 1930s in the [[East End of London]], where police [[agents provocateur]] were used during protests by the [[British Union of Fascists]] (BUF).{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} There were large counter-protests and it was alleged that the police sided with the BUF. Another case of legal observing was that carried out by the [[Black Panthers]] in the United States.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Legal observers were used by [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]] (then known as the National Council for Civil Liberties) in [[Wapping]], [[London]], during the mid-1980s. The Wapping demonstration was in response to large protests by labour unions against the industrial relations policies of media magnate [[Rupert Murdoch]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In the United States, the [[National Lawyers Guild]] (NLG) holds registered trademarks for the words "legal observer"&lt;ref&gt;https://trademarks.justia.com/778/13/legal-observer-77813382.html&lt;/ref&gt; alone, as well as the words "legal observer" on a green background. The National Lawyers Guild Legal Observer certification program was established in 1968 in New York City in response to protests at Columbia University and citywide antiwar and civil rights demonstrations. That same year, guild students organized for the defense of people swept up in mass arrests at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The NLG Legal Observer certification program requires legal observers to take a training course and is part of a comprehensive system of legal support designed to enable people to express their political views as fully as possible without unconstitutional disruption or interference by the police and with the fewest possible consequences from the criminal justice system. Legal observers are trained and directed by National Lawyer Guild attorneys. The presence of legal observers may serve as a deterrent to unconstitutional behavior by law enforcement during a demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nlg.org/lo-trainings/&lt;/ref&gt; 

NLG worked with the [[Bureau des Avocats Internationaux]], the [[Institute for Justice &amp; Democracy in Haiti]], and the [[International Association of Democratic Lawyers]] to debut legal observers in Haiti during [[May Day]] protests of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlg.org/haitian-legal-organization-debuts-countrys-first-legal-observers-at-may-day-protests/ Haitian Legal Organization &amp; NLG Debut Country’s First Legal Observers at May Day Protests]&lt;/ref&gt;

In other countries, legal observers are associated with such groups as [[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]] (UK), [[Green and Black Cross]] (UK), the [[G8 Legal Collective]] (Scotland), and others. In Australia in the 1970s, priests acted as legal observers during the large [[Moratorium Marches]] against the Vietnam War. In September 2000, Pt'chang Nonviolent Community Safety Group organised a large legal observer team for the [[S11 (protest)|S11 protest]] against the World Economic Forum in Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;http://home.vicnet.net.au/~ptchang/downloads/s11_legal_observer_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In Sydney, the Legal Observers Project, formally based at the Community Law Centre at the [[University of Technology]], Sydney, and renamed Human Rights Monitors, was established in April 2001. This group reformed as Sydney Copwatch in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://home.vicnet.net.au/~ptchang/downloads/s11_legal_observer_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights organizations such as [[Amnesty International]] sometimes dispatch human rights observers who serve similar roles to legal observers.

'''Literacy''' is traditionally defined as the ability to [[reading (process)|read]] and [[writing|write]].&lt;ref&gt;"Literate." Merriam-Webster.com. Merriam-Webster, n.d. Web. 19 August 2014. &lt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/literate&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern world, this is one way of interpreting literacy. A more broad interpretation is literacy as knowledge and competence in a specific area.&lt;ref&gt;"Sitwe Benson Mkandwire." Literacy versus Language: Exploring their Similarities and Differences, 2018. The University of Zambia. ISSN: 2517-9306 &lt;http://dspace.unza.zm:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/5305/Literacy%20Versus%20Language%20Sitwe%20Article.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of literacy has evolved in meaning. The [[Modern history|modern]] term's meaning has been expanded to include the ability to use language, numbers, images, computers, and other basic means to understand, communicate, gain useful knowledge, solve mathematical problems and use the dominant symbol systems of a culture.&lt;ref name="Ed for All, UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=UNESCO|title=Education for All: A Global Monitoring Report|url=http://www.unesco.org/education/GMR2006/full/chapt6_eng.pdf|website=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of literacy is expanding across [[OECD]] countries to include skills to access knowledge through technology and ability to assess complex contexts.&lt;ref name="Ed for All, UNESCO"/&gt; A person who travels and resides in a foreign country but is unable to read or write in the language of the host country would also be regarded by the locals as illiterate.

The key to literacy is [[reading (process)|reading]] development, a progression of skills that begins with the ability to understand spoken words and decode written words, and culminates in the deep understanding of text. Reading development involves a range of complex language underpinnings including awareness of speech sounds ([[phonology]]), spelling patterns ([[orthography]]), word meaning ([[semantics]]), grammar ([[syntax]]) and patterns of word formation ([[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]), all of which provide a necessary platform for reading [[fluency]] and comprehension.

Once these skills are acquired, the reader can attain full language literacy, which includes the abilities to apply to printed material critical analysis, inference and synthesis; to write with accuracy and coherence; and to use information and insights from text as the basis for informed decisions and creative thought.&lt;ref&gt;Margie Gillis, Ed.D., President, Literacy How, Inc., and Research Affiliate, Haskins Laboratories at Yale University; Sally Grimes, Ed.M., Executive Director, Literate Nation and Founder, Grimes Reading Institute; Cinthia Haan, Author and Chair, The Haan Foundation for Children and President, Power4Kids Reading Initiative; Peggy McCardle, Ph.D., M.P.H., Chief, Child Development and Behavior Branch, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; Louisa Moats, Ed.D., President, Moats Associates Consulting, Inc.; Anthony Pedriana, Author and retired urban schoolteacher and principal; Susan Smartt, Ph.D., Senior Research Associate, National Comprehensive Center for Teacher Quality, Vanderbilt University; Catherine Snow,  Ph.D., Author, Researcher and Professor of Education,  Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard University; Cheryl Ward, M.S.M., C.A.L.P., Co-founder of Wisconsin Reading Coalition and academic language practitioner; Maryanne Wolf, Ed.D., Author and Director, Center for Reading and Language Research, Tufts University.&lt;/ref&gt;  The inability to do so is called illiteracy or analphabetism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/analphabetism|title=analphabetism {{!}} Definition of analphabetism in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) defines literacy as the "ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate and compute, using printed and written materials associated with varying contexts. Literacy involves a continuum of learning in enabling individuals to achieve their goals, to develop their knowledge and potential, and to participate fully in their community and wider society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001362/136246e.pdf|title=The Plurality of Literacy and its implications for Policies and Programs|journal=UNESCO Education Sector Position Paper|year=2004|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prehistoric literacy===

====Origins of literacy====
Literacy is  emerged with the development of [[numeracy]]  and computational devices as early as 8,000 BCE. Script developed independently at least five times in human history [[Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]], the [[Indus civilization]], lowland [[Mesoamerica]], and [[China]].&lt;ref name=camb&gt;Chrisomalis, Stephen (2009), "The Origins and Coevolution of Literacy and Numeracy", in Olsen, D. &amp; Torrance, N. (Eds.), ''The Cambridge Handbook of Literacy'' (pp. 59-74). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Writing Systems |url=http://hkotek.com/teaching/intro2015/week5-writing-systems.pdf |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bill of sale Louvre AO3765.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Bill of sale of a male slave and a building in Shuruppak, [[Sumer]]ian tablet, circa 2600 BC]]
The earliest forms of [[Writing|written communication]] originated in [[Serbia]] ([[Vinča culture]]), followed by [[Sumer]], located in southern Mesopotamia about 3500-3000 BCE. During this era, literacy was "a largely functional matter, propelled by the need to manage the new quantities of information and the new type of governance created by trade and large scale production".&lt;ref&gt;Easton, P. (in press). "History and spread of literacy", Excerpted from ''Sustaining Literacy in Africa: Developing a Literate Environment'', Paris: UNESCO Press pp. 46-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing systems in Mesopotamia first emerged from a recording system in which people used impressed token markings to manage trade and agricultural production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmandt-Besserat | first1 = D | year = 1978 | title = The earliest precursor of writing | url = | journal = [[Scientific American]] | volume = 238 | issue = 6| pages = 38–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The token system served as a precursor to early [[cuneiform]] writing once people began recording information on clay tablets. [[Cuneiform script|Proto-cuneiform]] texts exhibit not only numerical signs, but also [[ideograms]] depicting objects being counted.&lt;ref name=camb/&gt;

[[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] emerged from 3300-3100 BCE and depicted royal iconography that emphasized power amongst other elites. The Egyptian hieroglyphic writing system was the first notation system to have [[phonetic]] values.

Writing in lowland Mesoamerica was first put into practice by the [[Olmec]] and [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] civilizations in 900-400 BCE. These civilizations used [[glyph]]ic writing and bar-and-dot numerical notation systems for purposes related to royal iconography and calendar systems.

The earliest written notations in China date back to the [[Shang Dynasty]] in 1200 BCE. These systematic notations were found inscribed on bones and recorded sacrifices made, tributes received, and animals hunted, which were activities of the elite. These oracle-bone inscriptions were the early ancestors of modern Chinese script and contained [[logosyllabic]] script and numerals.

[[Indus script]] is largely pictorial and has not been deciphered yet. It may or may not include abstract signs. It is thought that they wrote from right to left and that the script is thought to be [[logographic]]. Because it has not been deciphered, linguists disagree on whether it is a complete and independent writing system; however, it is genuinely thought to be an independent writing system that emerged in the [[Harappa]] culture.

These examples indicate that early acts of literacy were closely tied to power and chiefly used for management practices, and probably less than 1% of the population was literate, as it was confined to a very small ruling elite.

====Origins of the alphabet====
According to [[social anthropologist]] [[Jack Goody]], there are two interpretations that regard the origin of the alphabet. Many classical scholars, such as historian [[Ignace Gelb]], credit the Ancient Greeks for creating the first alphabetic system (c. 750 BCE) that used distinctive signs for consonants and vowels. But Goody contests, "The importance of Greek culture of the subsequent history of Western Europe has led to an over-emphasis, by [[Classics|classicists]] and others, on the addition of specific [[vowel]] signs to the set of [[consonant]]al ones that had been developed earlier in Western Asia".&lt;ref&gt;Goody, Jack (1987). ''The Interface Between The Written and the Oral''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, p. 40-41. {{ISBN|0-521-33268-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, many scholars argue that the [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]] of northern [[Canaan]] (modern-day [[Syria]]) invented the [[Abjad|consonantal alphabet]] as early as 1500 BCE. Much of this theory's development is credited to English archeologist [[Flinders Petrie]], who, in 1905, came across a series of Canaanite inscriptions located in the turquoise mines of [[Serabit el-Khadem]]. Ten years later, English Egyptologist [[Alan Gardiner]] reasoned that these letters contain an alphabet, as well as references to the Canaanite goddess [[Asherah]]. In 1948, [[William F. Albright]] deciphered the text using additional evidence that had been discovered subsequent to Goody's findings. This included a series of inscriptions from [[Ugarit]], discovered in 1929 by French archaeologist [[Claude F. A. Schaeffer]]. Some of these inscriptions were mythological texts (written in an early Canaanite dialect) that consisted of a 32-letter [[cuneiform]] consonantal alphabet.

Another significant discovery was made in 1953 when three arrowheads were uncovered, each containing identical Canaanite inscriptions from twelfth century BCE. According to [[Frank Moore Cross]], these inscriptions consisted of alphabetic signs that originated during the transitional development from pictographic script to a linear alphabet. Moreover, he asserts, "These inscriptions also provided clues to extend the decipherment of earlier and later alphabetic texts".&lt;ref name="Cross, Frank Moore 1980 p. 1-20"&gt;Cross, Frank Moore, "Newly Found Inscriptions in Old Canaanite and Early Phoenician Scripts", ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'', No. 238 (Spring, 1980) p. 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The consonantal system of the Canaanite script inspired alphabetical developments in subsequent systems. During the Late [[Bronze Age]], successor alphabets appeared throughout the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] region and were employed for [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]], [[Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]].

According to Goody, these cuneiform scripts may have influenced the development of the Greek alphabet several centuries later. Historically, the Greeks contended that their writing system was modeled after the Phoenicians. However, many Semitic scholars now believe that [[Ancient Greek]] is more consistent with an early form Canaanite that was used c. 1100 BCE. While the earliest Greek inscriptions are dated c. eighth century BCE, [[Epigraphy|epigraphical]] comparisons to [[Proto-Canaanite]] suggest that the Greeks may have adopted the consonantal alphabet as early as 1100 BCE, and later "added in five characters to represent vowels".&lt;ref name="Goody, Jack 1987 p. 40-49"&gt;Goody, Jack (1987). ''The Interface Between The Written and the Oral''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, p. 40-49. {{ISBN|0-521-33268-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phoenician, which is considered to contain the first [[list of writing systems|"linear alphabet"]], rapidly spread to the Mediterranean port cities in northern [[Canaan]].&lt;ref name="Cross, Frank Moore 1980 p. 1-20"/&gt; Some archeologists believe that Phoenician scripture had some influence on the developments of the Hebrew and Aramaic alphabets based on the fact that these languages evolved during the same time period, share similar features, and are commonly categorized into the same language group.&lt;ref&gt;McCarter, P. Kyle. "The Early Diffusion of the Alphabet", ''The Biblical Archaeologist'' 37, No. 3 (Sep. 1974): 59-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Israelites migrated to Canaan between 1200 and 1001 BCE, they also adopted a variation of the Canaanite alphabet. [[Baruch ben Neriah]], Jeremiah's scribe, used this alphabet to create the later scripts of the [[Old Testament]]. The Early Hebrew alphabet was prominent in the Mediterranean region until [[Neo-Babylonian|Chaldean Babylonian]] rulers exiled the Jews to [[Babylon]] in the sixth century BCE. It was then that the new script ("Square Hebrew") emerged and the older one rapidly died out.&lt;ref name="Goody, Jack 1987 p. 40-49"/&gt;

The [[Aramaic alphabet]] also emerged sometime between 1200 and 1001 BCE. As the [[Bronze Age collapse]]d, the [[Aramaeans]] moved into Canaan and Phoenician territories and adopted their scripts. Although early evidence of this writing is scarce, archeologists have uncovered a wide range of later Aramaic texts, written as early as the seventh century BCE. Due to its longevity and prevalence in the region, Achaemenid rulers would come to adopt it as a "diplomatic language".&lt;ref&gt;Goody, Jack (1987). ''The Interface Between The Written and the Oral''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, p. 50. {{ISBN|0-521-33268-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern Aramaic alphabet rapidly spread east to the Kingdom of Nabataea, then to [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]], eventually making its way to [[Africa]]. Aramaic merchants carried older variations of the language as far as [[India]], where it later influenced the development of [[Brahmi]] scripture. It also led to the developments of [[Arabic]], [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] (an Iranian adaptation), "as well as for a range of alphabets used by early Turkish and Mongol tribes in [[Siberia]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Turkestan]]".&lt;ref&gt;Goody, Jack (1987). ''The Interface Between The Written and the Oral''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, p. 49-51. {{ISBN|0-521-33268-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Literacy at this period spread with the merchant classes and may have grown to number 15-20% of the total population.

The Aramaic language would die out with the spread of [[Islam]] and with it, its influence of Arabic.

===Ancient and post-classical literacy===
{{Further information|Latin alphabet}}
Until recently it was thought that the majority of people were illiterate in ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: {{Cite book |title=Ancient literacy |last=Harris |first=William V. |date=1991 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674033818 |edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk. |location=Cambridge, MA |oclc=436359723}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, recent work challenges this perception.&lt;ref&gt;See Brian J. Wright, "Ancient Literacy in New Testament Research: Incorporating a Few More Lines of Enquiry," TrinJ 36 (2015): 161-189. https://www.academia.edu/13211795/_Ancient_Literacy_in_New_Testament_Research_Incorporating_a_Few_More_Lines_of_Enquiry_TrinJ_36_2015_161-189&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony DiRenzo asserts that [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman society]] was "a civilization based on the book and the register", and "no one, either free or slave, could afford to be illiterate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Di Renzo | first1 = Anthony | year = 2000 | title = His master's voice: Tiro and the rise of the roman secretarial class | url = http://faculty.ithaca.edu/direnzo/docs/scholarship/mastersvoice.pdf| journal = Journal of Technical Writing and Communication | volume = 30 | issue = 2| pages = 155–168 | doi=10.2190/b4yd-5fp7-1w8d-v3uc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly Dupont points out, "The written word was all around them, in both public and private life: laws, calendars, regulations at shrines, and funeral epitaphs were engraved in stone or bronze. The Republic amassed huge archives of reports on every aspect of public life".&lt;ref&gt;Dupont, Florence. (1989) ''Daily Life in Ancient Rome'' Tr. Christopher Woodall. Oxford: Blackwell; p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; The imperial civilian administration produced masses of documentation used in judicial, fiscal and administrative matters as did the municipalities. The army kept extensive records relating to supply and duty rosters and submitted reports. Merchants, shippers, and landowners (and their personal staffs) especially of the larger enterprises must have been literate.    

In the late fourth century the [[Desert Father]] [[Pachomius]] would expect literacy of a candidate for admission to his monasteries:
&lt;blockquote&gt;they shall give him twenty Psalms or two of the Apostles' epistles or some other part of Scripture. And if he is illiterate he shall go at the first, third and sixth hours to someone who can teach and has been appointed for him. He shall stand before him and learn very studiously and with all gratitude. The fundamentals of a syllable, the verbs and nouns shall all be written for him and even if he does not want to he shall be compelled to read.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pachomius]], Rule 139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the course of the 4th and 5th century the Churches made efforts to ensure a better clergy in particular among the bishops who were expected to have a classical education, which was the hallmark of an socially acceptable person in higher society (and possession of which allayed the fears of the pagan elite that their cultural inheritance would be destroyed). Even after the remnants of the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell in the 470s literacy continued to be a distinguishing mark of the elite as communications skills were still important in political and Church life (bishops were largely drawn from the senatorial class) in a new cultural synthesis that made "Christianity the Roman religion," &lt;ref&gt;Jas Elsner, Imperial Rome and Christian Triumph, 1998, p. 141, {{ISBN|0-19-284201-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, these skills were less in needed than previously in the absence of the large imperial administrative apparatus whose middle and top echelons the elite had dominated as if by right. Even so, in pre-modern times it is unlikely that literacy was found in more than about 30-40% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;This connection is pursued in [[Alan K. Bowman]] and [[Greg Woolf]], eds., ''Literacy and Power in the Ancient World'', (Cambridge) 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest percentage of literacy during the Dark Ages was among the clergy and monks who supplied much of the staff needed to administer the states of western Europe. 

Post-Antiquity illiteracy was made much worse due to a lack of suitable writing medium. When the Western Roman Empire collapsed, the import of [[papyrus]] to Europe ceased. Since papyrus perishes easily and does not last well in the wetter or damper European climate, the alternative was [[parchment]] which was expensive and accessible only by the Church and upper layers of the society. Once [[paper]] was introduced into Europe in the 11th century in Spain. Its use spread north slowly over the next four centuries. Increased literacy saw a resurgence because of its use. By the 15th century paper had largely replaced parchment except for many luxury manuscripts (some of which used paper). 

The [[Reformation]] stressed the importance of literacy and being able to read the Bible. The Protestant countries were the first to attain full literacy; [[Scandinavia]]n countries were fully literate in the early 17th century. The Church{{which|date=October 2018}} demanded literacy as the pre-requisite for [[marriage]] in [[Sweden]]{{when|date=October 2018}}, this further propagating full literacy.

==Modern literacy==

=== Spread of literacy since the mid-twentieth century ===
[[File:Figure 1 Adult literacy rates have increased Reading the past writing the futureUPDATED.svg|thumb|Adult literacy rates have increased at a constant pace since 1950.]]
Literacy data published by [[UNESCO]] displays that since 1950, the adult literacy rate at the world level has increased by 5 percentage points every decade on average, from 55.7 per cent in 1950 to 86.2 per cent in 2015. However, for four decades, the population growth was so rapid that the number of illiterate adults kept increasing, rising from 700 million in 1950 to 878 million in 1990. Since then, the number has fallen markedly to 745 million in 2015, although it remains higher than in 1950 despite decades of universal education policies, literacy interventions and the spread of print material and information and communications technology (ICT). However, these trends have been far from uniform across regions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Regional disparities ===
Available global data indicates significant variations in literacy rates between world regions. [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[West Asia]], and [[Central Asia]] have achieved almost full adult literacy (individuals at or over the age of 15) for both men and women. Most countries in [[East Asia and the Pacific]], as well as [[Latin America and the Caribbean]], are above a 90% literacy rate for adults.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=UNESCO Institute for Statistics|date=September 2015|title=Adult and Youth Literacy|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/literacy/Documents/fs32-2015-literacy.pdf|journal=UIS Fact Sheet|volume=No. 32|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illiteracy persists to a greater extent in other regions: 2013 [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]] (UIS) data indicates adult literacy rates of only, 67.55% in [[South Asia]] and [[North Africa]], 59.76% in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/Index.aspx?queryid=166#)|title=Education : Literacy rate|last=UIS|website=data.uis.unesco.org|access-date=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Figure 5 Literacy has rapidly spread Reading the past writing the future.svg|left|thumb|Literacy has rapidly spread in several regions over the last twenty-five years.]]
In much of the world, high youth literacy rates suggest that illiteracy will become less and less common as younger generations with higher educational attainment levels replace older ones.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Daniel A., Fatima Tuz Zahra, and Jinsol Lee.

That being said, literacy has rapidly spread in several regions in the last twenty-five years (see image).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Gender disparities ===
[[File:Figure 4 Progress towards gender parity Reading the past writing the future.svg|thumb|Gender parity indices in youth literacy rates by region, 1990–2015. Progress towards gender parity in literacy started after 1990.]]
On a worldwide scale, illiteracy disproportionately impacts women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oyitso|first=Mabel|last2=Olomukoro|first2=C.

This disparity was even starker in previous decades: from 1970 to 2000, the global gender gap in literacy would decrease by roughly 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dorius|first=Shawn F.|last2=Firebaugh|first2=Glenn|date=1 July 2010|title=Trends in Global Gender Inequality|url=http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/88/5/1941|journal=Social Forces|language=en|volume=88|issue=5|pages=1941–1968|doi=10.1353/sof.2010.0040|issn=0037-7732|pmc=3107548|pmid=21643494}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, however, this progress has stagnated, with the remaining gender gap holding almost constant over the last two decades.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In general, the gender gap in literacy is not as pronounced as the regional gap; that is, differences between countries in overall literacy are often larger than gender differences within countries.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank. (2012). "[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDR2012/Resources/7778105-1299699968583/7786210-1315936222006/chapter-3.pdf Education and Health: Where do Gender Differences Really Matter]?" in Gender Equality and Development: World Development Report 2012. Washington, D.C: The World Bank: 114.
&lt;/ref&gt; However, the gap between men and women would narrow from 1990 onwards, after the increase of male adult literacy rates at 80 per cent (see image).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002475/247563e.pdf|title=Reading the past, writing the future: Fifty years of promoting literacy|last=UNESCO|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100214-4|location=|pages=21–23, 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the region with the lowest overall literacy rates, also features the widest gender gap: just 52% of adult females are literate, and 68% among adult men. Similar gender disparity persists in two other regions, [[North Africa]] (86% adult male literacy, 70% adult female literacy) and South Asia (77% adult male literacy, 58% adult female literacy).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 1990 World Conference on [[Education For All|Education for All]], held in Jomtien, Thailand, would bring attention to the literacy gender gap and prompt many developing countries to prioritize women's literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PWz6mAEACAAJ|title=Gender, Literacy, and Empowerment in Morocco|last=Agnaou|first=Fatima|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415947657|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past decade, global development agendas would increasingly address the issue of female literacy. For example, UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] would center his 2010 [[International Literacy Day]] speech around the theme "Empowering Women Through Literacy Empowers Us All," emphasizing the broad societal progress that higher female literacy rates could promote.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In many contexts, female illiteracy co-exists with other aspects of gender inequality. [[Martha Nussbaum]], for example, make illiterate women more vulnerable to becoming trapped in an abusive marriage, given that illiteracy limits their employment opportunities and worsens their [[intra-household bargaining]] position. Moreover, Nussbaum links literacy to the potential for women to effectively communicate and collaborate with one another in order "to participate in a larger movement for political change."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha C.|date=1 January 2004|title=Women's Education: A Global Challenge|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=29|issue=2|pages=332–333|doi=10.1086/378571|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Challenges of increasing female literacy ====

Social barriers prevent expanding literacy skills among women and girls. Making literacy classes available can be ineffective when it conflicts with the use of the valuable limited time of women and girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=M. Anne|last2=King|first2=Elizabeth|date=1 July 1995|title=Women's education and economic well-being|journal=Feminist Economics|volume=1|issue=2|pages=21–46|doi=10.1080/714042230|issn=1354-5701}}&lt;/ref&gt; School age girls, in many contexts, face stronger expectations than their male counterparts to perform household work and care after younger siblings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Generational dynamics can also perpetuate these disparities: illiterate parents may not readily appreciate the value of literacy for their daughters, particularly in traditional, rural societies with expectations that girls will remain at home.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Mekhlafy, Tawfiq A. (2008). "[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EDUCATION/Resources/278200-1099079877269/547664-1099080014368/DID_Girls_edu.pdf Strategies for Gender Equality in Basic and Secondary Education: A Comprehensive and Integrated Approach in the Republic of Yemen]." In ''Girls’ Education in the 21st Century: Gender Equality, Empowerment, and Economic Growth,'' ed. Mercy Tembon and Lucia Fort. Washington D.C.: The World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 [[World Bank]] and the [[International Center for Research on Women]] review of academic literature would conclude that [[child marriage]], which predominantly impacts girls, tends to reduce literacy levels.&lt;ref&gt;Wodon, Quentin, et al. "Child Marriage and the 2030 Agenda: Selected Findings from Early Research." (September 2015). ''The Economic Impacts of Child Marriage''. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.costsofchildmarriage.org/publication/child-marriage-and-2030-agenda&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 analysis of the issue in Bangladesh found that for every additional year of delay in a girl's marriage, her likelihood of literacy would increase by 5.6 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Field|first=Erica|last2=Ambrus|first2=Attila|date=1 October 2008|title=Early Marriage, Age of Menarche, and Female Schooling Attainment in Bangladesh|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=116|issue=5|pages=881–930|doi=10.1086/593333|issn=0022-3808|citeseerx=10.1.1.662.7231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a 2014 study found that in sub-Saharan Africa, marrying early would significantly decrease a girl's probability of literacy, holding other variables constant.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen, Minh Cong and Quentin Wodon.

Washington, DC: World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 review of the [[child marriage]] literature therefore would recommend marriage postponement as part of a strategy to increase educational attainment levels, including female literacy in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parsons|first=Jennifer|last2=Edmeades|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Kes|first3=Aslihan|last4=Petroni|first4=Suzanne|last5=Sexton|first5=Maggie|last6=Wodon|first6=Quentin|date=3 July 2015|title=Economic Impacts of Child Marriage: A Review of the Literature|journal=The Review of Faith &amp; International Affairs|volume=13|issue=3|pages=12–22|doi=10.1080/15570274.2015.1075757|issn=1557-0274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gender gap for boys in developed countries ====

While women and girls comprise the majority of the global illiterate population, in many developed countries a literacy gender gap exists in the opposite direction. Data from the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA) has consistently indicated the literacy underachievement of boys within member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Anne|last2=Kehler|first2=Michael|last3=Martino|first3=Wayne|date=1 February 2010|title=The Problem of Boys' Literacy Underachievement: Raising Some Questions|journal=Journal of Adolescent &amp; Adult Literacy|language=en|volume=53|issue=5|pages=356–361|doi=10.1598/JAAL.53.5.1|issn=1936-2706}}&lt;/ref&gt; In view of such findings, many education specialists have recommended changes in classroom practices to better accommodate boys' learning styles, and to remove any gender stereotypes that may create a perception of reading and writing as feminine activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Senn|first=Nicole|date=1 November 2012|title=Effective Approaches to Motivate and Engage Reluctant Boys in Literacy|journal=The Reading Teacher|language=en|volume=66|issue=3|pages=211–220|doi=10.1002/TRTR.01107|issn=1936-2714}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ZHAAAAACAAJ|title=Me Read?

===Socioeconomic impact===
Many policy analysts consider literacy rates as a crucial measure of the value of a region's [[human capital]]. For example, literate people can be more easily trained than illiterate people, and generally have a higher socioeconomic status;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thephonicspage.org/On%20Phonics/profitable.html|title = Phonics. It's Profitable|website=The Phonics Page |accessdate = 11 December 2007|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus they enjoy better health and employment prospects. The international community has come to consider literacy as a key facilitator and goal of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rao|first=Vasudeva|last2=S|first2=B.|last3=Gupta|first3=P.

=== Health impacts ===
Illiterate people are generally less knowledgeable about hygiene and nutritional practices, an unawareness which can exacerbate a wide range of health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Puchner|first=Laurel D.|date=1 July 1995|title=Literacy links: Issues in the relationship between early childhood development, health, women, families, and literacy|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/073805939400041M|journal=International Journal of Educational Development|volume=15|issue=3|pages=307–319|doi=10.1016/0738-0593(94)00041-M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within developing countries in particular, literacy rates also have implications for [[child mortality]]; in these contexts, children of literate mothers are 50% more likely to live past age 5 than children of illiterate mothers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldliteracyfoundation.org//wp-content/uploads/2015/02/WLF-FINAL-ECONOMIC-REPORT.pdf|title=The Economic and Social Cost of Illiteracy: A Snapshot of Illiteracy in a Global Context|date=24 August 2015|website=|publisher=World Literacy Foundation|access-date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public health research has thus increasingly concerned itself with the potential for literacy skills to allow women to more successfully access health care systems, and thereby facilitate gains in child health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LeVine|first=Robert A.|last2=Rowe|first2=Meredith L.|title=Maternal Literacy and Child Health in Less-Developed Countries: Evidence, Processes, and Limitations|url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00004703-200908000-00012|journal=Journal of Developmental &amp; Behavioral Pediatrics|volume=30|issue=4|pages=340–349|doi=10.1097/dbp.0b013e3181b0eeff|pmid=19672161|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a 2014 descriptive research survey project correlates literacy levels with the socioeconomic status of women in Oyo State, Nigeria. The study claims that developing literacy in this area will bring "economic empowerment and will encourage rural women to practice hygiene, which will in turn lead to the reduction of birth and death rates."&lt;ref&gt;OKOJI, O. F., &amp; LADEJI, O. O. (2014). Influence of Adult Literacy Education on Socio-Economic Empowerment of Rural Women in Oyo State, Nigeria. Gender &amp; Behaviour, 12(3), 6016-6026.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic impacts ===
Literacy can increase job opportunities and access to [[higher education]]. In 2009, the National Adult Literacy agency (NALA) in [[Ireland]] commissioned a cost benefit analysis of adult literacy training. This concluded that there were economic gains for the individuals, the companies they worked for, and the Exchequer, as well as the economy and the country as a whole—for example, increased [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nala.ie/sites/default/files/press_release_image-2010-March/files/Policy%20Brief%20on%20Adult%20Literacy%20Strategy%202009.pdf |title=nala.ie |format=PDF |accessdate=23 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723224750/http://www.nala.ie/sites/default/files/press_release_image-2010-March/files/Policy%20Brief%20on%20Adult%20Literacy%20Strategy%202009.pdf |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev]] and coauthors have revealed a rather significant correlation between the level of literacy in the early 19th century and successful modernization and economic breakthroughs in the late 20th century, as "literate people could be characterized by a greater innovative-activity level, which provides opportunities for modernization, development, and economic growth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Korotayev | first1 = Andrey | last2 = Zinkina | first2 = Julia | last3 = Bogevolnov | first3 = Justislav | last4 = Malkov | first4 = Artemy | title = Global Unconditional Convergence among Larger Economies after 1998? | url = http://www.sociostudies.org/journal/articles/140671/| journal = Journal of Globalization Studies | volume = 2 | issue = 2| year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literacy promotion efforts ===
While informal learning within the home can play an important role in literacy development, gains in childhood literacy often occur in primary school settings. Continuing the global expansion of public education is thus a frequent focus of literacy advocates.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Daniel A., Fatima Tuz Zahra, and Jinsol Lee. (2016).

&lt;/ref&gt; These kinds of broad improvements in education often require centralized efforts undertaken by national governments; alternatively, local literacy projects implemented by NGOs can play an important role, particularly in rural contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beckman|first=Paula J.|last2=Gallo|first2=Jessica|date=October 2015|title=Rural Education in a Global Context|url=http://ger.mercy.edu/index.php/ger/article/view/238|journal=Global Education Review|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|page=7|issn=2325-663X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for both youth and adult literacy programs often comes from large international development organizations. [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], for example, steered donors like the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] and the [[Global Partnership for Education]] toward the issue of childhood literacy by developing the [https://www.eddataglobal.org/reading/ Early Grade Reading Assessment].&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, Lesley and Julia Frazier (2015). "Literacy and Development." In ''Routledge Handbook of International Education and Development''. Edited by Simon McGrath and Qing Gu. {{ISBN|1317752236}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Advocacy groups like the [[NIACE|National Institute of Adult Continuing Education]] have frequently called upon international organizations such as UNESCO, the [[International Labour Organization]], the [[World Health Organization]], and the [[World Bank]] to prioritize support for adult women's literacy.&lt;ref&gt;National Institute of Adult Continuing Education (2012). ''[http://www.learningandwork.org.uk/sites/niace_en/files/document-downloads/womensrighttoliteracy_web.pdf Women's Right to Literacy: Advocating Women's Right to Access Learning Literacy through International Development].'' Leicester: NIACE.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to increase adult literacy often encompass other development priorities as well; for example, initiatives in [[Ethiopia]], [[Morocco]], and [[India]] have combined adult literacy programs with vocational skills trainings in order to encourage enrollment and address the complex needs of women and other marginalized groups who lack economic opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning (2013).

In 2013, the [[UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning]] published a set of case studies&lt;ref&gt;{{URL|http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002225/222588e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; on programs that successfully improved female literacy rates. The report features countries from a variety of regions and of differing income levels, reflecting the general global consensus on "the need to empower women through the acquisition of literacy skills."&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning (2013). "[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002225/222588e.pdf Literacy Programmes with a Focus on Women to Reduce Gender Disparities]." Hamburg: UIL. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the impetus for UNESCO's focus on literacy is a broader effort to respond to globalization and "the shift towards knowledge-based societies" that it has produced.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2006).

In ''Education for All Global Monitoring Report''. p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; While globalization presents emerging challenges, it also provides new opportunities: many education and development specialists are hopeful that new information and communications technologies (ICTs) will have the potential to expand literacy learning opportunities for children and adults, even those in countries that have historically struggled to improve literacy rates through more conventional means.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Daniel A., Fatima Tuz Zahra, and Jinsol Lee.

=== Literacy as a development indicator ===
The [[Human Development Index]], produced by the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), uses education as one of its three indicators; originally, adult literacy represented two-thirds of this education index weight. In 2010, however, the UNDP replaced the adult literacy measure with mean years of schooling. A 2011 UNDP research paper framed this change as a way to "ensure current relevance," arguing that gains in global literacy already achieved between 1970 and 2010 meant that literacy would be "unlikely to be as informative of the future."&lt;ref&gt;Klugman, Jeni, Francisco Rodriguez, and Hyung-Jin Choi. (April 2011). "[http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdrp_2011_01.pdf The HDI 2010: New Controversies, Old Critiques]." ''United Nations Development Programme''. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, however, have since warned against overlooking the importance of literacy as an indicator and a goal for development, particularly for marginalized groups such as women and rural populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stromquist|first=Nelly|title=Adult Literacy and Women: A Present Account|url=http://journals.uncc.edu/index.php/DSJ/article/view/506|journal=Dialogues in Social Justice: An Adult Education Journal|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[public library]] has long been a force promoting literacy in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Public Librarianship |author=McCook, Kathleen de la Peña |year=2011 |location=New York |publisher=Neal-Schuman |pages=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. context, the [[American Library Association]] promotes literacy through the work of the Office for Literacy and Outreach Services.  This committee's charge includes ensuring equitable access to information and advocating for adult new and non-readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ala.org/offices/olos |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326132006/http://www.ala.org/offices/olos |archivedate=26 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Public Library Association]] recognizes the importance of early childhood in the role of literacy development and created, in collaboration with the [[Association for Library Service to Children]],  Every Child Ready to Read @your library in order to inform and support parents and caregivers in their efforts to raise children who become literate adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everychildreadytoread.org/about|title=About – Every Child Ready to Read|website=www.everychildreadytoread.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of the National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) report in 2005 revealed that approximately 14% of U.S. adults function at the lowest level of literacy; 29% of adults function at the basic functional literacy level and cannot help their children with homework beyond the first few grades.&lt;ref&gt;Weibel, M.C. (2007). ''Adult Learners Welcome Here: A Handbook for Librarians and Literacy Teachers''. Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc., New York. {{ISBN|1-55570-578-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of reading skills hinders adults from reaching their full potential. They might have difficulty getting and maintaining a job, providing for their families, or even reading a story to their children. For adults, the library might be the only source of a literacy program.&lt;ref name="Selnick, S."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Selnick | first1 = S | year = 2004 | title = ["READ/Orange County: Changing lives through literacy"] | url = | journal = [[Public Libraries (journal)|Public Libraries]] | volume = 43 | issue = 1| pages = 53–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===30 April: Dia! Diversity in Action===

Dia! Which stand for Diversity in Action and is also known as "El Dia de los Ninos/El dia de los libros (Children's Day/Book Day)" is a program which celebrates the importance of reading to children from all cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Dia! is celebrated every year on 30 April in schools, libraries, and homes and this website provides tools and programs to encourage reading in children. Parents, caregivers, and educators can even start a book club.&lt;ref&gt;Mora, P. (1 January 2013). Dia! Diversity in Action Dia de los ninos, dia de los libros | Dia!

===READ/Orange County===

This community literacy program was initiated in 1992 by the [[Orange County Public Libraries|Orange County Public Library]] in [[California]].  The mission of READ/Orange County is to "create a more literate community by providing diversified services of the highest quality to all who seek them." Potential tutors train during an extensive 23-hour tutor training workshop in which they learn the philosophy, techniques and tools they will need to work with adult learns.&lt;ref name="Selnick, S." /&gt; After the training, the tutors invest at least 50 hours a year to tutoring their student.The organization builds on people's experience as well as education rather than trying to make up for what has not been learned. The program seeks to equip students with skills to continue learning in the future.&lt;ref name="Selnick, S." /&gt; The guiding philosophy is that an adult who learns to read creates a [[ripple effect]] in the community.  The person becomes an example to children and grandchildren and can better serve the community.

===BoulderReads!===

Located in [[Boulder, Colorado]], the program recognized the difficulty that students had in obtaining child care while attending tutoring sessions, and joined with the University of Colorado to provide reading buddies to the children of students. Reading Buddies matches children of adult literacy students with college students who meet with them once a week throughout the semester for an hour and a half. The college students receive course credit to try to enhance the quality and reliability of their time.&lt;ref name="Sherry, D."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sherry | first1 = D | year = 2004 | title = ["Providing reading buddies for the children of adult literacy students: One way to provide onsite child care while also addressing intergenerational illiteracy"] | url = | journal = Colorado Libraries | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 40–42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each Reading Buddies session focuses primarily on the [[college student]] reading aloud with the child. The goal is to help the child gain interest in books and feel comfortable reading aloud. Time is also spent on word games, writing letters, or searching for books in the library. Throughout the semester the pair work on writing and illustrating a book together. The college student's grade is partly dependent on the completion of the book. Although Reading Buddies began primarily as an answer to the lack of child care for literacy students, it has evolved into another aspect of the program.&lt;ref name="Sherry, D." /&gt; Participating children show marked improvement in their reading and writing skills throughout the semester.

===Hillsborough Literacy Council (HLC)===

Approximately 120,000 adults in Hillsborough County are illiterate or read below the fourth-grade level. Working since 1986, the HLC is "committed to improving literacy by empowering adults through education".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hillsboroughliteracy.org Hillsborough Literacy Council], 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Sponsored by the statewide Florida Literacy Coalition, HLC strives to improve the literacy ability of adults in [[Hillsborough County, Florida]]. The HLC provides tutoring for [[English as a second or foreign language|English for speakers of other languages]] (ESOL). Through one-on-one tutoring, the organization works to help adult students reach at least the fifth-grade level.

==Broader and complementary definitions==
Traditionally, literacy is the ability to use written language actively and passively; one definition of literacy is the ability to "read, write, spell, listen, and speak".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Moats, Louisa |title=Speech to print: language essentials for teachers |publisher=Paul H. Brookes Pub |location=Baltimore, MD |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=978-1-55766-387-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s, some have argued that literacy is ideological, which means that literacy always exists in a context, in tandem with the values associated with that context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Goody, Jack |title=The logic of writing and the organization of society |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1986 |pages= |isbn=978-0-521-33962-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9Kn8dVDrF50C |title=The Logic of Writing and the Organization of Society |author=Jack Goody |work=Overview |isbn=978-0-521-33962-9 |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior work viewed literacy as existing autonomously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Brian V. Street|title=Literacy in theory and practice|url=https://books.google.com/?id=R0UdWQ5thf8C|year=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-28961-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Brian V.

Some have argued that the definition of literacy should be expanded. For example, in the [[United States]], the [[National Council of Teachers of English]] and the [[International Reading Association]] have added "visually representing"{{clarify|date=July 2012}} to the traditional list of competencies. Similarly, in [[Scotland]], literacy has been defined as: "The ability to read, write and use numeracy, to handle information, to express ideas and opinions, to make decisions and solve problems, as family members, workers, citizens and lifelong learners".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/158952/0043191.pdf Adult Literacy and Numeracy in Scotland]" (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  It is argued that literacy includes the cultural, political, and historical contexts of the community in which communication takes place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michele Knobel]] (1999). ''Everyday Literacies: Students, Discourse, and Social Practice'', New York: Lang&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gee, J.&amp;nbsp;P. (1996). ''Social Linguistics and Literacies: Ideologies in Discourses'' Philadelphia: Falmer.&lt;/ref&gt;

A basic literacy standard in many places is the ability to read the newspaper. Increasingly, communication in commerce and in general requires the ability to use computers and other digital technologies. Since the 1990s, when the [[Internet]] came into wide use in the United States, some have asserted that the definition of literacy should include the ability to use tools such as [[web browser]]s, [[word processing]] programs, and [[text message]]s. Similar expanded skill sets have been called [[multimedia literacy]], [[computer literacy]], [[information literacy]], and [[technological literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Kress, Gunther R. |title=Literacy in the new media age |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=978-0-415-25356-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/cconline/reviews/charlton/Kress.htm |title=Literacy in the New Media Age |website= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars propose the idea multiliteracies which includes Functional Literacy, [[Critical literacy|Critical Literacy]], and Rhetorical Literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Stuart Selber |title=Multiliteracies for a Digital Age |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |location=Carbondale |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=978-0-8093-2551-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Arts literacy" programs exist in some places in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=McKenna, Michael C. |author2=Richards, Janet C. |title=Integrating multiple literacies in K-8 classrooms: cases, commentaries, and practical applications |publisher=L.&amp;nbsp;Erlbaum Associates |location=Hillsdale, NJ |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=978-0-8058-3945-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Visual literacy]] also includes the ability to understand visual forms of communication such as [[body language]], pictures, maps, and video.&lt;ref&gt;An inability to "read" body language is one of the features of [[autism]].&lt;/ref&gt; Evolving definitions of literacy often include all the symbol systems relevant to a particular community.

Other genres under study by academia include [[critical literacy]], [[media literacy]], [[ecological literacy]] and [[health literacy]]&lt;ref&gt;Zarcadoolas, C., Pleasant, A., &amp; Greer, D. (2006). ''Advancing health literacy: A framework for understanding and action''. Jossey-Bass: San Francisco, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; With the increasing emphasis on evidence-based decision making, and the use of statistical graphics and information, [[statistical literacy]] is becoming a very important aspect of literacy in general. The International Statistical Literacy Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~iase/islp/|title=ISLP — Home|website=www.stat.auckland.ac.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; is dedicated to the promotion of statistical literacy among all members of society.

Given that a large part of the benefits of literacy can be obtained by having access to a literate person in the household, some recent literature in economics, starting with the work of Kaushik Basu and James Foster, distinguishes between a "proximate illiterate" and an "isolated illiterate". The former refers to an illiterate person who lives in a household with literates and the latter to an illiterate who lives in a household of all illiterates. What is of concern is that many people in poor nations are not just illiterates but isolated illiterates.

==Teaching literacy==
{{main article|Learning to read}}
{{globalize|section|date=April 2011}}
Teaching English literacy in the [[United States]] is dominated by a focus on a set of discrete decoding skills. From this perspective, literacy—or, rather, reading—comprises a number of subskills that can be taught to students. These skill sets include [[phonological awareness]], [[phonics|phonics (decoding)]], [[fluency]], [[Reading comprehension|comprehension]], and [[vocabulary]]. Mastering each of these subskills is necessary for students to become proficient readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author = National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|title = Report of the National Reading Panel: Teaching Children to Read: An Evidence-Based Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading and its Implications for Reading Instruction: Reports of the Subgroups|publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office|year = 2000|ref = harv|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this same perspective, readers of [[alphabetic language]]s must understand the [[alphabetic principle]] to master basic reading skills. For this purpose a writing system is "alphabetic" if it uses symbols to represent [[phoneme|individual language sounds]],&lt;ref name="sedl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sedl.org/reading/framework/glossary.html |title=Glossary of Reading Terms - The Cognitive Foundations of Learning to Read: A Framework |publisher=Sedl.org |date=23 April 2008 |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the degree of correspondence between letters and sounds varies between alphabetic languages. [[Syllabary|Syllabic writing systems]] (such as [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] [[kana]]) use a symbol to represent a single syllable, and [[logogram|logographic writing systems]] (such as [[Written Chinese|Chinese]]) use a symbol to represent a [[morpheme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Halsall |url=http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/chinlng4.html |title=Chinese Cultural Studies: Chinese Logographic Writing |publisher=Acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are any number of approaches to teaching literacy&lt;ref&gt;Carter, V. Elaine. (November 2000). [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001257/125767eb.pdf “New approaches to literacy learning: A guide for teacher educators.”] UNESCO. www.un.org/ga/president/62/ThematicDebates/adn/crimeimpedimentsd.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;; each is shaped by its informing assumptions about what literacy is and how it is best learned by students. [[Phonics]] instruction, for example, focuses on reading at the level of the word. It teaches readers to observe and interpret the letters or groups of letters that make up words. A common method of teaching phonics is [[synthetic phonics]], in which a novice reader pronounces each individual sound and "blends" them to pronounce the whole word. Another approach is embedded phonics instruction, used more often in [[whole language]] reading instruction, in which novice readers learn about the individual letters in words on a just-in-time, just-in-place basis that is tailored to meet each student's reading and writing learning needs.&lt;ref name="sedl" /&gt; That is, teachers provide phonics instruction opportunistically, within the context of stories or student writing that feature many instances of a particular letter or group of letters. Embedded instruction combines letter-sound knowledge with the use of meaningful context to read new and difficult words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldonline.org/glossary#E |title=Glossary |publisher=LD OnLine |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques such as [[directed listening and thinking activity|directed listening and thinking activities]] can be used to aid children in learning how to read and [[reading comprehension]].

In a 2012 proposal, it has been claimed that reading can be acquired naturally if print is constantly available at an early age in the same manner as spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Massaro | first1 = D. W. | year = 2012 | title = Acquiring Literacy Naturally: Behavioral science and technology could empower preschool children to learn to read naturally without instruction | url = http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/2012/4/acquiring-literacy-naturally| journal = American Scientist | volume = 100 | issue = | pages = 324–333 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If an appropriate form of written text is made available before formal schooling begins, reading should be learned inductively, emerge naturally, and with no significant negative consequences. This proposal challenges the commonly held belief that written language requires formal instruction and schooling. Its success would change current views of literacy and schooling. Using developments in behavioral science and technology, an interactive system (Technology Assisted Reading Acquisition, TARA) would enable young pre-literate children to accurately perceive and learn properties of written language by simple exposure to the written form.

In Australia a number of State governments have introduced Reading Challenges to improve literacy. The Premier's Reading Challenge in South Australia, launched by Premier Mike Rann has one of the highest participation rates in the world for reading challenges. It has been embraced by more than 95% of public, private and religious schools.&lt;ref&gt;Center for National Policy, Washington DC, What States Can Do, 2 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-conflict settings===

Programs have been implemented in regions that have an ongoing conflict or in a post-conflict stage. The Norwegian Refugee Council Pack program has been used in 13 post-conflict countries since 2003. The program organizers believe that daily routines and other wise predictable activities help the transition from war to peace.  Learners can select one area in vocational training for a year-long period.  They complete required courses in agriculture, life skills, literacy and numeracy.  Results have shown that active participation and management of the members of the program are important to the success of the program. These programs share the use of integrated basic education, e.g. literacy, numeracy, scientific knowledge, local history and culture, native and mainstream language skills, and apprenticeships.&lt;ref name=Bernhardt/&gt;

===Teaching non-native users===
Although there is considerable awareness that language deficiencies (lacking proficiency) are disadvantageous to immigrants settling in a new country, there appears to be a lack of pedagogical approaches that address the instruction of literacy to migrant English language learners (ELLs). Harvard scholar Catherine Snow (2001) called for a gap to be addresses: "The TESOL field needs a concerted research effort to inform literacy instruction for such children ... to determine when to start literacy instruction and how to adapt it to the LS reader's needs".&lt;ref&gt;Snow, C. (2001). Learning to Read in an L2.TESOL Quarterly: 35:4 599-601&lt;/ref&gt; The scenario becomes more complex when there is no choice in such decisions as in the case of the current migration trends with citizens from the Middle East and Africa being relocated to English majority nations due to various political or social reasons. Recent developments to address the gap in teaching literacy to second or foreign language learners has been ongoing and promising results have been shown by Pearson and Pellerine (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Pearson and Pellerine (2010) Teaching for Understanding in Higher Education: A Framework for Developing Literacy within a TESOL Context. http://marifa.hct.ac.ae/2010/100&lt;/ref&gt; which integrates Teaching for Understanding, a curricular framework from the Harvard Graduate School of Education. A series of pilot projects had been carried out in the Middle East and Africa (see Patil, 2016).&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/canadian-teacher-literacy-visual-arts-1.3635661|title=How an educator from Nova Scotia uses cameras to teach English in Ethiopia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work significant interest from the learners perspective have been noticed through the integration of visual arts as springboards for literacy oriented instruction. In one case migrant women had been provided with cameras and a walking tour of their local village was provided to the instructor as the women photographed their tour focusing on places and activities that would later be used for writings about their daily life. In essence a narrative of life. Other primers for writing activities include: painting, sketching, and other craft projects (e.g. gluing activities).

[[File:Sample_sketch_of_milestone.jpg|thumb|right|Sample milestone sketch]]

A series of pilot studies were carried out to investigate alternatives to instructing literacy to migrant ELLs,&lt;ref name="stephenpellerin4.wixsite.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stephenpellerin4.wixsite.com/altlit|title=altlit|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; starting from simple trials aiming to test the teaching of photography to participants with no prior photography background, to isolating painting and sketching activities that could later be integrated into a larger pedagogical initiative. In efforts to develop alternative approaches for literacy instruction utilising visual arts, work was carried out with Afghan labourers, Bangladeshi tailors, Emirati media students, internal Ethiopian migrants (both labourers and university students), and a street child.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="elgazette.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elgazette.com/item/296-why-every-picture-tells-a-story.html|title=Why every picture tells a story - EL Gazette|first=Andrea|last=Perez|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stephenpellerin4.wixsite.com"/&gt;

[[File:Migrant_Woman_Reviewing_Photography,_Making_Seletions_for_Writing.jpeg|thumb|left|Reviewing photos after photowalk]]
 
It should be pointed out that in such challenging contexts sometimes the teaching of literacy may have unforeseen barriers. The ''EL Gazette'' reported that in the trials carried out in Ethiopia, for example, it was found that all ten of the participants had problems with vision.&lt;ref name="elgazette.com"/&gt; In order to overcome this, or to avoid such challenges, preliminary health checks can help inform pre-teaching in order to better assist in the teaching/learning of literacy.

In a visual arts approach to literacy instruction a benefit can be the inclusion of both a traditional literacy approach (reading and writing) while at the same time addressing 21st Century digital literacy instruction through the inclusion of digital cameras and posting images onto the web. Many scholars&lt;ref&gt;https://calico.org/bookfiles/pdfs/DigitalLiteracies.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; feel that the inclusion of digital literacy is necessary to include under the traditional umbrella of literacy instruction specifically when engaging second language learners. (Also see: [[Digital literacy]].)&lt;ref&gt;Hutchison and
Woodward (2013). A Planning Cycle for Integrating Digital Technology Into Literacy Instruction. TOC. Volume 67, Issue 6 March 2014 Pages 455–464&lt;/ref&gt; {{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}

Other ways in which visual arts have been integrated into literacy instruction for migrant populations include integrating aspects of visual art with the blending of core curricular goals.

&lt;!-- (I'm commenting this out because it is poorly written, refers to images which aren't currently part of the page, and is getting way off topic.)  In the following images a student can be seen photographing, sketching, and estimating the volume of an area (V = l * w * h). In the other image a street walk photographing elements from the periodic table can be seen, sketches based on microscopy introduce basic biology as well as provide implicit opportunities to develop language for sequencing, and in another the pupil paints a landscape to approach geography.  Also see: [[:File:Going_in_to_the_field_to_sketch.jpg]], and [[:File:Process_Painting.jpg]] --&gt;

===Teaching migrant/immigrant language users===

A more pressing challenge in education is the instruction of literacy to Migrant English Language Learners (MELLs), a term coined by Pellerine. It is not just limited to English. “Due to the growing share of immigrants in many Western societies, there has been increasing concern for the degree to which immigrants acquire language that is spoken in the destination country” (Tubergen 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Tubergen, F. (2006). Immigrant Integration: A Cross National Study. Scholarly Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; Remembering that teaching literacy to a native in their L1 can be challenging, and the challenge becomes more cognitively demanding when in a second language (L2), the task can become considerably more difficult when confronted with a migrant who has made a sudden change (migrated) and requires the second language upon arrival in the country of destination. In many instances a migrant will not have the opportunity, for many obvious reasons, to start school again at grade one and acquire the language naturally. In these situations alternative interventions need to take place.

In working with illiterate people (and individuals with low-proficiency in an L2) following the composition of some artifact like in taking a photo, sketching an event, or painting an image, a stage of orality has been seen as an effective way to understand the intention of the learner.

[[File:Including_Orality.jpg|thumb|centre|Including orality]]

In the accompanying image from left to right a) an image taken during a phototour of the participant's village. This image is of the individual at her shop, and this is one of her products that she sells, dung for cooking fuel. The image helps the interlocutor understand the realities of the participants daily life and most importantly it allows the participant the opportunity to select what they feel is important to them. b) This is an image of a student explaining and elaborating the series of milestones in her life to a group. In this image the student had a very basic ability and with some help was able to write brief captions under the images. While she speaks a recording of her story takes place to understand her story and to help develop it in the L2. The third image is of a painting that had been used with a composite in Photoshop. With further training participants can learn how to blend images they would like to therefore introducing elements of digital literacies, beneficial in many spheres of life in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer, Mark; Matuchniak, Tina (2010). "New Technology and Digital Worlds: Analyzing Evidence of Equity in Access, Use, and Outcomes". Review of Research in Education. 34: 179–225. doi:10.3102/0091732X09349791&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sample_of_alternative_process_writing_primed_with_visual_arts.jpg|thumb|right|Two sample scenarios]]

In the following image (see right) you can see two samples 1) One in Ethiopia from stencil to more developed composition based on a village tour, photography, and paintings. 2) In the Middle East at a tailor's shop focusing English for Specific Purposes (ESP) and in this example the writing has evolved from photography, sketching, and in situ exposure for the instructor (much like the village tour in sample one).

From the work based in Ethiopia, participants were asked to rate preference of activity, on a scale of 1-10. The survey prompt was: On a scale of 1 - 10 how would you rate photography as an activity that helped you get inspiration for your writing activities (think of enjoyment and usefulness). The following activities were rated, in order of preference - activities used as primers for writing:

* Photography 97%
* Oral presentations sharing your art 92%
* Process painting 84%
* Painting 82%
* Sketching 78% 
* Gluing activities 72%
* Stencil/tracing activities 60%

More research would need to be conducted to confirm such trends.

In bringing work together from students in culminating projects, authorship programs have been successful in bringing student work together in book format. Such artifacts can be used to both document learning, but more importantly reinforce language and content goals.

[[File:Covers_for_Authorship_Initiatives_to_Promote_Literacy_via_Visual_Art_with_ELLs.jpg|thumb|right|Sample covers of completed authorship created books]]

The culmination of such writings, into books can evoke both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Form feedback by students involved in such initiatives the responses have indicated that the healthy pressures of collective and collaborative work was beneficial.

===Importance===

Teaching people to read and write, in a traditional sense of the meaning (literacy) is a very complex task in a native language. To do this in a second language becomes increasingly more complex, and in the case of migrants relocating to another country there can be legal and policy driven boundaries that prohibit the naturalization and acquisition of citizen ship based on language proficiency. In Canada&lt;ref&gt;Pagtakhan (2016). Language requirement for citizenship unnecessary, Reis Pagtakhan writes: Immigrants must pass a language test to become Canadian citizens years after they arrive. CBC News, retrieved at: http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/immigration-language-requirement-reis-pagtakhan-1.3568590 on 27 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; for example despite a debate, language tests are required years after settling into Canada.

But Canadian EL instructor and photographer Steve Pellerine has found that the technique, along with others based around the visual arts, has helped some of his most challenging groups to learn". Visual arts have been viewed as an effective way to approach literacy instruction - the art being primers for subsequent literacy tasks within a scaffolded curricular design, such at Teaching for Understanding (TfU) or Understanding by Design (UbD).

==Literacy by continent==
===Literacy in Europe===
====United Kingdom====
Nearly one in ten young adult women has poor reading and writing skills in the UK in the 21st century.  This seriously damages their employent prospects and many are trapped in poverty.  Lack of reading skill is a social stigma and women tend to hide their difficulty rather than seeking help.  Girls on average do better than boys at English in school.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-45435973 Kate Winslet warns of 'shame' of illiteracy#] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  A quarter of British adults would struggle to read a bus timetable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rt.com/uk/357676-literacy-britain-adults-oecd/ Illiterate Britain: 1 in 20 adults have reading age of a 5-year-old]&lt;/ref&gt; 

=====England===== 
Literacy is first documented in the area of modern England on 24 September 54 BCE, on which day [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Quintus Cicero]] wrote to [[Cicero]] "from the nearest shores of Britain".&lt;ref&gt;R.S.O. Tomlin. Writing and Communication. In Artefacts in Roman Britain, their purpose and use. Lindsay Allason-Jones ed. Cambridge University Press 2011. page 133. {{ISBN|978-0-521-86012-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literacy was widespread under Roman rule, but became very rare, limited almost entirely to churchmen, after the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]]. In 12th and 13th century [[England]], the ability to recite a particular passage from the Bible in [[Latin]] entitled a [[common law]] defendant to the so-called [[benefit of clergy]]—i.e., trial before an [[ecclesiastical court]], where sentences were more lenient, instead of a secular one, where hanging was a likely sentence. Thus literate lay defendants often claimed the right to benefit of clergy, while an illiterate person who had memorized the psalm used as the literacy test, [[Psalm 51]] ("O God, have mercy upon me..."), could also claim benefit of clergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Baker, John R. |title=An Introduction to English Legal History |publisher=Butterworths LexisNexis |location=London |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=978-0-406-93053-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite lacking a system of free and compulsory primary schooling, England managed to reach near universal literacy in the nineteenth century as a result of shared, informal learning systems such as family members, fellow workers, and/or benevolent employers, to name a few. Even with near universal literacy rates, the gap between male and female literacy rates continued to persist until the early twentieth century. Many female readers in the West during the nineteenth century were able to read, but unable to write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|date=2011|publisher=Getty Publications|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781606060834|page=98|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Wales=====
Formal higher education in the arts and sciences in [[Wales]], from the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] to the 18th century, was the preserve of the wealthy and the [[clergy]]. As in England, Welsh history and archaeological finds dating back to the [[Bronze Age]] reveal not only reading and writing, but also [[alchemy]], [[botany]], advanced maths and science. Following the Roman occupation and the conquest by the English, education in Wales was at a very low ebb in the early modern period; in particular, formal education was only available in English while the majority of the population spoke only [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. The first modern grammar schools were established in Welsh towns such as [[Ruthin]], [[Brecon]], and [[Cowbridge]]. One of the first modern national education methods to use the native Welsh language was started by [[Griffith Jones (Llanddowror)|Griffith Jones]] in 1731.&lt;ref&gt;For more information see [[History of Wales#Early modern period]]&lt;/ref&gt; Jones was the rector of [[Llanddowror]] from 1716 and remained there for the rest of his life. He organized and introduced a Welsh medium circulating school system, which was attractive and effective for Welsh speakers, while also teaching them English, which gave them access to broader educational sources. The circulating schools may have taught half the country's population to read. Literacy rates in Wales by the mid-18th century were one of the highest.

====Continental Europe====
The ability to read did not necessarily imply the ability to write. The [[Swedish Church Law 1686|1686 church law]] (''kyrkolagen'') of the Kingdom of [[Sweden]] (which at the time included all of modern Sweden, [[Finland]], [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]]) enforced literacy on the people, and by 1800 the ability to read was close to 100%. This was directly dependent on the need to read religious texts in the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran faith]] in [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]. As a result, literacy in these countries was inclined towards reading, specifically.&lt;ref name="Books: A Living History"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|date=2011|publisher=Getty Publications|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781606060834|page=97|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as late as the 19th century, many Swedes, especially women, could not write. The exception to this rule were the men and women of [[Iceland]] who achieved widespread literacy without formal schooling, libraries, or printed books via informal tuition by religious leaders and peasant teachers.&lt;ref name="Books: A Living History" /&gt; That said, the situation in England was far worse than in [[Scandinavia]], [[France]], and [[Prussia]]: as late as 1841, 33% of all Englishmen and 44% of Englishwomen signed marriage certificates with their [[Signature#Function and types of signatures|mark]] as they were unable to write (government-financed public education was not available in England until 1870 and, even then, on a limited basis){{citation needed|date=March 2018}}.

Historian [[Ernest Gellner]] argues that [[Continental Europe]]an countries were far more successful in implementing educational reform precisely because their governments were more willing to invest in the population as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author= Ernest Gellner |title=Nations and Nationalism |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, NY |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-8014-9263-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government oversight allowed countries to standardize curriculum and secure funding through legislation thus enabling educational programs to have a broader reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Literacy in early modern Europe : culture and education, 1500-1800|last=Houston|first=Rab|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9780582368101|edition=2nd |location=Oxfordshire, England|pages=|oclc=884586117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the present-day concepts of literacy have much to do with the 15th-century invention of the [[movable type]] [[printing press]], it was not until the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the mid-19th century that paper and books became affordable to all classes of industrialized society. Until then, only a small percentage of the population were literate as only wealthy individuals and institutions could afford the materials. Even {{As of|2008|alt=today}}, the cost of paper and books is a barrier to universal literacy in some less-industrialized nations.

On the other hand, historian [[Harvey Graff]] argues that the introduction of [[Compulsory education|mass schooling]] was in part an effort to control the type of literacy that the [[working class]] had access to. According to Graff, literacy learning was increasing outside of formal settings (such as schools) and this uncontrolled, potentially critical reading could lead to increased radicalization of the populace. In his view, mass schooling was meant to temper and control literacy, not spread it.&lt;ref name="Graff1991"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Graff|first=Harvey J. |title=The literacy myth: cultural integration and social structure in the nineteenth century |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AAj9sM99qekC|year=1991|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-88738-884-2|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AAj9sM99qekC&amp;pg=PR26 xxvi]|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graff also points out, using the example of Sweden, that mass literacy can be achieved without formal schooling or instruction in writing.

===Literacy in North America===

====Canada====
=====Colonialism (1600s–1762)=====

Research on the literacy rates of Canadians in the colonial days rested largely on examinations of the proportion of signatures to marks on parish acts (birth, baptismal, and marriage registrations).  Although some researchers have concluded that signature counts drawn from marriage registers in nineteenth century [[France]] corresponded closely with literacy tests given to military conscripts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Furet|first=François|title=Lire et écrire: l'alphabétisation des Français de Calvin à Jules Ferry|year=1977|publisher=Editions de Minuit|location=Paris|page=353}}&lt;/ref&gt; others regard this methodology as a "relatively unimaginative treatment of the complex practices and events that might be described as literacy" (Curtis, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;1-2).&lt;ref name="curtis1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Bruce|title=Beyond Signature Literacy: New Research Directions|journal=Historical Studies in Education / Revue d'Histoire de l'Éducation|year=2007|issue=Fall Special Issue|pages=1–12|url=http://historicalstudiesineducation.ca/index.php/edu_hse-rhe/article/view/533/734|accessdate=23 October 2012|volume=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But censuses (dating back to 1666) and official records of [[New France]] offer few clues of their own on the population's levels of literacy, therefore leaving few options in terms of materials from which to draw literary rate estimates.

In his research of literacy rates of males and females in New France, Trudel found that in 1663, of 1,224 persons in New France who were of marriageable age, 59% of grooms and 46% of brides wrote their name; however, of the 3,000-plus colony inhabitants, less than 40% were native born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Magnuson|first=Roger|title=Two myths in New France education|journal=McGill Journal of Education|year=1985|volume=20|issue=3|url=http://mje.mcgill.ca/index.php/MJE/article/viewArticle/7636|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signature rates were therefore likely more reflective of rates of literacy among French immigrants. Magnuson's (1985) research revealed a trend: signature rates for the period of 1680–1699 were 42% for males, 30% for females; in 1657-1715, they were 45% for males and 43% for females; in 1745-1754, they were higher for females than for males. He believed that this upward trend in rates of females’ ability to sign documents was largely attributed to the larger number of female religious orders, and to the proportionately more active role of women in health and education, while the roles of male religious orders were largely to serve as parish priests, [[Missionary|missionaries]], military chaplains and explorers. 1752 marked the date that Canada's first newspaper—the ''[[Halifax Gazette]]''—began publication.&lt;ref name="thecanadianencyclopedia1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Newspapers|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/newspapers|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica-Dominion Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====From the British Conquest (1763) to Confederation (1867)=====

The end of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763 allowed two [[Philadelphia]] printers to come to [[Quebec City|Québec City]] and to begin printing a bilingual ''[[Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph|Quebec Gazette]]'' in 1764, while in 1785 [[Fleury Mesplet]] started publication of the ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]'', which is now the oldest continuing newspaper in the country.&lt;ref name="thecanadianencyclopedia1"/&gt;

In the 19th century, everything about print changed, and literature in its many forms became much more available.&lt;ref name=Aliaga-Buchenau&gt;{{cite book|last=Aliaga-Buchenau|first=Ana-Isabel|title=Dangerous Potential of Reading: Readers and the Negotiation of Power in Selected Nineteenth-Century Narratives|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-96833-1|page=202|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/oculbrock/docDetail.action?docID=10098857}}&lt;/ref&gt; But educating the Canadian population in reading and writing was nevertheless a huge challenge. Concerned about the strong [[French Canadians|French Canadian]] presence in the colony, the British authorities repeatedly tried to help establish schools that were outside the control of religious authorities, but these efforts were largely undermined by the [[Catholic Church]] and later the Anglican clergy.&lt;ref name="History of Education TCE"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Education|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/history-of-education|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica-Dominion Institute|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early 1820s in [[Lower Canada]], classical college curriculum, which was monopolized by the Church, was also subject to growing liberal and lay criticism, arguing it was fit first and foremost to produce priests, when Lower Canadians needed to be able to compete effectively with foreign industry and commerce and with the immigrants who were monopolizing trade (Curtis, 1985).&lt;ref name="curtis1"/&gt;  Liberal and lay attempts to promote parish schools generated a reaction from the Catholic and later the Anglican clergy in which the dangers of popular literacy figured centrally.&lt;ref name="History of Education TCE" /&gt;  Both churches shared an opposition to any educational plan that encouraged lay reading of the Bible, and spokesmen for both warned of the evil and demoralizing tendencies of unregulated reading in general. Granted the power to organize parish schooling through the Vestry School Act of 1824, the Catholic clergy did nothing effective.&lt;ref name="curtis1"/&gt;

Despite this, the invention of the printing press had laid the foundation for the modern era and universal social literacy, and so it is that with time, "technologically, literacy had passed from the hands of an elite to the populace at large. Historical factors and sociopolitical conditions, however, have determined the extent to which universal social literacy has come to pass".&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;Audrey M. Thomas, "[http://www.nald.ca/library/research/athomas/aduill/cover.htm Adult Illiteracy in Canada—A Challenge]" (Ottawa: Canadian Commission for UNESCO, Occasional Paper 42, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

=====1868–1986=====
In 1871 only about half of French Canadian men in [[Canada]] self-reported that they were literate, whereas 90 percent of other Canadian men said they could read and write, but information from the Canadian Families Project sample of the 1901 [[Census in Canada|Census of Canada]] indicated that literacy rates for French Canadians and other Canadians increased, as measured by the ability of men between the ages of 16 and 65 to answer literacy questions.&lt;ref name="Green, A."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Green|first=A|author2=MacKinnon, M. |author3=Minns, C. |title=Conspicuous by their absence: French Canadians and the settlement of the Canadian West|journal=The Journal of Economic History|year=2005|volume=65|issue=3|pages=822–849|jstor=3875019|doi=10.1017/S0022050705000306|url=http://www.tcd.ie/Economics/staff/minnsc/research/jeh_galley_proofs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsory attendance in schools was legislated in the late 19th century in all provinces but [[Quebec]], but by then, a change in parental attitudes towards educating the new generation meant that many children were already attending regularly.&lt;ref name="History of Education TCE"/&gt;  Unlike the emphasis of school promoters on character formation, the shaping of values, the inculcation of political and social attitudes, and proper behaviour, many parents supported schooling because they wanted their children to learn to read, write, and do [[arithmetic]].&lt;ref name="History of Education TCE"/&gt; Efforts were made to exert power and religious, moral, economic/professional, and social/cultural influence over children who were learning to read by dictating the contents of their school readers accordingly. But educators broke from these spheres of influence and also taught literature from a more child-centred perspective: for the pleasure of it.&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Sharon|title=Regaining Pleasure in the Teaching of Reading|journal=Language Arts|year=2012|volume=89|issue=5|pages=318–328|url=http://www.ncte.org/journals/la/issues/v89-5|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational change in Québec began as a result of a major commission of inquiry at the start of what came to be called the "[[Quiet Revolution]]" in the early 1960s.  In response to the resulting recommendations, the Québec government revamped the school system in an attempt to enhance the francophone population's general educational level and to produce a better-qualified labour force. Catholic Church leadership was rejected in favour of government administration and vastly increased budgets were given to school boards across the province.&lt;ref name="History of Education TCE"/&gt;

With time, and with continuing inquiry into the literacy achievement levels of Canadians, the definition of literacy moved from a [[Dichotomy|dichotomous]] one (either a person could, or couldn’t write his or her name, or was literate or illiterate), to ones that considered its multidimensionality, along with the qualitative and quantitative aspects of literacy. In the 1970s, organizations like the Canadian Association for Adult Education (CAAE) believed that one had to complete the 8th grade to achieve functional literacy.  Examination of 1976 census data, for example, found that 4,376,655, or 28.4% of Canadians 15 years of age and over reported a level of schooling of less than grade 9 and were thus deemed not functionally literate.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt; But in 1991, UNESCO formally acknowledged Canada's findings that assessment of educational attainment as proxy measure of literacy was not as reliable as was direct assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNESCO|title=Functional Literacy in Eastern and Western Europe|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0009/000906/090661eo.pdf |publisher=UNESCO Institute for Education|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dissatisfaction manifested itself in the development of actual proficiency tests that measure reading literacy more directly.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=OECD, Statistics Canada|title=Literacy for Life: Further Results from the Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey|publisher=OECD Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Direct systematic measures of literacy in Canada, 1987 to present=====

Canada conducted its first literacy survey in 1987 which discovered that there were more than five million [[Functional illiteracy|functionally illiterate]] adults in Canada, or 24 per cent of the adult population.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; [[Statistics Canada]] then conducted three national and international literacy surveys of the adult population — the first one in 1989 commissioned by the [[Employment and Social Development Canada|Human Resources and Skills Development Canada]] (HRSDC) department.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

This first survey was called the "Literacy Skills Used in Daily Activities" (LSUDA) survey, and was modeled on the 1985 U.S. survey of young adults (YALS).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=OECD, Statistics Canada (2011)|title=Literacy for Life: Further Results from the Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey|publisher=OECD Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It represented a first attempt in Canada to produce skill measures deemed comparable across languages. Literacy, for the first time, was measured on a continuum of skills.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  The survey found that 16% of Canadians had literacy skills too limited to deal with most of the printed material encountered in daily life whereas 22% were considered "narrow" readers.

In 1994-95, Canada participated in the first multi-country, multi-language assessment of adult literacy, the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS). A stratified multi-stage probability sample design was used to select the sample from the Census Frame. The sample was designed to yield separate samples for the two Canadian official languages, [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], and participants were measured on the dimensions of prose literacy, document literacy and quantitative literacy.  The survey found that 42.2%, 43% and 42.2% of Canadians between the ages of 16 and 65 scored at the lowest two levels of Prose Literacy, Document Literacy and Quantitative Literacy, respectively.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  The survey presented many important correlations, among which was a strong plausible link between literacy and a country's economic potential.

In 2003, Canada participated in the Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey (ALL). This survey contained identical measures for assessing the prose and document literacy proficiencies, allowing for comparisons between survey results on these two measures and found that 41.9% and 42.6% of Canadians between the ages of 16 and 65 scored at the lowest two levels of Prose Literacy and document literacy respectively.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Further, Canadians’ mean scores also improved on both the prose and the document literacy scales. Energy production:36%, transportation: 24%, homes and businesses: 12%, industry: 11%, agriculture: 10%, and waste: 7%.

The [[OECD]]'s [[Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies]] (PIAAC) is expected to produce new comparative skill profiles in late 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&amp;SDDS=4406&amp;lang=en&amp;db=imdb&amp;adm=8&amp;dis=2 |title=Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) |publisher=3.statcan.gc.ca |date=12 July 2012 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====
In the last 40 years, the rate of illiteracy in [[Mexico]] has been steadily decreasing.  In the 1960s, because the majority of the residents of the federal capital were illiterate, the planners of the [[Mexico City Metro]] designed a system of unique icons to identify each station in the system in addition to its formal name. However, The INEGI´s census data of 1970 showed a national average illiteracy rate of 25.8%; the last census data puts the national average at 6.9%. Mexico still has a gender educational bias. The illiteracy rate for women in the last census was 8.1% compared with 5.6% for men. Rates differ across regions and states. [[Chiapas]], [[Guerrero]] and [[Oaxaca]], the states with the highest [[Poverty|poverty rate]], had greater than 15% illiteracy in 2010(17.8%, 16.7% and 16.3 respectively). In contrast, the illiteracy rates in the Federal District (D.F. / Mexico City) and in some northern states like [[Nuevo León]], [[Baja California]], and [[Coahuila]] were below 3% in the 2010 census (2.1%, 2.2%, 2.6% and 2.6% respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/poblacion/analfabeta.aspx?tema=P|title=Analfabetismo.

Before the 20th century white illiteracy was not uncommon and many of the slave states made it illegal to teach slaves to read.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/slavery/experience/education/docs1.html ''Acts against the education of slaves South Carolina, 1740 and Virginia, 1819''] Slavery Experience, PBS&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900 the situation had improved somewhat, but 44% of black people remained illiterate. There were significant improvements for African American and other races in the early 20th century as the descendants of former slaves, who had had no educational opportunities, grew up in the post Civil War period and often had some chance to obtain a basic education. The gap in illiteracy between white and black adults continued to narrow through the 20th century, and in 1979 the rates were about the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/naal/lit_history.asp |title=National Assessment of Adult Literacy |publisher=Nces.ed.gov |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Cultural and westernized literacy for Native Americans in the United States =====

[[File:Carlisle pupils.jpg|upright=1.7|right|thumb|Native youth in front of [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] in Pennsylvania c.&amp;nbsp;1900]]

Before colonization, oral storytelling and communication composed most if not all [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] literacy. Native people communicated and retained their histories verbally—it was not until the beginning of [[American Indian boarding schools]] that reading and writing forms of literacy were forced onto Native Americans. While literacy rates of English increased, [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|forced assimilation]] exposed Native children to [[Physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse]], unsanitary living conditions, and even death.{{clarify|date=December 2014}} Many students ran away in an attempt to hold on to their [[cultural identity]] and literary traditions that were relevant to their community. While these formalized forms of literacy prepared Native youth to exist in the changing society, they destroyed all traces of their cultural literacy. Native children would return to their families unable to communicate with them due to the loss of their [[indigenous language]]. In the 20th and 21st century, there is still a struggle to learn and maintain cultural language. But education initiatives and programs have increased overall—according to the 2010 census, 86 percent of the overall population of Native Americans and Alaska Natives have high school diplomas, and 28 percent have a [[bachelor's degree]] or higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month: November 2011 |publisher = [[United States Census Bureau]] | url= https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/cb11-ff22.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literacy in Africa===
The literacy rates in Africa vary significantly between countries. The highest registered literacy rate in the region is in [[Equatorial Guinea]] and [[Libya]] (both 94.2%), while the lowest literacy rate is in [[South Sudan]] (27%).&lt;ref name="Cwfbl"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html#xx|title=World |work=[[CIA Factbook]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poorer youth in sub-Saharan Africa have fewer educational opportunities to become literate compared with wealthier families.  They often must leave school because of being needed at home to farm or care for siblings.&lt;ref name="Bernhardt"/&gt;

[[File:Figure 2 Most illiterate persons in South Asia and Subsaharan Africa Reading the past writing the future.svg|thumb|Most illiterate persons now live in Southern Asia or sub-Saharan Africa.]]
In sub-Saharan Africa, the rate of literacy has not improved enough to compensate for the effects of demographic growth. As a result, the number of illiterate adults has risen by 27% over the last 20 years, reaching 169 million in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, Information bulletin: School and teaching resources in sub-Saharan Africa, 2012, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/ib9-regional-education-africa-2012-en-v5.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, out of the 775 million illiterate adults in the world in 2010, more than one fifth were in sub- Saharan Africa – in other words, 20% of the adult population. The countries with the lowest levels of literacy in the world are also concentrated in this region. These include Niger (28.7%), Burkina Faso (28.7%), Mali (33.4%), Chad (35.4%) and Ethiopia (39%), where adult literacy rates are well below 50%. There are, however, certain exceptions, like Equatorial Guinea, with a literacy rate of 94%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002318/231867e.pdf|title=Digital Services for Education in Africa|last=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Algeria====
The literacy rate of Algeria is around 70%: education is compulsory and free in [[Algeria]] up to age of 17.

====Botswana====
[[Botswana]] has among the highest literacy rates in the [[Developing country|developing world]] with around 85% of its population being literate.

====Burkina Faso====
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:A UNV teacher conducts a small class of children in Burkina Faso, Africa. PHOTO UNDP.png|right|thumb|A UNV teacher conducts a small class of children in Burkina Faso, Africa. Photo by [[United Nations|U.N.]]]] --&gt;
[[Burkina Faso]] has a very low literacy rate of 28.7%. The government defines literacy as anyone at least 15 years of age and up who can read and write.&lt;ref name="Cwfbl" /&gt; To improve the literacy rate, the government has received at least 80 volunteer teachers. A severe lack of primary school teachers causes problems for any attempt to improve the literacy rate and school enrollment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Volunteer teachers combat illiteracy in Burkina Faso|url=http://www.africa.undp.org/content/rba/en/home/ourwork/povertyreduction/successstories/burkina-faso-illiteracy/|website=United Nations Development Programme|accessdate=3 October 2014|ref=UNDP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Egypt====
[[Egypt]] has a relatively high literacy rate. The adult literacy rate in 2010 was estimated at 72%.&lt;ref name="unescolit"&gt;{{cite web|title=National adult literacy rates (15+), youth literacy rates (15-24) and elderly literacy rates (65+)|url=http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=210|publisher=UNESCO Institute for Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Education in Egypt|Education]] is compulsory from ages 6 to 15 and free for all children to attend. 93% of children enter primary school today, compared with 87% in 1994.

According to the Ministry of Information of [[Eritrea]], the nation has an estimated literacy rate of 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ministry of Information of Eritrea|title=Adult Education Program gaining momentum: Ministry|url=http://www.shabait.com/news/local-news/12263-adult-education-program-gaining-momentum-ministry|publisher=Shabait|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ethiopia====
The Ethiopians are among the first literate people in the world, having written, read, and created manuscripts in their ancient language of [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] ([[Amharic language|Amharic]]) since the second century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Weninger, Stefan. ''Semitic Languages: An International Handbook''. Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; All boys learned to read the Psalms around the age of 7.

====Guinea====
[[Guinea]] has a literacy rate of 41%. The Guinea government defines literacy as anyone who can read or write who is at least 15 years old.&lt;ref name="Cwfbl" /&gt; Guinea was the first to use the Literacy, Conflict Resolution, and Peacebuilding project. This project was developed to increase agriculture production, develop key skills, resolve conflict, improve literacy, and numeracy skills. The LCRP worked within refugee camps near the border of Sierra Leone, however this project only lasted from 1999 to 2001. There are several other international projects working within the country that have similar goals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCaffery|first1=Juliet|title=Using transformative models of adult literacy in conflict resolution and peacebuilding processes at community level: examples from Guinea, Sierra Leone and Sudan.|journal=Compare: A Journal of Comparative Education|date=Dec 2005|volume=35|issue=4|doi=10.1080/03057920500368548|pages=443–462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kenya====
The literacy rate in [[Kenya]] among people below 20 years of age is over 70%, as the first 8 years of primary school are provided tuition-free by the government. In January 2008, the government began offering a restricted program of free secondary education. Literacy is much higher among the young than the old population, with the total being about 53% for the country. Most of this literacy, however, is elementary—not secondary or advanced.

====Mali====
[[Mali]] has one of the lowest literacy rates in the world, at 33.4%, with males having a 43.1% literacy rate and females having a 24.6% literacy rate. The government defines literacy as anyone who is at least 15 and over who can read or write.&lt;ref name="Cwfbl" /&gt; The government of Mali and international organizations in recent years has taken steps to improve the literacy rate. The government recognized the slow progress in literacy rates and began created ministries for basic education and literacy for their national languages in 2007. To also improve literacy the government planned to increase its education budget by 3%, when this was purposed it was at 35% in 2007. The lack of literate adults causes the programs to be slowed. The programs need qualified female trainers is a major problem because most men refuse to send female family members to be trained under male teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mali: Still a long way to go to meet adult literacy targets|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/77803/mali-still-a-long-way-to-go-to-meet--liteadultracy-targets|accessdate=3 October 2014|work=IRIN|date=17 April 2008|ref=IRIN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mauritius====
Free education in [[Mauritius]] didn't proceed beyond the primary level until 1976, so many women now in their 50s or older left school at age 12. The younger generation (below 50) are however extremely well educated with very high educational expectations placed upon pupils. Education is today free from pre-primary to tertiary (only admission fees remain at University level). Most professional people have at least a bachelor's degree. Mauritian students consistently rank top in the world each year for the Cambridge International [[GCE Ordinary Level|O Level]], International A and AS level examinations. Most Mauritian children, even at primary level, attend tuition after school and at weekends to cope with the highly competitive public school system where admission to prestigious public colleges (secondary) and most sought after university courses depend on merit based academic performance.

The adult [[literacy rate]] was estimated at 89.8% in 2011.&lt;ref name="census 2011"/&gt; Male literacy was 92.3% and Female literacy 87.3%.&lt;ref name="census 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.govmu.org/portal/goc/cso/ei977/pop2011.pdf|publisher=[[Statistics Mauritius]], [[Government Portal of Mauritius]]|title=2011 POPULATION CENSUS&amp;nbsp;— MAIN RESULTS|year=2011|accessdate=22 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223170840/http://www.govmu.org/portal/goc/cso/ei977/pop2011.pdf|archivedate=23 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Niger====
[[Niger]] has an extremely low literacy rate at 28.7%. However, the gender gap between males and females is a major problem for the country, men have a literacy rate of 42.9% and women a literacy rate of 15.1%. The [[Government of Niger|Nigerien government]] defines literacy as anyone who can read or write over the age of 15.&lt;ref name="Cwfbl" /&gt; The Niass Tijaniyya, a predominate group of the [[Sufism|Sufi brotherhoods]], has started anti-poverty, empowerment, and literacy campaigns. The women in [[Kiota]] had not attempted to improve their education, or economic standing. Saida Oumul Khadiri Niass, known as Maman, through talking to men and women throughout the community changed the community's beliefs on appropriate behavior for women because the community recognized she was married to a leader of the Niass Tijaniyya. Maman's efforts has allowed women in Kiota to own small businesses, sell in the market place, attend literacy classes, and organize small associations that can give micro loans. Maman personally teaches children in and around Kiota, with special attention to girls. Maman has her students require instructor permission to allow the girls' parents to marry their daughters early. This increases the amount of education these girls receive, as well as delaying [[marriage]], [[pregnancy]], and having [[children]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barnes|first1=Shailly|title=RELIGION SOCIAL CAPITAL AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE SAHEL: THE NIASS TIJANIYYA IN NIGER|journal=Journal of International Affairs|date=2009|volume=62|issue=2|pages=209–221|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=1beab10b-5f42-4908-b98f-d353e358de2b%40sessionmgr4005&amp;hid=4105&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&amp;AN=39764466|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Senegal====
[[Senegal]] has a literacy rate of 49.7%; the government defines literacy as anyone who is at least 15 years of age and over who can read and write.&lt;ref name="Cwfbl" /&gt; However, many students do not attend school long enough to be considered literate. The government did not begin actively attempting to improve the literacy rate until 1971 when it gave the responsibility to Department for Vocational Training at the Secretariat for Youth and Sports. This department and subsequent following departments had no clear policy on literacy until the Department of Literacy and Basic Education was formed in 1986. The government of Senegal relies heavily on funding from the [[World Bank]] to fund its school system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nordtveit|first1=Bjorn|title=Producing Literacy and Civil Society: The Case of Senegal.|journal=Comparative Education Review|date=May 2008|volume=52|issue=2|doi=10.1086/528761|pages=175–198|url=http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1034&amp;context=cie_faculty_pubs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Somalia====
There is no reliable data on the nationwide literacy rate in [[Somalia]]. A 2013 FSNAU survey indicates considerable differences per region, with the autonomous northeastern [[Puntland]] region having the highest registered literacy rate at 72%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Ties: Remittances and Livelihoods Support in Puntland and Somaliland|url=http://www.fsnau.org/downloads/Remittances-and-Livelihoods-Support-in-Puntland-and-Somaliland.pdf|publisher=FSNAU|accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sierra Leone====
The [[Sierra Leone]] government defines literacy as anyone over the age of 15 who can read and write in [[English language|English]], [[Mende language|Mende]], [[Temne language|Temne]], or [[Arabic]]. Official statics put the literacy rate at 43.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Factbook|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html|website=CIA|accessdate=3 October 2014|ref=CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sierra Leone was the second country to use the Literacy, Conflict Resolution and Peacebuilding project. However, due to fighting near the city where the project was centered causing the project to be delayed until an arms amnesty was in place.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

{{main article|Education in the People's Republic of China}}
The [[China|PRC]] conducts standardized testing to assess proficiency in [[Standard Chinese]], known as "putonghua," but it is primarily for foreigners or those needing to demonstrate professional proficiency in the [[Beijing]] dialect. Literacy in languages like Chinese can be assessed by reading comprehension tests, just as in other languages, but historically has often been graded on the number of Chinese characters introduced during the speaker's schooling, with a few thousand considered the minimum for practical literacy. Social science surveys in China have repeatedly found that just more than half the population of China is conversant in spoken putonghua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=More than half of Chinese can speak mandarin |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |newspaper=China View |date=7 March 2007 |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/07/content_5812838.htm}} {{cite news |title=Beijing says 400 million Chinese cannot speak Mandarin |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |newspaper=BBC News |date=6 September 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-23975037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Literacy in India}}

Literacy is defined by the [[Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India]], as "[the ability of] a person aged 7 years and above [to]... both write and read with understanding in any language."&lt;ref name="India 2011"&gt;2011 Census of India: Chapter 6: "State of Literacy of Rural Urban Population". Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, Office of the Registrar and Census Commissioner, India, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Census of India, 2011|2011 census]], 74.04 percent.&lt;ref name="India 2011" /&gt;

====Laos====
[[File:Lao schoolgirls reading books.jpg|thumb|right|Three [[Lao people|Laotian]] girls sit outside their school, each absorbed in reading a book they received at a rural school book party.]]

[[Laos]] has the lowest level of adult literacy in all of [[Southeast Asia]] other than [[East Timor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/indicators/6.html hdrstats.undp.org], accessed 27 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Obstacles to literacy vary by country and culture as writing systems, quality of education, availability of written material, competition from other sources (television, video games, cell phones, and family work obligations), and culture all influence literacy levels. In Laos, which has a [[Phonetic transcription|phonetic]] alphabet, reading is relatively easy to learn—especially compared to [[English language|English]], where spelling and pronunciation rules are filled with exceptions, and [[Chinese language|Chinese]], with thousands of symbols to be memorized. But a lack of books and other written materials has hindered functional literacy in Laos, where many children and adults read so haltingly that the skill is hardly beneficial.

A literacy project in Laos addresses this by using what it calls "books that make literacy fun!" The project, [[Big Brother Mouse]], publishes colorful, easy-to-read books, then delivers them by holding book parties at rural schools. Some of the books are modeled on successful western books by authors such as [[Dr. Seuss]]; the most popular, however, are traditional Lao fairy tales. Two popular collections of folktales were written by Siphone Vouthisakdee, who comes from a village where only five children finished primary school.&lt;ref name="tibor"&gt;{{cite news|last=Krausz|first=Tibor|title=Publishing Children's Books – And Delivering Them by Elephant| url= http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Making-a-difference/2011/0221/Publishing-children-s-books-and-delivering-them-by-elephant| accessdate=25 December 2013|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Big Brother Mouse has also created village reading rooms, and published books for adult readers about subjects such as Buddhism, health, and baby care.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Bonnie. "Picturing Laos". Amherst Bulletin, 27 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pakistan====
In [[Pakistan]], the [[National Commission for Human Development]] (NCHD) aims to bring literacy to adults, especially women.
ISLAMABAD - UNESCO Islamabad Director Kozue Kay Nagata has said, "Illiteracy in Pakistan has fallen over two decades, thanks to the government and people of Pakistan for their efforts working toward meeting the [[Millennium Development Goals]]". "Today, 70 percent of Pakistani youths can read and write. In 20 years, illiterate population has been reduced significantly", she said while speaking at a function held in connection with [[International Literacy Day]].

However, she also emphasised on the need to do more to improve literacy in the country and said, "The proportion of population in Pakistan lacking basic reading and writing is too high. This is a serious obstacle for individual fulfillment, to the development of societies, and to mutual understanding between peoples." Referring to the recent national survey carried out by the Ministry of Education, Trainings and Standards in Higher Education with support of UNESCO, [[UNICEF]], and provincial and areas departments of education, Nagata pointed out that, in Pakistan, although primary school survival rate is 70 percent, gender gap still exists with only 68 percent of girls’ survival rate compared to 71 percent for boys. Specifically in the case of Punjab, she said, primary school survival rate today is better with 76 percent, but not without a gender gap of 8 percent points with 72 percent girls’ survival rate compared to 80 percent for boys. She also pointed out that average per student spending in primary level (age 5-9) was better in Punjab: Rs 6,998, compared to the national average. In [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], although almost the same amount (Rs 6,985) as in Punjab is spent per child, the primary school survival rate is only 53 percent. Girls’ survival rate is slightly better with 54 percent than that of boys which is 52 percent. Literate Pakistan Foundation, a non-profit organization, which was established in 2003, is a case study, which brings to light the solutions for removing this menace from its roots. It works to improve rate of literacy in Pakistan.

The data of the survey shows that in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], primary school survival rate is 67 percent which is lower than the national average of 70 percent. Furthermore, gender gap also exists with only 65 percent of girls’ survival rate compared to that of boys which is 68 percent. Per-student education expenditure in primary level (age 5-9) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is Rs 8,638. In [[Sindh]], primary school survival rate is 63percent, with a gender gap of only 67 percent of girls’ survival rate compared to 60 percent for boys. Per student education expenditure in primary level (age 5-9) in Sindh is Rs 5,019. Nagata made reference to the survey report and mentioned that the most common reason in Pakistan for children (both boys and girls) of age 10 to 18 years leaving school before completing primary grade is "the child not willing to go to school", which may be related to quality and learning outcome. She said, however, and sadly, for the girls living in rural communities the second highest reason for dropout is "parents did not allow" which might be related to prejudice and cultural norm against girls.

Early Filipinos devised and used their own system of writings from 300 BC, which derived from the [[Brahmic family of scripts]] of [[History of India|Ancient India]]. [[Baybayin]] became the most widespread of these derived scripts by the 11th century.

Early chroniclers, who came during the first Spanish expeditions to the islands, noted the proficiency of some of the natives, especially the chieftain and local kings, in [[Sanskrit]], [[Old Javanese]], [[Old Malay]], and several other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/lci/lci.htm |title=The Laguna Copperplate Inscription |publisher=A Philippine Leaf |last=Santos |first=Hector |date=26 October 1996 |accessdate=23 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121194304/http://bibingka.com/dahon/lci/lci.htm |archivedate=21 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bergreen|first=Laurence|title=Over The Edge of The World: Magellan's Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe|location=New York|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Spanish colonization of the islands, reading materials were destroyed to a far much less extent compared to the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Education and literacy was introduced only to the [[Peninsulars|Peninsulares]] and remained a privilege until the Americans came.

The Americans introduced the public schools system to the country which drove literacy rates up. English became the [[lingua franca]] in the Philippines. It was only during a brief period in the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]] that the Japanese were able to teach their [[Japanese language|language]] in the Philippines and teach the children their written language.

After [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], the Philippines had the highest literacy rates in Asia. It nearly achieved universal literacy once again in the 1980s and 1990s. Ever since then, the literacy rate has plummeted only to start regaining a few percentage years back.{{when|date=March 2017}}

The [[Department of Education (Philippines)|DepEd]], [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|CHED]], and other academic institutions encourage children to improve literacy skills and knowledge. The government has a program of literacy teaching starting in kindergarten. New reforms are being brought in shifting to a K-12 system which will teach children their regional languages before English, as opposed to the ten-year basic education program which teaches English and Filipino, the country's two official languages, from Grade 1.

[[File:MovingAverage.GIF|thumb|An example of two moving average curves]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:MA Example.jpg|thumb|right|13-point moving average. {{Deletable image-caption|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;
In [[statistics]], a '''moving average''' ('''rolling average''' or '''running average''') is a calculation to analyze data points by creating a series of [[average]]s of different subsets of the full data set. It is also called a '''moving mean''' ('''MM''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/bay_delta/docs/cmnt091412/sldmwa/booth_et_al_2006.pdf Hydrologic Variability of the Cosumnes River Floodplain] (Booth et al., San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science, Volume 4, Issue 2, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; or '''rolling mean''' and is a type of [[finite impulse response]] filter. Variations include: [[#Simple moving average|simple]], and [[#Cumulative moving average|cumulative]], or [[#Weighted moving average|weighted]] forms (described below).

Given a series of numbers and a fixed subset size, the first element of the moving average is obtained by taking the average of the initial fixed subset of the number series. Then the subset is modified by "shifting forward"; that is, excluding the first number of the series and including the next value in the subset.

A moving average is commonly used with [[time series]] data to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends or cycles.  The threshold between short-term and long-term depends on the application, and the parameters of the moving average will be set accordingly.  For example, it is often used in [[technical analysis]] of financial data, like stock [[price]]s, [[return (finance)|returns]] or trading volumes.  It is also used in [[economics]] to examine gross domestic product, employment or other macroeconomic time series.  Mathematically, a moving average is a type of [[convolution]] and so it can be viewed as an example of a [[low-pass filter]] used in [[signal processing]].  When used with non-time series data, a moving average filters higher frequency components without any specific connection to time, although typically some kind of ordering is implied. Viewed simplistically it can be regarded as smoothing the data.

==Simple moving average==
[[File:Moving Average Types comparison - Simple and Exponential.png|thumb]]
In financial applications a '''simple moving average''' (SMA) is the unweighted [[arithmetic mean|mean]] of the previous ''n'' data. However, in science and engineering, the mean is normally taken from an equal number of data on either side of a central value. This ensures that variations in the mean are aligned with the variations in the data rather than being shifted in time.
{{Anchor|algorithm}}
An example of a simple equally weighted running mean for a n-day sample of closing price is the mean of the previous ''n'' days' closing prices. If those prices are &lt;math&gt;p_M, p_{M-1},\dots,p_{M-(n-1)}&lt;/math&gt; then the formula is
&lt;!--
this used to be a hairy sigma style with i's and j's, but prefer dots since it's a lot easier for financial people with limited math --&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \overline{p}_\text{SM} &amp; = \frac{p_M + p_{M-1} + \cdots + p_{M-(n-1)}}{n}\\
      &amp; = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p_{M-i}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

When calculating successive values, a new value comes into the sum and the oldest value drops out, meaning a full summation each time is unnecessary for this simple case,

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{p}_\text{SM} = \overline{p}_{\text{SM},\text{prev}} + {p_M \over n} - {p_{M-n} \over n}&lt;/math&gt;

The period selected depends on the type of movement of interest, such as short, intermediate, or long-term. In financial terms moving-average levels can be interpreted as [[support (technical analysis)|support]] in a falling market, or [[resistance (technical analysis)|resistance]] in a rising  market.

If the data used are not centered around the mean, a simple moving average lags behind the latest datum point by half the sample width. An SMA can also be disproportionately influenced by old datum points dropping out or new data coming in. One characteristic of the SMA is that if the data have a periodic fluctuation, then applying an SMA of that period will eliminate that variation (the average always containing one complete cycle). But a perfectly regular cycle is rarely encountered.&lt;ref&gt;''Statistical Analysis'', Ya-lun Chou, Holt International, 1975, {{ISBN|0-03-089422-0}}, section 17.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a number of applications, it is advantageous to avoid the shifting induced by using only 'past' data. Hence a '''central moving average''' can be computed, using data equally spaced on either side of the point in the series where the mean is calculated.&lt;ref&gt;The derivation and properties of the simple central moving average are given in full at [[Savitzky–Golay filter]]&lt;/ref&gt; This requires using an odd number of datum points in the sample window.

A major drawback of the SMA is that it lets through a significant amount of the signal shorter than the window length. Worse, it ''actually inverts it''. This can lead to unexpected artifacts, such as peaks in the smoothed result appearing where there were troughs in the data. It also leads to the result being less smooth than expected since some of the higher frequencies are not properly removed.

==Cumulative moving average==
In a '''cumulative moving average''', the data arrive in an ordered datum stream, and the user would like to get the average of all of the data up until the current datum point. For example, an investor may want the average price of all of the stock transactions for a particular stock up until the current time. As each new transaction occurs, the average price at the time of the transaction can be calculated for all of the transactions up to that point using the cumulative average, typically an equally weighted [[average]] of the sequence of ''n'' values &lt;math&gt;x_1. \ldots, x_n&lt;/math&gt; up to the current time:

:&lt;math&gt;\textit{CMA}_n = {{x_1 + \cdots + x_n} \over n}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The brute-force method to calculate this would be to store all of the data and calculate the sum and divide by the number of datum points every time a new datum point arrived. However, it is possible to simply update cumulative average as a new value, &lt;math&gt;x_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; becomes available, using the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\textit{CMA}_{n+1} = {{x_{n+1} + n \cdot \textit{CMA}_n} \over {n+1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the current cumulative average for a new datum point is equal to the previous cumulative average, times ''n'', plus the latest datum point, all divided by the number of points received so far, ''n''+1. When all of the datum points arrive ({{nowrap|1=''n'' = ''N''}}), then the cumulative average will equal the final average. It is also possible to store a running total of the datum point as well as the number of points and dividing the total by the number of datum points to get the CMA each time a new datum point arrives.

The derivation of the cumulative average formula is straightforward. Using

:&lt;math&gt;x_1 + \cdots + x_n = n \cdot \textit{CMA}_n&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}}, it is seen that

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
x_{n+1} &amp; = (x_1 + \cdots + x_{n+1}) - (x_1 + \cdots + x_n) \\[6pt]

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Solving this equation for &lt;math&gt;\textit{CMA}_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; results in

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\textit{CMA}_{n+1} &amp; = {x_{n+1} + n \cdot \textit{CMA}_n \over {n+1}} \\[6pt]
&amp; = {x_{n+1} + (n + 1 - 1) \cdot \textit{CMA}_n \over {n+1}} \\[6pt]
&amp; = {(n + 1) \cdot \textit{CMA}_n + x_{n+1} - \textit{CMA}_n \over {n+1}} \\[6pt]
&amp; = {\textit{CMA}_n} + {{x_{n+1} - \textit{CMA}_n} \over {n+1}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Weighted moving average==
A weighted average is an average that has multiplying factors to give different weights to data at different positions in the sample window. Mathematically, the moving average is the [[convolution]] of the datum points with a fixed weighting function. One application is removing [[pixelisation]] from a digital graphical image.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In [[technical analysis]] of financial data, a '''weighted moving average''' (WMA) has the specific meaning of weights that decrease in arithmetical progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weighted Moving Averages: The Basics |url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/060401.asp |publisher=Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an ''n''-day WMA the latest day has weight ''n'', the second latest ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, etc., down to one.

:&lt;math&gt;\text{WMA}_{M} = { n p_{M} + (n-1) p_{M-1} + \cdots + 2 p_{(M-n+2)} + p_{(M-n+1)} \over n + (n-1) + \cdots + 2 + 1}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Weighted moving average weights N=15.png|thumb|right|WMA weights ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;15]]

The denominator is a [[triangle number]] equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}.&lt;/math&gt; In the more general case the denominator will always be the sum of the individual weights.

When calculating the WMA across successive values, the difference between the numerators of WMA&lt;sub&gt;''M''+1&lt;/sub&gt; and WMA&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is ''np''&lt;sub&gt;''M''+1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;⋅⋅⋅&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''M''−n+1&lt;/sub&gt;. If we denote the sum ''p''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;⋅⋅⋅&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''M''−''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; by Total&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      \text{Total}_{M+1} &amp;= \text{Total}_M + p_{M+1} - p_{M-n+1} \\[3pt]
  \text{Numerator}_{M+1} &amp;= \text{Numerator}_M + n p_{M+1} - \text{Total}_M \\[3pt]
        \text{WMA}_{M+1} &amp;= { \text{Numerator}_{M+1} \over n + (n-1) + \cdots + 2 + 1}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The graph at the right shows how the weights decrease, from highest weight for the most recent datum points, down to zero.  It can be compared to the weights in the exponential moving average which follows.

{{further|EWMA chart|Exponential smoothing}}
[[Image:Exponential moving average weights N=15.png|thumb|right|EMA weights&amp;nbsp;''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;15]]

An '''exponential moving average (EMA)''', also known as an '''exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA)''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lorien.ncl.ac.uk/ming/filter/filewma.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329135531/http://lorien.ncl.ac.uk/ming/filter/filewma.htm |archivedate=2010-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a first-order [[infinite impulse response]] filter that applies weighting factors which decrease [[Exponential_decay|exponentially]]. The weighting for each older [[data|datum]] decreases exponentially, never reaching zero. The graph at right shows an example of the weight decrease.

The EMA for a series ''Y'' may be calculated recursively:

:&lt;math&gt; S_t = \begin{cases}
 Y_1,                                           &amp; t = 1 \\
 \alpha \cdot Y_t + (1 - \alpha) \cdot S_{t-1}, &amp; t &gt; 1
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* The coefficient ''α'' represents the degree of weighting decrease, a constant smoothing factor between 0 and 1. A higher ''α'' discounts older observations faster.
* ''Y&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the value at a time period ''t''.
* ''S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the value of the EMA at any time period ''t''.

''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; may be initialized in a number of different ways, most commonly by setting ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; as shown above, though other techniques exist, such as setting ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to an average of the first 4 or 5 observations. The importance of the ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; initialisations effect on the resultant moving average depends on ''α''; smaller ''α'' values make the choice of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; relatively more important than larger ''α'' values, since a higher ''α'' discounts older observations faster.

Whatever is done for ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; it assumes something about values prior to the available data and is necessarily in error. In view of this, the early results should be regarded as unreliable until the iterations have had time to [[Convergent series|converge]]. This is sometimes called a 'spin-up' interval. One way to assess when it can be regarded as reliable is to consider the required accuracy of the result. For example, if 3% accuracy is required, initialising with ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and taking data after five time constants (defined above) will ensure that the calculation has converged to within 3% (only &lt;3% of ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; will remain in the result ). Sometimes with very small alpha, this can mean little of the result is useful. This is analogous to the problem of using a convolution filter (such as a weighted average) with a very long window.

This formulation is according to Hunter (1986).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section4/pmc431.htm NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods: Single Exponential Smoothing] at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]&lt;/ref&gt; By repeated application of this formula for different times, we can eventually write ''S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' as a weighted sum of the datum points ''Y&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'', as:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  S_t = \alpha &amp;\left[Y_{t-1} + (1 - \alpha) Y_{t-2} + (1 - \alpha)^2 Y_{t-3} + \cdots \right. \\[6pt]
        &amp; \left. \cdots + (1 - \alpha)^k Y_{t-(k+1)}\right] + (1 - \alpha)^{k+1} S_{t-(k+1)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for any suitable ''k'' &amp;isin; {0, 1, 2, …} The weight of the general datum point &lt;math&gt;Y_{t-i}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\alpha\left(1 - \alpha\right)^{i-1} &lt;/math&gt;.

An alternate approach by Roberts (1959) uses ''Y&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' in lieu of ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''t''−1&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section3/pmc324.htm NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods: EWMA Control Charts] at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_{t,\text{ alternate}} = \alpha \cdot Y_t + (1 - \alpha) \cdot S_{t-1}&lt;/math&gt;

This formula can also be expressed in technical analysis terms as follows, showing how the EMA steps towards the latest datum point, but only by a proportion of the difference (each time):
:&lt;math&gt;\text{EMA}_\text{today} = \text{EMA}_\text{yesterday} + \alpha \left[\text{price}_\text{today} - \text{EMA}_\text{yesterday}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding out &lt;math&gt;\text{EMA}_\text{yesterday}&lt;/math&gt; each time results in the following power series, showing how the weighting factor on each datum point ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, etc., decreases exponentially:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{EMA}_\text{today} = { \alpha \left[p_1 + (1 - \alpha) p_2 + (1 - \alpha)^2 p_3 + (1 - \alpha)^3 p_4 + \cdots \right] }&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\text{price}_\text{today}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\text{price}_\text{yesterday}&lt;/math&gt;
* and so on

: &lt;math&gt;\text{EMA}_\text{today} = \frac{p_1 + (1 - \alpha) p_2 + (1 - \alpha)^2 p_3 + (1 - \alpha)^3 p_4 + \cdots}{1 + (1 - \alpha) + (1 - \alpha)^2 + (1 - \alpha)^3 + \cdots}, &lt;/math&gt;

since &lt;math&gt;1/\alpha = 1 + (1 - \alpha) + (1 - \alpha)^2 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;.

It can also be calculated recursively without introducing the error when initializing the first estimate (n starts from 1):
: &lt;math&gt;\text{EMA}_n = \frac{\text{WeightedSum}_n}{\text{WeightedCount}_n}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\text{WeightedSum}_n = p_n + (1 - \alpha)\text{WeightedSum}_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\text{WeightedCount}_n = 1 + (1 - \alpha)\text{WeightedCount}_{n-1} = \frac{1 - (1 -
 \alpha)^n}{1 - (1 - \alpha)}&lt;/math&gt;
: Assume &lt;math&gt;\text{WeightedSum}_0 = \text{WeightedCount}_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

This is an [[series (mathematics)|infinite sum]] with decreasing terms.

=== Approximating the EMA with a limited number of terms ===

The question of how far back to go for an initial value depends, in the worst case, on the data.  Large price values in old data will affect the total even if their weighting is very small.  If prices have small variations then just the weighting can be considered.
The [[power series|power formula]] above gives a starting value for a particular day, after which the successive days formula shown first can be applied.  The weight omitted by stopping after ''k'' terms is

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \left[ (1 - \alpha)^k + (1 - \alpha)^{k+1} + (1 - \alpha)^{k+2} + \cdots \right],&lt;/math&gt;

which is

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha (1 - \alpha)^k \left[1 + (1 - \alpha) + (1 - \alpha)^2 + \cdots \right],&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. a fraction

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       &amp; \frac{\text{weight omitted by stopping after } k \text{ terms}}{\text{total weight}} \\[6pt]
  = {} &amp; \frac{\alpha \left[ (1 - \alpha)^k + (1 - \alpha)^{k+1} + (1 - \alpha)^{k+2} + \cdots \right] }
              {\alpha \left[ 1 + (1 - \alpha) + (1 - \alpha)^2 + \cdots \right]} \\[6pt]
  = {} &amp; \frac{\alpha (1 - \alpha)^k \frac 1 {1 - (1 - \alpha)}}{ \frac{\alpha}{1 - (1 - \alpha)} } \\[6pt]
  = {} &amp; (1 - \alpha)^k
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt; The [[Taylor Series#Maclaurin Series|Maclaurin Series]] for
 &lt;math&gt;  1 / (1-x) &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;1 + x + x^2 + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

out of the total weight.

For example, to have 99.9% of the weight, set above ratio equal to 0.1% and solve for ''k'':

:&lt;math&gt;k = {\log(0.001) \over \log(1 - \alpha)}&lt;/math&gt;

to determine how many terms should be used. Since &lt;math&gt;\alpha \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;N \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;, we know &lt;math&gt;\log\,(1-\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;-\alpha&lt;/math&gt; as N increases
&lt;ref&gt;It means &lt;math&gt;\alpha \to 0&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[Taylor series]] of &lt;math&gt;\log(1 - \alpha) = -\alpha - \alpha^2/2 - \cdots&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;-\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. This gives:

:&lt;math&gt;k \approx {\log(0.001) \over {- \alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is related to N via to &lt;math&gt;\alpha = {2 \over N+1}&lt;/math&gt;,
this simplifies to approximately&lt;ref&gt;log&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;(0.001) / 2 = −3.45&lt;/ref&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;k \approx 3.45(N + 1) \,&lt;/math&gt;

for this example (99.9% weight).

===Relationship between SMA and EMA===

Note that there is no "accepted" value that should be chosen for &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; although there are some recommended values based on the application. A commonly used value for &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is  &lt;math&gt; \alpha = 2 / (N + 1) &lt;/math&gt;. This is because the weights of an SMA and EMA have the same "center of mass" when &lt;math&gt; \alpha_{\mathrm{RMA}} = 2 / \left(N_{\mathrm{SMA}} + 1\right) &lt;/math&gt;.

{{hidden begin|ta1=center|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;padding:2px 2px 2px 2px;|border=1px #aaa solid|title=[Proof]}}
The weights of an &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-day SMA have a "center of mass" on the &lt;math&gt;R^{\mathrm{th}}&lt;/math&gt; day, where
 &lt;math&gt;R = \frac{N + 1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
(or &lt;math&gt;R = \left(N-1\right) / 2&lt;/math&gt;, if we use zero-based indexing)

For the remainder of this proof we will use one-based indexing.


Now meanwhile, the weights of an EMA have center of mass
 &lt;math&gt;R_{\mathrm{EMA}} = \alpha  \left[1 + 2 * (1-\alpha) + 3 * (1-\alpha)^2 + ... + k * (1-\alpha)^{k-1}\right]&lt;/math&gt;                  
That is,
 &lt;math&gt; R_{\mathrm{EMA}} = \alpha \sum_{k=1}^{k=\infty} \!  \, k * \left(1-\alpha\right)^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
We also know the Maclaurin Series
 &lt;math&gt;  1 / (1-x) =    \sum_{k=0}^{k=\infty} \! \, x^k &lt;/math&gt;                                       
Taking derivatives of both sides with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; gives:                                                                 
      &lt;math&gt;(x-1)^{-2}  = \sum_{k=0}^{k=\infty} \! \, k * x^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;                                                                
or                                                                                                                                     
      &lt;math&gt;(x-1)^{-2}  = 0 + \sum_{k=1}^{k=\infty} \! \, k * x^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;                                                            
                                                                                                                                         
Substituting &lt;math&gt;x = 1 - \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, we get
 &lt;math&gt; R_{\mathrm{EMA}} = \alpha \left(\alpha\right)^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;
or                                                                                               
 &lt;math&gt; R_{\mathrm{EMA}} = \left(\alpha\right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
                                                     
So the value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; that sets &lt;math&gt;R_{\mathrm{SMA}} = R_{\mathrm{RMA}}&lt;/math&gt; is, in fact: 
 &lt;math&gt;\frac{N_{\mathrm{SMA}} + 1}{2} = \left( \alpha_{\mathrm{EMA}} \right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
or            
 &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{N_{\mathrm{SMA}} + 1} = \alpha_{\mathrm{EMA}}&lt;/math&gt;   

And so &lt;math&gt;2 / \left(N + 1\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; that creates an EMA whose weights have the same center of gravity as would the equivalent N-day SMA
{{hidden end}}


This is also why sometimes an EMA is referred to as an ''N''-day EMA. Despite the name suggesting there are ''N'' periods, the terminology only specifies the ''α'' factor. ''N'' is not a stopping point for the calculation in the way it is in an [[#Simple moving average|SMA]] or [[#Weighted moving average|WMA]]. For sufficiently large ''N'', the first ''N'' datum points in an EMA represent about 86% of the total weight in the calculation when &lt;math&gt; \alpha = 2 / (N + 1) &lt;/math&gt;:


{{hidden begin|ta1=center|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;padding:2px 2px 2px 2px;|border=1px #aaa solid|title=[Proof]}}

The sum of the weights of all the terms (i.e., infinite number of terms) in an exponential moving average is 1.  The sum of the weights of &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; terms is &lt;math&gt; 1 - (1 - \alpha)^{N+1} &lt;/math&gt;. Both of these sums can be derived by using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.  The weight omitted after &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; terms is given by subtracting this from 1, and you get &lt;math&gt; 1 - \left[1 - (1 - \alpha)^{N+1}\right] = (1 - \alpha)^{N+1} &lt;/math&gt; (this is essentially the formula given previously for the weight omitted). 

We now substitute the commonly used value for &lt;math&gt; \alpha = 2 / (N + 1) &lt;/math&gt; in the formula for the weight of &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; terms. If you make this substitution, and you make use of&lt;ref&gt;See the following [http://options-trading-notes.blogspot.com/2013/06/derivation-of-ea.html link] for a proof.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(  1 + {a \over n} \right)^n = e^a &lt;/math&gt;, then you get

:&lt;math&gt;\frac
  {\alpha \left[1 + (1 - \alpha) + (1 - \alpha)^2 + \cdots + (1 - \alpha)^N \right]}
  {\alpha \left[1 + (1 - \alpha) + (1 - \alpha)^2 + \cdots\right])}
 = 1 - {\left(1 - {2 \over N + 1}\right)}^{N+1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The denominator on the left-hand side should be unity, and the numerator will become the right-hand side ([[geometric progression#Geometric series|geometric series]]), &lt;math&gt;\alpha \left[{1 - (1 - \alpha)^{N+1} \over 1 - (1 - \alpha)}\right]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

:i.e. &lt;math&gt; \lim_{N \to \infty} \left[1 - {\left(1 - {2 \over N+1}\right)}^{N+1} \right] &lt;/math&gt; simplified,&lt;ref&gt;Because (1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x''/''n'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; tends to the limit e&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; for large ''n''.&lt;/ref&gt; tends to &lt;math&gt;1 - e^{-2} \approx 0.8647&lt;/math&gt;.

the 0.8647 approximation.  Intuitively, what this is telling us is that the weight after &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; terms of an ``&lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt;-period" exponential moving average converges to 0.8647.
{{hidden end}}

The designation of &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 2 / \left(N + 1\right)&lt;/math&gt; it not a requirement. It is a common convention to form an intuitive understanding of the relationship between EMAs and SMAs, when both are used together on datasets. An EMA with any value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; can be used, and  can either be named by stating the value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, or used with the more familiar ''N''-day EMA terminology and let &lt;math&gt;N =\left( 2 / \alpha \right) - 1&lt;/math&gt;.

===Exponentially weighted moving variance and standard deviation===
In addition to the mean, we may also be interested in the [[variance]] and in the [[standard deviation]] to evaluate the [[statistical significance]] of a deviation from the mean.

EWMVar can be computed easily along with the moving average.
The starting values are &lt;math&gt;\text{EMA}_1 = x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{EMVar}_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;,
and we then compute the subsequent values using:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Finch|first1=Tony|title=Incremental calculation of weighted mean and variance|url=http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/fanf2/hermes/doc/antiforgery/stats.pdf|website=University of Cambridge|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\delta &amp;= x_i - \text{EMA}_{i-1}
\\
\text{EMA}_i &amp;= \text{EMA}_{i-1} + \alpha \cdot \delta
\\
\text{EMVar}_i &amp;= \left(1-\alpha\right)\cdot\left(\text{EMVar}_{i-1} + \alpha \cdot \delta^2\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

From this, the exponentially weighted moving standard deviation can be computed as &lt;math&gt;\text{EWSD}_i=\sqrt{\text{EMVar}_i}&lt;/math&gt;.
We can then use the [[standard score]] to normalize data with respect to the moving average and variance.
This algorithm is based on [[Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Online algorithm|Welford's algorithm for computing the variance]].

===Modified moving average===
A '''modified moving average''' (MMA), '''running moving average''' (RMA), or '''smoothed moving average''' (SMMA) is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{p}_{MM,\text{today}} = \frac{(N - 1) \overline{p}_{MM,\text{yesterday}} + p_{\text{today}}}{N}&lt;/math&gt;

In short, this is an exponential moving average, with &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 1/N&lt;/math&gt;.

===Application to measuring computer performance===
Some computer performance metrics, e.g. the average process queue length, or the average CPU utilization, use a form of exponential moving average.

:&lt;math&gt;S_n = \alpha(t_n - t_{n-1}) Y_n + \left[1 - \alpha(t_n - t_{n-1})\right] S_{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here {{mvar|&amp;alpha;}} is defined as a function of time between two readings. An example of a coefficient giving bigger weight to the current reading, and smaller weight to the older readings is

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha(t_n - t_{n-1}) = 1 - \exp\left({-\frac{t_n - t_{n-1}}{W \cdot 60}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|exp()}} is the [[exponential function]], time for readings ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is expressed in seconds, and {{mvar|W}} is the period of time in minutes over which the reading is said to be averaged (the mean lifetime of each reading in the average). Given the above definition of {{mvar|&amp;alpha;}}, the moving average can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;S_n = \left[1 - \exp\left(-{ {t_n - t_{n-1}} \over {W \cdot 60}}\right)\right] Y_n +
\exp\left(-{{t_n - t_{n-1}} \over {W \cdot 60}}\right) S_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, a 15-minute average ''L'' of a process queue length ''Q'', measured every 5 seconds (time difference is 5 seconds), is computed as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  L_n &amp;= \left[1 - \exp\left({-\frac{5}{15 \cdot 60}}\right)\right] Q_n + e^{-\frac{5}{15 \cdot 60}} L_{n-1} \\[6pt]
      &amp;= \left[1 - \exp\left({-\frac{1}{180}}\right)\right] Q_n + e^{-\frac{1}{180}} L_{n-1} \\[6pt]
      &amp;= Q_n + e^{-\frac{1}{180}} \left( L_{n-1} - Q_n \right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Other weightings==
Other weighting systems are used occasionally – for example, in share trading a '''volume weighting''' will weight each time period in proportion to its trading volume.

A further weighting, used by actuaries, is Spencer's 15-Point Moving Average&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Spencers15-PointMovingAverage.html Spencer's 15-Point Moving Average — from Wolfram MathWorld&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (a central moving average). The symmetric weight coefficients are −3, −6, −5, 3, 21, 46, 67, 74, 67, 46, 21, 3, −5, −6, −3.

Outside the world of finance, weighted running means have many forms and applications. Each weighting function or "kernel" has its own characteristics. In engineering and science the frequency and phase response of the filter is often of primary importance in understanding the desired and undesired distortions that a particular filter will apply to the data.

A mean does not just "smooth" the data. A mean is a form of low-pass filter. The effects of the particular filter used should be understood in order to make an appropriate choice. On this point,
the French version of this article discusses the spectral effects of 3 kinds of means (cumulative, exponential, Gaussian).

==Moving median==
From a statistical point of view, the moving average, when used to estimate the underlying trend in a time series, is susceptible to rare events such as rapid shocks or other anomalies. A more robust estimate of the trend is the '''simple moving median''' over ''n'' time points:

:&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{p}_\text{SM} = \text{Median}( p_M, p_{M-1}, \ldots, p_{M-n+1} )&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[median]] is found by, for example, sorting the values inside the brackets and finding the value in the middle.  For larger values of ''n'', the median can be efficiently computed by updating an [[Skip list#Indexable skiplist|indexable skiplist]].&lt;ref&gt;http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576930/&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistically, the moving average is optimal for recovering the underlying trend of the time series when the fluctuations about the trend are [[normal distribution|normally distributed]]. However, the normal distribution does not place high probability on very large deviations from the trend which explains why such deviations will have a disproportionately large effect on the trend estimate. It can be shown that if the fluctuations are instead assumed to be [[Laplace distribution|Laplace distributed]], then the moving median is statistically optimal.&lt;ref&gt;G.R. Arce, "Nonlinear Signal Processing: A Statistical Approach", Wiley:New Jersey, USA, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; For a given variance, the Laplace distribution places higher probability on rare events than does the normal, which explains why the moving median tolerates shocks better than the moving mean.

When the simple moving median above is central, the smoothing is identical to the [[median filter]] which has applications in, for example, image signal processing.

==Moving average regression model==
{{Main|Moving-average model}}In a [[Moving average model|moving average regression model]], a variable of interest is assumed to be a weighted moving average of unobserved independent error terms; the weights in the moving average are parameters to be estimated.

Those two concepts are often confused due to their name, but while they share many similarities, they represent distinct methods and are used in very different contexts.

The '''National Physical Laboratory of India''', situated in [[New Delhi]], is the [[measurement standards laboratory]] of India. It maintains standards of [[SI units]] in India and calibrates the national standards of weights and measures.

== History of measurement systems in India ==

{{main|History of measurement systems in India}}

One of the most ancient texts of India, ''Manusmriti'', describes among the duties of the king: ''The king should examine the weights and balances every six months to ensure true measurements and to mark them with the royal stamp.'' -- ''Manusmriti'', 8th Chapter, [[Shlokas|Shloka]] 403. In the [[Harappa]]n era, which is nearly 5000 years old, one finds excellent examples of town planning and architecture. The sizes of the bricks were the same all over the region. In the time of [[Chandragupta Maurya]], some 2400 years ago, there was a well - defined system of weights and measures. The [[government]] of that time ensured that everybody used the same system. In the Indian medical system, [[Ayurveda]], the units of mass and volume were well defined.

The measurement system during the time of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor, [[Akbar]], the ''guz''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-09-23|title=Guz|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Guz&amp;oldid=740810309|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the measure of length. The ''guz'' was widely used till the introduction of the metric system in [[India]] in 1956. During the [[British Raj|British period]], efforts were made to achieve uniformity in weights and measures. A compromise was reached in the system of measurements which continued till India's independence in 1947. After independence in 1947, it was realized that for fast industrial growth of the country, it would be necessary to establish a modern measurement system in the country. The [[Lok Sabha]] in April 1955 resolved : ''This house is of the opinion that the [[Government of India]] should take necessary steps to introduce uniform weights and measures throughout the country based on [[metric system]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Indian units of measurement]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}

== History of the National Physical Laboratory, India ==
The National Physical Laboratory, India was set up in 1900) is one of the earliest national laboratories set up under the [[Council of Scientific &amp; Industrial Research]]. [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] laid the foundation stone of NPL on 4 January 1947. Dr. [[K. S. Krishnan]] was the first Director of the laboratory. The main building of the laboratory was formally opened by Former [[Deputy Prime Minister of India|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 21 January 1950. Former [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]], inaugurated the Silver Jubilee Celebration of the Laboratory on 23 December 1975.

NPL Charter:-

The main aim of the laboratory is to strengthen and advance physics-based research and development for the overall development of science and technology in the country. In particular its objectives are:

To establish, maintain and improve continuously by research, for the benefit of the nation, National Standards of Measurements and to realize the Units based on International System (Under the subordinate Legislations of Weights and Measures Act 1956, reissued in 1988 under the 1976 Act). 
To identify and conduct after due consideration, research in areas of physics which are most appropriate to the needsof the nation and for advancement of field

To assist industries, national and other agencies in their developmental tasks by precision measurements, calibration, development of devices, processes, and other allied problems related to physics.

To keep itself informed of and study critically the status of physics.

== Maintenance of standards of measurements in India ==
Each modernized country, including [[India]] has a National Metrological Institute (NMI), which maintains the standards of measurements. This responsibility has been given to the National Physical Laboratory, [[New Delhi]].

=== Metre ===
The standard unit of [[length]], [[metre]], is realized by employing a stabilized [[Helium]] - [[Neon]] [[laser]] as a source of light. Its frequency is measured experimentally. From this value of frequency and the internationally accepted value of the [[speed of light]] (299,792,458 metres/second), the wavelength is determined using the relation:

&lt;center&gt;Wavelength = Velocity of light / frequency&lt;/center&gt;

The nominal value of wavelength, employed at NPL is 633 nanometer. By a sophisticated instrument, known as an optical interferometer, any length can be measured in terms of the wavelength of laser light.

The present level of [[uncertainty]] attained at NPL in length measurements is '''± 3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;'''. However in most measurements, an uncertainty of '''± 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;''' is adequate.

=== Kilogramme ===
The Indian national standard of [[mass]], [[kilogramme]], is copy number 57 of the international prototype kilogram supplied by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM : French - Bureau International des Poids et Mesures), [[Paris]]. This is a [[Platinum]] [[Iridium]] cylinder whose mass is measured against the international prototype at BIPM. The NPL also maintains a group of transfer standard kilograms made of non - magnetic [[stainless steel]] and [[nickel]] - [[chromium]] alloy.

The uncertainty in mass measurements at NPL is '''± 4.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;'''.

=== Second ===
The national standard of [[time]] interval, [[second]] as well as [[frequency]], is maintained through four parameters, which can be measured most accurately. Therefore, attempts are made to link other physical quantities to time and frequency. The standard maintained at NPL has to be linked to different users. This process, known as dissemination, is carried out in a number of ways. For applications requiring low levels of uncertainty, there is satellite based dissemination service, which utilizes the Indian national satellite, [[INSAT]]. Time is also disseminated through [[TV]], [[radio]], and special [[telephone]] services. The [[caesium]] [[atomic clock]]s maintained at NPL are linked to other such instituted all over the world through a set of [[Global Positioning System|global positioning satellites]].

=== Ampere ===
The unit of electric current, [[ampere]], is realized at NPL by measuring [[volt]] and [[Ohm (unit)|Ohm]] separately.

The uncertainty in measurement of ampere is '''± 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;'''.

=== Kelvin ===
The standard of [[temperature]] is based on the [[International Temperature Scale of 1990]] (ITS-90). This is based on the assigned temperatures to several fixed points. One of the most fundamental temperatures of these is the triple point of water. At this temperature, ice, water and steam are at equilibrium with each other. This temperature has been assigned the value of 273.16 [[kelvin]]s. This temperature can be realized, maintained and measured in the laboratory. At present temperature standards maintained at NPL cover a range of 54 to 2,473 kelvins.

The uncertainty in its measure is '''± 2.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;'''.

=== Candela ===
The unit of [[luminous intensity]], [[candela]], is realized by using an absolute radiometer. For practical work, a group of tungsten incandescent lamps are used.

The level of uncertainty is '''± 1.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;'''.

=== Mole ===
Experimental work has been initiated to realize [[mole (unit)|mole]], the SI unit for amount of substance

=== Radiation ===
The NPL does not maintain standards of measurements for ionizing [[radiation]]s. This is the responsibility of the [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre|Homi Bhabha Atomic Research Centre]], [[Mumbai]].

== Calibrator of weights and measures ==
The standards maintained at NPL are periodically compared with standards maintained at other National Metrological Institutes in the world as well as the [[BIPM]] in [[Paris]]. This exercise ensures that Indian national standards are equivalent to those of the rest of the world.

Any measurement made in a country should be directly or indirectly linked to the national standards of the country, For this purpose, a chain of laboratories are set up in different [[States and territories of India|states]] of the country. The weights and measures used in daily life are tested in the laboratories and certified. It is the responsibility of the NPL to calibrate the measurement standards in these laboratories at different levels. In this manner, the measurements made in any part of the country are linked to the national standards and through them to the international standards.

The weights and balances used in local markets and other areas are expected to be certified by the Department of Weights and Measures of the local government. Working standards of these local departments should, in turn, be calibrated against the state level standards or any other laboratory which is entitled to do so. The state level laboratories are required to get their standards calibrated from the NPL at the national level which is equivalent to the international standards.


== Bharatiya Nirdeshak Dravya (BND) or Indian Reference Materials ==

Bharatiya Nirdeshak Dravya (BND) or Indian reference materials are reference materials developed by NPL which derive their traceability from National Standards.

== Research ==
NPL is also involved in research. One of the important research activities undertaken by NPL is to devise the chemical formula for the indelible ink which is being used in the [[Elections in India|Indian elections]] to prevent fraudulent voting. This ink, manufactured by the [[Mysore Paints and Varnish Limited]] is applied on the finger nail of the voter as an indicator that the voter has already cast his vote.

NPL also have section working on development of [[biosensors]]. Currently the Biomedical Instrumentation section is headed by Dr. R. K. Kotnala and section is primarily focusing on development of sensor for [[cholesterol]],  measurement and microfluidic based biosensors. Section is also developing biosensors for [[Uric acid]] detection.

NPL has developed [[Hydroelectric Cell]], which is form of [[galvanic cell]]. The novelty of this work lies in the generation of electrical energy by water molecule dissociation using lithium substituted magnesium ferrite at room temperature. Porous magnesium ferrite has been explored extensively for its water molecule sensing properties via chemidissociation of water molecule. More about this can be checked from NPL website.

== NPL's Contributions ==

=== The Indelible Mark/Ink ===

During general election, nearly 40 million people wear a CSIR mark on their fingers. The Indelible ink used to mark the fingernail of a Voter during general elections is a time-tested gift of CSIR to the spirit of democracy. Developed in 1952, it was first produced in-campus. Subsequently industry has been manufacturing the Ink. It is also exported to Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Turkey and other democracies.

=== Pristine Air-Quality Monitoring Station at Palampur ===

National Physical Laboratory (NPL) has established an atmospheric monitoring station in the campus of Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (IHBT) at Palampur (H.P.) at an altitude of 1391 m for generating the base data for atmospheric trace species &amp; properties to serve as reference for comparison of polluted atmosphere in India. At this station, NPL has installed state of art air monitoring system, greenhouse gas measurement system and Raman Lidar. A number of parameters like CO, NO, NO2, NH3, SO2, O3, PM, HC &amp; BC besides CO2 &amp; CH4 are being currently monitored at this station which is also equipped with weather station (AWS) for measurement of weather parameters.&lt;ref&gt;http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=159487&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.mygov.in/csir-npl-launches-indias-first-pristine-air-quality-monitoring-station-at-palampur/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gold Standard (BND-4201) ===

The BND-4201 is first Indian reference material for gold of ‘9999’ fineness (gold that is 99.99% pure with impurities of only 100 parts-per-million).

The '''National Urban League''' ('''NUL'''), formerly known as the '''National League on Urban Conditions Among Negroes''', is a nonpartisan [[civil rights]] organization based in New York City that advocates on behalf of [[African American]]s and against [[racial discrimination in the United States]]. It is the oldest and largest [[community-based organization]] of its kind in the nation. Its current President is [[Marc Morial]].

==History==

The Committee on Urban Conditions Among Negroes was founded in New York City on September 29, 1910 by [[Ruth Standish Baldwin]] and Dr. [[George Edmund Haynes]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Parris, Guichard and Lester Brooks. ''Blacks in the City: A History of the National Urban League''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company. 1971. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  It merged with the Committee for the Improvement of Industrial Conditions Among Negroes in New York (founded in New York in 1906) and the National League for the Protection of Colored Women (founded in 1905), and was renamed the National League on Urban Conditions Among Negroes.&lt;ref&gt;Dodson, N. "NEW CHAPTER IN SOCIAL UPLIFT." Afro-American (1893-1988): 2. Dec 30 1911. ProQuest. Web. 6 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parris, Guichard and Lester Brooks. ''Blacks in the City: A History of the National Urban League''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company. 1971. pp. 32-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, [[Eugene Kinckle Jones|Eugene K. Jones]] took the leadership of the organization. Under his direction, the League significantly expanded its multifaceted campaign to crack the barriers to black employment, spurred first by the boom years of the 1920s, and then by the desperate years of the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Armfield, Felix L. ''Eugene Kinckle Jones: The National Urban League and Black Social Work, 1910-1940''. Urbana : University of Illinois Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, the organization took the present name, the National Urban League.&lt;ref&gt;Parris, Guichard and Lester Brooks. ''Blacks in the City: A History of the National Urban League''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company. 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;   The mission of the Urban League movement, as stated by the National Urban League, is "to enable African Americans to secure economic self-reliance, parity, power and civil rights."&lt;ref name="nul"&gt;"[http://nul.iamempowered.com/who-we-are/mission-and-history Mission and History]." ''National Urban League''. Accessed 6 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, [[Lester Granger]] was appointed Executive Secretary and led the NUL's effort to support the March on Washington proposed by [[A. Philip Randolph]], [[Bayard Rustin]] and [[A. J. Muste]] to protest racial discrimination in defense work and the military.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Jesse. "Urban League Bulletin." The Atlanta Constitution (1881-1945): 1. Jan 25 1942. ProQuest. Web. 6 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Civil Rights Movement]], Granger prevailed in his insistence that the NUL continue its strategy of "education and persuasion".

In 1961, [[Whitney Young]] became executive director amidst the expansion of activism in the civil rights movement, which provoked a change for the League. Young substantially expanded the League's fund-raising ability- and made the League a full partner in the civil rights movement. In 1963, the NUL hosted the planning meetings of [[A. Philip Randolph]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and other civil rights leaders for the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]].  During Young's ten-year tenure at the League, he initiated programs such as "Street Academy," an alternative education system to prepare [[high school dropout]]s for college; and "New Thrust," an effort to help local black leaders identify and solve community problems. Young also pushed for federal aid to cities.

[[Clarence M. Pendleton, Jr.]], was from 1975 to 1981, the head of the Urban League in [[San Diego, California]]. In 1981, U.S. President [[Ronald W. Reagan]] tapped Pendleton as the chairman of the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]], a position which he held until his sudden death in 1988. Pendleton sought to steer the commission into the [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] direction in line with Reagan's views on social and civil rights policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uky.edu/Libraries/nkaa/record.php?note_id=1144|title=Notable Kentucky African Americans Database|publisher=uky.edu|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, [[Hugh Bernard Price|Hugh Price]] was appointed as president of the Urban League.

In 2003, [[Marc Morial]], former [[List of mayors of New Orleans|mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana]], was appointed the league's eighth President and Chief Executive Officer. He worked to reenergize the movement's diverse constituencies by building on the legacy of the organization and increasing the profile of the organization.

==Current status==
Today, the National Urban League has 90 affiliates serving 300 communities, in 36 states and the District of Columbia.  The National Urban League provides direct services in the areas of education, health care, housing, jobs, and justice -- improving the lives of more than 2 million people nationwide.  The organization also has a [http://nulwb.iamempowered.com/ Washington Bureau] that serves as its research, policy and advocacy arm on issues relating to Congress and the Administration.

The National Urban League is an organizational member of the [[Coalition to Stop Gun Violence]], which advocates [[gun control]].  In 1989, it was the beneficiary of all proceeds from the [[Stop the Violence Movement]] and their [[hip hop]] single, "Self Destruction".

In May 2017, the National Urban League began producing its now annual [https://tvone.tv/52289/the-national-urban-leagues-state-of-black-america-townhall-how-far-have-we-really-come/ State of Black America TV Town Hall], which airs on TV One. The TV Town Hall elevates social issues related to African Americans through an interview style format with celebrity guests. The show is executive produced by Rhonda Spears Bell.

In February 2018, the National Urban League launched a weekly podcast named, [https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/for-the-movement/id1345148843?mt=2 For The Movement], which discusses persistent policy, social and civil rights issues affecting communities of color. The co-hosts for the podcast are Marc Morial, Donald Cravins, Jr., Kezmiché "Kim" Atterbury, and Jordun Lawrence. The podcast was created and is executive produced by Kezmiché "Kim" Atterbury.

[[File:At the nudist beach.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A group of naturists at a [[nude beach]] in [[Crimea]], 2008]]
'''Naturism''', or '''nudism''', is a [[cultural movement|cultural]] and [[political movement]] practicing, advocating, and defending personal and social [[nudity]], most but not all of which takes place on private property. The term may also refer to a lifestyle based on personal, family, or social nudism.{{sfn|Choin|2002}} Naturism may take a number of forms. It may be practiced individually, within a family, socially, or in public. Additionally, there is also militant naturism, including campaigning, and extreme naturism is sometimes considered a separate category.{{sfn|Descamps|1987}}

== Definition and lexicology ==
The XIV Congress of the [[International Naturist Federation]] ([[Cap d'Agde|Agde]], [[France]], 1974) defined naturism as:

: ''a way of life in [[harmony]] with [[nature]] characterised by the practice of [[#Social_nudism|communal nudity]] with the intention of encouraging [[self-respect]], respect for others and for the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].&lt;ref name="Definition"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Deschênes|first1=Stéphane|title=The Official INF-FNI Definition of Naturism|url=http://www.inf-fni.org/content/download/28259/1110928/file/Official%20INF-FNI%20Definition%20Of%20Naturism.pdf|website=INF-FNI|publisher=International Naturist Federation|accessdate=11 January 2016|format=PDF|date=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''
Several other terms ("social nudity", "[[public nudity]]", "[[skinny dipping]]", "sunning", and "clothes-free") have been proposed as alternative terms for naturism, but none has found the same widespread public acceptance as the older terms "naturism" and (in much of the United States) "nudism".

People interested in social nudity can attend [[nude beach|clothes-free beaches]] and other types of ad-hoc nudist events. At these venues, participants generally need not belong to a [[nudist club]].

Many contemporary naturists and naturist organisations feel that the practice of social nudity should be asexual. For various social, cultural, and historical reasons the lay public, the media, and many contemporary naturists and their organisations often oversimplify the relationship between naturism and sexuality. Current research has begun to explore this complex relationship.{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}

The International Naturist Federation explains:

: '' "Each country has its own kind of naturism, and even each club has its own special character, for we too, human beings, have each our own character which is reflected in our surroundings."''{{sfn|Choin|2002|p=}}{{efn|The Hannover based ''Bund für freies Lebensgestaltung'' wrote "Naturism is a new lifestyle caring for the body, the soul and the spirit in society. We live the ideal of freedom, conscious of its limits, taking up our responsibility. The expression of our will is nudity, our admission of sincerity.}}

The usage and definition of these terms varies geographically and historically.{{efn|In his book, ''Cinema Au Naturel'',{{sfn|Storey|2003|p=11}} author [[Mark Storey]] states "two related terms that we will continually run across are ''nudist'' and ''naturist''. Although, the meanings of the two terms are virtually identical, they often have different connotations for those who prefer one to the other. In America people who believe that it is physically, socially, emotionally, and perhaps spiritually healthy to go about fully nude individually and in groups of mixed sex whenever weather permits and others are not offended generally refer to themselves as "nudists". In Europe such people more often than not refer to themselves as "naturists".}} Though in the United States, naturism and nudism have the same meaning,{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}} in Britain there is a clear distinction.{{efn|The English version of the Agde definition was translated differently in ''Guide Mondial de Naturisme 96 97''.{{sfn|Anon|1997|p=}} ''Naturism (American "nudism") is a way of life in harmony with nature characterised by the practice of communal nudity with the intention of encouraging self-respect, respect for others and the environment.''}}

Nudism is the ''act of being naked'', while naturism is a ''lifestyle'' which at various times embraced nature, environment, respect for others, self-respect, crafts, healthy eating, vegetarianism, teetotalism, non-smoking, yoga, physical exercise and pacifism as well as nudity.{{efn|Ray Connett, Sunny Trails, in Sunbathing for Health Sept 1947 p 8, July 1957 p 14 writes that Naturism is a weasel word that can mean anything}}{{efn|Presently, [[Mark Storey]] is authoring an article detailing historical use of the terms naturism and nudism and how they differ between different cultures, countries, and time periods in history. In a telephone interview by Daniel Johnson on 15 April 2006 with Storey he stated that "a draft of the piece was posted on the "References" page of [[The Naturist Society]] [http://naturistsociety.com/ web site] for a few weeks". At the time of its former release in October 2004 it was titled ''Naturism, Nudism, or Nameless? A History of Terms'' He is planning on publishing a revised article as soon as additional information and errors are corrected.}}

In naturist parlance, ''[[wikt:textile|textile]]'' or ''textilist'' is a non-naturist person, non-naturist behaviour or non-naturist facilities. e.g. ''the textile beach starts at the flag'', ''they are a mixed couple&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; he is naturist, she is textile''.  ''Textile'' is the predominant term used in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] ('textilist' is unknown in British naturist magazines including ''[[H&amp;E naturist]]''), although some naturists avoid it due to perceived negative or derogatory connotations.  ''Textilist'' is said to be used interchangeably, but no dictionary definition to this effect exists, nor are there any equivalent examples of use in mainstream literature such as those for ''textile''.{{sfn|Mars-Jones|1991|p=152}} ''Clothing optional'' and ''nude optional'' (US specific) describe a policy or a venue that allows or encourages nudity but tolerates the wearing of clothes. The opposite is ''clothing compulsory''; that is, prohibiting nudity. Adjectival phrases ''clothes free'' and ''clothing free'' prescribe where naturism is permitted in an otherwise textile environment, or define the preferred state of a naturist.

The social nudity movement includes a large range of variants including "naturism", "nudism", "[[Freikörperkultur]] (FKK)", the "[[nude beach|free beach]] movement" as well as generalized "public lands/[[public nudity]]" advocacy. There is a large amount of shared history and common themes, issues and philosophy, but differences between these separate movements remain contentious.

==Personal and family nudity==
[[File:Carl Larsson Model writing postcards 1906.jpg|thumb|right|Personal nudity: [[Carl Larsson]], ''Model Writing Postcards'', watercolor, 1906]]

{{Main|Nudity#Private nudity}}
Many people are often nude in the privacy of their home or garden, either alone or with members of the family; naturists normally refer to them as at-home-nudists or closet-nudists. This may be occasional nudity or as a naturist lifestyle. There are differences of opinion as to whether, and if so to what extent, parents should appear naked in front of their children, and whether children should be nude within the home in the view of their family as well as visitors. This has attracted a great deal of academic study.

A United States study by [[Alfred Kinsey]] (1948&amp;ndash;1953) found that 75% of the participants stated that there was never nudity in the home when they were growing up, 5% of the participants said that there was "seldom" nudity in the home, 3% said "often", and 17% said that it was "usual". The study found that there was no significant difference between what was reported by men and by women with respect to frequency of nudity in the home.{{sfn|Bancroft|2003|p=}}

&lt;!-- Do not remove these images, Wikipedia is not censored and the current consensus is for this article to have images --&gt;
Gordon and Schroeder in 1995 reported that parental nudity varies considerably from family to family. They say that "there is nothing inherently wrong with bathing with children or otherwise appearing naked in front of them", noting that doing so may provide an opportunity for parents to provide important information. They note that by ages 5 to 6 children begin to develop a sense of modesty, and recommend to parents who wish to be sensitive to their children's wishes that they limit such activities from that age onwards.{{sfn|Gordon &amp; Schroeder|1995|p=16}}

Barbara Bonner in 1999 cautioned against nudity in the home if children exhibit sexual play of a type that is considered problematic.{{sfn|Bonner|2000|p=209-}}

In a 1995 review of the literature, Paul Okami concluded that there was no reliable evidence linking exposure to parental nudity to any negative effect.{{sfn|Okami|1995}} Three years later, his team finished an 18-year longitudinal study that showed that, if anything, such exposure was associated with slight beneficial effects, particularly for boys.{{sfn|Okami et al|1998}}

Smith and Sparks in their study on the effects of social nudity on children conclude that "the viewing of the unclothed body, far from being destructive to the psyche, seems to be either benign and totally harmless or to actually provide positive benefits to the individuals involved.{{sfn|Smith|Sparks|1986|p=183}}

== Social nudism ==
{{See also|Exhibitionism}}

The rhetoric of the nudism and anti-nudism movements emphasizes freedom from many of the normal constraints which regulate human interaction in nudist settings, although for different reasons. Using data from French and German beaches, this hypothesis was tested using five different indicators. Little significant variation between nudists and non-nudists within French and German settings is found in their patterns of interactional spacing, while more significant main effects for differences of cultures are found regardless of nudity status. As a subculture, nudists would appear to differ from nonnudists only in their propensity to like to sunbathe in the nude. Their nude status would appear to have none of the de-inhibiting effects often attributed to nudism. By contrast, clear cultural differences between German and French cultures are shown consistent with [[High- and low-context cultures|Hall's high-low context distinction]] and the [[Robert T. Francoeur|Francoeur]]'s hot-cool sexuality continuum.{{sfn|Smith|1980}}

=== Naturist facilities ===

At naturist organised events or venues clothing is usually optional, except by swimming pools or sunbathing lawns where complete nudity is expected, weather permitting. This rule is sometimes a source of controversy among some naturists. Staff at a naturist facility are usually required to be clothed due to health and safety regulations.{{sfn|Descamps|1987}}

Facilities for naturists are classified in various ways. A landed or members' naturist club is one that owns its own facilities, while non-landed (or travel) clubs meet at various locations, such as private residences, swimming pools, hot springs, landed clubs and resorts, and rented facilities. Landed clubs can be run by members on democratic lines or by one or more owners who make the rules. In either case, they can determine membership criteria and the obligations of members. This usually involves sharing work necessary to maintain or develop the site.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

[[File:Outdoor bathing at Jhiben Hot Spring 20121110.jpg|thumb|Families bathing nude at a hot spring in Taiwan]] &lt;!-- Can we crop this to remove triangle --&gt;

Some clubs have stricter entrance requirements than some traditional 'country clubs', including the requirement to supply references, a sponsoring member, a trial membership, committee approval or, criminal background checks. UK clubs are now required to have child-protection policies in place, and designated child-protection officers. Many clubs promote frequent social activities.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The international naturist organizations were mainly composed of representatives of landed clubs.{{sfn|Choin|2002|p=}} [[Nudist colony]] is no longer a favored term, but it is used by naturists as a term of derision for landed clubs that have rigid non-inclusive membership criteria, and in meta-data on naturist websites.

A holiday centre is a facility that specializes in providing apartments, chalets and camping pitches for visiting holidaymakers. The center is run commercially, and visitors are not members and have no say in the management. Most holiday centers expect visitors to hold an [[International Naturist Federation|INF]] card, that is, be a member of their national organization, but some have relaxed this restriction, relying on the carrying of a trade card. Holiday centers can be quite small, just a couple of hectares or large occupying over 300 hectares.{{efn|The three biggest centres on the [[Médoc]] are Euronat 335 ha, CHM 175 ha with a 3 km beach, and La Jenny 127 ha}} In a large holiday centre there will be swimming pools, sports pitches, an entertainment program, kids' clubs, restaurants and supermarkets. Some holiday centres allow regular visitors to purchase their own chalets, and generations of the same families will visit each year.{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}} Holiday centres are more tolerant of clothing than members-only clubs; total nudity is usually compulsory in the swimming pools and may be expected on the beaches, while on the football pitches, or in the restaurants in the evening, it is rare.{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}}

A naturist resort is, to a European, an essentially urban development where naturism is the norm. [[Cap d'Agde]] in France, naturist village [[Charco del Palo]] on Lanzarote, Canary Islands, [[Vera, Spain|Vera Playa]] in Spain&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Vera Playa history article|url=http://www.veraplaya.info/history.html|accessdate=2007-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Vritomartis{{sfn|Schneider|2009|p=41}} in Greece are examples. Some residents use these resorts as a year-round home.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In US usage, a naturist resort can mean a holiday centre.&lt;ref name="PalmSprings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnyfun.com/faq.html |title=For a relaxed explanation |publisher=Sunnyfun.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308025528/http://sunnyfun.com/faq.html |archivedate=2013-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freikörperkultur]] (FKK) literally translated as 'free body culture' is the name for the general movement in [[Germany]]. The abbreviation is widely recognised all over Europe and often found on informal signs indicating the direction to a remote naturist beach.

=== Nude beaches ===
[[File:Chihuahua20 01 2007 2.jpg|thumb|A sign at a nude beach in Maldonado, Uruguay]]

Clothing is optional at [[nude beach]]es (or "free beaches"). A feature of bathing on a nude beach is the anonymity it offers, with membership of a club not being required, nor detailed application processes, nor pre-booking of visits.{{Original research inline|date=September 2014}}{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

=== Naturism and sports ===
{{see also|Nude recreation|Nudity in sport}}

Naturism encourages a healthy life style, and many naturist clubs at times organize and encourage members to take part in local and international sport events and competitions. The [[Deutscher Verband für Freikörperkultur|German Association for Free Body Culture (DFK)]]  promotes recreational sports and is a member of the [[German Olympic Sport Federation]] ([[DOSB]]).

=== Festival naturism ===
[[File:People pix in the village.jpg|thumb|Naturist couple at the [[Nambassa]] festival, New Zealand, 1981]]

From [[Woodstock]] to [[Edinburgh Festival|Edinburgh]], and [[Nambassa]] in the southern hemisphere communal nudity is commonly recorded at music and [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] festivals.

The series of 1970s [[Nambassa]] [[hippie]] festivals held in New Zealand is a further example of non-sexualized naturism. Of the 75,000 patrons who attended the 1979 Nambassa 3 day [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] Festival an estimated 35% of festival attendees spontaneously chose to remove their clothing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nambassa.com/johnlowe.html |title=Public nudity at Nambassa |publisher=Nambassa.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; preferring complete or partial nudity.{{sfn|Jones &amp; Broadley|1979|p=}}'

[[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde festival]] in Denmark hosts a naked run, that has become one of the most popular events there.

Perhaps nowadays the biggest and most famous festival where participants spontaneously decide to go naked or take part in nude events is [[Burning Man]]: it's got its own naked bike ride aka 'Naked Pub Crawl', and a few camps organize activities in the nude, including the famous&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/naked-restaurant-paris-park-bunyadi-nude-cruise-nudist-resort-hotel-greece-pictures-a7346721.html|title=Naked ambition: 5 ways to holiday in the nude|date=2016-10-05|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; oil wrestling by camp [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|Gymnasium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://activenaturists.net/gymnasium-camp/|title=Gymnasium theme camp|date=2015-11-07|work=Active Naturists|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summer naturism===
The prevalence of naturism tends to increase during the summer months especially when the temperature is higher with some regions experiencing first-time naturists and people who have transitioned to becoming a naturist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McLellan | first1 = Josie | year = 2007 | title = State socialist bodies: East German nudism from ban to boom | url = | journal = The Journal of Modern History | volume = 79 | issue = 1| pages = 48–79 | doi=10.1086/517544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have observed that among some of these naturists, they are clothed during other seasons, thus making them seasonal naturists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Casler | first1 = Lawrence | year = 1964 | title = Some sociopsychological observations in a nudist camp: A preliminary study | url = | journal = The Journal of social psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 2| pages = 307–323 | doi=10.1080/00224545.1964.9919569}}&lt;/ref&gt; This quiddity has caught the public perception and comprehension of public nudity, and thus it is frequently equated with summer destinations such as beaches.&lt;ref&gt;Moon, Storm.

== History ==
{{Main|History of nudity|l1=Nudity in History}}
{{see also|Timeline of non-sexual social nudity}}
Nudity in social contexts has been practised in various forms by many [[culture]]s at all time periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://activenaturists.net/how-it-used-to-be/ |title=nudity as a social norm |publisher=active naturists |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Western society nowadays, social nudity is most frequently encountered in the contexts of [[bathing]], swimming and in [[sauna]]s, whether in single-sex groups, within the family or with mixed-sex friends, but throughout history and in many tropical cultures until now, nudity is a norm at many sports events and competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://activenaturists.net/nudity-ok2/ |title=naked sport events throughout history |publisher=active naturists |date=2012-08-30 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to nominate exactly when naturism started as a movement. The word 'naturism' was used for the first time in 1778 by a French-speaking Belgian, Jean Baptiste Luc Planchon (1734–1781), and was advocated as a means of improving the ''hygiène de vie'' or healthy living.{{efn|"Le naturisme est la doctrine qui consiste à laisser agir la nature plutot que d'intervenir de manière artificielle".&lt;ref name="Planchon"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Planchon|first=Jean Baptiste Luc |title=La naturisme, ou La nature considérée dans les maladies &amp; leur traitement conforme à la doctrine &amp; à la pratique d'Hippocrate et de ses sectateurs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S3ZEAAAAcAAJ|year=1778|publisher=Varlé}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The earliest known naturist club in the "western" sense of the word was established in British [[India]] in 1891. The 'Fellowship of the Naked Trust' was founded by Charles Edward Gordon Crawford, a widower, who was a [[District Courts of India|District and Sessions Judge]] for the [[Bombay]] [[Indian Civil Service|Civil Service]]. The commune was based in [[Matheran]] and had just three members at the beginning; Crawford and two sons of an [[Anglican]] missionary, Andrew and Kellogg Calderwood.{{efn|Crawford wrote a series of letters discussing his new club and its philosophy to the socialist [[Edward Carpenter]] between 1891 and 1892. In his letters to Carpenter, Crawford described his daily activities.

: "Calderwood and I were up at Matheran having two days’ holiday to spend naked from breakfast to evening [...] in June, Calderwood and I had a grand day. We went away to a bungalow in the [[Tulsi Lake]] without servants and spent from dinner time Saturday till 5 pm Sunday in nature’s garb".

The club's dress code required full nudity, with exceptions made for accessories such as rings and glasses. Members of the club had to be plainspoken about sexual related matters and all [[taboo]]s were consciously discarded. Carpenter suggested that a female branch should be added to the commune, although this was not achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/mumbai/cover-story/Worlds-first-nudist-colony-was-in-Thane-and-this-man-proved-it/articleshow/16011435.cms|title=World's first nudist colony was in Thane (and this man proved it)|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
The commune fell apart when Crawford was transferred to [[Ratnagiri]]; he died soon after in 1894.{{sfn|Farrar|2005}}

[[File:Koch, Max (1854-1925) - 1897 - Freilicht - vmp 01.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Max Koch]]'s ''Freilicht'', 1897]]

In 1902, a series of philosophical papers was published in [[Germany]] by Dr. [[Heinrich Pudor]], under the pseudonym Heinrich Scham, who coined the term ''Nacktkultur''. In 1906 he went on to write a three volume treatise with his new term as its title, which discussed the benefits of nudity in co-education and advocated participating in sports while being free of cumbersome clothing.{{sfn|Buchy|2005}} [[Richard Ungewitter]] (''Nacktheit'', 1906, ''Nackt'', 1908, etc.) proposed that combining physical fitness, sunlight, and fresh air bathing, and then adding the nudist philosophy, contributed to mental and psychological fitness, good health, and an improved moral-life view.{{sfn|Buchy|2005}} Major promoters of these ideas included [[Adolf Koch]] and [[Hans Suren]]. Germany published the first journal of nudism between 1902 and 1932.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|p=}}

The wide publication of those papers and others, contributed to an explosive worldwide growth of nudism, in which nudists participated in various social, recreational, and physical fitness activities in the nude. The first organized club for nudists on a large scale, ''Freilichtpark'' (Free-Light Park), was opened near [[Hamburg]] in 1903 by Paul Zimmerman.{{sfn|Buchy|2005}}
In 1919, German doctor [[Kurt Huldschinsky]] discovered that exposure to sunlight helped to cure [[rickets]] in many children, causing sunlight to be associated with improved health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26935867 10 inventions that owe their success to World War One]&lt;/ref&gt;

In France in the early 20th century, the brothers [[Gaston Durville|Gaston]] and [[André Durville]], both of them physicians, studied the effects of psychology, nutrition, and environment on health and healing. They became convinced of the importance of natural foods and the natural environment on human well-being and health. They named this concept {{lang-fr|naturisme}}. The profound effect of clean air and sunlight on human bodies became evident to them and so nudity became a part of their naturism.

Naturism became a more widespread phenomenon in the 1920s, in [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and other European countries and spread to the [[United States]] where it became established in the 1930s.

By 1951, the national federations united to form the [[International Naturist Federation]] or [[International Naturist Federation|INF]].{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}} Some naturists preferred not to join clubs, and after 1945, pressure was put to designate beaches for naturist use.
From the middle of the 20th century, with changing leisure patterns, commercial organisations began opening holiday resorts to attract naturists who expected the same&amp;nbsp;– or better&amp;nbsp;– standards of comfort and amenity offered to non-naturists.  More recently, naturist holiday options have expanded to include cruises.{{sfn|Buchy|2005}}

== Philosophy ==
[[File:Badstuga, efter illustration i Acerbis Travels, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|right|''Finnish Sauna'' (1802)]]
Naturism had many different philosophical sources and means many things to different people.&lt;ref name="Carter2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carter|first1=Michael|title=J.C. Flügel and the Nude Future|journal=Fashion Theory|volume=7|issue=1|year=2003|pages=79–101|issn=1362-704X|doi=10.2752/136270403778052203}}{{subscription|via=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no one definition. In 1974, the INF defined naturism as:

:: ''a way of life in harmony with nature characterised by the practice of social nudity with the intention of encouraging self-respect, respect for others and for the environment.&lt;ref name="Definition" /&gt;

At one end of the spectrum are the nudists who just enjoy a nude life style, and at the other are the naturists, who have deeply held beliefs and see communal nudity as just one of many important principles.

The naturist philosophy has several sources, many of which can be traced back to early 20th century health and fitness philosophies in [[Germany]] and [[England]], although the concepts of returning to nature and creating equality have much deeper roots.

&lt;!-- moved from lead- needs integrating From Germany the idea spread to the rest of Europe and [[North America]] and beyond where a network of clubs developed. The model of [[Deutscher Verband für Freikörperkultur|German naturism]]  is to promote naturist family and recreational sports, with the [[DFK|German Association for Free Body Culture (DFK)]] being a member of the [[German Olympic Sport Federation]] ([[DOSB]]). [[France|French]] naturism developed on the basis of large [[vacation (travel)|holiday]] complexes. This in turn influenced [[Quebec]] and the United States. A subsequent development was [[tourism|tourist]] naturism, where nudist resorts would be built to cater for the nudist tourist, without any local base. This concept is most noticeable in the [[Caribbean]]. Nevertheless, most naturist activity takes place at local naturist clubs, especially in Western countries. --&gt;

=== Gymnosophy and religious nakedness ===
{{see also|Gymnosophist|American Gymnosophical Association}}

In the 4th century BC, [[Alexander the Great]] encountered, in India, wandering groups of naked holy men whom he dubbed the ''naked philosophers''. (''Gr ''gymnos'': naked; ''sophist'': knowledge''). The philosopher [[Onesicritus]] investigated their beliefs and lifestyle. [[Pyrrho]] the [[Sceptic]] was impressed and incorporated nudity into his philosophy. The Gymnosophists were [[Hindu]]s, but [[Jain]] and [[Ajivika]] monks [[Nudity in religion|practiced nudity as a statement]] that they had given up all worldly goods. Nudity was not a new concept to the Greeks as the [[Olympic Games]] (founded in 776 BC) were exclusively male and nude events. 

Historically, the [[Adamites]], a [[Gnostic]] sect, practiced [[Nudity in religion|religious nudism]].
A religious sect in Canada that immigrated from Russia, the [[Sons of Freedom (political group)|Sons of Freedom]], went so far in the 1900s (1903-1950s) as to publicly strip in mass public demonstrations to protest against government policies which were meant to assimilate them.&lt;ref&gt;* Jim Hamm Productions Limited ''Spirit Wrestlers'', a 2002 documentary video and DVD about the Russian Christian sect called Freedomite Doukhobors,&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[Christian naturism]] contains various members associated with most [[Christian denomination|denominations]].  Although beliefs vary, a common theme is that much of Christianity has misinterpreted the events regarding the [[Garden of Eden]], and God was displeased with [[Adam and Eve]] for covering their bodies with [[fig leaf|fig leaves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.figleafforum.com/resources_genesis.html |title="What Do The First Three Chapters Of Genesis Teach About Clothing?" by Ian B. Johnson, Fig Leaf Forum (note: articles such as this one are peer reviewed) |publisher=Figleafforum.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first English naturists adopted the name Gymnosophy as a thinly disguised euphemism for their pastime. The [[English Gymnosophical Society]] was formed in 1922 and became the [[New Gymnosophy Society]] in 1926; they purchased land at 'Bricketts Wood' to become Britain's first [[nudist colony]]. One of the first members was [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], who in 1945 established the 'Five Acres Club' nearby, ostensibly as a nudist club, but as a front for [[Wicca]]ns, as [[witchcraft]] was illegal in England until 1951.

The [[Digambar]], one of the two main divisions of the [[Jainism|Jain]] religion of India, remain [[Skyclad (Neopaganism)|skyclad]], or naked, though generally it is practiced by males.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Digambar means 'clothed with the sky'. [[Wicca]]ns have adopted this wording and some practice their rituals skyclad.

=== Naturist writers ===
* [[Elton Raymond Shaw]] was a [[Methodist]] churchman and publisher who wrote on the Body Taboo.
* [[Heinrich Pudor]] wrote on methods to improve social hygiene in his book ''Nackende Menschen und Jauchzen der Zukunft'' (Naked people and the future of Mankind) and then ''[[Nacktkultur]]'' (Nude Culture). It prescribes an austere lifestyle and nudity.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}
* [[:de:Paul Zimmermann|Paul Zimmermann]] opened the Freilicht Park in Lübeck which was open to those who subscribed to Nacktkultur principles.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}
* [[Richard Ungewitter]] wrote ''Die Nacktheit'' (Nakedness) which sold 90,000 copies, prescribed a similar Utopian lifestyle, where everyone would be nude, eat only vegetables and abstain from alcohol and tobacco. In his Utopia, everyone was to be Germanic with blue eyes and blonde hair.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}
* [[:de:Adolf Koch|Adolf Koch]], a left-wing primary-school teacher, sought to use social nudity to free the people from 'authority fixated conditioning which held proletarians in deference of their masters: parental authority, paternalism of the church, the mass media and organs of law and order. He used Organic-Rhythmic exercises in Berlin schools in the 1920s. In 1932 there were about 100,000 Germans involved with Naturism, of which 70,000 were in Koch's ''Körperschülen'' schools.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}
* [[:de:Hans Suren|Hans Surén]] taught nude gymnastics to soldiers for five years, and on being forced to leave the army, he wrote in 1924, ''Mensch und die Sonne'' (Men and the Sun) which ran to 61 reprints.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}} Later, in 1936, Surén proposed physical exercise and naturism as a means of creating a pure German race and of beauty. In the early 1940s he was out of favour and arrested. By 1945, he had turned full circle and was writing religious texts. Though never a member of any FKK club he was awarded honorary membership of the [[Deutscher Verband für Freikörperkultur|DFK]] in 1952.
* [[:de:Werner Zimmermann|Werner Zimmermann]] was Swiss. He promoted [[Progressive education]], encouraging naked [[Physical education]] to eliminate body guilt and to encourage openness that would lift the repression of the human spirit, which he saw as the cause of sexual deviation. The basic position was that the human body, in and of itself, was neither sinful nor obscene. This was adopted into the emerging philosophy that created the modern Western nudist movement.

=== Naturist ideals ===
[[File:Nude people at Praia do Abricó.jpg|right|thumb|Family in Praia do Abricó, [[Brazil]]]]

Individuals have formed naturist groups for a variety of specific purposes.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}} It is generally agreed by naturist organisations that [[eroticism]] and blatant sexuality have no place in naturism and are, in fact, antithetical to its ideals. Reasons that have at times been given:

* [[ecology|Ecological]] or [[environmentalist|environmental]]&amp;nbsp;— rapport with the natural world.
* [[Health]]&amp;nbsp;— bathing in the sun, fresh air and water ([[balneotherapy]], [[thalassotherapy]], [[heliotherapy]]). Sun is a form of medicine.
* [[Healthy diet|Diet]]&amp;nbsp;— Naturism has at times been associated with claims made for moderation with [[alcohol]], [[meat]], [[tobacco]], [[drug]]s; leading to a [[teetotal]], [[vegetarian]] or [[vegan]] lifestyle.
* [[Nude psychotherapy|Psychologically]] — rapport with other humans including equality and respect. Being nude in groups makes all feel more accepted&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; physically, intellectually and emotionally.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt;
* [[Spirituality]]&amp;nbsp;— nudity, well being and direct contact to nature helps feel closer to the universe.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}
* [[Pedagogy]]&amp;nbsp;— children should be respected as equals instead of being patronised{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}
* [[Social equality|Equality]]&amp;nbsp;— clothes build social barriers. Social nudity leads to acceptance in spite of differences in age, body shape, fitness, and health.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Discussed in:{{Citation | last = Veltheim| first = Andrew| author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Naturism: Naked Beneath Your Clothing| year = | url = http://www.parama.com/html/naturism.html| accessdate =2012-04-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408070907/http://www.parama.com/html/body_naturism.html |archivedate=2010-04-08 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Liberty]]&amp;nbsp;— no one has the right to tell others or their children that they must wear clothes.

=== Naturism and the romantics ===
[[Walt Whitman]] American writer, A Sun-bathed Nakedness:

{{quote|Never before did I get so close to Nature; never before did she come so close to me... Nature was naked, and I was also... Sweet, sane, still Nakedness in Nature! - ah if poor, sick, prurient humanity in cities might really know you once more! Is not nakedness indecent? No, not inherently. It is your thought, your sophistication, your fear, your respectability, that is indecent. There come moods when these clothes of ours are not only too irksome to wear, but are themselves indecent.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Citation|title=Nakedness and Nature|url=http://www.naturistplace.com/nudity19.htm|website=Naturist Place|date=8 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Henry David Thoreau]], ''In wildness is the preservation of the world.'', [[Walking (Thoreau)|Walking]]:

{{quote|We cannot adequately appreciate this aspect of nature if we approach it with any taint of human pretense. It will elude us if we allow artifacts like clothing to intervene between ourselves and this Other. To apprehend it, we cannot be naked enough.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;}}

Naturism was part of a literary movement in the late 1800s (see the writings of [[André Gide]]) which also influenced the art movements of the time specifically [[Henri Matisse]] and other [[Fauvism|Fauve]] painters. This movement was based on the French concept of ''[[joie de vivre]]'', the idea of reveling freely in physical sensations and direct experiences and a spontaneous approach to life.{{sfn|Harrison &amp; Perry|1993|p=}}

=== Naturism for health ===
[[Sunlight]] has been shown to be beneficial in some skin conditions and enables the body to make [[vitamin D]],&lt;ref name=bupa2004&gt;{{Citation| last =BUPA's Health Information Team| first =| author-link =| last2 =| first2 =| author2-link =| title =Hot topic – Vitamin D, sunlight and cancer| date =24 March 2004| url =http://www.bupa.co.uk/health_information/html/health_news/261103vitd.html| accessdate =2007-12-02| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070203050901/http://www.bupa.co.uk/health_information/html/health_news/261103vitd.html| archivedate =3 February 2007| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; but with the increased awareness of [[skin cancer]], wearing of [[sunscreen]] is now part of the culture.&lt;ref name=bupa2004/&gt; Sun exposure prompts the body to produce [[nitric oxide]] that helps support the cardiovascular system and the feelgood brain-chemical [[serotonin]].&lt;ref name="LindqvistEpstein2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lindqvist|first1=P.

===World Naked Bike Ride===
[[File:Naked Bike Ride - Holborn - 12 June 2016.JPG|thumb|WNBR passing [[Holborn tube station|Holborn underground station]] 11 June 2016]]
The [[World Naked Bike Ride]] (WNBR) is an international [[clothing-optional bike ride]] and exercise in [[public nudity]], that has developed outside the organised naturism movement. Participants plan, meet and ride together ''en masse'' on [[human-powered transport]] (the vast majority on [[bicycle]]s, but some on [[skateboard]]s and [[inline skates]]), to "deliver a vision of a cleaner, safer, body-positive world."&lt;ref name="WNBRwebsite"&gt;[http://worldnakedbikeride.org Official WNBR global web site] circa June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The WNBR shares some aspects of the philosophy of naturism in that it promotes a return to healthy exercise in unpolluted air at the same time promoting positive body image.

== Demographics ==
* In 1999, the [[Federation of Canadian Naturists]] commissioned a national survey on Canadian attitudes towards nudity&lt;ref name=fcnstat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcn.ca/about-naturism/information-and-references/survey-on-naturism-in-canada |title=1999 National Survey on Canadian Attitudes Towards Nudity |year=1999 |work=Federation of Canadian Naturists |publisher=Federation of Canadian Naturists |location=Ontario, Canada |accessdate=2011-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003072728/http://www.fcn.ca/about-naturism/information-and-references/survey-on-naturism-in-canada |archivedate=2011-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  which found that 8.9% of Canadian have visited or would visit a naturist facility. A further 11.6% have gone or would go skinny dipping in mixed company; that 39% go naked in their own homes; that naturists tend to have above average incomes; that urban dwellers are more likely to be naturist than country dwellers; and that the under 25s are the most likely to be naturists.
* In 1983, the Naturist Society in the United States sponsored a Gallup poll, which was repeated in 2000,{{sfn|Anderson |2000}} which found the following:

&lt;!-- Needs to be rewritten and sourced.
=== Croatia ===
Croatia has been an attractive naturist destination for five decades. Today there are more than 30 official naturist campsites, tourist villages, hotels, apartments, beaches and numerous more unofficial naturist bathing places.
Naturism is well accepted all along Croatian Adriatic coast. There are official naturist beaches which are sometimes within all naturist resorts and campings and sometimes there are special areas in textile resorts assigned for naturists. Often entrance is charged.
Then there are so called free beaches which are known to be naturist for many years, but not officially. Those places are mostly clothing optional.
And finally there are wild beaches where one can freely choose to be bare or to keep swimming suit on.
Naturist beaches are marked with signs saying "FKK" for "Freikörperkultur," German for Free Body Culture. Unofficial beaches are sometimes called free beaches. Croatia's naturist facilities often focus on different visitor categories, including families, adults, gays, and those where everyone is welcome. Beaches also often are sectioned into these categories.
Many naturist beaches (official or not) are within walking distance from centers of towns, villages or resorts. Many of the regular beaches have also a naturist section, usually at the end of the beach.
Croatia has long been popular for bare-all beach holidays, especially with German and Dutch nudists. Koversada, an island linked by bridge to the Istrian mainland, is the oldest among 30 official naturist resorts. All are indicated by "FKK" signs but there are also scores of unofficial strips.{{cn|date=November 2013}} --&gt;{{main|List of social nudity places in Europe}}

=== Finland ===
In [[Finnish culture]], nudism is considered to be a relatively normal way to live. It is not uncommon to see entire families spending time together naked. Families may be naked while bathing in a sauna, swimming in a pool, or playing on a beach, and it's not unusual to see children playing naked in a kindergarten or family yard for example. Nudity as a whole is considered less taboo than many other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Mapes, Terri. [http://goscandinavia.about.com/od/finland/qt/nudism_finland.htm "Nudism in Finland"]. ''about travel''.

{{main|Naturism in France}}

In 1903 la ''[[Revue des deux mondes]]'' published a report on [[Freikörperkultur|German naturism]] and S. Gay created a naturist community at Bois-Fourgon. In 1907, supported by his superiors, Abbé Legrée encouraged the students at his Catholic college to bathe nude on the rocky beaches near [[Marseille]].

[[File:CapdAgde crop.jpg|thumb|right|Sign at [[Cap d'Agde]] mentioning that it is obligatory to be nude at this beach]]

Marcel Kienné de Mongeot is credited with starting naturism in France in 1920. His family had suffered from tuberculosis, and he saw naturism as a cure and a continuation of the traditions of the ancient Greeks. In 1926, he started the magazine ''Vivre intégralement'' (later called ''Vivre'') and the first French naturist club, ''Sparta Club'' at Garambouville, near [[Evreux]].  The court action that he initiated, established that nudism was legal on private property that was fenced and screened.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}

[[File:Nude hiking in Gard.jpg|thumb|left|Randonue in [[Les Concluses]], [[Gard]], 2008]]

Drs. André and Gaston Durville bought a 70 hectare site on the [[Île du Levant]] where they established the village of [[Île du Levant|Héliopolis]]. The village was open to the public. In 1925 Dr François Fougerat de David de Lastours wrote a thesis on [[heliotherapy]]. and in that year opened the ''Club gymnique de France''.  In 1936, the naturist movement was officially recognised.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}

Albert and Christine Lecocq were active members of many of these clubs, but after disagreements left and In 1944 Albert and Christine Lecocq founded the ''Club du Soleil'' with members in 84 cities. In 1948 they founded the [[:fr:Féderation Française de Naturisme|FFN]], in 1949 they started the magazine, ''Vie au Soleil'' and in 1950 opened the [[CHM Montalivet]], the world's first naturist holiday centre where the [[International Naturist Federation|INF]] was formed.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}

The naturist village [[Leucate]] and [[Cap d'Agde]] offers a different form of social nudity. [[Euronat (naturist resort)|Euronat]] is the largest holiday centre (335ha) situated 10&amp;nbsp;km north of Montalivet. Naturism employs more than 3000 people, and is estimated to be worth 250 million Euro to the French economy.&lt;!-- ref needed --&gt; France is represented on the [[International Naturist Federation|INF]] by the [[:fr:Féderation Française de Naturisme|FFN]].

{{See also|Freikörperkultur}}
German naturism was part of the [[Lebensreform]] movement and the [[Wandervogel]] youth movement of 1896, from [[Steglitz]], [[Berlin]] which promoted ideas of fitness and vigour. At the same time doctors of the [[:de:Naturheilbewegung|Natural Healing Movement]] were using [[heliotherapy]], treating diseases such as [[Tuberculosis|TB]], [[rheumatism]] and [[scrofula]] with exposure to sunlight.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}

[[File:Naked woman in inner city 3.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[nude]] woman moves in a busy market in Germany, while other people carry on with their routine activities, 2005.]]

Nacktkultur, a term coined in 1903 by [[Heinrich Pudor]], flourished.{{sfn|Toepfer|1997|p=}}  Nacktkultur connected nudity, vegetarianism and social reform. It was practised in a network of 200 members clubs. The movement gained prominence in the 1920s as offering a health giving life-style with Utopian ideals. Germany published the first naturist journal between 1902 and 1932.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|p=}}
It became politicised by radical socialists who believed it would lead to classlessness and a breaking down of society. It became associated with [[pacificism]].{{sfn|Hau|2003|p=}}

In 1926, [[Adolf Koch]] established a school of naturism in Berlin; encouraging a mixing of the sexes, open air exercises, and a programme of "sexual hygiene". In 1929, the Berlin school hosted the first International Congress on Nudity.{{sfn|Toepfer|1997|p=}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1988-0905-402, Ostsee, Sonnenbad.jpg|thumb|left|Young East German women at a naturist beach in 1988]]

During the [[Nazism|National Socialist]] ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' era, all naturist clubs had to register with the ''Reichsbund für Leibesübungen'', which meant excluding [[Judaism|Jews]] and [[Communism|Communists]]. Also, they had to keep all activities hidden in the countryside where there was little chance of being seen by others. The status as a West German ''sports federation'' member gave the clubs rights and privileges (e.g. tax exemptions) so the naturist clubs remained in the federation after the war had ended.

After the war, [[East Germany|East Germans]] were free to practice naturism, chiefly at beaches rather than clubs (private organizations being regarded as potentially subversive). Naturism became a large element in DDR politics. The ''Proletarische Freikörperkulturbewegung'' subsection of the Workers Sports Organisation had 60,000 members.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}

=== Poland ===
First reported naturist society was established in 1897 in [[Grudziądz]]. In pre-war and post-war [[Poland]], naturism was practised in closed and secluded areas. Reported places for naturism were [[Zaleszczyki]] (in today's [[Ukraine]]) and [[Otwock]]. Under the [[communist|communism]] regime, Poland's naturism became unofficial and was practiced mostly by the artistic boheme near [[Krynica Morska]], [[Misdroy]] and Dębki.

In the early 1980s naturism became popular mostly due to increased interest in [[News media|media]]. As the [[pop music|pop]] song "Chałupy Welcome To" (about the naturist beach in Chałupy, featuring beach nudity in the clip) became the 1985 [[summer hit]] in Poland, the nude seaside locations like [[Chałupy]] or [[Rowy, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Rowy]] became known to an average Polish sunbather. Polish Naturist Society was formed and after the number of [[lawsuit]]s, naturism became tolerated in selected "unofficial" beaches and distant spots.

In today's Poland naturism is practiced in number of the seaside and inland beaches. Most Polish beaches are actually [[Free beach|clothes-optional]] rather than naturist. Among the most popular locations are [[Misdroy|Misdroy-Lubiewo]], Grzybowo, [[Rowy, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Rowy]], Dębki, [[Gdańsk|Gdańsk-Stogi]] and Piaski. The most popular inland locations include [[Warsaw]] (Wał Miedzeszyński), Kazimierz Dolny and Kryspinów near [[Kraków]]. In the winter season, naturism is practiced by organized groups in [[Warsaw]] and [[Tricity, Poland|Tri-City]]. Public naturist events are held bi-monthly in [[Poznań|Poznań-Koziegłowy]] and [[Łódź]] [[waterparks|waterpark]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

=== Portugal ===
{{main|Naturism in Portugal}}
Naturism in Portugal had its first historical record around 1920, linked to the Portuguese Naturist Society, of which the anarcho-syndicalist José Peralta was a prominent member. Nudity was already being practiced on [[Costa da Caparica]] beaches. With the beginning of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|New State]] authoritarian regime in the 1930s, the naturist movement was limited to vegetarian and alternative medicines, since nudity was banned and associated to the crime of "indecency". Only after the end of the New State regime in 1974 (April, 25th) the activities linked to the practice of nudity were resumed.

The ''Federação Portuguesa de Naturismo'' (Portuguese Naturist Federation) or FPN was founded on the March 1st, 1977, at a meeting in Lisbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpn.pt/sobre_nos/quem_somos_en.php|title=Home &gt; About Us &gt; Who We Are|publisher=Portuguese Naturist Federation|accessdate=2 February 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203081647/http://www.fpn.pt/sobre_nos/quem_somos_en.php|archivedate=3 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the present, there are seven official naturist beaches in Portugal. Besides these, there are several dozens of beaches were the practice of naturism is common. There are also several naturist campings and resorts.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Slovenia ===
Beginnings of naturism in Slovenia started in the year 1852, when a 29 year old Swiss physician [[Arnold Rikli]] visited [[Bled]] for the first time. In the following years he started to promote healthy way of living, because he considered water, air and light&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zupanic-Slavec|first1=Z|last2=Toplak|first2=C|title=Water, air and light--Arnold Rikli (1823-1906)|journal=Gesnerus|date=1998|volume=55|issue=1–2|pages=58–69|pmid=9684537|doi=10.5169/seals-520867}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be the source for his healing therapy. He continued to build [[spa]] centers which included [[light therapy]] and [[hydrotherapy]] treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resonantfm.com/a-very-brief-history-of-red-light/|title=A Very Brief History of Red Light|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first visitors were most likely [[pilgrim]]s from Slovenia and [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] region who visited the church on Bled island. When the word has spread across Europe, other visitors started visiting Bled known for Rikli's healing therapy. A method used in the healing therapy process included [[sunbathing]] and visitors were often seen walking nude in public. Rikli continued to promote his healing tourism for the next 52 years, when he lived in Bled.

=== Spain ===
[[File:Nudist-Textile couple in Cabo de Gata, Spain.jpg|thumb|Nudist man and textile woman on a beach in Spain.]]
Public nudity in Spain is not illegal since there is no law banning its practice. Spanish legislation foresees felony for exhibitionism but restricts its scope to obscene exposure in front of children or mentally impaired individuals, i.e. with sexual connotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1995-25444&amp;tn=1&amp;p=20150428#a185|title=BOE.es - Documento consolidado BOE-A-1995-25444|website=www.boe.es|language=es|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, people do not normally use this right to be naked to do it anywhere, and most usually perform this activity in places where nudism is a tradition.

There are however some municipalities (like [[San Pedro del Pinatar, Spain|San Pedro del Pinatar]]) where public nudity has been regulated (banned) by means of [[By-law|by-laws]]. Other municipalities (like [[Barcelona]], [[Salou]], [[Platja de Palma]] and [[Sant Antoni de Portmany]]) have also used these provisions to regulate the practice of semi-nudism, forcing people to cover their torso on the streets. Some naturist associations have appealed these by-laws on the grounds that a fundamental right ([[freedom of expression]], as they understand that nudism is a way of self-expression) cannot be regulated with this mechanism. Some judicial instances have ruled in favour of nudist associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.europapress.es/catalunya/noticia-federacion-espanola-naturismo-recurre-tsjc-prohibicion-nudismo-barcelona-20110717185055.html|title=La Federación Española de Naturismo recurre ante el TSJC la prohibición del nudismo en Barcelona|last=Press|first=Europa|date=2011-07-17|work=europapress.es|access-date=2017-12-03|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elconfidencialdigital.com/la_buena_vida/tendencias/localidades-multan-vas-camiseta-calle_0_2300169989.html|title=Cuatro localidades donde te multan si vas sin camiseta por la calle|work=El Confidencial Digital|access-date=2017-12-03|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nudism in Spain is normally practised by the seaside, on beaches or small coves with a tradition on naturism. In [[Vera, Spain|Vera]] ([[Andalusia]]), there is a wide residential area formed by nudist urbanisations that constitute some kind of nudist town. Nudist organisations may organise some activities elsewhere in inner territory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naturismo.org/adn/calendario.html|title=Calendario actividades 2017. ADN: Asociación para el Desarrollo del Naturismo de la Comunidad de Madrid|website=www.naturismo.org|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; (like hiking on the mountains close to Madrid), but these kind of activities are negligible. Madrid municipality enables nudist use of some of their public swimming pools one day during summer.

Textile use of traditionally nudist public spaces (like beaches or streets nearby) is allowed, mainly due to lack of regulation. Mixed groups of nudist and textile individuals are frequent in these kind of spaces. In order to chase voyeuristic persons away, nudist people will normally clap their hands.

Legal aspects regarding topless are analogue to those regarding nudism, but social tolerance towards topless is higher. This let people not cover their breasts in public swimming pools and on any beach in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20170811/43474195994/espanolas-topless.html|title=Las españolas son las que más topless y nudismo hacen|work=La Vanguardia|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the first official nudist club was established in [[Wickford]], [[Essex]] in 1924. According to Michael Farrar, writing for [[British Naturism]] the club adopted the name "Moonella Group" from the name of the owner of the ground, ''Moonella'', and called its site [[The Camp (Naturism)|The Camp]]. Moonella, who was still living in 1965 but whose identity remains to be discovered, had inherited a house with land in 1923 and made it available to certain members of the [[New Gymnosophy Society]]. This society had been founded a few years before by H.C. Booth, M.H. Sorensen and Rex Wellbye under the name of the [[English Gymnosophical Society]]. It met for discussions at the Minerva Cafe at 144 [[High Holborn]] in London, the headquarters of the [[Women's Freedom League]]. Those who were permitted to join the Moonella Group were carefully selected, and the club was run by an "aristocracy" of the original members, all of whom had "club names" to preserve their anonymity. The club closed in 1926 because of building on adjacent land.&lt;ref name=bntimeline&gt;{{Citation|last=Farrar |first=Michael |author-link= |last2= |first2= |author2-link= |title=The history of naturism – a timeline |date= |year=2007 |url=http://www.british-naturism.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_ID=50 |accessdate=2008-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019033149/https://british-naturism.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_ID=50 |archivedate=2010-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bnmoonella&gt;{{Citation|last=Farrar |first=Michael |author-link= |last2= |first2= |author2-link= |title=The Moonella Group |date= |year=2007 |url=http://www.british-naturism.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_ID=42 |accessdate=2008-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205201517/https://www.british-naturism.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_ID=42 |archivedate=2008-12-05 |df= }}

&lt;!-- [[File:WNBR Brighton 2014 04.jpg|thumb|upright|At the [[World Naked Bike Ride]] in Brighton, 2014]]-- better image now used--&gt;
By 1943 there were a number of these so-called "sun clubs" and together they formed the [[British Sun Bathers Association]] or BSBA. In 1954 a group of clubs unhappy with the way the BSBA was being run split off to form the Federation of British Sun Clubs or FBSC. In 1961, the BSBA Annual Conference agreed that the term nudist was inappropriate and should be discarded in favour of naturist.&lt;ref name=bntimeline/&gt; The two organisations rivalled each other before eventually coming together again in 1964 as the [[British Naturism|Central Council for British Naturism]] or [[British Naturism|CCBN]]. This organisation structure has remained much the same but it is now called [[British Naturism]] which is often abbreviated to BN.&lt;ref name=bntimeline/&gt; BN is currently a [[company limited by guarantee]].

The first official nude beach was opened at [[Fairlight Glen]] in Covehurst Bay near [[Hastings]] in 1978 (not to be confused with [[Fairlight Cove]], which is 2&amp;nbsp;km to the east) followed later by the beaches at [[Brighton]] and [[Fraisthorpe]]. [[Bridlington]] opened in April 1980.&lt;ref name=bntimeline/&gt;

== In North America ==

=== Canada ===
In [[Canada]], individuals around the country became interested in nudism, skinny-dipping, and physical culture in the early part of the 20th century. After 1940 they had their own Canadian magazine, ''Sunbathing &amp; Health'', which occasionally carried local news. Canadians had scattered groups in several cities during the 1930s and 1940s, and some of these groups attracted enough interest to form clubs on private land.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}} The most significant clubs were the Van Tan Club, formed in 1939, and continues today in North Vancouver, BC.,{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}} and, in Ontario, the Sun Air Club.

Canadians who served in the military during the Second World War met like-minded souls from across the country, and often visited clubs while in Europe. They were a ready pool of recruits for post-war organizers. A few years later, the wave of post-war immigration brought many Europeans with their own extensive experience, and they not only swelled the ranks of membership, but often formed their own clubs, helping to expand nudism from coast to coast.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

Most of those clubs united in the Canadian Sunbathing Association, which affiliated with the American Sunbathing Association in 1954. Several disagreements between eastern and western members of the CSA resulted in the breakup of CSA into the Western Canadian Sunbathing Association (WCSA) and the Eastern Canadian Sunbathing Association (ECSA) in 1960. The ECSA endured much in-fighting over the next decade and a half, leading to its official demise in 1978. The WCSA continues today as the American Association for Nude Recreation&amp;nbsp;– Western Canadian Region (www.aanr-wc.com), a region of the [[American Association for Nude Recreation]] (AANR) which itself was formerly known as the ASA.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

In 1977 the [[La Fédération Québécoise de Naturisme|Fédération québécoise de naturisme]] (FQN) was founded in Quebec, by Michel Vaïs, who had experienced European naturism at Montalivet. In 1985 the [[Federation of Canadian Naturists]] (FCN) was formed with the support of the FQN. In 1988 the FQN and FCN formed the [[FQN-FCN Union]] as the official Canadian representative in the [[International Naturist Federation]] (INF).{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

In 1925, Katherine and Herman Shoshinki were familiar with nudism from Germany from 1918 to 1923. Kurt Barthel founded the [[American League for Physical Culture]] in 1929 and organized the first nudist event. In about 1930 they organized the [[American Gymnosophical Association]]. Barthel founded America's first official [[nudist]] camp, Sky Farm in [[New Jersey]], in May, 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Ellensburg Daily Record, Aug 2, 1932&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1932, AGA established the [[Rock Lodge Club]] as a nudist facility in [[Stockholm, New Jersey]] and [[Ilsley Boone]], a [[Dutch Reformed]] minister, formed the [[Christian naturism]] movement. Naturism began expanding nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clothesfree.com/history.html |title=The History of Social Nudism – Nudist History |publisher=Clothesfree.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcn.ca/about-naturism/information-and-references/a-brief-history-of-naturism-nudism History of Naturism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002734/http://www.fcn.ca/about-naturism/information-and-references/a-brief-history-of-naturism-nudism |date=2013-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lupinlodge.org/history.html |title=Body Acceptance: A Brief History of Social Nudity |publisher=Lupinlodge.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019234814/http://www.lupinlodge.org/history.html |archivedate=2012-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nef.oshkosh.net/Toni_Egbert_Library/US_District_Courts/Roberts_v__Clement/roberts_v__clement.html |title=Roberts v.

The [[American Association for Nude Recreation]] (AANR) is the national naturist organization. [[Arnd Krüger]] compared nudists in Germany and the United States and came to the conclusion that in Germany the racial aspects (''Zuchtwahl'') were important for the breakthrough (e.g. the Commanding General of the Army served as patron for nudists events), while in the U.S. nudism was far more commercial and had thus more difficulties.{{sfn|Krüger|1992|p=343}} The AANR withdrew from the INF in 2010.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}{{clarify|date=September 2015}}&lt;!-- what's this mean to U.S. nudism? --&gt;

In 2008, a young adults group organized as Florida Young Naturists&lt;ref name="Florida Young Naturists FYN"/&gt; held their first Naked Bash which has since been repeated 3-4 times a year, growing into one of the largest young naturist gatherings in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/music/top-10-reasons-to-get-totally-nude-at-the-florida-young-naturists-naked-spring-bash-nsfw-6424673|title=Top 10 Reasons to Get Totally Nude at the Florida Young Naturists' Naked Spring Bash|last=|first=|date=|website=New Times Broward-Palm Beach|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a campaign to promote Nudism in the United States occurred with an effort by AANR to record the largest simultaneous Skinny Dip at several U.S. Clubs and beaches, occurring on July 11 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wreckbeach.org/archive/AANRWorldRecordSkinnyDipFinal.pdf|title=The AANR World Record Skinny-Dip|last=|first=|date=|website=Wreck beach|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, an organization called Unconstitutional Arkansas was created to highlight the unconstitutionality of laws that prohibit or impede nudism.

== In Asia ==

Generally, public nudity in Asia is not tolerated. However, some traditional, religious or cultural nudity has survived the introduction of Western moral values against nudity, such as the Jain Digambara monks in India, hot springs in Taiwan and Japan, and some traditional tribes in Papua. Nudism and naked recreation is slowly developing in some countries, mainly Indonesia (Bali) and Thailand. Nudists meet on the internet (e.g. Bareskinasia.com) and organize activities in remote or private locations. Several nudists also have their own blogs.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

=== Indonesia ===
In the seventies, nudity on [[Bali]]'s remote and deserted beaches was common but with the massive growth of tourism, this practice has disappeared. In 2002, nudity was declared illegal on Petitenget Beach, the last beach in [[Seminyak]] that tolerated discreet nudity. Individuals began to practice nudity in private villas and resorts. Laki Uma Villa, the first naturist facility to open, was for gay men only. Bali au Naturel, the first adult-only nudist resort for both genders, opened its doors in 2004. It subsequently expanded from 3 to 15 rooms and added from two more swimming pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unseen Bali|url=http://www.unseenbali.org|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nepal ===
Nudism is considered [[taboo]] in [[Nepal]]. Although there are no laws governing nudism, people may be detained, arrested and fined for public nudity. Nevertheless, many [[Hindu]] male sages practice nudism and they are not legally detained. Nudist sages can be seen in [[Pashupatinath Temple|Pashupatinath]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

=== Thailand ===
Nudism was successfully introduced 10 years ago in [[Pattaya]] (Chan Resort), and six more nudist resorts have been created all over [[Thailand]]. Barefeet Resort in Bangkok, Lemon Tree in Phuket, Oriental Village in Chiangmai, Phuan Naturist Village in Huay Yai, and Family Naturist Camp in Petchaburi all belong to the Naturist Association of Thailand as well as other international naturist organizations. A gay hotel and sauna (Sansuk Hotel) located in Pattaya now also authorizes nudity in and around the swimming pool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://66.199.190.19/~sgt/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=27690 Nudity and naturism in Pattaya] Sawatdee Gay Thailand {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206045956/http://66.199.190.19/~sgt/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=27690 |date=2014-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues in social nudity ==
{{main|Issues in social nudity}}
[[File:Naturism.jpg|thumb|A naturist  &lt;nowiki&gt;''au naturel''&lt;/nowiki&gt; ]]
Naturism addresses, challenges and explores a myriad of sometimes [[taboo]] subjects: stereotypes and mores relating to the nude appearance of the human body, mixed [[sex]] nudity, [[personal space]], [[human sexuality]], [[gymnophobia]], [[modesty]], [[physical attractiveness]], [[vanity]], [[objectification]],  exploitation and [[consent]]. It can thus be controversial. Descamps assembled a list of criticisms of naturism: it is too cold; normal bodies look ugly—it is only for the physically beautiful; it is too embarrassing; it is against the laws of nature, against the law, or against religion; "[[nudity and sexuality|nudism makes me think of sex]]"; it is for primitive people or animals.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}

Naturism can sometimes contain aspects of eroticism, although the debate about this is often simplified and seen negatively in the media and the public mind and by many modern naturists and naturist organisations. Historically the experience and discussion of erotic feelings during naturist activities such as dance and gymnastics played an important part in early Germanic naturism and formed part of its 'positive' connection with nature. However, it was when naturism arrived in the more sexually conservative cultures of the UK and the United States that the expression and discussion of eroticism within naturism became frowned upon.{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}

Smith states {{quote|the main reason younger people are not becoming naturists is the inability of modern naturism to engage with the issue of sexuality. While it is true that "naturism became popular in Germany...as a healthy outdoor lifestyle", this lifestyle also included a recognition that, socially, nudity could sometimes be erotic. It was only when naturism arrived in a more sexually conservative Britain that sexual feelings were censored out to make naturism culturally acceptable.{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}  }}  This statement is in response to the quote "The world of naturism is in trouble. Membership is falling, and fewer young people than ever are getting involved. Has the great nude adventure run its course? "{{sfn|Barkham|2007}}

Smith and King pose the [[Issues in social nudity#Sexual wellbeing|further points]] in their 2009 peer reviewed paper ''Naturism and Sexuality:broadening our approach to sexual wellbeing ''{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}

=== Issues for the naturist community ===
Many countries and states have laws which adversely affect naturists. Oftentimes, these laws are intended to address "indecent exposure", but are so broadly written that they criminalize ordinary, non-sexual nudity. Some laws, however, specifically target naturism. For example, in [[Arkansas]] in the United States, not only is nudism illegal (even on private property), it is a crime to "promote" or "advocate" (i.e. express a favourable opinion about) nudism.&lt;ref name="UnconstitutionalArkansas.org"/&gt;

Any social group is said to go through four phases:
[[Forming-storming-norming-performing|forming, storming, norming, performing]], wrote [[Bruce Tuckman]] in 1965. In this context one can understand some of the current pressures on various aspects of naturism:

* Naturist club isolation: established clubs excluding new members and rejecting new ideas.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}
* A family movement in a time of social change: a change in needs and expectations, away from one of a permanent commitment towards one of change and choice.
* Multi-gen preferences: each generation is a specific social group which needs to have its own norms that are consistent with common rules.
* Clubs vs. holiday centres: organizations with different roots find it difficult to establish common rules. The contention between those espousing a year-round commitment to an ideal, and those who see it as summer-only recreation. Club naturism is declining, while the number of people that assume naturist facilities will be available at any holiday resort is rising. The number of users of free beaches may exceed the number of people who wish to join a club.&lt;!-- Please add a statistic --&gt;
* Paid staff and volunteers: many clubs were established as cooperatives, but the values change when a few members put in the capital or work needed.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}} This became more difficult when some members were paid to act as site managers.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}
* Infiltration by other groups: for many years clubs had strict "No singles" policies to maintain the family nature of the club.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}} Many other social groups practice non-family nudism, whether it be social singles, [[Homosexuality|gay]] naturists or [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swingers]].
* [[Exhibitionism|Exhibitionists]] and [[Voyeurism|voyeurs]]: as unwelcome in a naturist community as in a clothed community.&lt;ref name="CCBN172"&gt;{{Citation  | last =Boura  | first =Malcolm    | title = Campaigning  | journal =British Naturism  | volume =BN 172  | issue =  | page = 31  | date =Summer 2007  | url =  | doi =  | id =  | issn = 0264-0406}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Risk of being filmed in nude without permission, such as at nude beach. Such photos and videos can then be put on internet.
* Sunburn and skin cancer.
*Large numbers of clothed people visit clothing optional and nudist beaches and make the naturists feel uncomfortable, "like they've become a spectacle".&lt;ref name="abc2016"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Broome nudists in battle for beach as naturism declines | last = Parke | first = Erin | work = ABC News | date = 24 July 2016 | accessdate = 2016-07-24 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-24/is-public-nudity-on-the-wane-in-australia/7653938 | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc._Getn"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Get naked or take a hike, angry nudists tell 'lookie-loos' | author =  | work = CBC News | date = 21 July 2016 | accessdate = 2016-07-24 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/nudists-canada-overexposure-turf-war-1.3689094 | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thes_Hanl"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Hanlan’s Point nudists want beach-goers to bare all | last = Botelho-Urbanski | first = Jessica | work = Toronto Star | date = 20 July 2016 | accessdate = 2016-07-24 | url = https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/07/20/hanlans-point-nudists-want-beach-goers-to-bare-all.html | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An issue, a decade ago in naturist resorts like [[Cap d'Agde]] has been the clash between "fundamentalist" naturists and the [[Swinging (sexual practice)|échangistes]] who are sexually open &lt;!--(including those who do [[oral sex]], [[group sex]] or practise [[BDSM]])--&gt; on the naturist beaches and bars.&lt;ref name="outrage"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Outraged villagers protest over open-air sex at naturist beach | author =  Kim Willsher | work = Guardian News | date = 7 Nov 2010 | accessdate = 28 Dec 2017 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/nov/07/open-air-sex-nudist-beach }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magazines ===
Magazines published by, for or purportedly about naturists can be grouped:

* Magazines published by an "official" national organisation, such as ''BN'' ([[British Naturism]]), ''Going Natural/Au naturel'' ([[Federation of Canadian Naturists|FCN/FQN]]), ''Nude &amp; Natural Magazine'' [[The Naturist Society|TNS]], ''gonatural'' (New Zealand Naturist Federation).
* Independent magazines published for naturists, such as ''Naturally'', ''[[H&amp;E naturist]]'' and ''TAN'' (acronym of ''The Australian Naturist'').
* Magazines that print photographs only or primarily of young female professional models, which are disapproved of by many naturists and non-naturists alike.

Magazines in the second and, occasionally, third grouping feature naturist editorial and advertising, while some naturists argue over which magazines belonged in which of these categories&amp;nbsp;– these views may change as publishers and editors change. Many clubs and groups have benefitted from magazines which, while not exclusively or even predominantly naturist in character, made naturist information available to many who would not otherwise have been aware of it.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}  (These days, the information and advertising provided online, and the wide availability of free online porn, has meant the disappearance of old-style 'skin' magazines presenting significant glamour content masquerading as or alongside naturist content.  Naturist magazines have to appeal strongly to naturists to succeed&amp;nbsp;– they cannot sit on the fence between naturism and glamour.)
Some naturists still feel that the worthwhile editorial content in some magazines is not a fair balance for the disapproved-of photographic content.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

=== Photography, films and videos ===
Some naturist clubs have been willing to allow filming by the media on their grounds, though content that proved not to be of genuine naturism can end up being parodied by the media as the norm.&lt;ref name=telegraph &gt;{{Citation | last = Edwards| first = Adam| author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title =  Stark naked ambition| date = 10 May 2006 | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/05/10/ftnude10.xml&amp;sSheet=/arts/2006/05/10/ixartright.html | accessdate = 2007-12-02 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | publisher = [[Sunday Telegraph]]}} gives a history of naturism, written in a personal style that attempts to use this type of humour.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commercial 'naturist' DVDs are dominated by imagery of naked children.  Such material can be marketed in ways that appear to appeal directly to paedophile inclinations, and ownership of these DVDs (and their earlier video cassette incarnations) has resulted in successful British prosecutions for possession of indecent images of children.&lt;ref name=crowther1&gt;{{Citation | title = Gay reverend fined over 'indecent' images of boys | url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/gay-reverend-fined-over-indecent-images-of-boys-26300917.html | accessdate = 3 April 2014 | work = Irish Independent }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crowther2&gt;{{Citation|title=Rector found guilty over indecent images |date=29 June 2007 |url=http://www.4ie.ie/northern_ireland_news.asp?id=63004 |accessdate=4 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304193047/http://www.4ie.ie/northern_ireland_news.asp?id=63004 |archivedate= 4 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ocarroll1&gt;{{Citation | title = Paedophile campaigner walks free | work = BBC News online | date = 26 November 2002 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2516383.stm | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One case was appealed, unsuccessfully, to the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=ocarroll2&gt;{{Citation | title = O'Carroll vs the United Kingdom | date = 15 May 2005 | url=http://echr.ketse.com/doc/35557.03-en-20050315/view/ | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precedents set by the court cases mean that possession in Britain of any naturist image of a child is, potentially, grounds for prosecution.

Photo shoots, including major high-profile works by [[Spencer Tunick]], are done on public places including beaches.{{efn|Photography in public nude beaches

Nudists who visit public nude beaches may be photographed by [[street photography|street photographers]], [[social documentary photography|social documentary photographers]], [[photojournalism|photojournalists]] or other kinds of photographers without the nudists' knowledge and in the United States and most democratic countries the photographers have the law on their side as no individual has an [[expectation of privacy]] in a [[public place]] and photographers are not required to have the naturists' consent before photographing them or publishing and selling the pictures or videos.{{sfn|NJ|2011}} In many countries there exist private nudist areas in which photography is not allowed and naturists who wish to not be photographed can enjoy their activities there. However, naturists who wish to not be photographed in public nude beaches have found various ways to make the photographers leave the beach, such as photographing the photographer and publishing such photos.

Some nude beaches provide fences that block the view from nearby streets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g147317-d155079-i25617439-Club_Ambiance-Runaway_Bay_Saint_Ann_Parish_Jamaica.html Trip Advisor]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Needs ref and maybe a naturist magazines list page --&gt;
&lt;!-- ==Terminology==
* ''Clothist'' is a term describing someone who does not practice social nudity.-- Is there a reference for this term?-- Never heard it used in Europe. Supported by Korky Day
* ''[[Gymnophobia]]'' is an irrational fear or anxiety about being seen naked, or about seeing others naked.

=== Humour ===
* A ''cottontail'' is a term describing someone whose [[buttocks]] are paler than his or her legs and back, caused by [[sun tanning]] while wearing a swimsuit. (US specific)
* In uniform, ie nude.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}
* A ''[[acomoclitism|shaved]]'' individual or ''smoothie'' is one who shaves off much of his/her body hair, including the pubic hair. This is so common now- does the word still exist? It sounds derogatory
* ''[[Topfree]]'' means bare-chested (leaving chest and breasts uncovered), or a place that allows uncovered female and male chests. The term was coined by activists to use instead of the term "topless", which has a negative connotation to some, in part because it is used by strip clubs. Naturist women felt they'd rather be "free" than "less". Topless is also used. Is this not a historical term that is no longer current? --&gt;
&lt;!-- Recent research has begun to explore this complex and historical relationship while highlighting how erotic experiences within naturism may actually enhance sexual wellbeing and be a positive force within naturism.&lt;ref name=smithking/&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- {{POV-statement|date=November 2008}} Summary of chapter 1, of Descamps which is referenced above-- this subsection is about opinions- please suggest  better wording on the talk page --&gt;
&lt;!-- See talk page for discussion of Nikki Craft- and her display of disturbing links --&gt;
&lt;!-- Those inexperienced in social nudity often say that they fear that it contributes to an imbalance of power between men and women. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} They say that women and children are more vulnerable when nude, and can be exploited.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} While that might be true in a situation of commercial nudity, such as a strip club, women advocates of social nudity assert the opposite, especially in an established nude group. The men are nude there as well, no money is changing hands, nor is anyone in any sense giving a "performance". No one pays to be nude and no one is being paid to be nude. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}  Padding --&gt;
&lt;!-- Move to new page: * [[Arkansas]], which calls itself "The Natural State" on its licence plates, has made it illegal for people to advocate nudism under code 5-68-204 section C which states:
: "''It is unlawful for any:
: ''(1)  Person, club, camp, corporation, partnership, association, or organization to advocate, demonstrate, or promote nudism; or  ''
: ''(2)  Person to rent, lease, or otherwise permit his or her land, premises, or buildings to be used for the purpose of advocating, demonstrating, or promoting nudism.''" its none too easy to do in Saudi Arabia either --&gt;
&lt;!-- Some people believe that the naked human body is to be accepted, respected, cherished, and enjoyed. They believe it is not inherently shameful, corrupting, degrading, or dangerous. Many of them enjoy clothes free activities. They reject views that being naked with other people is morally wrong ([[indecent exposure|indecent]]), [[sexual]] ''per se'' ([[erotic]] or [[pornographic]]). They argue that nakedness is a healthy, [[nature|natural]] state, that being nude is to be in the purest form, since everyone was [[birth|born]] nude. They generally find that they quickly become so accustomed to being nude among nudes that it no longer seems very remarkable. It is, rather, simply one part of their [[lifestyle]].
 --&gt;
&lt;!-- Practitioners say that they are not pruriently interested in seeing others naked (which, if for sexual pleasure, is called [[voyeurism]]) or in being seen naked by others (likewise: [[exhibitionism]]). --&gt;

An '''onion diagram''' is a kind of [[chart]] that shows the [[Dependency (project management)|dependencies]] among parts of an organization or process. The chart displays items in concentric circles, where the items in each ring depend on the items in the smaller rings.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Information==
The onion diagram is able to show layers of a complete system in a few circles. Each of the circles is able to represent a component that is dependent upon the component on the inside of it shown by the circle inside of it. The main concept of the diagram is shown by the center circle of the diagram. This chart is used due to the fact that it has a clear visual representation that is easy to read, and it has a strong visual impact.&lt;ref name=MicrosoftCorporation&gt;{{cite web|title=A quick introduction to block diagrams|url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/visio-help/a-quick-introduction-to-block-diagrams-RZ001133023.aspx?section=3|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EVAW&gt;{{cite web|title=Rainbow and onion diagrams|url=http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/1186-rainbow-and-onion-diagrams.html|publisher=End Violence Against Women|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
There is also the cultural onion which has seven layers to it including artifacts, behaviors, feelings, values, beliefs, worldview and ultimate allegiance. These layers organize a person's reality and life. The outer most layers are the most accessible while the in-depth ones are only accessible with connections to the person. The seven layers are integrated into three structural levels, which are the foundational, the evaluating, and the actualizing level.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

A '''psychological punishment''' is a type of [[punishment]] that relies not or only in secondary order on the actual harm inflicted (such as [[corporal punishment]]s or fines) but on psychological effects, mainly emotions, such as fear, shame and guilt. This can occasionally cause severe cardiac harm, even death, but those are not strictly intended, and in the case of torture accidental death would even defeat the purpose.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Psychological punishments that are particularly cruel or severe may be considered [[psychological torture]].

Very common is the use of shame through private or, especially, [[public humiliation]].

For example, publicly shaving a woman’s head may not only humiliate her in front of those who witness her shearing, it may also deprive her of her hair for as long as it takes to grow back, thus serving as a continual reminder of her punishment and her humiliation.

'''Rogneda of Polotsk''' (962–1002) is the [[Slavic (language)|Slavic]] name for '''Ragnhild''', was a Princess consort of Rus. She was the daughter of [[Rogvolod|Ragnvald]] (Slavic: [[Rogvolod]]) came from [[Scandinavia]] and established himself at [[Polatsk]] in the mid-10th century. 

==Life==
It has been speculated that Rogneda belonged to the [[Ynglings]] royal family of [[Norway]]. In or about 980, [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir]], on learning that she was betrothed to his half-brother [[Yaropolk I of Kiev]], took Polotsk and forced Rogneda to marry him. Having raped Rogneda in the presence of her parents, he ordered them to be killed, along with two of Rogneda's brothers.

Rogneda gave him several children. The four sons were [[Yaroslav the Wise]], Vsevolod, [[Mstislav of Chernigov]], and [[Izyaslav of Polotsk]]. She also bore two daughters, one of whom is named by [[Nestor the Chronicler]] as [[Predslava]] (taken as a concubine of [[Boleslaus I of Poland]], according to [[Gallus Anonymus|Gallus]]). A later chronicle tells a story, most likely taken from a [[Norse saga]], of Rogneda plotting against Vladimir and asking her elder son, Izyaslav, to kill him. As was the Norse royal custom, she was sent with her elder son to govern the land of her parents, i.e. Polotsk. Izyaslav's line continued to rule Polotsk and the newly found town of [[Izyaslavl]] until the [[Mongol invasion of Russia|Mongol invasion]].

After Vladimir converted to Christianity and took [[Anna Porphyrogeneta]] as his wife, he had to divorce all his previous wives, including Rogneda. After that, she entered the convent and took the name '''Anastasia'''.

==Legacy==
Around 1825 [[Kondraty Fyodorovich Ryleyev|Kondraty Ryleev]] wrote a narrative poem entitled ''Rogneda''.  This poem became a literary source for her portrayal in the nationalist Russian opera ''[[Rogneda (opera)|Rogneda]]'' by [[Alexander Serov]], which premiered in 1865.

{{for|self-healing in computer science|Self-management (computer science)}}
'''Self-healing''' refers to the process of recovery (generally from [[Psychology|psychological]] disturbances, [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], etc.), motivated by and directed by the patient, guided often only by [[instinct]]. Such a process encounters mixed fortunes due to its amateur nature, although self-motivation is a major asset. The value of self-healing lies in its ability to be tailored to the unique experience and requirements of the individual. The process can be helped and accelerated with introspection techniques such as [[Meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;https://nccih.nih.gov/health/meditation/overview.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Self Healing as a Way to Overcome Racial Trauma ==


Historically, communities of Color in the United States and around the World have attempted to use different modes (i.e. scholarship, art, and community gathering) to create self-healing as a way to combat the daily trauma of living in a racialized society.

[[Frantz Fanon]] wrote about the subjectivity and objectivity paradox inherent in [[Race (human categorization)|Blackness]] in his book [[Black Skin, White Masks|&lt;u&gt;Black Skin, White Masks&lt;/u&gt;.]] He describes feeling "infinite" but being subjected to the standards reserved for someone who is crippled. At the end of the fifth chapter, he writes that he weeps at the "crossroads between Nothingness and Infinity." His scholarship is meant to provide a lesson to White readers: Black people are also human beings. However, his intention in writing the fifth chapter was no doubt a hope to heal himself in offering up his struggle so that those who mistreated him and his people could reach a place of understanding. In sharing his personal trauma, he offered a way for Black people to connect over shared struggle and commiserate, but also brought his plight to the attentions of a White audience, who, if they could empathize, could lighten the racial load of the Black people around them and could hopefully, someday, ease Fanon's own mental load.

[[Langston Hughes]] is an example of how Black people have used art to self-heal from racial trauma. His poem, [https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47880/theme-for-english-b "Theme for English B"] details his struggle with completing a writing assignment about truth for a class. He is only able to complete the assignment when he acknowledges the stratified differences between him, his other classmates, and his professor. As he writes, "I am the only colored student in my class." His poem is a way to package his trauma so that he can use it for something constructive in the hopes that it will ultimately heal some of his pain.

[http://www.harrietsapothecary.com/ Harriet's Apothecary] is a NYC-based organization that seeks to create self-healing for communities of color through different healing based events. Their work takes place across the US. They host vendors, and offer reiki-healing, massages, food, and yoga among many other different "stations" as a way to combat racial trauma. They do community building work to address poverty (because [[racism in the United States]] has left communities of color in disproportionate levels of poverty compared to their White counterparts). To gain entrance to most, if not all of their events, their policy is pay-what-you-can.{{Citation needed|reason=Self Healing as a Way to Overcome Racial Trauma section has no ref|date=December 2017}}

== The Different Meanings of Self-Healing ==


Self-healing is the ultimate phase of [[Gestalt Therapy]].

Self-healing may refer to automatic, [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] processes of the body that are controlled by physiological mechanisms inherent in the organism. Disorders of the [[Gifts of healing|spirit]] and the absence of faith can be self-healed.

In a figurative sense, self-healing properties can be ascribed to systems or processes, which by nature or design tend to correct any disturbances brought into them. Such as the regeneration of the skin after a cut or scrape, or of an entire limb. The injured party (the living body) repairs the damaged part by itself.

Beyond the innate restorative capacities of the physical body, there are many factors of psychological nature that can influence self-healing. [[Hippocrates]], considered by many to be the father of medical treatment, observed: "The physician must be ready, not only to do his duty himself, but also to secure the co-operation of the patient, of the attendants and of externals."
— Hippocrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hippocrates|title=Aphorisms|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Hippocrates/aphorisms.1.i.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-healing may also be achieved through deliberately applied psychological mechanisms. These approaches may improve the psychological and physical conditions of a person. Research confirms that this can be achieved through numerous mechanisms, including relaxation, breathing exercises, fitness exercises, imagery, [[Meditation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murphy|first1=Michael|last2=Donovan|first2=Steven|last3=Taylor|first3=Eugene|title=The Physical and Psychological Effects of Meditation: A Review of Contemporary Research With a Comprehensive Bibliography|date=1997|publisher=Inst of Noetic Sciences|isbn=9780943951362}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Searchable meditation bibliography: http://biblio.noetic.org/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yoga]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthandyoga.com/html/research_papers/yt.asp&lt;/ref&gt; [[qigong]], t'ai chi, [[biofeedback]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cliving.org/biblobiof.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and various forms of [[psychotherapy]], among other approaches.

Varieties of mechanisms for self-healing have been proposed, including:

# Decreases in stress hormones that may impair physiological functions when there is [[Psychological stress|chronic stress]].&lt;ref name="General Adaptive Syndrome"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitterer|first1=Jon|last2=Coon|first2=Dennis|title=Introduction to Psychology|date=2013|publisher=Jon-David Hague|pages=446–447}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Decreases in muscle tension, which can worsen or produce pains in muscles, tendons and joints when there is chronic muscle tension due to stress.
# Improved sleep that can be achieved through relaxation, which improves physiological functions.
# Improvements in emotional tensions, depression, anger and other emotions that can otherwise impair social relationships and functioning in the workplace, leading to vicious circles of increased psychological symptoms.

Another phrase that often includes self-healing is [[self-help]]. In 2013 [[Kathryn Schulz]] examined it as "an $11 billion industry".&lt;ref&gt;

'''Social equality''' is a state of affairs in which all people within a specific society or isolated group have the same status in certain respects, including [[civil rights]], [[freedom of speech]], [[property rights]] and equal access to certain social goods and services. However, it also includes concepts of [[health equality]], [[economic equality]] and other social securities. It also includes equal opportunities and obligations, and so involves the whole of society. Social equality requires the absence of legally enforced [[social class]] or [[caste]] boundaries and the absence of [[discrimination]] motivated by an inalienable part of a person's identity.&lt;ref name="Blackford"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blackford|first1=Russell|date=July 20, 2006|title=Genetic enhancement and the point of social equality|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/689/%20Genetic%20enhancement%20and%20the%20point%20of%20social%20equality|journal=Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, sex, gender, race, age, sexual orientation, origin, caste or class, income or property, language, religion, convictions, opinions, health or disability must absolutely not result in [[equal justice under law|unequal treatment under the law]] and should not reduce opportunities unjustifiably.

''[[Equal opportunity|Equal opportunities]]'' is interpreted as being judged by ability, which is compatible with a free-market economy. Relevant problems are [[horizontal inequality]] − the inequality of two persons of ''same'' origin and ability and differing opportunities given to individuals − such as in (education) or by inherited capital.

Conceivements of social equality may vary per philosophy and individual and other than [[egalitarianism]] it does not necessarily require all social inequalities to be eliminated by artificial means but instead often recognizes and respects natural differences between people.

==Ontological==
The standard of equality that states everyone is created equal at birth is called '''ontological equality'''. This type of equality can be seen in many different places like the [[Declaration of Independence]]. This early document, which states many of the values of the [[United States of America]], has this idea of equality embedded in it. It clearly states that "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights". The statement reflects the philosophy of [[John Locke]] and his idea that we are all equal in certain [[natural rights theory|natural rights]].  Although this standard of equality is seen in documents as important as the Declaration of Independence, it is "one not often invoked in policy debates these days".&lt;ref name=YMAY&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself|date=2013|publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]|location=New York|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this notion of equality is often used to justify inequalities such as material inequality. Dalton Conley claims that ontological equality is used to justify material inequality by putting a spotlight on the fact, legitimated by theology, that "the distribution of power and resources here on earth does not matter, because all of us are equally children of God and will have to face our maker upon dying". [[Dalton Conley]], the author of ''You May Ask Yourself'', claims that ontological equality can also be used to put forth the notion that poverty is virtue. [[Luciano Floridi]], author of a book about [[information]], wrote about what he calls the ontological equality principle. His work on information ethics raises the importance of equality when presenting information. Here is a short sample of his work:
:Information ethics is impartial and universal because it brings to ultimate completion the process of enlargement of the concept of what may count as a centre of a (no matter how minimal) [[morality|moral claim]], which now includes every instance of being understood informationally, no matter whether physically implemented or not. In this respect information ethics holds that every entity as an expression of being, has a dignity constituted by its mode of existence and essence (the collection of all the elementary properties that constitute it for what it is), which deserve to be respected (at least in a minimal and overridable sense), and hence place moral claims on the interacting agent and ought to contribute to the constraint and guidance of his ethical decisions and behaviour.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Floridi|first1=Luciano|title=Very Short Introductions : Information: A Very Short Introduction|date=2010|publisher=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Floridi goes onto claim that this "ontological equality principle means that any form of reality (any instance of information/being), simply for the fact of being what it is, enjoys a minimal, initial, overridable, equal right to exist and develop in a way which is appropriate to its nature."&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;
Values in his claims correlate to those shown in the sociological textbook ''You May Ask Yourself'' by Dalton Conley. The notion of "ontological equality" describes equality by saying everything is equal by nature. Everyone is created equal at birth. Everything has equal right to exist and develop by its nature.&lt;ref name=YMAY/&gt;

==Opportunity==
{{Main article|Equality of opportunity}}

Another standard of equality is equality of opportunity, "the idea that everyone has an equal chance to achieve wealth, social prestige, and power because the rules of the game, so to speak, are the same for everyone".&lt;ref name=YMAY/&gt; This concept can be applied to society by saying that no one has a head start. This means that, for any social equality issue dealing with wealth, social prestige, power, or any of that sort, the equality of opportunity standard can defend the idea that everyone had the same start. This views society almost as a [[game]] and any of the differences in equality are due to luck and playing the "game" to one's best ability. Conley gives an example of this standard of equality by using a game of [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] to describe society. He claims that "Monopoly follows the rules of equality of opportunity" by explaining that everyone had an equal chance when starting the game and any differences were a result of the luck of the dice roll and the skill of the player to make choices to benefit their wealth. Comparing this example to society, the standard of equality of opportunity eliminates inequality because the rules of the games in society are still fair and the same for all; therefore making any existing inequalities in society fair. Lesley A. Jacobs, the author of ''Pursuing Equal Opportunities: The Theory and Practice of Egalitarian Justice'', talks about equality of opportunity and its importance relating to egalitarian [[justice]]. Jacobs states that 
:at the core of equality of opportunity... is the concept that in competitive procedures designed for the allocation of scarce resources and the distribution of the benefits and burdens of social life, those procedures should be governed by criteria that are relevant to the particular goods at stake in the competition and not by irrelevant considerations such as race, religion, class, gender, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or other factors that may hinder some of the competitors’ opportunities at success. (Jacobs, 10). 
This concept points out factors like [[race (biology)|race]], [[gender]], [[social class|class]] etc. that should not be considered when talking about equality through this notion. Conley also mentions that this standard of equality is at the heart of a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois society]], such as a modern capitalist society, or "a society of commerce in which the maximization of profit is the primary business incentive".&lt;ref name=YMAY/&gt;  It was the equal opportunity ideology that civil rights activists adopted in the era of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1960s. This ideology was used by them to argue that [[Jim Crow laws]] were incompatible with the standard of equality of opportunity.

==Condition==
{{Main article|Leveling mechanism}}
Another notion of equality introduced by Conley is equality of condition. Through this framework is the idea that everyone should have an equal starting point. Conley goes back to his example of a game of Monopoly to explain this standard. If the game of four started off with two players both having an advantage of $5,000 dollars to start off with and both already owning hotels and other property while the other two players both did not own any property and both started off with a $5,000 dollar deficit, then from a perspective of the standard of equality of condition, one can argue that the rules of the game "need to be altered in order to compensate for inequalities in the relative starting positions".&lt;ref name=YMAY/&gt;  From this we form policies in order to even equality which in result bring an efficient way to create fairer [[competition]] in society. Here is where [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] comes into play where we change society in order to give an equality of [[human condition|condition]] to everyone based on race, gender, class, religion etc. when it is made justifiable that the proponents of the society makes it unfair for them.

Sharon E. Kahn, author of ''Academic Freedom and the Inclusive University'', talks about equality of condition in their work as well and how it correlates to [[freedom]] of individuals. They claim that in order to have individual freedom there needs to be equality of condition "which requires much more than the elimination of legal barriers: it requires the creation of a [[level playing field]] that eliminates structural barriers to opportunity".&lt;ref name="CAN: UBC Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kahn|first1=Sharon|title=Academic Freedom and the Inclusive University|date=2000|publisher=CAN: UBC Press|location=Vancouver|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KSlKx1Lxlz8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=equality&amp;f=false|isbn=9780774808088}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work talks about the academic structure and its problem with equalities and claims that to "ensure equity...we need to recognize that the [[university]] structure and its organizational culture have traditionally privileged some and marginalized other; we need to go beyond theoretical concepts of equality by eliminating systemic barriers that hinder the equal participation of members of all groups; we need to create and equality of condition, not merely an equality of opportunity".&lt;ref name="CAN: UBC Press"/&gt; "Notions of equity, diversity, and inclusiveness begin with a set of premises about individualism, freedom and rights that take as given the existence of deeply rooted inequalities in social structure," therefore in order to have a culture of the inclusive university, it would have to "be based on values of equity; that is, equality of condition" eliminating all systemic barriers that go against equality.&lt;ref name="CAN: UBC Press"/&gt;

==Outcome==
{{Main article|Equality of outcome}}
A fourth standard of equality is equality of outcome, which is "a position that argues each player must end up with the same amount regardless of the fairness".&lt;ref name=YMAY/&gt;  This ideology is predominately a [[Marxist philosophy]] that is concerned with equal distribution of power and resources rather than the rules of society. In this standard of equality, the idea is that "everyone contributes to society and to the economy according to what they do best.".&lt;ref name=YMAY/&gt;  Under this notion of equality, Conley states that "nobody will earn more power, prestige, and wealth by working harder".

When defining equality of outcome in [[education]], "the goals should not be the liberal one of equality of access but equality of outcome for the median number of each identifiable non-educationally defined group, i.e. the average women, negro, or proletarian or rural dweller should have the same level of educational attainment as the average male, white, suburbanite".&lt;ref name="Palgrave Macmillan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hewitt|first1=Martin|title=Welfare &amp; Human Nature : The Human Subject in Twentieth-Century Social Politics|date=2000|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome and the benefits from equality from education from this notion of equality promotes that all should have the same outcomes and benefits regardless of race, gender, religion etc. The equality of outcome in Hewitt's point of view is supposed to result in "a comparable range of achievements between a specific [[disadvantaged]] group – such as an ethnic [[minority group|minority]], women, lone parents and the disabled – and society as a whole".&lt;ref name="Palgrave Macmillan"/&gt;

[[File:Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|right|thumb|''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' (1907), also by Picasso in a different style ("[[Picasso's African Period]]") four years later.]]In the [[visual arts]], '''style''' is a "...distinctive manner which permits the grouping of works into related categories"&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Fernie|Fernie, Eric]]. ''Art History and its Methods: A critical anthology''. London: Phaidon, 1995, p. 361. {{ISBN|978-0-7148-2991-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "...any distinctive, and therefore recognizable, way in which an act is performed or an artifact made or ought to be performed and made".&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 150&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the visual appearance of a work of art that relates it to other works by the same artist or one from the same period, training, location, "school", [[art movement]] or [[archaeological culture]]: "The notion of style has long been the art historian's principal mode of classifying works of art. By style he selects and shapes the history of art".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Kubler]] summarizing the view of [[Meyer Schapiro]] (with whom he disagrees), quoted by Alpers in Lang, 138&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Style is often divided into the general style of a period, country or cultural group, group of artists or [[art movement]], and the individual style of the artist within that group style. Divisions within both types of styles are often made, such as between "early", "middle" or "late".&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In some artists, such as [[Picasso]] for example, these divisions may be marked and easy to see, in others they are more subtle.  Style is seen as usually dynamic, in most periods always changing by a gradual process, though the speed of this varies greatly, between the very slow development in style typical of [[prehistoric art]] or [[Ancient Egyptian art]] to the rapid changes in [[Modern art]] styles. Style often develops in a series of jumps, with relatively sudden changes followed by periods of slower development.

After dominating academic discussion in [[art history]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries, so-called "style art history" has come under increasing attack in recent decades, and many art historians now prefer to avoid stylistic classifications where they can.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2; Kubler in Lang, 163–164; Alpers in Lang, 137–138; 161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Any piece of art is in theory capable of being analysed in terms of style; neither periods nor artists can avoid having a style, except by complete incompetence,&lt;ref&gt;[[George Kubler]] goes further "No human acts escape style", Kubler in Lang, 167; II, 3 in his list; Elkins, s. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and conversely natural objects or sights cannot be said to have a style, as style only results from choices made by a maker.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 177–178&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether the artist makes a conscious choice of style, or can identify his own style, hardly matters.  Artists in recent developed societies tend to be highly conscious of their own style, arguably over-conscious, whereas for earlier artists stylistic choices were probably "largely unselfconscious".&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 106–107, 107 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

Most stylistic periods are identified and defined later by art historians, but artists may choose to define and name their own style. The names of most older styles are the invention of art historians and would not have been understood by the practitioners of those styles. Some originated as terms of derision, including [[Gothic style|Gothic]], [[Baroque]], and [[Rococo]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 131; Honour &amp; Fleming, 13–14; Elkins, s. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cubism]] on the other hand was a conscious identification made by a few artists; the word itself seems to have originated with critics rather than painters, but was rapidly accepted by the artists.

Western art, like that of some other cultures, most notably [[Chinese art]], has a marked tendency to revive at intervals "classic" styles from the past.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 13&lt;/ref&gt;  In critical analysis of the visual arts, the style of a work of art is typically treated as distinct from its [[iconography]], which covers the subject and the ''content'' of the work, though for [[Jas Elsner]] this distinction is "not, of course, true in any actual example; but it has proved rhetorically extremely useful".&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 107–108, 108 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==
[[File:Ivory Egypt Louvre OA2753.jpg|thumb|left|14th-century [[Islamic art|Islamic]] ornament in ivory, centred on a [[palmette]]; [[Alois Riegl]]'s ''[[Stilfragen]]'' (1893) traced the evolution and transmission of such motifs.]]
Classical art criticism and the relatively few medieval writings on [[aesthetics]] did not greatly develop a concept of style in art, or analysis of it,&lt;ref&gt;classical authors did leave a considerable and subtle body of analysis of style in literature, especially [[rhetoric]]; see Gombrich, 130–131&lt;/ref&gt; and though Renaissance and Baroque writers on art are greatly concerned with what we would call style, they did not develop a coherent theory of it, at least outside architecture. [[Giorgio Vasari]] set out a hugely influential but much-questioned account of the development of style in Italian painting (mainly) from [[Giotto]] to his own [[Mannerist]] period.  He stressed the development of a [[Florence|Florentine]] style based on ''disegno'' or line-based drawing, rather than [[Venice|Venetian]] colour.  With other Renaissance theorists like [[Leon Battista Alberti]] he continued classical debates over the best balance in art between the [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] depiction of nature and idealization of it; this debate was to continue until the 19th century and the advent of [[Modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;See Blunt throughout, with in particular pp. 14–22 on Alberti, 28–34 on Leonardo, 61–64 on Michelangelo, 89–95 and 98–100 on Vasari&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorist of [[Neoclassicism]], [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], analysed the stylistic changes in Greek classical art in 1764, comparing them closely to the changes in [[Renaissance art]], and "[[Georg Hegel]] codified the notion that each historical period will have a typical style", casting a very long shadow over the study of style.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2; Preziosi, 115–117; Gombrich, 136&lt;/ref&gt;  Hegel is often attributed with the invention of the [[German language|German]] word ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', but he never actually used the word, although in ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]]'', he uses the phrase ''der Geist seiner Zeit'' (the spirit of his time), writing "no man can surpass his own time, for the spirit of his time is also his own spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khvwPJMzNzMC&amp;pg=PA262 |page=262 |title=The Hegel Dictionary |author=Glenn Alexander Magee |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2011 |isbn=9781847065919 |chapter=Zeitgeist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructing schemes of the period styles of historic art and architecture was a major concern of 19th-century scholars in the new and initially mostly German-speaking field of [[art history]], with important writers on the broad theory of style including [[Carl Friedrich von Rumohr]], [[Gottfried Semper]], and [[Alois Riegl]] in his ''[[Stilfragen]]'' of 1893, with [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] and [[Paul Frankl]] continuing the debate in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2, 3; Rawson, 24&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Jacobsthal]] and [[Josef Strzygowski]] are among the art historians who followed Riegl in proposing grand schemes tracing the transmission of elements of styles across great ranges in time and space. This type of art history is also known as [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], or the study of forms or shapes in art.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Semper, Wölfflin, and Frankl, and later Ackerman, had backgrounds in the history of architecture, and like many other terms for period styles, "Romanesque" and "Gothic" were initially coined to describe [[architectural style]]s, where major changes between styles can be clearer and more easy to define, not least because style in architecture is easier to replicate by following a set of rules than style in figurative art such as painting.  Terms originated to describe architectural periods were often subsequently applied to other areas of the visual arts, and then more widely still to music, literature and the general culture.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 129; Elsner, 104&lt;/ref&gt;

In architecture stylistic change often follows, and is made possible by, the discovery of new techniques or materials, from the Gothic [[rib vault]] to modern metal and [[reinforced concrete]] construction.  A major area of debate in both art history and archaeology has been the extent to which stylistic change in other fields like painting or pottery is also a response to new technical possibilities, or has its own impetus to develop (the ''kunstwollen'' of Riegl), or changes in response to social and economic factors affecting patronage and the conditions of the artist, as current thinking tends to emphasize, using less rigid versions of [[Marxist]] art history.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 131–136; Elkins, s. 2; Rawson, 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

Although style was well-established as a central component of art historical analysis, seeing it as the over-riding factor in art history had fallen out of fashion by World War II, as other ways of looking at art were developing,&lt;ref&gt;Kubler in Lang, 163&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a reaction against the emphasis on style; for [[Svetlana Alpers]], "the normal invocation of style in art history is a depressing affair indeed".&lt;ref&gt;Alpers in Lang, 137&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[James Elkins (art historian)|James Elkins]] "In the later 20th century criticisms of style were aimed at further reducing the Hegelian elements of the concept while retaining it in a form that could be more easily controlled".&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2 (quoted); see also Gombrich, 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meyer Schapiro]], [[James S. Ackerman|James Ackerman]], [[Ernst Gombrich]] and [[George Kubler]] (''[[The Shape of Time: Remarks on the History of Things]]'', 1962) have made notable contributions to the debate, which has also drawn on wider developments in [[critical theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2; analysed by Kubler in Lang, 164–165&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 [[Jas Elsner]] put it more strongly: "For nearly the whole of the 20th century, style art history has been the indisputable king of the discipline, but since the revolutions of the seventies and eighties the king has been dead",&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 98&lt;/ref&gt; though his article explores ways in which "style art history" remains alive, and his comment would hardly be applicable to archaeology.

The use of terms such as [[Counter-Maniera|Counter-''Maniera'']] appears to be in decline, as impatience with such "style labels" grows among art historians.  In 2000 Marcia B. Hall, a leading art historian of 16th-century Italian painting and mentee of [[Sydney Joseph Freedberg]] (1914–1997), who invented the term, was criticised by a reviewer of her ''After Raphael: Painting in Central Italy in the Sixteenth Century'' for her "fundamental flaw" in continuing to use this and other terms, despite an apologetic "Note on style labels" at the beginning of the book and a promise to keep their use to a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, 324&lt;/ref&gt;

A rare recent attempt to create a theory to explain the process driving changes in artistic style, rather than just theories of how to describe and categorize them, is by the [[behavioural psychologist]] [[Colin Martindale]], who has proposed an evolutionary theory based on [[Darwinian]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;Summarized in his article "Evolution of Ancient Art: Trends in the Style of Greek Vases and Egyptian Painting", ''Visual Arts Research'', Vol. 16, No. 1(31) (Spring 1990), pp. 31–47, University of Illinois Press, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20715715 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  However this cannot be said to have gained much support among art historians.

==Individual style==

Traditional art history has also placed great emphasis on the individual style of an artist: "the notion of personal style—that individuality can be uniquely expressed not only in the way an artist draws, but also in the stylistic quirks of an author's writing (for instance)— is perhaps an axiom of Western notions of identity".&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 103&lt;/ref&gt;  The identification of individual styles is especially important in the attribution of works to artists, which is a dominant factor in their [[art valuation|valuation for the art market]], above all for works in the Western tradition since the Renaissance.  The identification of individual style in works is "essentially assigned to a group of specialists in the field known as [[Connoisseur|connoisseur]]s",&lt;ref&gt;Alpers in Lang, 139, a situation she sees as problematic&lt;/ref&gt; a group who centre in the art trade and museums, often with tensions between them and the community of academic art historians.&lt;ref&gt;Exemplified in grumbling by Grosvenor; Crane, 214–216&lt;/ref&gt;

The exercise of conoisseurship is largely a matter of subjective impressions that are hard to analyse, but also a matter of knowing details of technique and the "hand" of different artists. [[Giovanni Morelli]] (1816 – 1891) pioneered the systematic study of the scrutiny of diagnostic minor details that revealed artists' scarcely conscious shorthand and conventions for portraying, for example, ears or hands, in Western [[old master]] paintings.  His techniques were adopted by [[Bernard Berenson]] and others, and have been applied to sculpture and many other types of art, for example by Sir [[John Beazley]] to [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Attic vase painting]].&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 103; [http://arthistorians.info/morellig ''Dictionary of Art Historians'': "Giovanni Morelli"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Personal techniques can be important in analysing individual style.  Though artists' training was before Modernism essentially imitative, relying on taught technical methods, whether learnt as an apprentice in a workshop or later as a student in an academy, there was always room for personal variation.  The idea of technical "secrets" closely guarded by the master who developed them, is a long-standing ''[[Literary topos|topos]]'' in art history from Vasari's probably mythical account of Jan van Eyck to the secretive habits of [[Georges Seurat]].&lt;ref&gt;Gotlieb, throughout; 469–475 on Vasari and van Eyck; 469 on Seurat.&lt;/ref&gt;   
[[File:Manner of rembrandt harmensz van rijn christ among the doctors d5343274h.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Painting of ''[[Christ among the Doctors]]'', catalogued by [[Christie's]] as "Manner of Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn" and sold for £750 in 2010]]

However the idea of personal style is certainly not limited to the Western tradition. In [[Chinese art]] it is just as deeply held, but traditionally regarded as a factor in the appreciation of some types of art, above all [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] and [[literati painting]], but not others, such as Chinese porcelain;&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 92–102; 111–119&lt;/ref&gt; a distinction also often seen in the so-called [[decorative arts]] in the West. Chinese painting also allowed for the expression of political and social views by the artist a good deal earlier than is normally detected in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Calligraphy, also regarded as a [[fine art]] [[Islamic calligraphy|in the Islamic world]] and [[East Asia]], brings a new area within the ambit of personal style; the ideal of Western calligraphy tends to be to suppress individual style, while [[graphology]], which relies upon it, regards itself as a science.

==Manner==
"Manner" is a related term, often used for what is in effect a sub-division of a style, perhaps focused on particular points of style or technique.&lt;ref&gt;"What Is Poetry?", "Petronius Arbiter"&lt;!-- pseudonym, not the Roman writer --&gt;, ''The Art World'', Vol. 3, No. 6 (Mar., 1918), pp. 506–511, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25588388 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; While many elements of period style can be reduced to characteristic forms or shapes, that can adequately be represented in simple line-drawn diagrams, "manner" is more often used to mean the overall style and atmosphere of a work, especially complex works such as paintings, that cannot so easily be subject to precise analysis. It is a somewhat outdated term in academic art history, avoided because it is imprecise.  When used it is often in the context of imitations of the individual style of an artist, and it is one of the hierarchy of discreet or diplomatic terms used in the [[art trade]] for the relationship between a work for sale and that of a well-known artist, with "Manner of [[Rembrandt]]" suggesting a distanced relationship between the style of the work and Rembrandt's own style.  The "Explanation of Cataloguing Practice" of the auctioneers [[Christie's]]' explains that "'''Manner of ...'''" in their auction catalogues means "In our opinion a work executed in the artist's style but of a later date".&lt;ref&gt;[http://christies.scene7.com/s7/brochure/flash_brochure.jsp?company=Christies&amp;sku=AMS3025_SaleCat&amp;config=Christies/eCat_210x267_Full&amp;locale=en&amp;image=Christies/AMS3025_SaleCat Christie's "Explanation of Cataloguing Practice" (after lot listings)]. "Style" is not used for paintings etc., but for European porcelain they give the example:"A plate in the Worcester style" means "In our opinion, a copy or imitation of pieces made in the named factory, place or region". For examples, [http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/19224/lot/37/ this painting, sold by Bonhams in 2011] as "Manner of Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn", is now attributed in their notes to "an anonymous eighteenth-century follower of Rembrandt". [http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/manner-of-rembrandt-harmensz-van-rijn-christ-5343274-details.aspx This example sold by Christie's] fetched only £750 in 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mannerism]], derived from the Italian ''maniera'' ("manner") is a specific phase of the general Renaissance style, but "manner" can be used very widely.

==Style in archaeology==
[[File:1911 Britannica-Archaeology-Palaeolithic.png|thumb|right|[[Paleolithic]] stone tools grouped by period]]

In [[archaeology]], despite modern techniques like [[radiocarbon dating]], period or cultural style remains a crucial tool in the identification and [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|dating]] not only of works of art but all classes of [[archaeological artefact]], including purely functional ones (ignoring the question of whether purely functional artefacts exist).&lt;ref&gt;See also Alpers in Lang, 140&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of individual styles of artists or [[artisan]]s has also been proposed in some cases even for remote periods such as the [[Ice Age art]] of the European [[Upper Paleolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;Bahn &amp; Vertut, 89&lt;/ref&gt;

As in art history, [[formal analysis]] of the [[morphology (archaeology)|morphology]] (shape) of individual artefacts is the starting point. This is used to construct [[Typology (archaeology)|typologies]] for different types of artefacts, and by the technique of [[Seriation (archaeology)|seriation]] a [[relative dating]] based on style for a site or group of sites is achieved where scientific [[absolute dating]] techniques cannot be used, in particular where only stone, ceramic or metal artefacts or remains are available, which is often the case.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thermoluminescence dating]] can be used for much ceramic material, and the developing method of [[Rehydroxylation dating]] may become widely used.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sherd]]s of [[pottery]] are often very numerous in sites from many cultures and periods, and even small pieces may be confidently dated by their style. In contrast to recent trends in academic art history, the succession of schools of archaeological theory in the last century, from [[culture-historical archaeology]] to [[processual archaeology]] and finally the rise of [[post-processual archaeology]] in recent decades has not significantly reduced the importance of the study of style in archaeology, as a basis for classifying objects before further interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Review by Mary Ann Levine of ''The Uses of Style in Archaeology'', edited by [[Margaret Conkey]] and Christine Hastorf (see further reading), pp. 779–780, ''American Antiquity'', Vol. 58, No. 4 (Oct., 1993), Society for American Archaeology, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/282229 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stylization==
[[File:Uffington-White-Horse-sat.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the very stylized prehistoric [[Uffington White Horse]] in England]]
'''Stylization''' and '''stylized''' (or "stylisation" and "stylised" in (non-Oxford) [[British English]], respectively) have a more specific meaning, referring to visual depictions that use simplified ways of representing objects or scenes that do not attempt a full, precise and accurate representation of their visual appearance (''[[mimesis]]'' or "[[Realism (arts)|realistic]]"), preferring an attractive or expressive overall depiction.  More technically, it has been defined as "the decorative generalization of figures and objects by means of various conventional techniques, including the simplification of line, form, and relationships of space and color",&lt;ref&gt;"Stylization" in the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'', 1979, online at [http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Stylization The Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and observed that "[s]tylized art reduces visual perception to constructs of pattern in line, surface elaboration and flattened space".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Willene B., ''A Medieval Book of Beasts: The Second-Family Bestiary, Commentary, Art, Text And Translation'', p. 54, 2006, Boydell Press, {{ISBN|0851156827}}, 9780851156828, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0olPRmCoE8MC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=Stylization+in+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NFqIaLTG4F&amp;sig=p-PbpnBNfgUusEYLRigTrlC3Ebc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fJo4UeflKYetPP3YgIgK&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Stylization%20in%20art&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient, traditional, and [[modern art]], as well as popular forms such as [[cartoon]]s or [[animation]] very often use stylized representations, so for example ''[[The Simpsons]]'' use highly stylized depictions, as does traditional [[African art]].  The two Picasso paintings illustrated at the top of this page show a movement to a more stylized representation of the human figure within the painter's style,&lt;ref&gt;See Elsner, 107 on Picasso as the paradigm of "the supremely self-conscious poseur in any style you like".&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Uffington White Horse]] is an example of a highly stylized prehistoric depiction of a horse.  Motifs in the [[decorative arts]] such as the [[palmette]] or [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] are often highly stylized versions of the parts of plants.

Even in art that is in general attempting mimesis or "realism", a degree of stylization is very often found in details, and especially figures or other features at a small scale, such as people or trees etc. in the distant background even of a large work.  But this is not stylization intended to be noticed by the viewer, except on close examination.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway, John, ''The Slumber of Apollo: Reflections on Recent Art, Literature, Language and the Individual Consciousness'', p. 30, 1983, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521248043}}, 9780521248044, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EuoILxxW9cQC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=Stylization+in+art&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qJw4UbeGIsS7PaHJgNAC&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Stylization%20in%20art&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt; Drawings, ''[[modelli]]'', and other sketches not intended as finished works for sale will also very often stylize.

"Stylized" may mean the adoption of any style in any context, and in [[American English]] is often used for the [[typographic]] style of names, as in "[[AT&amp;T]] is also stylized as ATT and at&amp;t": this is a specific usage that seems to have escaped dictionaries, although it is a small extension of existing other senses of the word.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Freshwater==
{{See|Water crisis}}

Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. Of this, 97.5% is the salty water of the [[ocean]]s and only 2.5% freshwater, most of which is locked up in the [[Antarctic ice sheet]]. The remaining freshwater is found in lakes, rivers, wetlands, the soil, aquifers and atmosphere. All life depends on the solar-powered global water cycle, the evaporation from oceans and land to form water vapour that later condenses from clouds as rain, which then becomes the renewable part of the freshwater supply.&lt;ref name="Atlas"&gt;Clarke &amp; King (2006) pp.&amp;nbsp;20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;  Awareness of the global importance of preserving [[water]] for [[ecosystem services]] has only recently emerged as, during the 20th century, more than half the world’s [[wetlands]] have been lost along with their valuable environmental services. [[Biodiversity]]-rich [[freshwater]] ecosystems are currently declining faster than [[marine (ocean)|marine]] or land [[ecosystem]]s&lt;ref name="water"&gt;Hoekstra, A.Y. (2006).

Greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue (harvestable) and green (soil water available for plant use) water, and this applies at all scales of water management.&lt;ref name="water" /&gt;

==Land==
{{See|Land use}}
Loss of biodiversity stems largely from the habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as [[natural capital]] is progressively converted to man-made capital. Land use change is fundamental to the operations of the [[biosphere]] because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to [[urbanisation]], [[agriculture]], [[forest]], [[woodland]], [[grassland]] and [[pasture]] have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen [[biogeochemical cycle]]s and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems.&lt;ref name="Krebs 2001 pp. 560–582"/&gt; At the local human scale major sustainability benefits accrue from the pursuit of [[green cities]] and [[sustainable gardening|sustainable parks and gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://extension.missouri.edu/publications/DisplayPub.aspx?P=G6220 Organic Gardening Techniques], ''Missouri University Extension''.

==Forests==
{{See|Forestry|Ecoforestry}}
[[File:Grib skov.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Beech forest – Grib Skov, Denmark|Beech forest – Grib Skov, Denmark]]

Since the [[Neolithic Revolution]], human use has reduced the world’s forest cover by about 47%. Present-day forests occupy about a quarter of the world’s ice-free land with about half of these occurring in the tropics&lt;ref&gt;World Resources Institute (1998). ''World Resources 1998–1999.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-521408-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In temperate and [[boreal forest|boreal]] regions forest area is gradually increasing (with the exception of Siberia), but [[deforestation]] in the tropics is of major concern.&lt;ref&gt;Groombridge &amp; Jenkins (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Forests moderate the local climate and the global water cycle through their light reflectance ([[albedo]]) and [[evapotranspiration]]. They also conserve [[biodiversity]], protect [[water quality]], preserve soil and [[soil quality]], provide fuel and [[pharmaceuticals]], and purify the air. These free [[ecosystem services]] are not given a market value under most current economic systems, and so forest conservation has little appeal when compared with the economic benefits of [[logging]] and clearance which, through [[soil degradation]] and organic [[decomposition]] returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name = FAO1&gt;Food and Agriculture Organisation (2006).

Retrieved on: 2009-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) estimates that about 90% of the carbon stored in land vegetation is locked up in trees and that they sequester about 50% more carbon than is present in the atmosphere. Changes in land use currently contribute about 20% of total global carbon emissions (heavily logged Indonesia and Brazil are a major source of emissions).&lt;ref name = FAO1/&gt; [[Climate change]] can be mitigated by sequestering carbon in [[reafforestation]] schemes, plantations and timber products. Also wood biomass can be utilized as a renewable [[carbon-neutral]] fuel. The FAO has suggested that, over the period 2005–2050, effective use of tree planting could absorb about 10–20% of man-made emissions – so monitoring the condition of the world's forests must be part of a global strategy to mitigate emissions and protect ecosystem services.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC (2006).''

[[File:ExtinctDodoBird.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|alt=Picture of the now extinct bird the dodo|The extinct [[dodo]] (''Raphus cucullatus'')]]

Although [[biodiversity loss]] can be monitored simply as loss of species, effective conservation demands the protection of species within their natural habitats and ecosystems. Following human migration and population growth, species [[extinctions]] have progressively increased to a rate unprecedented since the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]]. Known as the [[Holocene extinction event]] this current human-induced extinction of species ranks as one of the worlds six mass [[extinction event]]s. Some scientific estimates indicate that up to half of presently existing species may become extinct by 2100.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leakey &amp; Lewin (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Current extinction rates are 100 to 1000 times their prehuman levels with more than 10% birds and mammals threatened, about 8% of plants, 5% of fish and more than 20% of freshwater species.&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, pp. 42–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 [[IUCN Red List]] warns that long-term droughts and extreme weather put additional stress on key habitats and, for example, lists 1,226 bird species as threatened with extinction, which is one-in-eight of all bird species.&lt;ref&gt;Kinver, M.

In many parts of the industrial world land clearing for agriculture has diminished and here the greatest threat to biodiversity, after [[climate change]], has become the destructive effect of [[invasive species]].&lt;ref&gt;Randall (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasingly efficient global transport has facilitated the spread of [[organism]]s across the planet. The potential danger of this aspect of [[globalization]] is starkly illustrated through the spread of human diseases like [[HIV]] [[AIDS]], [[mad cow disease]], [[Avian influenza|bird flu]] and [[swine flu]], but invasive plants and animals are also having a devastating impact on native [[biodiversity]]. Non-indigenous organisms can quickly occupy disturbed land and natural areas where, in the absence of their natural [[predator]]s, they are able to thrive.&lt;ref&gt;Krebs (2001) pp. 190–205.&lt;/ref&gt; At the global scale this issue is being addressed through the [[Global Invasive Species Information Network]] but there is improved international [[biosecurity]] legislation to minimise the transmission of pathogens and invasive organisms. Also, through [[CITES]] legislation there is control the trade in rare and threatened species. Increasingly at the local level public awareness programs are alerting communities, gardeners, the nursery industry, collectors, and the pet and aquarium industries, to the harmful effects of potentially invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;Blood (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resistance to change==

The environmental sustainability problem has proven difficult to solve. The modern [[environmental movement]] has attempted to solve the problem in a large variety of ways. But little progress has been made, as shown by severe [[ecological footprint]] overshoot and lack of sufficient progress on the [[climate change]] problem. Something within the human system in preventing change to a sustainable mode of behavior. That system trait is systemic change resistance. Change resistance is also known as organizational resistance, barriers to change, or policy resistance.&lt;ref&gt;John Sterman, "Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World, 2000, pp 5-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''tensor''' is an arbitrarily complex [[geometry|geometric]] object that maps in a [[linear relation|(multi-)linear]] manner [[geometric vector]]s, [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalars]], and other tensors to a resulting tensor. Thereby, vectors and scalars themselves, often used already in elementary physics and engineering applications, are considered as the simplest tensors. Additionally, vectors from the [[dual space]] of the vector space, which supplies the geometric vectors, are also included as tensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  |title=What is a Tensor?

  |url=http://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/tensors/what_is_tensor.php
}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Geometric'' in this context is chiefly meant to emphasize independence of any selection of a coordinate system.

Elementary examples of such relations include the [[dot product]], mapping two vectors to a tensor, which is a simple scalar. A more complex example is the [[Cauchy stress tensor]] '''T''', which takes a directional unit vector '''v''' as input and maps it to the stress vector '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;('''v''')&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the force (per unit area) exerted by material on the negative side of the plane orthogonal to '''v''' against the material on the positive side of the plane, thus expressing a relationship between these two vectors, shown in the figure (right). The [[cross product]], where two vectors are mapped to a third one, is strictly speaking not a tensor, because it changes its sign under those transformations that change the orientation of the coordinate system. The [[Levi-Civita symbol|totally anti-symmetric symbol]] &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ijk}&lt;/math&gt; allows nevertheless a convenient handling of the cross product in equally oriented three dimensional coordinate systems.

Assuming a [[basis of a vector space|basis]] of a real vector space, e.g., a coordinate frame in the ambient space, a tensor can be represented as an organized [[Array data structure#Multidimensional arrays|multidimensional array]] of numerical values with respect to this specific basis. Changing the basis transforms the values in the array in a characteristic way that allows to ''define'' tensors as objects adhering to this transformational behavior. For example, there are invariants of tensors that must be preserved under any change of the basis, thereby making only certain multidimensional arrays of numbers a [[Tensor#Holors|tensor.]] Compare this to the array representing &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_{ijk}&lt;/math&gt; not being a tensor, for the sign change under transformations changing the orientation.

Because the components of vectors and their duals transform differently under the change of their dual bases, there is a [[covariant transformation|covariant and/or contravariant transformation law]] that relates the arrays, which represent the tensor with respect to one basis and that with respect to the other one. The numbers of, respectively, {{nowrap|vectors: {{mvar|n}}}} ([[covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] indices) and dual {{nowrap|vectors: {{mvar|m}}}} ([[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] indices) in the input and output of a tensor determine the ''type'' (or ''valence'') of the tensor, a pair of natural numbers {{nowrap|{{math|(''n'', ''m'')}}}}, which determine the precise form of the transformation law. The ''{{vanchor|order}}'' of a tensor is the sum of these two numbers.

The order (also ''degree'' or ''{{vanchor|rank}}'') of a tensor is thus the sum of the orders of its arguments plus the order of the resulting tensor. This is also the dimensionality of the array of numbers needed to represent the tensor with respect to a specific basis, or equivalently, the number of indices needed to label each component in that array.  For example in a fixed basis, a standard linear map that maps a vector to a vector, is represented by a matrix (a 2-dimensional array), and therefore is a 2nd-order tensor.  A simple vector can be represented as a 1-dimensional array, and is therefore a 1st-order tensor.  Scalars are simple numbers and are thus 0th-order tensors. This way the tensor representing the scalar product, taking two vectors and resulting in a scalar has order {{math|2 + 0 {{=}} 2}}, equal to the stress tensor, taking one vector and returning another {{math|1 + 1 {{=}} 2}}. The {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_{ijk}&lt;/math&gt;-symbol,}} mapping two vectors to one vector, would have order {{math|2 + 1 {{=}} 3.}}    

The collection of tensors on a vector space and its dual forms a [[tensor algebra]], which allows products of arbitrary tensors. Simple applications of tensors of order {{math|2}}, which can be represented as a square matrix, can be solved by clever arrangement of transposed vectors and by applying the rules of matrix multiplication, but the tensor product should not be confused with this.

Tensors are important in physics because they provide a concise mathematical framework for formulating and solving physics problems in areas such as [[mechanics]] ([[Stress (mechanics)|stress]], [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], [[fluid mechanics]], [[moment of inertia]], ...), [[Classical electromagnetism|electrodynamics]] ([[electromagnetic tensor]], [[Maxwell stress tensor|Maxwell tensor]], [[permittivity]], [[magnetic susceptibility]], ...), or [[general relativity]] ([[stress–energy tensor]], [[Riemann curvature tensor|curvature tensor]], ... ) and others.  In applications, it is common to study situations in which a different tensor can occur at each point of an object; for example the stress within an object may vary from one location to another. This leads to the concept of a [[tensor field]]. In some areas, tensor fields are so ubiquitous that they are simply called "tensors". 

Tensors were conceived in 1900 by [[Tullio Levi-Civita]] and [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro]], who continued the earlier work of [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[Elwin Bruno Christoffel]] and others, as part of the ''[[absolute differential calculus]]''.  The concept enabled an alternative formulation of the intrinsic [[differential geometry]] of a [[manifold]] in the form of the [[Riemann curvature tensor]].&lt;ref name="Kline"&gt;{{cite book|first=Morris |last=Kline|title=Mathematical Thought From Ancient to Modern Times: Volume 3|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-OsRDAAAQBAJ}}|date=March 1990|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-506137-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Although seemingly different, the various approaches to defining tensors describe the same geometric concept using different language and at different levels of abstraction.

===As multidimensional arrays===

A tensor may be represented as a (potentially multidimensional) array (although a multidimensional array is not necessarily a representation of a tensor, as [[Tensor#Holors|discussed below]] with regard to holors).  Just as a [[Vector space|vector]] in an {{mvar|n}}-[[dimension (vector space)|dimensional]] space is represented by a one-dimensional array of length {{mvar|n}} with respect to a given [[Basis (linear algebra)#Ordered bases and coordinates|basis]], any tensor with respect to a basis is represented by a multidimensional array.  For example, a [[linear operator]] is represented in a basis as a two-dimensional square {{math|''n'' × ''n''}} array.  The numbers in the multidimensional array are known as the ''scalar components'' of the tensor or simply its ''components''.  They are denoted by indices giving their position in the array, as [[subscript and superscript|subscripts and superscripts]], following the symbolic name of the tensor.  For example, the components of an order {{math|2}} tensor {{mvar|T}} could be denoted {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;#8239;, where {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|j}} are indices running from {{math|1}} to {{mvar|n}}, or also by {{math|''T''&amp;thinsp;{{su|b=''i''|p=''j''}}}}.  Whether an index is displayed as a superscript or subscript depends on the transformation properties of the tensor, described below. Thus while {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''T''&amp;thinsp;{{su|b=''i''|p=''j''}}}} can both be expressed as ''n'' by ''n'' matrices, and are numerically related via [[Raising_and_lowering_indices| index juggling]], the difference in their transformation laws indicates it would be improper to add them together. The total number of indices required to identify each component uniquely is equal to the [[Array data structure#Dimension|dimension]] of the array, and is called the ''order'', ''degree'' or ''rank'' of the tensor.  However, the term "rank" generally has [[tensor rank|another meaning]] in the context of matrices and tensors.

Just as the components of a vector change when we change the [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of the vector space, the components of a tensor also change under such a transformation.  Each type of tensor comes equipped with a ''transformation law'' that details how the components of the tensor respond to a [[change of basis]].  The components of a vector can respond in two distinct ways to a [[change of basis]] (see [[covariance and contravariance of vectors]]), where the new [[basis vectors]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{e}}_i&lt;/math&gt; are expressed in terms of the old basis vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_j&lt;/math&gt; as,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{e}}_i = \sum_{j=1}^n \mathbf{e}_j R^j_i = \mathbf{e}_j R^j_i .&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''R''&lt;sup&gt;'' j''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the entries of the change of basis matrix, and in the rightmost expression the summation sign was suppressed: this is the [[Einstein summation convention]], which will be used throughout this article.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The Einstein summation convention, in brief, requires the sum to be taken over all values of the index whenever the same symbol appears as a subscript and superscript in the same term.  For example, under this convention &lt;math&gt;B_iC^i = B_1C^1 + B_2C^2 + \cdots B_nC^n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The components ''v''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; of a column vector '''v''' transform with the [[matrix inverse|inverse]] of the matrix ''R'',
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{v}^i = \left(R^{-1}\right)^i_j v^j,&lt;/math&gt;
where the hat denotes the components in the new basis.  This is called a ''contravariant'' transformation law, because the vector transforms by the ''inverse'' of the change of basis.  In contrast, the components, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, of a covector (or row vector), '''w''' transform with the matrix ''R'' itself,
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{w}_i = w_j R^j_i .&lt;/math&gt;

This is called a ''covariant'' transformation law, because the covector transforms by the ''same matrix'' as the change of basis matrix.  The components of a more general tensor transform by some combination of covariant and contravariant transformations, with one transformation law for each index.  If the transformation matrix of an index is the inverse matrix of the basis transformation, then the index is called ''contravariant'' and is conventionally denoted with an upper index (superscript).  If the transformation matrix of an index is the basis transformation itself, then the index is called ''covariant'' and is denoted with a lower index (subscript). 

As a simple example, the matrix of a linear operator with respect to a basis is a rectangular array &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; that transforms under a change of basis matrix  &lt;math&gt;R = \left(R^j_i\right)&lt;/math&gt;  by  &lt;math&gt;\hat{T} = R^{-1}TR&lt;/math&gt;.  For the individual matrix entries, this transformation law has the form  &lt;math&gt;\hat{T}^{i'}_{j'} = \left(R^{-1}\right)^{i'}_i T^i_j R^j_{j'}&lt;/math&gt;  so the tensor corresponding to the matrix of a linear operator has one covariant and one contravariant index: it is of type (1,1). 

Combinations of covariant and contravariant components with the same index allow us to express geometric invariants. For example, the fact that a vector is the same object in different coordinate systems can be captured by the following equations, using the formulas defined above:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=\hat{v}^i \,\mathbf{\hat{e}}_i  = \left( \left(R^{-1}\right)^i_j  {v}^j \right)  \left( \mathbf{{e}}_k R^k_i \right) =\left( \left(R^{-1}\right)^i_j R^k_i \right) {v}^j   \mathbf{{e}}_k  = \delta_j^k {v}^j  \mathbf{{e}}_k  ={v}^k \,\mathbf{{e}}_k =
 {v}^i \,\mathbf{{e}}_i&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\delta^k_j&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]], which functions similarly to the [[identity matrix]], and has the effect of renaming indices (''j'' into ''k'' in this example). This shows several features of the component notation- the ability to re-arrange terms at will ([[commutativity]]), the need to use different indices when working with multiple objects in the same expression, the ability to rename indices, and the manner in which contravariant and covariant tensors combine so that all instances of the transformation matrix and its inverse cancel, so that expressions like &lt;math&gt;{v}^i \,\mathbf{{e}}_i&lt;/math&gt; can immediately be seen to be geometrically identical in all coordinate systems.

Similarly, a linear operator, viewed as a geometric object, does not actually depend on a basis: it is just a linear map that accepts a vector as an argument and produces another vector.  The transformation law for how the matrix of components of a linear operator changes with the basis is consistent with the transformation law for a contravariant vector, so that the action of a linear operator on a contravariant vector is represented in coordinates as the matrix product of their respective coordinate representations.  That is, the components  &lt;math&gt;(Tv)^i&lt;/math&gt;  are given by  &lt;math&gt;(Tv)^i = T^i_j v^j&lt;/math&gt;.  These components transform contravariantly, since
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\widehat{Tv}\right)^{i'} = \hat{T}^{i'}_{j'} \hat{v}^{j'} = \left[ \left(R^{-1}\right)^{i'}_i T^i_j R^j_{j'} \right] \left[ \left(R^{-1}\right)^{j'}_j v^j \right] = \left(R^{-1}\right)^{i'}_i (Tv)^i .&lt;/math&gt;

The transformation law for an order {{math|''p'' + ''q''}} tensor with ''p'' contravariant indices and ''q'' covariant indices is thus given as,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \hat{T}^{i'_1, \ldots, i'_p}_{j'_1, \ldots, j'_q} = \left(R^{-1}\right)^{i'_1}_{i_1} \cdots \left(R^{-1}\right)^{i'_p}_{i_p}
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;
  T^{i_1, \ldots, i_p}_{j_1, \ldots, j_q}
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;
  R^{j_1}_{j'_1}\cdots R^{j_q}_{j'_q}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Here the primed indices denote components in the new coordinates, and the unprimed indices denote the components in the old coordinates.  Such a tensor is said to be of order or ''type'' {{math|(''p'', ''q'')}}.  The terms "order", "type", "rank", "valence", and "degree" are all sometimes used for the same concept.  Here, the term "order" or "total order" will be used for the total dimension of the array (or its generalisation in other definitions), {{math|''p'' + ''q''}} in the preceding example, and the term "type" for the pair giving the number of contravariant and covariant indices.  A tensor of type {{math|(''p'', ''q'')}} is also called a {{math|(''p'', ''q'')}}-tensor for short.

This discussion motivates the following formal definition:&lt;ref name="Sharpe2000"&gt;{{cite book|first=R.W. |last=Sharpe|title=Differential Geometry: Cartan's Generalization of Klein's Erlangen Program|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Ytqs4xU5QKAC| page=194}}|date=21 November 2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-94732-7| page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=WROiC9st58gC}}|first=Jan Arnoldus|last=Schouten|authorlink=Jan Arnoldus Schouten|title=Tensor analysis for physicists|year=1954|publisher = Courier Corporation|isbn = 9780486655826|chapter =Chapter II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|'''Definition.'''  A tensor of type (''p'', ''q'') is an assignment of a multidimensional array
:&lt;math&gt;T^{i_1\dots i_p}_{j_{1}\dots j_{q}}[\mathbf{f}]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}\mapsto \mathbf{f}\cdot R = \left( \mathbf{e}_i R^i_1, \dots, \mathbf{e}_i R^i_n \right)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/math&gt;
}}

The definition of a tensor as a multidimensional array satisfying a transformation law traces back to the work of Ricci.&lt;ref name="Kline"/&gt;

An equivalent definition of a tensor uses the [[representation theory|representations]] of the [[general linear group]].  There is an [[group action|action]] of the general linear group on the set of all [[ordered basis|ordered bases]] of an ''n''-dimensional vector space.   If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf f=(\mathbf f_1,\dots,\mathbf f_n)&lt;/math&gt; is an ordered basis, and &lt;math&gt;R=(R^i_j)&lt;/math&gt; is an invertible &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix, then  the action is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf fR = (\mathbf f_iR^i_1,\dots,\mathbf f_iR^i_n).&lt;/math&gt;
Let ''F'' be the set of all ordered bases.  Then ''F'' is a [[principal homogeneous space]] for GL(''n'').  Let ''W'' be a vector space and let &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; be a representation of GL(''n'') on ''W'' (that is, a [[group homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\rho:\text{GL}(n)\to \text{GL}(W)&lt;/math&gt;).  Then a tensor of type &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is an [[equivariant map]] &lt;math&gt;T:F\to W&lt;/math&gt;.  Equivariance here means that
:&lt;math&gt;T(FR) = \rho(R^{-1})T(F).&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is a [[tensor representation]] of the general linear group, this gives the usual definition of tensors as multidimensional arrays.  This definition is often used to describe tensors on manifolds,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Kobayashi|first1=Shoshichi|last2=Nomizu|first2=Katsumi | title = Foundations of Differential Geometry|volume=Vol. 1| publisher=[[Wiley Interscience]] | year=1996|edition=New|isbn=978-0-471-15733-5|title-link=Foundations of Differential Geometry}}&lt;/ref&gt; and readily generalizes to other groups.&lt;ref name="Sharpe2000"/&gt;

===As multilinear maps===
{{Main|Multilinear map}}
A downside to the definition of a tensor using the multidimensional array approach is that it is not apparent from the definition that the defined object is indeed basis independent, as is expected from an intrinsically geometric object.  Although it is possible to show that transformation laws indeed ensure independence from the basis, sometimes a more intrinsic definition is preferred.  One approach that is common in [[differential geometry]] is to define tensors relative to a fixed (finite-dimensional) vector space ''V'', which is usually taken to be a particular vector space of some geometrical significance like the [[tangent space]] to a manifold.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Lee|first=John|title=Introduction to smooth manifolds|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=4sGuQgAACAAJ|page=173}}|volume=|page=173|year=2000|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-95495-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this approach, a type {{nowrap|(''p'', ''q'')}} tensor ''T'' is defined as a [[multilinear map]],
:&lt;math&gt; T: \underbrace{ V^* \times\dots\times V^*}_{p \text{ copies}} \times \underbrace{ V \times\dots\times V}_{q \text{ copies}} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; is the corresponding [[dual space]] of covectors, which is linear in each of its arguments. The above assumes ''V'' is a vector space over the [[real number]]s, '''R'''. More generally, ''V'' can be taken over an arbitrary field of numbers, ''F'' (e.g. the [[complex number]]s) with a one-dimensional vector space over ''F'' replacing '''R''' as the codomain of the multilinear maps.

By applying a multilinear map ''T'' of type {{nowrap|(''p'', ''q'')}} to a basis {'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;} for ''V'' and a canonical cobasis {'''ε'''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;} for ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;T^{i_1\dots i_p}_{j_1\dots j_q} \equiv T\left(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{i_1}, \ldots,\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{i_p}, \mathbf{e}_{j_1}, \ldots, \mathbf{e}_{j_q}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
a {{nowrap|(''p'' + ''q'')}}-dimensional array of components can be obtained.  A different choice of basis will yield different components.  But, because ''T'' is linear in all of its arguments, the components satisfy the tensor transformation law used in the multilinear array definition.  The multidimensional array of components of ''T'' thus form a tensor according to that definition.  Moreover, such an array can be realized as the components of some multilinear map ''T''.  This motivates viewing multilinear maps as the intrinsic objects underlying tensors.

In viewing a tensor as a multilinear map, it is conventional to identify the [[double dual]] ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗∗&lt;/sup&gt; of the vector space ''V'', i.e., the space of linear functionals on the dual  vector space ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, with the vector space ''V''.  There is always a [[Dual space#Injection into the double-dual|natural linear map]] from ''V'' to its double dual, given by evaluating a linear form in ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; against a vector in ''V''.  This linear mapping is an isomorphism in finite dimensions, and it is often then expedient to identify ''V'' with its double dual.

===Using tensor products===
{{Main|Tensor (intrinsic definition)}}
For some mathematical applications, a more abstract approach is sometimes useful.  This can be achieved by defining tensors in terms of elements of [[tensor product]]s of vector spaces, which in turn are defined through a [[universal property]].  A type {{math|(''p'', ''q'')}} tensor is defined in this context as an element of the tensor product of vector spaces,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Dodson|first=CTJ|title=Tensor geometry|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/344640179/Dodson-Poston-Tensor-Geometry-pdf|volume=130|year=1991|series=GTM|publisher=Springer|last2=Poston |first2=T |p= 105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Springer|id=a/a011120|title=Affine tensor}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T\in \underbrace{V \otimes\dots\otimes V}_{p\text{ copies}} \otimes \underbrace{V^* \otimes\dots\otimes V^*}_{q \text{ copies}}.&lt;/math&gt;

A basis {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of {{math|''V''}} and basis {{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of {{math|''W''}} naturally induce a basis {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the tensor product {{math|''V'' ⊗ ''W''}}.  The components of a tensor {{math|''T''}} are the coefficients of the tensor with respect to the basis obtained from a basis {{math|&lt;nowiki&gt;{&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} for {{math|''V''}} and its dual basis {{math|&lt;nowiki&gt;{&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''ε'''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;T = T^{i_1\dots i_p}_{j_1\dots j_q}\; \mathbf{e}_{i_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes \mathbf{e}_{i_p}\otimes \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{j_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{j_q}.&lt;/math&gt;
Using the properties of the tensor product, it can be shown that these components satisfy the transformation law for a type {{math|(''p'', ''q'')}} tensor.  Moreover, the universal property of the tensor product gives a [[bijection|{{math|1}}-to-{{math|1}} correspondence]] between tensors defined in this way and tensors defined as multilinear maps.

Tensor products can be defined in great generality&amp;nbsp;– for example, [[tensor product of modules|involving arbitrary modules]] over a ring.  In principle, one could define a "tensor" simply to be an element of any tensor product.  However, the mathematics literature usually reserves the term ''tensor'' for an element of a tensor product of any number of copies of a single vector space {{math|''V''}} and its dual, as above.

===Tensors in infinite dimensions===
This discussion of tensors so far assumes finite dimensionality of the spaces involved, where the spaces of tensors obtained by each of these constructions are [[naturally isomorphic]].&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The [[Dual space#Injection into the double-dual|double duality isomorphism]], for instance, is used to identify ''V'' with the double dual space ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗∗&lt;/sup&gt;, which consists of multilinear forms of degree one on ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;.  It is typical in linear algebra to identify spaces that are naturally isomorphic, treating them as the same space.&lt;/ref&gt;  Constructions of spaces of tensors based on the tensor product and multilinear mappings can be generalized, essentially without modification, to [[vector bundle]]s or [[coherent sheaves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=N. |last=Bourbaki|title=Algebra I: Chapters 1-3|chapter=3|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=STS9aZ6F204C}}|date=3 August 1998|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-64243-5}} where the case of finitely generated projective modules is treated.  The global sections of sections of a vector bundle over a compact space form a projective module over the ring of smooth functions.  All statements for coherent sheaves are true locally.&lt;/ref&gt;  For infinite-dimensional vector spaces, inequivalent topologies lead to inequivalent notions of tensor, and these various isomorphisms may or may not hold depending on what exactly is meant by a tensor (see [[topological tensor product]]).  In some applications, it is the [[tensor product of Hilbert spaces]] that is intended, whose properties are the most similar to the finite-dimensional case. A more modern view is that it is the tensors' structure as a [[symmetric monoidal category]] that encodes their most important properties, rather than the specific models of those categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0001870883710558/1-s2.0-S0001870883710558-main.pdf?_tid=7ce22fc2-ba5b-11e7-ac12-00000aab0f6b&amp;acdnat=1509028956_4fe3288701e5c7983c40dd029aaf0385 |title= Braided tensor categories |first1= A |last1=Joyal |first2= Ross |last2=Street |journal= Advances in Mathematics |year=1993 |volume=102 |pages= 20–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tensor fields===
{{Main|Tensor field}}
In many applications, especially in differential geometry and physics, it is natural to consider a tensor with components that are functions of the point in a space.  This was the setting of Ricci's original work.  In modern mathematical terminology such an object is called a [[tensor field]], often referred to simply as a tensor.&lt;ref name="Kline"/&gt;

In this context, a [[coordinate basis]] is often chosen for the [[tangent space|tangent vector space]].  The transformation law may then be expressed in terms of [[partial derivative]]s of the coordinate functions,
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{x}^i\left(x^1, \ldots, x^n\right),&lt;/math&gt;
defining a coordinate transformation,&lt;ref name="Kline"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \hat{T}^{i'_1\dots i'_p}_{j'_1\dots j'_q}\left(\bar{x}^1, \ldots, \bar{x}^n\right) =
  \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{i'_1}}{\partial x^{i_1}}
  \cdots
  \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{i'_p}}{\partial x^{i_p}}
  \frac{\partial x^{j_1}}{\partial \bar{x}^{j'_1}}
  \cdots
  \frac{\partial x^{j_q}}{\partial \bar{x}^{j'_q}}
  T^{i_1\dots i_p}_{j_1\dots j_q}\left(x^1, \ldots, x^n\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
{{see also|Dyadic tensor}}
&lt;!--NOTE: "Dyadic" is old terminology for matrix representations of rank-2 tensors which could be any of {{math|(2, 0)}}, {{math|(1, 1)}} or {{math|(0, 2)}} (which clashes with bilinear forms, inner products, metric etc.)&amp;nbsp;– its meaning is vague, unclear and confusing, and they aren't really used anymore.  Please do not add "dyadic tensor" to the table.  Thanks. --&gt;

This table shows important examples of tensors on vector spaces and tensor fields on manifolds.  The tensors are classified according to their type {{math|(''n'', ''m'')}}, where ''n'' is the number of contravariant indices, ''m'' is the number of covariant indices, and {{math|''n'' + ''m''}} gives the total order of the tensor.  For example, a [[bilinear form]] is the same thing as a {{math|(0, 2)}}-tensor; an [[inner product]] is an example of a {{math|(0, 2)}}-tensor, but not all {{math|(0, 2)}}-tensors are inner products.  In the {{math|(0, ''M'')}}-entry of the table, ''M'' denotes the dimensionality of the underlying vector space or manifold because for each dimension of the space, a separate index is needed to select that dimension to get a maximally covariant antisymmetric tensor.

Raising an index on an {{math|(''n'', ''m'')}}-tensor produces an {{math|(''n'' + 1, ''m'' − 1)}}-tensor; this corresponds to moving diagonally down and to the left on the table.  Symmetrically, lowering an index corresponds to moving diagonally up and to the right on the table.  [[#Contraction|Contraction]] of an upper with a lower index of an {{math|(''n'', ''m'')}}-tensor produces an {{math|(''n'' − 1, ''m'' − 1)}}-tensor; this corresponds to moving diagonally up and to the left on the table.

==Notation==

There are several notational systems that are used to describe tensors and perform calculations involving them. 

===Ricci calculus===

[[Ricci calculus]] is the modern formalism and notation for tensor indices: indicating [[inner product|inner]] and [[outer product]]s, [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariance and contravariance]], [[summation]]s of tensor components, [[symmetric tensor|symmetry]] and [[antisymmetric tensor|antisymmetry]], and [[partial derivative|partial]] and [[covariant derivative]]s.

===Einstein summation convention===

The [[Einstein summation convention]] dispenses with writing [[summation sign]]s, leaving the summation implicit.  Any repeated index symbol is summed over: if the index {{mvar|i}} is used twice in a given term of a tensor expression, it means that the term is to be summed for all {{mvar|i}}.  Several distinct pairs of indices may be summed this way.

===Penrose graphical notation===

[[Penrose graphical notation]] is a diagrammatic notation which replaces the symbols for tensors with shapes, and their indices by lines and curves.  It is independent of basis elements, and requires no symbols for the indices.

===Abstract index notation===

The [[abstract index notation]] is a way to write tensors such that the indices are no longer thought of as numerical, but rather are [[Indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]]s.  This notation captures the expressiveness of indices and the basis-independence of index-free notation.

===Component-free notation===

A [[component-free treatment of tensors]] uses notation that emphasises that tensors do not rely on any basis, and is defined in terms of the [[Tensor product#Tensor product of vector spaces|tensor product of vector spaces]].

==Operations==
There are several operations on tensors that again produce a tensor.  The linear nature of tensor implies that two tensors of the same type may be added together, and that tensors may be multiplied by a scalar with results analogous to the [[Scalar multiplication|scaling of a vector]].  On components, these operations are simply performed component-wise.  These operations do not change the type of the tensor; but there are also operations that produce a tensor of different type.

===Tensor product===
{{Main|Tensor product}}

The [[tensor product]] takes two tensors, ''S'' and ''T'', and produces a new tensor, {{nowrap|{{math|''S'' ⊗ ''T''}}}}, whose order is the sum of the orders of the original tensors.  When described as multilinear maps, the tensor product simply multiplies the two tensors, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;(S\otimes T)(v_1,\ldots, v_n, v_{n+1},\ldots, v_{n+m}) = S(v_1,\ldots, v_n)T( v_{n+1},\ldots, v_{n+m}),&lt;/math&gt;

which again produces a map that is linear in all its arguments.  On components, the effect is to multiply the components of the two input tensors pairwise, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;(S\otimes T)^{i_1\ldots i_l i_{l+1}\ldots i_{l+n}}_{j_1\ldots j_k j_{k+1}\ldots j_{k+m}} =
S^{i_1\ldots i_l}_{j_1\ldots j_k} T^{i_{l+1}\ldots i_{l+n}}_{j_{k+1}\ldots j_{k+m}},&lt;/math&gt;

If {{mvar|S}} is of type {{math|(''l'', ''k'')}} and {{mvar|T}} is of type {{math|(''n'', ''m'')}}, then the tensor product {{nowrap|{{math|''S'' ⊗ ''T''}}}} has type {{nowrap|{{math|(''l'' + ''n'', ''k'' + ''m'')}}}}.

===Contraction===
{{Main|Tensor contraction}}

[[Tensor contraction]] is an operation that reduces a type {{nowrap|(''n'', ''m'')}} tensor to a type {{nowrap|(''n'' − 1, ''m'' − 1)}} tensor, of which the [[trace (mathematics)|trace]] is a special case. It thereby reduces the total order of a tensor by two. The operation is achieved by summing components for which one specified contravariant index is the same as one specified covariant index to produce a new component. Components for which those two indices are different are discarded. For example, a {{nowrap|(1, 1)}}-tensor &lt;math&gt;T_i^j&lt;/math&gt; can be contracted to a scalar through
:&lt;math&gt;T_i^i&lt;/math&gt;.
Where the summation is again implied.  When the {{nowrap|(1, 1)}}-tensor is interpreted as a linear map, this operation is known as the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]].

The contraction is often used in conjunction with the tensor product to contract an index from each tensor.

The contraction can also be understood using the definition of a tensor as an element of a tensor product of copies of the space ''V'' with the space ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; by first decomposing the tensor into a linear combination of simple tensors, and then applying a factor from ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; to a factor from ''V''.  For example, a tensor
:&lt;math&gt;T \in V\otimes V\otimes V^*&lt;/math&gt;
can be written as a linear combination
:&lt;math&gt;T=v_1\otimes w_1\otimes \alpha_1 + v_2\otimes w_2\otimes \alpha_2 +\cdots + v_N\otimes w_N\otimes \alpha_N.&lt;/math&gt;
The contraction of ''T'' on the first and last slots is then the vector
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_1(v_1)w_1 + \alpha_2(v_2)w_2+\cdots+\alpha_N(v_N)w_N.&lt;/math&gt;

In a vector space with an [[inner product]] (also known as a [[Metric tensor|metric]]) ''g'', the term [[Tensor contraction#Metric contraction|contraction]] is used for removing two contravariant or two covariant indices by forming a trace with the metric tensor or its inverse.  For example, a {{nowrap|(2, 0)}}-tensor &lt;math&gt;T^{ij} &lt;/math&gt; can be contracted to a scalar through
:&lt;math&gt;T^{ij} g_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;
(yet again assuming the summation convention).

===Raising or lowering an index===
{{Main|Raising and lowering indices}}
When a vector space is equipped with a [[nondegenerate bilinear form]] (or ''[[metric tensor]]'' as it is often called in this context), operations can be defined that convert a contravariant (upper) index into a covariant (lower) index and vice versa.  A metric tensor is a (symmetric) ({{nowrap|0, 2)}}-tensor; it is thus possible to contract an upper index of a tensor with one of the lower indices of the metric tensor in the product.  This produces a new tensor with the same index structure as the previous tensor, but with lower index generally shown in the same position of the contracted upper index.  This operation is quite graphically known as ''lowering an index''.

Conversely, the inverse operation can be defined, and is called ''raising an index''.  This is equivalent to a similar contraction on the product with a {{nowrap|(2, 0)}}-tensor.  This ''inverse metric tensor'' has components that are the matrix inverse of those of the metric tensor.

==Applications==

===Continuum mechanics===

Important examples are provided by [[continuum mechanics]].  The stresses inside a [[solid body]] or [[fluid]] are described by a tensor field.  The [[Stress (mechanics)|stress tensor]] and [[strain tensor]] are both second-order tensor fields, and are related in a general linear elastic material by a fourth-order [[elasticity tensor|elasticity tensor field]].  In detail, the tensor quantifying stress in a 3-dimensional solid object has components that can be conveniently represented as a 3 × 3 array.  The three faces of a cube-shaped infinitesimal volume segment of the solid are each subject to some given force.  The force's vector components are also three in number.  Thus, 3 × 3, or 9 components are required to describe the stress at this cube-shaped infinitesimal segment.  Within the bounds of this solid is a whole mass of varying stress quantities, each requiring 9 quantities to describe.  Thus, a second-order tensor is needed.

If a particular [[Volume form|surface element]] inside the material is singled out, the material on one side of the surface will apply a force on the other side.  In general, this force will not be orthogonal to the surface, but it will depend on the orientation of the surface in a linear manner.  This is described by a tensor of [[type of a tensor|type {{nowrap|(2, 0)}}]], in [[linear elasticity]], or more precisely by a tensor field of type {{nowrap|(2, 0)}}, since the stresses may vary from point to point.

===Other examples from physics===
Common applications include

* [[Electromagnetic tensor]] (or Faraday tensor) in [[electromagnetism]]
* [[Finite deformation tensors]] for describing deformations and [[strain tensor]] for [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] in [[continuum mechanics]]
* [[Permittivity]] and [[electric susceptibility]] are tensors in [[anisotropic]] media
* [[Four-tensors]] in [[general relativity]] (e.g. [[stress–energy tensor]]), used to represent [[momentum]] [[flux]]es
* Spherical tensor operators are the eigenfunctions of the quantum [[angular momentum operator]] in [[spherical coordinates]]
* Diffusion tensors, the basis of [[diffusion tensor imaging]], represent rates of diffusion in biologic environments
* [[Quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum computing]] utilise tensor products for combination of quantum states

===Applications of tensors of order &gt; 2===
The concept of a tensor of order two is often conflated with that of a matrix.  Tensors of higher order do however capture ideas important in science and engineering, as has been shown successively in numerous areas as they develop.  This happens, for instance, in the field of [[computer vision]], with the [[trifocal tensor]] generalizing the [[fundamental matrix (computer vision)|fundamental matrix]].

The field of [[nonlinear optics]] studies the changes to material [[Polarization density#Relation between P and E in various materials|polarization density]] under extreme electric fields.  The polarization waves generated are related to the generating [[electric field]]s through the nonlinear susceptibility tensor.  If the polarization '''P''' is not linearly proportional to the electric field '''E''', the medium is termed ''nonlinear''.  To a good approximation (for sufficiently weak fields, assuming no permanent dipole moments are present), '''P''' is given by a [[Taylor series]] in '''E''' whose coefficients are the nonlinear susceptibilities:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{P_i}{\varepsilon_0} = \sum_j  \chi^{(1)}_{ij} E_j  +  \sum_{jk} \chi_{ijk}^{(2)} E_j E_k + \sum_{jk\ell} \chi_{ijk\ell}^{(3)} E_j E_k E_\ell  + \cdots. \!&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\chi^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; is the linear susceptibility, &lt;math&gt;\chi^{(2)}&lt;/math&gt; gives the [[Pockels effect]] and  [[second harmonic generation]], and &lt;math&gt;\chi^{(3)}&lt;/math&gt; gives the [[Kerr effect]].  This expansion shows the way higher-order tensors arise naturally in the subject matter.

==Generalizations==

===Holors===

As discussed above, a tensor can be represented as a (potentially multidimensional, multi-indexed) array of quantities. To distinguish tensors (when denoted as tensorial arrays of quantities with respect to a fixed basis) from arbitrary arrays of quantities the term [[Parry_Moon#Holors|''holor'']] was coined for the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Moon
 | first = Parry Hiram
 | author-link1 = Parry Moon
 | last2 = Spencer
 | first2 = Domina Eberle
 | author-link2 = Domina Eberle Spencer 
 | title = Theory of Holors: A Generalization of Tensors
 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]
 | date = 1986
 | isbn = 978-0-521-01900-2
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

So tensors can be analyzed as a particular type of holor, alongside other not strictly tensorial holors, such as neural network (node and/or link) values, indexed inventory tables, and so on. Another group of holors that transform like tensors up to a so called ''weight'', derived from the transformation equations, are the [[tensor density|tensor densities]], e.g. the Levi-Civita Symbol. The [[Christoffel symbols]] also belong to the holors.

The term ''holor'' is not in widespread use, and unfortunately the word "tensor" is often misused when referring to the multidimensional array representation of a holor, causing confusion regarding the strict meaning of ''tensor''. 

The concept of holors and the associated terminology provide an algebra and calculus for holors in a more general setting than what is seen for tensorial arrays.

===Tensor products of vector spaces===
The vector spaces of a [[tensor product]] need not be the same, and sometimes the elements of such a more general tensor product are called "tensors".  For example, an element of the tensor product space {{math|''V'' ⊗ ''W''}} is a second-order "tensor" in this more general sense,&lt;ref name="Maia2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=M. D. |last=Maia|title=Geometry of the Fundamental Interactions: On Riemann's Legacy to High Energy Physics and Cosmology|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=wEWw_vGBDW8C|page=48}}
|year=2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4419-8273-5|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an order-{{math|''d''}} tensor may likewise be defined as an element of a tensor product of {{math|''d''}} different vector spaces.&lt;ref name="Hogben2013"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Er7MBQAAQBAJ|page=7}}|title=Handbook of Linear Algebra, Second Edition|last=|first=|publisher=CRC Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4665-0729-6|editor-last=Hogben|editor-first=Leslie|edition=2nd|location=|pages=15–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A type {{math|(''n'', ''m'')}} tensor, in the sense defined previously, is also a tensor of order {{math|''n'' + ''m''}} in this more general sense.  The concept of tensor product [[tensor product of modules|can be extended]] to arbitrary [[module over a ring|modules over a ring]].

===Tensors in infinite dimensions===
The notion of a tensor can be generalized in a variety of ways to [[Dimension (vector space)|infinite dimensions]].  One, for instance, is via the [[tensor product of Hilbert spaces|tensor product]] of [[Hilbert space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Segal | first1 = I. E. | last2 =  | first2 =  | date=January 1956 | title = Tensor Algebras Over Hilbert Spaces.

===Tensor densities===
{{main|Tensor density}}
Suppose that a homogeneous medium fills {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, so that the density of the medium is described by a single [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] value {{math|&amp;rho;}} in {{math|kg m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  The mass, in kg, of a region {{math|&amp;Omega;}} is obtained by multiplying {{math|&amp;rho;}} by the volume of the region {{math|&amp;Omega;}}, or equivalently integrating the constant {{math|&amp;rho;}} over the region:
:&lt;math&gt;m=\int_\Omega \rho\, dx\,dy\,dz&lt;/math&gt;
where the Cartesian coordinates {{math|''xyz''}} are measured in m.  If the units of length are changed into cm, then the numerical values of the coordinate functions must be rescaled by a factor of 100:
:&lt;math&gt;x'=100 x,\quad y'=100y,\quad z'=100z&lt;/math&gt;
The numerical value of the density {{math|&amp;rho;}} must then also transform by &lt;math&gt;100^{-3}m^3/cm^3&lt;/math&gt; to compensate, so that the numerical value of the mass in kg is still given by integral of &lt;math&gt;\rho\, dx\,dy\,dz&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus &lt;math&gt;\rho'=100^{-3}\rho&lt;/math&gt; (in units of {{math|kg cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}).

More generally, if the Cartesian coordinates {{math|''xyz''}} undergo a linear transformation, then the numerical value of the density {{math|&amp;rho;}} must change by a factor of the reciprocal of the absolute value of the [[determinant]] of the coordinate transformation, so that the integral remains invariant, by the [[change of variables formula]] for integration. Such a quantity that scales by the reciprocal of the absolute value of the determinant of the coordinate transition map is called a [[scalar density]].  To model a non-constant density, {{math|&amp;rho;}} is a function of the variables {{math|''xyz''}} (a [[scalar field]]), and under a curvilinear change of coordinates, it transforms by the reciprocal of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] of the coordinate change. For more on the intrinsic meaning, see [[Density on a manifold]].

A tensor density transforms like a tensor under a coordinate change, except that it in addition picks up a factor of the absolute value of the determinant of the coordinate transition:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Jan Arnoldus|last=Schouten|authorlink=Jan Arnoldus Schouten|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=WROiC9st58gC}}|title=Tensor analysis for physicists}}, §II.8: Densities.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  T^{i'_1\dots i'_p}_{j'_1\dots j'_q}[\mathbf{f} \cdot R] = |\det R|^{-w}\left(R^{-1}\right)^{i'_1}_{i_1} \cdots \left(R^{-1}\right)^{i'_p}_{i_p}
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;
  T^{i_1, \ldots, i_p}_{j_1, \ldots, j_q}[\mathbf{f}]
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;
  R^{j_1}_{j'_1}\cdots R^{j_q}_{j'_q} .
&lt;/math&gt;
Here ''w'' is called the weight.  In general, any tensor multiplied by a power of this function or its absolute value is called a tensor density, or a weighted tensor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Applications of tensor analysis|first=AJ |last=McConnell|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ZCP0AwAAQBAJ}}|publisher=Dover|year=1957|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kay|1988|p=27}} An example of a tensor density is the [[current density]] of [[electromagnetism]].

Under an affine transformation of the coordinates, a tensor transforms by the linear part of the transformation itself (or its inverse) on each index.  These come from the [[rational representation]]s of the general linear group.  But this is not quite the most general linear transformation law that such an object may have: tensor densities are non-rational, but are still [[semisimple]] representations.  A further class of transformations come from the logarithmic representation of the general linear group, a reducible but not semisimple representation,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Peter |last=Olver|title=Equivalence, invariants, and symmetry|url=
{{google books |plainurl=y |id=YuTzf61HILAC|page=77}}|page=77|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of an {{math|(''x'',''y'') &amp;isin; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} with the transformation law
:&lt;math&gt;(x,y)\mapsto (x+y\log|\det R|,y).&lt;/math&gt;

===Geometric objects===
The transformation law for a tensor behaves as a [[functor]] on the category of admissible coordinate systems, under general linear transformations (or, other transformations within some class, such as [[local diffeomorphism]]s.)  This makes a tensor a special case of a geometrical object, in the technical sense that it is a function of the coordinate system transforming functorially under coordinate changes.&lt;ref&gt;Haantjes, J., &amp; [[Gerard Laman|Laman, G.]] (1953). On the definition of geometric objects. I.&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of objects obeying more general kinds of transformation laws are [[jet (mathematics)|jets]] and, more generally still, [[natural bundle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Albert|last=Nijenhuis|authorlink=Albert Nijenhuis|url=http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1958/Main/icm1958.0463.0469.ocr.pdf|chapter=Geometric aspects of formal differential operations on tensor fields|title= Proc.

===Spinors===
{{Main|Spinor}}
When changing from one [[orthonormal basis]] (called a ''frame'') to another by a rotation, the components of a tensor transform by that same rotation.  This transformation does not depend on the path taken through the space of frames.  However, the space of frames is not [[simply connected]] (see [[orientation entanglement]] and [[plate trick]]): there are continuous paths in the space of frames with the same beginning and ending configurations that are not deformable one into the other.  It is possible to attach an additional discrete invariant to each frame that incorporates this path dependence, and which turns out (locally) to have values of ±1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The road to reality: a complete guide to the laws of our universe|url=

Succinctly, spinors are elements of the [[spin representation]] of the rotation group, while tensors are elements of its [[tensor representation]]s.  Other [[classical groups]] have tensor representations, and so also tensors that are compatible with the group, but all non-compact classical groups have infinite-dimensional unitary representations as well.

==History==
The concepts of later tensor analysis arose from the work of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in differential geometry, and the formulation was much influenced by the theory of [[algebraic form]]s and invariants developed during the middle of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Tensor calculus was developed around 1890 by [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro]] under the title ''absolute differential calculus'', and originally presented by Ricci in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In the 20th century, the subject came to be known as ''tensor analysis'', and achieved broader acceptance with the introduction of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]], around 1915.  General relativity is formulated completely in the language of tensors.  Einstein had learned about them, with great difficulty, from the geometer [[Marcel Grossmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Levi-Civita then initiated a correspondence with Einstein to correct mistakes Einstein had made in his use of tensor analysis.  The correspondence lasted 1915–17, and was characterized by mutual respect:

Tensors were also found to be useful in other fields such as [[continuum mechanics]].  Some well-known examples of tensors in [[differential geometry]] are [[quadratic form]]s such as [[metric tensor]]s, and the [[Riemann curvature tensor]].  The [[exterior algebra]] of [[Hermann Grassmann]], from the middle of the nineteenth century, is itself a tensor theory, and highly geometric, but it was some time before it was seen, with the theory of [[differential form]]s, as naturally unified with tensor calculus.  The work of [[Élie Cartan]] made differential forms one of the basic kinds of tensors used in mathematics.

From about the 1920s onwards, it was realised that tensors play a basic role in [[algebraic topology]] (for example in the [[Künneth theorem]]).&lt;ref name="Spanier2012"&gt;{{cite book|first=Edwin H. |last=Spanier|title=Algebraic Topology|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=iKx3BQAAQBAJ&amp;|page=227}}|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4684-9322-1|pages=227|quote=the  Künneth formula expressing the homology of the tensor product...}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Correspondingly there are types of tensors at work in many branches of [[abstract algebra]], particularly in [[homological algebra]] and [[representation theory]].  Multilinear algebra can be developed in greater generality than for scalars coming from a [[field (mathematics)|field]].  For example, scalars can come from a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]].  But the theory is then less geometric and computations more technical and less algorithmic.&lt;ref name="Hungerford2003"&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas W. |last=Hungerford|authorlink=Thomas W.

'''Trans bashing''' is the act of [[victimizing]] a person emotionally, physically, sexually, or verbally because they are [[transgender]] or [[Transsexualism|transsexual]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20774504-5005961,00.html Guilty plea over transsexual bashing] By Mariza O'Keefe in ''Herald Sun''&lt;/ref&gt;  The term has also been applied to [[hate speech]] directed at transgender people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2007/4-27/view/columns/10484.cfm|title=Page not found - Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights|website=Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at depictions of transgender people in the media that reinforce negative stereotypes about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mary|last=McNamara|title=Transgender Artists, Work Gaining Acceptance|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2001-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discrimination, including physical or sexual violence against trans people due to [[transphobia]] or [[homophobia]], is a common occurrence for trans people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040612144850/http://www.opha.on.ca/ppres/2003-06_pp.pdf|title=2003-06_pp.pdf|website=docs.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, D.B.

interpreting anti-transgender violence. In B. Wallace, &amp; R. Carter (Eds.). A multicultural

educators. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Namaste, V.K. (2000a). Invisible lives: The erasure of transsexual and transgendered people. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Hate crimes against trans people are common even recently, and "in some instances, inaction by police or other government officials leads to the untimely deaths of transgender victims."&lt;ref name="cider"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frye|first=Phyllis|date=Fall 2000|title=The International Bill of Gender Rights vs. The Cide House Rules: Transgenders struggle with the courts over what clothing they are allowed to wear on the job, which restroom they are allowed to use on the job, their right to marry, and the very definition of their sex|journal=William and Mary Journal of Women and the Law|volume=7|pages=139–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most infamous incidents was the December 1993 rape and murder of [[Brandon Teena]], a young [[trans man]], by two male friends after they found out that he had been assigned female at birth.&lt;ref name="trutv5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/not_guilty/brandon/5.html|title=Teena Brandon|last=Ramsland|first=Katherine|publisher=[[TruTV]]|pages=5|accessdate=2009-02-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214094602/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/not_guilty/brandon/5.html|archivedate=2013-12-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events became internationally known when told in the feature film ''[[Boys Don't Cry (film)|Boys Don't Cry]]'', which earned [[Hilary Swank]] an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].

== Differentiation from gay bashing ==

Unlike [[gay bashing]], trans bashing is committed because of the target's actual or perceived [[gender identity]], not [[sexual orientation]].{{Dubious |Not about gender identity |reason=No, it's because of their transgressive gender expression, irrespective of a cis or trans identity |date=December 2017}}  However, a trans person may be gay bashed if the person perceives them as gay rather than transgender.{{cn |date=December 2017}}

At least since the [[Stonewall riots]] in 1969, people from the greater trans communities have often been politically aligned with the lesbian, gay, and bisexual communities.&lt;ref&gt;Kay Dayus, Transgenders Protest HRC Exec's Visit to Houston, Hous. Voice, Sept. 29, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  However, researchers and some activists from the greater trans communities argue trans bashing should be categorized separately from violence committed on the basis of sexual orientation ("gay-bashing").&lt;ref name="cider"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discrimination and Hate Crimes Against Gender Variant People, It's Time Illinois . . . Political Action for the Gender Variant Community (May 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-trans bias crimes have been conceptually and characteristically distinguished from homophobic crimes in the scholarly research.&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Transgender Hate Crimes: The Challenge for Law Enforcement, at http://jointheimpactma.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Victimization-Study-Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; One argument is that conflating violence against trans peoples with violence against gay people erases the identities of people in the greater trans communities and the truth of what happens to them.  However, campaigns against gay bashing and trans bashing are often seen as a common cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workers.org/ww/1998/bashing1008.php|title=Workers World Oct. 8, 1998: Zero tolerance for gay-trans bashing|website=www.workers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one case, perpetrators accused of hate crimes against trans people have tried to use a [[trans panic]] defense, an extension of [[gay panic defense]].&lt;ref name="TRTH"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SiaNoJ3puyQC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=%22gwen+araujo%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA47,M1 ''Transpeople: Repudiation, Trauma, Healing''] by Christopher A. Shelley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TMCIAC"&gt;[http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=153 "Two murder convictions in Araujo case"], Zak Szymanski; ''[[Bay Area Reporter]]'' 15 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  The jury deadlocked, but there is evidence they rejected the trans-panic defense.  One law journal provided an analysis of the trans-panic defense, arguing in part that the emotional premise of a trans panic defense (shock at discovering unexpected genitals) is different from the emotional premise of a gay panic defense (shock at being propositioned by a member of the same sex, perhaps because of one's repressed homosexuality).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Steinberg|first=Victoria L.|date=Spring 2005|title=A Heat of Passion Offense: Emotions and Bias in "Trans Panic" Mitigation Claims: Hiding From Humanity|journal=Boston College Third World Law Journal|volume=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Laws covering gender identity ==

===International===
The United Nations adopted their [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948 as the first global declaration of human rights.&lt;ref name=UDHR&gt;{{cite web|title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr|website=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of articles in the declaration that have been suggested to specifically pertain to transgender people and violence (including, but not limited to, physical, psychological, legal, systemic, emotional, and political violence), although LGBT rights are not explicitly outlined in the document.

* Article 2 entitles individuals to all of the rights and freedoms set forth in the declaration "without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status". 
* Article 5 states that "[n]o one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."
* Article 7 states that "[a]ll are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination". 
* Article 9 bans "arbitrary arrest, detention or exile" (which, according to Article 2, is protected from distinction based on identity or belief).
* Article 20 states that "[e]veryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."&lt;ref name="AI Human Rights"&gt;{{cite web|title=About LGBT Human Rights|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/lgbt-rights/about-lgbt-human-rights|website=amnestyusa.org|publisher=Amnesty International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===

====United States====
[[File:Map of LGBT-related hate crime law in the United States.svg|thumb|right|Current U.S. LGBT [[hate crimes laws in the United States|hate crimes laws]] by state. A national hate crimes law encompasses both sexual orientation and gender identity.
{{legend|#800080|Sexual orientation and gender identity recognized in state hate crimes law}}
{{legend|#0000ff|Sexual orientation recognized in state hate crimes law}}
{{legend|#00ffff|Sexual orientation recognized for data collection about hate crimes}}
{{legend|#cccccc|State hate crimes law uninclusive of sexual orientation or gender identity}}]]

In the United States, currently seventeen states plus the District of Columbia have hate crime laws protecting people victimized on the basis of their gender identity (they are [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Hawaii]], [[Illinois]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], [[Nevada]], [[New Jersey]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oregon]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Vermont]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/hate_crime_laws|title=Hate Crime Laws}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 2000s in [[Seattle]]'s [[gay village]] of [[Capitol Hill, Seattle, Washington|Capitol Hill]], there was evidence of an increase in incidents of trans bashing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectator.seattleu.edu/news/story.aspx?ID=14050|title=Gentrification ousting local gay community|last=Holt|first=Emily|publisher=The Spectator|accessdate=2 January 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502105800/http://spectator.seattleu.edu/news/story.aspx?ID=14050|archivedate=2 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Matthew Shepard Act]] expanded the federal hate crime laws to include gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation. In order to qualify as a federal hate crime in the United States, the crime must include successful or attempted bodily injury due to the use of firearm, explosives, weapons, fire, or incendiary devices.&lt;ref name="18 U.S. Code § 249 (a)(2) (a) – “Hate Crime Acts”"&gt;{{cite web|title=18 U.S. Code § 249 (a)(2) (a) – "Hate Crime Acts"|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/pdf/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap13-sec249.pdf|website=Government Publishing Office|publisher=Government Publishing Office|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hate crimes are covered by state, rather than federal laws unless the victim or defendant travel across state lines or national borders; using an interstate commuting route; the weapon has been brought across state lines; or if the conduct interferes with or otherwise affects commerce across state lines.&lt;ref name="18 U.S. Code § 249 (a)(2) (a) – “Hate Crime Acts”" /&gt; This means that, unless hate crimes under the federal definition occur in a way that does not just affect one state, states have the freedom to implement their own hate crime laws. The protections of these laws range widely. Pennsylvania, for example, has not included gender identity in their hate crime protections since it was rescinded from the law in 2008.&lt;ref name="Philadelphia Hate Crime Laws"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giampolo|first1=Angela|title=Changing the State of Hate Crime-Laws in Philadelphia|url=http://www.thelegalintelligencer.com/id=1202671537351/Changing-the-State-of-HateCrime-Laws-in-Pennsylvania?slreturn=20140923231944|accessdate=28 April 2015|agency=The Legal Intelligencer|publisher=The Legal Intelligencer|date=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====='Bathroom bills' to enforce gendered bathroom use=====

{{Main article|Bathroom bill}}

Bathroom bills are bills proposed with relation to bathroom access and gender identity.&lt;ref name="Bathroom bills definition"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sprigg|first1=Peter|title="Gender Identity" Protections  ("Bathroom Bills")|url=http://www.frc.org/onepagers/gender-identity-protections-bathroom-bills|website=Family Research Council|publisher=Family Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a number of [[Bathroom_bill#United_States|bills proposed in the United States]] intended to limit access to restrooms for those who do not identify with the sex on their birth certificate. Some of these bills are justified with the rationale of protecting cisgender women from violent acts committed by cisgender men entering their facilities under the pretense of identifying as transgender women, although there is no evidence thus far of any incidences of this.&lt;ref name="Florida lawmaker"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bixby|first1=Scott|title=This Lawmaker Wants to Make It Illegal for Transgender People to Use Bathrooms|url=http://mic.com/articles/110314/this-lawmaker-wants-to-make-it-illegal-for-trans-people-to-use-bathrooms|publisher=Mic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Debunking myth about bathroom bills"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maza|first1=Carlos|title=Debunking The Big Myth About Transgender-Inclusive Bathrooms|url=http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/03/20/debunking-the-big-myth-about-transgender-inclus/198530|agency=Media Matters for America}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Effects of bathroom bills"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brinker|first1=Luke|title=One Month Later: How California's Transgender Student Law Is Affecting Public Schools|url=http://equalitymatters.org/blog/201401310002|agency=Equality Matters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some transgender people are content, and may even prefer, using [[Unisex_public_toilet|gender-neutral bathrooms]], but others expect the right to use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify. The Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network found that singling out trans students by offering them alternative facility options may backfire by increasing their chances of disengaging from school or dropping out entirely.&lt;ref name="GLSEN Study trans in school"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harsh Realities: The Experiences of Transgender Youth in Our Nation|url=http://glsen.org/sites/default/files/Harsh%20Realities.pdf|website=Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network|publisher=GLSEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Harassment of transgender people in bathrooms=====

It is transgender people who are likely to be harassed in bathrooms by cisgender people, not the other way around. In one survey, 70 percent of the transgender respondents had faced discrimination when attempting to use a restroom of their gender identity, including "denial of access to facilities, verbal harassment, and physical assault."&lt;ref name="Williams Institute Study Bathroom access"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herman|first1=Jody|title=Williams Institute|url=http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Herman-Gendered-Restrooms-and-Minority-Stress-June-2013.pdf|publisher=Williams Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such harassment occurred in 2018, when [[United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_California,_2018#District_44|California Republican Congressional candidate Jazmina Saavedra]] said she heard the "voice of a man" from a locked stall in the women's restroom of a fast-food restaurant in Los Angeles and filmed herself chasing the person out of the restaurant with assistance from the restaurant manager. In the video, Saavedra said she was prepared to use pepper spray and a stungun against the transgender woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Broverman|first1=Neal|title=Trump Supporter Broadcasts Live as She Chases Trans Woman Out of Bathroom|url=https://www.advocate.com/transgender/2018/5/17/trump-supporter-broadcasts-live-she-chases-trans-woman-out-bathroom|accessdate=18 May 2018|publisher=The Advocate|date=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of tactic can result in public [[outing]] of a transgender person's current or former gender identity.

===Europe===

====Malta====

Malta passed the 'Gender Identity, Gender Expression, and Sex Characteristics Act in 2015. This bill states that all citizens of Malta have the right to
# The recognition of their gender identity;
# The free development of their person according to their gender identity;
# Be treated according to their gender identity and, particularly, to be identified in that way in the documents providing their identity therein; and
# Bodily integrity and physical autonomy.&lt;ref name="Malta Transgender Bill" /&gt;

This act protects the gender identity of a person at all times. It also states that "person shall not be required to provide proof of a surgical procedure for total or partial genital reassignment, hormonal therapies or any other psychiatric, psychological or medical treatment to make use of the right to gender identity." The act allows parents to postpone listing gender on a child's birth certificate and prohibits “non-medically necessary treatments on the sex characteristics of a person.”&lt;ref name="Malta Transgender Bill"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act (Malta, 2015)|url=http://tgeu.org/gender-identity-gender-expression-sex-characteristics-act-malta-2015/|website=Transgender Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Explanation of Malta Gender Identity Law"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Identity, Gender Expression And Sex Characteristics Act|url=http://socialdialogue.gov.mt/en/Public_Consultations/MSDC/Pages/Consultations/GIGESC.aspx|publisher=Social Dialogue Malta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==

Media can contribute to trans bashing through misinformation and scare tactics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6266">The '''Women Power Line 1090''' is a [[Interactive voice response|IVRS]] based dedicated service in [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]], to empower women from all forms of [[harassment]] and ensure their safety in society.&lt;ref name="Women Power Line 1090 in The Times of India"&gt;{{cite news|title=Women power line to get ‘power angels’ soon|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/Women-power-line-to-get-power-angels-soon/articleshow/46686693.cms|accessdate=2016-02-01|newspaper=The Times of India|date=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1090 is a toll-free number that provides immediate help to the harassed women suffering from an antisocial behaviour or any other format of assistance which is sought. This helpline handles the cases of offense against women and ensures speedy protection to women and girls.

== History ==
''Women Power Line'' was initiated by the Uttar Pradesh Government under the leadership of [[Akhilesh Yadav]], the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, on November 15, 2012 which is being operated by the Uttar Pradesh Police department headed by Navniet Sekera. The service was started to deal with the crime against women and to control the antisocial activities against women happening in the state of Uttar Pradesh. The idea came to light when the cases of ragging started to increase in universities.&lt;ref name="Women Power Line 1090 in Amajurala"&gt;{{cite news|title=Women Power Helpline Number 1090 starts in Uttar Pradesh|url=http://www.amarujala.com/news/samachar/national/women-power-helpline-number-1090-starts-in-uttar-pradesh/|accessdate=2016-02-01|newspaper=Amajurala|date=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past three years (till 25 March 2015), about 3,230 cases have been registered of which around 3,170 cases have been successfully solved.

== Purpose and mission ==
The helpline has been launched with the purpose of providing effective help to girls/women who become victims of any antisocial behaviour like eve-teasing, harassment, disrespect, or any other form of violence. The WPL personnel first goes for a counselling and then takes due legal action against the offender. 
The mission of Women Powerline is to bring a revolutionary change in controlling crimes against women and creating a society where women can protest against harassment and molestation with courage.&lt;ref name="Women Power Line 1090 in NGO Express"&gt;{{cite news|title=Women Power Helpline in NGO Express|url=http://www.ngoexpress.com/big-issuedetails.aspx?Id=22|accessdate=2016-02-01|newspaper=NGO Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To resolve the cases of harassment, the state police have set up an ultra-modern powerline and trained women police personnel to redress the cases of social harassment. The victim women can dial 1090 which is accessible from any telephone or mobile number to lodge complaints against harassment. A special team of women constables attend the calls and provide timely help to victims. The women constables, have received sensitivity and physiological training to ensure a safe and secure environment for all the callers. The identity of the caller is kept secret at all times.&lt;ref name="Women Power Line 1090 in Firstpost"&gt;{{cite news|title=Women Power Helpline in Firstpost|url=http://www.firstpost.com/topic/place/uttar-pradesh-cm-akhilesh-yadav-inaugurated-women-power-line-1090-aaj-ki-khabar-video-Ox0YXxQXa00-91628-1.html|accessdate=2016-02-01|newspaper=Firstpost|date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire process is divided into stars which acts as a measure at each stage:

*'''One star''': The victim registers her complaint by calling on 1090. The women constable there would register her complaint with all the details and the number through which she has been harassed. This number is then transferred to a male cop.
*'''Two star''': The male cop would send a first level warning to the accused. All the details cited by the victim is then narrated to the accused with much needed proof of acquisition. He might even be sent for counselling if need be. The details of the women are not shared with the accused.
*'''Three star''': The call centre will call the victim after 24 hours of registering the complaint to get a tap on the harassment. If the harassment continues from the accused, a detailed call records would be called for and analysed. He is then again sent for a counselling
*'''Four star''': The call centre will call the victim after 7 days of registering the complaint to get a tap on the harassment. If the harassment continues from the accused, a detailed call records would be called for and analysed. He given a final warning and then again sent for a counselling
*'''Five star''': The call centre will call the victim after 30 days of registering the complaint to get a tap on the harassment. If the harassment continues from the accused, a detailed call records would be called for and analysed. The case is then handed over to the respective DIG who then takes the necessary legal action &lt;ref name="Women Power Line in The Times of India"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dial 1090, report a crank caller to police|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/Dial-1090-report-a-crank-caller-to-police/articleshow/16830852.cms|accessdate=2016-02-01|newspaper=The Times of India|date=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
