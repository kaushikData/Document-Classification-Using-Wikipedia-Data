'''''A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery''''', or the full title, '''''A Philosopher giving a Lecture on the Orrery in which a lamp is put in place of the Sun''''', is a painting by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] depicting a lecturer giving a demonstration of an [[orrery]] to a small audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/engine/resource/exhibition/standard/child.asp?txtKeywords=&amp;lstContext=&amp;lstResourceType=&amp;lstExhibitionType=&amp;chkPurchaseVisible=&amp;txtDateFrom=&amp;txtDateTo=&amp;x1=&amp;y1=&amp;x2=&amp;y2=&amp;scale=&amp;theme=&amp;album=&amp;resource=5230&amp;viewpage=%2Fengine%2Fresource%2Fexhibition%2Fstandard%2Fdefault%2Easp&amp;originator=&amp;page=&amp;records=&amp;direction=&amp;pointer=&amp;text=&amp;exhibition=1652&amp;offset=0 | title=A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery (1764–1766) | accessdate=12 August 2011 | work=Revolutionary Players | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724091137/http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/engine/resource/exhibition/standard/child.asp?txtKeywords=&amp;lstContext=&amp;lstResourceType=&amp;lstExhibitionType=&amp;chkPurchaseVisible=&amp;txtDateFrom=&amp;txtDateTo=&amp;x1=&amp;y1=&amp;x2=&amp;y2=&amp;scale=&amp;theme=&amp;album=&amp;resource=5230&amp;viewpage=%2Fengine%2Fresource%2Fexhibition%2Fstandard%2Fdefault.asp&amp;originator=&amp;page=&amp;records=&amp;direction=&amp;pointer=&amp;text=&amp;exhibition=1652&amp;offset=0 | archivedate=24 July 2011 | deadurl=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting preceded his similar ''[[An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump]]'' ([[National Gallery, London]]).

The first of Wright's candlelit masterpieces, ''[[Three Persons Viewing the Gladiator by Candlelight]]'', was painted in 1765, and showed three men studying a small copy of the "[[Borghese Gladiator]]". The ''Gladiator'' was greatly admired; but his next painting, ''The Orrery'', caused a greater stir, as it replaced the Classical subject at the centre of the scene with one of a scientific nature. Wright's depiction of the awe produced by scientific "miracles" marked a break with previous traditions in which the artistic depiction of such wonder was reserved for religious events,&lt;ref&gt;Brooke 1991, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; since to Wright the marvels of the technological age were as awe-inspiring as the subjects of the great religious paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson 1968, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; In both of these works the candlelit setting had a realist justification. Viewing sculpture by candlelight, when the contours showed well, and there might even be an impression of movement from the flickering light, was a fashionable practice described by [[Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;Guilding, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; In the orrery demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the sun were an essential part of the display. But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment in a room lit by a single candle, and in two later paintings of the subject by [[Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo]] the lighting is normal.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 1998, 342&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was one of a number of British works challenging the set categories of the rigid, French-dictated, [[hierarchy of genres]] in the late 18th century, as other types of painting aspired to be treated as seriously as the costumed [[history painting]] of a Classical or mythological subject. In some respects the ''Orrery'' and ''Air Pump'' subjects resembled [[Conversation piece (paintings)|conversation pieces]], then largely a form of middle-class portraiture, though soon to be given new status when [[Johann Zoffany]] began to paint the royal family in about 1766. Given their solemn atmosphere however, and as it seems none of the figures are intended to be understood as portraits (even if models may be identified), the paintings can not be regarded as conversation pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1978), pp. 215–216, 270, 285–286&lt;/ref&gt; The 20th-century art historian [[Ellis Waterhouse]] compares these two works to the "''genre serieux''" of contemporary French drama, as defined by [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], a view endorsed by Egerton.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1978), pp. 285–286, and Egerton (1998), p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;

An anonymous review from the time called Wright "a very great and uncommon genius in a peculiar way".&lt;ref name="DS"&gt;Solkin 1994, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Orrery'' was painted without a commission, probably in the expectation that it would be bought by [[Washington Shirley, 5th Earl Ferrers|Washington Shirley]], [[Earl Ferrers|5th Earl Ferrers]], an amateur astronomer who had an [[orrery]] of his own, and with whom Wright's friend [[Peter Perez Burdett]] was staying while in [[Derbyshire]]. Figures thought to be portraits of Burdett and Ferrers feature in the painting, Burdett taking notes and Ferrers seated with a youth next to the orrery.&lt;ref&gt;Baird, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
Ferrers purchased the painting for £210, but [[Robert Shirley, 6th Earl Ferrers|the 6th Earl]] auctioned it off, and it is now held by [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]],&lt;ref name="Lunar"&gt;Uglow 2002, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; where it is on permanent display, and close to a working replica of a full-sized mechanical [[orrery|Grand Orrery]].

A biographer of Wright, [[Benedict Nicolson]], argued in 1968 that [[John Whitehurst]] was the model for the lecturer,&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson, Benedict, ''Joseph Wright of Derby: painter of light'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1968, {{ISBN|0-7100-6284-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another commentator points out the figure's resemblance to "a painting of [[Isaac Newton]] by [[Godfrey Kneller]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.derby.gov.uk/LeisureCulture/MuseumsGalleries/ArttreasureTheOrrery.htm |title=Art treasure – The Orrery |publisher=Derby City Council |language= |accessdate=12 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724223647/http://www.derby.gov.uk/LeisureCulture/MuseumsGalleries/ArttreasureTheOrrery.htm |archivedate=24 July 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Close observation of the adult faces in the picture reveals that each one demonstrates one or other of the main [[Lunar phase|phases of the moon]] – new moon, half moon, gibbous moon and full moon.&lt;ref&gt;The Orrery – A Users' Guide, N J Moyes, Derby Museum and Art Gallery, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albert Joseph Moore''' (4 September 1841{{snd}}25 September 1893) was an English painter, known for his depictions of languorous female figures set against the luxury and decadence of the classical world.

==Life==
[[File:Albert Moore - A Garden - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright| ''A Garden'']][[File:Albert Joseph Moore - Canaries - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|upright|''Canaries'']][[File:Moore Albert Joseph Seagulls.jpg|thumbnail|upright|''Seagulls'']]

Moore was born at [[York]] on 4 September 1841, the thirteenth son and fourteenth child of well known portrait-painter William Moore and his second wife, Sarah Collingham.&lt;ref name=masters&gt;{{cite book|title=Moore|author=Moore, A.J.|date=1908|publisher=Bates and Guild Company|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYJCAQAAIAAJ|page=23|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several of his numerous brothers were educated as artists, including [[Henry Moore (painter)|Henry Moore]], R.A., the well-known sea painter. Albert Moore was educated at [[Archbishop Holgate's School]], and also at [[St Peter's School, York|St. Peter's School]] at York, receiving at the same time instruction in drawing and painting from his father. He made such progress that he gained a medal from the Department of Science and Art at Kensington in May 1853, before completing his twelfth year.{{sfn|Cust|1894}}

After his father's death in 1851, Moore owed much to the care and tuition of his brother, [[John Collingham Moore]]. In 1855, he came to London and attended the Kensington grammar school till 1858, when he became a student in the art school of the [[Royal Academy]]. He had already exhibited there in 1857,&lt;ref name=masters/&gt; when he sent ''A Goldfinch'' and ''A Woodcock.''

His early works shows the influence of [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]]. In 1859 he was in France with the architect William Eden Nesfield. In 1861, he made a new venture with two sacred subjects, ''The Mother of Sisera looked out of a Window'', and ''Elijah running to Jezreel before Ahab's Chariot''.{{sfn|Cust|1894}} Meanwhile, Moore had given signs of the remarkable skill which he afterwards displayed as a decorative artist. The 1860s saw Moore designing tiles, wallpaper and stained glass for Morris, Marshall, Faulkner and Co., and working as an ecclesiastic and domestic mural painter.&lt;ref name=Glasgow/&gt;  During this period his works began to take on a markedly neo-classical character, Moore making an extensive study of antique sculpture, particularly the Elgin marbles in the British Museum.&lt;ref name=masters/&gt; His concern for decorative, color harmonies became apparent in his paintings of the mid 1860s onwards. His works, typically single female figures with formalized proportions, neo-classical drapery and floral accessories, established a major strand of the Aesthetic Movement.&lt;ref name="npg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/personextended.php?linkid=mp03147&amp;tab=biography |title= "Albert Joseph Moore (1841-1893), Painter", National Portrait Gallery |publisher=npg.org.uk|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 1860 he painted a ceiling at Shipley, followed by another at [[Croxteth Park]], Lancashire. He spent the winter of 1862–3 in Rome with his brother John Collingham Moore. It was here that he painted ''Elijah's Sacrifice'', (1863) which shows the influence of [[Ford Madox Brown]] and Edward Armitage.&lt;ref name=Glasgow&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etchings.arts.gla.ac.uk/catalogue/biog/?nid=MoorA |title="Albert Joseph Moore, 1841-1893", College of Arts, University of Glasgow |author=Professor Margaret MacDonald|publisher=etchings.arts.gla.ac.uk|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863 he executed a wall painting for the kitchen of [[Combe Abbey]] for the [[Earl of Craven]].{{sfn|Cust|1894}} Moore was a regular exhibitor at the Grosvenor Gallery from 1877 onwards.

In 1864, he exhibited at the Royal Academy a group in fresco, entitled ''The Seasons'', which attracted notice from the graceful pose of the limbs in the figures, and the delicate folds of the draperies.
In 1865, Moore exhibited at the Royal Academy ''The Marble Seat'', the first of a long series of purely decorative pictures, with which his name will always be associated. Henceforth he devoted himself entirely to this class of painting, and every picture was the result of a carefully thought out and elaborated harmony in pose and colour, having as its basis the human form, studied in the true Hellenic spirit.{{sfn|Cust|1894}}

The chief charm of Moore's pictures lay in the delicate low tones of the diaphanous, tissue-like garments in which the figures were draped.
The names attached to the pictures were generally suggested by the completed work, and rarely represented any preconceived idea in the artist's mind.
Among them were such titles as ''A Painter's Tribute to Music'', ''Shells'', ''The Reader'', ''Dreamers'', ''Battledore'', ''Shuttlecock'', ''Azaleas''.
In so limited a sphere of art, Moore found his admirers among the few true connoisseurs of art rather than among the general public.
His pictures were frequently sold off the easel before completion, but it was not till late in his life that he obtained what maybe called direct patronage.
He executed other important decorative works, like ''The Last Supper'' and some paintings for a church at [[Rochdale]], the hall at Claremont, the proscenium of the [[Queen's Theatre, Long Acre]], and a frieze of peacocks for Mr. Lehmann.{{sfn|Cust|1894}}

Moore was of an independent disposition, and relied solely on his own judgment in matters both social and artistic.
His somewhat outspoken views proved a bar to his admission into the ranks of the Royal Academy, for which he was many years a candidate, and where his works were long a chief source of attraction.{{sfn|Cust|1894}}

Though suffering from a painful and incurable illness, Moore worked up to the last, completing by sheer courage and determination an important picture just before his death, which occurred on 25 September 1893, at 2 Spenser Street, Victoria Street, [[Westminster]].
He was buried at Highgate cemetery.
His last picture, ''The Loves of the Seasons and the Winds'', is one of his most elaborate and painstaking works ; it was painted for Mr. McCulloch, and Moore wrote three stanzas of verse to explain the title.{{sfn|Cust|1894}}

Moore's work is now represented in many important public collections, such as those of Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, and elsewhere.
An exhibition of his works was held at the [[Grafton Galleries]], London, in 1894.{{sfn|Cust|1894}}

Several of his pictures are now in public collections throughout the United Kingdom and, in addition to those above, include ''Blossoms'' in the [[Tate]], and a watercolor, ''The Open Book'', in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London. The [[British Museum]] in London has a group of his early drawings.

{{Merge to|Cryptolect|discuss=Talk:Cant (language)#Merge to Cryptolect|date=September 2017}} 
An '''argot''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|ɑr|ɡ|oʊ}}; from [[French language|French]] ''argot'' {{IPAc-fr|a|r|ˈ|ɡ|o}} '[[slang]]') is a [[Cant (language)|secret language]] used by various groups—e.g., schoolmates, outlaws, colleagues, gay people ([[Polari]]) among many others—to prevent outsiders from understanding their conversations. The term ''argot'' is also used to refer to the informal specialized vocabulary from a particular field of study, occupation, or hobby, in which [[word sense|sense]] it overlaps with [[jargon]]. The discipline of medicine has been referred to as having its own argot which includes abbreviations, acronyms, and "technical colloquialisms".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hukill|first=Peter B.|last2=H.|first2=A. L.|last3=Jackson|first3=James L.|date=1961|title=The Spoken Language of Medicine: Argot, Slang, Cant|jstor=453853|journal=American Speech|volume=36|issue=2|pages=145–151|doi=10.2307/453853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Victor Hugo]] was one of the first to research and compile terms from criminal argot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/hist255/popcorn/convicts2.html | title=Interesting Facts about Convicts of France in the 19th Century | author=Schwartz, Robert M. |publisher=Mt. Holyoke University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1862 novel ''[[Les Misérables]],'' he refers to that argot as both "the language of the dark" and "the language of misery."

The earliest known record of the term ''argot'' in this context was in a 1628 document. The word was probably derived from the contemporary name ''les argotiers'', given to a group of thieves at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Guiraud, Pierre, ''L'Argot. Que sais-je?'', Paris: PUF, 1958, p. 700&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the strictest definition, an ''argot'' is a proper language with its own grammar and style. But such complete secret languages are rare because the speakers usually have some public language in common, on which the argot is largely based. Such argots are mainly versions of another language, with a part of its vocabulary replaced by words unknown to the larger public; ''argot'' used in this [[word sense|sense]] is [[synonym]]ous with ''[[cant (language)|cant]]''. For example, ''argot'' in this sense is used for systems such as ''[[verlan]]'' and ''[[louchébem]]'', which retain French syntax and apply transformations only to individual words (and often only to a certain subset of words, such as nouns, or semantic content words).&lt;ref name="valdman"&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Valdman
 | first = Albert
 | title = La Langue des faubourgs et des banlieues: de l'argot au français populaire

 | date = May 2000
 | jstor = 399371|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such systems are examples of ''argots à clef'', or "coded argots."&lt;ref name="valdman"/&gt;

Specific words can go from argot into common speech or the other way. For example, modern [[French language|French]] ''[[wikt:loufoque|loufoque]]'' 'crazy, goofy', now common usage, originates in the ''[[louchébem]]'' transformation of Fr. ''[[wikt:fou|fou]]'' 'crazy'.

"Piaf" is a Parisian argot word for "bird, [[sparrow]]". It was taken up by singer [[Edith Piaf]] as her stage name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/06/25/french-blues| title=French Blues| author=Judith Thurman| date=June 25, 2007| accessdate=May 5, 2015| publisher=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}__NOTOC__
'''''The Assumption of the Virgin''''' is a [[fresco]] by the Italian Late Renaissance artist [[Antonio da Correggio]] decorating the dome of the [[Cathedral of Parma]], [[Italy]]. Correggio signed the contract for the painting on November 3, 1522. It was finished in 1530.

The composition was influenced by [[Melozzo da Forlì]]'s perspective and includes the decoration of the dome base, which represents the four protector saints of [[Parma]]: [[St. John the Baptist]] with the lamb, [[Hilary of Poitiers|St. Hilary]] with a yellow mantle, [[Thomas (Apostle)|St. Thomas]] (or Joseph)&lt;ref&gt;More likely to be Saint Joseph carrying a staff according to David Ekserdjian, in "Correggio in Parma Cathedral: Not Thomas but Joseph", ''The Burlington Magazine ''(1986); pp. 412+414-415.&lt;/ref&gt; with an angel carrying the martyrdom palm leaf, and [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard]], the sole figure looking upwards.

Below the feet of Jesus, the uncorrupt Virgin in red and blue robes is lofted upward by a vortex of singing or otherwise musical angels. Ringing the base of the dome, between the windows, stand the perplexed [[Apostles]], as if standing around the empty tomb in which they have just placed her. In the group of the [[beatified|blessed]] can be seen: [[Adam and Eve]], [[Judith]] with the head of [[Holofernes]]. At the centre of the dome is a foreshortened beardless [[Jesus]] descending to meet his mother.

Correggio's ''Assumption'' would eventually serve as a catalyst and inspiration for the dramatically-illusionistic, [[di sotto in su]] ceiling paintings of the 17th-century [[Baroque]] period. In Correggio's work, and in the work of his Baroque heirs, the entire architectural surface is treated as a single pictorial unit of vast proportions and opened up via painting, so that the dome of the church is equated with the vault of heaven. The illusionistic manner in which the figures seem to protrude into the spectators' space was, at the time, an audacious and astounding use of foreshortening, though the technique later became common among Baroque artists who specialized in illusionistic vault decoration.

Among many other works, Correggio's ''Assumption'' inspired [[Carlo Cignani]] for his fresco ''Assumption of the Virgin'', in the cathedral church of [[Forlì]]; and [[Giovanni Lanfranco]]'s fresco of the dome in the church of [[Sant'Andrea della Valle]] in [[Rome]].

==History==
[[File:Carl Friedrich Bucherer Clockmaker.jpg|thumb|150px|&lt;small&gt;Carl Friedrich Bucherer, founder of the Swiss watch manufacturer.&lt;/small&gt;]]
In 1888, Carl Friedrich Bucherer established his first boutique selling watches and jewelry in Lucerne, Switzerland. In 1919, Carl Friedrich Bucherer launched his first ladies’ watch collection in the [[art deco]] style. He is one of the first watchmakers to adopt the watch strap, which at the time was still a revolutionary concept. By 1948, the company was focusing on sporty chronographs that prominently displayed the current date.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carl-f-bucherer.com/en/lucerne-1888 |title=Made of Lucerne Since 1888  |date= |publisher=Carl F. Bucherer }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Carl F. Bucherer boutique.jpg|thumb|left|100px|&lt;small&gt;Carl Friedrich Bucherer's first boutique in Lucerne, Switzerland.&lt;/small&gt;]]
By 1968, Carl F. Bucherer had manufactured around 15,000 high-precision, certified [[chronometer watch|chronometers]], making the company one of the top three Swiss producers of these specialized timepieces. In 1969, the company became part of a Swiss consortium for the development and production of the first quartz [[Movement (clockwork)|movement]] for wristwatches, the Beta 21.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In 1976, Jörg G. Bucherer, the third generation of the family, took over the company. In 2001, the Carl F. Bucherer brand was [[Positioning (marketing)|repositioned]] and the company launched the Patravi watch collection. In 2005, the company filed a patent for the monopusher mechanism of the Patravi TravelTec watch, which permits the parallel display of three time zones.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In 2007, Carl F. Bucherer acquired Téchniques Horlogères Appliquées of [[Sainte-Croix, Switzerland]] and incorporated it into the company as Carl F. Bucherer Technologies. The acquisition enables the company to research, develop, and produce its own manufacture movements and modules for additional functions. This leads in the following year to the company's launch of the CFB A1000 manufacture movement, which features a peripheral motor.&lt;ref name="collection"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://issuu.com/carlfbucherer/docs/cfb_collection_2014-2015_en |title=Collection 2014/15 |date= |publisher=Carl F. Bucherer }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Manero PowerReserve becomes the first Carl F. Bucherer model to receive a unique laser signature in order to ensure product authenticity and quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carl-f-bucherer.com/en/news/manero-powerreserve-0 |title=Manero PowerReserve |date=16 May 2014 |publisher=Carl F.

==Production==
[[File:Carl F. Bucherer Women's Wristwatch.jpg|thumb|&lt;small&gt;The first Carl F. Bucherer ladies' wristwatch, from 1919.&lt;/small&gt;]]
In order to increase its production capacity, Carl F. Bucherer moved its production workshops from [[Nidau]] to a larger production site in [[Lengnau, Bern]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=18 November 2004 |title=Carl F.

Bucherer announced that its manufacturing will be consolidated to a new factory in Lengnau in order to optimize production processes and its [[Value chain|value-added chain]], as well as increase the scope of [[Vertical integration|vertical manufacturing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=28 August 2015 |title=Carl F Bucherer - Établissement d'un centre de compétences à Lengnau |url= |newspaper=Journal de Sainte-Croix et environs }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=4 July 2016 |title=Carl F.

The company currently sells about 25,000 watches a year (around 60% men, 40% women) .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=13 August 2015 |title=In Conversation With Sascha Moeri, CEO, Carl F.

The world market is divided between Europe with 40%, Asia also 40% and rest of the world, including US market with 20%. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfb-communication.com Official Facts and Figures 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==In-house manufacture movement==
[[File:CFB A2000 Caliber Watch Movement.png|thumb|150px|left|&lt;small&gt;The CFB A2000 caliber manufacture movement.&lt;/small&gt;]]
The CFB A1000 caliber has the first reliably functioning, peripherally-mounted rotor, which is made of [[tungsten]].&lt;ref name="collection"/&gt; The peripheral rotor provides power when turning in either direction and allows for full visual display of the movement.&lt;ref name="manufacturer"/&gt; The A1000 movement includes the patented "Dynamic Shock Absorption" (DSA) system for effective shock absorption.&lt;ref name="collection"/&gt;
[[File:Manero Peripheral.jpg|thumb|150px|&lt;small&gt;The 2016 Manero Peripheral model, marking the launch of the CFB A2000 movement family.&lt;/small&gt;]]
At [[BaselWorld]] 2016, Carl F. Bucherer introduced the CFB A2000 manufacture movement. The A2000 retains the A1000 caliber's signature winding mechanism but is enhanced from a 3[[Hertz|hz]] to a 4Hz beat rate "for increased precision and a newly free-sprung balance for increased resistance to shock-induced timing deviation." The A2000 has the [[COSC]] Swiss Chronometer certification to attest to its high-level performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=17 March 2016 |title=Carl F.

Carl F. Bucherer's new Manero Peripheral model, also introduced at BaselWorld 2016, is driven by the CFB A2000-based CFB A2050 caliber.

==Authentication==
As of 2014, the company's manufacture movements have been protected against [[Counterfeit consumer goods|counterfeiting]] by special laser technology. Developed by the Swiss company Mimotec SA, the CLR-[[LIGA]] process imprints a unique signature on the surface of the watch movement using diffractive nano-structuring that can then only be authenticated with a specialized laser scanning device.&lt;ref name="clr-liga"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mimotec.ch/anglais/Product/contrefa%C3%A7on.html |title=Say ''STOP'' to counterfeiting… |date= |publisher=Mimotec SA |access-date=2015-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930051836/http://www.mimotec.ch/anglais/Product/contrefa%C3%A7on.html# |archive-date=2015-09-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Carl F. Bucherer celebrated its 125th anniversary with an international roadshow presenting over 200 historical watches and the history of the company. The company also released four limited edition watches: the Manero MoonPhase, Manero Tourbillon, Alacria RoyalRose, and the Patravi TravelTec FourX. A jubilee volume, "125 Years' Swiss History of Time," further commemorated the history of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date= |title=Interview with Mr. Sascha Moeri, CEO of Carl F.

==Partnership with Swiss Football Association==
In 2014, Carl F. Bucherer partnered with the Swiss National Football Association, providing each member of the [[Switzerland national football team|Swiss national football team]] a Patravi ScubaTec SFV Special Edition watch ahead of that year's [[2014 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=27 March 2014 |title=«König Fussball» regiert an der Basler Uhrenmesse |url=http://www.nzz.ch/wirtschaft/newsticker/baselworldkoenig-fussball-regiert-an-der-basler-uhrenmesse-1.18272080 |newspaper=Neue Zürcher Zeitung }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carl-f-bucherer.com/en/news/detail/carl-f-bucherer-teams-up-with-the-swiss-football-association/ |title=Carl F.

== Cultural References ==
In the 2018 movie [[Deadpool 2]] the character [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], a time-travelling soldier played by [[Josh Brolin]], uses a time-machine on his wrist to move through time. In close-ups of the device it is inscribed with the Carl F. Bucherer name and logo suggesting that, far in the future where Cable originates, the watchmaker produces wearable time pieces that can manipulate time itself.

'''Continental Type Founders Association''' was founded by [[Melbert Cary|Melbert Brinckerhoff Cary Jr.]] in 1925 to distribute [[Moveable type|foundry type]] imported from European foundries.  The influence of more modern European type design was thus felt in the [[United States]] for the first time, and American foundries responded by imitating many of the more popular faces.  [[American Type Founders|A.T.F.'s]] ''[[Paramount (typeface)|Paramount]]'' and [[Lanston Monotype|Monotype's]] ''[[Sans Serif (typeface)|Sans Serif]]'' series are two examples of this.

Beginning in 1927 Continental also distributed faces cast by [[Frederic Goudy]], and two faces for [[Douglas Crawford McMurtrie|Doug McMurtrie]].  At first Goudy's type was cast at his own  [[Village Letter Foundry]], but after 1929 these were cast by the [[New England Foundry]].  Despite imports being virtually cut-off during the war years, Continental was still issuing Goudy's types as late as 1944 and may have continued functioning even later.

The company focusses on artist service based deals where the artist retains ownership of their copyrights &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

==History==

===1986–1992===

Cooking Vinyl was set up in 1986 by former manager and booking agent [[Martin Goldschmidt]] and distribution manager Pete Lawrence, who initially ran the business as a part-time venture out of a spare room in Goldschmidt's council house in Stockwell, South London.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2016/10/martin-goldschmidt-industry-profile-w-larry-leblanc-interview.html|title=Cooking Vinyl's Martin Goldschmidt On 30 Years of Indie Music|publisher=HypeBot|accessdate=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 Cooking Vinyl recorded an impromptu live performance around a campfire at a folk festival by the singer [[Michelle Shocked]], on a Sony [[Walkman]] with fading batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2012/03/big-chills-pete-lawrence-and-unbound-crowdfund-alfresco-festival-with-book-release.html|title=New Take On Music Crowdfunding From Cooking Vinyl's Pete Lawrence &amp; Book Publisher Unbound|publisher=Hypebot.com|date=2012-03-29|accessdate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its first releases, Cooking Vinyl released the recording as The Campfire Tapes, and it sold 250,000 copies worldwide.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1989, the company was close to bankruptcy when their distributors, [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]], went into receivership. Pete Lawrence sold his stake in the business to Martin Goldschmidt who continued the business while servicing the debt of the company of a period of five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cooking Vinyl's Martin Goldschmidt On 30 Years of Indie Music |url=https://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2016/10/martin-goldschmidt-industry-profile-w-larry-leblanc-interview.html |website=Hype Bot |publisher=Hype Bot |accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1993–1999===
Besides traditional royalty agreements, Cooking Vinyl developed ‘artist services’ deals in the 1990s, where the artist retains ownership of the copyright of their recorded material.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themusicnetwork.com/hot-seat-martin-goldschmidt-founder-cooking-vinyl/|title=Hot Seat: Martin Goldschmidt – Founder, Cooking Vinyl|publisher=[[The Music Network]]|date=2013-12-06|accessdate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these contracts was done in 1993 for the reissue of [[Billy Bragg]]'s ''[[Back to Basics (Billy Bragg album)|Back To Basics]]'' compilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/festival-of-business/9075644/Why-music-is-still-good-business.html|title=Why music is still good business|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]]|date=2012-02-11|accessdate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Bragg has re-engaged with Cooking Vinyl a total of six times, most recently in 2013 for the release of studio album ''[[Tooth &amp; Nail (Billy Bragg album)|Tooth And Nail]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/billy-bragg-re-signs-with-cooking-vinyl/053181|title=Billy Bragg re-signs with Cooking Vinyl|publisher=[[Music Week]]|date=2013-01-16|accessdate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eleven''' (born '''Jane Ives'''; later '''Jane Hopper''') is a fictional character of the [[Netflix]] science fiction horror series ''[[Stranger Things]]''. Portrayed by British actress [[Millie Bobby Brown]], she is a girl with [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] and [[telepathy|telepathic]] abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chaney |first=Jen |date=July 18, 2016 |title=Stranger Things' Millie Bobby Brown on Playing Eleven, Her Love-Hate Relationship With Scary Movies, and Acting Without Speaking |url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/07/stranger-things-millie-bobby-brown-playing-eleven-scary-movies.html |work=Vulture|access-date=October 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==
Eleven is the daughter of Teresa "Terry" Ives, a participant in the [[Project MKUltra]] experiments conducted by the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). Eleven appears to have been born [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]]. However, the use of her abilities temporarily weakens her and causes her [[nosebleeds|nose to bleed]]. At birth, Eleven was taken away from her mother by Dr. Martin Brenner and was raised in the Hawkins National Laboratory in Hawkins, Indiana as a test subject to develop her [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] skills. When placed in a [[isolation tank|sensory deprivation tank]] she can engage in [[astral projection]] and access other [[parallel universes in fiction|dimension]]s, primarily for the purposes of international espionage. Eleven encounters a creature living in the Upside Down dimension, and on the evening of November 6, 1983, she finally makes contact with it. In efforts to make contact, Eleven opens a gate between the Hawkins Laboratory and the Upside Down dimension and the creature gains the ability to travel between the human world and the Upside Down.

In the first season, Eleven escapes from Hawkins Laboratory and attempts to steal food from a local restaurant. She and the owner bond, but the owner calls social services. The responding social worker, who turns out to be a Hawkins Laboratory agent, kills the owner. Eleven flees before being taken once again. She is then found by Mike Wheeler ([[Finn Wolfhard]]), Dustin Henderson ([[Gaten Matarazzo]]) and Lucas Sinclair ([[Caleb McLaughlin]]), who are looking for their missing friend, Will Byers ([[Noah Schnapp]]). Mike allows Eleven to live in his basement. Fearing recapture, Eleven convinces Mike not to tell any adults about her so the social workers don’t find her.

Eleven helps to locate Will using her supernatural abilities, and determines that he is trapped in the Upside Down. The group sets out to find Will using their compasses, but Eleven interferes with their search when she realizes that they are being led towards the laboratory. Lucas, noticing her deception, becomes angry at her (having mistrusted her from the beginning). She flees, steals boxes of frozen waffles from a store, and consumes them in a forest. Mike and Dustin are threatened by bullies where Mike is forced to jump off a high cliff into a river with Dustin being held hostage but Eleven returns, immediately intervenes before Mike is able to jump and saves both Mike and Dustin.

Eleven, Mike, and Dustin reunite with Lucas and make amends. They travel to their middle school with Dr. Brenner and his associates in close pursuit. During the chase, Eleven uses her powers to cause a laboratory van to flip through the air. The group is aided by Joyce Byers ([[Winona Ryder]]), Police Chief Jim Hopper ([[David Harbour]]), Nancy Wheeler ([[Natalia Dyer]]''')''', and Jonathan Byers ([[Charlie Heaton]]), produce a makeshift isolation tank with a pool and bags of salt. Eleven accesses the Upside Down and confirms that Will is alive. As laboratory personnel close in on the school, Mike tells Eleven that she can be a part of his family and asks her to the school dance. He then kisses her after struggling to explain his feelings towards her. Eleven helps the group escape by using her powers to kill most of the agents, although doing so leaves her drained. The monster from the Upside Down makes its way into their dimension, and Eleven seemingly sacrifices herself to destroy the creature and save her friends.

One month later, after a [[Christmas]] party, Hopper leaves the police station and drives to the woods. There, he leaves waffles in a concealed box. The whereabouts or condition of Eleven are left ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Berkshire |first=Geoff |date=July 18, 2016 |title='Stranger Things' Finale: Duffer Brothers Talk Cliffhangers, Death and Season 2 |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/stranger-things-finale-duffer-brothers-interview-season-2-1201816664/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=October 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stephens |first=Emily |date=July 29, 2016 |title=On Stranger Things' season finale, promises are made to be broken |url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/stranger-things-season-finale-promises-are-made-be-240275 |work=[[The A.V. Club]]|access-date=October 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second season, it is revealed that Eleven is alive and, instead of dying, woke up in the Upside Down after destroying the creature at the end of the first season. Eleven escapes the Upside Down through a slimey portal, leading her back to the human universe. With the government forces still searching for her, she instead hides in a forest where she struggles to survive. She finds the eggos Hopper left for her and seeks him out. The two move into a cabin in the woods where he forbids her to leave, fearing for her safety. Hopper hides Eleven indoors for almost a year, telling no one of her whereabouts, not even Mike. During this time, Eleven gains better control over her powers; she is less weakened by the use of her telekinesis, and she is now able to project her mind into other dimensions without the use of a sensory deprivation tank. She uses the latter ability to listen to Mike's attempts to contact her, though she is increasingly frustrated at her inability to reply. Eleven also significantly expands her vocabulary during this time, learning from Hopper and television.

Eleven becomes restless and longs to reunite with Mike, and this causes tension between her and Hopper. She runs away from home one day and travels to Hawkins Middle School. When she finds Mike, he is with Max, a new student. Eleven mistakenly thinks that Max is flirting with Mike and, out of spite, uses her powers to knock her off of her skateboard before leaving. Upon returning to the cabin, she gets into a heated argument with Hopper over her leaving the cabin, ending with her using her powers to damage the cabin out of anger. The next day, cleaning the mess she made of the cabin, she discovers by looking through records in the cabin's basement that her birth mother is alive, a contradiction to what Hopper had told her. She then goes to meet her birth mother, Terry, and her aunt, Becky, and discovers what happened to Terry at Hawkins Laboratory. While there, she realizes Terry is trying to talk with her, but due to her catatonic state, is unable to. Eleven, using her powers, views a flashback from her mother. Terry, after her daughter was taken from her, attempted to force her way into Hawkins Lab to save her. As a response, Brenner and his assistants captured her and subjected her to electroshock therapy, resulting in her current condition. Eleven then uses her abilities to find out she has a "sister"{{spaced endash}}another gifted girl taken by Dr. Brenner for experimentations{{spaced endash}}and sets out to find her.

Using her abilities once again, Eleven locates her sister and discovers that she is an older girl named Kali ("Eight"), with the ability to cause people to have visual hallucinations. Eleven stays with Kali and her friends{{spaced endash}}runaways who are determined to take revenge on people who have hurt them. Kali tells Eleven that while using her powers, she needs to think about what makes her most angry. When they go to get revenge on Brenner's assistant who helped hurt Eleven's mother, Eleven begins to choke him to death but stops upon realizing that he has two daughters. She then stops Kali from shooting him. Back at the hideout, Eleven witnesses Hopper and Mike in danger through the void. While the gang are about to flee, Eleven realizes she needs to go back to her friends because they need her help.

Eleven goes back to Hawkins and finally reunites with Mike with a heartfelt embrace and her friends after saving them from a Demodog. The group realizes that she needs to close the gate to the Upside Down, and she and Hopper head to Hawkins Laboratory. There, Eleven uses Kali's advice and focuses her anger into her powers, closing the gate and draining her powers. Afterward, it is discovered that Dr. Owens has forged a birth certificate allowing for Hopper to become her legal adoptive father as a way to help keep Eleven in hiding. Eleven's new legal name is Jane Hopper. Though she is still not allowed out for her safety, Hopper lets her attend the Snow Ball at Hawkins Middle School. She meets up with Mike, dances with him, and they share a second kiss.

== Development ==

=== Conception and writing ===
[[The Duffer Brothers]] originally based the character of Eleven on survivors of the [[Project MKUltra]] experiments, with influences from ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.]]'' and the idea of being an outsider. They also drew inspiration from the [[anime]]s ''[[Elfen Lied]]'' and ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ew.com/article/2016/07/16/stranger-things-duffer-brothers-episode-2/|title='Stranger Things': The Duffer Brothers explain how they found Eleven|work=EW.com|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, saying they "wanted there to be a mystery in her past, and also have her seem a little scary."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://uproxx.com/sepinwall/stranger-things-creators-explain-it-all-about-season-1/|title=’Stranger Things’ creators explain it all about season 1|date=2016-07-27|work=UPROXX|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, ''Stranger Things'' was pitched as a [[miniseries|limited series]], and it was planned that Eleven would sacrifice herself in the last episode of the series. However, [[Netflix]] were keen for the show to be continued in a second season, and so the brothers decided to keep the character alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.avclub.com/stranger-things-almost-killed-off-eleven-in-season-one-1820226957|title=Stranger Things almost killed off Eleven in season 1, but not for a stupid reason|last=McLevy|first=Alex|work=The A.V. Club|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Casting ===
Of all the roles on the show, the brothers felt it was most difficult to cast Eleven. As the character had few lines, they wanted a child actor that was able to convey lots of emotion. The Duffers were concerned that they would not be able to find anyone who could stay in character in scenes where they were not talking. However, the brothers were relieved after meeting [[Millie Bobby Brown]], who they described as "something special, alright, with a downright spooky preternatural talent." Brown had to get a [[buzz cut]] for the role. Initially she and her parents were worried about this, although after she was shown a photo of [[Charlize Theron]] as [[Imperator Furiosa]] she agreed to getting her hair cut.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Reception==
[[File: Millie Bobby Brown by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Millie Bobby Brown]]'s performance has been widely praised.]]
The character and Brown's performance have received critical acclaim; Alice Vincent of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote that "[[Millie Bobby Brown]] continues to be the star of the show: she has inspired fan art and tattoos, a worldwide acknowledgment of [[Eggo]]s, the waffles her character devours and given a whole new life to the phrase 'mouth breather'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vincent |first=Alice |date=September 24, 2016 |title=Eleven out of 10: how Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown charmed the world |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/2016/09/24/eleven-out-of-10-how-stranger-things-star-millie-bobby-brown-cha/ |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=October 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashley Hoffman of ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine recommended Eleven as a mascot for [[Waffle Day|National Waffle Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hoffman |first=Ashley |date=August 24, 2016 |title=Why Eleven From Stranger Things Is the Perfect National Waffle Day Mascot |url=http://time.com/4464257/national-waffle-day-stranger-things-eggo/ |work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|access-date=October 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lenika Cruz of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' stated that "despite a rich backstory, Eleven is the show's most thinly sketched protagonist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cruz |first=Lenika |date=July 26, 2016 |title=Where Stranger Things Loses Its Magic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/07/stranger-things-netflix/491681/ |work=[[The Atlantic]]|access-date=October 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[69th Primetime Emmy Awards]] in 2017, Brown received a nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]]. At the [[2017 MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards]], she was nominated for [[MTV Movie Award for Best Hero|Best Hero]] and Best Actor in a Show, winning the latter award. She won [[Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor in a Television Series|Best Performance by a Younger Actor in a Television Series]] at the [[43rd Saturn Awards]]. She was twice nominated for the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series]] in 2017 and 2018. She won a [[Kids Choice Awards|Kids Choice Award]] for Best Female Actor in 2018.

'''Pauline Elisabeth Ottilie Luise of Wied''' (29 December 1843 – 2 March 1916) was the [[Queen of Romania]] as the wife of [[King Carol I]], widely known by her literary name of '''Carmen Sylva'''. 

==Family and early life==
Born at "Schloss Monrepos" in [[Neuwied]], she was the daughter of [[Hermann, Prince of Wied]], and his wife [[Princess Marie of Nassau]].

Elisabeth had artistic leanings; her childhood featured seances and visits to the local lunatic asylum.&lt;ref name=P144/&gt;

==Marriage==

[[File:Carmen Sylva, Ion Jalea, Constanța, Romania.jpg|thumb|''Carmen Sylva'' by [[Ion Jalea]] at [[Constanța]]]]
As a young girl, sixteen-year-old Elisabeth was considered as a possible bride for the [[heir apparent]] to the British throne, the future [[King Edward VII]]. His mother, [[Queen Victoria]], strongly favored her as a prospective daughter-in-law, and urged her daughter [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Victoria]] to look further into her.&lt;ref name=P144&gt;Pakula, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Elisabeth was spending the social season at the Berlin court, where her family hoped she would be tamed into a docile, marriageable princess. Vicky responded, "I do not think her at all distinguée looking—certainly the opposite to Bertie's usual taste", whereas the tall and slender [[Alexandra of Denmark]] was "just the style Bertie admires".&lt;ref name=P144/&gt; Bertie was also shown photographs of Elisabeth, but professed himself unmoved and declined to give them a second glance.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Alexandra was selected for Bertie.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Elisabeth first met Prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen in [[Berlin]] in 1861. In 1869, Karl, who was now Prince Carol of Romania, traveled to Germany in search of a suitable consort. He was reunited with Elisabeth, and the two were married on 15 November 1869 in [[Neuwied]]. Their only child, a daughter, [[Princess Maria of Romania (1870–1874)|Maria]], died in 1874 at age three — an event from which Elisabeth never recovered. She was crowned Queen of Romania in 1881 after Romania was proclaimed a kingdom.

In the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-1878|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877–1878, also known as the [[Romanian War of Independence]], she devoted herself to the care of the wounded, and founded the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Romania#Kingdom of Romania|Decoration of the Cross of Queen Elisabeth]] to reward distinguished service in such work. She fostered the higher education of women in Romania, and established societies for various charitable objects. She was the 835th [[Dame (title)|Dame]] of the Royal Order of Queen Maria Luisa. She died at [[Curtea de Argeş]] or Bucharest.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Literary activity==
As "Carmen Sylva", she wrote with facility in German, [[Romanian language|Romanian]], French and English. A few of her voluminous writings, which include poems, plays, novels, short stories, essays, collections of aphorisms, etc., may be singled out for special mention:
*Her earliest publications were "Sappho" and "Hammerstein", two poems which appeared at [[Leipzig]] in 1880.
*In 1888 she received the {{ill|Prix Botta|fr}}, a prize awarded triennially by the [[Académie française]], for her volume of prose aphorisms ''Les Pensees d'une reine'' ([[Paris]], 1882), a German version of which is entitled ''Vom Amboss'' (Bonn, 1890).
*''Cuvinte Sufletesci'', religious meditations in Romanian ([[Bucharest]], 1888), was also translated into German (Bonn, 1890), under the name of ''Seelen-Gespräche''.

Several of the works of "Carmen Sylva" were written in collaboration with [[Mite Kremnitz]], one of her maids of honor; these were published between 1881 and 1888, in some cases under the pseudonyms Dito et Idem. These include:
* ''Aus zwei Welten'' (Leipzig, 1884), a novel
* ''Anna Boleyn'' (Bonn, 1886), a tragedy
* ''In der Irre'' (Bonn, 1888), a collection of short stories
* ''Edleen Vaughan'', or ''Paths of Peril'' (London, 1894), a novel
* ''Sweet Hours'' (London, 1904), poems, written in English.

Among the translations made by "Carmen Sylva" include:
* German versions of Pierre Loti's romance ''Pecheur d'Islande''
* German versions of Paul de St Victor's dramatic criticisms ''Les Deux Masques'' (Paris, 1881–1884)
* and especially ''The Bard of the Dimbovitza'', an English translation of [[Elena Văcărescu]]'s collection of Romanian folk-songs, etc., entitled ''Lieder aus dem Dimbovitzathal'' (Bonn, 1889), translated by "Carmen Sylva" and [[Alma Strettell]].

The Bard of the Dimbovitza was first published in 1891, and was soon reissued and expanded. Translations from the original works of "Carmen Sylva" have appeared in all the principal languages of Europe and in [[Armenian language|Armenian]].

==Văcărescu Affair==
In 1881, due to the lack of heirs to the Romanian throne, King Carol I adopted his nephew, [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand]]. Ferdinand, a complete stranger in his new home, started to get close to one of Elisabeth's ladies in waiting [[Elena Văcărescu]]. Elisabeth, very close to Elena herself, encouraged the romance, although she was perfectly aware of the fact that a marriage between the two was forbidden by the Romanian constitution.

The result of this was the exile of both Elisabeth (in [[Neuwied]]) and Elena (in [[Paris]]), as well as a trip by Ferdinand through Europe in search of a suitable bride, whom he eventually found in [[Queen Victoria]]'s granddaughter, Princess [[Marie of Edinburgh, Queen of Romania|Marie of Edinburgh]]. The affair helped reinforce Elisabeth's image as a dreamer and eccentric.

Quite unusually for a queen, Elisabeth of Wied was personally of the opinion that a republican form of government was preferable to monarchy—an opinion which she expressed forthrightly in her diary, though she did not make it public at the time:&lt;blockquote&gt;I must sympathize with the [[Social Democrats]], especially in view of the inaction and corruption of the nobles. These "little people", after all, want only what nature confers: equality. The Republican form of government is the only rational one. I can never understand the foolish people, the fact that they continue to tolerate us.&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Wolbe, ''Carmen Sylva'', Leipzig, 1933, p. 137, here quoted from Brigitte Hamann, ''Elisabeth: Kaiserin wider Willen'', Munich, 1982, translated to English as ''The Reluctant Empress'', New York, 1986 (a biography of [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria]], who was Elisabeth of Wied's friend).&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Freaknik: The Musical''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] [[television special]] produced by [[T-Pain]]. It features the voice of T-Pain as the Ghost of Freaknik, as well as the voices of entertainers such as [[Lil Wayne]], [[Young Cash]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Sophia Fresh]], and [[Rick Ross]], and [[comedian]]s such as [[Andy Samberg]] and [[Charlie Murphy]] who provide additional voices. It was scheduled to air on [[Cartoon Network]]'s late night programming block [[Adult Swim]] sometime in 2009, but after several push-backs, it premiered on March 7, 2010. The musical is based on the actual music festival [[Freaknik|of the same name]] that used to take place in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

A [[#Soundtrack|soundtrack]] was released by [[Jive Records|Jive]] and [[Nappy Boy Entertainment|Nappy Boy]] on April 20, 2010. The 50-minute uncut version of ''Freaknik: The Musical'' has been released on [[DVD]] and other forms of home media.

== Plot ==
The movie starts at a party that a group of young adults ([[Christopher "Kid" Reid]] and [[Affion Crockett]]) claims is the best [[House Party (film)|party]] they have ever attended. An elderly man ([[Lil Jon]]) joins the party and explains the history of [[Freaknik]]. He tells them that Freaknik threw the biggest party of all time, until it was broken up by the police in 1998; he claims the police "killed" Freaknik. Kid n' Play tried to convince that Freaknik is an urban legend like [[Candyman (film)|Candyman]], but as Play looks in the mirror, they were eaten by a swarm of wasps. The group is then led by the old man in [[summoning]] Freaknik, who appears as the Ghost of Freaknik Past ([[T-Pain]]).

The scene changes to a radio announcer named Mr. Thanksgiving ([[DJ Drama]]), who is interviewing Freaknik. Mr. Thanksgiving and Freaknik explain that a rapping contest will be held, the victory of which will get "a lifetime supply of [[money]], [[clothes]], and [[Prostitution|hoes]]". The scene changes once more to the bedroom of Virgil ([[Young Cash]]), Big Uzi ([[Rick Ross]]), and Light Skin ([[CeeLo Green]]), collectively known as the Sweet Tea Mobsters, a group of young adult rappers from Sweet Tea, Florida, who hope to achieve fame. The group decides to drive to Atlanta to participate in the aforementioned contest, along with their [[Cannabis (drug)|weed]]-smoking (and supplying) friend Doela Man ([[DJ Pooh]]).

During their journey, Light Skin tells of a secret society of African Americans called the [[Sigma Pi Phi|Boule]], fraternity parlance for "a council of noblemen", that seeks to guide the course of black culture. The members of this organization are parodies of [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Al Sharpton]] ([[Charlie Murphy]]), [[Bill Cosby]] ([[Kel Mitchell]]), [[Russell Simmons]] ([[Affion Crockett]]), [[O. J. Simpson]], and [[Jesse Jackson]].  They wear medallions inscribed "10%", an allusion to the [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] essay [[The Talented Tenth]], which says that a class of exceptional members of the black race will rise to lead it.

The Sweet Tea Mobsters make a number of pit stops, including a detour at a college fraternity party where they meet two alcoholic fraternity members ([[Bill Hader]] and [[Andy Samberg]]). While Virgil is fueling the gas tank, A car, inhabited by four sexy-looking women ([[Sophia Fresh]]) named Leacosia ([[Sophia Fresh|Crystal]]), Toprameneesha ([[Sophia Fresh|Skye]]), Obamaniqua ([[Sophia Fresh|Cole Rose]]), and Suzie ([[Sophia Fresh|Crystal]]), arrives. He tried to refuse, but the girls beg in song, besides Leacosia giving Virgil a kiss in the form of a gun. He accepts.

Meanwhile, Freaknik meets Rev. Sharpton, who tried to force him to work for the Boule. The plan fails as Freaknik says that he will "never, ever turn his back on his own people", so he escorts Sharpton out via trapdoor.

At the party, the group meets the Fruit Bowl Boys ([[Kel Mitchell]], [[Affion Crockett]], and [[Denzel Whitaker]]), who later become the group’s biggest competition and are from the mostly white suburbs of Sweet Tea, Florida (although they resemble the Sweet Tea Mobsters). On their long, winding road trip, the Sweet Tea Mob gets lost in New Orleans and are confronted by a gangster ([[Snoop Dogg]]) who makes them visit his boss, Trap Jesus ([[Lil Wayne]]). Upon meeting Trap Jesus, the group loses hope, thinking it is the end, but instead he inspires them to compete and gives them one of his many [[Lamborghini]]s to use to get to Atlanta. However, they crash the Lamborghini when Big Uzi becomes enraged after hearing the Fruit Bowl Boys talking about his jail experience. The group gives up except Virgil, who believes that winning the contest is their destiny. The rest of the group still doesn't believe him until they are given a ride in an airplane by the "Flying [[Malcolm X|Malcolms]]."

Meanwhile, the Freaknik character is elected the "ghost mayor of Atlanta" and dubs the city "Freaknation." Soon after, President [[Barack Obama]] hands the presidency over to the ghost of Freaknik, a move that greatly angers Oprah, which wants to see Freaknik destroyed. She devises a plan to send a giant robotic monster called the "Perminator" (a robotic version of Al Sharpton, rebuilt from Sharpton's corpse after he got hit by lightning while blowing out his hair) to Atlanta to destroy Freaknik. Meanwhile, at the party, the Fruit Bowl Boys begin singing "Shank Ya in the Shower." The Sweet Tea Mobsters arrive at Atlanta at the same time as the Perminator begins its attack; it kills the Fruit Bowl Boys almost immediately. He seems to have Freaknik down for the count, but mass love from the crowd empowers Freaknik as the Mob performs, giving him the ability to grow to a monstrous size. Using the love of his fans, Freaknik is able to destroy the Perminator.

After the fight, Freaknik declares the Sweet Tea Mobsters the winners of the contest, but Virgil refuses the prize and tears the check in half. He tells Freaknik that he doesn't need it as long as Freaknik comes back every year, but before he can finish speaking, a golden lion statue-shaped ship comes right in, inhabited by the members of the Boule. But as Freaknik is about to disqualify them, a dog-shaped spacecraft called the "[[Mothership Connection]]" arrives, killing the Boule and their ship (Note: This scene can only be seen on the uncut version of the special). It is inhabited by three brightly colored aliens who are actually [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], [[Bootsy Collins]], and Gene "King Poo Poo Man" Anderson. They say they have come to take Freaknik because "there are other galaxies that need his powers of positivity", saying that maybe someday he will return and they can "funk it up" once again. Freaknik gives Virgil his gold chain and says that Atlanta will always be his home. Suzie approaches Freaknik, telling him her baby (which looks like Freaknik) needs a father. Freaknik then rushes on board the ship with Clinton, Collins, and Anderson. Mr. Thanksgiving, the radio DJ from the beginning of the show, then speaks, saying how crazy that was and they'll see us next time; Freaknik is seen dancing on the Mothership as it leaves Earth. And after the end credits, we see Sweet Tea taping the check back together.

==Production==
''Freaknik: The Musical'' originally evolved from a failed [[Television pilot|pilot]] entitled ''That Crook'd 'Sipp'' which was created by Mike Weiss, Jacob Escobedo, and [[Nick Weidenfeld]]. The pilot premiered on television on May 13, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=David Banner Debuts New Cartoon|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/latest-headlines/2007/05/david-banner-debuts-new-cartoon/|accessdate=28 April 2012|newspaper=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|date=May 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mariel Concepcion|title=David Banner Premieres 'Crook'd' Cartoon|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1323683/david-banner-premieres-crookd-cartoon|accessdate=28 April 2012|newspaper=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=May 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally, the pilot was to receive six additional episodes scheduled to air sometime after 2007, but the episodes never surfaced and the show's status remained up in the air until mid-2009 when the series was scrapped for good in order to create this special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chris J.

'''Funk &amp; Wagnalls''' was an American [[publisher]] known for its reference works, including ''A Standard Dictionary of the English Language'' (1st ed. 1893-5), and the ''Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Encyclopedia'' (25 volumes, 1st ed. 1912).&lt;ref name="FW1996"&gt;Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Encyclopedia, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

The encyclopedia was renamed ''Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Encyclopedia'' in 1931 and was later{{when|date=March 2013}} known as ''New Funk &amp; Wagnalls Encyclopedia'', ''Universal Standard Encyclopedia'', ''Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Reference Encyclopedia'', and ''Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Encyclopedia'' (29 volumes, 1st ed. 1971).&lt;ref name="FW1996" /&gt;

The last printing of ''Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Encyclopedia'' was in 1997.  As of 2018, annual Yearbooks are still in production.

The '''I.K. Funk &amp; Company''', founded in 1875, was renamed '''Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company''' after two years, and later became '''Funk &amp; Wagnalls Inc.''', then '''Funk &amp; Wagnalls Corporation'''.&lt;ref name="FW1996" /&gt;

==History==
[[Isaac Kaufmann Funk]] founded the business in 1875 as I.K. Funk &amp; Company.&lt;ref name="FW1996" /&gt; In 1877, [[Adam Willis Wagnalls]], one of Funk's classmates at Wittenberg College (now [[Wittenberg University]]), joined the firm as a partner and the name of the firm was changed to Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company.

During its early years, Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company published religious books. The publication of ''[[The Literary Digest]]'' in 1890 marked a shift to publishing of general reference [[dictionary|dictionaries]] and [[encyclopedia]]s. The firm published ''The Standard Dictionary of the English Language'' &lt;sup&gt;({{OCLC|19715240}})&lt;/sup&gt; in 2 volumes in 1893 &amp; 1895 and ''Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Encyclopedia'' &lt;sup&gt;({{OCLC|1802064}})&lt;/sup&gt; in 1912.

In 1913, the ''New Standard Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language'' was published under the supervision of Isaac K. Funk (Editor-in-Chief). The ''New Standard Unabridged Dictionary'' was revised until 1943, a later edition that was also supervised by Charles Earl Funk.

The encyclopedia was based upon ''[[Chambers's Encyclopaedia]]'':
"Especially are we indebted to the famous ''Chambers's Encyclopaedia''...With its publishers we have arranged to draw upon its stores as freely as we have found it of advantage so to do."&lt;ref&gt;Publishers' Preface, ''Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Encyclopedia'', 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilfred J. Funk]], the son of Isaac Funk, was president of the company from 1925 to 1940.

Unicorn Press (later known as the Standard Reference Work Publishing Co.) obtained the rights to publish the encyclopedia, and by 1953 that firm began to sell the encyclopedia through a [[supermarket]] [[continuity marketing]] campaign,&lt;ref name="FW1996" /&gt; encouraging consumers to include the latest volume of the encyclopedia on their [[shopping list]]s. Grocery stores in the 1970s in the [[Midwest]] (Chicago – Jewel Grocers) typically kept about four volumes in a rotation, dropping the last and adding the latest until all volumes could be acquired with the initial first volume being 99 cents. The first several volumes were gold painted along the edges and the later volumes were not. These volumes typically were $2.99 and then toward the later volumes the price had increased with the [[1973–75 recession|inflation of the 1970s]]. If one did not go shopping on a weekly basis, or delivery was spotty, there was a good chance that a volume might be missed to complete the set.

In 1965, Funk &amp; Wagnalls Co. was sold to [[Reader's Digest]].

In 1971, the company, now Funk and Wagnalls, Incorporated, was sold to [[Dun &amp; Bradstreet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Smith| first = William D.| title = Merger News| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-11-24| date = 1971-02-02| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1971/02/02/archives/ashland-seeking-home-oil-control-kentucky-company-holding-talks.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dun and Bradstreet retained ''Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Encyclopedia'', but other reference works were relinquished to other publishers.&lt;ref name="FW1996" /&gt;

In 1984, Dun &amp; Bradstreet sold Funk &amp; Wagnalls, Inc., to a group of Funk &amp; Wagnalls executives, who in turn sold it to [[Field Enterprises|Field Corporation]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="FW1996" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Fabrikant| first = Geraldine| title = THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Field Publications Agrees To Buy Funk &amp; Wagnalls| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-11-24| date = 1988-05-27| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/27/business/the-media-business-field-publications-agrees-to-buy-funk-wagnalls.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the company was sold to [[K-III|K-III Holdings, Inc]], and then in 1993 Funk &amp; Wagnalls Corporation acquired the ''[[World Almanac]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Hicks| first = Jonathan P.| title = COMPANY NEWS; K-III Holdings to Buy Field Assets| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-11-24| date = 1990-12-22| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/22/business/company-news-k-iii-holdings-to-buy-field-assets.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FW1996" /&gt;

In 1998, as part of the Information division of [[Primedia|Primedia Inc.]] (the renamed K-III), the encyclopedia content appeared on the Web site "funkandwagnalls.com". This short-lived venture was shut down in 2001.

[[Ripplewood Holdings]] bought Primedia's education division in 1999, which became part of [[Reader's Digest Association]] in 2007. In 2009, Funk &amp; Wagnalls was acquired by ''[[World Book Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = World Book Launches New Co-Edition Business under Funk &amp; Wagnalls Brand | publisher = Business Wire | accessdate = 2014-07-08 | date = 2010-06-23 | url = http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100623006207/en/World-Book-Launches-Co-Edition-Business-Funk-Wagnalls#.U7t41LEn-Q4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Furninha was explored by [[Nery Delgado]] at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt; J. E.

Observation of a number of photographs from Furninha reveals the existence of a thin film of [[flora]]. This flora is believed to be in close relation with [[fungi]], and displays intense colors of green, yellow and red zones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JRy8r0hsJAU/TZOUPtJ82hI/AAAAAAAAE-8/GQZQGggJ_KE/s400/DSC_0484.jpg Picture of unidentified plant] (NOTE: the plant resembles a bunch of leafless gray branches whose roots penetrate into tiny cavities in the rock, as if they were feeding on nutrients concentrated in these small holes)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caveslime.org/kids/cavejourney/caveJourneyWhatPlants.html|title=What Plants Can Live in Caves?|website=Caveslime|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The walls of the cave are covered with nutrients generated by the mixing of rain waters dropping through the vent of the vault with droplets of seawater entering the cave. &lt;ref&gt;The film [http://cliffs.name Arribas] highlights the colors of the interior of the cave, the surprising harmony of its natural architecture and enacts aspects of the daily life of Neanderthals in a sequence of about three minutes&lt;/ref&gt;

==Furninha in Popular Culture==
*As a record of [[collective memory]], the cave is known as the ''Cave of Dominique''. Dominique was supposedly the name of an elusive robber who took refuge in Furninha.
*The Furninha cave is associated with the "Legend of a love in Peniche". &lt;ref&gt;(''pt'') ''[http://www.faroldanossaterra.net/2016/08/26/lenda-dos-passos-de-dona-leonor-peniche/ Lenda dos Passos de Dona Leonor]'' (The Legend of Dona Leonor's steps)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geraldine''' "'''Gerri'''" '''Santoro''' (''[[Married and maiden names|née]]'' Twerdy; August 16, 1935 – June 8, 1964) was an American woman who died because of an [[Unsafe abortion|illegal abortion]] in 1964. A photograph of her corpse, published in 1973, became a symbol of the [[pro-choice]] movement.

==Biography==
Santoro was raised, along with 14 siblings, on the farm of a [[Russian-American]] family in [[Coventry, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="ken"&gt;{{cite web |last=Stroebel |first=Ken |url=http://eileen.250x.com/GerriS/Gerri_Norwich.htm|title=Sister: Story of photo that galvanized a movement needs telling |work=Norwich Bulletin |date=March 9, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505060856/http://eileen.250x.com/GerriS/Gerri_Norwich.htm |archivedate=5 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was described by those who knew her as "fun-loving" and "free-spirited".&lt;ref name="ken" /&gt; At age 18, she married Sam Santoro, a few weeks after meeting him at a bus stop. The couple went on to have two daughters together.&lt;ref name="maslin"&gt;Maslin, Janet. (March 31, 1995). "[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEFD81E3CF932A05750C0A963958260 Film Festival Review: The Woman Behind a Grisly Photo]." ''New York Times.''Retrieved January 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circumstances of death==
In 1963, [[domestic violence]] prompted Santoro to leave her husband, and she and her daughters returned to her childhood home.&lt;ref name="ken" /&gt; She took a job at Mansfield State Training School, where she met another employee, Clyde Dixon.&lt;ref name="ken" /&gt; The two began an [[extramarital affair]] — Dixon was also married — and Santoro became [[pregnancy|pregnant]] as a result.

When Sam Santoro announced he was coming from [[California]] to visit his daughters, Gerri Santoro  feared for her life.&lt;ref name="maslin" /&gt; On June 8, 1964, six-and-a-half months into her pregnancy, she and Dixon checked into a [[motel]] in [[Norwich, Connecticut]], under [[Pseudonym|alias]]es.&lt;ref name="maslin" /&gt;  Their intent was to perform a [[self-induced abortion|self-induced]] [[abortion]], using [[surgical instrument]]s and a textbook, which Dixon had obtained from a co-worker at the Mansfield school.&lt;ref name="ken" /&gt; However, when Santoro began to [[Bleeding|hemorrhage]], Dixon fled the motel. She died, at age 28, and her body was found the following morning by a maid.&lt;ref name="ken" /&gt; 

Dixon was apprehended three days later. He was charged with [[manslaughter]] and "conspiracy to commit abortion" and [[Sentence (law)|sentenced]] to [[Felony|a year and a day]] in prison.&lt;ref name="ken" /&gt; Police officers who worked on the case called this term "negligible".&lt;ref name="maslin" /&gt;

==Famous photograph==
[[Image:Exposure photograph 5.jpg|thumb|250px|The famous photograph of Gerri Santoro's body taken by the police.]]
Police took a [[photograph]] of Santoro's body as it was found: naked, kneeling, collapsed upon the floor, with a bloody towel between her legs. This picture was published in [[Ms. magazine|''Ms.'' magazine]] in April 1973. It has since become a [[pro-choice]] [[symbol]], used to illustrate that access to legal, professionally performed abortion reduces deaths from [[unsafe abortion]].

Leona Gordon, Santoro's sister, saw the photo in ''Ms.'' magazine and recognized the subject.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=134840 Leona's Sister Gerri]." (1995). ''The New York Times.'' Retrieved December 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Santoro's daughters had been told she died in a car accident, which they believed until after the photo became widely distributed.&lt;ref name="maslin" /&gt; In 1995, [[Jane Gillooly]], an [[independent film|independent]] [[Film director|filmmaker]] from [[Boston, Massachusetts]], interviewed Gordon, Santoro's daughters, and others for a [[documentary film|documentary]] about Santoro's life, ''Leona's Sister Gerri''.&lt;ref name="ken" /&gt; The film was broadcast initially on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] series ''[[P.O.V.]]'' on June 1, 1995. It was later screened at [[film festival]]s, opening in the [[United States]] on November 2, 1995.&lt;ref name="ken" /&gt;

Of the photo's publication, Santoro's daughter, Joannie, was quoted in 1995 saying, "How dare they flaunt this? How dare they take my beautiful mom and put this in front of the public eye?"&lt;ref name="maslin" /&gt; However, in more recent years, Joannie has become an abortion rights activist, attending the [[March for Women's Lives]] in 2004 along with Gerri's sister Leona and Joannie's teenage daughter Tara,&lt;ref name="WaPoMarch"&gt;[https://archive.is/20100201205653/http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A37967-2004Apr23?language=printer ''Washington Post'', April 24, 2004: A Family's March to Redemption]&lt;/ref&gt; and blogging about the memory of her mother.&lt;ref name="SantoroDU"&gt;[http://journals.democraticunderground.com/dancingAlone/4 Joannie Santoro, June 8, 2006: Remembering 42 years ago today]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Gesta Treverorum''''' (''Deeds of the Trevians'') is a collection of histories, [[legend]]s, [[war]]s, records of the [[Archbishops of Trier]] (Trèves), writings of the [[Pope]]s, and other records that were collected by the monks of the [[St. Matthias Abbey]] in [[Trier]]. It was begun in the 12th century and was continued until 1794 when the Archbishopric of Trier came to an end. An edition was published as an eight-volume set in the 19th century. A new 8-volume edition by Emil Zenz was published in the 1950s and 1960s.

'''Gustave Clarence Rodolphe Boulanger''' (25 April 1824 – October 1888) was a French [[figure painting|figure painter]] known for his classical and [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] subjects.

==Life and career==
[[File:Boulanger harem-du-palais.jpg|thumb|275px|''The Harem'']]
Boulanger was born at Paris in 1824. He was orphaned at age 14, and his uncle and guardian subsequently sent him to the studio of Pierre-Jules Jollivet and then to [[Hippolyte Delaroche|Delaroche]] in 1840. In 1849 took the [[Prix de Rome]] with his painting, ''Ulysses'', a work which combined a classical approach with Orientalist overtones.&lt;ref name="NIE"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Boulanger, Gustave |encyclopedia =New International Encyclopaedia |volume =3 |pages=861–62 |publisher=Dodd, Mead and Company |year=1906 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjkrAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA362&amp;dq=Boulanger+%22slave+market%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=37YVTqH3G4XUgQfE7OX8Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Boulanger%20%22slave%20market%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1845, he first visited Algeria and this gave him an interest in Orientalist themes, which was taken up later by his friend [[Jean-Léon Gérome]]. Boulanger's knowledge of Pompeii, which he visited while studying at the École de Rome, also gave him ideas for many future pictures. His paintings are prime examples of [[academic art]] of the time, particularly [[history painting]]. Boulanger had visited Italy, Greece, and North Africa, and his paintings reflect his attention to culturally correct details and skill in rendering the female form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Masler |first=Marilyn  |authorlink= |editor-last=Masler |editor-first=Marilyn  |editor2-last=Pacini |editor2-first=Marina |contribution=Embracing the Academic Tradition |title =Carl Gutherz: Poetic Vision and Academic Ideals  |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |year=2009 |location=Jackson, Tennessee |pages =38–39 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCz8zO0_ItgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-915525-11-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works include a ''Moorish Cafe'' (1848), ''Cæsar at the Rubicon'' (1865), the ''Promenade in the Street of Tombs, Pompeii'' (1869), and ''[[The Slave Market (Boulanger painting)|The Slave Market]]'' (1888). The recipient of many medals, he became a member of the [[Institut de France]] in 1882.&lt;ref name="NIE"/&gt;

He began teaching at the [[Institut de France]] in 1882 and was an influential teacher, noted for his dislike of the [[Impressionism]].

'''Hall of Femmes''' is a project, based in [[Sweden]], aiming to highlight the work of women in [[art direction]] and [[design]]. The designers Samira Bouabana and Angela Tillman Sperandio founded the project in 2009 and the intention was to revise the design history by talking about and paying tribute to the women who were involved in it. The business includes the Hall of Femmes book series where eight female pioneers in [[graphic design]] are portrayed. The project also includes [[seminars]], [[Film screening|screenings]], talks, [[exhibition]]s and [[podcast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://halloffemmes.com/about/|title=Hall of Femmes - About |publisher=Hall of Femmes |date=2010-10-16 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hall of Femmes also wants to inspire to a more equal industry and contribute to the future of the design scene. The business is widely established both in Sweden and internationally, and has been written up in magazines like [[the New York Times Magazine]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2010/06/25/fashion/20100627-pulse-slideshow-4.html?_r=0|title=New York Times Magazine on Hall of Femmes |publisher=New York Times Magazine|date=2010-06-25 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Creative Review]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.halloffemmes.com/2013/04/CR.pdf|title=Creative Review on Hall of Femmes |publisher=Hall of Femmes |date=2013-04-01 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/06/art-director-ruth-ansel-slide-show-201006#/slide=16|title=Vanity Fair on Hall of Femmes|publisher=Vanity Fair|date=2010-06-18 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013 Hall of Femmes organized Design Talks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernamuseet.se/en/Stockholm/Programme/Past-programme/2013/Hall-of-Femmes-Design-Talks/|title=Museum of Modern Art on Design Talks|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art, Stockholm|date=2013-05-01|accessdate=2014-03-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413141731/http://www.modernamuseet.se/en/Stockholm/Programme/Past-programme/2013/Hall-of-Femmes-Design-Talks/|archivedate=2014-04-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a two-day conference at the Museum of Modern Art in Stockholm, where top names in the world of design, fashion, art, communication and architecture were invited to talk. Amongst the international speakers were [[Ruth Ansel]], [[Barbara Kruger]], [[Janet Froelich]] and [[Cindy Gallop]].

In 2013, Hall of Femmes received the Bengt Hanser Award, presented by the Swedish Association of Communication Agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.komm.se/fakta2/bengt-hanser-stipendiet|title=Komm on the Bengt Hanser Award|publisher=Komm|date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hegman Lake Pictographs''' are a well-preserved example of a Native American [[pictograph]], located on North Hegman Lake in the [[Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness]] in [[Minnesota]], USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ely, MN Snowshoeing Trails|url=http://www.ely.org/winter/snowshoeing|website=ely.org|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rock art is considered "Perhaps the most visited and photogenic pictograph within the State of Minnesota."  The rock wall overlooking the lake has a panel of images as described below.

From "Interpreting the Pictographs of North Hegman Lake", Kevin L. Callahan:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The panel shows a human figure in an outstretched arms posture standing near a quadruped animal with a long tail, possibly a dog or wolf, and a remarkably well drawn bull moose with splayed hooves and dew claws. (A dew claw on a moose is a reduced hind toe or the false rudimentary hoof above the true hoof .) Beneath these figures is a long horizontal line, probably representing the ground or horizon, and above the human figure are two vertical rows of short horizontal lines or dashes. One set has 4 lines and next to it are 3 lines. Above and to the right are what look like three canoes. The top two canoes have two paddlers and the third has a faint single one in the middle. Above the moose's rack is a single mark. Above all of these figures is a large cross like a "plus" sign.  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''I AM A MAN''' is a declaration of [[civil rights]], often used as a [[personal statement]] and as a [[declaration of independence]] against [[oppression]].

==Am I Not a Man?==
[[File:Am I not a man.jpg|150px|thumb|''Am I Not A Man And A Brother'' emblem used by abolitionists.]]

Historically, in countries such as the [[United States]] and [[South Africa]], the term "[[boy]]" was used as a [[pejorative]] [[racist]] [[insult]] towards men of [[Black people|color]] and [[Slavery|slaves]], indicating their subservient [[social status]] of being less than [[men]].&lt;ref name=Andersen&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UILcQZS6Bi4C&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=boy+african+american+pejorative&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=i-89AM4K-5&amp;sig=LIjrydmYVlYYVrVnMG8b94KUCWE&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=boy%20african%20american%20pejorative&amp;f=false |last=Andersen |first=Margaret L. |title=Sociology With Infotrac: Understanding a Diverse Society |year=2008 |pages=61 |publisher=Thompson Learning }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[Josiah Wedgwood#"Am I Not a Man And a Brother?"|''Am I Not A Man And A Brother?'']] became a [[catchphrase]] used by British and American [[abolitionism|abolitionists]]. In 1787, [[Josiah Wedgwood]] designed a [[medallion]] for the British anti-slavery campaign. He copied the original design from the [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] as a [[Cameo (carving)|cameo]] in [[black-and-white]]. It was widely reproduced and became a popular [[fashion statement]] promoting [[justice]], humanity, and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/abolition/africans_in_art_gallery_02.shtml |title=The Black Figure in 18th-century Art |author=Dabydeen, David |date=February 17, 2011 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question "Am I Not A Man?" was brought up again during the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott decision]] of the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aalbc.com/reviews/am_i_not_a_man.htm ''Am I Not a Man?'' by Mark L. Shurtleff]. Reviewed by Robert Fleming. AALBC.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Civil Rights Movement]] at the [[Memphis sanitation strike]] in 1968, "I AM A MAN!" signs were used to answer the same question.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/multimedia/news/iamaman/pitts.html Miami Herald]&lt;/ref&gt;

On trial for bringing his son back to [[Nebraska]] for burial, from a forced march to Oklahoma, in 1879 [[Ponca]] Chief [[Standing Bear]] spoke to judge Dundy in his Omaha trial, "That hand is not the color of yours, but if I pierce it, I shall feel pain. If you pierce your hand, you also feel pain. The blood that will flow from mine will be the same color as yours. I am a man. God made us both." Standing Bear (and Native Americans) were granted [[habeas corpus]] meaning that they had status in the court and were indeed human beings.&lt;ref&gt; "I Am a Man": Chief Standing Bear's Journey for Justice, Joe Starita 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use==
"I AM A MAN!" has been used as a title for books, plays, and in music&lt;ref&gt;Ron Miles, [https://www.allaboutjazz.com/i-am-a-man-ron-miles-yellowbird-review-by-dan-bilawsky.php "Ron Miles: I Am A Man"], ''All About Jazz'', October 27, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and film&lt;ref&gt;Marc Myers, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303714704576384023771126308?mod=googlewsj "Mining the Memphis Sound"], ''The Wall Street Journal'', June 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; to assert the rights of all people to be treated with dignity. "I AM A MAN!" signs were used in [[Arabic language]] ''Ana Rajul'' during the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref&gt;Ben Shapiro, [http://www.aina.org/news/20110520135252.htm "Dark Forebodings of the Arab Spring"], ''Frontpage Magazine'', May 20, 20110.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jordanian art''' has a very ancient history. Some of the earliest figurines, found at Aïn Ghazal, near Amman, have been dated to the Neolithic period. A distinct Jordanian aesthetic in art and architecture emerged as part of a broader [[Islamic art]] tradition which flourished from the 7th-century. Traditional art and craft is vested in material culture including mosaics, ceramics, weaving, silver work, music, glass-blowing and calligraphy. The rise of colonialism in North Africa and the Middle East, led to a dilution of traditional aesthetics. In the early 20th-century, following the creation of the independent nation of Jordan, a contemporary Jordanian art movement emerged and began to search for a distinctly Jordanian art aesthetic that combined both tradition and contemporary art forms. 

==Traditional art==
{{main article|Islamic art}}
Jordan, as an independent nation was founded in 1924. Prior to that, the area that is now Jordan had been subject to a number of different rules. It was part of the [[Nabatean Kingdom]], under Hellenistic rule following Alexander the Great's conquest of the area; under Roman rule in the 1st century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Beienkowski, P., ''The Art of Jordan,'' Stroud, Allan Sutton, 1991, pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt; and was once part of the [[Umayyad]] Kingdom in the 7th century (CE) and part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from the 15th-century until the end of World War I&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J.M. and Blair, S. S., ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture,'' pp 362-363; Taylor, J. ''Petra and the Lost Kingdom of the Nabataeans,'' I.B. Tauris, 2001, p. 11 and p. 47 &lt;/ref&gt; when it became a British protectorate until the time of independence.&lt;ref&gt;Zuhur, S. (ed.), ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East, ''American University in Cairo Press, 2001, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; Its art is part a broader Islamic artistic tradition, with evidence of classical influences.&lt;ref&gt;''Mideast File,'' Vol. 4, Learned Information, 1985, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional art was often based on material culture including hand-crafts such as rug-making, basket weaving, silver smithing, mosaics, ceramics, and glass-blowing. The Bedouins were largely self-sufficient in the production of goods, and made their own rugs, wove baskets and prepared ceramics. Such works exhibited wide variation in styles, as tribes often used their own tribal motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Bienkowski, P. and van der Steen, E., "Tribes, Trade, and Towns: A New Framework for the Late Iron Age in Southern Jordan and the Negev," ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research,'' No. 323 (Aug., 2001), pp. 21-47&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jordanian art historian, [[Wijdan Ali]] has argued that the traditional Islamic aesthetic evident in craft-based work was displaced by the arrival of colonialism in North Africa and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Contemporary Art from the Islamic World,'' London, Scorpion Publishing, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the decolonised period of the 20th-century, a contemporary art form combining tradition and modern influences can be observed.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294; Lindgren, A. and Ross, S., ''The Modernist World,'' Routledge, 2015, p. 495; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56; Ramadan, K.D., ''Peripheral Insider: Perspectives on Contemporary Internationalism in Visual Culture,'' Museum Tusculanum Press, 2007, p. 49; Asfour.

===Pre-Islamic art===

As early as the Neolithic period in Jordan, figurines and sculptures were being made. In some of the earliest examples, human skulls were built up with plaster, and inlays were used for the eye sockets.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, L.S., ''The Methodologies of Art: An Introduction,'' Routledge, 2018, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; Two caches of figurines discovered at Aïn Ghazal, near Amman, include animal models and some three dozen monumental figurines (pictured below), which scholars believe were important to the ritual and social structure of the peoples living there,&lt;ref&gt;Mithen, S., ''After the Ice: A Global Human History, 20,000 - 5000 BC,'' UK, Hachette UK, 2011, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; and may have formed part of a burial ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, F.S., ''Gardner's Art through the Ages: A Concise Western History,'' Cengage Learning, 2016, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The [['Ain Ghazal Statues|'Ain Ghazal statues]] are very large, with some around three feet in height. Aïn Ghazal was occupied between 7,000 BCE and 5,000 BCE and the statues have been dated to around 6,500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, F.S., ''Gardner's Art through the Ages: A Concise Western History,'' Cengage Learning, 2016, pp. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt; Showing extensive use of plaster,&lt;ref&gt;Bourke, S., ''The Middle East: The Cradle of Civilization Revealed,'' Thames &amp; Hudson, 2008, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; the Aïn Ghazal statues represent a clear departure from the tiny, faceless figures of the Paleolithic period and mark the dawn of a distinct Neolithic art.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, F.S., ''Gardner's Art through the Ages: A Concise Western History,'' Cengage Learning, 2016, pp. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nabateans]] incorporated numerous sculpted panels, figurines and decorative friezes into their buildings at [[Petra]] and made pottery. Examples include the architectural detail used on the temple of Qsr al-Bint at Petra&lt;ref&gt;Basile, J.J., "Recently Discovered Relief Sculptures from the Great Temple at Amman," ''Annual of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan, vol. 46, The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, Amman, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and the prevalent stele representing the gods, as carved reliefs and either cut directly into the rock-face or carved as stand-alone units and placed inside carved niches.&lt;ref&gt;Patrich, J., ''The Formation of Nabataean Art: Prohibition of a Graven Image Among the Nabateans,'' Brill Archive, 1990, pp. 59-76&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Romans conquered Palestine and Syria in 64-63 BCE, and annexed Nabatea in 106 CE by which time the whole of Jordan fell under Roman rule. The Roman occupation corresponded with a flowering of the visual arts - painting, architecture. By the time of the Emperor Justinian (527-565 CE), churches dotted Jordan's landscape and these featured intricate mosaic floors, frescoes and porticos.&lt;ref&gt;"The Art of Ancient Jordan," in ''Minerva,'' Aurora Publications, 1991, pp. 20-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic art ===
{{main|Islamic art}}
The [[Umayyad]] period marks the starting point of Islamic art and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Genequand, D., "Umayyad Castles: The Shift From Late Antique  Military  Architecture to Early Islamic Palatial Building," in: Kennedy, H (ed.), ''Muslim Military Architecture in Greater Syria: from the Coming of Islam to the Ottoman Period,'' [History of Warfare Series], vol. 35, no. 2, Boston Brill, Leiden, 2006, pp. 3-25; Yalman, S., "The Art of the Umayyad Period (661–750)," ''The Met Museum,'' [https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/umay/hd_umay.htm Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; The wealth and patronage of the [[Umayyad]] period stimulated the construction of religious, administrative and royal residences as well as prompting a distinctive style of ''bayt'' (domestic home). Jordan has some of the finest examples of early Islamic architecture including: [[caravanserai]]s, [[desert castles]] (in Arabic known as ''qusayr''), bath-houses, hunting lodges and palaces located in the fringe of the eastern desert.&lt;ref&gt;Genequand, D., "Umayyad  Castles; The Shift From Late Antique Military Architecture to Early Islamic Palatial Building," in: Kennedy, H (ed.), ''Muslim Military Architecture in Greater Syria: from the Coming of Islam to the Ottoman Period,'' [History of Warfare Series], vol. 35, no. 2, Boston Brill, Leiden, 2006, pp. 3-25&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of great mosques constructed during the rule of the Umayyad caliph [[Al-Walid I]] (705-714) include: the [[Umayyad Mosque|Great Mosque of Damascus]] (706 CE), the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] of Jerusalem (715 CE), and the Mosque of the Prophet in Medina (709-715). Since the mid 19th-century, a number of the Umayyad sites have been excavated, revealing stunning frescoes, wall and ceiling paintings and statuary.&lt;ref&gt;Fowden, G., ''Qusayr 'Amra: Art and the Umayyad Elite in Late Antique Syria,'' University of California Press, 2004, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; One of these paintings, the ''[[Painting of the Six Kings]]'' has been the subject of considerable scholarship with respect to its interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Grabar, O., "The  Painting of the Six Kings at Quṣayr 'Amrah," ''Ars Orientalis,'' Vol. 1, 1954, pp. 185-187&lt;/ref&gt; 

Notable frescoes and relief carvings can be found the [[desert castles]] of Quasyr Al Hallabat; [[Qasr Al-Kharanah|Quasyr al-Kharanah]], [[Qasr Azraq|Quasyr el-Azraq]], [[Qasr Mshatta]] and the [[Qasr Amra|Quasyr 'Amra]] which features frescoes of hunting scenes, musicians, acrobats, entertainers, nude women, wrestlers and scenes of the Royal court.&lt;ref&gt;Fowden, G., ''Qusayr 'Amra: Art and the Umayyad Elite in Late Antique Syria,'' University of California Press, 2004, especially see pp 55-68 for descriptions of the frescoes at Qusayr 'Amra&lt;/ref&gt; Lesser desert castles include [[Qasr Tuba|Quasyr al-Tuba]]; [[Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi|Quasyr al-Hayr al-Gharbi]]; [[Qasr Burqu'|Quasyr Burqu']], Qasr el `Uweinid and Qasr el Feifeh. &lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, D. and Riley, D., ''Rome's Desert Frontiers,'' Routledge, 2012, pp. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Poetry and calligraphy were elevated to high art. Under the [[Umayyad]], writing assumed a special place, often based on scripture and the life of the prophet, Mahommed, but often seen as the carrier of independent meaning and a subject worthy of ornamentation.&lt;ref&gt;Ettinghausen, R., Grabar, O. and Jenkins, K. (eds.), ''Islamic Art and Architecture, 650-1250 ''Yale University Press, 2001, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Master calligraphers were venerated. The art of calligraphy was passed from master to student in a formal, rigorous system of training that took place over many years, required for students to learn the strict rules and protocols that governed the art form. Both religious and secular writing flourished under the Umayyad dynasty. 

Poets, (known as ''sha'ir'' meaning wizard) were thought to be inspired by a spirit (''jinn''), and were expected to defend the honour of their tribe, and to perpetuate its deeds and accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;''Islamic Art, Literature, and Culture,'' Britannica Educational Publishing, 2009, pp. 58-60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mu'allaqat]], a collection of seven poems by different poets, although pre-Islamic in origin, is thought to be the precursor to Arabic poetry.

==Early modern art==
The origins of modern art in Jordan have their roots in the 1920s and 1930s when a small number of artists settled in Amman. [[Omar Onsi]] (1901-1969) was a Lebanese artist who settled in Amman in around 1922,&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J.M. and Blair, S. S., ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture,'' pp. 362-363; Zuhur, S. (ed.), ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East,''American University in Cairo Press, 2001, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt;  and gave painting lessons to the children of Abdullah I.&lt;ref name="Naef1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Naef|first=Silvia |title=À la recherche d'une modernité arabe: l'évolution des arts plastiques en Égypte, au Liban et en Irak|page=160|year=1996|publisher=Slatkine|isbn=978-2-05-101376-5|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, the Turkish artist, Ziauddin Suleiman (1880-1945) also settled in Amman  and held the first solo exhibition at the Philadelphia Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J.M. and Blair, S. S., ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture,'' pp. 362-363&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, [[George Aleef]] arrived in Jordan with a group of Palestinian refugees and set up an art studio where he taught local students.&lt;ref&gt; Zuhur, S., ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East,'' American University in Cairo Press, 2001, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; These three artists introduced local students to easel painting and contributed to a broader appreciation of art. &lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J.M. and Blair, S. S., ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture,'' p. 362 &lt;/ref&gt;

As late as the 1940s, Jordan had no art galleries and art exhibitions were virtually unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Mostyn, T., ''Jordan: A Meed Practical Guide,'' Middle East Economic Digest Limited, Jordan, 1983, p. 72; the author claims that the first art exhibition was held in 1938 but adds no detail. However, different sources claim that the first art exhibition was held in  1951, See: ''Jordan,'' Jordan Information Bureau, 1981, p. 53 and Jonathan Bloom and Sheila S. Blair (eds), ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture,'' Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; The few art exhibitions that were mounted, were held in public spaces such as schools and the halls of parliament.

==Jordanian modern art movement==
In the late 1950s, a group of young artists who had trained in Europe, returned to Jordan to lay the foundations of the ''Jordanian modern art movement.''&lt;ref&gt;Zuhur. S., ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East,'' American University in Cairo Press, 2001, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; A number of these students, including [[Muhanna Al-Dura]], Rafiq Lahham, and Suha Katibah Noursi, received their earliest art education in Jordan from the Russian émigré, [[George Aleef]], who was the first Western painter to establish a studio in Amman and teach local students. According to Muhanna Dura's memoirs, Aleef taught his students the basics of watercolor, drawing and painting, and the European understanding of perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, S., "Mohanna Durra," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World, Online: http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Mohanna-Durra.aspx; Mejcher-Atassi, S. and Schwartz, J.P., ''Archives, Museums and Collecting Practices in the Modern Arab World,'' Routledge, 2016, p. 175; Mejcher-Atassi, S. and Schwartz, J.P., ''Archives, Museums and Collecting Practices in the Modern Arab World,'' Routledge, 2016, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Dura along with these young artists helped to spark a local, Jordanian art movement. &lt;ref&gt;Mejcher-Atassi, S. and Schwartz, J.P., ''Archives, Museums and Collecting Practices in the Modern Arab World,'' Routledge, 2016, p.175&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhanna Dura ultimately taught painting and art history at the Teachers' Training College in Ammman and in 1964, established the Fine Arts Section at the Department of Culture and Art, Amman, and also established the Jordan Institute of Fine Arts in 1970. Thus, he inspired a generation of young artists. Among his notable students were the Princess [[Wijdan Ali]] who is best known for her attempts to revive the traditions of Islamic art.&lt;ref&gt;Hashem Talham, G., ''Historical Dictionary of Women in the Middle East and North Africa,'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2013, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and Nawal Abdallah, who is one of the leading lights of Jordan's contemporary arts scene and whose art often includes calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;Teller, M., "A Hit List of Jordanian Artists" in ''Jordan,'' Rough Guides, 2002, p. 425&lt;/ref&gt;

A second group of artists, who trained in Europe and America in the 1960s, returned to Jordan and began to search for a distinctive Jordanian artistic expression and to assert their Arab identity. Notable artists in the Jordanian art movement include: Khalid Khreis (b. 1955); Nabil Shehadeh (b. 1949); Yasser Duwaik (b. 1940); [[Mahmoud Taha]] (b. 1942) and Aziz Amoura (b. 1944).&lt;ref&gt;Zuhur. S., ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East,'' American University in Cairo Press, 2001, pp. 377-78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hurufiyah art movement==

{{main|Hurufiyya movement}}
The Hurufiyah Art Movement (also known as the ''Al-hurufiyyah movement'' or the ''North African Letterist movement'') refers to the use of calligraphy as a graphic form within an artwork.&lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/;Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; From around 1955, artists working in North Africa and parts of Asia transformed Arabic calligraphy into a modern art movement.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt; The use of calligraphy in modern art arose independently in various Islamic states; few of these artists had knowledge of each other, allowing for different manifestations of hurufiyyah to emerge in different regions. &lt;ref&gt;Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, DOI:https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 &lt;/ref&gt; In Sudan, for instance, artworks include both Islamic calligraphy and West African motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1298-1299&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Roof of Frere Hall (3).JPG|thumb|Detail of Roof of Frere Hall]]
Hurufiyah artists rejected Western art concepts, and instead searched for a new artistic identity drawn from within their own culture and heritage. These artists successfully integrate Islamic visual traditions, especially calligraphy, into contemporary, indigenous compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, A. and Ross, S., ''The Modernist World,'' Routledge, 2015, p. 495; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Although hurufiyah artists were concerned with their individual dialogue with nationalism and attempted to engage with the modern art movement, they also worked towards an aesthetic that transcended national boundaries and represented a broader affiliation with an Islamic identity. &lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kathy Beale''' (also &lt;!-- please do not add Hills as she has never been credited with that name --&gt; '''Mitchell''' and '''Sullivan''') is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Gillian Taylforth]]. Portrayed as "an attractive, bright, caring and highly moral woman", Kathy is one of the serial's original characters, appearing in the first episode of ''EastEnders'' on 19 February 1985. Taylforth was originally dismissed for the role of Kathy due to her young age, but was reconsidered when she impressed show bosses. Kathy remained in a prominent role throughout her original stint on the serial, featuring in high-profiled storylines involving her rape at the hands of [[James Willmott-Brown]] ([[William Boyde]]) and the discovery of a long-lost daughter, [[Donna Ludlow]] ([[Matilda Ziegler]]), following her rape as a teenager.

In 1993, the character developed a romance with [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and they later had a son, [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]], who caused Kathy turmoil when he contracted a rare form of [[meningitis]]. The relationship between alcohol abuse and domestic violence was explored through Kathy and Phil in 1997, which led to their separation. Taylforth opted to leave the serial in 1997 and Kathy departed on 10 April 1998 after deciding to move to South Africa with Ben. The character returned for two separate guest stints in 1999, making her departure on 6 January 2000. Despite reports that Taylforth would be returning to the serial, Kathy was killed off-screen in a road collision in 2006 to facilitate Ben's reintroduction to the serial.

Taylforth reprised the role for a charity special in 2014. In the episode broadcast on 19 February 2015, the character made a surprise return to the serial, despite being presumed dead. It was confirmed that the character would be making a permanent return, and after a guest appearance on 19 May 2015, Kathy returned on 17 August 2015. Taylforth was initially hesitant about her reintroduction storyline, which was inspired by the [[John Darwin disappearance]]. Kathy's husband, [[Gavin Sullivan]] ([[Paul Nicholas]]), was also introduced following her return and their abusive marriage was explored. The character later had an affair with [[Buster Briggs]] ([[Karl Howman]]).

==Storylines==

===1985–2000===
Kathy and her husband [[Pete Beale]] ([[Peter Dean (actor)|Peter Dean]]) are financially stable. Kathy works as a barmaid in [[The Queen Victoria]] pub with her best friend, [[Angie Watts]] ([[Anita Dobson]]), whilst helping Pete on their fruit and veg stall. Kathy feels she has put her troubled past behind her but [[Nick Cotton]] ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]) breaks into [[Harold Legg|Dr Harold Legg]]'s ([[Leonard Fenton]]) surgery and reads Kathy's medical records. He discovers that she gave a child, [[Donna Ludlow]] ([[Matilda Ziegler]]), the product of rape when Kathy was 14, up for adoption. Nick uses this to blackmail her, which eventually forces her to tell Pete her secret and he reacts badly.

She later starts a knitting business. [[Mehmet Osman]] ([[Haluk Bilginer]]) asks Kathy to knit a batch of jumpers for him. Kathy finds out from [[Ali Osman]] ([[Nejdet Salih]]) that she was conned when Mehmet disappears with the jumpers and money.

Kathy learns that Donna, now an adult, wants to meet her but she refuses. Undeterred, Donna moves to Walford, keeping her identity secret. To get closer to Kathy, Donna calls her workplace at [[Samaritans (charity)|The Samaritans]] and grows close to Kathy's son [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]), who becomes attracted to his half-sister. When Kathy tells Donna to stay away from Ian, Donna reveals that she is her daughter. Donna thinks Kathy will be pleased but Kathy is horrified and demands she leave Walford. Donna stays and causes various problems for Kathy. Finally Kathy tells Donna that she is actually the product of rape; Kathy gave her up at birth and wants nothing to do with her now. Donna spends the rest of the year in a downward spiral.

[[James Willmott-Brown]] ([[William Boyde]]) employs Kathy at The Dagmar wine bar, angering Pete, and the rift worsens when it becomes clear that James is romantically interested in Kathy. After work, James invites Kathy upstairs to his flat, but when he attempts to seduce her, Kathy tries to leave. James refuses to let her leave and his attempted seduction becomes rape. James is arrested and formally charged with rape. In the aftermath, Kathy becomes depressed and isolated from Pete, who never believes she is blameless so Kathy leaves him. James stands trial but tries bribing Kathy to withdraw her statement. Kathy pretends to take his hush money but tells the police so a listening [[Detective Inspector|DI]] tapes the conversation. She is forced to relive the rape for the trial, where a skillful [[barrister]] presents a good case for James. For a time it seems James could be acquitted, but to Kathy's relief, he is convicted and imprisoned for three years. During this time, Kathy finds unexpected support from Pete's first wife, [[Pat Butcher|Pat]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]), whom she had initially despised and they become close friends.

Donna, whom Kathy still refuses to accept, sinks into depression and overdoses on [[heroin]] and dies, leaving Kathy wrestling with guilt. Kathy attempts to move on and begins a relationship with market trader [[Laurie Bates]] ([[Gary Powell (actor)|Gary Powell]]). Their relationship manages to survive the interference of [[Julie Cooper (EastEnders)|Julie Cooper]] ([[Louise Plowright]]), who tries but fails to claim Laurie for herself. However, when Laurie begins buying Kathy extravagant clothing and jewellery, she questions his motives, thinking he's trying to make her look like his late wife, and loses interest. Laurie takes her rejection badly and some tactless comments regarding her sexual abstinence makes Kathy believe he has deceived her of his true nature. She ends the relationship. Later in the year, Kathy begins dating [[Eddie Royle]] ([[Michael Melia]]). He patiently pursues her, but after a few dates, she becomes hesitant and after she sees him kissing [[Eibhlin O'Donnell]] (Mary Conlon) - his former girlfriend visiting from [[Ireland]] - their lukewarm romance ends.

Kathy persuades The Samaritans to take her back as a volunteer, on the condition she is shadowed following her previous stint. [[Disa O'Brien]] ([[Jan Graveson]]) phones The Samaritans and tells Kathy her baby, [[Billie O'Brien]], is the product of rape and fathered by her stepfather, [[Ken Raynor]] ([[Ian Redford (actor)|Ian Redford]]). Willmott-Brown is released from prison. He sends Kathy a tape telling her that he wants to meet her and that he has changed. Kathy pleads with him to leave and never return but he moves to the Square and continues to pester her, until Kathy relays the hurt and anger he had caused her, gaining some closure. James threatens suicide but Kathy stops him, refusing to let him take the easy way out. After a heated conversation in which James pleads for forgiveness, Kathy convinces him to leave Walford. She also convinces Pete — who has been hoping for reconciliation — that their marriage is over. Later, Kathy begins a relationship with market inspector [[Richard Cole (EastEnders)|Richard Cole]] ([[Ian Reddington]]), which sours when she discovers that he is taking a cash bribe and allowing a mobile hot dog van to trade in direct competition with her café.

After admitting his feelings for her whilst in France, Kathy begins a romance with mechanic [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), which manages to survive various revelations about Phil's criminal activity, as well as  interference from Phil's wife [[Nadia Mitchell|Nadia]] (Anna Barkan), who tries to split them up. Phil proposes to Kathy and she accepts, but during their engagement party, Kathy learns that Phil had resumed an affair with his sister-in-law [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Mitchell]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) after [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) obtained a tape of a drunken Sharon and [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]), Kathy's niece, discuss the affair. After Grant plays the tape, the revelation ends Kathy's friendship with Sharon, leads to Phil being beaten by his brother Grant, and almost ends Kathy and Phil's relationship. It also causes a strain between Kathy and Michelle and Kathy is hurt about Michelle taking Sharon's side, believing that as family, Michelle should have told her. Kathy is cold towards Michelle's initial efforts to make amends, but they soon make up.

Phil and Kathy sort out their differences and get married in secret in early 1995. Kathy keeps fainting and refuses to see [[Harold Legg]] ([[Leonard Fenton]]), she relents and is told she is pregnant. Phil is overjoyed about becoming a father, as is Phil's mother, [[Peggy Mitchell]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]). Kathy goes into labour with Pat helping her and Phil meets their son shortly after he is born. Kathy is opposed to Peggy's name suggestion of Eric and names him Ben. Kathy's niece, [[Sarah Hills]] ([[Daniela Denby-Ashe]]), and Sarah's boyfriend, [[Robbie Jackson]] ([[Dean Gaffney]]), look after Ben when he becomes ill and at hospital, he is diagnosed with [[meningitis]]. Phil's brother, [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]), reveals that [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]), the husband of Ben's childminder [[Ruth Fowler]] ([[Caroline Paterson]]) and Kathy's nephew, has [[AIDS]]. Despite Kathy panicking that the AIDS caused the meningitis, she is reassured the conditions are not linked. Kathy and Phil are told that Ben has been left partially deaf in one ear. Kathy is devoted to Ben; feeling neglected, Phil turns to alcohol. By the end of the year his drinking has developed into [[alcoholism]] and he becomes violent toward Kathy. After he snatches Ben and leaves him near a fire while he passes out drunk, Kathy leaves him. Realising what he has lost, Phil tries to stop drinking and rebuild his marriage. Kathy takes him back but when Phil attends counselling, he begins an affair with a fellow alcoholic, [[Lorna Cartwright]] ([[Janet Dibley]]), who starts stalking him and makes herself known to Kathy. Phil takes Kathy to Paris, hoping that it will bring them closer. However, Phil confesses to his affair with Lorna and Kathy responds by throwing her wedding ring into the [[Seine]], stating their marriage is "the biggest mistake" of her life. Phil begins sleeping rough and blames Kathy for his decline. Despite momentarily contemplating [[suicide]], Kathy hardens herself towards her husband's abuse.

Kathy starts a relationship with [[vicar]] [[Alex Healy (EastEnders)|Alex Healy]] (Richard Driscoll). Alex's [[Bishop]] discovers their affair and offers Alex a choice: Kathy or his job. Alex is prepared to give up his job to be with Kathy but she has second thoughts and considers moving to [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]] to live with her brother [[Ted Hills]] ([[Brian Croucher]]). Her upcoming departure spurs proposals from not only Alex but Phil's brother Grant, who asks her to elope, and Phil, who tries to reunite with her. Kathy grows confused by so many options but eventually tells Phil she is open to a reunion with him. However, he fails to meet her on the day of her planned departure, so Kathy leaves Walford with Ben.

Kathy returns to meet Ian's fiancée [[Melanie Owen|Melanie Healy]] ([[Tamzin Outhwaite]]) and has a fling with Grant. Just before she is due to return home to South Africa, Kathy asks Phil to leave with her. However, Grant has planned a robbery that same day and Phil cannot bring himself to let his brother do the job alone. Infuriated by Phil's loyalty to Grant, Kathy reveals their recent tryst, moments before she leaves. This results in a violent showdown between the brothers. Grant confesses that he only had sex with Kathy as revenge for Phil's affair with his wife Sharon. Phil responds by threatening to shoot Grant, devastated that he lost Ben and Kathy again. This leads to Grant crashing their car into the River Thames but both survive. When Kathy returns again for Ian's short-lived wedding to Melanie, after Ian lied to Melanie about his daughter [[Lucy Beale]] having cancer, and Melanie revealing she had a [[one night stand]] with [[Steve Owen (EastEnders)|Steve Owen]] ([[Martin Kemp]]), she is met with hostility from Phil's mother, [[Peggy Mitchell|Peggy]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]). Phil tries to persuade Kathy to reconcile one last time but they both agree their relationship is over and Kathy leaves Walford alone.

In 2001, Kathy marries a friend of Ted's called [[Gavin Sullivan]] ([[Paul Nicholas]]) in South Africa. Years later, Ian hears that Kathy and Gavin have been killed in a traffic collision. Ian travels to South Africa and returns with Ben; eventually Phil gains custody of Ben.

===2015–===
After being released from a short stint in prison, Phil attempts to tell Ian privately on his wedding day that Kathy is alive, but cannot go through with it when Ben ([[Harry Reid (actor)|Harry Reid]]) walks in on their conversation. Phil later meets Kathy in secret and tells her that, despite her wishes, he cannot allow her to return home, concerned about the effect on Ben and Ian. A few months later, Phil meets her in a café, and hands her an envelope of cash, with the promise this is the last payment he has for her. Seemingly out of the blue, months on, Kathy visits Phil at his garage in Walford, begging for fake documentation for her controlling husband [[Gavin Sullivan]] ([[Paul Nicholas]]), so she can reveal that she faked her death, without implicating him. Phil agrees to help her leave London and meets her at [[St Pancras International]], but Sharon, who is now married to Phil, arrives, suspecting he is meeting someone he is having an affair with. Ian accompanies her and Kathy disappears, having spotted Ian for the first time in 10 years. As she leaves, she runs into Gavin, who has been aware of her plan all along. Phil's cousin [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) discovers Kathy is alive, and Phil has been aware for three years, since Ben went to prison for murdering [[Heather Trott]] ([[Cheryl Fergison]]).

Several weeks later, Kathy has escaped Gavin, and she contacts her old friend [[Tracey (EastEnders)|Tracey]] ([[Jane Slaughter (actress)|Jane Slaughter]]), at The Queen Vic, giving her an address to pass on to Phil. Gavin follows Phil to a small hotel. He reaches Kathy first and takes her to a small airfield, with the intent of flying away from England. Phil and Ronnie intercept them and convince Kathy to come back to Walford with them. While Phil arranges a hotel for her to stay in, she hides in The Arches, where she comes face to face with Sharon, who is stunned to find she is alive. They have an angry confrontation which leads to a physical fight, before Phil moves Kathy to a nearby hotel. Within a week, Kathy is revealed to have Gavin hidden in her bathroom, with him controlling her again. After Ian's wife [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) talks him out of suicide, Ian is shocked to see Kathy is alive and has witnessed the event. As Ian crosses the road to meet Kathy, he is hit by an oncoming car and rushed to hospital. Ian eventually regains consciousness and breaks down in happiness when he realises that Kathy is alive, but reveals he wants answers for her faking her death. As Ian is leaving hospital, Jane threatens Kathy to stay away from Walford in a bid to protect Ian. Ian demands to see Kathy and she explains to him that Gavin forced her to go on the run with him as part of an insurance scam and he had controlled her for years and she felt she had no choice. Ian persuades her to go to the police and she agrees, however, she lies about why she is there when she enters the station by claiming her handbag is stolen and later tells Ian that she told them everything and they are looking for Gavin. She then secretly meets Gavin who reminds her of their plan.

Kathy returns a few days later and meets with Ben, who is furious to see her again after several years of believing she was dead. He angrily declares that her absence is to blame for the current state of his life, declaring that he is the reason Phil has left due to his homosexuality, but Kathy tells him that she and Phil knew that he was gay before he even started school, and that they have always loved him. Ian later decides to rebuild his relationship with his mother and allows Kathy to move into his house. Gavin meets Kathy in Walford and reveals that he has kidnapped Phil and threatens to kill him if she does not follow his instructions and give him money. Kathy and Ben reluctantly agree to give into Gavin's demands, but after trying to steal Ian's safe, Kathy decides not to do so. Ian later tells Kathy that her grandson [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]] (Elliot Carrington) killed Lucy. Kathy, after seeing Ben drunk and angry at her, confesses to Ian that she is still on the run and she and Ben were planning to con him as Gavin has kidnapped Phil, so Ian throws her out, thinking she cares more about Phil than him. Jane is horrified that he told Kathy about Bobby, but Ian is confident she will not say anything to the police. Kathy then goes to the police station to report the kidnapping, while Ben tells Ian what Gavin has done. Ian contacts Gavin, telling him he knows what he has been doing. It is subsequently revealed that he has been keeping Phil locked in his closet, but by the time Kathy and the police come to his house looking for him, he is not there although a fresh blood stain is found in the kitchen. Kathy later tells the Beales what she has done, and Sharon is incensed when she finds out the truth, insisting none of it would have happened if Kathy had not returned. Phil returns home severely injured and Ian allows Kathy to move back into his house. Gavin later holds Kathy, Ben and Phil hostage in their house and when Sharon confronts him, he reveals himself as her father before fleeing. Kathy is given a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to fraud.

When Bobby pushes Jane down the stairs during a scuffle, Jane lies to Kathy that she tripped, but Bobby tells Kathy the truth. Kathy confesses her fears to Jane that Bobby may have anger management problems, and after Bobby later smashes a plate in anger, Jane tells Kathy that she is right. Bobby's feud with Sharon's son [[Dennis Rickman Jnr]] ([[Bleu Landau]]) escalates when Bobby kills Dennis's pet spider. Sharon tells Kathy he is evil and needs help, and Kathy then tells Sharon that Bobby pushed Jane down the stairs, so Sharon tells the Beales she will go to the police about Lucy's killing. Bobby finds out the truth from Dennis, who is later severely injured in a car crash. When the family discover that Phil has been rushed to hospital with a damaged liver, Sharon, Kathy and Phil's former girlfriend [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) go to the hospital only to find out that Phil discharged himself. They find Phil drunk at the pub, where he insults his family and hits Kathy.

Kathy is upset when Ian sends Bobby to a boarding school to try to help his anger problems. Ian puts the restaurant up for sale to pay for the school, and though Kathy tries to encourage more trade at the restaurant, Ian accepts an offer from a supermarket chain, Costmart. Several weeks later, Ian worries he will regret selling the restaurant but Kathy reminds him he is doing it for Bobby and must tell everyone soon that Costmart is buying it, or she will. The market traders then discover this from Ian, and Shirley's boyfriend [[Buster Briggs]] ([[Karl Howman]]) leads a campaign to boycott all of Ian's businesses, fearing they will all lose their jobs. Kathy tells Buster that Ian needs to fund Bobby's place in school, so Buster announces this at Ian's meeting with the traders, angering Ian. Buster asks Kathy why the school is so important, so she tells him to leave her alone as she does not care about him, but then kisses him. She then shows her loyalty to Ian by telling potential boycotters that Buster is a criminal. Ian then changes his mind about selling the restaurant. Buster later propositions Kathy for a secret relationship, believing he is with the wrong woman, and they begin meeting each other secretly. As she tries to meet up with Buster, Gavin stops her and says he has Dennis, so she gets into his car. Gavin takes her to a house and she realises that Dennis is not there. Gavin says they can live there together. Gavin's sister [[Margaret Midhurst]] ([[Jan Harvey]]) arrives, and Gavin locks Kathy in a room to stop her from leaving, while he and Margaret argue; Margaret hits him over the head with a vase and the two women attempt to escape but the most of the doors and windows are locked. Gavin regains consciousness and follows them, and it results in Margaret's death when she falls onto the windscreen of Sharon and Buster's car, who have arrived to rescue Kathy. Sharon calls the ambulance for Margaret whilst she and Buster search for Kathy. Buster finds Kathy, while Sharon confronts Gavin, who is arrested. Later, Kathy tells Buster she needs to end their relationship because things are getting too serious for her. However, as they passionately kiss one last time, they are unaware that Phil has seen them. Kathy spends a night away with Buster and on her return, she is distraught after being told that Ben has been killed and blames herself for not being with him, thus ending her affair with Buster. However, she is relieved when it is a mistaken identity and comforts Ben when he discovers it is his boyfriend, [[Paul Coker (EastEnders)|Paul Coker]] ([[Jonny Labey]]), who is dead. As Buster awaits the verdict from his son [[Dean Wicks]]'s ([[Matt Di Angelo]]) rape trial, Kathy reveals her two rapes to him during a heart-to-heart, they later embrace. Kathy resumes her affair with Buster but she is found out by Ian and Jane following a burglary at Ian's restaurant, however, although she denies her lover is Grant or Buster, she tells Jane she will end the affair. After Buster's son [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]) discovers the affair without knowing Kathy's identity, he urges Buster to tell Shirley or leave Walford for good. Buster asks Kathy to leave Walford with him, but she ultimately decides to remain in Walford with her family, leaving him heartbroken again and he leaves alone.

Kathy accompanies [[Pam Coker]] ([[Lin Blakley]]) when she visits [[List of EastEnders characters#Diane Atmore|Diane Atmore]] (Hazel Ellerby) who is the mother of [[Simon Atmore]] ([[Tom Palmer (comedian)|Tom Palmer]]), one of Paul's killers. Kathy and Pam try to persuade Diane to get Simon to plead guilty, which he eventually does. As a result, Simon and the rest of the killers are sentenced to thirty years in prison. Kathy is horrified when she hears about Ben wanting to [[Liver transplantation|donate some of his liver]] to Phil. She firmly tells him that she will not allow him to do so but Ben insists. Kathy accompanies Ben to his appointment to discuss the transplant. Kathy tries to support him but ends up embarrassing him when she mentions Paul's death and suggests that it is a reason for Ben wanting to donate. An angry Ben later tells Kathy to stay out of his life as she always has done. Kathy joins the Walford Players and clashes with the Christmas show's director, [[Geraldine Clough]] ([[Gwyneth Strong]]) over her plans initially to run a talent show, then to have a fairy godmother in her version of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' and finally for casting Kathy as a pantomime horse. Kathy's protests lead to Geraldine's resignation and Kathy becoming the director. Kathy is overjoyed when Ian decides to rename the café back to "Kathy's", which leads her to decide she no longer wants to be Kathy Sullivan, opting to change her name back to Kathy Beale by deed poll. Ben is hurt with Kathy's decision to change her surname to Beale (rather than his surname of Mitchell), feeling pushed out of the family, but she reassures him that it does not make him any less important to her than Ian. [[Babe Smith]] ([[Annette Badland]]) starts selling breakfasts at The Vic and attempts to steal trade from the café by putting rat droppings in the café's coffee machine, leaving Kathy furious when she finds out. Kathy reports Babe for breaking The Vic's license by selling alcohol outside of their licensed hours. This leads to Babe, Mick and Shirley being arrested and fined, which Kathy feels guilty about. Kathy suffers minor injuries when a car, driven by Michelle (now played by [[Jenna Russell]]), crashes a car into the chip shop. After Phil returns from Italy, he tells Kathy about an offer he has received on the car lot land and confides in her about the guilt he still has over the car lot fire. Phil gives Ben The Arches and Kathy lets slip to Ben about the value of the car lot land, which Phil hands over to [[Jay Brown]] ([[Jamie Borthwick]]). Kathy insists to Phil that he justifies his reasons to Ben about the car lot land. Kathy returns from holiday and finds out from [[Kim Fox-Hubbard]] ([[Tameka Empson]]) about the gas explosion that left Jane severely injured and that Steven has died. Ian rejects Kathy's support. Ben tells Kathy that Ian may still have anger towards her for faking her death, despite accepting her. Kathy confides in [[Carmel Kazemi]] ([[Bonnie Langford]]) about her relationship with Ian and Carmel advises her to work at it. Kathy tells Ian and Ben that she feels that she has become irrelevant to them, but is determined to be their mum and apologises for not being there and Ian finally shows his emotions.

Later at Steven's memorial, once Kathy and Ian are walking away, a man leaves flowers for Kathy. The man is revealed to be James and that [[Fi Browning]] ([[Lisa Faulkner]]), [[Luke Browning]] (Adam Astill) and [[Josh Hemmings]] ([[Eddie Eyre]]) are his children. On Halloween, Michelle tells Kathy about her stalker, [[Tom Bailey (EastEnders)|Tom Bailey]] ([[Daniel Casey]]) and she and Michelle give relationship advice to [[Shakil Kazemi]] ([[Shaheen Jafargholi]]) about Bex. When Kathy shuts up the café, she is startled when James comes in. As James acts casual, Kathy takes hold of a knife and James tells Kathy he has been diagnosed with [[Terminal illness|terminal]] [[liver cancer]]. Kathy rubbishes James' beliefs that they are alike and James says the reason for his visit is to move on from the past. Kathy wants James to explain truthfully what happened on the night of the rape, but when he refuses to do so, Kathy retells it, demanding to know when he decided to rape her and she realises that James chose to rape her when he locked up The Dagmar. Kathy tells James that he has scared her that night like the night he raped her, but James, still in denial, refuses to apologise for the rape and he leaves Kathy his address. Kathy confides in Ian that James is back and Ian contacts Phil about James. Phil finds out that Ben's boyfriend is James' son. Phil tells Kathy that Luke is James' son and Phil fails to warn Luke away from Ben. Ben is angry with what Phil did and when Kathy tries to get Ben and Phil to make up, Kathy tells Ben that Phil was protecting him as James raped her. After struggling to process what he is told, Ben is determined to hurt James, but Kathy orders Ben to keep out of it as it happened to her and not him.

Ben confronts Luke with what he has been told and Luke tells Ben that James wants to meet him. Ben takes a hammer when he meets James and without Luke's presence, Ben threatens James, but James insists to Ben that he and Kathy were having an affair and she consented. As Ben about to attacks James, Luke rush in and pulls Ben off James, who tells Ben he knows he doesn't trust or believe Kathy. Kathy decides to leave Walford, especially when she finds out Ben met James, but Kathy opts to remain and gives Ben's relationship with Luke her blessing. However before they get back together, Luke ends the relationship when Ben discovers Project Dagmar that Luke is secretly working on, which reveals that it will change Albert Square with a block of flats that is to replace The Queen Vic. Kathy and Ian are shocked when James, his brother-in-law [[Hugo Browning]] ([[Simon Williams (actor)|Simon Williams]]) and Luke arrive at Albert Square to serve the Carters with an eviction notice. Kathy is angry with Ian when Luke reveals Weyland owns the café. Kathy confronts Fi over what James did to her and about all the women James has destroyed, including her own mother. Kathy refuses to go into work and when she spills some hot food, Ian catches her making her hands sore through cleaning and Kathy breaks down to Ian, admitting she has not overcome what James has done to her. Ian arranges to meet James and tapes their conversation, where James initially tells Ian that he and Kathy loved each other, but he admits to raping Kathy. James deletes the recording when Ian is restrained and when Fi comes to realise what James is like, Fi asks Kathy about the rape and her version causes Fi to be physically sick. When James shows Fi documents that could ruin him, Fi says she believes he did rape Kathy and when James goes to see Kathy, Kathy pretends to accept his idea of them being together, but she grabs him by the genitals and stands up for herself. Fi later disowns James and gives Kathy back the café before leaving.

== Character creation ==

===Background===
Kathy Beale was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of ''EastEnders'', [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]]. Kathy was a member of the first family of ''EastEnders'', [[Beale family|the Beales and Fowlers]]. Holland took the inspiration for some of the series' earliest characters from his own London family and background. Kathy's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, ''[[EastEnders books|EastEnders: The Inside Story]]''.

:"A hard childhood. An overcrowded, strict one - with no money but bags of misery. You either give into that, or you rebel...A lot of people think she's hard. The exterior is certainly tough - it's had to be. From a childhood surrounded by too many brothers, a heavy drinking father, and a submissive mother. A knowledge that you came from the "slum end" of the borough. The tattiest school-uniform. The least money. To be the poorest of the poor was a hell of a thing to fight against...by patience, persistence, cool dignity, the refusal to argue and fight back like a fishwife, wooing, cajoling and setting a good example, she and Pete finally became accepted - even by Lou...a moral woman with a firm sense of right and wrong, and good and bad. She finds it almost impossible to tell a lie, bitch - or accept the goods Pete sometimes brings home that have fallen off the back of lorries. It's as if she's had such a long hard fight to be thought of and accepted as a respectable/decent person, that she's frightened of anything happening that might soil that image. A great sense of humour...She's practical in that she doesn't shatter Pete's dreams even though she knows none of them will ever materialise, because she realises to do so would also shatter him...Kathy never forgets a favour." (page 55–56)&lt;ref name="insidestory"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith|first= Julia|authorlink= Julia Smith|author2=Holland, Tony |authorlink2=Tony Holland |title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|EastEnders - The Inside Story]] |year=1987|publisher=Book Club Associates|isbn=0-563-20601-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
[[File:Kathy1985.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Kathy as she appeared in 1985.]]
Holland and Smith wanted Kathy to be attractive, warm, practical, tough, funny and sexy.&lt;ref name="insidestory"/&gt; More actresses were interviewed for the role of Kathy than any other original character. Each actress possessed some of the facets of personality wanted, but not a single one had all of them.&lt;ref name="insidestory"/&gt; [[Gillian Taylforth]] was an actress that Smith and Holland had encountered during an open evening they had attended at The Anna Scher Theatre in [[Islington]], [[North London]]. They had been drawn to Taylforth because of her voice — "husky and adenoidal", which seemed at odds with her feminine appearance, which they described as "stunningly attractive".&lt;ref name="insidestory"/&gt; During the open evening, they considered Taylforth for the role of [[Sue Osman]], but she was dismissed because she was blonde rather than brunette. They briefly considered her for the role of Kathy, but she was again dismissed because she was too young for the role.&lt;ref name="insidestory"/&gt; They instead decided "to bear her in mind for the future".&lt;ref name="insidestory"/&gt;

Despite this, during the casting period in 1984, Taylforth auditioned for the role of [[Sue Osman]]. She was unsuccessful and that part went to [[Sandy Ratcliff]], however, Holland and Smith asked her back to audition for another role, the part of Kathy.&lt;ref name="gazette"&gt;"[http://www.wgazette.com/int-tayl.html Gillian Taylforth interview]", ''Walford Gazette''. URL last accessed on 2006-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith and Holland have commented that "she came into the room, bringing the whole of the 'East-end' in with her [...] In exactly half a minute she'd charmed the pants off them". She was considered perfect, apart from her age. Smith and Holland have commented in their book ''Inside Story'' that "[Taylforth] was too young! They had said so from the beginning. By rights, they should not even be interviewing her. But wasn't she perfect, apart from her age? So different from any other 'Kathy' they had seen. Fresher. More down to earth. Ages were discussed and a pocket-calculator produced. If Pete Beale had been her first boyfriend, wasn't it just possible that she could have a fourteen-year-old son? Julia and Tony were trying to talk themselves into it."&lt;ref name="insidestory"/&gt; Taylforth has commented on the audition process, "[Holland and Smith] whipped out a calculator and kept punching in numbers. 'We're trying to work out if you could be old enough to be Ian's Mum,' they said. I said, 'I can look older. I'll put my hair up. I'll have a few late nights and I promise I'll look old enough to be Ian's Mum'."&lt;ref name="gazette"/&gt;  According to Holland and Smith, Gillian Taylforth's "freshness and earthy charm" won them around and she was offered the part of Kathy.&lt;ref name="insidestory"/&gt;

==Character development==

===Personality===
Author Christine Geraghty has described Kathy as a character that could "be trusted by the audience to divine what is right and to hold firmly to that position".&lt;ref name="cultural"&gt;{{cite book |author= John Storey|title= ''Cultural Theory and Popular Culture''|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9IBy-KJVHd8C&amp;pg=PA253&amp;dq=eastenders+kathy|year=2006|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=0-13-197069-0|accessdate=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as a woman who naturally worked on behalf of the community, other characters frequently turned to Kathy for advice or support, and this was explored on-screen to greater effect in the 1980s when, as a result of the hardship she had faced in her youth, Kathy volunteered with the charity group [[The Samaritans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Edward Buscombe|title= British Television|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-874265-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that "as a result of becoming a counsellor for The Samaritans Kathy Beale 'in turn [...] increasingly [came] to adopt the role of expert advisor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= David Miller, Glasgow University Media Group, Jenny Kitzinger, Kevin Williams, Peter Beharrell|title= The Circuit of Mass Communication: Media Strategies, Representation and Audience Reception in the AIDS Crisis|year=1998|publisher=SAGE|isbn=0-8039-7703-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilary Kingsley, author of ''The EastEnders Handbook'', described Kathy in 1991 as "an attractive, bright, caring and highly moral woman, vulnerable but tough in some ways, streetwise, amusing, even witty [...] What she thinks is what she says.".&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title=  |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|isbn=9780563362920}}&lt;/ref&gt; She adds that she is "Blonde, good-looking, intelligent and industrious, on the surface Kathy's a very together lady. Underneath, though, things are very different."&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt; Kathy has been classified by Rupert Smith, author of ''EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square'', as a "drama queen", a "strong passionate [woman] who [goes] to pieces where men are concerned and always [comes] back for more".&lt;ref name="20years"&gt;{{cite book |last= Smith|first= Rupert|title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|''EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square'']] |year=2005|publisher=BBC books|isbn=0-563-52165-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued, "One woman above all others has taken it on the chin in ''EastEnders'', and that's Kathy."&lt;ref name="20years"/&gt; Author Kate Lock has noted that by the time of Kathy's last appearance, she had "acquired near-goddess status".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lock |first= Kate|title=[[EastEnders books|EastEnders Who's Who]] |year=2000|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-55178-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rape ===
One of the most notable storylines involving Kathy was her rape by yuppie bar owner [[James Willmott-Brown]], played by [[William Boyde]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/entertainment/1574982.stm The drama and crisis of soaps]", ''BBC News''. URL last accessed on 2006-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the second time that the character had been raped, as Kathy's backstory had revealed that she had been raped at the age of fourteen, resulting in a pregnancy — Kathy gave her baby daughter away for adoption, although these events were not seen on-screen, as Kathy was already in her 30s when the serial began. Taylforth has revealed that she was apprehensive about the storyline when it was originally pitched. She has commented to the ''Walford Gazette'', "I didn't think it was a great idea at first. That Kathy was being raped for the second time in her life bothered me. And second, I didn't think Wilmott-Brown was a very likely rapist. I loved working with William Boyde, and I thought he played it brilliantly. It was his idea to step up Wilmott-Brown's drinking in order for the rape to make some sense."&lt;ref name="gazette"/&gt;

The storyline was set up during 1988, as Kathy found employment at James's wine bar, "The Dagmar", causing friction between Kathy and her husband Pete who "didn't like the pub, the clientele or the clothes Kathy felt she had to wear to look good for work".&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; As James struggled with various personal and business issues simultaneously, he began to show an attraction to Kathy, leading to the storyline's eventual climax, Kathy's rape. Writer Colin Brake has commented that "all the pieces [were] in place [...] Pete was away [...] Willmott-Brown asked Kathy to stay after work for a drink. The situation got out of hand and what began as seduction ended in rape."&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; The episodes covering the rape were written by [[Tony McHale]] and are considered by the writer [[Colin Brake]] as "''EastEnders'' at its best". Some 19 million viewers tuned in to see Kathy attacked in The Dagmar wine bar's upstairs flat, on 7 July 1988, in episode 357, reportedly 2 million more than the average viewership at the time.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61095717.html VIOLENCE IN SOAPS.. TUNE IN OR TURN OFF?]", ''The Mirror''. URL last accessed on 2006-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the episodes covering the rape received criticism for showing the police as unsympathetic and unhelpful to a rape victim.&lt;ref name="first10years"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-37057-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir [[Peter Imbert]], said a scene in which Kathy was questioned following her rape was "out of date and would do nothing to encourage reporting this despicable crime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GdxAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-6YMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1562,3395365&amp;dq=eastenders&amp;hl=en|title=Police back rape scene|publisher=[[Evening Times]]|date=1988-07-15 | location=London | accessdate=2008-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story, however, continued in the next episode, when Kathy reached the police station and received very sympathetic treatment from a male [[detective]] and a [[woman police constable|WPC]]. Tony McHale had researched the subject in depth with the police and was determined to portray the broad range of ways that the police dealt with the serious subject of rape. A senior woman police officer later congratulated the programme on its even-handed and honest portrayal of the incident.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt;

The storyline has generally been received well by critics. ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper described the storyline as "a slow-burn as the tension rose over weeks and months [...] which culminated in rape and then followed Kathy sensitively through the aftermath."&lt;ref name="trouble"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/jan/07/broadcasting.bbc|title=Trouble in the Square|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2008-09-19 | location=London | first=Lucy | last=Mangan | date=2005-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included the consequences for Willmott-Brown; the BBC maintains that with their rape storylines, "the consequences of the crime are always explored, both for the attacker and the victim."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/keyfacts/stories/eastenders.shtml |title=EastEnders: Key Facts |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2008-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320055945/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/keyfacts/stories/eastenders.shtml |archivedate=March 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While in March 2008, Gareth McLean of ''The Guardian'' used Kathy Beale's rape as one of only two instances of a drama series that dealt with the subject "remotely realistically", the other being [[Sheila Grant]]'s ([[Sue Johnston]]) rape in [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Brookside]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/garethmcleanblog/2008/mar/12/toobleakfortv|title=Too bleak for TV?|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2008-09-19 | location=London | first=Gareth | last=McLean | date=2008-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one prominent critic of the storyline was [[Mary Whitehouse]] of the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association. Following the airing of the rape episode in 1988, Whitehouse branded it "totally unsuitable for family viewing". She wrote to the then [[Home Secretary]], [[Douglas Hurd]], to try to stop the episode being repeated in the soap's weekly Sunday omnibus, suggesting that it violated the BBC's own code of practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hg01AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nqULAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6295,3165645&amp;dq=eastenders&amp;hl=en|title=Whitehouse in call to ban TV rape incident|publisher=[[The Glasgow Herald]]|date=1988-07-13 | location=London | accessdate=2008-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kathy was later reunited with James Willmott-Brown in 1992 in a special three-hander episode also featuring Pete. Written by Debbie Cook, this episode allowed Kathy to finally lay to rest the ghost of her rape and convince Pete that their marriage was truly over.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; Colin Brake has said that "it also gave Gillian Taylforth a terrific acting challenge".&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; In the on-screen events, Kathy was shown to leave the serial for five months to stay with her brother and recover from the trauma of seeing James again; however, in reality, actress Gillian Taylforth had to be written out of the serial to go on [[maternity leave]].&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt;

===Domestic violence===
In 1993, Kathy was romantically paired with the character [[Phil Mitchell]], played by [[Steve McFadden]]. Writer Colin Brake has revealed that this liaison had first been suggested by the ''EastEnders''{{'}} script department three years prior, in 1990, but the idea had been rejected in favour of Kathy getting involved with pub landlord [[Eddie Royle]] ([[Michael Melia]]).&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt;

Despite various obstacles, including objection from Kathy's son Ian ([[Adam Woodyatt]]), and the public unveiling of Phil's prior affair with his sister-in-law Sharon ([[Letitia Dean]]), Phil and Kathy married in 1995 and a baby was written into their narratives the following year; Kathy becoming a mother again for the third time at the age of 46.&lt;ref name="fussing"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61259040.html|title=Danger of too much fussing|publisher=''Daily Record''|accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline was used to spread a public message, when Kathy's baby son Ben contracted a rare form of [[meningitis]], leaving him with impaired hearing and the threat of brain damage. Kathy was shown to "irrationally" blame herself for her son's condition. In 1996, Gillian Taylforth summarised her character's fears: "[Ben]'s not been very well since he was born and Kathy hasn't wanted to leave him for a minute." Ian McKee, journalist for the ''Daily Record'' added that "Ben fell ill when his mum was out for the evening. Irrationally, Kathy blames herself - but she won't trust him with anyone else"&lt;ref name="fussing"/&gt; and according to Dr Richard Lansdown of London University's Institute of Child Health, "Such extreme anxiety is only natural [...] This constant checking is very, very common when children are seriously ill."&lt;ref name="fussing"/&gt; Kathy's concern for Ben was shown to have a negative effect on her relationship with Phil, leading into the start of the couple's most notable storyline, Phil's descent into [[alcoholism]] and the consequences the condition has upon the sufferer's domestic life.

The relationship between alcohol abuse and [[domestic violence]] was explored between Phil and Kathy culminating in the slow deterioration of their marriage, which the BBC claims "gripped viewers" throughout 1997.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/309444.stm Phil stays in the Square]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on 2007-02-24.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that ''EastEnders'' were attempting to spread the message that abusive relationships are transmitted from one generation to the next within this storyline.&lt;ref name="study"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''SMIR''|accessdate=2008-10-08|title=Men Viewing Violence|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/bsc/pdfs/research/M_view.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phil is eventually shown to blame "his destructiveness on a response to self-hate: violence [...] the basis of his problem: his father had beaten him as a kid and he fears that he will do the same to his son."&lt;ref name="kominski"/&gt;

===Departure (1998)===
In November 1997, the press revealed that after 13 years playing Kathy, Gillian Taylforth had opted not to renew her contract when it expired in March 1998. Taylforth commented, "I love ''EastEnders'', it's in my blood. But after 12 years I want a bit of a change. I want to spend more time with my family and consider other offers. It was an extremely difficult decision to make but I felt this was the best time to go. I've had alternative job offers in the past, but I've always stuck with EastEnders. It's been brilliant for me and I will miss it hugely."&lt;ref name="quit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19971102/ai_n14471142?tag=content;col1 |title=EASTENDERS GILLIAN SAYS: I'M QUITTING |publisher=[[Sunday Mirror]] |accessdate=2008-09-19 |first=Millicent |last=Brown |date=1997-11-02 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, a BBC spokesperson would not confirm the departure saying, "Gilly is in discussions about taking a possible break. It is the policy that long-serving, valued, senior cast members are eligible for such breaks."&lt;ref name="quit"/&gt; However, her departure was later confirmed, with Taylforth saying that she made the decision to quit after she missed her daughter's sports day due to filming commitments on set.&lt;ref name="quit1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60681143.html|title=My family is far more important than fame|publisher=[[The People]]|accessdate=2008-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Windsor]], who plays Kathy's mother-in-law [[Peggy Mitchell]], said: "This is really sad. Gill is a wonderful actress and a very good friend."&lt;ref name="quit"/&gt; [[Steve McFadden]], who plays Kathy's estranged husband Phil Mitchell, said: "I can't believe it. I've been with her all day and she never said a thing."&lt;ref name="quit"/&gt;

The character's exit storyline revolved around her broken marriage to Phil, a prominent storyline that had been heavily featured throughout 1997. After deciding to leave Walford with her son Ben for South Africa, Kathy found herself the object of desire from several Walford residents, all keen for her to stay and form a relationship. One of the men was Grant Mitchell, her husband Phil's brother, who Kathy shared a kiss with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19980419/ai_n14477603?tag=content;col1 |title=KATH'S IN PARADISE |publisher=[[Sunday Mirror]] |accessdate=2008-09-19 |first=Rosa |last=Prince |date=1998-04-19 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite indicating to Phil that she was prepared to give their relationship one last try, he failed to rendezvous with her in time, and although he made it to the airport, he was persuaded to let her go by Ian. Kathy was shown to depart the serial on an aeroplane after a "poignant scene" showing her embracing her son Ian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19980301/ai_n14473752?tag=content;col1 |title=EastEnders' West End girls |publisher=[[Sunday Mirror]] |accessdate=2008-09-19 |date=1998-03-01 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The episodes marking Kathy's exit were screened in a one-hour special on [[Good Friday]] 10 April 1998. The episodes were also notable for being the last appearance of [[Cindy Beale]] ([[Michelle Collins]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60788658.html|title=EastEnders exit for the Beale girls.|publisher=''The Birmingham Post''|accessdate=2008-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the high-profile exits, the episodes were beaten in the ratings by rival soap ''[[Coronation Street]]'', which garnered 14 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60682751.html|title=RUNAWAY KATHY IS A LOSER|publisher=''The Mirror''|accessdate=2008-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been reported that ''EastEnders''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; producers had been hoping to topple the ratings success of ''Coronation Street''{{'s}} popular "Free Deirdre" storyline, the jailing of the Street's Deirdre Rachid for a crime she didn't commit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60264415.html|title=Rival TV soaps plot to burst Deirdre bubble; Ratings war is hotting up|publisher=''Daily Record''|accessdate=2008-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reintroduction (1999)===
When Taylforth quit, she originally suggested that she was only taking a six-month break and would return in October 1998;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60751167.html|title=Gillian's loafing around.|publisher=Sunday mercury|accessdate=2008-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this did not occur. It was reported in the press in August 1998, that only several months after her departure, ''EastEnders'' producers attempted to woo Taylforth back for a "week-long saga" to do a "Who's the baby?" storyline, with Phil, Grant and Alex Healy all possible candidates for the father of Kathy's baby. Taylforth reportedly declined the offer in order to take other roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60648239.html|title=Keep it mum...Posh and Geri are together again|publisher=[[Sunday Mirror]]|accessdate=2008-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2000 interview with the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' Taylforth commented further on her decision to leave the serial: "I left ''EastEnders'' because after 13 years I felt I really needed a break. I wanted to do other things and I knew I wasn't getting any younger. But throughout everything that has happened in my life I have had tremendous support from the people in ''EastEnders''. I love them so dearly. I still keep in touch with some of them, and my line when I left the show was, 'I won't say goodbye, just au revoir', and that is how I feel. It is nice that they have left the door open for Kathy to return."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-66440061.html|title=Interview: Gillian Taylforth - Happiness Is A Complete Family; Gillian Taylforth Talks to Annie Leask about the Trauma of Losing Two Babies and Undergoing Another Difficult Pregnancy before Finally Giving Birth to Her Son|first=Annie|last=Leask|date=29 October 2000|work=[[Sunday Mirror]]|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Off-screen "death"===
After her final departure, numerous rumours circulated in the British press predicting the character's return to the soap. In 2005 it was reported that ''EastEnders'' producers were attempting to lure Gillian Taylforth back with the offer of a £200,000 a year pay cheque. Gillian said: "I've always wanted to go back because I love ''EastEnders'' — I have great friends in the cast and always enjoyed working with [[Steve McFadden]] ([[Phil Mitchell]])."&lt;ref name="Kaffycomehome"/&gt; However, in January 2006 it was announced that the character was being killed off-screen in a storyline to facilitate the return of her young son Ben to his father Phil Mitchell. Taylforth has commented: "I was a bit upset at first because it was 13 years of my life and I didn't like the thought of being killed off. I thought she might come back to see Ian and have some illness.

She revealed that producer [[John Yorke (producer)|John Yorke]] told her that killing off Kathy was "one of the biggest mistakes they've ever made", and the writer who had decided to kill off Kathy regretted it afterwards, though said it was a "good idea at the time".

===Reintroduction (2015)===
The character made a shock unannounced return during a live segment which aired on 19 February 2015 during [[EastEnders Live Week|''EastEnders'' Live Week]] commemorating the 30th anniversary.&lt;ref name=DM022015&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2961300/The-return-Kathy-Beale-EastEnders-brings-Gillian-Taylforth-s-iconic-character-dead-live-Adam-Woodyatt-celebrates-reappearance.html|title=The return of Kathy Beale: EastEnders brings Gillian Taylforth's iconic character back from the dead in live show... as Adam Woodyatt celebrates her reappearance|date=20 February 2015|first=Lucy|last=Mapstone|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[DMG Media]]|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking of her return, Gillian Taylforth said: "When Dominic [Treadwell-Collins, executive producer] approached me with his plan, I was so shocked I got into my car and burst into tears! 'Kathy' has always been so close to my heart and it's absolutely wonderful returning to the show and reprising the role." It was then confirmed that Taylforth would reprise her role indefinitely.&lt;ref name=DM022015/&gt; While Taylforth was initially only contracted to the series for six months, she said that she'd love to stay on the series for good.&lt;ref name=DM090315/&gt; Of the return, Treadwell-Collins said "Six months ago, we set ourselves that challenge of bringing Kathy back to the Square in a credible way. And I believe we have succeeded."&lt;ref name=DM022015/&gt; Taylforth revealed that she was initially hesitant about the storyline. "I couldn't understand how they could work around the fact that she could do that to her children" the actress explained.&lt;ref name=Mirror090315&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/kathy-beales-eastenders-return-inspired-6371112|title=Kathy Beale's EastEnders return inspired by 'faked death' true story of canoeist John Darwin|date=3 September 2015|first=Nicola|last=Methven|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylforth said "it had to be right."&lt;ref name=DM090315&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3220702/EastEnders-star-Gillian-Taylforth-explains-Kathy-Beale-s-return-dead-plot-twist-inspired-Canoe-Man-John-Darwin.html|title='Each story is rooted in reality': EastEnders star Gillian Taylforth explains Kathy Beale's return from the dead plot twist was inspired by 'Canoe Man' John Darwin|date=3 September 2015|first=Joanna|last=Crawley|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[DMG Media]]|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, Treadwell-Collins revealed to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' that the story was inspired by the real life [[John Darwin disappearance]] where John—also known as the Canoe man—with the help of his wife Anne faked his death in a canoe accident in March 2002 in order to claim the insurance. Kathy's husband [[Gavin Sullivan]] ([[Paul Nicholas]]) had convinced her to fake her death to keep her children safe.&lt;ref name=Mirror090315/&gt;

==Other appearances==
During the ''[[Children In Need]]'' charity appeal of 1993, the BBC produced a special two-part edition of the popular science-fiction television programme ''[[Doctor Who]]'', entitled ''[[Dimensions in Time]]''. Part of the special was shot on the ''EastEnders'' set of Albert Square in Elstree. A scene from the programme, which was set in the future, showed a grey-haired Kathy Beale selling fruit and veg from [[Mark Fowler]]'s stall with produce all priced with barcodes. Kathy, along with an elderly version of [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]), featured in promotional pictures with the [[Third Doctor]], played by [[Jon Pertwee]], and the ''Children in Need'' mascot, [[Pudsey Bear]].&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt;

==Reception==
Kathy became one of the longest running characters on the show and Gillian Taylforth was the first cast member to clock up 1,000 episodes.&lt;ref name="Kaffycomehome"&gt;"[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20050206/ai_n9500632 Kaffy Come Home] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107160801/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20050206/ai_n9500632 |date=2007-11-07 }}", ''[[Sunday Mirror]]''. URL last accessed on 2006-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the book ''Cultural Theory and Popular Culture'', Christine Geraghty has likened Kathy to the characters [[Deirdre Barlow]] from ''[[Coronation Street]]'', [[Pam Ewing]] from ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' and [[Krystle Carrington]] from ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' as they are associated "not merely with moral values but also the capacity to speak out when necessary in defence of the truth."&lt;ref name="cultural"/&gt;

In a "character decoding" study performed in the 1980s, 93 viewers (64 women and 29 men) were surveyed (27 were undergraduate students, 33 were from the Oxford subject panel, and 33 were soap viewers who responded to advertisements in a soap magazine) on 25 characters from ''EastEnders'' to discover viewers' judgements and representations of the characters, through the construction of three-dimensional, multi-dimensional scaling space. The study found that the character of Kathy Beale was labelled in the "morality/potency" category - a moral character, family-oriented, warm, likable and steady.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Sonia M. Livingstone|title= ''Making Sense of Television: The Psychology of Audience Interpretation''|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SxU6VIv8TEUC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=eastenders+kathy#PPA139,M1|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-18536-X|accessdate=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book  ''Come on Down?: Popular Media Culture in Post-war Britain'', Kathryn and Phillip Dodd have used Kathy as an example of an independent, "glamorous working-class woman". They suggest that the forging of strong, female working-class characters in soap operas is "a counterweight to the more usual celebration of masculine physicality and identification of the working class with that masculinity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dominic Strinati |author2=Stephen Wagg |title= ''Come on Down?''|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=e9Gunp4h1N4C&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=eastenders+kathy#PPA126,M1|year=1992|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-06326-4|accessdate=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a period of ratings decline and heavy media criticism aimed at ''EastEnders'' in 2005, Rupert Smith, ''The Guardian'' TV critic and author of ''EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square'', stated that Kathy was one of ''EastEnders''{{'}} best characters, the type the show was lacking at the time. He described her, along with characters [[Angie Watts]], [[Tiffany Mitchell]], [[Bianca Jackson]], [[Janine Evans]] and [[Cindy Beale]], as  "strong women who can't control their appetites".&lt;ref name="trouble"/&gt;

Writer and actress [[Jacquetta May]], who played [[Rachel Kominski]] in ''EastEnders'' in the early 1990s, has commented on Kathy and questioned whether the events that happened in her fictional life reflected "any sort of true experience". In an article she comments, "Surely no woman's life could contain such a catalogue of disasters: slum childhood, two rapes, a drug-taking daughter, product of the first rape who tops herself, a broken marriage, disastrous affairs and now an alcoholic husband who endangered their son's life." She states that Kathy's biography is a "contrast between a realistic portrayal" of a woman and familiar stereotypes —  Kathy "the good, long-suffering woman and victim".&lt;ref name="kominski"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/cularch/xeastend.html |title=Square deal|publisher=redpepper.org|accessdate=2007-05-27 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061229113716/http://www.redpepper.org.uk/cularch/xeastend.html |archivedate = 2006-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study by the Stirling Media Research Institute about violence in the media, Phil and Kathy's abusive relationship was analysed.&lt;ref name="study"/&gt; The explanation for Phil's alcoholism, his wife abuse, and the problems he has in relating to his son, was largely accepted as plausible.&lt;ref name="study"/&gt; Women found the depiction of family life and domestic violence realistic and believable and felt that soap operas such as ''EastEnders'' should deal with important social issues. They judged soap operas as suitable locations for educating the public about social issues such as domestic violence. Phil's attendance at an AA and subsequent reconciliation with Kathy was viewed, leading some male participants to question the plausibility of the speedy reunion, "One session could hardly make Phil capable of going home and opening up his feelings to [Kathy]." Several focus groups attributed the need for "such a quick dramatic fix" as indicative of the ratings war with rival soap, ''Coronation Street''. Phil's reconciliation with Kathy was also seen as "implausible", though at the same time "it was clearly accepted that according to the conventions of soap opera, there are no permanent solutions."&lt;ref name="study"/&gt; The study reported that much group discussion centred on the Alcoholics Anonymous group scene, which was, for the most part, seen as an accurate depiction of an AA group therapy session. In addition, Phil's portrayal of a suffering alcoholic was also seen as realistic and a "typical portrayal of bottled-up masculinity".&lt;ref name="study"/&gt; Comparatively, male participants were generally dismissive towards Kathy: "She attracted little sympathy or understanding. Her tendency to take some responsibility for her own plight was not countered. Her tale of being abused by men and her history of rapes were at best mentioned in passing, at worst treated disparagingly. There was a quite widely shared sense of how men and women are characterised as radically different in ''EastEnders'' and other soap operas..." A scene in which Kathy and her close friend [[Pat Butcher|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St Clement]]) show their competence as electricians, a scene that allowed the characters to "re-examine past mistakes and agree that life is hell, but you've got to keep struggling, mend the electrics ('wait for a man to do a job and you'll wait forever') and have a laugh" was felt, especially in middle-class male groups, "to be a superficial kind of feminism in line with how soap operas underscore gender differences."&lt;ref name="study"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kominski"/&gt; Gay men offered a major exception to this general indifference to Kathy's points of view; they readily espoused them.&lt;ref name="study"/&gt;

On 6 November 2017, [[Gillian Taylforth]] won the "Outstanding Achievement" accolade at the [[Inside Soap Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dainty|first1=Sophie|title=Emmerdale wins best soap at the Inside Soap Awards for the third year running|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/emmerdale/news/a842388/emmerdale-wins-best-soap-inside-soap-awards/|accessdate=6 November 2017|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{The Who Rock Operas}}

'''''Lifehouse''''' was a [[science fiction]] [[rock opera]] by [[the Who]] intended as a follow-up to ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]''. It was abandoned as a rock opera in favour of creating the traditional rock album ''[[Who's Next]]'', though its songs would appear on various albums and singles by the Who, as well as [[Pete Townshend]]{{'s}} solo albums.&lt;ref name="y"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.yesbutnobutyes.com/archives/2007/01/top_10_albums_y.html | title = Top 10 Albums You've Never Heard | work = http://www.yesbutnobutyes.com | accessdate = 2008-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, aspects of the Lifehouse project were revisited by the Who on ''[[Who Are You (song)|Who Are You]]''. In 2000, Townshend revived the Lifehouse concept with his set ''[[Lifehouse Chronicles]]''&lt;ref name="y" /&gt; and the sampler ''[[Lifehouse Elements]]''. On 1 May 2007, he released online software called ''[[The Lifehouse Method]]'' in which any "sitter" could create a musical "portrait".&lt;ref&gt;[http://petetownshend.net/lifehouse-method petetownshend.net]&lt;/ref&gt; The site is now defunct.

==Original concept==
''Lifehouse'''s story was inspired by [[Pete Townshend]]'s experiences on the ''Tommy'' tour:  "I’ve seen moments in Who gigs where the vibrations were becoming so pure that I thought the whole world was just going to stop, the whole thing was just becoming so unified."
He believed that the vibrations could become so pure that the audience would "dance themselves into oblivion". Their souls would leave their bodies and they would be in a type of heaven; a permanent state of [[Religious ecstasy|ecstasy]]. The only reason this did not happen at Who gigs was because there was a knowledge in the listener's mind that the show would end and everyone would wake up and go to work the next morning. These ideas were directly linked to the writing of philosopher [[Inayat Khan]], a [[Sufi]] musician who had written about the connection of vibration and sound with the human spirit. Another source of inspiration for Townshend was [[Meher Baba]], who claimed to be an [[Avatar]] of [[Brahman]].

What Townshend was aiming to achieve in ''Lifehouse'' was to write music that could be adapted to reflect the personalities of the audience.&lt;ref name="y" /&gt; To do this he wanted to adapt his newly acquired hardware, [[VCS3]] and [[ARP Instruments, Inc.|ARP]] synthesisers and a quadraphonic PA, to create a machine capable of generating and combining personal music themes written from computerised biographical data. Ultimately, these thematic components would merge to form a "universal chord". To help this process, the Who would encourage individuals to emerge from the audience and find a role in the music.&lt;ref name="n"&gt;''Who's Next'' 1995 Reissue Liner Notes&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Lifehouse concept==
''Lifehouse'' began as a story written around several songs. Pete Townshend: "The essence of the story-line was a kind a futuristic scene…It’s a fantasy set at a time when rock ’n’ roll didn’t exist. The world was completely collapsing and the only experience that anybody ever had was through test tubes. In a way they lived as if they were in [[television]] programmes. Everything was programmed. The enemies were people who gave us entertainment intravenously, and the heroes were savages who’d kept rock ‘n’ roll as a primitive force and had gone to live with it in the woods. The story was about these two sides coming together and having a brief battle."

Under those circumstances, a very old guru figure emerges and says ‘I remember rock music. It was absolutely amazing—it really did something to people.’ He spoke of a kind of nirvana people reached through listening to this type of music. The old man decides that he’s going to try to set it up so that the effect can be experienced eternally. Everybody would be snapped out of their programmed environment through this rock and roll-induced liberated selflessness. The Lifehouse was where the music was played, and where the young people would collect to discover rock music as a powerful catalyst — a religion as it were. "Then I began to feel ‘Well, why just simulate it? Why not try and make it happen?’"

The plan was for the Who to take over the [[Young Vic]] theatre with a regular audience, develop the new material on stage and allow the communal activity to influence the songs and performances. Individuals would emerge from the audience and find a role in the music and the film. When the concerts became strong enough, they would be filmed along with other peripheral activity from the theater. A storyline would evolve alongside the music. Although the finished film was to have many fictitious and scripted elements, the concert footage was to be authentic, and would provide the driving force for the whole production.&lt;ref name="n"/&gt;

Townshend went wild, working out a complex scenario whereby a personal profile of each concert-goer would be compiled, from the individual’s astrological chart to his hobbies, even physical appearance. All the characteristics would then be fed into a computer at the same moment, leading to one musical note culminating in mass nirvana that Townshend dubbed ‘a kind of celestial cacophony.’ This philosophy was based on the writings of Inayat Khan, a Sufi master musician who espoused the theory that matter produces heat, light, and sound in the form of unique vibrations. Taking the idea one step further, making music, which was composed of vibrations, was the pervading force of all life. Elevating its purpose to the highest level, music represented the path to restoration, the search for the one perfect universal note, which once sounded would bring harmony to the entire world. Despite Townshend’s grandiose plans, the project had its problems. The theater had its own schedule of drama productions, and wasn’t available on a regular nightly schedule that Townshend insisted was necessary for the band to sustain a "euphoric level" of performance. Townshend: "The fatal flaw…was getting obsessed with trying to make a fantasy a reality rather than letting the film speak for itself." Eventually Townshend had to let go of ''Lifehouse'' for his own sake.

Townshend’s inability to translate the ideas in his head to those around him eventually led to a nervous breakdown. "It was a disaster." No one apart from himself actually understood the whole concept of ''Lifehouse''. Even John Entwistle believed that the band were to actually stay at the Young Vic with the audience in a sort of commune. Kit Lambert, an integral part of the communication between the members of The Who, was missing. Townshend had rejected a ''Tommy'' film script written by Lambert, and later found out that he had told Universal Pictures (Who Townshend had spoken to regarding the making of the film) that Lifehouse was actually a new version of Tommy. Lambert, dejected, frustrated and hurt, had moved to New York. With ''Tommy'', Lambert had served as Townshend’s "interpreter," explaining "to the willing but befuddled people around me what I was on about." The film was indefinitely postponed until the album had been issued. The band went to [[Glyn Johns]] to produce their collection of songs, intended for a double album. They decided to shelve most of the songs in favour of a single album, hoping that it would have "a sharper focus and greater impact" than the concept of ''Lifehouse'' had become.&lt;ref name="n"/&gt;

Townshend also revisited the concept, in modified form, in his radio play and recording ''[[Psychoderelict]]'', which incorporated outtakes from the ''Lifehouse''/''Who's Next'' sessions and demos. In the plot of ''Psychoderelict'', a reclusive rock star named Ray High is lured out of retirement by a fan-letter hoax between his manager and a gossip columnist, ultimately staging and broadcasting a virtual reality concert similar to the ''Lifehouse'' climax. He continued discussion of these themes in his later opus ''[[The Boy Who Heard Music]]''.

==Plot summary==

''Lifehouse'' has three variations in its storyline:

===1971 version===
{{main|Who's Next}}

In the world the album is set in, [[pollution]] is so bad that the populace are forced to wear Lifesuits,&lt;ref name="y" /&gt; suits that could simulate all experiences in a way that no one would have to leave home.

The suits are plugged into a huge mainframe called the Grid, similar to today's [[Internet]], but which also contains tubes for sleeping gas, food, and entertainment; supposedly, someone could live out tens of thousands of lifetimes in a very short period within the Grid. The Grid is controlled by a man named Jumbo.

The story begins when a farming family in [[Scotland]] hear of a huge rock concert called Lifehouse occurring in [[London]], a sort of [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]]. Their daughter, Mary, runs away to join the concert. They don't wear Lifesuits because they are supposedly out of the pollution's range and they farm the crops that the government buys to feed the Lifesuiters. Bobby is the creator of Lifehouse. (''Bobby'' was also the tentative name of the project for a time.)  He is a hacker who broadcasts pirate radio signals advertising his concert, where the participants personal data are taken from them and converted into music, quite literally "finding your song". At the climax of the album, the authorities have surrounded the Lifehouse; then the perfect note rings forth through the combination of everybody's songs, they storm the place to find everybody has disappeared through a sort of musical nirvana, and the people observing the concert through their Lifesuits have vanished as well.

===1978 version===
{{main|Who Are You}}

Set two hundred years after the events in the ''Who's Next'' version, this tells the story of another attempt at a Lifehouse concert. The concert holders are helped by "muso", a [[cult]] that worships music, and are hated by Plusbond, the group that runs the Grid and the Lifesuits.

=== 1999 radio play version===
{{main|The Lifehouse Chronicles}}

Ray and Sally are farmers who grow, as Sally said, "dead potatoes". Their daughter, Mary, runs away from home to visit a hacker who has fascinated her with pirated radio advertisements.  Ray goes to try to find his lost child and along the way he meets his childhood self, Rayboy, and his imaginary friend, the caretaker.

==Radio play==

Pete Townshend, along with playwright Jeff Young, completed a musical radio play script of ''Lifehouse'' as a collaboration between BBC Radio Drama and Eel Pie, Townshend's publishing company.  The recorded version of this script is available on ''[[Lifehouse Chronicles]]'', and the text is available as a Simon &amp; Schuster Pocket Books, First Edition 1999, softback, 146 pages, through Eel Pie and other book sellers.

The book contains the unedited radio play script of ''Lifehouse'' as well as an introduction by Pete Townshend. The first broadcast of the radio play took place on 5 December 1999 on BBC Radio 3.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7899">Locws International is a contemporary arts organisation, based in [[Swansea]], South Wales, UK. They work with British and international artists to create visual responses to aspects of the city’s heritage, landscape and people, most notably through their Locws and Art Across the City events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arts.wales/33803|title=Arts Council of Wales|website=www.arts.wales|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artworks are often temporary and are generally [[Site-specific art|site-specific]] sculptures, installations, performances or moving image based, cited in accessible public spaces, both indoors and out.

The organisation was originally set up in 1999 by Swansea-based artists [http://www.davidhastie.info/ David Hastie] and [http://www.timdaviesartist.com/ Tim Davies]. It is an artist-led charity and maintains an ongoing educational outreach project working in schools in the Swansea area.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Locws International|last=Davies, T. &amp; Hastie, D.

'''Lucille Caudill Little''' (August 20, 1909 &amp;ndash; October 8, 2002), a [[Patronage#Arts|patron of the arts]] and philanthropist who served as president of the W. Paul and Lucille Caudill Little Foundation in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].

==Biography==
Mary Lucille Caudill was born in 1909 in [[Morehead, Kentucky|Morehead]], the county seat of [[Rowan County, Kentucky]]. She was one of five children (sisters Dr. Claire Louise Caudill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.kentuckystewarts.com/RowanCounty/LouiseCaudill1994.htm | title = Louise Caudill | accessdate=2011-05-30 | publisher = Alexander Stewart Family of Kentucky}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Patricia Caudill Eubank; and, brothers Boone Proctor Caudill and Dr. Charles Milton Caudill) of Rosetta Proctor and Judge Daniel Boone Caudill.  Her father was a lawyer and a banker as well as a popular circuit judge of the Twenty-First District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kentuckystewarts.com/RowanCounty/CaudillElectionDispute1933.htm | title = 1933 Rowan County Election Dispute 1933 | accessdate=2011-05-30 | publisher = Alexander Stewart Family of Kentucky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She attended elementary and high school in [[Morehead, Kentucky|Morehead]] and graduated from [[Hamilton College (Kentucky)|Hamilton College]], a girls finishing school in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. In the 1920s she attended eleven colleges, including [[Transylvania College]], the [[University of Kentucky]], Morehead College (now [[Morehead State University]]), and studied voice at [[Stetson College]] in Florida.  She was a member of [[Pi Beta Phi]], having been initiated into the chapter at the Ohio State University.&lt;ref&gt;''Directory of Pi Beta Phi'', 1951, p. 98. Her sister Dr. C. Louise Caudill was also a member of the Ohio Beta (Ohio State University) Chapter of Pi Beta Phi.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 she earned a bachelor's degree in voice from [[Ohio State University]], took graduate courses at [[Columbia University]] and then at [[Juilliard School of Music]] (where she earned a scholarship). She continued her studies in New York with vocal scientist Dr. Douglas Stanley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEvX3VYay8g | title = Douglas Stanley &amp; Nelson Eddy vocal technique demonstration | accessdate = 2011-05-30 | date = 2009-09-01 | publisher = YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Lily Pons]] as accompanist. After performing in New York, she served on the faculty of [[Morehead State University|Morehead State Teachers College]] where she taught speech and started up the department of theatre. Later, she served as a volunteer teacher at a P-12 private school in Lexington, [[Sayre School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ket.org/arts/lucillelittle.htm | title = Lucile Caudill Little | accessdate = 2011-05-30 | publisher = Kentucky Educational Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She married W. Paul Little, a businessman and thoroughbred breeder, in 1937 at the age of 28 and they made [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], in the heart of the Bluegrass state, their home. Paul Little was a successful thoroughbred breeder and owner, having bred Wild Again and 28 other stakes winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/11957/lexington-philanthropist-wife-of-breeder-paul-little-dead-at-93 | title = Lexington Philanthropist, Wife of Breeder Paul Little, Dead at 93 | accessdate = 2011-05-30 | last = Goode | first = Kristin Ingwell | date = 2002-10-09 | publisher = The Blood-Horse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 she was kidnapped by a young man whose father worked at Paul Little's tobacco warehouse in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].  She went to the bank to collect her own ransom of $85,000 and told the police.  They followed and, while she was on the floor in the backseat of her own car, exchanged fire with the kidnapper.

After her husband's death in 1990, Mrs. Little was the sole heir to a large fortune. In 1999, the W. Paul &amp; Lucille Caudill Little Foundation was the 9th-ranked foundation in Kentucky by total dollars donated.&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kentuckystewarts.com/RowanCounty/LucilleCaudill.htm | title = Lucille Caudill: 'I Have Called Myself a College Tramp' | accessdate = 2011-05-30 | last = Lane | first = Ed | date = October 2001 | work = One-on-One | publisher = The Alexander Stewart Family of Kentucky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Because of her training in the arts, Little focused the Paul &amp; Lucille Caudill Little Foundation in the areas of the arts and education.  The purpose of the foundation is to develop creativity mainly through the fine arts.  The Foundation was originally handled by the Bank of the Bluegrass and Trust Company, and today by the [http://bgcf.org Blue Grass Community Foundation]. Gifts are awarded quarterly to nonprofit organizations that have been in existence for at least three years.  The organizations must serve in and around Central and Eastern Kentucky, specifically Fayette, Rowan or Elliott County. Grants tend to range in amount from $5,000 to $1 million. In May 2011, however, the Foundation announced the largest awards ever presented: $2.5 million each for the Lexington Children's Theatre (Shooting Star Youtheatre outreach to Rowan and Elliott Counties) and for Morehead State University's scholarships for students primarily from Rowan or Elliott County who pursue a bachelor of arts degree in art, music or theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lanereport.com/articles/fastlane_article.cfm?id=263 | title = Little Foundation bestows $2.5M apiece to endow Morehead State, Lexington Children's Theater to promote drama in Rowan, Elliott counties | accessdate = 2011-05-30 | date = 2011-05-25 | work = The Lane Report | publisher = Lane Communications Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her involvement in the cultural life of central Kentucky led to the establishment of several entities. She founded and led the following:
* [http://www.lctonstage.org/ Lexington Children's Theatre], founded in 1939 (director in 1940),
* [http://www.studioplayers.org/ Studio Players], founded in 1952 (director),
* Lexington Council on Social Planning (president),
* Lexington Symphony (board member),
* [[Lexington Philharmonic]], founded in 1961 as the Central Kentucky Philharmonic Orchestra (board member),
* Bluegrass Girl Scout Council, now [http://www.gskentucky.org/ Wilderness Road Council] (president),
* Society of Fellows of the [http://www.lexarts.org Lexington Arts and Cultural Council], created out of 21 organizations in 1972 (board member),
* [http://www.lexarts.org/resources/artscene/ ArtsPlace] (board member),
* [http://www.ckyo.org Central Kentucky Youth Orchestra], founded in 1947 (board member),
* [http://www.lasclex.org Living Arts &amp; Science Center], founded in 1968 (board member)

Her leadership was invaluable to the following organizations:
* [[National Society of Arts and Letters]]
* Board of Trustees at [[Transylvania University]]
* Board of Trustees at [[Midway College]]
* Board of Directors of the [http://www.bankofthebluegrass.com Bank of the Bluegrass]
* [http://www.uky.edu/Libraries University of Kentucky] Library Associates Executive Committee
* [http://lexingtonopera.com/ Lexington Opera Society]
* Board of Directors, The Henry Clay Memorial Foundation at [http://www.henryclay.org Ashland, the Henry Clay Estate].

She also enjoyed singing as the soprano soloist at Central Christian Church in Lexington.

Numerous Kentucky entities have benefited from her generous contributions, including [[the Lexington Ballet]], the Opera Guild of Central Kentucky, the Headley-Whitney Museum, the Central Kentucky Women's Club, Hospice of the Bluegrass, the Salvation Army, United Campus Ministries, Lexington Theological Seminary, Midway College, First Christian Church, St. Clair Medical Center in Morehead, the Lexington Arts and Cultural Council, Lexington Musical Theatre and the Actors Guild of Lexington.  The Foundation established a permanent endowment at [[Kentucky Educational Television]] to integrate the performing arts into Kentucky's elementary education.

Even larger projects include a $1-million donation to the University of Kentucky in the 1990s to establish a combined fine arts library.  Her gift was matched by Mr. William T. Young and the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education's Research Challenge Initiative, resulting in the Lucille Caudill Little Fine Arts Library and the Learning Center Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uky.edu/Libraries/libpage.php?lweb_id=104&amp;llib_id=7&lt;ab_id=611 | title = About the Lucille Little Library | accessdate = 2011-05-30 | date = 2010-03-03 | publisher = University of Kentucky}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Little Library is the home of the [http://www.uky.edu/FineArts/Music/Niles John Jacob Niles Center for American Music].

The Lucille C. Little Theater at Transylvania University, where she was a member of the class of 1928. Another gift of $1 million to the Kentucky Horse Park Foundation will endow the International Museum of the Horse with the W. Paul Little Cultural and Learning Center. She has endowed the Lillian H. Press Distinguished Speakers Series at [[Centre College]], and recently gave $100,000 to the Commonwealth Institute for Parent Leadership.

Mrs. Little conceived the horse-themed pendulum clock which was installed in Lexington's central branch of the public library.

When asked why she chose to give her donations to art organizations, she replied:

:I wish people could feel the power of the arts. That the arts can be in their living. It has been such a power in my life and has led me into such beautiful pathways, that I would like everybody to have the experience.&lt;ref name="Lane" /&gt;

==Awards==
Little received honorary doctorate degrees from [[Transylvania University]], [[Georgetown College (Kentucky)|Georgetown College]], the [[University of Kentucky]], and [[Morehead State University]].  She was awarded the Lexington Optimist Club Cup. Her portrait was installed in the Kentucky capitol in the Kentucky Commission on Women's [https://web.archive.org/web/20120311200600/http://women.ky.gov/about/kwr.htm Kentucky Women Remembered] exhibit in March 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lyneart.com/KYWOMEN.HTM | title = Alison Lyne Portraits of 2002 Kentucky Women Remembered Honorees for Kentucky Commission on Women | accessdate = 2011-05-30 | publisher = Lyne Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began his teaching career as a professor of English at several universities in the U.S. and Canada before moving to the [[University of Toronto]] in 1946, where he remained for the rest of his life.

McLuhan is known for coining the expression "[[the medium is the message]]"&lt;!--"message" is correct here--&gt; and the term [[global village]], and for predicting the [[World Wide Web]] almost 30 years before it was invented.&lt;ref name="Levinson" /&gt; He was a fixture in media discourse in the late 1960s, though his influence began to wane in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plummer|first=Kevin|title=Historicist: Marshall McLuhan, Urban Activist|url=http://torontoist.com/2011/06/historicist_marshall_mcluhan_urban_activist/|publisher=www.torontoist.com|accessdate=September 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years after his death, he continued to be a controversial figure in academic circles.&lt;ref name="stille"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/14/arts/marshall-mcluhan-back-dustbin-history-with-internet-his-ideas-again-seem-ahead.html|title=Marshall McLuhan Is Back From the Dustbin of History; With the Internet, His Ideas Again Seem Ahead of Their Time|last=Stille|first=Alexander| date=14 October 2000|work=The New York Times|page=9|accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the arrival of the [[Internet]] and the [[World Wide Web]] interest was renewed in his work and perspective.&lt;ref name="guard08"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/feb/28/livinginmarshallmcluhansga|title=Living in Marshall McLuhan's galaxy|last=Beale|first=Nigel|date=28 February 2008|work=The Guardian|accessdate=21 March 2011|location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wired saint" /&gt;&lt;ref name="boxer"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/03/arts/critic-s-notebook-mcluhan-s-messages-echoing-on-iraq.html?scp=12&amp;sq=mcluhan&amp;st=nyt|title=CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; McLuhan's Messages, Echoing On Iraq|last=Boxer| first=Sarah|date=3 April 2003|work=The New York Times|page=1|accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==
Herbert Marshall McLuhan was born on July 21, 1911, in [[Edmonton]], Alberta, to Elsie Naomi ([[married and maiden names|née]] Hall) and Herbert Ernest McLuhan, both born in Canada. His brother Maurice was born two years later. "Marshall" was his maternal grandmother's surname. His mother was a [[Baptist]] school teacher who later became an actress; his father was a [[Methodism|Methodist]] and had a real estate business in Edmonton. That business failed when [[World War I]] broke out, and McLuhan's father enlisted in the [[Canadian Forces|Canadian army]]. After a year of service, he contracted [[influenza]] and remained in Canada, away from the front lines. After his discharge from the army in 1915, the McLuhan family moved to [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba, where Marshall grew up and went to school, attending [[Kelvin High School|Kelvin Technical School]] before enrolling in the [[University of Manitoba]] in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Manitoba, McLuhan explored his conflicted relationship with religion and turned to literature to "gratify his soul's hunger for truth and beauty,"&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1998), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edan, Tina (2003). [http://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/1977/1/MQ77929.pdf "St Marshall, Mass and the Media: Catholicism, Media Theory and Marshall McLuhan"], p. 10.

He had already earned a BA and an MA degree at Manitoba, but Cambridge required him to enroll as an undergraduate "affiliated" student, with one year's credit towards a three-year bachelor's degree, before entering any doctoral studies.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 40; McLuhan later commented  "One advantage we Westerners have is that we're under no illusion we've had an education. That's why I started at the bottom again." Marchand (1990), p 30.&lt;/ref&gt; He entered [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]] in the autumn of 1934, where he studied under [[I. A. Richards]] and [[F. R. Leavis]] and was influenced by [[New Criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, p. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; Upon reflection years afterward, he credited the faculty there with influencing the direction of his later work because of their emphasis on the ''training of perception'' and such concepts as Richards' notion of ''[[I. A. Richards#Feedforward|feedforward]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, pp. 37–47.&lt;/ref&gt; These studies formed an important precursor to his later ideas on technological forms.&lt;ref name="LAC"&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/innis-mcluhan/ Old Messengers, New Media: The Legacy of Innis and McLuhan], a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt; He received the required bachelor's degree from Cambridge in 1936&lt;ref name="Gordon, p. 94"&gt;Gordon, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; and entered their graduate program.

While studying the [[trivium]] at Cambridge, he took the first steps toward his eventual conversion to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] in 1937,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt; founded on his reading of [[G. K. Chesterton]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis H.

After consulting a minister, his father accepted the decision to convert. His mother, however, felt that his conversion would hurt his career and was inconsolable.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1990), pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan was devout throughout his life, but his religion remained a private matter.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1990), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; He had a lifelong interest in the number three&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., the trivium, the [[Trinity]]) and sometimes said that the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]] provided intellectual guidance for him.&lt;ref&gt;Associates speculated about his intellectual connection to the Virgin Mary, one saying, "He had a direct connection with the Blessed Virgin Mary.... He alluded to it very briefly once, almost fearfully, in a please-don't-laugh-at-me tone. He didn't say, 'I know this because the Blessed Virgin Mary told me,' but it was clear from what he said that one of the reasons he was so sure about certain things was that the Virgin had certified his understanding of them." (cited in Marchand, p. 51).&lt;/ref&gt; For the rest of his career, he taught in Roman Catholic institutions of higher education. From 1937 to 1944, he taught English at [[Saint Louis University]] (with an interruption from 1939–40 when he returned to Cambridge). There he taught courses on [[Shakespeare]]&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; and tutored and befriended [[Walter J. Ong]], who went on to write his PhD dissertation on a topic that McLuhan had called to his attention, and who also became a well-known authority on communication and technology.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

While the McLuhans were in England, [[World War II|war]] had broken out in Europe. For this reason, he obtained permission to complete and submit his dissertation from the United States, without having to return to Cambridge for an oral defence. In 1940, the McLuhans returned to Saint Louis University, where he continued teaching and they started a family. He was awarded a Ph.D. in December 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;  He next taught at [[Assumption University (Windsor)|Assumption College]] in [[Windsor, Ontario]] from 1944 to 1946, then moved to [[Toronto]] in 1946 where he joined the faculty of [[University of St. Michael's College|St. Michael's College]], a Catholic college of the [[University of Toronto]]. [[Hugh Kenner]] was one of his students and Canadian economist and communications scholar [[Harold Innis]] was a university colleague who had a strong influence on his work.  McLuhan wrote in 1964: "I am pleased to think of my own book ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' as a footnote to the observations of Innis on the subject of the psychic and social consequences, first of [[writing]] then of [[printing]]."&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall.

This is a reprint of McLuhan's introduction to the 1964 edition of Innis's book ''The Bias of Communication'' first published in 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s, McLuhan began the Communication and Culture seminars at the University of Toronto, funded by the [[Ford Foundation]]. As his reputation grew, he received a growing number of offers from other universities and, to keep him, the university created the [[McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology|Centre for Culture and Technology]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;  He published his first major work during this period: ''[[The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man|The Mechanical Bride]]'' (1951). The work was an examination of the effect of advertising on society and culture. He and [[Edmund Snow Carpenter|Edmund Carpenter]] also produced an important journal called ''Explorations'' throughout the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Prins and Bishop 2002&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan and Carpenter have been characterized as the [[Toronto School of communication theory]], together with [[Harold Innis]], [[Eric A. Havelock]], and [[Northrop Frye]]. During this time, McLuhan supervised the doctoral thesis of modernist writer [[Sheila Watson (writer)|Sheila Watson]] on the subject of [[Wyndham Lewis]]. He remained at the University of Toronto through 1979, spending much of this time as head of his Centre for Culture and Technology.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

McLuhan was named to the [[Albert Schweitzer]] Chair in Humanities at [[Fordham University]] in the Bronx for one year (1967–68).&lt;ref&gt;During the time at Fordham University, his son [[Eric McLuhan]] conducted what came to be known as the [[Fordham Experiment]] about the different effects of "light-on" versus "light-through" media.&lt;/ref&gt; While at Fordham, he was diagnosed with a benign brain tumour, and it was treated successfully. He returned to Toronto where he taught at the University of Toronto for the rest of his life and lived in [[Wychwood Park]], a bucolic enclave on a hill overlooking the downtown where [[Anatol Rapoport]] was his neighbour.  In 1970, he was made a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OCC|2180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the [[University of Dallas]] hosted him from April to May, appointing him to the McDermott Chair.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall McLuhan (n.d.).

Marshall and Corinne McLuhan had six children: [[Eric McLuhan|Eric]], twins Mary and Teresa, Stephanie, Elizabeth, and Michael. The associated costs of a large family eventually drove him to advertising work and accepting frequent consulting and speaking engagements for large corporations, IBM and AT&amp;T among them.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;  [[Woody Allen]]'s Oscar-winning motion picture ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977) featured McLuhan in a cameo as himself; a pompous academic arguing with Allen in a cinema queue is silenced by McLuhan suddenly appearing and saying, "You know nothing of my work."

In September 1979, he suffered a stroke which affected his ability to speak. The University of Toronto's School of Graduate Studies tried to close his research centre shortly thereafter, but was deterred by substantial protests, most notably by Woody Allen. He never fully recovered from the stroke and died in his sleep on December 31, 1980.&lt;ref name=nytimesobituary&gt;{{cite news|last=Whitman|first=Alden|title=Marshall McLuhan, Author, Dies; Declared 'Medium Is the Message'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/02/home/mcluhan-obit.html|accessdate=19 August 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 1, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major works ==
During his years at [[Saint Louis University]] (1937–1944), McLuhan worked concurrently on two projects: his doctoral [[doctoral thesis|dissertation]] and the manuscript that was eventually published in 1951 as the book ''The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man'', which included only a representative selection of the materials that McLuhan had prepared for it.

McLuhan's 1942 Cambridge University doctoral dissertation surveys the history of the verbal arts ([[grammar]], [[logic]], and [[rhetoric]]—collectively known as the [[trivium]]) from the time of [[Cicero]] down to the time of [[Thomas Nashe]].&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan's doctoral dissertation from 1942 was published by [[Gingko Press]] in March 2006. Gingko Press also plans to publish the complete manuscript of items and essays that McLuhan prepared, only a selection of which were published in his book. With the publication of these two books a more complete picture of McLuhan's arguments and aims is likely to emerge.&lt;/ref&gt; In his later publications, McLuhan at times uses the Latin concept of the ''trivium'' to outline an orderly and systematic picture of certain periods in the history of Western culture. McLuhan suggests that the [[Late Middle Ages]], for instance, were characterized by the heavy emphasis on the formal study of logic. The key development that led to the [[Renaissance]] was not the rediscovery of ancient texts but a shift in emphasis from the formal study of logic to rhetoric and grammar. Modern life is characterized by the re-emergence of grammar as its most salient feature—a trend McLuhan felt was exemplified by the [[New Criticism]] of Richards and Leavis.&lt;ref&gt;For a nuanced account of McLuhan's thought regarding Richards and Leavis, see McLuhan's "Poetic and Rhetorical Exegesis: The Case for Leavis against Richards and Empson" in the ''Sewanee Review'', volume 52, number 2 (1944): 266–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Mechanical Bride'', McLuhan turned his attention to analysing and commenting on numerous examples of persuasion in contemporary [[popular culture]]. This followed naturally from his earlier work as both dialectic and rhetoric in the classical trivium aimed at persuasion. At this point his focus shifted dramatically, turning inward to study the influence of [[mass media|communication media]] independent of their content. His famous [[aphorism]] "[[the medium is the message]]" (elaborated in his 1964 book, ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'') calls attention to this intrinsic effect of communications media.&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "the medium is the message" may be better understood in light of [[Bernard Lonergan]]'s further articulation of related ideas: at the empirical level of [[consciousness]], the medium is the message, whereas at the intelligent and rational levels of consciousness, the content is the message. This sentence uses Lonergan's terminology from ''Insight: A Study of Human Understanding'' to clarify the meaning of McLuhan's statement that "the medium is the message"; McLuhan read this when it was first published in 1957 and found "much sense" in it—in his letter of September 21, 1957, to his former student and friend, Walter J. Ong, S.J., McLuhan says, "Find much sense in Bern. Lonergan's ''Insight''" (''Letters of Marshall McLuhan'', 1987: 251). Lonergan's ''Insight'' is an extended guide to "making the inward turn": attending ever more carefully to one's own consciousness, reflecting on it ever more carefully, and monitoring one's articulations ever more carefully.  When McLuhan declares that he is more interested in [[percept]]s than [[concept]]s, he is declaring in effect that he is more interested in what Lonergan refers to as the empirical level of consciousness than in what Lonergan refers to as the intelligent level of consciousness in which concepts are formed, which Lonergan distinguishes from the rational level of consciousness in which the adequacy of concepts and of predications is adjudicated. This inward turn to attending to percepts and to the cultural conditioning of the empirical level of consciousness through the effect of communication media sets him apart from more outward-oriented studies of sociological influences and the outward presentation of self carried out by [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Erving Goffman]], [[Peter L. Berger|Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann|Luckmann]], [[Kenneth Burke]], Hugh Duncan, and others.&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan also started the journal ''Explorations'' with anthropologist [[Edmund Snow Carpenter|Edmund "Ted" Carpenter]]. In a letter to [[Walter Ong]] dated May 31, 1953, McLuhan reported that he had received a two-year grant of $43,000 from the Ford Foundation to carry out a communication project at the University of Toronto involving faculty from different disciplines, which led to the creation of the journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Plummer | first=Kevin | date=May 3, 2014 | title=Historicist: ''Explorations'' at the Vanguard of Communications Studies |  work=[[Torontoist]] | url=http://torontoist.com/2014/05/historicist-explorations-at-the-vanguard-of-communications-studies/ | access-date=August 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a Fordham lecture in 1999, [[Tom Wolfe]] suggested that a major under-acknowledged influence on McLuhan's work is the Jesuit philosopher [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] whose ideas anticipated those of McLuhan, especially the evolution of the human mind into the "[[noosphere]]".&lt;ref name="TWolfe"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzBPmRPa7ls | title = Tom Wolfe on Media, Advertising, Technology (1999) | accessdate = 23 April 2017 | last = Wolfe | first = Tom | date = December 2015 | publisher = C-SPAN | quote = 45m}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, McLuhan warns against outright dismissing or whole-heartedly accepting de Chardin's observations early on in his second published book ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' (p.&amp;nbsp;32): "This externalization of our senses creates what de Chardin calls the 'noosphere' or a technological brain for the world. Instead of tending towards a vast Alexandrian library the world has become a computer, an electronic brain, exactly as in an infantile piece of science fiction. And as our senses have gone outside us, Big Brother goes inside. So, unless aware of this dynamic, we shall at once move into a phase of panic terrors, exactly befitting a small world of tribal drums, total interdependence, and super-imposed co-existence."

In his private life, McLuhan wrote to friends saying: "I am not a fan of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. The idea that anything is better because it comes later is surely borrowed from pre-electronic technologies." Further, McLuhan noted to a Catholic collaborator: "The idea of a Cosmic thrust in one direction ... is surely one of the lamest semantic fallacies ever bred by the word ‘evolution’ .... That development should have any direction at all is inconceivable except to the highly literate community."&lt;ref name="AChrystall"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://mro.massey.ac.nz/handle/10179/778 | title = The New American Vortex (2007)| accessdate = 24 Jun 2018 | last = Chrystall | first = Andrew | date = December 2007 | publisher = Massey University | quote = 467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Mechanical Bride'' (1951) ===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
McLuhan's first book, ''[[The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man]]'' (1951), is a pioneering study in the field now known as [[popular culture]]. His interest in the critical study of popular culture was influenced by the 1933 book ''Culture and Environment'' by [[F. R. Leavis]] and Denys Thompson, and the title ''The Mechanical Bride'' is derived from a piece by the [[Dada]]ist artist, [[Marcel Duchamp]].

Like his 1962 book ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'', ''The Mechanical Bride'' is composed of a number of short essays that can be read in any order—what he styled the "mosaic approach" to writing a book. Each essay begins with a newspaper or magazine article or an advertisement, followed by McLuhan's analysis thereof. The analyses bear on aesthetic considerations as well as on the implications behind the imagery and text. McLuhan chose the ads and articles included in his book not only to draw attention to their symbolism and their implications for the corporate entities that created and disseminated them, but also to mull over what such advertising implies about the wider society at which it is aimed.

=== ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' (1962) ===
McLuhan's ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy|The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man]]'' (written in 1961, first published in Canada by [[University of Toronto Press]] in 1962) is a pioneering study in the fields of [[orality|oral culture]], [[print culture]], [[cultural studies]], and [[media ecology]].

Throughout the book, McLuhan takes pains to reveal how [[communication technology]] ([[alphabet]]ic writing, the [[printing press]], and the [[electronic media]]) affects [[cognitive]] organization, which in turn has profound ramifications for social organization:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...[I]f a new technology extends one or more of our senses outside us into the social world, then new ratios among all of our senses will occur in that particular culture. It is comparable to what happens when a new note is added to a melody. And when the sense ratios alter in any culture then what had appeared lucid before may suddenly become opaque, and what had been vague or opaque will become translucent.&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' 1962, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Movable type ====
His episodic history takes the reader from pre-alphabetic tribal humankind to the [[Electronics|electronic age]]. According to McLuhan, the invention of [[movable type]] greatly accelerated, intensified, and ultimately enabled cultural and cognitive changes that had already been taking place since the invention and implementation of the alphabet, by which McLuhan means [[phonemic orthography]]. (McLuhan is careful to distinguish the phonetic [[alphabet]] from [[logographic]]/logogramic writing systems, like [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] or [[ideograms]].)

Print culture, ushered in by the [[Gutenberg press]] in the middle of the fifteenth century, brought about the cultural predominance of the visual over the aural/oral. Quoting with approval an observation on the nature of the printed word from ''Prints and Visual Communication'' by [[William Ivins]], McLuhan remarks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In this passage [Ivins] not only notes the ingraining of lineal, sequential habits, but, even more important, points out the visual homogenizing of experience of print culture, and the relegation of auditory and other sensuous complexity to the background. [...] The technology and social effects of typography incline us to abstain from noting interplay and, as it were, "formal" causality, both in our inner and external lives. Print exists by virtue of the static separation of functions and fosters a mentality that gradually resists any but a separative and compartmentalizing or specialist outlook.&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' pp. 124–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The main concept of McLuhan's argument (later elaborated upon in ''[[The Medium Is the Massage]]'') &lt;!-- BOOK TITLE IS MASSAGE NOT MESSAGE DO NOT CHANGE --&gt;is that new technologies (like alphabets, printing presses, and even speech itself) exert a gravitational effect on cognition, which in turn affects social organization: print technology changes our perceptual habits ("visual homogenizing of experience"), which in turn affects social interactions ("fosters a mentality that gradually resists all but a... specialist outlook"). According to McLuhan, the advent of print technology contributed to and made possible most of the salient trends in the [[Modern age|Modern]] period in the [[Western world]]: [[individualism]], [[democracy]], [[Protestantism]], [[capitalism]] and [[nationalism]]. For McLuhan, these trends all reverberate with print technology's principle of "segmentation of actions and functions and principle of visual quantification."&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Global Village ====
In the early 1960s, McLuhan wrote that the visual, individualistic print culture would soon be brought to an end by what he called "electronic interdependence": when [[electronic media]] replaces [[visual culture]] with aural/oral culture. In this new age, humankind will move from individualism and fragmentation to a collective identity, with a "tribal base." McLuhan's coinage for this new social organization is the ''[[global village]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wyndham Lewis]]'s ''America and Cosmic Man'' (1948) and [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' are sometimes credited as the source of the phrase, but neither used the words "global village"  specifically as such. According to McLuhan's son [[Eric McLuhan]], his father, a ''Wake'' scholar and a close friend of Lewis, likely discussed the concept with Lewis during their association, but there is no evidence that he got the idea or the phrasing from either; McLuhan is generally credited as having coined the term. &lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/mcluhan-studies/v1_iss2/1_2art2.htm |publisher=''McLuhan Studies'' (issue 2) |title=The source of the term 'global village' |author=Eric McLuhan |year=1996 |accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is sometimes described as having negative connotations in ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'', but McLuhan himself was interested in exploring effects, not making value judgments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Instead of tending towards a vast [[Alexandrian library]] the world has become a [[computer]], an electronic brain, exactly as an infantile piece of [[science fiction]]. And as our senses have gone outside us, [[Authoritarianism|Big Brother]] goes inside. So, unless aware of this dynamic, we shall at once move into a phase of panic terrors, exactly befitting a small world of tribal drums, total interdependence, and superimposed co-existence. [...] Terror is the normal state of any oral society, for in it everything affects everything all the time. [...] In our long striving to recover for the [[Western world]] a unity of sensibility and of thought and feeling we have no more been prepared to accept the tribal consequences of such unity than we were ready for the fragmentation of the human psyche by print culture.&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Key to McLuhan's argument is the idea that technology has no ''per se'' moral bent—it is a tool that profoundly shapes an individual's and, by extension, a society's self-conception and realization:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Is it not obvious that there are always enough moral problems without also taking a moral stand on technological grounds? [...] Print is the extreme phase of alphabet culture that detribalizes or decollectivizes man in the first instance. Print raises the visual features of alphabet to highest intensity of definition. Thus print carries the individuating power of the phonetic alphabet much further than [[manuscript]] culture could ever do. Print is the technology of [[individualism]]. If men decided to modify this visual technology by an electric technology, individualism would also be modified. To raise a moral complaint about this is like cussing a buzz-saw for lopping off fingers. "But", someone says, "we didn't know it would happen." Yet even witlessness is not a moral issue. It is a problem, but not a moral problem; and it would be nice to clear away some of the moral fogs that surround our technologies. It would be good for [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The moral [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of technology's effects on cognition is, for McLuhan, a matter of perspective. For instance, McLuhan contrasts the considerable alarm and revulsion that the growing quantity of books aroused in the latter seventeenth century with the modern concern for the "end of the book". If there can be no universal moral sentence passed on technology, McLuhan believes that "there can only be disaster arising from unawareness of the causalities and effects inherent in our technologies".&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the [[World Wide Web]] was invented almost thirty years after ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'', and ten years after his death, McLuhan prophesied the web technology seen today as early as 1962:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The next medium, whatever it is—it may be the extension of consciousness—will include television as  its content, not as its environment, and will transform television into an art form. A computer as a research and communication instrument could enhance retrieval, obsolesce mass library organization, retrieve the individual's encyclopedic function and flip into a private line to speedily tailored data of a saleable kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Getto |first=Erica |url=http://www.wnyc.org/articles/features/2011/jul/15/celebrating-marshall-mcluhans-legacy/ |title=The Medium is the Massage: Celebrating Marshall McLuhan's Legacy |publisher=WNYC.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-23 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, McLuhan coined and certainly popularized the usage of the term "[[surfing]]" to refer to rapid, irregular and multidirectional movement through a heterogeneous body of documents or knowledge, e.g., statements like "[[Heidegger]] surf-boards along on the electronic wave as triumphantly as [[Descartes]] rode the mechanical wave." [[Paul Levinson]]'s 1999 book ''Digital McLuhan'' explores the ways that McLuhan's work can be better understood through the lens of the digital revolution.&lt;ref name="Levinson"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Paul Levinson | url=http://www.cyberchimp.co.uk/U75102/levinson.htm#ch3 |first=Paul|last=Levinson |title=Digital McLuhan: A Guide to the Information Millennium |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |ISBN=0-415-19251-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan frequently quoted [[Walter Ong]]'s ''Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue'' (1958), which evidently had prompted McLuhan to write ''The Gutenberg Galaxy''. Ong wrote a highly favorable review of this new book in ''America''.&lt;ref&gt;''America'' 107 (Sept. 15, 1962): 743, 747.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ong later tempered his praise, by describing McLuhan's ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' as "a racy survey, indifferent to some scholarly detail, but uniquely valuable in suggesting the sweep and depth of the cultural and psychological changes entailed in the passage from illiteracy to print and beyond."&lt;ref&gt;''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' 8 (1967): 838.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan himself said of the book, "I'm not concerned to get any kudos out of [''The Gutenberg Galaxy'']. It seems to me a book that somebody should have written a century ago. I wish somebody else had written it. It will be a useful prelude to the rewrite of ''Understanding Media'' [the 1960 NAEB report] that I'm doing now." {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

McLuhan's ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' won Canada's highest literary award, the [[Governor General's Award for English language non-fiction|Governor-General's Award for Non-Fiction]], in 1962.  The chairman of the selection committee was McLuhan's colleague at the University of Toronto and oftentime intellectual sparring partner, [[Northrop Frye]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan's most widely known work, ''[[Understanding Media|Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'' (1964), is a pioneering study in media theory. Dismayed by the way people approached and used new media such as television, McLuhan famously argued that in the modern world "we live mythically and integrally ... but continue to think in the old, fragmented space and time patterns of the pre-electric age."&lt;ref&gt;Marshall McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1964), 4&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan proposed that [[Mass media|media]] themselves, not the content they carry, should be the focus of study—popularly quoted as "the medium is the message". McLuhan's insight was that a medium affects the society in which it plays a role not by the content delivered over the medium, but by the characteristics of the medium itself. McLuhan pointed to the [[light bulb]] as a clear demonstration of this concept. A light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles or a television has programs, yet it is a medium that has a social effect; that is, a light bulb enables people to create spaces during nighttime that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that "a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence."&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Media'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; More controversially, he postulated that content had little effect on society—in other words, it did not matter if television broadcasts children's shows or violent programming, to illustrate one example—the effect of television on society would be identical.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', 18, 20&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that all media have characteristics that engage the viewer in different ways; for instance, a passage in a book could be reread at will, but a movie had to be screened again in its entirety to study any individual part of it.

==== {{anchor|Hot and cool media}}"Hot" and "cool" media ====
In the first part of ''Understanding Media,'' McLuhan also stated that different media invite different degrees of participation on the part of a person who chooses to consume a medium. Some media, like the movies, were "hot"—that is, they enhance one single [[sense]], in this case [[Visual perception|vision]], in such a manner that a person does not need to exert much effort in filling in the details of a movie image. McLuhan contrasted this with "cool" TV, which he claimed requires more effort on the part of the viewer to determine meaning, and [[comics]], which due to their minimal presentation of visual detail require a high degree of effort to fill in details that the cartoonist may have intended to portray. A movie is thus said by McLuhan to be "hot", intensifying one single sense "high definition", demanding a viewer's attention, and a comic book to be "cool" and "low definition", requiring much more conscious participation by the reader to extract value.&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Media'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Any hot medium allows of less participation than a cool one, as a lecture makes for less participation than a seminar, and a book for less than a dialogue."&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Media'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hot media usually, but not always, provide complete involvement without considerable stimulus. For example, print occupies visual space, uses visual senses, but can immerse its reader. Hot media favour analytical precision, quantitative analysis and sequential ordering, as they are usually sequential, linear and logical. They emphasize one sense (for example, of sight or sound) over the others. For this reason, hot media also include [[radio]], as well as [[film]], the [[lecture]], and [[photography]].

Cool media, on the other hand, are usually, but not always, those that provide little involvement with substantial stimulus. They require more active participation on the part of the user, including the perception of abstract patterning and simultaneous comprehension of all parts. Therefore, according to McLuhan cool media include [[television]], as well as the [[seminar]] and [[cartoons]]. McLuhan describes the term "cool media" as emerging from jazz and popular music and, in this context, is used to mean "detached."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-74-342-1818/people/mcluhan/clip4 |title=CBC Archives |publisher=Archives.cbc.ca |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2015-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Cool medium incorporates increased involvement but decreased description while hot medium is the opposite, decreased involvement and increased description. In other words, a society that appears to be actively participating in the streaming of content but not considering the effects of the tool is not allowing an "extension of ourselves." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=The Playboy Interview|last=McLuhan|first=Marshall|date=March 1969|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept appears to force media into binary categories. However, McLuhan's hot and cool exist on a continuum: they are more correctly measured on a scale than as dichotomous terms.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

==== Critiques of ''Understanding Media'' ====
Some theorists have attacked McLuhan’s definition and treatment of the word "medium" for being too simplistic.  [[Umberto Eco]], for instance, contends that McLuhan’s medium conflates channels, codes, and messages under the overarching term of the medium, confusing the vehicle, internal code, and content of a given message in his framework.&lt;ref name="Debray"&gt;{{cite web|last=Debray|first=Regis|title=Media Manifestos|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/Debray-MediaManifestos1.pdf|publisher=Columbia University Press|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Media Manifestos'', [[Régis Debray]] also takes issue with McLuhan’s envisioning of the medium.  Like Eco, he too is ill at ease with this reductionist approach, summarizing its ramifications as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The list of objections could be and has been lengthened indefinitely: confusing technology itself with its use of the media makes of the media an abstract, undifferentiated force and produces its image in an imaginary "public" for mass consumption; the magical naivete of supposed causalities turns the media into a catch-all and contagious "mana"; apocalyptic millenarianism invents the figure of a homo mass-mediaticus without ties to historical and social context, and so on.&lt;ref name="Debray" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, when ''Wired'' interviewed him in 1995, Debray stated that he views McLuhan "more as a poet than a historian, a master of intellectual collage rather than a systematic analyst ...  McLuhan overemphasizes the technology behind cultural change at the expense of the usage that the messages and codes make of that technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Joscelyne|first=Andrew|title=Debray on Technology|url=http://www.generation-online.org/p/fpdebray1.htm|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dwight Macdonald]], in turn, reproached McLuhan for his focus on television and for his "aphoristic" style of prose, which he believes left ''Understanding Media'' filled with "contradictions, non-sequiturs, facts that are distorted and facts that are not facts, exaggerations, and chronic rhetorical vagueness." &lt;ref name="Mullen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mullen|first=Megan|title=Coming to Terms with the Future He Foresaw: Marshall McLuhan’s Understanding Media|url=http://www.historyoftechnology.org/eTC/v47no2/mullen.html|accessdate=2 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105045526/http://www.historyoftechnology.org/eTC/v47no2/mullen.html|archivedate=5 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[Brian Winston]]’s ''Misunderstanding Media'', published in 1986, chides McLuhan for what he sees as his [[technological determinism|technologically deterministic]] stances.&lt;ref name="Mullen" /&gt;  [[Raymond Williams]] and [[James W. Carey]] further this point of contention, claiming:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The work of McLuhan was a particular culmination of an aesthetic theory which became, negatively, a social theory [...] It is an apparently sophisticated technological determinism which has the significant effect of indicating a social and cultural determinism [...] If the medium – whether print or television – is the cause, of all other causes, all that men ordinarily see as history is at once reduced to effects. (Williams 1990, 126/7)&lt;ref name="Mullen" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

David Carr states that there has been a long line of "academics who have made a career out of deconstructing McLuhan’s effort to define the modern media ecosystem," whether it be due to what they see as McLuhan’s ignorance toward sociohistorical context or the style of his argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carr|first=David|title=Marshall McLuhan: Media Savant|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/books/review/Carr-t.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=2 November 2011|work=The New York Times|date=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some critics have taken issue with McLuhan’s writing style and mode of argument, McLuhan himself urged readers to think of his work as "probes" or "mosaics" offering a toolkit approach to thinking about the media. His eclectic writing style has also been praised for its postmodern sensibilities&lt;ref&gt;Paul Grossweiler, ''The Method is the Message: Rethinking McLuhan through Critical Theory'' (Montreal: Black Rose, 1998), 155-81&lt;/ref&gt; and suitability for virtual space.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Levinson, ''Digital McLuhan: A Guide to the Information Millennium'' (New York: Routledge,1999), 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Medium Is the Massage:&lt;!-- "MASSAGE" IS CORRECT, EDITORS, PLEASE NOTE: "The Medium is the MASSAGE" is the correct title. Please DO NOT change "Massage" to "Message" here --&gt; An Inventory of Effects'' (1967) ===
''[[The Medium Is the Massage]]'', published in 1967, was McLuhan's best seller,&lt;ref name="wired saint"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.01/saint.marshal.html?pg=1&amp;topic=&amp;topic_set= |title=The Wisdom of Saint Marshall, the Holy Fool |last=Wolf |first=Gary |date=January 1996 |work=Wired 4.01 |accessdate=2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; "eventually selling nearly a million copies worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Initiated by [[Quentin Fiore]],&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan &amp; Fiore, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;  McLuhan adopted the term "massage" to denote the effect each medium has on the human [[sensorium]], taking inventory of the "effects" of numerous media in terms of how they "massage" the sensorium.&lt;ref&gt;According to McLuhan biographer W. Terrence Gordon, "by the time it appeared in 1967, McLuhan no doubt recognized that his original saying had become a cliché and welcomed the opportunity to throw it back on the compost heap of language to recycle and revitalize it.  But the new title is more than McLuhan indulging his insatiable taste for puns, more than a clever fusion of self-mockery and self-rescue—the subtitle is 'An Inventory of Effects,' underscoring the lesson compressed into the original saying." (Gordon, p. 175.)

However, the FAQ section on the website maintained by McLuhan's estate says that this interpretation is incomplete and makes its own leap of logic as to why McLuhan left it as is. "Why is the title of the book ''The Medium Is the Massage'' and not ''The Medium is the Message''? Actually, the title was a mistake. When the book came back from the typesetter's, it had on the cover 'Massage' as it still does. The title was supposed to have read ''The Medium is the Message'' but the typesetter had made an error. When McLuhan saw the typo he exclaimed, 'Leave it alone! It's great, and right on target!' Now there are possible four readings for the last word of the title, all of them accurate: ''Message'' and ''Mess Age'', ''Massage'' and ''Mass Age''."&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiore, at the time a prominent graphic designer and communications consultant, set about composing the visual illustration of these effects which were compiled by Jerome Agel. Near the beginning of the book, Fiore adopted a pattern in which an image demonstrating a media effect was presented with a textual synopsis on the facing page.  The reader experiences a repeated shifting of analytic registers—from "reading" typographic print to "scanning" photographic facsimiles—reinforcing McLuhan's overarching argument in this book: namely, that each medium produces a different "massage" or "effect" on the human sensorium.

In ''The Medium Is the Massage'',&lt;!-- BOOK TITLE IS MASSAGE NOT MESSAGE DO NOT CHANGE --&gt; McLuhan also rehashed the argument—which first appeared in the Prologue to 1962's ''The Gutenberg Galaxy''—that all media are "extensions" of our human senses, bodies and minds.

Finally, McLuhan described key points of change in how man has viewed the world and how these views were changed by the adoption of new media. "The technique of invention was the discovery of the nineteenth [century]", brought on by the adoption of fixed points of view and [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] by typography, while "[t]he technique of the [[suspension of judgement|suspended judgment]] is the discovery of the twentieth century", brought on by the [[bard]] abilities of radio, movies and television.&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Media'', p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

:The past went that-a-way. When faced with a totally new situation we tend always to attach ourselves to the objects, to the flavor of the most recent past. We look at the present through a [[rear-view mirror]]. We march backward into the future. Suburbia lives imaginatively in [[Bonanza]]-land.&lt;ref&gt;''The Medium is the Massage'', pp 74,5&lt;/ref&gt;

An audio recording version of McLuhan's famous work was made by Columbia Records. The recording consists of a pastiche of statements made by McLuhan ''interrupted'' by other speakers, including people speaking in various [[phonation]]s and [[falsetto]]s, discordant sounds and 1960s incidental music in what could be considered a deliberate attempt to translate the disconnected images seen on TV into an audio format, resulting in the prevention of a connected stream of conscious thought. Various audio recording techniques and statements are used to illustrate the relationship between spoken, literary speech and the characteristics of electronic audio media.  McLuhan biographer Philip Marchand called the recording "the 1967 equivalent of a McLuhan video."&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1998), p.187.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"I wouldn't be seen dead with a living work of art."—'Old man' speaking
:"Drop this jiggery-pokery and talk straight turkey."—'Middle aged man' speaking

=== ''War and Peace in the Global Village'' (1968) ===
McLuhan used [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', an inspiration for this study of war throughout history, as an indicator as to how war may be conducted in the future.

Joyce's ''Wake'' is claimed to be a gigantic cryptogram which reveals a cyclic pattern for the whole history of man through its '''Ten Thunders'''. Each "thunder" below is a 100-character portmanteau of other words to create a statement he likens to an effect that each technology has on the society into which it is introduced. In order to glean the most understanding out of each, the reader must break the portmanteau into separate words (and many of these are themselves [[portmanteau]]s of words taken from multiple languages other than English) and speak them aloud for the spoken effect of each word. There is much dispute over what each portmanteau truly denotes.

McLuhan claims that the ten thunders in ''Wake'' represent different stages in the history of man:&lt;ref&gt;''War and Peace in the Global Village'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Thunder 1: Paleolithic to Neolithic.'' Speech. Split of East/West. From herding to harnessing animals.
*''Thunder 2: Clothing as weaponry.'' Enclosure of private parts. First social aggression.
*''Thunder 3: Specialism.'' Centralism via wheel, transport, cities: civil life.
*''Thunder 4: Markets and truck gardens.'' Patterns of nature submitted to greed and power.
*''Thunder 5: Printing.'' Distortion and translation of human patterns and postures and pastors.
*''Thunder 6: Industrial Revolution.'' Extreme development of print process and individualism.
*''Thunder 7: Tribal man again.'' All choractors end up separate, private man. Return of choric.
*''Thunder 8: Movies.'' Pop art, pop Kulch via tribal radio. Wedding of sight and sound.
*''Thunder 9: Car and Plane.'' Both centralizing and decentralizing at once create cities in crisis. Speed and death.
*''Thunder 10: Television.'' Back to tribal involvement in tribal mood-mud. The last thunder is a turbulent, muddy wake, and murk of non-visual, tactile man.

=== ''From Cliché to Archetype'' (1970) ===
In his 1970 book, ''From Cliché to Archetype'', McLuhan, collaborating with [[Canadian poetry|Canadian poet]] [[Wilfred Watson]],&lt;ref name="watson"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/wilfred-watson/ |title=Watson, Wilfred |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=14 March 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202212727/http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0008487 |archivedate=2 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; approached the various implications of the verbal [[cliché]] and of the [[archetype]].  One major facet in McLuhan's overall framework introduced in this book that is seldom noticed is the provision of a new term that actually succeeds the global village; the ''global theater''.

In McLuhan's terms, a cliché is a "normal" action, phrase, etc. which becomes so often used that we are "anesthetized" to its effects.

An example of this given by McLuhan is [[Eugène Ionesco]]'s play ''[[The Bald Soprano]]'', whose dialogue consists entirely of phrases Ionesco pulled from an [[Assimil]] language book. "Ionesco originally put all these idiomatic English clichés into literary French which presented the English in the most absurd aspect possible."&lt;ref&gt;''From Cliché to Archetype'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan's ''archetype'' "is a quoted extension, medium, technology or environment." "Environment" would also include the kinds of "awareness" and cognitive shifts brought upon people by it, not totally unlike the psychological context [[Carl Jung]] described.

McLuhan also posits that there is a factor of interplay between the cliché and the archetype, or a "doubleness":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Another theme of the Wake [''[[Finnegans Wake]]''] that helps in the understanding of the paradoxical shift from cliché to archetype is 'past time are pastimes.' The dominant technologies of one age become the games and pastimes of a later age. In the 20th century, the number of 'past times' that are simultaneously available is so vast as to create cultural anarchy. When all the cultures of the world are simultaneously present, the work of the artist in the elucidation of form takes on new scope and new urgency. Most men are pushed into the artist's role. The artist cannot dispense with the principle of 'doubleness' or 'interplay' because this type of [[hendiadys]] dialogue is essential to the very structure of consciousness, awareness, and autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;''From Cliché to Archetype'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McLuhan relates the cliché-to-archetype process to the [[Theatre of the Absurd|Theater of the Absurd]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Pascal, in the seventeenth century, tells us that the heart has many reasons of which the head knows nothing. The Theater of the Absurd is essentially a communicating to the head of some of the silent languages of the heart which in two or three hundred years it has tried to forget all about. In the seventeenth century world the languages of the heart were pushed down into the unconscious by the dominant print cliché.&lt;ref&gt;''From Cliché to Archetype'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The "languages of the heart", or what McLuhan would otherwise define as oral culture, were thus made archetype by means of the printing press, and turned into cliché.

The satellite medium, McLuhan states, encloses the Earth in a man-made environment, which "ends 'Nature' and turns the globe into a repertory theater to be programmed."&lt;ref&gt;''From Cliché to Archetype'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; All previous environments (book, newspaper, radio, etc.) and their artifacts are retrieved under these conditions ("past times are pastimes"). McLuhan thereby meshes this into the term ''global theater''. It serves as an update to his older concept of the global village, which, in its own definitions, can be said to be subsumed into the overall condition described by that of the global theater.

=== ''The Global Village: Transformations in World Life and Media in the 21st Century'' (1989) ===
In his 1989 posthumous book, ''The Global Village'', McLuhan, collaborating with [[Bruce R. Powers]], provided a strong conceptual framework for understanding the cultural implications of the technological advances associated with the rise of a worldwide electronic network. This is a major work of McLuhan's because it contains the most extensive elaboration of his concept of Acoustic Space, and it provides a critique of standard 20th century communication models like the [[Shannon–Weaver model]]. McLuhan distinguishes between the existing worldview of Visual Space – a linear, quantitative, classically geometric model – and that of Acoustic Space – a holistic, qualitative order with a complex intricate paradoxical topology. "Acoustic Space has the basic character of a sphere whose focus or center is simultaneously everywhere and whose margin is nowhere."&lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The transition from Visual to Acoustic Space was not automatic with the advent of the global network, but would have to be a conscious project. The "universal environment of simultaneous electronic flow"&lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; inherently favors right-brain Acoustic Space, yet we are held back by habits of adhering to a fixed point of view. There are no boundaries to sound. We hear from all directions at once. Yet Acoustic and Visual Space are in fact inseparable. The resonant interval is the invisible borderline between Visual and Acoustic Space. This is like the television camera that the Apollo 8 astronauts focused on the Earth after they had orbited the moon.

Reading, writing, and hierarchical ordering are associated with the left brain, as are the linear concept of time and phonetic literacy. The left brain is the locus of analysis, classification, and rationality. The right brain is the locus of the spatial, tactile, and musical. "Comprehensive awareness" results when the two sides of the brain are in true balance. Visual Space is associated with the simplified worldview of Euclidean geometry, the intuitive three dimensions useful for the architecture of buildings and the surveying of land. It is too rational and has no grasp of the acoustic. Acoustic Space is multisensory.

McLuhan writes about robotism in the context of Japanese Zen Buddhism and how it can offer us new ways of thinking about technology. The Western way of thinking about technology is too much related to the left hemisphere of our brain, which has a rational and linear focus. What he called robotism might better be called androidism in the wake of ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and the novels of [[Philip K. Dick]]. Robotism-androidism emerges from the further development of the right hemisphere of the brain, creativity and a new relationship to spacetime (most humans are still living in 17th century classical Newtonian physics spacetime). Robots-androids will have much greater flexibility than humans have had until now, in both mind and body. Robots-androids will teach humanity this new flexibility. And this flexibility of androids (what McLuhan calls robotism) has a strong affinity with Japanese culture and life. McLuhan quotes from Ruth Benedict, ''The Chrysanthemum and the Sword'', an anthropological study of Japanese culture published in 1946: "Occidentals cannot easily credit the ability of the Japanese to swing from one behavior to another without psychic cost. Such extreme possibilities are not included in our experience. Yet in Japanese life the contradictions, as they seem to us, are as deeply based in their view of life as our uniformities are in ours."&lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to live in the present and instantly readjust.

==== Beyond existing communication models ====
"All Western scientific models of communication are—like the Shannon–Weaver model—linear, sequential, and logical as a reflection of the late medieval emphasis on the Greek notion of efficient causality."&lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan and Powers criticize the Shannon-Weaver model of communication as emblematic of left-hemisphere bias and linearity, descended from a print-era perversion of Aristotle's notion of efficient causality.

A third term of ''The Global Village'' that McLuhan and Powers develop at length is The Tetrad. McLuhan had begun development on the Tetrad as early as 1974.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan's Laws of the Media, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The tetrad an analogical, simultaneous four-fold pattern of transformation. "At full maturity the tetrad reveals the metaphoric structure of the artifact as having two figures and two grounds in dynamic and analogical relationship to each other." &lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the camera focused on the Earth by the Apollo 8 astronauts, the tetrad reveals figure (Moon) and ground (Earth) simultaneously. The right-brain hemisphere thinking is the capability of being in many places at the same time. Electricity is acoustic. It is simultaneously everywhere. The Tetrad, with its fourfold Möbius topological structure of enhancement, reversal, retrieval and obsolescence, is mobilized by McLuhan and Powers to illuminate the media or technological inventions of cash money, the compass, the computer, the database, the satellite, and the global media network.

== Key concepts ==

=== Tetrad of media effects ===
{{Main|Tetrad of media effects}}

In ''Laws of Media'' (1988), published posthumously by his son [[Eric McLuhan|Eric]], McLuhan summarized his ideas about [[media studies|media]] in a concise tetrad of media effects. The tetrad is a means of examining the effects on society of any technology (i.e., any medium) by dividing its effects into four categories and displaying them simultaneously. McLuhan designed the tetrad as a pedagogical tool, phrasing his laws as questions with which to consider any medium:

*What does the medium enhance?
*What does the medium make obsolete?
*What does the medium retrieve that had been obsolesced earlier?
*What does the medium flip into when pushed to extremes?

The laws of the tetrad exist simultaneously, not successively or chronologically, and allow the questioner to explore the "grammar and syntax" of the "language" of media. McLuhan departs from his mentor [[Harold Innis]] in suggesting that a medium "overheats", or reverses into an opposing form, when taken to its extreme.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

Visually, a tetrad can be depicted as four diamonds forming an X, with the name of a medium in the centre. The two diamonds on the left of a tetrad are the ''Enhancement'' and ''Retrieval'' qualities of the medium, both ''Figure'' qualities. The two diamonds on the right of a tetrad are the ''Obsolescence'' and ''Reversal'' qualities, both ''Ground'' qualities.&lt;ref name="EL"&gt;{{cite book |last=McLuhan |first=Eric |title=Electric language: understanding the present |publisher=Stoddart |year=1998 |isbn=0-7737-5972-7}}, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MediaTetrad.svg|right|thumb|250px|A blank tetrad diagram]]

Using the example of radio:

* Enhancement (figure): What the medium amplifies or intensifies. ''Radio amplifies news and music via sound.''
* Obsolescence (ground): What the medium drives out of prominence. ''Radio reduces the importance of print and the visual.''
* Retrieval (figure): What the medium recovers which was previously lost. ''Radio returns the spoken word to the forefront.''
* Reversal (ground): What the medium does when pushed to its limits. ''Acoustic radio flips into audio-visual TV.''

=== Figure and ground ===
{{Main|Figure and ground (media)}}

McLuhan adapted the [[Gestalt psychology]] idea of a ''figure and a ground'', which underpins the meaning of "The medium is the message".&lt;!--"message" is correct here--&gt; He used this concept to explain how a form of communications technology, the medium  or ''figure'', necessarily operates through its context, or ''ground''.

McLuhan believed that in order to grasp fully the effect of a new technology, one must examine figure (medium) and ground (context) together, since neither is completely intelligible without the other. McLuhan argued that we must study media in their historical context, particularly in relation to the technologies that preceded them. The present environment, itself made up of the effects of previous technologies, gives rise to new technologies, which, in their turn, further affect society and individuals.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

All technologies have embedded within them their own assumptions about [[Time- and space-bias|time and space]]. The message which the medium conveys can only be understood if the medium and the environment in which the medium is used—and which, simultaneously, it effectively creates—are analysed together. He believed that an examination of the figure-ground relationship can offer a critical commentary on culture and society.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

[[File:Marshall McLuhan Way Toronto.jpg|thumb|A portion of Toronto's St. Joseph Street is co-named Marshall McLuhan Way]]
After the publication of ''Understanding Media'', McLuhan received an astonishing amount of publicity, making him perhaps the most publicized English teacher in the twentieth century and arguably the most controversial.{{According to whom|date=January 2013}} This publicity began with the work of two California advertising executives, [[Howard Gossage]] and Gerald Feigen who used personal funds to fund their practice of "genius scouting."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Marchand, pp. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, Randall (1994). ''Where the Suckers Moon: The Life and Death of an Advertising Campaign''. NY: Vintage Books, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; Much enamoured with McLuhan's work, Feigen and Gossage arranged for McLuhan to meet with editors of several major New York magazines in May 1965 at the Lombardy Hotel in New York. Philip Marchand reports that, as a direct consequence of these meetings, McLuhan was offered the use of an office in the headquarters of both ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'', any time he needed it.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

In August 1965, Feigen and Gossage held what they called a "McLuhan festival" in the offices of Gossage's advertising agency in San Francisco. During this "festival", McLuhan met with advertising executives, members of the mayor's office, and editors from the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' magazine. More significant was the presence at the festival of [[Tom Wolfe]], who wrote about McLuhan in a subsequent article, "What If He Is Right?", published in ''[[New York Magazine]]'' and Wolfe's own ''[[The Pump House Gang]]''. According to Feigen and Gossage, their work had only a moderate effect on McLuhan's eventual celebrity: they claimed that their work only "probably speeded up the recognition of [McLuhan's] genius by about six months."&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, pp. 182–184.&lt;/ref&gt;  In any case, McLuhan soon became a fixture of media discourse. ''Newsweek'' magazine did a cover story on him; articles appeared in ''Life Magazine'', ''Harper's'', ''Fortune'', ''Esquire'', and others. Cartoons about him appeared in ''The New Yorker''.&lt;ref name="wired saint" /&gt;  In 1969, ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine published a lengthy interview with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Playboy Interview: Marshall McLuhan |date=March 1969 |work=Playboy |pages=26–27, 45, 55–56, 61, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a running gag on the popular sketch comedy ''[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In]]'', the "poet" [[Henry Gibson]] would randomly say, "Marshall McLuhan, what are you doin'?"&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1998), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan was credited with coining the phrase ''[[Turn on, tune in, drop out]]'' by its popularizer, [[Timothy Leary]], in the 1960s. In a 1988 interview with [[Neil Strauss]], Leary stated that slogan was "given to him" by McLuhan during a lunch in New York City. Leary said McLuhan "was very much interested in ideas and marketing, and he started singing something like, 'Psychedelics hit the spot / Five hundred micrograms, that’s a lot,' to the tune of a Pepsi commercial. Then he started going, 'Tune in, turn on, and drop out.'"&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Neil. ''Everybody Loves You When You're Dead: Journeys into Fame and Madness.'' New York: HarperCollins, 2011, p. 337–38&lt;/ref&gt;

During his lifetime and afterward, McLuhan heavily influenced [[cultural criticism|cultural critics]], thinkers, and media theorists such as [[Neil Postman]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Timothy Leary]], [[Terence McKenna]], [[William Irwin Thompson]], [[Paul Levinson]], [[Douglas Rushkoff]], [[Jaron Lanier]], [[Hugh Kenner]], and [[John David Ebert]], as well as political leaders such as [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-69-342-1826/life_society/mcluhan/clip8 |title=It's cool not to shave – Marshall McLuhan, the Man and his Message – CBC Archives |accessdate=2007-07-02 | work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Jerry Brown]]. [[Andy Warhol]] was paraphrasing McLuhan with his now famous "[[15 minutes of fame]]" quote. When asked in the 1970s for a way to sedate violences in [[Angola]], he suggested a massive spread of TV devices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniele Luttazzi]], interview at [[RAI Radio1]] show ''[http://www.radio.rai.it/radio1/radiounomusica/stereonotte.cfm Stereonotte] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629015942/http://www.radio.rai.it/radio1/radiounomusica/stereonotte.cfm |date=2007-06-29 }}'', July 01 2007 2:00 am. Quote: "McLuhan era uno che al premier canadese che si interrogava su un modo per sedare dei disordini in Angola, McLuhan disse, negli anni 70, 'riempite la nazione di apparecchi televisivi'; ed è quello che venne fatto; e la rivoluzione in Angola cessò." {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The character "Brian O'Blivion" in [[David Cronenberg]]'s 1983 film [[Videodrome]] is a "media oracle" based on McLuhan.&lt;ref&gt;Lamberti, Elena. ''Marshall McLuhan's Mosaic: Probing the Literary Origins of Media Studies.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, McLuhan was named as the "patron saint" of [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired Magazine'']] and a quote of his appeared on the masthead{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} for the first ten years of its publication.&lt;ref name="wired channel" /&gt; He is mentioned by name in a [[Peter Gabriel]]-penned lyric in the song "Broadway Melody of 1974".  This song appears on the [[concept album]] ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'', from [[progressive rock]] band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]].  The lyric is:  "Marshall McLuhan, casual viewin' head buried in the sand."  McLuhan is also jokingly referred to during an episode of ''[[The Sopranos]]'' entitled "[[House Arrest (The Sopranos episode)|House Arrest]]". Despite his death in 1980, someone claiming to be McLuhan was posting on a ''Wired'' mailing list in 1996. The information this individual provided convinced one writer for ''Wired'' that "if the poster was not McLuhan himself, it was a bot programmed with an eerie command of McLuhan's life and inimitable perspective."&lt;ref name="wired channel"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.01/channeling.html |title=Channeling McLuhan |last=Wolf |first=Gary |date=January 1996 |work=Wired 4.01 |accessdate=2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new centre known as the [[McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology]], formed soon after his death in 1980, was the successor to McLuhan's Centre for Culture and Technology at the [[University of Toronto]]. Since 1994, it has been part of the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Information]] and in 2008 the McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology incorporated in the Coach House Institute. The first director was literacy scholar and [[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education|OISE]] Professor David R. Olsen. From 1983 until 2008, the McLuhan Program was under the direction of Dr. [[Derrick de Kerckhove]] who was McLuhan's student and translator. From 2008 through 2015 Professor Dominique Scheffel-Dunand of [[York University]] served Director of the Program.
In 2011 at the time of his centenary the Coach House Institute established a Marshall McLuhan Centenary Fellowship program in his honor, and each year appoints up to four fellows for a maximum of two years. In May 2016 the Coach House Institute was renamed the McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology; its Interim Director was [[Seamus Ross]] (2015–16). Sarah Sharma, an Associate Professor of Media Theory from the Institute of Communication, Culture, Information and Technology (ICCIT) and the Faculty of Information (St. George), began a five-year term as director of the Coach House (2017- ). Professor Sharma's research and teaching focuses on feminist approaches to technology, including issues related to temporality and media. Professor Sharma's thematic for the 2017-2018 Monday Night Seminars at the McLuhan Centre is MsUnderstanding Media which extends and introduces feminist approaches to technology to McLuhan's formulations of technology and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chi.utoronto.ca/prof-sarah-sharma-appointed-director-mcluhan-centre/|title=Prof. Sarah Sharma Appointed Director of McLuhan Centre - McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology|date=2016-12-13|work=McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114202736/http://www.chi.utoronto.ca/prof-sarah-sharma-appointed-director-mcluhan-centre/#|archive-date=2017-11-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Toronto, [[Marshall McLuhan Catholic Secondary School]] is named after him.

'''''Mickey''''' is an American [[sitcom]] that aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 1964 to January 1965. Created and produced by Bob Fisher and Arthur Marx, the series stars [[Mickey Rooney]], and was filmed at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] Studios.

==Synopsis==

Rooney said he would have liked [[Judy Garland]] to guest star.

==Reception and cancellation==
The series failed to sustain ratings to survive the full season in its 9 p.m. Eastern time slot on Wednesdays. Its principal competition was another sitcom, ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' on CBS. [[NBC]] ran [[television movies]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;1964-1965 American network television schedule&lt;/ref&gt; 

Due to low ratings, ABC was considering canceling ''Mickey''. The network was hesitant to cancel the series due to the popularity of Sammee Tong's character who had a solid fanbase thanks to his role in ''[[Bachelor Father (U.S. TV series)|Bachelor Father]]''. In his 1991 [[autobiography]], ''Life Is Too Short'', Mickey Rooney wrote that Tong was upset by the news that the series faced cancellation. Tong, who was a heavy gambler and owed money to the mafia, needed the money from the series to pay off his debts. On October 27, 1964, Tong took an [[overdose]] of barbiturates and died at his home. Tong's death effectively ended any chance for the series' survival, and ABC canceled ''Mickey''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rooney|first=Mickey |title=Life Is Too Short|year=1991|publisher=Villard Books|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series' last episode aired on January 13, 1965.

The '''modern Indian art''' movement in [[Indian painting]] is considered to have begun in [[Calcutta]] in the late nineteenth century.The old traditions of painting had more or less died out in Bengal and new schools of art were started by the British.&lt;ref name="Bhattacharya1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhattacharya|first=Sunil Kumar|title=Trends in modern Indian art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SIs5qkjljpQC|accessdate=14 December 2011|date=1 January 1994|publisher=M.D. Publications Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=978-81-85880-21-1|pages=7–11|chapter=2. Revivalism and the Impact of the West}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, protagonists of Indian art such as [[Raja Ravi Varma]] drew on Western traditions and techniques including oil paint and easel painting. A reaction to the Western influence led to a revival in primitivism, called as the [[Bengal school of art]], which drew from the rich cultural heritage of India. It was succeeded by the [[Santiniketan]] school, led by [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s harking back to idyllic rural folk and rural life. Despite its country-wide influence in the early years, the importance of the School declined by the 'forties' and now it is as good as dead. 

==British art schools==
Oil and easel painting In India began in the starting of eighteenth century which saw many European artists, such as [[Johann Zoffany|Zoffany]], [[Tilly Kettle|Kettle]], [[William Hodges|Hodges]], [[Thomas Daniell|Thomas]] and [[William Daniell]], [[Joshua Reynolds]], [[Emily Eden]] and [[George Chinnery]] coming out to India in search of fame and fortune.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kapur|first=Geeta|editor=Turner, Caroline|title=Art and social change: contemporary art in Asia and the Pacific|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lYmfAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=12 December 2011|year=2005|publisher=Pandanus Books, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, the Australian National University|isbn=978-1-74076-046-1|pages=146–163|chapter=A Stake in Modernity – A Brief History of Modern Indian Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; The courts of the [[princely state]]s of India were an important draw for European artists due to their patronage of the visual and performing arts and also their need for European style of portraits

The merchants of the [[East India Company]] also provided a large market for native art. A distinct genre developed of watercolour painting on paper and mica in the later half of the 18th century depicting scenes of everyday life, regalia of princely courts, and native festivities and rituals. Referred to as the "[[Company style]]" or "Patna style", it flourished at first in Murshidabad and spread to other cities of British suzerainty. The style is considered by authorities to be "of hybrid style and undistinguished quality".&lt;ref name="Educational2010"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Kuiper, Kathleen|title=The Culture of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LiqloV4JnNUC&amp;pg=PA230|accessdate=10 February 2012|date=1 July 2010|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group &amp; Britannica Educational Publishing|isbn=978-1-61530-203-1|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-1857, [[John Griffiths (artist)|John Griffiths]] and [[John Lockwood Kipling]] (father of [[Rudyard Kipling]]) came out to India together; Griffith going on to head the [[Sir J. J. School of Art]] and being considered as one of the finest Victorian painters to come to India and Kipling went on to head both the J. J. School of Art and the [[Mayo School of Arts]] established in [[Lahore]] in 1878.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TOI05102007"&gt;{{cite news |title=Kipling house to become museum |author= |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-10-05/mumbai/27989345_1_kipling-house-bungalow-jsw-foundation |newspaper=Times of India |date=October 5, 2007 |accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The enlightened eighteenth-century attitude shown by an earlier generation of British towards Indian history, monuments, literature, culture and art took a turn away in the mid-nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Baron2001"&gt;{{cite book |title=An Indian Affair – From Riches to Raj |last=Baron |first=Archie |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |publisher=Channel Books |location= |isbn=978-0-7522-6160-7|page=194 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previous manifestations of Indian art were brushed away as being "dead" and the stuff of museums; "from the official British perspective, India had no living art".&lt;ref name="Cotter2008"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/20/arts/design/20bose.html |title=Indian Modernism via an Eclectic and Elusive Artist |author=Cotter, Holland |date=19 August 2008  |work=New York Times |publisher= |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To propagate Western values in art education and the colonial agenda, the British established art schools in Calcutta and Madras in 1854 and in Bombay in 1857.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt;

==Raja Ravi Varma==
[[Raja Ravi Varma]]  (1848–1906) was a remarkable self-taught [[India]]n [[Painting|painter]] from the [[princely state]] of [[Travancore]]. His exposure in the west came when he won the first prize in the [[Vienna]] Art Exhibition in 1873. Varma's paintings were also sent to the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] held in Chicago in 1893 and his work was awarded two gold medals.&lt;ref&gt;Kilimanoor Chandran, ''Ravi Varmayum Chitrakalayum''(in Malayalam), Department of Culture, Kerala, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered the first of the modernists, and, along with [[Amrita Sher-gil]] (1913–1941), the main exponents of Western techniques to develop a new aesthetic in the subjective interpretation of Indian culture with "the promise of materiality in the medium of oils and the reality-paradigm of the mirror/window format of easel painting".&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; Some other prominent Indian painters born in the 19th century are [[M. V. Dhurandhar|Mahadev Vishwanath Dhurandhar]] (1867–1944), [[A X Trindade]] (1870–1935),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Nalini Bhagwat |url=http://www.indiaart.com/Articles-and-Features/Articles-on-A-X-Trindade-by-Nalini-Bhagwat/Articles-on-A-X-Trindade-by-Nalini-Bhagwat.asp |title=Old Master A.

The work of Varma was considered to be among the best examples of the fusion of Indian traditions with the techniques of European [[academic art]], in the colonial-nationalistic framework of the 19th century. He is most remembered for his paintings of beautiful [[sari]]-clad [[women]], who were portrayed as shapely and graceful. Varma became the best-known allegorist of Indian subjects in his depiction of scenes from the [[Epic poetry|epics]] of the [[Mahabharata]] and [[Ramayana]].

Raja Ravi Varma considered his work as "establishing a new civilisational identity within the terms of 19th Century India".&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt;{{rp|147}} He aimed to form an Indian canton of art in the manner of those of the classic Greek and Roman civilisations.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; Varma's art came to play an important role in the development of the Indian national consciousness. Varma purchased a printing press which churned out oleograph copies of his paintings which graced the middle-class homes of India, many decades after he died.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; Considered a genius in his heydey, within a few years of his passing, Varma's paintings came under severe strictures for mimicking Western art.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Raja Ravi Varma died in 1906 at the age of 58. He is considered among the greatest painters in [[Indian art|the history of Indian art]].

==The Bengal School==
{{main|Bengal School of Art}}
During the colonial era, Western influences had started to make an impact on Indian art. Some artists developed a style that used Western ideas of composition, perspective and realism to illustrate Indian themes, [[Raja Ravi Varma]] being prominent among them.&lt;ref name="Mitter1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitter|first=Partha|title=Art and nationalism in colonial India, 1850–1922: occidental orientations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mRTtkri8E0C&amp;pg=PA179|accessdate=12 December 2011|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-44354-8|pages=179–215|chapter=5 – The Artist as Charismatic Individual – Raja Ravi Varma}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bengal school arose as an [[avant garde]] and nationalist movement reacting against the [[academic art]] styles previously promoted in India, both by Indian artists such as Varma and in British art schools.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt;

Following the widespread influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the [[Western world|West]], the British art teacher [[Ernest Binfield Havel]] attempted to reform the teaching methods at the [[Calcutta School of Art]] by encouraging students to imitate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniatures.&lt;ref name="Cotter2008"/&gt;
This caused immense controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Havel was supported by the artist [[Abanindranath Tagore]], a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]].&lt;ref name="Cotter2008"/&gt;

Abanindranath painted a number of works influenced by Mughal art, a style that he and Havel believed to be expressive of India's distinct spiritual qualities, as opposed to the "materialism" of the West. His best-known painting, ''Bharat Mata'' (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations. The other prominent figures of the [[Bengal school of art]] were [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], Abanindranath's elder brother, [[Jamini Roy]], [[Mukul Dey]], [[Manishi Dey]] and [[Ram Kinker Baij]], who is more famous as the pioneer of Modern Indian Sculpture. Another important figure of this era was [[Chittaprosad Bhattacharya]], who rejected the classicism of the Bengal School and its spiritual preoccupations.&lt;ref name=multi2&gt;''Manifestations II'', Rabina Karode, Delhi Art Gallery 2004, {{ISBN|81-902104-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''Hungry Bengal : a tour through Midnapur District'' included many sketches of the Bengal Famine drawn from life, as well as documentation of the persons depicted. The book was immediately banned by the British and 5000 copies were seized and destroyed. Only one copy was hidden by Chittaprosad's family and is now in the possession of the Delhi Art Gallery.

During the opening years of the 20th century, Abanindranath developed links with Japanese cultural figures such as the art historian [[Okakura Kakuzō]] and the painter [[Yokoyama Taikan]] as part of a globalised [[Modernism|Modernist]] initiative with [[pan-Asianism|pan-Asian]] tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;Arrowsmith, Rupert Richard.

Those associated with this Indo-Far Eastern model included [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]], Vinayak Shivaram Masoji, [[B.C. Sanyal]], [[Beohar Rammanohar Sinha]], and subsequently their students [[A. Ramachandran]], Tan Yuan Chameli, and a few others. The Bengal school's influence on Indian art scene gradually started alleviating with the spread of [[modernist]] ideas post-independence.

==Santiniketan==
The mantle of the Bengal School was taken up when Rabindranath Tagore established the visionary university of [[Santiniketan]], a university focussed on the preservation and upliftment of Indian culture, values and heritage.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; It included an art school "[[Kala Bhavan]]" founded in 1920–21. Though Rabindranath himself came late to painting in his long, productive life, his ideas greatly influenced Indian modernism.&lt;ref name="Mitter2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitter|first=Partha|title=The triumph of modernism: India's artists and the avant-garde, 1922–1947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=krdWkzVLSbkC|accessdate=13 December 2011|year=2007|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-86189-318-5|pages=65–72|chapter=2. The Indian Discourse of Primitivism. II – Rabindranath's Vision of Art and the Community}}&lt;/ref&gt; In private, Tagore made small drawings, coloured with inks, for which he drew inspiration for his primitivism from his unconscious.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitter2007"/&gt; In public life, Rabindranath's primitivism can be directly attributed to an anti-colonial resistance, akin to that of [[Mahatma Gandhi]].&lt;ref name="Mitter2007"/&gt;

One of the early students of Abanindranath Tagore was [[Nandalal Bose]], who subsequently became a teacher and later the Director for art.&lt;ref name="Cotter2008"/&gt; Nandalal led the school to a position of pre-eminence in the nationalistic ideology now emerging in Indian culture. The Shantiniketan school of thought emphasised that "an aesthetic was also an ethos, that art’s role was more than life-enhancing, it was world-shaping".&lt;ref name="Cotter2008"/&gt; It established an Indian version of naturalism distinct from the oriental and western schools, one example being the eschewing of oil and easel painting for work on paper drawn/coloured using watercolours, wash, tempera and ink.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; Rabindranath Tagore's dream of veneration of old values, typified by motifs such as rural folk, especially [[Santhal people|Santhal]] tribals, came to fruition in the art-related schools of [[Viswa-Bharati University]] at Santiniketan.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; Some of the prominent artists of Santiniketan school are [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]], Ramkinkar Baij, Shanko Chowdhury,  Dinkar Kowshik, [[K. G. Subramanyan]], [[Beohar Rammanohar Sinha]], Krishna Reddy, A Ramachandran, Shobha Brhma, Ramananda Bandhapadhyay, Dharma Narayan Dasgupta, Sushen Ghose,  Janak Jhankar Narzary .

===Contextual Modernism===
{{main|Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism}}
[[File:Professor R. Siva Kumar.jpg|thumb|art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]]]]
The idea of [[Contextual Modernism]] emerged in 1997 from [[R. Siva Kumar]]'s [[Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism]] as a [[postcolonial]] critical tool in the understanding of an alternative [[modernism]] in the visual arts of the erstwhile colonies like India, specifically that of the Santiniketan artists.

Several terms including [[Paul Gilroy]]’s ''counter culture of modernity'' and [[Tani Barlow]]'s ''Colonial modernity'' have been used to describe the kind of alternative modernity that emerged in non-European contexts. Professor Gall argues that ‘Contextual Modernism’ is a more suited term because "the colonial in ''colonial modernity'' does not accommodate the refusal of many in colonized situations to internalize inferiority. Santiniketan’s artist teachers’ refusal of subordination incorporated a counter vision of modernity, which sought to correct the racial and cultural essentialism that drove and characterized imperial Western modernity and modernism. Those European modernities, projected through a triumphant British colonial power, provoked nationalist responses, equally problematic when they incorporated similar essentialisms."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huichawaii.org/assets/gall,-david---overcoming-polarized-modernities.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[R. Siva Kumar]] "The Santiniketan artists were one of the first who consciously challenged this idea of modernism by opting out of both internationalist modernism and historicist indigenousness and tried to create a context sensitive modernism."&lt;ref name="humanitiesunderground.org"&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt; He had been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and thinking about their approach to art since the early 80s. The practice of subsuming [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] under the [[Bengal School of Art]] was, according to Siva Kumar, misleading. ''This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice''.&lt;ref name="humanitiesunderground.org"/&gt;

''Contextual Modernism'' in the recent past has found its usage in other related fields of studies, specially in [[Architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:444711&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-independence==
By the time of Independence in 1947, several schools of art in India provided access to modern techniques and ideas. Galleries were established to showcase these artists. Modern Indian art typically shows the influence of Western styles, but is often inspired by Indian themes and images. Major artists are beginning to gain international recognition, initially among the Indian diaspora, but also among non-Indian audiences.

The [[Progressive Artists' Group]], established shortly after India became independent in 1947, was intended to establish new ways of expressing India in the post-colonial era. Its founder was [[Francis Newton Souza]] and [[S. H. Raza]], [[M. F. Husain]] and [[Manishi Dey]] were early members. It was profoundly influential in changing the idiom of Indian art. Almost all of the major artists of India in the 1950s were associated with the group. Prominent among them were [[Akbar Padamsee]], [[Sadanand Bakre]], [[Ram Kumar (artist)|Ram Kumar]], [[Tyeb Mehta]], [[K. H. Ara]], [[H. A. Gade]] and Bal Chabda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngmaindia.gov.in/sh-pag.asp |title=Showcase – Artists Collectives |publisher=National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi |date=2012-11-09 |accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, [[Vasudeo S. Gaitonde|V. S. Gaitonde]], [[Krishen Khanna]] and [[Mohan Samant]] joined the Group. The group disbanded in 1956.

Women artists like [[B. Prabha]], [[Shanu Lahiri]], [[Arpita Singh]], [[Anjolie Ela Menon]] and [[Lalita Lajmi]] have made immense contributions to Modern Indian Art and Painting. Art historians like Prof. Rai [[Anand Krishna]] have also referred to those works of modern artistes that reflect Indian ethos. Some of the acclaimed contemporary Indian artists include [[Nagasamy Ramachandran]], [[Jitish Kallat]], [[Atul Dodiya]] and [[Geeta Vadhera]]  who has had acclaim in translating complex, Indian spiritual themes onto canvas like Sufi thought, the Upanishads and the Bhagwad Geeta.

Indian Art got a boost with the economic liberalization of the country since early 1990s. Artists from various fields now started bringing in varied styles of work. Post liberalization Indian art works not only within the confines of academic traditions but also outside it. Artists have introduced new concepts which have hitherto not been seen in Indian art. [[Devajyoti Ray]] has introduced a new genre of art called [[Pseudorealism]]. Pseudorealist Art is an original art style that has been developed entirely on the Indian soil. Pseudorealism takes into account the Indian concept of abstraction and uses it to transform regular scenes of Indian life into fantastic images.

In post-liberalization India, many artists have established themselves in the international art market like the [[Abstract art|abstract painter]] [[Natvar Bhavsar]], abstract Art painter [[Nabakishore Chanda]], and sculptor [[Anish Kapoor]] whose mammoth [[postminimalist]] artworks have acquired attention for their sheer size. Many art houses and galleries have also opened in USA and Europe to showcase Indian artworks.

'''National School of Drama''' (or '''NSD''') is a theatre training institute situated at [[New Delhi]], [[India]]. It is an autonomous organization under [[Ministry of Culture (India)|Ministry of Culture]], [[Government of India]]. It was set up in 1959 by the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]], and became an independent school in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qYfH1tOwsHcC&amp;pg=PA676&amp;dq=%22national+school+of+drama%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0 Training - National School of Drama]''The Columbia encyclopedia of modern drama'', by Gabrielle H. Cody, Evert Sprinchorn. Columbia University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|0-231-14422-9}}. ''Page 766''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 it was granted [[deemed university]] status, but in 2011 it was revoked on the institute's request.

==''History''==
The origins of the school can be traced back to a seminar in 1954, where the idea of a Central institution for theatre was mooted, subsequently, a draft scheme was prepared in 1955, and the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]], which had [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] as its president, started drawing plans for the institution. Meanwhile, elsewhere in Delhi, Bharatiya Natya Sangh (BNS) with assistance from [[UNESCO]], independently established the 'Asian Theatre Institute' (ATI) on 20 January 1958, and in July 1958, ATI was taken over by the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]] (SNA), India’s National Academy of Music, dance and drama of [[Government of India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090315/spectrum/main1.htm National School of Drama ..over the past 50 years] [[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]] 15 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ns/&gt;

In the following year, the government merged it with the newly founded school, and thus NSD was established in April 1959 under the auspices of [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]]. Initially, the school was situated at [[Nizamuddin West]] and was called 'National School of Drama and Asian Theatre Institute, whose first batch passed out in 1961. During his tenure as the director of the institution, [[Ebrahim Alkazi]] (1962–1977), not just overhauled the syllabus, but also had the students dig and build platforms for a theatre in the backyard of a rented [[Kailash Colony]] house, where NSD had moved.&lt;ref name=hin&gt;{{cite news |title=Theatre is revelation (Interview) |url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2008/02/24/stories/2008022450160500.htm |publisher=''[[The Hindu]]'' |date=24 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later when it moved to its present location, he also designed two theatres for NSD, including a 200-seat studio theatre, and the open-air Meghdoot theatre, under a banyan tree.&lt;ref name=ns/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=COkXM9n7KUcC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=%22National+School+of+Drama%22#PPA168,M1 National School of Drama] ''The World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre: Asia/Pacific'', by Don Rubin. Published by Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001. {{ISBN|0-415-26087-6}}. Page 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 it became an [[Autonomous entity|autonomous]] organization, under the erstwhile Ministry of Education and Ministry of Culture, Department of Culture, with the name 'National School of Drama' and relocated in May 1975, to its present premises at [[Bahawalpur House]], the residence of [[Bahawalpur (princely state)|Bahawalpur]] a former [[princely state]]. However, the place is generally known by adjacent (now demolished) [[Mandi House]], the former residence of Raja of erstwhile [[Mandi State|Mandi princely state]].&lt;ref name=ns/&gt; In 1999, the School organized its first National Theatre Festival, 'Bharat Rang Mahotsav', generally held during the second week of January each year.

In 2008, the institution celebrated its golden jubilee at its annual theatre festival, ''[[Bharat Rang Mahotsav]]'', with a gathering of its alumni from all over the country,&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Features/Culture_Cauldron/National_School_of_Drama_celebrates_golden_jubilee_in_style/rssarticleshow/2694072.cms National School of Drama celebrates golden jubilee in style] [[The Economic Times]], 12 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the festival’s satellite edition in Mumbai showcased plays of NSD graduates, including Ratan Thiyam’s Prologue, Bansi Kaul (Aranyadhipati Tantiya), Neelam Mansingh Chowdhury (The Suit), Sanjay Upadhyay (Harsingar), [[Baharul Islam (actor)|Baharul Islam]] (Akash), Mohan Maharishi (Dear Bapu) and [[M K Raina]] (Stay Yet Awhile).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/the-graduates/255144/|title=The Graduates|date=28 December 2007|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=2 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004221012/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/the-graduates/255144/|archivedate=4 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waman Kendre was appointed as Director the school in 2013.

===Deemed university status===
On 16 March 2005, the Government of India granted the NSD the status of [[deemed university]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page1.asp?relid=7814 National School of Drama gets Deemed University Status][[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Ministry of Human Resource Development]] 16 March 2005."The Government has declared the National School of Drama, New Delhi as Deemed to be University with immediate effect."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/mar162005/update11.asp ''NSD declared deemed university''] [[Deccan Herald]] 16 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2010 the NSD Society asked for the deemed university status to be revoked since "[it] could undermine the professional training, autonomy, and flexibility required in the creative fields such as theatre." Thus, in October 2011 the status was revoked on request of NSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2518525.ece |title=The Hindu : News / National : NSD loses deemed varsity status on own request  |work=thehindu.com |accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nea Moni''' ({{lang-el|Νέα Μονή}}, lit. "New Monastery") is an 11th-century monastery on the island of [[Chios]] that has been recognized as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. It is located on the Provateio Oros Mt. in the island's interior, about 15&amp;nbsp;km from [[Chios (town)|Chios town]]. It is well known for its [[mosaic]]s, which, together with those at [[Daphni Monastery|Daphni]] and [[Hosios Loukas]], are among the finest examples of [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|"Macedonian Renaissance" art]] in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/537 Monasteries of Daphni, Hosios Loukas and Nea Moni of Chios], World Heritage site&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The monastery was built in the mid-11th century, by [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Constantine IX Monomachos]] and his wife, Empress [[Zoe (empress)|Zoe]]. According to tradition, it is built on the location where three monks, Nikitas, Ioannes and Iosif, miraculously found an [[icon]] of the [[Virgin Mary]], hanging from a branch of [[Myrtus|myrtle]].&lt;ref name=Church&gt;[http://www.ecclesia.gr/greek/monshrines/neamonihiou.html The Nea Moni of Chios], from the Church of Greece website&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Constantine was exiled in nearby [[Lesbos]], and the monks visited him and told of a vision according to which he would eventually become emperor. Constantine promised to build a church if this should come to pass. Indeed, in 1042, Constantine became emperor, and in gratitude began constructing the monastery, dedicated to the [[Theotokos]].&lt;ref name=Church/&gt; The main church (the ''[[katholikon]]'') was inaugurated in 1049, and the complex finished in 1055, after Constantine's death.&lt;ref name=Ministry&gt;[http://www.culture.gr/h/2/gh251.jsp?obj_id=1044 The Nea Moni of Chios] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023090712/http://www.culture.gr/h/2/gh251.jsp?obj_id=1044 |date=2007-10-23 }}, from the Greek Ministry of Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arrest of Jesus (mosaic in Nea Moni, detail).jpg|thumb|Arrest of Jesus mosaic (11th)]]
[[File:Εσωτερικό - Νέα Μονή Χίου.jpg|thumb|View of the interior]]

The monastery was early on endowed with privileges: in a [[chrysobull]] of July 1049, Constantine Monomachos granted the monastery the head tax of all [[Jews]] of the island of Chios, and set the monastery apart from any superior ecclesiastic or secular hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Linder, Amnon: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nSZmYFmjwlwC The Jews in the Legal Sources of the Early Middle Ages]'', pp. 160-163&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of land grants, tax exemptions and other privileges granted by successive emperors, the monastery prospered during the Byzantine period.&lt;ref name=Ministry/&gt; Over the centuries, the monastery amassed substantial riches and became one of the wealthiest monasteries in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]. At its peak, around 1300, its estates covered one third of Chios and it is estimated that up to 800 monks belonged to it.&lt;ref name=Church/&gt; The subsequent Genoese domination reduced its wealth, but the monastery prospered again during the Ottoman era, when it was subject directly to the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], and enjoyed considerable autonomy. The late 16th-century traveler [[Samuel Purchas]] recounts that it had 200 monks, and that "alone in all Greece they had the right to use bells." During the 17th century the number of monks decreased further, but recovered in the next century. The Patriarch of Jerusalem, Chrysanthos Notaras, and the French priest Fourmont, who visited the monastery in 1725 and 1729 respectively, commented on the large numbers of monks, the quantity of relics preserved, and the beauty of the church and its decoration.

The monastery's decline began only after the [[Chios massacre|destruction of Chios]] by the Ottomans in 1822, during the [[Greek War of Independence]]. The monastery was sacked and looted, and never recovered its former glory. In 1881, an [[1881 Chios earthquake|earthquake]] added further damage to the main church, leading to the collapse of its dome, while several other buildings, like the 1512 bell-tower, were destroyed.&lt;ref name=Ministry/&gt; In 1952, due to the shortage of monks, Nea Moni was converted to a [[convent]]. According to the 2001 census, it is inhabited by only three nuns.

== Structures and architecture ==
[[File:Nea Moni (plan of kafolikon).jpg|thumb|Plan of the katholikon]]

The monastery complex covers an area of approximately 17,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and consists of the katholikon, two smaller churches (dedicated to the [[Christian cross|Holy Cross]] and to [[Saint Pantaleon|St Panteleimon]]) the dining hall ("trapeza"), the monks' cells ("kelia"), the reception hall or "[[triclinium|triklinon]]" and underground water [[cistern]] ("kinsterna"). The complex is surrounded by a wall (the original Byzantine wall was destroyed in 1822), and in the northeastern corner stands a defensive tower, in earlier times used as a library.&lt;ref name=Church/&gt; In addition, outside the walls, near the monks' cemetery, there is a small chapel to [[St Luke]].&lt;ref name=Ministry/&gt;

The katholikon is the monastery's central structure, dedicated to the [[Dormition]] of the Virgin Mary.&lt;ref name=Church/&gt; It is composed of the main church, the [[narthex|esonarthex]] and the [[narthex|exonarthex]]. The main church is of an [[octagon]]al shape, the so-called "insular" type, found in Chios and Cyprus. Although all three sections date to the 11th century, the main church suffered significant damage in 1822 and 1881, with the result that its current, rebuilt, form is different from the original. The bell tower was constructed in 1900, replacing an older one built in 1512.&lt;ref name=Ministry/&gt; Originally, the remains of the three founders were kept in the exonarthex, but most of these were destroyed during the sack of 1822.&lt;ref name=Church/&gt;

Along with the katholikon, the only remaining 11th century buildings are the partially ruined tower, the chapel of St Luke, the cistern and parts of the trapeza.&lt;ref name=Church/&gt; The cells, most of which are in a ruined state, date to the Venetian and Genovese periods. A small museum, opened in 1992, exists to the NW of the katholikon, housed in a renovated cell. The displayed artifacts date mostly from the latter 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gr/h/1/gh151.jsp?obj_id=3342 The Musemum of the Nea Moni of Chios] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605061209/http://www.culture.gr/h/1/gh151.jsp?obj_id=3342 |date=2010-06-05 }}, from the Greek Ministry of Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Views}}
'''Oblique projection''' is a simple type of technical drawing of [[graphical projection]] used for producing two-dimensional [[image]]s of three-dimensional objects. The objects are not in [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]], so they do not correspond to any view of an object that can be obtained in practice, but the technique does yield somewhat convincing and useful images.

Oblique projection is commonly used in technical drawing. The cavalier projection was used by French military artists in the 18th century to depict fortifications. Oblique projection was used almost universally by Chinese artists from the first or second centuries to the 18th century, especially when depicting rectilinear objects such as houses.&lt;ref name=Cucker299&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=269–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Graphical projection comparison.png|thumb|right|Comparison of several types of [[graphical projection]]. The presence of one or more 90&amp;deg; angles within a pictorial image is usually a good indication that the perspective is ''oblique''.]]

[[File:Oblique projection comparison.svg|thumb|right|Comparison of an oblique projection (at left) and an orthographic projection (at right) of a unit cube (colored blue). The [[foreshortening]] factor (1/2 in this example) is inversely proportional to the [[tangent]] of the angle (63.43&amp;deg; in this example) between the [[projection plane]] (colored brown) and the projection lines (dotted).]]
Oblique projection is a type of [[parallel projection]]:
* it projects an image by intersecting parallel rays (projectors)
* from the three-dimensional source object with the drawing surface (projection plane).
In both oblique projection and [[orthographic projection]], parallel lines of the source object produce parallel lines in the projected image. The projectors in oblique projection intersect the projection plane at an oblique angle to produce the projected image, as opposed to the perpendicular angle used in orthographic projection.

Mathematically, the parallel projection of the point &lt;math&gt;(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt; on the &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt;-plane gives &lt;math&gt;(x+az, y+bz, 0)&lt;/math&gt;. The constants &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; uniquely specify a parallel projection. When &lt;math&gt;a = b = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the projection is said to be "orthographic" or "orthogonal". Otherwise, it is "oblique". The constants &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are not necessarily less than 1, and as a consequence lengths measured on an oblique projection may be either larger or shorter than they were in space. In a general oblique projection, spheres of the space are projected as ellipses on the drawing plane, and not as circles as you would expect them from an orthogonal projection.

Oblique drawing is also the crudest "3D" drawing method but the easiest to master. One way to draw using an oblique view is to draw the side of the object you are looking at in two dimensions, i.e. flat, and then draw the other sides at an angle of 45°, but instead of drawing the sides full size they are only drawn with half the depth creating 'forced depth' – adding an element of realism to the object. Even with this 'forced depth', oblique drawings look very unconvincing to the eye. For this reason oblique is rarely used by professional designers or engineers.

==Oblique pictorial==
In an ''[[oblique pictorial]]'' drawing, the angles displayed among the axis, as well as the [[foreshortening]] factors (scale) are arbitrary.
More precisely, any given set of three coplanar segments originating from the same point may be construed as forming some oblique perspective of three sides of a cube. This result is known as [[Pohlke's theorem]], from the German mathematician Pohlke, who published it in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PohlkesTheorem.html Weisstein, Eric W. "Pohlke's Theorem". From MathWorld—A Wolfram Web Resource.]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The resulting distortions make the [[wikt:technique|technique]] unsuitable for formal, working drawings. Nevertheless, the distortions are partially overcome by aligning one plane of the image parallel to the plane of projection. Doing so creates a true shape image of the chosen plane. 
This specific category of oblique projections, whereby lengths along the directions &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are preserved, but lengths along direction &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; are drawn at angle using a reduction factor is very much in use for industrial drawings.
* ''Cavalier projection'' is the name of such a projection, where the length along the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis remains unscaled.&lt;ref name="pp"&gt;[http://www.mtsu.edu/~csjudy/planeview3D/tutorial-parallel.html Parallel Projections] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423160654/http://www.mtsu.edu/~csjudy/planeview3D/tutorial-parallel.html |date=23 April 2007 }} from ''PlaneView3D Online''&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Cabinet projection'', popular in furniture illustrations, is an example of such a technique, wherein the receding axis is scaled to half-size&lt;ref name="pp"/&gt; (sometimes instead two thirds the original).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Basic Engineering|series=Butterworth-Heinemann GNVQ Engineering Series|first=William|last=Bolton|publisher=BH Newnes|year=1995|isbn=9780750625845|page=140}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cavalier projection==
{{further|Mathematics and art}}

In '''cavalier projection''' (sometimes '''cavalier perspective''' or '''high view point''') a point of the object is represented by three coordinates, ''x'', ''y'' and ''z''. On the drawing, it is represented by only two coordinates, ''x″'' and ''y″''. On the flat drawing, two axes, ''x'' and ''z'' on the figure, are [[perpendicular]] and the length on these axes are drawn with a 1:1 scale; it is thus similar to the [[dimetric projection]]s, although it is not an [[axonometric projection]], as the third axis, here ''y'', is drawn in diagonal, making an arbitrary angle with the ''x″'' axis, usually 30 or 45°. The length of the third axis is not scaled.&lt;ref&gt;[{{cite web|url=http://www.tpub.com:80/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=22 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822152816/http://www.tpub.com:80/ |archivedate=22 August 2010 }}/content/draftsman/14276/css/14276_307.htm Illustrator Draftsman 3 &amp; 2 – Volume 2 Standard Practices and Theory, page 67] from {{cite web|url=http://www.tpub.com:80/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=22 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822152816/http://www.tpub.com:80/ |archivedate=22 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingrid Carlbom, Joseph Paciorek, Planar Geometric Projections and Viewing Transformations, [[ACM Computing Surveys]], v.10 n.4, pp.&amp;nbsp;465–502, Dec. 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very easy to draw, especially with pen and paper. It is thus often used when a figure must be drawn by hand, e.g. on a black board (lesson, oral examination).

The representation was initially used for military [[fortification]]s. In French, the « cavalier » (literally ''rider, horseman'', see ''[[Cavalry]]'') is an artificial hill behind the walls that allows to see the enemy above the walls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trucsmaths.free.fr/etymologie.htm#C Etymologie des maths, letter C] (French)&lt;/ref&gt; The cavalier perspective was the way the things were seen from this high point. Some also explain the name by the fact that it was the way a rider could see a small object on the ground from his horseback.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mapage.noos.fr/r.ferreol/langage/notations/notations.htm DES QUESTIONS D’ORIGINES] (French)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cabinet projection==
The term '''cabinet projection''' (sometimes '''cabinet perspective''') stems from its use in illustrations by the furniture industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Design Drawing|first1=Francis D. K.|last1=Ching|first2=Steven P.|last2=Juroszek|edition=2nd|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=9781118007372|page=205|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7TJYHdhgw8C&amp;pg=PA205}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Like cavalier perspective, one face of the projected object is parallel to the viewing plane, and the third axis is projected as going off at an angle (typically 63.4°). Unlike cavalier projection, where the third axis keeps its length, with cabinet projection the length of the receding lines is cut in half.

=== Mathematical formula ===
As a formula, if the plane facing the viewer is ''xy'', and the receding axis is ''z'', then a point ''P'' is projected like this:
:&lt;math&gt; P \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
x + \frac12 z \cos \alpha \\ y + \frac12 z \sin \alpha \\  0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
Where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the mentioned angle.

The [[transformation matrix]] is:
: &lt;math&gt; P = \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac12 \cos \alpha \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; \frac12 \sin \alpha \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively you could remove one third from the leading arm projected off the starting face, thus giving the same result.

==Military projection==
In the ''military projection'', the angles of the ''x''- and ''z''-axes are at 45°, meaning that the angle between the ''x''-axis and the ''z''-axis is 90°. That is, the ''xz''-plane is not skewed. It is rotated over 45°, though.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.compuphase.com/axometr.htm | title=The Geometry of Perspective Drawing on the Computer | accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Besides technical drawing and illustrations, [[video game]]s (especially those preceding the advent of 3D games) also often use a form of oblique projection. Examples include ''[[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]]'', ''[[Ultima VII]]'', ''[[Ultima Online]]'', ''[[EarthBound]]'', ''[[Paperboy (video game)|Paperboy]]'' and, more recently, ''[[Tibia (video game)|Tibia]]''.

'''Patent analysis''' is a family of techniques and tools for studying the information present within and attached to [[patents]], a major form of [[intellectual property]]. 
Although this has traditionally been done using spreadsheet-based [[data analysis]] methods, the field of intellectual property has witnessed a surge in the availability of software-based patent analysis tools.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

The cost structure of most patent analysis tools varies from [[freemium]] business models to annual [[subscriptions]].

'''Poljot''' ({{lang-ru|Полёт}}, literally meaning "flight"), is a brand of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]/[[Russians|Russian]] [[wristwatch]]es, produced since 1964 by the '''First Moscow Watch Factory''' ({{lang-ru|Первый Московский Часовой Завод, ПМЧЗ}}, ''Perviy Moskovskiy Chasovoy Zavod''). The flagship brand of the USSR's watch industry, Poljot produced numerous historical watches used in many important space missions, including the world's first space watch worn by [[Yuri Gagarin]].

==History==
[[File:FSWF type1 wristlet.jpg|thumb|180px|1930s' FSWF wristwatch with Dueber-Hampden designed movement]]
[[File:1930s watch from Kirov First State Watch Factory, Moscow, face with portrait of Stalin.jpg|thumb|180px|1930s watch from Kirov First State Watch Factory, Moscow. Face with portrait of Joseph Stalin.]]

Founded in 1930 under orders from [[Joseph Stalin]], the First State Watch Factory ({{lang-ru|Первый Государственный Часовой Завод - 1ГЧЗ}}) was the first large scale Soviet watch and mechanical movement manufacturer. Via its USA-based trading company [[Amtorg]], the Soviet government bought the defunct [[Ansonia Clock Company]] of [[Brooklyn, New York]] in 1929, and the [[Dueber-Hampden Watch Company]] of [[Canton, Ohio]]. It moved twenty-eight freight cars full of machinery and parts from the USA to Moscow in order to establish the factory. Twenty-one former Dueber-Hampden watchmakers, engravers and various other technicians helped to train the Russian workers in the art of watchmaking as part of the Soviet's [[first five-year plan]]. The movements of very-early products were still stamped "Dueber-Hampden, Canton, Ohio, USA" (examples of these watches are very collectible today). In 1935 the factory was named after the murdered Soviet official [[Sergei Kirov]].

As the [[Operation Barbarossa|Germans closed in on Moscow]] in 1941, the factory was hurriedly evacuated to [[Zlatoust]] ({{lang-ru|Златоу́ст}}). By 1943 the Germans were in retreat, and the factory moved back to Moscow, adopting the "First Moscow Watch Factory" name ({{lang-ru|Первый Московский Часовой Завод - 1МЧЗ}}).

In 1947 the first wristwatches under the brand name "Pobeda" and the first Marine Chronometers and Deck watches were produced. By 1951 the production of wristwatches had increased to 1.1 million. In 1975 new machinery and equipment for manufacturing complex watches was imported from Switzerland.  The first chronograph "Okean" (caliber 3133) was produced for the space station "Sojuz-23."

In 1990 production of watches and clocks reached 5 million pieces, and in 1991 the international award "Golden Trophy for Quality" was awarded in Madrid{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}.

==PMChZ watches in Space==

===Gagarin's flight===
On 12 April 1961 [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first man in space. The watch Gagarin wore was made by the First Moscow Watch Company under the name Sturmanskie, which translates to "Navigator". Today's owner of the brand, Volmax (based in both Moscow and Switzerland), is the only authorized company allowed to use Gagarin's name and likeness in watch production. Gagarin received his 15-jewel watch with a manual-wind Poljot movement when he graduated from the Soviet air force flight school in 1957. The original watches were built exclusively for the Soviet Air Force and not available to the public. Publicly available versions of the model were not released until years later. At 36&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, the original watch was small by today's standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wornandwound.com/watches-space-yuri-gagarin/|title=Watches in Space: Yuri Gagarin - Worn &amp; Wound|date=15 January 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The watch performed flawlessly in space and is currently on display at the Moscow Museum of Cosmonauts. Commemorative editions produced today are 40&amp;nbsp;mm and have a 17-jewel Poljot movement.&lt;ref&gt;https://watchalfavit.ru/articles/chasy-dlya-kosmosa/&lt;/ref&gt;

===First space walk===
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:poljot_white_strela.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Poljot-branded "Strela" chronograph]]  --&gt;In 1965 [[cosmonaut]] [[Alexei Leonov]] wore an FMWF Strela (transliteration of СТРЕЛА, which actually means "Arrow") chronograph during his historic first space walk, thus cementing Poljot's place in space history. As with Gagarin's first flight, Leonov's watch was not specially commissioned. The Strela replaced the Shturmanskie as the standard issue pilots watch.
In the late 1970s, the Strela itself was replaced by a new breed of chronographs based around the (then new) 3133 movement (an original Russian movement similar in functionality to the Swiss Valjoux 7734, but with higher number of jewels 23 vs 17 and lever movement operating at 21,600 bph vs 18,000 bph). Poljot 3133-based watches continued where their predecessors left off and were taken into space by cosmonauts from Russia, France, Germany and Ukraine. On the wrist of cosmonaut [[Valeri Polyakov]], a Poljot 3133-based watch set a space record for the longest space flight in history.

==Current status==
[[File:Poljotblueangels.jpg|thumb|200px|Chronograph Poljot "Blue Angels", caliber 3133.]]

During the Soviet era, Soviet watch brands including Poljot, but also [[Raketa]] watches, were marketed in the [[United Kingdom]] under the brand "[[Sekonda]]". Today's Sekonda company, a British distributor of ubiquitous fashion watches, has no connection to any Russian watches.
At the turn of the 21st century, the First Moscow Watch Factory began reproducing many of their most famous models as limited edition commemorative pieces.  Replicas were made of the famous 1960s Shturmanskie worn by [[Yuri Gagarin]], the 1940s Kirova pilots chronograph, and the 1970s Ocean ({{lang|ru|Океан}}) chronograph.  All of the replicas became sought-after collectibles.

In late 2003, rumours predicting the demise of the Poljot brand circulated on the Internet.  According to the rumours, the First Moscow Watch Factory was to cease producing their own models and become a source of inexpensive movements for other European watch brands. These rumours never came to fruition. Instead, in the late 2000s, the company was bought by the businessman [[Sergey Pugachyov|Sergeï Pugachev]], becoming one of the companies of his new luxury group, including: [[Hédiard]], and the channel [[Luxe TV]]. The physical remnants of First Moscow Watch Factory were purchased by a group of former Poljot employees, forming the basis for a new company, Volmax.  Volmax marketed watches under the Aviator, Buran and Shturmanskie brands using movements produced by another Russian firm, MakTime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianwatchguide.com/volmax.htm|title=Volmax Watches|website=www.russianwatchguide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Big Bird's Egg Catch''===
'''''Big Bird's Egg Catch''''' (originally ''Grover's Egg Catch''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.digitpress.com/archives/arc00084.htm|title = DP Royal Archives - Coke Wins: The True Story|website = www.digitpress.com|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a 1983 video game for the [[Atari 2600]] developed by [[Atari]] and [[Children's Computer Workshop]].&lt;ref name="Big Bird"&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Bird's Egg Catch|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/atari2600/584585-big-birds-egg-catch/data|website=GameFAQs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Big Bird's Egg Catch'', the player controls [[Big Bird]] as he saves eggs produced by chickens at the top of the screen. These eggs travel down variously contorted chutes to land safely in the basket perched on Big Bird's head. Most eggs count for a single point, but a golden egg will periodically appear that is worth five points. When an egg is dropped, a number of points are lost. At higher levels, the eggs move faster, the chutes become more convoluted, there are more egg-laying hens, and the chutes may even flash invisible. "[[Turkey in the Straw]]", the song that plays during the egg-catching, also increases in tempo.

Periodically, Big Bird will exit the screen to count his eggs. During this stage, Big Bird is seen with his basket and numbers flash on the screen progressively faster as he counts. When the total is reached, a song is played and Big Bird dances. The game ends when too many eggs are dropped or a set number of counting sessions is performed.

The '''Studio Watts Workshop''' was an arts organization founded in 1964 and based in the [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] neighborhood of Los Angeles, dedicated to providing working space for artists and offering a broad range of arts workshops for the local community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Widener|first1=Daniel|title=Black arts West : culture and struggle in postwar Los Angeles|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|isbn=9780822346678|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The principal organizers of the Studio Watts Workshop were [[jazz]] musician [[Jayne Cortez]] and accountant and arts patron James Woods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Widener|first1=Daniel|title=Black arts West : culture and struggle in postwar Los Angeles|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|isbn=9780822346678|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Woods, who worked at a local savings and loan, and his wife, a probation officer, provided the funding for the workshop's initial operating costs, because of their conviction that art could be a tool for social change. Woods found a location for the workshop, renting an empty furniture outlet on 104th Street and Grandee Avenue, and called together a group of eight artists to begin to plan what would become the Studio Watts Workshop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Widener|first1=Daniel|title=Black arts West : culture and struggle in postwar Los Angeles|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|isbn=9780822346678|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[Watts riots]] led to renewed attention on the neighborhood, there were new opportunities for support and donations that led to the group being able to provide training for about 150 students in the visual arts, writing, drama, dance, and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Colker|first1=David|last2=Lacey|first2=Marc|title=From Watts Riot Ashes: Bright Hopes, Heartaches|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-10/news/mn-2508_1_watts-riots/3|accessdate=8 March 2015|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=May 10, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to work in the Studio Watts Workshop space, artists had to agree to give public exhibitions of their work at least two times a year in Watts and in an artistic space outside the area and also to provide free instruction to any student with, in the words of James Woods, "the initiative and the desire to participate in the creative arts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adler|first1=Nancy J.|title=Arts Center Born After Watts Riot|publisher=The New York Times|date=March 19, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the early 'masters' to students were Bruce Strobridge, a painter and sculptor who also had previously served in the Army with Woods and Anna Halprin, renowned international dance performer and teacher.  Marge and Gower Champion were also early supporters.  Woods also produced and directed several plays (many original) at the Studio with student actors, to some acclaim.  The celebrated poet Wanda Coleman, later known as the "Unofficial Poet Laureate of LA" was deeply engaged with early literary efforts among students at SWW.  In the late 1960s the Ford Foundation provided program funding to Woods and the Studio for its diverse initiatives.  This was complemented by significant funding from the Doris Duke Foundation.  Many Los Angeles professionals were friends of Studio Watts Workshop and donated their time and services to its governance.  Others, such as John Blaine, worked as full-time SWW staff.  In the early years, UCLA management professor Will Mc Whinney worked with Woods on strategy and leadership issues and LA native Joel Fadem, then a Yale University grad student and later at UCLA, assisted Woods in many foundation fund raising efforts.

In 1971, the Studio Watts Workshop received a $75,000 Ford Foundation grant to study how the arts could be used in low-income housing projects and Woods used the grant, together with a grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and from other donations, to construct a 144-unit complex of rent-subsidized apartments. The Studio Watts Workshop became the Watts Community Housing Corporation, and spaces were set aside for arts workshops and gallery. Beginning in the 1970s, federal arts funding was drastically reduced and the Watts Community Housing Corporation could no longer support arts activity. In 1992, Woods, who was on the board of the Watts Community Housing Corporation, was continuing his efforts to advocate with the Department of Housing and Urban Development for allocating a part of the complex's rent income for arts programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Colker|first1=David|last2=Lacey|first2=Marc|title=From Watts Riot Ashes: Bright Hopes, Heartaches|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-10/news/mn-2508_1_watts-riots/3|accessdate=8 March 2015|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=May 10, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

One of the studio's best-known projects was an annual Chalk-In, first held in 1968 as a way to encourage community participation in the arts. Young people were invited to draw on a block-long section of sidewalk on 103rd Street.  Twelve-year-old [[Richard Wyatt, Jr.|Richard Wyatt]] won the top prize at the first Chalk-In and credits the experience for starting him on his career as a prominent Los Angeles muralist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Colker|first1=David|last2=Lacey|first2=Marc|title=From Watts Riot Ashes: Bright Hopes, Heartaches|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-10/news/mn-2508_1_watts-riots/3|accessdate=8 March 2015|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=May 10, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Studio efforts to integrate the arts into the Watts community included design programs, media production classes and facilities, a folk art archive, and dance, theater and other arts productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herbst|first1=Robby|title=Ceremony of Us|url=http://www.eastofborneo.org/articles/ceremony-of-us|website=East of Borneo|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of Woods' active involvement in the Watts arts community, in 1968 he was invited by the [[Los Angeles Music Center]] to organize the first Los Angeles Festival of the Performing Arts. Even while moonlighting as a doorman at a Hollywood jazz club (Shelly's Manne-Hole), he would go on to organize the second and third festivals (in 1969 and 1970), and artists affiliated with the Studio Watts Workshop were among the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herbst|first1=Robby|title=Ceremony of Us|url=http://www.eastofborneo.org/articles/ceremony-of-us|website=East of Borneo|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the period when Studio Watts transitioned into low cost housing with artists-in-residence as a component, Woods also was instrumental in organizing "The Meeting at Watts Towers," a venue attracting both the new and old of the Watts community to honor its past, raise awareness on current issues, and celebrate the future. A comprehensive review of community arts in Watts may be found in "Watts: Art and Social Change in Los Angeles, 1965-2002" the 2003 exhibition catalogue of Marquette University's Haggerty Museum of Art, curated by Director, Curtis Carter (complete 68-page catalogue available on line).

'''Sue Ellen Ewing''' (maiden name '''Shepard''') is a [[fictional character]] and one of the female leads in the [[CBS]] primetime [[soap opera]] ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' and its [[Dallas (2012 TV series)|continuation series]]. Sue Ellen is portrayed by actress [[Linda Gray]] and has appeared on the show since its [[Dallas (1978 TV series) (season 1)|pilot episode]], first broadcast on April 2, 1978. ''Dallas'' follows the trials of the wealthy [[Ewing family (television)|Ewing family]] in the city of [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]], into which Sue Ellen married when she wed [[J. R. Ewing|J.R. Ewing]]. Gray played Sue Ellen until the twelfth season of ''Dallas'', when her character finally leaves Texas after beating J.R. at his own game, seen in the episode "[[Dallas (1978 TV series) (season 12)|Reel Life]]".  However, Gray later returned for the series finale "[[Conundrum (Dallas)|Conundrum]]", the subsequent ''Dallas'' telemovies (''[[Dallas: J.R. Returns|J.R. Returns]]'' in 1996 and ''[[Dallas: War of the Ewings|War of the Ewings]]'' in 1998), and the 2004 reunion special entitled ''[[Dallas Reunion: The Return to Southfork]]'', which reunited her with former castmates.&lt;ref name= "Return to Southfork"&gt;{{cite web|title= CBS Special: Return to Southfork|work= Ultimate Dallas.com |publisher= [[CBS]]|date=2004-11-07|url= http://www.ultimatedallas.com/returntosouthfork/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sue Ellen's storylines in the [[Dallas (1978 TV series) (season 2)|season 2]] focus on the character's bout with [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and her slowly deteriorating relationship with her husband. The final episode of the season focused on the birth of her son with J.R., [[John Ross Ewing III]]. While her relationship with J.R. is not always harmonious, it's a significant aspect of her overall character. As the series progressed, Sue Ellen came into her own as an individual character. The actress has said of her character's personality: "I never wanted her to be boring. She was never boring before – she started out kind of boring, but I think that's the kiss of death because people will expect her to be interesting." Gray later described Sue Ellen as being, "one of the most interesting characters on TV in the 1980s. She was the original ''[[Desperate Housewife]]''. She led the way for all those girls."&lt;ref name = "Mirror"/&gt;

For her work as Sue Ellen, Gray was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] in the category "Best Actress in a Drama Series" in 1981 ([[Barbara Bel Geddes]] who played [[Miss Ellie Ewing]] was also nominated in that category for ''Dallas'' that year).&lt;ref name = "Linda Gray.com"/&gt; Gray was also nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] in both 1980 and 1981 in the category of "Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series – Drama" respectively.&lt;ref name = "Linda Gray A&amp;N"/&gt; In 2010, [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] (sister company to [[Warner Bros. Television]], the current copyright owners of the series) announced they were producing a new, [[Dallas (2012 TV series)|updated ''Dallas'' series]].&lt;ref name="People.com"/&gt; It is a continuation of the original series and primarily centers around Sue Ellen and J.R.'s son [[John Ross Ewing III]], and Bobby and [[Pamela Barnes|Pamela]]'s son [[Christopher Ewing]], though various stars of the original series will be reprising their roles.&lt;ref name="People.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Will You Watch the New Dallas Reboot? | url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20463058,00.html |work= [[People (magazine)|People]]|publisher= [[Time Warner]] |date=2011-02-02|accessdate=2011-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray agreed to return to the new series and once again assumed the role of Sue Ellen.&lt;ref name="AH"&gt;{{cite web |title=Linda Gray Saddles Up For ‘Dallas’ Return |url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/linda-gray-saddles-up-for-dallas-return-jesse-metcalfe-joins-cast-as-bobbys-son_article_43620|publisher=[[Access Hollywood]].com | date=2011-02-02 | accessdate=2011-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character portrayal and development==

===Casting and creation===
When Gray originally tested for ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', the role of Sue Ellen was merely that of a background character. The actress recounts that the part was a "mere walk-on" and there hadn't been any need for a formal audition.&lt;ref name = "UD"&gt;{{cite news|title= Give Her the Simple Life |work = The Staff of [[TV Guide]]|publisher= [[TV Guide (Canada)]]|date=1979-11-24 | location=Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Gray had to do an impromptu audition over the telephone because the role was not considered important enough to bring in another actor to test for the part,&lt;ref name = "UD"/&gt; though the actress later stated that ''[[Newhart]]'' innkeeper [[Mary Frann]] was also considered to play the character while the producers were casting the show.&lt;ref name = "Gray TV G"&gt;{{cite news|title= Bottoms Up, Linda Gray!|work = Ileane Rudolph and Ben Katner|publisher= [[TV Guide]]|date=2004-11-05|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/dallas-gray-linda-37924.aspx|accessdate=2010-08-31 | location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''TV Guide'', Gray confirmed: "She [Frann] had the part. [[Victoria Principal]] was a brunette, and so was I, and Mary was a blonde, and [the producers] wanted that [visual] contrast. But the casting director [who had only recently tapped me to play a [[transsexual]] on ''[[All That Glitters (TV series)|All That Glitters]]''] kept bugging them until they finally said, 'OK, we'll read her.'"&lt;ref name = "Gray TV G"/&gt; Once the show was picked up for a full season, Gray and fellow actor [[Steve Kanaly]] ([[Ray Krebbs]]) were both upgraded to starring roles.&lt;ref name="Dallas: The Complete Story"&gt;''Dallas: The Complete Story of the World's Favorite Prime-Time Soap'', pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

After staying with the show for eight seasons, Gray ran into trouble when she requested the producers of the show to adjust her contract to allow her to direct, as did the contracts of male co-stars Duffy and Hagman. The request initially led to producers firing the actress from the serial, though the decision was later reversed when ''Dallas'' star [[Larry Hagman]] threatened to quit the show unless Gray were rehired.&lt;ref name = "Gray TV G"/&gt; Gray stated in an interview with ''[[TV Guide]]'', "The producers said, 'But you're doing so well.' I thought, 'Oh, look out! I'm on the warpath now.' It was a struggle, though, because it was a man's show. And they fired me. When I finally told Larry, he went with me into the office and said, 'If she doesn't come back, I don't come back. I can't be playing J.R. Ewing without Sue Ellen.' He was very loyal and, honestly, a very smart businessman. He knew that truly, it was a huge relationship to the show." We'll drink to that!"&lt;ref name = "Gray TV G"/&gt;

The actress also recounted the story to Alan Mercer of ''Dazzling Diva.com'', saying: "I told them I don't want any more money. I just want to direct one episode in the next two year cycle. I didn't think that was so horrible. I didn't want to direct six episodes. They still said no. Basically, I was fired at the end of year eight. So, I said good-bye, and Larry said 'see you next season.' I told him I won't be coming back. He said, "What!?!" I told him, "They fired me because I want to direct one episode, and if that's their stance, I'm out of here." He was stunned and he said if you go I go. He denies that to this day. He really went to bat for me."&lt;ref name = "Gray DD"&gt;{{cite web|title= Linda Gray can do it all!|work = Alan Mercer|publisher= Dazzling Divas.com|date=2011-04-24|url=http://dazzlingdivas-ladivas.blogspot.com/2011/04/linda-gray-can-do-it-all-interview-alan.html|accessdate=2010-08-31 |location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray remained a member of the principal cast until she left the show in its [[Dallas (1978 TV series) (season 12)|12th season]].&lt;ref name= "Gray Leaving"&gt;{{cite web|title= Sue Ellen Leaving Southfork|work= [[The Milwaukee Journal]]|publisher= [[Journal Communications]]|date=1989-02-22 |location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her departure came as a surprise, but her publicist said that after eleven years on the show, she wished to pursue other things.&lt;ref name= "Gray Leaving"/&gt;

In 2010, [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] (sister company to [[Warner Bros. Television]], the current copyright owners of the series) announced they were producing a [[Dallas (2012 TV series)|continuation of ''Dallas'']]. The new series primarily centered around Sue Ellen and J.R.'s son [[John Ross Ewing III]], and [[Bobby Ewing]]'s adopted son [[Christopher Ewing]], though various stars of the original series reprised their roles.&lt;ref name="People.com"/&gt; Gray agreed to return to the new series, once again to play Sue Ellen.&lt;ref name="AH"/&gt;

===Characterization===
[[Image:SueEllenEwing.JPG|thumb|left|175px|Linda Gray as Sue Ellen in the fifth season of the series.]]
In 1979, Gray spoke with ''[[TV Guide (Canada)]]'' and recounted: "At first, they had no idea what to do with the part. Sue Ellen's lines ran to 'More coffee, darling?' and 'I have a headache.' [[Victoria Principal]] and [[Patrick Duffy]] were the goody-goodies. [[Jim Davis (actor)|Jim Davis]] and [[Barbara Bel Geddes]] were parental. [[Larry Hagman|Hagman]] was the villain. And I was the redhead on the couch."&lt;ref name = "UD"/&gt; However, Gray was upgraded to a starring role once ''Dallas'' was picked up for a full season following the [[List of Dallas episodes#Mini-Series (April 1978)|five episode arc miniseries]]. The actress later stated that on-screen husband Larry Hagman had criticized one of her performances early on during the start of the series, and called it "terrible", though he denied it. She joked, "I'm sorry. He said it to me loud and clear, and made me feel terrible, and it started one of our first fights on the way back [to the motel where everyone was staying]. I swear to you—he devastated me. Then, years later, he said, 'Oh, I didn't mean that.' I could have killed him!"&lt;ref name = "Gray TV G"/&gt;

Throughout the serial, Sue Ellen often suffered emotional abuse from her husband J.R., who was the primary antagonist of the show.&lt;ref name = "First Housewife"&gt;{{cite news|title= Gray: I was the very first desperate housewife |publisher= Daily Telegraph|date=2006-07-10|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3653731/I-was-the-very-first-desperate-housewife.html|accessdate=2010-08-31|location=London |first=Jan | last=Moir}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linda Gray described Sue Ellen as being, "one of the most interesting characters on TV in the 1980s. She was the original ''[[Desperate Housewife]]''. She led the way for all those girls."&lt;ref name = "Mirror"&gt;{{cite news|title= Linda Gray on the Return of ''Dallas'' |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/tv-film-news/linda-gray-on-the-return-of-dallas-and-her-best-84922 |work = The Staff of [[Mirror]].com|publisher= [[Mirror]]|date=2011-10-12|accessdate=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also added, "The more successful we became, the more glamorous and fashionable the clothes became. We set fashion trends in the 80s. Those shoulder pads did get a bit wild. They had to make doors bigger in the end."&lt;ref name = "Mirror"/&gt; In an interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', she said: "It was kind of exciting. I played this neurotic, psychotic, alcoholic weirdo. But I still say she was the most interesting female on television in the eighties."&lt;ref name = "First Housewife"/&gt; The character of Sue Ellen has gone through an addiction to alcohol, which she returned to every time something went extremely wrong with her life. Gray was particularly fond of doing these scenes. She commented,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I loved my drunk scenes. I know that may sound very strange to people! I got to just let go and just do a down and dirty version of Sue Ellen. It was like, 'Just let me at it and roll those cameras'. I remember being in makeup for 20 minutes, which normally took two hours. They put some kind of gel in my hair and some very light makeup and I loved it. I said, "Just let me go, please don't edit me, just let me go.'" She added, "It was just one of those charming, charming, charming times where I just got to blow it out. I just wanted Sue Ellen to be raw unlike any other time in her life, where she was the victim and she was this and she was that; [[J.R. Ewing]] would do something and she would react, he would do something and she would have an affair or drink or whatever. This was just like, 'Let me go. Let Sue Ellen out of that box'&lt;ref name= "I liked Drunk Scenes"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Digital Spy]]'', Gray said of her character's persona: &lt;blockquote&gt;I never wanted her to be boring. She was never boring before–she started out kind of boring, but I think that's the kiss of death because people will expect her to be interesting. By interesting, that doesn't mean she's drunk. I had to do a lot of thinking about what we would do with her. Where would she be now? I did a lot of homework finding out where she would be and what Texas women are like now. What has she gone through in her life? What has she come to grips with? What does she like about herself? What doesn't she like about herself? What kind of impact is she going to make on her life, on [[John Ross Ewing III|John Ross]]'s life, on her future? Who is she?&lt;ref name= "I liked Drunk Scenes"&gt;{{cite web|title= 'Dallas' Linda Gray interview: 'I liked Sue Ellen's drunk scenes'|author= Catriona Weightman|publisher= Digital Spy.com|date=2011-09-29|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/interviews/a342756/dallas-linda-gray-interview-i-liked-sue-ellens-drunk-scenes.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Dallas (2012 TV series)===
Sue Ellen has become a powerful woman in [[Dallas]], leading successful fundraising campaigns and making connections with influential Texans. Her success has led her to run for [[Governor of Texas]], with campaign backers already lining up to support her. But despite this success, Sue Ellen harbors deep regret for her mistakes as a mother raising [[John Ross Ewing III|John Ross]] and will do anything to make things right for him. Upon seeing [[J. R. Ewing|J.R.]] for the first time in years, there is a brief moment of romantic tension and nostalgia. However, Sue Ellen becomes wary of J.R.'s claims of having changed when [[Cliff Barnes]] returns to town. Then when a colleague and occasional lover of John Ross's, Veronica Martinez, is pushed off a balcony and killed, Sue Ellen bribes the medical examiner into ruling the death a suicide and finds herself looking for support from Harris Ryland, Ann's ex-husband. Harris later plans to use Sue Ellen's sure win to his advantage and desiring to run a clean office, Sue Ellen seeks Ann's help who later gets a recording of Harris admitting to his crimes and placing him into a spot of submission.

In the second season, Harris again gains the upper hand when he offers Ann information about their kidnapped daughter in exchange for the tape, Sue Ellen tells Ann to go ahead. However, her secret bribery comes out on the eve of the election and she loses the election and twelve donors towards her foundation. Facing the possibility of jail and the overall humiliation and disgrace, she pours herself a glass of wine (in the original series, her favorite tipple was [[Vodka]]). Yet, before she can drink it J.R. and John Ross arrive, with J.R. vowing to make things right by her and reminding her that she is a strong woman. After they leave she dumps out the wine and instead seeks comfort in Ann. J.R. through means of blackmail is able to get the charges dropped and after thanking him, Sue Ellen invites him in for tea, a spark of their past romance being seemingly reignited. Later she comes to the aid of John Ross and helps him in securing control of the newly established Ewing Energies, by pushing his ex-girlfriend [[Elena Ramos]] out of the company. Despite pleas from Bobby, Ann, and Christopher she does so.

Then when J.R. is murdered, Sue Ellen becomes heart broken and relapses after his memorial service. She reads a letter he wrote to her and spends the night alone in his room. At his funeral, she reads the letter aloud in which J.R. declares his undying love to Sue Ellen and asks her for another chance. Heartbroken, Sue Ellen reveals her own unresolved feelings for J.R. and declares that had he not been murdered she would have happily reunited with him. She then collapses at his casket and says he was the love of her life.

Soon after, Sue Ellen's [[alcoholism]] returns, and her struggles with it become a recurring theme in the third season, putting a strain on her relationship with her son. Eventually she learns the truth about the circumstances surrounding J.R's death, and is angered at both Bobby and Bum that she had been kept in the dark about his illness and his final plan, although she makes amends.

==Reception==
For her work as Sue Ellen, Gray was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] in the category "Best Actress in a Drama Series" in 1981 ([[Barbara Bel Geddes]] who played [[Miss Ellie Ewing]] was also nominated in that category for ''Dallas'' that year).&lt;ref name="Linda Gray.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Linda Gray Official Website: Biography |url=http://www.lindagray.com/biography.html |work=[[Linda Gray]].com |publisher=The Staff of Linda Gray.com |accessdate=March 25, 2012 |location=United States |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415040210/http://www.lindagray.com/biography.html |archivedate=April 15, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray was also nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] in both 1980 and 1981 in the category of "Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Drama" respectively.&lt;ref name = "Linda Gray A&amp;N"&gt;{{cite news|title= Linda Gray- Awards and Nominations|url= http://movies.msn.com/celebrities/celebrity-awards-and-nominations/linda-gray.2/ |work =MSN.com|publisher=[[MSN]]|accessdate=March 25, 2012| location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character of Sue Ellen was well received by television critics. ''[[The Biography Channel]]'' said, "Who could ever forget ''Dallas'' with the gin-swilling Sue Ellen Ewing, replete with shoulder pads long before ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', staggering around [[Southfork Ranch]] with a permanently tearful expression as she suffered the brunt of J.R.

Corruption and betrayal, lies, greed, affairs and scandal – all were just part of another day at the Southfork Ranch. At the center of it all was one of our favorite Ewings, the person we couldn't help but root for each week as she drank and slept her way through one ordeal after another. This, of course, was the tortured and (sometimes) villainous Sue Ellen Shepard Ewing, former Texas beauty queen and trophy wife of the womanizing rogue J.R. Ewing, played to perfection by actress Linda Gray.&lt;ref name="TBM"&gt;{{cite news|title=Linda Gray: An Accomplished Actress with Knockout Star Power |url=http://www.lindagray.com/theboulevardpageone.jpg |author=Ruth Bashinsky |work=[[The Boulevard Magazine]] |date=March 2009 |accessdate=March 25, 2012 |location=United States }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the letters to the [[Seven churches of Asia|early Christian churches]] of [[Smyrna]] and [[Alaşehir|Philadelphia]] in {{bibleverse||Revelation|2:9|NKJV}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Revelation|3:9|NKJV}}, reference is made to a '''synagogue of Satan''' ({{lang-gr|συναγωγή τοῦ Σατανᾶ}}, ''synagoge tou satana''), in each case referring to a group [[Persecution of Christians in the New Testament|persecuting]] the church "who say they are [[Jews]] and are not". In [[Revelation 2]], the Smyrna church is advised not to fear the events they are about to suffer; in [[Revelation 3]], the Philadelphia church is promised that the persecutors will "come and worship before [their] feet, and ... know that I have loved you".

The phrase is also used in a fragment of a [[lost work]] on [[Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria|Dioscorus I of Alexandria]] found at the [[Monastery of Saint Macarius the Great]] in 1923 and identified by American theologian [[William Hatch]].&lt;ref&gt;Hatch, W., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1507736.pdf A Fragment of a Lost Work on Dioscorus], ''Harvard Theological Review'', Vol. 19, No. 4 (Oct., 1926), pp. 377-381&lt;/ref&gt; Hatch believes the term refers to the [[Council of Chalcedon]], which Dioscorus attended in 451 and from which he was deposed and exiled for his [[monophysite]] [[Christology]].

==Storylines==
===2006–2013===
Tanya arrives in [[Albert Square]] after her husband [[Max Branning]]'s ([[Jake Wood]]) car breaks down, not realising in fact Max is visiting his family. She finds out that he has had an affair with [[Gemma Clewes]] ([[Natalie J. Robb]]) but forgives him. To make it up to her, Max buys 10 Turpin Road for Tanya, which she turns into a beauty salon named Booty. Tanya, after much pressure from Max, gives birth to Oscar. Unbeknown to Tanya, Max has started an affair with [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]), who is Max's son [[Bradley Branning]]'s ([[Charlie Clements]]) former girlfriend. When the affair is revealed on Christmas Day on a video recording recorded by Tanya and Max's daughter, [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Madeline Duggan]]/[[Jacqueline Jossa]]), Tanya asks for a divorce and starts a relationship with Stacey's brother [[Sean Slater]] ([[Robert Kazinsky]]). Tanya plots to bury Max alive and with the help of Sean, they drug Max and bury him in the woods. Tanya later feels guilty and digs him up and breaks up with Sean. Tanya then has to face her sister, [[Rainie Cross|Rainie]] ([[Tanya Franks]]), turning up as she did the year before, claiming she is clean of drugs, though tests positive, so Tanya orders her to leave. Tanya then starts a relationship with Max's brother [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]) and Max tries to split them up. Tanya and Max later share a kiss, after Max is abducted and beaten by Jack. Max is knocked down in a deliberate hit-and-run. Tanya admits to the police that she tried to kill Max; however, Lauren was the real culprit. After the police find out Lauren was the driver, Max and Tanya suffer a bumpy relationship which ends up in Tanya forgiving Max and allowing him to move back in, but when she finds out they are in debt and Max has been hiding it, she leaves with Lauren and Oscar after finding out Booty was to close down, with daughter [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) refusing to go with Tanya and staying with Max.

Tanya returns to Walford with her new fiancé [[Greg Jessop]] ([[Stefan Booth]]). Tanya's mother, [[Cora Cross]] ([[Ann Mitchell]]), and Rainie arrive in Walford for her wedding, much to Tanya's dismay. Greg and Tanya marry, and Tanya soon starts an affair with Max. Greg later buys the beauty salon from [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]) and later pushes Tanya to have another baby though Tanya is against the idea. Tanya allows Rainie and Cora to move in. Tanya and Max plan to reveal their affair but Tanya finds out that she may have [[cervical cancer]]. After discovering this, she breaks up with Max, but he decides to tell the truth to his fiancé, [[Vanessa Gold]] ([[Zöe Lucker]]) who reveals all to Greg. Heartbroken, Greg leaves Walford and when Max realises Tanya does not want to be with him either, he leaves too. Tanya is diagnosed with cervical cancer and tells only Lauren and forbids her from telling anyone else. Greg briefly returns but cannot handle the news that Tanya has cancer and quickly leaves again. Tanya then decides to stop her therapy, although does not tell Lauren about this. Later, Tanya agrees to allow Cora to move back in, after she has been thrown out by [[Dot Cotton|Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]). Tanya's doctor, [[Yusef Khan]] ([[Ace Bhatti]]), later confronts Tanya and asks why she has stopped her treatment. Tanya goes to the hospital where she tells her doctor that wants no more treatment as she does not have the strength to fight, despite the fact she could die.

Max returns to Walford with his brother [[Derek Branning]] ([[Jamie Foreman]]). Max insults Tanya, and Tanya throws him out. As Tanya starts to throw her mother and sister out, Lauren reveals that Tanya has cancer and confronts her about stopping her therapy. Tanya then tells Cora and Rainie the truth about how her father died—he did not die peacefully as they believed, but was in constant pain and so Tanya helped him to die. Max then reconciles with Tanya and they become a couple again. She learns that she has been given the all-clear from cancer but is worried that it might return. She finds it difficult to be close to Max, but after a frank discussion over their marriage and sex life, Max reassures Tanya that she is all that matters to him. When Derek discovers that Tanya scared his daughter [[Alice Branning]] ([[Jasmyn Banks]]) away, he threatens to kill Tanya if she does it again. When Tanya discovers that cars at the car lot are being repossessed, she and Max argue, which leads to passion and they have sex for the first time since Tanya's all-clear from cancer. Tanya announces that her divorce from Greg will soon be finalised and proposes to Max. Lauren tells Tanya that Derek stole from [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]) and she confronts him about it. Derek in response taunts Tanya about what he and Max did in [[Manchester]]. She confronts Max, who says he was involved in criminal dealings causing someone to get hurt. He then accepts her proposal from earlier and they get engaged.

Tanya discovers a birth certificate for a sister called [[Ava Hartman|Ava Anderton]] ([[Clare Perkins]]). She confronts Cora, who refuses to talk about it, but eventually tells Tanya that Ava died not long after her birth and it hurt so much she never told anyone, not even the father. Tanya then tells Cora that she can talk to her any time. When [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) goes missing, Tanya helps to bring him back to Walford, which makes her decide she wants Rainie at her wedding, but Cora lies to her that Rainie does not want to attend, when in fact Rainie does not want to see Cora. Patrick tells Tanya the truth about Ava—that she is alive and Cora gave her up for adoption, so Tanya secretly tracks down Ava to her place of work, a school in [[Dalston]]. Tanya is shocked that Ava is mixed-race, and decides not to see her again. Tanya leaves her purse behind and Ava returns in, meeting Cora. Cora is shocked when Ava says her name, and is angry at Tanya, disowning her. Lauren is involved in a car crash and tells Tanya that she is in love with her cousin, [[Joey Branning]] ([[David Witts]]). Derek blackmails Tanya to keep Lauren and Joey's relationship secret from the rest of the family, and Joey is forced by Derek to end his relationship with Lauren. On Christmas Day, Tanya is stunned when Max's secret wife [[Kirsty Branning]] ([[Kierston Wareing]]) arrives moments before she is due to remarry Max. Max insists he thought they were divorced (Derek had lied to him) and Tanya and Max continue their relationship, but when Tanya finds Kirsty's keys in Max's pocket (given to Lauren by Kirsty), Tanya assumes Kirsty and Max are still involved. She tells Kirsty to sign divorce papers, but Kirsty refuses. Lauren also discovers that Tanya has not attended a hospital appointment, when Tanya said she was given the all-clear from cancer. Kirsty agrees to the divorce, realising she is hurting Max, and Max shows Tanya saying Kirsty is leaving. Tanya realises Max still loves Kirsty because he refuses to have sex with her and is sad about Kirsty leaving. Max confirms this so Tanya ejects Max from the house saying their relationship is over for good, and she celebrates the break-up. She does not cope though, and is nearly drawn back to Max. She decides that to resist temptation she must leave Walford, and Max is deeply disappointed.

She returns a few weeks later to find Max, Kirsty, Abi and Lauren having a meal together and laughing. Lauren continues to drink but Tanya refuses to believe she is addicted until she keeps Lauren in the house and she reveals that she has been sipping vodka from a water bottle. Tanya locks Lauren in the house but she escapes through the upstairs window. Later, Lauren gets drunk on a night out and leaves with a stranger; she does not return the next morning. Eventually, when she does come back, her skin and eyes are yellow and she collapses in pain. She is taken to hospital where Tanya and Max are told she is an alcoholic, has [[alcoholic hepatitis]], and one more drink could kill her. The doctor suggests that the best treatment for Lauren is residential care. Later, Lauren tells her family that she cannot stand her parents' constant arguing, so Tanya decides to take Lauren, Abi and Oscar to Exeter, where Lauren can get help for her alcoholism. Abi refuses to leave so Tanya leaves Walford with Lauren and Oscar in a taxi, after telling a heartbroken Max she will always love him. Lauren soon returns to Albert Square, but Tanya and Oscar remain in Exeter. In January 2014, Tanya's friend, [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]), reveals to Max that Tanya is now in a relationship, with a man named Tim and that they are planning on getting engaged.

===2015===
In February 2015, Tanya returns to Walford, to attend Ian and Jane's wedding and after the reception, she agrees to sit and have a conversation with Max. During the conversation, she reveals that she is taking part in a fashion course in Manchester and asks Max if Oscar can move in with him for a while, as he would be stuck with a nanny most of the time if he went with her, due to Tanya's commitment to the course. Before leaving, Tanya admits that she was thinking of rebuilding her relationship with Max, but Jane assures her that that would have been one of the biggest mistakes of her life. Max is falsely accused of the murder of Lucy in July 2015 and after he is arrested, Oscar is sent back to live with Tanya, who denies Max any contact with his son although Max is later released after [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]] (Eliot Carrington) confesses to the crime.

===2017–2018===
Tanya agrees to let Max see Oscar for his birthday but Cora turns up instead and tells Max that she has told Tanya all about his work with Weyland and that she is not allowing Max to see Oscar. Tanya returns on Christmas Day to take Lauren and Abi away from Walford, informing Ian and his mother, [[Kathy Beale]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]), that Lauren is moving to Glasgow with her boyfriend, [[Josh Hemmings]] ([[Eddie Eyre]]). Tanya goes to collect Abi and confronts Max over his recent behaviour and is disgusted that Max and Stacey have resumed their affair. When Stacey defends Max, Tanya tells Stacey that Jane has told her that he killed [[Steven Beale]] ([[Aaron Sidwell]]) and tried to kill Jane. Abi overhears this and tells Lauren. As they prepare to leave, they see Max on the roof of The Queen Vic and Lauren and Abi attempt to talk him down. Max agrees to come down but Lauren and Abi slip and fall off the roof. Tanya accompanies them to the hospital, where Lauren undergoes surgery whilst Abi has a CT scan. Tanya initially accepts Max's comfort but then pushes him away. They are then told that Abi has suffered critical brain damage and remains in a coma. Tanya is devastated and leaves the hospital in tears. A few days later, she plans to visit Lauren and Abi with Cora, but Cora comes alone and slaps Max, blaming him for his daughters' injuries. She later learns that Abi is brain-dead and that she will never recover. Tanya avoids being around Max in the hospital and when Abi's life support is due to be withdrawn, Max asks if it can be withdrawn at Abi's time of birth. Cora tells Max that Tanya does not want him present. Max finds Tanya in the hospital's chapel, who is angry with Max that Abi has to die because of him, and agrees to stay away. At the last minute, however, Tanya requests Max to be there when the life support is withdrawn. Before Abi's funeral, Tanya's friends talk about her being unable to attend the funeral as she has had a nervous breakdown. Lauren lies to Max that the funeral has already taken place, but later admits that Tanya does not want him there. On the day of the funeral, Cora yells at Max, urging him to stay away as he has done enough damage to his family, and mentions that she had to sedate a grief-stricken Tanya to get her into the car to go to the funeral. Tanya arrives at the church with Cora, but is unable to get out and tells Lauren that she feels like she has failed as a mother. Lauren reassures Tanya it is fine for her to miss the service as Abi loved her and at the end; Tanya says goodbye to Lauren. Months later, it emerged from Cora that Tanya had to be committed to a psychiatric hospital because of the increasing trauma of losing Abi.

===Casting===
In early reports of the character's arrival, her name was spelt ''Tania''.

In an interview with ''[[Digital Spy]]'', Joyner admitted that she prefers playing a "feisty" character and would like to explore that side of Tanya. Joyner confirmed that she wants sparks to fly between her character and estranged husband Max. She added: "I hope it comes out. I think she's been a little bit calm and a little bit mumsy lately and I think if she's been away from Max for a while, she needs to come back with a bit more fight about her and have him on his knees a bit." Of her experiences as a mother, she added: "It's fantastic. It's full on but it's just been a whirlwind. I've just been so lucky."&lt;ref name=Interview /&gt;

==Development==
On 21 March 2008, Joyner revealed a script in which Tanya would bury Max alive. Speaking of when she first heard about the burial idea, the actress admitted: "I actually was really upset! I heard about the theory and I thought 'how are you going to get me there? She's not a killer!" "I did always say to Diederick [Santer] when this happened that as far as I was concerned, the only way she can kill Max is when she finds out on Christmas Eve in a blind fit of rage – that's the only time when she could be a murderer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Kris|title=Walford's Jo Joyner reveals burial script shock|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a92072/walfords-jo-joyner-reveals-burial-script-shock.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=17 July 2011|date=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, it was announced that filming had started on location for Greg and Tanya's wedding in April 2011.

Jo Joyner said that she will make sure that the storyline will be "honest and true to life" as possible.&lt;ref name=Responsibility&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders' cancer plot is a responsibility, says Jo Joyner|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a332946/eastenders-cancer-plot-is-a-responsibility-says-jo-joyner.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=London: [[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=8 January 2012|date=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talking to ''[[All About Soap]]'' about how she has researched the plot, Joyner said that she has talked to many survivors of cervical cancer through a charity named Jo's Trust and added that they have a great website, which is very informative and has helped her a lot. Joyner said that it is a privilege to be given any sort of serious storyline and a real responsibility.&lt;ref name=Responsibility /&gt; Asked whether it makes Tanya think twice who she wants to be with, Joyner replied: "Definitely.

Music said that Joyner was "fantastic" when visiting the charity. He added that she was "really hungry to learn, to understand what the impact was, and she felt a responsibility to get this right"&lt;ref name="EastEnders Praised" /&gt; Joyner stated that she "feels grateful" to be in a cervical cancer storyline. She told ''Soaplife'' magazine: "It's a privilege to be given any sort of serious storyline and a real responsibility. I'm going to make it as honest and true to life as I possibly can. I will grab every chance I can to show Tanya dropping her guard." Speaking of her past, she added:"Tanya remembers her mum looking at her dad with pity and she'd hate that happening to her. Tanya's dad died of cancer and she nursed him through it.

But I've had my extensions out and the false lashes are coming off.

My husband doesn't agree. He thinks I carry it all more than I think I do.

I have been very fortunate to have been part of some fantastic storylines over the years, and I have worked with some wonderful people during my time on the show which I will always be very grateful for, but I feel that as a mother and an actress it is time for me to explore some other avenues for a while."

'''''The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker's Hill, June 17, 1775''''' refers to several [[oil painting|oil paintings]] completed in the early 19th century by the American artist [[John Trumbull]] depicting the death of [[Joseph Warren]] at the June 17, 1775 [[Battle of Bunker Hill]], during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  Warren, an influential [[Massachusetts]] physician and politician, had been commissioned as a general but he served in the battle as a volunteer private.  He was killed during or shortly after the storming of the [[redoubt]] atop [[Breed's Hill]] by [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] troops.  

The paintings are iconic images of the American Revolution. Trumbull painted several versions, including the one held by the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] (dated between 1815 and 1831). This was commissioned by the Warren family and passed down through the family before being acquired by the museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/the-death-of-general-warren-at-the-battle-of-bunker-s-hill-17-june-1775-34260], ''[[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Another, larger version (dated 1834) is held by the [[Wadsworth Atheneum]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pubhist.com/w13399]&lt;/ref&gt;  Trumbull sold the engraving rights for both this painting and ''[[The Death of General Montgomery in the Attack on Quebec, December 31, 1775]],'' which resulted in a highly successful subscription release that greatly enhanced his career.

==Event==
Artist [[John Trumbull]] (1756&amp;ndash;1843) was in the colonial army camp at [[Roxbury, Massachusetts]] on June 17, 1775, the day of the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]].  He watched the battle unfold through field glasses, and later decided to depict one of its central events.&lt;ref name=T137&gt;Tamarkin, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joseph Warren]], a [[Massachusetts]] politician and member of the colony's [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]], volunteered to serve under Colonel [[William Prescott]] in the defense of the [[redoubt]] which the colonists had constructed on top of [[Breed's Hill]].  This redoubt was the target of three British attacks, of which the first two were repulsed.  The third attack succeeded, in part because the defenders had run out of ammunition.  Warren was struck by a musket or pistol ball during the evacuation of the redoubt, and killed instantly.

==Description==
[[File:Self Portrait by John Trumbull circa 1802.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Self-portrait of Trumbull]]
The central focus of the painting is Warren's body, dressed in white, and [[John Small (British Army officer)|John Small]], a British major, dressed in a scarlet uniform (holding a sword in his left hand).&lt;ref name="Key to the Battle of Bunker's Hill"&gt;{{cite web|title=Key to the Battle of Bunker's Hill|url=http://www.americanrevolution.org/bunkey.html|publisher=americanrevolution.org|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small, who had served with colonial general [[Israel Putnam]] during the [[French and Indian War]], is shown preventing a fellow British soldier from bayoneting Warren. Trumbull wanted to express the poignancy in the conflict of men who had earlier served together.

On the far right of the painting is a colonial officer, [[Thomas Grosvenor (American Revolution)|Thomas Grosvenor]], with a black man holding a [[musket]] behind him.  The black man was long thought to be [[Peter Salem]], a freed slave who served in the cause of American independence. Later research identified him as a slave belonging to Grosvenor.&lt;ref name=T137/&gt;

The foreground is littered with bodies from both sides of the conflict, and the background includes clusters of colonial and British troops carrying flags. [[Boston Harbor]] is also visible in the distance. The sky is partially obscured by smoke rising from [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]], which had been torched by the British.

In describing the painting for a catalogue of his works, Trumbull explained why he chose to emphasize the British Major Small's role, saying that Small, whom he had met in London, "was equally distinguished by acts of humanity and kindness to his enemies, as by bravery and fidelity to the cause he served."&lt;ref&gt;Tamarkin, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Ominous Parallels: The End of Freedom in America''''' is a 1982 book by philosopher [[Leonard Peikoff]], in which the author compares the culture of the [[United States]] with the culture of [[Germany]] leading up to the Nazis. The book has an introduction by [[Ayn Rand]], who describes it as "the first book by an Objectivist philosopher other than myself". Rand credited Peikoff with identifying "the cause of [[Nazism]]—and the ominous parallels between the intellectual history of Germany and of the United States".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ran82|Rand 1982. pp. vii–viii.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing history==
The hardcover first edition was published by [[Stein and Day]] in 1982. A paperback edition was published by [[New American Library]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Perinn|1990|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, parts of ''The Ominous Parallels'' were republished in a new work by Peikoff, ''The Cause of Hitler's Germany''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pei13|Peikoff 2013]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
German expatriate [[Hiltgunt Zassenhaus]] gave the book a positive review, saying it showed the importance of working to build a free society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zassenhaus|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' profile of Peikoff, Rogers Worthington called it "a fascinating weave of German history, philosophic determinism, and Objectivist polemic".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Worthington|1982|p=3.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer for ''[[The Indianapolis Star]]'' found Peikoff's description of the parallels interesting, but was disappointed that his proposed remedy was Rand's [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cole|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Time Reborn: From the Crisis in Physics to the Future of the Universe''''' is the fourth non-fiction book by the American [[theoretical physicist]] [[Lee Smolin]].

Smolin argues for what he calls a revolutionary view that time is real, in contrast to existing scientific orthodoxy which holds that time is merely a "stubbornly persistent illusion" ([[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s words).&lt;ref name=Guardian20130606/&gt;  Smolin hypothesizes that the very laws of physics are not fixed, but that they actually evolve over time.&lt;ref name=RSA201305/&gt;

==Content and concepts==
''Time Reborn'' is divided into two parts: Part I describes established physics and its history from the time of [[Plato]] and the main established ideas, [[Newtonian physics]] (and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]' philosophical views that countered Newton's e.g. on background dependent physics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.einstein-online.info/spotlights/background_independence |title= Actors on a changing stage: quantum gravity and background independence |first=Lee |last=Smolin |work=Einstein online |quote=Newton's view of the universe is manifestly background dependent [..] But even in Newton's day, there were philosophers like Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz who took a different stance. In modern parlance, theirs is a relationist point of view. For a relationist, there is no background of absolute space and time. |accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his religious justification), [[Einstein]]'s [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity|general]] relativity, and [[quantum mechanics]]. Part II describes Smolin's views (his "future" for physics, relying on his and ideas of others) on why these all are slightly wrong, that is, the need to reestablish time as fundamental (and probably space as non-fundamental, rather than vice versa, that was Einstein's view) through e.g. one idea, [[shape dynamics]], a [[duality (mathematics)|duality]] of Einstein's general relativity, that does that.

Smolin argues for what he calls a revolutionary view that time is real, in contrast to existing scientific orthodoxy which holds that time is merely a "stubbornly persistent illusion" ([[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s words).&lt;ref name=Guardian20130606&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/06/time-reborn-lee-smolin-review |title=Time Reborn by Lee Smolin – review |last=Monk |first=Ray |date=June 6, 2013 |website=The Guardian |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ISAdFSGz |archivedate=July 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smolin reasons that physicists have improperly rejected the reality of time because they confuse their mathematical models—which are timeless but deal in abstractions that do not exist—with reality.&lt;ref name=Guardian20130606/&gt; Smolin hypothesizes instead that the very laws of physics are not fixed, but that they actually evolve over time.&lt;ref name=RSA201305&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thersa.org/events/audio-and-past-events/2013/time-reborn-a-new-theory-of-time-a-new-view-of-the-world |title=Time Reborn: a new theory of time - a new view of the world |date=May 21, 2013 |publisher=[[Royal Society of Arts]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ISCfPWPu |archivedate=July 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smolin asserts that overturning the existing orthodoxy is the best hope for finding solutions to contemporary physics problems, such as bringing gravity into line with the rest of the currently accepted models,&lt;ref name=Guardian20130606/&gt; the nature of the quantum world and its unification with spacetime and cosmology.&lt;ref name=RSA201305/&gt;  Outside science, Smolin asserts his views have important implications for [[Agency (philosophy)|human agency]], and on how our social, political, economic and environmental decisions affect our future,&lt;ref name=RSA201305/&gt; Smolin saying that contrary to deterministic philosophies derived from conventional physics, humans do have the power to exert control over climate change, our economic system and our technology.&lt;ref name=InstEthicsEmergTech20130715&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/searle20130715 |title= Time Lost: Scene 1 |last=Searle |first=Rick |date=July 15, 2013 |publisher=Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IkJkHvpw |archivedate=August 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{cquote|
Through his brilliant writing [in ''[[The Trouble with Physics]]''] and articulate arguments, readers
took him seriously. One string theorist
told me that he struggled to convince nonphysicists
that he wasn’t a charlatan after the
publication of Smolin’s book.
Now, in ''Time Reborn'', Smolin attempts
to chip away at basic theories of modern
physics. He makes the case that
by doing away with time, existing
theories are missing a trick
[...]
According to Smolin,
our picture of a timeless
Universe stems from the
assumption that all modern
physics — quantum as well as
classical — is predictive. How a
system evolves is entirely encoded
in the starting set of ‘[[initial condition]]s’
and their transformation according
to the laws of physics. Evolution in time is
secondary, a by-product of the theory. This
bothers Smolin. A timeless view of reality
is, he says repeatedly, incomplete (where do
the initial conditions or laws come from?)
and, simply, “wrong”. He believes that a
better description of time lies at the heart
of some of the big questions, such as the
marriage of [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]] and [[general relativity]].

Smolin sketches an alternative path for
modern physics. Inspired by the ideas of
Brazilian philosopher and political theorist,
[[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]], who argues
that social structures emerge without an
underlying natural order or guiding principle,
Smolin develops some of the ideas
behind his first book, ''[[The Life of the Cosmos]].''|author=Pedro Ferreira, professor of [[astrophysics]] at the University of Oxford, UK |source=review of the book in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'' journal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://timereborn.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Nature-review-of-TR-4-24-13.pdf |title=Clockwork cosmos: Pedro Ferreira ponders a vision of the Universe in which time is paramount. |work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |publisher=Macmillan Publishers Limited. |via=Time Reborn website |issue=7446 |pages=430–431 |date=April 25, 2013 |accessdate=August 19, 2015 |doi=10.1038/496430a |volume=496|bibcode = 2013Natur.496..430F }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''[[The New York Times]]''' [[James Gleick]] wrote that Smolin's arguments from science and history were "as provocative, original, and unsettling as any I’ve read in years," contradicting the commonly accepted views of H.G. Wells, Hermann Minkowski, Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton and Plato; Gleick predicted it will ring false to many contemporaries in theoretical physics.&lt;ref name=NYTimes20130606/&gt; Gleick further wrote that Smolin has a "fairly puritanical view of what science should and should not do"—disfavoring [[multiverse]]s or other non-testable concepts or quests for timeless truths, but allowing that science creates “effective theories” even though they are incomplete, of limited domains, and approximate.&lt;ref name=NYTimes20130606&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/jun/06/time-regained/?pagination=false |title=Time Regained! |last=Gleick |first=James |date=June 6, 2013 |website=The New York Times |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ISFjyFBD |archivedate=July 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' described the book, which omits mathematical explanations, as being as much philosophy as science, and as providing "a flood of ideas from an imaginative thinker."&lt;ref name=Kirkus2013&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/lee-smolin/time-reborn/ |title=Time Reborn / Kirkus Reviews  |year=2013 |website=Kirkus Reviews |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ISHiNlhg |archivedate=July 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]], author Rick Searle wrote that ''Time Reborn'' is "just as much a diagnosis of contemporary economic and political ills" as it is a book about physics.&lt;ref name=InstEthicsEmergTech20130715/&gt; Possible economic and political similarities/"implication" (to physics and philosophy discussed in the book) are only mentioned in the [[preface]] and [[epilogue]] of the book.
