Since the late 1980s, [[ExxonMobil]] Corporation, along with its predecessor companies, Mobil Oil Corporation and Mobil Oil Indonesia, hired military units of the Indonesian national army to provide security for their gas extraction and liquefaction project in Aceh, Indonesia{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}. Members of these military units have been '''accused of perpetrating human rights abuses''' against local villagers. Fearing for the lives of its employees after a series of attacks, ExxonMobil shut down its Arun natural gas operations in Aceh in March 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/24/business/exxon-mobil-in-fear-exits-indonesian-gas-fields.html|title=Exxon Mobil, in Fear, Exits Indonesian Gas Fields|date=24 March 2001|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, ExxonMobil sold its Aceh operations to [[Pertamina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/09/14/exxonmobil-sells-aceh-assets-pertamina.html|title=ExxonMobil sells Aceh assets to Pertamina|website=Thejakartapost.com|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company denies these accusations; its primary defense is that the human rights violations which were occurring were not a result of specific intention of the organization and therefore it cannot be held liable.

[[Aceh]] is located on the northern tip of the [[Indonesia]]n island of [[Sumatra]]. The region is rich in natural resources, including oil and natural gas. In 1992, it was reported that Aceh provided 15% of Indonesia's total exports, and the value of the oil and gas fields was estimated in 2003 to generate US$1.2-1.5 billion annually.

== History of the Aceh gas fields ==
In 1968, Mobil began operating the [[Arun gas field]]s, which are owned by the Indonesian state oil company, [[Pertamina]].&lt;ref name="LawsuitSays"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/21/business/lawsuit-says-exxon-aided-rights-abuses-898244.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=Lawsuit Says Exxon Aided Rights Abuses | first=Neela | last=Banerjee | date=2001-06-21 | accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Mobil Oil Indonesia discovered massive reserves of natural gas in north Aceh, which led to the creation of the Lhokesemawe Industrial Zone (ZILS).{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} After Exxon bought Mobil in 1999, the merged company, which is based in [[Irving, Texas]], took over the management of Arun.&lt;ref name="LawsuitSays"/&gt; The gas fields there, until their closing in March, contributed to the Indonesian budget with about $1 billion in revenue annually.&lt;ref name="LawsuitSays"/&gt; Aceh, the home for the natural gas field has been witnessing an armed resistance organized under the banner of the [[Free Aceh Movement]]. From 1989 to 1998, the Indonesian government designated Aceh as a Military Operation Area, with thousands of troops assigned to defeat the armed independence force.

==The litigation==
The [[ILRF|International Labor Rights Fund]] took on the cause of people claiming to be  victims of abuse. In 2001, ILRF filed an ATCA claim in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia on behalf of 11 villagers from Aceh claiming to be victims of human rights abuses by security forces hired by ExxonMobil. The suit alleges that ExxonMobil employed military troops to protect its operations, and aided and abetted human rights violations through financial and other material support to the security forces.&lt;ref name="LawsuitSays"/&gt; In addition, the suit alleges that the security forces are either employees or agents of Exxon Mobil, and thus Exxon Mobil is liable for their actions.

In 2005 a US federal judge ruled that the case could proceed on [[District of Columbia]] state law claims, including wrongful death, theft by coercion and assault and battery, but dismissed claims under the [[Alien Tort Claims Act]] and the [[Torture Victim Protection Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business-humanrights.org/en/exxonmobil-lawsuit-re-aceh#c9311 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310092834/http://business-humanrights.org/en/exxonmobil-lawsuit-re-aceh |archivedate=2016-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 a motion to dismiss filed by ExxonMobil was dismissed, as was an appeal in 2007. In 2008 the US Supreme court, having invited the US Solicitor General to comment, declined to hear an appeal. In 2009 the District Court accepted Exxon's motion to dismiss, based on lack of standing by the plaintiffs' in a US court; this was revered in 2011 by the appeals court.

In 2014, a US federal court decided that the case could proceed; in 2015 that the claims sufficiently "touch and concern" the United States that they may proceed in US court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business-humanrights.org/en/exxonmobil-lawsuit-re-aceh |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310092834/http://business-humanrights.org/en/exxonmobil-lawsuit-re-aceh |archivedate=2016-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leak, which is considered to be one of the largest in [[Military history of the United States|U.S. military history]],&lt;ref name=GuardianLeaks/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2010/07/30/02 |title=From One Transparency Advocate to Another |publisher=Onthemedia.org |date=2010-07-30 |accessdate=2013-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628181904/http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2010/07/30/02 |archivedate=2011-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; revealed information on the deaths of civilians, increased [[Taliban]] attacks, and involvement by [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]] in the [[Taliban insurgency|insurgency]].&lt;ref name=Spiegel1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Afghan war log leak: Around the web |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=26 July 2010 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2010/07/26/f-wikileaks-afghanistan-docs-roundup.html |accessdate=23 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iran-accus" /&gt; WikiLeaks says it does not know the source of the leaked data.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite news |title= WikiLeaks: We don't know source of leaked data |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[Google]] |date=28 July 2010 |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gKu1DQoewmBy2do5ctRqUX5efGBAD9H82DRO0 |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three outlets which had received the documents in advance, ''The New York Times'', ''The Guardian'', and ''Der Spiegel'', have all concluded that they are genuine when compared with independent reports.&lt;ref name=Spiegel1&gt;{{cite news |first1=Matthias |last1=Gebauer |first2=John |last2=Goetz |first3=Hans |last3=Hoyng |first4=Susanne |last4=Koelbl |first5=Marcel |last5=Rosenbach |first6=Gregor Peter |last6=Schmitz |title=Explosive Leaks Provide Image of War from Those Fighting It |newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=25 July 2010 |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,708314,00.html |accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' described the leak as "a six-year archive of classified military documents [that] offers an unvarnished and grim picture of the Afghan war". ''The Guardian'' called the material "one of the biggest leaks in U.S. military history ... a devastating portrait of the failing [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]], revealing how coalition forces have killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents, Taliban attacks have soared and [[NATO]] commanders fear neighbouring Pakistan and Iran are fuelling the insurgency".&lt;ref name=GuardianLeaks /&gt; ''Der Spiegel'' wrote that "the editors in chief of ''Spiegel'', ''The New York Times'' and the ''Guardian'' were 'unanimous in their belief that there is a justified [[public interest]] in the material'."&lt;ref name="Spiegel1" /&gt;

Some time after the first dissemination by WikiLeaks, the U.S. Justice Department considered using the U.S. [[Espionage Act of 1917]] to prevent WikiLeaks from posting the remaining 15,000 secret war documents it claimed to possess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/17/AR2010081705225.html |work=The Washington Post |title=The Justice Department weighs a criminal case against WikiLeaks |date=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.oneindia.in/2010/08/18/us-to-use-espionage-act-against-wikileaks.html |title=US to use Espionage Act against WikiLeaks |publisher=News.oneindia.in |date=2010-08-18 |accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/espionage-act-of-1917 |title=Espionage Act of 1917 |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, ''Guardian'' journalist [[Nick Davies]] and WikiLeaks founder [[Julian Assange]] established that the U.S. Army had built a huge database with six years of sensitive military intelligence material, to which many thousands of U.S. soldiers had access and some of them had been able to download copies, and WikiLeaks had one copy which it proposed to publish online, via a series of uncensorable global servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/aug/02/afghan-war-logs-wikileaks |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=David |last=Leigh |title=Afghan War Logs: what did we learn? |date=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the soldiers were not supposed to have any access as they were not involved in those operations.

WikiLeaks describes itself as "a multi-jurisdictional public service designed to protect whistleblowers, journalists and activists who have sensitive materials to communicate to the public".&lt;ref name="about-wikileaks"&gt;{{cite web|title=WikiLeaks:About |url=https://wikileaks.org/wiki/WikiLeaks:About |publisher=[[WikiLeaks]] |accessdate=29 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730023422/https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks%3AAbout |archivedate=30 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the UK's [[Channel 4]], Assange said that "we have a stated commitment to a particular kind of process and objective, and that commitment is to get censored material out and never to take it down". He contrasted the group with other media outlets by saying that "other journalists try to verify sources. We don't do that, we verify documents. We don't care where it came from." He denied that the group has an inherent bias against the Afghanistan War, saying that "We don't have a view about whether the war should continue or stop&amp;nbsp;– we do have a view that it should be prosecuted as humanely as possible." However, he also said that he believes the leaked information will turn world public opinion to think more negatively of the war.&lt;ref name="tells-all" /&gt;

An Obama administration statement disputed the self-reported status of WikiLeaks, stating that it "is not an objective news outlet but rather an organization that opposes U.S. policy in Afghanistan".&lt;ref name=arabiya&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2010/07/26/114847.html |title=Washington condemns leak of Afghan war files |publisher=[[Al Arabiya]] |date=26 July 2010 |accessdate=26 July 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729135943/http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2010/07/26/114847.html|archivedate=29 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Will Heaven of ''The Daily Telegraph'' has said that WikiLeaks was not politically neutral when it fed its information to the left-leaning newspapers ''The Guardian'', ''The New York Times'', and ''Der Spiegel'' instead of releasing the data openly. He said that the selectivity of the leak "contravene[d] its own mission statement&amp;nbsp;– that [[crowdsourcing]] and open data are paramount".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Will |last=Heaven |title=Wikileaks is a website without an agenda, says Julian Assange.

==Issues raised==

===Allegations of foreign support for the Taliban===

====Pakistan====
According to ''Der Spiegel'', "the documents clearly show that the Pakistani intelligence agency [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (usually known as the ISI) is the most important accomplice the Taliban has outside of Afghanistan".&lt;ref name=Spiegel2&gt;{{cite news |first1=Matthias |last1=Gebauer |first2=John |last2=Goetz |first3=Hans |last3=Hoyng |first4=Susanne |last4=Koelbl |first5=Marcel |last5=Rosenbach |first6=Gregor Peter |last6=Schmitz |title=Explosive Leaks Provide Image of War from Those Fighting It: The Secret Enemy in Pakistan |newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=25 July 2010 |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,708314-5,00.html |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' was especially alarmed by the level of collusion with the Taliban, having concluded that Pakistan "allows representatives of its spy service to meet directly with the Taliban in secret strategy sessions to organize networks of militant groups that fight against American soldiers in Afghanistan, and even hatch plots to assassinate Afghan leaders". ''The Guardian'', however, did not think there was "a convincing smoking gun" for complicity between [[Inter-Services Intelligence|Pakistan intelligence services]] and the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Kimberly |last1=Dozier |title=Leaked tales from the front lines paint dark portrait of Afghanistan  |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=26 July 2010 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/us-condemns-massive-military-leak-exposing-dark-side-of-afghan-war/article1651348/ |accessdate=26 July 2010 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, the leaks discuss an alleged incident in which Pakistan's former ISI spy chief [[Hamid Gul]] met with Afghan insurgents in January 2009, occurring right after alleged Pakistani al-Qaeda figure Osama al-Kini's death by a CIA drone attack. "The meeting attendees were saddened by the news of Zamarai's death and discussed plans to complete Zamarai's last mission by facilitating the movement of a suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive device from Pakistan to Afghanistan through the Khan Pass", leaked reports said. ''The New York Times'' stated that it could not confirm whether or not that the attack ever took place.&lt;ref name=arabiya/&gt;

The initial web article in ''The New York Times'' on the subject, appearing 25 July was written by [[Mark Mazzetti]], [[Jane Perlez]], [[Eric P. Schmitt|Eric Schmitt]], and Andrew Lehren, and titled "Pakistan Spy Service Aids Insurgents, Reports Assert". It was the lead article in the 26 July print edition of the ''Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Mark |last1=Mazzetti |first2=Jane |last2=Perlez |first3=Eric |last3=Schmitt |first4=Andrew W. |last4=Lehren |title=Pakistan Spy Service Aids Insurgents, Reports Assert |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=25 July 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/world/war-logs.html |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article provided a wide range of excerpts from the paper, at some points focusing on coalition successes, and at other times excerpting sections that highlighted coalition failures. Many of the excerpts illustrated American frustration with local involvement, quoting the sources, noting that "glimpses of what appear to be Pakistani skullduggery contrast sharply with the frequently rosy public pronouncements of Pakistan as an ally by American officials".

''The Guardian'' had a very different take. Its Sunday, 25 July 2010 article by [[Declan Walsh (journalist)|Declan Walsh]] states: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;But for all their eye-popping details, the intelligence files, which are mostly collated by junior officers relying on informants and Afghan officials, fail to provide a convincing smoking gun for ISI complicity. Most of the reports are vague, filled with incongruent detail, or crudely fabricated. The same characters – famous Taliban commanders, well-known ISI officials – and scenarios repeatedly pop up. And few of the events predicted in the reports subsequently occurred. A retired senior American officer said ground-level reports were considered to be a mixture of "rumours, bullshit and second-hand information" and were weeded out as they passed up the chain of command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/25/pakistan-isi-accused-taliban-afghanistan |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Declan |last=Walsh |title=Afghanistan war logs: Clandestine aid for Taliban bears Pakistan's fingerprints |date=25 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Obama administration]], in response to the leaks, re-expressed their long-held doubts about links between Pakistan intelligence agents and Afghan insurgents. An anonymous official said to [[Al Arabiya]], "I don't think anyone who follows this issue will find it surprising that there are concerns about ISI and safe havens in Pakistan".&lt;ref name=arabiya /&gt;

====Iran====
Evidence that [[Iran]] provided extensive assistance to the [[Taliban]] was also revealed. Coming from sources such as Afghan spies and paid informants, Iranian involvement in Afghanistan steadily widened from 2004 to today and constituted armaments, money, and physical deployment of anti-NATO militants.&lt;ref name="iran-accus"&gt;{{cite news |first=Simon |last=Tisdall |title=Afghanistan war logs: Iran's covert operations in Afghanistan |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 July 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/25/iran-backing-taliban-alqaida-afghanistan |accessdate=26 July 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[government of Iran]] denies supporting the militants.&lt;ref name="iran-accus" /&gt;

====North Korea====
The documents, wrote journalist [[Jeff Stein (author)|Jeff Stein]] of the ''[[Washington Post]]'', stated that [[Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin|Hezb-e-Islami party]] leader [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] and Amin al-Haq, a financial advisor to [[Osama Bin Laden]], both flew to [[North Korea]] on 19 November 2005, and purchased remote-controlled rockets to be used against American and coalition aircraft. Stein cautioned that he has found no corroborating reports of North Korean involvement in Taliban armaments dealing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeff |last=Stein |authorlink=Jeff Stein (author) |title=Wikileaks documents: N.

===Civilian casualties===
{{further|Civilian casualties of the War in Afghanistan (2001–present)}}
Hundreds of civilians have been wounded or killed by coalition forces in several instances that were not previously revealed.&lt;ref name=GuardianLeaks&gt;{{cite news |first1=Nick |last1=Davies |authorlink1=Nick Davies |first2=David |last2=Leigh |authorlink2=David Leigh (journalist) |title=Afghanistan war logs: Massive leak of secret files exposes truth of occupation |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 July 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/25/afghanistan-war-logs-military-leaks |accessdate=26 July 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianCivilians&gt;{{cite news |first1=David |last1=Leigh |first2=Rob |last2=Evans |title=Afghanistan war logs: Civilians caught in firing line of British troops |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 July 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/25/british-troops-afghan-civilian-shootings?intcmp=239 |accessdate=26 July 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Foley |title=Whistleblower's leaked US files reveal state of Afghan war |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=26 July 2010 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/whistleblowers-leaked-us-files-reveal-state-of-afghan-war-2035547.html |accessdate=26 July 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The press listed several examples of such previously unreported incidents of civilian injuries and deaths.&lt;ref name=GuardianCivillians&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Leigh |title=Afghanistan war logs: Secret CIA paramilitaries' role in civilian deaths |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 July 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/25/afghanistan-civilian-deaths-rules-engagement |accessdate=26 July 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Leigh (journalist)|David Leigh]] of ''The Guardian'' wrote:

In one incident, a U.S. patrol machine-gunned a bus, wounding or killing 15 of its passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Katherine |last1=Faulkner |title=British fury as Wikileaks publishes the 90,000 top secret files that expose the horrific civilian cost of Afghan war |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=26 July 2010 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1297644/Wikileaks-publishes-90-000-documents-Afghan-war.html |accessdate=26 July 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 March 2007, in the [[2007 Shinwar shooting|Shinwar shooting]], [[U.S. Marines]] opened fire on civilians after witnessing a [[suicide bombing]] and supposedly coming under small arms fire. ''The Guardian'' reported their actions: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The marines made a frenzied escape [from the scene of the bombing], opening fire with automatic weapons as they tore down a six-mile stretch of highway, hitting almost anyone in their way&amp;nbsp;– teenage girls in the fields, motorists in their cars, old men as they walked along the road. Nineteen unarmed civilians were killed and 50 wounded.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The military report of the incident (written by the same soldiers involved in it) later failed to make any reference to the deaths and injuries and none of the soldiers involved were charged or disciplined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Declan |last=Walsh |title=Afghanistan war logs: How US marines sanitised record of bloodbath |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 July 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/26/afghanistan-war-logs-us-marines |accessdate=26 July 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 March 2007, CIA paramilitaries fired on a civilian man who was running from them. The man, Shum Khan, was deaf and mute and did not hear their warnings.&lt;ref name=GuardianCivillians/&gt;&lt;ref name=deafmute&gt;{{cite news |title=Afghanistan war logs: "Other government agency" shoots deaf mute |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 July 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan/warlogs/0B4F081B-E448-4722-9E52-EA10DE4E0153 |accessdate=26 July 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, documents detail how U.S. special forces dropped six 2,000&amp;nbsp;lb bombs on a compound where they believed a "high-value individual" was hiding, after "ensuring there were no innocent Afghans in the surrounding area". A senior U.S. commander reported that 150 Taliban had been killed. Locals, however, reported that up to 300 civilians had died.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.dawn.com/2010/07/27/the-isi-america%E2%80%99s-favourite-scapegoat/ |title=The ISI: America's favourite scapegoat |newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date=27 July 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802004823/http://blog.dawn.com/2010/07/27/the-isi-america%E2%80%99s-favourite-scapegoat/# |archivedate=2010-08-02 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 August 2007, [[Nangar Khel incident|Polish troops mortared the village of Nangar Khel]], killing five people – including a woman and her baby – in what ''The Guardian'' described as an apparent revenge attack shortly after experiencing an [[Improvised explosive device|IED]] explosion.&lt;ref name=GuardianCivillians/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Afghanistan war logs: Polish attack on village kills five, wounds several, including pregnant woman at wedding party |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 July 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan/warlogs/5EA14116-2B6B-470C-8DB4-2912DDF197BF |accessdate=26 July 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Guardian'', the logs also detail "how the Taliban have caused growing carnage with a massive escalation of their roadside bombing campaign, which has killed more than 2,000 civilians to date".&lt;ref name=GuardianLeaks /&gt;

===Friendly-fire casualties===
A significant number of documents describe unreported or previously misleading [[friendly fire]] incidents between Afghan police and army forces, coalition forces, and the U.S. military.

A document dating 3 September 2006 suggests that four Canadian soldiers died in the [[Panjwaye District]] of Afghanistan during [[Operation Medusa]], when an American jet dropped a bomb on a building they occupied during the second day of the operation. Seven other Canadian soldiers and one civilian were also reported wounded in the attack.&lt;ref name="cbc-friendly-fire"&gt;{{cite news|title=Military rejects WikiLeaks friendly fire report |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=26 July 2010 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/07/26/wikileak-afghanistan-canada-soldiers.html |accessdate=27 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729015117/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/07/26/wikileak-afghanistan-canada-soldiers.html |archivedate=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the Canadian military reported that the deaths and injuries were caused by a firefight with the Taliban, which it still insists. Michel Drapeau, a former colonel with the Canadian Forces, commented that the document is disturbing, due to it differing from the military's report at the time of the soldiers' deaths, which could make the document incorrect. The Canadian military insists it had not been misleading facts about deaths of Canadian soldiers.&lt;ref name="cbc-friendly-fire" /&gt;&lt;ref name=CTV&gt;{{cite news |title=Leaked file suggests 4 Canadians killed by friendly fire |publisher=[[CTV News]] |date=26 July 2010 |url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/TopStories/20100726/wikileaks-nato-concerns-100726/ |accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Chief of the Defence Staff (Canada)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] [[Rick Hillier]] also rejects the document and maintains the deaths were due to enemy fire,&lt;ref name="CBC Rick"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hillier slams WikiLeaks 'friendly fire' report |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/07/27/hillier-wikileaks-friendly-fire-allegation.html |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=27 July 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728230041/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/07/27/hillier-wikileaks-friendly-fire-allegation.html|archivedate=28 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; as do some of the deceased soldiers' families.&lt;ref name="cbc-friendly-fire" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/TopStories/20100727/soldiers-wikileaks-100727/ |title=WikiLeaks report untrue: father of slain soldier |date=27 July 2010 |accessdate=27 July 2010 |publisher=[[CTV News]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729193026/http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/TopStories/20100727/soldiers-wikileaks-100727/|archivedate=29 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A document from 11 June 2007 details an incident where [[Task Force 373]] engaged in a firefight with what were believed to be insurgents. An airstrike was called in, which killed seven Afghan police officers, and injured four others. [[Nangarhar Province]] governor [[Gul Agha Sherzai]] had labelled the incident a misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan/warlogs/35C17E54-C611-4F39-8C39-553F5927AC96 |title=Afghanistan war logs: US special forces gunship shoots 15 police |work=The Guardian |date=26 July 2010 |accessdate=25 July 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BinLaden&gt;{{cite news |title=Bin Laden among latest Wikileaks Afghan revelations |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-10774419 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=27 July 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728023030/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-10774419|archivedate=28 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than 48 hours after the documents were leaked, the UK's [[Ministry of Defense (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defense]] released a statement&lt;ref name="ukmod-ff"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/MilitaryOperations/SoldierFrom36EngineerRegimentKilledInAfghanistan.htm |title=Soldier from 36 Engineer Regiment killed in Afghanistan |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] |date=27 July 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719194033/http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/MilitaryOperations/SoldierFrom36EngineerRegimentKilledInAfghanistan.htm|archivedate=19 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; announcing a new [[friendly fire]] death in Afghanistan.

===Role of al-Qaeda===
The war logs made clear that [[suicide bombing]], generally carried out by non-Afghan foreign fighters, was increasing and claim that they were nurtured by [[al-Qaeda]] and [[Osama bin Laden]], whose influence was pervasive and possibly growing. A report generated September 2004 stated that terrorists had been assigned by Bin Laden to conduct a suicidal attack against the Afghan president Hamid Karzai, during a press conference or a meeting held. Another report, in September 2008, spoke of coordinated, multinational al-Qaeda attack planning. More suicide bombings allegedly were planned with al-Qaeda's Afghan allies, such as the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin militia led by the notorious warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. Numerous reports linked Bin Laden and al-Qaeda to insurgent activities. In one report, al-Qaeda was claimed to be involved in a plan to manufacture [[chemical weapons]] payloads for [[rocket-propelled grenade]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/26/afghanistan-war-logs-osama-bin-laden |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Simon |last=Tisdall |title=Afghanistan war logs reveal hand of Osama bin Laden |date=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan/warlogs/772DE21C-2219-0B3F-9F29789162135989 |location=London |work=The Guardian |title=Afghanistan war logs: Al-Qaida alleged to be involved in rocket smuggling |date=25 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of special ops greater than previously revealed===
Government accounts of coalition activity were, according to ''The Guardian'', sometimes "misleading".  The British paper cited as an example a press statement that concealed the fact that the real reason for a coalition presence in a particular area was because a group known as [[Task Force 373]] was on a mission to kill or capture [[Abu Laith al-Libi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Davies |title=Afghanistan war logs: Task Force 373&amp;nbsp;– special forces hunting top Taliban |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 July 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/25/task-force-373-secret-afghanistan-taliban |accessdate=26 July 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' reported that the United States had given Afghans credit for missions actually carried out by Special Operations commandos.''The New York Times'' said "over all, the documents do not contradict official accounts of the war. But in some cases the documents show that the American military made misleading public statements".&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |title=Inside the Fog of War: Reports From the Ground in Afghanistan |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=25 July 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/26/world/asia/26warlogs.html |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The records log 144 incidents regarding Task Force 373 and involving Afghan civilian casualties, including 195 deaths.&lt;ref name=BinLaden /&gt;

===Detainment facilities and procedures===

The leak lends hard numbers such as prisoner head counts and prisoner transfer dates to existing journalistic concerns around certain detainment facilities, such as [[Bagram Theater Internment Facility]], and their practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Rose |title=Why Bagram is Guantanamo's evil twin and Britain's dirty secret |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1232665/Why-Bagram-Guantanamos-evil-twin-Britains-dirty-secret.html |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=9 December 2009 |accessdate=28 July 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taliban use of heat-seeking missiles===

Some, including [[Barack Obama]] and [[Hamid Karzai]], raised concerns that the detailed logs had exposed the names of Afghan informants, thereby endangering their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/aug/01/afghan-war-wikileaks-press-comment|title=WikiLeaks' Afghan story raises dilemma over safety of sources – The WikiLeaks log showed the failures of the Afghan war – but the media moved on, overwhelmed by the weight of material|last=Preston|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Preston|date=1 August 2010|publisher=[[guardian.co.uk]]|accessdate=24 August 2010 |location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804210852/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/aug/01/afghan-war-wikileaks-press-comment|archivedate=4 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url =https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/09/afghanistan-war-logs-readers-editor |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Chris |last=Elliott |title=Open door |date=9 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partially in response to this criticism, [[Julian Assange]] claimed that [[WikiLeaks]] had sought the help of [[Executive Office of the President|the White House]], via ''[[The New York Times]]'', in redacting the names of 'innocent' people but that this request had been denied.&lt;ref name=Dishneau2010&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dishneau|first1=David|title=Informant says WikiLeaks suspect had civilian help |work=Washington Times |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/jul/31/informant-wikileaks-suspect-had-civilian-help/|agency=Associated Press|date=31 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803095256/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jMcOwbxcWePUbiw1xIxXaes1qn3AD9HA9VB00|archivedate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goodman2010&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goodman|first1=Amy|title=Julian Assange Responds to Increasing US Government Attacks on WikiLeaks|url=https://www.democracynow.org/2010/8/3/julian_assange_responds_to_increasing_us|work=Democracy Now!|date=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''New York Times'' reporter, [[Eric Schmitt]], who was acting as an intermediary between WikiLeaks and the White House, told the ''[[Associated Press]]'' that, "I certainly didn't consider this a serious and realistic offer to the White House to vet any of the documents before they were to be posted, and I think it's ridiculous that Assange is portraying it that way now."&lt;ref name=Dishneau2010 /&gt; WikiLeaks spokesperson, [[Daniel Domscheit-Berg|Daniel Schmitt]], told ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' that they had sought the help of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] in reviewing a further 15,000 documents for redactions before releasing them but Marine Colonel David Lapan, a senior spokesperson for the Department of Defense, said they had not been contacted by WikiLeaks.&lt;ref name=Shenon2010&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shenon|first1=Philip|title=WikiLeaks' Cry for Help|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/08/03/wikileaks-julian-assange-admiral-mike-mullen-afghan-war-logs-daniel-schmitt-germany-joint-chiefs-of-staff-pentagon-marine-colonel-david-lapin.html|work=The Daily Beast|date=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julian Assange]] later told an [[Associated Press]] reporter in Sweden that WikiLeaks had contacted the Department of Defense's chief legal counsel, via its lawyers—a claim that was denied by Bryan Whitman, a spokesman for [[Defense Secretary]], [[Robert Gates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hosenball|first1=Mark|title=Pentagon Says WikiLeaks Is Fibbing|url=http://www.newsweek.com/pentagon-says-wikileaks-fibbing-217194|work=Newsweek|date=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a letter, written by [[General Counsel of the Department of Defense]], [[Jeh Charles Johnson]], in reply to WikiLeaks' attorney, Timothy Matusheski, was later released (either by the Department of Defense or WikiLeaks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |url=http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/08/20/wikileaks/index.html |title=Why won't the Pentagon help WikiLeaks redact documents? |publisher=Salon.com |date=2010-08-20 |accessdate=2013-07-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110327003330/http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/08/20/wikileaks/index.html|archive-date=2011-03-27|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;), in which Johnson identified the names of Afghan informants as 'sensitive items' but, in keeping with Bryan Whitman's later public statement, stated that:

Asked by ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' why WikiLeaks did not review all of the documents and make redactions where necessary before their release, [[Daniel Domscheit-Berg|Daniel Schmitt]] replied that the volume of documents made it impossible.&lt;ref name=Shenon2010 /&gt;

Speaking to ''[[Channel 4 News]]'', official spokesman for [[the Taliban]], [[Zabihullah Mujahid]], said that the Taliban would study the released documents in order to discover and punish informants. 

{{Quote|text=We knew about the spies and people who collaborate with U.S. forces.

When Assange was questioned about this statement by [[Amy Goodman]] in a ''[[Democracy Now!]]'' interview, he responded, 

{{Quote|text=I reviewed the statement of someone that a London paper claimed to be speaking for some part of the Taliban. Remember, the Taliban is actually not a homogenous group. And the statement, as far as such things go, was fairly reasonable, which is that they would not trust these documents; they would use their own intelligence organization's investigations to understand whether those people were defectors or collaborators, and if so, after their investigations, then they would receive appropriate punishment. Now, of course, that is — you know, that image is disturbing, but that is what happens in war, that spies or traitors are investigated.  |author=[[Julian Assange]] |source=&lt;ref name=Goodman2010 /&gt; }}

===Psychological warfare===
Evidence within the documents suggest that the U.S. military has been paying Afghan radio and print media to run favorable stories,&lt;ref name="psyop"&gt;{{cite news | first1=John | last1=Cook | url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ynews/20100727/wl_ynews/ynews_wl3247 | title=Leaked files indicate U.S. pays Afghan media to run friendly stories | newspaper=[[Yahoo]] | date=27 July 2010 | accessdate=4 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100730083935/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ynews/20100727/wl_ynews/ynews_wl3247| archivedate= 30 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; with two prominent examples&lt;ref name="psyop"/&gt; being [[Radio Ghaznawiyaan]] and [[Wakht News Agency]]. One document refers to supplying pre-made content to a radio station, describing that content as psychological operations/[[psychological warfare]] (PSYOP) material.&lt;ref name="psyop"/&gt;

===Insurgent attacks against civilians===
The leaked documents describe many purported incidents of Taliban and other Afghan insurgent forces attacking civilians. Those forces would also, according to leaked reports, post "Night Letters" on civilian buildings such as [[mosques]] foretelling death for the inhabitants. In one leak from April 2007, [[Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs]] [[Karen Hughes]] requests to verify a video of a 12-year-old [[child soldier]] forced to [[summary execution|kill]] a Pakistani hostage. Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow at the [[think tank]] [[Foundation for Defense of Democracies]], remarked that "the documents demonstrate just how pervasive the Taliban's brutality is in this fight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Taliban's Savagery|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/talibans-savagery|date=3 August 2010|first=Thomas|last=Joscelyn|work=[[The Weekly Standard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary==

===Significance of the disclosure===

====WikiLeaks====
Julian Assange said "it is the most comprehensive history of a war ever to be published, during the course of the war".&lt;ref name="tells-all" /&gt; He compared the release of the war logs with the release of the [[Pentagon Papers]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="tells-all"&gt;{{cite news |title=Afghan leak: Wikileaks Julian Assange tells all |newspaper=[[Channel 4]] |date=25 July 2010 |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/international_politics/afghan+leak+wikileaks+julian+assange+tells+all/3723392 |accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Anna |last1=Doble |first2=Ed |last2=Fraser |title=Secret files reveal 'unseen Afghan war' |publisher=[[Channel 4]] |date=26 July 2010 |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/international_politics/secret+files+wikileaks+exposes+aposunseen+afghan+warapos/3723387 |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview with ''Der Spiegel'', Assange said that he believed the release would "change public opinion", and said that "we understand why it is important to protect certain U.S. and ISAF sources". He added that "the most dangerous men are those who are in charge of war. And they need to be stopped."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange on the 'War Logs': 'I Enjoy Crushing Bastards' |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,708518,00.html |newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=26 July 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727234634/http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0%2C1518%2C708518%2C00.html# |archivedate=2010-07-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assange also claimed that the files "suggest thousands of [[war crime]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Files 'suggest thousands of war crimes,' says Wikileaks founder Julian Assange |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/files-suggest-thousands-of-war-crimes-says-wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-14889654.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20100728010037/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/files-suggest-thousands-of-war-crimes-says-wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-14889654.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 July 2010 |newspaper=[[The Belfast Telegraph]] |date=27 July 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2010&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====News organisations given advanced access to the documents====

=====''The New York Times''=====
''The New York Times'' described the war logs as "a six-year archive of classified military documents [that] offers an unvarnished and grim picture of the Afghan war".

On the decision to publish, they stated:

{{blockquote|Deciding whether to publish secret information is always difficult, and after weighing the risks and public interest, we sometimes chose not to publish. But there are times when the information is of significant public interest, and this is one of those times. The documents illuminate the extraordinary difficulty of what the United States and its allies have undertaken in a way that other accounts have not.

Most of the incident reports are marked "secret", a relatively low level of classification. The Times has taken care not to publish information that would harm national security interests. The Times and the other news organizations agreed at the outset that we would not disclose – either in our articles or any of our online supplementary material – anything that was likely to put lives at risk or jeopardize military or antiterrorist operations. We have, for example, withheld any names of operatives in the field and informants cited in the reports.&lt;ref name=NYTeditorsnote/&gt;}}

=====''The Guardian''=====
''The Guardian'' called the material "one of the biggest leaks in U.S. military history...a devastating portrait of the failing [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]], revealing how coalition forces have killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents, Taliban attacks have soared and [[NATO]] commanders fear neighbouring Pakistan and Iran are fuelling the insurgency".&lt;ref name=GuardianLeaks/&gt;

''The Guardian'' also reported that [[Daniel Ellsberg]] has described the disclosure as on the scale of his leaking of the [[Pentagon Papers]] in 1971 revealing how the U.S. public was misled about the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=GuardianEllsberg&gt;{{cite news | first=Richard | last=Norton-Taylor | title=Daniel Ellsberg describes Afghan war logs as on a par with 'Pentagon Papers' | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date=27 July 2010 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/27/daniel-ellsberg-war-logs-pentagon-papers | accessdate=27 July 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Der Spiegel''=====
''Der Spiegel'' wrote that "the editors in chief of ''Spiegel'', ''The New York Times'' and the ''Guardian'' were 'unanimous in their belief that there is a justified public interest in the material{{' "}}.&lt;ref name="Spiegel1"/&gt;

=====United States military=====
&lt;!-- There is also a Pentagon view here, but I'm not sure where to place it. --&gt;
U.S. Army officials condemned the public dissemination of military secrets and the White House urged the website WikiLeaks to not publish any more classified documents related to the Afghan war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Bowman |url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/Mullen-Leak-of-Afghanistan-Documents-May-Cost-Lives-99720029.html |title=US Military Officials Condemn Leaks of Afghan War Documents |publisher=.voanews.com |date=2010-07-31 |accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/US-Army-Private-in-Wikileaks-Case-Transferred-to-Military-Jail-in-US-99625149.html |title=White House Urges WikiLeaks to Not Publish More Secrets |publisher=.voanews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said that it is up to the Justice Department to determine if there would be criminal charges in the release of classified military documents by WikiLeaks, but the website was "morally guilty for putting lives at risk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/08/01/gates.wikileaks/?hpt=T2#fbid=Uplw7ezfGkE |publisher=CNN |title=Gates: Posting classified war documents was morally wrong |date=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 August 2010, U.S. military authorities urged Wikileaks to return the already published 70,000 documents, and the other 15,000 records the website was expected to post soon as well, which contained sensitive details of Afghans who had assisted ISAF forces.

=====Afghan authorities=====
According to a statement by [[Rangin Dadfar Spanta]], security advisor to the Afghan government and a former Minister of Foreign Affairs, the allies of Afghanistan had failed to pay necessary attention to prevent the support for international terrorism and to eliminate its hideouts and centres that can create a major threat to security and stability in the region. "The content of these documents reveal that Afghanistan has been righteous in its stance about the rise of terrorism and political and military discrepancies in counter-terrorism struggle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tolonews.com/en/afghanistan/155-afghan-allies-have-not-paid-attention-to-the-region-spanta |title=Afghan Allies Have not Paid Attention to the Region: Spanta |publisher=Tolonews.com |date=2010-07-27 |accessdate=2013-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604195431/http://www.tolonews.com/en/afghanistan/155-afghan-allies-have-not-paid-attention-to-the-region-spanta |archivedate=4 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Council on Foreign Relations=====
Daniel Markey, a senior fellow with the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] and former South Asia analyst for the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]], said, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whether WikiLeaks uncovered anything new isn't actually important&amp;nbsp;– it's on the front page of every newspaper in the country; the media is now focused on Afghanistan, and that makes it a big deal. [...]  The public is now more skeptical about the administration's strategy in Afghanistan than they were last week, and that makes it real.&lt;ref name="politico"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Glenn |last1=Thrush |first2=Josh |last2=Gerstein |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0710/40251.html |title=Leaks loom over W.H. war strategy |newspaper=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]] |date=27 July 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727234623/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0710/40251.html|archivedate=27 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====''Los Angeles Times''=====
An editorial in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated that comparisons to the Pentagon Papers was an exaggeration as the documents lacked the policy implications of the papers, but that "no democracy can or should fight a war without the consent of its people, and that consent is only meaningful if it is predicated on real information".&lt;ref name="WikiLeaks wasn't wrong"&gt;{{cite news|title=WikiLeaks wasn't wrong |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-wikileaks-20100727,0,4123134.story |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=26 July 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728001408/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-wikileaks-20100727%2C0%2C4123134.story |archivedate=28 July 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Los Angeles Times'' did seem to indicate the documents have parallels with the Pentagon Papers in being published during a subsequent administration "the documents offer insight primarily into the war-fighting of the recently departed George W. Bush administration; the Pentagon Papers ended with the Johnson administration and were not published until Richard Nixon was president."&lt;ref name="WikiLeaks wasn't wrong"/&gt;

=====''The Washington Post''=====
An editorial in ''[[The Washington Post]] ''stated "they hardly provide a secret history of the war or disclose previously unknown malfeasance" and that "tends to fill out and confirm the narrative of Afghanistan between 2004 and 2009 that most Americans are already familiar with".&lt;ref name="Washpost"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wikileaks' release of classified field reports on Afghan war reveals not much |date=27 July 2010 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/26/AR2010072604626.html |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Post'' commented that it hardly merited the media hype and was not comparable to the Pentagon Papers or the [[Stasi#The MfS files after the end of the SED regime|MfS files]].&lt;ref name="Washpost" /&gt; The editorial argued that WikiLeaks' founder revealed his organization's antiwar agenda by making the claim it contained evidence for prosecuting [[war crime]]s.&lt;ref name="Washpost" /&gt;

=====''Foreign Policy''=====
Blake Hounshell wrote in his blog on ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' that, after reading "selected documents", he believed that there is less new information in the documents than ''The New York Times'', ''The Guardian'', and ''Der Spiegel'' were reporting.&lt;ref name="FP-Hounshell"&gt;{{cite web |first=Blake |last=Hounshell |title=The logs of war: Do the Wikileaks documents really tell us anything new? |date=25 July 2010 |url=http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/07/25/the_logs_of_war |work=[[Foreign Policy]] |accessdate=26 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729130800/http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/07/25/the_logs_of_war|archivedate=29 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hounshell indicated how careful both ''The Guardian'' and ''The New York Times'' were to note "the raw reports in the Wikileaks archive often seem poorly sourced and present implausible information".&lt;ref name="FP-Hounshell" /&gt; Commenting on the significance of the documents:

A coalition of five human-rights organizations addressed [[Julian Assange]], founder and editor of WikiLeaks, expressing concerns for the safety of persons identified in the published documents. These human-rights groups were [[Amnesty International]], [[Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict]] (CIVIC), [[Open Society Institute]] (OSI), the [[Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission]] (AIHRC) and the Kabul office of the [[International Crisis Group]] (ICG), all worried about the execution of Afghan civilians by the Taliban and other insurgent groups. The AIHRC published figures showing that executions had soared in the first seven months of 2010 to 197, from a total of 225 in all of 2009.

In an open letter to Assange, [[Jean-François Julliard]], RWB secretary-general, and [[Clothilde Le Coz]], RWB's representative in Washington, D.C., wrote that the publication was "highly dangerous", particularly when it named Afghan informants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rsf.org/united-states-open-letter-to-wikileaks-founder-12-08-2010,38130.html |title=Open letter to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange: ''A bad precedent for the Internet's future'' |publisher=En.rsf.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/world/reporters-without-borders-says-wikileaks-irresponsible/story-e6frf7lf-1225904776147 |title=Reporters Without Borders says Wikileaks 'irresponsible' |publisher=Heraldsun.com.au |date= |accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifex.org/united_states/2010/08/12/open_letter_to_wikileaks/ |title="Campaigns and Advocacy – Open letter to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange: "A bad precedent for the Internet's future", RSF says" |publisher=Ifex.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/08/12/reporters-borders-wikileaks-reckless/ |work=Fox News |title=Reporters Without Borders: WikiLeaks Was Reckless |date=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/aug/12/wikileaks-preparing-release-more-afghan-files/ |title=WikiLeaks preparing to release more Afghan files |work=Washington Times |date=2010-08-12 |accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of the book ''WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy'' [https://www.amazon.com/WikiLeaks-Inside-Julian-Assanges-Secrecy/dp/161039061X] forced Assange's hand. The authors inadvertently divulged the entire set of unredacted documents by including the decryption key for those documents in their book. Once decrypted portions of these documents started appearing across the Internet [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/09/unredacted_us_d.html], Assange decided that the most responsible course of action [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20869-assange-why-wikileaks-was-right-to-release-raw-cables/ was] to simply make them available through WikiLeaks.

==Source of the leak==
{{Main|Chelsea Manning}}
[[WikiLeaks]] originally said it did not know the source of the leaked data. Julian Assange stated, "Our whole system is designed such that we don't have to keep that secret".&lt;ref name="google1" /&gt; The Pentagon launched an inquiry;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brad |last=Norington |title=Pentagon hunts for source of leaks |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/pentagon-hunts-for-source-of-leaks/story-e6frg6so-1225897736924 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date=28 July 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Winnett |title=Afghan war logs: inquiry launched into source of leaks |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/7909771/Afghan-war-logs-inquiry-launched-into-source-of-leaks.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=26 July 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2010 |location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729135628/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/7909771/Afghan-war-logs-inquiry-launched-into-source-of-leaks.html|archivedate=29 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonel Dave Lapan, a spokesperson for the Pentagon, said that investigators were trying to determine who leaked the material and said that [[Chelsea Manning]], a 22-year-old [[U.S. Army]] [[intelligence analyst]], was someone they were "looking at closely" in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Julian E. |last=Barnes |title=Pentagon Eyes Accused Analyst Over WikiLeaks Data |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704700404575391523088194344?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEFTTopStories |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=27 July 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728134407/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704700404575391523088194344.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEFTTopStories|archivedate=28 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2013, Manning was convicted of [[espionage]] and other charges for disclosing the [[Collateral Murder video#Leaked video footage|Baghdad airstrike video of 2007]] (known as "Collateral Murder"), the [[United States diplomatic cables leak|diplomatic cables leak of 2010]] (known as "Cablegate"), and other classified information. That video was made public through WikiLeaks, along with many diplomatic cables, but war logs were not specifically among the charges against Manning at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bradleymanning.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Charge-Sheet-redacted-Manning.pdf |title=Official charge sheet for Bradley Manning |publisher=bradleymanning.org |accessdate=28 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214041023/http://www.bradleymanning.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Charge-Sheet-redacted-Manning.pdf |archivedate=14 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite news |title=US soldier charged over Apache Wikileaks video |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/07/07/2946534.htm?section=world |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=7 July 2010 |accessdate=27 July 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810161307/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/07/07/2946534.htm?section=world|archivedate=10 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Dishneau |title=Alleged Army whistleblower felt angry and alone |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5haxoKNMZev63Ph0ZkRkMsEaPeCrwD9GPORO00 |publisher=[[Google]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=27 July 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709173631/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5haxoKNMZev63Ph0ZkRkMsEaPeCrwD9GPORO00|archivedate=9 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Insurance file"==
On 30 July, a few days after the initial disclosure, media began to report that WikiLeaks had released an additional file named "insurance.aes256"  in connection with the Afghan War Diary disclosure. The new "insurance file" was [[AES-256]] encrypted, 1.4 GB in size, with a [[timestamp]] of 31 December 2010 6:00 PM, and with a [[SHA1]] checksum of "cce54d3a8af370213d23fcbfe8cddc8619a0734c".&lt;ref name="Wikileaks" /&gt; It is also available at the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/WikileaksWarDiaryInsurance |title=Wikileaks War Diary Insurance |date=1 August 2010 |publisher=[[Internet Archive]] |accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/WikiLeaks_Insurance_File |title=WikiLeaks Insurance File |date=8 December 2010 |publisher=[[Internet Archive]] |accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 1.4 GB, that file was 20 times larger than the batch of 77,000 secret U.S. military documents about Afghanistan that WikiLeaks already published, and cryptographers said that the file was virtually impossible to crack, unless WikiLeaks releases the key used to encode the material.&lt;ref name="Wikileaks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zetter |first=Kim |url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/07/wikileaks-insurance-file/ |title=WikiLeaks Posts Mysterious 'Insurance' File |publisher=Wired.com |date=2013-03-28 |accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/digital-living/4006626/Could-Wikileaks-be-stopped-theoretically|title=Could Wikileaks be stopped, theoretically?|date=2010|accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/08/05/ap/tech/main6746666.shtml |work=CBS News |title=Insurance file virtually impossible to crack }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1890 and 1918, [[Scramble for Africa|Western colonial expansion in Africa]] led to the removal of many pieces of sub-Saharan [[African art]] that were subsequently brought to Europe and displayed.&lt;ref name="Coombes 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coombes|first=Annie E.|title=Reinventing Africa : museums, material culture and popular imagination in late Victorian and Edwardian England|year=1997|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0300068905|edition=2nd pr}}&lt;/ref&gt; These objects entered the collections of natural history museums, art museums (both encyclopedic and specialist) and private collections in Europe and the United States.

==The removal of African artworks from their source countries during the 19th Century==
Before the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885, traders and explorers to Africa bought or stole art as souvenirs and [[wikt:curios|curios]],&lt;ref name="Schildkrout and Keim" /&gt; speading beyond the coast; ivory objects made along African coasts had been collected for centuries, and many were made by Africans for European markets in a style matching European taste, mainly in areas reached by the Portuguese, the [[Kongo_ivories#Afro-Portuguese_ivories|Afro-Portuguese ivories]]. The period dominated by curio collecting, in which objects served as souvenirs, was followed by a period of trophy collecting in which large collections of artifacts (mostly weapons), and animal skins, horns, and tusks from hunting expeditions, were a tangible means of showing penetration, conquest and domination.&lt;ref name="Schildkrout and Keim"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Scramble for Art in Central Africa|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|editor=Enid Schildkrout and Curtis A. Keim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1870s, thousands of African sculptures arrived in Europe in the aftermath of colonial conquest and exploratory expeditions. They were placed on view in museums such as the [[Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro]], founded in 1878 in Paris, and its counterparts in other European cities.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt; At the time, these objects were treated as artifacts of colonized cultures rather than as artworks and were very cheap, often sold in flea markets and pawnshops.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences"&gt;{{cite web|last=Denise|first=Murrell|title=African Influences in Modern Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/aima/hd_aima.htm|work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|date=April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European collections==
[[File:Musée du Congo, Tervuren, Belgium; one of five interior scen Wellcome V0014543.jpg|thumb|Art on display at the [[Royal Museum of Central Africa]].]]

The different histories of museums inEurope and the United States affected the collecting and display of African art in both places.&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011" /&gt; European museums typically were founded as state institutions and thus their collections and displays were shaped by national interests. The appreciation of African objects purely as fine art in Europe was largely limited to private galleries in the early twentieth century. In Paris, dealers such [[Paul Guillaume]], [[Charles Ratton]] and [[Louis Carre]] played a role in the formation of major private collections of African art. The latter half of the twentieth century saw the opening of the first European art museums devoted to collecting and displaying African art, including the [[Barbier-Mueller Museum|Musee Barbier-Mueller]] in Geneva (1977), the [[Musee Dapper]] in Paris (1986),&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011" /&gt; but many if not most general national art museums by then had collections.

===Royal Museum for Central Africa in Belgium===
In 1897, [[King Leopold II]] took advantage of the [[Brussels International Exhibition]] in [[Tervuren]] to promote his holdings of the [[Congo Free State|Congo]]. The [[Brussels International (1897)|1897 International Exhibition]] piqued scientific interest in the people and animals of Central Africa, thus King Leopold II decided to build on his promotion of Congo. The [[Royal Museum of Central Africa]] was established in 1898 as a permanent museum and scientific institution responsible for mounting exhibitions for the Belgian public and encouraging the study of Central Africa.&lt;ref name="Royal Museum for Central Africa"&gt;{{cite web|title=History: From Congo Museum to RMCA|url=http://www.africamuseum.be/museum/about-us/museum/history/Congomuseum|work=Royal Museum for Central Africa|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Museum===

The Sainsbury African Galleries in the [[British Museum]] in London display 600 objects from the greatest permanent collection of African arts and culture in the world. The three permanent galleries provide a substantial exhibition space for the Museum's African collection comprising over 200,000 objects. A curatorial scope that encompasses both archaeological and contemporary material, including both unique masterpieces of artistry and objects of everyday life. A great addition was material amassed by Sir [[Henry Wellcome]], which was donated by the [[Wellcome Collection|Wellcome Historical Medical Museum]] in 1954. 

Highlights of the African collection include the [[Benin Bronzes|Benin]] and [[Igbo-Ukwu]] bronze sculptures, the beautiful [[Bronze Head of Queen Idia]], a magnificent [[Bronze Head from Ife|brass head]] of a Yoruba ruler from [[Ife]], the [[Apapa Hoard]] from Lagos, southern Nigeria, a dozen exquisite [[Kongo ivories#Afro-Portuguese ivories|Afro-Portuguese ivories]], Asante goldwork from Ghana including the [[Thomas Edward Bowdich|Bowdich]] collection, the rare [[Akan Drum]] from the same region in West Africa, a series of soapstone figures from the [[Kissi people]] in Sierra Leone and Liberia, the [[Emil Torday|Torday]] collection of Central African sculpture, textiles and weaponry, important material from Ethiopia following the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]], the unique [[Luzira Head]] from Uganda, excavated objects from [[Great Zimbabwe]] and satellite towns such as [[Mutare]] including a large hoard of Iron Age soapstone figures, a rare divining bowl from the [[Venda]] peoples and cave paintings and [[petroglyph]]s from [[Wildebeest Kuil Rock Art Centre|South Africa]].


The [[Benin Bronzes]] were seized by a [[United Kingdom|British]] force in the [[Benin Expedition of 1897]] and given to the British [[Foreign Office]]. As Paula Girshick Ben-Amos, a professor of anthropology and African Studies at Indiana University, states in The Art of Benin, “art of the Benin Kingdom came to public and scholarly attention in the West in 1897 when members of a British Punitive Expedition brought out thousands of objects as war booty.”2

Around 200 of the bronzes were passed on to the British Museum, while the remainder were divided among a variety of collections, with the majority being purchased by [[Felix von Luschan]] on behalf of the ''Königliches Museum für Völkerkunde'' in [[Berlin]] (the present-day [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin|Ethnological Museum]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Luschan|first=Feliz|title=Die Altertümer von Benin|year=1919|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Oba [[Akenzua II]] began the movement to return the corpus of objects now known in modern discourse as the 'Benin Bronzes'.

===Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro===
The Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro was the first [[Anthropology|anthropological]] museum in Paris, founded in 1878. It closed in 1935 when the building that housed it, the [[Trocadéro#The old Palais du Trocadéro|Trocadéro Palace]], was demolished; its descendant is the [[Musée de l'Homme]], housed in the [[Trocadéro#The new Palais de Chaillot|Palais de Chaillot]] on the same site, and its French collections formed the nucleus of the [[Musée national des Arts et Traditions Populaires (France)|Musée National des Arts et Traditions Populaires]], also in the Palais de Chaillot. Numerous [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] and [[Cubism|Cubist]] artists discovered African art at the Trocadéro Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Paul Crespelle, ''The Fauves'', tr. Anita Brookner, Greenwich, Connecticut: New York Graphic Society, 1962, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=fLIcTrzKNJOssAPtgrmhBQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=yxcOAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Fauves+Trocad%C3%A9ro&amp;q=In+1904%2C+the+two+had+been+in+the+habit+of+visiting+the+Trocadero+Museum+%E2%80%94+ancestor+of+the+Musee+de+I%27Homme+%E2%80%94+to+look+at+the+African+and+Polynesian+collections.+They+regarded+them+simply+as+curiosities%2C+and+it+was+not+until#search_anchor p. 114].&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso said that this art taught him "what painting was all about", seeing it in the museum's African masks, which had been created "as a kind of mediation between [humanity] and the unknown hostile forces that [surround us]",&lt;ref name=Gilot266&gt;Françoise Gilot and Carlton Lake, ''Life with Picasso'', 1964, repr. New York: Anchor/Doubleday, 1989, {{ISBN|978-0-385-26186-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=9eEZTuqRHoiisAPa8fDPDQ&amp;ct=result&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=8TfYAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Picasso+depressed+Gilot&amp;q=Trocadero#search_anchor p. 266].&lt;/ref&gt;  and to have been influenced by the masks in the forms of the figures in [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]], which eventually led to Cubism.&lt;ref&gt;According to Christopher Green, ''Picasso: Architecture and Vertigo'', New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-300-10412-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=e2V5dnM_x4UC&amp;pg=PA51 p. 51] this is "generally accepted" although denied by Picasso himself.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur I. Miller]], ''Einstein, Picasso: Space, Time and the Beauty that Causes Havoc'', New York: Basic, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-465-01859-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VEPaSUitrDkC&amp;pg=PA92 p. 92]: [A]lthough the sharp change in the right-hand demoiselles occurred after Picasso's visit to Trocadéro, . . . . [i]t turns out that African art supported his conceptual approach and convinced him of the deep meaning of geometry as the language of the new art."&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the African collection has since been transferred to the [[Musee du Quai Branly]].

==African art in ethnological collections==
[[File:Drum - Kongo - Royal Museum for Central Africa - DSC05703.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Kongo people|Kongo]] drum in the ethnographic collection of the Royal Museum for Central Africa.]]
Initially, all African art objects were viewed as [[ethnographic]] specimens.  Notably, during the period of 1890 through 1913, all large museums redefined their public image in terms of an educational prerogative.&lt;ref name="Coombes 1997" /&gt; In response to the debate around the use of the terms ''curio'' and ''curiosity'', the League of the Empire in 1904 recommended the "orderly arrangement and the transformation of mere curios into objects of scientific interest by appropriate classification."{{Ref|1}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=none|journal=Museums Journal|date=September 1904|volume=4|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, as a means of validating the expansion of ethnographic collections, the rhetoric often employed was one of the necessity of conservation and preservation in the face of the inevitable extinction of the producers of the materials culture in their custody (121).

[[Stewart Culin]], curator at the [[Brooklyn Museum]], was the first American curator to display ethnological collections as art objects, not as ethnographic specimens, which he did in 1923. Culin distinguished his installation from those of contemporaneous ethnological collections at institutions such as the [[American Museum of Natural History]] and the [[Smithsonian Museum of Natural History]] in saying that "the objects of Negro art which are displayed publicly form part of museum collections of African ethnology and receive no special attention at the hands of ethnologists... In the majority of these collections their artistic significance is obscured by the wealth of material, and lost, not infrequently, in the efforts made for its elucidation."&lt;ref name="Culin 1923"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Culin|first=Stewart|title=Negro art|journal=Brooklyn Museum Quarterly|year=1923|volume=10|issue=3|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Siegmann 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Siegmann|first=William C.|title=African art a century at the Brooklyn Museum|year=2009|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=9780872731639|author2=Dumouchelle, Kevin D. (contributions)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Art/Artifact'', an exhibition organized by [[Susan Vogel]] in 1988, presented 160 objects of art and ethnography selected from the [[Buffalo Museum of Science]], the [[Hampton University Museum]] (Virginia), and the [[American Museum of Natural History]] (New York City). All three are anthropology museums founded in the 1860s with distinguished African collections. The exhibition examined the shifting definitions of art and artifact, and dealt with the question of how we look at objects from traditional African cultures whose classification systems differ from contemporary Western culture.

==African art and Western Modernism==
During the early 1900s, the aesthetics of traditional African sculpture became a powerful influence among European artists who formed an avant-garde in the development of modern art, known as the "[[Primitivism]]" movement.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt; In France, [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and their [[School of Paris]] friends blended the highly stylized treatment of the human figure in African sculptures with painting styles derived from the [[post-Impressionist]] works of [[Cézanne]] and [[Gauguin]]. The resulting pictorial flatness, vivid color palette, and fragmented [[Cubist]] shapes helped to define early [[modernism]]. While these artists knew nothing of the original meaning and function of the West and Central African sculptures they encountered, they claimed to instantly recognize the spiritual aspect of the composition and to adapt these qualities to their own efforts to move beyond the naturalism that had defined Western art since the Renaissance.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt;

[[German Expressionist]] painters such as [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] of [[Die Brücke]] (The Bridge) group, based in [[Dresden]] and [[Berlin]], conflated African aesthetics with the emotional intensity of dissonant color tones and figural distortion, to depict the anxieties of modern life, while [[Paul Klee]] of the [[Blaue Reiter]] (Blue Rider) in [[Munich]] developed transcendent symbolic imagery.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt; The Expressionists' interest in non-Western art intensified after a 1910 [[Gauguin]] exhibition in [[Dresden]], while modernist movements in Italy, England, and the United States initially engaged with African art through contacts with School of Paris artists. These [[avant-garde]] artists, their dealers, and leading critics of the era were among the first Europeans to collect African sculptures for their aesthetic value.

==American collections==
The 1913 [[Armory Show]] marked a seminal moment for America’s [[avant-garde]]. An exposition of about 1,300 works, it introduced the New York art audience to movements like [[Cubism]], [[Fauvism]] and [[Futurism]], as well as the work of European artists including [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]]. The Armory Show and its promotion of [[Modernism]] also helped create a taste and a market for African art in New York.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt;

Notably, in 1914 two New York galleries introduced African sculpture to their audiences: [[Robert J. Coady]]’s newly opened [[Washington Square Gallery]] and [[Alfred Stieglitz]]'s well-established [[Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession]]. Stieglitz’s held an exhibition in 1914 dedicated entirely to African artifacts as works of art.&lt;ref name="Met Press Room" /&gt;

New York City progressively positioned itself as a central marketplace for African art.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt; During the years 1915-19, American dealers began promoting African objects as art to a growing group of collectors. Among the dealers, Mexican artist [[Marius de Zayas]] (1880–1961) was largely responsible for helping some adventurous modern-art collectors, including [[Walter Arensberg|Walter and Louise Arensberg]], [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]], and Agnes and [[Eugene Meyer (financier)|Eugene Meyer]], to build their African art collections. During the early 1920s, several American institutions began opening their doors to African art.&lt;ref name="Met Press Room"&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Exhibition Tells Story of How African Artifacts Were First Recognized as Art in U.S.|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2012/african-art-new-york-and-the-avant-garde|work=Press Room|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brooklyn Museum===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 69.133.5 Mask.jpg|thumb|upright|A mask of the [[We people]] at the Brooklyn Museum.]]
In 1903, [[Stewart Culin]] (1858–1929) became the founding curator of the Department of Ethnology at the Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, now the [[Brooklyn Museum]].&lt;ref name="Siegmann 2009" /&gt;  Culin, a self-taught ethnologist, built the foundation of four curatorial collections for the Museum, acquiring objects representing African, Asian, Native American, and Eastern European cultures. Culin was among the first curators to recognize museum installation as an art form. He was also among the first to display ethnological collections as art objects, not as ethnographic specimens. This approach is evidenced in his exhibition "Primitive Negro Art, Chiefly from the Belgian Congo". The exhibition opened in April 1923, and displayed African objects he had acquired in Europe from dealers.

===Barnes Foundation===
[[Albert C. Barnes|Albert Barnes]] was one of the first American collectors to selectively acquire an extensive collection of African sculpture purely on aesthetic merits. In 1923, two years before the [[Barnes Foundation]] opening in [[Merion]], Pennsylvania, Barnes wrote, "When the foundation opens, negro art will have a place among the great manifestations of all times."&lt;ref&gt;Albert C. Barnes to Paul Guillaume, November 5, 1923, the Barnes Foundation Archives, Merion, Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his active promotion of the foundation's collection of African sculpture and its aesthetic importance, Barnes himself played a critical role in fostering appreciation of African art in the United States in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011" /&gt;

===Museum of Primitive Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art===

Founded in 1954 by [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]] and [[Rene d'Harnoncourt]], the [[Museum of Primitive Art]] was the first art museum exclusively devoted to exhibiting and collecting works of art from Africa, Oceania, and the Americas for their aesthetic value rather than as ethnographic documents or colonial trophies.&lt;ref name="Ezra 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ezra|first=Kate|title=Representing Africa in American art museums : a century of collecting and display|year=2010|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle|isbn=9780295989617|authorlink=Collecting African Art at New York's Museum of Primitive Art|editor=Kathleen Bickford Berzock, Christa Clarke}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum closed in 1974, and its collection, staff and library were transferred to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] according to an agreement made between Rockefeller and the Met in 1969. The Museum of Primitive Art was in many ways an outgrowth of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA).&lt;ref name="Ezra 2010" /&gt;  It was located directly behind MoMA and was also built on Rockefeller-owned property. Rockefeller was MoMA's president and d'Harnoncourt was its director. MoMA's 1935 landmark exhibition African Negro Art was influential in shaping the director of the Museum of Primitive Art.&lt;ref name="Ezra 2010" /&gt; Today, the Museum of Primitive Art collection is housed in the Metropolitan Michael C. Rockefeller Wing.

===National Museum of African Art===
The [[National Museum of African Art]] in Washington D.C. was founded by [[Warren M. Robbins]] in 1964 as a private and relatively small collection. In 1979 the collection, by then about 8,000 objects, was taken over by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and is now housed in a central if underground location on the [[National Mall]].

==Problems of display==
Many scholars and curators have debated the efficacy of different modes of display of African art in Western museums. Generally, scholars agree that the Western art museum was, and continues to be, incompatible with the contexts from which most traditional [[African arts]] emerged. The following quotation from Kathleen Bickford Berzock and Christa Clarke's introduction to their book ''Representing Africa in American Art Museum'' summarizes the reasons for this incompatibility:

{{quote|text="Art museums reinforced hierarchies of value based on media or genre, favoring paintings and sculpture created solely for artistic appreciation. In contrast, the visual arts of Africa encompass not only sculpture in wood and metal but also beadwork, textiles, basketry, and other works of diverse media, all of which may hold equal value for their creators. And while aesthetics may guide the production of art in Africa, often there are other social, religious, or political concerns that inform its design and use. With this range of forms and materials and the different circumstances of creation and use within society, the diverse arts of Africa were not suited to the aesthetic hierarchies and systems of classification established by art museums. Moreover, museum practices of collecting and display emphasized the artist as individual genius, the school of artists working in a similar style and vein, and chronology. Such categorization was not easily replicated with African objects, which were often collected with fragmentary documentation that rarely identified the individual artist or the specific time period of creation."&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berzock|first=Kathleen Bickford|title=Representing Africa in American Art Museums|year=2011|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle &amp; London|pages=3–19|authorlink=A Historical Introduction|author2=Christa Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==Post-1980s African Art==
Post-1980s [[curator]]ial approaches to collecting and displaying historical African art tend towards greater specialization, broadening definitions, and a desire for contextualization.&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011" /&gt;

Curatorial debate surrounds questions about where boundaries should be drawn between traditional and modern, between African and the [[African diaspora]] in the Americas and Europe, and between [[sub-Saharan]] and [[North African]] art. In certain instances, tradition-based and contemporary works have been exhibited together, a practice that began with the exhibition "Astonishment and Power: Kingo Minkisi &amp; the Art of Renee Stout" at the National Museum of African Art in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Atwood ARTnews"&gt;{{cite news|last=Atwood|first=Roger|title=African Art: Beyond the Masks|url=http://www.artnews.com/2012/09/17/beyond-the-masks/|accessdate=16 October 2013|newspaper=ARTnews|date=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this exhibition was criticized for suggesting a cultural continuity between pre-modern African art and African-American art today while ignoring crucial cultural differences between these two bodies of work.&lt;ref name="Cotter 1993"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cotter|first=Holland|title=ART VIEW; Art That's Valued for What It Can Do|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/arts/art-view-art-that-s-valued-for-what-it-can-do.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=16 October 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 July 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Benin]] artist [[Meschac Gaba]]'s installation "Museum of Contemporary African Art" at [[Tate Modern]] belies the fact that there is no such thing as a museum of [[contemporary African art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of Contemporary African Art|url=http://www.museumofcontemporaryafricanart.com/entree.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
:1.{{Note|1}}In 1903, the League of the Empire was founded in England with the aim of bringing children from different parts of the [[British Empire|Empire]] into contact with one another through correspondence, lectures and exchanges. A distinguished group of museum directors and officials headed a sub-committee of the League entitled 'School Museum Committee.'

'''Ballance Agri-Nutrients (Kapuni) Ltd v The Gama Foundation''' 
(2005) 5 NZCPR 16
is a cited case in [[New Zealand]] regarding whether a nominee stated in a [[contract]] is sufficiently designated in order for the Contracts (Privity) Act 1982 to apply.
&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |pages=187–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Ballance leased a Christchurch industrial property. In April 2001, Ballance had given 6 months notice that they were terminating the lease. At this date, the property was originally owned by Gama Holdings, but on 10 June 2001, ownership was transferred to the related company Gama Foundation.  

Ballance were not notified of the sale at the time.

Due to the fact that the sale was a related party transaction, the sale was not registered until 9 months later in January 2002.

This delay caused problems for the landlord, when they sought payment for damages to the property, forcing Gama to seek payment as a permitted assignor under section 4 of the Contracts (Privity) Act 1982.

Ballance disputed that Gama Foundation was a permitted assignor.

'''Bert''' is a Belgian comic strip, written and drawn by [[Kamagurka]], which appeared exclusively in the Flemish magazine ''[[HUMO]]'' since 1977. The cartoons have also been published in the Dutch magazine ''[[Vrij Nederland]]'', the French magazine ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' and the US magazine ''[[RAW (magazine)|RAW]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_ons003199901_01/_ons003199901_01_0044.php&lt;/ref&gt; The series' protagonist, Bert, is Kamagurka's most recognizable character.

==Concept==
Bert is a middle-aged bespectacled man with a long nose who always wears a sweater and long trousers. His full name is ''Vanderslagmulders'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_ons003199901_01/_ons003199901_01_0044.php&lt;/ref&gt; but is seldom used in the series. He is a [[flat character]], but does demonstrate absurd behaviour. In many cartoons he is giving absurd [[monologue]]s, often with [[misanthrope|misanthropic]] comments.

In the early 1990s Bert received his own pet dog: Bobje ("Little Bob").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kamagurka.htm?lan=dutch |title=Kamagurka (Luk Zeebroek) &amp;#124; Lambiek Comiclopedia |publisher=Lambiek.net |date= |accessdate=2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bobje is an anthropomorphic dog with a human face. He is often seen walking on two feet or doing things only humans can. Despite all that he is unable to talk and still treats Bert as his master.

==History==
Bert made his debut on November 3, 1977 &lt;ref&gt;KOUSEMAKER, Kees en Evelien, "Wordt Vervolgd- Stripleksikon der Lage Landen", Uitgeverij Het Spectrum, Utrecht, Antwerpen, 1979,&lt;/ref&gt; in the magazine ''[[Humo]]''. Originally the series was named ''Van Maerlantstraat 23'', which was Kamagurka's home address at the time. During the late 1970s the comic sometimes was several pages long, but later it became a one-page [[gag-a-day]] comic.

==Status==

Bert is one of [[Humo]]'s [[mascot]]s and therefore often used on magazine covers or other related [[merchandising]]. He was seen in animated form in the opening titles of Kamagurka and [[Herr Seele]]'s TV sketch show ''Lava'' (1989). During the annual [[Rock Werchter]] rock festival in [[Werchter]], Belgium, when weather allowed it, a meters high inflatable doll of Bert and Bobje was inflated during several of the festival's editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zippolla.be/Evenementen%20Bouw/standen.php |title=Zippolla - Evenementen Bouw - Standen |publisher=Zippolla.be |date= |accessdate=2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Bigglesworth''', nicknamed "'''Biggles'''", is a fictional pilot and [[adventurer]], the [[Title role#Title character|title character]] and [[Protagonist|hero]] of the ''Biggles'' series of [[adventure book]]s, written for young readers by [[W. E. Johns]] (1893–1968). Biggles made his first appearance in the story ''The White Fokker'', published in the first issue of ''Popular Flying'' magazine and again as part of the first collection of Biggles stories, ''The Camels Are Coming'' (both 1932). Johns continued to write "Biggles books" until his death in 1968, the [[Book series|series]] eventually spanning nearly a hundred volumes – including novels and short story collections – most of the latter with a common setting and time.

==Synopsis==
Biggles first appears as a teenaged [[scout (aircraft)|"scout"]] ([[fighter pilot|fighter]]) pilot in the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) during the [[First World War]]. He has joined the RFC in 1916 at the age of 17, having conveniently "lost" his [[birth certificate]].  Biggles represents a particularly "British" hero, combining professionalism with a gentlemanly air. Under the stress of combat he develops from a slightly hysterical youth prone to practical jokes to a calm, confident, competent leader.&lt;ref name = Butts&gt;{{cite book |last = Butts | first = D | editor1-first= T |editor1-last= Watkins |editor2-first = D | editor2-last = Jones |title=A Necessary Fantasy?: The Heroic Figure in Children's Popular Culture |publisher= [[Routledge|Garland Publishing]] | chapter = Biggles – Hero of the Air |location=New York |year=2000 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=3UTyDNVjYxoC&amp;pg=PA137 137–152] |isbn=0-8153-1844-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is occasionally given "special" (secret) missions by the shadowy figure of [[Colonel]] (initially Major) Raymond ([[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]]/[[Air Commodore]] in later books, reflecting the creation of the [[Royal Air Force]] with its own ranks), who is already involved with the [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] side of operations. Biggles is accompanied by his cousin Algernon ('Algy') Lacey and his mechanic Flight Sergeant Smyth, who are to accompany Biggles on his adventures after the war; added to the team in 1935 is the teenager Ginger Hebblethwaite.

==Biggles and his creator==
W. E. Johns was himself a First World War pilot, although his own career did not parallel that of Biggles particularly closely. The author's initial war service was as an infantryman, fighting at [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] and on the [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Macedonian front]].  He was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in September 1917, seconded to the Royal Flying Corps and posted back to England for flight training: Johns served as a flying instructor in England until August 1918, when he transferred to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].  On 16 September 1918 his [[De Havilland DH4]] was shot down on a bombing raid. His observer, Lieutenant Amey, was killed (in two of the stories in ''Biggles Learns to Fly'' observers flying with Biggles are killed or badly wounded) but Johns survived to be taken prisoner of war.&lt;ref name = Butts/&gt; Johns remained with the RAF until 1927, latterly as an administrative officer rather than a pilot: his final rank was [[Flying Officer]] (equivalent to Lieutenant in the RFC) rather than the "[[Captain (land)|Captain]]" he later claimed as part of his [[pen name]].

While the purpose of the Biggles stories was to entertain adolescent boys, in the First World War stories, Johns paid attention to historical detail and helped recreate the primitive days of early air combat, when pilots often died in their first combat and before devices such as respirators and [[parachute]]s had become practical. Various models on which the Biggles character might have been based have been suggested, including rugby player and WWI flying ace [[Cyril Lowe]], fighter pilot [[Albert Ball]] and air commodore [[Arthur Bigsworth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rh7.org/factshts/wejohns.pdf Link between 'Bigsworth' and 'Bigglesworth' suggested]&lt;/ref&gt; Johns stated that the character was a [[Composite character|composite]] of many individuals in the RFC (including himself).&lt;ref name = Butts/&gt;

The bulk of the Biggles books are set after the First World War, and after Johns' flying career was over. Biggles has an unusually lengthy career, flying a number of aircraft representative of the history of British military aviation, from [[Sopwith Camel]]s during the First World War, [[Hawker Hurricane]]s and [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s in the [[Second World War]], right up to the [[Hawker Hunter]] jet fighter in a postwar adventure ''Biggles in the Terai''. In these later books geographic and historical accuracy is rather less evident and the sometimes rather grim detail of the first stories is moderated, in deference to the increasing popularity of the Biggles books with a younger audience than the older adolescents at which they were initially targeted. The books were popular and were eventually translated into Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Flemish, German, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish.&lt;ref name = Butts/&gt;

==Fictional biography==
===Early life===

According to stories in ''The Boy Biggles'' and ''Biggles Goes to School'', James Bigglesworth was born in [[British Raj|India]] in May 1899, the son of an administrator in the [[Indian Civil Service]] and his wife (née Lacey). James was the younger of two sons, Charles being the elder by five years. The young James had little contact with [[European culture]] and commenced a lifelong affection for India, befriending the local Indian boys, exploring the countryside and learning to speak fluent [[Hindi]]. He retained a lifetime gift for languages and as an adult spoke French and German fluently, with a "fair command" of various other languages. He spent holidays in England, under the custody of "Dickpa", an eccentric uncle and inventor who lived in rural [[Norfolk]]. When Biggles, now an adult, visits Dickpa, his father's brother, again, an adventure begins that takes both men to Brazil. Biggles then attended Malton Hall School in Hertbury, England. His first encounter with an aircraft was with a [[Bleriot XI|Blériot]] that landed on the school cricket ground.

=== First World War ===

Biggles left school and initially joined the army as a subaltern in the [[The Rifle Brigade|Rifle Regiment]] in 1916. He transferred to the RFC and learned to fly in the summer of 1916, at No. 17 Flying Training School, which was at Settling, Norfolk, flying solo after two hours of instruction. He then attended No. 4 'School of Fighting' in Frensham, Lincolnshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Johns WE |title=Biggles Learns to Fly |publisher=Red Fox |location=London |year=1992 |pages= |isbn=0-09-993820-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Posted to France with under 15 hours, dual and solo, he first flew in combat in September 1916 with 169 Squadron, RFC, (commanded by Major Paynter). His observer was another youth named Mark Way, a [[New Zealand]]er. Biggles began flying the [[Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2|F.E.2b]] "[[Pusher configuration|pusher]]" and later the [[Bristol F.2 Fighter|Bristol F2B]]. In late summer 1917, he was transferred to 266 Squadron RFC, commanded by a [[Dublin]]er, Major Mullen. With 266 Squadron, Biggles flew the [[Sopwith Pup]] and the famed [[Sopwith Camel]], developing a friendly rivalry with 'Wilks' (Captain Wilkinson) and the [[S.E.5]]s of 287 squadron and forming a close friendship with his young cousin Algy (the Hon. Algernon Montgomery Lacey). A study of the short stories featuring his First World War exploits, suggests that he claimed at least 32 kills and was shot down or crash-landed eight times. He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] and the [[Military Cross]] and bar.

===Between the Wars===

After the Great War, Biggles' adventures as a freelance charter pilot, took him around the world in an unidentified amphibian named the "Vandal" (often illustrated on covers, anachronistically, as either a [[Supermarine Walrus]] or [[Supermarine Sea Otter]]). The nearest "real" aircraft that fits W. E. Johns description of the "Vandal", is a [[Vickers Viking|Vickers Viking Mk 4]]. His team grows when he and Algy meet young Ginger Hebblethwaite in ''The Black Peril'', while foiling a possible German plot against Britain. Post-Second World War editions of the book change this to a Russian plot. Ginger brings the energy and daring of youth to these and many of their later adventures. Between the wars Biggles and his friends mix their own escapades with ventures on behalf of British Secret Service.

=== Second World War ===

Biggles returned to service in the Second World War, initially with a [[Supermarine S6B]] type machine in the [[Baltic Sea]] and then to defy the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and their allies in [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= |title=Biggles Defies the Swastika |publisher=Red Fox |location=London |year=1992 |pages= |isbn=0-09-993790-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then took up his post as Commanding Officer of 666 Squadron, RAF, a Special Duties squadron that fought in the [[Battle of Britain]] before being sent around the world on specific assignments.  Biggles, Algy, Smyth and Hebblethwaite are joined by a new companion, the [[monocle]]-wearing Lord Bertram 'Bertie' Lissie.  The changed venue forced Johns to update his material with references to new flying slang and aeroplanes, unsuccessfully at first but later with more realism.  Biggles' new squadron includes a diverse cast, including the American 'Tex' O'Hara (from [[Texas]]), the [[Welsh people|Welshman]] 'Taffy' Hughes, the [[Cockney]] 'Tug' Carrington, the [[Oxford]] graduate Henry Harcourt and 'Ferocity' Ferris from the streets of [[Liverpool]].&lt;ref name = Butts/&gt;

===Special Air Police===

After the Second World War Johns reinvents Biggles' career yet again, with his former boss the [[Air Commodore]] Raymond hiring him as a "flying detective" for [[Scotland Yard]].  Biggles returns to his rooms in Mount Street, Mayfair and assumes a role as head of the new Special Air Police division with Algy, Ginger and Bertie making up the flying squad.  The group takes on criminals who have taken to the air, both at home in [[Great Britain|Britain]] and around the globe, as well as battling opponents behind the [[Iron Curtain]].&lt;ref name = Butts/&gt; The team fly a wide variety of machines, with [[Auster]] and [[Hunting Aircraft|Percival]] types doing much of the work.

Johns continued writing Biggles short stories and novels up until his death in 1968; in all, nearly 100 Biggles books were published.

A final unfinished novel ''Biggles Does Some Homework'' shows Biggles at last preparing to retire and meeting his [[Multiracial|mixed-race]] replacement; Johns died while writing this novel.  The 12 completed chapters were issued privately in 1997.&lt;ref name = Homework&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.biggles.info/Details/97/ | title = Biggles does some homework – plot summary | accessdate = 2010-02-03 | date = 26 July 2006 | last = Harris | first = R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characters ==
===Algernon Montgomery Lacey===
[[The Honourable]] Algernon Montgomery Lacey or “Algy” is a cousin, who is posted to Biggles' flight in 266 Squadron by the influence of his aunt. Despite initial misgivings, the two soon become very close friends and eventually Algy adopts the role of Biggles' second in command. In the books set in the 1930s, Algy, Ginger and Smyth become Biggles' regular companions.
Algy starts off in the books as an irresponsible youngster but later on as he ages he becomes more sarcastic and pessimistic.

===Ginger Hebblethwaite===
Ginger (his real forename is never revealed) first appears in ''The Black Peril'' (1935) as a teenage runaway found hiding in a railway shed. Ginger left his father, a mineworker in Smettleworth, after an argument about Ginger's determination to become a pilot. When he first meets Biggles, he tells him he is on his way to London to join the RAF. Biggles immediately calls him Ginger because of his red hair. He proves his worth by rescuing Biggles from some enemy agents. He becomes one of the regular team and is often Biggles's chosen companion. He is a talented mechanic and his speech is peppered with youthful slang and [[American English|Americanisms]], learned from the cinema.

===Flight Sergeant Smyth===
[[Flight Sergeant]] Smyth is Biggles' trusty mechanic and logistic organiser since they first worked together in 266 Squadron during the First World War. Smyth, aside from being a mechanic in both world wars in Biggles's squadron, also joins them on some journeys to act as mechanic, like ''Cruise of the Condor'' and ''Goes to War''.

===Lord Bertie Lissie===
First appearing in ''Spitfire Parade'' (1941), Lord Bertie is a pilot in 666 Squadron. An eccentric former racing driver, who flies with a [[hunting horn]] and a [[monocle]], Bertie joins Biggles in the Air Police in most of the post-war stories. He is a brave and talented fighter, an expert shot and he has a lot of handy knowledge on a range of unusual subjects.

===Tug Carrington===
A counterpoint to Lord Bertie, Tug is a boxer from the slums of London. His parents being killed in the war, Tug is out for revenge and can be a very risky person to have around. He scorns alcohol, much to the amusement of his fellow squadron members. In return for Biggles setting him up for a job as a London cabby, he occasionally helps Biggles and his gang on their missions after the Second World War.&lt;ref name ="Mackenzie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectingbooksandmagazines.com/bigfrend.html |title=BIGGLES' FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES |last1=Mackenzie |first1=Jim |last2= |first2= |date=9 October 2010 |website=collectingbooksandmagazines.com |publisher= |access-date=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Erich von Stalhein ===
Biggles' greatest opponent is the German intelligence officer Erich von Stalhein,&lt;ref name = Butts/&gt; a member of an old [[Prussia]]n family of soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Opening chapter of ''Biggles Follows on''.&lt;/ref&gt; They first meet in ''Biggles Flies East'', in which Biggles is a spy in the Middle East during the First World War, having some narrow escapes. Stalhein returns as an adversary in numerous other adventures: in ''Biggles &amp; Co.'' he is the leader of a group of smugglers based in a medieval castle somewhere in Germany. As the [[Cold War]] begins, Stalhein enters the services of the [[Communist bloc]], until his new masters imprison him on the island of [[Sakhalin]], from where Biggles helps him to escape in ''Biggles Buries a Hatchet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Johns | first = WE | title = Biggles Buries a Hatchet | publisher = Brockhampton Press | year = 1958 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stalhein then settles in London and he and Biggles remain in touch.  It is from Stalhein that Biggles learns that Janis (see "Female characters" below) survived the Second World War and was imprisoned in [[Czechoslovakia]], from where Biggles rescues her and goes on to support her in England.&lt;ref name = Butts/&gt;

=== William Raymond ===
First appears as a major (later colonel) in the British Intelligence service during the First World War, in which capacity he organises secret ("special") missions in which Biggles takes part. In later books he reappeared as an air commodore.

=== Female characters ===
In the Biggles stories, female characters appear infrequently.  Despite brief affairs, Biggles and his chums remain steadfastly single. Biggles suffers a disappointment in the First World War, when he falls in love with German spy Marie Janis in the short story ''Affaire de Coeur'' set in 1918. Rather than being considered [[asexuality|asexual]] or a repressed homosexual, Biggles' relationship with Janis suggests he is a [[romantic hero]], "tragically loyal to the only woman he ever really loved".&lt;ref name = Butts/&gt;

In ''Biggles &amp; Co.'' Stella Carstairs, the daughter of the man Biggles helps, turns up. A pilot herself, she is concerned for Biggles's safety and tells him more than once not to take on her father's request. 

In ''Biggles Flies Again'' (1934), Algy becomes close to Consuelo, the daughter of the President of Bolivia but is dissuaded from continuing the relationship by Biggles, "...unless you intend marrying her".&lt;ref name ="Mackenzie"/&gt; In ''Biggles Fails to Return'' (1943), Ginger falls in love with the sister of the French pilot who has flown Biggles into France on a secret mission and at the end of the story Ginger gets to spend several weeks in her company while awaiting transport back to England. The young Ginger is also smitten by the beautiful [[Polynesia]]n girl Full Moon, in ''Biggles in the South Seas'' (1940).

There is a discussion of the issue of Biggles, sex and alcohol in ''By Jove, Biggles: The Life of Captain W. E. Johns'' (1981) by [[Peter Berresford Ellis]] and Piers Williams.

In the 1950s, a popular Australian radio version of Biggles, ''The Air Adventures of Biggles'', was made under licence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.otrr.org/FILES/Synopsis_txt/A_Series/AirAdventuresofBiggles.html Old Time Radio Researchers Group] ''otrr.org'' Retrieved 2018-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bigglesforum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=750 Biggles Forum] ''www.bigglesforum.net'' Retrieved 2018-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Johns did not write the scripts and apparently ended the contract after receiving complaints from young readers that the storyline had made Biggles "go soft" by taking up a blonde female lover.

Another female character appears in the form of [[Worrals]] (Flight Officer Joan Worralson), eponymous heroine of a related series of books featuring this resourceful and "plucky" member of the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force|WAAF]]. A further Johns creation, the [[commando]] [[Captain Lorrington "Gimlet" King]], also features in a series of books that intersect with Biggles at times.

== Criticism and controversies ==
===Time===
The settings of the Biggles books are spread over more than 50 years; this produces a number of credibility difficulties, especially for older readers.

Though Biggles and his friends age in the books, they do so much more slowly (and inconsistently) than is historically credible. For instance Biggles (with some of his First World War "chums") who by now should be well into their forties, are still relatively junior squadron officers flying Spitfires during the [[Battle of Britain]]. In the stories set after the end of the Second World War Biggles and Algy, in particular, are, by the rules of arithmetic, passing into their fifties and early sixties, while retaining levels of activity and lifestyle more typical of people at least thirty years younger.

Even within a group of stories set in the same time frame there are some chronological inconsistencies:
* Algy, for instance, seems to be younger than Biggles to a degree that is impossible, at least by the ordinary calendar.
* Biggles first meets Algy in ''The Camels Are Coming'', at the end of which the First World War ends. However, Algy also features throughout ''Biggles in France'', so the whole of ''Biggles in France'' must be set during the second half of ''The Camels Are Coming''.

It is doubtful whether a careful rearrangement of the various First World War stories could result in a coherent sequence.

The author succeeds reasonably well in chronicling developments in aviation technology but social and cultural changes are much more difficult. The cultural and social world of Biggles (whether in the 1930s or some earlier period) does not persist completely unchanged through the whole series – for instance, in an early book, the evidence points to an English nobleman as the perpetrator but Biggles dismisses this out of hand as the gentry would never commit a crime; in a later novel, one of the gentry is the villain. Nonetheless, the social context of the books, viewed in chronological order, does become increasingly old-fashioned, even anachronistic, especially in those works set after the Second World War.

===Racism===
Since the Biggles books were first published, attitudes to race and ethnicity have changed. During the 1960s and 1970s a perception of Biggles as unacceptably [[Racism|racially prejudiced]], especially considered as children's literature, drove Biggles from many public and school libraries.&lt;ref name = Milner&gt;{{cite book |author=Milner D|title=Children and Race |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location=Harmondsworth [Eng.] |year=1975 |pages=224–5 |isbn=0-14-080364-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Biggles was brought up in India, speaks fluent [[Hindi language|Hindi]] and has a number of Indian friends and colleagues. In ''Biggles Goes to School'', on one occasion when told to write lines in Latin, he remarks that he would rather do so in Hindi. On another occasion the adult Biggles asserts to Air Commodore Raymond that "while men are decent to me I try to be decent to them, regardless of race, colour, politics, creed or anything else".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johns |first=W. E. |title=Biggles Delivers the Goods |publisher=Red Fox Books |location= |year=1994 |isbn=0-09-939441-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; While individually developed non-[[white people|white]] characters are rather infrequent, when they do occur, they are usually "positive", from the Oxford-educated "[[Chinese people|Chinaman]]", Li Chi, in ''Biggles Flies Again'' and ''Biggles Delivers the Goods'' and the perky Polynesian girl, Full Moon, in ''Biggles in the South Seas'', to Alexander MacKay, a part "[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Red Indian]]" nicknamed "Minnie" who joins "the chums" as a valued colleague and is even set to inherit Biggles' job in ''Biggles Does Some Homework''. It has been pointed out that the positive characteristics of these characters tend to be such features as relatively light complexions, Western education and general usefulness to the white hero and his friends and allies.&lt;ref name = Milner/&gt;

On the other hand, when Johns wishes to present an unpleasant "foreigner" he will quite often drop a gratuitous and offensive hint that the person involved is of mixed race. Non-whites taken ''en masse'' also tend to be systematically demonised. With the evil "Chungs" of ''Biggles Hits the Trail'' and the sub-human [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginals]] of ''Biggles in Australia'', in particular, Johns succumbs to the tendency, typical of his time, to apply unpleasant stereotyping to non-white opponents of his hero.&lt;ref name = Milner/&gt; ''No Rest for Biggles'', set in [[Liberia]], where he encounters descendants of [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] and [[Henri Cristophe]] plotting to set up a black empire, is another novel which is overtly racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biggles.info/Details/55/ |title=No Rest For Biggles |work=biggles.info |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Biggles in Borneo'', [[Dayak people|Dayak]] [[headhunting|headhunters]] are stereotyped as barely human "savages", even though they are Biggles' allies against the Japanese. The racism in these books (and others in the ''Biggles'' canon) is typical of a genre of fiction for young people that was once common.&lt;ref name = Milner/&gt;

''Biggles Delivers the Goods'' (published just three years after ''Biggles in Borneo'') repeats the earlier work's plot so closely that the later novel is clearly a revision. In both books, Biggles establishes a secret airfield behind Japanese lines, which is discovered and attacked by the Japanese before he can achieve his objectives. Algy is captured by the Japanese and threatened with execution by a brutal Japanese commandant; rubber (as an important [[strategic material]]) figures largely. All ends well in both novels, as a massive air attack relieves the airfield's brave defenders and defeats the Japanese. The protagonists are also closely paralleled in both novels, although in ''Biggles Delivers the Goods'' Li Chi (originally from a short story in ''Biggles Flies Again'') reappears to take the place of a white character from the earlier version; the headhunters, while still milked for "exotic colour", are much more sympathetically treated.

==="Adult" themes===
The early Biggles stories and novels, especially those set in First World War, were apparently written mainly for older adolescents. Death is treated rather frequently and sometimes in quite a grim fashion. Other "adult themes" are also touched on: more than once Biggles sets out on a mission in a "red mist", inspired by the death of a comrade. The emotional [[combat fatigue|strain of combat]] is also realistically described, as Biggles becomes a "highly-strung" fidgeting pale youth, lacking his usual sense of humour. In these stories, in particular, alcohol is mentioned occasionally and cigarettes are much in evidence. The early First World War books were reprinted in the 1950s, when the Biggles books had acquired a younger readership and were [[Expurgation|bowdlerised]]. In the short story ''The Balloonatics'', as republished in ''Biggles of the Special Air Police'', the prize for capturing a German [[observation balloon]] was altered from a case of [[Scotch whisky]] to a case of [[lemonade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Balloonatics |last=Morris |first=A. |year=1970 |publisher=Jarrolds |isbn=0-09-100940-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johns |first=W. E. |title=Biggles of the Special Air Police |publisher=House of Stratus |location=London |year=2001 |isbn=0-7551-0721-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reprint also removes all references to drinking and [[profanity|swearing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biggles.info/Details/01/ |title=The Camels Are Coming |accessdate=2010-02-03 |date=26 July 2006 |last=Harris |first=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books contain no explicit sexual content and the traditional values of bravery, honesty and fair play are stressed. Romantic stories, which would have bored his younger readers and embarrassed the older ones, are on the whole avoided, with the odd exception, such as in ''Biggles Looks Back'', where he and Stalhein rescue Marie Janis (with whom Biggles was briefly in love in an earlier story) from her prison in Bohemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johns |first=W. E. |title=Biggles Looks Back |publisher=House of Stratus |location=Thirsk |year=2002 |isbn=0-7551-0718-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johns died while still writing ''Biggles Does Some Homework''. Although never completed, it was released as a strictly limited edition of 300 copies in paperback.&lt;ref name = Homework/&gt; A further limited print run of 300 hardback copies has been printed in 2007 by Norman Wright publishing.

==In other media==
===Television===
{{Main|Biggles (TV series)}}
Biggles appeared in a TV series based on the books with Neville Whiting playing the title role. There were 44 B&amp;W untitled episodes of 30 minutes, which were made by [[Granada Television|Granada]] and ran from 1 April till 9 September 1960. Biggles was a Detective Air Inspector attached to [[Scotland Yard]]. Helping him was Ginger ([[John Leyton]]) and Bertie (David Drummond) and they fought against villains like von Stalhein (Carl Duering).

===Films===
{{Main|Biggles (film)}}
He was also featured in the 1986 feature film ''[[Biggles (film)|Biggles]]'', directed by [[John Hough (director)|John Hough]] with [[Neil Dickson]] in the title role. The film attempted to add appeal to the character by adding a science fiction element but it was a commercial and critical failure. Dickson reprised the character in all but name in the [[Pet Shop Boys]]' feature film, ''[[It Couldn't Happen Here]]''.

===Video games===
In 1986, a Biggles video game was released as a tie-in to movie ''Biggles: Adventures in Time''  by [[Mirrorsoft]] for the platforms [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]]. It included levels based in 1917 and other levels set in modern-day London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/biggles|title=Biggles for Amstrad CPC (1986) - MobyGames|work=MobyGames}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comics===
There have been many different versions of Biggles comics published in different countries in Europe, including Great Britain, Belgium, France and Sweden.

The first British [[Annual publication|annual]] appeared in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{OCLC| 42347042}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some [[comic album|albums]] were released in 1990 featuring the Biggles team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biggles.nl/en/miklo.html|title=Miklo &amp; Lombard Biggles Comic Albums|work=biggles.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The titles are separate from the books though they cover the same war or after war investigation operations of Biggles.

In India, [[Euro Books]] published 14 titles of the Biggles Series along with compilations of the same in 2007.

===In other W. E. Johns books===
Biggles, or members of his team, have appeared in the following Gimlet books
* King of the Commandos
* Gimlet Goes Again
* Gimlet Mops Up
* Gimlet Bores In
Air Commodore Raymond also appeared in W E Johns' "Steeley Books".

==In popular culture==

The books are collectors' items and lesser known titles, especially those never released in paperback, are rare. A copy of ''Biggles and the Deep Blue Sea'' fetched $1,000 on [[eBay]]. In 2013, most Biggles books were out of print but a core of popular titles have been reprinted from time to time in various editions. Red Fox (a Random House imprint) reprinted a selection of the "pre-1945" titles, with footnotes added to explain slang and military terms used by Johns; fifteen or sixteen of these seem to have been in print in 2013. Collectors interested in acquiring readable copies of the texts (as opposed to mint copies of first editions) have a fair choice of second-hand copies at reasonable prices. 

''Biggles – The Authorised Biography'' by [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]], published in 1978, added new and embellished elements to the character's history, including the ageing Biggles' (apparent) suicide in a vintage Spitfire {{circa|1970.}} A number of Biggles characters appear in [[Kim Newman]]'s [[alternate history]] novel ''[[The Bloody Red Baron]]''. In the ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' Series III episode "[[Marooned (Red Dwarf)|Marooned]]", [[Dave Lister]] burns [[Arnold Rimmer]]'s copy of ''Biggles Learns to Fly'' to stay warm, while stranded on a hostile moon. Later in the Series X opener "[[Trojan (Red Dwarf)|Trojan]]", Rimmer recounts how his brother Howard once painted his rear with orange glow paint, allowing him to read ''Biggles Flies West'' for three nights without needing a torch.

In ''[[The Thin Blue Line (TV series)|The Thin Blue Line]]'' series I episode "The Queen's Birthday Present", it is revealed that Inspector Fowler ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) is an avid reader of Biggles. Fowler is shocked, when constable Habib ([[Mina Anwar]]) suggests that Biggles and Ginger are lovers, something she argues is also the case for [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Dr. Watson]]. Upset, Fowler argues that sex has no part in these stories, hetero or otherwise; "the point of Biggles and of Sherlock Holmes is to solve crimes and kill Germans. And by heaven, that should be enough for any man". 

The lyrics of the [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] song, "[[Thick As a Brick]]", has a line that mentions Biggles ("So, where the hell was Biggles when you needed him last Saturday?"). Biggles is mentioned several times in the elaborate album cover, which is a parody of a local British newspaper, most significantly in a story entitled "Do Not See Me Rabbit".

==Parodies of Biggles==
===''Monty Python's Flying Circus''===
Biggles was [[parody|parodied]] in a series of skits on the 1970s British comedy television show, ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', including one titled "Biggles Dictates a Letter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orangecow.org/pythonet/sketches/biggles.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526195031/http://orangecow.org/pythonet/sketches/biggles.htm |archivedate=26 May 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the sketch, Biggles ([[Graham Chapman]]) behaves in a naive and overreactive manner about the sexual orientation of his comrades, shooting Algy in the process.

Other Monty Python treatments of Biggles include:
* "Cardinal Biggles", complete with flying helmet and goggles, assists in the interrogations in the "[[The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|Spanish Inquisition sketch]]".
* Biggles appears as a woman's lover in the sketch "Strangers in the Night" accompanied by Algy.
* Two text stories, "Biggles Is Extremely Silly" and "Biggles and the Naughty Things", are included in ''[[The Brand New Monty Python Bok]]''.
* The title of a subsequent episode, "Biggles Flies Undone", was mentioned at the end of "Biggles Dictates a Letter", as if the two "episodes" were part of an ongoing adventure serial.
* In the first ''[[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]'' (1985), [[Michael Palin]] read the skit "Biggles Goes to See [[Bruce Springsteen]]".
* A customer in "The Bookshop Sketch", found on ''[[Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album]]'', requests the fictitious "Biggles Combs his Hair".

===Other parodies===
''Biggles Flies A Fokker Home'' is a 2011 play written by former cricketer [[James Graham-Brown]] under the [[pen name]], Dougie Blaxland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/reviews/bigglesrondo-rev |title=Biggles Flies A Fokker Home |last1=Gordon |first1=Sue |last2= |first2= |date= |website=britishtheatreguide.info |publisher= |access-date=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blog]]ger Reed dé Buch has written a series of short Biggles spoofs, set in the [[Iraq War]] called ''Biggles Over Baghdad'', with titles such as ''Biggles and the Weapons of Mass Destruction'' and ''Biggles and the Undersand Railway''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Biggles |title=Literature: Biggles |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=tvtropes.org |publisher= |access-date=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jiggles and the Test Pilot'', ''Jiggles and the Archaeologists'' and ''Jiggles and the Flying Boats'' are erotic adventures, available as ebooks, pastiching the Biggles books. Veronica Jiggleswick runs Jiggleswick Air with her old school chum Ally, and their mechanic Ginge. Set in the late thirties, their adventures see them pitted against Nazis and common criminals, enjoying lots of sex along the way&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marytalesbooks.com/product-category/mary-tales/adventures-of-jiggles/|title=Adventures of Jiggles – Mary Tales Books|website=www.marytalesbooks.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)''''', commonly known simply as '''''Birdman''''', is a 2014 American [[black comedy]] film directed by [[Alejandro González Iñárritu|Alejandro G. Iñárritu]]. It was written by Iñárritu, [[Nicolás Giacobone]], [[Alexander Dinelaris Jr.]], and [[Armando Bó (screenwriter)|Armando Bo]]. The film stars [[Michael Keaton]] with a supporting cast of [[Zach Galifianakis]], [[Edward Norton]], [[Andrea Riseborough]], [[Amy Ryan]], [[Emma Stone]], and [[Naomi Watts]]. The story follows Riggan Thomson (Keaton), a faded Hollywood actor best known for playing the superhero "Birdman", as he struggles to mount a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] adaptation of a short story by [[Raymond Carver]].

The film covers the period of previews leading to the play's opening, and with a brief exception appears as if filmed in a [[One shot (film)|single shot]], an idea Iñárritu had from the film's conception. [[Emmanuel Lubezki]], who won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for his cinematography in ''Birdman'', believed that the recording time necessary for the [[long take]] approach taken in ''Birdman'' could not have been made with older technology. The film was shot in [[New York City]] during the spring of 2013 with a budget of $16.5 million jointly financed by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], [[Regency Enterprises|New Regency Pictures]] and [[Worldview Entertainment]]. It premiered the following year in August where it opened the [[71st Venice International Film Festival]].

''Birdman'' had a limited theatrical release in the United States on October 17, 2014, followed by a wide release on November 14, grossing more than $103 million worldwide. The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], along with [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] from a total of nine nominations, tying it with ''[[The Grand Budapest Hotel]]'' for the most nominated and awarded film at the Academy's [[87th Academy Awards|87th annual awards ceremony]] with four wins per film. It also won Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture at the [[21st Screen Actors Guild Awards]], as well as [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy]] for Keaton and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]] at the [[72nd Golden Globe Awards]].

==Plot==
{{Anchor|Synopsis|Plot}}Riggan Thomson is a faded American actor who is famous for playing the [[superhero]] Birdman in a film trilogy 20 years ago. He is tormented by the mocking and critical internal voice of Birdman and frequently visualises himself performing feats of [[levitation (paranormal)|levitation]] and [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]]. Riggan is trying to gain recognition as a serious actor for writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway adaptation of [[Raymond Carver]]'s short story "[[What We Talk About When We Talk About Love#"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"|What We Talk About When We Talk About Love]]."

Jake, Riggan's best friend and lawyer, is producing the play which co-stars Riggan's girlfriend Laura and Broadway débutante Lesley. Riggan's daughter Sam, a recovering drug addict whom he is trying to reconnect with, is working as his assistant. The day before the first preview, a light fixture falls onto Riggan's hapless co-star Ralph, which Riggan tells Jake he caused. At Lesley's suggestion, Riggan replaces Ralph with her boyfriend, the brilliant but volatile [[method acting|method actor]] Mike Shiner. The first previews are disastrous: Mike breaks character over the replacement of his gin with water, attempts to have real sex with Lesley during a sex scene and claims that the prop gun does not look real which is hindering his performance. Riggan clashes continually with Mike and is incensed at influential theater critic Tabitha Dickinson's praise for Mike's performance, but Jake persuades him to continue with the play. Riggan catches Sam using marijuana and berates her; she tells him he is expendable and that his play is a vanity project.

During the final preview, Riggan accidentally locks himself outside with his robe stuck in the fire escape door. He is forced to walk through [[Times Square]] in his underwear and enter through the audience to do the final scene. A concerned Sam is waiting in his dressing room after the show. She thinks the performance was very weird but sort of cool. She shows him that the Times Square footage is going [[Viral video|viral]] and explains how this actually helps him.

Riggan goes to a bar for a drink and approaches Tabitha, accusing her of not understanding theater and just crudely labeling things. She tells him that she hates ignorant Hollywood celebrities who pretend to be serious actors and promises to "kill" his play with a deprecating review without even having seen it. On the way back, Riggan buys a pint of whiskey, drinks it and passes out on a stoop. The next day, walking to the theater with a severe hangover, he has a conversation with the now visible Birdman, who tries to convince him to quit the play and make a fourth Birdman film. Riggan visualises himself flying through the streets of Manhattan before arriving at the theater.

On the opening night the play is going very well. In his dressing room, a strangely calm Riggan confesses to his ex-wife Sylvia that several years ago he attempted to drown himself in the ocean after she caught him having an affair. He also tells her about his inner Birdman voice, which she ignores. After Sylvia wishes him luck and leaves the room, Riggan picks up a real gun, rather than a prop, for the final scene in which his character commits suicide. At the climax, Riggan shoots himself in the head on-stage. The play receives a [[standing ovation]] as Tabitha rushes out to file copy.

The next day, Riggan wakes up in a hospital with his face covered in a mask of bandages where his nose has been surgically reconstructed after he blew it off during the botched suicide. Sylvia is worried about him but Jake cannot contain his excitement that the play will run forever after Tabitha's rave-review which called the suicide attempt "super-realism" and just what American theater needed. Sam visits with flowers, which he cannot smell, and takes a picture of him to scare the skyrocketing number of followers on the [[Twitter]] account she has created for him. While she steps outside to find a vase, Riggan goes into the bathroom, removes the bandages revealing his swollen new nose, and obscenely says goodbye to Birdman, whom he sees sitting on the toilet. Fascinated by some birds flying outside his room, he opens the window and climbs out onto the ledge. When Sam returns, Riggan is nowhere to be seen. She frantically scans the ground below the open window before slowly looking up into the sky, smiling, and laughing.

===Development===
''Birdman'' director [[Alejandro González Iñárritu|Alejandro G. Iñárritu]] originally conceived the film as a comedy filmed in a [[long take|single shot]] set in a theatre. The original choice behind the film's genre, which was subsequently re-adapted to concentrate on Riggan's final emotional tail spin, came from the director wanting to see a change in his approach. All his previous films were dramas, and after directing ''[[Biutiful]]'', he did not want to approach his new film in the same tragic manner again.&lt;ref name="genocide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alejandro G.

By presenting the film as a continuous shot he could "submerge the protagonist in an 'inescapable reality' and take the audience with him".&lt;ref name="varScott"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: 'Birdman' Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu on His First Comedy |last=Foundas |first=Scott |date=August 27, 2014 |url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/alejandro-gonzalez-inarritu-birdman-interview-1201292156/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=February 12, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225110002/http://variety.com/2014/film/news/alejandro-gonzalez-inarritu-birdman-interview-1201292156/ |archivedate=February 25, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iñárritu shared his idea with the Argentine screenwriters/cousins [[Nicolás Giacobone]] and [[Armando Bó (screenwriter)|Armando Bo]], as well as playwright [[Alexander Dinelaris Jr.]], who had all worked with him on his previous film.&lt;ref name="CS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Birdman: "Completely one shot?

The personal and vocational experiences of the four co-writers were central to writing the script. Dinelaris' exposure to Broadway shaped the depictions of rehearsals and events backstage, though he admitted exaggerating these. He also felt his background writing long scenes of dialogue helped since scenes in the film "were really more like play scenes".&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt; Iñárritu's own experiences influenced many of ''Birdman''{{'}}s themes. "What this film talks about, I have been through," Iñárritu recalled. "I have seen and experienced all of it; it's what I have been living through the last years of my life."&lt;ref name="genocide" /&gt; Dinelaris described this aspect as "a laughing look at oneself", but said it had to be done in a comedic way otherwise "it would have been the most unbelievably self-absorbed look at the subject".&lt;ref name="genocide" /&gt; Themes from [[Raymond Carver]]'s short story "[[What We Talk About When We Talk About Love]]", which Riggan adapts for stage in the story, also influenced the script. Iñárritu wanted to find the connection between the themes in Riggan's story and those of Carver's.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt; Because of this, it was important to the director that Carver's story be the subject of the play depicted within the film. Therefore, Iñárritu stated that his desire to use Carver's work was "terrifying" because the rights to using the Carver material were still subject to the possibility of being rejected during development of the film, but no issues arose. Carver's widow, writer [[Tess Gallagher]], loved the script and permitted the adaptation, saying that Carver would be laughing about the film.&lt;ref name="genocide" /&gt;

While some aspects of the film{{snd}} the first frame with Riggan, for instance{{snd}} went unchanged from ''Birdman's'' conception to release,&lt;ref name="genocide" /&gt; others went through several iterations. One of these was the sequence in which alter ego Birdman takes complete control over Riggan's thoughts. The writers knew it would occur at Riggan's lowest point, so at one stage planned for it to happen after Riggan hears the initial negative press coverage and destroys his dressing room. In another discarded version, Riggan tries to drown himself in [[Central Park]] and flies out to save himself.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt;

The film's ending also changed, the final version being written halfway through filming.&lt;ref name="Taylor 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu Talks 'Birdman,' The Film's "Bad" Original Ending, Critics, 'True Detective' &amp; More |last=Taylor |first=Drew |date=January 8, 2015 |publisher=Indiewire.com |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/interview-alejandro-gonzalez-inarritu-talks-birdman-the-films-bad-original-ending-critics-true-detective-more-20150108?page=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212010101/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/interview%2Dalejandro%2Dgonzalez%2Dinarritu%2Dtalks%2Dbirdman%2Dthe%2Dfilms%2Dbad%2Doriginal%2Dending%2Dcritics%2Dtrue%2Ddetective%2Dmore%2D20150108?page%3D2|accessdate=February 12, 2015 |archivedate=February 12, 2015 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original intended to depict [[Johnny Depp]] in Riggan's dressing room with a ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' poster in the back. Iñárritu grew to strongly dislike this ending, calling it "so embarrassing", and rewrote it with Dinelaris and Giacobone after a new ending came to him in a dream.&lt;ref name="Taylor 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="intvmag_inarritu" /&gt; Iñárritu was reluctant to describe the original ending but it was leaked by Dinelaris. He said the original ending was set in the theatre instead of the hospital, and involved Depp putting on Riggan Thomson's wig, and in [[Jack Sparrow|Jack Sparrow's]] voice "...the poster asks Depp, 'What the fuck are we doing here, mate?' and it was going to be the satire of the endless loop of that."&lt;ref name="taylor2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu Talks 'Birdman,' The Film's "Bad" Original Ending, Critics, 'True Detective' &amp; More |last=Taylor |first=Drew |date=January 8, 2015 |publisher=Indiewire.com |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/interview-alejandro-gonzalez-inarritu-talks-birdman-the-films-bad-original-ending-critics-true-detective-more-20150108?page=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212010101/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/interview%2Dalejandro%2Dgonzalez%2Dinarritu%2Dtalks%2Dbirdman%2Dthe%2Dfilms%2Dbad%2Doriginal%2Dending%2Dcritics%2Dtrue%2Ddetective%2Dmore%2D20150108?page%3D2|accessdate=August 20, 2015 |archivedate=February 12, 2015 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director and co-authors ruled out the satirical ending, and favored the new, more ambiguous, ending.&lt;ref name="intvmag_inarritu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="taylor2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Here's How Johnny Depp Could Have Appeared in Birdman |last=Miller |first=Julie |date=February 10, 2015 |work=Vanity Fair |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/02/johnny-depp-birdman |accessdate=August 20, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212160450/http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/02/johnny-depp-birdman |archivedate=February 12, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project of co-writing was expedited by the collaboration between the four co-writers on the internet working from different geographical locations. With Iñárritu in [[Los Angeles]], Giacobone and Bo in [[Buenos Aires City|Buenos Aires]], and Dinelaris in New York, the script was mainly written through Skype calls and emails.&lt;ref name="genocide" /&gt; Although this complicated the writing process, Dinelaris said he believed the best ideas in ''Birdman'' came from Skype sessions at two in the morning where he and Giacobone were "cracking each other up". Incorporating the one-shot feature also affected the writing. Bo said "We wrote everything thinking of this one shot, and a lot of decisions that would mostly be taken in the editing room were taken before shooting". The one-shot approach meant the scenes could not be removed or re-ordered in post-production, so the writers needed to be "very, very sure about what was on the page."&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt; As a result, it took about a year and a half to complete the final draft.&lt;ref name="SCU"&gt;{{cite web|title=BIRDMAN Writers Thought No One Would 'Get It' |last=Milly |first=Jenna |date=December 5, 2014 |publisher=ScreenwritingU |url=http://www.screenwritingu.com/blog/birdman |accessdate=February 12, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212153111/http://www.screenwritingu.com/blog/birdman |archivedate=February 12, 2015 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Alexander Dinelaris|Dinelaris]] summarized: "You have to be an idiot to do it all in one shot. You have to be an idiot to attempt it. It takes a great, great deal of ignorance to not pay attention to the difficulties and to think you're going to do this.

===Casting===
[[File:Michael Keaton by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Michael Keaton]] was Iñárritu's first choice to play Riggan Thomson]]

Iñárritu cast several of the leading roles before the film was financed.&lt;ref name="financiers"&gt;{{cite web |title=How 'Birdman' Got Made: Fox Searchlight and New Regency Partners Tell All (Keaton, Norton, Stone VIDEOS) |last=Thompson |first=Anne |author-link=Anne Thompson (film critic) |date=October 21, 2014 |publisher=Thompson on Hollywood |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/how-birdman-got-made-fox-searchlight-and-new-regency-partners-tell-all-keaton-norton-stone-videos-20141021 |accessdate=February 15, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225134236/http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/how-birdman-got-made-fox-searchlight-and-new-regency-partners-tell-all-keaton-norton-stone-videos-20141021 |archivedate=February 25, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these was the lead role. Early in script development, Iñárritu did not have Keaton in mind,&lt;ref name="varScott" /&gt; but he had changed his mind by the end: "When I finished the script, I knew that Michael was not the choice or option, he was the guy".&lt;ref name="NYT_Kíton"&gt;{{cite news|title=Everyman Returns |last=Ryzik |first=Melena |date=October 8, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/movies/in-birdman-michael-keaton-confronts-the-nature-of-fame.html |accessdate=February 15, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215053658/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/movies/in-birdman-michael-keaton-confronts-the-nature-of-fame.html |archivedate=February 15, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iñárritu cast Keaton for his depth in a variety of acting styles: he could handle the demands of the stage, up-close work, and comedy and empathy "with a profound depth to both."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Normal Day in the Unusual Life of Michael Keaton |last=Chiarella |first=Tom |date=January 28, 2014 |work=Esquire |url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/interviews/a26339/michael-keaton-interview-0214/ |accessdate=February 15, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WbebfXN7?url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/interviews/a26339/michael-keaton-interview-0214/ |archivedate=February 25, 2015 |deadurl=no |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keaton knew about ''Birdman'' before Iñárritu contacted him. He was in the middle of production of another project when he learned that Iñárritu was making another film. Keaton, a fan of his work, flew home to find out more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It Took Michael Keaton About 27 Seconds To Decide To Be In 'Birdman' |last=Acuna |first=Kirsten |date=October 18, 2014 |publisher=Business Insider |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/birdman-michael-keaton-casting-2014-10 |accessdate=February 15, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WbgWvaS4?url=http://www.businessinsider.com/birdman-michael-keaton-casting-2014-10 |archivedate=February 25, 2015 |deadurl=no |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iñárritu sent him the script and they discussed it over dinner. The first thing Keaton asked the director was whether he was making fun of him (regarding his role in [[Tim Burton]]'s [[Batman in film#Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher|''Batman'' films]]), but after Iñárritu explained the role, its technicalities and the film's production, Keaton agreed to play Riggan.&lt;ref name="varScott" /&gt;

Iñárritu called his decision behind casting Galifianakis as Jake "a bet". Galifianakis met the director's criteria of being lovable and funny, but Iñárritu also considered him sensitive, which scored him the role.&lt;ref name="rappler"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: 'Birdman' director Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu |work=Rappler |date=January 17, 2015 |publisher=Rappler.com |url=http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/81025-birdman-director-alejandro-gonzales-inarritu-interview |accessdate=February 15, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225131953/http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/81025-birdman-director-alejandro-gonzales-inarritu-interview |archivedate=February 25, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emma Stone already knew she wanted to work with Iñárritu before she was offered the role of Sam.

Once these actors were committed, Iñárritu sought funding. He first invited [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] to finance the project, but they turned his offer down because they felt his asking budget was too high.&lt;ref name="financiers" /&gt; At one stage Megan Ellison of [[Annapurna Pictures]] wanted to be involved in the project, but decided against it because, unlike her other films, she had not been involved since the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu Talks 'Birdman,' The Film's "Bad" Original Ending, Critics, 'True Detective' &amp; More |last=Taylor |first=Drew |date=January 8, 2015 |publisher=IndieWire |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/interview-alejandro-gonzalez-inarritu-talks-birdman-the-films-bad-original-ending-critics-true-detective-more-20150108 |accessdate=February 15, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225134600/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/interview-alejandro-gonzalez-inarritu-talks-birdman-the-films-bad-original-ending-critics-true-detective-more-20150108 |archivedate=February 25, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iñárritu approached Brad Weston, president of [[New Regency]], who accepted the offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making of 'Birdman': Alejandro G.

Searchlight and New Regency had previously worked together to finance ''[[12 Years a Slave (film)|12 Years a Slave]]'', and they decided to join together for ''Birdman'', financing a budget of $16.5 million.&lt;ref name="financiers" /&gt;

Weston and Lewis developed a close relationship with Iñárritu, editing the script with him and switching some of the actors. When they joined production, [[Josh Brolin]] was set to play the role of Mike Shiner, but the financiers decided to switch him for Norton because of scheduling conflicts.&lt;ref name="financiers" /&gt;

He said Norton's experience as a theatre actor combined with his self-confidence meant that "in a way there was some kind of mental reality to Edward",&lt;ref name="rappler" /&gt; but Norton believes he was the one who convinced Iñárritu to take him on.

Lubezki was concerned that no film had been shot in the way Iñárritu envisioned, meaning there would be no reference material to look up.

Iñárritu said "There was no room to improvise at all.

{{rquote|left|''I know Alejandro is very adamant about kind of keeping the rabbit in the hat and not being super specific about how it was shot, but I will say it took a lot of rehearsal and it was very specific...

The night-time scenes were possible to film in this way due to the brightness of New York.&lt;ref name="arri" /&gt; Lubezki found lighting the scenes to be the hardest part of his work on the film. Not only did the lighting need to look realistic, but also had to be designed so that the continuous movements of the camera did not project the crew's shadows onto the actors.&lt;ref name="lubezki_int" /&gt;

Throughout shooting, [[Arri Alexa]] cameras were used; an Alexa M was used for handheld sequences, and an Alexa XT was attached to the [[Steadicam]]. Neither used [[mattebox]]es, however. Steadicam operator Chris Haarhoff explained this decision: "We didn't want this big black thing gliding into their eyeline. This way we could get very close and get the light past the lens and onto the actor's face."&lt;ref name="steadcam_int" /&gt; Lubezki{{snd}} who did all the handheld camerawork&lt;ref name="lubezki_int" /&gt;{{snd}} had chosen the Alexa M because the camera was very small and allowed him to get into tiny spaces and close to the actors,&lt;ref name="arri" /&gt; sometimes filming two inches away from Keaton's face.&lt;ref name="desowitz" /&gt; The camera also allowed recording for such a long period{{snd}} necessary for the long takes of the movie{{snd}} that Lubezki went so far as to say the movie would have been impossible to do years before.&lt;ref name="arri" /&gt; The cameras were lensed with [[Leica Camera|Leica]] Summilux-C or [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] Master Primes.&lt;ref name="steadcam_int" /&gt; Lubezki stated that these gave clean images, saying "You can have all these lights in the frame and they are not really causing bad flare or things like that".&lt;ref name="arri" /&gt; In terms of sizes, they initially trialled a 21mm, but this did not give Iñárritu the "intimacy" he wanted. The crew instead went to an 18mm Leica, which was used for the majority of the film. Only when emphasis was needed did they switch the lens to a 14mm, but this was rare.&lt;ref name="steadcam_int" /&gt;

Despite all the preparation, a typical shooting day would begin with rehearsals. These usually lasted most of the morning, after which photography followed.&lt;ref name="MM" /&gt; The meticulous timing for the scenes meant that takes were canceled because of the slightest mishaps. Emma Stone, in an interview with [[Jimmy Fallon]], recalled how a six-minute take of the scene where Riggan first meets Mike was ruined after she walked around a corner too quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Norton Won't Talk to Emma Stone |url=http://www.nbc.com/the-tonight-show/segments/13766 |work=[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]] |publisher=[[NBC]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209064959/http://www.nbc.com/the-tonight-show/segments/13766 |archivedate=February 9, 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Takes were also repeated if a scene's rhythm did not feel right to Iñárritu, or if he and Lubezki were not satisfied with a shot's framing.&lt;ref name="lubezki_int" /&gt; As shooting progressed lines of dialog would also be dropped, giving Iñárritu more options during post-production.&lt;ref name="sd-editors" /&gt; Because of this, the number of takes for a given scene was high, usually twenty for the shorter scenes,&lt;ref name="lubezki_int" /&gt; the takes running smoothly around the fifteenth.&lt;ref name="steadcam_int" /&gt; Chris Haarhoff described it as "a type of dance where everyone would hopefully try to peak all at the same moment." The locations sometimes placed restrictions on the takes too; the live Times Square sequence was shot only twice since they did not want to attract the attention of tourists.&lt;ref name="lubezki_int" /&gt;

Whenever shooting was taking place there was pressure on everyone involved, but the cast had a positive experience. Norton said that normally in movie production half the people can "check out" due to repetitive aspects, but during the shooting of ''Birdman'' "everybody's on, the whole thing, and you're all on pins and needles because you're all relying on forty other people not to drop the ball." Because of this, Stone said the director was able to get the best out of the cast, saying "[Iñárritu's process] creates this sort of fury in you, and then you end up realizing that he just got so much out of you that you didn't even know you had".&lt;ref name="bold" /&gt; Naomi Watts commented that the atmosphere "felt emblematic of how it feels onstage{{snd}}at least my long-time memories from long ago".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alejandro Iñárritu's 'Birdman' is Brainy, Buoyant, Brash, Meta Moviemaking |last=Bailey |first=Jason |date=October 12, 2014 |publisher=Flavorwire |url=http://flavorwire.com/482051/alejandro-inarritus-birdman-is-brainy-buoyant-brash-meta-moviemaking |accessdate= February 4, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209065010/http://flavorwire.com/482051/alejandro-inarritus-birdman-is-brainy-buoyant-brash-meta-moviemaking |archivedate=February 9, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrea Riseborough, meanwhile, described the process as "wonderful", mentioning how it was possible to hear the filming of a sequence from far away before the camera arrived and then "the magic happens with you, and then everything leaves you, and everything's silent".&lt;ref name="atm" /&gt; Once they successfully completed a take though, it was obvious to everybody involved.

===Music and soundtrack===
{{main|Birdman (film score)}}
The film's original music segments are a drum score consisting entirely of solo jazz percussion performances by [[Antonio Sánchez (drummer)|Antonio Sánchez]]. The score is offset by a number of well known classical music pieces, including [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]. Iñárritu did not regard the particular choice of classical pieces as important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Birdman' Score Drummed Out Of Oscars As Academy Rejects Filmmaker's Appeal |last=Hammond |first=Pete |date=December 22, 2014 |website=Deadline Hollywood |url=http://deadline.com/2014/12/birdman-out-oscars-academy-rejects-appeal-1201332029/ |accessdate=February 8, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209065225/http://deadline.com/2014/12/birdman-out-oscars-academy-rejects-appeal-1201332029/ |archivedate=February 9, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the choice of classical music was strongly oriented to highly melodic scores taken predominantly from the 19th century classical repertoire (Mahler, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov, Ravel). Iñárritu stated that the classical components come from the world of the play, citing the radio in Riggan's room and the show itself as two sources of the music.&lt;ref name="tohJan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch: Why Golden Globe Winner Alejandro González Iñárritu Took Risks on 'Birdman' |last=Thompson |first=Anne |date=January 12, 2015 |publisher=Thompson on Hollywood |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/watch-alejandro-gonzalez-inarritu-talks-birdman-at-telluride-exclusive-video-20140901 |accessdate=February 4, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209065238/http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/watch-alejandro-gonzalez-inarritu-talks-birdman-at-telluride-exclusive-video-20140901 |archivedate=February 9, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classical music segments also included two compositions by American composer [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]. Several jazz compositions by [[Victor Hernández Stumpfhauser]] and Joan Valent counterbalance the original music composition by Sánchez. The drum sections comprise the majority of the score however, and were composed by Sánchez. Iñárritu explained the choice by saying they helped to structure scenes, and that "The drums, for me, was a great way to find the rhythm of the film...

When the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] released their longlist for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] in December 2014, ''Birdman'' was absent from the list. The previous day, Sánchez received a note from the award committee explaining the decision, quoting rule fifteen of the 87th Academy Award Rules, noting "the fact that the film also contains over a half an hour of non-original (mostly classical) music cues that are featured very prominently in numerous pivotal moments in the film made it difficult for the committee to accept your submission". Sánchez launched an appeal, and along with Iñárritu and the executive vice-president of [[Fox Music]], they sent letters to Charles Fox, the chair of the Academy's music branch executive committee, asking that the committee reconsider their decision.&lt;ref name="oscar_holly"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Inside Story: Why 'Birdman's' Drum Score Isn't Eligible for an Oscar and Why an Appeal Was Rejected |last=Feinberg |first=Scott |date=December 24, 2014 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/inside-story-why-birdmans-drum-760140 |accessdate=February 4, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209070310/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/inside-story-why-birdmans-drum-760140 |archivedate=February 9, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the points they raised was that the committee incorrectly calculated the ratio of classical to original music, which after being clarified Sánchez thought he was "on really solid ground".&lt;ref name="HF-oscar"&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive: 'Birdman' composer says Oscar DQ doesn't make mathematical sense |last=Patches |first=Matt |date=December 22, 2014 |publisher=HitFix |url=http://www.hitfix.com/in-contention/exclusive-birdman-composer-says-oscar-dq-doesnt-make-mathematical-sense |accessdate=February 4, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209070529/http://www.hitfix.com/in-contention/exclusive-birdman-composer-says-oscar-dq-doesnt-make-mathematical-sense |archivedate=February 9, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A response from Fox on December 19 however, explained that a special meeting of the music committee was held, and although its members had "great respect" for the score and considered it "superb", they thought that the classical music "was also used as scoring", "equally contributes to the effectiveness of the film", and that the musical identity of the film was created by both the drums and classical music. Ultimately, they did not overturn their decision.&lt;ref name="oscar_holly" /&gt; Sánchez said that he and Iñárritu were not satisfied with the explanation.&lt;ref name="HF-oscar" /&gt;

===Post-production and visual effects===
''Birdman'' was edited by [[Douglas Crise]] and [[Stephen Mirrione]], who had both worked with the director before on ''[[21 Grams]]'' and ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]''. Stitching shots together was, of course, a crucial component of the editing, but Crise and Mirrone already had experience doing this. The director had included takes that were joined together in previous films, but in these if the editors didn't think the stitching worked they had the ability to introduce cuts. Mirrone said that in ''Birdman'' Iñárritu had "let go of that safety net".&lt;ref name="credits2" /&gt; Because of this the editors needed to be involved in the project early on,&lt;ref name="credits1" /&gt; and during principal photography Crise was on set every day. (Mirrone was busy and unable to be in New York.)&lt;ref name="sd-editors" /&gt; Crise was not used to being on set and providing feedback, but said he was happy Iñárritu "dragged it out" of him, knowing that they wouldn't have much room to fix scenes later so they needed to get them right.&lt;ref name="sd-editors" /&gt; For stitching, aside from the director, Crise also discussed strategies with Lubezki and Thompson, and techniques for gluing takes together included panning on walls and actors' bodies.&lt;ref name="deadline-editing"&gt;{{cite web |title=A Fine Frenzy |last=Bowles |first=Scott |date=October 31, 2014 |website=Deadline Hollywood |url=https://deadline.com/2014/10/editing-duo-behind-birdman-had-their-work-cut-out-for-them-864571/ |accessdate=July 5, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705130643/https://deadline.com/2014/10/editing-duo-behind-birdman-had-their-work-cut-out-for-them-864571/ |archivedate=July 5, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editors were used to being able to adjust the rhythm of a scene by the positioning of cuts, so without this tool used Sánchez's music instead. The director gave the New York recordings to Crise early on to help with pacing, asking him to cut the music to the film. Still, in terms of the editing workflow, Crise described it as "pretty traditional". The editors cut the film together back in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="sd-editors" /&gt; A few weeks after shooting they were quite far along the cut itself, and transitioned into visual-effects mode, where they fine-tuned the shots.&lt;ref name="MM" /&gt;

The visual effects for the film were created by Montreal studio [[Rodeo FX]]. They spent four months working on the film,&lt;ref name="yvr"&gt;{{cite web |title=VFX: Rodeo FX at SPARK 2015 on Invisible VFX Behind BIRDMAN's One Continuous Shot |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=February 8, 2015 |publisher=yvrshoots |url=http://yvrshoots.com/2015/02/vfx-rodeo-fx-at-spark-2015-on-invisible-vfx-behind-birdmans-one-continuous-shot.html |accessdate=July 5, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705132728/http://yvrshoots.com/2015/02/vfx-rodeo-fx-at-spark-2015-on-invisible-vfx-behind-birdmans-one-continuous-shot.html |archivedate=July 5, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to visual effects supervisor Ara Khanikian "visual effects touched 90% of the frames in the movie".&lt;ref name="fxguide"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rodeo helps Birdman soar with invisible fx |last=Failes |first=Ian |date=October 28, 2014 |publisher=fxguide |url=http://www.fxguide.com/featured/rodeo-helps-birdman-soar-with-invisible-fx/ |accessdate=July 5, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705132512/http://www.fxguide.com/featured/rodeo-helps-birdman-soar-with-invisible-fx/ |archivedate=July 5, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lot of the work was subtle. For example, stitching shots together, or creating the background for the windows in the hospital scene.&lt;ref name="fxguide" /&gt; Many shots in the film feature mirrors, and much work was spent removing the reflections of the crew from these. To accomplish this the studio created a 2.5D [[Matte painting|digital matte painting]] of the reflected environment. They then [[rotoscoped]] out the parts of the mirror not containing the foreground actors and their reflections, and replaced these with the digital environment.&lt;ref name="fxguide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="btl-fx"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Use of VFX to Stitch Birdman Together |last=Fotheringham |first=Scott |date=February 2, 2015 |publisher=Below the Line |url=http://www.btlnews.com/awards/the-use-of-vfx-to-stitch-birdman-together/ |accessdate=July 5, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705132921/http://www.btlnews.com/awards/the-use-of-vfx-to-stitch-birdman-together/ |archivedate=July 5, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the original shots captured smudges and dirt on the mirrors, so the studio developed a way to extract them so they could paste them back into the film. A matte-painting was constructed for the night-day time lapses in the film too, created by [[matchmoving]] and reprojecting shots of the buildings it features, captured at different times of the day, together.&lt;ref name="fxguide" /&gt; Rodeo FX also adjusted the pace of scenes. Iñárritu demanded a "very precise rhythm and flow" to the film, so the studio had to re-speed much of it with timewarp curves to fit the pacing the director desired.&lt;ref name="fxguide" /&gt;

Unlike some of the smaller adjustments though, the flying sequence required extensive preparation. Iñárritu spent three weeks with Halon Entertainment to [[Previsualization|previsualize]] the sequence.&lt;ref name="halon"&gt;{{cite web |title=Birdman |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher=Halon Entertainment |url=http://www.halon.com/web/our-work/birdman/ |accessdate=July 5, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705132932/http://www.halon.com/web/our-work/birdman/ |archivedate=July 5, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York, Lubezki then used the choreography of the previsualization to shoot background plates for the sequence,&lt;ref name="fxguide" /&gt; using a camera crane on a truck.&lt;ref name="yvr" /&gt; When these were shot, Lubezki had mounted four [[GoPro]] cameras to the lens of the film camera to capture the light environment around him. Later, on a greenstage in Montreal, using a technique he had developed on Gravity, Lubezki lit Keaton with LED panels featuring [[high-dynamic-range images]] of the surrounding New York footage. The panels then realistically lit Keaton. Khanikian described the effect of the process, saying "instead of using standard lighting on greenscreen [we were getting] the proper red bounce from the red bricks and the same color of the sky reflected on Michael's head. It worked so well." Rodeo FX then completed the final shots.&lt;ref name="fxguide" /&gt; The sequence was the last piece the editors inserted into the film. Mirrone commented that before the sequence was finished they "had only imagined what it was going to feel like", but once it was completed "it took the movie to this ecstatic level that absolutely blew me away."&lt;ref name="sd-editors" /&gt;

Sound design for the film was handled by Martín Hernández, who has worked on all the director's feature films. The production sound his team was given was "surprisingly perfect and clean", so they didn't need to spend much time tidying it.&lt;ref name="btl-sound"&gt;{{cite web |title=Contender - Sound Editor Martin Hernandez, Birdman |last=Skweres |first=Mary Ann |date=December 29, 2014 |publisher=Below the Line |url=http://www.btlnews.com/awards/contender-sound-editor-martin-hernandez-birdman/ |accessdate=July 5, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705133127/http://www.btlnews.com/awards/contender-sound-editor-martin-hernandez-birdman/ |archivedate=July 5, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of visual cuts in the film meant a departure from the usual way Hernández edited sound though. "Normally Alejandro likes, as he calls it, 'the clashing of the sounds.' The camera changes angle within the scene and there is a change of everything{{snd}} backgrounds, texture, dialog. Obviously, that would not work on ''Birdman'' because here, everything is flowing."&lt;ref name="btl-sound" /&gt; Additionally, the sound of objects in the film needed to be coordinated with their position onscreen, a non-trivial task since the camera was nearly always moving.&lt;ref name="btl-sound" /&gt; Hernández also helped to cut Sánchez's tracks, selecting and editing moments from the New York recordings against the film.&lt;ref name="morelia"&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview with Martín Hernández, 2015 Oscar Nominee |last=Alemán |first=Cristina |date=February 3, 2015 |publisher=Festival Internacional del Cine en Morelia |url=http://moreliafilmfest.com/en/como-suena-el-entorno-entrevista-a-martin-hernandez/ |accessdate=July 5, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705133140/http://moreliafilmfest.com/en/como-suena-el-entorno-entrevista-a-martin-hernandez/ |archivedate=July 5, 2015 |deadurl=no
}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the tracks were re-recording in Los Angeles, in order "to have distance, and closeness and resonance" the team used thirty two microphones for each take. Hernández described the job as "crazy".&lt;ref name="btl-sound" /&gt; A large challenge of the post-production soundwork was designing the sound of the theatre audience, particularly in the scene when Mike is drunk and comes out of character. Iñárritu knew how he wanted the audience to respond, but figuring out the sound of their reaction took four months of work from five sound designers.&lt;ref name="morelia" /&gt; Hernández said he thought, for a film in general, that the narrative created by sound "provokes more 'explosions'" than that created by images, and that in ''Birdman'' "Alejandro has sound exploding all throughout the film."&lt;ref name="morelia" /&gt;

The [[digital intermediate]] was completed by a team at [[Technicolor SA|Technicolor]] led by Steven Scott. They had previously collaborated with Lubezki on ''[[Gravity (film)|Gravity]]'',&lt;ref name="tnclr-BM_page"&gt;{{cite web |title=Birdman |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=October 22, 2014 |publisher=[[Technicolor SA|Technicolor]] |url=http://www.technicolor.com/en/who-we-are/press-news-center/news/birdman |accessdate=July 5, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705130754/http://www.technicolor.com/en/who-we-are/press-news-center/news/birdman |archivedate=July 5, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; but needed to approach ''Birdman'' differently because of the continuous-shot approach. According to Scott, "we have never done anything like it before."&lt;ref name="Scott-int"&gt;{{cite AV media |title=The Seamless Look of 'Birdman' |people=Gray, Tim (Host) |date=November 4, 2014 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxXWs74dKnE |accessdate=July 5, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705131521/https://variety.com/video/the-seamless-look-of-birdman/ |archivedate=July 5, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[color timing]] had to be done in such a way that the transitions between color-corrected environments were invisible, in contrast to a usual film where the transitions coincide with visible cuts. To do this, the team inserted their own cuts whenever the camera was stationary, and in the middle of pans and other camera movements. They then devised a way to color correct the stationary cuts and turn the moving cuts into a form of dissolve, allowing them to "do all these independent, crazy, complicated, color corrections that would flow organically from one to another." Inserting the dissolves required [[rotoscoping]] methods which the software Scott and his team were using did not have, but an enterprise agreement between Technicolor and the software's developer led to the creation of a tool Scott required. For the color timing itself, one of the priorities of the team was making the faces as dimensional and readable as possible. This required, amongst other things, that faces be highlighted, but the moving camerawork meant that the [[Matte (filmmaking)|mattes]] used in this process had to be animated by hand. Lubezki would provide notes on the areas he wanted tracked, then the team would carry out the animations. Of the whole process, Iñárritu remarked that "everyone was out of their comfort zone", while Scott said it was the most challenging DI project of his career.&lt;ref name="tnclr-pdf"&gt;{{cite report |title=Birdman - Case Study |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2015 |publisher=technicolor |url=http://www.technicolor.com/download/file/fid/7518?file=20150213_birdman_case_study_v3.pdf |accessdate=July 5, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705131954/http://www.technicolor.com/download/file/fid/7518?file=20150213_birdman_case_study_v3.pdf |archivedate=July 5, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A short list of the diverse forms of film genre associated with the film has included it being referred to alternatively as a black-humor film, a mental health film, a realism/surrealism/[[magical realism]] film, a dark-humor parody film, a film of psychological realism, a failed domestic reconciliation drama, or a film concerning theatrical realism and naturalism.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separate reviews in the press have also summarized the film as closely associated with the theme of the final tailspin of a late mid-life crisis in the life of a has-been actor seeking closure and resolution in his public and private life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Richard |last=Lawson |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/2014/10/birdman-review |title=Michael Keaton Struggles to Re-Invent Himself in Birdman |work=Vanity Fair |date=September 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The father-daughter themes in the film, portrayed through the relationship of Riggan and Samantha, were the "most difficult" and important parts of the film to depict for co-writers Dinelaris and Giacobone, as they both had similar experiences within their families involving their own relationships with their daughters. When the writers were asked about the meaning of the ambiguous ending which the director was refusing to comment upon, they stated that any comedic ending was completely ruled out. The writers also stated that reflections about the conclusion to the film were not directly concentrated upon Riggan or the character of Birdman as much as upon the lives of the surviving characters portrayed in the film, in particular the portrayal of Riggan's daughter Samantha, rather than upon the character of Riggan himself.&lt;ref&gt;

Noting the thematic pull between Riggan's insanity or actual superpowers, Travis LaCouter of ''[[First Things]]'' writes that "the importance of these powers{{snd}} real or imagined{{snd}} is apparent: They are for Riggan the thing beyond the labels, the kernel of his genius and, because he sees drawing upon them as selling out, the source of his great angst." LaCouter concludes that "the quirky profundity of this film is in how it dares the viewer to consider the everyday magic that we tend to ignore, repress, or resent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=LaCouter|first1=Travis|title=Birdman's Sly Metaphysics|url=http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2014/11/birdmans-sly-metaphysics|work=First Things|accessdate=September 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics Barbara Schweizerhof and Matthew Pejkovici see the film's central theme as a satirical critique of contemporary theatrical realism, with Pejkovici laudably comparing it to Fellini's film ''[[8½]]'' (1963). As Pejkovici states: "Much like Fellini's 1960[sic] classic ''[[8½]]'', Iñárritu's ''Birdman'' is a very intimate film about an artist's malaise, yet is epic, innovative, and ambitious in approach. Iñárritu captures the artist's battle between ambition, admiration and celebrity with stunning scope and skill in the form of a one take format, as his camera sweeps through the backstage corridors, across the stage, out on the busy NYC streets, and back again in breathtaking fashion."&lt;ref&gt;

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on 322 reviews, and an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average rating]] of 8.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "A thrilling leap forward for director Alejandro González Iñárritu, ''Birdman'' is an ambitious technical showcase powered by a layered story and outstanding performances from Michael Keaton and Edward Norton."&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE.

Writing for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[Richard Brody]] called the film "Godardian", comparing it to ''[[Pierrot le Fou]]'' (1965), ''[[Every Man for Himself (1980 film)|Every Man for Himself]]'' (1980), ''[[Alphaville (film)|Alphaville]]'' (1965), and ''[[Germany Year 90 Nine Zero]]'' (1991), four classic films by French director [[Jean-Luc Godard]].&lt;ref name="newyorkerrichard"&gt;{{cite web |first=Richard |last=Brody |url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/birdman-never-achieves-flight |title='Birdman' Never Achieves Flight |work=The New Yorker |date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he suggested the film fell short of reaching the same cinematic mastery, adding, "it's not a good idea for a filmmaker to get in the ring with Mr. Godard".&lt;ref name="newyorkerrichard" /&gt; Thematically, he also compared it to ''[[Opening Night (1977 film)|Opening Night]]'' (1977) by [[John Cassavetes]].&lt;ref name="newyorkerrichard" /&gt; Brody said that the actors played in "the sort of modern naturalism, without eccentricity of gesture, excess of expression, or heightened and formalistic precision, that is the business-casual of contemporary cinema."&lt;ref name="newyorkerrichard" /&gt; In his critical comments on the film, he concluded that the film "trade[d] on facile, casual dichotomies of theatre versus cinema and art versus commerce" and "deliver[ed] a work of utterly familiar and unoriginal drama".&lt;ref name="newyorkerrichard" /&gt;

In a review in ''The New Yorker'' separately supplementing the review by Brody, Anthony Lane rejected the film's suggestion that film critics are out to destroy films, explaining, "Someone could have told Iñárritu that critics, though often mean, are not preemptively so, and that anybody who'd say, as Tabitha does, 'I'm going to destroy your play,' before actually seeing it, would not stay long in the job."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Anthony |last=Lane |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/20/high-fliers-3 |title=High Fliers |work=The New Yorker |date=October 20, 2014 |accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The New York Times]]'', Manohla Dargis compared the main character to [[Icarus]],&lt;ref name="nytimesmanohla"&gt;{{cite news |first=Manohla |last=Dargis |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/movies/birdman-stars-michael-keaton-and-emma-stone.html|title=Former Screen Star, Molting on Broadway |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Greek mythological figure who crashed to his death after flying too close to the sun. She also noted a reference to [[Susan Sontag]]'s ''[[Against Interpretation]]'' in the dressing-room mirror.&lt;ref name="nytimesmanohla" /&gt;

[[Richard Kolker]] compared the film to both [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948) and [[Alexander Sokurov]]'s ''[[Russian Ark]]'' (2002). Kolker conclude that ''Birdman'' is "a film about acting, identity, transformation, and the mysterious effects of superheroes, (and) is filmed to create the illusion of being made in one continuous take. As with ''Rope'', the edits are hidden and the result is a rhythmic slide through the life of an actor in search of his self, a search doomed from the start."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Birdman (2014)| publisher=Matt's Movie Reviews| url=http://www.mattsmoviereviews.net/moviecritic-reviews/birdman.html| accessdate=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International reception of the film was also at a high level of praise. In Germany, a film aggregate rating at EPD Film gave the film a 3.4 out of 5 rating based on seven critiques. The German critic Barbara Schweizerhof gave the film a 4 out of 5 possible stars complimenting the director's satirical virtuosity in making the film. In her review, Schweizerhof spoke of the film as inviting the viewer to re-watch it "a second and third time", and praised the technical achievement of representing a storyline depicting "the feverish stream of consciousness" of its main character throughout the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Schweizerhof| first=Elizabeth| title=Kritik zu Birdman (oder die unverhoffte Macht der Ahnungslosigkeit)| publisher=EPD Film| date=January 15, 2015| url=http://www.epd-film.de/filmkritiken/birdman-oder-die-unverhoffte-macht-der-ahnungslosigkeit| accessdate=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The camerawork, which depicts most of the film as one continuous take, was met with extensive acclaim for its execution and usage. The acting was widely praised, particularly Keaton's,&lt;ref name="roeper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardroeper.com/reviews/birdman.aspx|title=Birdman (2014; Rated R)|publisher=Richard Roeper &amp; The Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lemire"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/birdman-2014 | title=Birdman | date=October 17, 2014 | first=Christy| last=Lemire | publisher=RogerEbert.com | quote=Zach Galifianakis plays strongly against type}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Peter Debruge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' calling the performance the "comeback of the century."&lt;ref name="Debruge"&gt;{{cite web | date=August 27, 2014 | first=Peter| last=Debruge | title=Michael Keaton pulls off a startling comeback in Alejandro G.

[[Margaret Pomeranz]] and [[David Stratton]] from ''[[At the Movies (Australian TV series)|At the Movies]]'' praised the film's writing, direction, performances and cinematography. Stratton also described the implementation of the percussion score as "really exciting", while Pomeranz summarised "it's just really beautifully written and stunningly performed and beautifully made." The pair both gave the film five stars, making ''Birdman'' the only film to receive such a rating from the hosts in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Finale : Male Oscar Contenders Films 2014 |work=[[At the Movies (Australian TV series)|At the Movies]] |date=December 9, 2014 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] |url=http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/txt/s4142257.htm |accessdate=February 26, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226024817/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/txt/s4142257.htm |archivedate=February 26, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Movie Reviews |work=At the Movies |year=2014 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] |url=http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/review/ |accessdate=February 26, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226025518/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/review/ |archivedate=February 26, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics, however, provided negative reviews. Reviewing it for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Richard Lawson called the film "hoary" and "deceptively simple".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Richard |last=Lawson |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/2014/10/birdman-review |title=Michael Keaton Struggles to Re-Invent Himself in Birdman |work=Vanity Fair |date=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Tobias, writing for [[The Dissolve]], gave the film 1.5 stars. He commends Lubezki's cinematography as succeeding at "trapping viewers in a pressure-cooker atmosphere as Riggan and his players struggle to keep it together", but suggests that Iñárritu is "incapable of modulation" and that there exists "a sourness to ''Birdman'' that Iñárritu can't turn into wit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Tobias |url=https://thedissolve.com/reviews/1152-birdman/ |title=''Birdman'' |publisher=The Dissolve |date=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Swedish National Parks}}
'''Blå Jungfrun''', also known as  "'''Blåkulla'''", in English sometimes rendered literally as '''The Blue Maiden'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frommers.com/destinations/oland/side-trips&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] island in the [[Baltic Sea]]. It is situated in the [[Kalmar Strait]], between the mainland province of [[Småland]] and the island province of [[Öland]]. Administratively, the uninhabited island is part of the municipality of [[Oskarshamn]] and covers an area of approximately {{convert|0.7|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} with a mean height above sea level of {{convert|86|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Home to [[black guillemot]]s and a [[List of national parks of Sweden|Swedish National Park]] since 1926, [[freedom to roam]] at Blå Jungfrun is limited with visitors prohibited from staying overnight on the island or making fires.

The island consists partly of bare rock with the remainder covered in dense hardwood forest. There are several caves and an ancient stone [[labyrinth]] from which it is forbidden to remove stones.

Geologically the island is an ancient [[inselberg]] rising from the [[Sub-Cambrian peneplain]]. After its formation in the [[Precambrian]] time Blå Jungfrun was buried in sandstone being shielded for erosion. It was freed from its sandstone cover in [[deep time|geologically recent]] times.&lt;ref name=Naten&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyklopedi/l%C3%A5ng/inselberg |title=Inselberg |last=Lidmar-Bergström |first=Karna |author-link=Karna Lidmar-Bergström |date= |website=[[Nationalencyklopedin]] |publisher=Cydonia Development |access-date=June 22, 2015 |quote= |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legends ==
[[File:Labyrinth-at-bla-jungfrun.JPG|thumb|left|Detail of the stone labyrinth on Blå Jungfrun.]]
The island plays an important role in Swedish [[folklore]], where it is viewed as an evil and magical place. The name Blå Jungfrun was originally used by sailors to avoid provoking the evil spirits who dwelt on the island. According to a widespread belief, related already by [[Olaus Magnus]] in 1555, [[Witchcraft|witches]] meet there each [[Maundy Thursday]]. [[Carl Linnaeus]], who visited the island in 1741, was sceptical:
 
''Women and fairy-tales ... generally say that all witches will go here (truly a rather difficult journey) each Maundy Thursday; but those who have visited the place once are not likely to return, and should find out the reason for the fable: If any place in the world looks hideous, this is surely one of the most cruel.''

The many water polished stones on the beaches of Blå Jungfrun are illegal to remove from the island because of its national park status. And according to tradition, anyone who steals a stone from the island will suffer from bad luck until it is returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ḎḤWTY|title=Blå Jungfrun Island, Sweden: Where Witches Dwell and Labyrinths Confuse|url=http://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-places-europe/bl-jungfrun-island-sweden-witches-dwell-and-labyrinths-confuse-009779|website=Ancient Origins|accessdate=21 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town of Oskarshamn yearly receives stones from former Blå Jungfrun visitors, often with an accompanying letter describing misfortunes and disasters which happened to the letter writers after removing them. In May 2004, over 160 such stones were publicly brought back to the island on a ferry from Oskarshamn.&lt;ref&gt;"Curse of the Stones", [[Fortean Times]] #219, February 2007, pp 44-48&lt;/ref&gt;

== Park establishment and tourism ==
Between 1904 and 1925 the red [[granite]] of Blå Jungfrun was extracted in three [[Quarry|quarries]] on the south of the island. It was exported chiefly to Germany as decorative stone. The destruction led to efforts to protect the island. A donation from the Swedish entrepreneur [[Torsten Kreuger]] made it possible to acquire the island and stop the quarrying. The national park was established on February{{nbsp}}5, 1926 by the [[Government of Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lansstyrelsen.se/kalmar/SiteCollectionDocuments/Sv/djur-och-natur/skyddad-natur/nationalparker/bla-junfrun-eng-uppladdningsbar.pdf Länsstyrelsen Kalmar - Blå Jungfrun.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207194627/http://www.lansstyrelsen.se/kalmar/SiteCollectionDocuments/Sv/djur-och-natur/skyddad-natur/nationalparker/bla-junfrun-eng-uppladdningsbar.pdf |date=February 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer, the island can be visited by tour boats from [[Oskarshamn]] or from Byxelkrok.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solkustturer.se/index.php/en/bla-jungfrun Solkustturer Boat to Blå Jungfrun]&lt;/ref&gt; Regular trips began in the 1950s. A park guide on Blå Jungfrun informs the visitors about the national park and its regulations. The visit on the island lasts for about 3,5 hours.

'''CAN SLIM''' refers to the acronym developed by the American stock research and education company ''[[Investor's Business Daily]]'' (''IBD''). ''IBD'' claims CANSLIM represents the seven characteristics that top-performing [[stock market|stocks]] often share before making their biggest price gains. It was developed in the 1950s by Investor's Business Daily founder [[William O'Neil]].&lt;ref name="IBD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/|title=CAN SLIM|publisher=Investor's Business Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method was named the top-performing investment strategy from 1998-2009 by the [[American Association of Individual Investors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investor-education/forget-buy-low-and-sell-high-says-william-oneil/article4306617/|title=Forget Buy Low and Sell High, Says William O'Neil|first=Noreen |last=Rasbach|date=February 18, 2010 |access-date=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://financialhighway.com/what-is-canslim-stock-investing/|title=What Is CANSLIM Stock Investing?|first=Darnell |last=Brown|publisher=Financial Highway|access-date=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, an [[Exchange-traded fund|exchange-traded fund]] (ETF) was launched focusing on the companies listed on the IBD 50, a computer generated list published by Investors Business Daily that highlights stocks based on the CAN SLIM investment criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/trangho/2015/06/24/new-etf-rides-on-legendary-investor-william-oneils-stock-picking-strategy/#2f252e3e730b|title=New ETF Rides On Legendary Investor William O'Neil's Stock Picking Strategy|first=Ky |last=Trang Ho|date=June 24, 2015|access-date=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investing mechanism and process==
CAN SLIM is a [[growth stock]] investing strategy formulated from a study of stock market winners dating back to 1953 in the book  ''How to Make Money in Stocks: A Winning System In Good Times or Bad''.&lt;ref name= forbes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/02/23/oneil-ibd-canslim-personal-finance_william_oneil.html|title=Breaking Out With Bill O'Neil|first=John |last=Dobosz|publisher=Forbes|date=February 23, 2009|access-date=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy involves implementation of both [[technical analysis]] and [[fundamental analysis]].

The objective of the strategy is to discover leading stocks before they make major price advances. These pre-advance periods are "buy points" for stocks as they emerge from price consolidation areas (or "bases"), most often in the form of a "cup-with-handle" chart pattern, of at least 7 weeks on weekly price charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/instablog/8701801-the-tenacious-trader/1747651-can-slim-a-snipers-approach-to-investing-in-stocks|title=CAN SLIM: A Snipers Approach To Investing In Stocks|publisher=Seeking Alpha|date=April 12, 2013|access-date=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strategy is one that strongly encourages cutting all losses at no more than 7% or 8% below the buy point, with no exceptions, to minimize losses and to preserve gains.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; It is stated in the book, that buying stocks of solid companies should generally lessen chances of having to cut losses, since a strong company (good current quarterly earnings-per-share growth, annual growth rate, and other strong fundamentals) will usually shoot up&amp;mdash;in bull markets&amp;mdash;rather than descend. Some investors have criticized the strategy when they didn't use the stop-loss criterion; O'Neil has replied that you have to use the whole strategy and not just the parts you like.&lt;ref name=businsider/&gt;

O'Neil has stated that the CANSLIM strategy is not [[momentum investing]], but that the system identifies companies with strong fundamentals&amp;mdash;big sales and earnings increases which is a result of unique new products or services&amp;mdash;and encourages buying their stock when they emerge from price consolidation periods (or "bases") and before they advance dramatically in price.&lt;ref name=businsider&gt;{{cite web|title=How does CAN SLIM Investing Work?|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-does-can-slim-investing-work-2011-5|website=Business Insider|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acronym==

The seven parts of the acronym are as follows:&lt;ref name="IBD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/mar/05/magazine/tm-oneil10/2|title=The Profiting Prophet of Playa del Rey|first=Thomas |last=Kostigen|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=March 5, 2006|access-date=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''C''' stands for '''Current quarterly earnings'''. Per share, current earnings should be up at least 25% in the most recent financial quarter, compared to the same quarter the previous year. Additionally, if earnings are accelerating in recent quarters, this is a positive prognostic sign.
* '''A''' stands for '''Annual earnings growth''', which should be up 25% or more over the last three years. Annual returns on equity should be 17% or more
* '''N''' stands for '''New product or service''', which refers to the idea that a company should have continuing development and innovation. This is what allows the stock to emerge from a proper chart pattern and achieve a new price.  A notable example of this is [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iPhone]].
* '''S''' stands for '''Supply and demand'''. A gauge of a stock's demand can be seen in the [[stock market|trading volume]] of the stock, particularly during price increases.
* '''L''' stands for '''Leader or laggard?''' O'Neil suggests buying "the leading stock in a leading industry." This somewhat qualitative measurement can be more objectively measured by the '''Relative Price Strength Rating''' of the stock, designed to measure the price performance of a  [[stock]] over the past 12 months in comparison to the rest of the market based on the [[S&amp;P 500]] (or the [[S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index]] for Canadian stock listings) over a set period of time.
* '''I''' stands for '''Institutional sponsorship''', which refers to the ownership of the stock by mutual funds, banks and other large institutions, particularly in recent quarters. A quantitative measure here is the Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which is a gauge of institutional activity in a particular stock.
* '''M''' stands for '''Market Direction''', which is categorized into three - Market in Confirmed Uptrend, Market Uptrend Under Pressure, and Market in Correction. The [[S&amp;P 500]] and [[NASDAQ Composite|NASDAQ]] are studied to determine the market direction. During the time of investment, O'Neil prefers investing during times of definite uptrends of these indexes, as three out of four stocks tend to follow the general market direction.

A number of authors have carried out comparisons of [[Nazism]] and [[Stalinism]], in which they have considered the similarities and differences of the two ideologies and [[political systems]], what relationship existed between the two regimes, and why both of them came to prominence at the same time. During the 20th century, the comparison of [[Stalinism]] and [[Nazism]] was made on the topics of [[totalitarianism]], ideology, and [[personality cult]]. Both regimes were seen in contrast to the liberal West, with an emphasis on the similarities between the two.&lt;ref name="Geyer2"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[political scientist]]s [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Carl Friedrich]] and historian [[Robert Conquest]] were prominent advocates of applying the "totalitarian" concept to compare Nazism and Stalinism.&lt;ref&gt;Geyer, pp.&amp;nbsp;4–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reflections2"&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Conquest|title=Reflections on a Ravaged Century|date=1999|isbn=0-393-04818-7|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hannah arendt-150x150.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hannah Arendt]] was one of the first scholars to propose that the regimes of Hitler and Stalin could be grouped in the same political category.]]
===The origins of totalitarianism===
One of the first scholars to publish a comparative study of Nazi Germany and Stalin’s Soviet Union was [[Hannah Arendt]]. In her 1951 work, ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', Arendt puts forward the idea of [[totalitarianism]] as a distinct type of political movement and form of government, which “differs essentially from other forms of political oppression known to us such as despotism, tyranny and dictatorship.” &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 460&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Arendt distinguishes between a totalitarian movement (such as a political party with totalitarian aims) and a totalitarian government. Not all totalitarian movements succeed in creating totalitarian governments once they gain power. In Arendt’s view, although many totalitarian movements existed in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s, only the governments of Stalin and Hitler succeeded in fully implementing their totalitarian aims.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; 

Arendt traced the origin of totalitarian movements to the nineteenth century, focusing especially on [[antisemitism]] and [[New Imperialism|imperialism]]. She emphasized the connection between the rise of European [[nation-state]]s and the growth of antisemitism, which was due to the fact that the Jews represented an “inter-European, non-national element in a world of growing or existing nations.” &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theories]] abounded, and the Jews were accused of being part of various international schemes to ruin European nations.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Small antisemitic political parties formed in response to this perceived Jewish threat, and, according to Arendt, these were the first political organizations in Europe that claimed to represent the interests of the whole nation as opposed to the interests of a class or other social group.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; The later totalitarian movements would copy or inherit this claim to speak for the whole nation, with the implication that any opposition to them constituted treason.

European [[New Imperialism|imperialism of the nineteenth century]] also paved the way for totalitarianism, by legitimizing the concept of endless expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; After Europeans had engaged in imperialist expansion on other continents, political movements developed which aimed to copy the methods of imperialism on the European continent itself. Arendt refers specifically to the “[[Pan-nationalism|pan-movements]]” of [[pan-Germanism]] and [[pan-Slavism]], which promised continental empires to nations that had little hope of overseas expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; According to Arendt, “Nazism and Bolshevism owe more to Pan-Germanism and Pan-Slavism (respectively) than to any other ideology or political movement.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recruitment, propaganda and indoctrination===
Arendt argues that both the Nazi and Bolshevik movements “recruited their members from [a] mass of apparently indifferent people whom all other parties had given up,”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; and who “had reason to be equally hostile to all parties.” &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, totalitarian movements did not need to use debate or persuasion, and did not need to refute the arguments of the other parties. Their target audience did not have to be persuaded to despise the other parties or the democratic system, because it consisted of people who already despised mainstream politics. As a result, totalitarian movements were free to use violence and terror against their opponents without fear that this might alienate their own supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of arguing against their opponents, they adopted [[determinism|deterministic]] views of human behavior and presented opposing ideas as “originating in deep natural, social, or psychological sources beyond the control of the individual and therefore beyond the power of reason.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis in particular, during the years before their rise to power, engaged in “killing small socialist functionaries or influential members of opposing parties” both as a means to intimidate opponents and as a means of demonstrating to their supporters that they were a party of action, “different from the ‘idle talkers’ of other parties.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

Totalitarian governments make extensive use of propaganda, and are often characterized by having a strong distinction between what they tell their own supporters and the propaganda they produce for others. &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; Arendt distinguishes these two categories as "indoctrination" and "propaganda". Indoctrination consists of the message that a totalitarian government promotes internally, to the members of the ruling party and that segment of the population which supports the government. Propaganda consists of the message that a totalitarian government seeks to promote in the outside world, and also among those parts of its own society which may not support the government. &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, “the necessities for propaganda are always dictated by the outside world,” while the opportunities for indoctrination depend on “the totalitarian governments’ isolation and security from outside interference.” &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

The type of indoctrination used by the Soviets and the Nazis was characterized by claims of “scientific” truth, and appeals to “objective laws of nature.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; Both movements took a [[determinism|deterministic]] view of human society and claimed that their ideologies were based on scientific discoveries regarding race (in the case of the Nazis) or the forces governing human history (in the case of the Soviets). Arendt identifies this as being in certain ways similar to modern [[advertising]], in which companies claim that scientific research shows their products to be superior, but more generally she argues that it is an extreme version of “that obsession with science which has characterized the Western world since the rise of mathematics and physics in the sixteenth century.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; By their use of [[pseudoscience]] as the main justification for their actions, Nazism and Stalinism are distinguished from earlier historical despotic regimes, who appealed instead to [[religion]] or sometimes did not try to justify themselves at all. According to Arendt, totalitarian governments did not merely use these appeals to supposed scientific laws as propaganda to manipulate others. Rather, totalitarian leaders like Hitler and Stalin genuinely believed that they were acting in accordance with immutable natural laws, to such an extent that they were willing to sacrifice the self-interest of their regimes for the sake of enacting those supposed laws.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the Nazis treated the inhabitants of occupied territories with extreme brutality and planned to depopulate Eastern Europe in order to make way for colonists from the German “[[herrenvolk|master race]],” despite the fact that this actively harmed their war effort.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 415&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin repeatedly [[Purges of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|purged the Communist Party]] of people who deviated even slightly from the party line, even when this weakened the party or the Soviet government, because he believed that they represented the interests of “dying classes” and their demise was historically inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Leader===
Arendt also identifies the central importance of an all-powerful leader in totalitarian movements. &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; As in other areas, she distinguishes between totalitarian leaders (such as Hitler and Stalin) and non-totalitarian dictators or autocratic leaders. The totalitarian leader does not rise to power by personally using violence or through any special organizational skills, but rather by controlling appointments of personnel within the party, so that all other prominent party members owe their positions to him.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 380&lt;/ref&gt; With loyalty to the leader becoming the primary criterion for promotion, ambitious party members compete with each other in trying to express their loyalty, and a [[cult of personality]] develops around the leader. Even when the leader is not particularly competent and the members of his inner circle are aware of his deficiencies, they remain committed to him out of fear that without him the entire power structure would collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 380&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "enemies"===
Once in power, according to Arendt, totalitarian movements face a major dilemma: they built their support on the basis of anger against the status quo and on impossible or dishonest promises, but now they have become the new status quo and are expected to carry out their promises.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 392&lt;/ref&gt; They deal with this problem by engaging in a constant struggle against external and internal enemies, real or imagined, so as to enable them to say that, in a sense, they have not yet gained the power they need to fulfill their promises. According to Arendt, totalitarian governments must be constantly fighting enemies in order to survive. This explains their apparently irrational behavior, for example when Hitler continued to make territorial demands even after he was offered everything he asked for in the [[Munich Agreement]], or when Stalin unleashed the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] despite the fact that he faced no significant internal opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concentration camps===
Arendt points out the widespread use of [[concentration camp]]s by totalitarian governments, arguing that they are the most important manifestation of the need to find enemies to fight against, and are therefore “more essential to the preservation of the regime’s power than any of its other institutions.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; Although forced labor was commonly imposed on inmates of concentration camps, Arendt argues that their primary purpose was not any kind of material gain for the regime: “The only permanent economic function of the camps has been the financing of their own supervisory apparatus; thus from the economic point of view the concentration camps exist mostly for their own sake.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 444&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis in particular carried this to the point of “open anti-utility,” by expending large sums of money, resources and manpower – during a war – for the purpose of building and staffing [[extermination camps]] and transporting people to them.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; This sets apart the concentration camps of totalitarian regimes from older human institutions that bear some similarity to them, such as [[slavery]].  Slaves were abused and killed for the sake of profit; concentration camp inmates were abused and killed because a totalitarian government needed to justify its existence.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 444&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Arendt points out that concentration camps under both Hitler and Stalin included large numbers of inmates who were innocent of any crime – not only in the ordinary sense of the word, but even by the standards of the regimes themselves. That is to say, most of the inmates had not actually committed any action against the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 451&lt;/ref&gt;

===The future of totalitarian systems===
Throughout her analysis, Arendt emphasized the modernity and novelty of the governmental structures set up by Stalin and Hitler, arguing that they represented “an entirely new form of government” which is likely to manifest itself again in various other forms in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 478&lt;/ref&gt; She also cautioned against the belief that future totalitarian movements would necessarily share the ideological foundations of Nazism or Stalinism, writing that “all ideologies contain totalitarian elements.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 470&lt;/ref&gt;

== Carl Friedrich and Zbigniew Brzezinski ==
[[File:Zbigniew Brzezinski, 1977.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] in 1977, the year he became [[National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)|United States National Security Advisor]] under president [[Jimmy Carter]].]]

===Totalitarian systems and autocracies===
The totalitarian paradigm in the comparative study of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union was further developed by [[Carl Joachim Friedrich|Carl Friedrich]] and [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], who wrote extensively on this topic both individually and in collaboration. Similar to Hannah Arendt, they state that “totalitarian dictatorship is a new phenomenon; there has never been anything quite like it before.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich and Brzezinski classify totalitarian dictatorship as a type of [[autocracy]], but argue that it is different in important ways from most other historical autocracies. In particular, it is distinguished by a reliance on modern technology and mass legitimation.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Arendt, Friedrich and Brzezinski apply the notion of totalitarian dictatorship not only to the regimes of Hitler and Stalin, but also to the USSR throughout its entire existence, as well as the regime of [[Benito Mussolini]] in Italy and the [[People’s Republic of China]] under [[Mao Zedong]].

Carl Friedrich noted that the “possibility of equating the dictatorship of Stalin in the Soviet Union and that of Hitler in Germany” has been a deeply controversial topic and a subject of debate almost from the beginning of those dictatorships.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Various other aspects of the two regimes have also been the subject of intense scholarly debate, such as whether Nazi and Stalinist ideologies were genuinely believed and pursued by the respective governments, or whether the ideologies were merely convenient justifications for dictatorial rule.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich himself argues in favor of the former view.

Friedrich and Brzezinski argue that Nazism and Stalinism are not only similar to each other, but also represent a continuation or a return to the tradition of European [[absolute monarchy]] on certain levels.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In the absolute monarchies of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the monarch ultimately held all decisional power, and was considered accountable only to God. In Stalinism and Nazism, the leader likewise held all real power, and was considered accountable only to various intangible entities such as “the people”, “the masses” or “the Volk.” Thus the common feature of autocracies – whether monarchical or totalitarian – is the concentration of power in the hands of a leader who cannot be held accountable by any legal mechanisms, and who is supposed to be the embodiment of the will of an abstract entity.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich and Brzezinski also identify other features common to all autocracies, such as “the oscillation between tight and loose control.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The regime alternates between periods of intense repression and periods of relative freedom, often represented by different leaders. This depends in part on the personal character of different leaders, but Friedrich and Brzezinski believe that there is also an underlying political cycle, in which rising discontent leads to increased repression up to the point at which the opposition is eliminated, then controls are relaxed until the next time that popular dissatisfaction begins to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, placing Stalinism and Nazism within the broader historical tradition of autocratic government, Friedrich and Brzezinski hold that “totalitarian dictatorship, in a sense, is the adaptation of autocracy to twentieth-century industrial society.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the same time, they insist that totalitarian dictatorship is a “''novel'' type of autocracy”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and argue that twentieth century totalitarian regimes (such as those of Hitler and Stalin) had more in common with each other than with any other form of government, including historical autocracies of the past. Totalitarianism can only exist after the creation of modern technology, because such technology is essential for [[propaganda]], for surveillance of the population, and for the operation of a [[secret police]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, when speaking of the differences and similarities between fascist and communist regimes, Friedrich and Brzezinski insist that the two kinds of totalitarian governments are “basically alike” but “not wholly alike” – they are more similar to each other than to other forms of government, but they are not the same.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Among the major differences between them, Friedrich and Brzezinski identify in particular the fact that communists seek “the world revolution of the proletariat,” while fascists wish to “establish the imperial predominance of a particular nation or race.” &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Five pillars of totalitarian systems===
In terms of the similarities between Nazism and Stalinism, Friedrich lists five main aspects that they hold in common: First, an official ideology that is supposed to be followed by all members of society, at least passively, and which promises to serve as a perfect guide towards some ultimate goal. Second, a [[one-party state|single political party]], composed of the most enthusiastic supporters of the official ideology, representing an elite group within society (no more than 10 percent of the population), and organized along strictly regimented lines. Third, “a technologically conditioned near-complete monopoly of control of all means of effective armed combat” in the hands of the party or its representatives. Fourth, a similar monopoly held by the party over the mass media and all technological forms of communication. Fifth, “a system of terroristic police control” that is not only used to defend the regime against real enemies, but also to persecute various groups of people who are only suspected of being enemies or who may potentially become enemies in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Two first pillars of any totalitarian government, according to Friedrich and Brzezinski, are the dictator and the Party. The dictator, whether Stalin, Hitler or Mussolini, holds supreme power. Friedrich and Brzezinski explicitly reject the claim that the Party, or any other institution, could provide a significant counterweight to the power of the dictator in Nazism or Stalinism.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The dictator needs the Party in order to be able to rule, so he may be careful not to make decisions that would go directly against the wishes of other leading Party members, but ultimate authority rests with him and not with them. Like Arendt, Friedrich and Brzezinski also identify the cult of personality surrounding the leader as an essential element of a totalitarian dictatorship, and reference Stalin’s personality cult in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; They also draw attention to the fact that Hitler and Stalin were expected to provide ideological direction for their governments and not merely practical leadership. Friedrich and Brzezinski write that “unlike military dictators in the past, but like certain types of primitive chieftains, the totalitarian dictator is both ruler and high priest.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, he not only governs, but also provides the principles on which his government is to be based. This is partly due to the way that totalitarian governments arise. They come about when a militant ideological movement seizes power, so the first leader of a totalitarian government is usually the ideologue who built the movement that seized power, and subsequent leaders try to emulate him.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dictator and his henchmen ====
The totalitarian dictator needs loyal lieutenants to carry out his orders faithfully and with a reasonable degree of efficiency. Friedrich and Brzezinski identify parallels between the men in Hitler and Stalin’s entourage, arguing that both dictators used similar people to perform similar tasks. Thus, for example, [[Martin Bormann]] and [[Georgy Malenkov]] were both capable administrators and bureaucrats, while [[Heinrich Himmler]] and [[Lavrentiy Beria]] were ruthless secret police chiefs responsible for suppressing any potential challenge to the dictator’s power.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Both Hitler and Stalin promoted rivalry and distrust among their lieutenants so as to ensure that none of them would become powerful enough to challenge the dictator himself.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; This is the cause of an important weakness of the totalitarian regimes: the problem of succession. Friedrich points out that neither the Nazi nor the Stalinist government ever established any official line of succession or any mechanism to decide who would replace the dictator after his death. The dictator, being the venerated “father of the people,” was regarded as irreplaceable. There could never be any heir apparent, because such an heir would have been a threat to the power of the dictator while he was alive. Thus the dictator’s inevitable death would always leave behind a major power vacuum and cause a political crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the Nazi regime, since Hitler died mere days before the final defeat of Germany in the war, this never became a major issue. In the case of the USSR, Stalin’s death led to a prolonged power struggle.

====Totalitarian Party====
Friedrich and Brzezinski also identify key similarities between the Nazi and Stalinist political parties, which set them apart from other types of political parties. Both the [[Nazi Party]] and the [[CPSU]] under Stalin had very strict membership requirements and did not accept members on the basis of mere agreement with the Party’s ideology and goals. Rather, they strictly tested potential members, in a manner similar to exclusive clubs, and often engaged in political [[purge]]s of the membership, expelling large numbers of people from their ranks (and sometimes arresting and executing those expelled, such as in the [[Great Purge]] or the [[Night of the Long Knives]]).&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the totalitarian party cultivates the idea that to be a member is a privilege which needs to be earned, and total obedience to the leader is required in order to maintain this privilege. While both Nazism and Stalinism required party members to display such total loyalty in practice, they differed in the way they dealt with it in theory. Nazism openly proclaimed the hierarchical ideal of absolute obedience to the [[Führer]] as one of its key ideological principles (the ''[[Führerprinzip]]''). Stalinism, meanwhile, denied that it did anything similar, and claimed instead to uphold democratic principles, with the Party Congress (made up of elected delegates) supposedly being the highest authority.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Stalinist elections typically featured only a single candidate, and the Party Congress met very rarely and simply approved Stalin’s decisions. Thus, regardless of the differences in their underlying ideological claims, the Nazi and Stalinist parties were organized in practice along similar lines, with a rigid hierarchy and centralized leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Each totalitarian party and dictator is supported by a specific totalitarian ideology. Friedrich and Brzezinski argue, in agreement with Arendt, that Nazi and Stalinist leaders really believed in their respective ideologies and did not merely use them as tools to gain power. Several major policies, such as the [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|Stalinist collectivization of agriculture]] or the [[Final Solution |Nazi “final solution”]], cannot be explained by anything other than a genuine commitment to achieve ideological goals, even at great cost.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The ideologies were different and their goals were different, but what they had in common was a [[utopian]] commitment to reshaping the world, and a determination to fight by any means necessary against a real or imagined enemy.  This stereotyped enemy could be described as “the fat rich Jew or the Jewish Bolshevik” for the Nazis, or “the war-mongering, atom-bomb-wielding American Wallstreeter” for the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ideology and symbolism====
According to Friedrich and Brzezinski, the most important difference between Nazi and Stalinist ideology lies in the degree of universality involved. Stalinism, and communist ideology in general, is universal in its appeal and addresses itself to all the “[[Workers of the world, unite!|workers of the world]].” Nazism, on the other hand, and fascist ideology in general, can only address itself to one particular race or nation – the “[[master race]]” that is destined to dominate all others. Therefore, “in communism social justice appears to be the ultimate value, unless it be the classless society that is its essential condition; in fascism, the highest value is dominion, eventually world dominion, and the strong and pure nation-race is ''its'' essential condition, as seen by its ideology.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; This means that fascist or Nazi movements from different countries will be natural enemies, rather than natural allies, as they each seek to extend the dominion of their own nation at the expense of others.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich and Brzezinski see this as a weakness inherent in fascist and Nazi ideology, while communist universalism is a source of ideological strength for Stalinism.

Friedrich and Brzezinski also draw attention to the symbols used by Nazis and Stalinists to represent themselves. The Soviet Union adopted the [[hammer and sickle]], a newly-created symbol, “invented by the leaders of the movement and pointing to the future.” Meanwhile, Nazi Germany used the [[swastika]], “a ritual symbol of uncertain origin, quite common in primitive societies.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 89-90&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, one is trying to project itself as being oriented towards a radically new future, while the other is appealing to a mythical heroic past.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

====Propaganda and terror====
Totalitarian dictatorships maintain themselves in power through the use of propaganda and terror, which Friedrich and Brzezinski believe to be closely connected. Terror may be enforced with arrests and executions of dissenters, but it can also take more subtle forms, such as the threat of losing one’s job, social stigma and defamation. “Terror” can refer to any widespread method used to intimidate people into submission as a matter of daily life. According to Friedrich and Brzezinski, the most effective terror is invisible to the people it affects. They simply develop a habit of acting in a conformist manner and not questioning authority, without necessarily being aware that this is what they are doing.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, terror creates a society dominated by apparent consensus, where the vast majority of the population appears to support the government. Propaganda is then used to maintain this appearance of popular consent. &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

Totalitarian propaganda is one of the features that distinguishes totalitarian regimes as modern forms of government and separates them from older autocracies, since a totalitarian government holds complete control over all means of communication (not only public communication such as the mass media, but also private communication such as letters and telephone calls, which are strictly monitored).&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; The methods of propaganda were very similar in the Stalinist USSR and in Nazi Germany. Both [[Joseph Goebbels]] and Soviet propagandists sought to demonize their enemies and present a picture of a united people standing behind its leader to confront foreign threats. In both cases there was no attempt to convey complex ideological nuances to the masses, with the message being instead about a simplistic struggle between good and evil. Both Nazi and Stalinist regimes produced two very different sets of propaganda – one for internal consumption and one for potential sympathizers in other countries. And both regimes would sometimes radically change their propaganda line as they made peace with a former enemy or got into a war with a former ally.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 133-134&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, paradoxically, a totalitarian government’s complete control over communications renders that government highly misinformed. With no way for anyone to express criticism, the dictator has no way of knowing how much support he actually has among the general populace. With all government policies always declared successful in propaganda, officials are unable to determine what actually worked and what didn’t.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stalinism and Nazism suffered from this problem, especially during the war between them. As the war turned against Germany, there was growing opposition to Hitler’s rule, including within the ranks of the military, but Hitler was never aware of this until it was too late (see: [[20 July plot]]). In 1948, during the early days of the [[Berlin Blockade]], the Soviet leadership apparently believed that the population of [[West Berlin]] was sympathetic to Soviet Communism and that they would request to join the Soviet zone.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 136-137&lt;/ref&gt; Given enough time, the gap between real public opinion and what the totalitarian government believes about public opinion can grow so wide that the government is no longer able to even produce effective propaganda, because it does not know what the people actually think and so it does not know what to tell them. Friedrich and Brzezinski refer to this as the “ritualization of propaganda”: the totalitarian regime continues to produce propaganda as a political ritual, with little real impact on public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arrests, executions and concentration camps====
The totalitarian use of mass arrests, executions and concentration camps – also noted by Arendt – was analyzed at length by Friedrich and Brzezinski. They hold that “totalitarian terror maintains, in institutionalized form, the civil war that originally produced the totalitarian movement and by means of which the regime is able to proceed with its program, first of social disintegration and then of social reconstruction.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stalinism and Nazism saw themselves as engaging in a life-or-death struggle against implacable enemies. But to declare that the struggle had been won would have meant to declare that most of the totalitarian features of the government were no longer needed. A secret police force, for instance, has no reason to exist if there are no dangerous traitors who need to be found. Thus the struggle, or “civil war” against internal enemies, must be institutionalized and must continue indefinitely. In the Stalinist USSR, the repressive apparatus was eventually turned against members of the Communist Party itself in the Great Purge and the [[Moscow Trials|show trials]] that accompanied it. &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 187, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Nazism, by contrast, had a much shorter lifespan in power, and Nazi terror generally maintained an outward focus, with the extermination of the Jews always given top priority. The Nazis did not turn inward towards purging their own party except in a limited way on two occasions (the Night of the Long Knives and the aftermath of the 20 July plot). &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

The peak of totalitarian terror was reached with the [[Nazi concentration camps]]. These ranged from [[labor camp]]s to [[extermination camp]]s, and they are described by Friedrich and Brzezinski as aiming to “eliminate all actual, potential, and imagined enemies of the regime.” &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; As the field of [[Holocaust studies]] was still in its early stages at the time of their writing, they do not describe the conditions in detail, but do refer to the camps as involving “extreme viciousness.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; They also compare these camps with the Soviet [[Gulag]] system, and highlight the use of concentration camps as a method of punishment and execution by Nazi and Stalinist regimes alike. However, unlike Hannah Arendt, who held that the Gulag camps served no economic purpose, Friedrich and Brzezinski argue that they provided an important source of cheap labor for the Stalinist economy.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

== Moshe Lewin and Ian Kershaw==
[[File:Ian Kershaw 2012 crop.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ian Kershaw]] in 2012]]

===Germany and Russia===
The comparative study of Nazism and Stalinism was carried further by other groups of scholars, such as [[Moshe Lewin]] and [[Ian Kershaw]] together with their collaborators. Writing after the [[dissolution of the USSR]], Lewin and Kershaw take a longer historical perspective and regard Nazism and Stalinism not so much as examples of a new type of society (like Arendt, Friedrich and Brzezinski did), but more as historical “anomalies” – unusual deviations from the typical path of development that most industrial societies are expected to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the task of comparing Nazism and Stalinism is, to them, a task of explaining why Germany and Russia (along with other countries) deviated from the historical norm. At the outset, Lewin and Kershaw identify similarities between the historical situations in Germany and Russia prior to the First World War and during that war. Both countries were ruled by authoritarian monarchies, who were under pressure to make concessions to popular demands. Both countries had “powerful bureaucracies and strong military traditions.” Both had “powerful landowning classes,” while also being in the process of rapid industrialization and modernization. And both countries had expansionist foreign policies with a particular interest in Central and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Lewin and Kershaw do not claim that these factors made Stalinism or Nazism inevitable, but rather that they help to explain why the Stalinist and Nazi regimes developed similar features.

===Similarities and differences of the systems===
Ian Kershaw  admitted that Stalinism and Nazism are comparable in “the nature and extent of their inhumanity,” but noted that the two regimes were different in a number of aspects&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 88-89&lt;/ref&gt; Lewin and Kershaw question the usefulness of grouping the Stalinist and Nazi regimes together under a “totalitarian” category, saying that it remains an open question whether the similarities between them are greater or smaller than the differences.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 3-5&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they criticize what they see as the ideologically-motivated attempt to determine which regime killed more people, saying that apologists of each regime are trying to defend their side by claiming the other was responsible for more deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personality cult====
Lewin and Kershaw place the [[cult of personality]] at the center of their comparison of Nazism and Stalinism, writing that both regimes “represented a new genre of political system centred upon the artificial construct of a leadership cult – the ‘heroic myth’ of the ‘great leader’, no longer a king or emperor but a ‘man of the people.”&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to Stalinism, they emphasize its bureaucratic character, and its “merging of the most modern with the most archaic traits” by combining modern technology and the latest methods of administration and propaganda with the ancient practice of arbitrary rule by a single man.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; They compare this with the [[Prussia]]n military tradition in Germany, which had been called “bureaucratic absolutism” in the eighteenth century, and which played a significant role in the organization of the Nazi state in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Kershaw agrees with Mommsen that there was a fundamental difference between Nazism and Stalinism regarding the importance of the leader. Stalinism had an absolute leader, but he was not essential. He could be replaced by another. Nazism, on the other hand, was a “classic charismatic leadership movement,” defined entirely by its leader. Stalinism had an ideology which existed independently of Stalin. But for Nazism, “Hitler ''was'' ideological orthodoxy” – Nazi ideals were by definition whatever Hitler said they were. In Stalinism, the bureaucratic apparatus was the foundation of the system, while in Nazism, the person of the leader was the foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

Moshe Lewin also focuses on the comparison between the personality cults of Hitler and Stalin, and their respective roles in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. He refers to them as the “Hitler myth” and the “Stalin myth,” and argues that they served different functions within their two regimes. The function of the “Hitler myth” was to legitimize Nazi rule. The function of the “Stalin myth” was to legitimize not Soviet rule itself, but Stalin’s leadership within the Party. Stalin’s personality cult existed precisely because Stalin knew that he was replaceable, and feared that he might be replaced, and so needed to bolster his authority as much as possible. While the “Hitler myth” was essential to Nazi Germany, the “Stalin myth” was essential only to Stalin, not to the Soviet Union itself.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intrinsic instability of totalitarian systems====
Together with fellow historian [[Hans Mommsen]], Lewin argues that the Stalinist and Nazi regimes featured an “intrinsic structural contradiction” which led to “inherent self-destructiveness”: they depended on a highly organized state bureaucracy which was trying to set up complex rules and procedures for every aspect of life, yet this bureaucracy was under the complete personal control of a despot who made policy decisions as he saw fit, routinely changing his mind on major issues, without any regard for the rules and institutions which his own bureaucracy had set up.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The bureaucracy and the leader needed each other, but also undermined each other with their different priorities. Mommsen sees this as being a much greater problem in Nazi Germany than in Stalin’s Soviet Union, as the Nazis inherited large parts of the traditional German bureaucracy, while the Soviets largely built their own bureaucracy from the ground up.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that many of the irrational features of the Nazi regime – such as wasting resources on exterminating undesirable populations instead of using those resources in the war effort – were caused by the dysfunction of the Nazi state rather than by fanatical commitment to Nazi ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with the [[Führerprinzip]], all decisional power in the Nazi state ultimately rested with Hitler. But Hitler often issued only vague and general directives, forcing other Nazi leaders lower down in the hierarchy to guess what precisely the Führer wanted. This confusion produced competition between Nazi officials, as each of them attempted to prove that he was a more dedicated Nazi than his rivals, by engaging in ever more extreme policies. This competition to please Hitler was, according to Mommsen, the real cause of Nazi irrationality.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 81-82&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler was aware of it, and deliberately encouraged it out of a “social-darwinist conviction that the best man would ultimately prevail.”&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Mommsen argues that this represents a structural difference between the regimes of Hitler and Stalin. In spite of its purges, Stalin’s regime was more effective in building a stable bureaucracy, such that it was possible for the system to sustain itself and continue even without Stalin. The Nazi regime, on the other hand, was much more personalized and depended entirely on Hitler, being unable to build any lasting institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 85-87&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stalin and Hitler====
Kershaw also saw  major personal differences between Stalin and Hitler and their respective styles of rule. He describes Stalin as “a committee man, chief oligarch, man of the machine” and a “creature of his party,” who came to power only thanks to his party and his ability to manipulate the levers of power within that party.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler, by contrast, came to power based on his charisma and mass appeal, and in the Nazi regime it was the leader that created the party instead of the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kershaw, “Stalin was a highly interventionist dictator, sending a stream of letters and directives determining or interfering with policy,” while Hitler “was a non-interventionist dictator as far as government administration was concerned,” preferring to involve himself in military affairs and plans for conquest rather than the daily routine of government work, and giving only broad verbal instructions to his subordinates regarding civilian affairs, which they were expected to translate into policy.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 91-92&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, although both regimes featured all-pervasive cults of personality, there was a qualitative difference between those cults. Stalin’s personality cult was “superimposed upon the Marxist-Leninist ideology and Communist Party,” and could be abandoned (or replaced with a personality cult around some other leader) without major changes to the regime. On the other hand, “the ‘Hitler myth’ was structurally indispensable to, in fact the very basis of, and scarcely distinguishable from, the Nazi Movement and its ''Weltanschauung''.”&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The belief in the person of Adolf Hitler as the unique savior of the German nation was the very foundation of Nazism, to such an extent that Nazism found it impossible to even imagine a successor to Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in Kershaw’s analysis, Stalinism was a fundamentally bureaucratic system while Nazism was the embodiment of “charismatic authority” as described by [[Max Weber]]. Stalinism could exist without its leader. Nazism could not. &lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rousso, Werth, and Burrin ==
[[File:Nicolas Werth 04-2012.jpg|thumb|Nicolas Werth in 2012]]
The topic of comparisons between Nazism and Stalinism was also studied in the 1990s and 2000s by historians [[Henry Rousso]], [[Nicolas Werth]] and Philippe Burrin.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===The differences between Stalinism and Nazism===
Rousso defends the work of Carl Friedrich by pointing out that Friedrich himself had only said that Stalinism and Nazism were comparable, not that they were identical. Rousso also argues that the popularity of the concept of totalitarianism (the way that large numbers of people have come to routinely refer to certain governments as “totalitarian”) should be seen as evidence that the concept is useful, that it really describes a specific type of government which is different from other dictatorships.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, however, Rousso notes that the concept of totalitarianism is descriptive rather than analytical: the regimes described as totalitarian do not have a common origin and did not arise in similar ways. Nazism is unique among totalitarian regimes in having taken power in “a country endowed with an advanced industrial economy and with a system of political democracy (and an even older political pluralism).” All other examples of totalitarianism (including the Stalinist regime) took power, according to Rousso, “in an agrarian economy, in a poor society without a tradition of political pluralism, not to mention democracy, and where diverse forms of tyranny had traditionally prevailed.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; He sees this as a weakness of the concept of totalitarianism, because it merely describes the similarities between Stalinism and Nazism without dealing with the very different ways they came to power.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Rousso agrees with Hannah Arendt that “totalitarian regimes constitute something new in regard to classical tyranny, authoritarian regimes, or other forms of ancient and medieval dictatorships,” and he says that the main strength of the concept of totalitarianism is the way it highlights this inherent novelty of the regimes involved.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict between the dictator and bureaucracy===
Nicolas Werth and Philippe Burrin have worked together on comparative assessments of Stalinism and Nazism, with Werth covering the Stalinist regime and Burrin covering Nazi Germany. One of the topics they have studied is the question of how much power the dictator really held in the two regimes. Werth identifies two main [[historiography|historiographical]] approaches in the study of the Stalinist regime: Those who emphasize the power and control exercised by Joseph Stalin himself, attributing most of the actions of the Soviet government to deliberate plans and decisions made by him, and those who argue that Stalin had no pre-determined course of action in mind, that he was reacting to events as they unfolded, and that the Soviet bureaucracy had its own agenda which often differed from Stalin’s wishes.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Werth regards these as two mistaken extremes, one making Stalin seem all-powerful, the other making him seem like a weak dictator.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; But he believes that the competing perspectives are useful in drawing attention to the tension between two different forms of organization in the Stalinist USSR: an “administrative system of command,” bureaucratic and resistant to change but effective in running the Soviet state, and the strategy of “running the country in a crudely despotic way by Stalin and his small cadre of directors.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Werth agrees with Lewin that there was an inherent conflict between the priorities of the Soviet bureaucracy and Stalin’s accumulation of absolute power in his own hands. According to Werth, it was this unresolved and unstated conflict that led to the Great Purge and to the use of terror by Stalin’s regime against its own party and state cadres.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

In studying similar issues with regard to the Nazi regime, Philippe Burrin draws attention to the debate between the “Intentionalist” and “Functionalist” schools of thought, which dealt with the question of whether the Nazi regime represented an extension of Hitler’s autocratic will, faithfully obeying his wishes, or whether it was an essentially chaotic and uncontrollable system that functioned on its own with little direct input from the Führer.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Like Kershaw and Lewin, Burrin says that the relationship between the leader and his party’s ideology was different in Nazism compared to Stalinism: “One can rightly state that Nazism cannot be dissociated from Hitlerism, something that is difficult to affirm for Bolshevism and Stalinism.” Unlike Stalin, who inherited an existing system with an existing ideology and presented himself as the heir to the Leninist political tradition, Hitler created both his movement and its ideology by himself, claiming to be “someone sent by Providence, a Messiah whom the German people had been expecting for centuries, even for two thousand years, as Heinrich Himmler enjoyed saying.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, there could be no real conflict between the Party and the leader in Nazi Germany, because the Nazi Party’s entire reason for existence was to support and follow Hitler. However, there was a potential for division between the leader and the state bureaucracy, due to the way that Nazism came to power – as part of an alliance with traditional conservative elites, industrialists, and the army.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the USSR, Nazi Germany did not build its own state, but rather inherited the state machinery of the previous government. This provided the Nazis with an immediate supply of capable and experienced managers and military commanders, but on the other hand it also meant that the Nazi regime had to rely on the cooperation of people who had not been Nazis prior to Hitler’s rise to power, and whose loyalty was questionable.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 58-59&lt;/ref&gt; It was only during the war, when Nazi Germany conquered large territories and had to create Nazi administrations for them, that brand new Nazi bureaucracies were created without any input or participation from traditional German elites. This produced a surprising difference between Nazism and Stalinism: When the Stalinist USSR conquered territory, it created smaller copies of itself and installed them as the governments of the occupied countries. When Nazi Germany conquered territory, on the other hand, it did not attempt to create copies of the German government back home. Instead, it experimented with different power structures and policies, often reflecting a “far more ample Nazification of society than what the balance of power authorized in the Reich.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of terror and violence===
Another major topic investigated by Werth and Burrin was the violence and terror employed by the regimes of Hitler and Stalin. Werth reports that the Stalinist USSR underwent an “extraordinary brutalization of the relations between state and society” for the purpose of rapid modernization and industrialization, to “gain one hundred years in one decade, and to metamorphose the country into a great industrial power.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; This transformation was accomplished at the cost of massive violence and a sociopolitical regression into what Werth calls “military-feudal exploitation.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The types of violence employed by the Stalinist regime included loss of civil rights, mass arrests, deportations of entire ethnic groups from one part of the USSR to another, forced labor in the [[Gulag]], mass executions (especially during the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] of 1937-38), and most of all the great famine of 1932-33, known as the [[Holodomor]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt; All levels of Soviet society were affected by Stalinist repression, from the top to the bottom. At the top, high-ranking members of the Communist Party were arrested and executed under the claim that they had plotted against Stalin (and in some cases they were forced to confess to imaginary crimes in [[Moscow Trials|show trials]]). At the bottom, the peasantry suffered the Holodomor famine (especially in [[Ukraine]]), and even outside of the famine years they were faced with very high grain quotas.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Werth identifies four categories of people that became the targets of Stalinist violence in the USSR. He lists them from smallest to largest. The first and smallest group consisted of many of Stalin’s former comrades-in-arms, who had participated in the revolution and were known as “[[Old Bolshevik]]s.” They were dangerous to Stalin because they had known him before his rise to power and could expose the many false claims made by his personality cult. The second group consisted of mid-level Communist Party officials, who were subject to mass arrests and executions in the late 1930s, particularly during the Great Purge. Eliminating them served a dual purpose: It helped Stalin to centralize power in the Kremlin (as opposed to regional centers), and it also provided him with “corrupt officials” that he could blame for earlier repressions and unpopular policies. Werth draws parallels between this and the old [[Tsarist]] tradition of blaming “bad bureaucrats” – rather than the [[Tsar]] – for unpopular government actions.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The third group was made up of ordinary citizens from all walks of life who resorted to petty crime in order to provide for themselves in the face of worsening living standards (for example by taking home some wheat from the fields or tools from the factory). This type of petty crime became very widespread, and was often punished as if it were intentional sabotage motivated by political opposition to the USSR. The fourth and largest category consisted of ethnic groups that were subject to deportation, famine, or arbitrary arrests under the suspicion of being collectively disloyal to Stalin or to the Soviet state. This included the Holodomor famine directed at the [[Ukrainians]], the deportation of ethnic groups suspected of pro-German sympathies (such as the [[Volga Germans]], the [[Crimean Tatars]], the [[Chechens]] and others), and eventually also persecution of ethnic [[Jews]], especially as [[Stalin and antisemitism|Stalin grew increasingly antisemitic]] near the end of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Burrin’s study of violence carried out by the Nazi regime begins with the observation that “violence is at the heart of Nazism,” and that Nazi violence is “established as a doctrine and exalted in speech.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; This marks a point of difference between Nazism and Stalinism, according to Burrin. In Stalinism, there was a gulf between ideology and reality when it came to violence. The Soviet regime continuously denied that it was repressive, proclaimed itself a defender of peace, and sought to conceal all the evidence to the contrary. In Nazism, on the other hand, “doctrine and reality were fused from the start.” Nazism not only practiced violent repression and war, but advocated it in principle as well, considering war to be a positive force in human civilization and openly seeking [[lebensraum|”living space”]] and the domination of the European continent by ethnic Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Burrin identifies three motivations for Nazi violence: political repression, exclusion and social repression, and racial politics.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these, political repression, is common in many dictatorships. The Nazis aimed to eliminate their real or imagined political opponents, first in the Reich and later in the occupied territories during the war. Some of these opponents were executed, while others were imprisoned in [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. The first targets of political repression, immediately after Hitler’s rise to power in 1933, were the parties of the Left in general and the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Then, after the mid-1930s, repression was extended to members of the clergy, and later to the conservative opposition as well (especially after the failed attempt to assassinate Hitler in 1944). The death penalty was used on a wide scale, even before the war. During the war, political repression was greatly expanded both inside Germany and especially in the newly occupied territories. Political prisoners in the concentration camps numbered only about 25,000 at the beginning of the war. By January 1945 they had swelled to 714,211 – most of them non-Germans accused of plotting against the Reich.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The second type of Nazi violence, motivated by exclusion and social repression, was the violence aimed at purging German society of people whose lifestyle was considered incompatible with the social norms of the Nazi regime (even if the people involved were racially pure and able-bodied). Such people were divided into two categories: [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] and “asocials.” The “asocials” were only vaguely defined, and included “Gypsies, tramps, beggars, prostitutes, alcoholics, the jobless who refused any employment, and those who left their work frequently or for no reason.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The third and final type of Nazi violence, by far the most extensive, was violence motivated by [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi racial policies]]. This was aimed both inward, to cleanse the “Aryan race” of “degenerate” elements and [[life unworthy of life]], as well as outward, to seek the extermination of [[Untermensch|“inferior races”]]. Germans considered physically or mentally unfit were among the first victims. One of the first laws of the Nazi regime mandated the forced sterilization of people suffering from physical handicaps or who had psychiatric conditions deemed to be hereditary. Later, sterilization was replaced by murder of the mentally ill and of people with severe disabilities, as part of a “euthanasia” program called [[Aktion T4]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Burrin notes that this served no practical political purpose – the people being murdered could not have possibly been political opponents of the regime – so the motivation was purely a matter of racial ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; The most systematic and by far the most large-scale acts of Nazi violence, however, were directed at “racially inferior” non-German populations. As laid out in ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'', the Nazis wished to eliminate most of the [[Slavs|Slavic]] populations of Eastern Europe, partly through deportation and partly through murder, in order to secure land for ethnic German settlement and colonization.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; But even more urgently, the Nazis wished to exterminate the [[Jews]] of Europe, whom they regarded as the implacable racial enemy of the Germans. This culminated in the [[Holocaust]], the Nazi [[genocide]] of the Jews. Unlike in the case of all other target populations, the Jews were to be exterminated completely, with no individual exceptions for any reason.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geyer and Fitzpatrick ==
In ''Beyond Totalitarianism: Stalinism and Nazism Compared'', editors [[Michael Geyer]] and [[Sheila Fitzpatrick]] disputed the concept of totalitarianism, noting that the term entered political discourse first as a term of self-description by the Italian Fascists and was only later used as a framework to compare Nazi Germany with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that the totalitarian states were not as monolithic or as ideology-driven as they seemed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Geyer and Fitzpatrick describe Nazi Germany and the Stalinist USSR as “immensely powerful, threatening, and contagious dictatorships” who “shook the world in their antagonism.”&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Without calling them totalitarian, they identified their common features, including genocide, an all-powerful party, a charismatic leader, and pervasive invasion of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; However, they argue that Stalinism and Nazism did not represent a new and unique type of government, but rather that they can be placed in the broader context of the turn to dictatorship in Europe in the interwar period.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The reason they appear extraordinary is because they were the “most prominent, most hard-headed, and most violent” of the European dictatorships of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; They are comparable because of their “shock and awe” and sheer ruthlessness, but underneath superficial similarities they were fundamentally different and that “when it comes to one-on-one comparison, the two societies and regimes may as well have hailed from different worlds.”&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Geyer and Fitzpatrick, the similarities between Nazism and Stalinism stem from the fact that they were both “ideology driven” and sought to subordinate all aspects of life to their respective ideologies. The differences stem from the fact that their ideologies were opposed to each other and regarded each other as enemies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Another major difference is that Stalin created a stable and long-lasting regime, while Nazi Germany had a “short-lived, explosive nature.”&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the stable state created by Stalinism was based on an entirely new elite, while Nazism, despite having the support of the traditional elite, failed to achieve stability.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the two regimes did borrow ideas from one another, especially regarding propaganda techniques (most of all in architecture and cinema), but also in terms of state surveillance and antisemitism. At the same time, they both vigorously denied borrowing anything from each other.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt; While their methods of propaganda were similar, the content was different. For instance, Soviet wartime propaganda revolved around the idea of resisting imperial aggression, while Nazi propaganda was about wars of racial conquest.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Geyer and Fitzpatrick also take note of the fact that both Stalinism and Nazism sought to create a New Man, an “entirely modern, illiberal, and self-fashioned personage,” even though they had different visions about what being a “New Man” would mean.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biopolitics, eugenics and social engineering===
Among the other authors contributing to the volume edited by Geyer and Fitzpatrick, David Hoffmann and Annette Timm discuss [[biopolitics]] and the pro-natalist policies of the Nazi and Stalinist regimes. Both governments were highly concerned over low fertility rates in their respective populations, and applied extensive and intrusive [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] techniques to increase the number of births.&lt;ref name="Geyer9"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 83-97.&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductive policies in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were administered through their health care systems—both regimes saw health care as a key pillar to their designs to develop a new society.&lt;ref name="Geyer11a"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Soviet Union had to design a public health care system from scratch, Nazi Germany built upon the pre-existing public health care system in Germany that had existed since 1883, when [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s legislation had created the world's first national public health care program.&lt;ref name="Geyer11a"/&gt; The Nazis centralized the German health care system in order to enforce Nazi ideological components upon it, and replaced existing voluntary and government welfare agencies with new ones that were devoted to racial hygiene and other components of Nazi ideology.&lt;ref name="Geyer11"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazi and Stalinist attempt to control family size was not unique, as many other European states practiced [[eugenics]] at this time, and the Stalinist and Nazi ideals were vastly different.&lt;ref name="Geyer6"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, they had more in common with third parties than with each other: Nazi Germany’s policies were rather similar to those in Scandinavia at the time, while the USSR’s policies resembled those in Catholic countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;The common point between Nazi and Stalinist practices was the connection of reproduction policies with the ideological goals of the state — "part of the project of a rational, hypermodern vision for the re-organization of society".&lt;ref name="Geyer7"&gt;[[Comparison of Nazism and Stalinism#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; There were nevertheless substantial differences between the two regimes' approaches. Stalin's Soviet Union never officially supported eugenics as the Nazis did—the Soviet government called eugenics a "fascist science"—although there were in fact Soviet eugenicists.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eugenicsarchive.ca/discover/connections/54ece589642e09bce5000001|title=Russia (former USSR)|work=The Eugenics Archives|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two regimes also had different approaches to the relationship between family and paid labor—Nazism promoted the male single-breadwinner family while Stalinism promoted the dual-wage-earner household.&lt;ref name="Geyer8"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass violence, xenophobia and persecution of ethnic minorities===
In another contribution to the same volume, Christian Gerlach and Nicolas Werth discuss the topic of mass violence, and the way that it was used by both Stalinism and Nazism.&lt;ref name="Geyer13"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stalin's Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were violent societies where mass violence was accepted by the state, such as in the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] of 1937 to 1938 in the Soviet Union and [[the Holocaust]] in Nazi Germany and its occupied territories in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Geyer15"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. Pp. 135, 139-151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Stalinist Soviet Union and Nazi Germany utilized internment camps led by agents of the state – the NKVD in the Soviet Union and the SS in Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="Geyer13" /&gt; They also both engaged in violence against minorities based on [[xenophobia]] – the xenophobic violence of the Nazis was outspoken but rationalized as being against "asocial" elements while the xenophobic violence of the Stalinists was disguised as being against "anti-soviet", "[[counter-revolutionary]]" and "socially harmful" elements – a term which often targeted diaspora nationalities.&lt;ref name="Geyer14"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stalinist Soviet Union established "special settlements" where the "socially harmful" or "socially dangerous" who included ex-convicts, criminals, vagrants, the disenfranchised and "declassed elements" were expelled to.&lt;ref name="Geyer15a"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. Pp. 139-140.&lt;/ref&gt; These "special settlements" were largely in Siberia, the far north, the Urals, or other inhospitable territories.&lt;ref name="Geyer16"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1933, the Soviet Union made a mass arrest of 5000 [[Romani people]] effectively on the basis of their ethnicity, who were deported that month to the "special settlements" in Western Siberia.&lt;ref name="Geyer16" /&gt; In 1935, the Soviet Union arrested 160,000 homeless people and juvenile delinquents and sent many of them to NKVD labor colonies where they did [[forced labor]].&lt;ref name="Geyer17"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazi regime was founded upon a racialist view of politics and envisioned the deportation or extermination of the majority of the population of Eastern Europe in order to open up “living space” for ethnic German settlers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; This was mainly intended to be carried out after an eventual German victory in the war, but steps had already started being taken while the war was still ongoing. For instance, by the end of 1942, the Nazis had deported 365,000 Poles and Jews from their original homes in western Poland (now German-annexed) and into the [[General Government]]. A further 194,000 Poles were internally displaced (not deported to another territory but expelled from their homes). The Nazis had also deported 100,000 persons from Alsace, Lorraine, and Luxembourg, as well as 54,000 Slovenians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

Stalinism in practice in the Soviet Union pursued ethnic deportations from the 1930s to the early 1950s, with a total of 3 million Soviet citizens being subjected to ethnic-based resettlement.&lt;ref name="Geyer17a"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 157-158.&lt;/ref&gt; The first major ethnic deportation took place from December 1932 to January 1933, during which some 60,000 Kuban Cossacks were collectively criminally charged as a whole with association with resistance to socialism and affiliation with Ukrainian nationalism.&lt;ref name="Geyer18"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1935 to 1936, the Soviet Union deported Soviet citizens of Polish and German origins living in the western districts of Ukraine, and Soviet citizens of Finnish origins living on the Finland-Soviet Union border.&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt; These deportations from 1935 to 1936 affected tens of thousands of families.&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt; From September to October 1937, Soviet authorities deported the Korean minority from its Far Eastern region that bordered on Japanese-controlled Korea.&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt; Soviet authorities claimed the territory was "rich soil for the Japanese to till" – implying a Soviet suspicion that the Koreans could potentially join forces with the Japanese to unite the land with Japanese-held Korea.&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt; Over 170,000 Koreans were deported to remote parts of Soviet Central Asia from September to October 1937. These ethnically-based deportations reflected a new trend in Stalinist policy, a "Soviet xenophobia" based on ideological grounds that suspected that these people were susceptible to foreign influence, and which was also based on a resurgent [[Russian nationalism]].&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt;

After Nazi Germany declared war on the Soviet Union in 1941, the Soviet Union initiated another major round of ethnic deportations. The first group targeted were Soviet Germans. Between September 1941 and February 1942, 900,000 people – over 70 percent of the entire Soviet German community – were deported to Kazakhstan and Siberia in mass operations.&lt;ref name="Geyer19"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 158-159.&lt;/ref&gt; A second wave of mass deportations took place between November 1943 and May 1944, in which Soviet authorities expelled six ethnic groups (the [[Balkars]], [[Chechens]], [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Ingush people|Ingush]], [[Karachai]], and [[Kalmyks]]) that together numbered 900,000.&lt;ref name="Geyer20"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also smaller-scale operations involving ethnic cleansing of diaspora minorities during and after World War II, in which tens of thousands of Crimean Bulgarians, Greeks, Iranians, Khemshils, Kurds, and Meskhetian Turks were deported from the Black Sea and Transcaucasian border regions.&lt;ref name="Geyer20" /&gt;

Two ethnic groups that were specifically targeted for persecution by Stalin's Soviet Union were the Chechens and the Ingush.&lt;ref name="Geyer20" /&gt; Unlike the other nationalities that could be suspected of connection to foreign states which shared their ethnic background, the Chechens and the Ingush were completely indigenous people of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Geyer20" /&gt; Rather than being accused of collaboration with foreign enemies, these two ethnic groups were considered to have cultures which did not fit in with Soviet culture – such as accusing Chechens of being associated with “banditism” – and the authorities claimed that the Soviet Union had to intervene in order to “remake” and “reform” these cultures.&lt;ref name="Geyer20" /&gt; In practice this meant heavily armed punitive operations carried out against Chechen “bandits” that failed to achieve forced assimilation, culminating in an ethnic cleansing operation in 1944, which involved the arrests and deportation of over 500,000 Chechens and Ingush from the [[Caucasus]] to [[Central Asia]] and [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref name="Geyer21"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt; The deportations of the Chechens and Ingush also involved the outright massacre of thousands of people, and severe conditions placed upon the deportees – they were put in unsealed train cars, with little to no food for a four-week journey during which many died from hunger and exhaustion.&lt;ref name="Geyer22"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difference between Nazi and Stalinist deportations was in their purpose: while Nazi Germany sought ethnic cleansing to allow settlement by Germans into the cleansed territory, Stalin's Soviet Union pursued ethnic cleansing in order to remove minorities from strategically important areas.&lt;ref name="Geyer23"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other scholars==
&lt;!-- This section contains statements sourced to scholarly authors who have written on the topic of the comparison between Nazism and Stalinism, but for whom we only have a little information in the article at the moment, so it would not make sense to assign a separate section to each of them. As the material cited to a given author grows beyond two or three paragraphs, consider giving that author a dedicated section. --&gt;

Other historians and political scientists have also made comparisons between Nazism and Stalinism as part of their work.

[[Stanley Payne]], in his work on fascism, said that although the Nazi Party was ideologically opposed to communism, Adolf Hitler and other Nazi leaders frequently expressed recognition that only in Soviet Russia were their revolutionary and ideological counterparts to be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley Payne|title=Fascism: Comparison and Definition|date=15 March 1983|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=9780299080648|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both placed a major emphasis on creating a "party-army," with the regular armed forces controlled by the party. In the case of the Soviet Union this was done through the [[political commissar]]s, while Nazi Germany introduced a roughly equivalent leadership role for "National Socialist Guidance Officers" in 1943.&lt;ref name="Payne1"&gt;[[#Payne1983|Payne (1983)]]. p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François Furet]], in his work on communism, noted that Hitler personally admired Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, and on numerous occasions publicly praised Stalin for seeking to purify the Communist Party of the Soviet Union of Jewish influences, especially by purging Jewish communists such as [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Grigory Zinoviev]], [[Lev Kamenev]] and [[Karl Radek]].&lt;ref name="François Furet 1999. Pp. 191-192"&gt;François Furet. ''Passing of an Illusion: The Idea of Communism in the Twentieth Century''. University of Chicago Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-226-27340-7}}. Pp. 191-192.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Pipes]] draws attention to [[Stalin and antisemitism|Stalin and his antisemitism]] in a parallel with [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi antisemitism]]. He notes that soon after the 1917 October Revolution, the Soviet Union undertook practices to break up Jewish culture, religion and language. In the fall of 1918, the Soviet Communist Party set up the Jewish section [[Yevsektsiya]], with a stated mission of “destruction of traditional Jewish life, the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement, and Hebrew culture.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Pipes]], "Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime", New York: NY, Vintage Books, Random House Inc., 1995, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; By 1919, the Bolsheviks  began to confiscate Jewish properties, Hebrew schools, libraries, books, and synagogues in accordance with newly imposed anti-religious laws, turning their buildings into "Communist centers, clubs or restaurants."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, "Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime", New York: NY, Vintage Books, Random House Inc., 1995, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; After Joseph Stalin rose to power, antisemitism continued to be endemic throughout Russia, although official Soviet policy condemned it. On August 12, 1952, Stalin's personal antisemitism became more visible, as he ordered the execution of the most prominent Yiddish authors in the Soviet Union, in an event known as the "[[Night of the Murdered Poets]]". Shortly before his death, Stalin also organized the anti-Semitic campaign known as the [[Doctors' plot]].

A number of research institutions are focusing on the analysis of fascism/Nazism and Stalinism/communism, and the comparative approach, including the [[Hannah Arendt Institute for the Research on Totalitarianism]] in Germany, the [[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] in the Czech Republic and the [[Institute of National Remembrance]] in Poland.

In comparing the deaths caused by both Stalin and Hitler's policies, some historians have asserted that archival evidence released after the collapse of the USSR confirms that Stalin did not kill more people than Hitler. American historian [[Timothy D. Snyder]], for example, after assessing such data, says that while the Nazi regime killed approximately 11 million non-combatants (which rises to above 12 million if "foreseeable deaths from deportation, hunger, and sentences in concentration camps are included"), Stalin's deliberately killed about 6 million (rising to 9 million if foreseeable deaths arising from policies are taken into account).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Snyder|first=Timothy|title=Hitler vs. Stalin: Who Was Worse?|website=The New York Review of Books|date=27 January 2011|url=http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2011/01/27/hitler-vs-stalin-who-was-worse/|accessdate=25 May 2018|quote=" The total number of noncombatants killed by the Germans—about 11 million—is roughly what we had thought. The total number of civilians killed by the Soviets, however, is considerably less than we had believed. We know now that the Germans killed more people than the Soviets did . . . All in all, the Germans deliberately killed about 11 million noncombatants, a figure that rises to more than 12 million if foreseeable deaths from deportation, hunger, and sentences in concentration camps are included. For the Soviets during the Stalin period, the analogous figures are approximately six million and nine million. These figures are of course subject to revision, but it is very unlikely that the consensus will change again as radically as it has since the opening of Eastern European archives in the 1990s.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian historian and archival researcher [[Stephen G. Wheatcroft]] posits that "The Stalinist regime was consequently responsible for about a million purposive killings, and through its criminal neglect and irresponsibility it was probably responsible for the premature deaths of about another two million more victims amongst the repressed population, i.e. in the camps, colonies, prisons, exile, in transit and in the POW camps for Germans. These are clearly much lower figures than those for whom Hitler's regime was responsible." Wheatcroft also says that, unlike Hitler, Stalin's "purposive killings" fit more closely into the category of "execution" than "murder", given he thought the accused were indeed guilty of crimes against the state and insisted on documentation, whereas Hitler simply wanted to kill Jews and communists because of who they were, and insisted on no documentation and was indifferent at even a pretence of legality for these actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sovietinfo.tripod.com/WCR-German_Soviet.pdf|title=The Scale and Nature of German and Soviet Repression and Mass Killings, 1930–45|last=Wheatcroft|first=S.

[[Kristen R. Ghodsee]], an ethnographer of post-Cold War Eastern Europe, contends that the efforts to institutionalize the "double genocide thesis", or the moral equivalence between the Nazi Holocaust (race murder) and the victims of communism (class murder), and in particular the recent push at the beginning of the global financial crisis for commemoration of the latter in Europe, can be seen as the response by economic and political elites to fears of a leftist resurgence in the face of devastated economies and extreme inequalities in both the East and West as the result of [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] capitalism. She notes that any discussion of the achievements under communism, including literacy, education, women’s rights, and social security is usually silenced, and any discourse on the subject of communism is focused almost exclusively on Stalin's crimes and the "double genocide thesis", an intellectual paradigm summed up as such: "1) any move towards redistribution and away from a completely free market is seen as communist; 2) anything communist inevitably leads to class murder; and 3) class murder is the moral equivalent of the Holocaust." By linking all leftist and socialist ideals to the excesses of Stalinism, Ghodsee concludes, the elites in the West hope to discredit and marginalize all political ideologies that could "threaten the primacy of private property and free markets."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1= Ghodsee|first1=Kristen R.|volume = 4| issue = 2| pages = 115–142|title = A Tale of "Two Totalitarianisms": The Crisis of Capitalism and the Historical Memory of Communism| journal = History of the Present| date = 2014|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/kristenghodsee/files/history_of_the_present_galleys.pdf | jstor = 10.5406/historypresent.4.2.0115|authorlink=Kristen R.

The comparison of Stalinism and Nazism remains a neglected field of academic study.&lt;ref name="Geyer5"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved 24 Aug 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the two movements enabled each other.]]

The comparison of Nazism and Stalinism has long provoked political controversy,&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian; Moshé Lewin"&gt;Kershaw pp3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fleck&gt;{{cite book|last=Fleck |first=Christian|title=Intellectuals and their publics: perspectives from the social sciences|year=2008|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-7546-7540-2|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it led to [[Historikerstreit|the historians' dispute]] within Germany in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Lévy, Daniel. Sznaider, Natan"&gt;Lévy pp76&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), under the leadership of Chancellor [[Hermann Müller (politician)|Hermann Müller]], adopted the view that "red equals brown", i.e. that the communists and Nazis posed an equal danger to [[liberal democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Adelheid von Saldern, ''The Challenge of Modernity: German Social and Cultural Studies, 1890-1960'', University of Michigan Press (2002), {{ISBN|0-472-10986-3}}, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, [[Kurt Schumacher]] said that the two movements enabled each other. He argued that the [[Communist Party of Germany]], which was staunchly Stalinist, were "red-painted Nazis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lasten diktatorischer Vergangenheit, Herausforderungen demokratischer Gegenwart |last=Richter |first=Michael |editor1-first=Gerhard |editor1-last=Besier |editor2-first=Katarzyna |editor2-last=Stoklosa |series=Mittel- und Ostmitteleuropastudien |year=2006 |publisher=LIT Verlag |location=Münster |page=202 |chapter=Die doppelte Diktatur.

Marxist theories of fascism have seen fascism as a form of reaction to socialism and a feature of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Dave Renton. ''Fascism: Theory and Practice''. London: Pluto Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Several modern historians have tried to pay more attention to the economic, political and ideological differences between these two regimes than to their similarities.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Henry Rousso. "Stalinism and Nazism. History and Memory Compared". ''Historische Zeitschrift''. 286:3, 2008. Pp. 795–796.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 2008 [[Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism]], initiated by the [[Czech government]] and signed by figures such as [[Václav Havel]], called for "a common approach regarding crimes of totalitarian regimes, inter alia Communist regimes" and for
{{quote|reaching an all-European understanding that both the Nazi and Communist totalitarian regimes each to be judged by their own terrible merits to be destructive in their policies of systematically applying extreme forms of terror, suppressing all civic and human liberties, starting aggressive wars and, as an inseparable part of their ideologies, exterminating and deporting whole nations and groups of population; and that as such they should be considered to be the main disasters, which blighted the 20th century.&lt;ref name="declaration-text"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.praguedeclaration.eu/ |title=Prague Declaration - Declaration Text |date=3 June 2008 |publisher=[[Institute for Information on the Crimes of Communism]] |accessdate=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Communist Party of Greece]] opposes the Prague Declaration and has criticized "the new escalation of the [[anti-communist]] hysteria led by the EU council, the European Commission and the political staff of the bourgeois class in the European Parliament."&lt;ref name="CommunistPartyGreece"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://inter.kke.gr/News/news2011/2011-02-03-anticom-euparliament/ |title= Statement-condemnation of the escalation of the anti-communist hysteria by the EU |date= 2011-02-03 |publisher= [[Communist Party of Greece]] |accessdate= 2011-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Communist Party of Britain]] opined that the Prague Declaration "is a rehash of the persistent attempts by reactionary historians to equate Soviet Communism and Hitlerite Fascism, echoing the old slanders of British authors [[George Orwell]] and [[Robert Conquest]]."&lt;ref name="CommunistPartyUK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://communist-party.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=742%3Acp-contribution-to-international-conference-on-prague-declaration&amp;catid=128%3Aconferences&amp;Itemid=162 |title=CP contribution to International Conference on Prague Declaration |date=13 February 2010 |publisher=[[Communist Party of Britain]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64orFpG5S?url=http://communist-party.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=742%3Acp-contribution-to-international-conference-on-prague-declaration&amp;catid=128%3Aconferences&amp;Itemid=162 |accessdate=2011-05-16 |archivedate=19 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 documentary film ''[[The Soviet Story]]'', commissioned by the [[Union for Europe of the Nations]] group in the [[European Parliament]], published archival records which listed thousands of German Jews who were arrested in the Soviet Union by the [[NKVD]] (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs) from 1937 to 1941 and handed over to [[Gestapo]] or SS officials in Germany. These German Jews had originally sought asylum in the USSR. The documentary film accuses Stalin's regime of being an accomplice in Hitler's Holocaust by arresting these asylum seekers and sending them back to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;''The Soviet Story'', Edvins Snore, writer/director, 85-minute documentary, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009, the [[European Union]] has officially commemorated the [[European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism]],&lt;ref name="Buzek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/president/view/en/press/press_release/2010/2010-August/press_release-2010-August-10.html |title=President Jerzy Buzek on the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism |publisher=[[European Parliament]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yf46Gk7v?url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/president/view/en/press/press_release/2010/2010-August/press_release-2010-August-10.html |archivedate=13 May 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-10 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; proclaimed by the [[European Parliament]] in 2008&lt;ref name="Buzek" /&gt; and endorsed by the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8133749.stm|title=Resolution on Stalin riles Russia|date=3 July 2009|publisher=|via=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and officially known as the Black Ribbon Day in some countries (including Canada).&lt;ref name="TorontoSun2011"&gt;{{cite news |title=Victims of totalitarianism remembered |author= Daniel Proussalidis |url= http://www.torontosun.com/2011/08/23/victims-of-totalitarianism-remembered |newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=2011-08-23 |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former [[President of the European Parliament]] and [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] member, [[Hans-Gert Pöttering]], argued that "both totalitarian systems (Stalinism and Nazism) are comparable and terrible."&lt;ref name="eurolt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.lt/en/news/lithuanias-membership-in-the-eu/news/5537/?print=1 |title=Baltic States opened Western Europe's eyes on Soviet Union totalitarianism -- EP chairman in Vilnius |date=2009-04-28 |publisher=BNS |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722150204/http://www.euro.lt/en/news/lithuanias-membership-in-the-eu/news/5537/?print=1 |archivedate=22 July 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-10 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[Eastern Europe]]an countries the denial of both Nazi and Communist crimes has been explicitly outlawed, and Czech foreign minister [[Karel Schwarzenberg]] has argued that "there is a fundamental concern here that totalitarian systems be measured by the same standard."&lt;ref name="romea"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.romea.cz/english/index.php?id=detail&amp;detail=2007_2070 |title=Czech Foreign Minister: Denial of communist crimes like denial of Nazi crimes |publisher=Romea.cz |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yf7qICc8?url=http://www.romea.cz/english/index.php?id=detail&amp;detail=2007_2070 |archivedate=14 May 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-10 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[European Commission]] rejected calls for similar EU-wide legislation, due to the lack of consensus among member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EU rejects eastern states' call to outlaw denial of crimes by communist regimes|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/21/european-commission-communist-crimes-nazism|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 May 2011|location=London|first=Leigh |last=Phillips|date=2010-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement adopted by Russia's legislature said that comparisons of Nazism and Stalinism are "blasphemous towards all of the anti-fascist movement veterans, Holocaust victims, concentration camp prisoners and tens of millions of people ... who sacrificed their lives for the sake of the fight against the Nazis' anti-human racial theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rt.com/politics/nuremberg-trials-ww2-russia/ |title=Russian MPs call on world to suppress attempts to revive Nazi ideology |publisher=[[RT (TV network)|RT]] |date=2010-10-24|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British journalist [[Seumas Milne]] posits that the impact of the post-Cold War narrative that Stalin and Hitler were twin evils, and therefore Communism is as monstrous as Nazism, "has been to relativise the unique crimes of Nazism, bury those of colonialism and feed the idea that any attempt at radical social change will always lead to suffering, killing and failure."&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/sep/12/highereducation.historyandhistoryofart Seumas Milne: The battle for history].

{{about|the legal usage|complaints in other contexts|complaint (disambiguation)}}

{{Globalize/US|date=May 2017|discuss=Talk:Complaint#Globalize}}

{{Civil procedure (United States)}}

In legal terminology, a '''complaint''' is any formal legal document that sets out the facts and legal reasons (see: [[cause of action]]) that the [[Filing (legal)|filing]] party or parties (the [[plaintiff]](s)) believes are sufficient to support a claim against the party or parties against whom the claim is brought (the [[defendant]](s)) that entitles the plaintiff(s) to a [[Legal remedy|remedy]] (either [[money damages]] or [[injunctive relief]]). For example, the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] (FRCP) that govern civil litigation in [[United States]] courts provide that a civil action is commenced with the filing or service of a pleading called a complaint. Civil court rules in states that have incorporated the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure use the same term for the same pleading. 

In Civil Law, a “complaint” is the very first formal action taken to officially begin a lawsuit. This written document contains the allegations against the defense, the specific laws violated, the facts that led to the dispute, and any demands made by the plaintiff to restore justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.isaacsandisaacs.com/glossary/complaint|title=Legal Complaint - Very Simple Definitions - Lawyer Terms|author=|date=|website=isaacsandisaacs.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some jurisdictions, specific types of criminal cases may also be commenced by the filing of a complaint, also sometimes called a '''criminal complaint''' or '''felony complaint'''. Most criminal cases are prosecuted in the name of the governmental authority that promulgates criminal statutes and enforces the [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]] of the state with the goal of seeking criminal [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]], such as the State (also sometimes called the People) or Crown (in [[Commonwealth realm]]s). In the United States, the complaint is often associated with misdemeanor [[criminal charge]]s presented by the prosecutor without the grand jury process. In most U.S. jurisdictions, the charging instrument presented to and authorized by a [[grand jury]] is referred to as an [[indictment]].

==United States==
Virtually every [[U.S. state]] has some forms available on the [[World Wide Web|web]] for most common complaints for [[lawyer]]s and [[Pro se legal representation in the United States|self-representing]] litigants; if a petitioner cannot find an appropriate form in their state, they often can modify a form from another state to fit his or her request. Several [[United States federal courts]] publish general guidelines for the petitioners and [[civil liberties|Civil Rights]] complaint forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utd.uscourts.gov/forms/prose_guide.pdf|title=Pro Se Litigant Guide - Utah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=utah&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utd.uscourts.gov/forms/civilrt_guide.pdf|title=Civil Rights Complaint Guide - Utah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scd.uscourts.gov/docs/prose.pdf|title=Pro Se Guide - SC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.id.uscourts.gov/pro-se.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000815072342/http://www.id.uscourts.gov/pro-se.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2000-08-15|title=US District Court of Idaho - PRO SE HANDBOOK|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A complaint generally has the following structural elements:&lt;ref name=utah /&gt;
* Caption and Heading - lists name, address and telephone number of the filing attorney or [[Pro Se|self-representing litigant]] at the top of the complaint. The case caption usually also indicates the court in which the case originates, names of the parties and a brief description of the document.
* [[Subject-matter jurisdiction|Jurisdiction]] and [[Venue (law)|venue]] - this section describes why the case should be heard in the selected court rather than some other court or forum.
* [[Party (law)|Parties]] - identifies [[plaintiff]]s and [[defendant]]s.
* [[Definition]]s - optional section which defines some terms used throughout the document. The main purpose of a definition is to achieve clarity without needless repetition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/write/legal-docs/definitions.html|title=Drafting Legal Documents}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Statement of facts - lists facts that brought the case to the court.
* [[Cause of action|Cause of Action]] - a numbered list of legal allegations (called "[[Indictment|counts]]"), with specific details about application of the governing law to each count. In this section the plaintiff usually cites existing Law, previous decisions of the court where the case is being processed, decisions of the higher [[United States courts of appeals|appellate courts]], and cases from other courts, - as an analogy to resolve similar questions of law.
* Injury - plaintiff explains to the judge how the actions of the defendant(s) harmed his rights.
* [[Damages|Demand for relief]] - describes the relief that plaintiff is seeking as a result of the lawsuit. The relief can include a request for [[declaratory judgment]], a request for [[Injunction|injunctive relief]] (non-monetary relief), [[Compensatory damages|compensatory]] and actual damages (such as monetary relief), [[punitive damages]] (non-compensatory), and other relief.

After the complaint has been filed with the court, it has to be [[Service of process|properly served]] to the opposite parties, but usually petitioners are not allowed to serve the complaint personally.&lt;ref name="rule4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalrulesofcivilprocedure.org/frcp/title-ii/rule-4-summons/|title=Federal Rules of Civil Procedure - Rule 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court also can issue a [[summons]] - an official summary document which the plaintiff needs to have served together with the complaint. The defendants have limited time to respond, depending on the State or Federal rules. A defendant's failure to answer a complaint can result in a [[default judgment]] in favor of the petitioner.

For example, in [[United States federal courts]], any person who is at least 18 years old and not a [[Party (law)|party]] may serve a [[summons]] and complaint in a civil case.&lt;ref name="rule4" /&gt; The defendant must submit an [[Answer (law)|answer]] within 21 days after being served with the summons and complaint, or request a [[waiver]], according to [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|FRCP]] Rule 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalrulesofcivilprocedure.org/frcp/title-iii-pleadings-and-motions/rule-12-defenses-and-objections-when-and-how-presented-motion-for-judgment-on-the-pleadings-consolidating-motions-waiving-defenses-pretrial-hearing/|title=Federal Rules of Civil Procedure}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the civil complaint has been served to the defendants, the [[plaintiff]] must, as soon as practicable [[Initial Conference (Law)|initiate a conference]] between the parties to plan for the rest of the [[Discovery (law)|discovery process]] and then the parties should submit a proposed [[Initial Conference (Law)#Discovery Plan|discovery plan]] to the judge within 14 days after the conference.&lt;ref name="rule26"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalrulesofcivilprocedure.org/frcp/title-v-disclosures-and-discovery/rule-26-duty-to-disclose-general-provisions-governing-discovery/|title=FRCP Rule 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many U.S. jurisdictions, a complaint submitted to a court must be accompanied by a [[Case Information Statement]], which sets forth specific key information about the case and the [[lawyer]]s representing the [[Party (law)|parties]]. This allows the judge to make determinations about which deadlines to set for different phases of the case, as it moves through the court system.

There are also freely accessible [[web search engine]]s to assist parties in finding court decisions that can be cited in the complaint as an example or analogy to resolve similar questions of law. [[Google Scholar]] is the biggest database of full text state and federal courts decisions that can be accessed without charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dlib.org/dlib/september05/bauer/09bauer.html|title=An Examination of Citation Counts in a New Scholarly Communication Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; These web search engines often allow one to select specific state courts to search.&lt;ref name="goog_sch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/advanced_scholar_search|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041229000937/http://scholar.google.com/advanced_scholar_search|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2004-12-29|title=Google Scholar|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal courts created the [[PACER (law)|Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER)]] system to obtain case and [[Docket (court)|docket]] information from the [[United States district court]]s, [[United States court of appeals|United States courts of appeals]], and [[United States bankruptcy court]]s.&lt;ref name="pacer" /&gt; The system is managed by the [[Administrative Office of the United States Courts]]; it allows lawyers and self-represented clients to obtain documents entered in the case much faster than regular mail.&lt;ref name="pacer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacer.gov/|title=PACER}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filing and privacy ===
[[File:Complaint andr cryovac.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Example page from Complaint in [[Anderson v. Cryovac]] landmark case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/woburn/resources/trial_documents.html|title=Complaint in Anderson v. Cryovac landmark case.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In addition to [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]], many of the [[U.S. district courts]] have developed their own requirements included in Local Rules for filing with the Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/RulesAndPolicies/FederalRulemaking/LocalCourtRules.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522042618/http://www.uscourts.gov/RulesAndPolicies/FederalRulemaking/LocalCourtRules.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-05-22|title=LOCAL COURT RULES|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local Rules can set up a limit on the number of pages, establish deadlines for motions and responses, explain whether it is acceptable to combine a motion petition with a response, specify if a judge needs an additional copy of the documents (called "judge’s copy"), etc.&lt;ref name="indiana" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oklahoma" /&gt; Local Rules can define page layout elements like: [[Margin (typography)|margins]], text [[font|font/size]], distance between lines, mandatory footer text, [[Pagination|page numbering]], and provide directions on how the pages need to be bound together – i.e. acceptable [[Staple (fastener)|fastener]]s, number and location of [[Hole punch|fastening holes]], etc.&lt;ref name="indiana"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insd.uscourts.gov/publications/localrules.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923111128/http://www.insd.uscourts.gov/Publications/LocalRules.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-09-23|title= Local Rules of U.S. District Court, District of Indiana}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oklahoma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oknd.uscourts.gov/legal/generalo.nsf/0A0713F3B13A3660862570360013F310/$file/civil%20local%20rules.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229074609/http://www.oknd.uscourts.gov/legal/generalo.nsf/0A0713F3B13A3660862570360013F310/%24file/civil%20local%20rules.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-12-29|title=Local Rules of U.S. District Court, District of Oklahoma|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oregon"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ord.uscourts.gov/local-rules-of-civil-procedure/lr-10-form-of-pleadings-and-other-documents |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100527104338/http://www.ord.uscourts.gov/local-rules-of-civil-procedure/lr-10-form-of-pleadings-and-other-documents |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2010-05-27 |title=Local Rules of U.S. District Court, District of Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the filed motion does not comply with the Local Rules then the judge can choose to [[Motion to strike (court of law)|strike]] the motion completely, or order the party to re-file its motion, or grant a special exception to the Local Rules.

According to [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] (FRCP) {{frcp|5.2}}, sensitive text like [[Social Security number]], [[Taxpayer Identification Number]], [[birthday]], bank accounts and [[Minor (law)|children]]’s names, should be [[Sanitization (classified information)|redacted]] from the filings made with the court and accompanying exhibits,&lt;ref name=frcp5&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalrulesofcivilprocedure.org/frcp/title-ii/rule-5-2-privacy-protection-for-filings-made-with-the-court/|title=Federal Rules of Civil Procedure}}&lt;/ref&gt; (however, exhibits normally do not need to be attached to the original complaint, but should be presented to Court after the [[Discovery (law)|discovery]]). The redacted text can be erased with black-out or white-out, and the page should have an indication that it was redacted - most often by [[Rubber stamp|stamping]] word "redacted" on the bottom. Alternately, the filing party may ask the court’s permission to file some exhibits completely [[Under seal (Law)|under seal]]. A [[Minor (law)|minor]]'s name of the petitions should be replaced with [[initials]].&lt;ref name=frcp5 /&gt;

A person making a redacted filing can file an unredacted copy under seal, or the Court can choose to order later that an additional filing be made under seal without redaction.&lt;ref name=frcp5 /&gt; Copies of both redacted and unredacted documents filed with court should be provided to the other [[Party (law)|parties in the case]]. Some courts also require that an additional electronic courtesy copy be emailed to the other parties.&lt;ref name="oregon" /&gt;

=== Attorney fees ===
Before filing the complaint, it is important for [[plaintiff]]s to remember that Federal courts can impose liability for the prevailing party's attorney fees to the losing party, if the judge considers the case [[frivolous]] or for purposes of harassment, even when the case was voluntarily dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalrulesofcivilprocedure.org/frcp/title-vii-judgment/rule-54-judgment-costs/|title=FRCP Rule 54.

Vice, the U.S. Supreme Court held that reasonable attorneys' fees could be awarded to the defendant under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1988, but only for costs that the defendant would not have incurred "but for the frivolous claims." &lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4612481658703000905&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr|title=Fox v.

The '''conservation and restoration of photographic plates''' is the process of caring for and maintaining [[photographic plates]] in order to preserve their materials and content. It covers the necessary measures that can be taken by [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]], [[curators]], [[Collection manager|collections managers]], and other museum professionals to conserve the material unique to photographic plate processes. This practice includes understanding the composition and agents of deterioration of photographic plates, as well as the [[preventive conservation]] and [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|interventive conservation]] measures that can be taken to increase their longevity. 

__TOC__

==History==

===Composition===

The term [[photographic plates]] refers to a type of [[photograph]] that consists of an image bound to a [[glass]] support. Glass plates emerged as a common support medium for photographic negatives in the mid-nineteenth century. In general, [[Black and White Photography|black-and-white]] photographic negatives are made up of fine silver particles, (or color dyes for color negatives), which are embedded in a thin layer called a [[Binder (material)|binder]]. Combined with the image substance, these two elements make-up what is called the [[emulsion]]. This emulsion layer sits upon what is called the support, which can be paper, metal, film, or as in the case of photographic plates, [[glass]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valverde|first1=Maria Fernanda|title=Photographic Negatives: Nature and Evolution of Processes|url=https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/webfm_send/302|website=Image Permanence Institute|publisher=Advanced Residency Program in Photograph Conservation|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important part of the photographic process, "fixing," is used to wash the silver particles that are not part of the image, which then produces a stable negative image. This negative image can then be used over many years to produce paper positives. Glass plates as a form of support were popular in use between 1851 and the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Somerset Photography|title=Glass Negatives|url=http://www.somersetphotography.com/glass_negatives.htm|website=History of Photography|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Processes===

[[File:Early wet plate collodion portrait of lady -1 (4984137358).jpg|thumb|Early wet plate collodion portrait of lady]]
* '''Collodion glass plate negative:''' This process was invented by the Englishman [[Frederick Scott Archer]] in 1851. While the first process to take advantage of glass plates was an [[albumen]], it was quite laborious and quickly surpassed by the [[collodion]] glass plate negative in common use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paris Photo|title=Collodion Glass Plate Negative|url=https://www.parisphoto.com/en/Glossary/Collodion-Glass-Plate-Negative/|website=Paris Photo|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collodion photographic process was a wet place process, which meant that the glass plate itself had to be wet while it was exposed and throughout processing. This required a portable darkroom to be taken wherever a photographer went in order to successfully produce a negative image. During the process, the collodion was the binder which was poured onto the glass plate before being exposed. The glass plate was then [[developed]], [[Fixer (photography)|fixed]], [[Washing (photography)|washed]], and protected with a [[varnish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valverde|first1=Maria Fernanda|title=Photographic Negatives: Nature and Evolution of Processes|url=https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/webfm_send/302|website=Image Permanence Institute|publisher=Advanced Residency Program in Photograph Conservation|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Gelatin dry plate negative:''' This process was invented by [[Richard Leach Maddox]] in 1871, but it was not commonly used until 1878 when the process became commercially successful. Because of the advances this process made in photography, it soon replaced the [[wet plate process]] in the 1880s. The collodion binder formerly used was replaced by [[gelatin]] which already contained the light-sensitive silver salts. This meant that the emulsion was already present and did not have to be painted on the glass plate right before exposure - which now only took less than one second. Because of this advancement, photographers did not have to carry their portable darkroom, but could develop later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valverde|first1=Maria Fernanda|title=Photographic Negatives: Nature and Evolution of Processes|url=https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/webfm_send/302|website=Image Permanence Institute|publisher=Advanced Residency Program in Photograph Conservation|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1878 when further improvements were made to the gelatin emulsion, gelatin glass plates began being mass produced by companies such as Wratten &amp; Wainright, Keystone Dry Plate Works, and notably the [[Eastman Dry Plate Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valverde|first1=Maria Fernanda|title=Photographic Negatives: Nature and Evolution of Processes|url=https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/webfm_send/302|website=Image Permanence Institute|publisher=Advanced Residency Program in Photograph Conservation|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the advanced use and production of photographic glass plates until around 1925 and the development of the modern photography industry.

==Agents of deterioration== 

[[Photographic plates]] face certain challenges to their preservation. In order to protect against deterioration or damage, [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]] seek to identify the agents that threaten the various materials that make-up photographic glass plates. The primary agents of deterioration include the following:

===Relative humidity &amp; temperature===

[[Relative humidity]] (RH) and [[temperature]] are two of the most serious threats to photographic plates and can determine their longevity. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendriks|first1=Klaus B.|last2=Iraci|first2=Joe|title=Care of Black-and-White Photographic Glass Plate Negatives - Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 16/2|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/care-black-white-photographic-negatives-glass-plate.html|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other cultural collections, an overall high temperature in combination with high humidity can lead to mold growth as well as attract [[pest (organism)|pest]]s. Heat is also a danger to collections because it is an element that accelerates any type of chemical deterioration that occurs, specifically in photographic materials. 

Photographic plates face significant structural and chemical challenges unique to their makeup - Fluctuations in RH can strain the adhesion of the [[gelatin]] to the glass plate as changes can cause the gelatin to expand and contract as well as cause [[emulsion]] to crack or separate along the edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendriks|first1=Klaus B.|last2=Iraci|first2=Joe|title=Care of Black-and-White Photographic Glass Plate Negatives - Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 16/2|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/care-black-white-photographic-negatives-glass-plate.html|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, on a gelatin dry plate, high humidity can cause [[mold]] to grow on the emulsion and cause the plates to stick together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Casella|first1=Luisa|title=Gelatin Dry-plate|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Gelatin_Dry-plate|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing the relative humidity can cause deterioration of other elements as well such as the silver, [[varnish]], and glass support. Decreasing the RH will cause deterioration by leading to the flaking of the [[Binder (material)|binder]] and [[dehydration]] of the glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light===

Photographic plates, along with all photographic materials, are very sensitive to light. Extensive and ongoing exposure to light can cause significant deterioration that is irreversible. [[Sunlight]] is the most damaging type of light, but indoor lighting and any other [[UV light|UV lighting]] all pose a serious threat to photographic plates causing [[fading]] and [[yellowing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NEDCC Staff|title=5.3 Care of Photographs|url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/5.-photographs/5.3-care-of-photographs|website=NEDCC|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Light]] is especially threatening to [[Color photography|color photographic materials]] since it accelerates the fading of the color dyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Northeast Document Conservation Center|title=Storing Photograph Collections|url=https://www.nedcc.org/preservation101/session-5/5-storing-photograph-collections|website=NEDCC|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not uncommon for photographic plates to be hand-painted in order to produce color images. Exposure to light of colored glass slides could deteriorate and lead to discoloration of the [[pigments]].

===Air pollution===

[[Air pollution]] can pose a threat to photographic plates through poor [[air quality]] and [[dirt]] that can damage the materials. This can include [[dust]], gaseous pollution from an urban environment, and dirt particulate. Air pollution can cause fading of photographic materials as well as damage the surface of the image by causing an [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]]. Other sources of air pollution include "photocopying machines, construction materials, paint fumes, cardboard, carpets, and janitorial supplies," as well as other types of outdated or obsolete media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NEDCC Staff|title=5.3 Care of Photographs|url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/5.-photographs/5.3-care-of-photographs|website=NEDCC|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Material/chemical===

The glass composition of photographic plates can be a factor of deterioration. Due to poor quality or an [[Inherent_vice_(library_and_archival_science)|inherent vice]], "sick glass" can occur. Environmental conditions are usually linked to the increase or presence of this [[glass corrosion]]. The effect of "sick glass" can be weeping and [[crizzling]] which can be caused by excessive [[alkali]] present and a lack of [[stabilizers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weeping involves droplets forming on the glass that appear as small crystals. This type of deterioration is especially threatening for cased photographs because the cover glass could be corroded and damage the photographic image underneath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McElhone|first1=John P.|title=Cased photographs: Including Daguerreotypes, Ambrotypes (Collodion Positives), and Tintypes|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Cased_Photographs|website=AIC Wiki|publisher=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corrosion of the glass plate support can also damage the image layer by causing the lifting of the binder and varnish layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bahnemann|first1=Greta|title=The Preservation of Glass Plate Negatives|url=https://www.webjunction.org/documents/webjunction/The_Preservation_of_Glass_Plate_Negatives.html|website=Web Junction|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The other chemical components of glass plate negatives can also be threatening agents of deterioration. For instance, the silver image layer could possibly undergo [[Oxidation|oxidative deterioration]] which can lead to fading and discoloration. Additionally, the collodion binder itself is made up of [[cellulose nitrate]] which is known to be a flammable compound. While this is very dangerous as a film support, it is not thought to be as threatening in the binder. Most of these agents of deterioration are the result of poor chemical processing, but they are usually exacerbated by poor environmental and storage conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bahnemann|first1=Greta|title=The Preservation of Glass Plate Negatives|url=https://www.webjunction.org/documents/webjunction/The_Preservation_of_Glass_Plate_Negatives.html|website=Web Junction|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical===

Glass plates are rather stable dimensionally, but they are also very fragile and [[brittle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendriks|first1=Klaus B.|last2=Iraci|first2=Joe|title=Care of Black-and-White Photographic Glass Plate Negatives - Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 16/2|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/care-black-white-photographic-negatives-glass-plate.html|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because glass is brittle, it is highly susceptible to [[breakage]], [[Fracture|cracks]], and [[fractures]]. This can be caused by human error including dropping or bumping the glass plate, or it can be caused by failure of storage equipment, housing, shelves, etc. which may lead to an impact to the glass. 

Types of breakage:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
* Impact break - point of impact and surrounding radiating arcs
* Cracks - run perpendicular to applied stress
* Blind cracks - breaks do not carry through the whole shard of glass

Certain types of breakage and stress states affect the image layer and binder in different ways.

==Preventive conservation== 

===Environment===

Environmental controls are a crucial part of the preservation of photographic glass plates. [[Relative humidity]] (RH), [[temperature]], and [[light]] play a large role in keeping the multiple materials in photographic glass plates maintained. The following regulatory measures are taken for their preservation:

* For photographic glass plates, the temperature is kept cool at around 65°F approximately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Northeast Document Conservation Center|title=Storing Photograph Collections|url=https://www.nedcc.org/preservation101/session-5/5-storing-photograph-collections|website=NEDCC|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* RH levels are normally kept between 30-40%. If RH goes below 30%, the image binder of the glass plate will [[dehydrate]]. If RH goes above 40%, the glass will begin [[hydrate|hydrating]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For cased glass plate photographs, such as [[ambrotypes]], RH levels are kept between 40-50% and temperature between 65-68°F. These levels differ because of the case and its risk for [[embrittlement]], [[brass]] mat, and glass deterioration. 
* Fluctuations, also called “cycling,” in RH and temperature are sought to be avoided. Environmental fluctuations can contribute to [[mold growth]], chemical deterioration including discoloration and [[yellowing]], as well as deterioration of the emulsion. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Library of Congress|title=Care, Handling, and Storage of Photographs|url=https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/photolea.html#Structure|website=Library of Congress|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Photographic glass plates, especially [[Negative (photography)|negatives]], are preserved in dark enclosures due to their risk of deterioration when exposed to light, particularly [[UV light|UV]] and [[sunlight]]. If displayed, spot-lighting, which is uneven heating to the photographic plate, is avoided. Light levels are kept below 50 [[lux]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handling===

Photographic glass plates are handled carefully to avoid physical or chemical deterioration and damage – the following aids in their preservation through proper handling: 

* To prevent fingerprints, non-vinyl plastic gloves are worn when handling – either [[Latex]] or [[Nitrile]]. [[Cotton]] gloves are not recommended by [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]] due to the possibility of glass easily slipping from the cotton material. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* When handling, a glass plate is not held by one edge or corner, rather it is held by two opposite edges and always with two hands. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Archives|title=How Do I House Glass Plate Negatives?|url=https://www.archives.gov/preservation/storage/glass-plate-negatives.html|website=National Archives|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* When laying the glass plate on a flat surface, it is always placed with the [[emulsion]] side up. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Archives|title=How Do I House Glass Plate Negatives?|url=https://www.archives.gov/preservation/storage/glass-plate-negatives.html|website=National Archives|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Glass plates are never stacked or have any pressure placed upon them. The sleeve or enclosure is labeled before placing the glass plate inside. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Archives|title=How Do I House Glass Plate Negatives?|url=https://www.archives.gov/preservation/storage/glass-plate-negatives.html|website=National Archives|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Since glass plates are fragile and brittle, duplicates are created if a glass plate is used often for [[Photo printing|printing]]. This helps to minimize the threat of breakage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendriks|first1=Klaus B.|last2=Iraci|first2=Joe|title=Care of Black-and-White Photographic Glass Plate Negatives - Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 16/2|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/care-black-white-photographic-negatives-glass-plate.html|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storage=== 

Storage and housing of photographic glass plates is an important part of their preservation. [[Museums]] and other [[cultural institutions]] take the following measures to ensure their glass plates are properly housed: 

* Photographic glass plates are housed in four-flap enclosures, emulsion side up. These four-flap buffered enclosures prevent a glass plate from being pulled in and out and further deteriorating the image through flaking and [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasions]]. Rather, the four-flap enclosure allows the glass plate to be accessed by unfolding the flaps without having to pull the plate across any surface or material. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The photographic glass plates are stored vertically on the long side of the plate in [[acid]]- and [[lignin]]-free storage boxes. The glass plates are not packed too tightly and are sought not to rub against each other. Each one is usually separated individually with stiffeners made of acid-free folder stock or acid-free cardboard in order to support the plates. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gaylord Archival|title=Caring for Glass Plate Negatives|url=http://www.gaylord.com/resources/glass-plate-negative-storage|website=Gaylord Archival|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Photographic glass plates stored in a partially filled box will have spacers, most likely [[acid-free]] [[Corrugated fiberboard|corrugated]] [[paperboard]], inserted in order to prevent significant bumping or moving. 
* Glass plates that are larger than 10” x 12” are stored in legal size boxes that are partially filled to prevent a too heavy weight. The extra space in the box is filled with board or spacers to avoid shifting and jostling. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Storage boxes consisting of photographic glass plates are stored on a lower shelf, specifically below four feet. This helps to prevent someone from lifting them down from above his or her head. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Each storage box of photographic glass plates is labeled with words such as “Heavy,” “Handle with Care,” “Caution: Contains Glass Negatives,” so that everyone knows to be extra careful when lifting the box off a shelf. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gaylord Archival|title=Caring for Glass Plate Negatives|url=http://www.gaylord.com/resources/glass-plate-negative-storage|website=Gaylord Archival|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Storage of broken photographic plates====
 
Broken or cracked glass plates are stored in a special manner, separate from other photographic plates and in the following ways:

* Broken glass plates are not stacked but stored flat.
* Photographic glass plates that are cracked or have binder damage are stored on sink-mats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Northeast Document Conservation Center|title=Storing Photograph Collections|url=https://www.nedcc.org/preservation101/session-5/5-storing-photograph-collections|website=NEDCC|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with minor flaking are still housed in the four-flap enclosure that is labeled appropriately describing the damage. Glass plates with extensive flaking are stored on sink-mats horizontally and placed in a storage box with a label that reads “Caution: Broken glass. Carry Horizontally.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Broken glass plate shards are often “sandwiched” in between two pieces of buffered board and then placed inside the four-flap enclosure. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Archives|title=How Do I House Glass Plate Negatives?|url=https://www.archives.gov/preservation/storage/glass-plate-negatives.html|website=National Archives|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[American Institute for Conservation|AIC]] advises that form-fit support should be created for broken glass shards by cutting out two pieces of 4-ply [[mat board]] that fit to each shard. Then, these pieces are glued to each side of the buffered board with either [[wheat starch paste]] or 3M #415 double-stick tape. By placing each shard in between the form-fit support, this will help to prevent further damage. These broken shards are then placed in individual four-flap enclosures and stored flat with appropriate labeling that warns of their broken condition. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another method of storing broken shards is to place them on sink-mats. If this method is used, each piece is separated with paperboard spacers to prevent the pieces from touching. These paperboard spacers are sometimes attached with [[adhesives]] to the mat so that physical damage does not occur to the shards. They are stored horizontally and placed in a storage box with a label that reads “Caution: Broken glass. Carry Horizontally.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maintenance/housekeeping===

Maintenance/[[housekeeping]] of photographic plates requires minimal intervention: 

* For their preservation, light cleaning is carried out occasionally by removing dust with a soft brush. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendriks|first1=Klaus B.|last2=Iraci|first2=Joe|title=Care of Black-and-White Photographic Glass Plate Negatives - Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 16/2|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/care-black-white-photographic-negatives-glass-plate.html|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

* [[Conservator-restorer|Conservators]] also keep the surrounding collections area clean of [[dust]], [[pest (organism)|pest]]s, and any other debris that may attract pests. Also, food and drink is not permitted in the storage area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|title=Caring for Your Treasures|url=https://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/caring-for-your-treasures/photographs#.WsLQ8MPwbIU|website=AIC|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent deterioration from [[air pollutants]], it is helpful for conservators to have the air entering the storage area [[filtered]] and purified, windows closed, [[obsolete]]/outdated media minimized, and enclosures and cabinets used to protect collection objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NEDCC Staff|title=5.3 Care of Photographs|url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/5.-photographs/5.3-care-of-photographs|website=NEDCC|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation treatment==

Broken or cracked glass plates make up a large portion of those in need of [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation treatment]]. There are various actions taken in reassembling and restoring these plates using the following materials and methods: 

'''[[Adhesives]]:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (There is no one ideal adhesive to be used)
* [[Paraloid B-72]] - A solution of 50-70% B-72 in a solvent with added [[silica]] is used to reassemble glass plate fragments. It takes 1-2 hours to dry. One issue with this adhesive is that it creates "snowflakes" in between the pieces making an invisible reassembly impossible.
* [[Epoxy resin]] - This adhesive is thought to be very strong and has low shrinkage. An issue with this method is that it yellows over time and is not advisable to be used on glass plates with a collodion binder. This is due to the potential damage to the collodion binder of the reversibility method. 
* [[Cyanoacrylates]] - This adhesive bonds strongly with [[alkaline]] surfaces but is very brittle and only used for temporary repairs.

'''Application:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Wicking]] - This is used by [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]] to apply the adhesive to the glass with a wooden or glass applicator. A [[capillary]] tube or bottle is used to put the appropriate amount of adhesive on the glass shard without excess. 

'''Backing material:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Silpat™ sheet - This is made of [[silicone]] and [[fibreglass]]; textured and provides air pockets to prevent damage from capillary application; it does not create trauma for the [[emulsion]] side of the glass. 
* Secondary support is used for glass plates broken into many pieces or over 5 x 7 inches in size - A second piece of glass is used with silicone as a material to be inserted as a barrier layer.

'''Repair methods &amp; techniques:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[PhotoShop |PhotoShop Software]] assembly - Virtually assembling broken glass shards through Photoshop by scanning or photographing all pieces is used by [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]]. This helps to avoid further damage and deterioration of the glass plate photograph. 
* Inclined assembly - This method involves applying an adhesive to the glass shard interfaces and assembling them on an inclined surface covered with [[Mylar]] or Silpat™. The glass shards are reassembled either by direct application, which involves applying the adhesive directly to the shard interface and attaching it to its corresponding piece; or they are assembled through wicking where the adhesive is applied to the shard interface through capillary action. 
* Vertical assembly - This method is used because of the manner in which the glass shards fit back together, which is the most accurate vertically. This also helps to protect the side of the binder layer. When assembling the pieces vertically, pressure sensitive plastic tape or sticky wax is used to hold the pieces together. The adhesive is not applied until all of the pieces are assembled - this helps to recognize any misalignment before they are adhered together. As the last step, the adhesive is applied through wicking. 
* Light-line - This is often used to insure all of the pieces are aligned. A light-line creates a straight line of light that allows a [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] to see any misalignment by producing a crooked line. Once the pieces are aligned, the light-line will be straight again.

'''The Glass Plate Negative Project at the Heritage Conservation Centre'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tay|first1=Jam Meng|title=The Glass Plate Negative Project at the Heritage Conservation Centre|url=http://resources.conservation-us.org/pmgtopics/2013-volume-fifteen/17-T15_Tay.pdf|website=AIC|publisher=The American Institute for Conservation of Historic &amp; Artistic Works|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The vertical assembly method along with a light-line is used in [http://resources.conservation-us.org/pmgtopics/2013-volume-fifteen/17-T15_Tay.pdf The Glass Plate Negative Project at the Heritage Conservation Centre] as outlined in the [[case study]]. This study shows how [[conservators]] deal with other conservation issues as well including accretions and residue. 
* For instance, while the plates were considered structurally stable, they may have needed surface cleaning. This was completed by using [[Cotton swab|swab]]s dampened with water/ethanol solutions in order to reduce [[stain]]s or do away with any left tape residue.
* Pressure sensitive labels were removed mechanically. 
* [[Conservator-restorer|Conservators]] used Whatman lens tissues to wipe off any other residue marks.

      <comment>I've added info on who uses FAST and also the new committee that has just been established. I am on this committee and we want to make sure that the FAST entry on Wikipedia is up-to-date. It still needs more work but this is a start.</comment>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4915">'''Faceted Application of Subject Terminology''' ('''FAST''') is a general use [[controlled vocabulary]] based on the [[Library of Congress Subject Headings]] (LCSH). FAST is developed as a part of [[WorldCat]] by the [[OCLC|Online Computer Library Center, Inc.]] (OCLC), with the goal of making subject cataloging less costly and easier to implement in online contexts. FAST headings separate [[Subject (documents)|topical]] data from non-topical data, such as information about a document's form, chronological coverage, or geographical coverage.&lt;ref name=chan&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chan|first1=Lois Mai|last2=Childress|first2=Eric|last3=Dean|first3=Rebecca|last4=O'Neill|first4=Edward T.|last5=Vizine-Goek|first5=Diane|title=A Faceted Approach to Subject Data in the Dublin Core Metadata Record|journal=Journal of Internet Cataloging|date=1 January 2001|volume=4|issue=1/2|pages=35–47|doi=10.1300/J141v04n01_05|authorlink=Lois Mai Chan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike LCSH, which are [[pre-coordinated]], FAST headings are [[post-coordinated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Library of Congress Subject Headings: Pre- vs. Post-Coordination and Related Issues|url=http://loc.gov/catdir/cpso/pre_vs_post.pdf|website=Cataloging Policy and Support Office|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=9 June 2014|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
OCLC has been developing FAST since 1998, and originally intended the system to describe Web resources in simple metadata schemata, particularly [[Dublin Core]].&lt;ref name=chan /&gt;
FAST separates headings into eight distinct facets: topical, geographic, personal name, corporate name, form, chronological, title as subject, and meeting name.&lt;ref name=jin&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jin|first1=Qiang|title=Is FAST the Right Direction for a New System of Subject Cataloging and Metadata?|journal=Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly|date=18 January 2008|volume=45|issue=3|pages=91–110|doi=10.1300/J104v45n03_08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each facet can be mapped to a specific Dublin Core element. For example, the geographic facet can be mapped to the ''coverage'' element in the basic Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, and to the ''coverage.geographic'' element in qualified Dublin Core.

In keeping with Dublin Core's simplicity, FAST headings are meant to be "simple and easy to apply and to comprehend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=Rebecca J.|title=FAST: Development of Simplified Headings for Metadata|journal=Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly|volume=39|issue=1-2|pages=331–352|doi=10.1300/J104v39n01_03|url=http://www.wip.oclc.org/content/dam/research/activities/fast/international_auth200302.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate subject assignment, OCLC has developed a tool called ''assignFast''. This tool uses an [[autocomplete]] feature to assist catalogers with the details of FAST headings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bennett|first1=Rick|last2=O'Neill|first2=Edward T.|last3=Kammerer|first3=Kerre|title=assignFAST: An Autosuggest based tool for FAST Subject Assignment|journal=Information Technology and Libraries|date=25 March 2014|volume=33|issue=1|doi=10.6017/ital.v33i1.5378|url=http://ejournals.bc.edu/ojs/index.php/ital/article/view/5378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OCLC has published FAST as [[linked data]] under an Open Data Commons Attribution (ODC-By) License.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAST Linked Data|url=http://experimental.worldcat.org/fast/|website=OCLC Experimental|publisher=OCLC|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Organisations using the FAST vocabulary include:'''

[[Analysis &amp; Policy Observatory|Analysis &amp; Policy Observatory (APO)]]

[[British Library]]

[[Harvard University]]

Informit

[[National Library of New Zealand]]

The FAST Policy and Outreach Committee (FPOC) was established in 2018. 

==Details==
The FAST authority file contains over 1,700,000 authority records.

==Reception==
FAST's chronological periods have been critiqued as making little sense outside the context of full LCSH.&lt;ref name=jin /&gt;  An OCLC study showed that several libraries that had adopted FAST were impressed by its "ease of use, simple syntax, [and] suitability for use by non-specialist staff."  However, several libraries in the same study were discouraged by a lack of communication with OCLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|last1=Mixter|first1=Jeffery|last2=Childress|first2=Eric|title=FAST (Faceted Application of Subject Terminology) Users Summary and Case Studies|url=http://www.oclc.org/content/dam/research/publications/library/2013/2013-04.pdf|publisher=OCLC Research|accessdate=9 June 2014|format=PDF|location=Dublin, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Raymond Wagner''' (March 24, 1915 – December 26, 1963) was an American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] best known by his [[ring name]] '''Gorgeous George'''. In the United States, during the First Golden Age of Professional Wrestling in the 1940s–1950s, Gorgeous George gained mainstream popularity and became one of the biggest stars of this period, gaining media attention for his outrageous character, which was described as flamboyant and charismatic.&lt;ref&gt;Thesz, Lou, with Kit Bauman, ''Hooker, An Authentic Wrestler's Adventures Inside the Bizarre World of Professional Wrestling, Mike Chapman, Editor (TWC-Press, 2000), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; He was posthumously inducted into the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum|Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]] in 2002 and the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] as part of the Class of 2010.

==Early life==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
Wagner, of German-American heritage, was born March 24, 1915 in [[Butte, Nebraska]]. For a time, his family lived on a farm near the village of Phoenix in Holt County and probably in Seward County before they moved to [[Waterloo, Iowa]] and later [[Sioux City, Iowa|Sioux City]]. When George was 7 years old, his family moved to [[Houston, Texas]], where he associated with kids from a tough neighborhood. As a child, he trained at the local [[YMCA]] and often staged matches against his friends.

In 1929, he dropped out of [[Milby High School]] at 14, and worked odd jobs to help support his family. At this time, he competed at carnivals, where he could earn 35 cents for a win. By age 17, he was getting booked by the region's top promoter, Morris Siegel, and in 1938, he won his first title by defeating Buck Lipscomb for Northwest Middleweight crown. Moreover, on May 19, 1939, he captured the Pacific Coast Light Heavyweight Championship.

==Career==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
At 5&amp;nbsp;ft 9 in and 215 pounds (1.75 m and 98&amp;nbsp;kg), Wagner was not particularly physically imposing by professional wrestling standards, nor was he an exceptionally gifted athlete, although he was a gifted [[amateur wrestler]]. Nevertheless, he soon developed a reputation as a solid in-ring wrestler. In the late 1930s, he met Elizabeth "Betty" Hanson, whom he would eventually marry in an in-ring ceremony. When the wedding proved a good drawing card, the couple re-enacted it in arenas across the country (which thus enlightened Wagner to the potential entertainment value that was left untapped within the industry). Around this same time, ''Vanity Magazine'' published a feature article about a professional wrestler named 'Lord' Patrick Lansdowne, who entered the ring accompanied by two valets while wearing a velvet robe and doublet. Wagner was impressed with the bravado of such a character, but he believed that he could take it to a much greater extreme. What he needed was a new professional persona.

Later, in [[Portland, Oregon]], Betty (George's wife) told Dean Higinbotham, the nephew of Betty's sister, Evangeline "Eva", how George got the name Gorgeous George. In the early 1940s George had a wrestling match at the Portland Oregon Armory.  As he walked down the aisle to the ring, there were two mature women on his right, two rows back from the ring. One of the women loudly exclaimed, "Oh, isn't he gorgeous."  That word "gorgeous" struck George and he immediately felt he had found his new professional persona.  He would be "Gorgeous George".  As Elsie Hanson, Betty's mother, was a skilled seamstress, George asked her to make him some resplendent capes that would accentuate his new persona. George wore those capes in all his future matches.

Subsequently, George debuted his new "glamour boy" image on a 1941 card in Eugene, Oregon; and he quickly antagonized the fans with his exaggerated effeminate behavior when the ring announcer introduced him as "Gorgeous George". Such showmanship was unheard of for the time; and consequently, arena crowds grew in size as fans turned out to ridicule George (who relished the sudden attention).
[[File:Gorgeous George wrestler circa 1940s.JPG|thumb|180px|Photo postcard of Gorgeous George, "the Human Orchid" and the "Toast of the Coast", circa 1940s.]]
Gorgeous George was soon recruited to Los Angeles by promoter Johnny Doyle.  Known as the "Human Orchid", his persona was created in part by growing his hair long, dyeing it platinum blonde, and putting gold-plated bobby pins in it (which he called "Georgie Pins" and distributed to the audience). Furthermore, he transformed his ring entrance into a bona-fide spectacle that would often take up more time than his actual matches.  He strolled nobly to the ring to the sounds of "[[Pomp and Circumstance Marches|Pomp and Circumstance]]", followed by his valet and a purple spotlight. Wearing an elegant robe sporting an array of sequins, Gorgeous George was always escorted down a personal red carpet by his ring valet "Jeffries", who would carry a silver mirror while spreading rose petals at his feet. While George removed his robe, Jeffries would spray the ring with disinfectant, ostensibly [[Chanel No. 5]] perfume, which George referred to as "Chanel #10" ("Why be half-safe?" he was famous for saying) before he would start wrestling. Moreover, George required that his valets spray the referee's hands before the official was allowed to check him for any illegal objects, which thus prompted his now-famous outcry "Get your filthy hands off me!" Once the match finally began, he would cheat in every way he could. Gorgeous George was the industry's first true cowardly villain, and he would cheat at every opportunity, which infuriated the crowd. His credo was "Win if you can, lose if you must, but always cheat!" This flamboyant image and his showman's ability to work a crowd were so successful in the early days of [[television]] that he became the most famous wrestler of his time, drawing furious [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] [[Heat (professional wrestling)|heat]] wherever he appeared.

It was with the advent of television, however, that George's character exploded into the biggest drawing card the industry had ever known. With the networks looking for cheap, effective programming to fill its time slots, pro wrestling's glorified action became a genuine hit with the viewing public, as it was the first program of any kind to draw a real profit. Consequently, it was Gorgeous George who brought the sport into the nation's living rooms, as his histrionics and melodramatic behavior made him a larger-than-life figure in American pop-culture. His first television appearance took place on November 11, 1947 (an event that was recently named among the top 100 televised acts of the 20th century by [[Entertainment Weekly]]) and he immediately became a national celebrity at the same level of [[Lucille Ball]] and [[Bob Hope]] (who personally donated hundreds of chic robes for George's collection) while changing the course of the industry forever. No longer was pro wrestling simply about the in-ring action, but George had created a new sense of theatrics and character performance that had not previously existed. Moreover, in a very real sense, it was Gorgeous George who single-handedly established television as a viable entertainment medium that could potentially reach millions of homes across the country.  It is said that George was probably responsible for selling as many television receivers as [[Milton Berle]].

In addition to his grandiose theatrics, Gorgeous George was an accomplished wrestler.  While many may have considered him a mere [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick wrestler]], he was actually a very competent freestyle wrestler, having started learning the sport in [[amateur wrestling]] as a teenager, and he could handle himself quite well if it came to a legitimate contest. The great [[Lou Thesz]], who would take the AWA title away from Wagner, and who was one of the best "[[Legit (professional wrestling)|legit]]" wrestlers ever in professional wrestling, displayed some disdain for the gimmick wrestlers. Nevertheless, he admitted that Wagner "could wrestle pretty well", but added that, "he [Wagner] could never draw a fan until he became Gorgeous George."

[[File:Gorgeous George attempting to pin cph.3d02360.jpg|thumb|George attempting to pin another wrestler during a match, 1949]]
On March 26, 1947, he defeated [[Enrique Torres]] to capture the Los Angeles Heavyweight Championship. Then on February 22, 1949, George was booked as the feature attraction at [[New York City]]'s [[Madison Square Garden]] in what would be pro wrestling's first return to the building in 12 years. By the 1950s, Gorgeous George's star power was so huge that he was able to command 50% of the gate for his performances, which allowed him to earn over $100,000 a year, thus making him one of the highest paid athletes in the world. Moreover, on May 26, 1950, Gorgeous George defeated [[Don Eagle]] to claim the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship (Boston version)]], which he held for several months. During this reign he was beaten by the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] World Champion [[Lou Thesz]] in a highly publicized bout in [[Chicago]]. However, perhaps Gorgeous George's most famous match was against his longtime rival [[Whipper Billy Watson]] on March 12, 1959, in which a beaten George had his treasured golden locks shaved bald before 20,000 delighted fans at [[Toronto]]'s [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] and millions more on national television.

In one of his final matches, Gorgeous George later faced off against (and lost to) an up-and-coming [[Bruno Sammartino]], though he would lose his precious hair again when he was defeated by [[Dick Beyer|the Destroyer]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Luchas de Apuestas|hair vs. mask match]] at the [[Grand Olympic Auditorium|Olympic Auditorium]] on November 7, 1962. This was his final match, as he was nearly 50 years old and suffering from the effects of alcoholism. In 2002, he was inducted into the inaugural class of the Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame (PWHF.org) by a committee of his peers. On March 27, he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2010. His 97-year-old former wife, Betty Wagner accepted the honor on his behalf, answering questions and telling the story of how he became Gorgeous George.

==Retirement and death==
{{one source|section|date=June 2016}}
As his wrestling career wound down, Wagner invested {{USD|250,000}} in a {{convert|195|acre|km2|adj=on}} turkey ranch built in [[Beaumont, California]], and the wrestler used his showman skills to promote his prized poultry at his wrestling matches and sport shows, popular during his heyday. He raised [[Domesticated turkey|turkeys]] and owned a cocktail lounge in [[Van Nuys, California]], which he named "Gorgeous George's Ringside Restaurant".

Wagner was diagnosed with [[liver cirrhosis]] in 1962 and so his doctors ordered him to retire from wrestling. This, combined with financial troubles which stemmed from a recent divorce, worsened his health. He suffered a heart attack on December 24, 1963, and died two days later, at age 48. According to [[Lanny Poffo]], [[Angelo Poffo]], who credited Wagner for motivating his wrestling career, paid for his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|url=https://soundcloud.com/piperspit/pp-ep64-lannypoffo|title=Piper's Pit Episode 64 &amp;ndash; Macho Man remembered by his brother "The Genius" AKA Lanny Poffo|publisher=PodcastOne|host=[[Roddy Piper|R.G. Toombs]]|time=11:04|date=July 13, 2015|access-date=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plaque at his gravesite reads "Love to our Daddy Gorgeous George".

==Legacy==
[[File:Gorgeous George robe.jpg|thumb|George pictured in 1954]]
[[Muhammad Ali]] and [[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]] acknowledged that their own approach to flamboyant self-promotion was influenced by George. A 19 year old Ali met a 46 year old George at a Las Vegas radio station. During George's radio interview, the wrestler's promo caught the attention of the future heavyweight champion. If George lost to Classy [[Freddie Blassie]], George exclaimed, "I'll crawl across the ring and cut my hair off! But that's not gonna happen because I'm the greatest wrestler in the world!" Ali, who later echoed that very promo when taunting opponent [[Sonny Liston]], recalled, "I saw 15,000 people comin' to see this man get beat. And his talking did it. I said, 'This is a gooood idea!'" In the locker room afterward, the seasoned wrestler gave the future legend some invaluable advice: "A lot of people will pay to see someone shut your mouth. So keep on bragging, keep on sassing and always be outrageous."&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{cite web|url=//sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1114630/index.htm |title=King Strut |author=John Capouya |publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]] |accessdate=2008-05-04 |date=December 12, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603232105/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1114630/index.htm |archivedate=June 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, the first full-length biography of Gorgeous George was published by HarperEntertainment Press. The title of the 304 page book is ''Gorgeous George: The Outrageous Bad Boy Wrestler who Created American Pop Culture'' by John Capouya. In the 2005 book ''I Feel Good: A Memoir in a Life of Soul'', [[James Brown]] said he used many of Gorgeous George's antics to "create the James Brown you see on stage".&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

[[Bob Dylan]] said meeting George changed his life. In Dylan's book ''The Chronicles: Volume One'', Dylan recounts a story of meeting Gorgeous George in person. He wrote, "He winked and seemed to mouth the phrase, 'You're making it come alive.' I never forgot it. It was all the recognition and encouragement I would need for years."&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dylan"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/05/entertainment/main647383.shtml|title=Bob Dylan Tells All (Almost)|work=Associated Press|publisher=CBS.com|accessdate=2008-05-04|date=2004-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1951 [[Warner Brothers]] ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' [[cartoon]] ''[[Bunny Hugged]]'' featured the one-shot character "Ravishing Ronald", modeled after Gorgeous George. [[The Bowery Boys]] also lampooned Gorgeous George (with [[Huntz Hall]] as a much-heralded wrestler) in the 1952 feature ''[[No Holds Barred (1952 film)|No Holds Barred]]''. Musical performers such as [[Liberace]], [[Little Richard]], [[Elton John]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Morris Day]] show signs of the George [[meme]].

The 1978 motion picture ''[[The One and Only (1978 film)|The One and Only]]'' starring [[Henry Winkler]] was loosely based on his career.

The Simpsons episode "[[Gorgeous Grampa]]" was partially based on Gorgeous George's career.

==Other media==
Gorgeous George appeared in one motion picture, ''[[Alias the Champ]]'', made in 1949.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Kredo, a Swiss DJ, named one of his Cells EP tracks 'Gorgeous George', as a tribute to the wrestler.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

He was parodied in the 1951 [[Bugs Bunny]] cartoon ‘Bunny Hugged’ as ‘Ravishing Ronald’.

==Personal life==
Wagner was married twice. First to Betty Hanson (1913–2011), whom he married in 1939 in [[Eugene, Oregon]] inside a wrestling ring.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; They adopted two children. In 1951, after divorcing Betty, he married Cherie Dupré (1927–2000). By this marriage, he had one biological son, Gary George. His son had one daughter, Amanda George who gave birth to three daughters, Wagner's only biological great-granddaughters. Cheri filed for divorce from George in April 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H-6DoPuiRkEC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=gorgeous+george+1962+divorce&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FeFXqL-wAN&amp;sig=gUOy_KcTDUl9ndYCZGUOYOAQ0FQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwigoozTur3PAhXIy4MKHZCUCUAQ6AEIOjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=gorgeous%20george%201962%20divorce&amp;f=false|title=The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Heels|last=Oliver|first=Greg|last2=Johnson|first2=Steven|publisher=ECW Press|year=2007|isbn=1550227599|location=Toronto|pages=27|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; George also had a son whom he named Gorgeous George in 1946 by an extramarital relationship.

His grand-nephew [[Robert Kellum]] later wrestled as "Gorgeous George III" in the [[United States Wrestling Association]]. George's first wife Betty died on June 3, 2011 at the age of 98.

'''Hantu Air''', '''Puaka Air''' or '''Mambang Air''' is the [[Malay language|Malay]] translation for  ''Spirit of the Water'', which according to [[animist]] traditions in [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], is the unseen inhabitant of watery places such as rivers, lakes, seas, swamps and even ditches associated with bad things happening to people which includes drowning, missing, flooding and many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mgYQ4Cl16OkC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=hantu+air&amp;hl=en#v=snippet&amp;q=hantu%20laut&amp;f=false |title=Malay Magic |publisher=Books.google.com.my |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
For a long time animism was widely practiced in [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] and people tended to associate almost anything with the spiritual world including nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIUmU2ytmIIC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=animism+Malay+Archipelago&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=animism&amp;f=false |title=Cheng Ho and Islam in Southeast Asia By Tan Ta Sen, Dasheng Chen |publisher=Books.google.com.my |date=2009-10-19 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hantu Air is used to explain any sickness or death associated with watery areas that cannot be otherwise explained.{{cn|date=August 2013}} Some people believe that spirits discarded by their previous owners will haunt places associated with water. The unguided and lost spirit roams the area and feeds on anything available, including humans.

Superstitions arising among the locals tell of this evil spirit dwelling in watery places where it sometimes disguises itself as an old tree trunk, a beautiful lady, fish or other animals in order to lure people into its trap. When caught the human will be eaten or drowned.

Currently, deaths near watery areas are attributed to outbreaks of [[Leptospirosis|Leptospirosis,]] instead of Hantu Air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://testsite.internalinsider.info/mobile/malaysia/article/rat-urine-disease-three-recreational-spots-closed-temporarily/ Rat urine disease: Three recreational spots closed temporarily - malaysian Insider]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hospital.com.my/diseases/Rat_Urine_Disease.htm http://hospital.com.my/diseases/Rat_Urine_Disease.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary customs ==
A ceremony called [[Semah Pantai]] was once popular among local older Malays, especially in the East Coast of [[Malaysia]]. It is a ceremony whereby fishermen and seafarers honor the sea spirits and ask for blessings and protection when they fish at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wsZuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Semah+Pantai&amp;dq=Semah+Pantai&amp;hl=en |title=Malay folk beliefs: an integration of disparate elements, Mohd.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2044">'''HRHD (high-resolution high-definition)''' (also '''HR''', '''HRHDTV''', or '''HR.HDTV''') is an [[Acronym and initialism|initialism]] referring to an [[image resolution]] derived from [[high-definition video]], often seen as part of the [[filename]] of TV shows shared on the Internet. HRHD is an unofficial standard of [[codec|encoding video]], meaning that the video signal was [[ripping|ripped]] directly from a [[High-definition television|HDTV]] broadcast, then [[downsampling|downsampled]] to approximately 960 × 540, and usually encoded with [[Xvid]]. While the horizontal resolution of 960 remains constant the vertical resolution can fluctuate up to 5% to provide clean cropping. It is sometimes erroneously referred to as ''Half''-Resolution High-Definition.

Encoding for a 40–55-minute HRHD TV show should be approximately 700 MB, the size of a [[compact disc]]. It contains the original [[Dolby Digital|AC3]] sound, which is often [[surround sound|5.1 channels]], instead of the re-encoded [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] [[MP3]] stream found in 350MB releases.

==History==
The HRHD format began in late 2003 when the TV capture group FUA began distributing what they termed "HRHDTV rips" on the private [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] sites of [[Warez (scene)|The Scene]].  The group defined what HRHDTV is in their [[.nfo]], a small text file included with releases to give information specific to the release.

There has often been a misconception about the name.  Some mistakenly think the term means ''half-resolution high-definition''.  HRHD resolution is actually ¾ height and width of [[720p]]  video.  By area, the picture is 56.25% of the typical 720p HD broadcast.  The HRHD dimensions are precisely half of [[1080p]] video, but this yields only 25% of the original 1080p picture information.

The outbreak of the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] was followed by accusations of [[human rights]] violations by rebel forces opposed to [[Muammar Gaddafi]], [[Libyan Army (1951–2011)|Gaddafi's armed forces]], and [[NATO]]. The alleged violations include [[rape]], [[extrajudicial killing]]s, [[ethnic cleansing]], [[misconduct]] and bombings of civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shabi|first=Rachel|title=Nato accused of war crimes in Libya|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/nato-accused-of-war-crimes-in-libya-6291566.html|accessdate=23 January 2012|work=[[The Independent]]|date=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Libyan Armed Forces==

=== Claims of systematic shooting at protesters ===
[[Luis Moreno Ocampo]], chief prosecutor of the [[International Criminal Court]], estimated that between 500 and 700 people were killed by Gaddafi's security forces in February 2011, before the rebels even took up arms. "Shooting at protesters was systematic," Moreno-Ocampo stated, discussing the Libyan government's response to the initial anti-government demonstrations.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/05/world/africa/05nations.html?ref=world | work= [[The New York Times]] |author1=Simons, Marlise |author2=MacFarquhar, Neil | title=Libyan Officials' Arrests Sought by Court in Hague | date= 4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Libyan government denied that they ordered killings of demonstrators in the early days of the uprising. They said that soldiers acted in self-defense as they were attacked by mobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Video | date = 1 July 2011 | title=Gaddafi's Son: Libya Like McDonald's for NATO&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Fast War as Fast Food|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMugPQC4ZY| format = requires [[Adobe Flash]]; 0:12:48 | publisher = [[RT (TV network)|RT]] (via [[YouTube]]) |accessdate= 11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreno-Ocampo further stated that during the conflict, "War crimes are apparently committed as a matter of policy" by forces loyal to Gaddafi.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;
This is further supported by claims of Human Rights Watch, that 10 protesters, who had already agreed to lay down arms, were executed by a government paramilitary group in [[Bani Walid]] in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/08/18/libya-10-protesters-apparently-executed/ | publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]] | title=Libya: 10 Protesters apparently executed | date= 18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, an investigation carried out by Amnesty International claimed that allegations of use of anti-aircraft guns against crowds lack evidence, noting that rebels at times appeared to have made false claims or manufactured evidence. The used cartridges after protesters were shot at "came from Kalashnikovs or similar calibre weapons". According to the Amnesty investigation, "there is no proof of mass killing of civilians on the scale of Syria or Yemen", adding that in Bengazi 100 to 110 people were killed, and in Baida 59 to 64 people were killed. Most of these were probably protesters, and some might have had weapons.&lt;ref name="amnesty_investigation"/&gt;

However, in a later report from Amnesty International it was found that "al-Gaddafi forces committed serious violations of international humanitarian law (IHL), including war crimes, and gross human rights violations,which point to the commission of crimes against humanity. They deliberately killed and injured scores of unarmed protesters; subjected perceived opponents and critics to enforced disappearance and torture and other ill-
treatment; and arbitrarily detained scores of civilians. They launched indiscriminate attacks and attacks targeting civilians in their efforts to regain control of Misratah and territory in the east. They launched artillery, mortar and rocket attacks against residential areas. They used inherently indiscriminate weapons such as anti-personnel land mines and cluster bombs,including in residential areas."&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, The Battle for Libya: Killings, Disappearances and Torture, 13 September 2011, MDE 19/025/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]] had an interview with ''[[RT (TV Network)|Russia Today]]'', where he denied the ICC's allegations that he or his father ordered the killing of civilian protesters. He contended that as he was not a member of the government or the military, he therefore had no authority to give such orders. According to Saif, he made recorded calls to General [[Abdul Fatah Younis]] (who later defected to the rebel forces) to request that force not be used against protesters, to which Younis responded that they were attacking a military site, where surprised guards fired in self-defense.&lt;ref name="rt_interview"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gaddafi's son: Libya like McDonald's for NATO - fast war as fast food|url=http://rt.com/news/interview-gaddafi-libya-usa/|accessdate=25 October 2011|date=1 July 2011|work=[[Russia Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=David|title=Gaddafi's son claims Nato wants deal with Libya|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/01/gaddafi-son-nato-libya-deal|accessdate=29 October 2011|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=1 July 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allegations of mass rape ===
{{main|2011 Libyan rape allegations}}
A Libyan psychologist, Siham Sergewa, conducted a survey of refugees in [[Tunisia]] and [[Egypt]] to document the trauma of the civil war.  Nearly 300 women were reported to have been raped.  The real number could be much higher, considering the stigma attached to rape victims in Libyan society.  Every single woman in the survey who admitted to being raped said they were raped by loyalist soldiers or militiamen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/05/23/libya.rape.survey.psychologist/ | work = [[CNN]] | title=Psychologist: Proof of Hundreds of Rape Cases During Libya's War | date= 23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[United Nations]] [[war crime|war-crimes expert]] [[M. Cherif Bassiouni]], [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW), [[Doctors Without Borders]] and [[Amnesty International]] say that they have found no evidence of systematic rape conducted by the Libyan government. Amnesty International's Donatella Rovera said that the Benghazi rebels had knowingly made false claims or manufactured evidence, quoting one example of pristine boxes of [[Viagra]] that the rebels said were found inside a totally burned out tank belonging to Gaddafi's troops. This raised serious doubts about the claim that Gaddafi handed out Viagra to his soldiers to enable them to rape more efficiently.&lt;ref name="amnesty_investigation"&gt;{{cite news| author = Cockburn, Patrick|title=Amnesty Questions Claim That Gaddafi Ordered Rape as Weapon of War|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/amnesty-questions-claim-that-gaddafi-ordered-rape-as-weapon-of-war-2302037.html| work = [[The Independent]] | accessdate=3 July 2011|date=24 June 2011| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-06/rape-as-weapon-of-war-is-un-focus-after-libyan-woman-s-plight.html|title=Rape as Weapon of War Is UN Focus|work= [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=  6 July 2011|first1=Flavia|last1=Krause-Jackson|first2=Caroline|last2=Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = [[M.

[[Physicians for Human Rights]] (PHR) collected testimony of eyewitness who reported that pro-Gaddafi forces transformed an elementary school into a detention site where they raped women and girls as young as 14 years old.&lt;ref name="Witness"&gt;Physicians for Human Rights. "Witness to War Crimes: Evidence from Misrata, Libya." https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_Reports/Libya-WitnesstoWarCrimes-Aug2011.pdf. Retrieved 2.28.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  PHR also  reports of honor killings that occurred in response to these rapes.&lt;ref name="Witness" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liz Hazelton.

=== Use of land mines as a means of war ===
[[Human Rights Watch]] has confirmed claims of rebels, that pro-Gaddafi forces used [[land mine]]s frequently during the conflict. It found them on at least six different locations in Libya, mostly on frontlines of the Gaddafi forces. Among these land mines are not only anti-tank mines, but also anti-personnel mines, which can permanently pose a threat to civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/06/21/libya-government-using-landmines-nafusa-mountains/ | publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]] | title=Government Using Landmines in Nafusa Mountains | date= 21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shelling of civilian areas ===
Gaddafi forces have been accused by human-rights groups of shelling towns with heavy weapons, risking civilian lives indiscriminately. The most accusations refer to the [[siege of Misrata]], accusing Gaddafi forces of targeting hospitals and civilian areas, also using internationally outlawed cluster bombs of Spanish production as ammunition, having risked the lives of civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/04/10/libya-government-attacks-misrata-kill-civilians/ | publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]] | title=Libya: Government Attacks in Misrata Kill Civilians | date= 10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other abuses of non-combatants ===
A Human Rights Watch report documents the "unlawful occupation and terror of hospital staff" by pro-Government forces in Yafran in the western mountains, risking the lives of the patients and terrifying the staff contrary to international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/06/29/libya-gaddafi-forces-occupy-hospital-terrify-patients-and-staff/ | publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]] | title=Libya: Gaddafi Forces Occupy Hospital, Terrify Patients and Staff | date= 29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, Physicians for Human Rights released a report documenting severe violations of human rights and evidence of war crimes and possible crimes against humanity in Misrata.  Findings included that Qaddafi forces used civilians as human shields, attacked ambulances bearing the [[Red Crescent]], destroyed religious buildings, and intentionally starved civilians.  In the same report, PHR gave evidence to violations of [[medical neutrality]], such as attacks on medical facilities, medical transport, and medical workers.&lt;ref name="Witness" /&gt;

===Crimes against international humanitarian law===

====Execution of prisoners of war====
A group of 15 to 22 Libyan army soldiers captured in [[Derna, Libya|Derna]] were reportedly executed in the neighboring village of Martuba. {{convert|20|km|abbr=off}} &lt;ref name="Globe and Mail"&gt;{{cite news|author= Smith, Graeme |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/africa-mideast/a-rebellion-divided-spectre-of-revenge-killings-hangs-over-eastern-libya/article1967949/ |title=A Rebellion Divided: Spectre of Revenge Killings Hangs Over Eastern Libya | work = [[The Globe and Mail]] |date= 1 April 2011 |accessdate= 22 April 2011 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a widely circulated story, the men were claimed to have been "executed by their own officers for disobeying orders".&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail" /&gt;

Another group of 15 dark-skinned Libyan prisoners were publicly executed by hanging in front of the [[Bayda, Libya|Bayda]] courthouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Among Libya's Prisoners: Interviews with Mercenaries |author= Hauslohner, Abigail |date= 23 February 2011 | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2053490,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Murder and torture of injured soldiers====
On 17 February, the Bayda hospital admitted two injured men, one of darker complexion and the other of olive complexion. The men were accused of fighting against the rebels. A hospital doctor claimed that the black man was murdered and hung by an angry mob that had gathered around the hospital. The other injured man was reportedly beaten, shot and returned to the emergency room.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail" /&gt;&lt;!-- Page 2 --&gt;

=== Lootings and beatings===
In four towns in the western mountains captured in June by the opposition, HRW noticed looting of private property and beatings of alleged Gaddafi sympathizers by rebel forces. The [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) then pledged to hold responsible the causers of the attacks and to prevent such abuses in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/07/13/libya-opposition-forces-should-protect-civilians-and-hospitals | publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]] |title= Libya: Opposition Forces Should Protect Civilians and Hospitals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Killing of civilians ===
During the [[Battle of Sirte (2011)|Battle of Sirte]], the rebels killed many civilians, including men, women, and children, while there were also reports of the rebels harassing and stealing from the locals. According to one resident, "The rebels are worse than rats. NATO is the same as [[Osama bin Laden]]." According to another local woman, "We lived in democracy under Muammar Gaddafi, he was not a dictator. I lived in freedom, Libyan women had full human rights. It isn't that we need Muammar Gaddafi again, but we want to live just as we did before." A local elderly woman stated "They are killing our children. Why are they doing this? For what? Life was good before!"&lt;ref name="telegraph_sirte"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherlock|first=Ruth|title=Gaddafi loyalists stranded as battle for Sirte rages|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8802302/Gaddafi-loyalists-stranded-as-battle-for-Sirte-rages.html|accessdate=28 October 2011|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2 October 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NATO airstrikes==
On 9 August, the Libyan government claimed that 85 civilians were killed in [[NATO]] airstrikes on the village of Majer near [[Zliten]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFLDE7780OO20110809|title=UPDATE 2-Libya says NATO strike kills dozens of civilians|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A NATO spokesman said that they were targeting four buildings in which nine vehicles were destroyed and that government claim "''was not corroborated by available factual information at the site''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2011-08-10-libya-nato-airstrikes_n.htm?csp=34news|title=NATO: Libya airstrike killed troops, not civilians|work=USATODAY.COM|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Libyan government declared three days of national mourning. Reporters were later taken to a hospital where they saw at least 30 dead bodies, including the bodies of at least two young children. The Libyan government claimed that the bodies of others killed in the airstrikes were taken to other hospitals. Neither of these claims were independently verified,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFLDE7780ZZ20110809?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0|title=WRAPUP 1-Tripoli says NATO strike kills dozens of civilians|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some media outlets came to the conclusion that it seemed more credible than usual that something tragic happened due to the presence of at least 14 bodies at one hospital, including an infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Backchannels/2011/0810/Turmoil-in-Benghazi-rebel-advances-in-western-Libya/(page)/2|title=Turmoil in Benghazi, rebel advances in western Libya|author=The Christian Science Monitor|work=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russia|Russia's]] U.N. Ambassador [[Vitaly Churkin]] said a council-mandated investigation of NATO involvement in the Libyan Civil War is essential "given the fact that initially we were led to believe by NATO leaders there are zero civilian casualties of their bombing campaign."&lt;ref name="U.S. and France: No Need for Libya Investigation"&gt;[http://english.ntdtv.com/ntdtv_en/news_europe/2011-12-23/u-s-and-france-no-need-for-libya-investigation.html U.S. and France: No Need for Libya Investigation]&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. and [[France]] called Russia's demand for an investigation "a distraction"

==Other==

===Allegations of Human rights watch groups falsifying claims===
Some journalists have accused human-rights organizations of falsifying &lt;ref name="RDW"/&gt; claims, that Gaddafi was using mercenaries from other parts of Africa to attack protesters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/24/world/africa/24libya.html | work= [[The New York Times]] |author1=Fahim, Kareem |author2=Kirkpatrick, David D. | title=In Libya's Capital, Qaddafi Masses Forces | date= 23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the sources pointing to the existence of mercenaries are the claims by Gaddafi's former Chief of Protocol [[Nouri Al Mismari]], who has claimed the presence of mercenaries from countries such as Chad, Niger, and Mali.&lt;ref&gt;Namunane, Bernard (25 February 2011).  [http://allafrica.com/stories/201102250009.html "Kenya: 'Dogs of War' Fighting for Gaddafi"].  ''[[Daily Nation]]'' (via [[AllAfrica.com]]).  Retrieved 11 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Murder of guest workers and black Libyans====
The [[Government of Chad|Chadian government]] called on coalition forces to protect its citizens in rebel-held areas in Libya. It claimed that dozens had been accused and executed for allegedly being mercenaries in the pay of Gaddafi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = Staff | url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE73303S20110404 |title=Chad Says Citizens Abused in Rebel-Held Libya |publisher= [[Reuters]] |date= 4 April 2011 |accessdate= 11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Turkish people|Turkish]] oil worker reported witnessing the murder of 70 to 80 Sudanese and Chadian guest workers with pruning shears and axes by Libyans who accused them of being Gaddafi mercenaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Quist-Arcton, Ofeibea | url=https://www.npr.org/2011/02/25/134065767/-African-Migrants-Say-They-Face-Hostility-From-Libyans |title=In Libya, African Migrants Say They Face Hostility |publisher= [[NPR]] |date= 25 February 2011 |accessdate= 11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HRW's Peter Bouckaert visited Bayda where 156 supposed mercenaries were being held captive. He reported that these men were actually black Libyans from Southern Libya. He argued that the support of the black southern Libyans for the Gaddafi regime was explainable, as Gaddafi fought to counter discrimination against them in Libyan society. In the same interview, Bouckaert also said that those 156 individuals were released by the rebels less than two weeks after being captured.&lt;ref name="RDW"&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff |url=http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/hrw-no-mercenaries-eastern-libya-0 |title=HRW: No Mercenaries in Eastern Libya |publisher=[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]] |date=2 March 2011 |accessdate=11 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806053253/http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/hrw-no-mercenaries-eastern-libya-0 |archivedate=6 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Killings of unarmed migrant workers by insurgents have been described. On 18 April, a British reporter who had just arrived at Benghazi by sea from [[Misrata]] described the sufferings of large numbers of migrant workers trapped in Misrata in a broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]]. After mentioning casualties during government forces attack he said about the migrant workers that "…some have also died in clashes with the, err, rebel fighters. They were protesting about the conditions, demanding that they should be repatriated and on a couple of occasions ''this has led to the rebels opening fire and, err, people dying''."&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC Radio 4]], "Today" programme, 18 April 2011; about 7.53 a.m. BST.  Available on BBC iPlayer for UK listeners at https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b010dhcm/Today_18_04_2011/&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''incubus''' is a [[demon]] in male form who, according to [[Mythology|mythological]] and legendary traditions, lies upon sleeping women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Incubus (demon) |publisher=[[Britannica.com]]|accessdate=October 16, 2017|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/incubus}}&lt;/ref&gt;
in order to engage in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] with them. Its female counterpart is a [[succubus]]. Salacious tales of incubi and succubi have been told for many centuries in traditional societies. Some traditions hold that repeated sexual activity with an incubus or succubus may result in the deterioration of health, mental state, or even death.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, Walter (2002), ''Demon Lovers'', p. 23, The University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|0-226-77261-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''incubus'' is derived from [[Late Latin]] ''incubo'' "a nightmare induced by such a demon" from ''incubare'' "to lie upon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Incubus |publisher=[[Reference.com]]|accessdate=September 26, 2014|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Incubus?s=t }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest mentions of an incubus comes from [[Mesopotamia]] on the [[Sumerian King List]], ca. 2400 BC, where the hero [[Gilgamesh]]'s father is listed as [[Lilu (mythology)|Lilu]].&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Patai, p. 221, The Hebrew Goddess: Third Enlarged Edition, {{ISBN|978-0-8143-2271-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that Lilu disturbs and seduces women in their sleep, while [[Lilitu]], a female demon, appears to men in their erotic dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Siegmund Hurwitz, Lilith: The First Eve {{ISBN|978-3-85630-522-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other corresponding demons appear as well: Ardat lili, who visits men by night and begets ghostly children from them, and Irdu lili, who is known as a male counterpart to Ardat lili and visits women by night and begets from them. These demons were originally storm demons, but they eventually became regarded as night demons because of mistaken etymology.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Patai, p. 221 &amp; 222, The Hebrew Goddess: Third Enlarged Edition, {{ISBN|978-0-8143-2271-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written later but described as happening before the Sumerian King List was completed is the mention of the [[Nephilim]]: Christian tradition attributes the completion of the Biblical book of [[Genesis (Bible)|Genesis]] to the 5th century BC.

Incubi were thought to be demons who had sexual relations with women, sometimes producing a child by the woman. Succubi, by contrast, were demons thought to have intercourse with men.
Debate about these demons began early in the Christian tradition. [[St. Augustine]] touched on the topic in [[City of God (book)|''De Civitate Dei'' ("The City of God")]]; there were too many alleged attacks by incubi to deny them. He stated, "There is also a very general rumor. Many have verified it by their own experience and trustworthy persons have corroborated the experience others told, that sylvans and fauns, commonly called incubi, have often made wicked assaults upon women."&lt;ref&gt;Augustine (410), ''The City of God'' 15.23,[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.html.com 'The City of God']&lt;/ref&gt; Questions about the reproductive capabilities of the demons continued. Eight hundred years later, [[Thomas Aquinas]] lent himself to the ongoing discussion, stating, "Still, if some are occasionally begotten from demons, it is not from the seed of such demons, nor from their assumed bodies, but from the seed of men, taken for the purpose; as when the demon assumes first the form of a woman, and afterwards of a man; just so they take the seed of other things for other generating purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Aquinus, Thomas (1265–1274), "Summa Theologica", [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.FP_Q51_A3.html "Summa Theologica"]&lt;/ref&gt; This view was also shared by [[James VI and I|King James]] and in his dissertation titled [[Daemonologie|Dæmonologie]] he refutes the possibility for angelic entities to reproduce and instead offered a suggestion that a [[devil]] would carry out two methods of impregnating women: the first, to steal the sperm out of a dead man and deliver it into a woman. If a demon could extract the semen quickly, the transportation of the substance could not be instantly transported to a female host, causing it to go cold. This explains his view that Succubae and Incubi were the same demonic entity only to be described differently based on the sexes being conversed with. Being abused in such a way caused women at nunneries to be burned if they were found pregnant. The second method was the idea that a dead body could be possessed by a devil, causing it to rise and have sexual relations with others. This is similar to depictions of [[revenant]]s or [[vampire]]s and a spirit taking deceased corpse to cause some mischief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warren|first1=Brett|title=The Annotated Dæmonologie of King James. A Critical Edition. In Modern English|date=2016|isbn=1-5329-6891-4|pages=79–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became generally accepted that incubi and succubi were the same demon, able to switch between male and female forms.&lt;ref&gt;Carus, Paul (1900), ''The History of The Devil and The Idea of Evil From The Earliest Times to The Present Day'', [http://www.sacred-texts.com/evil/hod/hod15.htm "The Devil's Prime,"] at [http://www.sacred-texts.com sacred-texts.com]&lt;/ref&gt; A succubus would be able to sleep with a man and collect his sperm, and then transform into an incubus and use that seed on women. Even though sperm and egg came from humans originally, the spirits' offspring were often thought of as supernatural.&lt;ref name="AZ"&gt;Lewis, James R., Oliver, Evelyn Dorothy, Sisung Kelle S. (Editor) (1996), ''Angels A to Z'', Entry: Incubi and Succubi, pp. 218, 219, Visible Ink Press, {{ISBN|0-7876-0652-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources indicate that it may be identified by its unnaturally large or cold [[penis]].&lt;ref&gt;Russel, Jeffrey Burton (1972), ''Witchcraft in The Middle Ages'', pp. 239, 235 Cornell University Press, Ithaca and London, {{ISBN|0-8014-0697-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though many tales claim that the incubus is [[bisexual]],&lt;ref name="wima"&gt;Russsel, Jeffrey Burton (1972), ''Witchcraft in The Middle Ages'', p. 145, Cornell University Press, Ithaca and London, {{ISBN|0-8014-0697-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; others indicate that it is strictly [[heterosexual]] and finds attacking a male victim either unpleasant or detrimental.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, Walter (2002), ''Demon Lovers'', pp. 54, 55, 332, 333, The University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|0-226-77261-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incubi are sometimes said to be able to conceive children. The half-human offspring of such a union is sometimes referred to as a [[cambion]]. An incubus may pursue sexual relations with a woman in order to father a child, as in the legend of [[Merlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Merlin's father was said to be an incubus in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' and many later tales. See [[Norris J. Lacy|Lacy, Norris J.]] (1991). "Merlin". In Norris J. Lacy, ''The New Arthurian Encyclopedia'', p. 322. (New York: Garland, 1991). {{ISBN|0-8240-4377-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', exorcism is one of the five ways to overcome the attacks of incubi, the others being [[Sacrament]]al [[Confession (religion)|Confession]], the [[Sign of the Cross]] (or recital of the [[Hail Mary|Angelic Salutation]]), moving the afflicted to another location, and by [[excommunication]] of the attacking entity, "which is perhaps the same as exorcism."&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Heinrich and Sprenger, James (1486), Summers, Montague (translator&amp;nbsp;– 1928), ''The Malleus Maleficarum'', Part 2, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/mm/mm02b01a.htm Chapter 1], "The Remedies prescribed by the Holy Church against Incubus and Succubus Devils," at [http://www.sacred-texts.com sacred-texts.com]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the [[Franciscan|Franciscan friar]] [[Ludovico Maria Sinistrari]] stated that incubi "do not obey exorcists, have no dread of exorcisms, show no reverence for holy things, at the approach of which they are not in the least overawed."&lt;ref name="Masello"/&gt;

==Regional variations==
There are a number of variations on the incubus theme around the world. The [[alp (folklore)|alp]] of [[Teutons|Teutonic]] or [[German folklore]] is one of the better known. In [[Zanzibar]], [[Popo Bawa]] primarily attacks men and generally behind closed doors.&lt;ref name="Popo Bawa"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wwrn.org/articles/16838/?&amp;place=eastern-africa&amp;section=occult | title=Belief in sex-mad demon tests nerves | publisher=[http://www.wwrn.org "World Wide Religious News (WWRN)"] | date=May 16, 2005 | accessdate=December 11, 2011 | author=Maclean, William (Reuters)}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The [[Trauco]]", according to the traditional mythology of the [[Chiloé Province]] of Chile, is a hideous deformed dwarf who lulls nubile young women and seduces them. The Trauco is said to be responsible for unwanted pregnancies, especially in unmarried women. Perhaps another variation of this conception is the "Tintín" in Ecuador, a dwarf who is fond of abundant haired women and seduces them at night by playing the guitar outside their windows — a myth that researchers believe was created during the Colonial period of time to explain pregnancies in women who never left their houses without a chaperone, very likely covering incest or sexual abuse by one of the family's friends.&lt;ref&gt;"TIN TIN" A brief description of the myth at [http://www.edufuturo.com/educacion.php?c=945 EDUFUTURO](in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hungary]], a ''[[lidérc]]'' can be a Satanic lover that flies at night and appears as a fiery light (an ''ignis fatuus'' or [[will o' the wisp]]) or, in its more benign form as a featherless chicken.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, Dinah, Mack, Carol K. (1999), ''A Field Guide to Demons, Fairies, Fallen Angels and Other Subversive Spirits'', p. 209, Henry Holt and Company, LLC, {{ISBN|0-8050-6270-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brazil]] and the rainforests of the [[Amazon Basin]], the [[Amazon River Dolphin]] (or ''boto'') is believed to be a combination of [[siren (mythology)|siren]] and incubus that shape-shifts into a very charming and handsome man who seduces young women and takes them into the river.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientspiral.com/dolphin1.htm "Whales and Dolphins"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723093206/http://www.ancientspiral.com/dolphin1.htm |date=2011-07-23 }} at [http://www.ancientspiral.com ancientspiral.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It is said to be responsible for disappearances and unwanted pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/C001650/html/text_only_english/dolphin.htm Boto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021061050/http://library.thinkquest.org/C001650/html/text_only_english/dolphin.htm |date=2010-10-21 }} at [http://library.thinkquest.org library.thinkquest.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407170213/http://library.thinkquest.org/ |date=2007-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to legend, a boto always wears a hat to disguise the breathing hole at the top of its head while in human form, metamorphosing back into a dolphin during the day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sumauma.net/amazonian/legends/legends-boto.html "The Dolphin Legend"] at [http://www.sumauma.net sumauma.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Southern African incubus demon is the [[Tokolosh]]. Chaste women place their beds upon bricks to deter the rather short fellows from attaining their sleeping forms. They also share the hole in the head detail and water dwelling habits of the [[Boto]].

In [[Swedish folklore]], there is the mara or [[Mare (folklore)|mare]], a [[spirit]] or [[goblin]] that rides on the chests of humans while they sleep, giving them bad dreams (or "[[nightmare]]s").&lt;ref&gt;Bjorvand and Lindeman (2007:719–720).&lt;/ref&gt; Belief in the mare goes back to the Norse [[Ynglinga saga]] from the 13th century,&lt;ref&gt;Ynglinga saga, stanza 13, in Hødnebø and Magerøy (1979:12).&lt;/ref&gt; but the belief is probably even older. The mare was likely inspired by [[sleep paralysis]].

In [[Assam]], a north-eastern province of India it is mostly known as "pori" ([[Assamese script|Assamese]]: পৰী, meaning "angel"). According to the mythology, Pori comes to a man at night in his dreams and seduces him. Gradually the victim's health deteriorates and in some cases develops suicidal tendencies.

In [[Turkish people|Turkish]] culture, incubus is known as [[Karabasan]]. It is an evil being that descends upon some sleepers at night. These beings are thought to be spirits or [[jinns]]. It can be seen or heard in the nightmare and a heavy weight is felt on the chest. Yet, people cannot wake up from that state. Some of the causes are sleeping without adequately covering the body (especially women) and eating in bed.

==Scientific explanations==
Victims may have been experiencing waking dreams or [[sleep paralysis]]. The phenomenon of sleep paralysis is well-established. During the first phase of sleep (also known as REM sleep), motor centers in the brain are inhibited, producing paralysis. The reason for this is ultimately unknown but the most common explanation is that this prevents one from acting out one's dreams. Malfunctions of this process can either result in somnambulism ([[sleepwalking]]) or, conversely, sleep paralysis—where one remains partially or wholly paralysed for a short time after waking.

Additional to sleep paralysis is [[hypnagogia]]. In a near-dream state, it is common to experience auditory and visual hallucinations. Mostly these are forgotten upon fully waking or soon afterwards, in the same manner as dreams. However, most people remember the phenomenon of hearing music or seeing things in near-sleep states at some point in their lives. Typical examples include a feeling of being crushed or suffocated, electric "tingles" or "vibrations", imagined speech and other noises, the imagined presence of a visible or invisible entity, and sometimes intense emotions of fear or euphoria and orgasmic feelings. These often appear quite real and vivid; especially auditory hallucinations of music which can be quite loud, indistinguishable from music being played in the same room. Humanoid and animal figures, often shadowy or blurry, are often present in hypnagogic hallucinations, more so than other hallucinogenic states. This may be a relic of an ancient instinct to detect predatory animals.

The combination of sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucination could easily cause someone to believe that a "demon was holding them down". Nocturnal arousal etc. could be explained away by creatures causing otherwise guilt-producing behavior. Add to this the common phenomena of nocturnal arousal and [[nocturnal emission]], and all the elements required to believe in an incubus are present.&lt;ref name="AZ"/&gt;

On the other hand, some victims of incubi could well have been the victims of real [[sexual assault]]. Rapists may have attributed the [[rape]]s of sleeping women to demons in order to escape punishment. A friend or relative is at the top of the list in such cases and would be kept secret by the intervention of "spirits".&lt;ref name="Masello"&gt;Masello, Robert (2004), ''Fallen Angels and Spirits of The Dark'', p. 66, The Berkley Publishing Group, 200 Madison Ave. New York, NY 10016, {{ISBN|0-399-51889-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Latvian language|Latvian]]: '''Lauma''', [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]: '''Laumė''' is a woodland [[Fairy|fae]], and guardian spirit of [[orphans]] in Eastern [[Baltic mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lauma|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/332311/lauma|website=Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc|accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally a sky spirit, her compassion for human suffering brought her to earth to share our fate.

==In Lithuanian mythology==

Laumės are the very oldest goddesses of [[Lithuanian mythology]]. The image of these goddesses may have formed during the historical [[Mesolithic]] period, just after the [[Ice Age]]. 
Laumės could appear in the form of animals, as mares or as female goats, bears and dogs. Later, Laumės had an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] appearance: they usually had birds’ claws for feet and appeared as women with the head or lower body of a female goat.  Other forms included half-human/half dog or half mare, similar to [[centaurs]].  Like [[cyclops]], Laumės often had only one eye. They also had large breasts with stone nipples; pieces of [[belemnitida]] found on ground were called "Laumės nipples."

Laumės were dangerous, especially to men. They could tickle or [[Pinch (action)|tweak]] them to death and then eat their bodies, and in this way they were similar to Lamia of [[Greek mythology]]. The Lithuanian myth also claimed Laumės kept huge cows which could be milked by all people. However, after very cold weathers, the cows died; pieces of belemnitida were considered to be the remains of their [[udder]]s.  Laumės were afraid of tools made from [[iron]].

Laumės can be considered as atmospheric goddesses. It is said that Laumė was a beautiful goddess, who lived in clouds and had a diamond throne. Some myths claimed Laumė was a bride of thunder god [[Perkūnas]]; however, they did not marry because Laumė fell in love with the Moon, who was considered a male god in Lithuania.  In other stories the bride was stolen by the devil Velnias, named Tuolius. That's why Laumė liked moonshine. In other myth, the bride of Perkūnas was a Laumė called [[Vaiva]]. The rainbow was called the ribbon of Vaiva. Despite her marriage she had a beloved singer named Straublys. Straublys had stolen the ribbon of Vaiva. During the rain, Straublys stretches the ribbon of Vaiva across the sky, while Perkūnas is angry and shouts in thunder. It was believed it is the rainbow that cause the rain, while Lithuanian shepherds had a prayer or curse by which the rainbow had to turn to pieces and make the rain go away. The other myth claimed Laumė fell in love with a beautiful young man down to earth. They both had a son named Meilius (name derived from word 'Meilė' - love). Laumė descended to sky to feed her son with her breasts from time to time. However, the highest God found out about the son of sacrilegious love, smashed him into highest place of the sky and gave him a place between stars. After that he cut Laumės breasts, and so, stone pieces of it can be found on Earth.

Laumės descended from sky to Earth. They lived near by lakes, abandoned bath-houses, in islands of lakes or dense forests. Lots of names of water pools in Lithuania are named after word Laumė. Laumės liked to gather near rivers, lakes, swamps, in meadows, there dew fell in night in New Moon or [[Full Moon]]. They danced and enjoyed themselves, leaving circles (like [[Fairy Ring]]) in the grass. Usually, Laumės were most powerful at Friday of [[New Moon]], at the most rainy days of month in Lithuania. Laumės could cause hail, storm or rain by singing, dancing or by curses. Laumės song was traditionally performed during weddings up until the 19th century. The song was performed by girls dancing in circle, with one in the middle. The dance and song was also said to cause rain.

Later on, Laumės were depicted as very beautiful women, who appeared both naked or wearing a very fine clothing. The [[Rainbow]] was often called a ribbon lost by Laumės. What's how they were associated with weaving. Laumės usually appeared in groups of three. They were able to do women’s work perfectly, as are especially skilled in weaving and spinning. They love children, respect industriousness and help those in need. They punish those who ridicule them, and those who are lazy. Following are two example [[Folklore|folk tale]]s featuring Laumės:

===Laumės (fairies) and the baby===
A woman was harvesting a flower bed and had taken her child with her. She was so busy with her work that the child slept the day through, and she left the little one behind.

The woman went home at the end of the day to milk the cows and make dinner. She served her husband, who asked her "Where’s my son?" With terror she whispered, "I have forgotten him!" She ran as fast as she could to the place in which she left her son, hearing a Laumé speak: "[[Čiūčia liūlia]], forgotten child." The mother, from the distance, asked the Laume for her child back. The fairie said, "Come, come, dear woman, take your child, we have done nothing to him. We know that you work very hard, at many jobs, and that you didn’t want to leave your child behind."

The fairies then went on to shower the babe with much treasure, enough gifts to raise several children upon. The mother went home with her precious baby and with her gifts; she was greeted with great joy.

Another woman, hearing of her good fortune, was taken over by jealousy. She took to thinking, "I shall do the same as her, and also be showered in gifts." The next evening, at dusk, she took her child, left him in the fields and went home. She ate dinner, thoughtlessly, before pausing to think of her child—and the treasure.

When she approached the field, she heard the fairies, "[[Čiūčia liūlia]], you left your child in greed." And the child screamed with such great pain, for he was pinched and tortured mercilessly. They continued their torture until the mother came. The fairies tossed the child at her feet. The babe was dead.

===The Fairies foretell a newborn's future===

A Laumė would come to a window and would yell, "Hundreds born, hundreds died, what of his fate?" Another would answer back, "Birth at night, death at night." And again they would yell and moan at the window. From within another would answer, "This nightly birth is a big work smarter not harder, to live well whole life long." Again, yelling at the window, "Hundreds born, hundreds dead, what of his fate?” Another answer: "Morning time born will be a strong worker". And again, after some time, begins the same questioning. The answer was "Noontime born is a very happy child, full of bubbles and envy for what is not strictly in accordance with wealth."

==In Latvian mythology==
In [[Latvian mythology]] Lauma is an assistant at birth, assuring the health and welfare of both mother and child. If the mother does not survive, or gives the child up, she takes on the role of spiritual foster mother for the child. She spins the cloth of life for the child, but weeps at the fate of some. The fact that the cloth can, to a degree, weave itself, indicates a higher power than Lauma.

Over the years, her image has gradually degraded. Accused of baby-snatching by disrespectful husbands (since she is unable to bear children of her own), her looks and sweetness were lost, turning her into an evil old [[hag]]. She weeps at her destined fate, hoping for the day when she will return to her former beautiful self.

'''Lionel Giroux''' (1935 – December 4, 1995) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[midget professional wrestler|midget wrestler]] who is best known by his [[ring name]] '''Little Beaver'''. His most famous appearance was in a six-man match at [[WrestleMania III]] for the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]].

==Career==
Lionel Giroux began his wrestling career in 1950, at the age of fifteen,&lt;ref name="OWOW"/&gt; and then began to wrestle for promoters in [[Quebec]]. He, along with [[Sky Low Low]], became two of the most famous midget wrestlers in wrestling who had enough drawing power to command a large portion of the live gate for wrestling events.&lt;ref name="Death Slam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Death GW"&gt;{{cite news|title=Little Beaver|work=Canadian Pro Wrestling Page of Fame|url=http://www.garywill.com/wrestling/canada/lbeaver.htm|accessdate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giroux helped to create the comedy matches that have since become a trademark for midget wrestling in Canada and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Death GW"/&gt; In 1973, Giroux won the [[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]] Midget Wrestler of the Year award.

His last in-ring appearance was at WrestleMania III in the [[Pontiac Silverdome]] in [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]], [[Michigan]] in 1987, at the age of 52.&lt;ref name="Death Slam"/&gt; Giroux, wrestling as Little Beaver, teamed with [[Hillbilly Jim]] and fellow midget wrestler the [[Haiti Kid]], defeating [[King Kong Bundy]] and his midget tag-team partners [[Shigeri Akabane|Little Tokyo]] and [[Lord Littlebrook]], after Bundy was disqualified for attacking Little Beaver.&lt;ref name="WM III"&gt;{{cite news|title=WrestleMania III Results |work=WWE |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm3/results/ |accessdate=2008-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030220921/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm3/results/ |archivedate=2007-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s|last=Shields|first=Brian|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2006|isbn=1-4165-3257-9|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the match, Giroux suffered a back injury at the hands of Bundy after he was bodyslammed and had an elbow dropped on him by the {{convert|458|lb|kg|abbr=on}} Bundy, which forced him to retire from professional wrestling (through the match Beaver had "annoyed" Bundy including elbowing him in the stomach, delivering a drop kick that had literally no effect, and slapping him with his [[Moccasin]] which Bundy claimed "Stung like a son-of-a-bitch").&lt;ref name="Death Slam"/&gt; In a 1998 interview Bundy said he hoped that he wasn't responsible for Giroux's early death, saying he wouldn't want that on his conscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bundy-mania runs wild|work=SLAM! Wrestling|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/bundy_interview.html|accessdate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months after Wrestlemania III, during a match at the [[Boston Garden]] that aired later on [[WWF Prime Time Wrestling]], Giroux (again as Little Beaver) was in Hillbilly Jim's corner for a match against the [[One Man Gang]]. In a comical match eventually won by Hillbilly via a countout, Beaver got involved on several occasions, including antagonizing Gang's manager, [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]], throughout the match and hitting the back of Gang's head with a broom after the match was finished. The {{convert|450|lb|kg|abbr=on}} Gang finally caught Little Beaver in the ring and after delivering a blow that sent him sprawling, he followed Slick's orders to hit Beaver with his [[Professional wrestling attacks#Big splash|747 Splash]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkxZyO2PhPI One Man Gang squashes Little Beaver]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Giroux died on December 4, 1995 of [[emphysema]].&lt;ref name="PWHOF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Death Slam"/&gt; In 2003, Giroux was inducted into the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name="OWOW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Death GW"/&gt; Giroux was cremated after his death.

'''''Little Hands Clapping''''', is a novel by British author [[Dan Rhodes]], published in 2010 by [[Canongate Books|Canongate]]. Its title comes from a line in [[Robert Browning]]'s poem ''The Pied Piper of Hamelin''.

==Plot introduction==
The novel centres around a bizarre German museum dedicated to [[suicide]]; Herr Schmidt, its grim grey curator; and the respectable Doctor Ernst Frölicher and his shocking secret.

Various characters appear with short lifestories including the [[Luciano Pavarotti]]-obsessed founder of the museum and her Pavarotti-lookalike husband, Hulda the cleaner who believes she is doomed to Hell, and Madalena the suicidal Portuguese student.

A '''Local Land and Property [[Gazetteer]]''' (LLPG) is an [[address (geography)|address]] database maintained by [[local authorities]], who are responsibile for creating all addresses. However, until recently those same local authorities have not held a unified and consistent list of addresses within their areas. This has led to various services within individual local authorities maintaining separate and incompatible address databases.

In recent years the central government of the UK has required local authorities to modernise their processes to take advantage of new technologies and provide better linked up services to their residents and businesses. One of the key ways to achieve this goal has been to develop one address resource for their entire local authority area. This has ultimately meant that a resident may notify a council of their change of address at one place without having to repeat the process throughout a number of service areas within an authority.

As part of this process the [[National Land and Property Gazetteer]] (NLPG) was created. This is a central repository or “hub” for all LLPGs and coordinates the many LLPGs created by local authorities. It also enforces the compliance of all LLPGs with the national standard for the representation of address information, [[British Standard]] 7666 ([[BS7666]]).

Largely through pressure from the central UK government for a consistent address resource the NLPG has become UK’s definitive address infrastructure. However, the development of the NLPG has been held back by arguments between local authorities and the national mapping agency, [[Ordnance Survey]], who are required to act as a trading entity. This has led to the NLPG being unable to compel local authorities to maintain their LLPGs as well as protracted negotiations regarding issues of ownership of address data.

In May 2005 local authorities in the UK signed an agreement ([[Mapping Services Agreement]]) with suppliers of [[geographic data]], which included Ordnance Survey and the managers of the NLPG. This solved the issues surrounding ownership of address data and contained many restrictions on the use of LLPGs by local authorities as well as compulsions upn local authorities to maintain their LLPGs.

However, simultaneously, Ordnance Survey published a proposal to develop an alternative address infrastructure called the [[National Spatial Address Infrastructure]] (NSAI). This involved Ordnance Survey taking ownership of the NLPG and then selling it back to the same local authorities that had created the LLPGs that make up the NLPG. This provoked another round of arguments between Ordnance Survey and local authorities. The NSAI has now been abandoned by Ordnance Survey[https://web.archive.org/web/20110606013441/http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/aboutus/foi/questions/2007/0042.html].

On 3 December 2010, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government announced the formation of GeoPlace to provide a freely-available national address gazetteer. This is a joint venture between the Local Government Association and Ordnance Survey. The venture underwent a process of approval by the Office of Fair Trading, which passed a judgement allowing the venture on 15 February 2011.

Following the setting up of GeoPlace, NLPG data has been brought together with Ordnance Survey, Valuation Office Agency and Royal Mail data into the National Address Gazetteer infrastructure. The National Address Gazetteer infrastructure is the single source from which the AddressBase products from Ordnance Survey are developed. Through agreement between Ordnance Survey and Scotland’s Improvement Service, working on behalf of Scottish Local Government, the National Address Gazetteer includes DT

[[File:Molvania.svg|thumb|right|Flag of Molvania]]
'''''Molvanîa''''' (subtitled ''A Land Untouched by Modern Dentistry'') is a book [[parody]]ing [[tourism|travel]] guidebooks. The guide describes the [[fictional country]] Molvanîa, a Soviet state, a nation described as "the birthplace of the [[whooping cough]]" and "owner of Europe's oldest [[nuclear reactor]]".  It was created by Australians [[Tom Gleisner]], [[Santo Cilauro]] and [[Rob Sitch]] (locally known for ''[[The D-Generation]]'' and ''[[The Panel (Australian TV series)|The Panel]]'' in Australia). The book has been criticized for promoting racial stereotypes.

== History ==
The book became a surprise success after its initial publication in Australia, sparking a bidding war for the international publication rights. [[Qantas]] has even run the half-hour video segment produced in association with the book on its international flights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rimpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=Molvan%C3%AEa+qantas&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dukiOh3B28&amp;sig=y6L0rBXPmPwM5kcmj50g4DO6um8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2ok-U_itBsGz0QWIzoCwCQ&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Molvan%C3%AEa%20qantas&amp;f=false Robert A. Saunders, "Brand Interrupted: The Impact of Alternative Narrators on Nation Branding in the Former Second World"], in Nadia Kaneva (ed.), ''Branding Post-Communist Nations: Marketizing National Identities in the “New" Europe'', Routledge, 2012, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

== About Molvanîa ==
'''The Republic of Molvanîa''' is a composite of many of the worst [[stereotype]]s and [[cliché]]s about Soviet states.  The exact location of Molvanîa is never specified; it is said to border Germany, [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Hungary]], and [[Romania]]. The shape of the country with its divisions strongly suggests [[Moldova]],{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} and the name has similarities (as has the location description by the authors as "somewhere between [[Romania]] and downwind from [[Chernobyl]]"); it can also represent a composite country consisting of parts of Hungary, Czech Republic, Croatia, Serbia, Slovakia, Austria, and perhaps Poland). The book mentions [[Bulgarians]], [[Hungarians]], and perhaps [[Moldovans]] (ethnic [[Romanians]]) as its inhabitants: "The Molvanian population is made up of three major ethnic groups: the Bulgs (68%) who live predominantly in the centre and south, the Hungars (29%) who inhabit the northern cities, and the Molvs (3%) who can be found mainly in prison."

The book describes the nation as having been a desolate wasteland for much of its history, [[History of Russia|similar]] to Russia since the 12th century, torn by civil war and ethnic unrest. Eventually Molvanîa's various warring factions were united as a single kingdom, ruled by a series of cruel despotic kings. In the late 19th century the monarchy was overthrown, but the royal family remained popular in exile. During [[World War II]] the country was allied with [[Nazi Germany]], and then afterwards was occupied by the [[Soviet Union]], who set up a Communist [[puppet government]]. After the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of European Communism]] in the 1990s, the country became a dictatorship run by a corrupt government with heavy ties to the [[Mafia]].

Molvanîa is described as a very poor and rural country, heavily polluted and geographically barren. The infrastructure is terrible, with necessities such as electricity, clean water, and [[indoor plumbing]] being rare finds, largely due to [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic incompetence]]. Though the travel guide tries to suggest otherwise, there is little to do in the country, the hotels are tiny, filthy and dilapidated, the ethnic cuisine disgusting, and the "tourist attractions" boring and overpriced.

The Molvanîan people are portrayed as being generally rude, dirty, and at times slightly [[Psychosis|psychotic]], with numerous bizarre and illogical [[belief]]s and traditions. The country's patron saint is Fyodor.

=== Language ===
The fictional Molvanîan language is said to be so complicated that it takes an average of 16 years to learn. Not only is the tone in which one speaks important to the meaning, but also the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]. It is a [[grammatical gender|gendered]] language, with different [[article (grammar)|article]]s being used depending on whether a noun is masculine, feminine, neutral, or a type of cheese. There are language schools for tourists to attend, which are described by the book as a "waste of time."

=== Flag ===
The flag of Molvanîa is called the "Trikolor" despite the fact it only contains two colours, red and yellow. During the Soviet occupation, the flag had a yellow [[hammer and sickle]] in the top left corner. After the fall of Communism, Molvanîa became one of the few ex-soviet states to retain the hammer and sickle but added a [[trowel]] into the symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.molvania.com.au/molvania/national.html | title=Molvanîa: A Land Untouched by Modern Dentistry| publisher= Jetlag travel | work =www.molvania.com.au|date=November 2003|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anthem ===
The country's national anthem can be heard on the website Molvania.com, which sounds more like a funeral march than a patriotic tune. Its lyrics are largely [[Antiziganism|Anti-Gypsy]], yet when anyone leaves the country the border security gives citizens and tourist the [[Romani mythology|Gypsy Curse]] and it rubs in the fact the country is a [[Failed state|Failed State]].

== Criticism ==
The book was criticized by the United Kingdom's former [[Minister for Europe]] [[Keith Vaz]], who accused it of exploiting prejudice.

He said the book was a little "cheeky" because "it does reflect some of the prejudices which are taking root [in Europe]. He [Mr Gleisner] does try and show exactly where we are lacking in our knowledge, the sad thing is, some people might actually believe that this country exists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3592753.stm|title=Molvania spoof mocks travel books|publisher=BBC News|date=April 2, 2004|accessdate=September 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sequels ==
Subsequent travel guide parodies published examine Southeast Asian nation ''[[Phaic Tăn]]'' (published in 2004) and ''[[San Sombrèro]]'' in Latin America (published in 2006).

The '''Museum of the Ara Pacis''' (Italian: Museo dell'Ara Pacis) belongs to the ''Sistema dei Musei in Comune'' of [[Rome]] ([[Italy]]); it houses the ''[[Ara Pacis]]'' of [[Augustus]], an ancient monument that was initially inaugurated on January 30, 9 B.C.

==Structure==
[[File:8083 - Roma - Ara Pacis - Calchi di ritratti della gens Giulio-Claudia - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto -28-Mar-2008.jpg|{{largethumb}}|The portraits of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] placed close to the entry]]

Designed by the American architect [[Richard Meier]] and built in steel, [[travertine]], glass and plaster, the museum is the first great architectural and urban intervention in the historic centre of Rome since the [[Fascism|Fascist era]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archdaily.com/104187/ara-pacis-museum-richard-meier-partners "Ara Pacis Museum / Richard Meier &amp; Partners" ''Arch Daily'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is a structure with a triumphal nature, clearly alluding to the style of imperial Rome. Wide glazed surfaces allow the viewer to admire the Ara Pacis with uniform lighting conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.arapacis.it/sede/il_progetto_meier|title=The Meier project - Museo dell'Ara Pacis|website=en.arapacis.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The white colour is the trademark of Richard Meier, while the travertine plates decorating part of the building are a consequence of in-progress changes (aluminum surfaces were initially planned), after a design review following controversies with some nostalgia for the previous pavilion that was built in 1938 by the architect  [[Vittorio Ballio Morpurgo]].

The challenging design of Meier wants to assert itself in the very hearth of the town, becoming a nerve and transit centre. The complex was intended to include a crosswalk with an underpass linking the museum to the [[Tiber]] river; presently the underpass design seems to have been abandoned completely.&lt;ref&gt;Non si abbatterà il muretto dell'Ara Pacis arriva lo stop della soprintendenza [http://roma.corriere.it/roma/notizie/cronaca/12_settembre_1/muretto-ara-pacis-stop-sovrintendenza-2111647965285.shtml Lilli Garrone on the Corriere della Sera]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The building, designed by architect [[Richard Meier]], was inaugurated and opened to the public after seven years of works, on April 21, 2006 (the anniversary of the traditional date of the foundation of Rome).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=NICOLAI |last=OUROUSSOFF |title=ARCHITECTURE REVIEW - ARA PACIS MUSEUM An Oracle of Modernism in Ancient Rome|work= [[The New York Times]]|date= September 25, 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/25/arts/design/25paci.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the night of May 31 2009, unknown persons defaced the white outer wall with green and red paint and placed a toilet bowl at the foot of the wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dave |last=Itzkoff|title= Vandals Attack Museum in Center of Rome|work=The New York Times|date= June 1, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/02/arts/design/02arts-VANDALSATTAC_BRF.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12, 2009, a group of activists of [[Earth First!]], during the Copenhagen Summit, colored the water of the fountain green and affixed on the side facing Via Tomacelli a banner saying "Earth First! Act Now". The officers and the employees of the museum intervened immediately, removing the banner and emptying the fountain.

==Criticisms==
The building has attracted conflicting opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Maria José |last=Strazzulla|year= 2009|title=War and Peace: Housing the Ara Pacis in the Eternal City|work=American Journal of Archaeology|volume= 113.2 |url=http://www.ajaonline.org/online-review-museum/370}} (open access)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York Times]] judged it a flop, while the famous art critic and polemicist [[Vittorio Sgarbi]] called it, "A Texas gas station in the very earth of one of the most important urban centres in the world", and the first step towards an "internationalisation" of the city of Rome.
Nonetheless, opinion was not unanimous at all&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Giannino Cusano|url=http://www.antithesi.info/testi/testo_2.asp?ID=383|title=Il progetto di Richard Meier per l'Ara Pacis a Roma: perché si!}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, for instance, [[Achille Bonito Oliva]] praised Meier's design.&lt;ref&gt;Interview granted to [[TG3]] the day after the declarations of the Mayor [[Gianni Alemanno]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013 a faulty roof allowed water to leak into the building during heavy rain. Staff members had to use buckets to remove water from the top of the altar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archaeology.org/news/1552-131125-rome-ara-pacis-flood|title=Ara Pacis Dampened by Leaky Roof - Archaeology Magazine|first=Jessica E.|last=Saraceni|website=archaeology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During one of his first declarations after being elected Mayor of Rome (April 2008), [[Gianni Alemanno]] announced his intention to remove Meier's building, on the grounds that the Roman right wing had always disapproved. However, Alemanno himself later pointed out that the removal was not a priority of his administration.&lt;ref&gt;Non si abbatterà il muretto dell'Ara Pacis arriva lo stop della soprintendenza [http://roma.corriere.it/roma/notizie/cronaca/12_settembre_1/muretto-ara-pacis-stop-sovrintendenza-2111647965285.shtml Lilli Garrone on Corriere della Sera]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hieronymus Bosch - The Fall of the Rebel Angels (obverse) - WGA2572.jpg|thumb|right|195px|''The Fall of the Rebel Angels'' by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] is based on {{bibleref2|Genesis|6:1–4}}]]

The '''Nephilim''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɛ|f|ᵻ|ˌ|l|ɪ|m}} ({{Lang-he-n|נְפִילִים}}, ''nefilim'') were the offspring of the "[[sons of God]]" and the "daughters of men" before the [[Genesis flood narrative|Deluge]], according to Genesis 6:1-4.

A similar or identical [[biblical Hebrew]] term, read as "Nephilim" by some scholars, or as the word "fallen" by others, appears in Ezekiel 32:27.&lt;ref&gt;For the view that "Nephilim" appear explicitly in Ezekiel 32, see Hendel, Ronald S. “Of Demigods and the Deluge: Toward an Interpretation of Genesis 6:1–4”. ''Journal of Biblical Literature'', vol. 106, no. 1, 1987, p. 22. {{jstor|3260551}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the view that the term "Nephilim" does not appear explicitly in Ezekiel 32:27, but that a related word is used to deliberately refer to the traditions about Nephilim, see Doak, Brian R. "Ezekiel's Topography of the (Un-)Heroic Dead in Ezekiel 32:17–32". ''Journal of Biblical Literature'', vol. 132, no. 3, 2013, pp. 607–624. {{jstor|23487889}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|When people began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw that they were fair; and they took wives for themselves of all that they chose. Then the Lord said, "My spirit shall not abide in mortals forever, for they are flesh; their days shall be one hundred twenty years." The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went in to the daughters of humans, who bore children to them. These were the heroes that were of old, warriors of renown.|Genesis 6:1–4, New Revised Standard Version}}

The word is loosely translated as ''[[giant]]s'' in some Bibles and left untranslated in others. The "sons of God" have been interpreted as [[fallen angel]]s in some traditional Jewish explanations.

According to Numbers 13:33, they later inhabited [[Canaan]] at the time of the [[Book of Joshua#Entry into the land and conquest .28chapters 2.E2.80.9312.29|Israelite conquest of Canaan]].

{{quote|The Lord said to Moses, "Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites" ... So they went up and spied out the land ... And they told him: "... Yet the people who live in the land are strong, and the towns are fortified and very large; and besides, we saw the descendants of [[Anak]] there." ... So they brought to the Israelites an unfavorable report of the land that they had spied out, saying, "The land that we have gone through as spies is a land that devours its inhabitants; and all the people that we saw in it are of great size. There we saw the Nephilim (the Anakites come from the Nephilim); and to ourselves we seemed like grasshoppers, and so we seemed to them."|Numbers 13:1–2; 21; 27–28; 32–33. New Revised Standard Version.}}

==Etymology==
The [[Brown-Driver-Briggs]] Lexicon (1908) gives the meaning of nephilim as "[[giant (mythology)|giant]]s", and holds that proposed etymologies of the word are "all very precarious".&lt;ref name="Driver Briggs Hebrew Lexicon' p.&amp;nbsp;658"&gt;Brown, Francis; Driver, S. R.; Briggs, Charles A. (1907). ''A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament''. p.&amp;nbsp;658; p. 658.&lt;/ref&gt; Many suggested interpretations are based on the assumption that the word is a derivative of Hebrew verbal root {{lang|he-Latn|n-ph-l}} ({{lang|he|נ־פ־ל}}) "fall". [[Robert Baker Girdlestone]]&lt;ref&gt;Girdlestone R.

The majority of ancient biblical versions—including the [[Septuagint]], [[Theodotion]], [[Latin Vulgate]], [[Samaritan Targum]], [[Targum Onkelos]], and [[Targum Neofiti]]—interpret the word to mean "giants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Van Ruiten |first=Jacques |title=Primaeval History Interpreted: The Rewriting of Genesis I–II in the Book of Jubilees |page=189 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] |year=2000 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1xxo82l7TeQC&amp;pg=PA189 |isbn=9789004116580}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Symmachus (translator)|Symmachus]] translates it as "the violent ones"&lt;ref name=Wright80-81&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Archie T. |title=The Origin of Evil Spirits: The Reception of Genesis 6.1–4 in Early Jewish Literature |pages=80–81 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wzh7LXv4sZkC&amp;pg=PA81 |isbn=9783161486562}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Greek text reads {{lang|grc|'οι βιαιοι}}; the singular root {{lang|grc|βιαιος}} means "violence" or "forcible" ([https://archive.org/stream/greekenglishlex00liddrich#page/282/mode/1up Liddell &amp; Scott.

==In the Hebrew Bible==
In the Hebrew Bible there are three interconnected passages referencing the ''nephilim''. Two of them come from the [[Torah|Pentateuch]] and the first occurrence is in Genesis&amp;nbsp;6:1–4, immediately before the account of [[Noah's Ark]]. Genesis&amp;nbsp;6:4 reads as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bore children to them; the same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.&lt;ref name=JPS_1917&gt;{{cite book |title=Pentateuch |publisher=Jewish Publication Society |language=en |year=1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Where the Jewish Publication Society translation&lt;ref name=JPS_1917/&gt; simply transliterated the Hebrew ''nephilim'' as "Nephilim", the [[King James Version]] translated the term as "giants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Genesis&amp;nbsp;6 in parallel Hebrew-English format |url=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0106.htm |website=Mechon Mamre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of the Nephilim is complicated by the ambiguity of Genesis&amp;nbsp;6:4, which leaves it unclear whether they are the "''sons of God''" or their offspring who are the "''mighty men of old, men of renown''". [[Richard Hess]] takes it to mean that the Nephilim are the offspring,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-first=Richard |author-last=Hess |article=Nephilim |editor-last=Freedman |editor-first=David Noel |title=The Anchor Bible Dictionary |location=New York |publisher=Doubleday |year=1997 |origyear=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does P.W. Coxon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-first=P. W. |author-last=Coxon |article=Nephilim |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yCkRz5pfxz0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Dictionary+of+deities&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aFszbVpZ1q&amp;sig=BTsr0PxWHwKqtvU25jjSvqWGv3g&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3OAvTNHPBYOjcYnS6KMD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Nephilim&amp;f=false |editor1-first=K. |editor1-last=van der Toorn |editor2-first=Bob |editor2-last=Becking |editor3-first=Pieter Willem |editor3-last=van der Horst |title=Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible |page=619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second is Numbers 13:32-33, where ten of [[the Twelve Spies]] report that they have seen fearsome giants in Canaan:&lt;blockquote&gt;And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim; and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.&lt;ref name=JPS_1917/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Outside the Pentateuch there is one more passage indirectly referencing ''nephilim'' and this is Ezekiel 32:17–32. Of special significance is Ezekiel&amp;nbsp;32:27, which contains a phrase of disputed meaning. With the traditional vowels added to the text in the medieval period, the phrase is read ''gibborim nophlim'' ("''fallen warriors''" or "''fallen [[Gibborim (biblical)|Gibborim]]''"), although some scholars read the phrase as ''gibborim nephilim'' ("''Nephilim warriors''" or "''warriors, Nephilim''").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=W. |last=Zimmerli |year=1983 |title=Ezekiel&amp;nbsp;2: A commentary on the book of the prophet Ezekiel, Chapters&amp;nbsp;25–48 |pages=168, 176 |translator-first=J.

Hendel, the phrase should be interpreted as "''warriors, the Nephilim''" in a reference to Genesis&amp;nbsp;6:4. The verse as understood by Hendel reads&lt;blockquote&gt;They lie with the warriors, the Nephilim of old, who descended to Sheol with their weapons of war. They placed their swords beneath their heads and their shields upon their bones, for the terror of the warriors was upon the land of the living.&lt;ref name=Hendel_1987/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Brian R. Doak, on the other hand, proposes to read the term as the Hebrew verb "''fallen''" (''nophlim''), not a use of the specific term "Nephilim", but still according to Doak a clear reference to the Nephilim tradition as found in Genesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Doak, Brian R. |year=2013 |title=Ezekiel's topography of the (un-)heroic dead in Ezekiel&amp;nbsp;32:17-32 |journal=Journal of Biblical Literature |volume=132 |issue=3 |pages=622 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23487889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==

=== Giants ===
{{Main|Giants (Greek mythology)}}
Most of the contemporary English translations of Genesis 6:1-4 and Numbers 13:33 render the Heb. ''nefilim'' as "giants". This tendency in turn stems from the fact that one of the earliest translation of the Hebrew Bible, the [[Septuagint]], composed in III/II century BCE, renders the said word as ''gigantes''. The choice made by the Greek translators has been later adopted into the Latin translation, the [[Vulgate]], compiled in IV/V century CE, which uses the transcription of the Greek term rather than the literal translation of the Heb. ''nefilim''. From there, the tradition of the giant progeny of the sons of God and the daughters of men spread to later medieval translations of the Bible.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Kosior|first=Wojciech|title=The Fallen (Or) Giants? The Gigantic Qualities of the Nefilim in the Hebrew Bible|date=2018-05-22|url=http://www.academia.edu/36675849/The_Fallen_Or_Giants_The_Gigantic_Qualities_of_the_Nefilim_in_the_Hebrew_Bible|work=Jewish Translation - Translating Jewishness|volume=|pages=17–38|publisher=De Gruyter|language=en|doi=10.1515/9783110550788-002|isbn=9783110550788|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision of the Greek translators to render the Heb. ''nefilim'' as Gr. ''gigantes'' is a separate matter. The Heb. ''nefilim'' means literally "the fallen ones" and the strict translation into Greek would be ''peptokotes'', which in fact appears in the Septuagint of Ezekiel 32:22-27. It seems then that the authors of Septuagint wished not only to simply translate the foreign term into Greek, but also to employ a term which would be intelligible and meaningful for their Hellenistic audiences. Given the complex of meaning of the ''nefilim'' which emerged from the three interconnected biblical passages (human-divine hybrids in Genesis 6, autochthonous people in Numbers 13 and ancient warriors trapped in the underworld in Ezekiel 32), the Greek translators recognized some similarities. First and foremost, both ''nefilim'' and ''gigantes'' were liminal figures resulting from the union of the opposite orders and as such retained the unclear status between the human and divine. Similarly, dim was their moral designation and the sources witnessed to both awe and fascination with which these figures must have been looked upon. Secondly, both were presented as impersonating chaotic qualities and posing some serious danger to gods and humans. They appeared either in the prehistoric or early historical context, but in both cases they preceded the ordering of the cosmos. Lastly, both ''gigantes'' and ''nefilim'' were clearly connected with underworld and were said to have originated from earth and as well end up closed therein.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Fallen angels===
{{main|Fallen angel}}
[[File:The Sons of God Saw the Daughters of Men That They Were Fair, by Daniel Chester French, modeled by 1918, carved 1923 - Corcoran Gallery of Art - DSC01065.JPG|thumb|''The Sons of God Saw the Daughters of Men That They Were Fair'', sculpture by [[Daniel Chester French]]]]
All early sources refer to the "sons of heaven" as angels. From the third century BCE onwards, references are found in the [[Book of Enoch|Enochic literature]], the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] (the [[Genesis Apocryphon]], the [[Damascus Document]], 4Q180), [[Jubilees]], the Testament of Reuben, [[2 Baruch]], [[Josephus]], and the [[book of Jude]] (compare with 2 Peter 2). For example: 1 Enoch 7:2 "And when the angels, (3) the sons of heaven, beheld them, they became enamoured of them, saying to each other, Come, let us select for ourselves wives from the progeny of men, and let us beget children." Some Christian apologists, such as [[Tertullian]] and especially [[Lactantius]], shared this opinion.

The earliest statement in a secondary commentary explicitly interpreting this to mean that angelic beings mated with humans can be traced to the rabbinical ''[[Targum Pseudo-Jonathan]]'' and it has since become especially commonplace in modern Christian commentaries. This line of interpretation finds additional support in the text of Genesis 6:4, which juxtaposes the sons of God (male gender, divine nature) with the daughters of men (female gender, human nature). From this parallelism it could be inferred that the sons of God are understood as some superhuman beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kosior|first=Wojciech|date=2010|title=Synowie bogów i córki człowieka.

The ''[[New American Bible]]'' commentary draws a parallel to the [[Epistle of Jude]] and the statements set forth in Genesis, suggesting that the Epistle refers implicitly to the paternity of Nephilim as heavenly beings who came to earth and had sexual intercourse with women.&lt;ref&gt;''New American Bible'', footnotes page 1370, referring to verse 6.
:The angels too, who did not keep to their own domain but deserted their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains, in gloom, for the judgement of the great day. Likewise, [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], and the surrounding towns, which, in the same manner as they, indulged in sexual promiscuity and practiced unnatural vice, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire.
:—Jude 1:6–7, ''New American Bible''.&lt;/ref&gt; The footnotes of the [[Jerusalem Bible]] suggest that the biblical author intended the Nephilim to be an "anecdote of a superhuman race".&lt;ref&gt;
:The author does not present this episode as a myth nor, on the other hand, does he deliver judgment on its actual occurrence; he records the anecdote of a superhuman race simply to serve as an example of the increase in human wickedness which was to provoke the Flood.
:—Jerusalem Bible, Genesis VI, footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christian commentators have argued against this view, citing Jesus's statement that angels do not marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Matthew 22:30| publisher=BibleGateway.com, from the New American Standard Bible translation| url =http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2022:30&amp;version=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others believe that Jesus was only referring to angels in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Deffinbaugh, ''Genesis: From Paradise to Patriarchs'', [http://www.bible.org/page.php?page_id=67 The Sons of God and the Daughters of Men]&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence cited in favor of the fallen angels interpretation includes the fact that the phrase "the sons of God" (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|בְּנֵי הָֽאֱלֹהִים}}; or "sons of the gods") is used twice outside of Genesis chapter 6, in the Book of Job (1:6 and 2:1) where the phrase explicitly references angels. The Septuagint manuscript [[Codex Alexandrinus]] reading of Genesis 6:2 renders this phrase as "the angels of God" while [[Codex Vaticanus]] reads "sons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Swete |first=Henry Barclay |title=The Old Testament in Greek according to the Septuagint (Volume 1) |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1901 |page=9 |url=https://archive.org/stream/oldtestamentingr01swetuoft#page/n40/mode/1up}} Greek text: 'οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ Θεοῦ'&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Targum Pseudo-Jonathan]] identifies the Nephilim as [[Shemihaza]] and the angels in the name list from 1 Enoch.&lt;ref&gt;Archie T. Wright ''The origin of evil spirits: the reception of Genesis 6.1–4 6:1–4 in Early Jewish Literature.'' 2005 Page 82 "Targum Neofiti's rendition of Nephilim follows that of Onkelos ... Targum Pseudo-Jonathan interprets the Genesis 6.4 passage with significant changes, which indicate a strong negative"&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second Temple Judaism====
{{Main|Book of Enoch|Book of Jubilees|Watcher (angel)}}
{{see also|Second Temple Judaism}}
The story of the Nephilim is further elaborated in the [[Book of Enoch]]. The Greek, Aramaic, and main Ge'ez manuscripts of 1 Enoch and [[Jubilees]] obtained in the 19th century and held in the [[British Museum]] and [[Vatican Library]], connect the origin of the Nephilim with the fallen angels, and in particular with the [[Watcher (angel)|egrḗgoroi]] (''watchers''). [[Samyaza]], an [[angel]] of high rank, is described as leading a rebel sect of angels in a descent to earth to have sexual intercourse with human females:

{{quote|And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days were born unto them beautiful and comely daughters. And the angels, the children of the heaven, saw and lusted after them, and said to one another: "Come, let us choose us wives from among the children of men and beget us children." And Semjaza, who was their leader, said unto them: "I fear ye will not indeed agree to do this deed, and I alone shall have to pay the penalty of a great sin." And they all answered him and said: "Let us all swear an oath, and all bind ourselves by mutual imprecations not to abandon this plan but to do this thing." Then sware they all together and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it. And they were in all two hundred; who descended in the days of Jared on the summit of Mount Hermon, and they called it Mount Hermon, because they had sworn and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/ethiopian/enoch/1watchers/watchers.htm|title=Book 1: Watchers|accessdate=14 August 2012|publisher=Academy for Ancient Texts, Timothy R. Carnahan}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In this tradition, the children of the Nephilim are called the [[Elioud]], who are considered a separate race from the Nephilim, but they share the fate of the Nephilim.

According to these texts, the fallen angels who [[human reproduction|begat]] the Nephilim were cast into [[Tartarus]] (2 Peter 2:4, Jude 1:6) (Greek Enoch 20:2),&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Charles ''A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Revelation of St John'' p239 "He may be Uriel, if it is legitimate to compare 1 Enoch xx. 2, according to which he was the angel set over the world and Tartarus (''ὁ ἐπὶ τοῦ κόσμου καὶ τοῦ Ταρτάρου''). In 1 Enoch, Tartarus is the nether world generally.&lt;/ref&gt; a place of "total darkness". However, Jubilees also states that God granted ten percent of the disembodied spirits of the Nephilim to remain after the flood, as [[demon]]s, to try to lead the human race astray until the [[final Judgment]].

In addition to ''Enoch'', the ''[[Book of Jubilees]]'' (7:21–25) also states that ridding the Earth of these Nephilim was one of God's purposes for flooding the Earth in Noah's time. These works describe the Nephilim as being evil giants.

There are also allusions to these descendants in the [[deuterocanonical books]] of ''[[Book of Judith|Judith]]'' (16:6), ''[[Sirach]]'' (16:7), ''[[Book of Baruch|Baruch]]'' (3:26–28), and ''[[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom of Solomon]]'' (14:6), and in the non-deuterocanonical ''[[3 Maccabees]]'' (2:4).

The New Testament [[Epistle of Jude]] (14–15) cites from [[1 Enoch]] 1:9, which many scholars believe is based on [[Deuteronomy]] 33:2.&lt;ref&gt;"1.9 In 'He comes with ten thousands of His holy ones' the text reproduces the Masoretic of Deut. 33² in reading אָתָא = ''ἔρχεται'', whereas the three Targums, the Syriac and Vulgate read אִתֹּה = ''μετ' αὐτοῦ''. Here the LXX diverges wholly. The reading אתא is recognised as original. The writer of 1–5 therefore used the Hebrew text and presumably wrote in Hebrew." R.H.Charles, Book of Enoch: Together with a Reprint of the Greek Fragments London 1912, p.lviii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"We may note especially that 1:1, 3–4, 9 allude unmistakably to Deuteronomy 33:1–2 (along with other passages in the Hebrew Bible), implying that the author, like some other Jewish writers, read Deuteronomy 33–34, the last words of Moses in the Torah, as prophecy of the future history of Israel, and 33:2 as referring to the eschatological theophany of God as judge." Richard Bauckham, The Jewish world around the New Testament: collected essays. 1999 p276&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The introduction.. picks up various biblical passages and re-interprets them, applying them to Enoch. Two passages are central to it The first is Deuteronomy 33:1 .. the second is Numbers 24:3–4 Michael E. Stone Selected studies in pseudepigrapha and apocrypha with special reference to the Armenian Tradition (Studia in Veteris Testamenti Pseudepigrapha No 9) p.422.&lt;/ref&gt; To most commentators this confirms that the author of Jude regarded the Enochic interpretations of Genesis 6 as correct; however, others&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Michael Green ''The second epistle general of Peter, and the general epistle of Jude'' p59&lt;/ref&gt; have questioned this.

===Descendants of Seth and Cain===
References to the offspring of Seth rebelling from God and mingling with the daughters of [[Cain]] are found from the second century CE onwards in both Christian and Jewish sources (e.g. Rabbi [[Shimon bar Yochai]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Sextus Julius Africanus]], and the [[Clementine literature|Letters attributed to St. Clement]]). It is also the view expressed in the modern canonical [[Amharic]] [[Bible translations (Amharic)|Ethiopian Orthodox Bible]]: Henok 2:1–3 "and the Offspring of Seth, who were upon the Holy Mount, saw them and loved them. And they told one another, 'Come, let us choose for us daughters from Cain's children; let us bear children for us.'"

Orthodox Judaism has taken a stance against the idea that Genesis 6 refers to angels or that angels could intermarry with men. [[Shimon bar Yochai]] pronounced a curse on anyone teaching this idea. [[Rashi]] and [[Nachmanides]] followed this. [[Pseudo-Philo]] (''Biblical Antiquities'' 3:1–3) may also imply that the "sons of God" were human.&lt;ref&gt;James L. Kugel ''Traditions of the Bible: A Guide to the Bible As It Was at the Start of the Common Era'' (9780674791510)&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, most Jewish commentaries and translations describe the Nephilim as being from the offspring of "sons of nobles", rather than from "sons of God" or "sons of angels".&lt;ref&gt;"The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the '''sons of the nobles''' would come to the daughters of man, and they would bear for them; they are the mighty men, who were of old, the men of renown."—Genesis 6:4 [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/8171/showrashi/true/jewish/Chapter-6.htm (chabad.org translation)]&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the rendering suggested in the [[Targum Onqelos]], [[Symmachus (translator)#His translation|Symmachus]] and the [[Samaritan Targum]], which read "sons of the rulers", where [[Targum Neophyti]] reads "sons of the judges".

Likewise, a long-held view among some Christians is that the "sons of God" were the formerly righteous descendants of Seth who rebelled, while the "daughters of men" were the unrighteous descendants of Cain, and the Nephilim the offspring of their union.&lt;ref&gt;
:Later Judaism and almost all the earliest ecclesiastical writers identify the "sons of God" with the fallen angels; but from the fourth century onwards, as the idea of angelic natures becomes less material, the Fathers commonly take the "sons of God" to be Seth's descendants and the "daughters of men" those of Cain.
:—Jerusalem Bible, Genesis VI, footnote.&lt;/ref&gt; This view, dating to at least the 1st century AD in Jewish literature as described above, is also found in Christian sources from the 3rd century if not earlier, with references throughout the [[Clementine literature]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/aa/aa2.htm|title=KITĀB AL-MAGĀLL OR THE BOOK OF THE ROLLS.

Holders of this view have looked for support in Jesus' statement that "in those days before the flood ''they'' [humans] were ... ''marrying and giving in marriage''" ({{bibleverse||Matthew|24:38|NASB}}).&lt;ref&gt;Rick Wade, ''Answering Email'', [http://www.probe.org/site/c.fdKEIMNsEoG/b.4223637/k.8840/Answering_Email.htm The Nephilim] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331201021/http://www.probe.org/site/c.fdKEIMNsEoG/b.4223637/k.8840/Answering_Email.htm |date=31 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some individuals and groups, including [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], [[John Chrysostom]], and [[John Calvin]], take the view of Genesis 6:2 that the "Angels" who fathered the Nephilim referred to certain human males from the lineage of [[Seth]], who were called ''sons of God'' probably in reference to their prior [[Covenant (religion)|covenant]] with [[Yahweh]] (cf. {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|14:1|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Deut|32:5|HE}}); according to these sources, these men had begun to pursue bodily interests, and so took wives of ''the daughters of men'', e.g., those who were descended from [[Cain]] or from any people who did not worship God.

This also is the view of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mahiberekidusan.org/Default.aspx?tabid=98&amp;ctl=Details&amp;mid=371&amp;ItemID=75 Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Sunday Schools Department: The "Holy Angels"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727055448/http://www.mahiberekidusan.org/Default.aspx?tabid=98&amp;ctl=Details&amp;mid=371&amp;ItemID=75 |date=27 July 2011 }} (in Amharic)&lt;/ref&gt; supported by their own [[Ge'ez]] manuscripts and [[Amharic]] translation of the [[Bible translations (Amharic)|Haile Selassie Bible]]—where the books of ''[[1 Enoch]]'' and ''[[Jubilees]]'', counted as canonical by this church, differ from western academic editions.&lt;ref&gt;The Amharic text of Henok 2:1–3 (i.e. 1 En) in the 1962 Ethiopian Orthodox Bible may be translated as follows: "After mankind abounded, it became thus: And in that season, handsome comely children were born to them; and the Offspring of Seth, who were upon the Holy Mount, saw them and loved them. And they told one another, "Come,let us choose for us daughters from Cain's children; let us bear children for us."&lt;/ref&gt; The "Sons of Seth view" is also the view presented in a few extra-biblical, yet ancient works, including [[Clementine literature]], the 3rd century ''[[Cave of Treasures]]'', and the ca. 6th Century [[Ge'ez]] work ''The [[Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan]]''. In these sources, these offspring of Seth were said to have disobeyed God, by breeding with the Cainites and producing wicked children "who were all unlike", thus angering God into bringing about the Deluge, as in the ''Conflict'':

{{quote|Certain wise men of old wrote concerning them, and say in their [sacred] books that angels came down from heaven and mingled with the daughters of Cain, who bare unto them these giants. But these [wise men]  err in what they say. God forbid such a thing, that angels who are spirits, should be found committing sin with human beings. Never, that cannot be. And if such a thing were of the nature of angels, or Satans, that fell, they would not leave one woman on earth, undefiled ... But many men say, that angels came down from heaven, and joined themselves to women, and had children by them. This cannot be true. But they were children of Seth, who were of the children of Adam, that dwelt on the mountain, high up, while they preserved their virginity, their innocence and their glory like angels; and were then called 'angels of God.' But when they transgressed and mingled with the children of Cain, and begat children, ill-informed men said, that angels had come down from heaven, and mingled with the daughters of men, who bear them giants.}}

===Arguments from culture and mythology===
In [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]aic culture, the term ''niyphelah'' refers to the [[Orion (constellation)|Constellation of Orion]] and ''nephilim'' to the offspring of [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]] in mythology.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Peake's commentary on the Bible]]'' 1919&lt;!-- edition, date, page? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However the [[Brown-Driver-Briggs]] lexicon notes this as a "dubious etymology" and "all very precarious".&lt;ref name="Driver Briggs Hebrew Lexicon' p.658"&gt;''Brown Driver Briggs Hebrew Lexicon'' p. 658; Strongs H5307&lt;/ref&gt;

J. C. Greenfield mentions that "it has been proposed that the tale of the Nephilim, alluded to in Genesis 6 is based on some of the negative aspects of the [[Apkallu]] tradition".&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Greenfield, Article ''Apkallu'' in [https://books.google.com/books?id=yCkRz5pfxz0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Dictionary+of+Deities+and+Demons&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aFszcWlY3q&amp;sig=P5ibNUm6cJFufa910KKYAhrGpbM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nH4xTNu_GoLBcZvVvcIH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=apkallu&amp;f=false K. van der Toorn, Bob Becking, Pieter Willem van der Horst, "Dictionary of deities and demons in the Bible", pp.72–4]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[apkallu]]'' in [[Sumerian mythology]] were seven legendary [[culture hero]]es from before the [[Flood myth|Flood]], of human descent, but possessing extraordinary wisdom from the gods, and one of the seven ''apkallu'', [[Adapa]], was therefore called "son of [[Ea (Babylonian god)|Ea]]" the Babylonian god, despite his human origin.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Greenfield, Article ''Apkallu'' in [https://books.google.com/booksid=yCkRz5pfxz0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Dictionary+of+Deities+and+Demons&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aFszcWlY3q&amp;sig=P5ibNUm6cJFufa910KKYAhrGpbM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nH4xTNu_GoLBcZvVvcIH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=apkallu&amp;f=false K. van der Toorn, Bob Becking, Pieter Willem van der Horst, "Dictionary of deities and demons in the Bible", pp.73]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fossil remains==
[[Cotton Mather]] believed that [[fossil]]ized leg bones and teeth discovered near [[Albany, New York|Albany]], New York in 1705 were the remains of nephilim who perished in [[Genesis flood narrative|a great flood]]. However, [[paleontologist]]s have identified these as [[mastodon]] remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Rigal |first = Laura |title = American Manufactory: Art, Labor, and the World of Things in the Early Republic |publisher = Princeton University Press |year = 2001 |page = 91 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-aNPS9dAUrEC&amp;pg=PA91 |isbn = 9780691089515}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Rose |first = Mark |title = When Giants Roamed the Earth |journal = [[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]] |volume=58 |number=6 |date = November–December 2005 |url = http://archive.archaeology.org/0511/etc/giants.html |accessdate = 15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
{{Main|Nephilim in popular culture}}
The name and idea of Nephilim, like many other religious concepts, is sometimes used in popular culture. Examples include the [[gothic rock]] band [[Fields of the Nephilim]], ''[[Victor Renquist|The Renquist Quartet]]'' novels by [[Mick Farren]], ''[[The Mortal Instruments]]'' series by [[Cassandra Clare]], the ''[[Hush, Hush (series)|Hush, Hush]]'' series by [[Becca Fitzpatrick]], and TV series ''[[All Souls (The X-Files)|The X-Files]]'' and ''[[Supernatural (season 8)#ep171|Supernatural]]''. In the video game series [[Darksiders]], the [[four horsemen of the apocalypse]] are said to be nephilim, wherein the nephilim were created by the unholy union of angels and demons. The main characters of the game ''[[DmC: Devil May Cry]]'' (2013), Dante and Vergil, are also referred to as Nephilim; being the offspring of the demon Sparda and the angel Eva.

The '''New York Public Library''' ('''NYPL''') is a [[public library]] system in [[New York City]]. With nearly 53 million items and 92 locations, the New York Public Library is the second largest public library in the United States (behind the [[Library of Congress]]) and the [[List of largest libraries|third largest in the world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.cioinsight.com/it-strategy/cloud-virtualization/cto-takes-the-new-york-public-library-digital.html|title = CTO Takes the New York Public Library Digital|last = Burke|first = Pat|date = July 2, 2015|work = CIO Insight|access-date = 2015-07-12|publisher = Quinstreet Enterprise}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a private, non-governmental, independently managed, nonprofit corporation operating with both private and public financing.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations. Financial Statements and Supplemental Schedules, June 2016'', page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The library has branches in the boroughs of [[Manhattan]], the [[The Bronx|Bronx]], and [[Staten Island]] and affiliations with academic and professional libraries in the metropolitan area of [[New York State]]. The City of New York's other two boroughs, [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]], are served by the [[Brooklyn Public Library]] and the [[Queens Library]], respectively. The branch libraries are open to the general public and consist of [[Lending library|circulating libraries]]. The New York Public Library also has four [[Research library|research libraries]], which are also open to the general public.

The library, officially [[Charter (New York)|chartered]] as '''''The New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations''''', was developed in the 19th century, founded from an amalgamation of grass-roots libraries and social libraries of bibliophiles and the wealthy, aided by the philanthropy of the wealthiest Americans of their age.

The [[New York Public Library Main Branch]] building, which is easily recognizable by its lion statues named Patience and Fortitude that sit either side of the entrance, was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1965,&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt; listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1966,&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nr.nps.gov/|title=National Register Information System|date=2007-01-23|work=National Register of Historic Places|publisher=National Park Service|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002195303/http://www.nr.nps.gov/|archivedate=October 2, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and designated a [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City Landmark]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="nycl1"&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Public Library|url=http://www.neighborhoodpreservationcenter.org/db/bb_files/NY-PUBLIC-LIBRARY-5TH-AVE.pdf|publisher=New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|accessdate=24 June 2016|date=January 11, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been featured in many television shows, including ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and ''[[Sex and the City]]'', as well as films such as ''[[The Wiz]]'' in 1978, ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' in 1984, and ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'' in 2004.

==History==

===Founding===
[[File:New York Public Library 1908c.jpg|thumb|The New York Public Library main building during late stage construction in 1908, the lion statues not yet installed at the entrance]]
At the behest of [[Joseph Cogswell]], [[John Jacob Astor]] placed a [[Codicil (will)|codicil]] in his will to bequeath $400,000 (equivalent of ${{Inflation|US|0.4|1848|r=1}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) for the creation of a public library.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lydenberg|1916a|pp=556–563}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Astor's death in 1848, the resulting board of trustees executed the will's conditions and constructed the [[Astor Library]] in 1854 in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lydenberg|1916a|pp=563–573}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library created was a free reference library; its books were not permitted to circulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lydenberg|1916a|pp=573–574}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1872, the Astor Library was described in a ''New York Times'' editorial as a "major reference and research resource",&lt;ref name=plhist/&gt; but, "Popular it certainly is not, and, so greatly is it lacking in the essentials of a public library, that its stores might almost as well be under lock and key, for any access the masses of the people can get thereto".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C0CE7DE1F39E73ABC4C52DFB7668389669FDE|title=Editorial: Free Public Libraries|work=The New York Times|date=January 14, 1872|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An act of the [[New York State Legislature]] incorporated the [[Lenox Library (New York City)|Lenox Library]] in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;An Act to Incorporate the Trustees of the Lenox Library ([[Laws of New York|L. 1870]], ch. 2; L. 1892, ch. 166)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lydenberg |1916b|p=688}}; [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1870-01-24/ed-1/seq-4/ A Superb Gift]&lt;/ref&gt; The library was built on [[Fifth Avenue]], between 70th and 71th Streets, in 1877. [[Bibliophilia|Bibliophile]] and philanthropist [[James Lenox]] donated a vast collection of his [[Americana]], art works, manuscripts, and rare books,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lydenberg |1916b|pp=685–689}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the first [[Gutenberg Bible]] in the [[New World]].&lt;ref name=plhist/&gt; At its inception, the library charged admission and did not permit physical access to any literary items.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lydenberg |1916b|pp=690, 694–695}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gutenberg Bible, Lenox Copy, New York Public Library, 2009. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|[[James Lenox|Lenox]] copy of the Gutenberg Bible in the New York Public Library]]

Former [[Governor of New York]] and presidential candidate [[Samuel J. Tilden]] believed that a library with citywide reach was required, and upon his death in 1886, he [[bequest|bequeathed]] the bulk of his fortune—about {{Nowrap|$2.4 million}} (equivalent of ${{Inflation|US|2.4|1886|r=0}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}})—to "establish and maintain a free library and reading room in the city of New York".&lt;ref name=plhist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypl.org/help/about-nypl/history|title=History of the New York Public Library|publisher=nypl.org|accessdate=June 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This money would sit untouched in a [[Tilden Trust|trust]] for several years, until [[John Bigelow]], a New York attorney, and [[Andrew Haswell Green]], both trustees of the Tilden fortune, came up with an idea to merge two of the city's largest libraries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Both the Astor and Lenox libraries were struggling financially. Although New York City already had [[List of libraries in 19th-century New York City|numerous libraries]] in the 19th century, almost all of them were privately funded and many charged admission or usage fees. Bigelow, the most prominent supporter of the plan to merge the libraries found support in [[Lewis Cass Ledyard]], a member of the Tilden Board, as well as [[John Lambert Cadwalader|John Cadwalader]], on the Astor board. Eventually, [[John Stewart Kennedy]], president of the Lenox board came to support the plan as well. On May 23, 1895, Bigelow, Cadwalader, and [[George L. Rives]] agreed to create "The New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{harvnb|Reed|2011|pp=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was hailed as an example of private philanthropy for the public good.&lt;ref name=plhist/&gt; On December 11, [[John Shaw Billings]] was named as the library's first director.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The newly established library consolidated with the grass-roots [[New York Free Circulating Library]] in February 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Lent Eleven Million Books | date = April 14, 1901 | url = http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1901-04-14/ed-1/seq-16/ | work = [[New-York Tribune]] | page = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Carnegie Libraries--&gt;In March, [[Andrew Carnegie]] tentatively agreed to donate {{Nowrap|$5.2 million}} (equivalent of ${{Inflation|US|5.2|1901|r=0}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) to construct sixty-five [[Carnegie library|branch libraries]] in the city, with the requirement that they be operated and maintained by the City of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1901/03/17/117957380.html|title=CITY WILL ACCEPT MR.

[[Image:NYPL portals.JPG|thumb|right|Cross-view of classical details in the entrance portico]]

===Collection development===
The notable New York author [[Washington Irving]] was a close friend of Astor for decades and had helped the philanthropist design the Astor Library. Irving served as President of the library's Board of Trustees from 1848 until his death in 1859, shaping the library's collecting policies with his strong sensibility regarding European intellectual life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andrew |last=Myers |title=Washington Irving and the Astor Library |journal=Bulletin of the New York Public Library |year=1968 |volume=72 |issue=6 |pages=378–399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the library hired nationally prominent experts to guide its collections policies; they reported directly to directors [[John Shaw Billings]] (who also developed the [[National Library of Medicine]]), [[Edwin H. Anderson]], [[Harry M. Lydenberg]], [[Franklin F. Hopper]], Ralph A. Beals, and Edward Freehafer (1954–70).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gilbert W. |last=Chapman |title=Edward G. Freehafer: An Appreciation |journal=Bulletin of the New York Public Library |year=1970 |volume=74 |issue=10 |pages=625–628}}&lt;/ref&gt; They emphasized expertise, objectivity, and a very broad worldwide range of knowledge in acquiring, preserving, organizing, and making available to the general population nearly 12 million books and 26.5 million additional items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Phyllis |last=Dain |title='A Coral Island': A Century of Collection Development in the Research Libraries of the New York Public Library |journal=Biblion |year=1995 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=5–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The directors in turn reported to an elite board of trustees, chiefly elderly, well-educated, philanthropic, predominantly Protestant, upper-class white men with commanding positions in American society. They saw their role as protecting the library's autonomy from politicians as well as bestowing upon it status, resources, and prudent care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Phyllis |last=Dain |title=Public Library Governance and a Changing New York City |journal=Libraries &amp; Culture |date=March 1991 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=219–250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative of many major board decisions was the purchase in 1931 of the private library of Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich (1847–1909), uncle of the last [[tsar]]. This was one of the largest acquisitions of Russian books and photographic materials; at the time, the Soviet government had a policy of selling its cultural collections abroad for gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Edward |last=Kasinec |first2=Robert H. |last2=Davis, Jr. |title=Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich (1847–1909) and His Library |journal=Journal of the History of Collections |year=1990 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages= 135–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The military drew extensively from the library's map and book collections in the world wars, including hiring its staff. For example, the Map Division's chief Walter Ristow was appointed as head of the geography section of the War Department's New York Office of Military Intelligence from 1942 to 1945. Ristow and his staff discovered, copied, and loaned thousands of strategic, rare or unique maps to war agencies in need of information not available through other sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Alice C. |last=Hudson |title=The Library's Map Division Goes to War, 1941–45 |journal=Biblion |year=1995 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=126–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organizers of the New York Public Library, wanting an imposing main branch, chose a central site available at the two-block section of Fifth Avenue between 40th and 42nd Streets.

On May 23, 1911, the main branch of the New York Public Library was officially opened in a ceremony presided over by President [[William Howard Taft]].

By the 1970s, it was clear the collection eventually would outgrow the existing Fifth Avenue structure. In the 1980s, the central research library added more than {{convert|125,000|ft2|m2}} of space and literally miles of bookshelf space to make room for future acquisitions. This expansion required a major construction project in which [[Bryant Park]], directly west of the library, was closed to the public and excavated. The new library facilities were built below ground level and the park was restored above it.

In the three decades before 2007, the building's interior was gradually renovated.&lt;ref name=NYT20071220/&gt; On December 20, 2007, the library announced it would undertake a three-year, {{Nowrap|$50 million}} renovation of the building exterior, which has suffered damage from weathering and pollution.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nypl.org/press/2007/FacadeRestor.cfm The New York Public Library Will Restore its Fifth Avenue Building's Historic Facade / Project to be Completed in Time for Building's 2011 Centennial"], 2007-12-20, New York Public Library Web site, accessed December 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The renovation was completed on time, and on February 2, 2011, the refurbished facade was unveiled.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://bestplaces.nydailynews.com/voyeur/new-york-public-library-gets-50m-facelift-100th-birthday New York Public Library gets a 50M facelift for 100th birthday"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206113052/http://bestplaces.nydailynews.com/voyeur/new-york-public-library-gets-50m-facelift-100th-birthday |date=February 6, 2011 }}, ''New York Daily News,'' 2011-02-02, accessed February 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The restoration design was overseen by [[Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc.]], whose previous projects include the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'s limestone facades and the [[American Museum of Natural History]], made of granite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robin |last=Pogrebin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/20/nyregion/20library.html?ref=arts |title=A Centennial Face-Lift for a Beaux-Arts Gem |newspaper=New York Times |date=20 December 2007 |accessdate=March 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These renovations were underwritten by a $100 million gift from philanthropist [[Stephen A.

====Other research branches====
[[File:SIBL.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Science, Industry and Business library]]
In the 1990s, the New York Public Library decided to relocate that portion of the research collection devoted to science, technology, and business to a new location. The library purchased and adapted the former [[B. Altman]] [[department store]] on [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]]. In 1995, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the library, the {{Nowrap|$100 million}} Science, Industry and Business Library (SIBL), designed by [[Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates]] of Manhattan, opened to the public. Upon the creation of the SIBL, the central research library on 42nd Street was renamed the Humanities and Social Sciences Library.

Today there are four research libraries that comprise the NYPL's research library system; together they hold approximately 44,000,000 items. Total item holdings, including the collections of the Branch Libraries, are {{Nowrap|50.6 million}}. The Humanities and Social Sciences Library on 42nd Street is still the heart of the NYPL's research library system. The SIBL, with approximately {{Nowrap|2 million}} volumes and 60,000 periodicals, is the nation's largest public library devoted solely to science and business.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110609043907/http://legacy.www.nypl.org/press/siblbg.cfm "Science, Industry and Business Library"], June 19, 2003 Press Release, New York Public Library. Retrieved June 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The NYPL's two other research libraries are the [[Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture|Schomburg Center for Research and Black Culture]], located at 135th Street and Lenox Avenue in [[Harlem]], and the [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]], located at [[Lincoln Center]]. In addition to their reference collections, the Library for the Performing Arts and the SIBL also have circulating components that are administered as ordinary branch libraries.

===Recent history===
[[File:Drexel 4180 front recto.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Recto of a 16th-century [[music manuscript]] found in the front pastedown of [[Drexel 4180—4185|Drexel 4180]], a manuscript in the Music Division of the New York Public Library]]
The New York Public Library was not created by government statute. From its earliest days, the library was formed from a partnership of city government with private philanthropy.&lt;ref name=plhist/&gt; As of 2010, the research libraries in the system are largely funded with private money, and the branch or circulating libraries are financed primarily with city government funds. Until 2009, the research and branch libraries operated almost entirely as separate systems, but that year various operations were merged. By early 2010, the NYPL staff had been reduced by about 16 percent, in part through the consolidations.&lt;ref name=ktmsm&gt;Taylor, Kate, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/22/books/22library.html?ref=arts "That Mighty Sorting Machine Is Certainly One for the Books"], ''New York Times'', April 21, 2010, retrieved same day&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, as part of the consolidation program, the NYPL moved various back-office operations to a new Library Services Center building in Long Island City. A former warehouse was renovated for this purpose for {{Nowrap|$50 million}}. In the basement, a new, {{Nowrap|$2.3 million}} book sorter uses bar codes on library items to sort them for delivery to 132 branch libraries. At two-thirds the length of a football field, the machine is the largest of its kind in the world, according to library officials. Books located in one branch and requested from another go through the sorter, which use has cut the previous waiting time by at least a day. Together with 14 library employees, the machine can sort 7,500 items an hour (or 125 a minute). On the first floor of the Library Services Center is an ordering and cataloging office; on the second, the digital imaging department (formerly at the Main Branch building) and the manuscripts and archives division, where the air is kept cooler; on the third, the Barbara Goldsmith Preservation Division, with a staff of 10 (as of 2010) but designed for as many as 30 employees.&lt;ref name=ktmsm/&gt;

The NYPL maintains a force of NYC special patrolmen, who provide security and protection to various libraries, and NYPL special investigators, who oversee security operations at the library facilities. These officials have on-duty arrest authority granted by the [[New York Penal Law]]. Some library branches contract for security guards.

===BookOps===
In February 2013, the New York and [[Brooklyn Public Library|Brooklyn]] public libraries announced that they would merge their technical services departments. The new department is called BookOps. The proposed merger anticipates a savings of $2 million for the Brooklyn Public Library and $1.5 million for the New York Public Library. Although not currently part of the merger, it is expected that the [[Queens Library]] will eventually share some resources with the other city libraries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2013/02/managing-libraries/nypl-brooklyn-merge-technical-services/ Meredith Schwartz, "NYPL, Brooklyn Merge Technical Services"], ''Library Journal,'' February 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/nypl.org/bookops/home|title=BookOps|access-date=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, circulation in the New York Public Library systems and [[Brooklyn Public Library]] systems has increased by 59%. Located in [[Long Island City]], BookOps was created as a way to save money while improving patrons service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.urbanlibraries.org/bookops---shared-technical-services-between-bpl---nypl-innovation-788.php?page_id=172|title=BookOps - Shared Technical Services between BPL &amp; NYPL {{!}} Urban Libraries Council|website=www.urbanlibraries.org|access-date=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The services of BookOps include the Selection Team which "acquires, describes, prepares, and delivers new items for the circulating collections of Brooklyn Public Library (BPL) and New York Public Library, and for the general collections of NYPL's research libraries."  Under the Selection Team are the Acquisitions Department, the Cataloging Department, The Collections Processing Unit, and the Logistics Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/nypl.org/bookops/services|title=SERVICES - BookOps.org|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this facility opened, all the aforementioned departments were housed in different locations with no accountability between them, and items sometimes taking up to two weeks to reach their intended destination. BookOps now has all departments in one building and in 2015 sorted almost eight million items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://viewing.nyc/behind-the-scenes-at-bookops-the-new-york-public-librarys-laser-sorting-facility/|title=Behind the Scenes at BookOps, the New York Public Library's Laser Sorting Facility|date=2016-02-03|work=Viewing NYC|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building has numerous rooms, including a room dedicated to caring for damaged books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/09/20/keepers-of-the-secrets/|title=Keepers of the Secrets {{!}} Village Voice|access-date=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversies ===
The consolidations and changes in collections have promoted continuing debate and controversy since 2004 when [[David Ferriero]] was named the Andrew W. Mellon Director and Chief Executive of the Research Libraries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6495194.html Norman Oder, "One NYPL," Many Questions, ''Library Journal'', November 1, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704030129/http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6495194.html |date=July 4, 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; NYPL had engaged consultants [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] to survey the institution, and Ferriero endorsed the survey's report as a big step "in the process of reinventing the library".&lt;ref&gt;Oder, Norman. "NYPL Reorganization Coming", ''Library Journal'' (October 1, 2007). Vol. 132, Issue 16, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The consolidation program has resulted in the elimination of subjects such as the Asian and Middle East Division (formerly named Oriental Division), as well as the Slavic and Baltic Division.&lt;ref name="Nation"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sherman |first=Scott | url=http://www.thenation.com/article/164881/upheaval-new-york-public-library?page=full | title=Upheaval at the New York Public Library | journal=The Nation | date=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of innovations in recent years have been criticized. In 2004 NYPL announced participation in the [[Google Books Library Project]]. By agreement between Google and major international libraries, selected collections of public domain books would be scanned in their entirety and made available online for free to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypl.org/press/2004/google.cfm New York Public Library + Google]&lt;/ref&gt; The negotiations between the two partners called for each to project guesses about ways that libraries are likely to expand in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Rothstein, Edward.

November 14, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the terms of the agreement, the data cannot be crawled or harvested by any other search engine; no downloading or redistribution is allowed. The partners and a wider community of research libraries can share the content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://litablog.org/2006/07/11/lita-preconference-contracting-for-content-in-a-digital-world/|title=LITA PreConference: Contracting for Content in a Digital World|work=LITA Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sale of the separately endowed former [[Donnell Library]] in midtown provoked controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Sewell. [http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/sale-of-former-donnell-library-is-back-on-track/  "Sale of Former Donnell Library Is Back on Track"], ''New York Times.'' July 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The elimination of Donnell was a result of the dissolution of children's, young adult and foreign language collections. The Donnell Media Center was also dismantled, the bulk of its collection relocated at the [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]] as the Reserve Film and Video Collection, with parts of its collection redistributed.&lt;ref name="answers3"&gt;LeClerc, Paul.

Several veteran librarians have retired, and the number of age-level specialists in the boroughs have been cut back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=NYPL head = Natl. archivist; New Catalog, Restructuring |journal=Library Journal |date=August 1, 2009 |volume=134 |issue=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|List of New York Public Library Branches}}
The New York Public Library system maintains commitment as a public lending library through its branch libraries in [[The Bronx]], [[Manhattan, New York|Manhattan]] and [[Staten Island, New York|Staten Island]], including the Mid-Manhattan Library, the Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library, the circulating collections of the Science, Industry and Business Library, and the circulating collections of the Library for the Performing Arts.

====One NYPL====
In 2006, the library adopted a new strategy that merged branch and research libraries into "One NYPL". The organizational change developed a unified online catalog for all the collections, and one card to that could be used at both branch and research libraries.&lt;ref name="answers3"/&gt; The 2009 website and online-catalog transition had some initial difficulties, but ultimately the catalogues were integrated.&lt;ref&gt;Slotnik, Daniel E.

===Community outreach===
The New York Public Library offers many services to its patrons. Some of these services include services for immigrants. New York City is known for having a welcoming environment when its comes to people of diverse backgrounds. The library offers free work and life skills classes. These are offered in conjunction with volunteers and partnerships at the library. In addition, the library offers non-English speakers materials and coaching for them to acclimate to the U.S. For these non-English speakers, the library offers free ESOL classes. An initiative was taken in July 2018, NYC library card holders are allowed to visit [[Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney Museum]], the [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao|Guggenheim]] and 31 other prominent New York cultural institutions for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/arts/design/library-card-culture-pass-new-york-museums-free.html|title=A Library Card Will Get You Into the Guggenheim (and 32 Other Places)|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
The NYPL, like all public libraries in New York, is granted a [[Charter (New York)|charter]] from the [[Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York]] and is registered with the [[New York State Education Department]].&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;{{citation|title=Handbook for Library Trustees of New York State|edition=2015|first=Jerry|last=Nichols|publisher=[[New York State Library]]|url=http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/libdev/trustees/handbook/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic powers and duties of all library boards of trustees are defined in the [[Consolidated Laws of New York|Education Law]] and are subject to Part 90 of Title 8 of the [[New York Codes, Rules and Regulations]].&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

The NYPL's charter, as restated and granted in 1975, gives the name of the corporation as ''The New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations''. The library is governed by a board of trustees, composed of between 25–42 trustees of several classes who collectively choose their own successors, including ''ex officio'' the [[Mayor of New York City|New York City Mayor]], [[New York City Council|New York City Council Speaker]] and [[New York City Comptroller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woodrum |first=Pat |date=1989 |title=Managing Public Libraries in the 21st Century |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XIFchyF3ikQC&amp;pg=PA84 |location= |publisher= |pages=84–85 |isbn=0-86656-945-6 |lccn=89-20016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The historian [[David McCullough]] has described the New York Public Library as one of the five most important libraries in the United States; the others are the [[Library of Congress]], the [[Boston Public Library]], and the university libraries of [[Harvard University Library|Harvard]] and [[Yale University Library|Yale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Simon &amp; Schuster:David McCullough |url=http://www.simonsays.com/content/destination.cfm?tab=1&amp;pid=328883&amp;feature_id=3375 |accessdate=October 12, 2007 |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060929035702/http://www.simonsays.com/content/destination.cfm?tab=1&amp;pid=328883&amp;feature_id=3375 |archivedate = September 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2011}}

The New York Public Library has been [[Lists of references to the New York Public Library in popular culture|referenced numerous times in popular culture]]. The library has appeared as a setting and topic multiple times in film, poetry, music, television, and music.

==Other New York City library systems==
The New York Public Library, serving [[Manhattan]], the [[Bronx]], and [[Staten Island]], is one of three separate and independent public library systems in New York City. The other two library systems are the [[Brooklyn Public Library]] and the [[Queens Library]].

According to the 2006 ''Mayor's Management Report,'' New York City's three public library systems had a total library circulation of 35 million: the NYPL and BPL (with 143 branches combined) had a circulation of {{Nowrap|15 million}}, and the Queens system had a circulation of {{Nowrap|20 million}} through its 62 branch libraries. Altogether the three library systems hosted {{Nowrap|37 million}} visitors in 2006.

Other libraries in New York City, some of which can be used by the public, are listed in the Directory of Special Libraries and Information Centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The New York Public Library |url=http://www.nypl.org/collections/articles-databases/directory-special-libraries-and-information-centers |title=Directory of Special Libraries and Information Centers &amp;#124; The New York Public Library |publisher=Nypl.org |date=2012-11-13 |accessdate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017 Subway Library was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nypl.org/blog/2017/06/08/subwaylibrary|title=Announcing #SubwayLibrary: Free E-Books for Your Commute|website=The New York Public Library|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an initiative between The New York Public Library, Brooklyn Public Library, and Queens Library, the MTA, and Transit Wireless. The Subway Library gave riders access to  e-books, excerpts, and short stories. Subway Library has since ended, but riders can still download free e-books via the [https://www.nypl.org/books-music-movies/ebookcentral/simplye SimplyE app] or by visiting [https://simplye.net/ SimplyE.net].

The '''Patagonian toothfish''', '''''Dissostichus eleginoides''''', is a [[species]] of [[cod icefish]] found in cold waters ({{convert|1|-|4|C|F|disp=or}}) between depths of {{convert|45|and|3850|m|ft|abbr=on|round=5}} in the southern [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], and [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] Oceans and [[Southern Ocean]] on [[seamount]]s and [[Continental shelf|continental shelves]] around most [[sub-Antarctic]] islands.

A close relative, the [[Antarctic toothfish]], (&lt;span lang="la-Latn" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Dissostichus mawsoni&lt;/span&gt;) is found farther south around the edges of the [[Antarctic]] shelf; and a [[Marine Stewardship Council]]-certified fishery is active in the [[Ross Sea]].

The average weight of a commercially caught Patagonian toothfish is {{convert|7|-|10|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, depending on the fishery, with large adults occasionally exceeding {{convert|100|kg|lb}}. They are thought to live up to 50 years&lt;ref name="Brickle et al. 2010"/&gt; and to reach a length up to {{convert|2.3|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}. Several commercial fisheries exist for Patagonian toothfish which are detailed below.

==Name==

This species is also sold under the [[trade name]]s '''Chilean seabass''' in the United States and Canada; '''{{lang|es|merluza negra}}''' in [[Argentina]], [[Peru]] and [[Uruguay]]; '''legine australe''' in France; '''mero''' in Korea, Japan, and Spain, and '''bacalao de profundidad''' in [[Chile]].&lt;ref name ="FishBase"&gt;{{FishBase species|genus=Dissostichus|species=eleginoides|year=2015|month=October}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Chilean seabass" was invented by a fish wholesaler named Lee Lantz in 1977.  He was looking for a name that would make it attractive to the American market.  He considered "Pacific sea bass" and "South American sea bass" before settling on "Chilean sea bass".&lt;ref name="knecht"&gt;G. Bruce Knecht, ''Hooked: Pirates, Poaching, And the Perfect Fish", 2006. {{ISBN|1-59486-110-2}}. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) accepted "Chilean Seabass" as an "alternative market name" for Patagonian toothfish,&lt;ref name="knecht"/&gt; and in 2013 for Antarctic toothfish.

In the UK, the approved commercial designations for ''D. eleginoides'' and ''D. mawsoni'' are "icefish" and "toothfish".&lt;ref&gt;"The Fish Labelling (England) Regulations 2010", [[Statutory Instrument]] 2010 No. 420, 23 February 2010, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/420/pdfs/uksi_20100420_en.pdf PDF], came into force 6 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  This has created some confusion as there is a genuine "[[Mackerel icefish|icefish]]" (''Champsocephalus gunnari'') caught in [[subantarctic]] waters, which does not resemble toothfish in any way.

==Ecology==

Patagonian toothfish spawn in deep water (around 1,000m) during the austral winter, producing [[pelagic]] eggs and larvae. Larvae switch to a [[demersal]] habitat at around 100m (1 year old) and inhabit relatively shallow water (&lt;300m) until 6–7 years of age, when they begin a gradual migration into deeper water.  As juveniles in shallow water, toothfish are primarily piscivorous, consuming the most abundant suitably sized local prey.  With increasing size and habitat depth, the diet diversifies and includes more scavenging of squid, fish, and crustaceans.&lt;ref name="Brickle et al. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins |first=M.A. |author2=Brickle, P. |author3=Brown, J. |author4= Belchier, M. |title=The Patagonian toothfish: Biology, ecology and fishery|journal=Advances in Marine Biology |year=2010 |volume=58 |pages=227–300 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwF-jNVj41gC&amp;pg=PA227 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-381015-1.00004-6 |isbn=9780123810151}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, toothfish constitute a small part of the diets of [[sperm whale]]s, [[southern elephant seal]]s, and [[colossal squid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yukhov|first=V.L.|title=The range of fish of the genus ''Dissostichus'' (Fam. Nototheniidae) in the Antarctic waters of the Indian Ocean|journal=Journal of Ichthyology |year=1972|volume=12|issue=2|pages=346–347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosa|first=R.|author2=Seibel, B.A.|title=Slow pace of life of the Antarctic colossal squid|journal=Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom|year=2010|volume=90|pages=1375–1378|doi=10.1017/S0025315409991494|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van den Hoff|first=J.|title=A comparative study of the cephalopod prey of Patagonian toothfish (''Dissostichus eleginoides'') and southern elephant seals (''Mirounga leonina'') near Macquarie Island|journal=Journal of Polar Biology|year=2004|volume=27|issue=10|pages=604–612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As most toothfish fisheries are managed in accordance with CCAMLR regulations and conservation measures, it should be noted that CCAMLR adopts an “ecosystem approach” which requires that all other living resources of the Southern Ocean are treated as an integrated system where effects on predator, prey and related species are considered, and decisions on sustainable harvesting levels are made on the basis of sound, internationally peer reviewed scientific advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Constable|first=A.J.|chapter=The Status of Antarctic Fisheries Research |title=The Antarctic: Past, Present and Future. Antarctic CRC Research Report|year=2002|volume=28|pages=71–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Commercial fishing of toothfish is managed by the [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources|Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR)]] inside the CCAMLR Convention Area which spans the Antarctic continent and waters between 45°S and 60°S. Some fisheries inside territorial waters within the Convention Area (e.g. Crozet Island, Prince Edwards and Marion Islands) are managed separately by countries with territorial waters taking CCAMLR management practices into account.  Toothfish fisheries outside the CCAMLR Convention Area in the coastal waters of Argentina, Chile and Uruguay are managed by the relevant coastal state.  However, these fisheries are still subject to the CCAMLR Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS) which tracks the trade of toothfish from the point of unloading to the point of final consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About CCAMLR|url=http://www.ccamlr.org/en/organisation/about-ccamlr|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the legal toothfish fisheries managed by CCAMLR and countries with territorial waters, the most common method is fishing by longlines (where a long "mainline" is set in the water, with many baited hooks coming off that line). A small quantity of toothfish is caught by trawling (where a net is towed behind the boat for short periods of time). For all methods of legal fishing for toothfish, there are minimal interactions with, and risks to, seabirds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CCAMLR XXX Scientific Committee Report|url=http://www.ccamlr.org/en/SC-CAMLR-XXX|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a result of requirements for legal operators to use mitigation devices or approaches such as:
* Seasonal fishery closures during the summer months due to increase in seabird abundance for chick rearing;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CCAMLR CM 41-02 to 41-11|url=http://www.ccamlr.org/en/conservation-and-management/browse-conservation-measures|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* No setting of hooks during the daytime;&lt;ref name="CCAMLR CM 25-02"&gt;{{cite web|title=CCAMLR CM 25-02|url=http://www.ccamlr.org/sites/drupal.ccamlr.org/files//25-02.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* No fishing without having a bird-scaring line trailing out the back of the boat to keep birds away from the hooks;&lt;ref name="CCAMLR CM 25-02"/&gt;
* Bird Exclusion Devices (BED) or "Brickle curtain" to be used on 100% of hauls;&lt;ref name="CCAMLR CM 25-02"/&gt;
* Boats must use weighted longlines so that the baits and hooks sink before the birds can grab them;&lt;ref name="CCAMLR CM 25-02"/&gt;
* Limitations on release of offal overboard at the same time as the setting or hauling of lines (to avoid attracting seabirds when they may otherwise be vulnerable to the baits and hooks).&lt;ref name="CCAMLR CM 25-02"/&gt;

In 2011 the CCAMLR Scientific Committee Chair, David Agnew, was quoted as saying “levels of seabird mortality are negligible in most areas”, with the one region yet to achieve these "near zero" results, having reduced seabird interactions by over 98% from their peak levels, and have continued to improve each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CCAMLR XXX Commission Report|url=http://www.ccamlr.org/en/CCAMLR-XXX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trawling generally catches toothfish in the smaller size range, which requires calculations to be made at the annual stock assessment meetings of CCAMLR to take these catches of smaller sized fish into account, and lowers the overall available catch of toothfish by trawl.  CCAMLR has prohibited all trawl fishing in high seas waters and exploratory fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CCAMLR CM 22-05|url=http://www.ccamlr.org/sites/drupal.ccamlr.org/files//22-05.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compliance==
To minimise the risk of long-term adverse effects on target species, by-catch species and marine ecosystems, CCAMLR uses a number of compliance systems to monitor fishing activities in the Convention Area.  This includes:
* Vessel licensing;&lt;ref name="CCAMLR CM 10-02"&gt;{{cite web|title=CCAMLR CM 10-02|url=http://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-10-02-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Monitoring of transhipments;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CCAMLR CM 10-09|url=http://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-10-09-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vessel and Port inspection systems;&lt;ref name="CCAMLR CM 10-02"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CCAMLR CM 10-03|url=http://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-10-03-2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Automated satellite-linked Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CCAMLR CM 10-04|url=http://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-10-04-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Catch Document Scheme:

The Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS) for Patagonian toothfish (''Dissostichus eleginoides'') and Antarctic toothfish (''Dissostichus mawsoni'') was one measure that ensured reductions in illegal fishing for toothfish and reduced the scope for trade in illegally caught fish.  The CDS is an innovative online catch document information system (DCD: Dissostichus Catch Document) developed to identify legal toothfish harvested, which tracks toothfish from the point of landing throughout the trade cycle to point of sale.  The CDS requires verification and authorisation by national authorities at regular intervals in the trade cycle.  Identification of the origin of toothfish entering the ports and markets of CDS Parties is essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CCAMLR CM 10-05|url=http://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-10-05-2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Best Practice Study of Fish Catch Documentation Schemes|year=2010|publisher=MRAG Asia Pacific|url=http://www.m2cms.com.au/uploaded/5/Final%20CDS%20Report%20-August%2023.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal fishing==
The Coalition of Legal Toothfish Operators, Inc. (COLTO) is a toothfish fishing industry body whose members represent around 85% of the legal toothfish catch worldwide.  Seven of the fisheries that are fished by COLTO members are now independently certified by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marine Stewardship Council Toothfish|url=http://www.msc.org/search?SearchableText=toothfish|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as sustainable and well managed fisheries.  Commercial fishing of Patagonian and Antarctic toothfish is managed by CCAMLR around most of the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic regions, however a fishery that lies within a nation’s [[Exclusive Economic Zone|Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)]] is managed by that nation, taking into account management recommendations and approaches by CCAMLR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=COLTO Fisheries|url=http://www.colto.org/fisheries|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the South Georgia toothfish fishery (CCAMLR Statistical Division 48.3) was the first toothfish fishery to be MSC certified, and was recertified in 2009 and 2014, as all MSC certified fisheries must be audited annually, and fully reassessed every five years.  Currently, the South Georgia [[Common Fisheries Policy#Total allowable catch .28TAC.29|Total Allowable Catch (TAC)]] is 2,400t, and there are 6 longline vessels being operated by 4 companies in this fishery, which is managed by the UK overseas territory of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Georgia MSC|url=http://www.msc.org/track-a-fishery/certified/south-atlantic-indian-ocean/south-georgia-patagonian-toothfish-longline|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Georgia COLTO|url=http://www.colto.org/fisheries/south-georgia/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ross Sea fishery (CCAMLR Statistical Division 88.1 and 88.2) was the second toothfish fishery to be independently evaluated and certified by the MSC as sustainable and well managed (in 2010, and re-certified in 2015).  This fishery catches mainly Antarctic toothfish, a close relative to the Patagonian toothfish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ross Sea MSC|url=http://www.msc.org/track-a-fishery/certified/southern-ocean/ross-sea-toothfish-longline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ross Sea COLTO|url=http://www.colto.org/fisheries/ross-sea/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands]] fishery (CCAMLR Statistical Division 58.5.2) was certified as a sustainable and well managed fishery by the MSC in March 2012 (and re-certified in 2017) and is operated under Australian jurisdiction in a manner consistent with CCAMLR regulations.  There are 4 vessels operated by 2 Australian companies (Austral Fisheries and Australian Longline).   The CCAMLR determined TAC is 3,405t of toothfish for the 2016/17 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIMI MSC|url=http://www.msc.org/track-a-fishery/certified/southern-ocean/heard_island_and_mcdonald_islands_himi_toothfish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=COLTO HIMI|url=http://www.colto.org/fisheries/himi/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Macquarie Island]] toothfish fishery is within the Australian EEZ, and is situated outside the CCAMLR Convention Area within FAO Statistical Area 81, though it is managed in a complementary way with the conservation measures adopted by CCAMLR.  In May 2012, this was the fourth toothfish fishery to gain MSC certification (and re-certified in 2017). There are 2 Australian companies that are allocated to catch 450t of toothfish in 2017/18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Macquarie Island MSC|url=http://www.msc.org/track-a-fishery/certified/southern-ocean/macquarie_island_toothfish|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Macquarie Island COLTO|url=http://www.colto.org/fisheries/macquarie-island/|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France regulates Patagonian toothfish in the waters surrounding the French islands in the South Indian Ocean, with scientific oversight from the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|National Museum of Natural History]].  These fisheries are located around the [[Kerguelen Islands]] (CCAMLR Statistical Division 58.5.1) and the Crozet Islands (CCAMLR Statistical Division 58.6). Fishing authorizations have been granted to six fishing companies based out of [[Reunion Island]].  The TAC for the Kerguelen Island fishery is 5,050&amp;nbsp;t and was certified by the MSC in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=French Toothfish MSC|url=http://www.msc.org/newsroom/news/french-toothfish-fishers-get-msc-certification}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current TAC for the Crozet Islands fishery is 1,300&amp;nbsp;t, and was certified by the MSC in 2017.

The [[Falkland Islands]], a self-governing [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]], also has a toothfish fishery and was awarded MSC certification in 2014. The Falklands do not fall in the CCAMLR Convention area, though regulations on fishing methods, science and management mirror CCAMLR requirements.  The TAC is currently 1,040&amp;nbsp;t and is caught by a sole longline vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Falkland Islands MSC|url=http://www.msc.org/track-a-fishery/in-assessment/south-atlantic/falkland_island_toothfish/falkland_island_toothfish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Falkland Islands COLTO|url=http://www.colto.org/fisheries/falkland-islands/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combined, over 50% of all legally harvested toothfish is independently assessed and certified by the MSC as being from sustainable and well managed fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CCAMLR XXX Commission Report|url=http://www.ccamlr.org/en/CCAMLR-XXX|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSC Toothfish"&gt;{{cite web|title=MSC Toothfish|url=http://www.msc.org/search?SearchableText=toothfish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chilean toothfish fishery is separated into two separate fleets.  The "artisanal fleet" of small boats operates in the region north of 47°S inside the Chilean EEZ; and 8 vessels from the "industrial fleet" operate south of 47°S inside the Chilean EEZ as well as on the high seas both within and outside CCAMLR waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gonzalez|first=E.P.|title=Changes in Fleet Capacity and Ownership of Harvesting Rights in the Fishery for Patagonian Toothfish in Chile. Case studies on the effects of transferable fishing rights on fleet capacity and concentration of quota ownership|journal=FAO Fisheries Technical Paper|year=2001|volume=412|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TAC for the industrial fleet is determined each year by the [[Politics of Chile|Chilean government]] based on biological studies carried out by both public and private scientific bodies.  The current Chilean TAC for the industrial fleet is 1,656t that is caught by 3 companies.  Since 2006, artisanal fleet catches have fluctuated between 2,091t and 1,558t per annum,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SernaPesca Annual Reports|url=http://www.sernapesca.cl/index.php?option=com_remository&amp;Itemid=54&amp;func=select&amp;id=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chile COLTO|url=http://www.colto.org/fisheries/chilean-eez/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its current{{When|date=December 2017}} quota is 1,491&amp;nbsp;t.

Argentina has a toothfish fishery off its coastline that is managed by the Argentine Federal Fisheries Council under recommendations from the National Fisheries Research Institute. This season{{When|date=December 2017}} the Argentine TAC is 3,700&amp;nbsp;t that is caught by five vessels from four companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Argentine COLTO|url=http://www.colto.org/fisheries/argentine-eez-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Prince Edward Islands|Prince Edward and Marion Islands]] toothfish fishery is managed and regulated by Branch Fisheries, part of the [[Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (South Africa)|South African Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries]].  The South African Marine Resource Authorities fully supports and follows all CCAMLR Conservation Measures.  The current{{When|date=December 2017}} TAC is 575t and is fished by two vessels belonging to two fishing companies/cooperatives, with catches having been restricted significantly following excessive illegal, unreported and unregulated ([[Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing|IUU]]) fishing in those waters in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brandão |first=A. |last2=Butterworth |first2=D.S. |year=2009|title=A proposed management procedure for the toothfish (''Dissostichus eleginoides'') resource in the Prince Edward Islands vicinity |journal=CCAMLR Science |volume=16 |pages=33–69 |url=https://www.ccamlr.org/en/publications/science_journal/ccamlr-science-volume-16/ccamlr-science-volume-1633-69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince Edward COLTO|url=http://www.colto.org/fisheries/prince-edward-marion-islands/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TACs from this fishery have slowly started to increase as the stock begins to recover.

The total allowable catch of toothfish worldwide is around 28,300&amp;nbsp;tonnes in 2017, with around 85% of this coming from COLTO members, and 56% of the total catch (15,900 tonnes) now being independently certified as coming from sustainable and well managed fisheries by the Marine Stewardship Council.&lt;ref name="MSC Toothfish"/&gt;

==Illegal fishing==
In the late 1990s to early 2000s, [[illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing]] (IUU) for toothfish nearly collapsed some fisheries in the Southern Ocean.  Though, since 2005, because of CCAMLR Member nations, government patrol vessels, NGOs, media exposure and a trade and port state measures, IUU fishing has been all but eliminated from within countries' exclusive economic zones, and until 2015 a relatively small portion of IUU fishing still occurred in high seas areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CCAMLR FSA report|url=http://www.ccamlr.org/en/wg-fsa-10/06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014 and 2015 there were several major campaigns to eliminate IUU fishing for toothfish.  This included the Sea Shepherd campaign, ""Operation Icefish", which pursued one of the vessels, the [[Thunder (ship)|''Thunder'']], for 110 days before it was scuttled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Renegade Trawler, Hunted by 10,000 miles by Vigilantes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/28/world/a-renegade-trawler-hunted-for-10000-miles-by-vigilantes.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Operations by the Royal New Zealand Navy, the Royal Australian Navy, Interpol, and governments of Spain, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia all combined to successfully apprehend, arrest and prosecute all of the remaining 6 IUU vessels fishing illegally for toothfish on the high seas.

At the peak of IUU fishing, illegal catches were estimated to be 32,000 tonnes in 1997 with approximately 55 vessels believed to be active.  By 2010, IUU catches had fallen to an estimated 1,615 tonnes, all taken in high seas areas, with just four IUU fishing vessels reported to be active. This was a decrease in IUU fishing by over 95% since the mid 1990s.  CCAMLR estimated in 2012 that 90% of IUU catches at the time were of Antarctic toothfish, not Patagonian toothfish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SC-CCAMLR-XXIX, Annex 8, Table 6|url=http://www.ccamlr.org/en/SC-CAMLR-XXIX|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CCAMLR annually reviews information on IUU fishing activities in the Convention Area and has established a Contracting Party and a Non-Contracting Party IUU Vessel List&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CCAMLR Non-contracting party IUU Vessel List|url=http://www.ccamlr.org/en/compliance/non-contracting-party-iuu-vessel-list}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (CCAMLR Conservation Measure 10-06 and Conservation Measure 10-07).  Vessels included on the IUU Vessel Lists have engaged in IUU activities in the Convention Area and undermined the effectiveness of conservation measures, thereby threatening toothfish stocks, marine habitats and by-catch species.  Vessels are included on the IUU Vessel Lists after a consensus decision from the Commission based on set criteria.  This measure, combined with additional surveillance by member nations, catch documentation schemes has played a significant part in the reduction of IUU fishing for toothfish.

In the past, France sold some fishing rights to Japanese and other foreign fisheries, but because of IUU fishing, rights are now reserved for French fishers based at [[Réunion Island]].  Because of previous poaching, the [[French Navy]] and Australian Customs vessels still work in concert, patrolling both French and Australian EEZs, having made numerous arrests and seizures in the late 1990s to early 2000s.  An [[Australian Customs]] vessel, the ''Southern Supporter'', was involved in the renowned chase and apprehension of an IUU vessel in the 2003 [[Viarsa 1|''Viarsa'' incident]] that stretched over 7,200 kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/22/1061529336367.html |title=Chase around the world for white gold |work=National News |publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=2003-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TACs for legal operators in CCAMLR are set, taking into account the estimated IUU catches from past years, and any current IUU activity that may be occurring in the different fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CCAMLR FSA Report 2011|url=http://www.ccamlr.org/en/WG-FSA-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some fisheries this has meant a considerable reduction in legal catches – an example of this is the Australian Heard Island and McDonald Islands fishery, where the legal TAC was 3,800t in 1996/97.  This was dropped to a minimum of 2,427t by 2006/07 with a substantial portion of that decline attributed to the IUU catches taken from the fishery between 1996 and 2002.  Since then there has been zero IUU fishing in that fishery, and the legal TAC has steadily increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CCAMLR 58.5.2 Fishery Report|url=http://www.ccamlr.org/en/fisheries/toothfish-fisheries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Catch Documentation System mentioned above, USA regulations do not allow toothfish imports without valid Dissostichus Catch Documents; and dealer permit and pre-approval certificates issued in advance by NOAA. In addition, toothfish must be caught from vessels equipped with satellite-linked automated VMS that track vessel movements from port-to-port to ensure compliance with set quotas and boundaries. All vessel VMS data must be reported to the centralized CCAMLR system, with confirmation to USA required that it has occurred, in order for any products from those boats to be imported into the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USA Federal Register|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2003/05/01/03-10679/antarctic-marine-living-resources-ccamlr-ecosystem-monitoring-permits-vessel-monitoring-system-catch|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As revealed by the "[[Black spider memos]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince of Wales correspondence with government departments|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/prince-of-wales-correspondence-with-government-departments|website=Cabinet Office, London|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], was worried about the future for the species.  An [[open reply]] noted that sea birds had indeed been protected in toothfish fisheries globally, and that IUU fishing was virtually eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Letter to HRH, the Prince of Wales|url=http://www.colto.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/COLTO-open-letter-to-HRH.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU has also imposed requirements against IUU fishing that include:
* Only marine fisheries products validated as legal by the relevant flag state or exporting state can be imported to or exported from the EU.
* A European black list having been drawn up covering both IUU vessels and states that turn a blind eye to illegal fishing activities.
* EU operators who fish illegally anywhere in the world, under any flag, face substantial penalties proportionate to the economic value of their catch, which deprive them of any profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU IUU Policy|url=http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/illegal_fishing/index_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Seafood chooser organizations ==
Patagonian Toothfish is currently listed by the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]] on its [[Seafood Watch]] list and pocket guides.   In April 2013, Seafood Watch produced an updated report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chilean Seabass Seafood Watch Report |url=http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/SeafoodWatch/web/sfw_factsheet.aspx?gid=11 |work=Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch |accessdate=19 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412183508/http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/SeafoodWatch/web/sfw_factsheet.aspx?gid=11 |archivedate=12 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating new ratings for some fisheries, which allocates approximately 78% of toothfish caught worldwide, which are as follows:
* Best Choice – Heard Island and McDonald Islands Fishery (Australia), Macquarie Island Fishery (Australia), Falkland Islands Fishery
* Good Alternative – South Georgia Fishery, Kerguelen Islands Fishery (France), Ross Sea Antarctic toothfish Fishery
* Avoid – Prince Edward &amp; Marion Island Fishery (South Africa), Chile, Crozet Islands Fishery (France)
* Not Rated – Argentina

In 2010, [[Greenpeace|Greenpeace International]] added the Patagonian toothfish to its seafood red list. "The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/oceans/seafood/red-list-of-species/ Greenpeace International Seafood Red list]&lt;/ref&gt;  Greenpeace have not updated their rating of toothfish since the 2013 Monterey Bay Aquarium review.

'''Quebracho''' (named after a type of wood known for its hardness) is a [[far-left]] {{cn|date=April 2014}} group in [[Argentina]] that self-proclaims itself as [[bolivarian]]. Its official name is ''Movimiento Patriótico Revolucionario Quebracho'' ('''Revolutionary Patriotic Movement ''Quebracho'''''). According to their own publications, Quebracho define themselves as "a political organization that fights for the national and social liberation of our country.  For a just peace, economic independence, and political sovereignty.  For the National Anti-Imperialist Revolution." {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Quebracho promotes the abolition of [[private property]] and the reduction of poverty. Its aggressive and confrontational tactics have brought it into conflict with some other leftist organizations, and it is not included in any political coalition on the left side of the spectrum.

[[Fernando Esteche]], who also teaches at the Faculty of Journalism in La Universidad de La Plata, is the top public leader of Quebracho. He was prosecuted and jailed on charges stemming from political violence during a march on April 5, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2007/04/21/elpais/p-01601.htm  Esteche, el líder de Quebracho, fue procesado y sigue detenido] Clarin&lt;/ref&gt; but was freed in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2007/10/02/um/m-01511489.htm Tras 43 días de huelga de hambre, quedan en libertad los líderes de Quebracho] Clarin&lt;/ref&gt;

In unrelated charges, Esteche and fellow Quebracho leader "Boli" were sentenced to more than three years for "political intimidation" in the murder of an Argentine governor. The sentence was affirmed on appeal by the Argentine Supreme Court and was scheduled to begin by December 3, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quebracho.org.ar/inicio/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D848%3Amartes-3-de-diciembre-dictaran-orden-de-detencion-para-esteche-y-lescano-de-quebracho%26catid%3D63%3Anoticias |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020127/http://www.quebracho.org.ar/inicio/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=848:martes-3-de-diciembre-dictaran-orden-de-detencion-para-esteche-y-lescano-de-quebracho&amp;catid=63:noticias |archivedate=December 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006 incidents==

On August 30, Quebracho participated in a demonstration supporting [[Hezbollah]] and against the [[State of Israel]] in the context of the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]] in front of the [[Israel]]i embassy in [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name=INCIDENTS/&gt; After meeting with the [[Anibal Fernandez|Argentinian Interior Minister]], [[DAIA]] and [[Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina|AMIA]] leaders filed a lawsuit against Quebracho on September 1 at the Federal Court, accusing it of incitement and disturbing public order.&lt;ref name=INCIDENTS&gt;[http://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?intarticleid=17026&amp;intcategoryid=2 Argentine Jews see upsurge in anti-Israel incidents since war] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927014944/http://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?intarticleid=17026&amp;intcategoryid=2 |date=September 27, 2006 }} JTA News&lt;/ref&gt; Kirszenbaum and Luis Grynwald, AMIA’s president, told the court that Quebracho "gives us enormous preoccupation and sadness as Argentines," not just as Jewish leaders.&lt;ref name=INCIDENTS/&gt; AMIA board member Edgardo Gorenberg described Quebracho as "a threat to democracy," saying it "recalls the darkest" parts of Argentine history.&lt;ref name=INCIDENTS/&gt;

The '''Royal Purple Yearbook''' is the official yearbook of [[Kansas State University]].  The Royal Purple has won many awards, including several [[National Pacemaker Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studentpress.org/acp/winners/cdpm99.html ACP - Contest Winners&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Columbia Scholastic Press Association gave the 2006 Royal Purple a Silver Crown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cspa.columbia.edu/docs/contests-and-critiques/crown-awards/recipients/2007-collegiate-crown.html#N100D0 Columbia Scholastic Press Association : CSPA presents 18 Gold, 24 Silver Crowns at 2007 Student Awards Convocation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Royal Purple is the only official yearly record of Kansas State University.  In 1997 the yearbook came with a CD-ROM supplement and in 2003 the CD-ROM changed to a DVD.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.royalpurpleyearbook.com/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Purple has a rich history since its predecessor first appeared at Kansas State Agricultural College in 1891.  The yearbook underwent several name changes, including The Sledge, Sunrise, The Bell Clapper and The Banner, until it became the Royal Purple in 1909.

The Royal Purple has consistently been a trend-setting yearbook.  It was the first yearbook with an opening section that told the highlights of the year in chronological order, "tilted" pictures, numerous "bleed" pages, new headlines, and a "tip-on"—an applied color picture to the cover first used on the 1938 Royal Purple.  An embossed design on the division page, a trend of the 1980s, first was used on the 1939 Royal Purple. The 1941 Royal Purple staff produced the first full-color lithograph cover in the nation. The 1994 Royal Purple used the very first UV lamination, a technique that has since become very popular.  In 1997 the Royal Purple added a CD-Rom to its coverage and changed with the technology and in 2003 changed from CD-Roms to a DVD supplement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

'''''Schwechater''''' {{IPA-de|ˈʃvɛçaːtɐ|}} is a 1958 [[experimental film|experimental]] short film by Austrian filmmaker [[Peter Kubelka]]. It is the second entry in his trilogy of metrical films, between ''Adebar'' and ''[[Arnulf Rainer (film)|Arnulf Rainer]]''.

Originally commissioned to make an advertisement for {{ill|Schwechater Bier|de}}, Kubelka edited footage from the shoot based on a complex set of rules, producing a rapid procession of images. Although the company was displeased with the commercial, ''Schwechater'' found favour as a work of avant-garde cinema.

==Description==
''Schwechater'' contains 1,440 [[film frame|frame]]s, making it exactly one minute long when projected at the standard rate of 24 [[frames per second]]. The film has no narrative, and it cuts between images quickly enough that they form flickering patterns.&lt;ref name="sitney-visionary-film"&gt;Sitney 1974, pp. 286–287.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four different moving images appear throughout the film. One shows a woman sitting at a table as beer is poured into her glass, and another shows her drinking the beer. There is also footage of a [[champagne glass]] filled with beer as well as a group of people in a restaurant.&lt;ref name="sitney-visionary-film"/&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Peter Kubelka und Gerhard Rühm, 2014 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Director [[Peter Kubelka]] in 2014]]
===Photography===
The Schwechater Bier brewery commissioned Kubelka to make an advertisement for its beer.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 2008, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Kubelka shot using an old, hand-operated [[35 mm]] scientific camera. The camera had no viewfinder, and Kubelka largely ignored the [[composition (visual arts)|composition]] of the images. Once the film stock was used up, Kubelka humored the [[art director]] for Schwechater Bier and cranked the empty camera, pretending to continue filming.&lt;ref name="bodien-film-quarterly"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bodien |first=Earl |year= 1966 |title=The Films of Peter Kubelka |journal=[[Film Quarterly]] |volume=20 |issue=2 |page=55 |doi=10.2307/1210702 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacDonald |first=Scott |year=2004 |title=His African Journey: An Interview with Peter Kubelka |journal=[[Film Quarterly]] |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=5–7 |doi=10.1525/fq.2004.57.3.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Editing===
[[File:Schwechater film.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.5|A sequence of red frames from the film]]
Kubelka used four shots spanning 16, 30, 90, and 1,440 frames as the material for ''Schwechater''. He produced high-contrast positive and [[negative (photography)|negative]] prints, copied so that each shot looped for exactly 1,440 frames.&lt;ref name=p6869&gt;Tscherkassky 2012, pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; After getting the developed film from the laboratory, Kubelka let it sit for six weeks until executives from Schwechater Bier began asking about the commercial.&lt;ref name="bodien-film-quarterly"/&gt;

The editing process for ''Schwechater'' lasted six months.&lt;ref name="bodien-film-quarterly"/&gt; Kubelka produced a score for the film with a complex system of overlapping structures to determine how to combine the eight film strips. One such structure specifies outlines the gradual permeation of the colour red in ''Schwechater''. The film starts alternates between black-and-white sequences and red sequences; the black and white sequences decrease in duration from 110 frames down to 10 frames as the red sequences remain are all roughly 30 frames. As such, the film becomes increasingly red over the course of its runtime.&lt;ref&gt;Tscherkassky 2012, pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another structure specifies which frames do and do not contain images. Each sequence of frames with images is immediately followed by a sequence of the same length containing frames showing a solid color—either black or red. The frame count of these sequences traverses the [[powers of two]], from 1 up to 32 and back down.&lt;ref name=p6869/&gt;

===Soundtrack===
For the film's soundtrack, Kubelka created a score of rasping sounds and beeps. The intermittent periods of sound happen parallel to the red-tinted sequences, with a low hum and one to three [[sine tone]]s. When the Schwechater logo appears at the end of the film, Kubelka used a sustained, high-pitched sine tone.&lt;ref name="bodien-film-quarterly"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tscherkassky 2012, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
After Kubelka delivered the finished version to Schwechater, they stopped payment to him, ended their relation with him, and destroyed the company's print of the film.&lt;ref name="bodien-film-quarterly"/&gt; Initial reaction to ''Schwechater'' was very negative. The company sued Kubelka, and the film lab, which had Schwechater as a client, stopped making prints for him. His decision to leave Austria was in part because of the response to ''Schwechater''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Grissemann |first=Stefan |date=September 2012 |title=Frame by Frame |url=https://www.filmcomment.com/article/peter-kubelka-frame-by-frame-antiphon-adebar-arnulf-rainer/ |magazine=[[Film Comment]] |volume=48 |issue=5 |page=74 |access-date=8 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/features/2013/04/04/monument-film-interview-with-peter-kubelka/ |title=Monument Film: Interview with Peter Kubelka |last= Jahn |first=Pamela |date=4 April 2013 |website=Electric Sheep Magazine |access-date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film found success on the European film festival circuit. After several years, Schwechater Bier requested another print of it.&lt;ref name="bodien-film-quarterly"/&gt; ''Schwechater'' is now part of [[Anthology Film Archives]]' Essential Cinema Repertory collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/about/essential-cinema |title=Essential Cinema |publisher=[[Anthology Film Archives]] |access-date=October 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{segregation}}
'''Separate but equal''' was a legal doctrine in [[United States constitutional law]] according to which [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] did not violate the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which guaranteed "equal protection" under the law to all people. Under the doctrine, as long as the facilities provided to each race were equal, state and local governments could require that services, facilities, [[public accommodations]], housing, medical care, education, employment, and transportation be segregated by [[race in the United States|race]], which was already the case throughout the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. The phrase was derived from a Louisiana law of 1890, although the law actually used the phrase "equal but separate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/separate-but-equal|title=Answers - The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|website=Answers.com|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2018}}

The doctrine was confirmed in the ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' Supreme Court decision of 1896, which allowed state-sponsored segregation. Though segregation laws existed before that case, the decision emboldened segregation states during the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] era, which had commenced in 1876 and supplanted the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]], which restricted the [[civil rights]] and [[civil liberties]] of African-Americans during the [[Reconstruction Era]]. 

In practice the separate facilities provided to African Americans were rarely equal; usually they were not even close to equal, or they did not exist at all. For example, according to the 1934–36 report of the Florida Superintendent of Public Instruction, the value of "white school property" in the state was $70,543,000, while the value of African-American school property was $4,900,000. The report says that "in a few south Florida counties and in most north Florida counties many Negro schools are housed in churches, shacks, and lodges, and have no toilets, water supply, desks, blackboards, etc. [See [[Station One School]].] Counties use these schools as a means to get State funds and yet these counties invest little or nothing in them." High school education for African Americans was provided in only 28 of Florida's 67 counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The doctrine of separate but equal was overturned by a series of [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decisions, starting with ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' of 1954. However, the overturning of segregation laws in the United States was a long process that lasted through much of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, involving federal legislation (especially the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]), and many court cases.

==Origins==
The [[American Civil War]] brought [[History of slavery in the United States|slavery in the United States]] to an end, with the ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://railroads.unl.edu/blog/?p=31 | title =How Slavery Ended in the Civil War | author =Williams G. Thomas | publisher =''[[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]]'' | date =June 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the war, the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the United States Constitution guaranteed equal protection under the law to all people, and Congress established the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] to assist the integration of former slaves into Southern society. After the end of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] with the [[Compromise of 1877]], and the withdrawal of federal troops from all Southern states, former slave-holding states enacted various laws to undermine the equal treatment of African Americans, although the Fourteenth Amendment as well as federal Civil Rights laws enacted during reconstruction were meant to guarantee it. However, Southern states contended that the requirement of equality could be met in a way that kept the races separate. Furthermore, the state and federal courts tended to reject the pleas by African Americans that their Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated, arguing that the Fourteenth Amendment applied only to federal, not state, citizenship. This rejection is evident in the [[Slaughter-House Cases]] and [[Civil Rights Cases]].

After the end of Reconstruction, the federal government adopted a general policy of leaving racial segregation up to the individual states. One example of this policy was the second Morrill Act ([[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act#Expansion|Morrill Act of 1890]]). Before the end of the war, the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]] (Morrill Act of 1862) had provided federal funding for higher education by each state with the details left to the state legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage | title =A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875 | author =''[[Library of Congress]]'' | publisher =loc.gov | date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1890 Act implicitly accepted the legal concept of "separate but equal" for the 17 states that had institutionalized segregation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Provided, That no money shall be paid out under this act to any State or Territory for the support and maintenance of a college where a distinction of race or color is made in the admission of students, but the establishment and maintenance of such colleges ''separately'' for white and colored students shall be held to be a compliance with the provisions of this act if the funds received in such State or Territory be ''equitably'' divided as hereinafter set forth.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/agexed/aee501/1890law.html Act of August 30, 1890, ch. 841, 26 Stat. 417, 7 U.S.C. 322 et seq.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220100345/http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/agexed/aee501/1890law.html |date=February 20, 2009 }}" Act of 1890 Providing for the Further Endowment and Support Of Colleges of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://fdsys.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-104hr2730ih/pdf/BILLS-104hr2730ih.pdf 104th Congress 1st Session, H. R. 2730]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}" To eliminate segregationist monkey from the Second Morrill Act.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Prior to the Second Morrill Act, 17 states excluded blacks from access to the [[land grant colleges]] without providing similar educational opportunities. In response to the Second Morrill Act, 17 states established separate [[land grant colleges]] for blacks which are now referred to as public [[historically black colleges and universities]] (HBCUs). In fact, some states adopted laws prohibiting schools from educating blacks and whites together, even if a school was willing to do so. (The Constitutionality of such laws was upheld in ''[[Berea College v. Kentucky]]'', 211 U.S. 45 (1908).) Under the 'separate but equal doctrine', blacks were entitled to receive the same public services and accommodations such as schools, bathrooms, and water fountains, but states were allowed to maintain different facilities for the two groups. The legitimacy of such laws under the 14th Amendment was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1896 case of ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', ''163 U.S. 537.'' The ''Plessy'' doctrine was extended to the public schools in ''[[Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education]]'', 175 U.S. 528 (1899).

[[Image:WhiteTradeOnlyLancasterOhio.jpg|thumb|A restaurant in [[Lancaster, Ohio]], in 1938]]

Although the Constitutional doctrine required equality, the facilities and social services offered to African-Americans were almost always of lower quality than those offered to white Americans; for example, many African American schools received less public funding per student than nearby white schools. In Texas, the state established a state-funded law school for white students without any law school for black students.

In 1892, Homer Plessy, who was of mixed ancestry and appeared to be white, boarded an all-white railroad car between New Orleans and Covington, Louisiana. The conductor of the train collected passenger tickets at their seats. When Plessy told the conductor he was 7/8ths white and 1/8th black, he was advised he needed to move to a coloreds-only car. Plessy said he resented sitting in a coloreds-only car and was arrested immediately.

One month after his arrest, Plessy appeared in court before Judge John Howard Ferguson. Plessy's lawyer, Albion Tourgee, claimed Plessy’s 13th and 14th amendment rights were violated. The 13th amendment abolished slavery, and the 14th amendment granted equal protection to all under the law.

The Supreme Court decision in ''Plessy v. Ferguson'' established the phrase "separate but equal". The ruling required "railway companies carrying passengers in their coaches in that State to provide equal, but separate, accommodations for the white and colored races".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Plessy v. Ferguson |vol= |reporter= |opinion= |pinpoint= |court= |date= |url= |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rs|date=March 2018}} Accommodations provided on each railroad car were required to be the same as those provided on the others. Separate railroad cars could be provided. The railroad could refuse service to passengers who refused to comply, and the Supreme Court ruled this did not infringe upon the 13th and 14th amendments.

The "separate but equal" doctrine applied to railroad cars and to schools, voting rights, and drinking fountains. Segregated schools were created for students, as long as they followed "separate but equal". The majority of all black schools received old textbooks, used equipment, and poorly prepared or trained teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black-white student achievement gap persists|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=July 14, 2009|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/31911075/ns/us_news-education/t/black-white-student-achievement-gap-persists/#.UwfTu6VLrHM}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by the American Psychological Association found that black students were emotionally impaired when segregated at a young age.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Kenneth|title=Segregation Ruled Unequal, Therefore Unconstitutional}}&lt;/ref&gt; State voting right restrictions, such as [[literacy test]]s and [[poll taxes]], created an environment that made it almost impossible for blacks to vote. This era also saw separate drinking fountains in public areas.

The "Separate but Equal" doctrine was eventually overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' in 1954, although the implementation of the changes this implied was long, contentious, and sometimes violent. (See [[Massive resistance]] and [[Southern Manifesto]].) Modern legal doctrine interprets the 14th amendment to prohibit ''explicit'' segregation on the basis of race.

==Rejection==
{{Original research section|date=March 2014}}
The repeal of such restrictive laws, generally known as [[Jim Crow laws]], was a key focus of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1896–1954)|Civil Rights Movement prior to 1954]]. In ''[[Sweatt v. Painter]]'', the Supreme Court addressed a legal challenge to the doctrine by a student seeking admission to a state-supported law school in Texas. Because Texas did not have a [[Thurgood Marshall School of Law|law school for blacks]], the lower court delayed the case until Texas could create one. However, the Supreme Court ordered that the student be admitted to the white law school on the grounds that the separate school failed to qualify as being "equal", both because of quantitative differences in facilities and intangible factors, such as its isolation from most of the future lawyers with whom its graduates would interact. The court held that, when considering graduate education, intangibles must be considered as part of "substantive equality". The same day, the Supreme Court in ''[[McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents]]'' ruled that Oklahoma segregation laws which required a graduate student working on a Doctor of Education degree to sit in the hallway outside the classroom door did not qualify as "separate but equal". These cases ended "separate but equal" in graduate and professional education.

In ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', ''347 U.S. 483'' (1954), attorneys for the [[NAACP]] referred to the phrase "equal but separate" used in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' as a custom ''[[de jure]]'' [[racial segregation]] enacted into law. The NAACP, led by the soon-to-be first black Supreme Court Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]], was successful in challenging the [[Constitutionality|constitutional]] viability of the separate but equal doctrine, and the court voted to overturn sixty years of law that had developed under ''Plessy''. The Supreme Court outlawed segregated public education facilities for blacks and whites at the state level. The companion case of ''[[Bolling v. Sharpe]]'', ''347 U.S. 497'' outlawed such practices at the Federal level in the [[District of Columbia]]. The court held:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We conclude that, in the field of public education, the doctrine of "separate but equal" has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated for whom the actions have been brought are, by reason of the segregation complained of, deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although ''Brown'' overturned the doctrine of separate but equal with respect to institutions of public education, it would be almost ten more years before the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] would prohibit private discrimination in facilities, such as transportation and hotels, that were considered public accommodations. Additionally, in 1967 under ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'', the [[United States Supreme Court]] declared [[Virginia]]'s [[anti-miscegenation]] statute, the "[[Racial Integrity Act of 1924]]", unconstitutional, and invalidated all [[anti-miscegenation laws in the United States]]. Although federal legislation prohibits racial discrimination in college admissions, the [[HBCU|historically black colleges and universities]] continue to teach student bodies that are 75% to 90% African American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2004/2004062.pdf|title=Historically Black Colleges and Universities,1976 to 2001|work=Dept. of Education|date=September 2004|accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This however does not necessarily indicate racial discrimination within college admissions in those schools when factors such as student preference are taken into account.{{Citation needed|reason=Speculation/opinion|date=March 2014}} In 1975, Jake Ayers Sr. filed a lawsuit against [[Mississippi]], stating that they gave more financial support to the predominantly white public colleges. The state settled the lawsuit in 2002, directing $503 million to three historically black colleges over 17 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politics.gaeatimes.com/2009/11/19/opposition-strong-to-barbours-plan-to-merge-mississippis-3-black-universities-into-1-795/|title=Opposition strong to Barbour’s plan to merge Mississippi’s 3 black universities into 1|date=November 19, 2009|work=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== University of Michigan ==

[[Tim Howes]] of the [[University of Michigan]], [[Steve Kille]] of Isode Limited, [[Wengyik Yeong]] of [[Performance Systems International]] and [[Colin Robbins (software engineer)|Colin Robbins]] of [[Nexor]] authored the original [[LDAP]] specification.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 1777 - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RFC 1778 - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1993, initial implementations the LDAP standard  were made by Howes at the University of Michigan, in the form of LDAPD as a proxy for the [[ISO Development Environment#Quipu|Quipu]] [[X.500]] directory and SLAPD.

== Netscape Communications Corporation ==

In 1996 [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] hired several of the project's developers, who then worked on what became known as the Netscape Directory Server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Directory Services|url=http://idmdude.com/tag/tim-howes/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
The book's back cover touts that it contains the "never-before-told history of this innovative and influential musical genre".{{sfn|Burr|1999|p=260}} The book includes the musical biographies and discographies of 300 musicians in the Tejano, [[Norteño (music)|norteno]], conjunto, grupo, [[mariachi]], trio, [[tropical music|tropical]]/[[cumbia music|cumbia]], [[vallenato]], [[banda music|banda]], and regional Mexican music, and are listed alphabetically.{{sfn|Burr|1999|p=260}} The music guide also includes a [[glossary]] and Burr's "top 10" albums and singles of various regional Mexican music genres.{{sfn|Burr|1999|p=260}}

== Reception ==
The music guide was published in 1999, a period when Latin music entered the popular market and during the end of the 1990s Tejano music renaissance era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saldana|first1=Hector|title=Tejano music enjoyed a decade-long golden age|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Tejano-music-enjoyed-a-decade-long-golden-age-6447952.php|accessdate=24 March 2016|work=[[San Antonio Express-News]]|date=August 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, Tejano music became one of the fastest-growing musical genres in the United States and began to decline in popularity after the [[Murder of Selena|shooting death]] of American tejano singer [[Selena]] in March 1995.{{sfn|Burr|1999|p=15}}

'''Usulis''' ({{lang-ar|الاصولية}}) are the majority [[Twelver]] [[Shi'a]] [[Muslim]] group. They differ from their now much smaller rival [[Akhbari]] group in favoring the use of ''[[ijtihad]]'' (i.e., reasoning) in the creation of new rules of ''[[fiqh]]''; in assessing [[hadith]] to exclude traditions they believe unreliable; and in considering it obligatory to obey a ''[[mujtahid]]'' when seeking to determine Islamically correct behavior.

Since the crushing of the Akhbaris in the late 18th century, it has been the dominant school of Twelver Shi'a and now forms an overwhelming majority within the Twelver Shia [[Religious denomination|denomination]].

The name ''Usuli'' derives from the term ''[[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|Uṣūl al-fiqh]]'' (principles of jurisprudence).  In Usuli thought, there are four valid sources of law: the [[Quran]], [[hadith]], [[ijma']] and [['aql]]. Ijma' refers to a unanimous consensus. Aql, in Shia jurisprudence, is applied to four practical principles which are applied when other religious proofs are not applicable:&lt;ref name="ndn"&gt;{{Cite book

The term Usuli is also sometimes used to refer more generally to students of usul especially  among early Muslims, without regard to Shia Islam. Students/scholars of the ''principles'' of fiqh are distinguished from scholars of ''fiqh'' itself, whose scholars are known as ''faqīh'' (plural ''fuqahā''').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first1=John |last1=Burton | title=The Sources of Islamic Law: Islamic Theories of Abrogation | publisher=Edinburgh University Press | year=1990 | isbn=0-7486-0108-2 |url=http://www.almuslih.org/Library/Burton,%20J%20-%20The%20Sources%20of%20Islamic%20Law.pdf |accessdate=21 July 2018 |page=226 |ref=JBSILITA1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==

The Usuli believe that the [[Hadith]] collections contained traditions of varying degrees of reliability, and that critical analysis was necessary to assess their authority.  In contrast the Akhbari believe that the sole sources of law are the [[Qur'an]] and the Hadith, in particular [[the Four Books]] accepted by the Shia: everything in these sources is in principle reliable, and outside them there was no authority competent to enact or deduce further legal rules.

In addition to assessing the reliability of the Hadith, Usuli believe the task of the legal scholar is to establish intellectual principles of general application (''[[Usul al-fiqh]]''), from which particular rules may be derived by way of deduction. Accordingly, Usuli legal scholarship has the tools in principle for resolving new situations that are not already addressed in Quran or Hadith (see Ijtihad).

==Taqlid==
{{See also|Marja'}}

An important tenet of Usuli doctrine is [[Taqlid]] or "imitation", i.e. the acceptance of a religious ruling in matters of worship and personal affairs from someone regarded as a higher religious authority (e.g. an 'ālim) without necessarily asking for the technical proof.  These higher religious authorities can be known as a "source of imitation" (Arabic ''marja taqlid'' مرجع تقليد, Persian [[Marja'|marja]]) or less exaltedly as an "imitated one" (Arabic مقلَد ''muqallad''). However, his verdicts are not to be taken as the only source of religious information and he can be always corrected by other muqalladeen (the plural of muqallad) which come after him. Obeying a deceased taqlid is forbidden in Usuli.&lt;ref name="momen"&gt;{{Cite book

Taqlid has been introduced by scholars who felt that Quranic verses and traditions were not enough and that [[ulama]] were needed not only to interpret the Quran and [[Sunnah|Sunna]] but to make "new rulings to respond to new challenges and push the boundaries of Shia law in new directions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nasr |first=Vali |title=The Shia Revival: How Conflicts within Islam will shape the Future |location= |publisher=Norton |year=2006 |isbn=0-393-06211-2 |page=69 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
By their debates and books, [[Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid|Al-Mufid]], [[Sharif al-Murtaza|Sayyid-al Murtada]], and [[Shaykh Tusi|Shaykh al-Tusi]] in Iraq, were the first to introduce the ''[[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|Uṣūl al-fiqh]]'' (principles of Islamic jurisprudence) under the influence of the [[Shafi'i|Shafe'i]] and [[Mu`tazila|Mu'tazili]] doctrines. [[Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni|Al-Kulayni]], in [[Rey, Iran|Rey]], and [[Ibn Babawayh|al-Sadduq]], in [[Qom]], were concerned with a traditionalist approach. The second wave of the Usuli was shaped in the Mongol period when [[al-Hilli]] introduced the term ''[[mujtahid]]'', meaning an individual qualified to deduce ordinances on the basis of authentic religious arguments.  By developing the theory of the ''usul'', al-Hilli introduced more legal and logical norms which extended the meaning of the ''usul'' beyond the four principle sources. [[Muhammad Jamaluddin al-Makki al-Amili|Amili]] was the first scholar to fully formulate the principles of  ''[[ijtihad]]''. 

These traditional principles of [[Shi'a]] jurisprudence were challenged by the 17th-century [[Akhbari]] school, led by [[Muhammad Amin al-Astarabadi]]. A reaction against Akhbari arguments was led in the last half of the 18th century by [[Muhammad Baqir Behbahani]].&lt;ref name="ndn"/&gt;{{rp|284-285}} He attacked the Akhbari and their method was abandoned by Shia.&lt;ref name="ndn"/&gt;{{rp|230}} The dominance of the Usuli over the Akhbari came  when Behbahani led the Usuli to dominance and "completely routed the Akhbaris at [[Karbala]] and [[Najaf]]," so that "only a handful of Shi'i [[ulama]] have remained Akhbari to the present day."&lt;ref name="momen"/&gt;{{rp|127}}

[[File:Firma del acta de independencia de Venezuela.jpg|thumb|right|300px|1876 study by [[Martín Tovar y Tovar]] depicting the signing of the declaration.]]

The '''Venezuelan Declaration of Independence''' (''Cinco de Julio'') is a statement adopted by a congress of Venezuelan provinces on July 5, 1811, through which Venezuelans made the decision to separate from the [[Spain|Spanish Crown]] in order to establish a new nation based on the premises of equality of individuals, abolition of censorship and dedication to freedom of expression. These principles were enshrined as a [[constitution]]al principal for the new nation and were radically opposed to the political, cultural, and social practices that had existed during three hundred years of colonization.

Seven of the ten provinces belonging to the [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]] declared their independence and explained their reasons for this action, among them, that it was baneful that a small European nation ruled the great expanses of the New World, that [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]] recovered its right to self-government after the abdications of [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] and [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] at Bayonne, and that the [[Peninsular War|political instability in Spain]] dictated that Venezuelans rule themselves, despite the brotherhood they shared with Spaniards. The seven provinces were [[Venezuela Province|Caracas Province]], [[New Andalusia Province|Cumaná Province]], [[Barinas Province]], [[Margarita Province]], [[Barcelona Province (Venezuela)|Barcelona Province]], [[Mérida Province (Venezuela)|Mérida Province]] and [[Trujillo Province (Venezuela)|Trujillo Province]].

The three remaining provinces ([[Maracaibo Province (Spanish Empire)|Maracaibo Province]], [[Coro Province]] and [[Guayana Province]]) which did not take part in the Venezuelan congress opted to stay under Spanish rule.

The declaration proclaimed a new nation called the American Confederacy of Venezuela and was mainly written by [[Cristóbal Mendoza]] and  [[Juan Germán Roscio]]. It was ratified by Congress on July 7, 1811, and recorded in the Congress's Book of Minutes on August 17, 1811, in Caracas.

The anniversary of this declaration is celebrated as [[Independence Day (Venezuela)|Independence Day]]. The original Book of Minutes of the first Congress of Venezuela is in the [[Caracas#Federal Capitol|Federal Legislative Palace]] in Caracas.

The document is kept at the [[museo de la Casa de las Primeras Letras Simón Rodríguez]]. The signature of president [[Hugo Chávez]] was added to an exhibited copy of the document on May 31, 2013, by the Maduro administration,  as an homage to the former president. This resulted in outrage among various sectors opposing said administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.clarin.com/mundo/Agregan-firma-Chavez-acta-Independencia_0_929307138.html|title= Agregan la firma de Chávez al acta de Independencia de 1811|trans-title=The signature of Chávez is added to the 1811 declaration of independence|language= Spanish|author= |date= May 31, 2013|work= |publisher= Clarín|accessdate=May 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2435">'''WIITWD''' is an [[acronym]] in the alternative sexualities community for "'''What it is that we do'''". It is also sometimes written '''WIIWD''' (What it is we do). It is intended to include all activities that the mainstream would consider "[[Kink (sexual)|kink]]y".

The term was developed in [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]]s when individuals pointed out that the popular term [[BDSM]] applied to only a fraction of the community. Some people, such as those solely into [[paraphilic infantilism|infantilism]] or 
[[cross-dressing]] do not get involved at all in the [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], [[D/s]] or [[sadomasochism]] scenes, and as such reject the label BDSM, but still consider themselves part of the alternative community. Many also eschew the terms "[[sexual fetishism|fetish]]" or "kink".

So, in an attempt to be all-inclusive, the term "WIITWD" was developed and has enjoyed some popularity.

The term is purposely vague and broad, and many are not satisfied with it for that very reason. It has been said that nearly any sexual activity could be included under the acronym. The general policy, therefore, is to use WIITWD only in rare cases where there is a need to refer to the broadest possible group.

==History==
The earliest recorded mention of WIITWD is in the [[Usenet]] group [[alt.sex.bondage]] by Steven Davis, January 9, 1995, in a summary/critique of writer Jon Jacobs'&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HIeJeIOuqBoC&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=jon+jacobs+new+york+times+s%26m&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PrgPYwhvNI&amp;sig=M72mCTplicbd-JYwhVcFnX25K7w&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2U0GTZzTD4v2swPVzNCxDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Books.google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enslavement.org.uk/jacobs Enslavement.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; theories about what was and wasn't "real" kink.  Davis explicitly attributes the term to another poster named Bill Bohrer.

::"JJ believes that most people who are interested in what he calls D&amp;S, what I call 'our thing' and Bill Borher calls wiitwd (what it is that we do) and most people on ASB call BDSM, are interested in power exchange.  Though people tend to think of power exchange in terms of the DS component of BDSM, it can occur within any kind of encounter in which one person cedes power to another."

'''''White Heat''''' is a cookbook by [[chef]] [[Marco Pierre White]], published in 1990. It features black and white photographs by [[Bob Carlos Clarke]]. It is partially autobiographical, and is considered to be the chef's first memoir. The book is cited today as having influenced the careers of several Michelin starred and [[celebrity chef]]s, and was described by one critic as "possibly the most influential recipe book of the last 20 years".&lt;ref name=raynerquote/&gt;

==Description==
Initially published in 1990, ''White Heat'' was part [[autobiography]] of chef [[Marco Pierre White]] and part cookbook,&lt;ref name=q&amp;alaweekly&gt;{{cite news|last=Scattergood|first=Amy|title=Q &amp; A With Marco Pierre White: Escoffier, Television, Packaged Soup + The French Foreign Legion|url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/squidink/2011/08/marco_pierre_white.php|accessdate=10 February 2012|newspaper=LA Weekly|date=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that portrays White's "bad boy" chef image.&lt;ref name=womenshealth&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Foodie: Michael Symon|journal=Women's Health|date=May 2008|volume=5|issue=4|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I8YDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; White was introduced by actress [[Lowri-Ann Richards]] to her friend [[Bob Carlos Clarke]]. Clarke photographed White for a [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.|Levi jeans]] advert and went on to create the images for ''White Heat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hadley|first=Kate|title=Marc and me: A year of living dangerously with TV's celebrity chef Marco Pierre White|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-498231/Marc-A-year-living-dangerously-TVs-celebrity-chef-Marco-Pierre-White.html|accessdate=11 February 2012|newspaper=The Daily Mail|date=30 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking following Clarke's death in 2006, Marco Pierre White said, "He was like my prop. Without Bob there would never have been ''White Heat''."&lt;ref name=tribute&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheesman|first=Chris|title=Pierre White Show Pays Tribute to Carlos Clarke|url=http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/news/top_chefs_show_pays_tribute_to_carlos_clarke_news_99390.html|accessdate=10 February 2012|newspaper=Amateur Photographer|date=2 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''White Heat'' is credited with changing the image of chefs to [[sex symbol]]s.&lt;ref name=breaksmold&gt;{{cite news|last=Rose|first=Hilary|title=Marco Pierre White Breaks the Mould|page=5|publisher=News International Trading Limited|newspaper=The Times|date=6 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photographs showed White in and out of the workplace, including smoking in the kitchen and working with his team,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Whitworth|first=Melissa|title=Anthony Bourdain, chef and best-selling writer|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/7801293/Anthony-Bourdain-chef-and-best-selling-writer.html|accessdate=11 February 2012|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a young [[Gordon Ramsay]].&lt;ref name=breaksmold/&gt; One of the photographs featured White with a dead baby shark, which was laid across his lap in Clarke's garden for the shot. Clarke's wife Lindsay later said in an interview that Marco went on to gut the shark there and then in the garden, "The stench was unbelievable. I was pregnant at the time and the odour haunted me."&lt;ref name=favouriteuncle&gt;{{cite news|title=Bob, Chelsea girls' favourite uncle|url=http://londonersdiary.standard.co.uk/2009/05/bob-chelsea-girls-favourite-uncle.html|accessdate=11 February 2012|newspaper=Evening Standard|date=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another photograph featured White nude with a side of [[Piglet (animal)|piglet]] in his lap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=D'Souza|first=Christa|title=The Cook, his Fiancee, the Tantrums|newspaper=The Times|publisher=News International Trading Limited|date=26 July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Clarke's images of White was included in a set of ten donated to the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]], in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=National Portrait Gallery receives Carlos Clarke images|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-23696626|accessdate=14 August 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
John Lanchester, for ''The Observer'' magazine supplement ''Life'' in 2003, described the book as "gastroporn".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lanchester|first=John|title=Dear Marco The Restaurant|newspaper=The Observer Life|publisher=Guardian Newspapers Limited|date=3 October 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sue Gaisford, reviewing the book for ''The Independent'', described it as a "Marco Pierre White fanzine-with-recipes" and an "ego-trip".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gaisford|first=Sue|title=Book Review|newspaper=The Independent|publisher=Independent Print Ltd|date=18 December 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 food critic [[Jay Rayner]] called ''White Heat'' "possibly the most influential recipe book of the last 20 years".&lt;ref name=raynerquote&gt;{{cite news|last=Rayner|first=Jay|title=The Man with the Dough|newspaper=Observer Food Monthly|publisher=Guardian Newspapers Limited|date=10 July 2005 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2005/jul/10/foodanddrink.features12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''White Heat'' is credited as being the first chef [[memoir]],&lt;ref name=q&amp;alaweekly/&gt; and has been cited as influencing the future careers of [[Michelin star]]red chefs, including [[Sat Bains]] and [[Tom Kerridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TV chefs 'encourage boys to cook'|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/276035-tv-chefs-encourage-boys-to-cook|accessdate=10 February 2012|newspaper=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mylifeinfood&gt;{{cite news|title=My life in food: Tom Kerridge|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/my-life-in-food-tom-kerridge-6285538.html|accessdate=10 February 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[celebrity chef]]s [[Curtis Stone]] and [[Jean-Christophe Novelli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet Curtis Stone|url=http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/takehomechef/bio.html|publisher=TLC|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scott|first=Chloe|title=Cooking up a storm at Christmas|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/metrolife/food/802463-cooking-up-a-storm-at-christmas|accessdate=11 February 2012|newspaper=Metro|date=1 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' published an article on 13 May 1998 describing White's career, using a passage from ''White Heat'' to say that the chef had a "well-publicized bout with drugs and alcohol".&lt;ref name=nyteditor&gt;{{cite news|title=Editors' Note|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/16/nyregion/editors-note-875465.html?src=pm|accessdate=11 February 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=16 September 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; It published an apology to the chef regarding this statement later that year on 16 September, describing the passage it had used from the book as "ambiguous".&lt;ref name=nyteditor/&gt; The passage described White going on a drink and drugs "[[Binge drinking|bender]]",&lt;ref name=drinksbender/&gt; something that White later denied in court during the libel case, saying that he did not proof-read his books as he is [[dyslexic]].&lt;ref name=drinksbender&gt;{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Lorraine|title=Marco: I Didn't go on Binge|page=15|newspaper=The Daily Mirror|publisher=Mirror Group|date=5 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White's first appearance on the television show [[Hell's Kitchen (UK TV series)|''Hell's Kitchen'']] in 2007 caused the price of second-hand copies of his old cookbooks to spike. ''White Heat'' had been seen as a collector's item, but after the television show, the price increased to as much as £250 for a signed first edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Muir|first=Jenny|title=Collectable food books|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/books/features/3829/Collectable_food_books.html|accessdate=10 February 2012|newspaper=Time Out|date=13 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 it was recommended by television chef [[Michael Symon]], writing for ''[[Women's Health (magazine)|Women's Health]]'', despite being out of print in America at the time.&lt;ref name=womenshealth /&gt; [[Arthur Potts Dawson]] described it as a "rock'n'roll cookbook" in an interview with ''[[The Independent]]'' in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Montgomery|first=Hugh|title=Arthur Potts Dawson: 'I love fudge, but my teeth are wrecked because of it'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/arthur-potts-dawson-i-love-fudge-but-my-teeth-are-wrecked-because-of-it-6284835.html|accessdate=11 February 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
