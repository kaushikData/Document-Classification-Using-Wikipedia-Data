== History ==
500 Women Scientists launched with an open letter signed by 500 women scientists after the [[2016 presidential election in the united states|United States 2016 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/an-open-letter-from-and-to-female-scientists/|title=An Open Letter from and to Female Scientists|last=Ramirez|first=Kelly|work=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-38094016|title=Women in science pledge to combat hate|last=Gill|first=Victoria|date=2016-11-25|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/11/30/scientists-are-really-really-worried-about-donald-trump/|title=Scientists are really, really worried about Donald Trump|last=Kaplan|first=Sarah|date=2016-11-30|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/over-9000-women-in-science-rally-to-fight-hate-given-voice-following-us-election/|title=Over 9,000 Women In Science Rally To Fight Hate Given Voice Following US Election|work=IFLScience|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter pledged to speak out not only against policies that go against scientific evidence, but also against inequality, sexism, xenophobia, and other forms of discrimination against marginalized communities. Within two months, the pledge received over fifteen thousand signatures from women and allies in 109 countries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/898442/trumps-anti-women-and-anti-science-policies-are-catalyzing-a-global-movement-for-equality-in-the-sciences/|title=Trump’s anti-women and anti-science policies are pushing female scientists to action|last=Bagri|first=Neha Thirani|work=Quartz|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In concert with the 2017 [[2017 Women's March|Women's March]], women scientists and supporters who signed the pledge organized themselves into groups to march together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/01/the-women-scientists-standing-up-to-trump/514094/|title=A Day With the Women Scientists Protesting Trump|last=Meyer|first=Robinson|date=2017-01-24|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reardon|first=Sara|date=2017-01-22|title=Scientists join massive protest against Trump|url=https://www.nature.com/news/scientists-join-massive-protest-against-trump-1.21345|journal=Nature|language=en|doi=10.1038/nature.2017.21345|issn=1476-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hilarybrueck/2017/01/21/why-were-dozens-of-people-in-white-lab-coats-at-the-womens-march-in-dc/#391a861543ae|title=Why Were Dozens Of People In White Lab Coats At The Women's March In DC?|last=Brueck|first=Hilary|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The local marches became the basis for forming local chapters, or "Pods", where local women scientists meet regularly.

== Programs and Initiatives ==

===Request a Woman Scientist===
To increase representation of women on conference panels and in high-profile science journalism stories, 500 Women Scientists launched a [https://500womenscientists.org/request-a-scientist Request a Woman Scientist] database for self-identifying women with expertise in STEMM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine) fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/i-spent-two-years-trying-to-fix-the-gender-imbalance-in-my-stories/552404/|title=I Spent Two Years Trying to Fix the Gender Imbalance in My Stories|last=Yong|first=Ed|date=2018-02-06|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/how-to-find-a-woman-scientist/|title=How to Find a Woman Scientist|last=Nowak|first=Katarzyna|work=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://earther.com/there-s-no-excuse-for-not-getting-a-woman-scientists-in-1822203656|title=There’s No Excuse For Not Getting a Woman Scientist's Input Anymore|last=Kahn|first=Brian|work=Earther|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/5324/request-a-woman-scientist-through-500-women|title=Request a Woman Scientist Through 500 Women Scientists|work=New Learning Times|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The database currently contains over 6,000 women in 104 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://500womenscientists.org/request-a-scientist|title=Request a Scientist|website=500 Women Scientists|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public engagement ===
500 Women Scientists often uses science writing as a means of communicating their expertise and values to the public at large, with pieces featured in outlets like ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', ''[[Scientific American]]'', and ''[[The Seattle Times]]''. The global leadership team has authored a number of opinion pieces on topics as varied as calling for evidence-based policy-making at the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], recommending policy reforms to combat sexual harassment in academia, and encouraging journal editors to think carefully about fostering equity and inclusion in their editorial pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/author/500-women-scientists/|title=Stories by 500 Women Scientists|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zaringhalam|first=Maryam|last2=Vijayaraghavan|first2=Rukmani|last3=Simonis|first3=Juniper|last4=Ramirez|first4=Kelly|last5=Zelikova|first5=Jane|last6=Scientists|first6=on behalf of 500 Women|date=2018-04-13|title=Journal editors should not divide scientists|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/163.1|journal=Science|language=en|volume=360|issue=6385|pages=163–164|doi=10.1126/science.aat6288|issn=0036-8075|pmid=29650666}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/as-epa-head-scott-pruitt-must-act-on-climate-change/|title=As EPA head, Scott Pruitt must act on climate change|date=2017-02-20|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local Pods have also written about issues facing their own communities, ranging from the effect of [[Executive Order 13767|President Trump's border wall]] on California wildlife the need to stop burning coal in the [[Puget Sound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://massivesci.com/articles/border-wall-mexico-environment-california/|title=Trump's wall would harm unique and fragile wildlife on the California border|last=Trexler|first=Christa|work=Massive|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2018/02/06/25786491/guest-editorial-puget-sound-energy-needs-to-stop-burning-coal-in-montana|title=Guest Editorial: Puget Sound Energy Needs to Stop Burning Coal in Montana|work=The Stranger|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agricultural productivity''' is measured as the ratio of agricultural outputs to [[Agriculture|agricultural]] inputs.&lt;ref&gt;Measuring Agricultural Productivity Using the Average Productivity Index (API) by Lal Mervin Dharmasiri [http://www.sljol.info/index.php/SLJASS/article/download/4855/3884]&lt;/ref&gt; While individual products are usually measured by weight, their varying densities make measuring overall agricultural output difficult. Therefore, output is usually measured as the [[market value]] of final output, which excludes intermediate products such as corn [[Fodder|feed]] used in the [[meat industry]]. This output value may be compared to many different types of inputs such as labour and land (yield). These are called partial measures of productivity.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Agricultural productivity may also be measured by what is termed [[total factor productivity]] (TFP). This method of calculating agricultural productivity compares an index of agricultural inputs to an index of outputs. This measure of agricultural productivity was established to remedy the shortcomings of the partial measures of productivity; notably that it is often hard to identify the factors cause them to change. Changes in TFP are usually attributed to technological improvements.&lt;ref&gt;Agricultural Investment and Productivity in Developing Countries, FAO Economic And Social Development Paper No. 148, ed. Lydia Zepeda, 2001, FAO Corporate Document Repository, 12 July 2007, http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/X9447E/x9447e00.HTM.[http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/X9447E/x9447e00.HTM]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance of agricultural productivity==
The productivity of a region's [[farm]]s is important for many reasons. Aside from providing more [[food]], increasing the productivity of farms affects the region's prospects for growth and competitiveness on the agricultural market, [[income distribution]] and savings, and labour migration. An increase in a region's agricultural productivity implies a more [[efficiency|efficient]] distribution of scarce resources. As farmers adopt new techniques and differences, the more productive farmers benefit from an increase in their welfare while farmers who are not productive enough will exit the market to seek success elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Mundlak, Yair, "Agricultural Productivity and Economic Policies: Concepts and Measurements," OECD Working Paper No. 75, OECD Development Center, August 1992, SourceOECD.org, 13 July 2007 http://miranda.sourceoecd.org/vl=4172647/cl=20/nw=1/rpsv/cgi-bin/wppdf?file=5lgsjhvj7g21.pdf (13–16).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:StanhopeFactory.JPG|thumb|right|A [[cooperative]] dairy factory in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]].]]
As a region's farms become more productive, its [[comparative advantage]] in agricultural products increases, which means that it can produce these products at a lower [[opportunity cost]] than can other regions. Therefore, the region becomes more competitive on the [[world]] market, which means that it can attract more [[consumer]]s since they are able to buy more of the products offered for the same amount of money.

Increases in agricultural productivity lead also to agricultural growth and can help to alleviate [[poverty]] in poor and [[developing countries]], where agriculture often employs the greatest portion of the population. As farms become more productive, the wages earned by those who work in agriculture increase. At the same time, food prices decrease and food supplies become more stable. Labourers therefore have more money to spend on food as well as other products. This also leads to agricultural growth. People see that there is a greater opportunity to earn their living by farming and are attracted to agriculture either as owners of farms themselves or as labourers.&lt;ref name="oecd.org"&gt;Promoting Pro-Poor Growth: Agriculture, DAC Guidelines and Reference Series, Paris: OECD, 2006, OECD.org, 13 July 2007 {{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/9/60/37922155.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817215241/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/9/60/37922155.pdf |archivedate=2007-08-17 |df= }} (10).&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Carrobotte g1.jpg|thumb|right|A liquid [[manure spreader]].]]
However, it is not only the people employed in agriculture who benefit from increases in agricultural productivity. Those employed in other sectors also enjoy lower food prices and a more stable food supply. Their wages may also increase.&lt;ref name="oecd.org"/&gt;

Agricultural productivity is becoming increasingly important as the [[world population]] continues to grow. [[India]], one of the world's most populous countries, has taken steps in the past decades to increase its land productivity. Forty years ago, [[North India]] produced only [[wheat]], but with the advent of the earlier maturing high-yielding wheats and [[rice]]s, the wheat could be harvested in time to plant rice. This wheat/rice combination is now widely used throughout the [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], [[Haryana]], and parts of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. The wheat yield of three tons and rice yield of two tons combine for five tons of grain per [[hectare]], helping to feed India's 1.1 billion people. &lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lester R. Plan B 2.0: Rescuing a Planet Under Stress an36353d a Civilization in Trouble. New York City: Earth Policy Institute, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agricultural productivity and sustainable development==
Increase in agricultural productivity is often linked with questions about sustainability and [[sustainable development]]. Changes in agricultural practices necessarily bring changes in demands on resources. This means that as regions implement measures to increase the productivity of their farm land, they must also find ways to ensure that future generations will also have the resources they will need to live and thrive.

[[File:Cost of chicken in time worked.jpg|thumb|320px|right|An hour's work in 1998 bought 11 times as much chicken as in 1900.  Shown this way includes the increase in overall buying power plus lowered costs from the farm to the consumer.]] 
Between 1950 and 2000, during the so-called "second agricultural revolution of modern times", U.S. agricultural productivity rose fast, especially due to the development of new technologies. For example, the average amount of milk produced per cow increased from 5,314 pounds to 18,201 pounds per year (+242%), the average yield of corn rose from 39 bushels to 153 bushels per acre (+292%), and each farmer in 2000 produced on average 12 times as much farm output per hour worked as a farmer did in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;FUGLIE, Keith O.; MacDONALD, James M. and BALL, Eldon.'''Productivity Growth in U.S. Agriculture'''.

==Productive farms==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2016}}

For many [[farmer]]s (especially in non-industrial countries) agricultural productivity may mean much more.{{citation needed|date=March 2007}} A productive farm is one that provides most of the resources necessary for the farmer's family to live, such as [[food]], [[fuel]], [[fiber]], [[herbalism|healing plants]], etc. It is a farm which ensures [[food security]] as well as a way to sustain the [[well-being]] of a community. This implies that a productive farm is also one which is able to ensure proper management of [[natural resources]], such as [[biodiversity]], [[soil]], [[water]], etc. For most farmers, a productive farm would also produce more goods than required for the community in order to allow [[trade]].

[[Biodiversity|Diversity]] in agricultural production is one key to productivity, as it enables [[risk management]] and preserves potentials for [[adaptation]] and change. [[Monoculture]] is an example of such a nondiverse production system.  In a monocultural system a farmer may produce only [[crop]]s, but no livestock, or only livestock and no crop.

The benefits of raising [[livestock]], among others, are that it provides multiple goods, such as food, wool, hides, and transportation. It also has an important value in term of social relationships (such as gifts in [[wedding]]s). In case of [[famine]], when crops are not sufficient to ensure [[food safety]], livestock can be used as food. Livestock may also provide [[manure]], which can be used to [[fertilizer|fertilize]] cultivated soils, which increases [[soil productivity]]. On the other hand, in an agricultural system based only on raising livestock, food has to be bought from other farmers, and [[waste]]s produced cannot be easily disposed of.
Production has many functions, and diversity is the foundation of such production. To ignore the complex functions provided by a farm is thought by many to turn agricultural production into a [[commodity]].{{citation needed|date=March 2007}}

'''China–Brazil Earth Resources Satellite 3''' ('''CBERS-3'''), also known as '''Ziyuan I-03''' or '''Ziyuan 1D''', was a [[remote sensing]] satellite intended for operation as part of the [[China–Brazil Earth Resources Satellite program]]me between the [[China]] [[China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application|Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application]] and [[Brazil]]'s [[National Institute for Space Research]].&lt;ref name="gsp"/&gt; The fourth CBERS satellite to fly, it was lost in a launch failure in December 2013.

==Spacecraft==
CBERS-3 was a {{convert|1980|kg|lb|adj=on}} spacecraft based on the [[Phoenix-Eye 1]] [[satellite bus]].&lt;ref name="gsp"/&gt; It was developed by the [[China Academy of Space Technology]], in partnership with Brazil, at a cost of US$125 million for each party. The spacecraft had a single solar array which would have provided power to its systems, generating 2,300&amp;nbsp;watts of electrical power, and had a design life of three years.&lt;ref name="EOP"/&gt;

The CBERS-3 spacecraft carried four instruments: MUXCam, a multispectral camera; PanMUX, a [[panchromatic]] imager; the Infrared Medium Resolution Scanner, or IRSCAM, and WFICAM, a wide-field imaging camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbers.inpe.br/ingles/satellites/description_cbers3_4.php|title=CBERS - Satélite Sino-Brasileiro de Recursos Terrestres|publisher=INPE|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cameras were to have been used to observe a swath of {{convert|120|km}} of landmass at a time, enabling the satellite to scan the entire surface of the planet every 26 days, with a spatial resolution of up to {{convert|20|m}}.&lt;ref name="GdP"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/vidaecidadania/conteudo.phtml?tl=1&amp;id=1429846&amp;tit=Brasil-vai-ao-espaco-via-China|title=Brasil vai ao espaço via China|trans-title=Brazil goes to space through China|work=Gazeta do Povo|accessdate=2013-12-04|date=2013-12-02|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBERS-3 was initially scheduled to be launched in 2010, however delays in its deployment, including failures in the electric conversion system, caused it to slip to 2013. The satellite would have restored the Brazilian government's ability to observe its own territory following a three-and-a-half-year gap caused by the failure of [[CBERS-2B]]. One of the objectives of the CBERS-3 satellite's mission was to help monitor the process of [[deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest]].&lt;ref name="GdP" /&gt;

==Launch failure==
A [[Long March 4B|Chang Zheng 4B]] carrier rocket was used to launch CBERS-3. The launch took place at 03:26 UTC on 9 December 2013, using [[Taiyuan Launch Complex 9|Launch Complex 9]] at the [[Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center|Taiyuan Satellite Launch Centre]]. The satellite was intended to be placed into a [[sun-synchronous orbit]], however the rocket malfunctioned, resulting in the loss of the satellite. China has begun an investigation into the causes of the failure.

In response to the failure, China and Brazil have called for an extraordinary committee meeting to discuss the causes for the accident, next steps to be taken in the programme and the acceleration the development and deployment of the [[CBERS-4]] satellite, which had originally been scheduled for launch in 2015.&lt;ref name="falha"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbers.inpe.br/noticia.php?Cod_Noticia=3471|title=Lançamento do CBERS-3|publisher=INPE|date=December 9, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''ChargeBox''' is a machine for charging devices such as [[mobile phones]], [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s, [[iPod]]s, [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]]s, and other small, mobile electronics. They can be situated in locations between the home and the office, with securable lockers, so devices can be safely charged at the owner’s convenience. Other [[vending machines]] that are also capable of performing this function are operated by [[Photo-Me International]]. In Germany, a ChargeBox has the same purpose but is free to use, as it is financed by the integrated advertising space. They were introduced in 2005.
[[Image:Road Chef Norton Canes.JPG|thumb|300px|right|ChargeBox installed at [[Norton Canes services]], [[M6 Toll]].]]

==Usage==
ChargeBoxes allow the users of mobile devices to recharge them while away from home or the office. A [[YouGov]] survey conducted in June 2006 found that 61% of under-30-year-olds had run out of battery power on their mobiles while out and about within the previous month. Also, 48% of under-30-year-olds said that they had been in situations when they had wanted to use the features on their phones, but had refrained from doing so for fear of running out of battery power.

==Locations==
The first machines have been sited at locations such as easyInternetcafes, Aurora Hotels, [[Holiday Inn]]s, [[Novotel]], [[RoadChef]], [[Tower 42]], [[Vodafone]] stores,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rautu|first=Ovidiu|title=Vodafone UK Delivers the 'ChargeBox'|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Vodafone-UK-delivers-customers-the-039-Chargebox-039-95222.shtml|publisher=[[Softpedia]]|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=October 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the Carphone Warehouse and various airports. About one hundred ChargeBoxes are installed in the UK in total.

In September 2006, ChargeBox began to launch the product in countries beyond the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coolest-gadgets#com/20060604/the-chargebox-no-battery-no-problem/{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The ChargeBox – no battery – no problem » Coolest Gadgets&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; {{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computer Engineer Barbie''' is the 126th [[Barbie's careers|career version]] of [[Mattel]]'s [[Barbie]] doll. In response to poll results indicating strong support for computer engineers, the doll set was created and introduced in 2010. In 2014 Mattel apologized for the accompanying book, '''''I Can Be a Computer Engineer''''', after internet complaints that it represented Barbie as incompetent in the field, needing the help of men. 

==Description==
The doll has a pink laptop and a pink smartphone, and is wearing geometric pink glasses, a pink watch, black leggings, a T-shirt decorated with "Barbie" spelled in [[binary code]], a fitted vest with saddle-stitch detailing, pink wedges, and a [[Bluetooth]] headset.&lt;ref name=Trib&gt;Melissa Harris, [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-04-14/business/ct-biz-0414-confidential-20100414_1_barbie-betty-shanahan-mattel-marketers "Mattel launching computer engineer Barbie"], Chicago Confidential, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', April 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;Elizabeth Diffin, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8517097.stm "Does Barbie's new geeky look fit with reality?"], [[BBC]] News Magazine, 16 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The packaging included a code to unlock exclusive game content on the Barbie website.&lt;ref name=Computerworld&gt;Sharon Gaudin, [http://www.computerworld.com/article/2520978/it-careers/look-who-s-a-nerd--barbie-becomes-computer-engineer.html "Look who's a nerd: Barbie becomes computer engineer"], ''[[Computerworld]]'', February 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Female engineers including Betty Shanahan, CEO of the [[Society of Women Engineers]], and Alice Agogino of the [[United States National Academy of Engineering|National Academy of Engineering]] were consulted on her wardrobe and work environment.&lt;ref name=Trib/&gt;&lt;ref name=Computerworld/&gt;&lt;ref name=Laptop/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cathy Cockrell, [http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2013/01/28/alice-agogino-wins-aaas-lifetime-mentor-award/ "The making of a 'lifetime mentor award' winner"], [[University of California, Berkeley]] news, January 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; They suggested that for authenticity she needed "a Coke can and a bag of Doritos" on her desk; she has a coffee cup. One mockup also included a [[Tux (mascot)|Linux penguin]];&lt;ref name=Laptop&gt;K. T. Bradford, [http://blog.laptopmag.com/how-mattel-designed-computer-engineer-barbie-to-excite-adult-geeks-young-minds "How Mattel Designed Computer Engineer Barbie to Excite Adult Geeks, Young Minds"], ''Laptop'', February 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Barbie is running Linux on her dual-monitor set-up.&lt;ref name=Toms&gt;Jane McEntegart, [http://www.tomsguide.com/us/Barbie-Mattel-Barbie-Computer-Engineer,news-5835.html "Computer Engineer Barbie: Dual Monitors, Linux"], ''Tom's Guide'', February 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2010 Mattel invited people to vote for Barbie's 126th career, the first instance of this in the company's history. Voters were able to choose between five choices: computer engineer, architect, environmentalist, news anchor, and surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/barbies-next-career-computer-engineer/|title=Barbie's Next Career? Computer Engineer|last=Miller|first=Claire Cain|work=Bits Blog|access-date=2017-09-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although girls preferred news anchor, computer engineer was the most popular choice in online polling,&lt;ref name=Laptop/&gt; partly because of promotion by the Society of Women Engineers.&lt;ref name=Trib/&gt;&lt;ref name=Computerworld/&gt;&lt;ref name=Toms/&gt; The two dolls were launched together at the 2010 [[American International Toy Fair]].&lt;ref name=Computerworld/&gt;&lt;ref name=Laptop/&gt;

==Reception==
Many writers for tech publications and other reviewers were encouraged by the choice of career, hoping it would encourage girls to consider careers in computer science.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Laptop/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terry Hancock, [http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/post_christmas_review_tech_toys_and_gnu_linux_compatibility "Post-Christmas Review: Tech Toys and GNU/Linux Compatibility"], ''Free Software Magazine'', February 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNET&gt;Amanda Kooser, [http://www.cnet.com/news/barbie-book-implies-girls-cant-be-coders-mattel-apologizes/ "Barbie book implies girls can't be coders; Mattel apologizes"], [[CNET]], November 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the amount of pink, the hairstyle, and the stylish clothes struck some women as unrealistic and stereotyped.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

The accompanying book, ''I Can Be a Computer Engineer'', was issued in 2013 together with ''I Can Be an Actress''.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Marenco, ''Barbie: I Can Be an Actress / I Can Be a Computer Engineer'', New York: Random House Juvenile, 2013, {{ISBN|9780449816202}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USA&gt;Lori Grisham, [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/11/19/computer-barbie-help-technology-sexist/19264459/ "Engineer Barbie has computer problems. Call the boys?"], ''[[USA Today]]'', November 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The book received extensive criticism, especially beginning in November 2014, for depicting Barbie as relying on two male friends to program the game she is designing.&lt;ref name=CNET/&gt;&lt;ref name=USA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornell Barnard, [http://abc7news.com/shopping/barbie-gets-backlash-for-needing-mans-tech-help/401744/ "Barbie gets backlash for needing man's tech help"], [[KGO-TV]], November 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they need to help her after she accidentally infects her and her sister [[Skipper (Barbie)|Skipper]]'s computers with a virus (via the pink heart-shaped USB stick she wears around her neck), after ignoring advice from her (female) computer teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schaub, [http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-barbie-computer-engineer-book-sexism-allegations-20141119-story.html "Barbie computer engineer book criticized for 'sexist drivel'"], Jacket Copy, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', November 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;Aisha Gani, [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/nov/19/-sp-barbie-can-be-a-computer-engineer-but-only-with-help-of-a-man "Barbie can be a computer engineer ... but only with help of a man"], Women, ''[[The Guardian]]'', November 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Time&gt;Laura Stampler, [https://time.com/3595106/mattel-apologizes-for-making-barbie-look-incompetent-in-barbie-i-can-be-a-computer-engineer/ "Mattel Apologizes for Making Barbie Look Incompetent in Barbie: I Can Be a Computer Engineer"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', November 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Huffington&gt;Kevin Short, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/19/barbie-computer-engineer_n_6187554.html "Mattel Apologizes For Depicting Barbie As An Incompetent Computer Engineer"], ''[[Huffington Post]]'', November 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;Heather Saul, [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/in-barbie-i-can-be-a-computer-engineer-men-do-all-the-coding-9873016.html "'Barbie: I Can Be A Computer Engineer' blasted because men do all the coding in the book"], ''[[The Independent]]'', November 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  

A website was created to enable people to replace segments of the book's text with their own,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/nov/19/-sp-barbie-can-be-a-computer-engineer-but-only-with-help-of-a-man|title=Barbie can be a computer engineer ... but only with help of a man|last=Gani|first=Aisha|date=2014-11-19|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-09-29|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mattel pulled the title from [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] after many critical reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Buhr, [https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/19/mattel-pulls-sexist-barbie-book-i-can-be-a-computer-engineer-off-amazon/ "Sexist Barbie Book 'I Can Be A Computer Engineer' Pulled Off Amazon"], ''[[TechCrunch]]'', November 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher stated it was being discontinued.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;Susanna Kim, [http://abcnews.go.com/Business/barbie-author-scared-open-email-book-labeled-sexist/story?id=27021301 "Barbie Author 'Scared to Open' Email After Book Labeled ‘Sexist’"], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] News, November 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A Mattel spokesperson said that the book had first been published in 2010 and was outdated,&lt;ref name="USA" /&gt; and the company apologized.&lt;ref name="CNET" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huffington" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt; The book's Barbie says she's "only creating the design ideas" and that her two male friends will have to do the coding; the author, who proclaimed herself a feminist, said her assignment had been to portray Barbie as a [[software design|designer]] and "regrets that she may have let stereotypes slip into the book".&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt;

In response to the complaints of the book Mattel posted an apology on their official Facebook page for Barbie, stating that the "portrayal of Barbie in this specific story doesn't reflect the Brand's vision for what Barbie stands for."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/11/22/365968465/after-backlash-computer-engineer-barbie-gets-new-set-of-skills|title=After Backlash, Computer Engineer Barbie Gets New Set Of Skills|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-09-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8405">'''Converged infrastructure''' operates by grouping multiple [[information technology]] (IT) components into a single, optimized computing package. Components of a converged infrastructure may include [[server (computing)|server]]s, [[data storage device]]s, [[Networking hardware|networking equipment]] and [[software]] for IT [[infrastructure]] management, automation and [[Orchestration (computing)|orchestration]].

IT organizations use converged infrastructure to centralize the management of IT resources, to consolidate systems, to increase resource-utilization rates, and to lower costs. Converged infrastructures foster these objectives by implementing pools of computers, storage and networking resources that can be shared by multiple applications and managed in a collective manner using policy-driven processes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencelogic.com/product/resources/whiteboard-converged-infrastructure-definition Overview of Converged Infrastructure]&lt;/ref&gt;

IT vendors and IT industry analysts use various terms to describe the concept of a converged infrastructure. These include "converged system", [[Fabric computing|"unified computing"]], "fabric-based computing", and "[[dynamic infrastructure]]".

==The evolution of data centers==

Historically, to keep pace with the growth of business applications and the [[terabyte]]s of data they generate, IT resources were deployed in a silo-like fashion. One set of resources has been devoted to one particular computing technology, business application or [[line of business]].  These resources support a single set of assumptions and cannot be optimized or reconfigured to support varying usage loads.

The proliferation of IT sprawl in data centers has contributed to rising operations costs, reducing productivity, and stifling agility and flexibility. Maintenance and operations can consume two-thirds of an organization’s technology budget, according to a 2009 &lt;ref name=infoweekreport&gt;[http://analytics.informationweek.com/abstract/83/1191/IT-Business-Strategy/research-2009-informationweek-500-report.html InformationWeek Reports ::Research: 2009 InformationWeek 500 Report]. Analytics.informationweek.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[InformationWeek]] survey of executives in 500 companies with annual revenue over $250 million.  That leaves just a third of the budget for new IT initiatives.  This ratio prevents IT from supporting new business initiatives or responding to real application demands.

A converged infrastructure addresses the problem of siloed architectures and IT sprawl by pooling and sharing IT resources. Rather than dedicating a set of resources to a particular computing technology, application or line of business, converged infrastructure creates a pool of [[Virtualization|virtualized]] servers, storage and networking capacity that is shared by multiple applications and lines of business.

==Benefits of converged infrastructure==

Converged infrastructure provides both technical and business efficiencies, according to industry researchers and observers.&lt;ref&gt;Mani, Rahul Neel with Donatelli, Dave. "Converged Infrastructure Means Endless Possibilities," ''[https://www.infosecisland.com/messages/about.html InfoSec Island]'', August 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  These gains stem in part from the pre-integration of technology components, the pooling of IT resources and the automation of IT processes. Converged infrastructure further contributes to efficient data centers by enhancing the ability of [[cloud computing]] systems to handle enormous data sets, using only a single integrated IT management system &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cuny|first1=Tim|title=Efficient Data Centers Are Built  On New Technologies and Strategies|url=http://www.cm-inc.com/CMIWhite/CMIWPDataCenterOptimizationB.pdf|website=www.cm-inc.com/|publisher=CMI (Chouinard &amp; Myhre, Inc.)|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[CIO magazine]]'', [[Forrester Research]] analyst Robert Whiteley noted that converged infrastructures, combining server, storage, and networks into a single framework, help to transform the economics [of] running the datacenter thus accelerating the transition to IP storage to help build infrastructures that are "cloud-ready".&lt;ref&gt;Whiteley, Robert. [[Forrester Research]]."Your Next IT Budget: 6 Ways to Support Business Growth," ''[http://www.cio.co.ke/Opinion-and-Analysis/your-next-it-budget-6-ways-to-support-business-growth.html CIO Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721082056/http://www.cio.co.ke/Opinion-and-Analysis/your-next-it-budget-6-ways-to-support-business-growth.html |date=2011-07-21 }}'', July 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of storage and compute into a single entity is known as [[converged storage]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Jessica. "Pivot3 Offers Converged Storage Platform to Data Protection Market," ChannelInsider, September 30, 2010. [http://www.channelinsider.com/c/a/Storage/Pivot3-Offers-Converged-Storage-Platform-to-Data-Protection-Market-103383/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Decreased complexity, through the use of pre-integrated hardware with virtualization and automation management tools, is another important value proposition for converged infrastructure as noted in an [[International Data Corporation|IDC]] study.&lt;ref name=IDCDoc&gt;Broderick, Katherine and Scaramella, Jed.  [http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=223528&amp;sessionId=FA2E733582EEFBB8EE861545FF009C7C "Considering All of IT:  Converged Infrastructure Survey Findings,"] IDC, June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, the open source analyst firm [[Wikibon]] released the first market forecast for converged infrastructure,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikibon.org/wiki/v/Converged_Infrastructure_Takes_the_Market_by_Storm Converged Infrastructure Takes the Market by Storm - Wikibon&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; with a projected $402B total available market (TAM) by 2017 of which, nearly 2/3rds of the infrastructure that supports enterprise applications will be packaged in some type of converged solution by 2017.

InformationWeek&lt;ref name=informationweek&gt;Crump, George. "Why 'Unified' Is The Hot New Idea For Data Centers," [http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/data_centers/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=215900021 InformationWeek], March 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  highlighted the promise of two long-term advantages of a unified data center infrastructure:  
#Lower costs as the result of both:
##lower capital expenses resulting from higher utilization, less cabling, and fewer network connections
##lower operating costs resulting from reduced labor via automated data center management and a consolidating storage and network management infrastructure teams
#Increased IT agility by:
##virtualizing [[Internet Protocol|IP]] and [[Fibre Channel]] [[Storage area network|storage networking]]
##allowing for single console management.

Data centers around the world are reaching limits in power, cooling and space.&lt;ref&gt;Uptime Institute.[http://www.techjournalsouth.com/2011/05/many-data-centers-running-out-of-space-this-year-or-next/ "Many data centers running out of space this year or next,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207010216/http://www.techjournalsouth.com/2011/05/many-data-centers-running-out-of-space-this-year-or-next/ |date=2011-12-07 }} May 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, capital constraints are requiring organizations to rethink data center strategy. Converged infrastructure offers a solution to these challenges.

==Converged infrastructure and cloud computing==

Converged infrastructure can serve as an enabling platform for private and public [[cloud computing]] services, including [[infrastructure as a service]] (IaaS), [[platform as a service]] (PaaS), and [[software as a service]] (SaaS) offerings.

Several characteristics make converged infrastructure well suited to cloud deployments. These include the ability to pool IT resources, to automate resource provisioning and to scale up and down capacity quickly to meet the needs of dynamic computing workloads.

'''Cutlery''' includes any hand [[Tool|implement]] used in preparing, serving, and especially eating [[food]] in [[Western culture]]. A person who makes or sells cutlery is called a '''cutler'''. The city of [[Sheffield]] in England has been famous for the production of cutlery since the 17th century and a train – the [[Master Cutler (train)|''Master Cutler'']] – running from Sheffield to [[London]] was named after the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/the-master-cutler|title=The Master Cutler|author=British Pathé|work=britishpathe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cutlery is more usually known as '''silverware''' or '''flatware''' in the [[United States]], where ''cutlery'' usually means knives and related cutting instruments.  Although the term ''silverware'' is used irrespective of the material composition of the utensils, the term ''[[tableware]]'' has come into use to avoid the implication that they are made of [[Silver (household)|silver]].

The major items of cutlery in [[Western culture]] are the [[knife]], [[fork]] and [[spoon]]. In recent times, hybrid versions of cutlery have been made combining the functionality of different eating implements, including the [[spork]] ('''''sp'''''oon / f'''''ork'''''), [[spife]] ('''''sp'''''oon / kn'''''ife'''''), and [[knork]] ('''''kn'''''ife / f'''''ork''''') or the [[sporf]] which combines all three.

==Etymology==
The word cutler derives from the [[Middle English]] word 'cuteler' and this in turn derives from [[Old French]] 'coutelier' which comes from 'coutel'; meaning knife (modern French: couteau).&lt;ref name="shef"&gt;The Sheffield Knife Book, Geoffrey Tweedale, The Hallamshire press, 1996, {{ISBN|1-874718-11-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word's early origins can be seen in the Latin word 'culter' (knife).

The first documented use of the term "cutler" in Sheffield appeared in a 1297 tax return. A Sheffield knife was listed in the King's possession in the [[Tower of London]] fifty years later. Several knives dating from the 14th century are on display at the [[Cutlers' Hall]] in Sheffield.&lt;ref name="shef" /&gt;

==Composition==
[[File:GeorgianCanteenLaidOut.jpg|thumb|A set (known as a ''canteen'') of [[Georgian era]] silver cutlery, including ladles, and serving spoons. The thin item on the left is a ''marrow scoop'' for eating [[Bone marrow]]]]
[[Sterling silver]] is the traditional material from which good quality cutlery is made (hence the usage of the term in the United States). Historically, silver had the advantage over other metals of being less chemically reactive. Chemical reactions between certain foods and the cutlery metal can lead to unpleasant tastes. Gold is even less reactive than silver, but the use of gold cutlery was confined to the exceptionally wealthy, such as monarchs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/29/stainless-steel-cutlery-gold-silver-copper-aluminium |title=Stainless steel revolutionised eating after centuries of a bad taste in the mouth  |last=Miodownik  |first= Mark  |date=29 April 2015 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even comparatively modest households might have one or two items of silver, often silver spoons. Wealthy individuals would own large sets containing a range of specialised dining implements, such as the comprehensive set in sterling silver made for the French aristocrat [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier]] (known as the Marquis de Lafayette) by the [[Towle Silversmiths|Towle Manufacturing Company]]. It contained, among many other items, a [[gravy]] ladle, [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]] spoon and [[lettuce]] fork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = An account of the life of Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert Dumotier, marquis de La Fayette ..: with illustrations of the La Fayette pattern of sterling silver tableware|last = |first = |publisher = Towle Mfg. Company|year = 1907|isbn = |location = Newburyport, Mass|pages = 67|hdl = 2027/nyp.33433082423595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steel]] was always used for more utilitarian knives, and [[pewter]] was used for some cheaper items, especially spoons. From the nineteenth century, [[electroplated nickel silver]] (EPNS) was used as a cheaper substitute for sterling silver.

In 1913, the British metallurgist [[Harry Brearley]] discovered [[stainless steel]] by chance and this metal has come to be the predominant one used in cutlery. An alternative is [[melchior (alloy)|melchior]], corrosion-resistant nickel and copper alloy, which can also sometimes contain manganese and nickel-iron.

[[Plastic]] cutlery is made for [[disposable]] use, and is frequently used outdoors for [[camping]], [[excursion]]s, and [[barbecue]]s for instance. Plastic cutlery is also commonly used at [[fast food|fast-food]] or [[take-away]] outlets and provided with [[airline meal]]s in economy class.
Plastic is also used for children's cutlery. It is often thicker and more durable than disposable plastic cutlery. 
[[Wooden]] disposable cutlery is also available as a [[biodegradable]] alternative.

==Industry==
[[File:Formal Place Setting.jpg|thumb|right|A [[table setting]] for an eight-course meal. It includes a [[Butter knife|butter spreader]] resting on a crystal stand; a cocktail fork, soup spoon, dessert fork, dessert spoon and an ice cream fork, as well as separate knives and forks for fish, [[entrée]], main course and salad]]
Cutlery has been made in many places. In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the industry became concentrated by the late 16th century in and around [[Birmingham]] and Sheffield. However, the Birmingham industry increasingly concentrated on [[sword]]s, made by "long cutlers", and on other edged tools, whereas the Sheffield industry concentrated on [[knife|knives]].

At Sheffield the trade of cutler became divided, with allied trades such as [[razor]]maker, [[bradawl|awl]]bladesmith, [[Shearing (manufacturing)|shearsmith]] and forkmaker emerging and becoming distinct trades by the 18th century.

Before the mid 19th century when cheap [[carbon steel|mild steel]] became available due to new methods of [[steelmaking]], knives (and other edged tools) were made by welding a strip of [[steel]] on to the piece of [[wrought iron|iron]] that was to be formed into a knife, or sandwiching a strip of steel between two pieces of iron.  This was done because steel was then a much more expensive commodity than iron. Modern blades are sometimes [[Chef's knife#Materials|laminated]], but for a different reason. Since the hardest steel is brittle, a layer of hard steel may be laid between two layers of a milder, less brittle steel, for a blade that keeps a sharp edge well, and is less likely to break in service.

After fabrication, the knife had to be sharpened, originally on a [[grindstone]], but from the late medieval period in a [[blade mill]] or (as they were known in the Sheffield region) a cutlers wheel.

===Disposable cutlery===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
[[File:BiodegradablePlasticUtensils.jpg|thumb|Starch-polyester disposable cutlery]]
Introduced for convenience purposes (lightweight, no cleanup after the meal required), [[disposable]] cutlery made of [[plastic]] has become a huge worldwide market. Along with other [[disposable tableware]] (paper plates, plastic table covers, [[disposable cup]]s, [[paper napkin]]s, etc.), these products have become essential for the [[fast food]] and [[catering]] industry. The products are emblematic of [[throw-away society|throw-away societies]] and the cause of millions of tons of non-biodegradable [[plastic waste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.10.001 |title=Reducing marine pollution from single-use plastics (SUPs): A review |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=137 |pages=157–171 |year=2018 |last1=Schnurr |first1=Riley E.J. |last2=Alboiu |first2=Vanessa |last3=Chaudhary |first3=Meenakshi |last4=Corbett |first4=Roan A. |last5=Quanz |first5=Meaghan E. |last6=Sankar |first6=Karthikeshwar |last7=Srain |first7=Harveer S. |last8=Thavarajah |first8=Venukasan |last9=Xanthos |first9=Dirk |last10=Walker |first10=Tony R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4044">'''Double-density compact disc''' ('''DDCD''') is an optical disc technology developed by [[Sony]] using the same laser wavelength as [[compact disc]], namely 780 nm. The format is defined by the ''[[Purple Book]]'' standard document. Unlike the compact-disc technology it is based on, DDCD was designed exclusively for data with no audio capabilities. &lt;ref name="CDRinfo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sony CRX200E DDCD-RW|url=http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/Reviews/Specific.aspx?ArticleId=6135|website=CDRinfo|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a 12 cm disc, it doubles the original 650 MB to 1.3 GB capacity of a [[CD]] on recordable (DDCD-R) and rewritable (DDCD-RW) discs by narrowing the track pitch from 1.6 to 1.1 [[micrometre|micrometer]]s, and shortening the minimum pit length from 0.833 to 0.623 micrometer. The DDCD was also available in read-only format (DDCD-ROM). The specification allowed for both 12 cm and 8 cm discs, although it appears no 8 cm media was ever released.

The technology, released years after rewritable DVD technology, failed to acquire significant market share. The only DDCD recorder introduced was the [[Sony CRX200E]]. While the initial launch price of the drive and the disc ($249 and $2-3 respectively) was lower than the prices of DVD-RW drives and media ($1000 and $10 respectively), an 85% increase in storage compared to the standard 700 MB CDs was not enough to entice customers. DVD offered a significantly higher capacity - nearly four times more than DDCD-R with 4.7 GB on single layer discs and six and a half times more with 8.5 GB on double layer discs and would drop significantly in cost in the years after DDCD's launch.

The DDCD technology was marked as 'legacy' in the 2006-edition of the [[SCSI Multimedia Commands]] set (MMC).

==Competition==
DDCD was part of a wave of technologies aimed at enhancing the compact disc, none of which managed to gain much marketshare.

[[MultiLevel Recording]], developed in 1992 by [[Optex Corporation]], was a proposed technology that never saw the light of the day. It promised to burn 2 GB onto one CD and a couple of disc burners from [[TDK]] and [[Plextor]] were set for release in 2002 for $200 with discs costing around $2. No ML products were ever released. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TDK Readies DVD-R, MultiLevel CD-RW Drives|url=https://www.twice.com/product/tdk-readies-dvd-r-multilevel-cd-rw-drives-1896|website=Twice|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2002, [[Sanyo]] announced it had achieved the same result as DDCD using standard CD-Rs with its HD-Burn technology. This allowed users to burn 1.4 GB on a standard 700 MB CD. However, the resulting CD could only be played back on DVD drives.

In 2003, [[Plextor]] released a CD burner that utilized their proprietary GigaRec technology to allow users to burn a maximum of 980 MB on a standard 80 minute CD and 1.2 GB of a 99 minute CD. Like DDCD, the result was achieved by burning smaller pits. The resulting disc could be read perfectly on Plextor GigaRec drive. Results with reading the disc on other optical drives were mixed.

[[File:SDR DDR QDR.svg|thumb|A comparison between [[single data rate]], double data rate, and [[quad data rate]]]]

In [[computing]], a [[computer bus]] operating with '''double data rate '''(DDR) transfers data on both the rising and falling edges of the [[clock signal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pqYl3SWkA64C&amp;pg=PA314 | isbn = 0-12-370490-1 | first1 = John L. | last1 = Hennessy | first2 = David A. | last2 = Patterson | first3 = Andrea. | last3 = Arpaci-Dusseau | author4 = … | year = 2007 | publisher = Morgan Kaufmann | location = Amsterdam | title = Computer architecture : a quantitative approach}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=November 2015}}  This is also known as '''double pumped''', '''dual-pumped''', and '''double transition'''.  The term '''toggle mode''' is used in the context of [[Flash memory#NAND flash|NAND flash memory]].

The simplest way to design a clocked [[electronic circuit]] is to make it perform one transfer per full cycle (rise and fall) of a [[clock signal]].  This, however, requires that the clock signal changes twice per transfer, while the data lines change at most once per transfer.  When operating at a high bandwidth, [[signal integrity]] limitations constrain the clock [[frequency]].  By using both edges of the clock, the data signals operate with the same limiting frequency, thereby doubling the data transmission rate.

This technique has been used for microprocessor [[front side bus]]ses, [[Parallel SCSI#Ultra-3|Ultra-3 SCSI]], graphics RAM (the [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]] bus and [[GDDR]]), [[SDRAM|main memory]] (both [[RDRAM]] and [[DDR SDRAM|DDR1]] through [[DDR4 SDRAM|DDR4]]), and the [[HyperTransport]] bus on [[AMD]]'s [[Athlon 64]] processors. It is more recently being used for other systems with high data transfer speed requirements{{spaced ndash}} as an example, for the output of [[analog-to-digital converter]]s (ADCs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= AD9467 ADC | type = data sheet |url= http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/data_sheets/AD9467.pdf |format= PDF |publisher= Analog Devices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DDR should not be confused with [[Dual-channel architecture|dual channel]], in which each memory channel accesses two RAM modules simultaneously. The two technologies are independent of each other and many motherboards use both, by using DDR memory in a dual channel configuration.

An alternative to double or [[Quad data rate|quad pumping]] is to make the link [[Self-clocking signal|self-clocking]]. This tactic was chosen by [[InfiniBand]] and [[PCI Express]].

== Relation of bandwidth and frequency ==
Describing the bandwidth of a double-pumped bus can be confusing.  Each clock edge is referred to as a ''[[beat (music)|beat]]'', with two beats (one [[upbeat]] and one [[Beat (music)#Downbeat|downbeat]]) per cycle.  Technically, the [[hertz]] is a unit of ''cycles'' per second, but many people refer to the number of ''transfers'' per second.  Careful usage generally talks about "500&amp;nbsp;MHz, double data rate" or "1000&amp;nbsp;[[Megatransfers per second|MT/s]]", but many refer casually to a "1000&amp;nbsp;MHz bus," even though no signal cycles faster than 500&amp;nbsp;MHz.

[[DDR SDRAM]] popularized the technique of referring to the bus bandwidth in [[megabytes per second]], the product of the transfer rate and the bus width in bytes.  DDR SDRAM operating with a 100&amp;nbsp;MHz clock is called DDR-200 (after its 200&amp;nbsp;MT/s data transfer rate), and a 64-bit (8-byte) wide [[DIMM]] operated at that data rate is called PC-1600, after its 1600&amp;nbsp;MB/s peak (theoretical) bandwidth.  Likewise, 1.6&amp;nbsp;GT/s transfer rate DDR3-1600 is called PC3-12800.

Some examples of popular designations of DDR modules:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Names !! Memory clock !! I/O bus clock !! [[Transfer (computing)|Transfer rate]] !! Theoretical bandwidth
|-
| DDR-200, PC-1600
| 100 MHz &lt;!--Divide by 2 for DDR1--&gt;
| 100 MHz
| 0.2 GT/s
| 1.6 GB/s

| DDR2-800, PC2-6400

| 800 MHz
| 1.6 GT/s
| 12.8 GB/s
|-
|DDR4-2400, PC4-19200
| 300 MHz &lt;!--DDR4 remains 8n prefetch, so divide by 8 for DDR4--&gt;
| 1200 MHz
| 2.4 GT/s

| 400&amp;nbsp;MHz &lt;!--DDR4 remains 8n prefetch, so divide by 8 for DDR4--&gt;
| 1600&amp;nbsp;MHz
| 3.2&amp;nbsp;GT/s
| 25.6&amp;nbsp;GB/s
|}

DDR SDRAM uses double-data-rate [[signalling (telecommunications)|signalling]] only on the data lines. Address and control signals are still sent to the DRAM once per clock ''cycle'' (to be precise, on the rising edge of the clock), and timing parameters such as [[CAS latency]] are specified in clock cycles. Some less common DRAM interfaces, notably [[LPDDR2]], [[GDDR5]] and [[XDR DRAM]], send commands and addresses using double data rate.

'''Fibernet Corp.''' is an [[Internet service provider|Internet service]] and [[Colocation (business)|colocation]] provider based in [[Orem, Utah]]. Founded in 1994, the ISP was one of Utah’s first colocation service companies. Fibernet provides service to Utah companies and residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiber.net/about.php |title=Fibernet: Utah colocation, Utah ISP, web hosting and more |publisher=Fiber.net |date= |access-date=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Fibernet completed construction of a [[data center]] facility and was the first ISP in Utah to become [[PCI DSS]]-compliant through the independent auditing company Cadence Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiber.net/pci_compliant_facility.php |title=Fibernet: Utah colocation, Utah ISP, web hosting and more |publisher=Fiber.net |date= |access-date=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fibernet also worked with The Cadence Group to receive [[SAS 70]] Type II certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wasatchdigitaliq.com/parser.php?nav=article&amp;article_id=3490&amp;PHPSESSID=96175143bdafc9c8beb50dc38704c6b1 |title=::: Digital IQ Magazine ::: |publisher=WasatchDigitalIQ.com |date=October 26, 2009 |access-date=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fibernet Corp.'s services include colocation, [[dedicated hosting]], [[Virtual private server|VPS]], and [[virtual hosting]], both commercial and residential. Fibernet also leases onsite and virtual office suites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiber.net/office.php |title=Fibernet: Utah colocation, Utah ISP, web hosting and more |publisher=Fiber.net |date= |access-date=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Fibernet began in 1994 with a primary focus on residential internet service, but in 1996, it expanded its product line to include internet services for businesses. In 1998, Fibernet created an international brand, Nethosting.com (d.b.a. NetHosting), to reach a broader market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiber.net/our_team.php |title=Fibernet: Utah colocation, Utah ISP, web hosting and more |publisher=Fiber.net |date= |accessdate=2012-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''giro''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|aɪ|r|oʊ|,_|ˈ|ʒ|ɪər|oʊ}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/giro|title=Definition of GIRO|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''giro transfer''', is a payment transfer from one [[bank account]] to another bank account and instigated by the payer, not the payee.&lt;ref name="rbi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=28619 |title=RBI Committee suggests GIRO based Indian Bill Payment System |publisher=Reserve Bank of India |date=7 May 2013 |accessdate=29 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206030651/http://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=28619 |archivedate=6 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[debit card]] has a similar model. Giros are primarily a European phenomenon; although electronic payment systems such as the [[Automated Clearing House]] exist in the United States and Canada, it is not possible to perform third party transfers with them. In the [[European Union]], there is the [[Single Euro Payments Area]] (SEPA) which allows electronic giro or [[debit card]] payment to be executed to any bank in the area.

In the [[United Kingdom]] and in other countries the term giro may refer to a specific system once operated by the post office.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary (online)&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the giro service was originally known as [[National Giro]]. In due course "giro" was adopted by the public and the press as a shorthand term for the [[girocheque]], which was a cheque and not a credit transfer.  Meanwhile, there were ''[[Cheque and Credit Clearing Company|Bank Giro Credits]]'', which were instructions to credit a particular bank account: these were not instructions to debit another account, so they had to be accompanied with cash or cheques, and they could be used both for bill payments and as paying-in slips; when used for paying bills they were often free-of-charge to the payer when used at the payer's or payee's bank but with an administration charge at other banks.

The use of cheques and paper giros is now in decline in many countries&lt;ref&gt;Federal Reserve: Recent payment trends in the United States, 2008. "In 2003 the number of electronic payments in the US exceeded the number of cheque payments for the first time [http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2008/pdf/payments08.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; in favour of electronic payments, which are thought to be faster, cheaper and safer due to the reduced risk of fraud.

The word '''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Giro'''' is also used in '''Investment Giro''', where 'Giro' is used for a non-bank, administrative account on which investments and transactions are registered.

The word Giro in this context has its origine in the Netherlands. Giro is used in names like: Investment Giro, Investor Giro, Securities Giro, and in Dutch for [[:nl:Beleggersgiro|Beleggers giro]], Beleggingsgiro and is used as synonymous for Investments or Investors administrations,Transfer Agents Services or for the Dutch 'Bewaarinstelling'.

==Etymology==
{{Wiktionary|giro}}
The word "giro" is borrowed from [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''"giro"'' and/or [[German language|German]] ''"giro"'', which are both from [[Italian language|Italian]] "giro" meaning "circulation of money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/78501|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian term comes via [[Latin]] "gyrus" meaning "gyre"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/giro|title=Definition of GIRO|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the Greek "gyros" meaning "circle".&lt;ref&gt;Glyn Davies, ''National Giro''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and concept==
Giro systems date back at least to [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] in the 4th century BC. State granary deposits functioned as an early banking system, in which giro payments were accepted, with a central bank in [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ex.ac.uk/~RDavies/arian/amser/chrono1.html A Comparative Chronology of Money], Roy Davies &amp; Glyn Davies, 1996 &amp;  1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Giro was a common method of [[payment|money transfer]] in [[History of banking|early banking]].

The first occurrences of book money are not known exactly. The giro system itself can be traced back to the "bancherii" in Northern Italy, especially on the [[Rialto]] (a financial center, resembling the modern day Wall Street). Originally these were [[money changer]]s sitting at their desk ("bancus" = bench) that customers could turn to. They offered an additional service to keep the money and to allow direct transfer from one money store to another by checking the accounts in their storage books. Literally they opened one book, withdrew an amount, opened another book where the amount was added. This handling was naturally a very regional system but it allowed the money to circulate in the books. This led finally to the foundation of the "Banco del Giro" in 1619&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terra-x.zdf.de/ZDFde/inhalt/28/0,1872,2112636,00.html|title=Terra X - ZDF.de|first=Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen|last=(ZDF)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in [[Venetian language]], Banco del Ziro) which gave the blueprint for similar banking systems. The usage in German language can be seen in the Banco del Giro founded in Vienna in 1703 (to extend the financing business that [[Samuel Oppenheimer]] had brought from Venice in 1670).

Postal giro or postgiro systems have a long history in European financial services. The basic concept is that of a banking system not based on cheques, but rather by direct transfer between accounts.  If the accounting office is [[centralised]], then transfers between accounts can happen simultaneously. Money could be paid in or withdrawn from the system at any post office, and later connections to the commercial banking systems were established, often simply by the local bank opening its own postgiro account.

By the middle of the 20th century, most countries in continental Europe had a postal giro service. The first postgiro system was established in [[Austria]] on the early 19th century. By the time the British postgiro was conceived, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] postgiro was very well established with virtually every adult having a postgiro account, and very large and well used postgiro operations in most other countries in Europe. Banks also adopted the giro as a method of direct payment from remitter to receiver.

The term "[[bank]]" was not used initially to describe the service. The banks' main payment instrument was based on the cheque which has a totally different [[Giro#Model|remittance model]] than that of a giro.

==Model==

In the '''''banking model''''', '''cheques''' are written by the paying party and then handed or mailed to the payee, who must then visit a bank or mail the cheque to his or her bank. The cheque must then be [[Clearing (finance)|cleared]], a complex process by which cheques are sorted once, mailed to a central clearing location, sorted again, and then mailed back to the paying branch, which verifies that the funds are available and pays the payee's bank.

In the '''''postal giro model''''', the paying party sends a request to pay the payee (called a '''giro transfer''') to the giro centre, which verifies that the funds are available, debits the payer's accounts by the amount requested, and credits that amount to the payee's account. The giro centre then sends the giro transfer document to the recipient, and an updated account statement to both the payer and payee. In the case of large [[Public utility|utilities]] receiving thousands of payments per day, statements are sent electronically and incorporate a unique reference number for each payment for [[wiktionary:reconciliation|reconciliation]] purposes.

In the United States, the rise of [[Check 21 Act|electronic cheque clearing]] (and [[debit card]]s as preferred instruments of payment) has made this difference less important than it once was. In some stores in the [[United States]] checks are scanned at the cash register and handed back to the customer. The scanned information is forwarded to a payment processor, which transfers the money using the [[ACH Network]].

Unlike the banking model, the postal giro model allows an individual to transfer money directly into another individual's bank account, provided the sender has the recipient's account details. The recipient is not required to approve or acknowledge the transfer or visit the bank to claim it. As a result, cheques are rarely used in countries with extensive giro networks, such as Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and the Nordic countries.

Direct deposit systems such as those in common use in North America, by contrast, require the recipient's explicit approval, typically provided by filling out a form. Transferring funds from one personal bank account to another typically requires either a physical check or a [[wire transfer]], which may incur a significant fee and require the paying party to visit the bank.

The credit risk with respect to the actual transfer of physical currency is assumed by the giro operators, such as banks, as interbank credit risk. For the payer and payee, giro does not involve credit, unlike cheques or credit cards. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage. The creditworthiness of the payer doesn't need to be evaluated, as he can initiate the transaction only if he already has sufficient funds. As such, the payer doesn't have the benefit of paying on credit. However, the disadvantage is that the transactions are unsecured. The payer lacks the sort of protections against dishonest payees that come with credit cards. Transactions cannot be recalled or disputed after the fact. Thus, committing fraud in e.g. interpersonal trade is relatively easy, and giro payments should be only made to known and trusted payees. Also, even though intra-bank transfer can be quick, interbank transfers can take several days, and they are often executed only on [[business day]]s.

==Electronic bill payment==
Modern [[electronic bill payment]] is similar to the use of giro.

Advantages include:
* Instant access to the funds via an [[automatic teller machine|ATM]], [[debit card]] or [[cheque card]].
* There is no paper cheque that can be lost, stolen, or forgotten.
* Payments made electronically can be less expensive to the payer; typically electronic payments may cost around 25¢ (US) whereas it could cost up to $2 (US) to generate, print and mail a paper cheque. Banks may not even charge for the service at all; for example many banks in the [[European Union]] charge nothing for electronic payments inside the SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area), provided the proper [[ISO 9362|BIC]] and [[International Bank Account Number|IBAN]] account numbers are used.
* The payment error rates and subsequent reconciliation issues are significantly reduced.

In the [[United States]], the [[ACH Network]], regulated by [[NACHA]] and the [[Federal Reserve Bank]], handles all interbank transfers, including [[direct deposit]] and [[direct debit]].

In entirely electronic bill payment, the payer receives a bill — either physically by mail or electronically from a website ([[electronic billing]]). Then, the payer reads in the information from the bill, either manually or by using the barcode on the bill (ex: [[EPC QR code|EPC QR Code]] in the [[European Union]]), enters it to the form on the bank website, and submits the form. The payment is immediately deducted from the account balance.

==Cultural significance==
Before the use of electronic transfers of payments became the norm in the [[United Kingdom]] the [[fortnight]]ly "giro" payment was the normal way of distributing [[Jobseekers Allowance|benefit]] payments. When unemployment peaked in the 1980s, large numbers of people would receive their benefit payment on the same day leading the concept of ''Giro Day'', marked by the settlement of small debts and a noticeable increase in drinking, partying, and festive activities. It is the focus of the 1996 film ''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0496587/combined Waiting for Giro]''.

Halliburton's major business segment is the Energy Services Group (ESG). It offers a broad array of products and services to upstream oil and gas customers worldwide through fourteen product service lines: Artificial Lift, Cementing, Completion Tools, Multi-Chem, Pipeline &amp; Process Services, Production Enhancement, Production Solutions, Baroid, Drill Bits &amp; Services, Landmark Software &amp; Services, Sperry Drilling, Testing &amp; Subsea, Wireline &amp; Perforating, and Consulting &amp; Project Management. Halliburton's former subsidiary, [[Kellogg, Brown and Root|KBR]], is a major construction company of [[Oil refinery|refineries]], oil fields, [[pipeline transport|pipelines]], and [[chemical plant]]s. Halliburton announced on April 5, 2007 that it had sold the division and severed its corporate relationship with KBR, which had been its contracting, engineering and construction unit as a part of the company.&lt;ref name=separation&gt;[https://www.halliburton.com/default/main/halliburton/eng/news/source_files/news.jsp?newsurl=/default/main/halliburton/eng/news/source_files/press_release/2007/corpnws_040507a.html ''"Halliburton Completes Separation of KBR"''] - 2007 Press Releases - Halliburton.com - April 5, 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829044401/http://www.halliburton.com/default/main/halliburton/eng/news/source_files/news.jsp?newsurl=/default/main/halliburton/eng/news/source_files/press_release/2007/corpnws_040507a.html |date=August 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company has been involved in numerous controversies, including the [[Deepwater Horizon explosion]], for which it agreed to settle outstanding legal claims against it by paying litigants $1.1 billion.

KBR, one of Halliburton's subsidiaries at the time, paid bribes to high-ranking Nigerian officials between 1994 and 2004. Under a deal reached with the U.S. Justice Department, Halliburton has agreed to pay $382 million to settle the bribery case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-kbr-bribes/kbr-pleads-guilty-in-nigerian-bribery-case-idUSTRE51A6M720090211 | title=KBR pleads guilty in Nigerian bribery case

=== Divisions ===
Energy services (the company's historical cornerstone), [[formation evaluation]], digital and consulting solutions, production volume optimization, and fluid systems are the major business segments. These businesses continue to be profitable, and the company is one of the world's largest players in these service industries; it is second after [[Schlumberger Limited|Schlumberger]], and is followed by [[Saipem]], [[Weatherford International]], and [[Baker Hughes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoovers.com/free/co/burn.xhtml?ID=10697 |title=Halliburton competitors |publisher=Hoovers.com |date= |accessdate=December 19, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929032948/http://www.hoovers.com/free/co/burn.xhtml?ID=10697 |archivedate=September 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the acquisition of [[Dresser Industries]] in 1998, the [[KBR (company)|Kellogg-Brown &amp; Root]] division (in 2002 renamed to KBR) was formed by [[merger|merging]] Halliburton's Brown &amp; Root (acquired 1962) subsidiary and the M.W. Kellogg division of Dresser (which Dresser had merged with in 1988). KBR is a major international construction company that works in an industry that tends to have an element of volatility and is subject to significant fluctuations in revenue and [[profit (accounting)|profit]]. [[Asbestos]]-related litigation from Kellogg acquisition caused the company to book more than [[United States dollar|US$]]4.0&amp;nbsp;billion in losses from 2002 through 2004.

As a result of the asbestos-related costs and staggering losses on the Barracuda Caratinga FPSO construction project based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Halliburton lost approximately $900&amp;nbsp;million [[U.S. dollar|U.S.]] a year from 2002 through 2004. A final non-appealable settlement in the asbestos case was reached in January 2005 which allowed Halliburton subsidiary KBR to exit Chapter 11 bankruptcy and returned the company to quarterly profitability. While Halliburton's revenues have increased because of its contracts in the Middle East, the overall impact on its bottom line has been mixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.halliburtonwatch.org/news/kbr_sale.html |title=Halliburton may sell KBR to end public relations nightmare |publisher=Halliburtonwatch.org |date=September 24, 2004 |accessdate=December 19, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123102200/http://halliburtonwatch.org/news/kbr_sale.html |archivedate=November 23, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meeting for investors and analysts in August 2004, a plan was outlined to divest the KBR division through a possible [[Sales|sale]], [[Corporate spin-off|spin-off]] or [[initial public offering]]. Analysts at [[Deutsche Bank]] valued KBR at up to $2.15&amp;nbsp;billion, while others believed it could be worth closer to $3&amp;nbsp;billion by 2005. KBR became a separately listed company on April 5, 2007.&lt;ref name=separation/&gt;

== History ==

=== Early history (as HOWCO) ===
In 1919, [[Erle P. Halliburton]] started the New Method Oil Well Cementing Company.&lt;ref name="Yahoo_Hal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=HAL|title=Halliburton Profile in Yahoo Finance|publisher=Yahoo Finance|date=|accessdate=October 16, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107234423/http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=hal|archivedate=November 7, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, he brought a wild gas well under control, using cement, for W.G. Skelly, near [[Wilson, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name=EPMag&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epmag.com/archives/oilFieldHistory/407.htm |title=EP Magazine: Cementing is not for sissies; E&amp;P Magazine |publisher=EPMag.com |date=May 25, 2007 |accessdate=October 16, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007014145/http://www.epmag.com/archives/oilFieldHistory/407.htm |archivedate=October 7, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 1, 1921, the Halliburton "method and means of excluding water from oil wells" was assigned a patent from the [[U.S. Patent Office]]. Halliburton invented the revolutionary cement jet mixer, to eliminate hand-mixing of cement, and the measuring line, a tool used to guarantee cementing accuracy.&lt;ref name=EPMag/&gt; By 1922, the Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Company (HOWCO) was prospering from the [[Mexia, Texas]] oil boom, having cemented its 500th well in late summer.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend&gt;{{cite book | last=Rodengen | first=Jeffrey | authorlink=| title=The Legend of Halliburton | location=USA | year=1996 | isbn=978-0-945903-16-1 | publisher=Write Stuff Syndicate }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, the company was incorporated in [[Delaware]], with 56 people on its payroll. The stock of the corporation was owned by Erle and [[Vida Halliburton]] and by seven major oil companies: Magnolia, Texas, Gulf, Humble, Sun, Pure and Atlantic.&lt;ref name=TSHA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/doh08 |title=The Handbook of Texas Online; TSHA Online |publisher=TSHA.com |accessdate=October 16, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617141515/http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/doh08 |archivedate=June 17, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, its first foreign venture began with sale of equipment to [[Burma]] and India.&lt;ref name=Egypt_Oil&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptoil-gas.com/read_article_issues.php?MID=21&amp;arch=true&amp;AID=28|title=Halliburton: The legacy of Erle; Egypt Oil &amp; Gas|publisher=egyptoil-gas.com|date=February 2007|accessdate=October 16, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223085841/http://www.egyptoil-gas.com/read_article_issues.php?MID=21&amp;arch=true&amp;AID=28|archivedate=December 23, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Halliburton continued cementing across America.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAPG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.datapages.com/data/bulletns/1931-37/data/pg/0021/0004/0500/0500.htm |title=Cunningham Field, Kingman and Pratt Counties, Kansas; Bulletin of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists |publisher=American Association of Petroleum Geologists |year=1937 |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, Halliburton cemented its first offshore well using a truck on a barge off the Louisiana coast.&lt;ref name=Egypt_Oil/&gt; In 1940, Halliburton opened offices in Venezuela and introduced bulk handling of cementing to the industry.&lt;ref name=TSHA/&gt; In 1947, the Halliburton first marine cementing vessel went into service.&lt;ref name=EPMag/&gt;

In 1951, Halliburton first appeared in Europe as Halliburton Italiana SpA, a wholly owned subsidiary in Italy. Over the next seven years, Halliburton launched Halliburton Company Germany GmbH, set up operations in Argentina and established a subsidiary in England. By 1951, HOWCO had service centers operating in Canada, Venezuela, Peru, Colombia, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt; Halliburton revenues topped $100&amp;nbsp;million for the first time in 1952.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt;

Erle P. Halliburton died in [[Los Angeles]] in 1957. HOWCO is at this time worth $190&amp;nbsp;million with camps all over the world. The same year, HOWCO purchased Welex, which pioneered jet perforation.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt; [[Otis Engineering]], an oil field service and equipment company specializing in manufacturing pressure control equipment for oil and gas producing wells, was acquired in 1959.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt;

=== As Halliburton ===
On July 5, 1961, the company changed its name to the Halliburton Company. In 1963, Halliburton was the first company in Oklahoma to receive the Presidential "E" for Export flag in recognition of notable contributions to foreign trade.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt;

Halliburton opened a {{convert|500000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} manufacturing center in Duncan, Oklahoma, in 1964.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt; The company began to experiment with new technologies to help their services – for example, beginning in 1965 a pilot operation of a computer network system – the first such installation in the oilfield services industry.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt; In 1966, workers broke ground for a new wing at the Research Center in Duncan that tripled the available space for the Chemical Research and Design Department.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt;

In 1968, an automated mixing system for drilling mud was developed by Halliburton, primarily for use offshore.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt; [[Gearhart Industries]] (acquired by Halliburton Energy Services in 1989) introduced the first digital computer logging system in 1974.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt;

In 1969, Halliburton began construction of a base camp at [[Prudhoe Bay]] on [[Alaska]]'s North Slope.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt;

In 1975, it responded to environmental concerns by working with the nonprofit Clean Gulf Associates to contain and clean up oil spills.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt; In 1976, Halliburton established the Halliburton Energy Institute in Duncan, Oklahoma, to provide an industry forum for disseminating technical information.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt;

[[File:Lincoln Plaza.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lincoln Plaza (Dallas, Texas)|Lincoln Plaza]] in [[Downtown Dallas]], which at one time housed the Halliburton headquarters]]
In 1980, Halliburton Research Center opened in Duncan, Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt; The company's billionth sack of cement for customers was pumped in 1983.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt; In 1989, Halliburton acquired logging and perforating specialist company [[Gearhart Industries]] and combined it with its subsidiary [[Welex]] to form [[Halliburton Logging Services]].

Throughout the 1980s, Halliburton's subsidiaries continued their projects around the world (under management of former CEO Brian Darcy) even in countries once considered enemies. Equipment was provided for the first multiwell platform offshore [[China]], and an Otis Engineering team controlled a gigantic Tengiz field blowout in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt;

=== 1990s ===
Following the end of [[Operation Desert Storm]] in February 1991, [[the Pentagon]], led by then defense secretary [[Richard Cheney|Dick Cheney]], paid Halliburton subsidiary Brown &amp; Root Services over $8.5&amp;nbsp;million to study the use of private military forces with American soldiers in combat zones.&lt;ref name="Soldiers of Good Fortune"&gt;{{cite news|last=Yeoman|first=Barry|title=Soldiers of Good Fortune| work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]

In 1995, Cheney replaced [[Thomas H. Cruikshank]], as [[chairman]] and [[CEO]]. Cruikshank had served since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/07/business/the-right-choice-for-the-job.html?pagewanted=all |title=The Right Choice for the Job? | work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 7, 1995 |accessdate= |first=Judith H. |last=Dobrzynski |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105030109/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/07/business/the-right-choice-for-the-job.html?pagewanted=all |archivedate=January 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, Halliburton was found to be in violation of federal trade barriers in Iraq and Libya, having sold these countries [[dual-use technology|dual-use]] oil drilling equipment and, through its former subsidiary, Halliburton Logging Services, sending six [[pulse neutron generator]]s to Libya. After having plead guilty, the company was fined $1.2&amp;nbsp;million, with another $2.61&amp;nbsp;million in penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/government/government-bodies-offices/7148553-1.html|title=HALLIBURTON ANNOUNCES AGREEMENTS TO SETTLE EXPORT INVESTIGATION. &amp;#124; Government &gt; Government Bodies &amp; Offices from AllBusiness.com|publisher=AllBusiness.com|date=|accessdate=September 5, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091220060022/http://www.allbusiness.com/government/government-bodies-offices/7148553-1.html|archivedate=December 20, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Balkans]] conflict in the 1990s, Kellogg Brown-Root (KBR) supported U.S. peacekeeping forces in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]] and [[Hungary]] with food, laundry, transportation, and other life-cycle management services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/13/business/13HALL.html |title=Halliburton's KBR defence contracts | work=[[The New York Times]] |date=17 June 2002 |accessdate=October 5, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011223555/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/13/business/13HALL.html |archivedate=October 11, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Halliburton merged with Dresser Industries, which included Kellogg. [[Prescott Bush]] was a director of Dresser Industries, which is now part of Halliburton; his son, former president [[George H. W. Bush]], worked for Dresser Industries in several positions from 1948 to 1951, before he founded [[Zapata Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.famoustexans.com/georgebush.htm |title=George Bush |publisher=Famoustexans.com |date= |accessdate=December 19, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122203533/http://famoustexans.com/georgebush.htm |archivedate=November 22, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000s ===
[[File:5HoustonCenter.JPG|thumb|[[5 Houston Center]] in [[Downtown Houston]], which at one time housed the headquarters of Halliburton]]
''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported in 2001 that a subsidiary of Halliburton Energy Services called Halliburton Products and Services Ltd. (HPS) opened an office in [[Tehran]]. The company, HPS, operated on the ninth floor of a new north Tehran tower block. Although HPS was incorporated in the [[Cayman Islands]] in 1975 and is "non-American", it shares both the logo and name of Halliburton Energy Services and, according to [[Dow Jones Newswires]], offers services from Halliburton units worldwide through its Tehran office. Such behavior, undertaken while Cheney was CEO of Halliburton, may have violated the [[Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917|Trading with the Enemy Act]]. A Halliburton spokesman, responding to inquiries from [[Dow Jones]], said "This is not breaking any laws. This is a foreign subsidiary and no U.S. person is involved in this. No U.S. person is facilitating any transaction. We are not performing directly in that country." Later David Lesar would book his own flights to the Tehran office through the UK arm of KBR. No legal action has been taken against the company or its officials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/linkscopy/HCtOiI.html Halliburton Connected to Office in Iran, Dow Jones, 2/1/01] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304093739/http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/linkscopy/HCtOiI.html |date=March 4, 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2002, KBR was awarded a $7&amp;nbsp;million contract to construct steel holding cells at [[Camp X-Ray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=—By Nicholas M. Horrock and Anwar Iqbal |url=https://www.motherjones.com/news/outfront/2004/01/12_400.html |title=Waiting for Gitmo |work=Motherjones.com |date= |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028164725/https://www.motherjones.com/news/outfront/2004/01/12_400.html |archivedate=October 28, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2002, KBR was tasked to plan oil well firefighting in Iraq, and in February 2003 was issued a contract to conduct the work. Critics contend that it was a [[no-bid contract]], awarded due to Dick Cheney's position as vice president. Concern was also expressed that the contract could allow KBR to pump and distribute Iraqi oil.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3006149.stm|title=Halliburton's Iraq role expands|publisher=BBC News|date=May 7, 2003|accessdate=April 28, 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525072149/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3006149.stm|archivedate=May 25, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others contend, however, that this was not strictly a ''no-bid contract,'' and was invoked under a contract that KBR won "in a competitive bid process."&lt;ref name=york&gt;{{cite journal|last=York|first=Byron|date=July 14, 2003|title=Halliburton: The Bush/Iraq Scandal that Wasn't | journal=[[National Review]] | url=http://www.nationalreview.com/york/york070903.asp|accessdate=April 28, 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628170445/http://www.nationalreview.com/york/york070903.asp|archivedate=June 28, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract, referred to as LOGCAP, is a contingency-based contract that is invoked at the convenience of the Army. Because the contract is essentially a retainer, specific orders are not competitively bid (as the overall contract was).

On January 24, 2006, Halliburton's subsidiary KBR (formerly Kellogg, Brown and Root) announced that it had been awarded a $385&amp;nbsp;million contingency contract by the [[Department of Homeland Security]] to build "temporary detention and processing facilities" or [[internment]] camps. According to ''[[Business Wire]]'', this contract will be executed in cooperation with the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], [[Fort Worth]] District. Critics point to the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] as a possible model. According to a press release posted on the Halliburton website, "The contract, which is effective immediately, provides for establishing temporary detention and processing capabilities to augment existing [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) Detention and Removal Operations (DRO) Program facilities in the event of an emergency influx of immigrants into the U.S., or to support the rapid development of new programs. The contingency support contract provides for planning and, if required, initiation of specific engineering, construction and logistics support tasks to establish, operate and maintain one or more expansion facilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.halliburton.com/public/news/pubsdata/press_release/2006/kbrnws_012406.html |title=KBR AWARDED U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY CONTINGENCY SUPPORT PROJECT FOR EMERGENCY SUPPORT SERVICES |publisher=Halliburton.com |date=January 24, 2006 |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110111443/http://www.halliburton.com/public/news/pubsdata/press_release/2006/kbrnws_012406.html |archivedate=January 10, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, a hard disk and two computers containing classified information were stolen from Petrobras while in Halliburton's custody. Allegedly, the content inside the stolen material was data on the recently discovered [[Tupi oil field]]. Initial police inquiries suggest that it could be a common container theft operation. The container was a ramshackle in complete disorder indicating that thieves were after "valuables and not only laptops," said an expert consulted by the daily newspaper Folha de S.

On May 14, 2010, President [[Barack Obama]] said in an interview with [[CNN]] that "you had executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else" when referring to the congressional hearings held during the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]]. "The American people could not have been impressed with that display, and I certainly wasn't." According to Tim Probert, executive vice president of Halliburton, "Halliburton, as a service provider to the well owner, is contractually bound to comply with the well owner's instructions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/nbr/site/onair/transcripts/gulf_oil_disaster_blame_100512/ |title=The Gulf Oil Disaster Blame Game |publisher=PBS.org |date= |accessdate=June 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415212141/http://www.pbs.org/nbr/site/onair/transcripts/gulf_oil_disaster_blame_100512/ |archivedate=April 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans called for more oil to be exported from Iraq's northern oil fields than actually occurred. Halliburton's work on the pipeline crossing the [[Tigris]] river at [[Al Fatah]] has been called a failure. Critics claim that the oil fields are barely usable and access to international markets is severely limited. As an example, against the advice of its own experts, Halliburton attempted to dig a tunnel through a geological [[fault zone]]. The underground terrain was a jumble of boulders, voids, cobblestones, and gravel and not appropriate for the kind of drilling Halliburton planned. "No driller in his right mind would have gone ahead," said Army geologist Robert Sanders when the military finally sent people to inspect the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/25/world/middleeast/25pipeline.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;n=Top/News/World/Countries%20and%20Territories/Iraq&amp;oref=slogin|title=Rebuilding of Iraqi pipeline as disaster waiting to happen|author=James Glanz|date=April 25, 2006|accessdate=December 1, 2007|work=[[The New York Times]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530152002/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/25/world/middleeast/25pipeline.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;n=Top%2FNews%2FWorld%2FCountries%20and%20Territories%2FIraq&amp;oref=slogin|archivedate=May 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proposed acquisition of Baker Hughes ===
On November 17, 2014 Halliburton and [[Baker Hughes]] jointly announced a definitive agreement under which Halliburton will, subject to the conditions set forth in the agreement, acquire Baker Hughes in a stock and cash transaction valued at $34.6 billion. A press release made available on the former's website, as at December 11, 2014 detailed the restructuring in the integration to follow. The firm announced it would acquire [[Baker Hughes]] for around $35 billion in cash and stock, creating an oilfield services company that aims to compete with [[Schlumberger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| agency=[[Reuters]]| date=17 November 2014| title=Halliburton to buy Baker Hughes for about $35 billion| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/17/us-bakerhughes-offer-idUSKCN0J116520141117| deadurl=no| archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170703191542/https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/17/us-bakerhughes-offer-idUSKCN0J116520141117| archivedate=July 3, 2017| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the merger of Baker Hughes and Halliburton, Halliburton must divest over $5 billion of its assets according to the regulations created by US competition enforcement authorities.&lt;ref name=Divestiture2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Halliburton and Baker Hughes Announce Additional Divestiture Proposals|url=https://www.halliburton.com/en-US/news/hal-divestitures.page|website=Halliburton dot com|accessdate=27 October 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011125056/http://www.halliburton.com/en-US/news/hal-divestitures.page|archivedate=October 11, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The merger had a deadline of the end of April 2016 after which, if a decision had not been made, both companies could walk away from the deal if they chose.

== Controversies ==
Halliburton has become the object of several controversies involving the [[Iraq War]] and the company's ties to former U.S. Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]. Cheney retired from the company during the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. presidential election]] campaign with a severance package worth $36&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,1150320,00.html |title=Halliburton suspends bill for army meals |work=The Guardian|date=February 18, 2004|accessdate=September 5, 2009 |location=London |first=David |last=Teather}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2004, he had received $398,548 in [[deferred compensation]] from Halliburton while Vice President.&lt;ref name="factcheck-cheney"&gt;{{cite web|date=September 30, 2004 |url=http://www.factcheck.org/article261.html |title=Kerry Ad Falsely Accuses Cheney on Halliburton |publisher=FactCheck.org |accessdate=April 11, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060409195039/http://www.factcheck.org/article261.html |archivedate=April 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cheney was chairman and CEO of Halliburton Company from 1995 to 2000 and has received stock options from Halliburton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/26/politics/main575356.shtml?tag=untagged |title=Cheney's Halliburton Ties Remain |publisher=CBS News |date= September 26, 2003|accessdate=September 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the run-up to the Iraq War, Halliburton was awarded a $7&amp;nbsp;billion contract for which only Halliburton was allowed to bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7444083.stm |title=BBC uncovers lost Iraq billions |publisher=BBC |date=June 10, 2008 |accessdate=January 7, 2011 |first=Jane |last=Corbin |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604165714/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7444083.stm |archivedate=June 4, 2009 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under U.S. law, the government uses single-bid contracts for a number of reasons, to include when in the view of the government, only one organization is capable of fulfilling the requirement.

[[Bunnatine Greenhouse]], a civil servant with 20 years of contracting experience, had complained to Army officials on numerous occasions that Halliburton had been unlawfully receiving special treatment for work in Iraq, Kuwait and the Balkans. Criminal investigations were opened by the U.S. Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation ([[FBI]]) and the Pentagon's inspector general. These investigations found no wrongdoing within the contract award and execution process.

In one of Greenhouse's claims, she said that military auditors caught Halliburton overcharging the Pentagon for fuel deliveries into Iraq. She also complained that Defense Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]]'s office took control of every aspect of Halliburton's $7&amp;nbsp;billion Iraqi oil/infrastructure contract. Greenhouse was later demoted for poor performance in her position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/29/international/middleeast/29halliburton.html |title=Army Contract Official Critical of Halliburton Pact Is Demoted |work=The New York Times |date=August 29, 2005 |accessdate=August 29, 2005 |first=Erik |last=Eckholm |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110731165249/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/29/international/middleeast/29halliburton.html |archivedate=July 31, 2011 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenhouse's attorney, Michael Kohn portrayed her performance reviews as punishment for criticizing the administrations, he  stated in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that "she is being demoted because of her strict adherence to procurement requirements and the Army's preference to sidestep them when it suits their needs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E3DE1631F93AA1575BC0A9639C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times |title=REACH OF WAR: PROCUREMENT; Army Contract Official Critical of Halliburton Pact Is Demoted |author=Erik Eckholm |date=August 29, 2005 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305100009/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E3DE1631F93AA1575BC0A9639C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |archivedate=March 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deepwater Horizon explosion ===
On September 8, 2010, an internal report released by [[BP]] into the [[Deepwater Horizon explosion]] claimed that poor practices of Halliburton staff had contributed to the disaster. Investigations carried out by the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling found that Halliburton was jointly at fault along with BP and Transocean for the spill. The concrete that Halliburton used was an unstable mixture, and eventually caused hydrocarbons to leak into the well, causing the explosion that started the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oilspillcommission.gov/sites/default/files/documents/FinalReportIntro.pdf |title=Deepwater Horizon Accident Investigation Report |publisher=BP |date=September 8, 2010 |accessdate=September 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014062917/http://www.oilspillcommission.gov/sites/default/files/documents/FinalReportIntro.pdf |archivedate=October 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halliburton pleaded guilty to destroying evidence after the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster; the company destroyed computer simulations it performed in the months after the accident, simulations that contradicted Halliburton's claim that it was BP who had not followed Halliburton's advice. BP had employed Halliburton to oversee the process by which cement is used to seal pipes in oil and gas wells, thereby preventing leaks. Government investigators had ordered companies involved in drilling the well to preserve all relevant evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324564704578628472663785926 |work=The Wall Street Journal |title=Halliburton to Plead Guilty to Destroying Deepwater Horizon Evidence - WSJ.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313153759/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324564704578628472663785926 |archivedate=March 13, 2018 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental issues ===
In 2002, Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) reports were completed to measure the amount of chemicals emitted from Halliburton's [[Harris County, Texas]] facility. The TRI is a publicly available EPA database that contains information on toxic chemical releases and waste management activities reported annually by certain industries as well as federal facilities. The facility had 230 TRI air releases in 2001 and 245 in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scorecard.org/env-releases/facility.tcl?tri_id=77032HGHSD15815#major_chemical_releases Environmental Release Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803141213/http://www.scorecard.org/env-releases/facility.tcl?tri_id=77032HGHSD15815 |date=August 3, 2008 }} - Scorecard&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 15, 2006, Halliburton filed a registration statement with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] to sell up to 20 percent of its KBR stock on the [[NYSE]] under the ticker symbol "KBR", as part of an eventual plan for KBR to be a separate company from Halliburton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.corporate-ir.net/library/67/676/67605/items/199968/KBR_S1.pdf|title=Amendment No. 5 to FORM S-1 REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 - KBR, Inc.|author=|date=|website=corporate-ir.net|accessdate=May 8, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002020054/http://library.corporate-ir.net/library/67/676/67605/items/199968/KBR_S1.pdf|archivedate=October 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, Halliburton began selling its stake in KBR, its major subsidiary, and by February 2007 had completely sold off the subsidiary. In June 2007, several days after Stewart Bowen, the Special Inspector General, released a new report, the Army announced that KBR would share another $150&amp;nbsp;billion contract with two other contractors, [[Fluor Corporation|Fluor]] and [[Dyncorp]], over the next 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSN2833255320070629 |title=KBR, Fluor, Dyncorp win US Army contract, shrs up &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Reuters&lt;! |date=June 28, 2007 |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110190237/http://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSN2833255320070629 |archivedate=January 10, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Baghdad incident ===
In accordance with the [[law of armed conflict]] and to maintain [[non-combatant]] status, Halliburton does not arm its truck drivers. Trucks are often the target of [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|insurgent]] attacks. On September 20, 2005, a convoy of four Halliburton trucks was ambushed north of Baghdad. All four trucks were struck by [[improvised explosive device]]s and were disabled. Their US [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] escort was thought to have abandoned the disabled vehicles, leaving the drivers defenseless. Three of the four truck drivers were killed by the insurgents while the surviving driver caught the event on video. Although the trucks had military camouflage paint, the drivers were civilian. The US military returned to the scene 45&amp;nbsp;minutes later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brian Ross and Rhonda Schwartz Report: |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2006/09/exclusive_us_tr.html |title=The Blotter: Exclusive: U.S. Troops Abandoned Me, Says Convoy Driver |publisher=Blogs.abcnews.com |date=September 27, 2006 |accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a statement by senior military officials in Iraq, an investigation revealed that troops did not abandon the civilians and they were all exiting the "kill zone" during the ambush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://209.157.64.201/focus/f-news/1711404/posts | title=Leaders: reports 'false, inaccurate' | date=September 30, 2006 | accessdate=July 26, 2013 | publisher=Free Republic (originally by [[Multi-National Force – Iraq]]) | deadurl=no | archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130728220849/http://209.157.64.201/focus/f-news/1711404/posts | archivedate=July 28, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnf-iraq.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6056&amp;Itemid=18 |title=Multi-National Force - Iraq - Leaders: reports 'false, inaccurate' |publisher=Mnf-iraq.com |date=September 30, 2006 |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810193412/http://www.mnf-iraq.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6056&amp;Itemid=18 |archivedate=August 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Restatements ===
On March 31, 2003, Management at Halliburton restated earnings downward by $14 million for the fourth quarter of 2002. In the restatement, an additional $3 million expense (net of tax) to continuing operations and an $11 million expense, net of tax, to discontinued operations were recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3008862/2/c_3043233 |title=Newmont, Halliburton to Restate Results |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051204204937/http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3008862/2/c_3043233 |archivedate=December 4, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2, 2005, Halliburton restated its 2004 fourth-quarter earnings to add $2 million US in after-tax losses to reflect the collection of a $10 million receivable that had been reserved and a correction in lease accounting.

{{Globalize|date=May 2008}}
'''Hurricane engineering''' is a specialist sub-discipline of [[civil engineering]] that encompasses planning, analysis, design, response, and recovery of civil engineering systems and infrastructure for [[hurricane]] hazards.  Hurricane engineering is a relatively new and emerging discipline within the field of civil engineering.  It is an integration of many recognized branches of engineering, such as [[structural engineering]], [[wind engineering]], [[coastal engineering]], and [[forensic engineering]], with other recognized sciences and planning functions such as, [[climatology]], [[oceanography]], [[architecture]], [[emergency management]] and preparedness, hazard mitigation, and hazard vulnerability analysis.  Hurricane engineering aims to minimize risks to human safety, the natural and built environment, and business processes.

As a result of the tremendous threats to life safety and economic disruptions caused by the [[2004 Atlantic hurricane season|2004]] and [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005]] hurricane seasons, governmental organizations, such as the United States [[National Science Foundation]], have recognized the need to better understand hurricane threats and further establish this discipline.  In September 2006, the [[National Science Board]] released recommendations to the [[United States Congress]] calling for major new investments in hurricane science and engineering.

Accredited university engineering programs, such as the [[Louisiana State University]] civil engineering department and [[University of Notre Dame]] Department of Civil Engineering and Geological Sciences, are establishing programs to better understand these catastrophic storms and their interaction with the environment.  The LSU Hurricane Center has begun to offer hurricane engineering courses with the focus of educating students on the unique threats caused by hurricanes.

In the Northwest Pacific, where the term for strong tropical cyclones is '''Typhoon,''' instead of Hurricane, the concept of Typhoon Engineering, which is very similar to Hurricane Engineering, is being proposed.

The past two decades have witnessed exponential growth in damage due to hurricanes and the situation continues to deteriorate.  The most vulnerable areas, coastal counties along the Gulf and Atlantic seaboards, are experiencing greater population growth and development than anyplace else in the country.  If the trend of rapidly increasing losses caused by hurricanes is to be reversed, a whole new philosophy of understanding, planning, and preparedness is required.  The Hurricane Engineering curriculum is the result of a multidisciplinary project aimed at giving engineering students a comprehensive understanding of the hazards associated with hurricanes: 
*Extreme winds 
*Windborne debris 
*Storm surges
*River flooding 
*Rain-induced landslides

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8276">'''Industrial tourism''' is [[tourism]] in which the desired destination includes industrial sites peculiar to a particular location. The concept is not new, but has taken on renewed interest in recent times, with both [[industrial heritage]] sites and modern [[industry]] attracting [[tourism]].

== Attractiveness ==

Even if the concept is subjective, depending on a person's preferences, it has been noticed (through market researches) that people like to see and experience the present or historic (heritage) production processes of:

* goods with a symbolic character for a region (from [[coal]] and [[energy]] in [[Ruhr]], to bananas and [[coffee]] in [[Guatemala]]);
* branded, luxury goods like cars, watches and jewels;
* technologically demanding, innovative goods like computers and airplanes;
* handcrafted goods like [[porcelain]] and [[blacksmith]] products;
* drinks and foods.

An attractions directory &lt;ref name="Directory of Industrial and Creative Tourism Attractions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitfactories.com/attractions.php |title=Industrial and Creative Tourism Attractions |last=Hegedus |first=Marius |date=November 2014 |website=VisitFactories}}&lt;/ref&gt; for some Central SE European countries illustrates and includes this classification.

The attractiveness perception is also influenced by the cities' of destination ability to build touristic packages that reflect their industrial image and/or identity; respectively, in the case of tour operators, by mastering the industrial component in their attraction mix in the offered packages.

Presently, even on the mature markets, there are relatively few tour operators providing industrial [[tourism]] packages, completing other offers and almost always missing the specialized ones, as researched in a [[market study]] &lt;ref name="Industrial and Creative Tourism – A Comparative Analysis of Packaged Offers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitfactories.com/blog/?p=109 |title=Industrial and Creative Tourism – A Comparative Analysis of Packaged Offers |last=Hegedus |first=Marius |date=5 August 2014 |website=VisitFactories Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by one of the tour operators providing such specialized services.

== Destinations ==

The most obvious industrial tourism destinations are cities and regions with a solid industrial base. For them, industrial tourism is a potential growth sector that matches with their identity: the sector offers opportunities to strengthen their distinctiveness and image, notably by building onto their already existing assets.&lt;ref name="Industrial Tourism Development in Cities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashgate.com/pdf/SamplePages/Industrial_Tourism_Ch1.pdf |title=Industrial Tourism Development in Cities |first1=Alexander H.J. |last1=Otgaar |first2=Leo |last2=van den Berg |first3=Christian |last3=Berger |first4=Rachel Xiang |last4=Feng |date=June 2010 |publisher=Ashgate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, successful achievements are few and mostly in the developed countries (in Western Europe &lt;ref name="Rust is Beautiful: A Tour Through Seven of Europe's Awe-Inspiring Industrial Sites"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/european-route-of-industrial-heritage |title=Rust is Beautiful: A Tour Through Seven of Europe's Awe-Inspiring Industrial Sites |first1=Allison |last1=Meier |website=Atlas Obscura |date=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; - especially Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands; as well as in the USA and Japan) where a culture of [[leadership]] and collaboration between the different stakeholders at the community's governance level already exists. There is a positive trend and some remarkable achievements in [[Central Europe]] ([[Austria]], [[Hungary]],&lt;ref name="Industrial tourism - trends and opportunities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forumgeografic.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/1/Boros.pdf |title=Industrial tourism - trends and opportunities |website=Forum Geografic |date=21 June 2013 |first1=Lajos |last1=Boros |first2=Zita |last2=Martyn |first3=Viktor |last3=Pal}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Czech Republic]], [[Poland]]), [[China]] and [[India]] too.

Also, attention is being paid worldwide to reconvert economically collapsed mono industrial areas (especially [[mining]] and metallurgic ones) through industrial tourism: [[Krivoi Rog]], [[Reșița]] &lt;ref name="The role of industrial archaeology in conservation: The Reşiţa area of the Romanian Carpathians"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1021705414938#page-1|title=The role of industrial archaeology in conservation: The Reşiţa area of the Romanian Carpathians |journal=GeoJournal |first1=Nicolae |last1=Hillinger |first2=Martin |last2=Olaru |first3=David |last3=Turnock |date=December 2001 |doi=10.1023/A:1021705414938 |volume=54 |pages=607–630}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Petroșani]] &lt;ref name="Tourist Capitalization of Industrial Heritage Elements: A Strategic Direction of Sustainable Development. Case Study: The Petrosani Depression"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gtg.webhost.uoradea.ro/PDF/GTG-1-2010/7-GTG-Florina.pdf|title=Tourist Capitalization of Industrial Heritage Elements: A Strategic Direction of Sustainable Development. Case Study: The Petrosani Depression |publisher=GeoJournal |date=May 2010 |first1=Florentina-Cristina |last1= (Merciu) Iancu |first2=Ilinca-Valentina |last2=Stoica}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Important conditions for evaluating a destination's industrial tourism potential are:

* the quality of the location (local [[infrastructure]], [[service economy|services]], [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], other attractions, etc.);
* the accessibility of the attractions (the ease of reaching, the in situ visitor services, facilities or at least free access to and information about [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] objectives;  visitors centers or at least the possibility of scheduling individual guided tours at relevant  companies; qualified staff);
* the availability of information (public - private [[marketing]] cooperation).

== Particularities of the Demand ==

* the largest majority of industrial tourists are from mature outgoing markets ([[Germany]], [[Netherlands]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Japan]]);
* well travelled tourists, already saturated by the classic attractions (museums, churches) or second time visitors, shift from pleasure travel to in depth experience and education;
* increased curiosity about the manufacturing sector and industrial works from the younger generation for which, due to the new technologies and globalization, the domain is almost historic;
* active, elderly or retired workers and professionals driven by nostalgia and professional curiosity;
* local visitors, families with children;
* a combination with other attractions (cultural, natural);
* educational and business purpose (searching for work or business-to-business collaboration).

== International Associations, Organizations ==

Being a universal cultural asset, the industrial heritage and archeology gets a serious institutional (nonprofit), academic and governmental interest worldwide in the last decades, positively impacting its touristic potential too.

* The International Committee for the Conservation of the Industrial Heritage
* Society for Industrial Archeology
* The Association for Industrial Archaeology

'''Inq''' was a [[social software]] and [[Application software|app]] manufacturer who launched two successful software products and a series of award-winning handsets. Material, Inq's personalised magazine, became the top free news app in the UK App Store and achieved a number 4 position in the US, shortly after launch.&lt;ref name="appannie.com"&gt;[http://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/app/673115871/app-ranking/#daily=2014-01-16&amp;type=ranks Material: Tailored magazine featuring news, blogs &amp; RSS - Daily Ranks | App Annie]&lt;/ref&gt; SO.HO, a social launcher developed by Inq, was also warmly received with press positioning it as an alternative to [[Facebook Home]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://venturebeat.com/2013/04/19/why-settle-for-facebook-home-when-you-can-have-twitter-home-too/ Why settle for Facebook Home when you can have Twitter Home, too? | VentureBeat | Social | by John Koetsier]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to focusing on software, Inq released a series of "social mobiles" for which they were awarded "Best Newcomer" and "Best Handset" at the GSMA in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AXmyIh6GLc YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014 Inq announced that the business was to close down and that the apps they had in market would not be updated after this point.

==Company Overview==
Inq held offices in [[London]] and [[Rome]] and  employed between 11 and 50 staff across the two offices.

The company was founded in 2007 by Ken Johnstone (Inq's current CEO), Frank Meehan and Jeff Taylor. It is a fully owned subsidiary of [[Hutchison Whampoa]] and is backed by [[Li Ka-shing]] who is Chairman of Hutchison Whampoa and is also an investor in Facebook and Spotify.

==Inq Software and Apps==
Inq launched two software only products in 2013; Material a discovery app that delivered each of its users a personalised magazine based on their interests and SO.HO, a launcher and app that brought together Facebook, Twitter and Instagram in one place. Shortly after its release, the Material iOS app became a &lt;ref name = appannie&gt;[http://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/app/673115871/app-ranking/#daily=2014-01-16&amp;type=ranks App Annie Ranking] (Subscription Required)&lt;/ref&gt; and achieved a number 4 rank in the Free News chart in the US app store.&lt;ref name = appannie/&gt;
Inq describe their apps as social software and parts of the functionality are based on surfacing social networks or using elements from the social graph.

===Material===

Inq describe Material as a "personalised magazine" that "hunts out content based on your interests".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.materialapp.com Inq Mobile&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The app delivers a fresh update of content twice a day, grouping each delivery into a "morning/evening edition" The topics and stories in each edition are personalised to match the interests of each user and users can also add topics via a menu. The more a user uses Material, the more it learns about his or her interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.intomobile.com/2013/08/28/inqs-personalized-magazine-material-comes-iphone |title= Inq's personalized magazine Material comes to the iPhone|date = 28 April 2013|last = Belic|first = Dusan|website = IntoMobile}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users may also add additional topics of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.skyword.com/contentstandard/marketing/inq-mobiles-material-personalizes-content-based-on-social-dna/|title = Inq Mobile's MATERIAL Personalizes Content…|date = 26 February 2013|last = Karlson|first = Douglas|website = ContentStandard|publisher =skyword}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a press release regarding the product, CEO Ken Johnstone positioned Material as an anti-dote to content overload stating "With the avalanche of content out there, we're focused on finding new and exciting ways for people to get directly to the things they love. Material was the result of this thinking, an app that takes all the hard work out of finding great stuff.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.inqmobile.com/press/{{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Inq state that the discovery app will help users "discover new content from new places".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NA9uYz8kHQ YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Material is available for [[iPhone]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[smartphones]].

Inq released Material in BETA as an Android only product. The BETA app was praised by press for "its colorful and intelligent design" &lt;ref&gt;[https://venturebeat.com/2013/02/13/material-app-flipboard-grokr/ Inq's stunning Material app launches to take down Flipboard &amp; Grokr | VentureBeat | Mobile | by Sean Ludwig]&lt;/ref&gt; and UI. Similarly the Android public showed an interest in the app with the BETA achieving over 50,000 installs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/28/inq-material-ios/ INQ Extends Its Social Magazine App, Material, To iOS After 50,000+ Downloads On Android | TechCrunch]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014 Inq launched an iOS version of Material which had a redesigned UI and improvements to  Inq's “interest extraction engine,” which forms the intelligence behind the app. Shortly after its release, the Material iOS app became a number 1 app in the Free News category and achieved a rank of number 4 rank in the Free News chart in the US app store.&lt;ref name="appannie.com"/&gt;

The app has been compared by press to other personalised news services such as [[Flipboard]] and [[Zite]].  In a review of the Material app, [[VentureBeat]] commented  "While there are quite a few news-reading apps out there and Flipboard holds the dominant position, Material sets itself apart with design and intelligent curation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://venturebeat.com/2013/08/28/material-a-sexy-flipboard-competitor-comes-to-the-iphone/#zY3iaIIuBmb5SAHr.99 Material, a sexy Flipboard competitor, comes to the iPhone | VentureBeat | Mobile | by Sean Ludwig]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Flipboard, the makers of MATERIAL claim it will "evolve with you", learning what you like and recognising when your interests change &lt;ref&gt;http://www.inqmobile.com/en-gb/about-us/news/17&lt;/ref&gt;

===SO.HO===
The mobile launcher, SO.HO was launched by Inq for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices in 2013 The interface was designed by Chris Kelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.onemorechris.co.uk | title=Chris Kelly: Digital Designer | publisher ="Chris Kelly" | accessdate=March 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; SO.HO allows the user to have Facebook, Instagram and Twitter feeds on their homescreen, additionally the homescreen app allows for tweets, status updates, likes and comments to be made through the launcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.laptopmag.com/so-ho-android-app-combines-facebook-and-twitter-feeds-as-homescreen | title=SOHO Android App Combines Facebook and Twitter Feeds as Homescreen | publisher ="LAPTOP" | accessdate=March 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launcher provides the user a full screen version of their respective Twitter, Instagram and Facebook networks after they unlock their phone, in a similar manner to [[Facebook Home]] or [[HTC Blinkfeed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.androidcentral.com/soho-social-homescreen-launcher-hits-play-store-beta | title=SOHO Social Homescreen Launcher Hits Play Store Beta | publisher ="Android Central" | accessdate=March 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; SO.HO is available in [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (Europe/US) [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Hindi]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]]. In press commentary about the launcher, Inq initially stated that they intend to add more social networks to the launcher.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/50261/inq-soho-social-homepage-is-like-blink-feed","http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/50261/inq-soho-social-homepage-is-like-blink-feed&lt;/ref&gt; However more recent updates to the app have added in bespoke social media feeds that mix content from multiple networks in one view. The SO.HO feed is described by Ina as " a place where you can see the latest videos, pictures and links shared from all your friends across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram." &lt;ref name="play.google.com"&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.inqmobile.soho&amp;hl=en_GB&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the "Hashtag feed" shows users "the conversations happening right now across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram about that subject".&lt;ref name="play.google.com"/&gt;

==Inq Phones==

When it was founded in 2007, Inq's business model focused on creating affordable, mid-range [[smartphones]] which deeply integrated [[social networking]] and a range of usability features.  Inq phones were sold in Canada, India, Singapore, UK, Austria, Australia, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy and Sweden.

As per news reports, Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel), on September 14, 2009 announced that it would be start selling the social networking phone INQ Mini 3G, developed by INQ mobile. This phone launched on September 19, 2009 in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telesutra.com/2009/09/14/are-you-inq/&lt;/ref&gt; On March 18, 2010 Aircel in India started selling the INQ Mini and INQ Chat, and on July 28, 2010 the INQ Chat went onsale in Canada from Telus and Koodo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telusmobility.com/en/AB/inq_chat/index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aircel.com/AircelPortal/aircel.portal;jsessionid=wwgsMmQT3SQRH6bpTpXt7gV562LmKGk1nY0Rnyb7TscPhMdRFQ1Z!1748620133!226056627?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=Products_Inq_pages_inqHome_inq_landing_page&amp;circleName=Delhi Aircel Delhi- Mobile Service Provider, Postpaid &amp; Prepaid Mobile Plans, 3G Services&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013 Inq announced that they would no longer manufacture handsets but would focus exclusively on producing social software. A Venturebeat article at [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]]  quoted Ken Johnston as saying that “We’ve finished up with hardware a year ago, and we’ve been working our app engine since then,” Inq CEO and cofounder Ken Johnstone said last night at a CES 2013 event.&lt;ref name="venturebeat.com"&gt;[https://venturebeat.com/2013/01/08/inq-material-app/ Former 'Facebook phone' maker Inq pivots to apps with beautiful Flipboard killer Material | VentureBeat | Mobile | by Sean Ludwig]&lt;/ref&gt; Inq stated on their Facebook page that they will not be making further handsets but that they will continue to support those who own an Inq handset.

===INQ1===
{{Main|INQ1}}
The INQ1 was INQ's first mobile phone. It was released in December 2008, featuring a 2.2" QVGA screen, and a 3.2megapixel camera. Applications on the phone include: [[Skype]], [[Last.fm]], [[Ebay]], [[Facebook]], [[Myspace]] and [[Windows Live Messenger]].

===INQ Mini 3G===
{{Main|INQ Mini 3G}}
The follow on from the INQ1, this time with added Twitter functionality. Sharing a similar design to its 'sister' phone the Chat 3G, interchangeable back covers are available to purchase. The phone has a 2.0megapixel camera and was launched at £39.99 in the UK. The [[INQ1]] is notable for its very tight integration with [[Windows Live Messenger]], [[Facebook]] and [[Skype]].  It was endorsed at launch by [[Mark Zuckerberg]] and other industry identities.

A high level of [[firmware branding]] is present in the phone's operating system, this signifies a push for highly proprietary "for the network, by the network" mobile telephones which are extremely hard to unlock or debrand. In September 2009 Inq publicly stated that the company would build phones based on the Android mobile operating system, and claims they will be ready in early 2011.

===INQ Chat 3G===
{{Main|INQ Chat 3G}}
The 'big sister' to the Mini 3G, featuring similar functionality. However, the phone has an additional [[QWERTY keyboard]], a 3.2megapixel camera and a [[GPS]] device.

===Inq Cloud Touch===
{{Main|INQ Cloud Touch}}
The first of INQ's new Android-powered phones, moving away from [[Qualcomm Brew|BREW]] used in their previous phones. The mobile has more integration to [[Facebook]] than the previous phones, with direct access from the homescreen to popular aspects like Chat and Places. This is also the first INQ phone to feature [[Spotify]], which replaces a proprietary music player altogether. The Cloud Touch has a button dedicated to Spotify so you can access immediately, in addition to an 'Info' button for quick access to settings and information. The phone has a 3.5" [[HVGA]] touchscreen, and will be available in three different colours from April in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inqmobile.com/media/press/#2740 INQ Cloud Touch and Cloud Q Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Inq was founded in 2008 by Ken Johnstone, Frank Meehan and Jeff Taylor. In August 2009, the company launched two phones-the INQ Mini 3G (a candy-bar type form factor with [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]]) and the INQ Chat 3G (a [[QWERTY]] device with Twitter, Facebook and [[GMail]] integration).  Both models went on sale in Q4 2009 and feature removable coloured back panels. The [[INQ1]] won Phone of the Year at the 2009 [[GSMA]] Awards in Barcelona which are known informally as the industry Oscars.  The judges highlighted the handset's affordability, deep integration of social networks and ease of use in their winner's announcement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalmobileawards.com/awards/winners_archive.shtml#winner_cat3a&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010 news reports speculated about rumors that Facebook and Inq were working together on a “Facebook Phone”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-09-22/facebook-said-to-be-working-on-phones-with-partner-inq-for-at-t.html&lt;/ref&gt; To date no Facebook phone has emerged from either Inq or [[Facebook]] themselves.

In June 2011 it was reported that Jeff Taylor had left the company to start his own venture with Inq PR Head Soheb Panja &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobiletoday.co.uk/News/11863/INQ_cofounder_Jeff__Taylor_leaves_to_set_up_consultancy.aspx Mobile Today - INQ co-founder Jeff Taylor leaves to set up consultancy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by an announcement in September 2011 that Frank Meehan had been replaced as CEO by Ken Johnstone, co-founder and formerly Director of Products for Inq.

In January 2013 Inq announced that they would be focusing exclusively on producing social software moving forward and would no longer be involved in the manufacture or distribution of handsets. A Venturebeat article at [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]]  quoted Ken Johnston as saying that “We’ve finished up with hardware a year ago, and we’ve been working our app engine since then,” Inq CEO and cofounder Ken Johnstone said last night at a CES 2013 event.&lt;ref name="venturebeat.com"/&gt; This announcement was followed by a company rebrand, at which the company redesigned its logo and began to write the company name as Inq Mobile rather than the original INQ.

Inq launched a beta version of MATERIAL, a content discovery engine in February 2013. In an interview with Pocket-lint MATERIAL was positioned as a continuation of the Inq business, rather than a pivot from phones, with Pocket-Lint writing that "Inq is no stranger to "social DNA". The brief foray into devices with the INQ Cloud Touch back in 2011 very much centred on a granular integration of services like Facebook, helping important content rise to the surface. That ethos still sits at the core of what Inq is working on.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/119474-inq-material-news-app-android INQ Material serves up your daily news based on Twitter and Facebook 'social DNA' - Pocket-lint&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Other titles presented MATERIAL as a "pivot" for Inq, suggesting a change in business strategy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiercemobilecontent.com/story/after-scraping-phone-business-inq-pivots-app-maker/2013-01-09 After scrapping phone business, INQ pivots into app maker - FierceMobileIT&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Inq followed this with the launch a second beta app, SO.HO in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.inqmobile.com/get-facebook-twitter-on-your-home-screen-with-so-ho/&lt;/ref&gt; SO.HO (short for Social Homescreen) is an Android launcher. On the Inq Mobile blog, Inq say that SO.HO "allows you to put your favourite social networks on the homescreen of your Android mobile so that you can check what’s happening on multiple social networks without diving in and out of apps."

In August 2013 Inq launched the iOS version of Material and brought the Android version of Material out of beta.The launch of Material for iPhone was covered by many key press titles including [[Engadget|Engagdet]], [[TechCrunch]] and [[VentureBeat|Venturebeat.]]

As of 31 January 2014 they have ceased operations, the last issue of Material was on the 28th. SO.HO will continue to work but will no longer be offered/updated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5264">A '''jack post''' (telepost, adjustable steel column) is a steel post used in the construction trades for temporary support of ceilings, walls and trenches ([[shoring]]). The term "jack post" is one of many describing the same system, other names include any assortment of "adjustable", "steel", "jack" and "shoring" with "post", "column" and "prop", depending on their precise construction - the "jack" refers to examples with a [[jack screw]] to adjust the precise length of the post. They are also known by any number of trade names, notably "lally column" and "Acrow prop". Jack posts are widely standardized.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, in [http://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000000054095 BS 4074:1982]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Jack posts are telescopic tubular steel props consisting of two primary parts, the main part of the post, and the jack screw or other adjustable fitting on the end. Both ends are normally fitted with flat metal plates on the end, providing additional support area. Most jack posts are split in two near the middle, with the upper end carrying the jack designed to slide within the lower portion. Gross adjustment for length is first made by pulling a pin and sliding the two sections within each other until they almost fill the gap, inserting the pin to lock them, then using the screw to close any remaining gap. Other designs used two threaded pipes instead of sliding sections, clamping sections, or other similar concepts to lock the system at a specific length.

Jack posts are mostly used for [[shoring]]: temporary supports during building repair or alteration work, rather than [[scaffolding]]: access platforms for workers. A typical use is to support an existing horizontal beam while its original masonry supports are removed or repaired. When masonry itself is to be supported, holes are first knocked through the brickwork and a strong 'needle' or 'strongboy' is placed through the hole. A pair of props are then used, one under each end. Existing windows or doorways may also be supported directly, or via needles. As the plates on the end of the posts are typically small, they offer little sideways support. If there is any sideways force, props should be strutted or 'laced' with scaffolding poles.

==Acrow prop==
[[File:Acrow_prop.jpg|thumb|upright|Acrow prop]]
{{main article|acrow prop}}
Acrow props are adjustable for height by a large diameter [[screw thread]], formed on the outside of the outer tube itself. The screw thread provides a fine adjustment over a short range. A loose pin through a series of holes in the inner tube gives a wider range of coarse adjustment. Use of a screw thread also allows the props to be tightened when already in place, to adjust the load that each one bears. 

A recent improvement to Acrow props was to shape this baseplate with notches, allowing [[pallet]] loads of horizontal props to be stacked neatly, rather than randomly piled.

Although the original Acrow prop was only intended for vertical support, the range has since been extended. Shoring 'push and pull' props with swivelling footplates are available and are used to support concrete [[formwork]]. Horizontal strutting props are used for shoring trenchwork. These are similar, but have a 'claw' form to their baseplates.

Acrow props were invented by Swiss-born William de Vigier, who came to London in 1935.&lt;ref name="Telegraph, di Vigier obituary" &gt;{{Cite news
  |title=Obituary: William de Vigier
  |journal=[[Daily Telegraph]]
  |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1451424/William-de-Vigier.html
  |date=12 Jan 2004
}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first traditionalism amongst builders preferred the established timber props, cut to fit for each job. The break for Vigier's adjustable prop's came when they were adopted by a few large builders, including [[Sir Robert McAlpine]]. By 1939, over 40,000 Acrow props were in use.&lt;ref name="Telegraph, di Vigier obituary" /&gt;

Vigier's company was named the [[Acrow Group]], after his solicitor Mr A Crowe. He adopted this name as, like [[Kodak#Name|Kodak]], it was an easily pronouncable neologism, with the additional advantage of appearing early in alphabetical lists.&lt;ref name="Telegraph, di Vigier obituary" /&gt;

=== British Standard ===
Acrow props, their size, strength and construction, are now described by a British Standard BS4074: 1982.&lt;ref&gt;British Standard BS4074: 1982&lt;/ref&gt; A similar lightweight European prop design exists, these have a maximum capacity of only {{convert|5|kN}}.&lt;ref name="KHK" /&gt;

Props are made in a range of five BS standard sizes:&lt;ref name="KHK" /&gt;
*size 0 from {{convert|3.5|ft}} to {{convert|6|ft}},
*size 1 from {{convert|5.75|ft}} to {{convert|10.25|ft}},
*size 2 from {{convert|6.5|ft}} to {{convert|11|ft}},
*size 3 from {{convert|8|ft}} to {{convert|13|ft}},
*size 4 from {{convert|10.5|ft}} to {{convert|16|ft}}. 

The safe load for each prop is a maximum of {{convert|35|kN}}, reducing slightly when props are fully extended, or by up to half when the load is not perfectly vertical.&lt;ref name="KHK" &gt;{{Cite web

'''Jolt Sensor''', founded in 2014 by two [[MIT]] graduates, is a company that produces wearable concussion sensors which aim to mitigate head injuries in athletes. These devices can be paired with electronic devices, such as a smartphone or laptop, and send data on impact sustained by the wearer of the sensor. The data can evaluate whether the impact was serious enough to induce a concussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Sensor warns of concussion in young athletes |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-08/28/jolt-sensor |last = Collins |first = Katie |date = August 28, 2014 |publisher = Wired.Co.UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2014, Ben Harvatine and Seth Berg, both graduates from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], invented a wearable sensor that monitors impact and analyzes it to determine whether that impact is serious enough to cause injury. The Jolt sensor is designed to help sports medics determine whether or not an athlete is safe to continue to compete without risk of ignoring a concussion. Harvatine and Berg created the Jolt sensor during an engineering lab course at [[MIT]] after Harvatine had sustained a concussion during wrestling practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = MIT Students Invent Gadget to Detect Concussions in Young Athletes |url = https://www.yahoo.com/tech/mit-students-invent-gadget-to-detect-concussions-in-95944765704.html |last = Russon |first = Mary-Ann |date = August 27, 2014 |publisher = International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to produce the capital to start their business, Harvatine and Berg started a fundraiser on Kickstarter, raising over $60,000 within 31 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kyle-mccarthy/five-fabulous-fitness-wea_b_6567882.html |title = Five Fabulous Fitness Wearables that Were Successfully Crowdfunded |last = McCarthy |first = Kyle |date = January 30, 2015 |publisher = The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ladislas Starevich==
The great European stop motion pioneer was [[Ladislas Starevich|Ladyslaw Starewicz]] (1892-1965), who animated ''The Beautiful Lukanida'' (1912), ''The Ant and the Grasshopper'' (1911), ''The frogs who wanted a king'' (1922), ''The eyes of the Dragon'' (1925), ''The Queen of the butterflies'' (1927), ''The Magic Clock'' (1928), ''The Mascot'', (1933), and the feature film ''[[The Tale of the Fox]]'' (1930), to name but a few of his over fifty animated films.

Starewicz was the first filmmaker to use stop motion animation and puppets to tell consistently coherent stories. He made very expressive puppets and he developed a lot of visual effects in his movies. One of his innovations was the use of [[motion blur]] which he achieved, most likely, by the use of hidden string, which, because they were moving, didn't register on film during long exposures of each frame. He was a very successful in his time, making 2 films per year. His work has been restored thanks to his granddaughter, who preserved all his films from his French period.

==Henry Selick==
Director [[Henry Selick]] is a well-known force in the world of [[stop motion]] animation, with ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'' – based on Neil Gaiman's best-selling novella and released in 2009 – being his most recent and successful work. ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'', the first stop motion animated feature to be shot entirely in stereoscopic 3-D, received lavish critical praise and became the second highest grossing stop motion feature in history. Kenneth Turan, writing for the Los Angeles Times, said, "The third dimension comes of age with 'Coraline.' The first contemporary film in which the 3-D experience feels intrinsic to the story instead of a Godforsaken gimmick, 'Coraline' is a remarkable feat of imagination, a magical tale with a genuinely sinister edge." ''Coraline'', released by Focus Features, is the first feature film made by LAIKA, an animation company based in Portland, Oregon and headed up by Travis Knight. Selick made his feature film directing debut in 1993 with ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', the first full-length, stop motion feature from a major studio. An instant holiday classic based on producer Tim Burton's story, "Nightmare" was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and Selick won the International Animated Film Society's Annie Award for Best Creative Supervision. In 1996, Selick followed with a second feature, ''[[James and the Giant Peach (film)|James and the Giant Peach]]'', again produced by Burton, which combined stop motion [[animation]] with [[live-action]]. The film received widespread critical acclaim and won first prize at the world-renowned Annecy Film Festival in 1997.

Selick studied animation at CalArts in California in the late 1970s with classmates [[John Lasseter]], [[Brad Bird]], and [[John Musker]]. [[Joe Ranft]], Tim Burton, Jorgen Klubien, and Rick Heinrichs also attended CalArts, and both groups worked together at Disney Studios, with Ranft, Burton, Klubien, and Heinrichs collaborating with Selick in the years that followed on his feature films. While an animator at Disney, Selick received a grant to make an experimental short film, ''[[Seepage (film)|Seepage]]'', that combined hand-drawn animation with life-size cut-out human figures that he animated with stop motion. Leaving Disney in the early 80's, Selick moved to the Bay Area of California to work on the cut-out animated feature, ''[[Twice Upon A Time (film)|Twice Upon A Time]]'' as a sequence director. He went on to direct many stop motion TV ads including nine [[Pillsbury Doughboy]] spots, but it was his work on his stop motion ads for MTV and his short pilot episode, ''[[Slow Bob In The Lower Dimensions (film)|Slow Bob In The Lower Dimensions]]'', that caught the public's eye and reunited him with his old friend Burton, who, fresh off his success as a live-action director, revived his brilliant idea for a film, ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', and asked Selick to direct it. Selick put together a studio in San Francisco called "Skellington Productions" with producer Kathleen Gavin and production manager Phil Lofaro and grew his small band of story artists, animators, puppet makers, set builders, and lighters – including Ranft, Eric Leighton, Trey Thomas, Anthony Scott, Paul Berry, Pete Kozachik, Bo Henry, Bonita DeCarlo, etc. – into a full-fledged production team who spent three years making the film. Burton, directing first "Batman Returns" and then "Ed Wood Jr." in Los Angeles while "Nightmare" was being made up north, reviewed storyboards and footage every weeks and sent his talented collaborator, Rick Heinrichs, up north to develop the look of Halloween Town in the film.

Fifteen years after the first theatrical release of "Nightmare", Selick has come full circle with ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'', leading a brilliant team of artists, animators, lighters, and technicians – many of them veterans from "Nightmare" – to create another hand-made, all stop motion feature film.

==Tim Burton==
[[Tim Burton]] is very active in the field of stop motion animation. One of Burton's first films, ''[[Vincent (1982 film)|Vincent]]'', is a six-minute stop motion animation about a young boy who wants to be Vincent Price. Several of his early live-action films such as [[Pee Wee's Big Adventure]] and [[Beetlejuice]] made use of stop motion. In 1993, Burton produced the all-stop motion animation ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''. The film was in production for three years due to the length of time it takes to shoot stop motion. The main characters in the film were puppets that in order to create realism in the film were structured hundreds of face models with different expressions. The film is based on a poem Burton wrote inspired by "T'was the Night Before Christmas" — it was then directed by Henry Selick. Selick later directed the adaptation of ''[[James and the Giant Peach (film)|James and the Giant Peach]]'', a blend between stop motion animation and live action film. In 2005 ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' was released, another stop motion piece from Burton. Computer animation of the aliens for his 1996 science fiction comedy, ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'' was deliberately made to look like stop motion when the film's budget did not allow for the use of the actual stop motion process, blurring the line between the two forms of animation.

==Nick Park==
[[Nick Park]] and the [[Aardman]] team also produce commercials and music videos, notably the video for [[Peter Gabriel]]'s "Sledgehammer", which uses many different animation techniques, including [[pixilation]] involving Gabriel holding poses while each frame was shot and moving between exposures, effectively becoming a human puppet. More recently Aardman used this technique on a series of short films for [[BBC Three]] entitled ''[[Angry Kid]]'', which starred a live actor wearing a mask. The actor's pose and the mask's expression had to be altered slightly for each exposure. Aardman has also created many films, of which some have become household names. Nick Park joined Aardman after they took interest in his college project, ''[[A Grand Day Out]]''. Since then, Nick Park has directed the following films for Aardman: ''[[The Wrong Trousers]]'', ''[[Creature Comforts]]'', ''[[A Close Shave]]'', "Cracking Contraptions", the feature film ''[[Chicken Run]]'', and more recently, another feature film ''[[Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', co-produced with [[DreamWorks Animation]]. Nick Park's latest work is the new [[Wallace and Gromit]] short (30 minutes) called ''[[A Matter of Loaf and Death]]'', broadcast on [[BBC One]] on Christmas Day 2008. Nick Park has won several Academy Awards for Best Animation.

==Ray Harryhausen==
Willis O'Brien's student [[Ray Harryhausen]] made many movies using a more elaborate version of puppet animation called [[model animation]], first pioneered by O'Brien, mainly for his feature-length films, the difference being that model animation strives to be "photo-realistic" enough to be able to be combined with live action elements to create a final fantasy sequence that allows the audience to suspend their disbelief that they are watching animation elements. Example of his model animation techniques; most famously, are the seven-skeleton sequence from ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' (1963). But aside from the more "disguised" stop motion efforts of O'Brien and Harryhausen, America and Britain were slower to embrace the stop motion film, and so its use mainly grew out of other locations and sources.

==Phil Tippett==

Dilldoid-1970s, Phil Tippett, a stop motion animator inspired by the works of Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen, was tapped by George Lucas to work on Star Wars. After creating the Chess Set sequence and participating in the Cantina scene as a member of the monster band for the seminal movie, Phil was enlisted to join Lucas when he relocated ILM from Los Angeles to the Bay Area.
During Tippett's tenure at ILM he earned an enduring place in the Star Wars galaxy by animating the Imperial Walkers and Tauntaun in The Empire Strikes and then was knighted as head of the studio's creature shop for Return of the Jedi. In addition to his artistic contributions Tippett's technical ingenuity was evident with the invention of the 'Go-Motion' animation technique in 1982 – a forerunner of today’s computer graphic imaging. He earned his first Academy Award© nomination for Dragonslayer and by 1983 received his first Oscar for Return of the Jedi.
In 1984, Tippett left ILM and, along with his partner Jules Roman, founded Tippett Studio in a garage in Berkeley to create a 10-minute experimental film called Prehistoric Beast. The Emmy award-winning CBS special, Dinosaur!, quickly followed it.
Fast forward several decades, the company now occupies four buildings in Berkeley, employs up to 200 artists and technicians and is best known for its outstanding CG character animation work.
The early days of Tippett Studio saw sequences designed, built and animated using stop motion for movies like Robocop, with the out of control robot ED209, and later Robocop 2, with the evil mayhem created by the Cain robot.

==George Pal==
One acclaimed European puppet animation producer to break out in America was Hungarian animator [[George Pal]], who, partially working in The Netherlands, produced a series of films in Europe during the 30s before coming to Hollywood to create more shorts in the 40s, now called ''[[Puppetoons]]'' under the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] banner, seven of which were nominated for Academy Awards for best animated film. In the late 40s, Pal evolved into feature film production, incorporating puppet animation into a live action setting in such films as ''[[The Great Rupert]]'' (1949), ''[[tom thumb (film)]]'' (1958), and ''[[The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm]]'' (1962). Pal used model animation (animated by Jim Danforth) in two other feature films, ''[[The Time Machine (1960 film)|The Time Machine]]'' (1960) and ''[[7 Faces of Dr. Lao]]'' (1964), the latter nominated for a Special Effects Oscar, and the former winning the EFX Oscar award. Pal's work is documented in two feature films by [[Arnold Leibovit]], released in the mid-80s, ''[[The Puppetoon Movie]]'' and ''[[The Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal]]'' which are currently available on Blu-ray and DVD. More of Danforth's skilled model animation can be seen in ''[[Jack the Giant Killer (1962 film)|Jack the Giant Killer]]'' (1962), the ending fire ladder sequence for ''[[It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World]]'' (1963), "[[The Zanti Misfits]]" and "[[Counterweight]]" episodes of the original ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' TV series (1963), and, with equally prolific model animator David Allen, in ''[[Equinox (film)|Equinox]]'' (also titled "The Beast") (1967, 1970), ''[[Flesh Gordon]]'' (1974), and the prehistoric comedy ''[[Caveman (film)|Caveman]]'' (1981).

==Cuppa Coffee Studios==
[[Cuppa Coffee Studios]] is based in Toronto and has also pioneered many of the modern techniques associated with stop motion. Started in 1992 by Adam Shaheen, the company has grown to now the single largest producer of stop motion for TV with over 250 employees and 48 Studios. All production is conducted at the {{convert|75,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility.They have produced the classic ''[[Celebrity Deathmatch]]'', ''[[Rick and Steve]]'', ''[[Starveillance]]'', ''[[A Very Barry Christmas]]'' and ''[[JoJo's Circus]]'' and ''[[Glenn Martin DDS]]'', ''[[Life's a Zoo]]'', ''[[A Miser Brothers Christmas]]'', ''[[Crashbox]]'' and ''[[Ugly Americans (TV series)|Ugly Americans]]''. The studio has won over 200 international broadcast awards for its work and an award-winning Commercial and Broadcast Design Departments.

==Suzie Templeton==
[[Suzie Templeton]] is most famous for her work on the film ''[[Peter and the Wolf (2006 film)|Peter and the Wolf]]'' for which she won the 2008 Academy Award for best Short Film (Animated).

==Adam Jones==
[[Adam Jones (musician)|Adam Jones]], Grammy Award-winning guitarist/musician/visual artist for the Grammy Award-winning progressive rock band [[Tool (band)|Tool]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/49th_Show/list.aspx#24 GRAMMY.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5mpxBstf2?url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/49th_Show/list.aspx |date=2010-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; uses stop motion capturing techniques for the majority of Tool's music videos as well. With the exception of [[Hush (Tool song)|Hush]], the band members of Tool do not appear in their videos, but rather use a combination of clay animation and stop motion. Jones' studies began in 1983 at the Hollywood Makeup Academy by learning "straight make-up". His focus of interest shifted to film, and he began to work as a sculptor and special effects designer for such films as ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' and ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''. It was here where he learned the stop motion camera techniques he would later apply in Tool's music videos: [[Sober (Tool song)|"Sober"]] (on which he collaborated with Fred Stuhr), "[[Prison Sex (song)|Prison Sex]]", "[[Stinkfist]]", "[[Ænema]]", [[Schism (song)|"Schism"]], and [[Parabola (song)|"Parabola"]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Jones (musician)#Film work|Adam Jones - Film work]]&lt;/ref&gt; The techniques and style of Tool's music videos, particularly Sober and Prison Sex, borrow heavily from the work of [[The Brothers Quay]].

==Willis O'Brien==
The great pioneer of American stop motion was [[Willis O'Brien]]. In 1914, O'Brien began animating a series of short subjects set in prehistoric times. He animated his early creations by covering wooden armatures with clay, a technique he further perfected by using ball &amp; socket armatures covered with foam, foam latex, animal hair and fur. ''[[Birth of a Flivver]]'' (1915), ''[[Morpheus Mike]]'' (1915), ''[[The Dinosaur and the Missing Link: A Prehistoric Tragedy]]'' (1916), ''[[R.F.D. 10,000 B.C.: A Mannikin Comedy]]'' (1917/18), ''[[The Ghost of Slumber Mountain]]'' (1919), [[The Lost World (1925 film)|''The Lost World'']] (1925), ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933), ''[[The Son of Kong]]'' (1933), and, with the assistance of a young [[Ray Harryhausen]], ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]'' (1949), yet these were but a few of the many films he animated. O'Brien's ''[[Nippy's Nightmare]]'' (1916) was the first film to combine live actors with stop motion characters. His partnership with the great Mexican-American model makers/craftsmen/special effects artists/background painters/set builders, [[Marcel Delgado]], [[Victor Delgado]] and [[Mario Larrinaga]], led to some of the most memorable and remarkable stop motion moments in film history.

O'Brien's imaginative use of stop motion, and his ambitious and inventive filmmaking, has inspired generations of film greats such as [[Ray Harryhausen]], [[George Lucas]], [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Peter Jackson]], [[Jim Danforth]], [[Art Clokey]], [[Sneaky Pete Kleinow|Pete Kleinow]], [[Tim Burton]], [[David W. Allen|David Allen]], [[Phil Tippett]] and [[Will Vinton]], as well as thousands of lesser known animators, both professional and amateur. Many leading science fiction and fantasy writers also credit him as a great source of inspiration.

==Lou Bunin==
Puppeteer [[Lou Bunin]] created one of the first stop motion puppets using wire armatures and his own rubber formula. Another early stop motion piece by Bunin, also in the 1930s was ''[[Bury the Axis]]'', a short, satiric film about World War II probably commissioned for the US Government as a WPA grant. Bunin went on to produce a feature-length film version of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland#Cinematic adaptations|Alice in Wonderland]]'' with a live-action Alice and stop motion puppets portraying all the rest of the characters. Bunin was [[blacklist]]ed in the 1950s, putting an effective end to his commercial career. He then turned his attention to painting and drawing, while still creating numerous TV commercials using stop motion techniques, as well as a number of children's short films.

==Charles Bowers==
One of the more idiosyncratic early users of stop motion techniques was the American comedian and cartoonist [[Charley Bowers|Charles Bowers]] who employed stop motion techniques (which he called the "Bowers Process") in his series of silent short comedies in the 1920s and early 1930s. In his 1926 film ''[[Now You Tell One]]'', he skillfully uses stop motion to create such effects as a straw hat growing on a man's head, cats growing out of a plant, and a mouse firing a gun. His color film, "Pete Roleum and His Cousins", a promotion piece about the importance of oil in contemporary life, debuted in the [[1939 New York World's Fair]].

==Disney==
The [[Walt Disney]] studio dabbled with puppet object animation in 1959 with the release of a 21-minute experimental short, ''[[Noah's Ark (1959 film)|Noah's Ark]]'', nominated for an animated film Oscar for that year. Disney didn't exploit the technique until their associations with [[Mike Jittlov]] in the 1970s.

Disney once again experimented with several stop motion techniques by hiring independent animator-director [[Mike Jittlov]] to do the first stop motion animation of [[Mickey Mouse]] toys ever produced for a short sequence called ''Mouse Mania'', part of a TV special commemorating Mickey Mouse's 50th Anniversary called ''Mickey's 50th'' in 1978.

==Rankin/Bass==
In North America, [[Arthur Rankin, Jr.]] and [[Jules Bass]] of [[Rankin/Bass Productions]] produced a series of popular Christmas and non-holiday TV specials and feature films such as ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer]]'' in 1964, and the TV series ''[[The New Adventures of Pinocchio (TV series)|The New Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' in the early 1960s using '[[Animagic]]', their trade name for their version of stop motion puppetry. The specials were animated in Japan by Japanese stop motion pioneer [[Tadahito Mochinaga]] (in the 1960s) and the other Animagic supervisors in a Tokyo-based studio called '[[MOM Productions]]'. Another clay animated children's TV series ''[[Davey and Goliath]]'', produced by Art Clokey, lasted from 1960 to 1977. Rankin and Bass also produced the puppet animation feature-length film ''[[Mad Monster Party]]'' in 1967, and combined puppet animation with live action in the 1966 feature film ''[[The Daydreamer (film)|The Daydreamer]]'', and along with cel animation in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] TV special ''[[The Enchanted World of Danny Kaye: The Emperor's New Clothes]]'' in 1972.

==Jackie Cockle==
In the UK, [[Jackie Cockle]] is an important figure in the pre-school stop frame animation scene. She was the creative producer of the worldwide success [[Bob the Builder]], and is the creator and producer of [[Timmy Time]]. Since 2002, Cockle has won 3 [[BAFTA]] awards.

==Art Clokey==
{{main|Art Clokey}}

[[Art Clokey]] is best known for the clay character [[Gumby]] and for the show ''[[Davey and Goliath]]''.

==Corky Quakenbush==
{{main|Corky Quakenbush}}

[[Corky Quakenbush, Space Bass Films|Corky Quakenbush]] created three dozen stop motion animated films for [[Fox network]]'s ''[[Mad TV]]'' in the late 1990s{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} that helped fuel a movement of comic stop motion for adults{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}. Parodying famous feature movies and TV shows, the shorts drew their humor from the mixing of the innocence of puppets and the profanity of violence in mainstream contemporary situations. One example is ''[[List of fictional deer#Characters from MADtv|Raging Rudolph]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

Quakenbush also created "reality animation"{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} to mimic hand-held documentary newsgathering for ''Clops'', written by Blaine Capatch, a parody of the groundbreaking reality show, ''[[Cops (TV series)|Cops]]'' in which puppet police bust famous stop motion characters. Other parodies followed, such as ''Furious George'', a spoof of the innocent ''[[Curious George]]'' children's book series.

==Other notable artists==
Other notable artists include the influential Czech animator [[Jiří Trnka]]. The aesthetic tradition of the puppet film was continued by [[Bretislav Pojar]], [[Kihachirō Kawamoto]], [[Ivo Caprino]], [[Jan Švankmajer]], [[Jiří Barta]], the ([[Brothers Quay]]), [[bolexbrothers]] and Galina Beda.

A notable stop motion object animator was Germany's [[Oskar Fischinger]], who animated anything he could get his hands on in a series of short abstract art films during the 20s and 30s. The best example is his 1934 film, ''Composition in Blue''. Fischinger was hired by Disney to animate the "rolling hills" footage used in the opening "Toccata &amp; Fugue" sequence of ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940).

From the 1940s until the 1970s, notable Dutch stage designer turned stop motion pioneer [[Joop Geesink]] owned and operated his "Dollywood Studio's" in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Geesink, after a dissolved partnership with Dutch comic artist and writer [[Marten Toonder]], turned his attention towards stop motion animation. ''Serenata Noctura'' (1942) was his first endeavour, and was followed by many commercial short films for Dutch advertising broadcaster [[Stichting Ether Reclame]] (STER) and Dutch multinational electronics corporation [[Philips]], including ''Kermesse Fantastique'' (1951), ''Piccolo, Saxo and Company'' (1960) and ''Cavalcade'' (1964).

[[Jake Fried]] is a painter turned stop motion animator. He became interested in the way the image changed in the course of painting. He modifies and photographs an artwork over and over to create an image that rapidly evolves over the course of his short videos, which are typically a minute long.

Yiannopoulos is a former senior editor for [[Breitbart News]] who describes himself as a "cultural libertarian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beauchamp|first1=Zack|title=Milo Yiannopoulos: Breitbart's star provocateur and Trump champion, explained|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/4/4/11355876/milo-yiannopoulos|accessdate=24 October 2017|publisher=Vox Media|date=20 February 2017|quote=Once you understand that Yiannopoulos thinks norms against offensive speech and action are themselves a terrible form of authoritarianism, then the rest of his persona starts to make a lot more sense.

Much of the work at Breitbart which brought Yiannopoulos to national attention was inspired by the ideas of neo-Nazis and white nationalists. In October 2017, leaked emails revealed that Yiannopoulos had repeatedly solicited [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] and [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] figures on the [[alt-right]] for feedback and story ideas in his work for the website [[Breitbart News|Breitbart]]. The leaked emails also showed that his book, ''[[Dangerous (book)|Dangerous]]'', and many of his Breitbart articles were [[Ghostwriter|ghost-written]] by a Breitbart colleague.&lt;ref name="KaraokeForNeoNazis"/&gt;

Yiannopoulos was born and raised in [[Kent]]. He was expelled from [[Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys]] and he studied at the [[University of Manchester]] and [[Wolfson College, Cambridge]], but failed to gain a degree from either. He began working in technology journalism for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' before co-running ''[[The Kernel]]'', an [[online magazine]], which was devoted to technology journalism, in 2011–13. He was one of the first journalists to cover the [[Gamergate controversy]]. In 2015 he began work at Breitbart, attracting attention for his opinions and the company's association with the alt-right. He relocated to the United States, where he became a vocal supporter of Donald Trump's [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]]. In July 2016 he was permanently banned from [[Twitter]] for what the company cited as "inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others", referring to a racist harassment campaign against African-American actress [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]] Twitter says Yiannopoulos inspired.&lt;ref name="Leslie Jones harassment"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grynbaum and Herrman|first1=Michael and John|title=Breitbart Rises From Outlier to Potent Voice in Campaign|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/27/business/media/breitbart-news-presidential-race.html|website=The New York Times.com|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=7 January 2018|quote="Last month, Milo Yiannopoulos, the site's tech editor, was banned from Twitter after inspiring a sustained online harassment campaign against the "Saturday Night Live" actor Leslie Jones."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbsnews.com/video/leslie-jones-leaves-twitter-amidst-onslaught-of-racist-tweets/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Yiannopoulos has been accused of being an apologist for or supporting [[paedophilia]], a charge he strenuously denies. The charge arises from a video clip in which he said that sexual relationships between 13-year-old boys and adult men and women can be "perfectly consensual" and positive experiences for the boys.&lt;ref name="NBCNewsUproar"&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Hara|first1=Mary Emily|title=Yiannopoulos Quits Breitbart, Apologizes for Uproar Over Year-Old Comments|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/yiannopoulos-quits-breitbart-apologizes-uproar-over-year-old-comments-n723861|website=nbcnews.com|publisher=National Broadcasting Company|accessdate=7 March 2017|quote=And I think particularly in the gay world, and outside the Catholic Church – if that's where some of you want to go with this – I think in the gay world some of the most important, enriching and incredibly life-affirming, important shaping relationships very often between younger boys and older men ... They can be hugely positive experiences.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the release of the tape, Yiannopoulos was forced out of his position at Breitbart, and lost a contract to publish his autobiography with [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. Yiannopoulos has denied that he is a supporter of paedophilic relationships and claimed that his statements that ostensibly support them were merely attempts to cope with his own past victimhood, as an object of [[child abuse]] by unnamed older men.

Raised by his mother and her second husband, Yiannopoulos has stated that he did not have a good relationship with his stepfather.

"Wolfson ... threw me out after repeated warnings for the ridiculously trivial reason that I didn't show up to supervisions, didn't submit any essays and spent most of my time shagging and drinking instead of reading medieval literature."&lt;/ref&gt; in 2010.  In a 2012 interview, he said of  dropping out, "I try to tell myself I'm in good company, but ultimately it doesn't say great things about you unless you go on to terrific success in your own right."&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

==Career==
After university, Yiannopoulos initially secured a job at ''[[The Catholic Herald]]''. He was interested in becoming a [[theatre criticism|theatre critic]]. However, Yiannopoulos' break came with his interest in [[technology journalism]] while investigating the subject of [[women in computing]] in 2009 for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fusion.net/story/220646/the-terrifying-allure-of-gamergate-icon-milo-yiannopoulos/|title=The ultimate troll: The terrifying allure of Gamergate icon Milo Yiannopoulos|first=Kristen|last=Brown|date=27 October 2015|accessdate=6 November 2015|publisher=[[Fusion (TV channel)|Fusion]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He appeared on [[BBC Two]]'s ''[[Newsnight]]'' with rapper [[Tinchy Stryder]] in May 2014, discussing [[copyright infringement]] and [[music piracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-27354838|title=Tinchy Stryder: Fine illegal downloaders as a last resort|publisher=BBC News|date=10 May 2014|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, he appeared on ''[[The Big Questions]]'', discussing topics relating to [[feminism]] and discrimination against men in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05n1lww|title= The Big Questions: Series 8, Episode 10|publisher=BBC One|date=15 March 2015|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017 he was nominated to stand in the election for [[rector of the University of Glasgow]] to succeed [[Edward Snowden]], a post elected by students of the [[University of Glasgow]] in Scotland; he came fourth with 533 votes to [[Aamer Anwar]]'s 4,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aamer Anwar elected as new Glasgow University rector|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-39346656|accessdate=23 March 2017|work=BBC News|date=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had demanded the university's Muslim Students Association be shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oppenheim|first1=Maya|title=Milo Yiannopoulos sparks outrage after calling for Muslim group ban at Glasgow University|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/milo-yiannopoulos-rector-glasgow-university-muslim-uni-group-ban-a7633936.html|accessdate=26 September 2017|work=The Independent|date=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017 he was hired by the conservative American news and opinion website ''[[The Daily Caller]]'' to write a weekly column, but was fired after his first column was published,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/media/358785-daily-caller-drops-milo-yiannopolous-after-one-column|title=Daily Caller drops Milo Yiannopoulos after first column|date=4 November 2017|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the opinion editor who hired him was also consequently fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/358784-daily-caller-fires-opinion-editor-over-milo-controversy|title=Daily Caller fires opinion editor over Milo controversy|date=4 November 2017|work=The Hill|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/04/media/daily-caller-milo-yiannopoulos/|title=Daily Caller's opinion editor fired over Milo Yiannopoulos column|date=4 November 2017|work=[[CNNMoney]]|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Telegraph'' Tech Start-Up 100===
Yiannopoulos organised a method of ranking the most promising technology start-ups in Europe, ''The Telegraph Tech Start-Up 100'', in 2011. It operated through an events company called Wrong Agency, started by Yiannopoulos and David Rosenberg, a friend from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. The company was dissolved shortly after the ceremony that awarded the top start-up.&lt;ref name=Arthur/&gt; Mike Butcher of ''[[TechCrunch]]'' said the main prize had been given to music streaming service [[Spotify]], even though his casting vote had gone to the controversial [[payday loan]] company [[Wonga.com|Wonga]], because the Telegraph considered Wonga's reputation objectionable.&lt;ref name=techcrunch110517&gt;{{cite news|title=Wonga won the Startup 100 awards, not Spotify|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/17/wonga-won-the-startup100-awards-not-spotify|accessdate=15 September 2012|work=TechCrunch Europe|date=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Kernel''===
Together with university friends David Rosenberg and David Haywood Smith, journalist Stephen Pritchard and former ''Telegraph'' employee Adrian McShane, Yiannopoulos launched ''The Kernel'' in November 2011 to "fix European technology journalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Yiannopoulos|first=Milo|title=It's time to fix European technology journalism|url=http://www.kernelmag.com/editors-blog/145/its-time-to-fix-european-technology-journalism|accessdate=12 September 2012|work=The Kernel|date=10 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715095348/http://www.kernelmag.com/editors-blog/145/its-time-to-fix-european-technology-journalism|archivedate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Kernel'' was at that time owned by Sentinel Media.

In 2012, the online magazine became embroiled in a legal dispute with one of its contributors after he said it failed to pay money owed to him.&lt;ref name=Arthur/&gt; ''The Kernel'' closed in March 2013, with thousands of pounds owed to former contributor Jason Hesse when he won a summary judgement from an employment tribunal against parent company Sentinel Media. Margot Huysman, whom Yiannopoulos had appointed associate editor and was one of the people seeking payment, said that many working for the site had been "screwed over" personally and financially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/mar/05/kernel-close-debts-unpaid-sentinel-media|title=The Kernel to close as debts stay unpaid|author=Charles Arthur|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yiannopoulos also threatened, via email, to release embarrassing details and photographs of a Kernel contributor who sought payment for their work for the site and he also accused the contributor of being behind the "majority of damage to ''The Kernel''". The unnamed contributor told ''The Guardian'' that the emails had been referred to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jan/08/kernel-face-payout-order-contributor|title=The Kernel could face £11,000 payout order|author=Charles Arthur|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German venture capital vehicle BERLIN42 acquired ''The Kernel''{{'}}s assets in early 2013. The website displayed plans for a relaunch in August 2013 with fresh investment and Yiannopoulos reinstated as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref name=sindy&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams-Grut|first=Oscar|title=The Kernel's back to make new enemies|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/the-kernels-back-to-make-new-enemies-8640597.html|accessdate=6 June 2013|work=The Independent on Sunday|date=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; BERLIN42 founding partner Aydogan Ali Schosswald would join its newly formed publishing company, Kernel Media, as chief executive. Yiannopoulos personally paid six former contributors money that the defunct company was unable to pay.&lt;ref name=sindy/&gt; Parent company Sentinel Media Ltd was eventually dissolved on 18 February 2014 after being struck off by [[Companies House]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07837639 Sentinel Media Ltd], companieshouse.gov.uk; accessed 29 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Independent on Sunday'' reported that the relaunched publication, based between London and Berlin, would focus on "modern warfare, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, pornography and space travel" from August, but newsletter ''The Nutshell'' would not return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Oscar|last=Williams-Grut|title=The Kernel's back to make new enemies|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2 June 2013|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/the-kernels-back-to-make-new-enemies-8640597.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, ''The Kernel'' was acquired by Daily Dot Media, the parent company of ''[[The Daily Dot]]''. After the acquisition by Daily Dot Media, Yiannopoulos stepped down as editor-in-chief though he remained an adviser to the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.eu/features/375/the-kernel-daily-dot-media-acquisition|title=The Kernel acquired by The Daily Dot Media; founder moves on|work=Tech.eu|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gamergate===
Yiannopoulos played a role in early news coverage of the [[Gamergate controversy]], criticising what he saw as the politicisation of [[video game culture]] by "an army of sociopathic feminist programmers and campaigners, abetted by achingly politically correct American tech bloggers."&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/15/living/gamergate-explainer/|title=Behind the furor over #Gamergate|last=Griggs|first=Brandon|publisher=CNN|date=16 October 2014|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Metro&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/10/15/gamergate-what-is-it-and-why-are-gamers-so-angry-4907102|title=GamerGate – what is it, and why are gamers so angry?|work=Metro|date=15 October 2014|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of his coverage of Gamergate, he published correspondence from GameJournoPros, a private mailing list used by video game journalists to discuss industry related topics.&lt;ref name=Recode&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recode.net/2014/10/10/understanding-the-jargon-of-gamergate|title=Understanding the Jargon of Gamergate|last=Johnson|first=Eric|work=Recode|date=10 October 2014|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ihe_gjp"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Straumsheim|first1=Carl|title=#Gamergate and Games Research|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/11/11/gamergate-supporters-attack-digital-games-research-association|website=Inside Higher Ed|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yiannopoulos said that the list was evidence that journalists were colluding to offer negative coverage of Gamergate.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Kyle Orland, the creator of the list, responded to the leak on [[Ars Technica]].

During the controversy, Yiannopoulos said that he received a syringe filled with an unknown substance through the post,&lt;ref name=TechC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/25/gamergate-an-issue-with-2-sides|title=#GamerGate – An Issue With Two Sides|publisher=Techcrunch.com|last=Bokhari|first=Allum|date=25 September 2014|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KotakuAU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2014/10/another-woman-in-gaming-flees-home-following-death-threats|title=Another Woman in Gaming Flees Home Following Death Threats|last=Totilo|first=Stephen|date=12 October 2014|accessdate=19 October 2014|work=[[Kotaku]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a dead animal.

In May 2015, a meetup in Washington D.C. for supporters of Gamergate arranged by Yiannopoulos and [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] was targeted by a bomb threat made over Twitter, according to the local police responding to information supplied by the [[FBI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/3/8539733/gamergate-bomb-threat-washington-ggindc-milo-yiannopoulos-christina-hoff-summers|title=Bomb threat clears out GamerGate gathering in Washington D.C.|first=Owen S.|last=Good|date=3 May 2015|accessdate=11 July 2015|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, three months later in August 2015, an event at the Koubek Center in Miami sponsored by the [[Society of Professional Journalists]] was targeted by bomb threats, forcing the evacuation of the building and the suspension of a panel with Yiannopoulos and Sommers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2015/08/15/Bomb-threat-interrupts-GamerGate-panel-at-journalism-conference/3921439670431|title=Bomb threat interrupts GamerGate panel at journalism conference|agency=United Press International|date=15 August 2015|author=Stephen Feller}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2015/08/15/gamergate-event-evacuated-after-multiple-bomb-threats|title=#GamerGate Event Evacuated After Multiple Bomb Threats|work=Forbes|author=Erik Kain|date=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://risemiaminews.com/2015/08/breaking-gamer-gate-controversy-prompts-evacuation-of-koubek-center-in-miami|title=Gamer Gate Controversy Prompts Evacuation Of Koubek Center In Miami|work=Rise Miami News|access-date=16 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816060113/http://risemiaminews.com/2015/08/breaking-gamer-gate-controversy-prompts-evacuation-of-koubek-center-in-miami/|archive-date=16 August 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamepolitics.com/2015/08/15/spj-airplay-event-evacuated-after-multiple-bomb-threats|title=SPJ AirPlay event evacuated after multiple bomb threats|publisher=GamePolitics.com|date=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breitbart Tech===
In October 2015, the [[Breitbart News Network]] placed Yiannopoulos in charge of its new "Breitbart Tech" section. The site has six full-time staff, including an [[eSports]] specialist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/28/media/breitbart-tech-gamergate/|title=Breitbart brings its conservative take to tech journalism|publisher=CNN|location=New York|date=28 October 2015|accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-27/breitbart-news-is-preparing-to-troll-tech|title=Breitbart News Is Preparing to Troll Tech|first=Joshua|last=Brustein|date=27 October 2015|accessdate=6 November 2015|publisher=Bloomberg Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was edited by Yiannopoulos until his resignation on 21 February 2017.&lt;ref name="AP2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Milo Yiannopoulos resigns as editor of Breitbart Tech|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ap-milo-yiannopoulos-resigns-as-editor-of-breitbart-tech-2017-2|accessdate=2 March 2017|work=Business Insider|agency=Associated Press|date=21 February 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302172018/http://www.businessinsider.com/ap-milo-yiannopoulos-resigns-as-editor-of-breitbart-tech-2017-2|archivedate=2 March 2017|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant===
Yiannopoulos and several figures in the alt-right participated in a five-hour online telethon to raise money for the ''Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant''. In August 2016, Yiannopoulos reported that approximately $100,000 had been received in donations and a further $250,000 had been pledged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/news-blog/2016/aug/19/milo-yiannopoulos-denies-spending-privilege-fund|title=Where's the money?

McLennan, formerly [[bursary]] manager of the grant, posted criticism of it on social media in August 2016, indicating it was mismanaged and that she had ceased managing the grant the previous March because she had not been paid and that the movement had ended.&lt;ref name="the-guardian-wheres-the-money"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/news-blog/2016/aug/19/milo-yiannopoulos-denies-spending-privilege-fund|title=Where's the money?

MacLennan posted a screenshot of the alleged transfer to support her claim.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/19/breitbart-editor-milo-yiannopoulos-takes-100-000-for-charity-gives-0|title=Breitbart Editor Milo Yiannopoulos Takes $100,000 for Charity, Gives $0|last=Resnick|first=Ben Collins{{!}}Gideon|date=2016-08-19|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yiannopoulos apologised for mismanaging the grant and admitted that he had missed a deadline for turning donations into bursaries. He denied speculation he had spent the money and blamed a busy schedule. He appointed a new fund administrator, and a pilot grant had been scheduled to begin the following spring, with full disbursement in the 2017/18 academic year.&lt;ref name="the-guardian-wheres-the-money"/&gt; On 31 March 2017, the Privilege Grant website claimed that ten applicants had been selected to receive pilot project grants, though no names or supporting information was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privilege Grant news|url=https://privilegegrant.com/news/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112211258/https://privilegegrant.com/news/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 November 2016|website=privilegegrant.com|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018 Yiannopoulos confirmed that the fund had been closed down.&lt;ref&gt;Zadrozny, Brandy (March 29, 2018).

=== Media ventures ===
In mid-2017, Yiannopoulos launched Milo, Inc., a [[new media]] outlet "dedicated to the destruction of political correctness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-milo-yiannopoulos-inc-media-empire-20170502-story.html|title= Milo Yiannopoulos to launch Milo Inc., 'dedicated to the destruction of political correctness'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2 May 2017|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/leaked-documents-suggest-secretive-billionaire-trump-donors|title=Leaked Documents Suggest Secretive Billionaire Trump Donors Are Milo's Patrons|work=[[Buzzfeed]]|date=13 July 2017|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, after dropping a lawsuit against the company [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] over the publication of his book ''[[Dangerous (book)|Dangerous]]'', Yiannopoulos made an appearance on ''[[InfoWars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=May |first=Charlie |url=https://www.salon.com/2018/02/21/the-fall-of-milo-breitbarts-former-star-is-now-hawking-supplements-on-infowars/ |title=The fall of Milo: Breitbart's former star is now hawking supplements on Infowars |date=February 21, 2018 |work=Salon |accessdate=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===LGBT issues===
While Yiannopoulos is openly [[homosexuality|gay]], he has described being gay as "aberrant" and "a lifestyle choice guaranteed to bring [gay people] pain and unhappiness."&lt;ref&gt;Yiannopoulos, Milo. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110714053205/http://yiannopoulos.net/2011/07/11/why-ill-probably-never-be-a-parent "Why I'll probably never be a parent"], Yiannopoulos.net.&lt;br&gt;Archived from [http://yiannopoulos.net/2011/07/11/why-ill-probably-never-be-a-parent the original] at 16 August 2011.&lt;br&gt;"But the thought that I might influence my child towards a lifestyle choice guaranteed to bring them pain and unhappiness–however remote that chance may be–is horrifying to me. That's why, quite simply, I wouldn't bring a child up in a gay household."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of his earliest mainstream media appearances concerned [[sexuality]]. In 2011 he debated [[same-sex marriage]] on [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[10 O'Clock Live]]'' with [[Boy George]],&lt;ref name=10oclock&gt;''10 O'Clock Live'', 17 February 2011, Channel 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and a year later on ''[[Newsnight]]''.&lt;ref name=newsnight&gt;''Newsnight'', 15 March 2012, BBC Television&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 he opposed the provision of "[[Church of our Lady of the Assumption and St Gregory, Westminster|Soho masses]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/soho-gay-mass-move-splits-gay-catholic-opinion|title=Soho gay mass move splits gay Catholic opinion|first=Brian|last=Whelan|publisher=Channel 4|date=3 January 2013|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, he debated with singer [[Will Young]] on ''Newsnight'' about the use of the word "gay" as a playground taunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25097085|title=Will Young: Teach what 'gay' really means|publisher=BBC News|date=26 November 2013|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an interview with [[Joe Rogan]], in 2015, Yiannopoulos said that 'If I could choose, I wouldn't be a homosexual'. Asked if he would be willing to cure himself of homosexuality, if such a thing was ever invented, Yiannopoulos replied "Well, it would be career suicide, but I probably would, yeah".&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rawstory.com/2015/10/comedian-explodes-on-self-loathing-gay-conservative-who-wants-to-be-straight-face-it-you-are-gay-as-fck/|title=Comedian explodes on 'self-loathing' gay conservative who wants to be straight: Face it, 'you are gay as f*ck!'|website=www.rawstory.com|language=en-US|access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/10/02/gay-columnist-claims-he-would-cure-his-homosexuality-if-he-could/|title=Gay columnist claims he would 'cure' his homosexuality if he could|work=PinkNews|access-date=13 January 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 he criticised [[Pope Francis]] for his [[Religious liberalism|liberalism]] in areas such as reaching out to gay people, adding that the best media advice he could give to Francis would be "stop talking". In the interview he reiterated his belief that [[Homosexuality and the Catholic Church|homosexuality is a sin]] and condemned those (including [[Clergy#Catholicism|clergy]]) who sought to change [[Dogma in the Catholic Church|Church dogma]] on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2017/10/14/16468878/milo-yiannopoulos-trash-talks-pope-in-catholic-magazine-interview|title=Milo Yiannopoulos trash-talks pope in Catholic magazine interview|date=14 October 2017|work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kevin D. Williamson]] in the ''[[National Review]]'' argued that "Milo Yiannopoulos of Breitbart London has done more to put [[Camp (style)|homosexual camp]] in the service of right-wing authoritarianism than any man has since the fellows at [[Hugo Boss#History|Hugo Boss]] sewed all those nifty SS uniforms."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nationalreview.com/article/432876/donald-trump-white-working-class-dysfunction-real-opportunity-needed-not-trump Chaos in the Family, Chaos in the State: The White Working Class’s Dysfunction]", ''[[National Review]]'', 28 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminism, freedom of speech and the "No Platform" policy ===

The  [[No Platform]] policy of the UK's [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] is intended to protect campuses from "individuals or members of organisations or groups identified by the Democratic Procedures Committee as holding racist or fascist views".&lt;ref name="NoPlatformGuardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/06/free-speech-milo-yiannopoulos-alt-right-far-right|title=There must be free speech, even for Milo Yiannopoulos|last=d'Ancona|first=Matthew|date=6 February 2017|work=The Guardian|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nusconnect.org.uk/pageassets/about/democraticprocess/NUS_Articles_Rules_Aug12.pdf |title=site @ NUS connect |website=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=15 February 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105032545/http://www.nusconnect.org.uk/pageassets/about/democraticprocess/NUS_Articles_Rules_Aug12.pdf |archivedate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yiannopoulos and feminist [[Julie Bindel]] were scheduled to participate in October 2015 in the [[University of Manchester]] Free Speech and Secular Society's debate "From liberation to censorship: does modern feminism have a problem with free speech?". However, the [[University of Manchester Students' Union|Students' Union]] banned first Bindel, then also Yiannopoulos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/7/milo-yiannopoulos-julie-bindel-banned-from-uk-univ|title=Milo Yiannopoulos, Julie Bindel banned from U.K. university's debate on censorship|work=The Washington Times|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union cited Bindel's [[Feminist views on transgender topics|comments on transgender women]] and Yiannopoulos' opinions on [[rape culture]] and stated that both breached the Union's [[safe-space]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Julie Bindel|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/09/no-platform-universities-julie-bindel-exclusion-anti-feminist-crusade|title=No platform: my exclusion proves this is an anti-feminist crusade|work=The Guardian|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manchesterstudentsunion.com/articles/updated-statement-from-the-students-union-05-10-2015|title=UPDATED Statement from the Students' Union 05.10.2015 @ University of Manchester Students' Union|publisher=Manchesterstudentsunion.com|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yiannopoulos was scheduled to talk at [[Bristol University]] the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Churchill |first1=L. |title=Controversial Bristol talk by Milo Yiannopoulos could be turned into a debate |url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Controversial-Bristol-talk-Milo-Yiannopoulos/story-28062876-detail/story.html |accessdate=17 December 2015 |work=Bristol Post |date=27 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201083659/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Controversial-Bristol-talk-Milo-Yiannopoulos/story-28062876-detail/story.html |archivedate=1 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After protesters attempted to have him banned from the university, the event became a debate between Yiannopoulos and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' blogger and feminist Rebecca Reid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hunter|first1=Daniel|title=Milo Yiannopoulos v Rebecca Reid: What happened in last week's debate|url=http://thetab.com/uk/bristol/2015/12/04/overview-milo-yiannopoulos-vs-rebecca-reid-debate-21925|accessdate=17 December 2015|publisher=The Tab|date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yiannopoulos has frequently written articles that have been criticised as [[misogynous]]. In a ''Breitbart'' article titled, "Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy", he asserts that the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] causes women to become [[Female hysteria|hysterical]], [[sexually promiscuous]] and [[obese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sherman|first1=Elisabeth|title=Birth control makes women unattractive, says Alt-Right gay icon Milo|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/pictures/10-most-despicable-stories-breitbart-published-under-bannon-w452226/birth-control-makes-women-unattractive-says-alt-right-gay-icon-milo-w452236|website=Rollingstone.com|publisher=Rolling Stone Magazine|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been credited as the author of other controversial articles about women, such as "The Solution To Online 'Harassment' Is Simple: Women Should Log Off" which focuses on gender-based online harassment and stalking and "The Left's Bloody War on Women: Sending Chicks into Combat Betrays Men, Women and Civilization", which criticises the involvement of women in the military.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In January 2018, Yiannopoulos reported a fictitious news story, written by a spoof news-site, as being true. The article claimed that an English High Court had ruled that the [[National Health Service]] was legally obliged to offer [[Pap test|cervical smear tests]] to men. Unaware that the story of was made up, Yiannopoulos argued that the story exemplified the thinking of those living in 'feminist clown world'. Before reading out the article verbatim, Yiannopoulos insisted that he had researched the story and promised that 'this is real, I haven't just made this up'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/canterbury/news/kent-contraversialist-falls-for-spoof-158592/|title=Kent 'celebrity' mocked for falling for spoof news article|last=|first=|date=16 Jan 2018|work=Kent Online|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Southend News Network|title=Milo Yiannopoulos falls for our FAKE news story LIVE ON AIR|date=17 January 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FncNrlxxMUk|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twitter controversies and permanent ban===
In December 2015, Twitter briefly suspended Yiannopoulos' account after he changed his profile to describe himself as [[BuzzFeed]]'s "social justice editor."&lt;ref name="unverified"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/twitter-unverifies-milo-yiannopoulos-leading-to-speech-polic|title=Twitter Unverifies Writer Amid Speech Wars|website=BuzzFeed|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Twitter account's blue "verification" checkmark was removed by the site the following month.&lt;ref name="unverified"/&gt; Twitter declined to give an explanation for the removal of verification, saying that they do not comment on individual cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/twitter-refuses-say-why-it-has-punished-uk-journalist-removing-verified-status|title=Twitter refuses to say why it has punished UK journalist by removing 'verified' status|work=Press Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some news outlets speculated that Yiannopoulos had violated its speech and harassment codes, as with an instance where he told another user that they "deserved to be harassed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recode.net/2016/1/10/11588646/can-twitter-police-the-madness-on-its-platform-the-fallout-from-the|title=Can Twitter 'Police the Madness' on Its Platform?

=== Alleged support for paedophilia===
In February 2017, it was announced that Yiannopoulos would address the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] (CPAC). A conservative website, ''Reagan Battalion,'' then posted video of 2015 and 2016 clips of [[YouTube]] interviews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2017/02/21/the-96-hours-that-brought-down-milo-yiannopoulos|title=The 96 hours that brought down Milo Yiannopoulos|first1=Abby|last1=Ohlheiser|first2=Abby|last2=Ohlheiser|date=21 February 2017|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/milo-yiannopoulos-resigns-from-breitbart-news/2017/02/21/0217c128-f7cc-11e6-be05-1a3817ac21a5_story.html|title=Breitbart's Milo Yiannopoulos resigns following outrage over his past comments about pedophilia|last=Farhi|first=Paul|date=20 February 2017|work=The Washington Post|access-date=29 August 2017|issn=0190-8286|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221221043/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/milo-yiannopoulos-resigns-from-breitbart-news/2017/02/21/0217c128-f7cc-11e6-be05-1a3817ac21a5_story.html|archivedate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the request of a 16-year-old Canadian student who was opposed to Yiannopoulos' CPAC address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lopez|first1=German|title=Meet the 16-year-old Canadian girl who took down Milo Yiannopoulos|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/24/14715774/milo-yiannopoulos-cpac-pedophile-video-canada|accessdate=5 March 2017|work=Vox|date=24 February 2017|quote=But it started when a 16-year-old high school student in Canada decided Yiannopoulos was embraced much too closely by mainstream conservatives.

In the interview in a January 2016 episode of the podcast ''[[The Drunken Peasants (podcast)|Drunken Peasants]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Drunken Peasants|title=Milo Yiannopoulos|url=https://www.youtube.com/embed/azC1nm85btY?hd=1&amp;iv_load_policy=3|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yiannopoulos stated that sexual relationships between 13-year-old boys and adult men and women can "happen perfectly consensually", because some 13-year-olds are, in his view, sexually and emotionally mature enough to consent to sex with adults; he spoke favourably both of gay 13-year-old boys having sex with adult men and straight 13-year-old boys having sex with adult women.&lt;ref name="db"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tw"/&gt; He used his own experience as an example, saying he was mature enough to be capable of giving consent at a young age.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/cpac-milo-yiannopoulos-pedophilia.html|title=CPAC Blasted for Milo Yiannopoulos Invite After Pedophilia Remarks Resurface|last=Hartmann|first=Margaret |work=New York|access-date=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that "[[paedophilia]] is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13 years old, who is sexually mature" but rather that "paedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty."&lt;ref name="db"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/02/20/cpac-disinvites-milo-yiannopoulos-despite-his-attempt-at-contrition.html|title=CPAC Disinvites Milo Yiannopoulos, Despite His Attempt at Contrition|author1=Jackie Kucinich|author2=Asawin Suebsaeng|date=20 February 2017|work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/milo-yiannopoulos-denies-defending-pedophilia-video-jake-tapper|title=Milo Yiannopoulos Denies Defending Pedophilia; Jake Tapper Condemns|date=20 February 2017|website=Thewrap.com|accessdate=21 February 2017|via=video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the interview, after his previous comments received some pushback from the hosts, he stated: "I think the [[age of consent]] law is probably about right, that is probably roughly the right age ... but there are certainly people who are capable of giving consent at a younger age, I certainly consider myself to be one of them."&lt;ref name="db"/&gt;

Yiannopoulos subsequently held a press conference, at which he said he had been the victim of child abuse, and that his comments were a way to cope with it. He declined to identify his abusers or discuss the incidents in any detail. He characterised his comments as the "usual blend of British sarcasm, provocation and gallows humour", and dismissed the allegation that he endorses [[child sexual abuse|child molestation]]. He alleged the video had been edited to give a misleading impression.&lt;ref name="BBC News 21 February 2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-39026870|title=Milo Yiannopoulos: Who is the alt-right writer and provocateur?|date=21 February 2017|website=[[BBC News Online]]|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News 21 February 2017 - 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-39037244|title= Milo Yiannopoulos dropped over paedophilia comments|date=21 February 2017|website=[[BBC News Online]]|publisher= BBC|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yiannopoulos stated that; "I will not apologise for dealing with my life experiences in the best way that I can, which is humour. No one can tell me or anyone else who has lived through sexual abuse how to deal with those emotions. But I am sorry to other abuse victims if my own personal way of dealing with what happened to me has hurt you."&lt;ref name=GuardianPedophilia/&gt;

Media personalities across the political spectrum condemned Yiannopoulos's original comments, and interpreted them as an endorsement of sexual abuse;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservatives Finally Condemn Milo Yiannopoulos over Pedophilia|url=http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Conservatives-Finally-Condemn-Milo-Yiannopoulos-over-Pedophilia-20170220-0012.html|website=teleSUR|accessdate=22 February 2017|date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CPAC withdrew Yiannopoulos's invitation to speak at their annual event because he had "condoned pedophilia" through his comments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/milo-yiannopoulos-disinvited-cpac-pedophilia-comments-article-1.2977414|title=Milo Yiannopoulos disinvited from CPAC after pedophilia comments|website=Nydailynews.com|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that his apology was inadequate.&lt;ref name="BBC News 21 February 2017 - 2"/&gt; Editorials in conservative media, including ''[[National Review]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/445080/cpac-milo-yiannopoulos-invitation-disgraceful-mistake|title=CPAC's Milo Disgrace|website=Nationalreview.com|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Blaze]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/02/19/video-surfaces-of-milo-yiannopoulos-defending-pedophilia-acu-board-reportedly-not-consulted-on-cpac-invite/|title=Video surfaces of Milo Yiannopoulos defending pedophilia, ACU board reportedly not consulted on CPAC invite|date=19 February 2017|website=Theblaze.com|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Townhall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2017/02/20/on-cpac-and-milo-n2288317|title=Whoa: Milo Now OUT at CPAC Because of THIS Shocking Video|first=Guy|last=Benson|website=Townhall.com|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/milo-cpac-welcomes-pederasty-advocate|title=CPAC Welcomes Pederasty Advocate|website=Theamericanconservative.com|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; have characterised his comments as supportive of paedophilia or [[pederasty]].

Throughout the controversy, Yiannopoulos was criticised for [in his words] attending Hollywood "boat parties" and "house parties" in which boys he described as "very young - ''very'' young" were sexually abused, but failing to report the abusers to the authorities or to identify them during an appearance on ''[[The Joe Rogan Experience]]''.&lt;ref name="duke"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Duke |first1= Selwyn |title= Milo's Seeming Support for Man-Boy Love Is Worse Than the Inaction That Undid Paterno |url= http://observer.com/2017/02/breitbart-milo-yiannopoulos-joe-rogan-podcast-child-sex-abuse |accessdate= 22 April 2017 |work= Observer |location= New York |date= 21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 March, an additional video emerged in which Yiannopoulos said on a 2015 episode of [[Gavin McInnes]]' show that child sexual abuse is "really not that big a deal. You can't let it ruin your life." He mocked child sexual-abuse victims by calling them "whinging selfish brats" for "suddenly" remembering they were abused, and "suddenly" deciding it was a problem, 20 years after the abuse occurred. He also stated that a disproportionate number of paedophiles are homosexual.&lt;ref name=whinging&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strudwick|first1=Patrick|title=Milo Yiannopoulos Calls Abuse Victims "Whinging, Selfish Brats" In A Newly Emerged Video|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/patrickstrudwick/milo-yiannopoulos-described-sexual-abuse-victims-as-whinging|accessdate=8 October 2017|publisher=BuzzFeed News|date=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Association with the alt-right ===
Yiannopoulos is commonly associated with the [[alt-right]].&lt;ref name="StandardWhoIs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/who-is-milo-yiannopoulos-everything-you-need-to-know-about-donald-trumps-altright-poster-boy-a3404921.html|first=Phoebe|last=Luckhurst|date=25 November 2016|publisher=the Evening Standard|website=standard.co.uk|title=Who is Milo Yiannopoulos?

But I'm very pro-Iraq, I'm very pro-Israel. There are all sorts of points of difference, I think".&lt;ref name="Chan4HtSt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://heatst.com/culture-wars/no-longer-alt-right-milo-distances-himself-from-the-controversial-movement|title=Are You Alt-Right?

In a ''[[Breitbart]]'' article, Yiannopoulos and a co-author described the alt-right movement as "dangerously bright". The ''[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]'' claimed many of these intellectual backers write for publications ''Tablet'' describes as racist and antisemitic, like [[VDARE]] and ''[[American Renaissance (magazine)|American Renaissance]]''.&lt;ref name=Kirchick/&gt; The Breitbart article was criticised by opponents of the alt-right for excusing the extremist elements of the movement, and also by the neo-Nazi website ''[[The Daily Stormer]]'' which holds that racism and antisemitism are pillars of the alt-right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hankes|first1=Keegan|title=Whose Alt-Right Is It Anyway?|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/08/25/whose-alt-right-it-anyway|accessdate=18 September 2016|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anti-Defamation League]] classifies Yiannopoulos as part of the [[alt-lite]]; a term used to distinguish individuals sometimes associated with the alt-right from those who are openly [[white nationalist]] and [[anti-semitic]].&lt;ref name="adl_alt-lite"&gt;{{cite web|title=From Alt Right to Alt Lite: Naming the Hate|url=https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/from-alt-right-to-alt-lite-naming-the-hate|website=adl.org|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ziv|first=Stav|url=http://www.newsweek.com/alt-right-or-alt-lite-new-guide-adl-classifies-right-wing-activists-639158|title='Alt-right' or 'alt-lite'?

A ''[[The Daily Beast|Daily Beast]]'' article in September 2016 suggested that Yiannopoulos has received funding from [[virtual reality]] tycoon [[Palmer Luckey]].&lt;ref&gt;Resnick, Gideon, and Collins, Ben. [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/22/palmer-luckey-the-facebook-billionaire-secretly-funding-trump-s-meme-machine.html "Palmer Luckey: The Facebook Near-Billionaire Secretly Funding Trump's Meme Machine"], ''The Daily Beast'', 22 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, during an interview with BBC, Yiannopoulos argued that the alt-right was primarily concerned with 'immigration, trade and political correctness and free speech generally'. Yiannopoulos suggested that the alt-right takes a number of different forms, from 'classical-liberals, disaffected leftists, ordinary conservatives, and this new young very energised, trolly, mischievous youthful contingent that has suddenly become interested in politics again, and that's the wing that I am most closely associated with, because that's the most exciting bit'. Yiannopoulos described this contingent of the alt-right as 'sort of unstoppable at the moment' and 'the bit of the movement that will win'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/election-us-2016-37905652/alt-right-is-unstoppable-says-milo-yiannopoulos|title='Alt-right is unstoppable,' says Milo|last=|first=|date=|website=BBC News|access-date=8 January 2018}} (The interview was published several days earlier, in October 2016, on Yiannopoulos's personal YouTube account)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leaked Breitbart emails ===
In early October 2017, [[BuzzFeed News]] published leaked email chains from Yiannopoulos' tenure at Breitbart. According to the report, Yiannopoulos and his ghostwriter Allum Bokhari regularly solicited ideas for stories and comments from people associated with the [[alt-right]] and [[neo-Nazi]] movements.&lt;ref name="KaraokeForNeoNazis"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Joseph|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/heres-how-breitbart-and-milo-smuggled-white-nationalism|title=Alt-White: How the Breitbart Machine laundered Racist Hate|work=[[BuzzFeed News]]|date=5 October 2017|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the figures Yiannopoulos contacted were [[Curtis Yarvin]], a central figure of the [[neoreactionary]] movement; [[Devin Saucier]], the editor of the white supremacist magazine ''[[American Renaissance (magazine)|American Renaissance]]''; [[Andrew Auernheimer]], the administrator of neo-Nazi website ''[[The Daily Stormer]]''; and [[Baked Alaska (entertainer)|Baked Alaska]], a commentator known for his anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi tweets.&lt;ref name="KaraokeForNeoNazis"/&gt; Yiannopoulos also was in contact and received suggestions and texts from individuals in "traditionally liberal professions" such as entertainment and media. Mitchell Sunderland from [[Vice News]] emailed Yiannopoulos a link to an article by [[Lindy West]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', and requested: "Please mock this fat feminist."&lt;ref name="KaraokeForNeoNazis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Cohen|date=6 October 2017|title=Seattle feminist writer was served up as target for Breitbart|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Seattle-s-Lindy-West-was-served-up-as-target-for-12259646.php|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also included a video of Yiannopoulos singing "[[America the Beautiful]]" at a [[karaoke]] bar, where a crowd of neo-Nazis and white supremacists, including Saucier and [[Richard B. Spencer]], cheered him with the Nazi [[sieg heil]] salute.&lt;ref name="KaraokeForNeoNazis"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nazisalutingaudience&gt;{{cite news|first=Roland|last=Oliphant|date=6 October 2017|title=Milo Yiannopoulos 'sang karaoke to Nazi-saluting audience'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/06/milo-yiannopolous-sang-karaoke-nazi-saluting-audience/|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yiannopoulos has subsequently claimed that he did not see the Nazi salutes while he was singing, citing what he claimed to be "extreme [[near-sightedness|myopia]]".&lt;ref name="KaraokeForNeoNazis"/&gt; According to the bartender who was working on the night of the incident, Yiannopoulos, Richard Spencer and their entourage came into the bar and asked to sing karaoke even though it had ended. When the bartender saw the Nazi salutes she rushed the stage and told Yiannopoulos and his friends to leave, at which point they began harassing her, chanting "Trump! Trump! Trump!" and "[[Make America Great Again]]!" According to her, Yiannopoulos was getting the others "aroused". The group left after the bartender's coworkers backed her up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Stephen|title=Meet the Dallas Bartender Who Kicked Milo Yiannopoulos and Some Neo-Nazis Out of Her Bar|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/news/interview-with-bartender-who-kicked-milo-yiannopoulos-out-of-karaoke-9948271|accessdate=8 October 2017|work=Dallas Observer|date=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story also reported that Yiannopoulos had a penchant for using personal passwords with [[antisemitism|anti-semitic]] overtones, such as "Kristall", a reference to [[Kristallnacht]], a [[pogrom]] the Nazis initiated against Jews in 1938, and "longknives1290", a compound reference to the [[Night of the Long Knives]] (another Nazi massacre), and 1290, the year of the [[Edict of Expulsion]], by which [[Edward I of England]] expelled all Jews from his kingdom.&lt;ref name="KaraokeForNeoNazis"/&gt; 

In 2018, Yiannopoulos bragged on Instagram and Facebook that he donated $14.88 to Talia Lavin, a Jewish journalist.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Nick R (June 24, 2018) [https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/06/24/milo-yiannopoulos-tried-troll-jewish-journalist-nazi-symbols-it-backfired-him "Milo Yiannopoulos tried to troll a Jewish journalist with Nazi symbols but it backfired on him."] Southern Poverty Law Center.

[[PayPal]] and the PayPal-owned [[Venmo]] subsequently suspended his account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=PayPal suspends Milo Yiannopoulos over Nazi-based trolling of Jewish journalist |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/paypal-suspends-milo-yiannopoulos-over-nazi-based-trolling-of-jewish-journalist/ |accessdate=3 July 2018 |work=The Times of Israel |date=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence against journalists===
On 26 June 2018, reports surfaced that Yiannopoulos had told at least two news organisations who had requested comments, that he wanted vigilantes to shoot journalists. According to a reporter for the ''[[New York Observer]]'', he wrote in a text message "I can't wait for vigilante squads to start gunning journalists down on sight".&lt;ref name=Fleishman&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fortune.com/2018/06/26/milo-yiannopoulos-jokes-of-death-squads-murdering-journalists/ | title=Milo Yiannopoulos Jokes of Death Squads Murdering Journalists | work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] | date=June 26, 2018 | accessdate=June 28, 2018 | last=Fleishman | first=Glenn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Neiwert&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/06/27/milo-wants-vigilantes-start-killing-journalists-and-hes-not-being-ironic | title=Milo wants vigilantes to start killing journalists, and he's not being 'ironic' | work=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] | date=June 27, 2018 | accessdate=June 28, 2018 | last=Neiwert | first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, following a [[Capital Gazette shooting|shooting at the ''Capital Gazette'']] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] in which five people were killed, Yiannopoulos denied that his comments were responsible, adding that his remarks were a joke.&lt;ref name=Fink&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newsweek.com/milo-yiannopoulos-responds-annapolis-capital-gazette-shooting-vigilantes-1000641 | title=Milo Yiannopoulos Responds To Annapolis Capital Gazette Shooting: Vigilantes Shooting Journalists Comment Was A Joke | work=[[Newsweek]] | date=June 28, 2018 | accessdate=June 28, 2018 | last=Fink | first=Jenni}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later posted on [[Instagram]] that he sent the messages to troll journalists.&lt;ref name=Estepa&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/06/28/milo-yiannopoulos-confirms-his-gunning-down-journalists-comments/743561002/ | title=13  Milo Yiannopoulos called for 'gunning journalists down on sight,' says it was 'private joke' | work=[[USA Today]] | date=June 28, 2018 | accessdate=June 28, 2018 | last=Estepa | first=Jessica}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Facebook]] he wrote "You’re about to see a raft of news stories claiming that I am responsible for inspiring the deaths of journalists." and "The truth, as always, is the opposite of what the media tells you."&lt;ref name=Greenwood&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thehill.com/homenews/media/394715-milo-yiannopoulos-my-call-for-shooting-journalists-was-just-a-troll | title=Milo Yiannopoulos: My call for shooting journalists was just a 'troll' | work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] | date=June 28, 2018 | accessdate=June 28, 2018 | last=Greenwood | first=Max}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WESH-180628&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wesh.com/article/milo-yiannopoulos-vigilante-squads-hurting-journalists-before-annapolis-shooting/21992535 | title=Milo Yiannopoulos joked about ‘vigilante squads’ hurting journalists days before Annapolis shooting | work=[[WESH]] | date=June 28, 2018 | accessdate=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, following several instances in which [[October 2018 United States mail bombing attempts|pipe bombs had been sent to prominent Trump critics]], Yiannopoulos posted the following comment on [[Instagram]]: “Just catching up with news of all these pipe bombs. Disgusting and sad (that they didn’t go off, and the daily beast didn’t get one)". After initially refusing to remove the comment when it was reported as hate speech, Instagram later deleted the post. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://boingboing.net/2018/10/26/milo-yiannopoulos-says-on-inst.html|title=Milo Yiannopoulos says on Instagram that it's "disgusting and sad" that  pipe bombs didn't kill intended victims / Boing Boing|website=boingboing.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18024748/instagram-milo-yiannopoulos-bomb-post-journalists-violence|title=Instagram deletes Milo Yiannopoulos bomb post after struggling to enforce its own guidelines|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
Yiannopoulos was twice featured in ''[[Wired UK]]'s'' yearly top 100 most influential people in Britain's digital economy: at 84 in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wired 100 2011 |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/06/the-wired-100/wired-100-2011-100-80/page/2|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=15 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913050135/http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/06/the-wired-100/wired-100-2011-100-80/page/2|archivedate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at 98 in 2012.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite news|last=Hicks|first=Jennifer|title=Digital Media's Citizen Kane|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferhicks/2012/12/19/digital-medias-citizen-kane/|accessdate=6 November 2015|work=Forbes|date=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wired 100 2012|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2012/07/features/wired-100-the-list/page/3|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=15 October 2014|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921091952/http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2012/07/features/wired-100-the-list/page/3 |archivedate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, he was called the "pit bull of tech media" by Ben Dowell of ''[[The Observer]]''.&lt;ref name="dowell"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dowell|first=Ben|title=Milo Yiannopoulos&amp;nbsp;– meet the 'pit bull' of tech media|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/08/milo-yiannopoulos-kernel-technology-interview|accessdate=29 August 2015|work=The Observer|location=London|date=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charity work==
In 2009, Yiannopoulos organised the London Nude Tech Calendar, which is a [[calendar]] featuring members of the London technology scene for the purpose to raise money for an organisation called Take Heart India.&lt;ref name=calendar&gt;{{cite news|last=Arthur|first=Charles|title=London Nude Tech calendar: unclothed geeks (and lady-geeks) in a good cause |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/nov/18/london-nude-tech-calendar-buy|accessdate=8 July 2012|work=The Guardian|date = 18 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yiannopoulos hosted an event known as the [[Young Rewired State]] competition in 2010, which is an initiative to showcase the technological talents of 15–18-year-olds.&lt;ref name=msn&gt;{{cite news|title=Techno teens design public websites|url=http://tech.uk.msn.com/news/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=149577772|accessdate=8 July 2012|publisher=[[MSN]]|date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
{{expand section|date=March 2018}}

=== Abortion ===
Yiannopoulos is opposed to abortion. He is quoted as saying:

{{blockquote|text=It isn't just the woman's body when she becomes pregnant. She's responsible for another body, another soul, another human being. That woman has sole custody. As a gay person, I have to be against abortion because as soon as they start working out what the [[gay gene]] is, it's us that are going to get chopped because nobody wants a gay kid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MItchell|first1=Aric|title=Milo Yiannopoulos: 'As A Gay Person, I Have To Be Against Abortion'|url=https://www.inquisitr.com/3288554/milo-yiannopoulos-as-a-gay-person-i-have-to-be-against-abortion/|accessdate=March 4, 2018|publisher=[[Inquisitr]]|date=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Atheism ===
Milo Yiannopoulos has [[Criticism of atheism|criticised atheism]] in several interviews and videos.&lt;ref name="Hussein2017"/&gt; In a discussion with [[Joe Rogan]], Yiannopoulos blasted what he saw as the "dreary hell of the atheist art scene" in comparison to [[St. Peter's Basilica]] or the [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque|Blue Mosque]].&lt;ref name="YiannopoulosRogan2017"&gt;{{Citation|title=Joe Rogan VS Milo Yiannopoulos: Atheism debate|date=4 August 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_AyO-N3CbI|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further stated: "I feel sorry for people who have this sort of bleak empty existence of militant atheism. It's just so boring."&lt;ref name="YiannopoulosRogan2017"/&gt;
===British politics===
Yiannopoulos was originally an outspoken supporter of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2017/02/i-knew-milo-yiannopolous-before-he-was-just-milo/|title=I Knew Milo Yiannopolous Before He Was Just ‘Milo’|date=3 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but applied to join [[UKIP]] in June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BkVkTnag9hS/|title=MILO on Instagram: “I’ve joined UKIP”|website=Instagram}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Walker |first1=Peter |title=Ukip's new guard: web agitators threaten to swamp struggling party |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/29/ukips-new-guard-web-agitators-threaten-to-swamp-struggling-party |accessdate=29 June 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity ===
Milo Yiannopoulos has preached that "Christmas and Christianity are worth fighting for".&lt;ref name="Milo2016"&gt;{{Citation|title=MILO: Catholics Are Right About Everything
|date=15 December 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5q4u1nE6tI|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has stated that the [[Protestant work ethic]] was necessary for [[capitalism]] to develop and that [[Christianity]] gave Western Civilisation education and the concept of consensual marriage.&lt;ref name="Milo2016"/&gt; With regard to the origin of modern science, Milo Yiannopoulos has stated that "It was Christianity that prompted man to look around at the world and say this marvellous and beautiful creation of the Lord is something that God did so it must be worth us taking a look and seeing how it works. Christianity gave birth to modernity."&lt;ref name="Milo2017"&gt;{{Citation|title=MILO vs Kind Atheist|date=14 December 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AnUJYPPWXc|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reference to his [[Christianity and homosexuality]], Milo Yiannopoulos has stated that:&lt;ref name="Milo2017"/&gt;

{{quote|At a time when the state was murdering homosexuals, the Catholic Church was welcoming them and sheltering them as priests and giving them a chance to be something in the community and not be ostracized or murdered or discriminated against. The trade-off was you couldn't get married, but the Catholic Church was providing homosexuals not just with sanctuary but with an important function in civilisation.&lt;ref name="Milo2017"/&gt;}}

=== Climate change ===
During an interview with [[Joe Rogan]], in 2015, Yiannopoulos said that "I don't believe in [[Scientific opinion on climate change|man-made climate change]] at all." During the same interview Yiannopoulos claimed that while working for a "climate change NGO," he witnessed "papering over of data ... I saw people omitting data sets that didn't fit with their hypothesis ... and I came to believe that the whole thing was a crock of shit and I left."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Climate Realists of Five Dock, Sydney Australia|title=Milo Yiannopoulos on why he doesn't believe in man made climate change|date=6 September 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMVkyfOdfD0|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Donald Trump ===
Yiannopoulos is a supporter of [[Donald Trump]]. He has been compared to [[Ann Coulter]] and referred to as the "face of a political movement," but he says his real concern is "pop culture and free speech." As he states: "I don't care about politics, I only talk about politics because of Trump."&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt;

However, following Trump's decision to [[2017 Shayrat missile strike|attack a Syrian air base]] in April 2017, Yiannopoulos distanced himself from the President, stating that the missile strike was "the opposite of why people voted for him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/exclusive-milo-yiannopoulos-breaks-with-trump-on-syria-not-why-people-voted-for-daddy/|title=Milo Yiannopoulos Breaks With Trump on Syria: 'Not Why People Voted for Daddy'|last=Levine|first=Jon|accessdate=29 April 2017|website=Mediaite.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sentiment was shared by a sizeable part of Trump's online supporters including Ann Coulter and [[Mike Cernovich]], who was the first to report on the impending attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/trump-alt-right-syria-war-214998|title=Trump's Troll Army Isn't Ready for War in Syria: The alt-right crowd breaks with the president.|last=Schreckinger|first=Ben|date=7 April 2017|website=Politico.com|access-date=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, Yiannopoulos claimed that he was a “significant factor” in the election of Donald Trump as US President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/milo-yiannopoulos-turns-on-alt-right-fans-6sbd2sjmb|title=Milo Yiannopoulos turns on his alt-right fans|last=Technology Correspondent|first=Mark Bridge|date=2018-08-27|work=The Times|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/world/milo-yiannopoulos-says-he-has-lost-literally-millions-of-dollars-on-events-that-went-on-to-be-cancelled/|title=Milo Yiannopoulos says he has lost ‘literally millions of dollars’ on events that went on to be cancelled|date=2018-08-26|work=inews.co.uk|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dangerous Faggot Tour==
In late 2015, Yiannopoulos began a campus speaking tour called "The Dangerous Faggot Tour", encompassing universities in the United States and Great Britain. Although most of his American speeches were not cancelled, many were met with notable protest ranging from vocal disruptions to violent demonstrations. The journalist Audrey Goddard analysed his speech at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], concluding that Yiannopoulos spends the "majority of the time voicing his opinions with little to no factual statements accompanying them", which Goddard determined was ironic taking in account how Yiannopoulos repeatedly insisted "that he was just stating 'facts'."&lt;ref name="The Tab Pitt 2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=I fact checked Milo Yiannopoulos' speech and it was nonsense|last=Goddard|first=Audrey|work=The Tab Pitt|date=8 April 2016|url=http://thetab.com/us/pitt/2016/04/08/fact-checked-milo-yiannopoulos-speech-nonsense-944|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DePaul University===
On 24 May 2016 Yiannopoulos's speech at the [[DePaul University]], a Roman Catholic school, was interrupted after about 15 minutes by two protesters who rushed the stage: DePaul alumnus and pastor Edward Ward, and student Kayla Johnson.&lt;ref name="Depaulia1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moore|first1=Brenden|last2=Kirsten|first2=Onsgard|title=Students call for end to hate speech at Yiannopoulos protest|url=http://depauliaonline.com/2016/05/25/depaul-yiannopoulos-protest-hate-speech|accessdate=15 June 2016|publisher=The DePaulia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Depaulia2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krupp|first1=Emma|last2=Onsgard|first2=Kirsten|last3=Paras|first3=Matthew|title=Protesters shut down Yiannopoulos speech|url=http://depauliaonline.com/2016/05/24/depaul-protesters-shut-down-yiannopoulos|accessdate=31 January 2017|publisher=The DePaulia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crowd overwhelmingly began booing the two protesters, at one point chanting "Get a job." The campus security team that university administrators required the College Republicans to hire the day before (at an extra cost of $1,000, part of which was paid by Yiannopoulos himself), reportedly made no effort to remove the protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/05/28/did-this-professor-resign-rather-than-listen-to-politically-incorrect-speaker.html|title=Trump troll Popularized by PC Mob|last=Soave|first=Robby|date=28 May 2016|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2016/05/24/watch-moment-blm-protesters-interrupt-milo-yiannopoulos-event-and-see-how-security-responds|title=Watch Moment BLM Protesters Interrupt Milo Yiannopoulos Event – and See How Security Responds|work=The Blaze|date=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in addition to further protests outside the event venue both before and after the event, which featured students reacting violently to Yiannopoulos's supporters.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dailycaller.com/2016/05/24/video-depaul-university-descends-into-chaos-over-milo-yiannopoulos-visit|title=DePaul University Descends Into Chaos over Milo Yiannopoulos Visit|last=Neff|first=Blake|date=24 May 2016|via=video|work=[[The Daily Caller]]|access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the incident, university president [[Dennis H. Holtschneider]] issued a statement reaffirming the value of free speech and apologising for the harm caused by Yiannopoulos's appearance on the campus. Attendees of the talk, organised by DePaul's College Republican's Chapter, criticised university police and event security for not removing the protesters.&lt;ref name="suntimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Esposito|first1=Stefano|title=DePaul Republicans in spotlight after controversial speaker visit|url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/depaul-republicans-spotlight-controversial-speaker|accessdate=15 June 2016|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Dodge, John|title=DePaul President Apologizes After Conservative Forum Disrupted By Protesters|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2016/05/25/depaul-president-apologizes-after-conservative-forum-disrupted-by-protesters|website=chicago.cbslocal.com|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160526102748/http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2016/05/25/depaul-president-apologizes-after-conservative-forum-disrupted-by-protesters|archivedate=26 May 2016|date=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 January 2017, Yiannopoulos spoke at the [[University of Washington]].

On 1 February 2017, Yiannopoulos was scheduled to make a speech at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] at 8:00&amp;nbsp;pm. More than 100 UC Berkeley faculty had signed a petition urging the university to cancel the event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/us/university-california-berkeley-free-speech-milo-yiannopoulos.html "A Free Speech Battle at the Birthplace of a Movement at Berkeley"], ''New York Times'', 2 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Over 1,500 people gathered to protest against the event on the steps of Sproul Hall, with some violence occurring.&lt;ref name="UCBerkeleyNews"&gt;{{cite news|title=Milo Yiannopoulos event canceled after violence erupts|url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/02/01/yiannopoulos-event-canceled/|accessdate=2 February 2017|work=UC Berkeley News|date=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Troll Academy – Australian tour ==
In November 2017 Yiannopoulos began a tour of Australia, with talks scheduled to be given in number of cities, including: [[Sydney]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Melbourne]]. The exact location of the talks were kept secret until shortly before the events were due to start.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/05/milo-yiannopoulos-speaks-australia-respectable-racists-howl-approval|title=Milo Yiannopoulos speaks, and Australia's respectable racists howl their approval|last=|first=|date=4 December 2017|website=The Guardian|access-date=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These speaking events were interspersed with TV and Press interviews.

=== Adelaide ===
On 1 December 2017, Yiannopoulos held an event in Adelaide. His talk included projecting an unflattering photo of the feminist writer [[Clementine Ford (writer)|Clementine Ford]], taken when she was a teenager, with the words "UNFUCKABLE" superimposed over the top.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Melbourne ===
On 4 December 2017, Yiannopoulos held several events at the Melbourne Pavilion. During one of his talks he described [[Australian Aboriginal art]] as "crap" and "really shit".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Prior to the talk taking place, hundreds of protesters from the left-aligned [[Campaign Against Racism and Fascism]] and the right-wing [[True Blue Crew]] clashed outside the Melbourne event. Police in riot gear attended and two protesters — one from each side — were arrested for "discharging missiles".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/conservative-activist-avi-yemini-said-protests-outside-milo-yiannopoulos-speech-was-like-being-in-the-middle-east/news-story/439b7e5a6670f75661e940c9529cd572|title=Conservative activist Avi Yemini said protests outside Milo Yiannopoulos speech was like being in the Middle East|last=|first=|date=5 December 2017|website=|access-date=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the course policing the event, five officers suffered minor injuries, including one who was hit in the leg by a rock.

=== Sydney ===
On 5 December 2017, seven people were arrested after clashing with police and outside the venue for Yiannopoulos's Sydney event. Fans of Yiannopoulos were heckled by anti-fascist protesters who chanted: "Muslims are welcome, Milo is not," and "Nazi scum off our street". In response, Yiannopoulos blamed the "petulant babies" of the left for the clash. He went to say: "There was a lot of kerfuffle out front, it was not as the newspapers reported 'a clash between the far left and far right' it was the left, showing up, being violent to stop freedom of speech".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Earlier that day Yiannopoulos spoke at [[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] in Canberra, at the invitation of a [[Liberal Democratic Party (Australia)|Liberal Democratic Party]] senator, [[David Leyonhjelm]]. This event took place despite efforts by the [[Australian Greens]] party to ban him.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The talk was attended by approximately 150-200 people, with the majority of attendees comprising political staffers and media. Several members of the [[Pauline Hanson's One Nation|One Nation]] Party attended, including [[Pauline Hanson]], [[Brian Burston]], [[Peter Georgiou]] and [[Malcolm Roberts (politician)|Malcolm Roberts]]. Yiannopoulos urged his audience to reject identity politics and political correctness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/05/milo-yiannopouloss-sound-and-fury-fails-to-rouse-parliament-house|title=Milo Yiannopoulos's sound and fury fails to rouse Parliament House|last=|first=|date=5 December 2017|website=The Guardian|access-date=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
Yiannopoulos wrote introductions for the 2017 science fiction compilation ''Forbidden Thoughts'' and the [[Vox Day]] non-fiction release ''SJWs Always Lie: Taking Down the Thought Police''. He published two poetry books under the name Milo Andreas Wagner. His 2007 release ''Eskimo Papoose'' was later scrutinised for re-using lines from pop music and television without attribution, to which he replied that it was done deliberately and the work was satirical.&lt;ref name=poet/&gt;

===''Dangerous''===
{{Main|Dangerous (book)}}
An autobiography titled ''Dangerous'' was announced in December 2016. Yiannopoulos reportedly received a $250,000 advance payment from the book's planned publisher, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. It was intended to be published under their [[Threshold Editions]] imprint and to be issued on 14 March 2017, but Yiannopoulos pushed back the schedule to June so he could write about the demonstrations during his campus tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/simon-schuster-cancels-milo-yiannopoulos-book-170221045200392.html|title=Simon &amp; Schuster cancels Milo Yiannopoulos' book|date=21 February 2017|via=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day after its announcement, pre-sales for the book elevated it to first place on [[Amazon.com]]'s list of best-sellers.&lt;ref name=Darcy&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/milo-yiannopoulos-book-2016-12|title=Milo Yiannopoulos' just-announced book hits No. 1 on Amazon – here's our Q&amp;A with him|publisher=[[Business Insider]]|date=30 December 2016|accessdate=29 August 2017|last=Darcy|first=Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''molecular logic gate''' is a molecule that performs a logical operation based on one or more physical or chemical inputs and a single output. The field has advanced from simple logic systems based on a single chemical or physical input to molecules capable of combinatorial and sequential operations such as arithmetic operations i.e. '''moleculators''' and memory storage algorithms.

For logic gates with a single input, there are four possible output patterns. When the input is 0, the output can be either a 0 or 1. When the input is 1, the output can again be 0 or 1. The four output bit patterns that can arise corresponds to a specific logic type: PASS 0, YES, NOT and PASS 1. PASS 0 always outputs 0, whatever the input. PASS 1 always outputs 1, whatever the input. YES outputs a 1 when the input is 1 and NOT is the inverse YES – it outputs a 0 when the input is 1. An example of a YES logic gate is the molecular structure shown below. A "1" output is given only when sodium ions are present in solution ("1" input).

[[File:A YES molecular logic gate.png|225px|center|A YES molecular logic gate receptive to sodium ions]]

Molecular logic gates work with input signals based on [[chemical process]]es and with output signals based on [[spectroscopy]]. One of the earlier water solution-based systems exploits the chemical behavior of compounds '''A''' and '''B''' in ''scheme 1''.{{Ref|Silva}}

[[File:Moleculators de silva13 02.png|center|500px|Scheme 1. Molecular logic gates de Silva 2000]]

Compound A is a [[push-pull olefin]] with the top receptor containing four [[carboxylic acid]] anion groups (and non-disclosed counter cations) capable of binding to [[calcium]]. The bottom part is a [[quinoline]] molecule which is a receptor for hydrogen ions. The logic gate operates as follows.
Without any chemical input of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[chromophore]] shows a maximum [[absorbance]] in [[UV/VIS spectroscopy]] at 390 [[nanometer|nm]]. When calcium is introduced a [[blue shift]] takes place and the absorbance at 390&amp;nbsp;nm decreases. Likewise addition of protons causes a [[red shift]] and when both cations are in the water the net result is absorption at the original 390&amp;nbsp;nm. This system represents a [[XNOR]] logic gate in absorption and a [[XOR]] logic gate in [[transmittance]].

In compound '''B''' the bottom section now contains a [[tertiary amine|tertiary amino]] group also capable of binding to protons. In this system [[fluorescence]] only takes place when both cations available. The presence of both cations hinders [[photoinduced electron transfer]] (PET) allowing compound B to fluoresce. In the absence of both or either ion, fluorescence is quenched by PET, which involves an electron transfer from either the nitrogen atom or the oxygen atoms, or both to the anthracenyl group. When both receptors are bound to calcium ions and protons respectively, both PET channels are shut off. The overall result of Compound B is AND logic, since an output of "1" (fluorescence) occurs only when both Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are present in solution, that is, have values as "1". With both systems run in parallel and with monitoring of transmittance for system A and fluorescence for system B the result is a [[half-adder]] capable of reproducing the equation 1+1=2.

In a modification of system B not two but three chemical inputs are simultaneously processed in an AND logic gate.{{Ref|Silva2}} An enhanced [[fluorescence]] signal is observed only in the presence of excess protons, zinc and sodium ions through interactions with their respective  [[amine]], [[phenyldiaminocarboxylate]] and [[crown ether]] receptors. The processing mode operates similarly as discussed above – fluorescence is observed due to the prevention of competing photoinduced electron transfer reactions from the receptors to the excited anthracene fluorophore.  The absence of one, two or all three ion inputs results in a low fluorescence output.  Each receptor is selective for its specific ion as an increase in the concentration of the other ions does not yield a high fluorescence. The specific concentration threshold of each input must be reached to achieve a fluorescent output in accordance with combinatorial AND logic. This prototype could potentially be extended to point-of-care medical diagnostics application for disease screening in the future.

[[File:Three-input AND logic gate.png|350px|center|A three-input AND logic gate]]

In a similar set-up, the molecular logic gate illustrated below demonstrates the advancement from redox-fluorescent switches to multi-input logic gates with an electrochemical switch.{{Ref|Magri}} This two-input AND logic gate incorporates a tertiary amine proton receptor and a tetrathiafulvelene redox donor. These groups, when attached to anthracene can simultaneously process information concerning acid concentration and oxidizing ability of the solution.

[[File:Two-input AND molecular logic gate sensor for protons and electrons.png|175px|center|A two-input AND molecular logic gate sensor for protons and electrons]]

The INHIBIT logic gate illustrated below as provided by Gunnlaugsson et al. incorporates a Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion in a chelate complex.{{Ref|Gunnl}} This two-input logic gate is the first of its kind and displays non-commutative behaviour with chemical inputs and a phosphorescence output. Whenever dioxygen (input 1) is present, the system is quenched and no [[phosphorescence]] is observed (output 0). The second input, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, must also be present for an output "1" to be observed. This is understood from a two-input INHIBIT truth table.

[[File:INHIBIT molecular logic gate by Gunnlaugsson.png|175px|center|Two-input INHIBIT logic gate]]

In another XOR logic gate system the chemistry is based on the [[pseudorotaxane]]{{Ref|Credi}} depicted in ''scheme 3''. In organic solution the electron deficient [[pyrene|diazapyrenium]] salt (rod) and the electron rich 2,3-dioxy[[naphthalene]] units of the [[crown ether]] (ring) [[molecular self-assembly|self-assemble]] by formation of a [[charge transfer complex]].

An added [[tertiary amine]] like [[tributylamine]] forms a 1:2 adduct with the diazapyrene and the complex gets dethreaded. This process is accompanied by an increase in emission intensity at 343&amp;nbsp;nm resulting from freed crown ether. Added [[trifluoromethanesulfonic acid]] reacts with the amine and the process is reverted. Excess acid locks the crown ether by [[protonation]] and again the complex is dethreaded.

[[Image:RotaxaneLogicGate.png|center|300px|Scheme 3. Pseudorotaxane logic gate]]

A [[full adder]] system based on [[fluorescein]]{{Ref|Margulies}} is able to compute 1+1+1=3.

Molecular sequential logic is exemplified by D. Margulies et al., where they demonstrate a molecular keypad lock resembling the processing capabilities of an electronic security device which is equivalent to incorporates several interconnected AND logic gates in parallel.{{Ref|DMarg}} The molecule mimics an electronic keypad of an [[automated teller machine]] (ATM).  The output signals are dependent not only on the combination of inputs but also on the correct order of inputs: in other words the correct password must be entered. The molecule was designed using pyrene and fluorescein fluorophores connected by a siderophore, which binds to Fe(III), and the acidic of the solution changes the fluorescence properties of the fluorescein fluorophore.

Further development in this field might also see molecular logic gates replace semiconductors in the IT industry. Such molecular systems can theoretically overcome the problems arising when semiconductors approach nano-dimensions. Molecular logic gates are more versatile than their silicon counterparts, with phenomena such as superposed logic unavailable to semiconductor electronics. Dry molecular gates such as the one demonstrated by Avouris and colleagues prove to be possible substitutes for semiconductor devices due to their small size, similar infrastructure and data processing abilities. Avouris revealed a NOT logic gate composed of a bundle of carbon nanotubes. The nanotubes are doped differently in adjoining regions creating two complementary field effect transistors. The bundle operates as a NOT logic gate only when satisfactory conditions are met.

New potential applications of chemical logic gates continue to be explored. A recent study{{Ref|Ozlem}} illustrates the application of a logic gate for [[photodynamic therapy]]. A bodipy dye attached to a crown-ether and two pyridyl groups separated by spacers (as shown below) works according to an AND logic gate. The molecule works as a photodynamic agent upon irradiation at 660&amp;nbsp;nm under conditions of relatively high sodium and proton ion concentrations by converting triplet oxygen to cytotoxic singlet oxygen.  This prototypical example would take advantage of the higher sodium levels and lower pH in tumor tissue compared to the levels in normal cells. When these two cancer-related cellular parameters are satisfied, a change is observed in the absorbance spectrum. This technique could be useful for the treatment of malignant tumors as it is non-invasive and specific.

[[File:AND logic gate by Akkaya.png|225px|center|Two-input AND logic gate by Ozlem and Akkaya with photodynamic therapeutic applications]]

A molecular logic gate can processes modulators much like the set up seen in de Silva’s ‘Proof-of-principle’ but incorporating different logic gates on the same molecule. Such a function is called integrated logic and is exemplified by the BODIPY-based, half-subtractor logic gate illustrated by A. Coskun, E. U. Akkaya and their colleagues (as shown below).{{Ref|Coskun}} When monitored at two different wavelengths, 565 and 660&amp;nbsp;nm, XOR and INHIBIT logic gates are obtained at the respective wavelengths. Optical studies of this compound in [[THF]] reveal an absorbance peak at 565&amp;nbsp;nm and an emission peak at 660&amp;nbsp;nm. Addition of an acid results in a [[hypsochromic shift]] of both peaks as protonation of the tertiary amine results in an internal charge transfer. The colour of the emission observed is yellow. Upon addition of a strong base, the phenolic hydroxyl group is rendered deprotonated, resulting in a photoinduced electron transfer, which in turn renders the molecule non-emissive. Upon addition of both an acid and a base, the emission of the molecule is observed as red, as the tertiary amine would not be protonated while the hydroxyl group would remain protonated resulting in the absence of both PET and ICT. Due to the great difference in emission intensity, this single molecule is capable of carrying out an arithmetic operation; subtraction at a nanoscale level.

A '''monks bench''' or '''hutch table''' is a piece of furniture where a tabletop is set onto a chest in such a way that when the table was not in use, the top pivots to a vertical position and becomes the back of a [[Settle (furniture)|Settle]], and this configuration allows easy access to the chest lid which forms the seat of the piece.&lt;ref&gt;'''monks bench''' ([[British English]]) or '''hutch table''' ([[American English]])&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pearson|1985|p=39}}{{sfn|Carney|1950|p=97}} Percy Blandford notes that "whether monks ever used such a bench is debatable, but it is an attractive name".{{sfn|Blandford|p=132}}

A monks bench was a very useful form at a time when many homes had a large room used for multiple functions, because it allowed a large dining table to swing up and out of the way.{{sfn|Strickland|1953|p=165}}

'''Neoclassicism''' is a movement in architecture, design and the arts which was dominant in France between about 1760 to 1830. It emerged as a reaction to the frivolity and excessive ornament of the [[baroque]] and [[rococo]] styles. In architecture it featured sobriety, straight lines, and forms, such as the [[pediment]] and [[colonnade]], based on Ancient Greek and Roman models.  In painting it featured heroism and sacrifice in the time of the ancient Romans and Greeks. It began late in the reign of [[Louis Quinze|Louis XV]], became dominant under [[Louis XVI style|Louis XVI]], and continued through the [[French Revolution]], the [[French Directory]], and the reign of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], and the [[Bourbon Restoration]] until 1830, when it was gradually replaced as the dominant style by [[romanticism]] and [[eclecticism]].{{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=126}}

Prominent architects of the style included [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]] (1698-1782), [[Claude-Nicolas Ledoux]] (1736-1806) and [[Jean-François Chalgrin]] (1739-1811); painters included [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1748-1825) and his pupil, [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] (1780-1867).

==History==
Neoclassicism in France emerged in the early to mid-18th century, inspired in part by the reports of the archeological excavations at [[Herculaneum]] (1738) and especially [[Pompeii]] (1748), which brought to light classical designs and paintings. The news of these discoveries, accompanied by engraved illustrations, circulated widely.  The French antiquarian, art collector and amateur archeologist [[Anne Claude de Caylus]] travelled in Europe and the Mideast, and described what he had seen in ''Recueil d'antiquités'', published with illustrations in 1755.{{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=389}}

In the 1740s, the style began to slowly change;  decoration became less extravagant and more discreet.  In 1754 the brother of Madame de Pompadour, the Marquis de Marigny, accompanied the designer [[Nicolas Cochin]] and a delegation of artists and scholars to Italy to see the recent discoveries at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], and made a grand tour of other classical monuments.  They returned full of enthusiasm for a new classical style, based on the Roman and Greek monuments.  In 1754 they published a manifesto against the Rocaille style, calling for a return to classicism. Marigny, after the death of Louis XV, later became director of buildings for Louis XVI.{{Sfn|Wiegandt|2005|page=54}}

The style was given a philosophical appeal by the ''Philosophes'', including [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who called for a restoration of moral values in society, and by the Abbé Laugier, who wrote ''L'essai sur l'architecture'', a call for a return to pure and uncluttered forms of architecture.  The archeological sites in Greece and Italy became mandatory stops for aristocratic and scholarly visitors on the [[Grand Tour]] of Europe. The best young painters in France competed for scholarships to the French Academy in Rome. [[Ingres]] studied there, and later became its director. In 1757 the French architect Jean-François Neufforge published ''Recueil élémentaire d'architecture'', an illustrated textbook of the style. The new taste was originally called ''le goût grec'' (the Greek taste). It called for geometric forms and decoration in "the sober and majestic style of the architects of ancient Greece."{{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=128}}

In the last years of the reign of Louis XV and throughout the reign of Louis XVI, the new style appeared in the royal residences, particularly in the salons and furnishings of the Dauphine and then Queen [[Marie Antoinette]], and of the Paris aristocracy. It combined Greek, Roman, and what was loosely called ''Etruscan'' styles with [[arabesques]] and [[grotesques]] borrowed from [[Raphael]] and the Renaissance, and with [[chinoiserie]] and Turkish themes,  Between 1780 and 1792, the style also appeared in architecture, in classically buildings including the ''[[Petit Trianon]]'' in [[Versailles]] and the ''[[Château de Bagatelle]]'' (1777).  It also appeared in other art forms, including in particular the paintings of [[Jacques-Louis David]], especially the ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'' (1784).

==Architecture==
===Louis XIV, XV and Louis XVI===
[[Classicism]] appeared in French architecture during the reign of [[Louis XIV]].  In 1668 the king rejected a baroque design for [[Perrault's Colonnade|the new east facade]] of the [[Louvre]] by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], the most famous architect and sculptor of the [[Baroque]] era,  in favor of a more sober and classical design with pediments and colossal columns by [[Claude Perrault]]. Under Louis XIV, the Roman dome and facade of monumental columns became the dominant features of important new churches, beginning with the chapel of [[Val-de-Grâce (church)|Val-de-Grâce]] (1645-1710), by [[Hardouin Mansart|Mansart]], [[Jacques Lemercier]] and [[Pierre Le Muet]], followed by the church of [[Les Invalides]] (1680-1706).
While the basic features of the architecture of these churches were classical, the interiors were lavishly decorated in the baroque style.{{sfn|Ducher (1988) pg. 124}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In the latter part of the reign of [[Louis XV]], the neoclassical became the dominant style in both civil and religious architecture. The chief architect of the king was [[Jacques Gabriel]] from 1734 until 1742, and then his more famous son, [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]] until the end of the reign. His major works included the [[École Militaire]], the ensemble of buildings overlooking the Place Louis XV (now [[Place de la Concorde]] (1761-1770)) and the [[Petit Trianon]] at Versailles (1764).  Over the course of the reign of Louis XV, while interiors were lavishly decorated, the facades gradually became simpler, less ornamented and more classical. The facades Gabriel designed were carefully rhymed and balanced by rows of windows and columns, and, on large buildings like those the Place de la Concorde, often featured grand arcades on the street level, and classical pediments or balustrades on the roofline. Ornamental features sometimes included curving wrought-iron balconies with undulating rocaille designs, similar to the rocaille decoration of the interiors.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious architecture of the period was also sober and monumental and tended, at the end of the reign, toward neo-classical; major examples include the Church of Saint-Genevieve (now the [[Panthéon]]), built from 1758 to 1790 to a design by [[Jacques-Germain Soufflot]], and Church of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule (1765-1777) by [[Jean Chalgrin]], which featured an enormous barrel-vaulted nave.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During the reign of Louis XVI, neoclassical was the dominant architectural style in Paris and in the provinces. Notable examples include the [[Hotel de la Monnaie]] in Paris (1771–76) by [[Jacques Denis Antoine]], as well as the [[Palais de Justice, Paris|Palais de Justice]] in Paris by the same architect;  and the theater of Besançon (1775) and the [[Chateau de Benouville]] in the [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]], both by Ledoux. The [[École de Chirurgie]], or School of Surgery in Paris by [[Jacques Gondoin]] (1769) adapted the forms of the neoclassical town house, with a court of honor placed between a pavilion with a colonnade on the street and the main building. He also added a [[peristyle]] and another floor above the columns, and transformed the entrance to the courtyard into a miniature triumphal arch.&lt;ref&gt;Prina and Demartini (2006), pg. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

The new theaters in Paris and Bordeaux were prominent examples of the new style. The architect [[Victor Louis]] (1731-1811) completed the theater of Bordeaux (1780);  its majestic stairway was a forerunner of the stairway of the Paris [[Opera Garnier]].&lt;ref&gt;Prina and Demartini (2006), p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1791, in the midst of the [[French Revolution]], he completed the [[Comedie Francaise]].  The [[Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe|Odeon Theater]] in Paris (1779-1782) was built by [[Marie-Joseph Peyre]] (1730-1785) and [[Charles de Wailly]] (1729-1798).  It featured a portico in the form of a covered gallery and columns in advance of the facade.{{sfn|Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 77}}

One of the best-known neoclassical buildings of the period is the [[Chateau de Bagatelle]] (1777), designed and built by [[François-Joseph Bélanger]] for the Comte d'Artois, Louis XVI's brother. The small chateau was designed and completed in just sixty-three days, to win a bet with [[Marie Antoinette]] that he could build a chateau in less than three months.  Marie Antoinette had a similar small neoclassical belvedere created by architect [[Richard Mique]], who had also designed her picturesque rustic village in the gardens.  It was completed in 1789, the year of the French Revolution.
 
Another notable example of the neoclassical style in Paris is the [[Hôtel de Salm]] (now the [[Palais de la Légion d'Honneur]]), built by [[Pierre Rousseau]] in 1751-83.  The facade is distinguished by its simplicity and purity, and its harmony and balance. A colonnade of Corinthian columns supports the entablement of the rotunda, which is surmounted by statues.  The facade is also animated by busts of Roman emperors in niches, and sculptures in relief above the windows of the semicircular central [[avant-corps]].{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|pages=162-3}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
A few architects adapted the neoclassical style to more functional purposes. [[Claude-Nicolas Ledoux]] designed the [[Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans]]  with exaggerated neoclassical buildings arranged in circles around a central "temple", where the director's home and office was placed. He also designed several rotundas for the new customs barriers installed around Paris between 1785-89.  These barriers became highly unpopular (due to the taxes, not the architecture) and most were destroyed during the Revolution, though those at La Villette and Monceau still stand.{{Sfn|Toman|2007|pages=77-85}}

The most visionary French neoclassical architect was certainly [[Etienne-Louis Boullée]].  His designs for an immense spherical monument to Isaac Newton (1784) and a vast new royal library in Paris in the form of a giant barrel vault (1785) were never seriously considered, but foreshadowed the architecture of the 20th century.{{Sfn|Toman|2007|pages=84-86}}

===Revolution, Directorate and Empire===
During the French Revolution construction virtually stopped in Paris.  The aristocrats fled, churches were closed and sacked. The one large project carried out between 1795 and 1797 was the building of a large new chamber within the [[Palais Bourbon]], which eventually became the home of the French [[National Assembly]].  The [[École des Beaux-Arts]] was re-organized and reconstituted, with the architecture department under [[Quatremère de Quincy]] (1755-1849). De Quincy was an amateur archeologist and a classical scholar, as well as an architect. He was sentenced to death by a revolutionary court in 1793, but was spared by the downfall of Robespierre. He was charged with the conversion of the Church of Saint-Genevieve into the modern [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]], and assured that architectural studies taught the classical traditions.{{Sfn|Toman|2007|page=87}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
After [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] came to power,  the most influential architects were [[Charles Percier]] (1764-1838 and [[Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine]] (1762-1853).  Their grand projects for Napoleon included the [[Rue de Rivoli]], with its uniform neoclassical facades, modeled on the squares built by Louis XIV and Louis XV. They also designed the interior of the [[Château de Malmaison]], the residence of Napoleon, into the model of the neoclassical style. (1803) Fontaine designed another Napoleonic landmark, the [[Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel]] (1806-1808) in the courtyard of the Louvre.{{Sfn|Toman|2007|page=87}}

Other Napoleonic neoclassical projects included the grand stairway of the [[Luxembourg Palace]] (1801) by [[Jean Chalgrin]] (1801), and the [[Arc de Triomphe]] (begun by Chalgrin in 1808, but not finished until 1836).  Pierre-Alexandre Vignon (1763–1828), a student of Ledoux, was charged with remaking the [[Church of the Madeleine]], begun in 1761 but abandoned during the Revolution, into a "Temple of Glory" dedicated to Napoleon's army. This project was abandoned in 1813 after a series of defeats of Napoleon's army;  it became a church again, but was not completed until 1843.  Napoleon also added a neoclassical facade with twelve Corinthian columns to the facade of the [[Palais Bourbon]].  It was in an entirely different style than the palace behind it, and was not aligned with it; it was aligned instead with the new Temple of Glory (now the [[La Madeleine, Paris|Madeleine]])  which he was building, facing it, on the far side of the [[Place de la Concorde]].

===The Restoration and arrival or romanticism===
After the final defeat of Napoleon in 1815, the neoclassic style continued to be used during the [[French Restoration]], particularly in Paris churches. Examples include [[Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, Paris|Notre Dame de Lorette]] (1823-26) by [[Louis-Hippolyte Lebas]] and [[Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Paris|Saint-Vincent-de-Paul]] by [[Jacques-Ignace Hittorff]] (1824-44).

A change of style began to appear early in the 19th century, particularly after the publication in 1802 of ''le Génie du christianisme'' by one of the leading figures of French [[romanticism]], [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] (1768-1848). He appealed for a return to the [[Gothic style]], which, as the style of the great cathedrals, he considered was the only truly great French style. The movement toward romanticism and gothic was accelerated by the publication of the hugely successful novel ''[[Notre-Dame de Paris]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]] in 1821, and then the program of restoration of French Gothic monuments led by [[Prosper Mérimée]] and conducted by [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]] (1814-1879). This, along with the [[French Revolution of 1830]] brought to a close the era of French neoclassicism.{{Sfn|Toman|2007|page=101}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Painting==
The dominant figure in French neoclassical painting, even before the Revolution, was [[Jacques Louis David]] (1748-1825).  He began as a classical and religious painter, an admirer of [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]], the history and genre painter.  He was recommended to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts by a family friend, [[François Boucher]], master of the [[rococo]] style. He won the prestigious Prix de Rome and went to study there in 1775.  He discovered the treasures excavated from Pompeii and other ancient sites, and entirely changed his style.  Beginning in 1784 he painted works based on stories from classical literature, including ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'' (1781), a celebration of duty and sacrifice in Roman times.  When the [[French Revolution]] began in 1789, David became an active participant in the most extreme wing, the [[Jacobins]], He supported the dissolution of the Academy of Fine Arts, and designed sets for revolutionary pageants and ceremonies. His most famous picture of the period, ''Marat Assassiné'' (1793), adapted the facial expression and the limp arm of Christ in Michaelangelo's ''[[Pieta]]'' to depict the assassinated Jacobin leader, [[Jean Paul Marat]].  When the Jacobins fell in 1794, he was imprisoned twice for several months, but then resumed an active career as a portraitist and then as court painter for [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. When Napoleon fell and the monarchy was restored, he went into exile in Belgium.{{Sfn|Toman|2007|pages=367-79}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
French painting was dominated for years by David and his pupils, including [[Antoine-Jean Gros]] (1771-1835), and later [[Jean-Auguste Dominique Ingres]] (1780-1867). The later neoclassical painters put aside the political messages and concentrated on idealized figures and ideas of beauty;  they included [[François Gérard]], who like David, made a famous portrait of [[Madame Récamier]], much to the annoyance of David; [[Jean-Baptiste Regnault]] (1754-1829); [[Pierre-Paul Prud'hon]] (1758-1823); [[Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun]] (1755-1842) and [[Anne Louis Girodet-Trioson]] (1767-1824).{{Sfn|Toman|2007|pages=378-396}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Sculpture==
The most prominent French sculptor in the early neoclassical period was [[Étienne Maurice Falconet]] (1716-1791). whose work included the heroic statue of [[Peter the Great]] on horseback in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia  (model made in 1770, but not cast until 1782). He was named professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Paris in 1766, and from 1757 onward he directed the modeling of small sculptures in porcelain at the [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres|Sèvres Porcelain manufactory]]. His work remained closer to the statues in full movement of the French baroque than the new, more serene style. In his later years he designed small ornamental sculptures of cast bronze such as the ''Seated Girl'' (1788), now in the Metropolitan Museum.{{Sfn|Toman|2007|page=254}}

The first more clearly neoclassical major figure was [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]] (1741-1828).  He studied at the French Academy in Rome,where he made detailed studies of the anatomy of the ancient Roman and Greek statues on display there. He became famous for his busts and portrait sculptures, most notably his seated statue of [[Voltaire]] (1779-81), now on display at the [[Comedie Française]], and his busts of Benjamin Franklin and other political figures of the day. He also created several allegorical works illustrating winter and summer in a style entirely more expressive than traditional classicism, such as his ''La Frileuse'' (woman in winter), in the Musée Fabre in [[Montpellier]].{{Sfn|Toman|2007|pages=256-57}}

The sculptor [[Claude Michel]] (1738-1814), also known as [[Clodion]], also studied at the Academy in Rome between 1762 and 1771. His works varied widely from neoclassical to rococo; he conceived a terra-cotta model for an extraordinary monumental sculpture, covered with statuary of angels and cupids, to celebrate the first balloon flight in Paris (1784).

[[Augustin Pajou]] (1730-1809) also studied at the French Academy in Rome from 1752 and 1756.  He returned to Paris to teach at the Academy of Fine Arts, and became rector in 1792. He made a series of highly expressive statues on mythological subjects, including ''[[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche]]'' and ''Amour''.

==Interior decoration==
The ''goût Grec'' or "Greek taste" in design was introduced in France in 1757 by [[Jean-François de Neufforge]] in his book ''Recueil élémentaire d'architecture'', which praised "the majestic and sober style of the architects of ancient Greece."  He offered engravings of classical vaults, garlands of laurel leaves, palmettos and ''guilloches'' (braided interlaced ribbons) and other motifs which soon appeared in Paris salons.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, Noël, ''Grammaire des arts decoratifs''(2004), pg. 126 &lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1770s, the ''style pompéien'' or Pompeii style came into fashion in Paris, based on reproductions of designs found in Pompeii, augmented with [[arabesques]], [[griffin|griffons]], [[sphinxes]], horns-of-plenty and vases on tripods, interlaced with vines and medallions and painted on tall rectangular panels on the walls painted white and bordered with gilded stucco.  The new style also took inspiration from the decorative grotesques of [[Raphael]] painted at the Vatican in 1510. The boudoir of Marie-Antoinette at the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]], designed by Rousseau de la Routière in 1790, just after the Revolution began, is a notable example.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|pages=158-59}}

During the [[French Revolution]], the aristocracy fled Paris, and most of the palaces and town houses were stripped of furnishings and decoration. A new version of neoclassicism appeared briefly during the [[French Directorate]] (1795-99), which mingled elements the Pompeiian style with the [[Adam style]] from England.  When [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] seized power from the Directory, the neoclassical style began to take on a new form, called [[Empire Style]] (1799-1815).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Empire Style had extraordinary coherence and audacious simplicity, thanks to Napoleon's two energetic chief designers, [[Charles Percier]] (1764-1838) and [[Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine]] (1762-1853).  The motifs were usually symbols of empire, including crowns and laurel wreaths, medals, lyres, horns of plenty, and classical heads seen in profile. Rooms sometimes had the walls draped in fabric, representing the tents of an army on campaign.  Interiors and furniture often featured classical columns carved of wood.  Egyptian motifs and mythical beasts from antiquity, such as the [[sphinx]], [[griffon]] and the [[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]], were popular.  Imperial emblems, including the eagle, the bee, and the letter N with a crown, were also common.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 90 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Furniture==
The first "Greek taste" furniture in France, made in 1756 and 1757 to designs by [[Jean-François de Neufforge]] (1714-1791) and [[Jean-Charles Delafosse]] (1734-1791), was massive, rectangular and heavily decorated, with gilded columns, friezes and hanging garlands.  However, soon afterwards the royal cabinet maker [[Jean-Francois Oeben]] produced much lighter and more graceful works for [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] and [[Madame Pompadour]].  These were a hybrid of the curves of rococo with the right angles of neoclassicism. The chairs had curving ''à cabriolet'' legs and cartouche-shaped backs, combined with neoclassic garlands and friezes. Oeben refurnished Versailles and other royal palaces with innovative new kinds of furniture;  the cylinder, or roll-top desk; the table with a mechanical writing surface that could be raised; and the drop-front desk.{{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=130}}

After the death of Oeben, his place was taken by two of his disciples, [[Jean-Henri Riesener]] (1734-1806) (who married Oeben's widow); and [[Jean-François Leleu]].  Riesener and Leleu produced furniture with superb wood-inlay, or marquetry,  often in floral designs; and cabinets of mahogany decorated with glided bronze floral decor and column legs.{{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=130}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In [[Louis XVI furniture]], particularly in the 1780s, the furniture styles became lighter, more geometric, and more simply ornamented, following the tastes of [[Marie Antoinette]]. The leading French designers during this period were [[Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sené]] (1748-1803) and [[Georges Jacob]] (1739-1814).  At the very end of the reign of Louis XVI, Sené and Jacob were producing highly original and imaginative forms, including chairs with lyre-shaped carved wooden backs and the "Etruscan chair", a type conceived by the painter [[Hubert Robert]] for the fantasy "rural hamlet" of Marie-Antoinette at Versailles. The ornament on the chair, which remained popular long after the period ended, was borrowed from ancient Grecian vases.{{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=134}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The furniture craft was upended by the French Revolution; the aristocratic clients fled, and the furniture of the royal palaces was sold in enormous auctions; a large part went abroad.  One positive development for furniture-makers was the abolition of the old guild rules; after 1791 the makers of furniture frames could collaborate with those who did the marquetry inlay.  The Etruscan taste disappeared, but the neoclassic style flourished under the [[French Directory]] (1793-99), the [[French Consulate]] (1799-1804), and the Empire of Napoleon Bonaparte.

The last leading furniture designer for Louis XVI, Georges Jacob, formed a new firm with his two brothers, and, between 1796 and 1803,  became the most prominent designer of the later neoclassical period.  He made an effort to find classical forms that were more authentic.  The type of Greek chair called the ''klismos'' became especially popular; Jacob produced a variety of neoclassical divans and stools, as well as the ''Lit de Repos'', or day bed, which appeared in [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s portrait of [[Madame Recamier]].  Another popular form was the folding stool, modeled after those that were used in Roman army encampments.  After Napoleon's invasion of Egypt in 1798, Egyptian designs, in stylized geometric form, appeared on furniture.  Gilded bronze ornaments of extremely fine craftsmanship were made in Paris workshops and exported to the royal houses of Europe.  The continual European wars and blockades made it difficult to import exotic woods, and sometimes local woods such as lemon trees were used; mahogany remained the choice for prestige furniture. The master furniture craftsmen of the late Empire style included [[Bernard Molitor]], who made the furniture for the Chateau of Saint Cloud, and
the architects [[Charles Percier]] and [[Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine]], who made furniture as authentic as possible to Greek and Roman models for the residences of Napoleon and for clients of the new Napoleonic aristocracy.{{Sfn|Riley|2004|pages=136-137}}

A '''notified body''', in the [[European Union]], is an entity that has been accredited by a [[Member State of the European Union|Member State]] to assess whether a product to be placed on the market meets certain preordained [[Technical standard|standards]]. [[Conformance testing|Conformity assessment]] can include inspection and examination of a product, its design, and the manufacturing environment and processes associated with it.  For example, a notified body may designate that a [[medical device]] conforms to the E.U. [[Medical Devices Directive]], which defines the standards for medical devices. With this [[Certification mark|Declaration of Conformity]], the manufacturer can label the product with the [[CE Mark]], which is required for distribution and sale in the E.U. Additionally, the E.U. member state accrediting the notified body will then inform the [[European Commission]] that the product complies with set standards (or not).&lt;ref name="ECBlue14"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/12661/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/native |format=PDF |title=The 'Blue Guide' on the Implementation of EU Product Rules |publisher=European Commission |edition=1.1 |pages=134 |date=15 July 2015 |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/goods/building-blocks/notified-bodies/index_en.htm |title=Notified bodies |work=Growth: Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs |publisher=European Commission |date=11 February 2016 |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rudd-ClarkeAProd15"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.insiderquarterly.com/a-product-of-our-times |title=A product of our times |author1=Rudd-Clarke, P. |author2=Page, F. |journal=Insider Quarterly |issue=Winter 2015 |date=9 December 2015 |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, a notified body is an independent, accredited body which is entitled by an authorized [[Accreditation|accrediting]] body. Upon definition of standards and regulations, the accrediting body may allow a notified body to provide verification and certification services.

The notified bodies system used by the European Union has been publicly criticized in some capacity since at least 2008&lt;ref name="NoetelConform08"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euroshnet-conference.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/content/3_Cracow-2008/7-Noetel-Confomity_assessment-en.pdf |format=PDF |title=Conformity assessment and notified bodies |author=Noetel, K.-H. |publisher=European Conference on Standardization, Testing and Certification |date=11 September 2008 |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChowdhuryEuro14"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzS5BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99 |chapter=Chapter 6: Case Study on Medical Devices Regulation in Europe |title=European Regulation of Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals: Regulatee Expectations of Legal Certainty |author=Chowdhury, N. |publisher=Springer International Publishing Switzerland |location=Cham, Switzerland |year=2014 |pages=99–120 |isbn=9783319045948 |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MaxwellTight09"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clinica.co.uk/policyregulation/regulation/Tightening-oversight-of-notified-bodies-enough-to-satisfy-critics-181589 |title=Tightening oversight of notified bodies: Enough to satisfy critics? |author=Maxwell, A. |work=Clinica |publisher=Informa PLC |date=30 November 2009 |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ShurenFDA12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Testimony/ucm297418.htm |title=FDA User Fee Agreements: Strengthening FDA and the Medical Products Industry for the Benefit of Patients (JS) |author=Shuren, J. |work=Testimony |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=29 March 2012 |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ParaviciniBreast15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.eu/article/eu-consumer-product-lax-certifiers-of-breast-implant-diesel-engines-notified-bodies/ |title=Breast implant, diesel cases expose lax EU oversight |author=Paravicini, G. |work=Politico |publisher=Politico SPRL |date=11 December 2015 |accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for issues such as:

* "a lack of uniformity in certification procedures and in the application of harmonised standards";&lt;ref name="NoetelConform08" /&gt;
* "the varying levels of expertise among notified bodies,"&lt;ref name="ShurenFDA12" /&gt; including "differences in test results";&lt;ref name="NoetelConform08" /&gt; and
* "encouraging 'forum shopping' by sponsors to identify those notified bodies with the most lax operating standards."&lt;ref name="ShurenFDA12" /&gt;

Discussion of further expanding coordination groups of notified bodies for different product areas, improving marketing surveillance, and making participation in standardization and coordination activities mandatory began within E.U. member states.&lt;ref name="NoetelConform08" /&gt; However, more criticism would arise out of the [[Poly Implant Prothèse]] (PIP) [[Poly Implant Prothèse#Scandal|scandal]] in early 2010, when media revealed that the French manufacturer of [[silicone gel]] [[breast implant]]s had been using unapproved in-house manufactured industrial-grade instead of [[Medical grade silicone|medical-grade silicone]] for most of its implants. Investigators also brought criticism down on notified body [[TÜV Rheinland]] for issuing a certificate of quality for a production process that didn't include the in-house industrial-grade silicone. However, TÜV stated "its remit was to check the production process, not the content of the silicone."&lt;ref name="ChowdhuryEuro14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LoveFrance11"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-breast-implants-idUSTRE7BM14420111224 |title=France, UK issue clashing advice on breast implants |author1=Love, B. |author2=Flynn, D. |work=Reuters |publisher=Thomson Reuters |date=23 December 2011 |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revelation had a ripple effect, causing both more criticism about the responsibilities of notified bodies and the regulatory process in general and more corrective action. The Central Management Committee was created in September 2010 "to develop the effectiveness of the regulatory system on medical devices in the E.U. by improving decision making among the national regulatory authorities."&lt;ref name="ChowdhuryEuro14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ClementFull10"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qmed.com/consultants/full-manufacturer-addresses-medical-device-labels |title=Full Manufacturer Addresses on Medical Device Labels? |author=Clement, R. |work=Consultants Corner |publisher=UBM Canon |date=November 2011 |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in February 2012, European Health and Consumer Policy Commissioner John Dalli called upon E.U. member states to take a hard look at the regulatory system, including how notified bodies play a part. His recommendations included properly verifying whether a notified body is capable of accurately assessing medical devices, improving how conformity assessments are conducted, and developing tools to enhance medical device [[traceability]].&lt;ref name="EisenhartTighter12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emergogroup.com/blog/2012/02/tighter-eu-regulatory-controls-proposed-following-pip-controversy |title=Tighter EU Regulatory Controls Proposed following PIP Controversy |author=Eisenhart, S. |work=Emergo Blog |publisher=Emergo Group |date=13 February 2012 |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission acted, that September revealing its proposed changes to medical device regulation, including expanded requirements on notified bodies, to be published in 2014 and go into effect in 2017.&lt;ref name="EisenhartOver12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emergogroup.com/blog/2012/10/overview-new-medical-device-regulations-europe |title=Overview of new medical device regulations in Europe |author=Eisenhart, S. |work=Emergo Blog |publisher=Emergo Group |date=23 October 2012 |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Commission also opted to instate additional reforms — separate from its draft regulations — that would go into effect much sooner, asking notified bodies to perform unannounced visits to manufacturers and expand their device testing standards. At the same time the NB-MED (European Forum of Notified Bodies Medical Devices) coordination revised their Code of Conduct due to criticism.&lt;ref name="ChowdhuryEuro14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EisenhartEuro12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emergogroup.com/blog/2012/11/european-commission-plans-greater-oversight-notified-bodies |title=European Commission Plans Greater Oversight of Notified Bodies |author=Eisenhart, S. |work=Emergo Blog |publisher=Emergo Group |date=30 November 2012 |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2013 and early 2014, a French court ordered (and later upheld its decision) that notified body TÜV Rheinland pay [[restitution]] to those affected by the PIP scandal.&lt;ref name="MontensPIP14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=28a21496-a3d9-4b05-8a13-fa3027f826c8 |title=PIP breast implants patients obtain a first 5,000,000 Euro victory against the Notified Body TUV Rheinland |author1=Montens, E. |author2=Plasschaert, E. |work=Lexology |publisher=Globe Business Publishing Ltd |date=22 May 2014 |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this decision and a similar case in Germany has created questions about how much liability should be applied to notified bodies for patient devices found to be dangerous despite previous notified body assessment. The German case against TÜV was dismissed initially and on appeal in district and regional courts, and an appeal to a German federal court resulted in referral of the case to the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] (CJEU) for clarification "on three issues on the interpretation of the Medical Devices Directive."&lt;ref name="CarbonnelleMedical15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twobirds.com/en/news/articles/2015/global/life-sciences-newsletter-june/medical-device-liability-update |title=Medical device liability update |author1=Carbonnelle, N. |author2=Martens, M.-P. |author3=Goraya, T. |work=Bird &amp; Bird News Centre |publisher=Bird &amp; Bird |date=2 July 2015 |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the original restitution decision by French courts was appealed and overturned on July 2, 2015, forcing affected patients to return their interim compensation, leaving many patients without recourse.&lt;ref name="CarbonnelleMedical-2_15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=1219c1ad-910a-4ce3-ae04-bb638f1da089 |title=Medical devices liability update |author1=Carbonnelle, N. |author2=Martens, M.-P. |author3=Thiénot, J.-B. |author4=Goraya, T. |work=Lexology |publisher=Globe Business Publishing Ltd |date=17 November 2015 |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|February 2016}}, the German case is ongoing, waiting for CJEU input. Rudd-Clarke and Page postulated in December 2015 that if "the CJEU decides that notified bodies are under a duty to protect patients, the practical effects could be that the CE certification process slows down, which is likely to have a detrimental impact on the cost for manufacturers of getting a product to market, while notified bodies may face a significantly increased [[litigation]] risk for failure to comply with their duties."&lt;ref name="Rudd-ClarkeAProd15" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4050">The term "'''object-based language'''" may be used in a technical sense to describe ''any'' [[programming language]] that uses the idea of encapsulating state and operations inside [[object (computer science)|"objects"]]. Object-based languages need not support [[inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]] or [[subtype|subtyping]], but those that do are also said to be [[object-oriented programming|"object-oriented"]]. Object-based languages that do not support inheritance or subtyping are usually not considered to be true object-oriented languages.

Examples of [[object-oriented programming language|object-oriented languages]], in rough chronological order, include [[Simula]], [[Smalltalk]], [[C++]] (whose object model was based on Simula's), [[Objective-C]] (whose object model was based on Smalltalk's), [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], [[Xojo]] (previously REALbasic), [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Visual Basic .NET]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], and [[Fortran 2003]]. Examples of a language that is object-based, but not object-oriented are early versions of [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Visual Basic]] (VB), and [[Fortran 90]]. These languages all support the definition of an object as a data structure, but lack polymorphism and inheritance.

In practice, the term "object-based" is usually applied to those object-based languages that are not also object-oriented, although all object-oriented languages are also object-based, by definition. Instead, the terms "object-based" and "object-oriented" are normally used as mutually exclusive alternatives, rather than as categories that overlap.

Sometimes, the term "object-based" is applied to [[prototype-based languages]], true object-oriented languages that do not have classes, but in which objects instead inherit their code and data directly from other "template" objects. An example of a commonly used prototype-based [[scripting language]] is [[JavaScript]].

Both object-based and object-oriented languages (whether class-based or prototype-based) may be [[Static typing|statically type-check]]ed. Statically checking prototype-based languages can be difficult, because these languages often allow objects to be dynamically extended with new behavior, and even to have their parent object (from which they inherit) changed, at run time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wegner|first=Peter|title=Dimensions of Object-Based Language Design|journal=OOPSLA'87 Conference Proceedings|date=December 1987|volume=22|issue=12|pages=168--182|editor1-first=Norman|editor1-last=Meyrowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barbey|first=S |author2=M.

An '''operational system''' is a term used in [[data warehousing]] to refer to a system that is used to process the day-to-day transactions of an organization. These systems are designed in a manner that processing of day-to-day transactions is performed efficiently and the integrity of the transactional data is preserved.
== Synonyms ==
Sometimes operational systems are referred to as [[operational database]]s, [[transaction processing system]]s, or [[online transaction processing]] systems (OLTP). However, the use of the last two terms as synonyms may be confusing, because operational systems can be [[batch processing]] systems as well.

Any enterprise must necessarily maintain a lot of data about its operation.

'''Peer-to-peer carsharing''' (also known as '''person-to-person carsharing''' and '''peer-to-peer car rental''') is the process whereby existing car owners make their vehicles available for others to rent for short periods of time.

Peer-to-peer [[carsharing]] is a form of [[person-to-person lending]] or [[collaborative consumption]], as part of the [[sharing economy]]. The business model is closely aligned with traditional car clubs such as [[Streetcar_(carsharing)|Streetcar]] or [[Zipcar]], but replaces a typical fleet with a ‘virtual’ fleet made up of vehicles from participating owners. With peer-to-peer carsharing, participating car owners are able to charge a fee to rent out their vehicles when they are not using them. Participating renters can access nearby and affordable vehicles and pay only for the time they need to use them.

Businesses within this sector screen participants (both owners and renters) and offer a technical platform, usually in the form of a website and mobile app, that brings these parties together, manages rental bookings and collects payment. Businesses take between 25%&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.relayrides.com/entries/21078886-What-will-I-earn-How-do-I-get-paid- What will I earn?

Although many personal auto insurers in the U.S. exclude coverage for commercial use of insured vehicles either through a livery and public transportation exclusion or a specific "personal vehicle sharing program" exclusion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irmi.com/online/prmi/ch006/1l06j000/al6j1400.aspx International Risk Management Institute - Personal Vehicle Sharing Program Exclusion Endorsement]&lt;/ref&gt; several states in the U.S. have passed legislation allowing individuals to share their cars without risk of losing their personal car insurance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shareable.net/blog/californias-p2p-car-sharing-bill-signed-into-law California's P2P Car-sharing Bill Signed Into Law - Shareable&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As with person-to-person lending, the Internet and the adoption of [[location-based service]]s have contributed to the growth of peer-to-peer carsharing.

{{For|the company|Pico Technology}}
The term '''picotechnology''' is a [[portmanteau]] of [[picometer]] and [[technology]], intended to parallel the term [[nanotechnology]]. It is a hypothetical future level of technological manipulation of matter, on the scale of trillionths of a meter or picoscale (10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;12&lt;/sup&gt;). This is three orders of magnitude smaller than a [[nanometer]] (and thus most [[nanotechnology]]) and two orders of magnitude smaller than most [[chemistry]] transformations and measurements. Picotechnology would involve the manipulation of matter at the [[atom]]ic level. A further hypothetical development, [[femtotechnology]], would involve working with matter at the subatomic level.

==Applications==
Picoscience is a term used by some [[future studies|futurists]] to refer to structuring of matter on a true picometer scale. Picotechnology was described as involving the alteration of the structure and chemical properties of individual atoms, typically through the manipulation of energy states of electrons within an atom to produce metastable (or otherwise stabilized) states with unusual properties, producing some form of [[exotic atom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Rakesh |last1=Sharma1 |first2=Avdhesh |last2=Sharma |first3=Ching J. |last3=Chen |date=14 November 2011 |url=http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4525/version/1 |title=Emerging Trends of Nanotechnology towards Picotechnology: Energy and Biomolecules |work=[[Nature Precedings]] |doi=10.1038/npre.2010.4525.1 |accessdate=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analogous transformations known to exist in the real world are [[redox chemistry]], which can manipulate the [[oxidation states]] of atoms; excitation of electrons to metastable [[excited state]]s as with [[laser]]s and some forms of [[saturable absorption]]; and the manipulation of the states of excited electrons in [[Rydberg atom]]s to encode information. However, none of these processes produces the types of exotic atoms described by futurists.

Alternatively, picotechnology is used by some researchers in [[nanotechnology]] to refer to the fabrication of structures where atoms and devices are positioned with sub-nanometer accuracy. This is important where interaction with a single atom or [[molecule]] is desired, because of the strength of the interaction between two atoms which are very close. For example, the force between an atom in an [[atomic force microscope]] probe tip and an atom in a sample being studied varies [[exponential function|exponentially]] with separation distance, and is sensitive to changes in position on the order of 50 to 100 picometers (due to [[Pauli exclusion]] at short ranges and [[van der Waals force]]s at long ranges).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3136">The '''PowerCube''' is a multiple [[electrical socket]] adaptor manufactured by the Allocacoc Corporation in Shanghai, China. Unlike a conventional [[power strip]], the device is arranged like a cube, which can solve the problem of multiple [[AC adapter]]s fighting for space.

==History==
The PowerCube was created by two graduates of industrial design engineering at the [[Delft University of Technology]] (TU) in the Netherlands. They noticed that people had problems using conventional multi-socket adaptors and started a company, [[Allocacoc]] in 2011, to produce an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techworld.com/review/accessories/allocacoc-powercube-humble-powerstrip-reinvented-3542158/|title=Allocacoc PowerCube – the humble powerstrip reinvented|first=John|last=Dunn|work=Tech World|date=1 September 2014|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The PowerCube is a cubic shaped power socket equipped with multiple sockets. This allows differently shaped [[AC adapter]]s to be plugged in next to each other, which is not necessarily possible on a conventional powerboard due to shape and geometry.&lt;ref name=techly/&gt; A typical scenario may be a [[laptop]], a [[tablet computer]] and multiple [[smartphone]]s charging simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/gadgets/allocacoc-powercube-reisetaugliche-mehrfachsteckdose-im-test-a-986937.html|title=Reisetaugliche Mehrfachsteckdose im Test: Dieser Würfel teilt gern|first=Matthias|last=Kremp|newspaper=Der Spiegel|language=de|date=21 August 2014|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device is available in several different modules, including an optional extension cord and [[USB]] outlet, and catering for the target country's appropriate power supply.

Several magazines criticised the PowerCube for its lack of a suitable [[surge protection]], noting that the device has been manufactured solely for convenience.&lt;ref name=techly/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2361841/powercube-extended-usb-review-quirky-and-efficient-but-no-surge-protection.html|title=PowerCube Extended USB review: Quirky and efficient, but no surge protection*|first=Michael|last=Brown|work=PC World|date=11 June 2014|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This issue has been addressed and surge protection is now offered in the PowerCube Range, 2016.

==Awards==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2015}}
The PowerCube has won several awards:
* The PowerExtension was in the MKB Innovation top 100  at the fifth place in 2014
* [[Red Dot Design Award]] 2014&lt;ref name=techly&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.techly.com.au/2015/03/24/powercube-solving-issue-bad-powerboards/|title=PowerCube – solving the problem of bad powerboards?|first=Tristan|last=Rayner|work=Techly|date=24 March 2015|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13860">A '''power take-off''' or '''power takeoff''' ('''PTO''') is any of several methods for taking power from a power source, such as a running [[engine]], and [[power transmission#Mechanical power|transmitting]] it to an application such as an attached implement or separate machines.

Most commonly, it is a [[spline (mechanical)|splined]] [[drive shaft]] installed on a [[tractor]] or [[truck]] allowing implements with mating fittings to be powered directly by  the engine.

Semi-permanently mounted power take-offs can also be found on industrial and marine engines. These applications typically use a drive shaft and [[bolted joint]] to transmit power to a secondary implement or accessory. In the case of a marine application, such shafts may be used to power fire pumps.

In [[aircraft]] applications, such an '''[[accessory drive]]''' may be used in conjunction with a [[constant speed drive]].  Jet aircraft have four types of PTO units: internal gearbox, external gearbox, radial drive shaft, and bleed air, which are used to power engine accessories. In some cases, aircraft power take-off systems also provide for putting power ''into'' the engine during engine start. See also [[Coffman starter]] &lt;ref name=X29PTO&gt;NASA Technical Memorandum 101731; Monitoring Techniques for "X-29A Aircraft's High Speed Rotating Power Takeoff Shaft"; David F Voracek, Ames Research Center, Dryden Flight Research Facility, Edwards, California, December 1990 [www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/pdf/88209main_H-1680.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zapfwelle eines Traktors - power take-off of a tractor.jpg|thumb|A PTO at the rear end of a farm [[tractor]]]]
[[File:A Tractor's rear.jpg|thumb|A PTO (in the box at the bottom) in between the [[three-point hitch]] of a tractor]]

==History==
Various power transmission methods were available before power takeoffs became common, but there were applications left wanting for some of the attributes that PTOs would provide. [[Belt (mechanical)#Flat belts|Flat belts]] generally lent themselves only to applications where the engine was [[wikt:stationary#Adjective|stationary]], such as factory [[steam engine]]s, [[portable engine|portable stationary engine]]s, or [[traction engine]]s parked in front of the work. For moving vehicles such as a [[traction engine]] or early [[tractor]] towing a [[list of agricultural machinery|farm implement]], the implement could receive rotary power by taking it from one of its own wheels (whose turning was imparted by the towing) and distributing it via roller chains (to a [[mower#Sickle mower|sickle bar]]'s crank, for example), but such a transmission ceases if the vehicle stops traveling; and the workload's resistance tends to make the wheel skid rather than turn, even if [[grouser|cleated]]. The concept of a shaft drive with easily connected and disconnected couplings, and flexibility for driving at changing angles (such as when an articulated tractor-and-trailer combination turns), was a goal to pursue.

Experimental power take-offs were tried as early as 1878, and various homemade versions arose over the subsequent decades. [[International Harvester]] Company (IHC) was first to market with a PTO on a production tractor, with its model 8-16, introduced in 1918.&lt;ref name="PrippsMorland1993pp37-39"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pripps|Morland|1993|pp=37–39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward A. Johnston, an IHC engineer, had been impressed by a homemade PTO that he saw in France about a decade before, improvised by a French farmer and mechanic surnamed Gougis.&lt;ref name="PrippsMorland1993pp37-39"/&gt; He and his IHC colleagues incorporated the idea into the 8-16, and designed a family of implements to take advantage of the feature. IHC was not alone in the market for long, as within a year PTOs were appearing on other production tractors, such as some [[Case Corporation|Case]] models. In 1920, IHC offered the PTO option on their 15-30 tractor, and it was the first PTO-equipped tractor to be submitted for a [[Tractor#Nebraska tractor tests|Nebraska tractor test]]. The PTO was a competitive advantage for IHC in the 1920s, and other companies eventually caught up with PTO implementation.

Inside the [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], the exact point along the [[gear train]] where the power is taken off determines whether the PTO can be run independently of vehicle travel ([[ground speed]]). Early PTOs were often taken off the main output shaft, meaning that the vehicle had to be "in gear" in order to run the PTO. Later this was improved by so-called '''live PTO''' (LPTO) designs, which allow control of the PTO rotation independently of the tractor motion. This is an advantage when the load driven by the PTO requires the tractor motion to slow or stop running to allow the PTO driven equipment to catch up. It also allows operations where the tractor remains parked, such as silo-filling or unloading a manure spreader to a pile or lagoon rather than across a field. In 1945, [[Cockshutt Plow Company|Cockshutt Farm Equipment Ltd]] of [[Brantford]], Ontario, Canada, introduced the Cockshutt Model 30 tractor with LPTO. Most PTOs built today are live. In modern tractors, LPTO is often controlled by push-button or selector switch. This increases safety of operators who need to get close to the PTO shaft.

==Safety==
[[File:TractorPTOshaftMay04.jpg|thumb|Protective plastic sheath enshrouding a PTO]]

The PTO and its associated shafts and [[universal joint]]s are a common cause of incidents and injury in farming and industry. According to the [[National Safety Council]], 6 percent of tractor related fatalities in 1997 in the United States involved the PTO. Incidents can occur when loose clothing is pulled into the shaft, often resulting in [[bone fracture]]s, [[amputation|loss of limb]], or death to its wearer. On April 13, 2009 former Major League Baseball star [[Mark Fidrych]] [[Mark Fidrych#Death|died as a result of a PTO related accident]]; "He appeared to have been working on the truck when his clothes became tangled in the truck's power takeoff shaft", District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said in a statement.&lt;ref name=espn-fidrych&gt;{{cite web|title=Examiner: Fidrych suffocated to death|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4073519|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=7 January 2014|date=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some implements employ light free-spinning protective plastic guards to enshroud the PTO shaft, and are mandatory in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;

==Technical standardization==
Agricultural PTOs are [[Standardization|standardized]] in dimensions and speed. The [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard for PTOs is ''ISO 500'', which as of the 2004 edition was split into three parts:
#''ISO 500-1'' General specifications, safety requirements, dimensions for master shield and clearance zone
#''ISO 500-2'' Narrow-track tractors, dimensions for master shield and clearance zone
#''ISO 500-3'' Main PTO dimensions and spline dimensions, location of PTO.

The original type calls for operation at 540 [[revolutions per minute]] (RPM). A shaft that rotates at 540 rpm has 6 splines on it, and a diameter of 1{{frac|3|8}}". Two newer types, supporting higher power applications, operate at 1000 RPM and differ in shaft size. The larger shaft has 20 splines (1{{frac|3|4}}" diameter), while the smaller has 21 (1{{frac|3|8}}" diameter). All three types rotate counterclockwise when viewed from the tractor (When standing behind the tractor, the shaft turns clockwise). A 10 spline type was used with some early equipment such as the 1948 [[Land Rover]], a six spline adapter was usually supplied. It is customary for agricultural machines manufacturers to provide the nominal PTO power specification, an indication of the available instantaneous power at the shaft. Newer tractors may come equipped with 540/540E and/or 1000/1000E options that allow the tractor to power certain low-power-demand implements like hay rakes or tedders using lower engine speeds to maintain the revolutions per minute needed, using less fuel and placing less stress on the engine thereby improving efficiency and reducing costs. 

The first industry [[technical standard|standard]] for PTO design was adopted by ASAE (the [[American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers|American Society of Agricultural Engineers]]) in April 1927. The PTO rotational speed was specified as 536 ± 10 [[revolutions per minute|rpm]]; the direction was clockwise. The speed was later changed to 540 rpm.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asabe.org/imis/StaticContent/4/October_2004/p_31_last_word.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use on commercial vehicles==
[[File:PTO gearbox.JPG|thumb|A hydraulic PTO mounted on a truck gearbox]]
[[File:Unimog-1980-05.jpg|thumb|Rear crossbar with PTO hydraulic connectors and coupling on a [[Unimog]] 421]]
[[Truck transmissions]] have one or more locations which allow for a PTO to be mounted. The PTO must be purchased separately and care is required to match the physical interface of the transmission with a compatible PTO. PTO suppliers will usually require details of the make, model and even serial number of the transmission. Care is also needed to ensure that the physical space around the transmission allows for installation of the PTO. The PTO is engaged/disengaged using the main transmission clutch and a remote control mechanism which operates on the PTO itself. Typically an air valve is used to engage the PTO, but a mechanical linkage, electric or hydraulic mechanism are also options.

Most [[Unimog]]s come with front and/or rear PTOs and hydraulics as well as three point hitch systems.

Units will be rated according to the continuous and intermittent torque that can be applied through them and different models will offer different "PTO shaft rotation to engine RPM" ratios.

In the majority of cases, the PTO will connect directly to a [[hydraulic pump]]. This allows for transmission of mechanical force through the [[hydraulic fluid]] system to any location around the vehicle where a hydraulic motor will convert it back into rotary or linear mechanical force. Typical applications include:
* Running a water pump on a fire engine or water truck
* Running a truck mounted hot water extraction machine for carpet cleaning (driving vacuum blower and high-pressure solution pumps)
* Powering a blower system used to move dry materials such as cement
* Raising a dump truck bed
* Operating the mechanical arm on a bucket truck used by electrical maintenance personnel or Cable TV maintenance crews
* Operating a winch on a tow truck
* Operating the compactor on a garbage truck
* Operating a Boom/Grapple truck
* Operating a truck mounted [[tree spade]] and lift-mast assembly

===Split shaft ===
A split shaft PTO is mounted to the truck's drive shaft to provide power to the PTO. Such a unit is an additional gearbox that separates the vehicle's drive shaft into two parts:
* The gearbox-facing shaft which will transmit the power of the engine to the split shaft PTO;
* The axle-facing shaft which transmit the propelling power to the axle.
The unit itself is designed to independently divert the engine's power to either the axle-facing shaft or the additional PTO output shaft. This is done by two independent clutches like tooth or dog clutches which can be operated at total driveline standstill, only. Since the main gearbox changes the rotation speed by selection of a gear the PTO cannot be operated during driving. The vehicle needs to be stationary for operation therefore.
On 4x4 vehicles only the rear drive shaft is used by the split shaft PTO gearbox requiring the vehicles 4x4 drive scheme to be of the ''selectable 4WD'' type to keep the front axle drive shaft completely decoupled during PTO operation.
It is also possible to connect something other than a hydraulic pump directly to the PTO for example, fire truck pumps.

==="Sandwich" split shaft===
A "Sandwich" type split shaft unit  is mounted between engine and transmission and used on road maintenance vehicles, fire fighting vehicles and off-road vehicles. This unit gets the drive directly from the engine shaft and can be capable of delivering up to the complete engine power to the PTO. Usually these units come with their own lubricating system. Due to the sandwich mounting style the gearbox will be moved away from the engine requiring the driveline to accommodate the installation.

'''Pyroban''' began as a project implemented by [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI) after the accidental release and ignition of a [[flammable]] [[vapour]] by a diesel engine at its Wilton Plant in the [[UK]] in 1969.

In 1972 Power Research Ltd was formed by Phil Tyrer, to offer a sub-contract prototype design and development service to prevent industrial equipment creating an [[explosion]] in a flammable atmosphere. Power Research carried out development work for the Pyroban project and in 1974 changed its name to Pyroban Ltd offering [[explosion proof]] solutions to industries such as oil and gas, mining and manufacturing.

In 1980 the company pioneered gas detection used on [[battery electric vehicle]]s such as [[forklift]] trucks so that they could be used in areas where flammable gas or vapour is present.  This method is still being used today.

Pyroban was acquired by [[Caterpillar Inc.]] on 31 August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caterpillar Acquires Pyroban Statement|url=http://catoilandgas.cat.com/cda/files/3027453/7/Caterpillar+Acquires+Pyroban+Statement+FINAL.doc|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New ownership for Pyroban {{!}} Pyroban Group Ltd {{!}} Explosion Protection &amp;amp; Environmental Solutions|url=http://www.pyroban.com/en/news-and-events/news/pyroban/313-new-ownership-for-pyroban.html|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

As of 17 November 2017, safety company Pyroban is under new ownership after Caterpillar Inc. divested its 100% interest in the Pyroban Group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1488">[[File:The use of a raster data structure to summarize a point pattern.gif|thumb|Using a raster to summarize a point pattern.]]
A '''raster data''' structure is based on a (usually rectangular, square-based) [[tessellation]] of the 2D [[plane (geometry)|plane]] into cells. In the example the cells of tessellation A are overlaid on the point pattern B resulting in an array C of quadrant counts representing the number of points in each cell. For purposes of visualization a [[lookup table]] has been used to color each of the cells in an image D. Here are the numbers as a simple vector in row/column order:

1 3 0 0 1 12 8 0 1 4 3 3 0 2 0 2 1 7 4 1 5 4 2 2 0 3 1 2 2 2 2 3 0 5 1 9 3 3 3 4 5 0 8 0 2 4 3 2 8 4 3 2 2 7 2 3 2 10 1 5 2 1 3 7

Finally, here is a [[run-length encoding|run-length encoded]] representation of the raster, which has 55 positions:
 values : 1 3 0 1 12 8 0 1 4 3 ...
 lengths: 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 ...

This process clearly results in a [[Data loss|loss of information]], from the real-valued [[coordinate system|coordinates]] of the points, through the integer cell counts, to the ordinal colors, but there are also gains:

*The [[data structure]] is usually more compact,
*The raster is easy to [[Computer graphics|visualize]], and
*It can be related to other rasters provided the locations and [[image resolution|resolutions]] are properly [[conflated]].

'''STSAT-2C''', or '''Science and Technology Satellite 2C''', or Naro Science Satellite(ko:나로과학위성) is a [[South Korea]]n [[satellite]] which was launched in 2013. It is operated by the [[Korea Aerospace Research Institute]], and is intended to demonstrate technology for future spacecraft. The satellite has a mass of {{convert|100|kg}}, and is expected to operate for less than a year.&lt;ref name="nsf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gsp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/stsat-2c.htm|title=STSAT-2C|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

STSAT-2C was launched at 07:00 UTC on 30 January 2013, on the third flight of the [[Naro-1]] carrier rocket, with a [[Russia]]n first stage derived from the [[Angara (rocket family)|Angara]] and a South Korean second stage.&lt;ref name="RSW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/kslv.html|title=KSLV-1 launch vehicle|first=Anatoly|last=Zak|accessdate=30 January 2013|publisher=RussianSpaceWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liftoff occurred from the [[Naro Space Center|Naro Space Centre]], and the rocket successfully deployed the satellite into at {{convert|292|by|1511|km|mi|adj=on}} [[low Earth orbit]] [[orbital inclination|inclined]] at 80.3 degrees. The launch marked the first successful flight of the Naro-1, which had previously failed to launch [[STSAT-2A]] in 2009 and [[STSAT-2B]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="RSW"/&gt;

[[File:Frederic Remington smoke signal.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Native Americans on a painting by [[Frederic Remington]]]]
The '''smoke signal''' is one of the oldest forms of long-distance communication. It is a form of [[visual communication]] used over long distance.  In general smoke signals are used to transmit news, signal danger, or gather people to a common area.

==History and usage==
In [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], soldiers stationed along the [[Great Wall]] would alert each other of impending enemy attack by signaling from tower to tower. In this way, they were able to transmit a message as far away as {{convert|750|km}}{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} in just a few hours.

Misuse of the smoke signal is known to have contributed to the fall of the Western Zhou Dynasty in the 8th century [[BCE]]. [[King You of Zhou]] had a habit of fooling his warlords with false warning beacons in order to amuse [[Bao Si]], his concubine who was known as one of four ancient beauties of China. When an actual rebellion occurred, no one came to the aid of the king.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

[[Polybius]], a Greek [[historian]], devised a more complex system of alphabetical smoke signals around 150 BCE, which converted Greek alphabetic characters into numeric characters. It enabled messages to be easily signaled by holding sets of [[torch]]es in pairs. This idea, known as the "[[Polybius square]]", also lends itself to [[cryptography]] and [[steganography]]. This cryptographic concept has been used with Japanese [[Hiragana]] and the Germans in the later years of the [[First World War]].

The [[North American Indians|North American indigenous peoples]] also communicated via smoke signal. Each [[tribe]] had its own signaling system and understanding. A signaler started a fire on an elevation typically using damp grass, which would cause a column of smoke to rise. The grass would be taken off as it dried and another bundle would be placed on the fire. Reputedly the location of the smoke along the incline conveyed a meaning. If it came from halfway up the hill, this would signify all was well, but from the top of the hill it would signify danger.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Smoke signals remain in use today. In [[Rome]], the [[College of Cardinals]] uses smoke signals to indicate the selection of a new [[Pope]] during a [[papal conclave]]. Eligible cardinals conduct a [[secret ballot]] until someone receives a vote of two-thirds plus one. The ballots are burned after each vote. Black smoke indicates a failed ballot, while white smoke means a new Pope has been elected.

Colored [[smoke grenade]]s are commonly used by military forces to mark positions, especially during calls for artillery or air support.

Smoke signals may also refer to smoke-producing devices used to send [[distress signal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Pyrotechnic device|date=Feb 4, 1964|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US3120183|issue=US3120183 A|accessdate=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Smoke signal|date=Nov 28, 1967|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US3354829|issue=US3354829 A|accessdate=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Native Americans===

Lewis and Clark's journals cite several occasions when they adopted the Native American method of setting the plains on fire to communicate the presence of their party or their desire to meet with local tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/fire/utility/uti_tl_perspectivestext.cfm |title=Nation Park Service Fire History Timeline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/read/?_xmlsrc=1805-07-20.xml&amp;_xslsrc=LCstyles.xsl |title=Lewis and Clark Journals, July 20, 1805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yámana====
[[Yaghan|Yámana]]s of [[South America]] used fire to send messages by smoke signals, for instance if a whale drifted ashore.&lt;ref&gt;Gusinde 1966:137–139, 186&lt;/ref&gt; The large amount of meat required notification of many people, so that it would not decay.&lt;ref&gt;Itsz 1979:109&lt;/ref&gt; They might also have used smoke signals on other occasions, thus it is possible that Magellan saw such fires (which inspired him to name the landscape [[Tierra del Fuego]]) but he may have seen the smoke or lights of natural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.interlog.com/~erhard/uttermos.htm |title=The Patagonian Canoe |publisher=Pages.interlog.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Extracts from the following book. E. Lucas Bridges: ''Uttermost Part of the Earth. Indians of Tierra del Fuego.'' 1949, reprinted by Dover Publications, Inc (New York, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noon Gun ===
The [[Cape Town]] [[Noon Gun#Time signalling|Noon Gun]], specifically the smoke its firing generates, was used to set [[marine chronometer]]s in [[Table Bay]].

===Aboriginal Australians===
[[Aboriginal Australians]] throughout Australia would send up smoke signals for various purposes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Red Chief|last=Idriess|first=Ion L|publisher=ettimprint|year=1953|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Over the Range|last=Idriess|first=Ion L|publisher=ettimprint|year=1937|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes to notify others of their presence, particularly when entering lands which were not their own.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Myers, 1986: 100&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes used to describe visiting whites, smoke signals were the fastest way to send messages.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Smoke signals were sometimes to notify of incursions by hostile tribes, or to arrange meetings between hunting parties of the same tribe. This signal could be from a fixed lookout on a ridge of from a mobile band of tribesman.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; "Putting up a smoke" would often result in nearby individuals or groups replying with their own signals.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on Patrol to Lake Mackay Area June/July 1957|url=http://www.cifhs.com/|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; To carry information, the colour of the smoke was varied, sometimes black, white or blue depending on whether the material being burnt was wet grass, dry grass, reeds or other, and the shape of the smoke could be a column, ball or smoke ring. This message could include the names of individual tribesmen.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Like other means of communication, signals could be misinterpreted. In one recorded instance, a smoke signal reply translated as "we are coming" was misinterpreted as joining a war party for protection of the tribe when it was actually hunting parties coming together after a successful hunt.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Aviation===
Modern avionics has made [[skywriting]] possible.

[[File:PMD 85-1.jpg|thumb|The 8-bit [[PMD 85]] personal computer produced in 1985–1990 by the '''Tesla''' company in the former socialist  [[Czechoslovakia]]. This computer was produced locally (in [[Piešťany]]) due to a lack of foreign currency with which to buy systems from the West.]]

'''TESLA''' (originally named after [[Nikola Tesla]], later explained as abbreviation from ''"'''TE'''chnika '''SLA'''boproudá"'', which means "low-voltage technology") was a large, state-owned electrotechnical [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] in the former [[Czechoslovakia]].

The company was established as ''Elektra'' on 18 January 1921 and renamed TESLA on 7 March 1946. TESLA had a state-sponsored [[monopoly]] on [[electronics]] production in [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], and produced nearly all electronic products in the country until 1989.  Many subsidiaries were created from the original brand, including those at [[Liptovský Hrádok]], [[Hradec Králové]], [[Pardubice]], [[Žďár nad Sázavou]], [[Bratislava]], and [[Nižná, Tvrdošín District|Nižná]]. Later, some of them were transformed into independent state-owned companies.

This was officially reported by Radioamator in October 1946: Tesla the National Enterprise was set up on 10 August at the Mikrofon Factory in Strašnice with the participation of Yugoslavian Minister Zlataric Branko, Minister of Industry of Macedonia Vasilijev Georgie, Minister of Industry of B. Laušman, representatives of government, institutions and universities. The enterprise was named after a genial Slavic technician and it documents the effort for convergence and cooperation among all Slavic nations. The main task of nationalized industry is to quickly overcome all post-war troubles and woes, and to create a socially healthy and productive work environment. Then the Minister declared Tesla as established.

The company had a wide range of production: TVs, radio receivers, transistors, integrated circuits, screens, speakers, turntables, disc and cassette recorders, CD players, video cassettes etc. However, quantity usually did not meet the needs of industrial customers and many products gradually became [[obsolete]] simply because they were not updated; e.g. one particular type of [[diode]] was manufactured for over 30 years without modifications.

Other products, e.g. some kinds of [[silicon controlled rectifier|SCR]]s or Power-[[Transistor]]s were competitive with the world market and so TESLA was the supplier for all eastern Europe Countries. Some high quality products were even exported to western countries, for example, the turntables NC 470 or NC 500 under the tradename Lenco.

The most well-known international Tesla product was the Tesla 308U Talisman bakelite radio designed by Igor Didov of Tesla Bratislava and made by several Tesla company branches between 1953 and 1958&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ostblok.sk/OBPub/product.xhtml;jsessionid=F51F89D1738C49088934F45582B5A42A?productId=4|title=Tesla 308U Talisman|accessdate=2016-05-17|work=Ostblok}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reel-to-reel tape recorder Sonet duo (1959-1965). The well-known was also military passive radar [[Tamara passive sensor|KRTP-86 Tamara]] (TESLA Pardubice, 1986), which was claimed to be the only one in the world able to detect military "[[Stealth technology|invisible aircraft]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Radaru Věra prokletí Tamary nehrozí|url=https://ekonomika.idnes.cz/radaru-vera-prokleti-tamary-nehrozi-d76-/ekonomika.aspx?c=A040528_114007_ekonomika_ven|work=iDNES.cz|date=28 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TESLA had to contend with both foreign and new domestic competition after the [[Velvet Revolution|fall of communism]] in Czechoslovakia, and had difficulty competing effectively, which resulted in dramatic downsizing and [[privatization]] of the majority of its stores and production facilities. TESLA's logo is a rare sight in the present-day [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], as only a few of its subsidiaries have survived. One of its former subsidiaries, the Slovak [[JJ Electronic]] in [[Čadca]] is known for its production of [[vacuum tubes]] and TESLA Litovel is known for its production of high-end turntables known as Pro-Ject. The direct successor in the Czech Republic is TESLA, joint-stock company of Praha- Hloubětín. It owns a trademark in more than 80 countries in the world.

After series of actions taken by Tesla a.s. against Tesla Motors Inc. the contract between Tesla Holding a.s. and Tesla Motors Inc. was signed on 06.10.2010  stating a coexistence of TESLA trademarks and regulating relationships between them. 
Preamble to the Tesla trademarks coexistence agreement:
(A) Tesla Motors owns a number of trademark applications and registrations consisting of or containing the word TESLA.¨
(B) Tesla Holding owns a number of trademark applications and registrations consisting of or containing the word TESLA.
(C) Tesla Holding and Tesla Motors wish to enter into a coexistence agreement relating to the TESLA trademark.

In 2015, the first primary battery comes to market under the trade name Tesla Batteries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5426">'''VOC BioTreat™''' is a [[Patent pending|U.S. patent pending]] technology from [[Ramboll Environ]] that destroys [[Volatile organic compounds|volatile organic compounds (VOCs)]] by piping them into a deep-tank aerated [[activated sludge]] [[wastewater treatment plant]].&lt;ref name="cost-effective solution"&gt;[http://www.environvoc.com/ “VOC BIOTREAT: A cost-effective solution for the biodestruction of volatile organic compound emissions” ] ENVIRON. Retrieved 2013-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt;  The technology meets [[EPA|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)]] standards for VOC and [[Hazardous Air Pollutant]] removal and can be used with existing pollution [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] infrastructure at refineries, chemical companies, pharmaceutical manufactures and others.&lt;ref name="cost-effective solution"/&gt; 

== Health hazards of VOCs ==

Emissions of volatile organic compounds such as [[benzene]] from [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]] and [[Chemical plant|chemical plants]] pose a long-term health risk to workers and local communities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fugitive emissions|“Fugitive Emissions,”]] Wikipedia. Retrieved 2013-08-28.&lt;/ref&gt;  The EPA regulates VOCs mainly because of their ability to create [[photochemical smog]] and regards reducing the concentration of VOCs as an important health and environmental goal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/iaq/voc2.html “Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) Technical Overview”] U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Indoor Air. Retrieved 2013-08-28.&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Technological approach ==

VOC BioTreat expands upon existing pollution remediation infrastructure at industrial companies. It pipes [[biodegradable]] airborne VOCs into the [[biotreatment]] plant treating waterborne VOCs. This eliminates the need for a separate approach to addressing airborne emissions by using activated [[carbon filter|carbon filters]] and burning the residue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enr.construction.com/business_management/companies/2011/0420-vocbiotreat.asp “Environ’s VOC BioTreat” ] Engineering News-Record. 20 April 2011. Retrieved 2013-08-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work in developing the protocols and resulting solutions on VOC BioTreat was led by Dr. Carl Adams, Ramboll Environ's Global Practice Leader for Industrial Waste Management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ce.utexas.edu/news-events/news-stories/adams-E3.html “Alumnus Carl Adams Awarded E3 Grand Prize in Research for 2011”] The University of Texas at Austin, Cockrell School of Engineering. Retrieved 2013-08-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Adams holds three patents involving advanced industrial wastewater treatment technology. He has worked with over 90 refineries in [[North America]] and around the world. He is recognized by the EPA as an expert in the development of cost-effective volatile organic compounds (VOC) control technologies, especially for refineries and [[petrochemical]] plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.epa.gov/sites/production/files/documents/wastewater-treatment-technical-workshop-participant-bios.pdf “Wastewater Treatment and Related Modeling Workshop Participants”] U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Participant Bios, April 18, 2013 meeting in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. Retrieved 2013-08-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and honors ==

Following the use of VOC BioTreat at the [[Marathon Petroleum Company|Marathon Petroleum Company’s]] refinery in [[Garyville, Louisiana]], ENVIRON, whose operations preceded Ramboll Environ, received the 2011 Grand Prize in Research from the [[American Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists]].&lt;ref name= "grand prize"&gt;[http://www.aaees.org/downloadcenter/EESV47N2Spring2011.pdf “Grand Prize – Research, Patented &amp; Innovative Cost-Saving Control Device for Facility-Generated Volatile organic Compound (VOC) Emissions, Marathon Refinery, Garyville, Louisiana” ] Environmental Engineer, publication of the American Academy of Environmental Engineers, Spring 2011, p. 38. Retrieved 2013-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt;    The Academy said, “Refineries and chemical industries with a current activated sludge system that meet certain criteria would be strong candidates for ENVIRON’s new VOC BioTreat™ approach,” while also noting that the technology “greatly reduces [[capital investment]]” and “long-term [[operational costs]].”&lt;ref name= "grand prize"/&gt;  

In September 2011, VOC BioTreat was a semi-finalist for the Kirkpatrick Chemical Engineering Achievement Award. ''Chemical Engineering Magazine'' has awarded this biennial prize continuously since 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environcorp.com/news/2011/09/environ%E2%80%99s-voc-biotreat%E2%84%A2-named-semi-finalist-for-ki.aspx “ENVIRON’s VOC BioTreat™ named semi-finalist for Kirkpatrick Award”] ENVIRON news release, 28 September 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13951">A '''waste heat recovery unit (WHRU)''' is an [[energy recovery]] [[heat exchanger]] that transfers heat from process outputs at high temperature to another part of the process for some purpose, usually increased efficiency. The WHRU is a tool involved in [[cogeneration]]. Waste heat may be extracted from sources such as hot [[flue gas]]es from a diesel generator, steam from [[cooling towers]], or even [[waste water]] from cooling processes such as in [[quenching|steel cooling]].

[[File:Regenerative thermal oxidizer.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Regenerative thermal oxidizer]] (RTO) is an example of a waste heat recovery unit that utilizes a regenerative process.]]

==Principle==

===Heat recovery units===
Waste heat found in the [[exhaust gas]] of various processes or even from the exhaust stream of a [[Air conditioner|conditioning unit]] can be used to preheat the incoming gas. This is one of the basic methods for recovery of waste heat. Many [[Steel mill|steel making plants]] use this process as an economic method to increase the production of the plant with lower fuel demand.&lt;br/&gt;
There are many different commercial recovery units for the transferring of energy from hot medium space to lower one:&lt;ref&gt;Heat Recovery Systems, D.A.Reay, E &amp; F.N.Span, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Recuperator]]s: This name is given to different types of [[heat exchanger]] that the exhaust gases are passed through, consisting of metal tubes that carry the inlet gas and thus preheating the gas before entering the process. The [[Thermal wheel|heat wheel]] is an example which operates on the same principle as a [[solar air conditioning#Solar A/C using desiccants|solar air conditioning]] unit.
#[[Regenerative heat exchanger|Regenerators]]: This is an industrial unit that reuses the same stream after processing. In this type of heat recovery, the heat is regenerated and reused in the process.
#[[Heat pipe|Heat pipe exchanger]]: Heat pipes are one of the best thermal conductors. They have the ability to transfer heat hundred times more than copper. Heat pipes are mainly known in renewable energy technology as being used in [[evacuated tube collector]]s. The heat pipe is mainly used in space, process or air heating, in waste heat from a process is being transferred to the surrounding due to its [[Heat pipe|transfer mechanism]].
#[[Thermal Wheel]] or rotary heat exchanger: consists of a circular honeycomb matrix of heat absorbing material, which is slowly rotated within the supply and exhaust air streams of an air handling system.
#[[Economizer]]: In case of process boilers, waste heat in the exhaust gas is passed along a recuperator that carries the inlet fluid for the boiler and thus decreases thermal energy intake of the inlet fluid.
#[[Heat pumps]]: Using an organic fluid that boils at a low temperature means that energy could be regenerated from waste fluids.
#[[Run around coil]]: comprises two or more multi-row finned tube coils connected to each other by a pumped pipework circuit.
Particulate Filters (DPF) to capture emission by maintaining higher temperatures adjacent to the converter and tail pipes to reduce the amount of emissions from the exhaust.

=== Electric Turbo Compounding (ETC) ===
Electric Turbo Compounding (ETC) is a technology solution to the challenge of improving energy efficiency for the stationary power generation industry.

Fossil fuel based power generation is predicted to continue for decades, especially in developing economies. This is against the global need to reduce carbon emissions, of which, a high percentage is produced by the power sector worldwide.

ETC works by making gas and diesel-powered gensets (Electric Generators) work more effectively and cleaner, by recovering waste energy from the exhaust to improve power density and fuel efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

* Gives independent power providers (IPPs), power rental companies and generator OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) a competitive advantage and potential increased market share.
* Improves overall efficiency of the genset, including fuel input costs and helping end-users reduce amount of fuel burned. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

* There will be additional weight to add an ETC to a current unit.
* Process still uses fossil fuels, thus still has a carbon footprint in a renewable age.
* They are bespoke to each generator so the design, build and implementation can be a lengthy process.
* There are challenges with high speed turbo generators such as high stress in the rotors, heat generation of the electrical machine and rotordynamics of the turbo generator system.

===Heat to power units===
According to a report done by [[Energetics Incorporated]] for the [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] in November 2004 titled ''Technology Roadmap''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/manufacturing/intensiveprocesses/pdfs/reduction_roadmap.pdf|title=Technology Roadmap Energy Loss Reduction and Recovery |date=November 2004|author= Energetics Incorporated|publisher= U.S. Department of Energy, [[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy]]|format=pdf|accessdate=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several others done by the [[European commission]], the majority of energy production from conventional and renewable resources are lost to the atmosphere due to onsite (equipment inefficiency and losses due to waste heat) and offsite (cable and transformers losses) losses, that sums to be around 66% loss in electricity value.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrel.gov/dtet/about.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
Waste heat of different degrees could be found in final products of a certain process or as a by-product in industry such as the [[slag]] in [[steelmaking]] plants. Units or devices that could recover the waste heat and transform it into electricity are called WHRUs or heat to power units. For example, an [[Organic Rankine cycle]] unit uses an organic fluid as the [[working fluid]]. The fluid has a lower boiling point than water to allow it to boil at low temperature, to form a [[superheated]] gas that could drive the blade of a turbine and thus a generator. [[Thermoelectric]] ([[Seebeck effect|Seebeck]], [[Peltier effect|Peltier]], [[Thomson effect|Thomson]] effects) units may also be called WHRU, since they use the heat differential between two plates to produce DC Power.

[[Shape-memory alloy|Shape-memory alloys]] can also be used to recover low temperature waste heat and convert it to mechanical action or electricity&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exergyn.com&lt;/ref&gt;. 

 
A WHRB is different from a Heat Recovery Steam Generator ([[HRSG]]) in the sense that the heated medium does not change phase.

==Applications==

* Traditionally, waste heat of low temperature range (0-120&amp;nbsp;°C, or typically under 100&amp;nbsp;°C) has not been used for electricity generation despite efforts by ORC companies,{{Citation needed|date = April 2015}} mainly because the Carnot efficiency is rather low (max. 18% for 90&amp;nbsp;°C heating and 20&amp;nbsp;°C cooling, minus losses, typically ending up with 5-7% net electricity). 
* Waste Heat of medium (120-650&amp;nbsp;°C) and high (&gt;650&amp;nbsp;°C) temperature could be used for the generation of electricity or mechanical work via different capturing processes.
* Waste heat recovery system can also be used to fulfill refrigeration requirements of a trailer (for example). The configuration is easy as only a waste heat recovery boiler and absorption cooler is required. Furthermore only low pressures and temperatures needed to be handled.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Advantages:

These systems have many benefits which could be direct or indirect.

* Direct benefits: The recovery process will add to the efficiency of the process and thus decrease the costs of fuel and energy consumption needed for that process.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090401102235.htm Tapping Industrial Waste Heat Could Reduce Fossil Fuel Demands&lt;/ref&gt;
* Indirect benefits:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.em-ea.org&lt;/ref&gt;
#Reduction in [[Pollution]]: [[Thermal pollution|Thermal]] and [[air pollution|air]] pollution will dramatically decrease since less [[flue gases]] of high temperature are emitted from the plant since most of the energy is recycled.
#Reduction in the equipment sizes: As Fuel consumption reduces so the control and security equipment for handling the fuel decreases. Also, filtering equipment for the gas is no longer needed in large sizes.
#Reduction in auxiliary energy consumption: Reduction in equipment sizes means another reduction in the energy fed to those systems like pumps, filters, fans,...etc.

Disadvantages:

*Capital cost: The capital cost to implement a waste heat recovery system may outweigh the benefit gained in heat recovered. It is necessary to put a cost to the heat being offset.
*Quality of heat: Often waste heat is of low quality (temperature). It can be difficult to efficiently utilize the quantity of low quality heat contained in a waste heat medium. Heat exchangers tend to be larger to recover significant quantities which increases capital cost.
*Maintenance of Equipment: Additional equipment requires additional maintenance cost.
*Units add addition size and mass to overall power unit. Especially a consideration on power units which are on vehicles.

==Example==
The [[Cyclone Waste Heat Engine|Cyclone]] waste heat engine is designed to generate electricity from recovered waste heat energy using a steam cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyclonepower.com/works.html Cyclone Power Technologies Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[International Wastewater Heat Exchange Systems|International Wastewater Systems]] is another company addressing waste heat recovery systems. Focused on  multi-unit residential, publicly shared buildings, industrial applications and district energy systems, their systems use the energy in [[waste water]] for domestic hot water production, building space heating and cooling.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2012/12/121211-sewage-heat-recovery/|title=Waste Wattage: Cities Aim to Flush Heat Energy Out of Sewers|publisher=news.nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=2014-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motorsport series [[Formula One]] introduced waste heat recovery units in 2014 under the name MGU-H. The MGU-H will be abandoned for the 2021 due to development costs.

A '''wire brush''' is a [[tool]] consisting of a [[brush]] whose [[bristle]]s are made of [[wire]], most often [[steel]] wire. The steel used is generally a [[steel grades|medium- to high-carbon variety]] and very [[hardness|hard]] and [[spring steel|springy]]. Other wire brushes feature bristles made from [[brass]] or [[stainless steel]], depending on application. Wires in a wire brush can be held together by [[epoxy]], [[staple (fastener)|staples]], or other binding. Wire brushes usually either have a [[handle]] of wood or plastic (for handheld use) or are formed into a wheel for use on [[angle grinder]]s, [[bench grinder]]s, [[drill|pistol-grip drill motors]], or other power tools.

==Uses==

The wire brush is primarily an abrasive implement, used for cleaning rust and removing paint. It is also used to clean surfaces and to create a better conductive area for attaching electrical connections, such as those between [[car battery]] posts and their connectors, should they accumulate a build-up of grime and dirt. When cleaning [[stainless steel]], it is advisable to use a stainless steel bristle wire brush, as a plain carbon steel brush can contaminate the stainless steel and cause rust spots to appear. Brass bristle brushes are used on softer surfaces or when it is necessary to clean a harder surface without marring it. Brass bristle brushed are also used in potentially flammable environments where non-sparking tools are required. Wire brushes are also used to clean the teeth of large animals, such as crocodiles and pigs.  They are also used widely in surface engineering to clean the castings to paint the castings.

==History==
The origins of the wire brush are unknown, although it is believed that the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used similar tools in the manufacture of [[roof tile]]s. As the [[Roman Empire]] fell, the tool fell out of use.

==Barbeque grill cleaning==
A number of surgeons recommend that wire brushes not be used to clean [[barbecue grill]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/barbecue-brushes-dangers-swallow-throat-wire-bristle-dempsey-1.3741578|title=Toss BBQ brushes before bristles get stuck in your throat, surgeon urges|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, bristles break off the brush which then become deposited in food cooked on the grill. Ingestion of these bristles can cause [[gastrointestinal perforation]].&lt;ref name="pmid22763887"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)| title=Injuries from ingestion of wire bristles from grill-cleaning brushes - Providence, Rhode Island, March 2011-June 2012. | journal=MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep | year= 2012 | volume= 61 | issue= 26 | pages= 490–2 | doi= | pmc= | pmid=22763887  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26932965"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Baugh TP, Hadley JB, Chang CW| title=Epidemiology of Wire-Bristle Grill Brush Injury in the United States, 2002-2014. | journal=Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg | year= 2016 | volume= 154 | issue= 4 | pages= 645–9 | doi=10.1177/0194599815627794 | pmc= | pmid=26932965  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zenith Solar''' was an [[Israel]]i [[solar energy]] company based in [[Ness Ziona]].

==History==
Zenith Solar was founded in 2006 by Roy Segev, [[David Faiman]] and Bob Whelen.&lt;ref name=BW&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/mar2008/gb20080326_485582.htm? At the Zenith of Solar Energy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007054706/http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/mar2008/gb20080326_485582.htm? |date=October 7, 2008 }}, Neal Sandler, ''[[Businessweek]]'', March 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, David Faiman, director of the [[Ben-Gurion National Solar Energy Center]], announced that the Center had entered into a project with Zenith to create a home solar energy system that uses a 10 square meter reflector dish.&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL16893018 Reflective mirrors seen raising solar potential], Ari Rabinovitch, [[Reuters]], August 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Zenith bought the rights to solar technology from [[Ben-Gurion University]] and Germany's [[Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE]] to create solar energy using mirrors and lenses that magnify and focus the sun's rays. In testing, the concentrated solar technology proved to be up to five times more efficient than standard flat [[photovoltaic]] [[silicon]] panels, which would make it almost as cheap as oil and natural gas.  A prototype ready for commercialization achieved a concentration of solar energy that was more than 1,000 times greater than standard flat panels.&lt;ref name=BW/&gt;  According to Faiman, who led the Israeli team that developed the technology, 10% of Israel’s energy needs (1,000 [[megawatts]]) could be met from 12 square kilometres of land.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;[http://greenprophet.com/2007/12/16/7/the-light-of-a-thousand-suns/ Zenith Solar’s Light of a Thousand Suns], ''Green Prophet'', December 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Zenith Solar was assembling solar panel kits at its factory in [[Kiryat Gat]].&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/anglo-file/born-again-ziontist-revolutionizing-solar-energy-field-1.388639 Born-again Ziontist revolutionizing solar energy field, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The company used CHP (combined heat and power) technology which it claimed reached efficiencies of over 70%. Marketing claims included "harvesting more energy from a smaller space, less landfill produced from their waste." and "99% recyclable."&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"/&gt;

In June 2013 Zenith filed for bankruptcy &lt;ref&gt;PV-Magazine 2013/10/18&lt;/ref&gt; and in December of that year they were acquired by [[Suncore Photovoltaics]] Technology Company Limited, a Chinese-US joint venture that specialises in [[Concentrated photovoltaics|CPV]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barlaw.co.il/content/chinas-suncore-represented-barnea-co-acquired-assets-israels-zenith-solar-0 China's Suncore represented by Barnea &amp; Co. acquired the assets of Israel's Zenith Solar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224120348/http://www.barlaw.co.il/content/chinas-suncore-represented-barnea-co-acquired-assets-israels-zenith-solar-0 |date=December 24, 2013 }}, Barnea &amp; Co&lt;/ref&gt;
